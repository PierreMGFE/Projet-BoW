I F C w i l l complement the IDA p rog ram by continuing t o p rov ide investments and technical 
assistance ( T A ) t o f i n a n c i a l institutions in order to deepen the f inanc ia l sector and expand the 
range of and access t o f inanc ia l products. I F C w i l l also consider d i rec t investments i n a g r i - 
business; tou r ism and related sectors; transport; logistics; re ta i l services; p r iva te companies 
engaged in infrastructure and the p rov is ion of social services; and companies engaged i n 
manufacturing o r developing natural resources for export markets. I F C T A w i l l a im t o help 
reduce ba r r ie rs t o business. MIGA is presently discussing p rov is ion of p o l i t i c a l risk 
guarantees and T A on investment promotion. 

The CPS w i l l seek t o both catalyze and complement efsorts of other donors. The 
proposed PSRSP, f o r example, w i l l catalyze twice as many funds f rom other donors, and IDA 
support fo r the t rans i t c o r r i d o r w i l l help a t t rac t both dono r and p r iva te sector f inanc ing . IDA 
and the US M i l l e n n i um Challenge Co rpo ra t ion (M C C ) have agreed to an innovative 
arrangement whereby IDA w i l l assist in the supervision of M C C f inanc ing of mun ic ipa l 
infrastructure 
t o be implemented in co l labo ra t ion w i t h the Mun ic ipa l Development Fund 
(MDF). A proposed Ca rbon Fund operation w i l l a lso complement M C C f inanc ing of v i t a l 
repa i r of a ma jo r gas p ipe l ine . 

T h e FY06 envelope f o r new IDA fund ing w i l l be SDR 22.6 m i l l i o n (approximately 
US$33 m i l l ion ) , of w h i c h about US$15 m i l l ion w i l l be ava i lab le as grants. The indicated 
level of IDA f inanc ing over the fou r year CPS pe r iod is US$143 m i l l ion . However, actual 
allocations w i l l be established annually by the I D A performance-based a l loca t ion fo rmu la . If 
add i t iona l fund ing becomes ava i lab le due to improved performance, the size of activities may 
be increased and possible projects i n health o r other infrastructure areas w i l l be considered. 

Wh i le Geo rg ia ’s debt situation is improving, i t s t i l l faces a moderate risk of worsening 
that w i l l likely preclude no rma l I BRD lending du r ing th is CPS pe r iod . Geo rg ia ’s debt burden 
is s t i l l vulnerable to adverse extemal and domestic developments that can be mitigated by 
continued implementation of measures to increase fo re ign d i rec t investment and enhance 
export pegormance. Throughout the CPS period, IDA w i l l w o r k closely w i t h the Govemment 
to strengthen Geo rg ia ’s eventual creditworthiness f o r non-concessional bo r row ing . 

I D A w i l l closely mon i to r conditions that cou ld undermine achievement of CPS 
objectives. These include: ( i ) a potential weakening of the p o l i t i c a l w i l l to overcome vested 
interests; ( i i ) inadequate progress on strengthening expenditure management and reducing 
f iduc ia ry risks; ( i i i ) an exacerbation of c iv i l conflict; ( i v ) ex tema l shocks on a relatively 
undiversified economy; and ( v ) na tu ra l disasters. The IDA p r o g r am w i l l help mitigate these 
risks by supporting efsorts to eliminate co r rup t ion ; improve expenditure management and 
f iduc ia ry controls; enhance regional development; broaden the sources of g row th ; and 
mitigate potential damage f rom na tu ra l disasters. 

Executive D i rec to rs may w ish t o consider the fo l low ing questions: 

Does the CPS p rov ide a we l l focused and balanced se t of activities, both ongoing and 
new, in support of Geo rg ia ’s development strategy, given the IDA envelope? 

Does the CPS establish a good foundation f o r pa r tne rsh ip w i t h the Govemment, c i v i l 
society, and other dono rs?

I m p r o v e d h i g h w a y in f r a s t ru c tu r e 

L im i ted t ranspo r ta t ion infrastructure is a ma jo r constraint t o economic activities and 

49. 
exploitation of the t ranspo r t co r r ido r . The poo r state of the h ighway ne two rk constrains the 
movement o f goods and people between Georgia’s cities, ports, and r u r a l areas; and through 
Georgia, along the transit corridor. As p rev ious ly discussed, large segments o f the popu la t ion 
are effectively l e f t out of the economy due t o limited connec t iv i ty t o ma jo r urban centers and 
transport facilities. L e s s than five percent o f the road ne two rk supports the transit economy 
and foreign trade, and many segments require rehab i l i ta t ion . The l o n g transit times, despite 
the re la t ive ly short distance and poo r road conditions add to transport costs and deter usage of 
the Georgian transit route. In i t s present state, limited capacity o n the h ighway ne two rk i s a 
binding constraint t o Georgia’s ab i l i ty t o exp lo i t increasing transport volumes arising f r om 
rap id ly rising wealth and economic ac t iv i ty in the Caucasus and Central Asia. 

IDA w i l l take the lead i n helping develop the ma in highway network. 

50. 
At present, 
there are n o other external development partners engaged in developing the m a i n h ighway 
network. ID A assistance in highways supports the med ium - te rm goal o f enhanced investment 
in agro-processing, tourism, and other comme rc ia l activities and a s ign i f ican t increase in 
transit trade, inc lud ing increased f lows t o and f r om Central Asia. ID A interventions w i l l help 
reduce transit times and costs; enable Georgia to handle s ign i f ican t ly increased t ra f f ic flows; 
and ensure sustainable maintenance o f the h ighway ne two rk . App rox ima te ly US$84 m i l l i o n 
in IDA disbursements and new commitments are expected over the CPS pe r iod towa rd these

ends. The ongo ing Roads P ro jec t and proposed se r ies o f Ro ad sm r an s i t C o r r i d o r P ro jec ts 
w i l l develop sections o f the h ighway ne two rk as w e l l as help ensure a steady and adequate 
leve l o f funding f o r road maintenance based o n charges related to road use and road access. 
The Gove rnmen t has strong ownership in developing the h ighway ne two rk and spec i f ica l ly 
reques ted IDA partnership, given IDA ’S p r i o r experience in this sector in Georgia and i t s 
capacity t o attract other sources o f finance - poss ib ly through pub l ic -p r iva te partnerships 
supported by pa r t ia l risk guarantees. The proposed P re - Inves tmen t I n f r a s t r u c t u r e F a c i l i t y 
w i l l be used t o explore such prospects. Ove r the fo r thcom ing CPS period, the M C C i s 
expected t o complement IDA wo rk by f inanc ing a US$lOO-125 m i l l i o n p ro jec t t o rehabilitate 
a h ighway f r o m Tbilisi t o the isolated reg ion o f Samtskhe-Javakheti in Southern Georgia. 
Deve lopmen t o f the transit corridor in Georgia i s also complemented b y pa ra l le l investments 
in the transit co r r ido r in Azerbaijan, also supported b y the Bank. 

I m p r o v e d access to rural in f ras t ruc tu re and services 

A range of constraints inhibits increased incomes and economic ac t iv i t ies i n r u r a l

areas. Constraints to greater value-added commercial activities in ru ra l areas inc lude l im i t e d 
connec t iv i ty t o markets and information; poo r pub l ic services (such as research and veterinary 
services; and standards, certification, and inspection systems); l im i t e d access t o ru ra l credit; 
and deteriorating i r r iga t ion and drainage infrastructure. L a c k o f transport options, in 
particular, isolates ru ra l fam i l ies f r om the na t iona l economy and has resulted in a high leve l of 
subsistence fa rm ing . A close correlation between pove r ty in ru ra l households and the extent 
t o w h i c h they are linked to markets exists and s tud ies have shown that loca l - leve l road 
projects generate clear economic benefits f o r communities. 

52. 

IDA assistance in ru ra l infrastructure w i l l complement main road development t o 
improve the environment fo r commercial activity i n r u r a l areas. Demand f o r ag r icu l tu ra l 

products i s expected t o be stimulated th rough imp roved access to markets and an increase in

effective and sustainable secondary and l o c a l road ne two rk to link in te r io r areas w i t h the ma in 
h ighway ne two rk . The ongoing A g r i c u l t u r a l Resea rch Ex tens ion and Training and Rural

a viable ru ra l bank ing system; (ii) imp rove access t o know -how and technologies by building 
more e f fec t ive agricultural knowledge systems; and (iii) enhance farmer incomes and access

I t w i l l 
also help restore i r r iga t ion infrastructure and r i v e r embankments damaged in the recent f loods 
and strengthen longer-term f l o o d protection measures. During the CPS period, IDA w i l l a im 
t o make substantial contributions t o the know ledge base o n ru ra l development th rough the 
CEM, the rural in f r a s t ru c tu r e study , and poss ib ly an ag r i cu l tu r e sector upd a t e . 
IDA 
expects to disburse approximately US$50 m i l l i o n over the fou r year CPS pe r iod t o support 
ru ra l development. In parallel, I FC w i l l consider investment in agro-processing industries. 
This i s being complemented b y investment f inanc ing f r om several partners. FAD (US$ lO

I m p r o v e d l e v e l and ta rge t ing o f social p ro tec t ion 

61. 
I D A ana ly t ica l and advisory services support improvements i n the ta rge t ing and 
eficiency of social p ro tec t ion systems. Social p ro tec t ion faces a number o f structural, 
institutional, financial, and implementation weaknesses that need t o be addressed, i f Georgia 
i s to have an affordable and effective social risk management system. 
In the past, poo r 
administration has resulted in wastage, over-coverage o f non-needy, and under-coverage o f 
needy. The pension system has suffered f r om accumulation o f arrears, a real decline in 
pension amounts, and a dec l in ing p ropo r t ion o f emp loyed persons t o pensioners. The 
Government has taken steps to address bo th these areas, pay ing social transfers o n time, 
doub l ing pensions and clearing a large part o f the arrears. However, benefit programs rema in

consolidate i t s programs i n t o a single cash pove r ty bene f i t targeted at the poorest in order t o 
max im ize the impac t o f social transfers. In pensions, the Government has recognized the 
need to develop a pension system that i s bo th affordable and able t o protect the elderly against 
poverty and a comprehensive pension r e f o rm strategy i s be ing planned. Through the P R S O

approximately US$17 m i l l i o n through the MDF over the CPS period. IDA has also agreed t o 
help M C C supervise significant fo r thcom ing funding o f mun ic ipa l infrastructure through the

e. Improving Efficiency in Public Services 

63. 
To support achievement of the above objectives, the CPS w i l l help bu i ld capacity fo r 
efJicient and accountable pub l ic services. The EDPRP and i t s Annua l Progress Repo r t no ted 
many weaknesses in Georgia’s pub l ic sector management and the Government has i d e n t i f i e d 
p r i o r i t y areas t o enhance pub l ic sector accountability and e f f ic iency that are consistent w i t h 
B a n k analyses in the PER, CPAR , and C F A A . The m a i n goal supported b y the CPS i s to 
promote good, clean economic management, policy, and investment and thereby enable the 
pub l ic sector t o e f fec t ive ly support economic growth, employment generation, and de l ive ry o f 
social services. K e y intermediate steps towa rd this end are: (i) ins t i tu t iona l iz ing the anti- 
co r rup t ion e f f o r t t o ensure i t s sustainability; (ii) im p r o v i n g pub l ic budgeting and expenditure 
management; (iii) strengthening procurement and f inanc ia l management; ( iv ) enhancing 
intergovernmental fiscal relations; and (v) 
im p r o v i n g management, organization, and 
mo t iva t ion in the c i v i l service t o bo th enhance the de l ive ry o f pub l ic services and reduce the 
incentives f o r b r ibe ry and corruption. Each IDA project contains capac i ty -bu i ld ing elements 
that are re in fo rced through AAA and p o l i c y dialogue. O f the on-going po r t fo l io , 
approximately $25 m i l l i o n i s earmarked f o r capac i ty -bu i ld ing across the pub l ic sector. 

Add ress ing governance and co r rup t ion issues 

64. 
All aspects of 
the CPS support fo r improved eflciency i n p u b l i c services address 
co r rup t ion and govemance issues. A June 30, 2005, Presidential Decree o n the Na t iona l 
An t i -Co r rup t ion Strategy de f ines the Government’s anti-corruption agenda. To consolidate 
the anti-corruption efforts in ind iv idua l m in is t r ies , the Government has created the A n t i - 
c o r r u p t i o n Po l icy Coordination Department (ACPCD ) . While the on -go ing an t i -co r rup t ion 
effort continues t o receive h igh - leve l comm i tmen t and i s progressing w i t h significant 
momentum, the present challenge i s to ins t i tu t iona l ize the e f fo r t t o ensure i t s sustainability 
and effectiveness in preventing co r rup t ion in the future. The CPS w i l l f u l l y support the 
Government’s program through the proposed sequence o f P R S O s and the P S R S P as w e l l as 

P rog r amm a t i c Pub l i c E x p e n d i t u r e Rev iews (PPERs); CPAR and C F A A updates in a 
Pub l i c F in an c i a l M a n a g em e n t P e r fo rm an c e R epo r t ; and inc lus ion o f govemance and 

transparency issues in each lend ing operation. A k e y goal i s to ensure the an t i -co r rup t ion 
program’s resilience to a changing p o l i t i c a l environment. 
T o this end, along w i t h 
strengthening country f iduc ia ry systems as described be low , the CPS w i l l help strengthen k e y 
anti-corruption institutions. The Chamber o f Con t ro l (CoC) w i l l be converted i n t o a supreme 

29 

investments ra the r than TA. An agreement was recently reached w i t h Russia t o remove the 
rema in ing t w o m i l i t a r y bases f r om Georgia by 2008. Russia’s ro le w i t h Abkhaz ia and South 
Ossetia, as w e l l as i t s ro le as a ma jo r energy supplier and significant t rad ing partner f o r 
Georgia, r em a i n p ivo ta l f o r future development o f the region.

Efforts t o coordinate external assistance w i t h the Govemment ’s p r i o r i t y investment 

areas a re being strengthened. Regular donor meetings facilitate coo rd ina t ion and alignment 
w i t h the Government’s strategic priorities. The Bank, together w i t h UNDP, coordinates the 
D o n o r F ramewo rk Group, wh ich aims t o ensure coordinated development assistance and 
includes the IMF, EU, U S , UK, France, Sweden, Netherlands, and Germany. Annex V I I I 
illustrates the m a i n areas o f engagement o f each donor. The Government has iden t i f ied 
transport, power, health, education, social p ro tec t ion as p r i o r i t y areas f o r inves t ing i t s ow n 
resources. Areas o f IDA funding are p o l i c y support; ru ra l development; transport; power; 
education; health; environment; mun ic ipa l development; and commun i ty development. The 
U S (through U S A I D and M C C ) i s the largest b i la te ra l donor and plans large disbursements in 
agriculture, energy, transport, the social sectors and mun ic ipa l development. EBRD i s 
tripling i t s activities in the Caucasus and w i l l p rov ide significant support f o r f inanc ia l sector 
and S M E development, where ID A does n o t have direct engagement. IDA w i l l collaborate 
w i t h M C C , KfW, K uw a i t Fund, and EBRD in the roads sector. 
In energy, the close 
partnerships o f the past w i l l be sustained, pa r t icu la r ly w i t h USAID and KfW. Japan has also 
financed s ign i f ican t infrastructure investment and ID A w i l l ensure close collaboration. 

Bank G roup activities w i l l leverage f inanc ia l assistance and complement programs of 

78. 
other extemal partners. The proposed PSRSP w i l l catalyze tw ice as m a n y funds f r om other 
donors t o support c i v i l service reform, budget planning, accounting and transparency in f isca l 
management. ID A and M C C have agreed t o an innova t ive arrangement whereby the B a n k 
w i l l assist in supervising M C C f inanc ing o f mun ic ipa l infrastructure th rough the reg iona l 
infrastructure development fac i l i ty , t o be imp lemen ted in collaboration w i th the MDF. M C C 
i s also expected t o finance rehab i l i ta t ion o f the No r th -Sou th gas pipeline, where IDA w o u l d 
arrange f o r Carbon Fac i l i ty financing. 
Fo r thcom ing I D A assistance t o imp rove the 
environment f o r agro-processing aims t o stimulate the demand fo r ag r icu l tu ra l products thus 
complementing activities addressing supply-side constraints t o ag r icu l tu ra l production, 
inc lud ing those o f USAID, EU, EBRD, Japan, and IFAD. IDA w i l l also build o n p r i o r w o r k 
funded by Canada in the health sector, trade po l icy , and pub l ic adm in is t ra t ion re fo rm . 

The IMF plays a leading ro le in helping improve macroeconomic stability and f isca l 

7 9 . 
management. A three-year Pove r ty Reduc t ion and G r ow t h Fac i l i ty was approved in June 
2004 and the second rev iew was completed in Ju ly 2005. The IMF p rog ram focuses on 
imp rov ing revenue collections and expenditure rationalization, strengthening monetary and 
financial sector performance, im p r o v i n g governance and the business climate, and p romo t ing 
trade liberalization. TA has been p rov ided t o the Ministry o f Finance, NBG, SDS , and the 
Tax Inspectorate o f Georgia. The IMF collaborates closely w i t h NJ3G in the design and 
implementation o f a monetary p rog ram a imed at rebu i ld ing in te rna t iona l reserves, keeping 
in f la t ion l ow , and remonetizing the economy. The IMF’s focus o n p ruden t f isca l p o l i c y has 
served as an important f ramewo rk f o r IDA ’S w o r k o n pub l ic expenditure management. The 
IMF i s also tak ing the lead in tax p o l i c y and tax and customs adm in is t ra t ion re fo rm . In the 
energy sector, the IMF has been p rov id ing advice o n reduc ing quasi-fiscal losses, pa r t icu la r ly

COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY 

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

I n November 2003, Geo rg ia underwent the “Rose Revo lu t ion ” , a peacefil up r is ing 
that was spurred by years of rampant co r rup t ion and a fa i l ing state. I n its f i r s t 18 months i n 
o f ice , the new Govemment has focused on uprooting co r rup t ion , stabilizing the economy, 
and b r ing ing o rde r to f isca l management. The Govemment has also in i t ia ted sweeping 
reforms i n the education system, reduced red tape fo r businesses, and begun t o address long- 
standing issues i n the energy sector. 

Bu i ld ing on these accomplishments, the Govemment is now entering a second phase 
of reforms, focusing on deeper institutional change, enhanced social protection, and essential 
infrastructure needed t o enable economic g row th , j o b creation, and a reduction in poverty. 
W i t h the recent Progress Report on the Economic Development and Poverty Reduction 
P rog ram (EDPRP ) , the Govemment has rea f i rmed 
its commitment to imp rov ing : ( i ) 
governance; ( i i ) macroeconomic policies, pa r t icu la r ly in the f isca l area; ( i i i ) the business 
environment; ( i v ) human development; ( v ) the safety net; ( v i ) p r i o r i t y sectors of the economy - 
energy, transport, communications, tourism, ag r icu l tu re ; and ( v i i ) environmental p ro tec t ion . 

The new Wo r ld Bank G roup Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) fo r FY06-09 is 
designed to assist Geo rg ia implement this second phase of reforms. The CPS builds on the 
EDPRP , as w e l l as emerging Govemment strategic th ink ing on the development framework. 
I n do ing so, i t targets several goals: 

e Generating growth and job creation by 

removing ba r r ie rs t o p r iva te sector 
development and improving infrastructure, f inance and markets. 

a Enhancing human development and social protection through improved education, 

health, social protection, and community services 

0 Strengthening public sector management and budgetary processes 

Geo rg ia t o better p lan and meet its own development goals. 

t o enable 

A key component of the CPS w i l l be a series of Poverty Reduction Support Operations, 
complemented by a Pub l ic Sector Reform Support P rog ram (PSRSP). These operations w i l l 
engage in c r i t ica l reform issues, i n a manner tha t matches improvements i n Govemment 
capacity. The Bank G roup w i l l also support new investments i n infrastructure, pa r t icu la r ly in 
transport and energy. These activities a im t o improve the environment f o r p r iva te investment, 
strengthen Geo rg ia ’s ro le as a t rans i t economy, and help unify Geo rg ia ’s regions. The Bank 
w i l l also stay engaged in education by f inanc ing a fo l low -on education p ro jec t and w i l l 
c o n s i d e r f i r t h e r investment in the health sector should the I D A envelope a l low . The Bank 
w i l l also explore the potential fo r an export-oriented I B R D enclave p ro jec t in the energy 
sector. These goals are also supported by 18 ongoing operations in a range of sectors. 

V 

IFC w i l l complement the IDA p rog ram by continuing to p rov ide investments and technical 
assistance (TA ) t o f inanc ia l institutions in order to deepen the f inanc ia l sector and expand the 
range of and access t o f inanc ia l products. I F C w i l l also consider d i rec t investments i n a g r i - 
business; tou r ism and related sectors; transport; logistics; re ta i l services; p r iva te companies 
engaged in infrastructure and the p rov is ion of social services; and companies engaged in 
manufacturing o r developing na tu ra l resources for export markets. I F C T A w i l l a im t o help 
reduce ba r r ie rs t o business. M I G A is presently discussing p rov is ion of po l i t ica l risk 
guarantees and TA on investment promotion. 

The CPS w i l l seek to both catalyze and complement efsorts of other donors. The 
proposed PSRSP, fo r example, w i l l catalyze twice as many funds f rom other donors, and IDA 
support fo r the t rans i t co r r ido r w i l l help a t t rac t both donor and p r iva te sector f inanc ing . I D A 
and the US M i l lenn ium Challenge Co rpo ra t ion (MCC ) have agreed t o an innovative 
arrangement whereby IDA w i l l assist in the supervision of M C C f inanc ing of municipal 
infrastructure t o be implemented in co l labo ra t ion w i t h the Mun ic ipa l Development Fund 
(MDF). A proposed Carbon Fund operation w i l l also complement M C C f inanc ing of v i ta l 
repa i r of a ma jo r gas pipeline. 

The FY06 envelope f o r new I D A fund ing w i l l be SDR 22.6 m i l l i o n (approximately 
US$33 m i l l ion ) , of wh ich about US$15 m i l l i o n w i l l be available as grants. The indicated 
level of 
I D A f inanc ing over the f o u r year CPS pe r iod is US$143 m i l l ion . However, actual 
allocations w i l l be established annually by the IDA pe$ormance-based a l loca t ion fo rmu la . If 
add i t iona l fund ing becomes ava i lab le due t o improved pe$ormance, the size of activities may 
be increased and possible projects in health o r other infrastructure areas w i l l be considered. 

While Geo rg ia ’s debt situation is imp rov ing , i t s t i l l faces a moderate risk of worsening 
that w i l l likely preclude normal I B R D lending du r ing this CPS pe r iod . Geo rg ia ’s debt burden 
is s t i l l vulnerable to adverse extemal and domestic developments that can be mitigated by 
continued implementation of measures to increase fo re ign d i rec t investment and enhance 
export pe$ormance. Throughout the CPS pe r iod , I D A w i l l w o r k closely w i t h the Govemment 
t o strengthen Geo rg ia ’s eventual creditworthiness for non-concessional bo r row ing . 

I D A w i l l closely mon i to r conditions tha t could undermine achievement of CPS 
objectives. These include: ( i ) a potential weakening of the po l i t ica l w i l l to overcome vested 
interests; ( i i ) inadequate progress on strengthening expenditure management and reducing 
f iduc ia ry risks; ( i i i ) an exacerbation of c i v i l con f l ic t ; ( i v ) extemal shocks on a relatively 
undiversified economy; and ( v ) na tu ra l disasters. The IDA p rog ram w i l l help mitigate these 
risks by supporting efsorts t o eliminate co r rup t ion ; improve expenditure management and 
f iduc ia ry controls; enhance regional development; broaden the sources of g row th ; and 
mitigate potential damage f rom na tu ra l disasters. 

~~ Executive D i rec to rs may w ish to consider the fo l low ing questions: 

Does the CPS p rov ide a we l l focused and balanced se t of activities, both ongoing and 
new, in support of Geo rg ia ’s development strategy, given the IDA envelope? 

Does the CPS establish a good foundation f o r pa r tne rsh ip w i t h the Govemment, c iv i l 
society, and other donors?

11. COUNTRY CONTEXT 

a. Background 

3. 
The Rose Revolution was a defining moment fo r Georgia. F o l l o w i n g independence in 
1991, the Gove rnmen t unde r President Shevardnadze (1992-2003) imp lemen ted a range o f 
p o l i t i c a l a n d econom ic re fo rms t o advance the t rans i t ion t ow a r d democ racy and a ma rke t 
economy . H ow e v e r , by the ea r ly 2000s, p ow e r had f ragmen ted among compe t ing groups; 
l a w a n d o rde r h a d deteriorated; co r rup t ion was widespread; public salaries, pensions, a n d 
soc ia l transfers we re in arrears; and the p o l i t i c a l w i l l f o r re fo rms h a d slackened. These fac to rs 
l e d to growing p u b l i c d issa t is fac t ion tha t cu lm ina ted in the Rose R e v o l u t i o n and res igna t ion 
o f P res iden t Shevardnadze in N o v em b e r 2003. In January 2004, President Saakashv i l i w o n a 
f ive -yea r t e rm w i th 9 6 percent o f the vote, in elections tha t we re cons ide red l a r g e l y f ree and 
fa i r by observers. T h e a f te rma th o f the Rose R e v o l u t i o n has been a t im e o f hope f o r Georgia. 
T h e i n c o m i n g Gove rnmen t comp r ised a g roup o f young re fo rme rs w h o q u i c k l y emba rked o n 
an amb i t ious p r o g r am t o s tab i l ize the economy, cu rb co r rup t ion , and advance soc ia l and 
econom ic re fo rms . T h e u n t im e l y death o f P r im e M i n i s t e r Zhvania, w h o was a m a j o r d r i v e r o f 
the r e f o r m e f fo r t , in Feb rua ry 2005, was a severe setback. Nonetheless, the Gove rnmen t 's 
c omm i tm e n t to r a p i d t rans fo rma t ion o f Geo rg ian society rema ins strong. 

4. 

Geo rg ia emerged f rom Soviet ru le as a fractured na t ion and the challenging process 
of na t ion -bu i ld ing has ye t t o be completed. Sho r t ly after independence, a rm e d c o n f l i c t b r o k e 
o u t as the A b k h a z i a and Sou th Ossetia reg ions sought independence f r o m Georgia. T h e 
con f l ic ts 
t o o k the i r to l l , w i t h some 300,000 peop le displaced, m u c h phys ica l cap i ta l 
destroyed, important trade routes disrupted, the n ew state's au tho r i ty unde rm ined in la rge 
segments o f the coun t ry , and an increased pe rcep t ion o f i n s t a b i l i t y and risk associated w i t h 
Georgia. Since the Rose Revo lu t ion , e f fo r ts have accelerated t o engage in peace talks, 
a l though t o date, the disputes ove r b o t h A b k h a z i a and Sou th Ossetia r em a i n unresolved. The 
p ro t rac ted c o n f l i c t in Chechnya has also weakened Georgia 's c o n t r o l o f the Pank is i Go rge 
area, whe re smuggling, e x t o r t i o n and k i d n a p p i n g have taken p lace in the past. In the A d j a r a 
reg ion , an econom ica l ly s ign i f ican t area b o r d e r i n g T u r k e y and the B l a c k Sea, an autocratic 
and co r rup t l o c a l leader, w h o was at odds w i th the cen t ra l Gove rnmen t , gove rned f o r m a n y 
years. In the spring o f 2004, the Gove rnmen t managed t o e f fec t a peace fu l change in r e g im e 
and the A d j a r a r e g i o n has since been fu l ly reintegrated. At present, app rox ima te ly 2 0 pe rcen t 
o f the coun t ry rema ins outside the Gove rnmen t 's con t ro l . 

5. 
Moreover, overcoming the legacy of 70 years of communist ru le and na tu ra l 
challenges remain formidable tasks. Behav io rs entrenched during the years o f c omm u n i sm 
have p r o v e n d i f f i c u l t t o change. T h e business cu l tu re tha t arose, f o r example, i n v o l v e d 
m i n i m i z i n g v i s i b i l i t y t o the Gove rnmen t ; i g n o r i n g f o rm a l ru les ; and ope ra t ing o n the basis o f 
p e r s o n a l connections. A deep p u b l i c distrust o f state ins t i tu t ions also developed. W idesp read 
tax evasion, a substantial i n f o r m a l economy, a n d c o r r u p t i o n resu l ted in ve ry l o w p u b l i c 
revenue co l lec t ion tha t has been a m a j o r cons t ra in t t o p u b l i c inves tmen t since independence. 
S t rong vested interests in the status q u o have p r o v e d a s ign i f ican t obstacle t o change. R u g g e d 
te r ra in in m a n y parts o f the c o u n t r y has also made p r o v i s i o n and maintenance o f soc ia l and 
econom ic in f ras t ruc tu re d i f f i c u l t and cos t ly . Mo reove r , Geo rg ia has been pa r t icu la r ly 
vu lne rab le t o na tu ra l disasters, such as the 2002 earthquake; p e r i o d i c droughts; and the severe 

2 

f loods in 2005, wh ich caused large-scale damage to waterworks, hous ing and public 
infrastructure across the country. 

The Government now faces the challenge of sustaining the reform momentum and 

6. 
de l ive r ing results. Since com ing i n t o office, the r u l i n g coa l i t ion has h e l d a large ma jo r i ty in 
Parliament and continues to enjoy broad-based support in the country. Howeve r , wh i le recent 
pub l ic op in ion po l ls con f i rm continued pub l ic support, they also reveal a popu la t ion restive 
f o r change and f o r tangible improvements in the economy and employment generation. 
Georgians are eager t o see results in im p r o v i n g the deplorable cond i t ion o f infrastructure - 
roads, electricity, and water. They also want peaceful progress in reso lv ing the con f l ic t w i t h 
the breakaway provinces o f Abkhaz ia and South Ossetia. The Government i s therefore under 
increasing pressure to move as q u i c k l y as possible on a broad range o f r e f o rm issues . 

6. Economic Developments 

G D P fe l l sharply after independence but has since recovered and sustained g row th 

7. 
has been seen since 2001. F o l l ow i n g independence, the loss o f planned p roduc t ion t o Soviet 
markets, the end o f large budget transfers f r om Moscow, and the impac t o f c i v i l war a l l 
resulted in a 70 percent drop in output. A stabilization and structural r e f o rm p rog ram aimed 
at s t imu la t ing market-driven, p r iva te sector p roduc t ion led to a rebound in GDP in the mid- 
1990s, although further shocks f r om the 1998 Russia crisis and severe droughts in 1998 and 
2000 caused GDP g row th to slow between 1998-2000. In 2001 strong g r ow t h resumed once 
again, w i t h the o i l transit industry, communications, financial services, and trade d r iv ing 
average annual GDP g row th t o 6.8 percent between 2001-04.’ Ag r icu l tu re , manufacturing, 
and tourism, however, Georgia’s ma jo r sources o f exports and employment in the Soviet 
period, have made o n l y modest recoveries (see F igu re 1). 

At present, ag r icu l tu re remains the largest sector of the economy. While agriculture 

8. 
dropped f r om 30 percent o f GDP in 1996 t o 16 percent in 2004, i t remains the largest sector 
o f the economy and accounts f o r 52 percent o f employment. Trade i s the second largest 
sector, accounting f o r 13 percent o f GDP and 11 percent o f employment, w h i l e manufacturing 
accounts fo r 9 percent o f GDP and 5 percent o f employment. T w o o f the fastest g row ing 
sectors have been transport and communications, wh ich together tripled f r o m 4.6 percent o f 
GDP in 1996 to 14 percent in 2004. The m a i n exports in recen t years have been i r o n and s tee l 
scrap, aircraft, wine, and ferroalloys.2 A significant “shadow economy” also exists, 
accounting fo r one third o f to ta l output, according t o some estimates. P r iva te remittances, 
equivalent to more that 25 percent o f exports during 2000-2004, also p l a y a s ign i f ican t ro le in 
the economy. Economic activities are concentrated around Tbilisi and the capital city’s 
population has risen to over 1.5 m i l l i o n people (33 percent o f the na t iona l population).

Fiscal Stance. The Govemment has taken p romp t ac t ion to address the underlying

Debt sustainability. Geo rg ia ’s extemal debt pos i t ion has improved since 2004, but 
i t s t i l l faces a moderate risk of worsening. In early 2004, the stock o f to ta l external debt was 
equivalent to 49 percent o f GDP and p r inc ipa l arrears along w i t h debt service due in 2004 was 
equivalent to almost h a l f the country’s gross reserves. 
In Ju ly 2004, an agreement was 
reached w i t h the Paris Club, wh ich rescheduled payments due t o Paris C l u b  creditor^.^ The 
debt service to exports ra t io declined to 18 percent and w i t h robust g row th and restrained n e t 
bo r row ing , the external debt stock also decreased t o 37 percent o f GDP at the end o f 2004. 
However, s tress tests indicate that Georgia’s debt burden i s vulnerable t o a deterioration in the 
external current account deficit; the volume and t e rm s o f future capital f lows ; and a negative 
export g row th shock. These r i s k s can be m i t iga ted b y continued imp lemen ta t ion o f measures 
t o imp rove the business environment to encourage fo re ign direct investment and strengthen 
export performance. Unde r the baseline scenario o f the debt sustainability analysis, external 
debt service i s projected to decline to about 6-7 percent o f exports in 2008. G i v e n the much 
stronger revenue performance, the Government’s l i q u i d i t y pos i t ion should also imp rove 
rap id ly , w i t h the ra t io o f debt service payments t o to ta l government revenues f a l l i n g f r om 
about 17 percent in 2004 to l e s s than 7 percent in 2008. A detailed debt sustainability 
analysis i s p rov ided in Annex V.

Since early 2004, an aggressive w a r against co r rup t ion has been underway. P r io r to 
the Rose Revolution, Georgia regu la r ly ranked as one o f the most co r rup t countries in the 
wo r ld . Surveys and studies revealed that co r rup t ion wasted pub l ic resources, reduced pub l ic 
-revenues, undermined pub l ic investment, in te r fe red w i t h the de l ive ry o f pub l ic social services, 
acted as an additional tax on commercial ac t iv i ty , distorted market signals, and undermined 

T h e rescheduling was structured on Houston te rms . O f f ic ia l Development Loans (ODA) w i l l be repaid over 20 years, 
including 10 years grace at concessional t e rm s . Guaranteed commercial credits and 50 percent o f a r rea rs w i l l be repaid over 
20 years with 5 years grace at in te res t rates to be s e t no higher than in previous bilateral agreements. T h e remaining a r rea rs 
w i l l be repaid over th ree years starting December 2004.

111. GEORGIA’S POVERTY REDUCTION STRATEGY 

a. Key Elements of the EDPRP 

33. 
The Ju ly 2003 Economic Development and Poverty Reduction P rog ram (EDPRP ) 
presented a comprehensive strategy fo r poverty reduction in Georgia. EDPRP preparation 
took three years and invo lved extensive consultations w i t h Georgian c i v i l society, NGOs, and 
the in te rna t iona l donor community. The EDPRP’s tw o main goals are: (i) r a p i d and 
sustainable economic development, w i t h a target o f 5-8 percent GDP g row th a year; and (ii) 
reduced extreme poverty, w i t h a target decline f r om 14 percent to 4-5 percent by 2015, and a 
reduction in ove ra l l poverty, f r om 52 percent t o 20-25 percent b y 2015. T o meet these goals, 
the EDPRP p r io r i t ized imp rov ing : (i) governance; (ii) macroeconomic policies, pa r t icu la r ly in 
the fiscal area; (iii) the business environment; ( iv ) human capital; (v) the safety net f o r the 
poor; (v i ) p r i o r i t y sectors o f the economy - energy, transport, communications, tou r ism and 
agriculture; and (v i i ) protection o f the natural environment. The elevation o f governance as 
the country’s highest p r io r i ty objective was a direct resu l t o f the extensive consultations w i t h 
representatives o f c i v i l society. The EDPRP i s w e l l aligned w i t h the MDGs and i t s t ime - 
span, goals, and objectives are concurrent w i t h MDG targets. The cu r ren t Government has 
asserted i t s commitment t o the Millenium Declaration and a Governmental Comm iss ion o n 
Realization o f MDGs was reconstituted after the Rose Revolution. Country-specific targets 
adjust the international targets to re f lec t conditions in Georgia and add a target on socio- 
economic rehab i l i ta t ion o f people displaced by con f l ic ts and natural calamities. 

34. 
The EDPRP remains the foundation of 
the cu r ren t Govemment’s poverty reduction 
strategy. In the EDPRP Progress report o f M a r c h 2005, the current Government rea f f i rmed 
i t s comm i tmen t t o implementing the EDPRP. The Joint Staff Adv iso ry N o t e (JSAN) 
concluded that progress in implementing the strategy over the past year had been successful, 
due in large part to the impressive imp rovemen t in pub l ic finances. The Government had 
acted b o l d l y t o tackle corruption, in keep ing w i t h i t s in ten t ion to consolidate democracy and 
imp rove the business climate. As the Government strengthens the strategic focus and 
implementation o f the EDPRP, there are fou r challenges: (i) the links between the strategy 
and annual Government budgets need t o be strengthened b y developing a MTEF aligned w i t h 
the strategy and b y ensuring that the M i n i s t r y o f Finance has a key ro le in implementing and 
further developing the strategy (a concern also no ted in the o r ig ina l JSAN); (ii) areas that 
need strengthening include ensuring re l iab le e lec t r ic i ty supply to a l l regions, transparent and 
fair privatization, adequate resources f o r health and education; and r a p i d progress w i t h a 
targeted social safety net; and ( iv ) governance and pub l ic service de l ive ry need t o be 
imp roved along w i t h further empowerment o f c i v i l society.

The outcome of Bank G roup assistance to Geo rg ia since 1997 was moderately

Over the forthcoming CPS pe r iod , P IUs w i l l be g radua l ly integrated in to l ine 
ministries. The Government has decided to mo re fu l ly integrate ex is t ing PIUs i n t o l i n e 
ministries, so that Ministry staff take over respons ib i l i ty f o r day-to-day project management. 
PIUs were established under the former Government f o r mos t IDA projects in response t o 
lack of capacity in l i n e m in is t r ies and poo r governance i s s u e s . They emerged as autonomous 
~ bodies w i t h h igh ly qua l i f ied and w e l l p a i d staff and p roved effective in imp lemen t ing 
projects, but to some extent undermined Government ownership o f the projects they 
supported. With changes n ow underway to imp rove capacity and salaries in the c i v i l service, 
the rationale fo r ma in ta in ing autonomous bodies f o r p ro jec t implementation i s no t as strong. 
IDA and the Government have agreed to rev iew p ro jec t imp lemen ta t ion arrangements o n a 
case-by-case basis. Each m in is t ry w i l l w o r k w i t h relevant p ro jec t teams to determine what 
changes are needed to make l i n e m i n i s t r i e s d i rec t ly responsible for project imp lemen ta t ion 

17 

and develop an action p lan that allows changes t o be implemented over t ime w i thou t undue 
disruptions t o project activities. The P IU integration process w i l l be closely mon i to red to 
ensure that k e y staff are retained and that f inanc ia l management and procurement 
arrangements are f u l l y satisfactory. The move towards P IU integration w i l l be coordinated 
w i t h other donors to ensure consistency and greater a id harmonization o f procedures. These 
efforts w i l l complement w o r k on expenditure management, transparency, and budgeting t o 
strengthen coun t ry systems and enhance Georgia’s capacity t o absorb and p rope r ly u t i l i z e the 
increased a i d flows, p r iva t iza t ion receipts, and fiscal revenues that are expected in the future.

40. 

Geo rg ia ’s present challenge is t o broaden the sources of g row th and enhance 
investment in the social sectors in o rde r t o reduce poverty and a t ta in the MDGs. As ind ica ted 
above, Georgia’s recent g row th has been concentrated in a small number o f sectors that have 
had limited impact on employment. Moreover, the Government’s poo r revenue performance 
undermined social protection and investments in health and education. These factors 
combined t o inhibit poverty reduction and adequate progress towa rd the MDGs. Meanwh i le , 
Georgia’s significant economic development po ten t ia l o f fe red b y agriculture, agro- 
processing, transit-economy activities, small-scale manufacturing, and tou r ism remains 
largely untapped. Ru ra l poverty, moreover, has r i s e n disproportionately and access to basic 
social and economic services outside Tbilisi remains limited. 

41. 

To help enhance Geo rg ia ’s prospects f o r poverty reduction and attainment of MDGs, 
-the overarching objectives of the FY06-09 CPS are:

exploitation of the transport co r r ido r . The poo r state o f the h ighway ne two rk constrains the 
movement o f goods and people between Georgia’s cities, ports, and rural areas; and through 
Georgia, along the transit corridor. As previously discussed, large segments o f the popu la t ion 
are e f fec t ive ly l e f t out o f the economy due t o limited connec t iv i ty t o ma jo r urban centers and 
transport facilities. L e s s than f i v e percent o f the road ne two rk supports the transit economy 
and fo re ign trade, and many segments require rehabilitation. The l o n g transit times, despite 
the re la t ive ly short distance and poor road conditions add t o transport costs and deter usage o f 
the Georgian transit route. In i t s present state, limited capacity o n the h ighway ne two rk i s a

The IDA a l loca t ion fo r FY06 is SDR22.6 m i l l i o n (about US$33 m i l l i o n ) of wh ich 
about US$I5 m i l l ion is grants. 
An ind ica t ive base leve l o f US$143 m i l l i o n over the fou r 

33 

years o f the CPS i s provided, based o n extrapolations f r om current levels. However, actual 
allocations f o r FY07-08 w i l l be decided each year based on the I D A - 1 4 performance-based 
a l loca t ion system. FY09 allocations w i l l be determined b y the fo rmu la t o be adopted under 
the nex t IDA replenishment. In FY06, the leve l o f Georgia’s debt allows i t t o ob ta in s l igh t ly 
less than h a l f i t s allocation as grants. However, Georgia’s debt situation i s im p r o v i n g and 
therefore i t w i l l l i k e l y move f r om a m i x e d g ran tk red i t recipient t o a c red i t -on ly bo r rowe r 
after the f i r s t o r second year o f the CPS. A l though Georgia’s current creditworthiness 
considerations may preclude no rma l IBRD bo r row ing fo r the CPS period, the Bank w i l l 
explore the potential fo r IBRD enclave f inanc ing in an export oriented energy sector project. 
The p ro jec t w o u l d have the special characteristics o f enclave financing, inc lud ing , (a) exports 
that generate sufficient fo re ign exchange to service the loan, (b) additional guarantees f r om 
c red i two r thy en t i t ies , and (c) creation o f f inanc ia l structures such as offshore escrow accounts 
to secure IBRD debt service payments. The op t ion o f guarantees w o u l d also be considered. 
Th rough the PRSO program and AAA support, a close dialogue w i l l also be maintained on 
issues that imp rove Georgia’s eventual e l i g i b i l i t y f o r non-concessional bo r row ing .

74. 
Geo rg ia ’s po l icy and ins t i tu t iona l environment (as evidenced th rough its C P I A ra t ing ) 
has improved dramatically since 2003 and as a result, IDA a l loca t ions a lso increased. 
However, the IDA allocation fo rmu la also takes i n t o consideration the health o f the IDA 
po r t fo l io . When the project p o r t f o l i o ratings were reported in 2004, Geo rg ia s t i l l had three 
projects in unsatisfactory or at risk status. This was largely related t o the t im e needed f o r the 
new authorities to become fam i l ia r w i t h the p o r t f o l i o and in some cases, t o a shift in project 
emphasis t o better reflect emerging p r io r i t ies . Since that time a l l projects have reverted t o 
satisfactory status. Subject t o continued improvements 
in the C P I A and p o r t f o l i o 
performance, IDA allocations cou ld increase further. Depending on the amount o f increase, 
additional funding cou ld be directed t o the T rans i t Co r r ido r projects, and/or a f o l l ow - o n 
Hea l th Project. O n the downside, deterioration in CP IA ratings w o u l d signal economic o r 
governance d i f f icu l t ies and w o u l d lead t o a l ow e r allocation. At lowe r levels, the PRSO 
program and size o f the Transit Co r r ido r projects w i l l be reconsidered. 
The ma in 
performance criteria affecting IDA allocations are l i s t e d in Table 7.

IDA f i n a n c i n g w i l l be guided by the new Country F inanc ing Parameters (CFPs ) fo r 
Geo rg ia . The CFPs, wh ich were recently established in consultation w i t h the Government, 

34 

p rov ide f o r added f lex ib i l i ty in a l low ing I D A financing o f up to 100 percent and recurrent 
cost f inanc ing on a selective basis; IDA f inanc ing o f loca l and fo re ign costs in any proportion; 
and IDA f inanc ing o f loca l taxes and duties. The additional f l e x i b i l i t y i s f u l l y consistent w i t h 
the approach o f the CPS in emphasizing Government ownership o f the unde r ly ing project 
objectives and target results agreed (see Annex VI1 f o r details).

7 6 . Geo rg ia ’s p rom is ing recent perj4ormance has gained strong f i n a n c i a l support f rom the 

in tema t iona l community. The June 2004 donors’ conference in Brussels generated some 
US$1.1 b i l l i o n in a id pledges fo r the pe r iod FY05-07, two - th i rds o f w h i c h are to be grants. In 
addition, the MCC i s p lann ing to grant about US$295 m i l l i o n over the nex t f i v e years fo r 
infrastructure and ru ra l development. A close relationship w i t h the U S has developed, based 
on Georgia’s strategic loca t ion as an o i l and gas conduit as w e l l as i t s pa r t ic ipa t ion in the 
-global war on terror. The U S has p rov ided significant a id to Georgia since 1992, and Georgia 
has regularly ranked among the largest recipients o f U S a id in per capita te rms . Georgia also 
has aspirations o f strengthening i t s in teg ra t ion w i t h N A T O and the EU. At present the EU 
and Georgia are developing an A c t i o n P lan under the European Ne ighbo rhood Po l icy 
framework. This p lan w i l l define a l i s t o f p r i o r i t y actions to be imp lemen ted over a 3-5 year 
pe r iod that w i l l be linked to a p rog ram o f enhanced aid, trade, and p o l i t i c a l ties and i s 
expected t o provide strong incentives f o r p o l i c y r e f o rm as w e l l as focus more EU funds on

In energy, the close

i. Consultations 

80. 

The Bank and I F C held a w ide range of consultations w i t h c i v i l society in the 
development of 
the CPS. These inc luded extensive discussions in M a r c h 2005 around the 
CAS Comp le t ion Report t o gather lessons learned; roundtables in April and M a y t o gather 
early input i n t o the CPS; and a larger roundtable in Ju ly t o discuss l ike ly activities. 
IDA 
supplemented this w i t h an anonymous client survey o f 122 stakeholders in M a y , and the I F C 
and F I A S held a roundtable w i t h p r iva te sector representatives in M a y t o help p r io r i t ize 
efforts t o support the p r iva te sector. Consultations also inc luded a roundtable with “you th 
voices” w h o in turn had held focus groups on B a n k activities w i t h a w ide r range o f 
participants. IDA w i l l continue to w o r k closely w i t h c i v i l society and bus iness organizations 
to imp lemen t the CPS and enhance the prospects o f progress on reforms and ins t i tu t iona l 
development. I D A w i l l also seek to enhance the dialogue between the Government and c i v i l 
society on specific issues , such as education and pension reform. 

8 1. 
C i v i l society groups expressed broad agreement w i t h the p r io r i t ies of the Govemment 
and approach of the CPS. C i v i l society groups consulted b y ID A agreed that the Government 
had made impo r tan t progress o n reducing corruption, o n education and health reform, and o n 
imp rov ing pub l ic sector institutions and budgeting. At the same time, they ind ica ted a desire 
for stronger consultations between Government and c i v i l society. They also po in ted t o 
employment as the number one i s s u e and v iewed improvements in the bus iness c l ima te f o r 
S M E s , as w e l l as labor market f l e x i b i l i t y as keys t o imp rov ing employment opportunities. 
Judicial r e f o rm and agricultural development were seen as tw o further impo r tan t elements. 
Another impo r tan t issue was seen to be decentralization and i t was argued that mo re decision- 
mak ing and fund ing should be entrusted to the regions. Development o f infrastructure (roads, 
energy) was seen as impo r tan t bo th f o r job creation and f o r reg iona l integration. C i v i l society 
representatives were concerned as t o how Govemment and ID A programs w o u l d be 
mon i to red and requested that IDA continue i t s consultations w i t h c i v i l society on the 
mon i to r ing and evaluation o f the CPS. Annex I11 provides further details. 

82. 

The May 2005 Wo r ld Bank Geo rg ia Client Survey indicated that h igh p r i o r i t y areas 
are education, the economy, and the unresolved regional conflicts. W h i l e in the last c l ien t 
survey a ma jo r i ty o f stakeholders reported that the biggest challenge was corruption, this year, 
n o respondent iden t i f ied corruption as the greatest challenge and o n l y 8 percent iden t i f ied i t as 
the second greatest challenge. The B a n k scored w e l l o n treating clients w i t h respect, and in 
collaborating w i t h other donors, but l e s s w e l l on building capacity o f Government o f f ic ia ls o r 
at the loca l level. W h i l e the Bank was seen as responsive t o the pub l ic , respondents 
ove rwhe lm ing ly said that more informatiodawareness i s needed about the B a n k in Georgia. 
One o f the biggest changes in the survey relates t o views o f IDA ’S w o r k in education. 
- Whereas in the last survey feducation’receiyed one o f the lowes t effectiveness ratings, this 
year IDA ’S wo rk in education received the highest effectiveness rating. The B a n k was also 
c i ted as particularly e f fec t ive in mon i to r ing pove r ty and in strengthening the f inanc ia l system. 
Reso lv ing the regional con f l ic ts was also seen as a ma jo r p r io r i ty . While IDA assistance has 
no t d i rec t ly addressed the regional conflicts, i t s assistance in the fo r thcom ing CPS pe r iod in 
developing road and powe r infrastructure aims t o promote regional development and g row th . 
IDA support in education, moreover, pays particular attention t o schools in m i n o r i t y areas and 

37 

areas affected by the conflicts. I D A also stands ready to consider pos t -con f l ic t reconstruction 
grant assistance in the event o f permanent resolution o f the c i v i l conflicts.

a f r a g i l e stage and a dec l ine in m om e n t um due t o p o l i t i c a l exigencies rema ins a risk. 
P u b l i c support has dec l ined f r o m the high leve ls f o l l o w i n g the revo lu t ion , as pos t - 
r e v o l u t i o n rea l i t ies become apparent. With the CPS, the B a n k G r o u p toge the r w i th

The f iduc ia ry risk of the Govemment’s expenditure management framework has been

however, corruption w i l l no t be eradicated overnight. 
In collaboration w i th other 
ma jo r ex te rna l partners, the Bank G roup i s p rov id ing strong support t o consolidate and 
advance the anti-corruption agenda t o help ensure i t s long-term effectiveness and 
res i l ience t o changes 
in the po l i t ica l environment. 
K e y measures 
inc lude 
ins t i tu t iona l iz ing transparent budget procedures; strengthening coun t ry f inanc ia l 
management and procurement systems; enhancing country project imp lemen ta t ion 
capacity through integration o f PIUs i n t o l i n e m in is t r ies ; strengthening k e y ins t i tu t ions 
such as CoC and ACPCD ; p romo t ing the oversight functions o f Parliamentary and 
c i v i l society groups; and imp rov ing remuneration and management in the c i v i l service 
to reduce incentives f o r corruption. 

Geo rg ia could face an exacerbation of c i v i l conflict. 
The poss ib i l i ty o f an 
in tens i f ica t ion o f the c i v i l con f l ic ts has been reduced b y the Government’s 
comm i tmen t to a negotiated se t t lemen t and international efforts t o he lp bring about a 
peaceful resolution. Nevertheless, tensions continue and until a permanent reso lu t ion 
t o the c r is is i s reached, a degree o f uncertainty w i l l exist, w i t h consequent imp l ica t ions 
f o r the welfare o f affected people as w e l l as the investment environment and p r iva te 
sector development. 
Bank G roup invo lvemen t in regional development and 
infrastructure may help t o strengthen the bene f i ts t o cooperation. 

e Geo rg ia cou ld face deterioration in the external environment. Georgia i s in a vo la t i le 
reg ion and subject to external shocks. F o r example, a collapse o f markets in Tu rkey 
and Russia, o r an in te r rup t ion o f o i l , gas, o r powe r supply w o u l d s ign i f ican t ly affect 
Georgia’s medium-term economic prospects. While debt indicators are imp rov ing , 
such shocks, pa r t icu la r ly t o exports, cou ld reverse this trend. K e y objectives o f the 
CPS are t o help broaden sources o f g row th and increase Georgia’s linkages t o 
ne ighbo r ing countries, and thereby d ive rs i fy vu lne rab i l i ty to external shocks. 

e Geo rg ia is pa r t icu la r ly susceptible t o na tu ra l calamities. Georgia has been prone t o 
natural calamities, such as the severe droughts in 1998 and 2000, the 2002 earthquake, 
and the 2005 floods that have set back progress towa rd development goals. ID A i s 
active in he lp ing to manage these in te rna l environmental shocks, inc lud ing , f o r 
example, through f l o o d emergency support t o strengthen levies and embankments in 
order t o reduce damage in the event o f a recurrence o f ma jo r f lood ing .

GEORGIA: 
COUNTRY ASSISTANCE STRATEGY COMPLETION REPORT 

Country: G e o r g i a 

Date o f Last CAS: Sep tembe r 22, 1997 

Period Covered by the CAS Completion Report: FY98-FY05 

CAS Completion Report prepared by: A s i t a D e S i l v a 

Execu t ive S u m m a r y 

The Country Assistance Strategy Completion Report (CASCR) evaluates 
the 
effectiveness of W o r l d Bank assistance t o Geo rg ia between FY98-05. Due t o po l i t ica l 
changes and an extensive PRSP p repa ra t ion process between 2000-2003, the last CAS fo r 
Geo rg ia discussed by the Executive D i rec to rs was in October 1997. 

A formidable a r ray of 
challenges has faced Geo rg ia since 1997, inc lud ing 
consolidating 
the democratic process; 
resolving 
the c i v i l conflicts; ma in ta in ing 
macroeconomic s tab i l i ty ; ra is ing tax revenues and expenditure on the social sectors f rom 
levels below those in much of 
the developing w o r l d ; preventing the disintegration and 
collapse of essential pub l ic infrastructure services pa r t icu la r ly energy; and f u r t h e r bu i ld ing 
institutions, strengthening po l ic ies , and enticing 
the behavioral changes required fo r 
sustainable, market-driven economic g row th . 

The Bank’s ove ra l l goal du r ing the seven-year pe r iod was t o support pe r cap i ta 
income growth, poverty reduction, and improved l iv ing standards. A broad range of 
intermediate objectives were supported towa rd this goa l : ( i ) strengthened f isca l management 
and maintenance of macroeconomic s tab i l i ty ; ( i i ) removal of obstacles to market-oriented, 
p r iva te sector g row th ; ( i i i ) enhancement of human development and a strengthened social 
safety net; 
( i v ) sustainable na tu ra l resource management; and ( v ) improved pub l ic 
administration and govemance. The Bank’s p rog ram was b road between FY98-00, when i t 
approved fourteen projects for US$300 m i l l i o n in a range of sectors. As the govemance 
- situation deteriorated, adjustment lending was suspended and the Bank ’s overall lending 
signiJicantly reduced. E igh t projects f o r US$ l65 m i l l i o n we re approved between FYO l -03 , 
concentrated in the social sectors, r u r a l areas, and th rough autonomous institutions. Since 
the Rose Revolution, Bank lending has comprised a quick-disbursing Reform Support C red i t 
and investments in energy, a secondary and local roads p ro jec t , and a r u r a l development 
p ro jec t

The goa ls supported by the Bank remain highly relevant to poverty reduction and 
improved l i v i n g standards in Georgia. While significant steps were taken towa rd each goa l , 
much remains t o be done before 
they are fu l ly realized, however. Wh i le monetary 
management has been sound, f isca l management has been e r ra t ic , significantly undermining 
p u b l i c investment and service delivery. Pub l ic social service delivery and social transfers 
have been unde r s t ra in due t o low levels of fund ing and persistent ineficiencies. M u c h 
remains 
t o be done t o improve environmental p ro tec t ion and sustainable resource 
management. Wh i le there have been sound recent steps against co r rup t ion , the pervasiveness 
of the p rob lem indicates that sustained progress over time is required. Likewise, w h i l e recent 
progress has been made, much remains to be done t o improve the capacity t o effectively and 
e f ic ien t ly de l ive r p u b l i c services. A range of obstacles continue to impede p r iva te sector 
development, inc lud ing poo r infrastructure, inconsistent implementation of 
the legal and 
regulatory framework, and lack of law and order. Thus, w h i l e Geo rg ia has seen significant 
g row th , i t has been concentrated in the o i l t rans i t sector and not generated significant 
employment and the f u l l development potential of Geo rg ia ’s b road range of na tu ra l resources 
remains unrealized. W i t h only p a r t i a l progress towa rd Geo rg ia ’s intermediate goals, poverty 
has not ye t been reduced 

The outcome of Bank assistance since 1997 is rated as moderately satisfactory. The 
Bank’s objectives were relevant and i t helped achieve some progress towa rd each key 
objective in the very d i f i c u l t govemance environment i n Geo rg ia . I t s operations we re seen 
as “ is lands of effectiveness and pu r i ty ” in a sea of co r rup t ion and waste. Of 
the twelve 
completed projects since 1997, OED rated ten o r 83 percent as satisfactory, compared t o an 
ECA region average of 81 percent satisfactory. Of six I F C projects, OEG rated IFC 
effectiveness satisfactory o r better 83 percent of 
the time. Fifteen projects received Q AG 
quality at entry assessments and a l l were rated satisfactory. Bank projects also had pos i t ive 
sustainable impact, w i t h 92 percent being rated as likely t o sustainable (compared t o a Bank - 
w ide average of 66 percent). 
I t s projects also had substantial institutional development 
impact, w i t h 62 percent being rated as “subs tan t ia l ” , compared t o a 45 percent Bank -w ide 
average du r ing the same pe r iod . 

Since the Rose Revolution, strong govemment commitment to rapidly advancing the 
economic and social reform agenda has yielded pos i t ive results. Wh i le good i n i t i a l progress 
was made under the previous regime, a de te r io ra t ing governance environment in the ea r ly 
2000s undermined po l icy implementation, new institutions, investment projects, and p r iva te 
sector activity. L im i ted capacity and decision-making au tho r i ty a t mid-levels of 
the c i v i l 
service undermined po l icy and p ro jec t implementation. 
I n some areas, there was also 
inadequate po l i t ica l w i l l t o overcome vested interests and incu r short-term costs, despite an 
expressed desire t o pursue reforms. On the p a r t of 
the Bank, i t adopted an app rop r ia te ly 
cautious approach i n the face of a de te r io ra t ing governance environment. I t s projects aimed 
to achieve d i f icu l t po l icy and s t ruc tu ra l reforms and no t j u s t physical investments. The Bank 
t o o k an early lead and was in i t ia l ly the only dono r i n several important areas, such as 
targeting access t o the poorest; u t i l iza t ion of social funds t o reach local communities; 
decentralization; and c i v i l service reform. O n the other hand, the Bank could have spent 
more time raising ownership at the implementing agency level, rather than ove r - re ly ing on 
h igh 
level champions 
to get 
things done; frequent changes 
in T T L s undermined 
implementation; and overly ambitious timeframes we re consistently se t .

Revenue performance 
10. 
After positive early gains, revenue performance stagnated between 1999-2004. L o w 
tax revenues have been a c r i t ica l obstacle t o f isca l sustainability and to increased social and 
infrastructure expenditures and the Bank p laced an emphasis o n helping imp rove revenue 
performance between 1997-2002. Through several operations, inc lud ing SATAC Z, SAC ZZ, 
SATAC ZZ, and SAC ZZZ the Bank helped develop new Tax and Custom codes, operationalize 
A S Y C U D A at the airport and Tbilisi customs terminal, develop anti-smuggling measures, 
computerize the Customs and Tax Adm in is t ra t ion and other agencies, and reorganize the Tax 
Department, inc lud ing creating a Large Taxpayer Unit. These measures contributed t o an 
improvement in tax revenue f r om 10.6 percent o f GDP in 1996 t o 14 percent in 1999. 
However, revenue g row th stagnated between 1999 and 2003 due t o the i n a b i l i t y t o enforce tax 
laws, amendments t o the tax law that created a range o f exemptions, large scale tax evasion, 
corruption, and smuggling. Lack o f g row th in revenues had significant adverse effects, 
including high levels o f payment arrears in health, education, and pensions. F o l l ow i n g the 
Rose Revo lu t ion , the intensive anti-corruption d r ive along w i t h imp roved revenue co l lec t ion 
led to a sharp increase in revenues, to a projected 17.6 percent o f GDP in 2004. This in turn 
has enabled the government to clear the bulk o f domestic wage and pension arrears ahead of 
schedule. Parliament recently passed a tax r e f o rm b i l l aimed at simplifying the tax reg ime 
and e l im ina t ing nuisance taxes. Despite these achievements, Georgia’s tax revenues are s t i l l 
-well be low the transition country average-of 30 percent t o GDP.

P ow e r sector

By the mid-l990s, the power sector was close to collapse. R e f o r m in the p ow e r 
sector has been a m a j o r p r i o r i t y o f B a n k assistance in G e o r g i a since 1997 due t o the sec tor ’s

mid-l990s, the p ow e r sector played a substantially greater mac roeconom ic r o l e than did the 
gove rnmen t budget. U s e o f the p ow e r sector as a soc ia l sa fe ty n e t and mac roeconom ic policy

repression o f e lec t r ic i ty t a r i f f s also enabled the pos tponemen t o f s t ruc tu ra l adjustment in the 
enterprise sector. As such, the p ow e r system was o n the ve rge o f collapse and e l e c t r i c i t y

The Bank Group financed significant investment in the sector. In this context, in

Bank G roup assistance helped prevent a collapse in the power supply, but was not 
ab le t o help establish a sustainable and f inanc ia l ly viable sector. 
I n i t i a l re fo rms inc luded 
establishing an independent regulatory body; unbund l ing and corporatizing powe r generation, 
transmission, and distribution functions; and commencing p r iva t iza t ion o f generation and 
d is t r ibu t ion en t i t ies . In 1998, Telasi, the d is t r ibu t ion company in Tbilisi, was so ld t o A E S 
Corporation, and in 2000, the bulk o f Georgia’s thermal generation capacity was also so ld t o 
AES. I n 1999, a Georgia Wholesale E lec t r ic i ty Ma rke t (GWEM) was created to manage the 
flow o f payments among sector enterprises. F o l l ow i n g considerable i n i t i a l d i f f icu l t ies , 
GWEM i s presently successfully managed b y a private consortium, under a management 
contract achieved w i t h I F C support. 
In 2002, w i t h BanWIFC assistance, the d is t r ibu t ion 
companies outside Tbilisi were consolidated i n t o one company, whose management was 
contracted out in 2003. These measures helped prevent a collapse in the sector and resu l ted in 
some improvements in the re l iab i l i ty and e f f ic iency o f powe r supply. Howeve r , an adequate 
degree o f service and re l iab i l i ty has no t been reached, w i t h con t inu ing powe r outages and the 
system remains financially unviable. L o w collections f r om bo th household and commercial 
consumers continue to y i e l d inadequate funds f l ow i n g t o powe r generators, suppressing 
powe r generation and limiting the ava i lab i l i ty o f funds fo r imports. In 2003, AES so ld i t s 
holdings in Georgia, to RAO UES , a Russian concern, c i t i n g operational d i f f icu l t ies bo th in 
Georgia and overseas and in Ju ly 2004, Georgian State Energosystema (GSE), the 
transmission company sub-borrower under the Bank-funded EMSP filed f o r bankruptcy 
protection. Meanwhile, government subsidies t o consumers escalated in the early 2000s, w i t h 
increasing concerns as to over-coverage and wastage. Since the Rose Revolution, the 
government has se t an ambitious 2 year ho r izon w i t h i n wh ich t o ensure 24-hour coverage and 
financial v i a b i l i t y in the sector and i s developing a strategic action plan. A Debt 
Restructuring Agency (DRA) was created to recover energy sector debts and co l lec t ion rates 
increased f r om an average o f 28 percent in 2003 t o 40 percent in 2004. 

19. 
A range of factors inh ib i ted a better outcome in the powe r sector. Despite the Bank ’s 
significant 
investment, close coo rd ina t ion w i t h other donors, and pos i t ive ins t i tu t iona l 
changes in the sector, poor sector performance continues to have a b road detrimental impac t 
o n the economy. Factors that inhibited a better outcome inc lude p o l i t i c a l pressure in the 
operation o f energy companies t o p rov ide e lec t r ic i ty at any costs; strong vested interests t o 
ma in ta in the s ta tus quo; theft; corruption; po l i t ica l tolerance o f non-payments; lack o f 
incentives on the part o f corporate management t o r e s i s t p o l i t i c a l pressure and vested 
in teres ts ; and weak enforcement o f laws and regulations. At one point, AES reported that 40 
percent o f the electricity i t p rov ided was stolen and cou ld no t be b i l led . The AES Telasi story 
(wh ich i s featured in a documentary film, “Power Trip”) illustrates the m y r i a d d i f f i c u l t i e s in 
turning around a former state-owned u t i l i t y in an environment o f weak p o l i t i c a l w i l l on the 
part o f the government, corruption, and a culture o f non-payment. As government subsidies 
ceased upon privatization, AES essentially had t o bear the burden o f the 5 percent o f GDP

subsidy be ing transferred f r om the energy sector to consumers. In retrospect, re fo rm in the 
sector cou ld be on ly pa r t ly implemented, preventing the benefits o f the d i f f i c u l t process from 
be ing realized. 
I n i t i a l government commitment cou ld no t overcome vested in te res ts and the 
po l i t ica l w i l l t o sus ta in the momen tum dissipated. One lesson was that management contracts 
f o r pub l ic f i r m s can be a moderately effective interim solution until the environment f o r 
p r iva te equ i ty pa r t ic ipa t ion improves. The power sector showed s ign i f ican t progress in 2004- 
05 due la rge ly t o the w o r k o f management contractors. 

Transport 

20. 
The Bank made a useful con t r ibu t ion in the road sector. Transport has been a B a n k 
p r io r i ty in Georgia since 1995. The Transport Rehabilitation P ro jec t (FY96-99) helped 
in i t ia te p o l i c y r e f o rm and ins t i tu t iona l strengthening in the sector. TA under the p ro jec t 
resulted in a 1997 Presidential decree on “The Conception o f Transport Po l icy ” . The p ro jec t 
also introduced competitive bidding and p r iva t iza t ion o f road maintenance and construction 
activities. In railways, the project in i t ia ted restructuring o f Georgian Ra i lways and drafted a 
Ra i lway L aw . The f o l l ow - o n Restructuring of 
the M in is t ry of T ranspo r t Project (FY99-03) 
helped transform the “traditional-style” m in is t ry i n t o a p o l i c y and regulation-making b o d y 
w i t h oversight functions on ly and n o operational o r executing functions. The mo to r transport 
companies were p r iva t ized and regulatory agencies f o r ma r i t ime transport, aviation, mo to r 
transport, and communications were established. The reorganization created a mode l o f 
reform in the midst o f con t inu ing centralized management systems and was subsequently used 
as a mode l in other pub l ic sector reforms. The Roads Project (FY00-06) i s he lp ing imp rove 
the ma in road network, through imp roved allocation o f available road resources among a l l 
roads, and imp roved ins t i tu t iona l capacity fo r ma in ta in ing and mode rn iz ing the road ne two rk . 
A 2002 study on South Caucasus Trade and Transport Fac i l i ta t ion (TTF) was fo l lowed b y a 
TTF Po l icy Note, wh ich was intended t o f o rm the basis f o r a proposed T rade and T rans i t 
Fac i l i ta t ion project. The Secondary and Local Roads Project (FY04 - 10) i s he lp ing address 
transport bottlenecks to ru ra l development. No tw i ths tand ing these contributions, inadequate 
road transportation continues t o be a k e y development constraint in many pa r ts o f Georgia. 
Con t inu ing i s s u e s include im p r o v i n g road administration, including the establishment o f 
regional offices; securing adequate resources in the sector; changing ine f f ic ien t and cos t ly 
Soviet-era design and construction standards; imp rov ing p lann ing and road management 
systems; and i n v o l v i n g more stakeholders in the p lann ing and development process. 

Water supply 

21. 
Bank contributions i n the water sector were l im i ted to small-scale investment 
projects. Lack o f clear government commitment to reforms l e d t o limited B a n k involvement 
in the water sector. The dropped Water and Sanitation P ro jec t (planned f o r FY99 ) had 
-intended t o address ins t i tu t iona l reforms and immediate investment needs in the water sector 
in Tbilisi. A study on strategy, regulation, and p r iva te sector pa r t ic ipa t ion in the water sector 
was financed under PPIAF and KfW i s currently t a h n g this sector further w i t h the 
Government. N o reforms have been implemented to date, however, and water systems 
throughout Georgia have continued t o deteriorate. The B a n k was able t o make a sound 
contribution in generating small investment projects f o r rehab i l i ta t ion and repair o f ex is t ing 
loca l infrastructure in various cities under MDDP I and 11. Some sub-projects under MDDP I,

Bank interventions helped improve wastewater and so l id waste management i n a few 
target locations but d i d not have w ide r impact. Heavy water and air p o l l u t i o n as w e l l as a 
weak so l id waste management system have been detrimental t o the qua l i ty o f l i f e in Georgia, 
w i t h particular imp l ica t ions f o r pub l ic health and ecosystem conservation. Several B a n k 
projects aimed t o help protect the environment. The Mun ic ipa l Infrastructure Rehab i l i ta t ion 
(M IR ) P ro jec t (FY95-00) financed investments t o upgrade mun ic ipa l wastewater and so l id 
waste management systems in Tbilisi, Batumi, and Poti, as w e l l as in a few smaller 
Imp roved loca l sewage collectors and pumping stations helped imp rove 
sanitation and l i v i n g standard f o r several communities. They did not, however, cover waste 
water treatment and therefore did no t have an impac t o n water p o l l u t i o n indicators. Imp roved 
trash co l lec t ion through p rov is ion o f garbage trucks and waste containers and construction o f 
a landfill w a l l in Batumi supported improvements in so l id waste management. Otherwise 
l i t t l e was done to imp rove waste management a t dumping sites, however, and consequently, 
the standards o f l a n d f i l l management imp roved o n l y modestly and the leve l o f sea water 
po l lu t ion , w i t h waste washed f r om coastal land f i l ls , did no t change s ign i f ican t ly . Unde r the

sources o f po l lu t ion was conducted successfully. N o progress was made in im p r o v i n g the 
Tbilisi water supply and sewage management system, however, as the p ro jec t f o r addressing 
Tbilisi water supply and sanitation was dropped. One o f the components o f the I C M P ro jec t

and mos t recen t ly RSC (FY04-05). A Joint USA ID IB a n k funded co r rup t ion study in Georgia 
in 1998 and f o l l o w up workshops w i t h h i g h leve l o f f i c i a l s contributed t o understanding and 
substantive deliberations on this topic bo th w i t h i n the government as w e l l as non - 
governmental and think-tank institutions, and fed i n t o the Na t iona l A n t i -C o n u p t i o n Program 
o f Georgia. R e f o rm areas addressed through SAC ZZ and SATAC ZZ inc luded strengthening 
State Customs and Tax services - the tw o institutions that had been perceived as the wo rs t in 
terms o f honesty and in teg r i ty . SAC ZZZ helped strengthen revenue administration and 
introduce mo re transparent licensing and pub l ic procurement regimes. A Coun t ry 
Procurement Assessment conducted in 2000 found that o n l y 12 percent o f the value o f a l l 
procurement was compe t i t ive ly bid. This led to enactment o f a procurement l aw in April 
2001 that increased the leve l o f competitive b idd ing f o r government contracts. As a r e s u l t of 
the p o l i c y negotiations w i t h i n the f ramewo rk o f the RSC, the Government produced a report 
on an t i -co r rup t ion in i t ia t ives undertaken between December 2003 and M a y 2004. This report 
i s expected t o i n f o rm a more systemic approach to cu rb ing corruption. 

41. 
However, very l i t t le headway was made against co r rup t ion un t i l 2004. Since the late 
1990s the governance environment has been poo r and rampant co r rup t ion adversely affected 
a l l aspects o f the economy. The extent o f pub l ic mistrust in state institutions was captured b y 
a Transparency International survey in 2003, w h i c h ranked Georgia among the seven worst 
countries w i t h a Co r rup t ion Perception Index o f 1.8 (out o f 10). An t i -co r rup t ion in i t ia t ives 
p r i o r to the Rose Revo lu t ion lacked strong p o l i t i c a l comm i tmen t and were mos t ly p romp ted 
by pressures f r om c i v i l society groups and external donors. These in i t ia t ives were l im i t e d to 
developing anti-corruption programs and recommendations and setting up specialized 
agencies such as the An t i -co r rup t ion Coo rd ina t ion Counc i l and the An t i -co r rup t ion Bureau. 
While these programs and recommendations were sound in themselves, o n l y few o f them 
were actually acted on. Ne i the r the Counc i l n o r the Bureau were g iven necessary support 
f r om the highest echelons (and eventually were abolished). Since early 2004, the government 
has taken s ign i f ican t steps 
to reduce corruption, 
inc lud ing strengthening legislation, 
reorganizing k e y institutions (such as Chamber o f Control, S ta te Security, Customs 
Administration, F inanc ia l Police), a r res t ing and prosecuting no to r ious ly corrupt o f f ic ia ls , and 
replacing the “ t ra f f ic police” w i t h modem and be t te r p a i d pa t ro l police. I n a clear ind ica t ion 
o f the effectiveness o f these measures, tax revenues increased b y 4 percent o f GDP in 2004. 
A comprehensive strategy to prevent co r rup t ion was approved b y the President in June 2005. 

C i v i l service rationalization 

42. 
Progress i n ra t iona l iz ing the c i v i l service has been slow and an unempowered and 
ineflective c iv i l service remains a ma jo r development constraint. Since 1998 the B a n k has 
been among the few development partners t o consistently ma in ta in a focus o n c i v i l service 
i s s u e s in i t s dialogue w i t h the Government. The Bank’s inputs inc lude the C i v i l Service 
Assessment Report o f 3 9 9 e T A fun&ed--though LIL and IDF, and some cond i t ions in 
adjustment lending. Under SAC ZZ, 
f o r example, some 19,000 budgetary pos i t ions were 
eliminated and c i v i l service salaries were substantially increased in 1997. B y and large, 
progress has been ve ry limited, however, and n o re l iab le data exists o n the current size of the 
c i v i l service. While high capacity has existed at the highest levels o f the government, m i d - 
levels o f the c i v i l service have remained ine f fec t ive and decision-making has n o t been 
delegated downward. Government performance was uneven at different stages and a major

were active donors. Their support together w i t h counterpart responsibility and w i l l ingness t o 
imp lemen t re fo rms were ma jo r factors o f success. In an t i -conup t ion efforts, USA ID , U S 
DOJ , UNDP, and Soros Foundation p rov ided significant financial resources bo th t o the 
Government as we l l as t o the NGOs at the i n i t i a l stage. Due to fad ing p o l i t i c a l w i l l up t o the 
Rose Revo lu t ion , donor attention shifted mo re towards c i v i l society, i n c l u d i n g mu l t i -dono r 
funding o f soc ia l fund-type institutions. Coordination w i t h USAID and the C o u n c i l o f Europe 
o n decentralization under the framework o f MDDP I1 has been very close o n the p o l i c y f ron t 
as w e l l as TA activities. M C C and the W o r l d Bank are also j o i n i n g e f fo r ts in f inanc ing the 
mos t needed mun ic ipa l services and infrastructure demands throughout the country. Several 
donors i n c l u d i n g KfW and U S A I D have continued support fo r GSIF and s im i la r social fund- 
type imp lemen t ing mechanisms. However, collaboration in developing fu l ly complementary 
assistance strategies has no t yet occurred in a manner that k e y donor assistance supports k e y 
government goals consistently and w i thou t duplication. This process has imp roved recently, 
pa r t icu la r ly through the PRSO process. 

7. Lessons and Implications fo r Future Bank Partnership 

e Bank resources were scattered th in ly and only p a r t i a l progress was seen across a 
b road f ron t . 

In the past, the B a n k p rov ided advice and f inanc ing across most 
development areas in Georgia. W h i l e this pa r t ly reflected the b road nature of 
Georgia’s development constraints, i t also re f lec ted a lack o f p r io r i t iza t ion on the part 
o f the B a n k and in the event, the B a n k was unable to help f u l l y achieve goals in most 
areas i t was engaged. Imp l ica t ions : The Bank should iden t i fy a few c r i t i c a l areas that 
have b road implications f o r the rest o f the economy and concentrate i t s resources 
towa rd rea l iz ing significant progress in these areas. 

e Adjustment lending d i d not p rove t o be an efSective means of he lp ing advance the 
po l icy agenda in an environment of de te r io ra t ing govemance and commitment to 

reforms. T w o o f the three structural adjustment loans to Georgia during the pe r iod 
under rev iew were rated unsatisfactory at completion. 
In retrospect disbursement 
under SAC 3 appeared to give the government the Bank’s stamp o f approval a t a time 
when corruption and po l i t ica l backs l id ing were h igh . H a d the f i n a l tranche been 
withheld, i t may have sen t a powe r fu l , re la t ive ly early message t o the Government t o 
address the deteriorating governance environment. Imp l ica t ions : The B a n k should be 
cautious in i t s use o f adjustment lend ing in situations o f poo r governance and r igo rous 
in en fo rc ing i ts underlying conditions.

e Wh i le the Bank’s instruments were ab le to keep the reform agenda on the table, they 
were unable in themselves to overcome lack of po l i t ica l w i l l and tolerance of 

co r rup t ion . The Bank’s experience in Georgia revealed that l i t t l e progress can take 
place in an environment o f rampant h igh - leve l corruption. As the governance 
environment worsened in the early 2000s, progress towa rd most objectives supported

by the B a n k stalled. Conve rse ly , f o l l o w i n g the Rose R e v o l u t i o n and the n ew 
gove rnmen t ’s emphasis o n g o o d governance, there was a sharp reve rsa l a n d progress 
in k e y areas accelerated. 
Imp l ica t ions : C r i t i c a l ind ica to rs o f governance shou ld b e 
built into the strategy and an app rop r ia te low-case engagement b e reve r ted t o in a 
t im e l y manne r in the even t o f de te r io ra t ing cond i t ions . 

Inadequate dissemination of Bank activities has undermined b roade r ownership and 
pa r t ic ipa t ion . In the past, consistent concerns have been expressed by representatives 
o f c i v i l society that inadequate i n f o rm a t i o n was ava i lab le o n B a n k - f i n a n c e d p ro jec t 
objectives, conditions, nego t ia t ions , and disbursements. 
Im p l i c a t i o n s : A consistent 
p u b l i c i n f o rm a t i o n strategy s h o u l d b e ma in ta ined . Focus groups f r o m c i v i l society 
shou ld b e f o rm e d in k e y engagement areas t o enhance m o n i t o r i n g and increase 
pressure f r o m c i v i l society to sustain the r e f o rm agenda. A r e g u l a r loca l - language

unde rs tood by c i v i l society. 

The Bank could have played a greater ro le in the strategy development process. 
During the three-year p repa ra t ion o f the EDPRP, the B a n k k e p t an ‘arm’s distance’ 
f r o m the process in o rde r n o t t o unde rm ine “ownership” o f the e v o l v i n g strategy. 
Several l o c a l observers a n d pa r t ic ipan ts in the strategy deve lopmen t process, howeve r , 
argue tha t B a n k adv iso ry assistance o n strategy development, based o n i t s w o r l d -w i d e

the strategy deve lopmen t process, in a manne r that shares g l o b a l expe r ience w i t h o u t

The present g row th p a t t em is not pa r t ic ipa to ry . W h i l e G e o r g i a has ach ieved a

A n unempowered and poo r ly motivated c i v i l service has been a ma jo r constraint to 
economic management, p u b l i c investment, and po l icy implenentation. In several past

Annex 111. CPS Consultations 

In 

The W o r l d Bank Country Office in Georgia interacts closely w i t h members o f c i v i l 
society groups and maintains an on -go ing pub l ic relations p rog ram t o disseminate the 
objectives and instruments of Bank G roup assistance. V iews and contributions f r om c i v i l 
society groups are sought in the preparation and supervision o f IDA projects. 
addition, during preparation of the CPS, several ind iv idua l and group discussions were 
h e l d w i t h representatives o f c i v i l society. These inc luded meetings between the Country 
D i rec to r and lead ing NGOs; in te rv iews w i t h c i v i l societyhusiness leaders on the CAS 
Comp le t ion Report; an IFC /F IAS roundtable w i t h private sector representatives; and 
several fu r the r rounds o f discussions w i t h c i v i l society leaders, inc lud ing a roundtable 
w i t h twen ty t w o c i v i l society members on the draft strategy. Consultations also included 
a roundtable w i t h “youth voices”, w h i c h in turn had held focus group discussions on 
Bank activities w i t h a w ide r range o f participants. K e y messages received inc luded the 
fo l low ing : 
There was general agreement that the Government had made impo r tan t progress on 
reduc ing corruption, education and hea l th reform, and im p r o v i n g pub l ic sector 
ins t i tu t ions and budgeting. Howeve r , there were strong concerns that there was 
inadequate consultation between Government and c i v i l society. Concerns were 
expressed that the Government lacked experience in many areas, that decision- 
mak ing was s t i l l ove r ly concentrated, and that short-comings were apparent in some 
o f the strategic directions being developed. There was concern that the Government 
was reluctant t o engage in some areas that i t lacked experience in. 

I t was agreed that employment-generation was a h igh p r i o r i t y issue and the key to this 
was t o imp rove the environment f o r S M E s . Concerns were raised, however, that 
inadequate in fo rma t ion existed t o develop appropriate strategies as there had no t been 
a labo r market study since 1999. There were some views that labor laws were 
inadequate, bo th failing to protect the workforce and discouraging p r iva te investment. 
I t was also observed that there was n o national innova t ion system or knowledge 
economy strategy in Georgia. 

The need f o r IDA partnership o n the anti-corruption e f fo r t was recognized as 
important. However, there were some concerns as to whether IDA modalities to 
address this i s s u e were appropriate. Renovating courthouses, f o r example, was seen 
as an inadequate measure t o combat corruption. 

IDA objectives in Georgia were seen as too b road and a greater focus was needed. 
Concerns were raised as to h ow ID A w o u l d mon i to r bo th the Government’s and 
IDA ’S progress in advancing development objectives. 

IDA was requested t o continue the dialogue w i t h c i v i l society on the CPS and i t s 
mon i to r ing and evaluation. There was also a need to include representatives o f loca l 
governments i n t o consultations.

Employment and Wages 

Despite economic g row th since 2000, employment has not been increasing. 
W h i l e the economy has seen sustained g row th , ave rag ing 6 percent a year since 2000, 
t o t a l em p l o ym e n t has dec l ined by 3 percent since 2000, i n c l u d i n g a 2 percent dec l ine in

also re f lec ts job shedding in the manu fac tu r ing sector, as emp loye rs take up the slack 
resu l t ing f r o m unde remp loymen t and p rev ious em p l o ym e n t ho rd ing , w h i l e also shedd ing 
excess labo r . Thus w h i l e manu fac tu r ing g rew by an average o f 10 pe rcen t a year, 
emp loymen t in the sector dec l ined by 17 pe rcen t ove r the pe r iod . M e a nw h i l e , k e y 
g r ow t h sectors did n o t show s ign i f ican t emp loymen t -gene ra t ing capacity. W h i l e strong

sectors showed a dec l ine o f 1.7 percent since 2000. Mo reove r , there has been r e l a t i v e l y 
l o w g r ow t h (2 percent f r om 2002 t o 2004) and c o n t r i b u t i o n t o GDP by S M E s (10 percent 
in 2004), in spite o f the fact that S M E s comp r ise 9 8 percent o f the t o t a l numbe r o f 
companies a n d account fo r a la rge share o f wage emp loymen t . In terms o f numbe r o f 
jobs , the m o s t s ign i f ican t areas o f emp loymen t g r ow t h since 2000 have been in trade and 
services, education, a n d construction. 
In te rms o f g r ow t h rates, the fastest j o b c rea t ion 
since 2000 has been in f inanc ia l in te rmed ia t ion (35 percent), cons t ruc t ion (25 percent), 
and ho te ls and restaurants (19 percent). A c c o r d i n g t o o f f i c i a l figures, the unemp loymen t 
ra te has ranged be tween 14-16 percent since 2000. 

Since independence, the bulk of 
j o b c rea t ion has been in selfemployment, 
p r im a r i l y in ag r icu l tu re as we l l as small-scale t rad ing and service activities. With 
l i m i t e d g r ow t h in f o rm a l emp loymen t , ag r icu l tu re rema ins the largest emp loye r in 
Georgia, accoun t ing f o r 54 percent o f t o t a l em p l o ym e n t (up slightly f r o m 5 2 percent in

Given the relatively small size of Geo rg ia ’s domestic market, economic g row th is 
likely t o be d r iven by export markets. Georgia’s low i n c om e l e v e l a n d sma l l p o p u l a t i o n

Agro-Processing Exports 

Geo rg ia ’s food-processing industry declined sharply after independence. During 
the Soviet era, Georgia’s p r ima ry and processed foods accounted f o r mo re than 10 
percent o f to ta l intra-Soviet trade in agricultural products and the value o f i t s f o o d exports 
was double that o f i t s imports. Since independence, w i t h the collapse o f the supply chain 
and deteriorating pub l ic infrastructure, pa r t icu la r ly in powe r supply and road access, most 
new smallholder farmers shifted to subsistence production. As a resu l t , Geo rg ia saw a 
substantial decline in the production o f i t s fo rme r expo r t products. Georgia’s pe r capita 
fruit p roduc t ion in 2000, fo r example, was o n l y one - th i rd o f i t s 1990 level. Some recent 
recovery in agro-processing has occurred in sectors such as w ine and m ine ra l water, 
wh ich has become one o f Georgia’s largest exports, thanks to i t s brand recogn i t ion in the 
FSU. I F C p layed a significant ro le in this sector th rough an early equity investment in 
Georgian Glass and M i n e r a l Water (Bo r jom i ) and continues to be an investor in the M i n a 
glass bo t t le factory, wh ich supplies bottles t o this industry. 

Geo rg ia has a long history and comparative advantage i n v i t icu l tu re . W i n e 
exports saw a sharp fourteen f o l d increase f r om US$3.5 m i l l i o n in 1995 t o US$49 m i l l i o n 
in 2004 and about 30,000 fa rme rs are i n v o l v e d in grape production. The C IS accounts 
for some 90 percent o f w ine exports and good g r ow t h potential exists in t h i s and other 
markets. Part o f Georgia’s comparative advantage l i e s in i t s ab i l i ty t o produce qua l i ty 
wines at competitive costs. Georgia i s also k n o w n as an o r ig in o f qua l i ty wines and 
several Georgian brands have name recogn i t ion in the CIS.2 G row th in the p r em i um w ine 
market i s linked to increasing incomes in C IS and a shift away f r om vodka towards 
lowe r -a lcoho l drinks. Good potential also exists in other markets, inc lud ing the EU i f 
Georgia can ma in ta in i t s competitive cost structure and imp rove product quality. 
Imp roved p roduc t iv i ty can pa r t ly be achieved th rough greater fo re ign direct investment. 
A study o f several w ine producers showed that f i r m s w i t h fo re ign collaboration achieved 
50 percent higher p roduc t iv i ty and nea r ly 40 percent higher turnover per employee than 
loca l f i r m s , due t o economies o f scale, be t te r management techniques, and greater market 
knowledge and access. 

Geo rg ia is competitive in hazelnut-processing. The hazelnut sector has g rown 
five-fold, since 1995. A Bank study estimated that some 12,500 small farmers g row 
hazelnuts, w h i l e processing and export businesses emp loy over 1,200 people. Farm 
mode l ing and cost-of-production comparisons 
ind ica te that Georgia has a h i g h 
comparative advantage in hazelnut p roduc t ion and i s competitive w i t h ne ighbo r ing 
countries. La rge potential markets in Russia and Ch ina o f fe r strong g row th po ten t ia l . In

Forestrv and m ine ra l resources 

Wood processing offers good export po ten t ia l , given considerable reserves of 
timber and p rom is ing market opportunities. W h i l e Georgia has 42 percent o f the forest 
coverage o f Romania, i t has on ly 5 percent o f i t s w o o d exports. One o f the reasons f o r 
Romania’s h ighe r wood export earnings i s that i t has moved up the value chain: w h i l e 
Romania obtains US$215 t o US$1,250 per MT f o r i t s w o o d exports, depending o n the 
degree o f processing, Georgia gets on ly US$121 per MT, as most exports are in the f o r m 
of logs o r in a semi-processed state. At present there are on ly about a dozen f i r m s 
engaged in finished good processing and to ta l employment in the sector i s estimated at 
2,500 people. 
I f the finished goods industry were able to ra ise i t s p roduc t ion t o 
Romanian levels, Georgia cou ld expect exports closer t o US$200 m i l l i o n than the US $ 2 2 
m i l l i o n i t cu r ren t ly has, w i t h consequent imp l ica t ions f o r labo r creation. Key obstacles 
inc lude unpredictable supply o f qua l i ty timber, in part due t o government po l icy ; poo r 
knowledge o f and linkages w i t h w o r l d markets; weak d is t r ibu t ion channels; and limited 
acquisition o f technology. A l o n g w i t h cross-cutting issues such as access t o tax-free 
inputs, lowe r transport costs, and imp roved access t o finance, a k e y p r i o r i t y i s t o im p r o v e

resources. 

M i n e r a l extraction offers some po ten t ia l fo r employment creation. Georgia has 
numerous m ine ra l resources that o f fe r strong g r ow t h potential. After the f a l l o f the 
USSR , the mining industry dec l ined f r om 10 percent o f GDP t o a negligible l e v e l and 
remained at less than 1 percent o f GDP in 2004. Experts suggest that Georgia’s po ten t ia l 
in minerals l i e s in manganese, copper, zinc and poss ib ly u ran ium and fo r ve r t ica l 
integration o f mining and processing activities. Georgia i s estimated t o have one percent 
o f the wo r ld ’s manganese reserves, fo r w h i c h there i s a large and g row ing market, 
inc lud ing a market segment for smart batteries f o r lap top computers, wh ich i s g r ow i n g at 
10-15 percent a year. Georgia also has sizable deposits o f decorative natural stone such 
as gray, wh i te and r e d marble and granite that show considerable po ten t ia l fo r export. 
Wages in the mining and quarrying sector are the highest o f a l l sectors, although the 
sector accounts f o r on ly 0.2 percent o f to ta l employment. Nevertheless, strong g row th 
prospects in the sector o f fe r some potential in j o b creation. F o r example, in Ime re t i the 
Chiatura and Manganese Factory and the Zestaphony F e r r o -A l l o y Plant cu r ren t ly emp loy 
about 6000 people w i t h potential f o r greater numbers once the current p r iva t iza t ion
