EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

i. 
Niger has recently embarked on a path to political stability and has attained 
positive results in reducing poverty, albeit not without uncertainties.  In 2009, efforts 
by then President Tandja to circumvent a two-term limit resulted in a severe political 
crisis that led to the February 2010 military coup d’état. Following a referendum and the 
adoption of a new constitution in November 2010 and a series of local, legislative, and 
presidential elections in early 2011, a new President took office in April 2011. Poverty 
has declined from 64 percent in 2005 to 61 percent in 2007/08 and 56 percent in 2011 
based on preliminary World Bank estimates.  

ii. 
Despite progress, Niger’s development challenges continue to be magnified 
by significant internal and external stresses.  Weak institutions, economic grievances 
and potential spill-over effect of the Mali crisis, and the risk of a growing young 
population, could alter the country’s fragile equilibrium. Vulnerability to droughts and 
severe climate shocks represents a major threat to Niger’s stability. The Authorities are 
committed to introducing an integrated approach to building resilience of communities. 

iii. 
Niger displays a ‘grievance-generating resource economy’ that has yet to 
provide tangible benefits for the majority of the population.  The agriculture sector 
has been the main engine of growth over the past decade. A poor harvest in 2011 had a 
negative impact on economic growth and caused severe cereal deficit, mitigated with 
large inflows of humanitarian aid. A good harvest last year and the start of oil production 
improved the economic outlook. Fiscal policies remained prudent even during the period 
of highest political instability. 

iv. 
Strong and inclusive growth is an urgent priority for Niger.  After more than 
three decades of declining or stagnating per capita incomes, sustaining economic growth 
remains vital for Niger’s development and poverty reduction. In the medium term, scaled 
up production in the uranium and petrol sector will be the primary driver of growth. Good 
results have been attained in reducing poverty over the past decade and in improving 
social indicators. However, gender inequality and high population growth rate, both 
linked to long-standing cultural norms, may hamper inclusive economic growth. 

v. 
The strategic objectives of the proposed Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) 
are to assist Niger achieve resilient growth, reduce vulnerability and strengthen 
capacity for service delivery.  Accordingly, the CPS supports actions aimed at 
strengthening the macroeconomic foundation, the investment climate and access to 
finance to build resilient growth, improve agricultural productivity and marketing of 
selected crops and promote risk-based agriculture to mitigate the impacts of climatic 
changes and variability. Safety net programs will be further strengthened to reduce 
vulnerability of the poorest and improve resilience of the population to natural hazards, 
climatic change and variability; the program will target in particular gender-specific 

vi 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
actions across all activities, will reinforce education and youth employment skills, and 
support improved coverage and quality of basic services.  

vi. 
This Strategy is fully aligned with the 2012 Government Plan for Social and 
Economic Development (PDES) and the World Bank Strategy for Africa.  In 
particular, the CPS is aligned with the PDES objectives of strengthening the credibility of 
public institutions; creating the conditions for inclusive, sustainable and balanced 
development; supporting food security and sustainable agricultural development; creating 
a competitive and diversified economy for accelerated, inclusive growth; and promoting 
social development.  

vii. 
The success of this strategy may be hampered by four foreseeable major 
risks: (i) the Sahel crisis and security risks; (ii) climatic exogenous shocks e.g droughts, 
locust infestation, floods; (iii) capacity constraints; (iv) and natural resources related 
risks. Mainstreaming gender and strengthening governance and capacity across the board 
will need to be pursued to deliver the two interdependent and mutually reinforcing 
strategic objectives. Innovative financing mechanisms such as the Crisis Response 
Window (CRW), Contingent Emergency Response Component under the framework of 
Immediate Response Mechanism (IRM) are considered under this CPS to act flexibly and 
in a timely manner should a crisis arise.

I. 

INTRODUCTION 

1. 
The last Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Niger was discussed by the 
Board on April 29, 2008 and was intended to cover the period up to June 30, 2011.  
However, political instability caused severe disruptions to implementation that forced the 
Bank to slow down its program.  The Bank re-engaged with Niger following the lifting of 
OP/BP.7.30 restrictions and the establishment of a new government in accordance with 
Niger law in April 2011.  The new regime engaged with its partners to formulate its Plan 
for Social and Economic Development – PDES – adopted 
in August 2012.  
Implementation of the current CAS was extended by one year as a result, and this 
extension enabled the full delivery of the originally planned program. The proposed 
Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) covers a period of four years, from FY2013 to 
FY2016.   

II. COUNTRY CONTEXT 

A. 

Regional Context 

2. 
Niger is located in an unstable sub-region, surrounded by armed conflict and 
rebellions. The Libyan conflict led to the return of over 100,000 migrants and an out-
flow of arms which contributed to regional instability. Remittances declined drastically as 
a result of the massive return of migrants, and it was further exacerbated by the financial 
burden of supporting returnees. As many Sahel countries face recurrent food and 
nutrition crises, the influx of refugees in Niger has put additional strain on families 
already struggling with a shortfall in agricultural production. 

3. 
The coup d’état and rebellion in Mali have resulted in an additional inflow of 
around 64,000 refugees into Niger, compounded by existing tensions in the north 
between Tuareg populations and the Government in Niamey.  The refugee population 
is mostly concentrated in the northern Tillabéry region, one of the areas hit the hardest by 
the 2012 food crisis. Given that around 5 million people1 are at chronic risk of food 
shortages and malnutrition,  the inflow of additional refugees has worsened an already 
fragile humanitarian situation. 

4. 
Political and religious groups from outside Niger have emerged as alternative 
service providers and authorities, finding easy ground to establish roots among the 
disenfranchised and marginalized parts of the society. The Boko Haram sect in 
Nigeria has increasingly used Niger for recruitment and as a refuge. The expulsion of 
more than 10,000 Nigeriens from northern Nigeria and border closures by Nigerian 
authorities has significantly threatened the economy in the south of Niger. 

5. 

These factors have overstretched the security forces and border protection

resources. A weak regional security architecture and general militarization in the region 
have facilitated cross-border trafficking of drugs and arms across the entire Sahel region. 
The military intervention against AQIM and Jihadist militants in Mali presents a risk of 
spill-over into Niger2. Tuareg insurgencies elsewhere are perceived as a source of tension 
that could potentially involve the Nigerien Tuareg community.   

B. 

Political Context  

6. 
Historically unstable, Niger has experienced frequent political infighting and 
coups d’états  but has recently stabilized. In 2009, efforts by then President Tandja 
to circumvent a two-term limit resulted in a severe political crisis that led to the 
February 2010 military coup d’état. As a result, from February 2010 to April 2011, 
Niger was governed by the Supreme Council for the Restoration of Democracy under the 
presidency of a military general. Following a referendum and the adoption of a new 
constitution in November 2010 and a series of local, legislative, and presidential elections 
in early 2011, a new President took office in April 2011.  

7. 
Niger has now entered a period of relative stability but long term trends are 
challenging.  Repeated coups d’états and violent rebellions have reduced trust in the 
effectiveness and stability of the political system. Coupled with weak service provision, 
these phenomena weaken state legitimacy and open up space for alternative service 
providers and claimants of legitimacy, such as emerging conservative religious groups 
and traditional authorities, which are mostly implanted in rural areas, where more than 80 
percent of the population lives and where central government influence is weak. 

8. 
The army is a powerful actor in Niger’s political and economic landscape. 
With four military governments since independence, Niger has experienced longer spells 
of military than civilian rule. However, since 1991, the army has transferred power to 
civilian rulers and now plays the role of the guardian of democratic rule. As a result of 
the presence of security threats, the army has benefited from substantial amounts of 
resources and training, reinforcing its importance. 

9. 
Niger displays a ‘grievance-generating resource economy’ that has yet to 
provide tangible benefits for the majority of the population. The Tuareg rebellions of 
2007-2009, were fuelled mainly by grievances over: (i) lack of economic benefits from 
uranium exports; (ii) under-representation in the labor force of French and Chinese 
companies, and (iii) poor working conditions in uranium mines and oil sites. With the 
uranium mines mainly located in the Tuareg-inhabited North, these phenomena 
underscore the importance of focusing on local governance and improving the 
mechanisms to channel local grievances and resolve them in an inclusive fashion3 . 

2 Illicit activities generate significant funds for terrorists, which are used for arms purchases and the creation of local 
patronage networks that consolidate extremists’ standing in communities.

Economic Context 

 Recent Economic Developments and Economic Outlook  

10. 
The structure of the Nigerien economy is dominated by agriculture, which 
contributes 43 percent of GDP, and commerce and services, which contribute 41 
percent.  Industry accounts for only 16 percent of GDP and remains characterized by a 
lack of competitiveness and low diversification. While manufacturing industries 
increased their contribution from less than 2 percent of GDP over the period 1990-2004 
to 4 percent in 2011, significant potential remains, in particular to increase the processing 
of agricultural products. 
11. 
Niger’s historical growth performance has been difficult with a decline in 
real per capita incomes by more than 30 percent between 1980 and 2000.  Following 
a short lived uranium boom in the 1970s, Niger experienced a continuous decline in per 
capita incomes until around 2000. Annual average per capita growth between 1960 and 
2000 was a mere one percent. While macro-economic stability and economic reforms 
resulted in a significant increase in average growth to 4.7 percent during the period 2001-
2010, this was largely negated by high population growth, resulting in GDP growth per 
capita of around 1 percent per year.  Niger has one of Africa’s highest population growth 
rates estimated at 3.3 percent per year.

12. Over the past decade, the rural sector has been the main engine of growth.  
In the short run, the sector’s performance is primarily determined by rainfall patterns, 
resulting in large year to year fluctuations of production. While in years with strong 
harvests Niger becomes a net exporter of cereals, in years with poor harvests Niger 
becomes a net importer, with imports funded with the support of the international 
community.  Livestock as well as agricultural niche products such as onion, black eyed 
peas, or gum Arabica contribute about 50 percent of Niger’s exports.

13. 
Frequent droughts, political instability, and fluctuations in revenue from 
Niger’s mineral exports have contributed to high volatility in Niger’s growth rate. 
Niger’s extreme vulnerability to climatic shocks, unstable enabling environment, and 
developments in the global demand for uranium is a result of the undiversified structure 
of the economy, which is unable to absorb or mitigate the impact of shocks 
14. 
A poor harvest in 2011 resulted in economic growth of only 2.3 percent and a 
severe cereal deficit, which triggered large inflows of humanitarian aid in 2012.  
Growth in 2012 is expected to reach 11.2 percent as the result of a good harvest and the 
start of oil production.  Annual average inflation was 2.9 percent in 2011 and is projected 
to drop to 0.6 percent in 2012. Still thanks to heavy rains, the 2012 harvest generated 
over 5 million tons cereals surplus – the highest in 5 years – which shows the huge 
potential if water resource were under control in such arid lands. 
15. 
Niger commenced oil production in November 2011 in a joint venture with 
the Chinese National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC). Due to pricing, regulatory and 
coordination problems in upstream oil production, refining, and marketing, the refinery 
was only producing in 2012 around 11,000 to 12,000 barrels per day, well below its full 
capacity of 20,000. The launch of oil production has also given rise to social pressures for 
a reduction in domestic fuel prices and for increases in civil service salaries.

16. 
Revenue from the extractive industries sector accounted for about two 
percent of GDP in 2011 and is projected to increase to about 5 percent of GDP by 
2015.  The completion of the link to the Chad-Cameroon pipeline in 2015 is expected to 
contribute to a further significant increase in revenue from the projected export of 60,000 
barrels of crude oil per day. Yet high yielding physical, human, and financial capital 
associated with revenue from the extractive industries represent major challenges for the 
authorities. 
17. 
Niger’s manufacturing and handicrafts sector is small and mostly informal.  
It has shown little dynamism in recent years, but with improvements in the business 
environment it could be the basis for diversification and job creation. 
18. 
Niger’s economic outlook is affected by large scale investments in the 
uranium sector.  Total uranium production was 4351 tons in 2011 generating exports of 
about F CFA 300 bn.  Since 2009, development of the Imouraren deposit has been 
ongoing and is expected to more than double uranium production by adding 5000 tons 
per year when production commences in 2015.  In 2010, mining of the Azelik deposit 
started in a joint venture between the Nigerien government and Chinese partners.  
Production is expected to reach 2500 tons per year by 2015 and potentially double by 
2020. Realization of these investments, together with increased petroleum production, 
will be a major driver of growth in the medium term. 
19. 
Developments in the agriculture, mining, and oil sectors are the main 
determinants of Niger’s balance of trade.  Exports of uranium currently account for 
about 50 percent of total exports and increased by 24 percent in 2011.  The value of other 
exports, mainly livestock and agricultural products, increased by 14 percent in 2011 
contributing to an overall increase in the value of exports by 19 percent.  The value of 
imports increased by 12 percent and imports of capital goods destined primarily for the 
mining and oil industry grew by four percent and accounted for about one third of total 
imports. Due to the good 2010/11 harvest, imports of food declined by seven percent and 
their share in total imports dropped from 27 to 22 percent. Donor grants and loans are the 
main source of current account funding in Niger and increased from 4.1 percent of GDP 
in 2010 to 9.3 percent of GDP in 2011.  
20. 
Despite the economic and political turbulence experienced between 2009 and 
2011, fiscal policies remained consistent with macroeconomic stability. Government’s 
fiscal policy was broadly in line with macro-economic programs agreed with the IMF.  
The fiscal deficit (including grants) increased only slightly from 2.6 percent of GDP in 
2010 to 2.8 percent of GDP in 2011.  For 2012, the deficit is projected to increase to 3.9 
percent of GDP.  The medium term challenge for Niger is to enhance domestic revenue 
mobilization, which stood at 15.1 percent of GDP in 2011 and to enhance the allocative 
and operational efficiency of public expenditures. 
21. 
Niger’s financial sector remains severely underdeveloped with most of the 
rural economy and SMEs without access to credit.  Financial sector depth (M2/GDP) 
increased from 19 percent by the end of 2009 to 22 percent by the end of 2011, but Niger 
remains well below the 41 percent average for Sub Saharan Africa. Credit to the private 
sector as a percentage of GDP has increased steadily from 6.8 percent in 2004 to 13.0 
percent in 2010 and further to 14.2 percent in 2011 but credit to SMEs remains 

5 

 
inadequate.  In February 2012, the authorities completed a financial sector development 
strategy and action plan4.   
22. 
Enhanced public financial management and a prudent debt policy are key to 
preserving debt sustainability and ensuring the efficient use of available fiscal space. 
Following a significant reduction of Niger’s external debt through the Enhanced HIPC 
initiative and the MDRI, the NPV of external debt has been rising rapidly from 10.9 
percent in 2009 to a projected 29.0 percent in 2012, mainly on account of borrowing and 
guarantees for Government engagement in the mining and petroleum sectors. Most of 
Niger’s external borrowing is on concessional terms to support Niger’s large 
development needs.  Preliminary results from the latest debt sustainability analysis 
(DSA)5 based on end-2011 data show that the risk of debt distress remains moderate. The 
DSA highlights the need to minimize borrowing on commercial terms for public 
investment projects, and limit as much as possible the Government’s involvement in the 
financing of natural resources projects6. A Debt Management Performance Assessment 
was carried out by the Bank Group in 2012 and the authorities have requested technical 
assistance for the preparation of a debt management reform plan and a medium term debt 
strategy to be provided in 2013.          

23. 
Increasing per capita income growth is imperative for Niger.  After more than 
three decades of declining or stagnating per capita incomes, promoting economic growth 
remains vital for Niger’s development and poverty reduction.  The main elements to 
support economic growth and competitiveness defined in the World Bank’s Strategy for 
Africa - namely improving infrastructure, the business environment, and human 
capacity/skills - are all highly relevant for Niger.   

24. 
In the medium term, scaled up production in the uranium and petroleum 
sector will be the primary driver of growth.  However, as the growth impact of the 
large scale extractive industry investments peters out, sustained economic growth and 
employment generation will depend on scaled up productivity in the agriculture sector 
and the diversification of the economy. Several areas have potential to contribute to a 
diversification of the economy. First is the diversification of natural resource exploitation 
beyond uranium, with significant proven potential for gold, base metals and coal.  The 
Government is actively seeking to promote this diversification within the mining sector. 
Second, the promotion of mining sector related activities by strengthening the linkages 
with the rest of the economy through development of clusters.  Third, agriculture sector 
activities, in particular related to processing and trade in agricultural products (beef and 
hides).  Fourth, scaling up of non-agricultural and non-mining activities that are currently 
concentrated in the informal sector.  Investing in women and men as economic agents 

4 The strategy envisages, among other things, improvements in the legal and judicial framework  (including for 
mortgages and guarantees); deepening the financial sector (including through credit to SMEs), increasing the stability 
and transparency of the financial sector, and developing and building capacity and knowledge of financial institutions 
and the public as well.

strengthening of the management of public investments and increasing absorptive capacity will be critical to ensure the 
effective use of external resources.

provides the potential to improve women’s on-farm and off-farm productivity and their 
relative wages, thereby lessening the demand for large family size and high fertility. 

D. 

Poverty and social context 

25. 
Poverty has declined from 64 percent in 2005 to 61 percent in 2007/08 and 56 
percent in 2011 based on preliminary World Bank estimates7. Poverty trends are 
dependent upon the rate of economic growth and the manner in which the growth is 
distributed between groups in the population. In line with population concentration, 
poverty remains primarily a rural phenomenon because 80 percent of the population is 
rural and  a little more than nine out of ten poor Nigeriens reside in rural areas. Therefore, 
the economic growth resulting from increased returns to the agricultural sector will 
disproportionately benefit the poor because that is where the majority seek their 
livelihoods. The reduction in poverty occurring during this period is likely attributable to 
positive changes in agricultural sector growth. This sector relies predominantly on rain-
fed agriculture in which performance is exposed to droughts, locusts, pest and disease 
outbreaks and a number of agricultural risks.  The incidence of drought – which occurred 
four times between 2000 and 2012 – caused dramatic fluctuations in annual real GDP 
growth and wielded significant adverse impacts on per capita income.  

26. Household size, lack of education, and agricultural employment are 
important correlates of poverty in Niger.  Household dependency ratios have a hugely 
negative effect on household consumption. The level of consumption increases in the 
household by about 0.4 percent with each additional one percent increase in household 
size which suggests a strong negative relationship between fertility and poverty.  Urban 
household heads who have completed primary education are likely to sustain greater 
levels of consumption compared with urban heads who did not attend school.  Education 
has no poverty reduction effect on rural households.  Given that agriculture is practiced 
predominantly using low levels of inputs and technology in settings where population 
densities have increased rapidly over time, the returns to labor would be low.  As 
expected, heads of households working in agriculture face a significantly larger 
consumption shortfall and by implication face a higher probability of being poor.  

27. 
The impacts of economic shocks are likely to exact the largest toll on the 
poorest households in the population.  During the period following a drought 
households are likely to experience extreme spikes in grain prices- well above the level of 
fluctuations attributed to seasonality. Household behavior is extremely sensitive to these 
events since grain consumption represents a significant portion of the household diet. As 
an example, in early 2010, a period that followed the drought of 2009, a 10 percent 
increase in the price of millet led to an almost 10 percent reduction in millet consumption 
per capita.  In addition to cutting back on millet and other dietary consumption, 
households also responded by selling their productive assets and in dire cases households 
consumed the seed stock that was reserved for future seasons. These events led to large 
welfare losses in households which aren’t likely to be recovered easily.8 

7 These figures are under discussion with the National Institute of Statistics and are subject to revision. 
8 For more discussion on the welfare implications of economic shocks, see World Bank, “Niger: Investing for 
Prosperity – A Poverty Assessment”, 2012.

28. 
Besides the immediate welfare losses, high exposure to shocks also induces 
risk-averse behaviors in agricultural decision making among households. This partly 
explains low levels of uptake by farmers of modern agricultural inputs, and in turn low 
agricultural productivity growth9. Other factors such as affordability, lack of availability 
and relatively expensive inputs, limited agricultural advisory and financial services, also 
impair farmer’s ability to adopt improved agriculture practices. 

29. 
Poverty trends appear to be unstable for several reasons.  First, despite the 
downward trend in poverty incidence that occurred between all survey-referenced 
periods, the poverty gap and the poverty severity trends present more varied outcomes.  
These indicators focus on measuring the welfare of the poor relative to the poverty line 
and suggest that inequality among the poorest has grown. The change in the rural poverty 
severity measure remained positive between all three periods. These trends suggest that 
while agricultural growth has led to a reduction in poverty over time, the poorest 
segments may be less able to bounce back from economic crises and they remain 
entrenched in low levels of consumption.  Second, although the incidence of poverty is 
estimated to have decreased the absolute numbers of the poor have not declined in Niger.  
The percentage reduction in poverty did not keep pace with the rate of population growth 
and any gains in poverty reduction have been cancelled out.  

30. 
Despite significant progress on social indicators, there are strong concerns 
that gender issues and the high population growth rate, both of which derive from 
long-standing cultural norms, will hamper inclusive economic growth. Niger is 
among the fastest growing populations (3.3 percent per annum) coupled with a young age 
structure, in which half the population is under age 15 and can be expected to experience 
high rates of population growth in the medium term. At this current growth rate, the 
population would reach about 54 million by 2050. This high population growth is largely 
the product of an extremely high fertility rate: with an average of 7.6 children per 
woman, Niger stands alone as the country with the highest fertility rate in the world. High 
population growth creates huge challenges in terms of demand for social infrastructure 
and services (e.g., education, health, nutrition, employment, housing and urban 
management) and the availability of factors of production. Further, high fertility is likely 
to result in low worker output- or low capital intensification- and provide disincentives to 
females to make tradeoffs in family size over increased labor force participation. Females 
bear high opportunity costs in terms of lost school completion, educational achievement, 
and capacity to earn and generate income. 

31. 
Persistent poverty and high levels of gender inequality have hindered female 
participation in Niger’s development processes. Gender differences are pervasive in 
human development outcomes, legal status, economic opportunities, and political voice.  
Enrollment gaps in primary education are most acute for poor girls living in rural areas.  
They trail boys by about 15 percentage points. Uptake in contraceptive usage edged up 

9 Preliminary evidence based on 2011 household survey data indicate that large portions of the population tend to 
experience some level of food insecurity during the year. Approximately 40 percent of the population is found to be 
food insecure during at least one episode while nearly 23 percent are considered to be chronically food insecure.

only to about 12 percent and high maternal mortality remains of paramount concern.  
Differences in legal capacity and status are particularly acute for married women who 
possess lower legal status and property rights than men. These differences are likely to 
undermine business opportunities in the non-agricultural economy for women and also 
impinge upon their productivity in the agricultural sector. Female farmers are likely to 
use lower levels of productive inputs and be less exposed to technological innovations 
compared with their male counterparts. Women are poorly represented in public life and 
in decision-making institutions in Niger. Female parliamentarians hold less than 14 
percent of the seats in the Parliament. Increasing  opportunities for girls to access 
education will offer the benefit of not only facilitating economic empowerment and 
opportunities for women but also help to curb the high rate of demographic growth and 
accelerate economic development. Specifically, this will entail breaking the cycle of 
early-marriages, unsustainably high birth rate, infant and maternal mortality rates, and 
girls’ school dropout rates. 

E. 

Progress toward the MDGs and human development indicators  

32. 
Despite significant progress achieved in the last decade, Niger is far from 
reaching the MDG targets by 2015 (see Table 2 and Annex 22) and its human 
development indicators remain among the lowest. Based on present trends only 3 out 
of the 7 MDG targets appear likely to be met by 2015, in spite of some positive 
developments. The primary completion rate grew from 18 percent in 1990 to 52 percent 
in 2011. While this is a notable increase, Niger’s education indicators remain among the 
lowest in SSA. With an enrollment rate of only 13 percent, secondary education 
coverage, for instance, is extremely low. Gender inequalities have also tended to decline 
but remain strong, particularly in terms of education and access to healthcare. The 
girls/boys ratio in primary school increased from 56 percent in 1990s to 82 percent in 
2011. While the child mortality MDG target is likely to be met, highlighting a positive 
trend partly related to increased use of bed nets, child and maternal mortality indicators 
remain very high. With a rate of over 500, Niger is notably among the highest in maternal 
mortality. Access to health care, including the coverage of vaccines, remains inadequate 
especially in rural areas and the incidence of malaria and HIV prevalence have slightly 
increased despite government efforts. While prevalence of stunting in children aged 24-
35 months has fallen slightly, about 47 percent of children under 5 are stunted and 34 
percent are under-weight, these are very high rates at the SSA level. Child malnutrition 
rate is still very high due to recurrent food shortage, particularly in rural areas. Access to 
water indicator is on target. Against this backdrop, Niger signed up to the MDG 
Acceleration Framework (MAF) to focus more on poverty and food insecurity (MDG1).  
Human capital improvements will be critical to achieve higher competitiveness and 
growth and reduce vulnerability.

III. CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES 

33. 
At present, Niger has an unprecedented opportunity to make significant 
advances in development and poverty reduction, but also faces high risks from 
conflict in neighboring countries.  The successful return to constitutional order in April 
2011 provides the basis for a renewed focus on economic development and poverty 
reduction.  The government program sets out an ambitious agenda to foster economic 
growth, food security, universal primary education, and good governance.  At the same 
time, the start of oil production in November 2011 and large scale investments in the 
uranium sector promise to boost economic growth in the medium term and provide 
additional resources to Government for the realization of its program.   

34. Over the past decade, Niger has also developed a strong record of reforms 
that have been implemented despite severe human and institutional capacity 
constraints and frequently recurring domestic and external shocks that claim much 
of government’s attention.  Niger’s Country Policy and Institutions Assessment rating 
has increased steadily over the past few years and stands now at 3.4, above the average 
for Sub-Saharan Africa of 3.2.  Progress has been particularly strong in strengthening 
economic management, but also in the area of policy for social inclusion and equity, 
which plays an important role in reducing the potential for conflict. 

35. On account of these improvements in policies and institutions, Niger is not 
formally on the World Bank’s fragile situations list, but internal and external 
stresses could, if left unchecked, alter its fragile equilibrium.  These include political 
fragility where failure of the Government to deliver tangible results could result quickly 
in the loss of popular support and a political stalemate; increased security threats from 

10 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
conflict and terrorist activities in the sub-region; continued vulnerability to climatic 
shocks and developments in commodity markets; and a high fertility rate which puts 
further stress on Niger’s scarce land resources, weak social service delivery systems, and 
its small labor market. 

36. 
Strong economic management and improved policies and institutions provide 
a conducive environment for the productive use of official development assistance, 
but various studies identify Niger as an “aid orphan” with inadequate and 
unpredictable flows of aid representing a main constraint to the expansion of social 
services and infrastructure.  In response to the commitment of the international 
community contained in the Accra Agenda for Action to “address the issue of countries 
that receive insufficient aid,” the World Bank and the OECD carried out research that 
sought to identify countries that receive insufficient aid.10  Using a variety of global aid 
allocation approaches as benchmarks, this research consistently identified Niger among 
the countries that receive insufficient aid.  Efforts to help mobilize aid in conjunction 
with private sector resources are thus essential, and the CPS envisages to support these 
efforts.  

A. 

Vulnerability and Resilience 

37. 
Niger is extremely vulnerable to severe climate shocks with drought being 
the most important risk in terms of frequency and impacts. Despite availability of an 
efficient early monitoring system – Système d’Alerte Précoce (SAP) - insufficient 
preparedness and lack of ex-ante risk management strategies have led to frequent 
drought-related insecurities. Indeed, between 1980 and 2012, 10 major episodes of 
drought have been recorded, of which 8 led to major food and fodder deficit11. The food 
crisis resulting from the 2011 drought affected more than 7 million people or half of the 
country’s total population. On top of drought, locust infestation and crops and animal 
disease are contributing to food insecurity.  
38. 
Flooding is another important natural hazard affecting people’s lives and 
physical assets in Niger. Recent floods in August 2012 adversely affected more than 
500,000 people of which at least 176,000 were rendered homeless.  More broadly, the 
country’s vulnerability to frequent weather shocks has impacts on housing, agriculture, 
livestock, business, industry, soil degradation with implications on soil fertility. 
39. While the agricultural sector is exposed to a large number of constraints and 
risks, demographic and climatic changes also offer a number of opportunities. The 
trend of aggregate rainfall is increasing and movement of isohyets to the north provides 
new areas for acreage expansion as well as new opportunities for tapping groundwater for 
irrigation. Increased penetration of cell phone use in rural areas offers a new delivery

Monitoring of Under-Aided Countries.  DCD/DAC(2011)18.  April 27, 2011. 
11In 2008, more than 50 percent of Niger’s population was estimated to be chronically food insecure, with 22 percent 
suffering from extreme chronic food insecurity. The implication of climatic shocks on Niger’s ability to significantly 
address issues of poverty is put in better perspective given that agriculture accounts for over 40 percent of GDP and is 
the main source of livelihoods for over 80 percent of the population.  

11 

 
 
 
                                                 
channel to provide services and enable effective decision-making by agricultural sector 
stakeholders. While burgeoning population remains a huge challenge for food security, it 
also offers big market opportunities for agricultural producers. In addition, proximity  to 
Nigeria and sustained demand for agriculture commodities from coastal cities in the 
ECOWAS space provide potential markets for Niger.  
40. More importantly the Government’s 3N Initiative (Nigeriens Nourish 
Nigeriens) offers a unique window of opportunity to support an integrated approach 
to building resilience of communities by improving land-use planning and secure 
property rights, developing flood risk analysis and early warning systems; increasing 
efficiency and productivity of agriculture and livestock production systems, through inter 
alia sustainable land and water management, improved agriculture and livestock  services 
and inputs markets for accelerated adoption of improved technologies and good 
agricultural practices, integrating information services to improve government and 
farmers decision making, and scaling-up safety net systems.12 
41. 
Demographic dividend or youth bulge? High population growth makes it 
much more difficult to achieve development outcomes. Human development indicators 
are all lagging in Niger and are a key cause of vulnerability for the country. High fertility 
rates and related rapid population growth severely limit the development outcomes which 
can be achieved through education and health services. For instance, the links between 
high fertility and high malnutrition (of mothers and children) also means that the children 
of today face a double burden of competition for scarce resources as well as the 
likelihood of poor cognitive and nutrition traps that will put them on a permanently lower 
trajectory in terms of opportunities. To be able to take advantage of the demographic 
dividend, Niger needs to make faster progress in reducing child mortality, and continue 
expanding reproductive health services and the promotion of modern contraceptive 
usage, while creating high level support for population policy through nationwide 
advocacy and communication efforts. Longer-term measures to reduce fertility also need 
to include the promotion of gender equality through higher women's labor force 
participation and better access to health and education services.   

42. High population growth also creates daunting challenges to absorb the youth 
into the labor force. Youth faces several problems that pose a threat to stability and can 
be seen as a driver of fragility, as they become increasingly more frustrated with the 
political situation and its inability to adequately respond to their challenges. Two key 
issues that cause frustration and a sense of marginalization have been identified as the 
following: (i) high unemployment amongst both educated and non-educated youth with 
the perception that jobs are distributed based on personal relationships rather than skill 
sets; and (ii) a mismatch between education and the employment market, as the options 
for the majority of educated youth seem to be limited to two professional paths: the army 
or teaching. 

12 One key issue is the absence of a comprehensive safety nets scheme able to protect human capital in times of crises. 
The social protection strategy needs to focus on improving the efficiency, scope, and coordination of safety net 
programs (both existing and new ones), while supporting better nutrition practices and promoting effective medium-
term strategies and investments to improve resilience to economic and natural shocks.

43. 
A broad-based, inclusive growth pattern can go a long way to address some 
of Niger’s economic grievances. As the country transitions into a resource-based 
economy, it is critical that the proceeds of natural resource revenues are used to advance 
the development agenda; increase the potential for youth employability and job creation; 
and provide benefits to the poorest segments of the population and further reduce the 
incidence of poverty.  

44. 
Niger exemplifies social cohesion in the Sahel that needs to translate into 
equitable development impact. Four years after the end of the rebellion symbolized by 
the Mouvement des Nigériens pour la Justice (MNJ) which started in 2007 following 
claims on the lack of equal sharing of mining revenues and social investments, the 
integration movement of Tuareg in Niger has found a new dynamic in combination with 
the acceleration of the decentralization process. Local and regional elections organized in 
2011 saw many former rebellion leaders appointed or elected to official positions. 
Populations are more closely involved in the local management, investments have been 
obtained and the Government’s anticipation of the consequences of the Libyan crisis – 
returnees and weapons – was key in keeping the region pacified. Finally, the ethnic and 
cultural intermixing is such in Niger13 that the bulk of the challenges remain at the 
economic level. In order to curb the poverty gap, this will require increasing financial 
support for investments in the northern regions embodied by the current Strategy on 
Security and Development in the Sahel Regions known as SDS Niger. 

B. Weak Business Environment and Lack of Diversification  

45. 
Although extractive industries are important for the economy of Niger, the 
growth of mining activities has not spurred the development of other economic 
sectors. The extractive industries have evolved as enclave projects, and their impact on 
broad-based growth has been constrained by low level of private sector development and 
weak forward, backward and sideways linkages with the non-extractive economic 
sectors.  

46. 
Despite Niger’s important energy resources, energy consumption is limited 
and mainly based on massive use of wood fuel (85 percent of total consumption). 
Niger imports 85 percent of its electricity consumption from Nigeria, with a national 
estimated rate of access of 8 percent (47 percent in urban areas and 0.4 percent in rural 
areas).  

47. With an underdeveloped financial sector and approximately 1,400 businesses 
registered contributing to only about 15 percent of GDP, Niger’s formal private 
sector base is one of the smallest in the region. It is estimated that about 60 percent of 
Niger’s economic activity takes place in the informal sector. With the exception of some 
niche markets, the private sector base is poorly connected to the global economy. Most of

the country’s growth potential is associated with the oil and mining sector, livestock, and 
regional trade mostly with Nigeria (its main economic partner) and with the West African 
Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) countries. The 2013 Doing Business DB 
report considers Niger as one of the most difficult countries to engage in private sector 
activities (176 out of 185 countries). Private sector development is hampered by poor 
infrastructure, limited access to finance, slow government procedures, corruption, low 
labor productivity, ineffective taxation and tax administration.  

48. 
Private sector development is also hampered by high transport prices which 
reduce competitiveness, and indirectly, negatively impact growth and the job market. 
Poorly designed market regulation has resulted in the provision of low quality transport 
services, insufficiently capitalized trucking companies and obsolete trucking fleets. 
Existing regional and bilateral arrangements discourage the provision of efficient road 
transport services. Regulatory reforms including regional freight sharing agreements and 
national carrier restrictions need to be coordinated at the regional level to be 
transformational.  

49. 
The projected increase in natural resource production and revenues offers an 
opportunity to promote inclusive growth. The 2010 Constitution contains far-reaching 
provisions to allocate 15 percent of mining revenues to the local government of the 
regions where these resources are generated and requires greater transparency in the 
extractive industries at large. 

C. Governance and Public Sector 

50. 
Despite recent improvements, public service delivery is limited by capacity 
constraints. Public service is provided by a tiny administration made of a small number 
of aging civil servants that are poorly trained and often lack adequate qualifications, 
resources and training opportunities for their functions. Human resource management 
cannot track the overall number of civil servants, develop a merit-based policy and 
provide adequate incentives. Introduction of ICT tools and systems, and related changes 
in working procedures are still at an early stage.  
51. 
Improvements in Public Financial Management (PFM) are needed to 
streamline budget preparation, execution processes and internal and external 
controls. The draft report of the 2012 repeater PEFA reveals very limited progress 
achieved since 2008. Among 31 indicators, 20 received ratings equal or inferior in 
comparison with the 2008 assessment while 11 indicators marked slight progress, mainly 
in areas where technical assistance had been strong.  

52. 
Rent seeking remains relatively common in the provision of service delivery, 
and politicization is relatively common in the public administration. Recruitment is 
not systematically based on merit, and skills need to be significantly strengthened. 
Overall, the public sector does not have effective incentive mechanisms. Other challenges 
include multiple personnel statutes, staff turnover, and discrepancies in the payroll 
systems, and lack of precise information on the number of public servants. The judicial 

14 

 
 
 
 
 
 
system is also facing important challenges such as limited access, and interference in 
enforcement processes.  

53. 
The mining sector is bedeviled by non-transparent mechanisms for award of 
exploration licenses and mining contracts.   Mining contracts are often characterized 
by high up-front payments with little attention to maximization of medium/long-term 
value – and revenues - for the state. The tax administration capacity especially in the 
mining sector has been limited. Finally, the allocation of resources and the quality of 
public investment systems and expenditure execution does not allow for the effective use 
of public resources generated by mining investments for growth. The Government of 
Niger is committed to revisit existing contracts in the extractive industry sector for a 
better win-win deal. 
54. 
Niger’s international governance indicators have shown a favorable trend in 
recent years in a difficult regional context. On the 2012 Ibrahim Index of African 
Governance, Niger ranks 28th out of 52 countries, up from 39th in the previous year. 
Between 2006 and 2011, Niger’s score improved by 6.7 points - the best relative 
performance in the sub-region.14 Other governance indicators such as the World 
Governance Indicators and CPIA also confirm this trend thanks to recent initiatives. In 
March 2011, Niger became the first country in francophone Africa to reach compliant 
status under the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI). Strong provisions of 
transparency for natural resources and public procurement15 are also enshrined in the new 
Constitution. In parallel, the new administration has required an asset declaration for 
government officials upon entry into office, established an Anti-Corruption Authority 
(HALCIA) and a corruption hotline in the Ministry of Justice, and arrested several 
government officials on corruption charges. Finally, with support from the Bank, the 
Government has developed a Governance Action Plan to (i) increase the transparency and 
accountability of the state; (ii) strengthen the independence and credibility of the justice 
system; and (iii) improve the performance of public administration.

Members of Parliament in public procurement contracts.

IV. GOVERNMENT POVERTY REDUCTION STRATEGY 2012-2015 

55. 
Niger’s new Poverty Reduction Strategy – the Plan for Economic and Social 
Development (PDES) - was approved by the Council of Ministers on August 1, 
2012.16  It represents Niger’s overarching framework for the Government’s development 
agenda.  The main focus of the PDES is on achieving economic growth of around 8 
percent over the PDES period (2012-2015). 
56. 
The PDES represents a fundamental change in policy orientation and 
institutional arrangements, responding to recent developments in Niger and the sub 
region.  In particular, in order to prevent a recurrence of the political instability 
experienced during the period 2009 – 2010, the PDES pays particular attention to the 
consolidation of the credibility and efficacy of public institutions. In the wake of political 
developments in the sub-region, priority has been given to issues of security.  The PDES 
also advocates for a more inclusive development approach that seeks to reduce regional 
disparities.  In the light of recurring food crises, the PDES pays particular attention to the 
agriculture and food security, as one of the priority programs of the government.  
57. 
The PDES targets 11 strategic results and identifies 86 programs for their 
achievement. These are clustered 
in five programmatic areas which are (i)  
Strengthening the credibility and efficiency of public institutions; (ii) Creating the 
conditions for inclusive, sustainable and balanced development; (iii) Food security and 
sustainable agricultural development; (iv) Competitive and diversified economy for 
accelerated, inclusive growth; and (v) Promotion of social development. (See details in 
Annex 20). 
58. 
The PDES was prepared through a broad-based and participative process 
and was endorsed by donors at a Round-table in Paris who pledged to support its 
implementation with US$4.8 billion. The staff of the World Bank and the IMF 
discussed the assessment of the PDES under JSAN separately. 

V. BANK GROUP PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY 

A. 
Lessons Learnt from previous CAS, Stakeholder Feedback and Gender 
Assessment 

The 2008-2011 CAS Completion Report  

59. 
Results and lessons from the 2008-2011 CAS are assessed in the CAS 
Completion Report and discussed with the Government in March 2012 (see Annex 2 
to 5).  The main conclusions of this report are summarized here.  The 2008-2011 CAS 
was built around two pillars (i) accelerating sustained growth that is equitably shared; and 
(ii) increasing access to basic services and developing human capital and two cross 

16 Subsequently, the Ministry of Planning, Regional, and Community Development also prepared and issued a Priority 
Action Plan and a Strategic Results Framework. 

16 

 
 
 
 
                                                 
cutting issues (i) demographics; and (ii)  good governance. The CAS was well aligned 
with PRSP-II.  Given the structural challenges to development in Niger, the CAS 
proposed to deliver about one third of IDA resources in the form of DPOs. 
60. 
During most of the period covered by this assessment, Niger was affected by  
a dramatic combination of events and external shocks, with adverse consequences 
on the country’s economic performance.   The CAS period comprised two episodes of 
catastrophic droughts in 2009 and 2011, and important political changes in four different 
phases: (i) pre-2009 political events phase, broadly a continuation of the previous CAS 
period; (ii) a period of severe political crisis from mid-2009 until the February 2010 
coup; (iii) a transition period with interim de facto government until the early 2011 
elections; and (iv) since 2011, renewed stability under the newly elected President and 
new government resulting from the April 2011 parliamentary election. Overall the 
performance of the CAS program is assessed as moderately satisfactory.  Bank 
performance is assessed as moderately satisfactory – satisfactory in design of the program 
and moderately satisfactory in its implementation for the Bank failed to complete a CAS 
Progress Report to adjust the CAS to new country context. 

61. 
Progress was mixed under pillar 117 with four out of five expected outcomes 
partially achieved. Through the Bank support, progress was made in clearing 
Government arrears to the private sector and introducing electronic processing of  
Government bills  to suppliers.  The Second Private Irrigation Project (PIP2) and Agro-
Sylvo-Pastoral Export and Market Development Project (PRODEX) also supported a 
significant increase in areas under irrigation and contributing in a major way to the 
development of a supply chain approach for priority commercial agriculture commodities 
and livestock products, thus paving the way for enhanced private sector involvement in 
the agriculture sector.   

62. 
Under pillar 2, five out of eight expected outcomes have been partially 
achieved.   The Basic Education Project and the FTI-Basic Education Support Project 
contributed successfully to raising overall gross primary enrolment rates (GER) above 
2011 targets.  The Institutional Strengthening and Health Sector Program supported the 
improvement in access to basic health and nutrition services of rural population; and 
contributed to setting up a Sector Wide Approach program (SWAP).   

63. 
Promoting good governance was a cross-cutting theme under the CAS.  The 
outcomes focused on strengthening economic governance and capacity to implement and 
monitor reforms and were partially achieved also.   
64. 
Finally, while progress under the cross-cutting theme “reducing the Rate of 
Population Growth” was made, the specific outcomes aimed at increasing awareness in 
family planning were only partially achieved. PRODEM has strengthened Niger's 
capacity to address the demographic challenge by building the government capacity in 
designing and implementing a nationwide multi-sector population program, increasing 

17 Pillar1 of the CAS focuses on accelerating sustainable growth that is equitably shared with key outcomes including: 
(i) ensuring macroeconomic stability; (ii) strengthening the competitiveness of supply chains; (iii) strengthening the 
sustainable management of natural resources to reduce vulnerability to desertification; (iv) improving the investment 
climate and supporting entrepreneurship; and (v) strengthening economic infrastructure for growth.

general awareness on population and reproductive health issues.   

Experience and Lessons learnt from the 2008-2011 CAS Completion Report 

65. 
Lessons learned from the implementation of the FY08-11 CAS include the 
following: (i) the strongest impact is achieved when multi-sectorial DPOs are delivered 
in parallel with sectoral operations, creating substantial synergies.  This is particularly the 
case in areas where reforms are difficult and need sustained commitment and actions 
from the Government; (ii) a programmatic DPO approach plays an important role in 
keeping the reform agenda on track and mobilizing the Government on cross-cutting 
issues in an environment of frequent external shocks and instability; (iii) long term 
involvement in one area – spanning two to three CAS periods - and substantial partner 
support by Bank, reinforces Government commitment and incentives for changes.  
66. 
In addition, the Bank Group’s involvement in one sector can often serve as 
leverage and allows the Bank Group to play its convening role with other donors. 
Furthermore a balanced approach involving addressing swiftly the critical short-term 
crisis concerns while maintaining a long-term focus on reforms necessary for reducing 
vulnerability and accelerating growth proved effective. Finally, addressing gender and 
demographic issues is a challenging undertaking. It requires a multi-sectoral and 
sustained approach over a long time horizon and underpinned by sharp social-cultural-
economic analysis and action 
67. 
Reducing Niger’s vulnerability – in particular getting its rural population 
out of the “vulnerability to weather shocks” trap – is paramount. Supporting a 
country that is highly vulnerable and prone to frequent shocks requires a balanced 
approach, addressing rapidly the critical short-term concerns while maintaining a long-
term focus on risk management. To address these challenges, Niger should not just rely 
on windfall benefits from its growing extractive industries, but scale-up agricultural  
productivity and risk management and diversify its economy. 

Stakeholder consultations and Country Survey 

68. 
In-country consultations to collect perceptions and advice on the work of the 
WBG in Niger from a diverse group of stakeholders were carried out in October 
2012 throughout five out of eight regions. Over 500 stakeholder representatives 
provided the views of the Government, civil society and organizations, community 
leaders, development partners, parliament, private sector, media, academia with a 
significant representation of women and youth. Overall, participants acknowledged the 
relevance and contributions of the Bank Group to Niger development at large. All actors 
agreed that it is very difficult to establish a hierarchy of development priorities in Niger 
due to the many cross-cutting challenges and external shocks that make the country 
highly vulnerable. The main conclusions were as follows  (see Annex 18 for more 
details): 
 
In the agriculture sector, there was a consensus on the need to create new 
opportunities in rural areas, notably for youth and to reduce migration to urban centers. 

18 

 
 
 
 
The need to improve the education sector, with a focus on quality of education 
outcomes, was a consistent and recurring theme throughout the discussions; 
 
Infrastructure and transport are considered vital for regional integration and 
economic opportunities; 
 
Corruption is seen as a major impediment to inclusive development in many 
sectors. Increasing the role of civil society actors was seen as important as a mechanism 
for assisting, communicating and monitoring Bank Group-financed projects and CPS 
implementation; 
 
Re-organizing the legislative economic framework to help create more businesses 
(especially SMEs) was a predominant theme for the private sector. 
69. 
A country team retreat held on November 2, 2012 endorsed the outcomes of the 
consultations and discussed the strategic directions to align the CPS with Government 
PDES priorities.     
70. 
Several of these issues were repeated in a Country Survey undertaken in FY 
2012.  This survey, which is described in more detail in Annex 18, shows that perceived 
development priorities place greater emphasis on corruption and public sector 
governance. Respondents report that they recognize a significant role for the Bank Group 
in the area of public sector governance. Along with governance and corruption, 
education, rural development and energy and oil development are viewed as important 
aspects of growth and/or poverty reduction in Niger. Domestic private sector 
development is seen as an important aspect of growth and also an area where respondents 
see value in Bank involvement. 
71. 
In terms of collaboration with the government and other donors, the survey 
findings suggest that the Bank Group is doing well. The importance of its future 
involvement in Niger is not questioned. Areas for improvement by the Bank include:  
greater flexibility (in terms of its products and services and in light of changing country 
circumstances); improvement in staff accessibility, responsiveness and openness in terms 
of sharing its data and other information; and greater overall speed, especially in  the 
disbursement of funds. 
72. 
Finally, the survey highlights that the Bank Group is most valued for its 
financial resources with recognition of the value of technical assistance and training 
but that there needs to be greater outreach beyond government, especially towards civil 
society. 
Gender Assessment 

73. 
A recently completed Gender Assessment highlights the need for the Bank 
Group program to be more gender-informed. The assessment reveals that currently 
only 24 percent of projects contain gender analysis; and when done, it is often weak, 
generic, and without sector or project specificity. The assessment also indicates that in 59 
percent of projects there is a disconnect between analysis and actions resulting in some 
gender-focused actions or components.  

74. With respect to indicators, many projects make an attempt to provide 

19 

 
 
gender-relevant and gender-disaggregated indicators. These include laudable efforts 
to focus on registration of women's enterprises in the Competitiveness and Growth 
project, and on disaggregating by gender involvement in local development initiatives 
(Niger Basin), distribution of ruminants (Emergency Food Security II), and households 
benefiting from social protection (Safety Net Project). 

B. 

Strategic Approach  

Overview, objectives and principles  
75. 
The proposed CPS is aligned with priorities of the Government PDES and 
aims at supporting Niger’s development as an emerging economy that is 
competitive, diversified, resilient and inclusive with enhanced opportunities for 
productive employment and improved standards of living. It provides the framework 
for Bank Group support to Niger over the next four years ending June 30, 2016. It is also 
closely aligned with the Bank’s Africa Strategy; the 2011 World Development Report on 
conflict and fragility, and the update 2014 WDR on risk.  Finally it also draws on the 
findings and lessons from several analytical pieces, including the CAS Completion 
Report, Client Survey, and feedback from stakeholder consultations.  

76. 
The Bank Group’s engagement will be guided by the following 4 principles: 
(i) Flexibility, (ii) Selectivity; (iii) Leverage; and (iv) Aid effectiveness. 

77. 
Flexibility: In view of the recurrent crises in the Sahel and dynamic nature, 
the Bank Group will seek to maximize flexibility in its engagement with Niger. The 
need for such flexibility has been highlighted in the CAS Completion Report and FY12 
Country Survey.  The Bank Group will endeavor to discern early any project 
implementation difficulties and act boldly and swiftly in undertaking corrective actions, 
including early project restructuring to avoid prolonged stays by projects in problem 
status.  
78. 
Selectivity: The Bank Group’s resources are limited relative to Niger’s needs. 
Against that backdrop, concentrating resources in a few high priority areas is 
critical.  The choice of sector or thematic intervention will be based on the following 
filters: (i) transformational impact with an emphasis on increasing competitiveness for 
inclusive growth and poverty reduction; (ii) potential impact on the key drivers of 
fragility and stability; (iii) ensuring a balance of  interventions that produce short-term 
results with interventions aimed at longer-term impact; (iv) operational feasibility; (v)  
comparative strength of the Bank Group; and (vi) impact on  Niger’s connectivity with 
regional and international markets.  
79. 
Leverage: The Bank Group will utilize its programs as a catalyst for 
leveraging other sources of financing to maximize development impact.  In this 
regard, where possible, the Bank Group will endeavor to: (i) access trust funds to finance 
analytical and advisory work; (ii) encourage co-financing of its operations by other 
development partners to scale up interventions; (iii) continue to lead the donors 
coordination and harmonization through OECD/DAC and provide the platform for other 
development partners’ interventions through the preparation of robust analytical work; 

20 

 
 
 
and (iv) work in collaboration with the IFC and MIGA to crowd-in private investments 
especially in key growth sectors/markets.  
80. 
Aid effectiveness: Niger receives about 58 percent of its investment resources 
from development partners and is thus highly impacted by the predictability of 
these resources and whether they are effectively and efficiently translated into 
results. The Bank Group in collaboration with others development partners will continue 
to assist the government in developing systems to improve service delivery, monitor and 
evaluate the impact of development programs by, among other things, promoting country 
ownership and spearheading the use of country systems, coordinating interventions and 
seeking opportunities for better division of labor amongst development partners for 
greater synergy.  

C. 

Bank Group Program  

81. 
The Bank Group recognizes that accelerating economic growth and reducing 
volatility need to be complemented by reforms to ensure that growth is inclusive and 
its benefits widely shared. Increasing per-capita incomes is the central challenge for 
Niger to reduce poverty.  Yet given the structure of its economy, poverty reducing 
economic growth will require a focus on three tightly interwoven issues: (i) focusing on 
growth which increases the productivity of males and females; (ii) reducing growth 
volatility and enhancing resilience to external shocks; and (iii) ensuring that growth is 
inclusive and widely shared.

The Bank Group will partner with other development agencies to pursue the 
following interdependent and mutually reinforcing strategic objectives articulated 
as CPS pillars: (1) promote resilient growth, (2) reduce vulnerability, and (3) 
strengthen governance and capacity for public service delivery across the board. 
The rationales for selecting these strategic pillars are grounded in the following: (i) their 

21 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
close alignment with the new priorities set by the PDES to address Niger development 
challenges, (ii) lessons learned from the implementation of the previous CAS, notably 
that long term strong engagement of the Bank Group in one area – spanning two to three 
CAS periods – reinforces Government commitment and incentives for lasting change; 
(iii) feedback from the stakeholders consultations and the results of the new country 
survey that stress greater engagement on governance (iv) and the comparative advantage 
of the Bank Group with respect to the current aid matrix (see Annex 13) to help reducing 
the aid fragmentation. The specific rationale and objectives pursued under each pillar are 
further elaborated below.

Under this CPS Pillar, the Bank Group will support the sectors that drive 
growth and have the greatest potential for creating jobs, while also supporting efforts 
to strengthen the resilience against external shocks, through a flexible mix of 
development policy lending, investment instruments, technical assistance and non-
financial services. Under Axis 4 of the PDES, the Government is committed to achieving 
strong and sustained economic growth. Recognizing the potential fiscal spillover of 
external shocks, the Bank Group will continue to support authorities in pursuing and 
maintaining policies for a stable and resilient macroeconomic environment. To this end, 
the Bank Group will pursue the following specific interventions: 

84. 
Consolidate the fiscal framework. Under the DPO series - Shared Growth Credits 
– the Bank Group together with other partners will support policy reforms to promote 
resilient growth and improve the management of oil and mining revenues, internal 
revenues and debt. More specifically the DPO series will focus on the consolidation of 
the fiscal performance through the development and implementation of plans for 
customs, tax department and reforms of debt management among other policy reforms. 

22 

 
 
 
85. 
Improve investment climate and access to finance for private sector. The Bank 
Group will spur reforms and investment to promote high potential growth opportunities 
identified by the PDES, notably in the agribusiness, oil and mining sectors, to expand and 
diversify the narrow economic base while reducing the economy’s vulnerability to 
shocks. To that end, the Bank Group will extend lines of credit to local banks, promote 
reforms to increase access to financial services for SMEs, establish PPP arrangements 
and modernize OHADA laws for an improved investment climate. The Bank Group will 
also continue supporting SMEs through matching grants and boosting the implementation 
of the financial sector strategy. The ongoing Competitiveness and Growth Support 
Project will be pursued with a focus on promoting value chains in agribusiness, livestock, 
oil and mining coupled with a continuation of the DPO series - Shared Growth Credits - 
aiming to promoting resilient private sector-led growth through policy reforms. A 
potential DPO to support reforms of WAEMU regional transport regulations governing 
the trucking industry is also under consideration.  

86. 
Increase agricultural productivity of selected crops.  The Government plans to 
achieve a forty five percent increase of cereal production by 2015 under the Axis 3 of its 
PDES. This will require a strong focus on reforms in the agriculture and livestock sectors 
which are the source of livelihood for about 80 percent of the population. To support this 
objective, the Bank Group will help male and female producers adopt improved 
agriculture technologies and drought resistant varieties of crops, support the development 
of additional irrigation schemes with drainage services, and promote feeder roads in rural 
and urban areas to connect the producers to markets. The ongoing Bank-financed 
Community Action Program (CAP) supports sustainable natural resource management 
and access to services at the local level by financing micro-projects and development 
plans prepared by communities and local government. Third phase of CAP will mainly 
support the implementation of 3N Initiative to increase agriculture productivity. The 
ongoing Agro-Pastoral Export Promotion Project and Second Emergency Food Security 
Project are helping small farmers increase the production of high-value irrigated crops, 
using low-cost technology while facilitating the export of selected crops such as cowpea 
and onion. After the closing of the ongoing projects, the Bank Group will continue to 
support this objective with a new large scale sector-wide program in FY15. Accounting 
for gender differences in access to productive inputs and respective roles in agriculture, 
the Bank Group will ensure that these operations target female beneficiaries with an 
overall aim of raising productivity and improving food security. The Bank Group will 
also extend the ongoing Transport Project through 2015 to support the movement of 
agricultural production to the markets. 

87. 
Promoting risk-based agriculture development is key to mitigating the impact of 
climatic changes and variability. Building on a recent Assessment of Agriculture Risks, 
the Bank Group will provide technical advisory services for a risk-based agriculture 
development program that helps improve resilient approaches to scaling-up sustainable 
land and water management in Niger. The Bank Group will promote climate change 
adaptation to increase resilience through the following actions: adoption of drought 
tolerant crop varieties; soil and water conservation techniques, selection of appropriate 

23 

 
 
 
 
natural resource management (NRM) techniques, irrigation, early detection and 
destruction of   desert locusts; support the Government to develop an Inclusive Green 
Growth Strategy and supporting community level interventions through food/fodder 
banks, and livestock vaccination and other veterinary services. The IFC’s Sustainable 
Business Advisory is undertaking market research on a range of private sector 
investments under the Climate Investment Fund’s Pilot Program for Climate Resilience 
(PPCR). Subject to their commercial viability, the potential investments will include: a 
mobile phone platform to deliver agro-meteorological information and market price 
information to small scale farmers; a weather index-based insurance product for rain-fed 
agriculture; expansion of vegetable production under drip irrigation; and production of 
drought-resilient seeds.  

88. 
Improvement in economic infrastructures and opportunities. The Bank Group 
will support this outcome through the development of transformative high-risk and high 
reward programs notably the Kandadji Growth Pole that aims to produce low cost 
electricity for the irrigation of 42,000 ha, and the Dosso Dry Port and the Expansion of 
the Regional Railways Program to connect Niger’s economy with its main maritime 
corridors of Cotonou and Abidjan at lower cost. More specifically a joint IFC/World 
Bank business plan will be developed to spur agribusiness opportunities offered by the 
Kandadji Growth Pole. With an additional financing, the Bank Group will continue to 
support the rehabilitation of inter-urban roads to better connect the agriculture 
productions with the markets and consumers. The Bank Group will also continue to assist 
Niger in expanding and deepening the energy and telecommunication sectors by reducing 
costs and increasing access to regional power market and telecommunication networks 
under an Energy Sector TA operation and the regional fiber optic program. To further 
deepen the knowledge base on the Regional Railways Program and support a marketable 
PPP design, the Bank Group is preparing a TA operation to support the regional 
Technical Secretariat set up by member countries to launch the Program. 

89. 
Regional synergies. Under the PDES, Niger reaffirms its commitment to comply 
with WAEMU Convergence and Stability Pact by implementing sound macroeconomic 
stability policies. To that end, the Bank Group will extend its support for macroeconomic 
stability through a DPO series – Shared Growth Credits – with a specific focus on 
implementing the new WAEMU PFM Directive and reduce the spillover of the ongoing 
Sahel crisis. Niger participates in the regional Niger Basin Water Resources Development 
project and the associated GEF-financed Reversing Land and Water Degradation Trends 
in the Niger River Basin which are, respectively, strengthening the capacity of the Niger 
River Basin Authority. Under this regional project, the Bank Group is supporting 
Kandadji Growth Pole development. Niger also participates in the second phase of the 
West Africa Agriculture Productivity project that promotes regional cooperation in 
agricultural research. Depending on IDA availability Niger could participate in WARCIP 
to improve its telecom connectivity with the rest of the world. The Bank Group is also 
supporting improvement of trade with Nigeria through Growth and Competitiveness 
Project and the development of a dry port in Dosso region to facilitate trade and transport 
with the Benin corridor. In the Transport sector, Niger is highly affected by the 
challenges faced by its partner transport, Benin, where tariffs remain punitively high; 

24 

 
 
 
 
domestic and regional regulatory reforms coupled with public and private investment in 
roads and railways are necessary. High transport prices reduce competitiveness, and 
indirectly impact growth and the job market. Depending on IDA availability, Niger could 
participate in a potential DPO to support reforms of regional transport dealing with 
WAEMU regulations governing the trucking industry. Finally the Bank Group is 
supporting Niger together with Burkina Faso, Benin and Cote d’Ivoire to expand the 
existing railways to Niamey in view of better integrating its economy with the rest of the 
sub-region and increasing its resilience to climatic exogenous shocks.

90. 
Vulnerability has to be prevented or mitigated While the focus will be on 
prevention and mitigation, in some cases mitigation and coping activities to smooth the 
effects of shocks will be the objective. Mitigating measures will require addressing the 
underlying constraints giving rise to these risks.  These include the role of demographic 
pressures, gender inequalities and widespread poverty, weak governance, lack of 
diversification of the economic basis, constraining social norms, and lack of adequate 
information/education and incentives.  
91. 
A multi-sectoral approach focused on the key underlying causes of 
vulnerability including the drivers of fragility notably agricultural risks is essential 
for reducing vulnerability and building resilience.  Most vulnerabilities have multiple 
causes and are interrelated and thus require a multi-sectoral approach.  

25 

 
 
92. 
A combination of investments, policy reforms and technical assistance 
tackling the key underlying causes of vulnerability is therefore needed.  Recognizing 
this, the Bank Group will put a special emphasis on cross-sectoral interventions, such as 
population programs and diagnostic work to support higher national awareness and action 
on demographic issues, a skills development program and a job strategy to support youth 
employability and job creation, to increase the flexibility of the labor force. These cross-
sectoral activities will be complemented by other interventions aiming at strengthening 
the resilience of the communities and reduce their vulnerability. A particular focus will 
be put on social protection and agriculture to reduce its vulnerability to weather-related 
shocks by promoting the adoption of agricultural methods that are less subject to the 
vagaries of Niger’s harsh climate. The Bank Group will pursue the objective of reducing 
vulnerability through the following actions: 
93. 
Increase access of the poor and insecure people to safety net programs.  In 
order for Niger to pull the poor and food insecure people out of the humanitarian 
dependency trap, sustainable safety net systems are needed to help identify and register 
the beneficiary household while providing them with appropriate support to meet their 
basic needs through cash transfer and cash-for-work. The Bank Group will continue to 
support the overarching objective of providing sustainable food security and nutrition for 
all Nigeriens by helping additional households to access cash transfer and cash-for-work 
programs under the ongoing Safety Net Project. To further support the social protection, 
a TA operation is underway to help strengthen the resilience of poor and food insecure 
people and build the foundations of a safety net system. Bank support to GON agriculture 
and national food security programs, notably 3N (Nigeriens Nourish Nigeriens) and the 
Dispositif National, will be considered in FY16. 

94. 
Improve resilience of populations to natural hazards, climatic change and 
variability.  The Government of Niger is committed under Axis 2 of the PDES to 
strengthen adaptive and resilience capacities, disseminate strategies for adapting to 
climate change, and adopt adequate regulations and training curricula. The Bank Group 
will continue to support this outcome through the ongoing Community Actions Program 
for Climatic Resilience (CAPCR) and the Community-Based Disaster Reduction Project. 
To that end, a climatic information platform for agricultural producers will be created to 
improve climate change resilience together with local development plans incorporating 
climate resilience features. A Land, Urban and Disaster Management Project will be 
considered in FY14 to build on the achievements of the Local Urban Development 
Infrastructures Project with a focus on multi-hazard early warning systems, land 
development and integrated flood risk management. The third phase of CAP coupled 
with an Integrated Ecosystem Management funded by the GEF will contribute to improve 
the people’s resilience to climatic change and variability, notably for those living in 
disadvantaged northern communes targeted under the Security-Development Strategy. In 
addition, IFC will be promoting climate resilience in the private sector through the Pilot 
Program for Climatic Resilience by exploring the development of a mobile phone 
platform and a weather index-based insurance product which will both serve small scale 
farmers; and expanding - through private sector financing - drip irrigation and drought 
resilient seed production. 

26 

 
 
 
95. 
Improve education and youth employment skills. Strengthening human capital 
is an integral part of any growth strategy but is also a key ingredient to alleviate the 
stresses posed by the alarming population growth and youth unemployment. Thus the 
Niger Government is committed to continued improvements in education, population and 
health services to improve socio-economic outcomes and reach the MDGs. The Bank 
Group through the Global Partnership for Education Trust Fund will continue to support 
access to basic education and improved quality of teaching. Special emphasis is placed on 
promoting girls’ participation in school and parents and communities in children’s 
education. To support the Government’s commitment to better integrate youth into the 
economy and reduce the threat they pose to the country stability under the current volatile 
security context, the Bank Group will help upgrade Technical, Vocational and Education 
Training institutions in four critical sectors and set up on-demand technical training 
programs to improve youth employability for the job market (Box 1. The skills for growth 
project - PRODEC). A jobs and employability assessment will be conducted in FY14 to 
identify the entry points and recommendations for youth job creation.  

Box 1: The Skills for Growth Project (PRODEC) 

Youth employability and job creation are a very important priority for Niger. Many employers look 
abroad for skilled workers, and the lack of skills, from basic to advanced, of domestic workers is a constraint 
to productivity, employability and job creation. To that extent Niger needs to invest in the skill development 
of its youth. Well-designed interventions in the skill development sector can promote youth employability 
and the job creation agenda, by providing the technical and other skills to make youth more employable by 
the private sector, fostering local firms to create more jobs and supporting the development of small and 
medium enterprises through entrepreneurship skills.   Constraints to job creation in Niger will also depend 
on other issues, including improving business climate, promoting investments, reinforcing infrastructure and 
labor market institutions and policies.  

The skills for growth project aims at developing skills for key economic sectors and improving youth 
employability through providing access to improved formal technical and vocational training and new 
shorter term skill development options. The project will target short-term on-demand skill development, 
apprenticeships and entrepreneurship programs for, respectively, 1,500 youth of different education level, 
3,000 out of school youth with very limited education, and 8,000 secondary and tertiary graduates, 
apprentices and would be micro entrepreneurs. Job creation would be supported by fostering local firms to 
hire the youth that they have asked to be formed through the on-demand skills development program, and 
supporting the development of small and medium enterprises through the entrepreneurship skills provided to 
the multiple target youth groups.  

By enhancing employability and job creation, the project will not only support the broad social and 
economic development of Niger but will contribute to increased security by providing unemployed and 
under-employed youth new hope and concrete tools for meaningful integration in the Niger labor market and 
society, reducing potential for unrest and involvement in violent activities. 

96. 
Increase access to clean water, sanitation, health and population services.   
Increasing access to clean water, sanitation, health and population is vital for the survival 
of the most vulnerable people. For over ten years, the Bank Group has been a prominent 
partner to Niger in the development of the water and sanitation sector. A Bank Group 
intervention under the present CPS will therefore consolidate successful achievements of 
previous interventions; generate strategic continuity and strong operational synergies 
with activities supported by the ongoing Urban Water and Sanitation Project, 
acknowledging one of the main conclusions of the CAS completion report. In the same 

27 

 
 
 
 
 
 
vein, the Bank Group will continue to support Niger through Water Sanitation Program 
TA to (i) improve programmatic conditions for scaling up rural sanitation, (ii) promote 
private sector participation in the management of small and medium-sized water supply 
systems, and sludge management facilities, and (iii) support the Ministry of Hydraulics to 
set up sustainable monitoring system to better manage investment programs. The Bank 
Group will also continue to help provide peer education to health-risk groups, sensitize 
the population on health issues and provide training opportunities to health personnel on 
family planning and reproductive health issues. Expanded coverage of basic health care 
and HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment will be pursued under the ongoing HIV/AIDS 
Support Project 2 and a new Population and Health Project will be considered for FY15 
in view of, among others, scaling up gender and population oriented programs notably 
Ecole-des-Maris and Adolescent Girls initiatives in partnership with UNFPA. To deepen 
the Bank Group’s knowledge in these areas in view of underpinning follow-up 
interventions, a health country status survey report and a Sahel Demographic study -  the 
latter currently being undertaken - will both be delivered in FY15.  

97. 
Regional synergies: Being at the cross-road between Saharan and the Sub-
Saharan Africa, Niger is hugely exposed to developments, positive and negative, in the 
sub-region. As a member of ECOWAS, Niger is also participating in regional efforts to 
resolve the ongoing military crisis in the Sahel.. Niger also participates in the ongoing 
regional studies notably on (i) Sahel Drylands Flagship Report, (ii) demography and (iii) 
the drivers of fragility in the Sahel. Going forward the Bank Group will continue to 
support Niger Food Security Programs notably 3N and Dispositif National in view of 
scaling up the benefits of this Model to WAEMU countries. Recognizing that 
demographic migration, open trade and free movement of citizens within ECOWAS are 
key factors in addressing food crises, the Bank Group will continue to monitor the market 
and prices of staples, livestock and support regional bodies e.g ECOWAS, WAEMU, 
ICRISAT, AGRYMET, CILSSS, in charge of the oversight of regional versatile stresses 
such as locust, animal diseases, drought and flood.

Faced with a heavy reform agenda, Government must improve implementation 
capacity across the board in order to enhance its legitimacy. Addressing governance and 
capacity constrains entails a focus on catalytic reforms to build strategic planning and 

28 

 
 
 
 
M&E capacity, effective contracts management and revenues collection in the natural 
resources sector, support the modernization of the public financial management system 
including the implementation of WAEMU PFM Directives, public investment and 
oversight of SOEs. In addition to the ongoing Reform Management Technical Assistance 
Project focused on PFM, the CPS envisions for FY14 a Governance and Capacity 
Building Project to improve service delivery in partnership with the other development 
partners. More specifically the Bank Group will help the Government through the 
following actions with a focus on the implementation of its Governance and Anti-
corruption strategy: 

99. 
Improve budget execution and pro-poor spending. The government is 
committed to ensure fair access of the citizens to public services that are delivered 
efficiently under Axis 1 of the PDES. To do so, the Government envisages restoring the 
credibility and improving the effectiveness of public institutions. The Bank Group will 
support this outcome through the implementation of the ongoing Reform Management 
and TA Project and Governance and Anti-corruption TA. The Bank Group will support 
this outcome with a special focus on quick wins to provide incentives for the reforms to 
stay on track. To that end, the ongoing Reform Management and TA Project will be 
complemented in FY14 with financing new capacity building project to promote greater 
governance, improve public financial management and service delivery with a focus on 
pro-poor spending in health and education. Support to the National Institute of Statistics – 
(INS) to boost capacity in the collection of quality household survey data and monitoring 
of service delivery outcomes - and cultural change will be key to achieving these 
outcomes in addition to the technical and political pre-requisites. Key Bank Group 
operations include budget support, and analytical works, notably Service Delivery 
Indicators (SDI) surveys that will monitor the quality and competency of service 
providers, a Gender Assessment that explores issues related to social norms and agency 
in Niger, and annual Public Expenditures Reviews. Consistent with WDR 2011 the Bank 
Group will work with other development partners to deliver in FY14 a Public 
Expenditures Management and Fiduciary Review 18of the security sector requested by the 
Government to inform and help improve the economic efficiency and governance of this 
sector. The review will remain within the Bank Group’s mandate in terms of scope, 
methodology and will not analyze any security specific aspects. 

100. 
Improve transparency of sector budget allocations with PDES Priorities. The 
PDES recognizes the disconnect between the strategic planning, the annual budget and its 
execution. This disconnect is furthermore exacerbated with the creation of two separate 

18 The study is responding to a formal government request in a specific security situation where security expenditures 
have significantly increased and to the need for economic consideration of the impact of such increasing security 
expenditures on the budget remaining available for the financing of economic and social development activities. The 
country has confirmed that the Bank would have legal access to the relevant information to carry out its review. The 
Bank will act in concert with an acceptable partner that has specific sector expertise; the Bank would not be making 
security sector judgment calls. On that basis the Bank has determined that the risk of carrying out this review was lower 
than the risk of not responding to the country’s request under the circumstances. The scope of the review is also 
compliant with Bank mandate: descriptive and comparative analysis of administrative procedures, practices, and 
processes, transparency and governance; retrospective, prospective and generic description of related expenditure with 
an informative focus; impact analysis of security expenditure scenarios upon economic development. It will not analyze 
the security specific aspects of the sector.  

29 

 
 
 
                                                 
ministries where one is handling the multi-year strategic planning and the other preparing 
and executing the budget without effectively collaborating with one another. To help 
improve the conjunction of sector alignment with PDES priorities, the Bank Group will 
provide support through the Reform Management TA Project and to develop a 
performance-based budgeting framework and promote competitive selection of high 
officials. The project also supports capacity building for the preparation of cross-sectoral 
and sectoral Medium Term Expenditure Frameworks as key instruments to strengthen the 
link between the PDES and the budget. Public financial management reforms supported 
through the annual DPO series also aim at enhancing fiscal transparency19, supported by 
an annual Public Expenditure Review process, which envisages an annual review of 
overall expenditure trends as well as in depth review of expenditures in a few key 
sectors.20  Furthermore, the Bank Group will support building capacity in M&E and 
design of robust indicators to improve both quantitative and qualitative analysis to better 
inform both key decision-makers and citizens of progress.  If major improvement is not 
achieved in M&E, it will delay the introduction of targeted, means-tested programs.   

101. Mainstream Gender. As noted above, gender disparities persist in Niger and are 
reinforced by the country’s development challenges which continue to pose a serious 
constraint to adopting specific measures that target women’s and girl’s access to public 
services.  These measures will be integral to reducing gaps in gender outcomes in human 
and physical capital accumulation and ensuring that females engage completely in 
Niger’s development.  The Bank Group will continue to engage with other development 
partners to support the implementation of the national gender policy and it will address 
gender gaps notably by improving the education opportunities of girls, fostering activities 
that reduce incentives for girls to marry early, and promoting the ongoing bold 
community-level communication initiatives such as “Club d’Ecoute” which was 
conceived by FAO and “L’école des maris” and “Adolescent Girls” piloted by UNFPA 
to improve women’s agency. These initiatives have opened communication channels 
between men and women and fostered exchanges on a wide range of reproductive health 
and economic empowerment topics. The exchanges have been effective in improving 
factual knowledge on the links between cultural practices and potential negative 
consequences on women’s welfare and they may be instrumental in changing incentives 
and relaxing social norms –critical to improving the ability of men and women to express 
their preferences and to take action on their own behalf.  Moreover, the Bank Group will 
lobby for and support increased gender-sensitive programs from technical ministries that 
can partner with the Ministry of Population. This focus will improve women’s 
opportunities for acquiring economic assets and building their productive capacity. 
Consistent with WDR 2012 the Bank Group will strive to reach a rate of 100 percent of 
new operations being considered gender-sensitive. This would involve extensive sharing 
and learning among TTLs of good practices, pitfalls to address gender across the entire 
portfolio, and focusing on three approaches: (1) devoting a CPPR during the CPS period 
to examining the gender impact of all new operations; (2) ensuring that the MTR of all 

19 This includes support for the transposition and implementation of the WAEMU directives on public financial 
management, including that on fiscal transparency, as well as support for regular procurement audits and their 
publication.  The government is also committed to publish quarterly budget execution reports. 
20 The 2012 Public Expenditure Review, which is currently being finalized, focuses on the education, health, and rural 
development sectors.  For 2013, a focus on financial management in the security sectors is envisaged. 

30 

 
 
                                                 
new projects specifically focus on gender impacts; and (3) increasing the use of gender-
relevant analysis in ESW/AAA work in order to build on the gender knowledge base. 

102. 
Improve governance: while Niger governance indicators have steadily improved 
over the last two years, there is still a long way for the citizens to enjoy the outcomes as 
suggested by the results of the Country Survey and stakeholder consultations. Inefficient 
service delivery is still perceived as the manifestation of corruption and poor governance. 
With the assistance of the Bank Group, Niger completed an assessment on governance 
and corruption whose results are translated into an Action Plan to improve governance. 
The Bank Group will continue to support the governance and anti-corruption reforms 
initiated by Government such as implementing the EITI-post-compliance program – (see 
Annex 22); strengthening transparency and accountability in the public sector in 
particular through making information widely available (audits, public accounts laws, 
budget laws, performance contracts); involving key stakeholders in the roll-out of PFM 
reforms and deploying in other ministries the feedback mechanisms such as the hotline 
initiated in the justice sector.   

D. 

Delivering the Bank Group’s Program 

103. This strategy will be implemented using the traditional instruments of the Bank 
Group: (i) partnerships with stakeholders; (ii) knowledge for development solutions; and 
(iii) finance.  

104. Knowledge for development solutions: The Bank Group’s support for reforms 
in Niger is informed by various analytical works. Going forward, knowledge will be 
generated to further assist Niger in service delivery and public capacity building as well 
as supporting the two pillars of the Bank Group’s strategy with a focus on critical cross-
cutting themes such as gender, employment and jobs, vulnerability to natural shocks, land 
tenure, population pressure, and security. The Bank Group will ensure that the results of 
analytical work contribute to the public debate on major policy issues and are adequately 
disseminated with other development partners. As much as feasible, the Bank Group will 
strive to translate its knowledge products into development solutions through new 
lending and operational technical assistance proposed under Table 4. 

105. Finances: The Bank Group will use its financing instruments to support 
policy and institutional changes that will influence development. A mix of 
Development Policy Operations and Investment Lending will be the main financing 
instruments to foster policy reforms informed by knowledge products. Knowledge 
products and provision of technical assistance will be financed by the Bank, by partnering 
with other donors, by leveraging trust funds, and IDA resources. The IFC will 
strategically leverage its engagement to bring new partners on board in the developing 
value chains and niches. Where feasible MIGA will provide partial guarantee to private 
investors to leverage FDI under PPP agreements.  

106. During this CAS period, the Bank Group will continue to provide strong IDA 
support to Niger through available IDA resources, IFC funding and guarantees 
opportunities presented to MIGA. The CPS period spans across 
two IDA 

31 

 
 
 
 
 
 
replenishment periods (FY13-14 in IDA16 and FY15-16 in IDA17). The indicative IDA 
allocation available in FY13-14, which is the first half of the four year CPS, is estimated 
at around US$320 million (SDR207.5 million). The indicative envelope for the second 
half of CPS period, covering FY15-16 program presented in Table 4, is estimated to be 
about US$332 million (SDR216 million). Therefore, overall indicative IDA allocation for 
the four years of the CPS is estimated to be about US$652 million (SDR423.5 million). 
The final allocations may vary depending on: (i) total IDA resources available, (ii) the 
country’s performance rating, GNI per capita, and population; (iii) the terms of IDA 
assistance (grants/credits) and the allocation deductions associated with MDRI debt 
relief; (iv) the performance, other allocation parameters, and IDA assistance terms for 
other IDA borrowers; (v) the decision on the post-conflict allocation for IDA17; and (vi) 
the number of IDA-eligible countries. Also, the IDA allocation is provided in SDR terms, 
while the US dollar equivalent amount is provided at the applicable prevailing rate at the 
time of approval. From FY13 onward Niger is receiving 45 percent of its IDA allocation 
on grant terms and 55 percent on credit terms.  

107. Lending instruments: In the spirit of harmonization and selectivity, the 
lending portfolio will increasingly move toward programmatic and multi-sectoral 
approaches.  Following the satisfactory implementation of two multi-donor programs for 
water and health, the Bank Group will continue to support programmatic approaches 
through SWAPs, PERs and DPLs. Furthermore the Bank Group will also strive to 
consolidate the portfolio by forging synergy between sectors through transformative 
programs that bring together several sectors to deliver key social and economic services. 
In the same vein, the volume of the portfolio will gradually be reduced by integrating no 
more than one investment lending per fiscal year while discouraging extension of projects 
not deemed indispensable and phasing out single sector type projects at their closing.  

108. The CPS proposes to explore access to additional funding through scaled-up 
initiatives in the Africa region, depending on financing needs and absorption 
capacity. The indicative IDA lending envelope is flexible and can be calibrated to 
respond to the pace of reforms and progress as reflected in the upward trend in the 
Country Performance and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) index, particularly in the areas 
of economic management and governance, and portfolio performance. However, there 
continue to be downside risks and the IDA program could be adjusted in case of policy 
slippages and the pace of reforms, particularly through the sizing and timing of the DPO. 
The support for proposed sector operations is also contingent on reaching agreement on 
sector strategies among the donors and the Government.  

109. The adoption of a programmatic approach to lending and AAA activities is 
intended to help reduce fragmentation and to ensure coherence and synergies across 
the main areas of Bank Group support.  In particular, a programmatic development 
policy series (annual Shared Growth Credits) is a key instrument to help the authorities to 
prioritize and implement reforms in the CPS focus areas, and generate synergies with the 
Bank’s investment support by helping improve efficiency at the sector level.  Annual 
Public Expenditure Reviews would not only seek to ensure that the Bank’s financial 
support is well aligned and integrated into the overall government expenditure program, 

32 

 
 
 
  
but also support the productive use of all government resources.  Finally, a demand 
driven policy notes series is intended to provide real time advice in the CPS focus areas 
and expand the space of policy options considered in the policy dialogue. 

E. 

Aligning Current Portfolio 

110. As of end of December 2012 the Niger portfolio comprises 13 active projects 
amounting to US$ 524million across sectors: urban sector (22 percent), human 
development (12 percent), rural development (28 percent), public sector (24 percent), 
private sector (9 percent) and transport (5 percent). Niger also participates in two 
regional projects for about US$250 million. The FY12 disbursement ratio for 
investment operations stood at 23.1 percent. Total disbursements reached US$126.8 
million of which US$65.3 million is for DPO. The overall quality of portfolio remains 
moderately satisfactory or above over the recent two years and is regularly discussed with 
the Government, CSOs and other stakeholders during annual CPPRs. The submission of 
interim financial reports to the Bank is timely and the reports are of acceptable quality.  
During the last two years, Niger has achieved 100 per cent fiduciary compliance with 
regard to submission of audit reports against the set target of 90 percent for the Africa 
Region.  Most of the audits opinions were unqualified and control weakness have been 
resolved through follow up on the implementation of the auditor’s recommendations 
111. Key systemic issues affecting the performance of the portfolio include (i) weak 
internal control environment of the implementing units, (ii) procurement delays - 
especially at evaluation of tenders and signing stages, (iii) institutional arrangements 
challenges for operations supporting sector programs, (iv) ineffective monitoring and 
evaluation systems, and (v) inappropriate incentive mechanisms for civil servants to 
dedicate full attention to the implementation of development projects. An action plan 
agreed upon after the 2012 CPPR to resolve these issues is being implemented in close 
coordination with the government.  
112. The Bank Group is conducting an assessment of the use of country systems 
(UCS) with a strong interest of the other development partners. Ultimately the Bank 
Group and development partners expect to reach an agreement with the Government to 
foster greater use of the national systems notably procurement, budgeting, reporting and 
external controls. To that end, the Bank Group is supporting the Cour des Comptes and 
the Procurement Office – ARMP - to improve their capacity through two newly approved 
IDF grants. 
113. To respond to the multiple exogenous shocks of the past two years, the Bank 
Group demonstrated great flexibility and responsiveness by providing just-in-time 
advisory services and technically adjusting some of the existing operations. 
Specifically, to address the fiscal shortfall resulting from the effects of the Libyan crisis 
and the food shortages, in FY12 the Bank provided US$15 million in supplemental 
budget support and technically adjusted four existing projects (Community Action 
Program, Agro-Pastoral Export and Market Development, Social Safety Net and Second 
Emergency Food Security Support) under a U$15 million rapid response compact to 
provide cash transfers, cash-for-work and micro-project opportunities to help reintegrate 

33 

 
 
 
the returnees from Libya and Côte d’Ivoire. Under the proposed CPS the Bank Group 
will continue to further response flexibly to demands and explore built-in flexible 
mechanisms for new lending to address exogenous shocks in a timely manner. 
114. While Niger is a priority country for the Multilateral Investment Guarantee 
Agency (MIGA), having become its 177th member country, there is currently only 
one guarantee operation for a private investor in Niger. Niger's membership in MIGA 
means that direct foreign investment into the country is eligible for the agency’s political 
risk insurance. This insurance protects investments against the risks of transfer 
restriction, expropriation, breach of contract, non-honoring of sovereign financial 
obligations, and war and civil disturbance. Investors from Niger going into other 
developing countries may also receive coverage for their investments from MIGA. 
115. The International Finance Corporation (IFC)’s strategy in Niger is selective 
and has focused on actively developing projects in sectors such as agribusiness, 
manufacturing and infrastructure; forging partnerships with local banks to foster joint 
ventures aimed at supporting these projects with long-term local currency facilities to 
banks and NBFIs; long term credit facilities to financial intermediaries to allow them to 
provide long term facilities to their clients while strengthening their capital base as well 
as developing micro and SME finance products to support the microfinance and SME 
sectors. IFC will also offer: (i) trade finance facilities to banks supporting the trading 
activities of their MSMEs clients; (ii) risk sharing facilities to banks supporting the 
growth of their SME and agribusiness portfolios. To ensure that economic recovery is 
inclusive and sustainable, focus will be on SME capacity building. The Africa for Micro 
and SMEs (AMSME) program with local banks is designed to substantially increase the 
number and value of outstanding SME loans. IFC will also follow up on selective PPP 
opportunities. IFC is already advising the government on the implementation of a dry 
port project in Dosso and Niamey. Three reputable pre-qualified bidders have expressed 
their interest in the project. Key pending customs reforms are essential for any chance of 
closing the project successfully. IFC has started providing assistance to the Government 
of Niger for improving the country’s business climate. To this end, the Investment 
Climate Advisory Services in Africa team has delivered in April 2012 a reform matrix to 
the Government, including short and medium-long term recommendations. IFC will 
continue to support the implementation of these recommendations in particular through 
cross support to the Competitiveness and Growth Support Project.  

F. Managing Program Implementation 

116. The proposed FY13-FY16 CPS program will be implemented by government 
implementing organization (IO) and Project Implementation Units (PIUs) with close 
support by WBG teams. Due to the existing capacity limitations and other structural 
issues of the public administration, most PIUs are still not fully mainstreamed into the 
respective implementing organization. It will be crucial to build mechanisms that would 
allow the transfer for knowledge and skills related to project management prior to 
mainstreaming PIUs. In the meantime the Bank Group will continue to support greater 
use of country systems and involve CSOs in project implementation and monitoring. 
In addition to the close follow-up on implementation by sector teams, the 

117. 

34 

 
 
program implementation will be continuously reviewed through annual Country 
Program Performance Reviews. Progress on the implementation of the proposed CPS 
will be analyzed in the course of a mid-term review and subsequent elaboration of a CPS 
Progress Report. Media and the Parliament Network on Bank Group –IMF programs will 
continue to be involved in view of increasing ownership and oversight of the population. 

G. 

Partnerships and Donor Coordination 

118. The Bank Group engagement will strengthen partnerships with national, 
regional, and global players. In its engagement, the Bank Group will support stronger 
dialogue between the public and private sector and involve CSO/NGO in strengthening 
social accountability. Partnership with key development partners and regional bodies that 
have demonstrated comparative advantages in priority areas for the Bank Group will be 
nurtured and fully exploited to greater effect in delivering the CPS. The Bank Group is 
co-leading a new mapping of partnership and division of labor amongst the OECD/DAC 
to better leverage Donors’ support to achieve greater synergy and impact. Similar 
outreach is also underway with regional bodies such as CILSS, ECOWAS and UEMOA 
where Niger plays an important role on regional challenges such as security in the Sahel 
and food security.  

119. The development partners’ community in Niger is comprised of traditional 
and non-traditional donors. The OECD/DAC group is the umbrella coordination and is 
co-chaired by the Bank Group and UNDP. Through this arrangement, the Bank Group 
and UNDP have coordinated the support of development partners in support of the 
development of the  PDES. A Joint Consultative Commission Government - Donors 
under the leadership of the Prime Minister also meets up to four times a year depending 
on the emerging issues, e.g food insecurity last February and the flood crisis last August. 
The Bank Group is leading the harmonized budget support approach involving the 
European Union and the African Development Bank; France and Denmark have 
expressed interest to join. The mapping of thematic groups consistent with PDES and 
division of labor amongst the development partners is being considered to increase 
synergy and reduce aid fragmentation. Annex 13 provides the tentative configuration 
under discussion.  

H. Monitoring and Evaluation 

120. The first draft of the CPS Results Matrix (Annex 1) uses Niger’s PDES 
Results framework as its starting point, and narrows down the range of outcomes to 
those that the Bank intend to influence directly through its interventions over the 
CPS period.  It illustrates the country strategic objectives to which the CPS outcomes 
seek to contribute.  Achievement of the results of the proposed outcomes will depend to a 
large extent on on-going programs and speed with which planned programs are 
developed and implemented. The CPS results matrix will be used during implementation 
to monitor progress toward the achievement of the CPS outcomes.   

35 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
121. Annual CPPRs will be organized to align project results with the CPS results 
matrix, assess progress in achieving CPS outcomes, and address risks and systemic 
issues that might hinder portfolio performance and achievement of CPS outcomes.  
Special attention will be paid to collecting gender-sensitive indicators, identifying 
problem projects and constraints to disbursements.   At mid-term, a CPS Progress Report 
will be prepared,  reviewing progress towards the CPS outcomes and assessing whether 
they remain relevant to the country strategic objectives, given country conditions in the 
very volatile Sahel context. A Completion Report will be prepared at the end of the CPS 
implementation to feed into the next CPS cycle.  

122. To the extent possible, the CPS monitoring framework will be linked with 
PDES M&E Framework, which requires an integrated M&E system to collect data 
from different sources to track progress of a set of selected outcome indicators and 
report on results achieved. Hence, during the CPS implementation, the Bank Group will 
focus on complementing and enhancing the government’s results-based monitoring and 
evaluation capacities. Toward that end, the Bank Group will work with the Government 
and civil society to increase demand for M&E information at national, regional, and local 
levels through linking planning, budgeting, and reporting with results.  The Bank Group 
will help build Niger’s M&E systems and capacities at national and sector levels, as well 
as Niger’s overall capacity for statistical data collection and regular reporting through an 
IDF project. The Bank Group will collaborate with the INS to collect detailed panel 
household survey data in 2014.  Panel survey data will be an important first in Niger and 
it will improve understanding about the dynamic impact of exogenous shocks on 
households. 

Box 2: Evolution of Statistical Capacity Building in Niger 

Measuring advances made in poverty alleviation and other indicators of non-monetary welfare in Niger is critical for 
determining whether the country is moving in the right direction and more specifically whether Niger is making 
progress towards the achievement of development outcomes identified in its PRSPs.  The Bank Group and the Niger 
National Institute of Statistics (INS) have been engaged in a fruitful collaboration to promote the development of 
statistical planning and overall capacity over time.  The Niger country team has successfully integrated the Niger INS 
into several important initiatives focusing on improved statistical management and survey data quality.   

With support from the first set of development policy operations, the Niger Rural and Social Policy Reform Grant 
(RSRC), the INS obtained a grant from the WB Statistical Capacity Trust Fund (TFSCB) in 2007 to prepare and 
implement its first national statistical development strategy (NSDS).  The NSDS enabled the INS to articulate a 
comprehensive vision for priority data needs to monitor PRSP and MDG indicators with identified support from 
development partners for specific survey operations and relevant training of its professional staff on overall statistical 
program management and specific processes in survey design and analysis. The plan was successfully implemented 
from 2008 -12 in tandem with its second PRSP.   The RSRC identified several policy measures to strengthen operations 
at INS including the adoption of a law that provided semi-autonomous administrative status to INS enabling the 
Institute to plan and execute activities in closer alignment with its data monitoring needs and to hire qualified 
professional staff as needed for these objectives.  The RSRC also highlighted a measure to align the INS budget 
allocation with the survey activities and training identified in the NSDS.   

The INS has obtained support to build capacity in the measurement of activity in selected sectors including household 
consumption, access to public services and social outcomes, and the informal sector.  This assistance has buoyed 
capacity in survey design and methodology, data processing and dissemination, and analysis.   The Bank Group 
selected Niger as one of seven African countries to join the LSMS-Gates Initiative, a household survey project to build 
increased knowledge on activities in the agricultural sector and their linkage to household welfare and poverty 
reduction.   Niger conducted its first survey in 2011 and it will track those same household respondents and repeat the 
survey in 2014.  The Initiative offers Niger the opportunity to develop expertise in panel data collection- a first for 
Niger INS- which will improve measurement of poverty dynamics and long term impact of economic shocks.  Most 

36 

 
 
 
 
 
 
recently, INS has embarked on the preparation of its second NSDS with the support of the TFSCB.  This work will be 
aligned with the adoption of Niger’s third PRSP and the Niger CPS 2013-16. 

Based on past achievements, INS has proved to be a viable partner and the CPS 2013-16 will endeavor to build further 
capacity in data collection processes, monitoring, and data analysis at INS  and in the sectoral statistical units with 
whom INS partners to monitor the PRSP.  Rigorous monitoring of Niger’s development programs depends on the 
availability of both timely, high quality administrative data and survey data.  The CPS will reinforce statistical 
management and expertise in specific data collection and analysis activities in its proposed Governance & Capacity 
Building Project to be developed in FY14. The CPS will leverage this support through the identification of trust funds 
(TFSCB, multi-year Trust Funds) to undergird overall capacity and to build capacity in specific initiatives, including 
the use of mobile survey technologies. Given the fragile political and economic landscape of Niger, it will be important 
to build capacity for rapid assessment of potential impacts of shocks and public opinion responses.    INS requires 
further support to build analytical capacity of its survey data which is essential for ensuring empirically-based policy 
design.  The Niger team will build analytical capacity through increased collaboration with INS in its analytical work 
program, especially poverty monitoring activities.  Collaboration will also instill ownership in the GON of these 
products and ensure their integration into public policy design.    

VI. MANAGING RISKS 

123. The success of this strategy may be hampered by the four foreseeable major 
risks below for which specific mitigation measures are also discussed. In addition, the 
Bank Group will encourage inclusion of contingent emergency response components21 in 
selected existing and/or new investment projects. The respective Legal Agreements will 
enable the rapid drawdown of funds via these components to meet emergency needs. 
These contingent components will also be envisaged in the framework of Immediate 
Response Mechanism.22 The Bank Group will also use innovative financing mechanisms 
such as Crises Response Window (CRW23) to provide timely solutions against 
vulnerability when crisis arise. 
124. Sahel crisis and security risks: Although the current coalition government has so 
far demonstrated its ability to take proactive measures to mitigate the spillover of the 
Libyan crisis, the Sahel crisis poses a major threat to the political stability of Niger. The 
ongoing military intervention in neighboring Mali coupled with the intensification of 
Boko Haram activities in Nigeria pose serious risks to the stability of Niger. The 
Government of Niger is playing an active role with the international community to 
resolve the Mali crisis. The Bank Group will support these efforts through the 
implementation of the National Strategy for Development and Security with a PER and 
Fiduciary Review of the security sector and supporting under CAP III 19 communes that 
are prone to increased insecurity and civil unrest. Micro-projects primarily targeting 
women and youth will be promoted to expand economic opportunities and reduce the 
temptation to resort to violence and criminal means. A CPS Progress Report will take 
into account evolving developments and the need to adapt to changing country context.

125. Climatic exogenous shocks pose high risks. Droughts, locust infestation, flood 
and other exogenous shocks could limit the implementation of the CPS. To mitigate this 
risk, the Bank Group continue together with other partners to support disaster risk 
management and climatic adaptation activities through a new project in view of reducing 
Niger’s vulnerability to such shocks. In addition the Bank Group will support the 
Government to better monitor disaster risks, develop prevention and preparedness 
capacities and tools.  

126. Capacity constraints are an issue at all levels of the public sector. Weak 
capacity and 
lack of coordination within 
the Cabinet constrain 
the pace of 
implementation of Donor-supported programs. The creation of a new Ministry of 
Planning distinct from the Ministry of Finances has increased the complexity of policy 
dialogue and reform implementation. The ongoing coordination between OECD/DAC 
and the Government serves to mitigate this risk. The Bank Group, as Co-Chair of the 
OECD/DAC, will continue to play an active role to promote Government ownership and 
harmonization among development partners. In addition, the proposed program will serve 
to mitigate this risk by: (i) sustaining reforms that will generate stronger capacity in PFM 
and governance; (ii) concentrating on a limited number of policy areas; and (iii) agreeing 
on critical technical assistance required to overcome weaknesses identified in various 
institutional capacity assessments, (iv) translating knowledge products into operational 
development solutions through technical assistance where feasible. In addition a 
Governance and Capacity Building Project is proposed to complement joint donors’ 
efforts to help the Government address the capacity challenges that are paramount. 

127. Natural resources related risks: Mineral revenues can be volatile and destabilize 
the macroeconomic framework and implementation of reforms supported by the Bank 
Group. Alternatively the prospects of increase production of uranium and oil could result 
in Dutch Disease with the negative effects on agriculture. Similarly failure in improving 
the business environment is another risk that could compromise the Program. The CPS 
supports 
the diversification and competitiveness of Niger economy 
to reduce 
vulnerability to such shocks and its impact on the Bank Group Program. The 
concentrated ownership of natural resources investments and the asymmetry between the 
extractive industries and the government’s capacity have contributed to the existence of 
multiple areas of risk along different stages of the natural resource value chain. The most 
critical are the negotiation and award of licenses and contracts; the monitoring of 
contracts; the mobilization of revenues; and the financing of development programs.  The 
Government has put in place a certain number of measures to mitigate governance risks 
in extractive industries, including: (i) publication of mining and oil contracts in the 
official national gazette; (ii) adoption of the National Resources Charter; (iii) transfer of 
15% of natural resource revenues to extractive zones; and (iv) EITI conformity. The 
results-based Governance and Capacity Building operation foreseen by the CPS will 
contribute to mitigating these risks through strengthening the government’s capacity to 
negotiate contracts, monitor the operations, and invest natural resource rents for 
sustainable development.

Summary 

1. 
This Country Assistance Strategy Completion Report (CASCR) assesses program 
performance and Bank performance with the FY08-11 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for 
Niger, which was discussed by the Board of Executive Directors on April 29, 2008 (Report No. 
43443-NE).  This assessment covers a period up to December 31, 2011, extending slightly 
beyond FY01126.   During most of the years covered by this assessment, Niger had to face a 
dramatic combination of events and external shocks - some of which were not entirely 
unexpected.  But few could have foreseen that all those events would occur simultaneously.  

2. 
Niger’s performance has been affected by those events - but the overall impact could 
have been much more profound.  The country‘s achievements, in terms of economic growth and 
fulfilling the  objectives of its Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP), fall short of the original 
and very ambitious expectations, but are still encouraging considering 
the negative 
circumstances.  Overall the performance of the CAS program is assessed as moderately 
satisfactory.  On the basis of the self-evaluation conducted in early 2012 and slightly updated in 
the context of the next CPS, Bank performance is assessed as moderately satisfactory – 
satisfactory in design of the program and moderately satisfactory in its implementation for the 
Bank failed to complete a CAS Progress Report to adjust the CAS to the new country context. 

3. 
Lessons learned include inter alia that the strongest impact is achieved when multi-
sectoral Development Policy Operations (DPOs) are delivered in synergy with parallel sectoral 
operations in areas where reforms are difficult and need sustained commitment and actions from 
the Government.  The strong impact of a long-term Bank involvement in specific areas and the 
effectiveness of well-focused budget support with strong analytical underpinnings have been 
confirmed once more.  The difficulty of addressing effectively gender and demographic issues 
has also again been highlighted.    

4. 
Niger faces the risk of an average sluggish growth – where growth stalls at around the 
(still) very high rate of population growth and poverty decreases only very slowly. A steady GDP 
growth rate of 5 percent and above will be necessary coupled with a steady reduction of 
population growth.  For the next CAS program, the Bank engagement should be comprehensive 
with activities boosting sustained and inclusive economic growth and employment generation, 
reducing vulnerability to climate change and other external shocks and more broadly the volatility 
of growth (i.e. through the diversification of the economy), and enhancing good governance.  
Absorptive capacity constraints - could be felt more acutely unless stronger efforts succeed in   
modernizing rapidly Niger’s Administration.  The new Bank instrument – Program for Results 
(P4R) could be introduced as a pilot in selected sectors27.  

26 The preparation of the next CAS has been delayed, partly because of the political events of 2009-011. Preparation of 
this next CAS should coincide with the finalization of the Niger’s third Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP-III).   

27 Such as rural development and food security.

Context and Objectives of the CAS 

5. 
Niger is one of the poorest countries in the world. With a limited natural and human 
resource base it faces tremendous challenges and pressures.  It is a large landlocked, mostly 
desert country with a population of about 16 million people.  It ranked 186th out of 187 countries 
on UNDP’s Human Development Index in 2011, with a Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per 
capita in Parity Purchasing Power (PPP) terms of US$680, one of the lowest also in Africa.  Head 
count poverty in 2007/2008, was estimated at 60.8 percent overall and at 65 percent in rural areas.  
About 30 percent of the population is extremely poor.  Poverty is exacerbated by inequality which 
affects girls, women and children disproportionately. Its population is growing at one of the 
fastest rate in the world (3.3 percent/annum) with 47 percent of its population under the age of 
1528.  Niger’s economic growth is constrained by a combination of factors: agricultural 
production highly exposed to extreme weather conditions like droughts, heat waves, and 
occasional floods, plus locust invasions, as well as inadequate irrigation and the limited use of 
modern inputs; its dependence on a narrow economic base with agricultural and mineral 
commodity exports leaves the economy vulnerable to price shocks; economic diversification is 
hampered by inadequate road and transport networks and the high cost of doing business due 
inter alia to weak financing systems, a small national market, poor judiciary and legal practices, 
weak private sector support institutions and a low-skilled workforce.  As a landlocked country 
more than 1000 km away from the nearest seaport, its exports and imports also face high 
transport costs. Only about 12 percent of its land is arable and there is constant overuse of scant 
natural resources. About 80 percent of the population depends on rain-fed agriculture and 
livestock. Niger’s high vulnerability to droughts and other crop failures regularly leave a high 
share of the population food insecure.  Sporadic rebel movements in the north of the country, 
kidnappings by Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQMI) and instability in neighboring 
countries such as Libya and Cote d’Ivoire added to those pressures and recurrent internal political 
instability.  

6. 
Nevertheless since 2000 the country has witnessed improvements in both economic and 
social indicators, with a few notable achievements in education and health indicators29.  Also, 
Niger is endowed with important mineral resources such as uranium, gold, and only recently 
exploited, oil.  Niger is the fifth largest producer of uranium in the world and is expected to triple 
its production by 2018.  Still, reaching the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) is a 
formidable challenge. Progress is predicated on effective and efficient utilization of national 
resources and donor assistance funds.  Niger’s progress towards the MDGs since 1990 is 
illustrated in Annex 3 of CASCR full report. 

7. 
As the FY08-11 CAS was being prepared, the Government adopted its second generation 
Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper, PRSP-II, covering the 2008-2012 period.   It was prepared 
through a broad-based participatory process and includes all the main objectives of the PRSP-I 30 
of December 2001. It emphasizes the priority of creating an enabling environment for accelerated 

28 At current rates growth the population would reach about 54 million by year 2050. It is a race against time as Niger adds around 
450,000 extra mouths to feed each year 
29 For example the primary gross enrollment rate increased from 25 percent in 1991 to 54 percent in 2005; primary completion rate 
grew from 18 percent in 1990 to 40 percent in 2005; infant mortality rate declined from 126/1,000 live births to 81/1,000 in 2006. 
30 Centered on four pillars: (i) putting in place a macroeconomic framework which ensures economic and financial stability while 
promoting sustainable and robust growth; (ii) developing the productive sectors, especially in rural areas, to mitigate vulnerability and 
stimulate income generation; (iii) improving the access of the poor to quality social services, and (iv) strengthening institutional and 
individual capacity within and outside government, at the central and local level. It also aimed to address cross-cutting issues of 
gender, governance and stakeholder participation. 

50 

 
 
 
 
                                                 
economic growth - at an ambitious rate of 7 percent per year in order to reach the MDGs by 2015.  
It is articulated around seven strategic pillars: (i) strong, diversified, sustainable and job-creating 
growth; (ii) equitable access to quality social services; (iii) addressing the demographic challenge; 
(iv) reducing inequalities and strengthening social protection for vulnerable groups; (v) 
developing infrastructure; (vi) promoting high quality governance; and (vii) ensuring the effective 
implementation of the strategy. The two cross-cutting issues of good governance and of 
demographics are thus also specifically addressed in PRSP-II.  

8. 
The 2008-2011 CAS presented to the Board on April 29, 2008, was built around two 
pillars: (i) accelerating sustained growth that is equitably shared; and (ii) increasing access to 
basic services and developing human capital; and two cross cutting issues: (i) demographics and 
(ii)  good governance. The CAS was well aligned with PRSP-II – despite a different clustering 
around a smaller number of pillars as explained below.  The alignment of the CAS pillars with the 
PRSP pillars is detailed in Table 1- Summary of CAS Program Self-evaluation. In terms of 
instruments the CAS proposed to deliver about one third of IDA resources in the form of DPOs.   

9. 
To achieve the first CAS strategic objective of accelerating sustainable and shared 
growth, the Bank seek to promote the key sectors that drive growth and have the greatest 
potential for creating jobs - such as the agro-pastoral and mining sectors - while also supporting 
efforts to strengthen the private sector, improve the business climate and access to regional and 
global commercial opportunities through DPOs, investment instruments, technical assistance 
(TA) and non-financial services. This is in line with PRSP-II Pillar 1 (Achieve strong, diversified 
and sustainable growth that creates jobs) and Pillar 5 (Endow the country with economic 
infrastructure to promote growth). To achieve the second CAS objective of developing human 
capital, the Bank is supporting access to basic education and improved quality of teaching; 
expanded coverage of basic health care and HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment; and enhanced 
protection for the most vulnerable groups. This pillar is in line with PRSP-II Pillar 2 (Equitable 
access to social services); and Pillar 4 (Reduce inequalities and strengthen social protection for 
the poorest).  The cross-cutting challenges tackled by the CAS essentially coincide with PRSP-II 
Pillar 3 (slow down population growth) and Pillar 6 (promoting good governance).  

10. 
This CAS is the first results-based CAS for Niger. The results-based framework 
comprises 15 main outcomes aligned with PRSP objectives and MDGs.  Bank support was 
planned in the following areas under the two pillars and two cross-cutting themes, with the 
corresponding major outcomes:  

 Pillar I: Accelerating Sustainable Growth that is Equitably Shared: supporting key 
sectors that drive growth and have the greatest potential for creating jobs, with policies 
and investments to promote “growth clusters,” such as agro-pastoral products and exports 
and mining; strengthen economic infrastructure services, including irrigation, transport, 
and municipal services; improve the business and investment climate; and strengthen 
regional integration. Outcomes: 
1. Macroeconomic stability maintained.  
2. Competitiveness of supply chains strengthened. 
3. Sustainable management of natural resources strengthened.  
4. Investment climate and support of entrepreneurship strengthened.  
5. Economic infrastructure to promote growth, access to services and regional 
integration strengthened.  

 Pillar II: Developing Human Capital through Equal Access to Quality Social Services: 
supporting access to basic education and improved quality of teaching and expanded 

51 

 
 
 
 
 
 
coverage of basic health care and HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment; and providing 
technical input for better targeting of social protection to the most vulnerable groups, 
through a mix of financial and analytical support. Outcomes: 
6. Increased access to basic education and improved quality.  
7. Improved access of the rural population to basic health and nutrition services. 
8. Improved coverage and use of HIV/AIDS prevention services and treatment. 
9. Increased access to safe drinking water and sanitation. 
10. Increased access of urban residents to basic infrastructure services 
particularly in disadvantaged areas. 
11. Gender inequity reduced, as evidenced by improved girls’ access to education 
and health services.  
12. An effective food security and social protection strategy in place. 
13. Government and farmers better prepared to deal with natural disasters. 

 Cross-cutting theme 1: Addressing demographic issues: Slow down population 
growth. Outcome:  
14. Increased awareness of and access to family planning. 

 Cross-cutting theme 2: Promoting Good Governance and Fighting Corruption. With 
an emphasis on economy and financial management and capacity building. Outcome: 
15. Strengthened economic governance and capacity to implement and monitor 
reform.  

11. 
The CAS was strongly influenced by the previous CAS approved in 2003. That CAS was 
itself aligned on PRSP-I and supported in particular three of its four pillars31: (i) Pillar 1: ensuring 
economic/financial stability while promoting growth; (ii) Pillar 2: developing the productive 
sectors, especially in rural areas, to mitigate vulnerability and stimulate income generation; and 
(iii) Pillar 3: improve access of the poor to quality social services. A large number of activities 
started prior to FY 2008– mainly nine operations32 - were thus pursued, including one APL and 
eight investment or TA projects (see Annex 1 of CASCR full report).   

12. 
Using a selected mix of financing instruments and a targeted program of Analytical and 
Advisory Activities (AAA), the CAS seek continuity with the ongoing reform programs, 
including by using a programmatic approach around three DPOs.  It also promoted selectivity by 
focusing interventions on selected PRSP themes (where the Bank has the greatest comparative 
advantage, and where the Bank can complement or leverage efforts by donors) and left other 
aspects of the PRSP agenda aside33. Sector interventions were expected to decrease in terms of 
number of new operations proposed and areas of Bank presence.  The Bank was also to continue 
promote donors harmonization in the spirit of the 2005 Paris declaration on Aid Effectiveness, of 
which Niger is a signatory. Active partnerships with other donors were to be pursued, particularly 
in Public Finance Management (PFM) reform/governance, agriculture and irrigation, transport, 

31 Respectively through (i) Pillar 1: Improvements in public financial and fiduciary management and fiduciary controls; supporting 
privatization of state-owned enterprises and improving the environment for private sector investment; reforming and developing the 
financial sector including restructuring of state-owned banks, and strengthening financial institutions to expand SME financing; (ii) 
Pillar 2: Improvements in rural production and income-generating activity and addressing environmental degradation by, among other 
things expanding irrigated agriculture; and (iii)  Pillar 3: Making primary education accessible to all; making health care accessible to 
the poor; addressing population issues; and intensifying the fight against HIV/AIDS. 
32 Two other operations were about to close. In addition there were three regional projects: the Africa Emergency Locust Project; 
Reversing Land and Water Degradation Trends in the Niger River Basin Project; and the Niger Basin Water Resources Development 
and Sustainable Ecosystems Management Program 
33 This included stand-alone operations in the social sectors and in mining and energy. Budget support and a proposed Sources of 
Growth operation were expected to cover, inter alia, mining and energy investments and/or reforms. 

52 

 
 
 
 
 
                                                 
education and health (co-financing of multi-year investment programs), and water.  The CAS also 
stressed support to regional integration. The CAS report thus highlighted the regional synergies 
expected within each of the 15 areas of intervention/outcomes.  

13. 
The IDA 15 allocation processing was not yet completed by the time the CAS was 
prepared and the CAS was presented with an indicative annual IDA envelope of US$90 million 
equivalent. Overall with IDA 14 and 15, the CAS proposed a program financed by a total 
envelope of IDA resources of US$380 million over four years.  The new IDA assistance was 
expected to be slightly stronger in the first pillar, with a share of 49 percent of total financing 
versus 38 percent for the second pillar, with the cross-cutting themes receiving about 13 percent 
of the Bank’s assistance.  By FY09 budget support was expected represent close to 40 percent of 
the Bank annual support to Niger with the start of a new DPO series - with one multi-sectoral 
operation per year.  At the same time, the Bank intended to still rely on CDD-type operations, 
with the aim to increase empowerment of local communities and final beneficiaries, and 
strengthen the decentralization process.  It was also planned to mobilize funding for ESW through 
Trust Funds (TF) and collaborative efforts with other donors. For example the Public Expenditure 
Management and Financial Accountability Review (PEMFAR) II was to be carried out with the 
other partners involved in PFM reform.  

14. 
The CAS was based on rounds of extensive consultations held primarily by the Niger 
Country office with key constituencies and opinion-makers in Niger including governments, 
parliamentarians, the media, youth, and academics, the private sector, CSOs and other community 
groups in the capital Niamey as well as in four other regions.  These consultations followed and 
build on the client survey of June 2007 involving approximately 600 stakeholders.   

15. While the CAS objective was to contribute to Niger’s higher order goals outlined in 
PRSP-II,  the Bank’s performance was not expected to be measured according to high order 
indicators (such as GDP growth or reduction in poverty levels).  Performance was to be measured 
through 37 indicators (of which some were specifically related to MDGs) and milestones for the 
15 outcomes.  The results obtainable during the CAS period were expected to be mostly 
influenced by operations already on-going in 2007-2008 and to a limited extent by new 
operations started over the first two years of the CAS period.  No dedicated CAS indicator 
measurement system was foreseen for the regional operations. Specific data and feedback was to 
be provided mainly by the PRSP M&E capacity of the Government (essentially the Statistical 
Institute which benefitted from IDA and other donors’ support), ISRs/M&E of the different Bank 
operations and PERs using Public Expenditure Tracking Surveys (PETS) in key PRSP sectors.    

16. 
The CAS report pointed at a high number of risks: security risks, internal political risks, 
climate risks and vulnerability to other exogenous shocks (locust invasion, avian flu) with strong 
negative effects in agriculture, commodity price risks, a possible Dutch Disease fueled by high 
uranium prices, and particularly food insecurity.  All in all, with such a high number of risks and 
its current poverty levels and low Human Development Index, and neighboring countries having 
just experienced conflicts, Niger had many features of a fragile state although it was and is still 
not formally designated as such by the donors.  

Developments and Adjustments during CAS Implementation   

17. 
Implementation of the CAS had barely started that Niger was hit by a succession of 
shocks which deeply affected its political environment and weighted heavily on its economic 

53 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
performance. Its internal political situation had been relatively stable since 2000.  However in 
2009 efforts by then President Tandja to circumvent a two-term limit resulted in a severe political 
crisis that led to a coup d’état by a military junta in February 2010.  The junta committed to a 
one-year transition period that was to lead to the reinstatement of democratically governing 
institutions in early 2011. From February 2010 to April 2011 Niger was thus governed by the 
Supreme Council for the Restoration of Democracy under the presidency of a general. Seasoned 
technocrats, several of them Nigeriens working previously for international organizations, were 
appointed to key ministerial positions. Following a referendum and the adoption of a new 
constitution in November 2010 and a series of local, legislative, and presidential elections in early 
2011, the new President took office in April.  The February 2010 military coup d’état however 
triggered OP/BP 7.30 (Dealing with de facto government) affecting for a certain time the Bank’s 
operations in Niger. 

18. 
During this difficult political period starting when OP 7.30 was triggered, the Bank has 
reacted swiftly to the succession of shocks that Niger faced and responded with commendable 
flexibility to the country’s needs.  Following the start of the political crisis in mid-2009, IDA 
largely refrained from presenting new projects to the Board and delayed the effectiveness of some 
newly approved operations, although implementation of previously approved projects continued. 
Following the coup, an assessment under OP 7.30 carried out in April 2010 provided the basis for 
continued disbursements of the existing portfolio (such as the first DPO of the CAS period). The 
Bank maintained close dialogue with the interim authorities and development partners to 
encourage continued progress towards constitutional normalcy given the importance of stability 
to development and poverty reduction.  Also a limited number of financing activities were 
approved on a case by case basis, especially to support the government’s response to a new food 
crisis - through trust funding.  A second assessment under OP 7.30 resulted in the Bank’s decision 
in March 2011 to resume new lending to Niger.  The Bank also reacted to the changed country 
situation by agreeing with the authorities on a reprioritized reform program resulting in some 
adjustments to the original triggers for the second DPO.  

19. 
In addition in 2010, with the repetition of the 2008 drought, Niger had to deal with a 
severe food crisis which left 48 percent of the population food insecure. Finally, the crisis in Cote 
d’Ivoire and the events in neighboring Libya, where many Nigerians worked, added also to 
external pressures.  Although most institutions are relatively weak in Niger, some institutions 
showed remarkable willingness and capacity to deal with the stress during these years. The 
preparation of a new constitution laid the foundation for a smooth return to a democratically 
elected regime.  Domestic institutions created to deal with food crises and strengthened after the 
2005 famine, worked very well in 2010 – with the military government’s quick recognition of the 
problem and call for external assistance. 

20. 
The 2008-2011 CAS period comprised four different phases, with a different political 
environment and/or government: (i) pre-2009 political events phase, broadly a continuation of the 
previous CAS period; (ii) a period of severe political crisis from mid-2009 until the February 
2010 coup; (iii) a transition period with interim de facto government until the early 2011 
democratic elections; and (iv) since 2011, renewed stability under the newly elected President and 
new government resulting from the April 2011 parliamentary election.   For more than one year 
during the 2nd and 3rd phases missions could not be carried out as planned.  Also, the Bank’s 
Niger team was during 15 months without a Country Manager in the Niamey office.  Still, the 
Bank demonstrated a high degree of responsiveness and flexibility during the last three phases 
that made a significant difference for the country and the CAS program.  During this critical time, 

54 

 
 
 
 
as the IMF program had been interrupted, the Bank program, particularly the DPOs, was the key 
instrument used to ensure that the macro situation stayed on track.   

21. 
The CAS remained relevant in the context of economic and political turbulence.  The 
2010-2011 transition authorities remained committed to the strategic orientation of PRSP-II and 
the CAS, and advanced most of the reform agenda of the PRSP/CAS34.  The new Government 
democratically-elected in 2011 has likewise supported the trust of the CAS.  No major 
reorientation of the CAS was thus deemed necessary in the later part of the CAS period.   

22. 
A CAS Progress Report was prepared neither in 2010 as originally planned - given the 
circumstances - nor later as the time of preparation of the next CAS and the PRSP II (2012) was 
coming close.  But this did not prevent the Bank to adjust adequately the strategy - primarily to 
respond effectively to the crisis resulting from the successive shocks and particularly meet the 
country’s urgent financing needs.   The two emergency food projects, not planned in the CAS 
were delivered respectively in 2008 and 2010.  With the two DPOs - GPRC-1 which was declared 
effective as soon as the basic constraints under OP 7.30 were lifted and GPRG-2 approved soon 
after the newly elected Government was in place – the Bank provided budget support at a critical 
time.  The innovative safety net project – not planned in the CAS – was also nevertheless 
delivered as soon as possible, and should contribute alleviating the effects in 2011-2012 of the 
Libyan crisis causing inter alia the return of large numbers of migrant Nigerian workers.  Still, in 
these years when a difficult environment called for quick responses, the Bank at the same time 
contributed significantly in having the Government keep the focus on longer term issues and on 
areas of long-term growth potential. 
23. 
Despite the 2009-2011 political turmoil, the Bank delivered more IDA resources over the 
CAS period (US$403.5 million excluding TFs) than originally programmed (US$365 million) 
plus US$45 million of Niger’s share in two new regional projects.  Thirteen new IDA operations 
were approved until June 30, 2011, in addition to the two regional projects plus three Trust Fund 
financed operations (see Table 2 and Annex 2).  Instead of three PRSCs/DPOs (for a planned 
total of US$120 million), two DPOs were approved for a total amount of US$92 million.  The 
two new investments operations (PRODEX and CAP2) plus the two Food Security Operations 
and new regional agriculture operation, beefed up significantly the share of Rural Development 
and Agriculture (RDA) in the portfolio. The weight of RDA became the most important - with 
39% in terms of $ amount – of the portfolio by July 1, 2011 – followed by urban and water with 
29%35.  A significant use of TF resources was made during the CAS period, with total new 
approvals for 2009-2010 of US 35.2 million, of which US$30.5 million from the Global Food 
Price Crisis Response from and the Education for All - Fast Track Initiative Catalytic Fund (EFA-
FTI).   
24. 
A substantial program of analytical work has been undertaken. It not only broadly 
fulfilled the scope of what was planned under the CAS (although with some slippage between 
years) but included also a number of additional tasks (see Table 3).  Significant non-lending work 
included the PEMFAR 2, a comprehensive set of policy notes (covering 14 sectors) for the new 
Government in 2011, and a batch of in depth analysis leading eventually to the innovative Safety 
Net Project.      

34 The transition government for example also requested Bank assistance in carrying out a governance assessment and 
the preparation of a governance reform program, efforts which are being continued by the new government. 

35 Followed by Public Sector (19%), Education & health (9%) and Transport (7%).  

55 

 
 
 
 
                                                 
 
25. 
The succession of shocks did impact GDP growth.  After a lack-luster 2007 year with a 
GDP growth of 3.4 percent, growth jumped to 9.6 percent with a bumper crop harvest in 2008. 
But after the failure of the 2009 harvest, GDP decreased by 0.9 percent.  It partly recovered in 
2010 to increase by 8 percent – again on account of a good harvest.  With another poor harvest in 
2011 (leading to a severe food shortage in 2012), the growth rate is estimated at about 2.3% that 
year.  The average growth rate for 2008-2011 would thus not exceed 4.7 percent, lower than the 
PRSP target of 7 percent but still slightly better than the 4.4 percent average achieved between 
2001 and 2007 and better than the 4.2 percent of the base-case scenario of the Bank/IMF 
estimates in 2008. It is not clear to what extent the slight improvement is due to the investment 
boom and/or better price in extractive industries (2009-2011), structural reforms implemented 
since 2000, and improvement in the agriculture sector36.  On the negative side however, the large 
yearly variations in GDP changes underscores the continuing extreme volatility and vulnerability 
of Niger’s economy to climatic factors and other chocks.  On the bright side, despite the 2009-
2010 economic turbulences, Niger was able to maintain a sound fiscal policy, with a fiscal 
balance remaining essentially under control: 1.5% in 2008, -5.5% in 2009, -2.5% in 2010, -3.6% 
in 2011 (projected).  Poverty remains deeply entrenched37 and most MDGs are still out of reach. 
Analysis undertaken on the preliminary results of a recent Poverty Assessment in Niger indicates 
that poverty has declined from 59 percent in 2008 to 56 percent in 2011 and the poor have 
benefitted more from growth than the non-poor.  Also the growth in GDP per capita – (probably 
around 1.4 percent/year on average) over 2008-2011 suggests some improvement in poverty 
incidence over the last four years. 

Program Performance Evaluation  

26. 
An evaluation of program performance is provided in Table 1, essentially around the 
outcomes and indicators38 and based on specific detailed subprogram reviews and evaluations for 
each of the sectors or main areas of engagement provided in Annex 2.  This evaluation is 
summarized below for each of two pillars and the two cross-cutting themes.  It concludes that 
performance assessed up to December 2011 has been moderately satisfactory.  Partial progress 
was achieved towards most outcomes.  The outcomes are mixed with respect to the financial 
sector which remains shallow and expensive.  While results are so far still short of expectations in 
that specific sector, overall there are no significant shortcomings in the performance of the 
program. The performance is fairly good given Niger’s absorptive capacity constraints – resulting 
primarily from shortcomings in an administration that needs to be urgently modernized.   

27. 
For many outcomes the progress shown by the indicators is to a significant extent the 
result of operations initiated during previous CAS.  Most new operations approved during the 
new CAS became effective or were approved only during last one and half year of the CAS.  
Most of their effects will not been seen soon except for a few effects of triggers and prior actions 
of the two DPOs.   Most results of many operations started and implemented during the CAS will 
only accrue during the next CAS.  The success of these operations will be primarily seen over the 
medium term in the context of the policy changes and strategies they introduced.  

Pillar 1 – Accelerating Sustainable Growth that is equitably shared 

36 An in-depth analysis of the growth of agriculture production and agriculture GDP growth over 2008-2011 is needed.  
The PICAG data suggest an average growth of agriculture and élevage of 3.6%, barely above population growth.   
37 Head count poverty is estimated to have declined by three percentage points from 64.4 percent in 2005 to 60.8 
percent in 2007/08. 
38 The Government’s PRSP evaluation report is not yet completed and no users’ survey is being carried out. 

56 

 
 
 
   
 
                                                 
28. 
Progress has been moderate under this pillar, with most expected outcomes partially 
achieved.   Outcome 1, Maintain macroeconomic stability, was partially achieved – with a 
significant contribution of GPRG-1 and GRPC-239.  The progress also was significant in clearing 
Government arrears to the private sector and introducing electronic processing of payable needed 
for paying Government bills in a faster and transparent way to the suppliers but keeping the 
inflation rate under 3 percent was uneven.  Outcome 2, strengthen competitiveness of supply 
chains, is already partly achieved and well on its way to be fully achieved. The Private Irrigation 
Project (PIP) and Agro-Pastoral Export and Market Development Project (PRODEX) have 
significantly increased the agriculture areas under irrigation. PRODEX is contributing in a major 
way in developing a participatory supply chain approach for priority export agriculture 
commodities and livestock products and paving the ways for PPPs in the agriculture sector.   

29. 
Outcome 3, Strengthen sustainable management of natural resources to reduce 
vulnerability to desertification - is well on its way to be achieved.  The Community Action 
Program (CAP) 1 and 2 APL projects have addressed this issue through a comprehensive CDD 
approach. They substantially improved local governance as well as land and natural resource and 
ecosystem management, raised levels of health, education and food security, and reclaimed and 
protected large areas of land.  The Local Investment Fund successfully stimulated local 
development and empowered communes and communities to provide a response to their priority 
needs.  A supplementary grant equivalent to US$4.5 million added in 2008 to CAP 1 to finance a 
new Avian Influenza prevention and control component was swiftly prepared as an emergency 
project and successfully implemented. The networks built up by the project can be used against 
other epidemic diseases.  An innovative PHRD grant to promote carbon sequestration by acacia 
Senegal trees planting was also added to the CAP 1 and this initiative is being pursued under the 
CAP2 with both IDA and GEF financings. 

30.  
Outcome 4 Strengthen the investment climate and support entrepreneurship - was fully 
achieved regarding investment climate, but financial sector reform and development objectives 
were only partially achieved, albeit with reasonable prospects for tangible improvements over the 
next two years.  GPRG-1 supported the Government's efforts in promoting private sector-led 
growth and entry in the formal sector by reducing the corporate tax as a first step towards 
comprehensive tax reforms, broadening of the tax base, and overhaul of incentives to ensure a 
level playing field for private firms.  Doing Business 2012 indicates Niger “distance to frontier” 
has been reduced and in terms of cumulative change over 5 last years, Niger ranks 53rd among 
173 countries (with inter alia the reduction in cost and time for establishing a business, progress 
in dealing with construction permits and resolving insolvency, etc..).  With the Financial Sector 
TA Project the new Microfinance Regulatory and Supervisory Agency was created and is 
operational. Substantial progress was made in building capacity within the ministries, and 
financial sector institutions and participants especially in microfinance institutions40, insurance 
companies, and banks.  But the cost of financial intermediation was not reduced and because of 
the delays in setting-up a new the postal bank system, that project did not contribute to private 
sector development as expected by expanding access to financial services in financially 
underserved areas. 

39 As stressed in paragraph 20, during the critical 2010-2011 period as the IMF program had been interrupted, the Bank 
program mainly through these DPOs was the key instrument used to ensure that the macro situation stayed on track.   

40 The audits of the main MFIs suggested some improvement in the capacity of the sector. The total number of MFI 
members and clients, and the value of deposit accounts in MFIs both increased threefold 

57 

 
 
 
 
                                                 
 
31. 
 Outcome 5, strengthen economic infrastructure to promote growth, access to services 
and regional synergies - is basically achieved for transport and on its way to be fully achieved for 
electric power.  The targets of the Transport Sector Program Project for rural access and reduction 
of transport time were reached.  Road rehabilitation targets are now only partly met41.  But with 
this project and the two GPRGs, road maintenance funding for CAFER has at last reached the 
target levels in 2011, although these are still not sufficient in relation to Niger’s relatively wide 
and dense road network.  Yet increased spending on road maintenance has resulted in some 
increase in the share of the road network in good condition42.  Regarding electrical energy supply, 
rehabilitation of the hydropower units of the Kainji dam in Nigeria is not far advanced but is 
expected to be achieved with the completion of the regional Niger Basin Water Resources 
Development Project.  

Pillar II. -  Developing Human Capital through Equal Access to Quality Social Services.  

Under pillar 2, five out of eight expected outcomes have been partially achieved.  

32. 
Outcome 6, increased access to basic education and improved quality – is partially achieved.   
The Basic Education Project and the FTI-Basic Education Support Project contributed 
successfully in raising overall gross primary enrolment (GER) above 2011 targets, but increased 
only slightly girls’ GER. The GER in rural areas, the primary completion rate and pass rate 
reached also project targets, albeit those were more conservative than CAS targets and MDGs. 

33. 
Outcome 7, improved access of the rural population to basic health and nutrition services 
is also fully achieved.  The Institutional Strengthening & Health Sector Program provided a 
minimum package of essential health services targeted at the poor, women and children, and 
made a significant contribution in the strengthening of the health sector.  It achieved its specific 
objectives and the principal objectives of reducing maternal and child mortality. It contributed to 
set up a Sector Wide Approach (SWAp), established the conditions for a smooth transition from 
project to program implementation, motivating donors to support the National Health 
Development plan through a pooled account, a first in Niger.  Outcome 8 - improved coverage 
and use of HIV/AIDS prevention services and treatment is also fully achieved.  The Multi-Sector 
HIV/AIDS program project succeeded in establishing a permanent institutional framework and in 
putting in place policies and programs that continue to guide the fight against HIV/AIDS.  It 
vastly improved the Ministry of Health’s capacity to deliver prevention, treatment, and mitigation 
services and achieved significant institutional development at the central and regional levels of 
both the public and NGO sectors.  The recently approved HIV/AIDS Support 2 project will assist 
the Government in aligning better its response strategy with the modes of transmission of the 
epidemic to target high-risk groups. 

34.  
Outcome 9 - Increased access to safe drinking water and sanitation is partially achieved 
with further progress under way. The Water Sector Project achieved or exceeded all its objectives 
of substantially increasing access to potable water in urban and rural areas as well as sanitation 
services in some peri-urban areas. Improving performance and implementation of socially-
acceptable tariffs allowed the urban water subsector to reach and maintain for some time its 
financial equilibrium under a successful PPP.  The new recent Urban and Water Sanitation 
project will expand the achievements of the first project, with an emphasis on sanitation and 
schools and capacity building. Outcome 10 - Increased access of urban residents to basic 
infrastructure services particularly in disadvantaged areas, is partially achieved with further 
progress under way. The Local Urban Infrastructure Development Project has made reasonable 

41 Rehabilitation costs had been underestimated. 
42 51 % of bituminous roads and 27.5 % of non-bituminous roads in good condition in 2009, compared to 41% and 16 
% respectively in 2001. 

58 

 
 
 
 
                                                 
progress in building local management capacities for programming, implementing and managing 
urban infrastructure and basic services. It is financing municipal investments in infrastructure for 
basic services (build partly through labor-intensive techniques) in three cities, as well as 
infrastructure boosting local economic development. A national framework for public 
intervention in the urban sector has been proposed and a law drafted on public project delegation 
and management.  

35.  
Outcome 11 - Gender inequity reduced, as evidenced by improved girls’ access to 
education and health service - has so far been partially achieved.  The Basic Education Project 
and the EFA-FTI FTI-Basic Education Support Project contributed in rising only slightly                          
girls’ Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) in primary education. The Institutional Strengthening & 
Health Sector Program on the other hand significantly improved women’s access to health 
services – essentially in terms of births attended by skilled medical personnel and ante-natal 
coverage.  Outcome 12 - An effective food security and social protection strategy in place - was 
achieved regarding Food Security but there has been only limited progress on Social Security.  
The first Emergency Food Security Project successfully helped mitigate the impact of the 2008 
food crisis.  The second Emergency Food Security Project has made great strides in reducing 
Niger’s vulnerability to shocks and increasing income of the poor. Monitoring of food price and 
national food security stock is effective and the capacity for preparation and implementation of 
the institutions in the Food Crisis Prevention and Management Framework has been reinforced. 
Targeted programs for cash transfer and cash for work have been launched and a comprehensive 
safety net system is being established with the Safety Net Project. But implementation of policy 
reforms for the pension system has barely begun under the GPRC2 and Financial Sector TA 
project.  

36. 
Outcome 13. Government and farmers are better prepared to deal with natural disasters 
by mitigating risks - achieved. The Avian Flu Prevention Component of the CAP1 established a 
network that can be used against various epidemic diseases. The Africa Emergency Locust 
Project established an Early Warning and Response system and a National Unit for Locust 
Control. A National Contingency Plan is operational and adequate for response to draught/food 
emergencies. The CAP1/2 introduced improved Sustainable Land Management (SLM) practices. 
The West Africa Agriculture Productivity project will support adoption of improved technologies. 

Cross Cutting Issue 1: Reducing the Rate of Population Growth 

37. 
Outcome 14:  increased awareness of family planning. Partially achieved and further 
progress expected.  PRODEM has strengthened Niger's capacity to address the demographic 
challenge by building the government capacity in designing and implementing a nationwide 
multi-sector population program, increasing general awareness on population and reproductive 
health issues.  It has helped strengthen substantially the supply of, and demand for, family 
planning and reproductive health services and contributed increasing demand for planning 
services and the modern contraceptives prevalence. 

Cross Cutting Issue 2: Promoting Good Governance.   

38.  
Outcome 15. Strengthen economic governance and capacity to implement and monitor 
reforms. Partially achieved and further PFM progress under way. GPRG1 and GPRC2 and the 
Reform Management & TA project have led to steady progress on the front of PEMFAR reforms, 
including fiscal resource mobilization, enhanced budget preparation, execution and control using 
PEFA methodology to evaluate progress and performance, and preparation of MTEFs. The public 
procurement system has also notably improved with a more transparent and effective control of 
contract awards. The Bank’s efforts in supporting Niger's adhesion to the EITI to promote good 

59 

 
 
 
 
 
governance in the extractive industries have borne fruit.  Niger’s compliance with EITI standards 
and principles was assessed as highly satisfactory allowing Niger to completed EITI validation in 
2011. 

39. 
The CAS results matrix did not set forth specific outcomes for the regional operations in 
Niger, three operations concentrated essentially under the Pillar 143.  These are programs that 
clearly contribute significantly to Niger’s growth.  The specific development objectives of these 
operations have or are in the process of being met as detailed in Annex 2.  

Bank Performance  

40. 
The performance of the Bank is assessed as moderately satisfactory as a combination of 
satisfactory for the design of the CAS and moderately satisfactory for the implementation of the 
program. The design of the CAS program was well aligned with Niger’s development priorities 
and the Government’s strategy laid out in PRSP-II.  It was well clustered around two pillars and 
two cross-cutting themes, with a clear objective to maximize impact and enhance synergy, and 
while at the same time coping with the Bank’s overarching concern – possibly excessive in the 
specific case of Niger - to reduce fragmentation.  Starting with the guiding principle that it was 
essential for Niger to break with its history of slow economic growth that was not keeping up 
with a fast population increase, the program rightly stressed first the need for: (i) accelerated and 
sustained growth that is equally shared; and (ii) developing human capital through equal access to 
quality social services. With its two cross-cutting filters the program adequately stressed the 
essential importance of addressing demographic issues and emphasized the fourth PRSP pillar 
devoted to governance.  Finally, the CAS rightly focused on food security, reducing vulnerability, 
and rural development, given the severe food crises that critically affect Niger on recurrent basis. 
Yet the selection of indicators proved difficult to measure the achievements of the program in an 
unstable country context. The political instability from 2009 to 2011 and subsequent OP.7.30 
were missed opportunity to complete a CAS Progress Report where the whole Program could 
have been adjusted.    

41. 
The planned CAS assistance was selective and focused on actions where the Bank has a 
comparative advantage, taking into account other donor programs. The CAS kept a significant 
continuity with the ongoing reform programs.  It refrained from evolving into a much stronger 
budget support approach that would probably have been more risky with little additional benefits.  
The areas of engagement were all highly relevant.  It is likely that a broad Civil Service reform 
program could have been premature and would most probably not have worked in the context 
prevailing in 2008-2010. The Bank instead undertook to proceed with a more conservative 
approach focused on PFM and capacity building in many sectors.  A more ambitious and broad 
approach on that front will nevertheless be crucial in the next CAS.  The only apparent 
shortcoming in the program was the decision44 to not to support the energy sector, except for very 
limited AAA activities (which eventually were not even carried out during the CAS).  The 
unfortunate absence of the Bank from this sector - not covered by EITI - was not compensated by 

43 The West Africa Productivity Program, the Emergency Locust project and the Niger River Basin Multi-Purpose 
Water Resources Development project. 
44 The country team’s original plans for staying engaged in energy were dropped following a lukewarm reaction by the 
Government then in place and Bank management’s strong recommendation to make the CAS program more selective. 
The negative experience with the failed attempts in 2004-2006 to privatize the power utility and petroleum products 
distribution company under the unsuccessful Privatization and Regulatory TA project had also some influence on this 
decision.  

60 

 
 
 
 
 
                                                 
adequate comprehensive support by other donors.  A swift and major re-engagement of the Bank 
in the next CAS directly in this crucial sector is warranted, given Niger’s extreme dependence on 
electrical power imports on one hand and its major hydropower development potential on the 
other, the increasingly poor performance and difficult financial situation of the state-owned 
utility, the fast recent development of its oil production and refining industry coupled with the 
related probable surge of Government revenues, the major needs of the country in terms of rural 
electrification,  renewable energy at large and other environment friendly domestic fuel source.  
The program was also weak on the ICT front. 

42. 
The mix of instruments was well balanced between SILs, SWAps and DPOs, plus two 
emergencies operations. The two multi-sectoral DPOs had an important impact through strong 
synergies with specific parallel sector operations and solid analytical underpinning from sector 
operations and self-standing AAA.  The choice of outcome indicators for the results matrix was 
generally adequate: almost all could be measured properly.  The targets were generally realistic 
and were aligned on the specific targets of the operations except in a few instances.  The CAS 
report was correct in identifying risks – particularly political conflict, exogenous shocks and 
related food security risks.  The approaches to help mitigate the last two types of risks have been 
chosen correctly: supporting diversification of Niger’s economy with various programs to reduce 
vulnerability to such risks, and using flexibility in RDA projects and budget support operations to 
help respond swiftly to the shock-induced crises.  

43. 
The CAS program was more realistic than the Government PRSP-II in terms of GDP 
growth.  The fact that the high order PRSP growth targets and poverty reduction objectives were 
not achieved during the CAS is not a negative indicator of the quality of the CAS program and of 
the Bank’s performance. It reflects more the magnitude of the shocks Niger had to face and over 
optimism in setting the PRSP targets, and the low volume of donors’ financial support. That 
support has been insufficient during the last 10 years when compared to major funding needs of 
Niger, which is listed in recent studies as one of the countries identified as “aid orphans”45.  

44. 
During this CAS the Bank was particularly responsive: first by having a pro-active and 
balanced stance after the political events trigger the application of OP 7.30 and it became 
essential to rapidly reengage the new authorities; and second immediately thereafter by being 
flexible in adjusting the program to changing country circumstances and priorities, and by 
responding swiftly to its needs.  As shown by the DPOs and the other operations prepared and 
approved during 2010-2011, the Bank was swift in reengaging and efficient in helping Niger deal 
with very challenging circumstances and mitigates the effects of the successive shocks.  Bank 
regional management as well as the country team devoted considerable efforts and demonstrated 
a high degree of flexibility in this crucial reengagement.  The Bank’s reengagement had also 
significant impact by leveraging reengagement of many of Niger’s other partners. The highly 
satisfactory stance of the Bank during the 2009-2011 can be considered as best practice. Overall 
also during the whole CAS period the Bank has acted in balanced manner in addressing the acute 
short-term crisis concerns while maintaining a focus on long-term accelerated and shared growth 
and the necessary reforms it entails. Yet the Bank failed to conduct a CAS Progress Report as 
initially envisaged to adjust the CAS to new country context.  

45. 
The Bank’s teams and management paid strong attention to the implementation of the 
operations46 as shown by the quality of portfolio: only one project47 was rated MU for DPO or IP 

45 OECD-DAC: AID ORPHANS: October 2011; and CFP Working Paper Series No. 7 Robert Utz September, 2010. 
46 Albeit some ISRs focusing exceedingly on implementation issues did not pay sufficient attention to development 
outcomes and monitoring of indicators. Sector managers’ attention was in some cases not well focused on DPOs. 

61 

 
 
 
 
 
                                                 
by August 31, 2011.  Disappointing outcomes in the financial sector reflect more the flaws in 
overall project design 
than persistently 
insufficient attention during 
implementation.  
Disbursements understandably fell in 2009 and picked-up fast thereafter48.  By August 31, 2011 
the outstanding portfolio amounted to US$411 million with a cumulated disbursement ratio of 
18%.  Overall supervision of execution of the program was reinforced through increased 
decentralization of implementation to the Niamey office (particularly during the 2009-2010 
periods).  Concern for effectiveness and focus on development outcomes was generally adequate 
and well documented in the detailed Annex 2 on operations.  Seven out of the 17 non DPL 
operations under implementation during the CAS period were restructured, of which three during 
the CAS period itself.  M&E was still weak in some operations and special efforts were 
undertaken to correct those in most operations in the course of their implementation.  The need to 
do better on M&E was again stressed with the 2011 CPPR (given the 2009-2010 events, there 
was no other CPPR since the 2008 one).  Some of the Bank teams failed to follow on CAS 
outcome indicators not directly derived from their operations. No special CAS implementation 
plan was designed for specific follow up of the CAS results framework by the country team. 

46. 
The impact of most knowledge based AAA activities on the dialogue with the authorities 
was generally significant and followed rapidly in the development of the portfolio of operations. 
The country team reengaged proactively with the authorities after 2009, and particularly with the 
new elected Government, to support them in the design and implementation of their new program 
and provide necessary facts and policy analysis with the April 2011 sector policy notes on 14 
sectors.  It is too early to assess the full impact of those notes. The Bank together with other 
donors devoted continuous efforts to advancing the PFM agenda.  

47. 
As shown by the co-financing or parallel financing mobilized for about one third of the 
new CAS operations, the Bank has been successful in leveraging assistance from other donors.  
Efforts were particularly dedicated to increase donor coordination in budget support and PFM, 
health, water, transport and education sectors.  The opinion of the majority of the Nigerien 
counterparts and of the donors - based on recent interviews - is that the Bank generally met 
expectations in terms of responsiveness, efficacy in almost all areas of intervention, coordination 
with other donors and  leadership in key areas.  

Key lessons learned and suggestions for the new CAS 

48. 
First the strongest impact is achieved when multi-sectoral DPOs are delivered in parallel 
with sectoral operations, creating substantial synergies.  And particularly so in areas where 
reforms are difficult and need sustained commitment and actions from the Government.  An 
optimum strategic approach to help achieve CAS (and more broadly PRSP) objectives rely in a 
mutually reinforcing combination of investment and development policy support and AAA.  A 
balanced mix of DPOs, investment and TA operations, and AAA, carefully tailored to the 
country’s needs and particularly capacity is essential.

than in countries with a higher revenue base and less external stress. A programmatic DPO 
approach plays an important role in keeping the reform agenda on track and mobilizing the 
Government on cross-cutting issues in an environment of frequent external shocks and instability.   

50. 
Third, the strong impact of a long-term Bank involvement in specific areas has been 
confirmed once more. Long term involvement in one area – spanning two to three CAS periods - 
and substantial partner support by Bank, reinforces Government commitment and incentives for 
changes. It is key to have deep and long lasting development (especially transformational) impact 
(for example water, PFM, RDA).  This argues in favor of the Bank pursuing its engagement in a 
number of areas where much remains to be done and re-engaging in sectors it left “too soon”.  
Even more so as the Bank is often perceived as an “honest broker”, many donors are more willing 
to engage in a sector when the Bank is involved: this also increase leverage for change.   

51. 
Fourth, supporting a country that is highly vulnerable and prone to frequent shocks 
requires a balanced approach, addressing swiftly the critical short-term crisis concerns while 
maintaining a long-term focus on reforms necessary for reducing vulnerability and accelerating 
growth. 

52. 
Fifth, addressing effectively gender and demographic issues is a challenging undertaking. 
It requires a multi-sectoral and sustained approach over a long time horizon and underpinned by 
sharp social-cultural-economic analysis and action. This undertaking should be forcefully 
pursued.  A lot remains to be done in Niger – taking into account cultural legacy and sensitivities.   

53. 
An approach which gives an overarching importance to selectivity may not be the most 
appropriate for Niger.  Considering Niger’s per-capita ODA receipts that are among the lowest 
(US$38) in the sub-region, its very low HDI and per capita income, its very high funding needs 
Niger clearly appears to be under-aided (a finding consistent with that of  recent studies on aid 
orphans). In addition, its high vulnerability to external shocks – commodity prices, climatic and 
political (including in the neighboring countries), Niger could also be qualified as a fragile state.  
Paradoxically other sub-Saharan countries have managed to attract more support from donors, 
including TA and thereby benefit also from more external technical expertise than Niger.  The 
Bank has unique role to play, not only in funding but also as a knowledge Bank and through is 
convening power.  This argues for a presence of the Bank in all sectors where key and difficult 
reforms are urgent and/or massive investments are needed.  The energy sector is a case in point.     

54. 
The last two CAS put the emphasis on addressing rural development, increasing the 
production and productivity in agriculture to bring the population out of the rural poverty trap.  
With several operations, the overall weight of RDA in the portfolio may appear too high, but the 
performance of the recent projects could indicate that the new approaches followed during the last 
ten years are a last yielding significant positive results49.   An ex-post evaluation of all major 
RDA projects in Niger over the last 15-20 years, with a correlative analysis with climatic 
changes, should be a very informative AAA.  It would help sharpen the focus of new RDA 
operations, inform the preparation of future climate mitigation actions, and indicate which new 
approaches should be mainstreamed in the next phases of Niger’s Rural Development Strategy.   

55. 
Based on current trends, Niger is unlikely to reach most of the MDGs except three – child 
mortality, HIV/AIDS and non-access to safe water.  Niger faces the insidious risk of a sluggish 
growth – where growth stalls at around the still high rate of population growth and poverty 
decreases only slowly. A higher and steady average growth rate of 5 percent and beyond will be 

49 Agriculture GDP appears to have grown by about 3.6%/annum between 2007 and 2011, despite the shocks.

necessary, coupled with a steady reduction of population growth.  A simultaneous challenge is 
that of employment creation – also as a means to avoid conflict and violence.  Reducing Niger’s 
vulnerability – in particular getting its rural population out of the “vulnerability to climate 
shocks” trap – is paramount. To address all those challenges, Niger should not just rely on 
windfall benefits from its growing extractive industries, but primarily scale-up the productivity in 
the agriculture sector and diversify its economy, in an environment conducive to private-sector 
led growth – as well formal private as informal private sector.  

56.  
Niger may now be at a turning point for significant changes – with significant 
opportunities and risks.  On the one hand, in addition to growing uranium exports, oil production 
and refining should generate additional revenues for the Government.  It is essential that the oil 
sector be subject to the same transparency50 as uranium mining and that PFM be further 
strengthened to translate increased government revenues into growth enhancing and poverty 
reducing programs. On the other hand, climate change is likely to further affect negatively 
Niger’s agriculture and non-mineral natural resources.     

57. 
The Bank is expected to help the Government articulate the new 2012-2015 PRSP on 
which the next CAS should be aligned.  For the next CAS program, the Bank engagement should 
be comprehensive with activities boosting sustained and inclusive economic growth and 
employment generation, reducing vulnerability to climate change and other external shocks and 
volatility of growth (i.e. diversification of the economy) and enhancing good governance.  A 
balanced approach, based on basically similar mix of DPOs and investments operation as in the 
2008-2011 CAS should be appropriate. The new P4R could be introduced a pilot in selected areas 
- possibly food security and related aspects of RDA.    

58. 
 Niger is likely to benefit from higher levels of external financing (IDA and other 
partners) as well as more revenues generated from its natural resources. Absorptive capacity 
constraints will be more significantly felt unless major efforts are urgently devoted all across the 
board to modernize the administration, starting with the human resources.  Short of a dedicated 
broad Civil Services Reform program/project all future Bank operations should include a strong 
component/approach to address the capacity problems in Niger’s administration.   

50 Including monitoring all revenues that should accrue to the State and the proper costing of refined fuel products; and 
ensuring the adoption of an adequate pricing policy of those products on the domestic market.

For a fragile country like Niger, 
with low income and domestic 
revenue, budget support plays an 
important role in supporting the 
functioning 
of 
government. 
Predictable and sustained budget 
support plays a bigger role in Niger 
than in countries with a higher

A programmatic DPO approach 
plays an important role in keeping 
the reform agenda on track, in an 
environment of frequent external 
shocks and instability.  In the 2009-
2011 context of political disruption 
and external shocks that claimed 
much of the attention of policy 
makers, the GPRCs were an 
important tool for sustaining the 
momentum of a number of 
structural reforms supported by 
these operations.  The financial 
support provided in 2010-2011

stayed on track.   

During the implementation of

underpinnings of the project 
provided little guidance on the way 
the envisioned institutional reforms 
should be crafted. In its financial 
services component (postal

for new CAS 

Preparation of a new investment 
code started in 2008.  However, its 
finalization and adoption of the 
new investment code has been 
delayed due to the political 
developments and as the authorities 
are waiting for the issuing of 
WAMEU directives on investment 
codes. The new code would be 
finalized & adopted in 2012 

Road maintenance is improving. 
But frequent road barriers, non 
competitive practices in trucking 
(particularly for access to sea 
transport), and overloading of 
trucks, are still challenges to be 
addressed.  Measures to reduce 
those practices need to be 
addressed at the sub-regional level 
through collaboration of the 
countries involved (with support of 
a regional DPO).

While primary education system is 
improving, Niger’s Technical and 
Vocational Training (TVET) 
suffers from a number of problems 
which are reflected in limited 
access and poor quality.  It has 
received little support from dnrs so 
far. The government is currently 
preparing a program to strengthen 
the link between the education 
system and needs of the company, 
that will need urgent and 
substantial support.    

The SWAp in the health sector, 
the first  genuine one in Niger, 
was successful  and provided 
the following lessons:  

1. SWAPs need to carefully 
balance expectations and

the

aligned with 
the modes of 
transmission of the epidemic to 
target high-risk groups, While in 
Niger the overall HIV prevalence is 
still low & stable the rates are 
worrisome 
among 
high-risk 
transmitters, and HIV/AIDS 
is 
concentrated in high-risk groups . 

1. Private sector participation is a 
feasible delivery option even in a 
poor country like; 2. Cost recovery 
can be achieved:  improving the 
efficiency of the water utility while 
matching investment programs to 
the real needs of the sector, has 
helped achieving cost recovery 
with tariff increases acceptable to 
the population; 3. Tackling water 
sector reform without the funding 
of major investments can be risky 
as the latter usually provide a 
counterbalance to the political cost

Lessons and Suggestions

GPRC 1 and 2 supported the 
initiation of reforms of agricultural 
institutions, increasing access and 
use of agricultural inputs and 
technology (transparency in the 
management of the Central 
Procurement Unit for Agricultural 
Inputs (CAIMA) increased.  The 
adoption of an integrated 
framework for agricultural 
extension services provides the 
basis for future reforms that will 
also be supported through the West 
African Agricultural Productivity 
project.

Consolidated responsibility for population issues, promotion of women, 
and the protection of children in a single ministry, to facilitate the effective 
implementation of the DGPP. Major capacity building done in Ministry of 
Population and Social Reform. M&E system in place and demographic 
data collected. Budget allocation for this ministry almost doubled from 
2010 to FCFA 5.8 billion in 2011. 

Nationwide and culturally sensitive national advocacy,  information, 
education and communication (IEC) and behavior change communication

PEMFAR reforms on fiscal resource mobilization (tax and 
customs), enhanced budget preparation, execution and control, 
using PEFA methodology to evaluate progress and performance 
well under way. 

The various performance measures of the budget cycle including 
preparation, reliability of revenues forecasts, implementation, 
monitoring and reporting, have experienced some progress against 
the 2009 baseline. The quality of macroeconomic projections and 
fiscal revenues has improved. The variance between actual and 
planned revenues for the Customs and Tax Authorities in 2010 
was smaller than a year earlier (15% versus 21% for Tax; and 1% 
versus 11% for Customs. 

Global MTEF is prepared, outlining sector budget allocations, 
consistent with PRSP.

PEMFAR II 

GAC review and action program 
proposal (2011)  

The lack of success of previous 
PFM reform programs in Niger 
highlighted the need to combine 
the design of a major policy and 
institutional reform program in 
PFM with implementation of a 
comprehensive capacity-building 
project supporting each main 
objective of the aspects of the 
program. Thus five-year Reform 
management and TA project 
supports an in-depth increase of 
Ministry of Finance (MEF)’s 
capacity.  

The approach for PFM in Niger is 
based on a long-term and systemic 
treatment of existing anomalies of 
the PFM system rather than a quick 
short-term technical fix and 
consists in a sequenced platform 
approach for building credible and 

80 

 
Lessons and Suggestions 
for new CAS 

reliable PFM systems.  It 
encompasses a sequence of 
activities which gives priority to 
the most pressing needs, taking 
into account the capacity and 
institutional realities. 

Civil service reform, a crucial 
driver of public sector management 
in Niger has not yet been 
addressed.  

Coordination and harmonization 
among many donors active in PFM 
has improved but more needs to be 
done – as for budget support, 
through common matrix.

- Public procurement system ensuring more transparent and 
effective control of contract awards during the opening and 
technical evaluation of bids, with the revision of the legal 
framework (unique committee responsible for bid opening and 
contract award established and composition of bid evaluation 
committees adjusted). Draft new procurement code has been

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION 

Niger 

Joint IMF/IDA Debt Sustainability Analysis Update 

Prepared by the Staffs of the International Monetary Fund and the 
International Development Association 

Approved by David Robinson and Peter Allum (IMF) and  
Marcelo Giugale and Sudarshan Gooptu (World Bank) 

March 14, 2013 

The previous Debt Sustainability Analysis was prepared in 2011. The medium-term 
economic framework underpinning the analysis has been revised to reflect new 
information on the financing of large oil and mining projects, including the contracting of 
a new concessional loan to refinance an oil refinery. While the various debt measures 
remain below the relevant thresholds for the baseline scenario, the present value (PV) of 
debt to GDP ratio breaches the threshold under the most extreme stress test. On the basis 
of this, Niger’s risk of debt distress should continue to be considered as moderate.

97 

 
	
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
I. BACKGROUND 

1. 
This debt sustainability analysis (DSA) was jointly prepared by the IMF and the 
World Bank and updates the 2011 DSA of the external and total public debt of Niger. It 
uses the standard debt dynamics template for low-income countries and is based on end-2011 
data. The debt data cover external and domestic debt of the central government, debt of public 
enterprises and parastatals, a state guarantee, and private external debt, derived from the 
projected debt flows linked to large oil and mining projects. Domestic debt includes arrears, 
debt to the central bank (BCEAO) for statutory advances and the SDR allocation, and 
government securities.  

2. 
Niger’s debt ratios have been significantly reduced by debt relief, as discussed in 
the previous DSA. The Enhanced HIPC Initiative, whose completion point was reached in 
2004, together with the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) assistance in 2006 from the 
African Development Fund, IDA, and the IMF, resulted in a significant decline in public 
nominal external debt, from more than 80 percent of GDP in 2002 to about 17 percent in 2010. 
In 2011, the government contracted a 650 million yuan loan for the financing of its share in the 
construction of the new Azelik uranium mine, and extended a guarantee of 40 percent of a 
US$880 million loan to the Soraz oil refinery. As a result, the stock of public external debt, 
including guarantees, moved to 22 percent of GDP at end-2011. Looking ahead, the authorities’ 
ambitious economic development program includes increased infrastructure spending in the 
next few years.

UNDERLYING DSA ASSUMPTIONS 

II. 
3. 
Medium-and long-term 
projections for Niger have been 
updated since the last DSA in the light 
of recent developments and discussions 
with the authorities (Text Table 1). The 
key differences from the previous 
analysis stem from the fact that a bad 
agricultural harvest in 2011, together with 
important start-up difficulties 
encountered in the new oil project and a 
significant shortfall in custom revenues in 
2012 led to downward revisions in GDP 
growth, fiscal revenue and exports for 
both 2011 and 2012. At the same time, the start of operations of the new Imouraren uranium 
mine, currently under development and expected to double current uranium production capacity, 
has been postponed by about two years, resulting in the expected impact of this new project

shifting from the medium to the longer term. Macroeconomic assumptions for the long-term in 
GDP growth, revenue, and exports, remain close to those made in the last DSA. 

4. 
Natural resources are expected to continue playing a key role in GDP growth in the 
longer term, together with a greater contribution from other sectors of the economy as the 
economy diversifies. Our assumption remains that higher revenue will be used for productive 
public investment, which, together with progress improving the business climate, will allow the 
economy to diversify. The inflation rate is projected to remain low and stable, averaging 
1.9 percent over the projection period.  

5. 
The exports-to-GDP ratio is projected to increase through 2028 as the economy 
diversifies and develops. A crude oil export project is currently under development, which 
might have an important impact on revenue and exports, but there is still too much uncertainty 
at this point in time to include it in the baseline framework.  

6. 
The current account deficit, excluding official transfers, is projected to improve, 
reflecting the coming on stream of petroleum. The current account deficit is financed by debt 
creating flows, foreign direct investment, and capital grants, which account for about 
17 percent of exports of goods and services on average over the projection period in Niger. 

7. 
The macroeconomic outlook continues to be subject to various risks. The country 
remains vulnerable to exogenous shocks, including climatic shocks that frequently result in 
food crises, commodity price fluctuations including through their impact on the return on 
public sector investment projects, and the security situation in the region, as demonstrated by 
the recent flooding and continued arrivals of migrants from neighboring countries. 

III. 
PUBLIC EXTERNAL DSA 
IV. Niger’s public debt exposure is expected to increase significantly due to the 
government’s involvement in natural resource projects. In particular, the authorities have 
reached understandings with EXIM Bank of China on the contracting of a concessional loan of 
US$880 million (CFAF 435 billion, or 12 percent of GDP). This loan will refinance the 
existing non-concessional financing of the new refinery, which was initially provided by the 
Chinese investment partner (CNPC), with 40 percent guaranteed by the state. While the non-
concessional 40 percent state guarantee will thus be terminated, causing a one-off spike in debt 
service ratios in 2013, the government is expected to assume liability for the total amount of the 
new loan, which will be on-lent to the refinery. As a result, the stock of public external debt is 
expected to reach about 33.5 percent of GDP in 2013, from 24 percent in 2012. As private 
external debt is expected to decrease by 60 percent in counterpart, as the previously contracted 
loan is terminated, the stock of total (public and private) external debt (in nominal terms) is not 
expected to be affected by this transaction. The rate of external public debt accumulation is 
subsequently expected to remain broadly stable over time (Figure 1a). While the grant element 

99 

 
	
 
 
 
 
of the new borrowing in the short term has improved compared to the previous DSA, because 
the new loan for the refinery is now concessional63, it is expected to gradually decline over 
time, as the country develops and thus will have less access to new borrowing on highly 
concessional terms. 

V. 
In the baseline scenario the external debt ratios remain below their 
policy-dependent thresholds throughout the projection period (2012-32), as in the previous 
DSA. The present value (PV) of debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to increase sharply from 2012 
to 2013 and will continue to move upward for the rest of the period. The PV of debt-to-export 
and debt-to-revenue ratios adopt similar trajectories, with a relatively more benign path for the 
PV of debt-to-export ratio thanks to the increasing projected exports over the projection 
period.64 Because of the assumed termination of the 40 percent state guarantee of the SORAZ 
loan in 2013, the present value of debt service to export and debt service to revenue ratios 
breach their thresholds in 2013.    

VI. As in the previous DSA, the historical scenario shows a relative improvement in debt 
ratios. The scenario underlines that if the current account deficit, FDI inflows, real GDP growth 
and GDP deflator were at their historical averages, debt ratios would significantly improve. In 
comparison to the baseline scenario, lower debt ratios in this scenario mainly stem from a 
higher historical GDP deflator at about 8.5 percent compared to 2 percent in the projection 
period (see box).  

VII. The debt-to-GDP threshold is breached in the case of a one-time 30 percent 
depreciation of the CFA franc. Following a one-time 30 percent nominal depreciation relative 
to the baseline in 2013, the PV of debt-to-GDP ratio would breach its threshold as early as 
2016, and remain above it until 2032. The breach of thresholds is large and protracted.  In 
addition to a one-time nominal depreciation, Niger is also vulnerable to a worsening in its 
financing terms during the projected period, as the PV of debt-to-GDP ratio would also breach 
its threshold from 2020 onwards.  

IV. PUBLIC DSA INCLUDING DOMESTIC DEBT 
V. As in the previous DSA, considering public debt does not change the analysis. 
Domestic debt includes arrears, debt to the central bank (BCEAO) for statutory advances and 

63 The terms are expected to be 1.5 percent interest rate, 20 years maturity and 9 years grace period, compared to a 
3 percent interest rate margin over LIBOR, 10 year maturity and one year grace period for the guarantee. 
64 As in the previous DSA, the large residuals shown in table 1a and 1b reflect capital grants that the country is 
projected to receive thanks to the more stable political and economic environment.  The large 2013 residuals also 
result from the amortization of the previously non-concessional contracted debt from CNPC, a, transaction reflected 
by large FDI outlows in that particular year.

the SDR allocation, and government securities.  The public debt ratios remain relatively low 
under the different scenarios except for the most extreme shock. The most extreme shock (real 
GDP growth being set at its historical average minus one standard deviation in 2013-2014) is 
assumed to negatively affect nominal revenue while keeping the level of government spending 
the same as in the baseline, consequently leading to an increase in primary deficit and financing 
needs. This is reflected by the PV of debt-to-GDP and the PV of debt-to-revenue ratios more 
than doubling during the projection period.  

V. PRIVATE DEBT DYNAMICS 
VI. The current DSA includes preliminary information on private debt provided by the 
authorities. The main flows related to this category are linked to the large ongoing oil and 
uranium projects. The estimates incorporate the impact of the contracting of a loan by the 
refinery Soraz (60 percent privately owned) in 2011, and the expected gradual disbursement 
and subsequent repayment of a loan of about 1.4 billion euro from a foreign investor to finance 
the new uranium mine Imouraren. Including this debt, the stock of external debt would reach 
56 percent of GDP in 2013. Amortization of this loan is projected to start from 2017 onwards, 
thus gradually decreasing the stock of private external debt.  

VI. CONCLUSION 
VII. On the basis of the updated DSA, Niger remains subject to moderate risk of debt 
distress.  Although the grant element of new borrowing is projected to improve compared to 
the previous DSA in the short run, the stock of public external debt is expected to increase 
significantly, following the refinancing of the $880 million Soraz loan in 2013. This loan will 
replace the existing private non-concessional financing of the refinery, which was 40 percent 
guaranteed by the State, thereby substantially increasing the stock of public debt. The country’s 
level of debt and the government’s involvement in the financing of natural resources projects 
keep Niger very much vulnerable to adverse shocks, as demonstrated by the deterioration of the 
debt indicators in the extreme shock scenarios.  

VIII. Niger’s continued risk of debt distress calls for a limited government involvement 
in financing natural resource projects. It also underlines the need to remain vigilant in terms 
of seeking concessional new borrowing. Non-concessional borrowing should only be 
considered for well-assessed, high-yield commercial and infrastructure projects that will 
generate sufficient government revenue to cover debt service related to the projects.  

IX. The Nigerian Authorities have indicated their agreement with the conclusions 
reached in this DSA. In particular, the authorities have stated that the result of moderate debt 
distress level, as well as staff recommendations in terms of limiting government involvement in 
financing natural resources projects, are consistent with a debt sustainability analysis the 
Technical Commission from National Public Debt Committee conducted in October 2012.    

101 

 
	
 
 
 
Baseline Scenario Assumptions 
The baseline macroeconomic scenario for 2012-32 is based on the following assumptions: 
• 
Real GDP growth is projected to increase to an average of about 6.2 percent a year in 
2013-32, reflecting increasing production developments in the extractive industries and higher non-
resource GDP growth as private sector expands and business climate is improved. Inflation is 
projected to remain stable at 1.8 percent over the projection period; compared to historical values, 
The lower projected inflation reflects lower expected international food price inflation and the 
recent average inflation of around 2 percent65.  
• 
The revenue-to-GDP ratio is projected to rise from 16 percent in 2012 to 21.5 percent in 
2032, reflecting revenue generating developments in the extractive industries, further structural 
reforms aiming at improving revenue collection and a more diversified private sector.  
• 
Primary Expenditure is expected to increase from 25.3 percentage points of GDP in 2012 to 
29.8 percent of GDP in 2032, mostly driven by capital expenditure that is projected to increase from 
13.3 percent of GDP in 2012 to stabilize at around 17.2 in 2032. The ambitious government 
investment program is expected to result in an increase in infrastructure spending, including large 
transport and irrigation projects in the pipeline. Infrastructure projects that would be financed by 
non-concessional lending were assumed to be occurring only in the cases where sufficient 
government revenue can cover debt service related to the projects, but there is still too much 
uncertainty at this point in time to include it in the present DSA. The basic balance (the fiscal 
balance net of grants and externally-financed capital expenditure) remains in surplus from 2022 
onward (complying with the WAEMU regional convergence criterion).  
• 
The current account deficit is projected to significantly decline from 17.2 percent of GDP in 
2012 to about only 9.5 percent of GDP in 2032. Exports are projected to increase from 25.4 percent 
of GDP to 34.7 percent in 2032, as oil and uranium exports expand and the economy diversifies. 
After a brief decline, imports would increase again before stabilizing, in line with foreign direct 
investment patterns.  
• 
Following a few years of substantial FDI inflows linked mostly to the oil investment, net 
FDI is projected to decline from a peak of 17.5 percent of GDP in 2010 as the large investment 
projects come to completion, and in line with the delay in the large investment project related to 
Imouraren. A large FDI outflow in 2013 will be recorded due to the reclassification of the Soraz loan 
in that same year, previously considered an FDI, intra-company inflow now defined as public debt. 
Assuming the start of repayment of the Imouraren debt-creating FDI, FDI is reduced in 2018. 
• 
Total external financing is expected to gradually decrease, from 10.7 percent of GDP in 
2012 to about 8.8 percent of GDP in 2032. As in the previous DSA, this assumption relates to the 
reduction in Niger´s borrowing needs and the expected increase in per capita GDP. Grants would 
represent about 62 percent of total external financing on average during the period. The discount rate 
is 3 percent, a lower rate compared to the previous DSA rate of 4 percent.  

65 The drop in GDP deflator in 2012 results from a depreciation of the exchange rate in that year.

1/ Var iables include rea l GDP growth, growth o f GDP deflator (in U.S. do llar terms ), non-interes t current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows . 
2/ Assumes that the interes t rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage po ints higher than in the baseline., while grace and matur ity per iods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Expo rts va lues are assumed to rema in permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (imp licitly assuming
an offsetting adjustment in impor t levels ). 
4/ Includes officia l and pr ivate trans fers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in do llar /loca l currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to a ll s tress scenar ios except for A2 (less favorable financing ) in which the terms on a ll new financing are as specified in footno te 2.

Annex 14: Results of Stakeholder Consultations and FY12 Country Survey 

Stakeholders’ Feedback 

In October 2012, the Niger Country office conducted extensive consultations with key 
constituencies and opinion-makers in Niger including governments, parliamentarians, the 
media, youth, academics, the private sector, CSOs and other community groups. The 
discussions took place in the capital Niamey as well as in the regions of Tillabery, Dosso, 
Tahoua and Maradi. Although different groups brought diverse perspectives, there were 
significant areas of agreement: 

In the agriculture sector, there was a common consensus to create new opportunities in 
rural areas, notably for youth and to reduce migration to urban centers. In the same vein, 
there was an emphasis on the importance of processing and transforming products at the local 
level to add value to exports (for ex. seeds, onions, tomatoes, sesame, potatoes). The credit-
granting process of some projects was considered an issue for some farmers, including the fact 
that some projects do not accept land properties as personal contributions in order to access these 
grants. 
The education sector, with a focus on quality of education outcomes, was a consistent and 
recurring theme throughout the discussions. Key amongst the issues featuring prominently 
were (i) ways to end contracting in the sector and focus on quality; (ii) addressing skills 
development of youth and putting an emphasis on adult literacy, (iii). Another issue which was 
put on the table regarding the elaboration of basic education projects is the variable relating to 
the discrepancy between nomadic and sedentary environments which is not always taken into 
account.  

Infrastructure and transport are considered vital for regional integration and economic 
opportunities. As a result, the implication of the Bank Group in the upcoming sub-regional 
railway project and the finalization of the Dosso Dry Port are key priorities for the population. 
The recent $203 million supplemental effort provided by the Bank in the Kandadji program to 
create a Growth Pole has been saluted by all stakeholders and maintained that its must be 
monitored carefully to ensure a proper implementation and timely execution. 

On population growth and gender, most representatives felt the need for Bank Group support 
in conducting a socio-cultural analysis including regional diversity to study social behaviors 
towards demography. The increasingly rapid annual growth population (3.3%) and the extremely 
high fertility rate which stands at 7.6 children per woman are viewed as one of the strongest 
impediments to economic growth. Besides, the loss of young girls in the education system must 
attract the attention of the Bank to help find ways to eradicate the access bottleneck between 
primary school and middle-school, and help support mitigating measures to reduce early 
marriages. Finally, there should be a necessary focus on ways to create measures to facilitate 
access to land. 

Corruption is seen as a major impediment to an inclusive development in many sectors. 
Government participants, however, did not mention the issue of anti-corruption much, but 
several did nevertheless underline the need for a strengthening of institutions and the importance 

112 

 
	
 
 
 
 
 
 
of the Bank Group supporting the Government in this area. The process of decentralization was 
seen as crucial step in dealing with the governance challenge as it would help build local 
government capacity to plan and manage budgets and services but also create a platform between 
decentralized governments and the Bank in order to support directly local development plans 
were very important topics raised in the regions visited. 
Increased role of civil society actors as a mechanism for assisting, communicating and 
monitoring Bank Group-financed projects and CPS implementation. Most CSOs noted the 
importance of ensuring that the Bank Group supports greater transparency of government 
decisions as well freedom of information.  Media also needs to help inform the general public 
about Bank programs and elaborate a communication strategy with them. Members of parliament 
mentioned the need to strengthen the capacity of parliament to provide checks and balances to 
the executive, especially through the Parliamentary Network of the Bank Group and the IMF. 
Re-organizing the legislative economic framework to help create more businesses 
(especially SMEs) was a predominant theme for the private sector. This will enhance their 
productivity, competitiveness, and help them do the transition from an informal and commercial 
economy to a formal and investment-oriented one. 

FY12 Country Survey  

In October and November 2012, 300 stakeholders of the World Bank in Niger were invited 
to provide their opinions on the Bank’s assistance to the country by participating in a 
country survey. Respondents were asked about: general issues facing Niger, their overall 
attitudes toward the Bank; the World Bank’s effectiveness and results; the Bank’s knowledge 
work and activities; working with the World Bank; the Bank’s future role in Niger, and the 
Bank’s communication and information sharing. 

Priorities:  Perceived development priorities have shifted since FY 07 with far greater emphasis 
currently on corruption and public sector governance. The issue of corruption emerges in a 
number of ways as a key priority in terms of development, poverty and growth. Respondents 
report that they recognize a significant role for the Bank in the area of public sector governance – 
aligned with the perceived priorities.  Along with governance and corruption, education, rural 
development and energy and oil development are viewed as important aspects of growth and/or 
poverty reduction in Niger.  Domestic private sector development is seen as an important aspect 
of growth and also an area where respondents see value in Bank involvement. 

When considering the priorities as identified by stakeholders, it is worth considering how the 
Bank’s efforts and emphasis are aligned with these perceptions.  In addition it is important to 
look at perceptions of the Bank’s effectiveness in these key areas.  Ratings have stayed relatively 
high in key sectors: poverty, education and public sector governance, but they have diminished 
in agriculture, demography, growth, domestic private sector development, gender. The survey 
findings are a good starting point for further discussion with stakeholders and internally. 

How the Bank works in Niger: The survey findings suggest that the Bank is doing very well in 
terms of how it collaborates with government and other donors. The importance of its future 
involvement in Niger is not questioned.  Areas that the team might consider further exploring, as 

113 

 
	
 
 
 
they received quite negative ratings include:  flexibility (in terms of its products and services and 
in light of changing country circumstances), staff accessibility and responsiveness and openness 
in terms of sharing its data and other information, and the speed of disbursement of funds and 
overall speed. While the speed of disbursement is often difficult to change because of 
circumstances on the ground, behaviors such as accessibility and responsiveness are certainly 
areas that can change.  In terms of overall attitudes, The Bank is working within a positive 
context.  The Bank is viewed as relevant and respectful.  In addition, one of the most positive 
trend in findings to emerge from the survey is related to the perception of how realistic the 
programs are, in Niger, that the Bank supports. Ratings increased significantly from 3.3 to 6.5 on 
a ten point scale.   

Knowledge: There are a number of findings that are important to consider overall in Niger.  The 
Bank is most valued for its financial resources with recognition of the value of technical 
assistance and training. However, as in FY 07, there is less recognition of the value of the Bank’s 
knowledge, advice, etc.  Some of the concerns expressed in the survey findings include how well 
the knowledge is disseminated and translated and whether there is an adequate level of 
stakeholder involvement during preparation. Use of the Bank’s website has increased from 29% 
in FY 07 to 56% in FY 13.  Many modes of dissemination and distribution must continue to be 
considered. 

Collaboration: Throughout the survey the view emerges amongst many that there needs to be 
greater outreach beyond government.  A third of stakeholders attribute slow or failed reform 
efforts to an inadequate level of citizen participation and an equal amount says that the Bank 
would be of greater value if it reached out beyond government. This is important to consider 
particularly in light of the Bank’s overall emphasis on ensuring openness, accountability and 
voice in countries.

Annex 16: Axes of the PDES 

Axis 1: Strengthening the credibility and efficiency of public institutions 
The PDES is built on the Government of Niger’s desire to provide a new foundation for 
dynamic, economic and social development.  Strong public institutions are to guarantee 
political stability and respect for human rights, leading individuals to invest and participate in the 
economy.  This is expected to improve the overall efficiency of the administration and public 
services to ensure fairness and equality of citizens' access to them.   

Axis II: Creating the conditions for inclusive, sustainable and balanced development 
The second programmatic area of the PDES seeks to strengthen the preconditions for the 
achievement of sustainable inclusive economic growth.  These include (i) peace and security; 
(ii) control of demographic growth; (iii) the preservation and sustainable management of natural 
resources; and (iv) a balanced regional development.  These programs will be critical to 
achieving the goals as set out in the PDES.   

Axis III: Food security and sustainable agricultural development 

The third axis of the PDES represents one of the key initiatives of the government – the 3N 
initiative – Nigeriens Nourish Nigeriens.  The initiative aims, firstly, to ensure sufficient 
supply and quality of food for all Nigeriens based primarily on the development of local 
production and, secondly, to increase the resilience of households in food crises and natural 
disaster.  Key areas of intervention include (i) growth and diversification of agro-forestry-
pastoral and fish products, (ii) the regular supply of rural and urban markets for agricultural 
products and food, (iii) the improvement of people’s resilience to climate changes, food 
insecurity and disasters, (iv) improving the nutritional status of populations, and (v) sector policy 
coordination, mobilization, and empowerment of stakeholders. 

Axis IV. Competitive and diversified economy for accelerated and inclusive growth. 
To emerge as an economy that is both competitive and diversified, the PDES envisages an 
accelerated and inclusive growth that will leverage Niger’s natural resource potential.  The 
PDES takes into account Niger’s potential of mining and hydraulic resources and promotes a 
long-term transformation of the structure of the economy in order to reduce vulnerability to 
climatic shocks. While recognizing that the agricultural sector is essential for social and 
economic development, the PDES also identifies the extractive industries as the main lever for 
accelerated growth and will seek to promote activities that will facilitate the exploitation of these 
resources. The implementation of a large-scale program for public investments in infrastructures 
such as the Kandadji hydro electrical dam, the Salkadamna mine; and the promotion of rail 
development will be prioritized under the PDES with the aim to economic diversification and 
reducing the impact of Niger’s landlocked situation.  The Plan also aims to create 50,000 jobs a 
year over the 2012-2015 period including through public private partnership (PPP).  

Axis V. Promotion of Social development  
This axis aims at improving the level of development of social indicators through enhanced 
access of the populations to basic social services and the implementation of a social 

116 

 
	
 
protection policy for the most vulnerable populations.  The main results revolve around 
improvement of the health status of the populations, strengthening of educational levels and 
knowledge, more equitable access to drinking water and sanitation infrastructures, reduction of 
gender inequality and inequity, social protection of the most vulnerable populations, 
improvement of the living environment and protection and the promotion of the youth.

- Niger qualified as Compliant country by EITI Board in March

- EITI-Post Compliance Program is under implementation with 
the Bank Group support 

 

Article 150 of the Constitution now states that “exploration, exploitation 
licenses and contracts of natural resources and subsurface as well as 
revenues paid to the State, on a company-by-company basis and 
disaggregated, are fully published in the Official Journal of the Republic of 
the Niger” 
 Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) and extractive industry (EI) 
companies are actively involved in governing the process, including 
with the Government (Ministry of Mining and Oil, Ministry of 
Finance).  
In the process of creating: 
o a multi-stakeholder framework for strategic thinking which 
will formulate recommendations for decision-support tools 
in anticipation of a changing EI context; 
o mechanisms of investments in the extractive sector 
The Bank Group provided EITI advisers and consultants to train thirty local 
EI CSO leaders in areas of exercising citizen oversight to ensure 
transparency and good governance in the EI. This TA program also aims at: 
 
sharing of international best practice; 
 providing training, information and public awareness on the 
nature of the exploitation of natural resources; 
 promoting advocacy, and lobbying for increased transparency in 
the use of mining, oil, and gas resources; 
 Encouraging greater inclusion of gender in the EITI. 
WB support has helped improve debates at the government level but also 
among the population through forums by: 
 CSOs (ROTAB, Publish What You Pay, Transparency International 
– Niger Chapter), trade unions working in IE, Journalists, students; 
 
local elected representatives, members of parliament;  
 Cabinet members, advisors of the Presidency and students. 
Through reconciliation of payments and revenue collection, EITI reports 
(2005-2010) showed that GoN received an average of 66 billion CFA per 
year ($132m USD) over 6 years, a figure considered as very inadequate to be 
a catalyst for the country’s development goals. 
The Court of Auditors conducts periodic sectoral audits   
Creation of Networks of journalists and CSOs focused on EI
