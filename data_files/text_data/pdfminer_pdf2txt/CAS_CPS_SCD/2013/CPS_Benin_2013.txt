Executive Summary 

i. 
Benin is a low income country of nearly ten million people with a per capita income 
of US$800 in 2011. Economic output has been driven by agriculture and services, particularly 
import/export activities through the Port of Cotonou. Agriculture accounts for over 30 percent of 
GDP and provides 70 percent of the country's employment. Cotton is the primary export 
commodity. The informal sector contributes up to three-fourths of GDP. Re-export trade with 
Nigeria, mostly informal, accounts for 20 percent of GDP and 25 percent of government 
revenue. 
ii. 
GDP growth averaged 3.9 percent over the last decade, a rate insufficient to curb 
high poverty rates. Sustained economic growth of at least seven percent per year is needed to 
alleviate poverty as the population increases at a very high rate of 3.2 percent per annum. In 
2011, poverty was estimated at 36.2 percent. Benin is unlikely to meet most of the Millennium 
Development Goals (MDGs) by 2015. The agenda for reducing vulnerability and improving 
resilience remains largely unfinished.  
iii. 
However, Benin has three comparative advantages. (1) It borders Nigeria, the largest 
market in Africa; (2) the Port of Cotonou offers the nearest access to the sea for several 
hinterland countries; and (3) it is endowed with fertile soils and plentiful water resources.  
iv. 
The strategic vision of this Country partnership Strategy (CPS) is to harness 
Benin’s comparative advantages to spur sustainable, shared economic growth. To date, 
Benin has not been unable to capitalize on its advantages primarily because of a weak 
governance environment, with relatively high levels of corruption, entrenched interests/rents, 
lack of transparency and accountability, “clientelism”, ineffective civil service recruitment and 
promotion procedures, limited implementation capacity, limited budget execution capabilities, 
ineffective and lengthy procurement procedures, a weak investment climate, and an ineffective 
judicial system. 
v. 
The CPS is designed to strengthen governance so that Benin can capitalize on its 
comparative advantages. It is organized along three pillars. The foundation pillar focuses upon 
“Governance and public sector capacity", the other two pillars address "Sustainable growth, 
competitiveness and employment", and "Access to basic social services and social inclusion". 
Thirteen broad outcomes are associated with these pillars. 
vi. 
Building on Benin’s comparative advantage in agriculture will require public 
investment in rural transportation and water management and irrigation, together with 
institutional reforms that foster private investment and facilitate increased productivity and 
effective input distribution and marketing of crops. There are also many opportunities to increase 
value-added in cotton and food processing.  
vii. 
In the trade/commerce and services sectors, increasing productivity and fostering 
market growth will necessitate investments in road, rail and telecommunications services, and 
reforms to improve the efficiency of transport systems; strengthen customs administration; and 
create an investment climate more conducive to private investment. 
viii. The CPS design is informed by the lessons of the previous CAS, a recent client 
survey, and broad consultations with stakeholders. It is aligned with the 2011 World Bank 
Strategy for Africa and its 2012 update. It was prepared on the basis of the following guiding 

viii 

 
 
 
principles: selectivity and focus on results; ownership of the reform agenda by the Government; 
fewer, larger operations; complementarily with other donors’ programs; and leverage of other 
donor financing and trust funds. The CPS also builds on the Government’s request for a strong 
knowledge-based relationship with the Bank and flexible, on-demand service.  
ix. While on-going Bank operations are quite diverse and will continue to influence the 
composition of the overall portfolio, this CPS does not propose to invest new IDA resources 
in agriculture, judicial reform, national transport, education, water, or HIV/AIDS. 
However, the Bank Group may participate in the policy dialogue in these sectors by contributing 
some ESW/AAA or in an advisory capacity. Investments and TA in these sectors through trust 
funds (TF) managed by the Bank are also options. 
x. 
In addition to mainstreaming gender throughout Bank operations, the CPS will 
support the development of a system of 
information gathering to support the 
implementation of the Government’s policy on gender equality. At present, the lack of 
disaggregated data limits the sphere of intervention in this domain.  
xi. 
The total IDA indicative envelope for Benin during the five year CPS period (FY13-
FY17) is SDR 328.6 million, or US$493.7 million. Investment projects and budget support 
operations reinforce each other. This is a joint exercise with IFC and MIGA. In particular, IFC 
support will complement IDA interventions to improve the business environment and to develop 
PPPs in social and economic infrastructure. 
xii. 
Endogenous economic risks are mitigated in the CPS by a series of programmatic 
DPLs designed to keep the macro framework in good order, support the fight against corruption, 
and strengthen public finance management and procurement. Potential external shocks, such as 
the loss of trade revenue should Nigeria undertake broad trade liberalization reforms, or the 
occurrence of external price shocks, are mitigated through measures to improve the 
competitiveness of the Port of Cotonou; develop the manufacturing sector; broaden the economic 
base; diversify agriculture production and improve productivity. External political risks such as 
the extension of the armed conflict in Mali to the rest of the region are addressed by other 
development partners. 
xiii. This CPS introduces a series of new approaches to strengthen the outcome of the 
Bank’s intervention in Benin. Specifically, (i) the DPO series will be supported by a Capacity 
Building operation that will address the Government’s implementation constraints; (ii) Bank 
intervention will be more focused, leaving other donors and global Funds to take the lead in 
some key sectors; (iii) Output-Based-Aid mechanisms are introduced in PPPs in the health and 
water sectors, together with Results Based Financing (RBF) mechanisms in the Capacity 
Building operation; (iv) emphasis is placed on regional approaches in infrastructure, in particular 
hydropower, transport, and in the regulatory sector, with a focus on OHADA regulation; and (vi) 
a new approach will be followed on the design of DPOs with triggers going more in depth into 
the reforms of key sectors. In addition, portfolio management will be strengthened through 
regular exchanges with counterparts and closer oversight by the Bank.

I. Country Context and Development Agenda 

1. 
Benin has significant growth potential in trade/commerce, and in agriculture and 
related industries. Benin is bordered to the East by Nigeria, home to a fast growing middle class 
of 60 million people; the country is endowed with a viable port and is a natural trade corridor for 
hinterland countries. In addition, the country’s favorable meteorology, fertile land and abundant 
water resources remain largely untapped. These comparative advantages offer opportunities to 
spur higher growth, a necessity in the effort to reduce poverty given the country’s persistently 
high population growth rate. 
2. 
Governance problems have hindered the country in taking advantage of its 
comparative advantages. Benin's public administration faces efficiency challenges and has 
limited capacity to implement reform. Corruption is considered endemic as shown by the ratings 
of international governance indicators. The business climate is perceived as unattractive by many 
investors. Reforms to curb practices which distort resource allocation, erode the business and 
investment climate, reduce economic growth, and slow the pace of poverty reduction are needed 
to change this situation. 
A. Political Context 
3. 
Benin abandoned Marxism in 1990 to embrace democracy. Presidential elections 
since the National Conference of 1990 were generally considered to be free and fair and transfers 
of power have been peaceful. An independent National Assembly, the largely unimpaired 
expression of fundamental civil liberties, and a certain restraint and maturity shown by the 
political leadership, have transformed Benin into a buoyant democracy. However, the judiciary 
needs to be fundamentally reformed, modernized and strengthened, together with the legislature 
and the civil service.  
4. 
In March 2011, Dr. Boni Yayi was re-elected to a second and final five-year 
Presidential term and his alliance won a comfortable majority in the National Assembly. 
With a new mandate and a cooperative and supportive legislature, the Executive Office has 
pressed on with an ambitious reform program.  
B. Economic Developments and Prospects 
5. 
GDP growth over the last two decades averaged four percent annually, below the 
Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) average of 4.6 percent. Benin was a strong economic growth 
performer up to earlier 2000. But growth declined over the recent years as shown in Figure 1. 
Such performance generated only modest increases in per capita incomes as the population grew 
by 3.2 percent per annum over the same period. This demographic pressure poses immense 
challenges to the Government, particularly as it struggles to keep up with the demand for public 
services(See Box 1 for more details). About 45 percent of the population is urbanized.

6. 
Economic output has been driven by agriculture and services, while industry has 
remained under-developed. The primary sector accounts for over 30 percent of GDP and 
provides nearly 70 percent of the country's employment. Cotton is the primary export commodity 
representing 25 to 40 percent of exports. The sector faces several constraints, including climatic 
volatility, a lack of water management, weaknesses in input procurement and distribution, and 
under-developed rural roads and market infrastructure. The performance of cotton is undermined 
by organizational difficulties and subject to political economy events (see Box 2).  
Box 1: The population factor: demographic dividend or youth bulge? 

Population growth is the result of several factors: (i) a high and steady level of fertility (4.9 
children per woman in 2011) due to early marriages, low contraceptive usage (7.9percent in 
2011), unmet family planning needs (32.6 percent in 2011 compared with 27 percent in 2001), 
and high fertility levels among adolescents (15-19 years); (ii) gradually declining mortality, 
and (iii) significant migratory flows. The population is expected to continue to grow and 
remain young in the coming decades as shown in the population pyramids below, in contrast to 
South Asia. High population growth creates challenges in terms of the demand for social 
infrastructure and services (e.g., education, health, nutrition, employment, housing and urban 
management) and the availability of factors of production. For instance, the country will need 
to hire about 1,450 new teachers every year between 2013 and 2020 at the primary level, and 
build and equip 31 to 37 health centers every year between 2006 and 2030. For the 
demographic transition and to be able to take advantage of the demographic dividend, it would 
be important for Benin to make faster progress in reducing child mortality (and morbidity), 
expand reproductive health services and promote modern contraceptive usage, in addition to 
high level support for population policy and nationwide advocacy and communication efforts. 
Promoting gender equality, better access to health and education services, women's labor force 
participation and urbanization are longer term factors to reduce the fertility rate.

Box 2: Benin Cotton – A patched history of restructuring 
Reform context and sector policy since 2006 
In April 2006, the Government restructured the cotton sector by privatizing SONAPRA and 
closing down the inter-professional cotton association (AIC). In September 2007, the 
Government announced the transfer of control of SONAPRA to the private sector, but then 
almost immediately (October 2007) annulled the transaction due to purported irregularities in 
how the mixed ownership company had been set up and state assets transferred onto its balance 
sheet. Earlier in 2007, the Government unilaterally abrogated the Accord Cadre defining the 
respective roles of the Government and the AIC; and attempted to reintegrate sector management 
back into the public sphere. Strong resistance from AIC stakeholders led eventually to a 
negotiated agreement in the form of a new Accord Cadre by end-2008. Meanwhile, by mid-2008, 
the Government hastily re-launched a privatization process and by October 2008 announced the 
transfer of SONAPRA assets to SODECO, a mixed ownership company, in which the state 
retained 49 percent with 51 percent owned by a private investor. The privatization transaction 
was conducted under a tight schedule and modalities that resulted in limited bids and a private 
ginner securing a dominant industry position. The Government and AIC also undertook 
consultations that resulted in a draft medium-term strategy in late 2008. Over this period, though 
the Bank’s cotton project closed in mid-2008, ad hoc on demand advice was provided by the 
Bank to the Government on sector policy and institutional reforms.

Suspension of the cotton sector agreement in early 2012 
In April 2012, after allegations of mismanagement by AIC, the Government once again annulled the 
Accord Cadre and took over the management of the entire value chain. Government assumed 
responsibility for the assistance of SONAPRA and the Office National de Soutien des Revenus (ONS) the 
2012/13 crop season which was the most productive in several years. Looking forward, the State is 
considering moving to a zoned concession system like some neighboring countries. The Government has 
requested support from the World Bank in restructuring the cotton sector. In December 2012, the Bank 
presented to Cabinet the lessons of experience from zonal systems elsewhere in the region. Given the 
timeframe needed to either pursue this restructuring path or return to an improved form of the prior 
system, Government will most likely remain in charge of the 2013/14 crop season.

7. 
The secondary sector, accounting for 15 percent of GDP, remains embryonic and 
dominated by small-scale agro-food units. The business environment, coupled with restrictive 
trade policies in Nigeria, create incentives to engage in trading with Nigeria.

The tertiary sector is poorly structured and dominated by informal activities in 
which women play a large role. Trade and re-export activities with Nigeria and other 
neighboring landlocked countries represent the bulk of the tertiary sector. Re-export trade with 
Nigeria, largely informal, accounts for 20 percent of formal GDP and 25 percent of government 
revenue. Table 1 illustrates sectoral contributions to real growth over the past nine years.

9. 
The global economic crisis and internal shocks have slowed growth in recent years. 
Between 2009 and 2012, growth averaged 3.1 percent per year, well below the Sub Saharan 
Africa (SSA) average of 4.6 percent. This modest performance is largely due to a drop in cotton 
production, the global economic crisis and severe floods in 2010. In 2011, growth rebounded to 
3.5 percent. Projections for 2012 (see Table 2) were scaled down following the partial removal 
of fuel subsidies by the Nigerian government and growth is estimated to remain at 3.5 percent.  
10. 
The Beninese economy is deeply interconnected with that of Nigeria (Box 3). 
Nigeria’s restrictive trade policies, including import bans on certain goods and high tariff rates 
on some commodities generate significant business opportunities and custom revenue for Benin, 
but the country is also highly vulnerable to fiscal reforms and trade liberalization in Nigeria; the 
reduction of fuel subsidies on January 1, 2012increased fuel prices in Benin by 50 percent.

Nigeria is Benin’s main trade partner. Exports to Nigeria accounted for 43.2 percent of total 
exports in 2011 and Nigeria was the second origin of imports with 5.3 percent of total official 
imports. The real level of trade is much higher as most informal trade is not recorded. For instance, 
about 90 percent of Benin’s fuel supply is provided through informal channels from Nigeria and sold 
along the road in small bottles by informal retailers under the name “Kpayo”. Large quantities of 
products including, among others, rice, tobacco and alcohol, used cars, animal fats, vegetable oil, 
iron, and steel are re-exported to Nigeria by Beninese importers. 
Recently, transit trade to neighboring Sahel countries and re-export trade to Nigeria have 
slowed down. The reduction in some tariffs and the removal of certain quotas and bans in Nigeria 
appears to be the main factor. The reduction in trade is estimated to have negatively impacted Benin's 
GDP growth by approximately two percentage points and significantly affected fiscal revenues 
(about CFAF 60 billion in 2011).   
Pursuit of trade liberalization in Nigeria will continue to affect transit and re-export trade and 
fiscal revenue in Benin. Trade policy changes in Nigeria could have severe consequences on 
economic activity in Benin, through the following channels: (i) a reduction in re-export trade; (ii) 
fiscal revenue losses; and (iii) adverse social impact as large numbers of people make their living 
trading with Nigeria.

11. 
The medium term outlook predicts modest incremental real per capita growth of 
about one percentage point per annum on average. Key factors behind this forecast are: (i) 
the implementation of the Government’s Strategic Plan for Agriculture Sector Recovery 
(PSRSA); (ii) reform at the Port of Cotonou; and (iii) a gradual resumption of global economic 
activity after 2013. Real GDP growth is projected to average about 4.2 percent over the CPS 
period. Private investment is forecast to remain stable at around 12.7 percent of GDP, reflecting 
the relatively poor business environment. Additional concessional and non-concessional foreign 
resources will be required to finance the Government's ambitious investment program. Inflation 
is expected to remain below the three percent WAEMU convergence criterion.   
12. 
Benin has a low risk of debt distress according to the 2012 Debt Sustainability 
Analysis (DSA).  Highly Indebted Poor Countries(HIPC) and Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative 
(MDRI) debt relief has reduced Benin’s external debt stock from 47 percent of GDP in 2002 to 
17.7 percent in 2011. The baseline and stress test scenarios showed that total debt levels present 
low vulnerabilities to external shocks, though lack of progress on the policy front could weaken 
debt sustainability. Debt indicators have deteriorated slightly in 2012 compared to 2011. Central 
government debt increased by 1.3 percent of GDP; debt service to exports ratio increased from 
5.0 to 5.6 percent.

C. Social Context 
13. While Benin is unlikely to meet most of the MDGs by 2015, progress has been 
accomplished. Three out of eight MDGs are attainable, namely: (i) halting and reversing the 
spread of HIV/AIDS, (ii) reducing under-5 mortality by two thirds; and (iii) reducing by half the 
proportion of individuals without access to safe water. Child mortality has decreased from 184 
deaths per 100,000 live births in 1990 to 70 in 2011, (target 61). This is a notable achievement, 
not only because of the magnitude of the reduction 1, but also because it was attained mainly 
through the distribution of bed nets which were supported by the recently closed Bank’s Malaria 
Control Booster Project. Conversely, the objectives concerning universal primary education, 
gender equality, maternal health and global partnership for development are unlikely to be met.

Health Sector 
14. 
Benin has succeeded in stabilizing its HIV-AIDS epidemic. Since 2002, HIV 
prevalence has remained below two percent; it was estimated at 1.2 percent in 2011, with a slight 
disparity between women (1.4 percent) and men (0.9 percent).  
15. 
It is unclear whether maternal mortality has been reduced significantly since 2006. 
The current estimate (2011) is 397 deaths per one hundred thousand births, which is roughly 
similar to 2006. Benin’s maternal mortality ratio is thus similar to the ones observed in 
comparable countries, such as Zambia, Kenya or Cote d’Ivoire. 
16. On issues related to reproductive health and population growth, the Government 
has not been able to alter the state of affairs significantly. The National Policy on Population 
has not been revised since 2006 and no action plan or budget for its implementation have been 
produced. As a result, Benin has no policy in place for improving reproductive health. This issue 
requires a more concerted effort, greater attention and awareness. 
17. 
As for child health, as mentioned earlier, malaria-related mortality has decreased 
most likely thanks to the massive distribution of bed nets. Indeed, the proportion of children 
sleeping under a bed net increased from 20 percent in 2006 to 76 percent in 2011 (DHS 2011). 
But other problems faced by children such as pneumonia and malnutrition have not been 
effectively addressed. However, with the nationwide introduction of RBF in the health sector, 
governance and accountability within health care centers should quickly improve and thus 
enhance the overall quality and efficiency of health care delivery systems. 
18. 
The Government’s food and nutrition reform program has suffered from weak 
institutional arrangements. Various disjointed, small-scale sectoral components housed in the 
Agriculture, Health and Family Affairs ministries have not been able to halt the deterioration in 
nutrition indicators. Malnutrition of children under five remains high and has worsened over the 
past ten years. Benin’s malnutrition rates (45 percent for stunting and 16 percent for wasting 
according to the 2011 DHS) are above the average of West and Central Africa. Stunting and 
wasting are of greater concern in rural areas, though prevalence is marginally lower among 
female children compared to males. Improving governance and accountability of multiple and 
multi-sectoral stakeholders will go a long way toward improving health and nutrition outcomes. 
Environment and Quality of Life 
Benin is facing serious environmental problems in urban and semi-urban areas 
19. 
leading to degradation in the quality of life. Cotonou, Porto Novo and Parakou currently host 
most of the urban population and contribute approximately 58 percent of GDP. These ratios are 
expected to continue to increase as the country urbanizes. All urban and peri-urban areas face 
significant environmental challenges related to inadequate and insufficient water supply, 

7 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
sanitation and waste collection systems, in addition to air pollution. The situation is aggravated 
further by recurrent floods.  
Education sector 
20. 
Tangible progress has been achieved in access to basic education. The gross pre-
school enrollment rate (GER) rose from 4.5 percent in 2005/06 to 12.5 percent in 2011/12, 
exceeding the target of 10 percent; and the enrollment rate for primary education increased from 
93 percent to 119.7 percent, against a target of 112 percent in 2011/12. Girls' participation 
experienced the same trend: GER increased from 86 percent in 2005/06 to 116.8 percent in 
2011/12 versus a target of 112 percent, thus reducing the gender gap. 
21. 
Benin is not on track to meet universal primary education completion targets. 
Primary education completion rates (PRC) improved from 65 percent in 2005/06 to 71.6 percent 
in 2011/12, while girls’ PRC increased from 54.3 percent in 2005/06 to 65.8 percent in 2011/12. 
This modest improvement could be explained by rapid expansion in access but also by the low 
quality and persistently high repetition and dropout rates. In 2011 the literacy rate was estimated 
at 41 percent (29 percent among women, 54 percent among men). Benin ranked respectively 
132nd and 126th out of 135 countries on the literacy rate and Enrolment in Primary Education 
Gender Gap sub-indexes 2. 
22. 
Learning outcomes in primary education show no significant improvements since 
2005. An assessment carried out in 2011 on a sample of 167 public primary schools and 35 
private primary schools showed that: 3 (i) only 28 percent of second grade students (CP) from 
public schools and 43 percent from private schools were literate; and 18 percent and 47 percent 
respectively had mastered the curriculum in mathematics; and (ii) only 12 percent of fifth grade 
(CM1) students from public schools and 42 percent from private schools were literate, and 11 
percent and 38 percent respectively had mastered the curriculum in mathematics.  
23. 
At the post-primary level, pressure is rising for increased access and better quality 
and relevance. Increasing numbers of students exiting from basic education exert pressure for 
higher enrollments in secondary, vocational and tertiary education. However, the gender gap 
widens as students move through the education system, with girls’ enrollment consistently 
lagging that of boys.  Rapid expansion puts pressure on resource availability and has a significant 
impact on quality and the relevance of the curriculum, particularly in tertiary education. The 
system must be reformed to mitigate further decline in quality. Moreover, since Benin does not 
benefit from extractive resources like many of its neighbors, its development must be more 
knowledge intensive. Higher investment in human capital will enable the country to move up the 
technological ladder and diversify into higher value, knowledge- and research-intensive activities 
which promise better returns and are less subject to competitive pressures when compared to the 
raw agricultural products on which Benin has been largely relying to date. 
Poverty incidence 
24. 
Poverty levels have remained high over the last few years. With a Human 
Development Index of 0.427 Benin was ranked 167th out of 187 countries in the 2011 Human 
Development Report. Poverty is mostly a rural phenomenon. Interestingly, households headed by 
males are more affected by monetary poverty than households headed by females (see Figure 2 
below). The incidence of poverty at the national level is estimated to be 36.2 percent in 2011,

compared to 35.2 percent in 2009 and 37 percent in 2006. This aggregate figure masks important 
urban-rural and regional differences.

25. 
Rural poverty in 2011 was 39.7 percent versus 31.4 percent in urban areas. Regionally, 
there was a 21 point spread between the poorest and the least poor Departments. Differences 
were even starker at the commune level where the difference between the poorest and least poor 
commune was 43 percentage points. The Government’s PRS targets a poverty incidence of 25 
percent by 2015. Given current and projected real economic growth and poverty trends, this 2015 
targeted poverty rate is unlikely to be met. 
26. 
Benin does not have well-established safety net systems that can be rapidly activated 
in times of crisis. In recent years, Benin was hit by global shocks, such as the food, fuel and 
financial crises that began in 2008, and by domestic shocks, such as the floods of 2010 and 2012. 
These crises have revealed shortcomings in Benin’s safety net systems. Spending on safety nets 
amounted to 0.3 percent of GDP between 2005 and 2009, well below the sub-Saharan Africa 
average of 2.3 percent. Strengthening Benin’s safety net system is essential to break the cycle of 
chronic poverty and to allow for a more effective, targeted, and timely response to future shocks.   
27. 
The Government’s 2011 Social Safety Net Review recommended a new safety net 
program combining two windows: cash transfers for the chronic poor, particularly those 
households unable to work, together with labor-intensive public works for households with 
available labor. A pilot phase of this program will begin in 2013 with IDA support under the 
Decentralized Community Driven Services Project (PSDCC).  
Gender 
28. Gender equality has been a priority of the Government over the past decade and 
was restated in its current poverty reduction strategy. The Persons and Family Code was 
enacted in 2004, and in 2009 a National Gender Promotion Policy and Action Plan were 
released. In addition, several institutions were created, including ministries dedicated to family 
affairs and employment of women and youth, and the Institute of Women, and the Observatory 
of Family, Women and Children. Abiding by his promise of including 30 percent of women in 
his Cabinet, in June 2012, President Yayi appointed eight women out of 26 ministerial postings. 
This was a first in the country's history. There have been two women sitting on the Constitutional 
Court since 1998 and this institution has been chaired by a woman for the last 20 years. There 
are no discriminatory laws constraining legal emancipation of women. 

9 

 
 
 
29. 
Economic empowerment of women has improved over the past five years thanks to 
the Government’s targeted microfinance program, of which 98 percent of clients are women. 
Benin was ranked 67th out of 134 countries on the gender gap index in the 2011 Overall 
Economic Empowerment index. Women’s labor force participation was estimated at 69 percent 
in 2011, compared to 78 percent for men. Women are primarily active in low value-added, low 
income generating and informal activities. The gender gap in literacy remains high and 
significant progress on maternal health has yet to be achieved. In 2011, only seven percent of 
legislators, senior officials or corporate manages were women. The number of women elected to 
the National Assembly increased from five out of 64 elected representatives in 1995 (7.8 
percent) to only seven of 83 (8.4 percent) after the 2011 elections. Benin was ranked 104th on the 
Political Empowerment Gender Gap sub-index in 2011 with a score of 0.066 compared to an 
average of 0.185 for the 135 countries assessed. Finally, the lack of institutional capacity for 
gender budgeting within the public administration requires attention.  
30. 
Some impediments to gender equality remain: (a) the gender gap is still high in 
education leading to early marriage for girls and high fertility rates and mortality rates, especially 
in the North; (b) while women are very active in commerce and trade, they have limited access to 
financial services, hampering their ability to scale up their economic activities; and (c) limited 
access to land, fertilizers and other inputs in the agriculture sector, although women represent an 
important share of the workforce.   
31. 
Lack of disaggregated gender data hampers the Government’s capacity to address 
gender inequality effectively. The Bank is assisting the National Statistics Bureau (INSAE) to 
set up a comprehensive baseline of gender disaggregated data which will facilitate the 
formulation of a national gender equality program. Technical assistance to upgrade INSAE skills 
in collecting and analyzing gender disaggregated data will be provided through a statistical 
capacity trust fund.  
32. 
The Bank will continue to support the authorities in their effort to promote gender 
equality. During the CPS implementation period, IDA financed operations in the private sector, 
energy and health sectors, together with the GPE financed education project will be designed to 
foster gender equality.  
D. Development Challenges and Opportunities 
33. 
Benin’s central challenge is to stimulate robust growth through higher value-added 
activities. Improving shared prosperity will require accelerated growth through private sector 
development, good governance and enhanced institutional efficiency. The business climate is 
undermined by discretionary public sector practices and insufficient transparency, particularly 
within 
the Customs administration, 
the Port of Cotonou, and 
the 
judicial system. 
Competitiveness also suffers from underinvestment in infrastructure.  
34. 
The Country Economic Memorandum of 2009 attributed the lack of growth to four 
primary constraints which continue to be critical bottlenecks today: 
(i). A distortionary and poorly administered tax system; and complex and lengthy 
customs and trade procedures; 
Poor government effectiveness, including contract enforcement, weak institutions and 
corruption; 
(iii). Costly and unreliable infrastructure services, especially electricity, domestic rail and 
road transport and communication; and 

(ii). 

10 

 
 
(iv). 

Firms’ failure to adapt technologies available internationally and innovation to 
produce at low enough cost to be profitable and competitive in foreign markets. 
35. 
The 2006 Diagnostic Trade Integration Study(DTIS) noted three main challenges for 
Benin which also remain relevant today: 
(i). Maximizing income from the cotton sector; 
(ii). Rationalizing transit and re-export trade; and 
(iii). Diversifying the country’s export base. 
The agriculture sector and other potential growth opportunities 
36. 
The agriculture sector could potentially be a strong contributor to growth and 
poverty reduction, and a large source of job creation. However, public resources are largely 
concentrated on a single crop (cotton), and farm productivity is low. In addition, access to 
improved technologies and sources of finance are limited. Farmers cannot sell their products 
easily due to a lack of adequate transport infrastructure and market facilities. Low productivity 
and labor intensive farming also contributes to large family size and continuing population 
pressure. Improving agricultural technology and productivity could have important demographic 
benefits. 
37. 
The 2008- 2015 Strategic Plan to Revitalize the Agriculture Sector (PSRSA)sets out 
the Government’s vision to transform the country into "an agricultural power" by 2015, with "a 
competitive, environmentally friendly, and wealth-creating agriculture sector, responding to the 
economic and social development needs of the Beninese population". The strategy has two main 
objectives: (i) fostering efficient and sustainable agriculture production; and (ii) improving 
agricultural diversification and competitiveness to facilitate access to markets, boost agriculture 
exports and reduce imports. 
38. Other potential long term sources of growth identified in Benin Alafia4 2025 include 
agro-business, tourism, artisanal handicraft, and the construction sectors. The global 
economic crisis has slowed the growth of these sectors. However, in 2012, the Government, 
launched the construction of six new processing plants for pineapple, cashew, mangoes, 
tomatoes, rice and yams; and the BOAD announced that it would finance the construction of the 
“Fishing road” along the coast between Cotonou and Ouidah, spurring the interest which Chinese 
investors have expressed in hotel construction.  
Improving Governance to achieve inclusive growth 
39. Governance remains hampered by a poorly trained civil service with limited 
capacity, weak fiduciary practices and relatively high levels of corruption. 80 percent of 
civil servants 5only have a High School Diploma. Recruitment is not conducted on objective 
criteria and promotion is based principally on seniority and patronage. 
40. 
A comprehensive action plan to strengthen PFM was prepared based on the 
findings of the previous 2007 PEFA. The Public Procurement Code has been revised. A new 
law on corruption has been ratified and a study on public remuneration has been completed, 
paving the way for a more ambitious civil service reform effort. The 2012 PEFA auto-evaluation 
(with support from AFRITAC) conducted by the Ministry of Economy and Finance and the 2010 

4 National Long term strategic vision developed Benin authorities in June 2000. 
5There are approximately 66,000 civil servants in total, including close to 9,000 non-permanent and excluding 
military and paramilitary staffs

41. 
Improvements in Public Financial Management (PFM) are still needed to streamline 
budget execution procedures, enhance public procurement, and ensure regular internal 
and external auditing. The 2012 PEFA indicated that improvements are needed to raise the 
quality and timeliness of the Government’s annual financial statements; strengthen treasury 
management and the supervision of public firms and decentralized spending authorities; improve 
the effectiveness of external audit and the legislative scrutiny of budget laws and their execution. 
Delays in the approval of state accounts, bribery and collusion in public procurement have been 
recurrent issues. Improving PFM will be at the core of future PRSCs. 
42. 
The 2012 Transparency International Corruption Perception Index ranked Benin in 
94th position out of 183 countries -- from 100thin 2011. This comes after a series of high-
profile financial scandals in 2010. Benin was also ranked 11thout of 53 African countries in the 
2011 Mo Ibrahim Index of Governance, although with diverging trends. Whereas the sub-
indicators on “Sustainable Economic Opportunity” and “Human Development” improved in 
recent years, the scores on “Safety & Rule of Law” and “Participation and Human Rights” 
registered noticeable declines. 6 Overall, Benin scored higher than both the West Africa regional 
average and the continental average. Despite the relatively favorable rankings, corruption 
remains high in customs, tax departments, justice, the police, and at the port of Cotonou. 
43. 
Access to information on public affairs by civil society has improved, although 
CSOs continue to express frustration with the Government. Most government decisions and 
documents are still not published. Difficulties persist in obtaining timely information on budget 
execution; delays in national audits limit public scrutiny. On the other hand, CSOs’ limited 
capacity to use modern social accountability tools and insufficient coordination between 
themselves, limit their leverage. In addition, the media sector would have to be reformed to 
promote greater business ethics, independence and professionalism. 
The Business Environment and Public Private Partnerships 
44. 
Benin’s investment climate is weak. Recent studies of investment climate have ranked 
Benin amongst countries with the poorest business enabling environment. .

45. 
According to a recent Africa Infrastructure Country Diagnostic (AICD, 2011) 
study 7, the Cotonou-Niamey corridor is the most expensive gateway in West Africa and 
transaction costs in the Port of Cotonou account for the bulk of the costs of importing 
goods through this corridor. Private sector activity is also hampered by the poor state of the 
country’s energy, road and ICT sectors 8. Efforts by the Government to develop a PPP program 
have yet to be supported by a coherent strategic vision and an appropriate institutional set up.    
46. 
Private sector participation is hindered by the lack of an effective and coordinated 
dialogue mechanism between the public and private sectors. The High Commission for 
Collaborative Governance and the Millennium Challenge Account (MCA)have organized 
consultations with civil society, but efforts to encourage public-private sector dialogue have been 
less successful. The Presidential Investment Council (PIC) was set up as a Public-Private 
Dialogue (PPD) platform to coordinate the implementation of private sector related reforms, 
though with limited success so far.  
47. 
A series of reforms are planned for 2013 and 2014 including new PPP and 
Competition laws, a revised Labor Code and implementation of the Government’s recent plan for 
strengthening the investment and business climate. The Government wishes to encourage greater 
private sector involvement in the implementation of the SCRP-3, and counts on the development 
of public-private partnerships to finance an ambitious infrastructure development plan. A Round-
Table is planned in Paris in the first half of 2013 which will also try to mobilize the diaspora. 
The Bank will also provide advisory assistance to the Republic of Benin in the mining and oil 
sector. This assistance will cover: (i) production of share contracts; (ii) bidding of exploration 
blocks; and (iii) efficient use of mining and oil revenue, based on best practices worldwide, such 
as in Sao Tome and Principe and Norway. 
Youth Unemployment 
48. 
The job market is characterized by underemployment, particularly among youth. 
Formal unemployment is very low at 0.3 percent for all working age adults and 0.5 percent for 
youth. However, especially for youth, employment comes in low productivity jobs in the 
informal sector, where they may not work as many hours as desired, earn incomes that are below 
the minimum wage/poverty line, and perform work that does not match their education or 
training. The informal sector represents almost 95 percent of the working population with a 
predominance of women. The key challenge is raising productivity in family farms and non-farm 
household enterprises, while also growing the modern wage sector where productivity is 
currently the highest. In this regard, the quality of education is important for youth (and women) 
to effectively participate in higher productivity agricultural activities and household enterprises, 
as well as to engage in a modern skills- and knowledge-based wage sector. Similarly, lack of 
access to credit and land, constrain aspiring entrepreneurs from opening up a (informal) business.  
49. 
The National Employment Policy of 2011 puts a strong emphasis on improving 
youth employability and access to employment. Existing programs focused on youth include 
entrepreneurship initiatives combining business skills training with access to microcredit; 
internship programs to provide youth with professional experience; apprenticeship programs 
matching youth with experienced artisans; access to microcredit for existing small and medium

8Electricity tariffs are extremely high compared to the regional average. Business users have to pay US$160 per 
mbit per month for fixed broadband Internet access, while consumers in Senegal and Ghana pay only US$29 and 
US$64 respectively 

13 

 
 
                                                 
enterprises (SMEs); and technical and financial support for youth engaged in agriculture. While 
there are some promising models, the results of most initiatives have so far have been mixed. 
Underinvestment in Transport Infrastructure and the Port of Cotonou 
50. 
In the Transport sector, tariffs remain punitively high; domestic and regional 
regulatory reforms, coupled with public and private investment in roads and railways, are 
necessary. High transport prices reduce competitiveness, and indirectly, negatively impact 
growth and the job market. Poorly designed market regulation has resulted in the provision of 
low quality transport services, insufficiently capitalized trucking companies and obsolete 
trucking fleets. Existing regional and bilateral arrangements discourage the provision of efficient 
road transport services. Regulatory reforms including regional freight sharing agreements, 
national carrier restrictions, truck registration and technical inspections, drivers' training, 
insurance requirements, and enforcement of axle load controls need to be coordinated at the 
regional level to be effective.  
51. 
In the port, underperformance is largely due to governance problems and 
managerial deficiencies. Cooperation between the principal port actors is limited; ownership of 
the reforms initiated by the Government is lacking; corruption is often entrenched in business 
practices; and management responsibilities and accountabilities for port operations need to be 
clarified and strengthened. These weaknesses generate long dwell times in the port, high 
transaction costs, unmanageable truck congestion inside the port and in Cotonou, and serious 
revenue leakages with macroeconomic consequences. In 2011, the loss to GDP growth resulting 
from poor port performance was estimated at 0.6 percentage point. Important port reforms were 
implemented in 2012 and performance has improved. However the momentum must be 
maintained and the reform agenda completed to further enhance port performance.  
Electricity 
52. 
There is a gap between supply and demand in the electricity sector; rural coverage 
is limited and distribution infrastructure is outdated. Demand growth is estimated at about 
eight percent per year. CEB is the single buyer of electricity in Benin and Togo. CEB imports 
over 70 percent of its electricity from Nigeria and Ghana. The rest of the generation is provided 
by the hydroelectric dam of Nangbéto in Togo and some gas supplied by the West African Gas 
Pipeline (WAGP). CEB has been unable to meet domestic demand. Distribution over the 
national territory is carried out by SBEE which partially addresses the supply gap by reverting to 
thermal generation. SBEE's distribution infrastructure is outdated and cannot ensure quality 
services to its customers who are subject to high voltage drops and long blackouts. There is 
potential for clean energy production in Benin in the form of wind, tidal power and solar energy, 
but these potential sources will require considerable investment and appropriate legal and 
regulatory frameworks. 
53. 
The Government has concentrated its action on reducing the supply gap by financing 
an 80MW thermal generation plant running on jet fuel and gas. However, the gas contract is still 
not in place and gas supply in the sub region remains erratic. Jet fuel is extremely expensive. A 
large hydropower project located at Adjarala, on the border between Benin and Togo, is planned 
and will be supported by the WBG (FY15). 
Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) 
54. 
Access to telephony has increased exponentially since the introduction of mobile 
phones in 2000 but access to other ICT products remains very low. Growth in the internet 

14 

 
 
industry is constrained by costs, availability, and low penetration of fixed lines. The increase 
in density in the mobile segment masks a wide discrepancy between urban and rural areas, access 
being concentrated in cities, leaving a large percentage of the population without access to 
modern communications tools. Fixed line penetration has languished at around 0.26 percent 
penetration; and internet penetration is one of the lowest in the world at about 1.8 percent of the 
population.  Broadband Internet DSL remains a service used by industry, government, and a few 
privileged households (less than 0.25 percent in 2010). The cost of international bandwidth is 
high; an Internet Exchange Point (IXP) that would reduce the cost of local Internet traffic, is 
missing; theft of fiber access is frequent; and regulation to ensure competition and fair and 
equitable access to bandwidth is incomplete. 
55. 
The Government has liberalized the mobile segment and attempted to privatize the 
fixed grid. However, bids received were below expectation and the privatization of Benin 
telecom was cancelled. An interim regulatory body was set up to oversee private sector 
participation in the sector.  
Environment and climate change 
56. 
Benin’s natural environment is deteriorating steadily. Rapid population growth 
coupled with a mismatch between natural resource use and the rate of resource renewal are at the 
root of the problems. Growing urban and semi-urban centers are facing major environmental 
challenges related to inadequate infrastructure and basic services, which translates into poor 
sanitary conditions and poor quality of life. The 2010 Country Environmental Analysis (CEA) 
prepared by the Bank made a number of recommendations, among which the establishment of 
effective policies and institutions, and the mobilization of financing for environmental protection 
and natural resource management. Global climate change, especially the rise in temperatures and 
rainfall, and recurrent floods, will compound the challenges faced in agriculture (water 
management), forestry (deforestation), and health (spread of infectious diseases), while the 
coastal fringe will likely experience a rise in sea level. Priority actions envisioned in the SCRP-3 
to address the environmental challenges include: (i) the long-term promotion of good 
environmental practices; (ii) the promotion of healthy environmental practices by households; 
and (iii) the rational management of forests and natural resources.  
57. Management of climate change issues is coordinated by the National Committee on 
Climate Change. Benin prepared its National Action Plan for Adaptation to Climate Change 
(NAPA) in 2008. The NAPA has five priorities: (i) establishing a model for forecasting climate 
risk and an early warning system for food security in four vulnerable agro-ecological zones; (ii) 
the promotion renewable energy; (iii) the collection of surface water in municipalities and 
vulnerable departments in the center and the north; (iv) the protection of children under five and 
pregnant women against malaria in areas most vulnerable to climate change; and (v) the 
protection of coastal areas against a rise in sea level.  

II. Government Strategic Priorities 
58. 
The SCRP-3 (2011-2015) is consistent with the long term national visions contained 
in the National Study of Long Term Perspectives (ENPLT) and Benin Alafia 2025.It builds 
on the Strategic Development Orientations (OSD) of 2006. The SCRP-3 operationalizes the OSD 
through the Priority Action Plan (PAP) and the Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF). 
Broad consultations with stakeholders highlighted cross-cutting themes such as governance, 
gender, HIV/AIDS, demographics, environmental protection and human rights.   

15 

 
 
 
59. 
The pillars of the SCRP-3 do not fundamentally differ from those of the previous 
poverty reduction strategy. These pillars are: (i) acceleration of economic growth; (ii) 
development of infrastructure; (iii) strengthening of human capital; (iv) promotion of good 
governance; and (v) balanced and sustainable regional development. However, the SCRP-3’s 
pillars include new challenges such as youth and female employment; the opening up of new 
agricultural production zones and activities; the promotion of rural economic growth; the 
reduction of gender inequalities; and social protection needs. Furthermore, themes such as rural 
organization, agricultural diversification, demographic challenges and adaptation to climate 
change have been better defined.  
60. 
The overarching objective of Benin’s poverty reduction strategy is to accelerate 
growth. The base case in the SCRP-3 assumes 7.5 percent growth by 2015, from a starting 
point of 2.6 percent in 2010. This is two percentage points higher than the goal stated in SCRP-2 
which was not attained. While growth approaching 7.5 percent is undoubtedly necessary to 
achieve the MDGs, such a growth rate has no historical precedence in Benin. The alternative 
scenario in the SCRP-3 assumes a 5.2 percent average growth rate. While more realistic, it still 
exceeds the target growth rates of the Enhanced Credit Facility program with the IMF.  
61. 
The level of resources needed to implement the PAP is also ambitious and 
optimistic. The PAP is updated annually and is coherent with the Public Investment Program 
(PIP). It is the link between the SCRP, the sector-based program budgets developed by line 
ministries, the national budget and the MTEF, which is also updated annually on a three year 
rolling basis. The PAP, while providing the details necessary to render the SCRP actionable, is 
insufficiently prioritized to inform allocation decisions in the context of limited resources. 

III. The Country Partnership Strategy (FY13-17) 
A. Lessons Learned from Previous CAS and Stakeholder Feedback 
Conclusions drawn from the FY09-12 CAS: 
62. 
The CAS Completion Report (CASCR) concluded that the overall performance of 
the FY09-12 CAS was moderately satisfactory (see Annex 2).  While Benin achieved positive 
growth during the CAS period despite the global economic downturn and the 2010 floods, 
progress in poverty reduction was limited. Positive outcomes included: the maintenance of 
macroeconomic stability; progress in public financial management and decentralization; and 
improvements in the social sectors, particularly access to safe water for rural populations. 
However, CAS achievements fell short of what was envisaged with respect to private sector 
growth; structural reforms in agriculture and energy; and public sector governance reforms and 
institutional reinforcement. 
63. 
The CASCR pointed out the following lessons: 
• IDA should concentrate its assistance. Benin has many development needs. IDA should 
focus on areas where it can present an effective mix of interventions, and where it has 
comparative advantage and solid expertise.   
• Broad-based political support and an understanding of the political economy are critical 
for successful country strategy implementation. Over the past decade, political conflicts 
have slowed by the approval and implementation of structural reforms. Greater recognition 

16 

 
 
 
of the political standoffs which can develop as alliances shift over time should be taken into 
account in the CPS. 
• Policy reforms require technical support.  Investment/TA projects that complement PRSC 
actions are essential.  
• Coordination of donor programs increases efficiency of assistance.  The reform agenda in 
the PRSCs was supported by other donors and helped bring about reforms.   
• Make CPS periods longer, allow flexibility in programming and define adequate 
indicators: Three years is too short a period to show meaningful results; a longer CPS period 
of five years would permit a mid-term evaluation and potential adjustments. Performance 
indicators and targets should be measurable, available, realistic and attributable to Bank 
intervention. 
Findings from the Client Survey and Stakeholder Feedback 
64. 
Client Survey: According to the FY12 Country Survey, the public at large generally 
welcomed the actions of the World Bank Group in Benin. Governance, political rivalries and 
inadequate levels of citizen participation were perceived as the greatest obstacles to successful 
reform. The Bank was encouraged to reduce the complexity of its financing, be more adaptive to 
changing circumstances. The Bank was also invited to engage more with stakeholders and 
encourage greater citizen participation. Whereas in FY07, growth and governance were 
identified as the top development priorities, in FY 12 education, followed by agriculture and 
rural development were the main priorities. 
CPS Consultations with Country Stakeholders 
65. 
Consultations were held with CSOs, academic institutions, the private sector, 
Parliament, Government, faith-based organizations (FBOs) and donors. More than 250 
participants attended the meetings and suggested that the Bank pay particular attention to the 
following: 
• Donor coordination and selectivity in areas where the Bank has a comparative 
advantage: The Bank should focus on designing and implementing large scale projects in 
selected priority areas, in particular infrastructure and human development, instead of 
spreading its IDA envelop across all sectors. This was suggested by the Government, 
academic institutions and donors alike. It was also suggested that donor actions, including the 
Bank’s, would be more effective if they were more closely coordinated between donors. 
• Strengthening the knowledge base: Stakeholders recognized the Bank's comparative 
advantage to generate and disseminate knowledge. The Bank was encouraged to undertake 
more ESW to deepen the understanding of the country’s sources of growth and government 
reforms. 
• Capacity Building: Stakeholders encouraged the Bank to finance a training program for 
Parliamentarians, and to support the work program of the Council of Economic and Social 
Affairs (CESA). The objective should be to enhance the capacity of these institutions to 
monitor and assess government activities, in particular the provision of basic social services. 
Civil society and FBOs also requested that they be consulted at the design stage of Bank 
operations and during supervision.  
• Governance and the fight against corruption was a unanimous concern. The private 
sector encouraged the Bank to support Government efforts to improve governance, in 
particular in the judiciary and fiduciary systems, starting with public procurement and public 
financial management. The private sector also called for Bank involvement in the design of 

17 

 
 
the public-private dialogue and business climate reforms. Civil society and FBOs requested 
the Bank’s deeper engagement in the fight against corruption, as this was considered a major 
impediment to economic and social development.  
66. 
Six areas (infrastructure, human development, agriculture, decentralization, private 
sector development, and public sector reform) and two cross-cutting themes (governance and 
capacity building) were identified as priorities by participants during the consultative meetings. 
B. Proposed World Bank Group Country Partnership Strategy 
67. 
The CPS spans a period of five years. Its design is informed by the lessons of the 
previous CAS, the 2012 client survey and consultations with Government and stakeholders. 
It supports implementation of the SCRP-3 and the Government’s medium and long-term visions 
set out in “Benin Alafia 2025”, and the OSD. It is aligned with the World Bank Strategy for 
Africa. To ensure flexibility and full responsiveness to country needs, a Progress Report will be 
carried following 18-24 months of CPS implementation to address adjustments which may be 
required to better respond to strategic re-orientation or emerging needs. 
Guiding Principles 
• Reinforcement of governance in the focus areas, especially through capacity building to 
complement policy reforms supported by yearly Development Policy Operations. 
• Realism and selectivity are important given the country’s governance challenges and its 
capacity constraints. The Bank will define measurable outcomes and focus on its areas of 
comparative advantage in infrastructure (energy, telecom), Private sector Development 
(PSD), youth employment, and governance. It will also selectively engage in the health 
sector (focus on health and nutrition systems strengthening) and in basic education through 
the Global Partnership for Education program. Additional Financing or new phases of 
successful existing operations will be supported (Urban, agriculture and CDD operations). 
No new IDA operational project resources will be invested in agriculture, judicial reform, 
national transport, education, water, and HIV/Aids. However, the Bank Group may 
contribute to the policy dialogue in these sectors through ESW/AAA or advisory work. 
Investments and TA in these sectors through TF managed by the Bank are also an option. 
• Improvement of quality at entry by ensuring ownership and encouraging the integral 
participation of relevant government institutions in project preparation. Knowledge in the 
form of policy notes, diagnostic instruments and sector studies will support the design of 
Bank operations. Consultations with stakeholders will be organized with the help of the 
Bank’s communication professionals from the design phase of the operation onward. 
• The Bank will proactively manage its portfolio by encouraging project restructuring where 
necessary, and monitoring work programs and procurement procedures, particularly in 
infrastructure projects. Poor performers will be closed and the funds reallocated to better 
performing projects. 
• World Bank Group resources will leverage other donor financing and trust funds and 
be a catalyst for mobilizing financing by the State and private investors The Bank will 
use the extensive analytical work underway and in the pipeline to nurture policy dialogue in 
key sectors of the economy. The knowledge generated is expected to attract the participation 
of other partners. Hence, in higher education or civil service reform, the Bank will selectively 
accompany efforts of other donors through targeted technical assistance or ESW. The Bank 
will help leverage trust funds particularly in the governance, social, environmental protection 
and water sectors. 

18 

 
 
(iv). 
(v). 

• Regional Integration can be a catalyst for growth. Benin is strategically located next to 
Nigeria and is serving as a transit corridor for landlocked Niger, Burkina Faso, Mali and 
Chad. The Government plans to transform Benin from a transit country to a logistical and 
export services hub. The WBG has already committed to support the Government’s efforts 
through the Regional Trade Facilitation Project designed to foster trade flows and private 
sector investments. Consideration is also being given to a regional development policy 
operation to support the reform of regional road transport regulations, conventions and 
institutions that reduce regional competitiveness. 
Mainstreaming gender in the Bank portfolio 
68. 
A review of 20 IDA projects and 10 AAA/ESW over the 2004-2012 period showed 
that: 
(i). Only one project in apiculture had a thematic code of 25 percent attributed to gender; 
(ii). 
50 percent of projects included gender in their design; 
(iii). 
45 percent of projects designed activities distinctly, targeting men or women;45 
percent of projects used sex-disaggregated indicators in the result framework; 
35 percent of projects used participatory processes including gender in their design; 
50 percent of projects included activities promoting economic empowerment of 
women;  
(vi). DPOs lacked adequate focus on gender issues. 
69. 
The review found that AAA and ESW were more gender sensitive. Six out of the ten 
analytical works performed during the period included gender in their design; one of which was 
specifically gender-coded (the Gender & Energy Study). Governance and transport sector 
activities were less focused on gender. Taking stock of the upcoming Poverty and Gender 
Assessment, future Bank projects will have a sound framework for integrating gender issues. 
70. 
Financing Envelope: The total indicative IDA envelope for Benin over the FY13-FY17 
period is SDR 328.6 million, or approximately US$493.7 million. This includes the outstanding 
IDA16 envelope for FY13/14 of SDR 136.8 million (the amount of SDR 62.1 million for FY14 
is indicative) and an indicative projection of SDR 191.9 million for the three years of IDA-17 
(FY15-17) which assumes a similar level of resources as for IDA-16 9. Better portfolio 
performance and a more favorable CPIA score over the course of the CPS period absolutely and 
relative to other countries, would help increase the IDA allocation. In addition to the ongoing 
trust funds, the CPS will emphasize the mobilization of additional resources, be they either from 
trust or global funds – see Table 5 on proposed financing. 
71. Mix of policy-based and investment operations. PRSC series will be redesigned to go 
deeper into the reform programs of strategic sectors. PRSC series will be complemented by 
capacity building, TA and ESW to ensure effective implementation of reforms. There will be 
fewer, larger investment lending operations and in selective cases, multi-sector projects will be 
used as in the case of the Multi-sector Health and Nutrition project (FY14) where there is strong 

9Among others, the actual allocations for FY14 onwards will depend on: (i) the country’s own performance; (ii) its 
performance relative to that of other IDA recipients; (iii) the amount of overall resources available to IDA; (iv) 
changes in the list of active IDA-eligible countries; and (v) the terms of financial assistance provided (grants or 
loans).  Also, IDA allocations are determined in SDRs, the US dollar equivalent is based on an exchange rate of 
US$1.5/SDR (the rate applicable to each operation will be determined at the time of approval). Finally, the 
indicative figures for the FY15-17 will be revised based on the outcome of the IDA17 replenishment negotiations.

The CPS will build on the Government’s request for a strong knowledge-based 
relationship with the Bank and flexible, on-demand services. The CPS proposes an enhanced 
focus on analytical work, including through a capacity building operation providing flexible on-
demand AAA work. This will allow the CPS program to be better aligned with the Government’s 
priorities and increasingly flexible to address key policy and sector issues as they arise 
73. 
The CPS will build upon the existing portfolio. As of the end of January 2013, the 
portfolio consisted of 10 operations totaling US$286.62 million in net commitments, of which 
US$261.86 million remained undisbursed. There is an additional commitment of US$158.30 
million under six regional projects. The portfolio is supplemented by eleven recipient-executed 
Trust Funds totaling US$38.80 million in commitments (with US$24.43 million undisbursed).  

10 The West Africa Agricultural Productivity Program (WAAPP) is an APL with two phases. The ongoing first 
phase will end by June 2016.

74. 
Two projects are currently at risk in the portfolio. These are the Increased Access to 
Energy Project (three years old with only about US$1 million disbursed due to lack of advance 
procurement planning), and the GEF Community-Based Coastal Marine Biodiversity Project 
(management, procurement and counterpart funding problems). In addition, the Integrated 
Growth and Competitiveness Project is in the process of being restructured. 
75. 
The low disbursement ratio is due to: (i) long delays in effectiveness and procurement 
processes; (ii) counterpart funding problems; (iii) lack of ownership of implementing structures 
at project commencement; and (iv) the often belated constitution of project teams. Following the 
2011 CPPR, a joint WB-Government Steering Committee was set up to monitor portfolio 
performance and overcome systemic procurement issues, including through targeted training 
supported by the Bank. In addition, the E-signature disbursement procedures are being extended 
to the entire active portfolio. Consequently, all projects have now a realistic monthly 
disbursement plan; and (ii) Government implemented an effective portfolio overall performance 
and disbursement ratio monitoring mechanism.  
76. Most ISRs are rated satisfactory with a moderate FM risk rating. Interim financial 
reports (IFR) are submitted to the Bank on time and of acceptable quality. Over the last three 
years, Benin achieved 100 percent fiduciary compliance of audited reports submitted within the 
fiscal year. Most of the opinions of the last audit reports were unqualified. Some challenges 
remain with state owned enterprises some of which continue to submit their audited financial 
statements after the Bank deadline and qualified opinions. FM capacity building sessions are 
planned to address cross-cutting issues and speed up disbursement rates during the CPS period. 

IFC &MIGA 
IFC’s current investment portfolio consists of two investments in the financial sector 
77. 
totalingUS$8.4 million, as set out in Annex 6. Additional leads in the financial and agribusiness 
sectors are currently under consideration. In addition, IFC is providing advisory services to the 
Government on the reform of the business environment in partnership with the FPD department 
of the Bank; capacity building to financial intermediaries to improve access to finance for Micro, 
Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs); and capacity building to financial institutions.  
78. 
IFC is also working jointly with the Bank to advise the Government on the legal, 
institutional and regulatory framework for public-private partnerships (PPPs) and is advising the 
Government on the set up of PPPs in the rural water sector in partnership with the Bank’s Water 
and Sanitation Program (WSP). It is also currently assisting the Government as lead advisor in 
structuring and implementing a PPP in the health sector.  

21 

 
 
79. Going forward, IFC will continue to provide advisory services and TA, and look for 
investment opportunities. It will co-lead the advisory work on business climate reform, 
focusing on the harmonization of the domestic legal framework with OHADA uniform Acts. It 
will look for synergies and complementarily with WBG entities, and seek investment 
opportunities in sectors where the Bank is engaged in policy dialogue and where reforms are 
being implemented to improve the legal and regulatory framework necessary for private sector 
interventions.  
80. MIGA’s current exposure in Benin consists of three projects in the tourism, services 
and infrastructure sectors, for a total of US$8.7m in both gross and net terms. MIGA is open 
for business in Benin across all of its political risk insurance product lines, including Transfer 
Restriction, Expropriation, Breach of Contract and War and Civil Disturbance, as well as, under 
certain conditions, the Non-Honoring of Sovereign Obligations. MIGA's Small Investment 
Product (SIP) may also be appropriate for Benin. Greater engagement in Benin fits closely with 
MIGA’s strategic goals of supporting IDA countries, and MIGA’s strategic commitment to lever 
its product for complex projects also fits closely with Benin’s needs especially in infrastructure. 
Mindful of the high priority attached to attracting foreign investment, MIGA will continue to 
seek opportunities in Benin, supporting private investors and the government to catalyze the 
investment which is needed to take development to the next stage.  Moreover, MIGA will also 
look for opportunities to support private investors in the PPP projects, and use its product to 
complement existing or planned engagement by the Group. 

WBI 
81. 
The Knowledge agenda. WBI’s main focus in Benin has been the promotion of South-
South cooperation. WBI organized two workshops in 2012 in collaboration with NEPAD, UNDP 
and the Association of African Development Learning Centers (AADLC). The workshop was 
attended by Regional Economic Communities (RECs) representatives and focused on regional 
integration. The second workshop was organized for development and academic partners and 
dealt with capacity development and implementation challenges.  The WBI and the Bank’s 
country office in Benin will continue to take advantage of the presence of a Global Distance 
Learning Center in Cotonou to foster the exchange of experience and tested implementation 
approaches from peer countries in the South. 
82. Other initiatives related to the Knowledge agenda include a program to generate 
and disseminate agriculture technology on a sub-regional basis, and the Africa Centers of 
Excellence Regional (ACER) Project. Benin has traditionally excelled in mathematics and 
science within the sub-continent. It is therefore well positioned to participate in these programs. 
The ACER Project is motivated by the rise in demand for specialized human capital within 
rapidly growing development sectors such as extractive industries, energy, water, environment, 
infrastructure, and in service sectors such as hospitality, banking, tourism and ICT. A regional 
approach to higher education offers a cost effective mechanism to build responsiveness and 
excellence in higher education in Africa in priority areas such as Science Technology, 
Engineering and Mathematics (STEM), Agriculture and Health Sciences.  
C. Partnerships and Donor Coordination 
83. 
The CPS, emphasizing strong partnerships, will be selective and focused. Under the 
last CAS, the Bank was present in many sectors. To maximize the impact of its financial and 
technical support, the Bank intends, under the new CPS, to focus its assistance on the 

22 

 
 
following strategic sectors: infrastructure (energy, transport excluding roads and railways, ICT, 
and urban development); PSD; and governance. Bank assistance will be coordinated with other 
donors (See Annex10). The Bank will use its AAA work to underpin the reform agenda and 
leverage additional resources from other donors. AAA/ESW activities will focus on cotton sector 
reform, port reform, PFM and public procurement, customs and tax administration. Trust funds 
will also be sought to complement the IDA envelope. GPOBA grants have been requested to 
provide subsidies in the health and water sectors. A donor conference to pledge funds for the 
Government’s growth strategy will be organized by the Bank in Paris in 2013. It will include a 
special session on private investment in high potential value chains and government priority PPP 
projects. 
84. 
The Government and development partners are committed to harmonization and 
alignment. The Ministry of Development chairs the joint Government-Donors Steering 
Committee monitoring SCRP implementation. Regular meetings are held among donors to 
monitor key emerging issues pertaining to aid. A joint annual review is conducted each June to 
assess progress in the implementation of the Government’s poverty reduction strategy. Partners 
designate a chair for each of the thirteen sectoral thematic groups. Benin’s traditional 
development partners are the EU, the AfDB, the BOAD, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, 
the Netherlands, Switzerland, the US (USAID and MCC), the United Nations agencies and IDA. 
Furthermore, China, Brazil, India and South Africa are increasingly contributing to the country’s 
development agenda and about to participate in donors’ coordination efforts. 
85. 
The Bank cooperates closely with the IMF and development partners on policy 
dialogue and structural reforms. The IMF leads the dialogue on budgetary, real sector and 
financial sector discussions, in collaboration with the Bank. Technical support on customs and 
tax administration is closely coordinated. The WBG leads the policy dialogue on structural 
reforms regarding the private sector, energy, port, and cotton sectors. The Bank also works 
closely with partners providing budget support and complements them in areas of public sector 
governance and private sector development, especially regarding the business environment. 
Objectives and Expected Results of the CPS 
86. 
The CPS is designed to address the country's key development challenges: (a) a weak 
governance system; (b) insufficient growth to reduce poverty meaningfully; and (c) low access to 
basic social services. To address these challenges, the CPS is structured around three 
pillars. The first is cross-cutting, and forms the foundation pillar of the strategy, namely 
"Governance and public sector capacity". The other two pillars focus upon "Sustainable growth, 
competitiveness and employment", and "Access to basic social services and social inclusion". All 
pillars are mutually reinforcing.  
87. Measurable outcomes have been identified for each pillar. In total, 13 outcomes will 
be monitored over time. A mixture of on-going operations, new lending, AAA and Trust 
Funds will be deployed to address each outcome, as per Table 7 below and Annex 2.

Bank operations will be designed with particular attention to quality at entry and gender 
will be a cross-cutting issue. Public sector reforms are expected to improve transparency, 
accountability and the overall efficiency of expenditures. These reforms will in turn contribute to 
better access to basic social services, improved social inclusion, and greater trust between the 
Government and the citizenry. Investments in infrastructure and investment climate reforms are 
expected 
to 
foster more vigorous and sustainable growth; 
improve private sector 
competitiveness, and generate jobs, particularly for youth and women.  
A. Governance and Public Sector Capacity: the Foundation 
Core Governance 
89. 
The main objective of the Bank’s governance program is to help Benin better 
manage its financial resources, so that fiscal policy can enable and foster inclusive growth. 
Weaknesses in budgeting and planning, FM and procurement processes, and oversight 
mechanisms, need to be addressed to strengthen the delivery of essential social services, increase 
value and efficiency in government expenditures, and meet the challenging targets and ambitions 
stated in Benin’s Poverty Reduction Strategy. Increasing low budget execution rates in key 
ministries, particularly execution rates on priority social expenditures, is a key measure in this 
regard. This includes supporting efforts both on the revenue side to generate the resources 
necessary to effectively fund and scale-up government programs, and on the expenditure 
management side to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of government expenditure.  
Efforts to improve transparency and reduce corruption must be also pursued with stronger 
commitment in order to reduce misallocation and to ensure scarce resources are effectively 
employed in the pursuit of desired outcomes. 
90. 
Programmatic Poverty Reduction Support Credits (PRSCs) have been the main 
instrument to support economic governance and strengthen public sector capacity.  Benin 
has had seven PRSCs to date. PRSC-8 (FY13) will support public financial management, 
procurement and governance reforms; and enhanced competitiveness. A particular focus will be 
on implementation of anti-corruption legislation. In addition, PRSC-8 and the next DPO series 
(PRSCs 9-11) will ensure that prior actions and triggers support a deeper and more fundamental 
reform effort in the areas of focus than in the previous series. As a complement to a redesigned 
series of DPO, a multi-sector Capacity Building operation (FY15) will assist the authorities in 
strengthening reform implementation (see below).The PRSC operations and the planned capacity 
building operation are integral to creating the increased fiscal space necessary to support more 
effective delivery of social services, including in priority social sectors such as health and 
education. 
91. 
A number of discreet TA activities and studies are planned or underway to support 
the Government’s public sector reform effort. A policy note on strengthening public 
investment (FY13)will help the Government frame and prioritize its public investment choices, 
together with a policy note on broadening the tax base. These follow a policy note on port 
operations delivered in Q2 FY13. Through an IDF grant, the Bank is supporting the Ministry of 
Planning and the Prime Minister’s Office with a capacity building program to strengthen human 
resources and coordination of government action. This is underpinned by the Central Finance 
Agencies (CFA) project funded by the WB/Netherlands Partnership Program, which undertook a 
detailed diagnosis of the institutions responsible for budget planning and execution; and a 
political economy/change management study (2011) focused on the implementation of the PFM 
reforms contained in the June 2009 WAEMU PFM directives, co-financed by a Governance 

27 

 
 
Partnership Facility grant. An IDF grant (FY11) also finances anti-money laundering and 
terrorism financing efforts in Benin. 
92. 
Support will be sought in FY13 from the Statistical Capacity Building Trust Fund to 
assist the National Institute of Statistics & Economic Analysis (INSAE).The assistance will 
initially focus on updating the national statistical development plan and may be followed by 
discreet capacity building activities.  
Strengthening Sector Governance through Capacity Building and Technical Assistance (TA), 
and Improved Demand Side Governance 
93. 
A capacity building program will contribute to swifter and more effective reform 
implementation. The CASCR suggested that poverty reduction objectives, particularly in areas 
supported by PRSCs, would benefit from technical assistance to support timely, effective and 
sustainable reform implementation. An FY15 Capacity Building Operation will provide TA 
focused on the implementation of policies supported by the Bank program as well as on-demand 
high-priority requests. The design will introduce a proportion of results-based disbursement to 
strengthen incentives for swift implementation. The operation will support the implementation of 
the new WAEMU PFM and procurement directives.  
94. 
Two recent studies have provided an understanding of the strengths and weaknesses 
of the central PFM system, and the challenges associated with the implementation of the 
reforms contained in the WAEMU directives 11. A more in-depth understanding of how this 
affects service delivery will be obtained by including Benin in a regional ESW to identify PFM 
and procurement bottlenecks to the execution of the capital budget in key sectors such as 
infrastructure, health and education(FY13), in response to a request for support by the WAEMU 
Commission. The lessons learned from this study will feed into the financial management and 
procurement capacity-building technical assistance operation (FY15). In addition, the Bank’s 
assessment of the fiduciary impact of FM and procurement weaknesses will be updated through a 
Country Integrated Fiduciary Assessment which will include FM, procurement, and governance 
aspects (FY15). Finally, in support of sector based PFM work, additional political economy work 
may be needed.   
95. 
The CPS will support the development of the accounting and procurement 
professions. Following the completion of the A&A ROSC, the Benin Professional Accountancy 
Board was invited to become an associate member of IFAC. A successor IDF grant (FY14) will 
take the Benin Accountancy Board from associate to full membership. A second IDF will 
provide capacity building to procurement specialists within the civil service.  
96. 
The Regional Centers for Evaluation and Results (CLEAR) Initiative will support 
the development and strengthening of Benin’s M&E system. In 2000, the Government began 
setting up M&E units in all ministries thanks to the Public Reform Adjustment Credit provided 
by the Bank; and in 2007 the Government created the Bureau for the Evaluation of Public 
Policies (BEPP) at the level of the Prime Minister’s office which is responsible for coordinating 
evaluations of government flagship programs. The “Centre Africain d’Etudes Supérieures en 
Gestion” (CESAG) located in Dakar, will provide technical assistance and advisory services in 
M&E related matters to the Government and civil society.

Demand Side Governance 
97. 
The Capacity Building operation will address the demand side of PFM and will 
support the engagement of a range of stakeholders in the roll-out of PFM reforms to foster 
greater transparency, accountability and strengthen trust between the Government and the 
citizenry.  
98. 
Efforts will be made to strengthen the Bank’s relationship with civil society.  The 
June 2012 World Bank Global Partnership for Social Accountability (GPESA) provides the 
framework for deepening and sustaining engagement with CSOs and promote governance 
reforms, improve service delivery, and build support for and ownership of World Bank 
operations.  The country team will work with the GPESA Trust Fund Administration to explore 
funding mechanisms to support specific civil society activities aimed at strengthening social 
accountability in the country and foster citizen oversight. This will complement ongoing 
arrangements under the Francophone West Africa Contract Watch Coalition - led by the GAC-
in-Operations team, and for which Benin is a pilot country. The country team will also work 
towards promoting public debate around development programs. The Decentralized Service 
Delivery project will support a roll-out of community scorecards to measure citizens' perception 
of service delivery by local governments and to facilitate a dialogue on ways to improve these 
services. 
99. 
In partnership with other donors, the Bank will undertake a study to better 
understand the causes of the deficit of social capital in Benin and derive some 
recommendations for the reform agenda. The WBG will build on results already available on 
social capital in Benin to launch the study (FY13) which will focus on two areas: (a) the lack of 
trust between politicians and citizens, and in the state and its institutions; and (b) the lack of trust 
between economic agents, with a particular attention to measuring and documenting the impact 
of this lack of trust on economic growth. 
100. Cross-cutting issues pertaining to the economic situation in Benin, and service 
delivery and growth issues will be analyzed in a CEM to be finalized in FY17.  This document 
is seen as an input to the macro dialogue with the Government and will be an important input to 
the next CPS. 
B. Pillar I: Increasing Sustainable Growth, Competitiveness and Employment 
101. The Bank Group will play a leading role in: business climate reforms; infrastructure 
modernization (energy, transport, ICT); agriculture diversification (through identification of new 
markets and value chains); the promotion of regional integration and trade; and the sustainable 
use of natural resources. 
Increase access to and quality of infrastructure services 
102. Energy:  Bank support will focus on boosting electricity generation through the 
construction of the Adjarala power plant that straddles the Benin-Togo border. An important 
offshoot of the construction of the dam will be the development of irrigation for agriculture. The 
Bank will also participate in the rehabilitation and expansion of the distribution network. 
Building on recent successes in biomass energy, similar projects will be rolled out to reduce the 
country’s carbon footprint and reduce pressure on forests. Current Bank engagement in the sector 
includes two ongoing projects, Energy Services Delivery and Increased Access to Modern 
Energy Services. The Bank is also engaged in policy dialogue in the petroleum sector as 
exploration activities are expected to begin in Benin’s territorial waters in FY13. The situation in 

29 

 
 
the energy sector will be assessed in an energy sector review (FY15) for which cofinancing may 
be requested from PPIAF. MIGA is also willing to consider supporting sustainable renewables 
and IPP projects sponsored by private investors and part of WAPP initiatives for the region. 
103. Transport: Important reforms are being implemented at the port including the "single 
window", under the support of the IDA-financed regional ALTTFP project and the MCA. In 
FY12 MIGA issued a US$7.1 million guarantee to Bureau Veritas of the Netherlands covering 
its equity investment in “Société d’Exploitation du Guichet Unique du Bénin” which manages 
the port’s single window under a 10-year concession contract. In response to the difficulties with 
the import verification program and the deterioration in port performance, a series of diagnostic 
and policy notes have been undertaken or are underway to address customs and port reforms. 
The EU has completed a forensic audit of customs processes. In FY13, the Bank completed a 
note on port operations and will complete a Customs Assessment to measure Customs 
performance against regional and international benchmarks. Given its impact on growth and 
private sector competitiveness, the Bank will deepen the dialogue with the Government aimed at 
strengthening port governance and performance. An updated DTIS with funding from the EIF is 
also ongoing. Additional targeted analytical work to show opportunity costs from inefficient 
practices (e.g. with regard to transit or customs) may be undertaken as a way of building 
commitment to the reform agenda. A potential regional transport DPO dealing with WAEMU 
regulations governing the trucking industry is under discussion.  
104. Telecommunications: The Government’s vision in the ICT sector is to transform 
Benin into the “digital capital of Africa,” taking advantage of the country’s location and its 
access to international connectivity. Important reforms have been engaged in the sector through 
the e-Benin project, and complemented by an investment in international connectivity through 
the WARCIP project. This investment will provide additional bandwidth and international 
connectivity by connecting Benin to the Africa Coast to Europe (ACE) cable. This operation will 
likely have a strong regional impact since Benin offers the shortest route to the coast for Burkina 
Faso and Niger. Benin is therefore in a strategic position to supply international capacity to both 
countries, as well as terrestrial transit facilities from Nigeria to the rest of West Africa. By the 
end of 2013, Benin should be connected to the ACE cable. This connection will end SAT-3’s 
current monopoly on international bandwidth, and should trigger significant price reductions, 
like in East Africa with the introduction of multiple fiber cables.   
105. By the end of 2013, Benin will have put in place the building blocks for e-
government applications through the e-Benin project. It is expected that the development and 
promotion of relevant content and applications in strategic sectors including, health, education 
and agriculture and m-payment systems/framework to ease business transactions will further 
support the country’s agenda to develop a knowledge based economy and decentralize access to 
basic services. 
106. Cross-cutting issues pertaining to infrastructure competitiveness in Benin will be 
analyzed in a sector review to be finalized in FY17.  This document is seen as an input to the 
sector dialogue with the Government and will be an important input to the next CPS.

Box 4 : Opportunities - Regional Integration and Trade 

Benin’s geographic location provides special opportunities and challenges for regional integration 
with countries of the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) and the Economic 
Community of West African States (ECOWAS). The country is a natural transportation hub and is 
well-placed to benefit from renewed growth in Nigeria and Sahelian countries. However, the country 
must compete with neighboring Cote d’Ivoire, Ghana, and Togo to be a key port of entry for trade.  
To take advantage of its comparative advantages, Benin has tapped into the various opportunities 
provided by the Bank’s Regional Integration Assistance Strategy (RIAS).  

Infrastructure  
Benin is an implementing partner of the Abidjan-Lagos Trade and Transport Facilitation 
project(ALTTFP) geared to facilitate trade and improve the coastal corridor’s road infrastructure. 
The project involves: customs modernization and harmonization of procedures; the establishment of 
joint border posts (in cooperation with the EU); technical support to improve the efficiency of the 
port; rehabilitation/construction of critical road infrastructure segments; and HIV/AIDS treatment 
and prevention along the corridor. Under the West and Central Africa Air Transport Safety and 
Security project, Benin is strengthening its Civil Aviation Authorities’ safety and security oversight 
capacities. The country’s efforts to improve energy services are bolstered by participation in the 
implementation of the West African Gas Pipeline project (WAGP), and the West African Power 
Pool Program (WAPP) which will pool energy resources within the region and make them available 
to member countries. To promote further growth in telecommunications, the country Benin is 
participating in the Regional WA Communication Infrastructure Program (WARCIP) that will 
connect Benin to a submarine cable providing more than 16,000 kilometers of international 
connectivity between Africa and Europe 

Institutional cooperation 
Benin benefits directly and indirectly from World Bank projects aimed at mobilizing financing for 
infrastructure investments, and promoting trade and investments. The country participates in the 
WAEMU Capital Markets Development project which is geared to strengthen capital markets in 
West Africa and mobilize public and private financing for infrastructure development. The Regional 
Trade and Facilitation project provided equity financing to Benin so that it could join the Africa 
Trade Insurance Agency. In addition, the Bank is preparing a One Stop Border Posts project which 
aims to strengthen the business environment in West Africa through the establishment of functional 
border crossings by supporting the implementation of modern harmonized procedures and 
documentation to ease border-crossing movements for persons, vehicles, goods and services. 
Regional Public Goods  
In the area of trans-boundary water resource management, efforts are made through the Niger Basin 
Water Resources project to develop the institutional capacity and enabling framework for regional 
collaboration in the Senegal and Niger basins. As a result of these programs, approximately 4,400 ha 
of previous arid land have already been developed for irrigated agriculture and the production of 
fresh water fish has increased by 12 percent in the Senegal River Basin.

Improved Agriculture Productivity and Diversification and sustainable management of 
natural resources 
107. The on-going Agricultural Productivity and Diversification Project (PADA) and the 
West Africa Agricultural Productivity Program (WAAPP) support improvements in 
productivity and value transformation of selected commodities. The next PRSC series will 
support the reform of the agricultural sector and the implementation of the PSRSA. The Bank 
will continue to provide just in time cotton sector TA in FY13.In addition to the two on-going 
operations, linkages with other sector swill be established. For this purpose, the Bank will 
collaborate with the Government to identify new promising value chains in the agro-industry 
area, and the binding constraints to growth in these sectors. It will also focus on (i) strengthening 
the cooperation between PADA, CIGOP and IFC to channel more private investments into 
cashew and pineapple value chains, and other new products; and (ii) the design of an 
agricultural-based youth employment component into the Youth Employment project planned in 
FY14. Furthermore, primary sector activities typically engage more males than females in rural 
areas and analysis is being undertaken by the Bank on the changing role of women in non-
traditional and cash-crop agriculture. Findings will be integrated into on-going agricultural 
operations.  
108. The Bank will continue to be involved in environmental management reforms. There 
are currently three ongoing GEF projects in the pipeline, one of which was approved in FY11 
(Support to Protected Areas Management), and two which have been ongoing for several years, 
(Community Based Coastal and Marine Biodiversity Project and Forests, and Adjacent Land 
Management). An Additional IDA Financing of the Forests and Adjacent Land Management 
Project is under preparation (US$2 million, FY13). It benefits from a US$6 million GEF Grant 
from the Sahel and West Africa Program which supports of the Great Green Wall Initiative. The 
additional financing will contribute to the capitalization of, a conservation trust fund, the 
“Fondation des Savanes Ouest-Africaines (FSOA)” set up by the Government. 
Develop High Potential Value Chains and Improve Business Climate/Public Private 
Partnerships 
109. Fostering transformative investment through Special Economic Zones: The Bank 
will undertake ESW in FY13/14 on Cross-border competitiveness platforms along the Benin-
Nigeria border, in the form of special economic zones capable of attracting a critical mass of 
private investment in targeted value chains in agri-business, construction and the ICT sector. The 
ESW could be followed by an investment operation in FY15 on a Cross-border SEZ on the 
Nigeria-Benin border (US$50-70 million).The ongoing IDA/IFC CIGOP Project (US$25 
million, 2008) is in the process of being restructured to support Benin’s economic transformation 
and job creation agenda, and to respond better to emerging priorities. Through the restructuring 
of the CIGOP and the SEZ operation, opportunities will also be sought to integrate private sector 
development approaches to support SME development, innovation, job creation and the 
commercial trading relationship between Benin and Nigeria. 
110. Strengthening the enabling environment for private sector development, including 
PPPs: The restructured CIGOP will continue to support the legal, institutional and regulatory 
reforms that will enhance the business environment. Particular attention will also be dedicated to 
sustaining the WBG dialogue on public private partnerships, including the institutional and 
legal/regulatory framework, and the identification of a pipeline of priority projects. 

32 

 
 
111. 
IFC will continue to support the improvement of Benin’s investment climate and the 
implementation of the OHADA new entrepreneur status.  Reforms aimed at improving the 
investment climate have been undertaken in the following four areas: starting a business, dealing 
with construction permits, trading across borders and enforcing contracts. To maintain this 
momentum, a two-year TA program funded by SECO will support: (i) additional investment 
climate reforms; and (ii) the implementation of the OHADA “new entrepreneur status” which 
has been designed with a light legal regime to facilitate the entrance of small entrepreneurs into 
the formal economy. The joint WB/IFC Investment Climate department (CIC) will test the 
effectiveness of the set of incentives offered to these new entrepreneurs through an impact 
evaluation. The Group will work in cooperation with UNCTAD, to provide support to the 
Government in identifying the most effective package of incentives to encourage firm’s 
formalization and performance.  
112. Benin’s trade is handicapped with long delays at border posts, which have been 
estimated at around 15 days and 20 days for export and import, respectively.  This ranking 
spurred the Government’s request for technical assistance from the WBG to identify key issues 
and constraints in the trade logistics sector.  IFC will assist the Government in this regard and 
support the implementation of agreed solutions to improve trade logistics chains, focusing on the 
application of valuation principles and risk-based approaches for goods clearance. 
113. 
In addition, IFC will continue to: (i) partner with financial intermediaries to 
improve access to finance for MSMEs; and (ii) provide capacity-building to financial 
institutions to strengthen the financial sector and promote business growth. IFC will offer: (i) 
trade finance facilities to banks supporting the trading activities of their MSMEs clients; (ii) risk 
sharing facilities to banks supporting the growth of their SME portfolios; (iii) long-term local 
currency facilities to banks and NBFIs (especially microfinance and leasing institutions) aimed at 
shoring up their deposit or capital base and enabling them to provide their clients with medium to 
long term financing with improved protection against losses; and (iv) equity investments or long 
term credit facilities to microfinance institutions to allow them to provide long term facilities to 
micro entrepreneurs while strengthening their capital base. Specific advisory services such as 
SME management training (Business Edge) are being discussed with commercial banks as part 
of their non-financial services for SMEs. Funding from the multi-donor trust fund FIRST will 
also be requested to update the FSAP (FY14) and convert the recommendations into a 
comprehensive Financial Sector Development Strategy and detailed action plan. 
114. 
IFC will also follow up on selective PPP opportunities in the health and water sectors, 
in particular a PPP project to develop a green-field hospital in the Abomey-Calavi area, to be 
designed, financed, built, and operated by a private operator; and a rural water PPP program, in 
conjunction with WSP, to tender a series of small-scale concessions in various locations across 
the country, as discussed in pillar 2. Regarding the hospital project, the Global Partnership for 
Output Based Aid (GPOBA) has agreed to provide a grant of US$ million to support the training 
of health professionals and their provision of primary care services at the clinics and hospital. 
This project is expected to enter the formal procurement process in the second half of 2013. 
Regarding the PPP water program, an additional GPOBA grant of US$3m has been requested for 
providing Output-Based Aid (OBA) subsidies to private operators to improve the service 
provision in small towns. 
115. World Bank Group support (including through WBI, the CIGOP project and IFC) 
will be extended to the Presidential Investors Council to strengthen the public-private 

33 

 
 
dialogue (PPD) platform. The PIC was established to identify constraints to growth and to 
formulate policy recommendations to encourage domestic and foreign investments. So far, the 
PIC has been mainly active in addressing shortcomings in the investment climate. However, in 
April 2012the Government requested assistance from the WBI to transform the PIC into an open, 
effective public-private dialogue instrument. Technical assistance from WBI will take place in 
FY13 to implement this vision and accompany the PIC staff with capacity building activities. 
CIGOP funding is available to support this exercise.  
116. Cross-cutting issues pertaining stimulating the enabling environment for formal 
sector and SME development will be analyzed in a sector report to be finalized in FY17.  This 
document is seen as an input to the dialogue with the Government on accelerating shared-growth 
and will be an important input to the next CPS. 
117. Youth Unemployment: In response to Government request, and building on an analysis 
of current and past youth employment programs (FY13 AAA), household level statistics, and 
international experience, the planned Youth Employment Project (FY14) will aim to improve 
access of youth to employment and self-employment, and improve their skills so that they 
become employable. Gender considerations and the different needs of young women and young 
men will be integral to project design and implementation. 
C. Pillar 2: Improving Service Delivery and Social Inclusion 
118. WBG support provided under this pillar will focus on two principal outcomes: (i); 
increased access to basic social and local services, including flood protection and social safety 
nets; and (ii) improved quality of and access to basic education, health and nutrition services. 
Gender inclusion is a cross-cutting objective. 
119. 
Improved Access to Basic Services and Social Safety Nets. In May 2012 a new CDD 
operation was approved by the Bank to support the Government’s decentralization reform 
program. The Community Driven Decentralized Services Project (the first of a three-phased 
APL) will improve access to decentralized basic services, and help mainstream the CDD 
approach in all the ministries involved in the delivery of basic services. It contains a pilot social 
safety net component, involving labor intensive public works and cash transfers, in line with the 
recommendations of the Government’s 2011 Social Safety Net Review.  
120. Urban Development: The Benin Cities Support Program (FY13) will build on the 
Second Decentralized City Management Project that closed in June 2012 and established a solid 
basis for improved municipal management and service delivery. This new project will scale up 
access to infrastructure and basic services in urban municipalities to improve their effectiveness 
as economic growth poles and further support the Government’s decentralization efforts.  
121. The on-going Benin Emergency Urban Environment Project (BEUEP) (FY11) was 
prepared in response to the 2010 floods that affected more than 680,000 people. It focuses 
on sanitation, waste water, drainage, municipal solid wastes, and floods and disaster risk 
management. An Additional Financing (FY 14) for the ongoing project will be considered to 
address drainage networks, and communities under constant threat of flooding not covered by the 
parent project. The additional financing could also cover the preparation of a sanitation master 
plan for the Abomey-Calavi area and the construction of two mini waste water treatment plants 
in Porto-Novo and Abomey-Calavi. It would also pave the way for private sector participation 
through PPP arrangements in the water and sanitation sector, with the involvement of IFC and 
possibly MIGA. It will also include hygiene promotion as the existing project only cover onsite 

34 

 
 
sanitation systems comprising mainly of latrines and septic tanks; and the acquisition of 
equipment and tool kits for sanitary control at the laboratory of public hygiene at the Ministry of 
Health. 
122. Quality of Urban Environment: The two proposed TAs on hazardous waste 
management and air quality management, in conjunction with the Urban Development Project 
and the BEUEP, will help identifying specific interventions to reduce the negative environmental 
impacts associated with poor environmental governance and improve the quality of the urban 
environment. 
123. Water and Sanitation Program is using a range of instruments to deepen private 
sector engagement in water and sanitation: In FY12, WSP and IFC were engaged by the 
Government to advise the Ministry of Water on a PPP project in the small towns' water sector. 
Private participation will be complemented by OBA incentives to ensure that poor households 
truly benefit from the project. Technical assistance is being provided to develop the regulatory 
and institutional framework for the sector. 
Improved Education, Health and Nutrition Services 
124. Service Delivery: Benin has made significant progress in the coverage of key social 
services. For instance, the percentage of pregnant women benefiting from assisted delivery is 
now close to 81 percent. Similarly, for education, the enrollment rate for primary education has 
increased to 120 percent. However, it is unlikely that these “quantitative” improvements have 
come with comparable progress in quality of services. Indeed, to take only the example of 
maternal health, there is a “Benin paradox”;while the rate of assisted deliveries is one of the best 
in Sub-Saharan Africa, maternal mortality remains very high. This suggests an unfinished quality 
agenda and sub-optimal use of public spending. Quality in education and health are strongly 
driven by what providers know and what providers do, and Service Delivery Indicators (SDI) 
surveys will yield information to policy-makers and communities alike, to track performance and 
improve accountability for the efficient use of public resources. Such a survey could be carried 
out in Benin in FY15. 
125. Education: One of the key challenges facing Benin is to provide quality and relevant 
education, and reduce the disconnection between what is taught in the education and professional 
training systems, and the skills needed in the economy. The Education for All Fast-Track 
Initiative (now called Global Partnership for Education, or GPE) project which closed in June 
2012 contributed to the fulfillment of the universal access and equity objectives in preschool and 
primary education.  
126. The Bank has been requested to manage a new FY13 US$45 million GPE program 
in Benin. The new grant will focus on improving equitable access and quality of classroom 
instruction in basic education, particularly in deprived districts. This will be achieved by 
improving the quality of teaching, the quantity of teaching resources and the quality of the school 
learning environment. Higher completion rates will reflect qualitative improvements in 
educational outcomes. 
127. The gaps in service delivery in primary education must be identified to improve the 
quality of education. To this end, a Service Delivery Indicators (SDI) survey is planned for 
FY14. The survey will enable policy makers and service providers to focus of filling the gaps 
and track progress over time, and will contribute to raising the awareness of donors and other 
stakeholders of the need for action to improve learning outcomes. 

35 

 
 
128. Benin is well positioned thanks to its tradition of academic excellence in science and 
mathematics to participate in the Africa Centers of Excellence(ACE) regional project 
discussed under the Foundation Pillar. The project will concentrate on building capacity in 
competitively selected institutions in order to produce in-demand high skilled labor and applied 
research. It will also facilitate talent and labor mobility at the regional level. The ACE initiative 
will also be integrated within the knowledge agenda and human capital development narrative. 
129. Health and Nutrition. Two operations for control of Malaria and HIV-AIDS closed 
respectively in 2011 and 2012. An Additional Financing of the FY10 Health System 
Performance project was approved by the Bank in FY12 to support the Government’s national 
Free Malaria Care Initiative for pregnant women and children under-five (2011). The Health 
System Performance Project will continue to play a catalytic role in the health sector, in 
leveraging additional financing for the Result-Based Financing (RBF) mechanism. So far, the 
Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI) and the Global Fund have agreed to join 
the RBF joint basket fund. Belgium and UNICEF have already expressed their desire to do so 
later on. In addition to the nationwide rolling out of RBF and still with the objective of 
improving accessibility, quality and efficiency of health care delivery, the Bank will continue 
working with IFC for launching the Hospital PPP project. This new hospital will provide tertiary 
care through a Government contract with a private operator. This arrangement is supported by a 
US$4 million GPOBA grant. To speed up improvements in child nutrition, the Bank and 
UNICEF, UNFPA and Japan have been supporting the policy dialogue on nutrition since 2007 
with a pilot Community Nutrition Project and a TA project (FY12). Through an IDF grant 
(FY13), the Bank will provide technical assistance to the newly created Food and Nutrition 
Council, to strengthen its capacity to formulate and implement multi-sectoral nutrition policy 
reforms.  The Bank will also use its convening power to mobilize additional donor resources 
behind the Government’s Scaling-Up-Nutrition ambitions as articulated in the SCPR-3. A new 
multi-sectoral Food/ Health and Nutrition operation (FY14) is under preparation to enhance 
household food security and maternal and child health and nutrition outcomes through 
community mobilization and community-based service delivery. 
Poverty and Gender Analysis 
130. A poverty and gender assessment is nearing completion. This assessment will inform 
ongoing and future ESW/AAA work and guide the incorporation of gender considerations in 
investment operations. As noted, female-headed households tend to be less poor on average than 
male-headed households, though the reasons behind this outcome are not fully understood. The 
assessment should allow for a greater understanding of this finding. The analysis will also review 
government spending, disaggregated by sex, and will help inform the policy dialogue on the 
benefits of targeted spending.  The results of the assessment will be widely disseminated and 
workshops and information sessions will be held with a broad cross-section of Benin’s civil 
society and donor community, fostering greater public awareness of gender issues and increased 
public, civil society and donor pressure for actions towards increased gender equality in Benin. 
131. A cross-cutting AAA is also planned to study service delivery in social sectors and 
enhancements to the safety nets. This study, to be finalized in FY17, will also provide a 
roadmap for meeting the new/revised MDGs that are expected to be adopted in 2015.   
D. Results Monitoring 
132. The Results Matrix found at Annex 1 presents the results chain for the Bank’s 
support program, using Benin’s SCRP-3 as its starting point and narrowing down the range of 

36 

 
 
outcomes to those that the Bank can demonstrably influence over the CPS period.  CPS 
outcomes will be monitored jointly by the Bank and the Government over the CPS period, in the 
spirit of the Paris and Accra Declarations, and in coordination with other donors. Since most of 
the operations foreseen in this CPS will likely not finish implementation until after 2017, results 
during this CPS period will come mainly from existing operations. 
133. The country team will monitor the portfolio in real time by convening portfolio 
reviews chaired by the Minister of Planning at least once every quarter. The Bank will prepare 
a CPS progress report in 2015 or earlier if needed, to evaluate progress towards CPS outcomes 
and adjust the strategy and program. Systemic issues in the portfolio will be addressed as 
follows: (1) to avoid effectiveness delays, efforts will be made to complete most effectiveness 
conditions prior to Board approval; (2) implementation periods will be set realistically, in light of 
past performance; (3) procurement delays will be reduced by shortening the period of time taken 
by the National Directorate for the Monitoring of Public Procurement to review procurement 
documents and the time taken by the Minister of Economy and Finance to approve contracts; (4) 
efforts will be made to use Project Preparation Advance to improve project implementation 
readiness; and (5) MTRs will take place on schedule and restructurings will be undertaken within 
six months of mission completion. 

IV. Risks and Mitigation 
134. The risks to implementation of the World Bank Group FY13-17 program during 
the CPS period are both internal and external in nature. Internal risks include the potential 
deterioration of the macroeconomic framework due to recurrent wage bill increases and weak 
administrative capacity which may slow Bank program implementation. Failure to curb 
corruption, or the mere perception by the citizenry that corruption is not being addressed 
effectively, could jeopardize the Government’s reform agenda; vested interests among 
politicians, civil servants, trade unionists and private sector operators may hamper the 
implementation and effectiveness of reforms, and prevent removing critical constraints to 
economic growth and service delivery. In response to these risks, the annual PRSC operations 
will support effective implementation of the Government’s anti-corruption legislation, including 
the establishment of the national anti-corruption authority, the enactment of whistleblower 
protections, and the introduction of asset and conflict of interest disclosure mechanisms. Further 
delays to improve the port’s competitiveness through a transparent partnership with private 
sector, would slow economic activity and reduce growth. Lack of progress on judicial reform 
could negatively impact private investment and attract money laundering and drug trafficking 
activities. Limited capacity in the public administration jeopardizes the implementation of the 
Government's 
reform program. These governance-related 
risks could 
impact CPS 
implementation will be addressed through a number of measures, including the provision of 
technical assistance and advisory support on port operations, ongoing strengthening of country 
systems, capacity building support for the public service, and dedicated support to resolve 
financial management and procurement bottlenecks. On the environmental front, the country is 
prone to floods; their frequency and intensity is expected to increase in the years to come. Thus, 
there are potential natural disaster and climate change risks. In addition to the environment-
sensitive activities embedded in current and proposed lending operations, the CPS envisages 
AAA and TA activities designed to address, for example, climate change in agriculture, support 
on hazardous wastes, and measures to improve air quality.    

37 

 
 
 
135. Potential external shocks include the loss of trade and fiscal revenues should Nigeria 
undertake broad trade liberalization reforms. Given that 20 percent of Benin’s GDP is 
dependent on trade with Nigeria, policy decisions in Nigeria, particularly trade liberalization, 
could significantly impact Benin. This would directly and meaningfully affect the level of transit 
and re-export trade, with consequent impact on the level of economic activity, employment and 
fiscal revenues. In addition, the reduction of fuel subsidies in Nigeria and its impact on inflation 
and economic activity in Benin in 2012 through the illegal fuel trade has further highlighted 
Benin’s exposure to developments in Nigeria. This risk could also undermine implementation of 
the CPS, and to address it, the Bank will support Government’s efforts to strengthen the business 
environment, reduce dependence on Nigeria by scaling up economic diversification, and 
facilitate the establishment of special economic zones designed to formally service the Nigerian 
market.    
136. External risks also include a continuation of piracy in Benin's territorial waters which 
would likely trigger increases in insurance premiums and result in lower trade revenue. 
Unfavorable regional developments, such as the expansion of the conflict in Northern Mali, the 
return of civil war in Côte d'Ivoire, or increased insecurity in Nigeria, could have severe 
consequences on Benin’s political stability, economic performance and level of foreign direct 
investments. A worsening of the Euro crisis, or a sharp contraction of the US economy, or 
further contagion of the global crisis to emerging markets, would have a negative impact on the 
current account balance, generate lower remittances from abroad, reduce foreign direct 
investments and reduce development assistance to the country. Energy price hikes as a result of 
disruptions on the international markets would also severely impact Benin. To mitigate the 
potential for such risks to undermine CPS implementation, the Bank Group, in close cooperation 
with the IMF, will continue to work with the authorities to sustain macroeconomic stability, and 
to respond flexibly to emerging external developments.   
137. Endogenous economic risks to CPS implementation are mitigated by a series of 
programmatic DPLs designed to keep the macro framework in good order, support the fight 
against corruption, and strengthen public financial management and procurement. The DPL 
series will be supported by AAA/ESW work and complemented by a capacity building operation 
designed to enhance the skills in public administration; and by investment operations that are 
expected to improve the business environment and competitiveness, and help mitigate the risk of 
natural disasters. Civil service reform 12is being addressed by other development partners 
(Netherlands, Denmark), paving the way for a more ambitious reform program once consensus 
has been reached within the Government. In addition, IDA is proposing to support a series of 
engagements with domestic stakeholders, including the National Assembly and civil society, in 
order to build and reinforce consensus around key reforms. The broad dissemination of AAA and 
ESW work will also contribute to increase public understanding of structural reforms. Public 
awareness of necessary reforms and an appreciation of the challenges are important for building 
consensus and garnering broad support for reforms.  
138. Portfolio risks to CPS implementation will be addressed through pro-active 
implementation support and structured dialogue with stakeholders. The CPS includes 
specific mitigation for known risks and incorporates sufficient flexibility to address emerging 
issues, with regular periodic exchange with decision makers built into its design. Major known 

12The wage bill to tax revenue ratio reached 46.8 percent in 2011; meaning that 0.7 percent of Beninese captured 7.4 
percent of GDP. 

38 

 
 
                                                 
risks relate to late effectiveness and fiduciary issues, notably procurement. These are addressed 
by paying attention to the readiness for implementation of projects, including a good 
understanding by counterparts and regular monitoring of steps needed for project effectiveness. 
Improving national fiduciary systems is a key objective of the CPS, supported through PRSCs, 
the proposed TA operation, and AAA and Trust Fund activities. These interventions provide 
stakeholders with the tools needed to address issues as they come up. Furthermore, slippages 
during project implementation will be addressed through proactive portfolio management, which 
includes timely identification and resolution of issues, as well as project restructuring or exit 
where needed. There is also scope to incorporate critical policy issues into the PRSC program. 
Finally, close coordination with donors through the various sectoral committees will help ensure 
that systemic issues affecting the portfolio and programs are addressed in a coherent and 
coordinated way, and reduce risks that may not have been anticipated. 
139. Risks of a political nature are mostly mitigated by other development partners, in 
particular the EU, France, Germany and the US who are leading the efforts to support the 
reform of the justice sector, the fight against terrorism and transnational organized crime, and 
who are also providing logistical reinforcement to Government’s efforts to fight piracy. France 
and UNICEF are also involved in human rights enhancement and child protection activities. An 
IDF grant (FY11) finances the implementation of anti-money laundering and combating the 
financing of terrorism in Benin.

BENIN – CAS COMPLETION REPORT (FY09-12) 

I. 
Introduction 
1. 
This Country Assistance Strategy Completion Report assesses the IDA strategy for Benin 
for the period FY09-12 (Report No. 46485-BJ). It describes the support provided through an 
integrated package of financial and knowledge services and (i) reviews the progress made toward 
achieving the country level goals as defined by the Government; (ii) evaluates the program 
performance; (iii) reviews the Bank performance, and (iv) presents key lessons and suggestions 
for the new Country Partnership Strategy (CPS).   
A. Economic and Social Background 
2. 
With a per capita income of US$ 800 in 2011, Benin ranks in the lower income group of 
countries. Following fundamental political change in 1989, the country has enjoyed relative 
political stability and democracy has been strengthened. Presidential elections were held in 
March 2011 and incumbent President Boni Yayi was elected in the first round of voting with 
some 53 percent of the vote. Legislative elections followed in April 2011 and the President’s 
party won 41 out of 83 seats in parliament which together with those won by coalition parties 
gives the President a working majority in Parliament, a majority which he did not have for most 
of the preceding period and which made reforms difficult.   
3. 
A decade ago, Benin was seen as an ambitious performer and a model for other West 
African countries. Unfortunately, this level of performance was not maintained and a period of 
reform stagnation set in. This was largely due to difficulties in implementing ambitious Poverty 
Reduction Strategies in a contentious and divisive though democratic political environment.  
4. 
Growth in 2009-2012 was moderate averaging around 3.2 percent annually. This is 
marginally below the regional average and contributed to modest increases in per capita incomes 
and some improvements in human development in spite of a relatively high population growth 
(3.2 percent p.a.). The economy relies heavily on the agricultural sector, cotton in particular, and 
on re-export and transit trade with Nigeria and other neighboring countries. The agricultural 
sector accounts for about 32 percent of GDP and provides nearly 70 percent of employment, 
while cotton is the major primary export commodity representing typically 25 to 40 percent of 
total exports. Re-export trade with Nigeria alone accounts for some 20 percent of GDP. 
B. World Bank Program of Support 
5. 
The current CAS was discussed by the Board of Directors of the Bank in February 2009. 
The CAS strategic objectives were in line with the second Poverty Reduction Strategy of the 
Government (Stratégie de Croissance pour la Reduction de la Pauvreté-SCRP 2).The Bank’s 
strategic priorities were informed by the Government’s SCRP, the lessons learnt from the 
implementation of the previous CAS (FY04-FY06), and from the results of a Client Survey 
conducted in 2007.  

55 

 
 
 
6. 
The Bank followed essentially the overall thrust of the CAS while making adjustments in 
response to exogenous factors such as the international financial crisis, the food and fuel price 
increases and the devastating 2010 floods. All lending operations in the original program were 
approved by the end of FY12 except for a regional IT program where the region’s priority was to 
deal with post-conflict countries. The initial lending program was modified to include 
supplemental credits to the PRSC 6 and the Community Development Project, and the urban and 
agriculture projects approved in FY11 were expanded and reoriented to include emergency 
assistance. Emergency operations in food security and community nutrition financed with trust 
funds were also approved.   
C. Summary of CAS Program Performance 
7. 
The CAS program performance is rated moderately satisfactory as the country made 
progress towards all major expected outcomes despite external shocks and internal political 
tensions between the executive and the legislative during the CAS implementation period. 
Program performance has to be viewed in the context of exogenous and unplanned factors that 
affected Benin during the period including the fuel and food price increases, the world economic 
downturn and devastating floods in 2010, the worst in 50 years. The floods caused estimated 
damages of some US$250 million or 3.4 percent of GDP, and over 680 thousand people were 
affected with 46 deaths and 150,000 left homeless. In spite of adverse conditions, the 
Government met its IMF targets and there was some growth although CAS indicators with 
respect to budget execution were only partially achieved. The decline in budget execution was 
linked to tighter expenditure management resulting from a shortfall in revenues but the 
Government concentrated expenditures in priority sectors such as education and health. 
Diversification was also affected by the 2010 floods. Reforms in the cotton sector proceeded, 
though these were substantially reversed in early 2012. Despite the backsliding on reforms in 
2012, cotton production improved in 2012/13 to near record levels. Substantial progress was 
made in increasing access to telecommunications and electricity (CAS indicators).  Important 
reforms were also introduced to port operations, trade and customs regulations, and the Port of 
Cotonou was expanded through a PPP which should lead to increased trade and reduced 
merchandise costs. Despite the policy reversal on the import verification program, again in early 
2012, port performance improved markedly over 2012 and into 2013. 
8. 
With respect to the provision of basic services, there has been substantial progress in 
increasing access to safe water in rural areas, which rose from 44 percent in 2006 to 61 percent 
in 2011. The programmatic approach and decentralization which led to these results were 
promoted by the PRSCs. The ongoing Community Development Project resulted in increased 
services, and this, along with work under the ongoing Second Decentralized City Management 
Project which also focused on local structures, point to the effectiveness of programs that focus 
on decentralization. There were improvements in the education sector and the Bank assessment 
is that progress under the Sector Development plan supported by donors is moderately 
satisfactory. Access has increased significantly, with enrolment rates rising from 98.5 percent to 

56 

 
 
110.6 in 2010, even though a gender imbalance remains. Completion rates declined in part 
because of the rapid increase in enrolments but also because there continue to be high repetition 
rates and high dropout rates, the latter the result of the deteriorating economy. In hindsight, it 
should be recognized that increases in completion rates in the context of Benin cannot be easily 
achieved in the short term.  In health, all CAS objectives which could be measured at this time -- 
vaccination rates and improved services for pregnant women and HIV patients—were met. 
9. 
A number of measures to improve public administration are being implemented, 
including measures in a financial management action plan prepared on the basis of the 
recommendations of the 2007 Public Expenditure and Financial Assessment (PEFA).  
Legislation which establishes the institutions and procedures to expedite and render transparent 
public procurement has been approved and six of the seven regulatory decrees have been passed. 
Anti-corruption legislation was approved by Parliament in 2011. The Government is also 
beginning to decentralize the provision of services and has included the community development 
approach as part of its decentralization process.  A mechanism for the transfer of funds to the 
local communities, which had begun some years ago, was expanded in 2010. The 2012 PEFA 
shows modest improvement in overall- and sub-indicators, even though about 2/3 remain rated C 
or below.    
10. World Bank performance is rated satisfactory. The CAS was relevant, aligned with the 
Government’s SCRP, and the design and implementation of the Bank program contributed to the 
achievement of CAS outcomes. The higher rating for bank performance than for CAS outcomes 
is justified because the Bank staff showed considerable flexibility and agility, as it increased and 
adjusted the Bank’s support to help address the new and unforeseen challenges, and delivered a 
package of services which helped mitigate external shocks. 
II. 
Progress towards Achieving SCRP Country Goals 
11. 
The Government’s SCRP 2 assumed that effective poverty reduction could only be 
achieved in an environment of economic growth and this was made the focus of the strategy. 
SCRP 2 was built around strategic pillars aiming to (i) strengthen competitiveness and 
accelerating private sector development; (ii) infrastructure development; (iii) improving access to 
basic services; (iv) promoting better governance and strengthening institutional capacities; and 
(v) promoting balanced development.  Country level goals associated to the CAS program are 
summarized in the first column of the CAS outcome Matrix. 
D. Pillar I: Economic Growth and Diversification 
Benin has made progress in consolidating macroeconomic stability and improving some social 
indicators and has achieved positive economic growth outcomes despite the global economic 
downturn and natural disasters during the period. However, progress in terms of poverty 
reduction has been limited.  The incidence of poverty at the national level was estimated to be 
36.2 percent in 2011, compared to 35 percent in 2009 and 37 percent in 2006; the aggregate 

57 

 
 
12. 
figure masks important urban-rural and regional differences as rural poverty was 39.7 
percent in 2011 and the poverty rate was 61.2 percent in the poorest commune. 
13. 
Progress was made towards achieving the SCRP objectives of aligning the budget to 
PRSP priorities, maintaining an acceptable GDP growth rate and stable 
inflation. 
Macroeconomic management has been broadly commendable and the Government has generally 
met objectives agreed with the IMF.  
14. 
Key economic indicators during the CAS period are given in the table below. After 
several years of improving growth performance (increasing from 2.9 percent in 2005 to 5.0 
percent in 2008) growth slowed to 2.7 percent in 2009 and 2.6 percent in 2010. Growth picked 
up to 3.5 percent in 2011 and is estimated at 3.9% in 2012.  Aside from the effects of the fuel and 
food crisis and the floods, weaker performance in 2009 and 2010 was the result of a decrease in 
re-exports trade, partly because of trade liberalization in Nigeria; lower cotton production; and 
lower foreign direct investment, the result of the international financial crisis. Inflation, which 
peaked in 2008 at 8.0 percent during the food crisis and fuel price increases, fell to 2.2 percent in 
2009 and2.7 percent in 2011, but rose to 6.8 percent following the partial removal of fuel 
subsidies in Nigeria (January 2012) and recent efforts by authorities to fight illegal fuel trade 
(November 2012). 
15. 
Over the CAS period, the Government introduced tight budgetary controls to better 
match expenditures with receipts; the tight controls have affected service delivery and the 
implementation of the public investment program. To ensure that basic services are not 
compromised, the Government explicitly identified priority social expenditures in the 2011 
budget and has put in place a tracking and monitoring system to ensure that identified 
expenditures are protected in the event of further revenue shortfalls.  Execution of priority social 
expenditures exceeded 100 percent in 2012. 
16. 
Benin has made progress in meeting the macroeconomic convergence criteria set by 
WAEMU. It has met four of the five primary criteria (relating to inflation; the accumulation of 
domestic and external arrears and debt to GDP) and the fifth objective relating to the basic fiscal 
balance to GDP has virtually been met.  Benin also made progress in meeting secondary criteria 
(table at the end of Annex 1). However, the wage increases approved for civil service employees 
starting in August 2011 have put pressure on an already inflated public sector wage bill which at 
45% of tax revenues exceeds the WAEMU convergence criteria of 35% though the Government 
is committed to remain within the wage bill ceiling agreed to in the IMF program. 
Limited progress has been made in improving the business climate. Investment was 
affected by the global downturn and private investment remained stagnant during 2008-2012. 
There has been limited improvement in its Doing Business Indicators (DBI) with a slight 
improvement in ranking from 176 in 2011 (DB12) to 175 in 2012 (DB13). With the support of 
IFC, Benin implemented reforms in several areas of business regulation, namely: dealing with 
construction permits; enforcing contracts; starting a business; and trading across borders. 
However, apart from the starting a business and dealing with construction permit indicators, 

17. 

58 

 
 
where reforms impacted the rankings, effort is still required in order to deepen recent reforms 
and have more impact on the private sector enabling environment. Areas which are currently in 
need of significant improvements including: electricity access, registering property, protecting 
investors and paying taxes. IFC will continue to support the improvement of Benin’s investment 
climate and Doing Business Indicators and the adoption and implementation of the OHADA new 
“Entreprenant” status revised uniform acts.  To maintain the momentum of ongoing reforms, a 
two-year TA program funded by SECO will focus on: (i) supporting additional Doing Business 
reforms; and (ii) the implementation of OHADA’s Uniform Acts at the national level supporting 
the implementation of the OHADA new “entreprenant status.” The presidential committee to 
prepare and introduce reforms was established in 2011 with delays. Also, changes in legislation 
needed to improve the DBIs were regarded as politically sensitive and not submitted to the 
parliament.  Some progress was made in structural reforms related to private investment, 
including the award of the concession for operation of the container terminal at the Port of 
Cotonou in 2009 and the sale of the cotton ginning, cement and wood companies to strategic 
private investors.  As discussed in the next paragraph, with regard to cotton reforms, these were 
substantially reversed in 2012 when the state took control over cotton production, ginning and 
marketing activities following nearly two decades of progressive Government disengagement 
from the sector.  While the Government effectively managed cotton activities for the 2012/13 
crop season, which resulted in a substantial increase in production, this involvement was costly 
and unsustainable. Looking forward, the State is considering moving to a zoned concession 
system which is successfully implemented in some neighboring countries. The Government has 
requested support from the World Bank in restructuring the cotton sector, to which the Bank has 
favorably responded through technical assistance to share best practices in cotton sector 
governance. It is unlikely that the new institutional framework will be effective prior to 
the2014/15 crop season.

Progress towards meeting the Government objective of diversifying the economy has 
been slow, and cotton remains Benin’s largest single official export, representing some 22-24 
percent of exports in 2010-11.  Cotton production fell to about half the level of its recent high in 
2004/05 of 417,000 tons with production for 2011 in the range of 200,000 tons. This trend can be 
partially attributed to an inefficient quasi-monopolistic sector management by the private sector 
and to the appreciation of the Euro to which the CFAF is pegged, which depressed domestic 
cotton prices. However, cotton prices began to rise over the CAS period so the dynamic going 
forward may be different. Reforms of the cotton and input markets and in the agriculture sector 
more broadly moved slower than anticipated and this also contributed to weak agricultural 
performance and falling cotton production. In April 2012, the government suspended the 
agreement (“Accord-cadre”) with the private sector Inter-professional Cotton (AIC) Association 
governing the sector and assumed full responsibility over the entire value-chain. While concerns 
were initially expressed (mostly by the private sector and donors) following this policy reversal, 
cotton production is projected to reach at least 350,000 tons in 2012 (a 75 percent increase over 
the previous campaign) due to exceptional government involvement and favorable rainfalls. .  
E. Pillar II: Infrastructure 
19. 
There has been some progress in promoting growth-inducing infrastructure, through 
reforms in telecommunications and electricity, although key objectives have not been met. There 
has been impressive growth in broadband access and global teledensity which rose from 13 
percent in 2007 to 80.6 percent in September 2012 due in large part due to the expansion of 
mobile operators. The privatization of Benin Telecom, a government objective, was launched but 
in 2011 the Government did not accept an offer received, which it regarded as low compared to 
those of neighboring countries. A new regional communications infrastructure project approved 
in FY13 will provide investments for additional bandwidths and international connectivity by 
connecting Benin to the Africa Coast to Europe cable.  
20. With respect to electricity supply, access to electricity increased from 26 percent of the 
population to 30 percent in 2011. Supply reliability has improved and more capacity is available 
for new customers and rural electrification. The northern part of Benin, which was supplied with 
electricity from diesel generators is now connected to the national grid and is supplied with 
cheaper hydro and thermal generation (10,000 GWh).  
21. 
Steps have been taken to improve governance in the power sector. The Benin Electricity 
Code, which establishes the regulatory agency, was approved in 2009. The code encourages 
private sector participation in the power sector.  The financial situation of the SBEE, power 
distribution utility, has improved following the implementation of a financial recovery plan 
begun in 2010, which increased incomes and stabilized expenses. Net losses decreased from 
CFAF 17.4 billion in 2009 to CFAF 1.4 billion in 2010 and net income  became positive in 2011 
(CFAF 2.6 billion). A positive net income of 3.3 CFAF billion is expected for 2012. The 
financial health of SBEE, however, remains fragile and must continue to be consolidated. 

60 

 
 
22. 
Some progress was made in promoting trade and regional integration.  Critical port 
reforms have advanced, which should improve service to the private sector, although the reforms 
are relatively recent and results remain to be seen. Costs in the port of Cotonou account for the 
bulk of the cost of importing goods using the Cotonou-Niamey corridor, the highest among 
alternative gateways in West Africa. Benin ranks better than all but one other DBI indicator 
(getting credit) in the trading across borders ranking, placing at 130 out of 183 countries 
(DB2013). Costs to import and export are low in comparison to African countries -- US$1,549 to 
import a container compared to the SSA average of U$2,567, and $1,079 to export a container 
compared to a SSA cost of US$1,990.  However, the cost to export or import for Benin is higher 
than the costs of importing and exporting in the coastal neighbors of Togo (US$940 and 
US$1109, respectively) or Ghana (US$815 and US$1,315, respectively). Beninese time of 
trading across borders is above the average of other coastal countries in West Africa, with about 
29 days’ time needed to comply with export procedures versus 22 days in regional coastal 
countries; and 30 days to import goods versus 28.2 days average for regional coastal countries 13.  
23. With respect to regional trade in electricity, Benin is increasingly participating in the 
regional power pool, which should bring down costs and improve reliability. Supply of 
electricity has improved in the sub region since 2003 through the regional power system 
interconnection (West Africa Power Pool). The West African Gas Pipeline was completed in 
2011 and compressed gas is available at the premises of CEB, the Togo-Benin Power Generating 
and Transmission Company. Generation from gas will reduce thermal generation costs in the 
country. 
F. Pillar III: Provision of Basic Services 
24. 
The Government strategy called for improvements in urban sanitation by strengthening 
municipalities; developing safe water supply services; expanding sanitation works; ensuring 
primary education for all by the year 2015 and strengthening vocational and technical training 
development and improving the accessibility and quality of health services. Social indicators 
have been improving marginally in education and health while progress in the water sector has 
been notable. Between 2008 and 2010, primary school enrolment increased by more than four 
percentage points but primary school completion rates fell, pointing to difficulties in absorbing 
the increased enrolment but also indicating that the quality of education remains an issue.  There 
are gender inequalities and females represent 46 percent of all students enrolled in primary 
school and female completion rates are 59 percent compared to the overall completion rate of 66 
percent.  These outcomes are below SCRP 2 targets of 77 percent for overall primary school 
completion and 70 percent for female primary school completion rate.  
25. 
Health sector indicators have also improved, but less than expected. The utilization rate 
of basic health services by the general population improved slightly, from 45.6 percent in 2008 
to 46.5 in 2010, while the utilization rate by children under-five increased from 76 percent to 

13 Nigeria, Togo, Ghana, Cote d’Ivoire, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea, Guinea Bissau, Senegal, The Gambia. 
Figures based on DB 2013 report. 

61 

 
 
                                                 
nearly 85 percent in 2010. Limited progress was made in improving the performance of the 
health sector and health workers have spent many days on strike. Access to potable water in the 
rural areas increased from 36 percent in 2003 to 57.2 percent in 2010 (58.5 percent in urban 
areas), putting Benin on the path to achievement of the MDG in water.  This is largely the result 
of using more programmatic approaches, greater decentralization in the water sector and 
measures to improve capacity. 
G. Pillars IV and V: Good Governance, Institutional Capacity and Balanced Development 
26. 
Good governance and increased transparency remain challenging though a priority.  The 
Government made progress in strengthening public financial management. A new procurement 
code was adopted by the National Assembly and the regulatory framework to implement the new 
code is almost in place with six out of the seven decrees required already approved. Progress in 
implementation of procurement reforms will be a test of government commitment to changes in 
governance. The Government prepared a comprehensive action plan to strengthen public finance 
management based on the findings of the 2007 PEFA and the 2012 PEFA self-assessment 
indicates some progress. Although considerable technical support was provided by the European 
Union and other donors, a constraint to the implementation of some of the planned measures in 
the action plan has been the absence of technical support. The use of exceptional procedures was 
reduced as was the backlog on external audits.  Progress was also made in the areas of internal 
and external audits with the implementation of a "harmonized" program of audits by internal 
oversight structures. 
27. 
The Government has begun the process of decentralization by devolving authority and 
budgets to the local communities. The water sector has been a success in this area; funds were 
transferred from the central government to local communities and were effectively utilized in the 
provision of potable water services to local populations.  PPPs were fostered and there is now 
significant private sector participation in the delivery of water with over 30 percent of village 
water systems managed under PPP arrangements.  The Government has begun testing the 
systems to channel more funds from the central government to the municipalities. 
III. CAS Program Performance 
H. Overview 
28. 
The CAS program performance is rated moderately satisfactory as the country made 
progress towards all major expected outcomes. Program performance has to be viewed in the 
context of exogenous and unforeseen factors that affected Benin during the period including the 
fuel and food price increases, the world economic downturn and devastating floods in 2010, the 
worst in 50 years. The CAS program was adjusted to help Benin meet these challenges, and it is 
likely that economic performance and other indicators related to poverty would have deteriorated 
in the absence of the Bank program.   
29. 
The CAS covered the period FY09-12. The CAS program sought to selectively support 
SCRP 2 which was under implementation at the time.  The CAS was structured around three 

62 

 
 
strategic objectives which coincided with pillars of the SCRP: (i) strengthening competitiveness 
and accelerating private sector-led growth; (ii) improving access to basic services; and (iii) 
promoting better governance 
and 
strengthening 
institutional 
capacities, 
including 
decentralization in the provision of services.  The CAS used a mix of instruments, including 
DPLs, programmatic approaches, and investment operations.  The CAS was not a joint IDA/IFC 
assistance strategy, but it was prepared in close collaboration with IFC and it exploited the 
synergies within the World Bank Group and with other donors to deliver the assistance program.  
30. 
As the program mirrored the SCRP, ownership, government leadership and better 
harmonization of donor efforts, which were objectives of the SCRP, were built into the CAS. 
Donor coordination was expanded. Capacity enhancement was done particularly through 
investment operations and trust fund financing which was executed by the Bank (e.g., 
institutional development grant for training of auditors).  The program covered 13 areas/sectors 
and was not particularly selective.  
31. 
During the FY09-FY12 CAS period, the Board approved 17 operations for Benin totaling 
US$398.3 million. These include four regional operations totaling US$27.5 million. This 
compares to the planned operations for US$312 million (including US$12.0 million in regional 
operations). Of this, policy-based lending will amount to US$112 million or about 28 percent of 
total financing with three Poverty Reduction Strategy Credits (PRSCs) and one supplemental 
credit. PRSG VII was approved in FY12. The number of PRSCs, including the supplemental 
credit, was the same as that proposed in the CAS.  The program for FY09 and FY10 was 
supplemented with emergency operations to mitigate the effects of the food crisis including two 
food security projects and one nutrition project financed with trust funds for a total of US$21.4 
million. The FY11 program was reoriented to include emergency relief following the economic 
downturn and floods. A PRSC VI supplemental credit focused on emergency relief, and 
additional financing was also provided for the Community Development Project. The Urban 
Environment project was increased by US$20 million and the Agriculture Diversification Project 
postponed and expanded to include emergency assistance. Analytical work and technical 
assistance during the CAS period focused on the areas of concentration, including public finance, 
health and education. A study on the impact of the 2010 floods was also carried out in 
cooperation with the United Nations.    
32. 
Reforms associated with the PRSCs focused on measures to maintain a stable 
macroeconomic framework, establish a modern regulatory framework for electricity, cotton 
sector reform, reforms to improve the provision of social services and measures to improve 
governance, principally through improvements in the budgetary process and public procurement. 
Decentralization of services, especially water was also encouraged through policy based lending. 
Investment lending focused on the same areas. Two operations and a supplemental credit (for 
community development and urban infrastructure), for a total of US$102 million or some 26 
percent of total financial assistance will use decentralized/deconcentrated structures.  This was 
higher than originally planned and the structures proved effective in the provision of services at 

63 

 
 
the local level. The program based approach was used in education, to some extent in health and 
is being gradually introduced in the community development programs. The program based 
approach has not been introduced to the extent planned in the CAS because the institutional 
framework and fiduciary controls in some ministries such as agriculture does not yet permit it. 
33. 
The Bank program was coordinated with that of other donors. Progress in the SCRP 2 is 
discussed at yearly donor meetings, and donors have agreed on a framework for budget support 
(a CAS indicator). Non-lending activities were also coordinated with other donors. The main 
areas of cooperation were in the public finance and macroeconomic areas. The European Union 
carried out the Public Expenditure Review in 2007 and is conducting a second one for 2011. 
Also providing support in public finance are the Governments of Denmark, France, Germany 
and the Netherlands. The analytical work done in health and in secondary education and skills 
development complements work supported by other donors. The financial assistance in health is 
closely coordinated with other donors and a program-based approach with pooled funds is used 
in education.  There is also close coordination with other donors in the Decentralized 
Community Driven Services Development Project approved in FY12.  Work of the IFC on the 
business environment and of the IFC and the MCC on the port of Cotonou made progress 
possible in meeting the CAS objectives in the business environment and trade areas.    
I. Progress by CAS Strategic Objectives 
Strengthening competitiveness and accelerating private sector-led growth (outcomes partly 
achieved).     
34. 
The objective was to be accomplished by supporting a stable macroeconomic framework 
and improving public financial management; strengthening competiveness and revitalizing the 
private sector; diversifying the economy through increased contribution of the agricultural sector 
to growth and promoting growth inducing infrastructure (energy and telecommunications).  
35. 
Support under this theme became crucial for the Bank’s engagement following the food 
and fuel crisis and the flood. Macroeconomic management has been broadly satisfactory. The 
Government met IMF targets but specific CAS objectives on budget execution were not 
achieved. This was due to the imposition of strict expenditure controls required to manage lower 
than expected revenues. The Government concentrated expenditures in priority social sectors.  
Support in this area included two PRSC’s and additional financing for PRSC VI for a total of 
US$82 million and a third PRSC for US$30 million approved by the Board in December 2011.       
36. 
Achievements in the area of investment climate reform were less than planned.  Reforms 
to improve the investment climate were viewed as politically sensitive, and the Presidential 
Committee charged with preparing and implementing reforms was appointed in 2011, with some 
delay. Changes in the tax system to strengthen the business environment were introduced and the 
company registration costs were reduced, but these modifications were not sufficient to bring 
about substantial changes in the Doing Business Indicators (CAS indicators). IFC and the EU 
supported the studies required to put in place an investment climate reform program but the 

64 

 
 
PRSC series did not focus on the regulatory environment as measured by the Doing Business 
Indicators.   
37. 
Diversification was affected by exogenous factors such as the 2010 floods, but the slow 
pace of sector reforms also contributed to outcomes. While reform in the cotton sector 
proceeded, and the cotton ginning facilities were privatized, cotton production and export related 
outcome indicators were not met. Indicators focusing on cotton were probably not good 
measures of results in this area, as these had much to do with weather conditions and external 
market forces. Other agricultural reforms such as the establishment of a system to distribute 
agricultural inputs, a CAS indicator, are underway but have not been finalized. 
38. 
Emergency IDA and trust fund financing contributed to mitigating the effect of the food 
crisis. The food security projects were to distribute 8,500 tons of fertilizer to some 50,000 rice 
and maize producers. By 2010, the project had distributed 9,100 tons of fertilizer which 
generated an additional supply of 10 thousand tons of rice (out of 125 thousand tons total output) 
and 65 thousand tons of maize (out of 1,012 thousand tons total output). The Agricultural 
Diversification Project approved in FY11 will expand the input programs initiated under the 
emergency projects.  
39. 
Progress was made in improving telecommunications and electricity services. In the 
telecommunications sector, CAS targets in terms of coverage were met but the revenue target 
was not achieved. Substantial progress was made in increasing teledensity, which reached 
80.6percent in September 2012 as mobile operators expanded and in broadband access (both 
CAS indicators). Support for the telecommunications divestiture was included in the CIGOP 
project (FY08), and the Bank approved a project (e-Benin) for improving electronic 
communications. The Regional project which was to include telecommunications hardware was 
approved in FY13.  In electricity, the Bank approved one project for US$70 million.  In addition, 
the implementation of the ongoing Energy Services Delivery Project continued. Progress was 
made in modernizing the regulatory framework for electricity and in improving the operations 
and financial condition of the electricity company.  CAS targets in electricity, which dealt with 
efficiency, were partially achieved while the targets on new connections were met.  In hindsight, 
the target on losses was probably unrealistic as it appears to have been linked to execution of a 
project which had not been approved at the time of the CAS. 
40. With respect to the objective of reducing trade costs, important reforms are being 
introduced to port operations, and in trade and customs regulations. Measures taken include the 
establishment of a one stop shop for port transactions (“guichet unique”), the streamlining of 
import/export procedures, the subcontracting of key port operations to the private sector, reform 
of the import verification program, and consolidation of informatics systems. Reforms in the port 
sector were supported by the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) and the IFC. The Port 
of Cotonou was expanded and a concession for the operations of the port and of the new 
facilities granted with support from IFC (a CAS indicator).  The reforms should lead to increased 
trade and reduced merchandise costs although results cannot be seen yet. The most recent data on 

65 

 
 
cargo dwell time in the Port of Cotonou is 19 days, which is the average for West Africa 
although there is no reliable figure on the trend on cargo dwell time, the CAS indicator.  There 
are also no figures on cost trends. Costs to import and export are low in comparison to African 
countries -- US$1,400 to import a container compared to the SSA average of nearly U$2,400 and 
$1,250 to export a container compared to a SSA cost of US$1,942. However, the cost to export 
or import to Benin is higher than the cost of importing and exporting from the coastal neighbors 
of Togo (US$963 and US$940, respectively) or Ghana (US$1,391 and US$855, respectively). 
41. With respect to trade in electricity, Benin is increasingly importing electricity from 
regional electricity grid facilitated by investments financed under the Coastal Transmission 
Backbone Project (FY06). The CAS objective of improving access through the West Africa 
Power Pool was met; imports of CEB from the region increased by 54 percent in the 2006-2010 
period. Increased trade in electricity will improve power system reliability. 
Improving access to basic services(outcomes achieved) 
42. 
The CAS called for improvements in urban sanitation and access to safe water; the 
promotion of development-oriented education and improving the accessibility of health and 
nutrition services.  Financial assistance included investment operations in support of heath, urban 
development and a trust fund financed community nutrition project. An education project, 
approved in FY08 was under implementation during the CAS period. In addition, non-lending 
support included an environmental assessment, and a health sector review which have been 
completed and a tertiary education and training assessment which will completed in FY13. 
43. 
There has been substantial progress in increasing access to safe water in rural areas, 
which increased from 44 percent in 2006 to 57.2 percent in 2010. The programmatic approach 
and decentralization which led to these results were promoted by the PRSCs. The ongoing 
Second Decentralized City Management Project focused on local structures and the level of 
priority expenditures in urban centers, a CAS indicator, increased substantially, rising in 
Cotonou from 20 percent in 2005 to 35 percent in 2011. Increases in smaller cities, which had 
limited allocation to social services initially was much higher. People with access to paved roads 
in the principal cities, also a CAS indicator, increased by some 57 percent in the same period. 
The Emergency Urban Environment Project was approved in FY11.   
44. 
There were improvements in the education sector and the Bank assessment is that 
progress under the Sector Development plan supported by donors is moderately satisfactory. 
Access has increased significantly, with enrolment rates rising from 98.5 percent to 110.6 in 
2010 and for girls from 92.0 percent in 2007 to 106 percent in 2010.  Completion rates, the CAS 
target, declined in part because of the rapid increase in enrolments but also because there 
continue to be high repetition rates, reflecting the quality of education, and high dropout rates, 
partly the result of the deteriorating economy. Changes in completion rates are difficult to 
achieve in the short term in the context of Benin. The Government has begun putting in place a 
system to oversee private education and pilot programs designed to improve secondary education 
and training are being developed (CAS targets). The ongoing study on tertiary education and 

66 

 
 
training assessment will include recommendations for improving efficiency of the higher 
education and training sub-sector. 
45. 
The Bank assistance in the health sector during the CAS period included two projects 
under implementation (Malaria Control Booster Program and HIV/AIDS Control). In addition, a 
project designed to improve health system performance was approved in FY10, and additional 
financing was approved in FY12 to finance a continuation of the malaria program. All CAS 
objectives which could be measured at this time (vaccination rates and improved services for 
pregnant women and HIV patients) were met. On structural reforms, the MOH has decided to 
extend the hygiene and basic sanitation marketing approach, supported on a pilot basis under the 
PRSC-6, to the twelve departments of the country; the ultimate goal is to help prevent the 
recurrent upsurge of diseases such as cholera and diarrhea that particularly effect children under 
five.    
Promoting better governance and strengthening capacities (outcomes partly achieved) 
46. 
A number of measures to improve public administration are being implemented, 
including measures in a financial management action plan based on the recommendations of the 
2007 PEFA (Public Expenditure and Financial Assessment). Legislation which establishes the 
institutions and procedures to expedite and render transparent public procurement has been 
approved and six of the seven regulatory decrees have been passed. Measures are being taken to 
reduce corruption.  A public sector code of ethics was approved in 2010, and an anti- corruption 
law was approved by Parliament in 2011. Bank assistance included, in addition to the PRSPs, a 
Public Expenditure review focused on decentralization (FY11), a review of Standards and 
Norms, and training of private auditors on public sector audits, the last under an IDF grant.  In 
FY11 IDF grants were approved to assist in the Legal and Judicial Reform and to strengthen the 
Ministry of Development.  A Civil Service Reform TA, which was not programmed, was 
completed in the context of PRSC-7.  A Customs Assessment study, also not programmed, will 
be completed in FY13. 
47. 
The Government is also beginning to decentralize the provision of services and has 
included the community development approach as part of its decentralization process.  A specific 
mechanism for the transfer of funds to the local communities, which had begun some years ago, 
was expanded in 2010. The program has been successful in providing health and education 
services at the local level. For example, by May 2011, over 121 thousand students were enrolled 
in schools constructed/rehabilitated through CDD approach. The Bank program included a 
supplemental financing in support of the successful Community Development Project in FY11 
and a second Community Development Project was approved in FY12.  
IV. Review of Bank Performance 
48. World Bank performance is rated satisfactory. The CAS was relevant, aligned with the 
Government’s SCRP, and the design and implementation of the Bank program contributed to the 
achievement of CAS outcomes. A higher rating for Bank performance than for outcomes is 

67 

 
 
49. 

justified given the efforts made by Bank staff to address the emergencies confronted by Benin 
during the period and which helped mitigate the effects of the problems resulting from the 
economic downturn and natural disasters.    
The CAS period was characterized by a number of external shocks which greatly affected 
economic and social indicators.  The Bank showed considerable flexibility and it increased and 
adjusted its support to help address the new challenges, and delivered a package of services 
which helped mitigate the external shocks. Policy based lending through PRSCs and their link to 
the investment operations in the program has helped strengthen the alignment of Bank’s program 
to the Government’s priorities and strategies as laid out in SCRP 2. The CAS program of 
assistance has contributed to the maintenance of macroeconomic stability and to improvements 
of public finance management.  It also has brought to light the effectiveness of decentralization 
in providing services to the poor. Progress on structural reforms and overcoming institutional 
weaknesses has been more modest.  This reflects the intractability and time required to address 
structural issues and institutional reform.  
J. CAS Design 
50. 
The success achieved in some areas owes much to the fact that the CAS was aligned with 
the priorities of the Government and thus had local ownership. However, the depth of the 
political divisions within the country, the political ramifications of the proposed agenda, and the 
difficulties in building reform-oriented coalitions were not fully recognized in the CAS.  An 
analysis of the political and institutional constraints to growth-oriented policies was included in a 
Country Economic Memorandum which was completed in 2009. The CAS included a 
combination of budget support and investment lending which in the past has shown to be an 
effective approach to addressing structural reforms. The CAS attempted to be selective but in 
fact covered 13 sectors and cross-cutting areas. The CAS preparation team has to be commended 
for including detailed indicators, many of which were directly linked to operations in the 
program. Reflecting the breath of the program, there were 42 key indicators to measure progress, 
a high number. Some of the indicators presented difficulties, highlighting the problems in 
establishing appropriate indicators: (i) there was not a direct relationship between the CAS 
activities and the outcome (cotton); (ii) indicators had no base year data (electricity); (iii) others 
were the outcome of projects which were in the program and could not realistically be achieved 
within the CAS period (agriculture and electricity); and (iv) some were undefined and not 
regularly monitored (access gap to basic social services). The target year of 2012 was not 
realistic, as this is the year when the follow-up CAS would have to be prepared. The CAS 
emphasized the importance of monitoring but a monitoring framework was not set up in part 
because of staffing issues, discussed below. 
K. Implementing the Strategy 
51. 
The Bank followed essentially the overall thrust of the CAS while making adjustments in 
response to external shocks. All lending operations in the original program were approved except 
for a regional IT program where the region’s priority was given to post-conflict countries. The 

68 

 
 
planned assistance was expanded to include emergency operations in food security and 
community nutrition.  Additional financing for PRSC VI was made available in FY11 to help 
mitigate the effect of external shocks on the budget and agriculture and urban projects also 
approved in FY11 were revised and expanded to cover emergency assistance. With respect to 
analytical and advisory services, most planned analytical work has been completed except for a 
tertiary education assessment which is underway and expected to be completed in 2013 and an 
Energy Sector Review which has been postponed to FY15. A planned National Governance and 
Anti-Corruption Strategy was not prepared, but IDF grants to support Legal and Judicial 
Reforms and the strengthening of the Ministry of Development were approved.    
52. 
The risks identified in the CAS were well managed. The CAS anticipated that external 
shocks such as the effect of the world economic downturn and natural disasters materialized, and 
in response the Bank adjusted its assistance program. A mid-term review was not carried out. In 
reality, the external conditions changed frequently which made such a revision difficult. Also, a 
mid-term revision of activities would have been time-consuming and difficult to justify given the 
length of the CAS period.   
53. 
Follow up of the program entailed regular supervisions with most of the staff working on 
Benin assigned to Bank offices in the sub-region. In the FY08-11 period, the number of projects 
in the portfolio increased from 9 to 16 in FY11 and the net commitments by 40 percent for a total 
of US$593 million.  A number of projects closed in FY12 which brought commitments down to 
$340.8 million. The Benin portfolio risk is the same as that for Africa as a whole.

54. 
The Bank met its lending and non-lending objectives in spite of staffing issues.  There 
was no country manager for Benin for one out of the three years of CAS implementation, as it 
took considerable time to select a Country Manager to replace the previous Country Manager 
who retired. Also, there was no locally-based staff charged with following up on operations.  It is 
likely that portfolio follow up could have been better if office in Cotonou had been fully staffed.  
A CPPR was conducted in November 2011.  
55. 
Three budget support operations (PRSC V, VI and its additional financing as well as 
PRSG-7) were approved and disbursed in the FY09-12 period. Only two investment projects 

69 

 
 
 
 
exited the portfolio in the FY09-FY11 period, the Cotton Project and the Malaria Booster 
Program. However, in FY12, 3 operations exited (Second Multi-sectoral HIV/AIDS, Second 
Decentralized Management and National CDD Project). The Education for All Fast track 
Program also exited in FY12. The ICR review conducted by IEG for the Cotton Project rated the 
outcome as moderately unsatisfactory due to the Quality at Entry program design issues. While 
the project contributed to setting the institutional framework for the sector, the principal 
objective of privatizing the cotton sector was not accomplished. The Malaria Booster Program 
closed in June 2011 with a satisfactory rating in both the development outcome and 
implementation progress. IEG gave a satisfactory rating for the quality of the ICR of the PRSC 
(IV to VI) completed in FY12.  However, it rated the outcome of the program as moderately 
unsatisfactory.  
V. Lessons Learned and Recommendations 
56. 
The lessons drawn from the review of the FY09-12 CAS and recommendations for the 
future CAS are summarized below. 
Broad-based political support is needed for successful CAS implementation.  Over 
57. 
the past decade political conflicts in Benin have made the approval of structural reforms difficult. 
Greater recognition of the political standoffs which seem to develop given Benin’s vibrant 
democracy should be highlighted in the CAS. 
58. 
An understanding of the political economy and dynamics of consensus-building and 
internal decision-making is important in formulating institutional reforms that affect governance.  
Difficulties with consensus building which were analyzed in the Country Economic Report 
issued in 2009 should help define future institutional reforms. 
59. 
The mix of policy-based operations and investment operations is an effective 
approach to country programming. Investment/technical assistance operations and policy 
reforms operations should be complementary to strengthen their impact.  
IDA should concentrate its assistance. Benin’s requirements are large. IDA should 
60. 
focus in the areas where it can present an effective package of support, where the Bank has a 
comparative advantage and has demonstrated its expertise in the past. 
61. 
Policy reforms require considerable technical support. This should be explicitly 
discussed in the CAS. Investment operations had a component of technical support at the sectoral 
level. In spite of considerable technical support from the EU and other donors, the public 
financial management action plan might have moved more quickly if additional technical 
assistance to help design/implement the reforms had been available. 
62. 
Coordination of donor programs increases efficiency of assistance. The reform 
agenda in the PRSCs was also supported by other donors. Donors coordinated their financial 
and non-financial assistance. The common donor approach to the SCRP helped bring about 
reforms.   

70 

 
 
63. Make CAS periods longer and allow flexibility in program.  Three years is too short a 
period to show meaningful results; in fact, CAS results are generally observed sometime after its 
completion. Also, it is difficult to carry out mid-term reviews with a three year time frame; a 
longer CAS period (say five years) would permit a mid-term evaluation. Experience in Benin 
shows the importance of building flexibility in the program to permit adjustments when 
unpredictable situations which affect outcomes occur.  
64. 
Define adequate indicators. Indicators for the CAS are an important element in judging 
the quality of the program, but their design and measurement continues to be difficult. The Benin 
CAS suggests the following: 
• Ensure that (i) the Government agrees with the indicators chosen; (ii) that these are made 
available by the sectoral ministries and (iii) are included in the SCRP monitoring tables.  
The monitoring system needs to be set up prior to approval of the CAS.  
• Use indicators that are already tracked at the time of the CAS;  
• Use indicators that are attributable to ongoing Bank-supported activities.

• Investment spending execution 
increased to 70 % (2012) from 56.3% 
(2006). 

Macroeconomic management has been broadly satisfactory.  While 
specific objectives were only partially achieved given exogenous factors 
such as world economic downturn and floods, the Government met its 
IMF targets; the decline in execution rates was linked to tighter 
expenditure management.  Government concentrated expenditures in 
priority social sectors  
Not achieved 

• Overall budget execution rate was 60.7% in 2010 (against 65.3% in 
2009 and 69.3% in 2008); 
• Execution rate for investment was 27.32% in 2010 and 24.2% in 2011 

Decline in part reflects tighter expenditure management to: i) respond to 
revenue shortfalls and ii) concentrate in priority expenditures. Social 
sectors (education; health; social dev.) increased as a % of total budget; 
budget execution for social sectors was 71.9% (against an average of 
75.6% in 2007-09).   

Low execution rate also reflects divergence between Parliament and 
Government on budget.  Parliament has approved large budgets which 
were not fully executed by Government to stay in line with macro 
objectives agreed with the IMF.

A Study commissioned under the Emergency Food Security Support 
Project (completed July 2010)led to a concrete action plan under the 
Emergency Support to Enhance Food Security Project to support the 
design of innovative and market based mechanisms for the sustainable 
delivery of agricultural inputs (fertilizers and others) to food crop farmers.  
The report is available (August 2011) and the pilot phase of the 
implementation of 
the new mechanism under 
the Agricultural 
Productivity and Diversification Project has reached an advanced stage. 
Assets of cotton producing company, SONAPRA, transferred to new 
public-private cotton ginning company SODEC0. SODECO continues to 
arrange for input distribution for cotton.  By October 2009, 51% of the 
new company’s assets were privately owned. But in April 2012, after 
allegations of mismanagement by AIC, the Government annulled the 
Accord Cadre defining respective Government and AIC roles in cotton 
sector and took over management of all activities for the ongoing 
2012/2013 cropping season and probably also for the forthcoming 
2013/2014 season.  Looking forward, the State intends to move to a zoned 
concession system and requested the Bank support for a workshop on 
December 18, 2012 that would examine experiences with zonal systems 
elsewhere in the region.

Drop caused by low domestic prices resulting in part from the 
appreciation of the euro and from low international prices (until 2011) 
and the appreciation of the euro and a serious flood in 2010. Also 
contributing to decline are marketing arrangements which, though 
changed, have not yet had an impact on sector efficiency.

The value of this indicator not available at national level 
 As a result of increased access to improved seeds and fertilizers under the 
Emergency Food Security Support Project, productivity of food crops 
(namely maize and rice) in project areas has increased. For example the 
average yield for rice increased from 2.97 tons /ha to 4.22 tons/ha. For 
maize, the average yield increased from 1.2 tons per ha to about 2 tons per 
ha.

SUMMARY OF CAS PROGRAM SELF-EVALUATION 

CAS Outcome and Outcome indicators 
(baselines and targets) 
• Joint framework for budget support in 
place and followed. 
• Program-based approaches: at least 
66% of Bank portfolio. 
•  Coordinated ESW/ AAA: at least 
66% of all Bank ESW/AAA 

Status and Evaluation Summary 

Lending and Non-lending Activities that 
Contributed to Outcome 

 Partly Achieved 

• A framework for budget support agreed to between the donors and the 
Government in a Memorandum of Understanding. The Memorandum 
being modified to strengthen it. 
• Project implementing agencies such as the Ministry of Agriculture not 
ready for programmatic approach 
• All ESW coordinated with other donors to ensure work complementary 
(e.g., Public Expenditure Reviews; Tertiary Education Study; Health 
Survey).

1.  Strengthening Competitiveness and Accelerating Private Sector-led Growth 
Stabilization of the Macroeconomic Framework 
• PRSC-linked actions play catalytic role; PRSC to focus on a few priorities 
• CAS should continue to have investment/TA projects that complement PRSC actions 
Strengthening Competitiveness and Revitalization of the Private Sector 
• Broad-based political support key for CAS implementation 
• PRSC actions critical to bring about change.  PRSCs did not focus on investment climate reform; sector operation focused on building support 
infrastructure and telecommunications reform 
Diversification of the economy 
• Project-related indicators should be linked to approved projects (programs) at time of CAS (approvals /effectiveness often delayed). 
• Indicator should be directly attributable to activities in Bank program 
Telecommunications:  Promote growth-inducing infrastructure 
• Broad support needed for difficult reforms to be carried out. 
Energy infrastructure : Promote growth-inducing infrastructure 
• Indicators to be linked to ongoing projects at time of CAS. 
• Indicators should be readily available at time of CAS 
• Regional program generally on target with objectives; consensus required helps in definition and execution of programs. 
• Donor collaboration helps expedite reforms.  
2.  Improving Access to Basic Services & Ensuring Greater Efficiency of Public Expenditures 
Leveraging Environmental and Urban Sanitation Improvements 
• Decentralized activities effective  
• Indicator should be tracked at time of CAS 
Rural and Urban Water Supply 
• Decentralization proved effective approach and should be pursued in next CAS 
Promotion of development-oriented education 
• A robust link must exist in the progress of the completion rates (CR) and the actions taken to reduce high repetition rates and especially dropouts.  
• CR not an appropriate indicator as significant progress in the CR cannot be achieved in the short term in the context of Benin. 
• Indicators should be directly attributable to activities in Bank program or TF supervised by the Bank. 
Improving Accessibility and Quality of Health, Nutrition services 
• Ensure donor coordination for success
