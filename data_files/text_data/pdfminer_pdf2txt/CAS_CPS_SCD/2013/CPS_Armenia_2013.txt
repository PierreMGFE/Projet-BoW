Country Partnership Strategy (2014-2017)

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

1. 
This Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for Armenia aims to support the Government's
vision for boosting shared prosperity and reducing poverty through accelerated economic growth
and job creation. The CPS sets out how the World Bank Group (WBG) will support Armenia in
implementing the Armenia Development Strategy 2025 (ADS), which aims at tripling per capita income
to $10,000 by 2025 with the goals of lifting over 800,000 people net out of poverty, thereby reducing
poverty incidence from 35 percent of the population in 2011 to 13 percent in 2025; and eradicating
extreme poverty which affected 3.7 percent of the population in 2011.

2. 
Before the 2009 global financial crisis, the Armenian economy grew by about 12 percent per
annum. This high growth performance resulted in improvement of the per capita income from $680
in 2001 to $3,340 in 2008.1 However, this was generated through an unsustainable economic model
narrowly based on expansion of residential construction, domestic services, and foreign exchange
inflows. Fueled by remittances, the construction sector expanded 5.2 times between 2001 and 2008 and
dominated the economy with 25 percent share in GDP. During the same period, the share of
manufacturing declined from 17 percent to 9 percent of GDP; large remittance inflows and appreciation
of the national currency rendered domestic tradables uncompetitive and left the economy highly
vulnerable to external shocks. As the global economy went into recession and external financing of the
domestic construction sector was interrupted, the sector collapsed by 48 percent, contributing to almost 11
percentage points of the total 14.1 percent economic contraction in 2009. The Armenian economy started
recovering in 2010. Real GDP expanded by 2.4 percent in 2010, 4.7 percent in 2011 and 7.2 percent in
2012 buoyed by high prices for base metals and high agricultural output.

3. 
Armenia also had an impressive success in bringing down poverty and ensuring that the less
well-off benefitted from economic expansion. Between 2001 and 2008, the share of population living
below the national poverty line dropped from over 50 percent to 27.8 percent, as a result of impressive job
creation in the construction industry and effective social protection programs. At the same time, the
growth rate of consumption per capita of the bottom 40 percent - an indicator of shared prosperity -
outpaced that for the overall population, demonstrating that economic growth benefited the poor and
vulnerable more than proportionally. However, just two years after the crisis, about a third of poverty
reduction achieved in the preceding decade (1999 to 2008) was reversed. Poverty incidence rose again to
35.8 percent in 2010 and declined slightly to 35 percent in 2011; the rate of extreme poverty as measured
by the percentage of the population living below the food poverty line doubled to 3.7 percent.

4. 
To date, as the economy recovers, the Government's goal is to create favorable conditions
for a different, more sustainable pattern of economic growth and poverty reduction. The ADS
projects a strong economic growth in excess of 6.4 percent per year, assuming high investment inflows
and substantial productivity increase. It also forecasts a steady decline of the poverty rate by 0.8
percentage points every year. These goals are ambitious but feasible taking into account Armenia's track
record. To achieve them, the ADS mainstreams employment expansion as the key engine for improving
living standards and reducing poverty, and sets this as the main priority for the next five years. The ADS
also emphasizes enhancing human capital, improving social protection, and modernizing public
administration and governance.

5. 
Recent analytical work carried out by the WBG suggests that Armenia's new drivers of
growth will have to be industry (especially manufacturing) and modern services competing in
international markets where high quality, decently paid jobs can be created. But as Armenia transits to
this new model, likewise, agriculture needs continued support as the main livelihood of the 36 percent of
the population residing in rural areas, and the source of employment to more than 40 percent of the
country's active population, including 75 percent in rural areas. Higher productivity in these sectors
means higher growth, shared prosperity, and faster poverty reduction in both urban and rural areas.
Employment and wage increases in Armenia played a central role in bringing about poverty reduction as
well as stimulating growth during 
the past decade. However, Armenia still suffers from high
unemployment and low labor force participation, especially among women and youth. At 53 percent, its
employment-to-population ratio is below the European average of 60 percent. Simulations suggest that
increasing employment of Armenians to the European average could lift GDP by about 8 percent and
significantly contribute to poverty reduction.

6. 
Low levels of employment result from low job creation, low supply of workers with the
needed skills, and a mismatch of workers and jobs. Job creation is low because Armenia lacks a
critical mass of small, dynamic and job creating enterprises. On the demand side, many firms report that
inadequate skills constitute an important obstacle to hiring workers. This is particularly true among
enterprises that are more modem and innovative-that is, firms that invest in research and development,
introducing new products, or upgrading existing products. Creating employment in the modem economy
requires lower impediments to firm entry and business start-ups, improved business environment, more
robust competition, and an educational system that provides the skills required by employers.

7. 
Against this background, the CPS places private sector-led job creation at the center of the
WBG's response. Within this framework, there are two clusters of outcomes targeted (Figure 8), based
on where there is a clear line of sight between the Bank's support and its contribution to boosting shared
prosperity and reducing poverty:

(i) Supporting competitiveness and job creation. The CPS focus is on removing the most binding
constraints to private sector led sustainable growth through strengthening competitiveness which
in turn supports job creation and is expected to foster income growth of the bottom 40 percent of
the population. This is where the greatest leverage will come from the World Bank Group given
the key role that IFC plays in supporting private sector-led growth; and

(ii) Improving efficiency and targeting of social services. The CPS aims to consolidate development
progress achieved to date in areas where outcomes and results have been achieved in reducing
poverty and improving the impact of social services. These areas are social protection, education
and health where ownership and implementation capacity are already strong. The Bank will build
on its current portfolio with the focus on improving access by the bottom 40 percent of the
population.

8. 
Improving governance and anti-corruption (GAC) measures in public services is a cross
cutting theme. 
In Armenia, governance challenges deter private investment and hamper job creation,
while at the same time weaken the impact of public services. The focus area of the Bank's future work is
to consolidate public administration modernization through e-govemance application which would reduce
opportunities for corruption and improve access to services by the population. This would contribute to
creating an environment where public services can have greater impact, through being delivered in a more
efficient, cost-effective and sustainable manner. 
In addition, based on the findings of the gender
diagnostics, selected activities under the first two clusters include a focus on gender dimensions with the
goal of promoting women's economic and public participation.

iv

9. 
The IFC will continue to seek investment opportunities in the real and financial sectors,
building upon its portfolio across industries, and to deepen its advisory services operations in order to
improve the investment climate with a focus on the agribusiness sector, strengthen the financial sector,
and develop the market for investment in sustainable energy.

10. 
The 2013 World Development Report on Jobs and the 2013 IFC Jobs Study provided
valuable insights for this CPS. The principles for designing policies through the job lens, proposed by
these reports, are relevant for Armenia: (i) ensuring the policy fundamentals that are essential for both
growth and job creation, 
including macroeconomic stability, an enabling business environment,
investments in human capital, and the rule of law; (ii) designing sound labor policies that help translate
growth into employment opportunities and that are complemented by a broader approach to job creation
that looks beyond the labor market; and (iii) strategically identifying which jobs would do the most for
development, given the country context, and removing the obstacles that prevent the private sector from
creating more of those jobs. The CPS encompasses these principles.

11. 
The CPS has been prepared jointly by the IBRD and the IFC in an effort to work as one
World Bank to draw out synergies and catalyze higher volumes of private resources aimed at
supporting Armenia's development. Its implementation will include a new series of development policy
lending (DPL) and selected investment lending in areas where there is a clear line of sight between the
Bank's support and its impact on boosting shared prosperity and reducing poverty. The Bank's financial
support will comprise the remaining IDA-16 envelope for FY14 (projected at $84.5 million) and IBRD
lending of $599 million over FY14-17. Actual lending will depend on how government demand and
performance evolve in the course of the CPS period, and on IBRD's lending capacity and demand from
other borrowers. In addition, the IFC projects new commitments in the range of $160-190 million during
this period. This assistance will be supported by a far-reaching program of advisory services and trust
fund support. The CPS's four-year span takes into account the country's election cycle in order to provide
a mid-term opportunity to address potential government and policy changes that will be reflected in the
CPS Progress Report.

12. 
Overall, the outlook for Armenia is positive. The fiscal policy has switched from stimulus in
the aftermath of the 2009 crisis to consolidation in line with the recovery of the economy and the IMF
recommendations, while protecting and extending pro-poor spending. Monetary policy has adopted a
neutral stance in a low-inflation environment, and the Central Bank of Armenia is following its inflation
targeting regime, including through a flexible exchange rate policy. Low fiscal deficits and robust growth
would help reduce public debt, keeping the risk of debt distress low. Various risks could affect the
implementation of the CPS or reduce its impact. These include: (i) downside macroeconomic risks in case
of a new global economic downturn, which may have ripple effects on the demand for Armenia's exports
and the reduction of remittances and foreign investment flows; (ii) regional security risks relating to the
dispute with Azerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabakh and the stand-off between the international community
and Iran; (iii) potential policy slippages in implementing structural reforms if opposition to key measures
gains political support; and (iv) the risks of natural disasters and climate change, given Armenia's high
exposure 
to natural disasters and 
increased climate extremes. Without 
implementation of key
macroeconomic and sectoral reforms, fiscal consolidation would be difficult and could negatively affect
the new DPL series. Furthermore, in the event or occurrence of risks pertaining to natural disaster or
regional security, the CPS would exercise flexibility and adjust Bank lending to respond to emerging
priorities, shifting needs and policy changes.

V

I. COUNTRY CONTEXT

A. Political Context

1. 
The last CPS period (FYO9-13) was characterized by relative political stability, which is
likely to continue during the next CPS period (FY14-17), albeit with some risks. This stability is
reflected in both the continuity in office of the President of the Republic, who was reelected in the
February 2013 presidential elections, and the landslide victory of his Republican Party in the June 2012
parliamentary elections. Both elections were declared peaceful and in accordance with international
standards, as the Govermment strived to improve credibility of the electoral process, strengthen
mechanisms of voice and accountability, and improve governance.

2. 
However, the elections did not fully resolve the protracted tensions with the opposition.
Since 2002, Armenia had been governed by coalitions of the parties with the most votes in the
parliamentary elections. However, after the June 2012 elections, Prosperous Armenia, the second largest
political party did not take part in the formation of the new government, thereby aligning with the
parliamentary opposition. Moreover, the opposition rejected the official results of the presidential
elections, claiming irregularities, and staged mass protests across the country. This situation may weaken
the Government's ability to build the political consensus needed to back up its reformist agenda laid out
in the ADS. The ADS sets ambitious targets for eradicating extreme poverty, creating jobs to improve
living standards, deepening human capital, improving access to basic services, and modernizing public
administration and governance. The ADS was prepared through extensive social participation and
stakeholder consultations, which has enhanced its ownership base. However, its implementation will
require hard choices in public expenditures, governance reforms, and other policy trade-offs; and thus
there will be significant demands on the Government to develop a broad consensus on these choices.

3. 
The Regional security risks remain high due to the latent conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh
and closed borders with Azerbaijan and Turkey. The perception of risk in the South Caucasus remains
high, negatively impacting private and foreign investments. Closed borders continue to impose lost
economic opportunities for all sides and increase transport-related costs, which seriously limit already
landlocked Armenia's external connectivity, undermining its competitiveness. Moreover, the need to
maintain sizable defense expenditures imposes high opportunity costs in foregone investments in social
services and essential infrastructure. The Government is engaged with the Minsk Group of countries
under the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) in their efforts to assist the
parties in finding a peaceful solution to the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. However, repeated violations of
the cease-fire along the "Lines of contact" and the Armenian-Azerbaijani border raise the risks of conflict
escalation. Resolution of this conflict would ease Armenia's transit links, lower costs to trade, and enable
possible participation in regional transit and energy corridor developments. The geo-political stability of
the South Caucasus would also be greatly improved and the perception of investment risks reduced.

4. 
Deepening of relations with Russia, the European Union (EU) and its member states
provide Armenia with a political anchor, thereby countervailing the threats and tensions with its
neighboring countries. In September 2013, President Sargsyan announced that Armenia will join the
Russian-led Eurasian Customs Union (ECU). Prior to this announcement, the Govermment was engaged
in negotiating an Association Agreement (AA) and a Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Agreement
(DCFTA) with the EU. These agreements provide Armenia with a framework to raise standards,
strengthen competition, modernize across a wide range of activities, and access European markets. The
decision to join the ECU has put aside the possibility of signing the EU-DCFTA, thus adding a degree of
policy uncertainty, pending the establishment of a new legal framework of relations with the EU.

1

B. Recent Economic Developments

5. 
Armenia's remarkable growth in the 2000s was followed by a severe downturn during the
2009 global financial crisis and a moderate recovery since then. The crisis revealed weaknesses in the
growth model. Before the crisis, the Armenian economy grew by about 12 percent per annum on the basis
of an unsustainable economic model. Construction became the dominant sector of the economy with 25
percent share in GDP as a result of 5.2 times expansion in real terms between 2000 and 2008. The high
level of informality (40 percent of the sector's turnover and two-thirds of employment), high degree of
dependence on external financing, and inadequate taxation of the sector deepened the structural
imbalances and fueled pro-cyclical developments in the economy.

6. 
During the same period, the share of manufacturing declined from 17 percent to 9 percent
of GDP, and large remittance inflows and appreciation of the national currency rendered domestic
tradables uncompetitive and left the economy highly vulnerable to external shocks. As the global
economy went into recession in 2009, external financing of the domestic construction sector was
interrupted and the sector collapsed by 48 percent. It contributed to almost 11 percentage points of the
total 14.1 percent economic contraction in 2009. A sudden reduction of remittances and drop of external
demand for metallic minerals led to a deepening of the current account deficit from 6.4 percent of GDP in
2007 to about 16 percent of GDP in 2009. During the same period the fiscal deficit jumped from less than
2 percent of GDP to 7.6 percent resulting in a sharp increase of the external public debt - from 16 percent
to around 40 percent of GDP. The ongoing fiscal consolidation program brought the fiscal deficit back to
around 1.5 percent of GDP in 2012. However, the pace of current account adjustment is still slow.

7. 
The economy recovered after the 2009 contraction but started losing steam in the first half
of 2013. The GDP grew by 2.2 percent in 2010, picking up to 4.7 percent in 2011 and 7.2 percent in 2012.
Growth was driven by the mining sector with continuous double-digit growth rates (22.5 percent in 2011
and 14.5 percent in 2012) supported by high prices for base metals, and a strong recovery of agriculture
(after a 16 percent slump in 2010, it grew at 14 percent in 2011 and 8 percent in 2012) and a stabilization
of the construction sector, which grew by 0.5 percent in 2012 after declining by 12.5 percent in 2011
(Figure 1). However, preliminary data shows that growth is now expected to moderate around 4.2 percent
in 2013, with agriculture, trade, and services showing lower growth than in the previous year and
construction again declining. Growth of industrial production and exports remain relatively strong.

Recent 
inflation dynamics followed developments 
in agricultural production. When
agriculture contracted by 16.2 percent in real terms in 2010, inflation increased to double-digits in early
2011. Recovery of agriculture gradually brought prices down and inflation returned to the Central Bank of
Armenia's (CBA) target band (year-on-year CPI inflation of 4 percent ± 1.5 percent) in August of 2011.
Another good harvest in 2012 contributed to further downwards adjustment of prices, with CPI inflation
(year-on-year change of the monthly indicator) in negative terms throughout much of the year and
reaching 3.2 percent in December 2012. However, higher food, domestic gas, and electricity prices drove
headline inflation to 8.5 percent in July 2013 (Table 1.).

Strong growth of exports contributed to improving external balances. The average growth
rate of merchandise exports was 29 percent in US$ terms during 2010-2012, while imports grew by only

3

10 percent. The high growth of exports helped narrow the trade deficit from 24.1 percent of GDP in 2009
to 21.4 percent in 2012. After shrinking by 30 percent during the crisis, the remittances revived quickly to
a level about 10 percent above the 2009 level. Remittances helped ease pressures on the current account
which is gradually narrowing after reaching 15.8 percent of GDP in 2009. The strong growth of exports
and continuing recovery of remittances contributed to further improvement of the current account deficit,
which was reduced to 11.2 percent of GDP in 2012.

10. 
After pursuing a significant fiscal expansion during the crisis, the Government is focusing
on consolidating its fiscal accounts. The Government's crisis response policies substantially expanded
the fiscal deficit from 0.4 percent of GDP in 2008 to 7.6 percent of GDP in 2009. As a result, in just three
years, the public-debt-to-GDP ratio drastically increased. In 2012 it peaked at 43.9 percent, up from 16.4
percent at the end of 2008. To restore a sustainable fiscal path, the Government has embarked on a
significant consolidation effort, which helped reduce the overall fiscal deficit to 1.5 percent of GDP in
2012 (Figure 2). The authorities plan to further maintain this ratio near the debt-stabilizing level of 2
percent of GDP in the medium term. The fiscal consolidation was achieved mainly through expenditure
compression of 4.3 percent of GDP during 2010-12, by under-spending on capital, while priority social
spending was largely protected. Lending from multilateral and bilateral donors remained the key source
of deficit financing.

11. 
Public debt was only about 16 percent of GDP at end-2008, but reached 43.9 percent of
GDP at end-2012. It is expected to decline if fiscal consolidation is successful and economic growth
remains buoyant. The projected debt-to-GDP ratios remain higher than prior to the crisis, pointing to a
permanently lower resilience of the Armenian economy to exogenous shocks.

12. 
Monetary policy has followed the inflation targeting regime of the CBA. With inflation
decelerating to below the CBA's target band (year-on-year CPI inflation of 4 percent + 1.5 percent), the
policy interest rate was lowered by 50 basis points to 8 percent in September 2011. The rate remained
unchanged until August 2013, when the CBA increased it by 50 basis points to 8.5 percent, in order to
mitigate second round inflationary effects associated with the increase of gas and electricity prices.

C. Macroeconomic Outlook

13. 
GDP Growth is expected to converge to 5 percent from 2015 onward. Economic activity
slowed down in 2013, reflecting tighter fiscal policy and a softening in construction, agriculture, and
services. Higher utility prices will depress growth further, along with slower growth in the EU and

4

Russia. The medium-term recovery is predicated on strong reforms and pick-up of investment that would
boost industry and modern services. Manufacturing could be the major growth driver as the government's
industrial development strategy focuses on developing several manufacturing sectors for better export
performance. Over the medium term, the fiscal envelope is expected to expand by a return to trend of
capital spending, which could support growth and crowd in private investment.

14. 
The current account deficit is expected to improve by around 4 percentage points during
2013-2016, reaching its estimated sustainable position. This improvement is predicated on the
industrial development and export promotion policies which would lead to faster growth of tradable
sectors, continuing growth in remittance inflows, and higher FDI in the medium term linked to further
structural reforms. Growth of exports, particularly mining and food products should continue to be strong,
with support from a more flexible dram, gains in the Russian markets, greater air connectivity, and
infrastructure improvements. Imports are projected to increase more moderately.

15. 
Inflation is likely to remain around 6.3 percent in 2013-2014, reflecting the recent increase in
food and energy prices. However, moderation in growth and food prices will ease domestic pressures on
inflation which is expected to stabilize around the CBA's target band of 4 percent + 1.5 percent in 2015
onward as a result of a narrowing current account deficit. In this case, the CBA will bring down its
interest rate to adopt a neutral policy stance.

16. 
Fiscal consolidation, which was largely a result of reducing capital expenditure to a rather
low 
level, 
is not sustainable. Protection of social spending is important to alleviate poverty, but
continuous overlooking of capital spending may undermine growth prospects. It would also put additional
pressures on the state budget, when underfunding of rehabilitation of infrastructure leads to higher
maintenance costs. To balance the need for adequate capital funding with fiscal consolidation and pro-
poor stance, the government needs to continue reforms in public finance management to ensure efficiency
and higher value for money. In this connection, the government intends to introduce a new Public
Investment Appraisal System and to further extend the program budgeting principles through developing
a system of output indicators to the allocations for capital spending. For the first time since 2008, the
government envisages increasing public sector wages in 2014, together with reforms to wages scales and
performance pay. This would be a phased wage increase in line with fiscal sustainability and overall
macroeconomic stability.

17. 
The 2012 debt sustainability analysis (DSA) conducted jointly with the IMF identified a low
level of debt distress, even after taking into account the private sector debt burden. Armenia's public
sector debt is sustainable in light of the current size of the debt stock. Nevertheless, the rapid
accumulation of public debt since the onset of the global crisis calls for the pursuit of fiscal consolidation
over the medium term. Public external debt was only about 14 percent of GDP at the end of 2008, but
reached 39.5 percent of GDP in 2012, and is expected to decline if fiscal consolidation is successful and
economic growth remains buoyant. In September 2013, Armenia used the global demand for emerging-
market assets to sell its first-ever bonds worth $700 million. The seven-year debt offering sold at a yield
of 6.25 percent and carries a coupon of 6 percent. It marked Armenia's access to international capital
markets as an alternative source of financing, in view of its upcoming graduation from IDA and other
sources of concessional financing from IFIs.

18. 
The implications from Armenia's recent decision to join the Eurasian Customs Union
(ECU) are not yet fully clear. It has put aside the possibility that Armenia can sign the Association
Agreement and the DCFTA with the EU which had been envisaged for November 2013. Preparing for
Association Agreements with the EU provides countries with a strong anchor for policy and institutional
reforms and capacity building, 
through 
twining arrangements, 
legal approximation, 
regulatory
convergence, and market liberalization. It remains unclear how the ECU framework would impact

5

Armenia's reform momentum, external trade, and capital flows in the short to medium term. In any case,
joining the ECU will still have an emphasis on technical assistance and convergence in standards, and
will bring additional benefits. Most notably, Russia is making natural gas available to Armenia on the
basis of its domestic gas price adjusted for transport cost for a period of at least 5 years.

D. Poverty, Inequality, and Shared Prosperity

19. 
Poverty and inequality increased in the aftermath of the 2008/09 crisis. Using the national
poverty lines, poverty incidence rose from 27.6 percent of the population in 2008 to 34.1 percent in 2009,
35.8 percent in 2010, and moderated at 35 percent in 2011 (Figure 3).2 The situation worsened in the
rural areas where poverty increased from 27.5 percent in 2008 to 36 percent two years later, before
decreasing to 34.5 percent in 2011. The share of those living in extreme poverty (that is, below the food
poverty line) grew from 1.6 percent in 2008 to 3.7 percent in 2011. Poverty also became deeper and more
severe, with a poverty gap of 7.9 percent in 2011 (versus 5.1 percent in 2008) and poverty severity of 2.4
percent (versus 1.4 percent in 2008). Inequality as measured by the Gini coefficient increased on the basis
of both consumption (from 0.24 to 0.27) and income aggregates (from 0.34 to 0.37).

20. 
Female-headed households which represent 24 percent of total households also became
more vulnerable to poverty than male-headed households, in particular if they include young children.
In the aftermath of the crisis, 35.2 percent of female-headed and 34.3 percent of male headed households
were poor (compared with 30.4 percent and 26.6 percent in 2008, respectively). Poverty incidence
reached 47 percent among female headed households with at least one child under 6.

Cross country comparisons using the international poverty line of US$ 2.50 PPP per day
shows that Armenia has performed relatively well. Between 1998 and 2011, Armenia's poverty at the
international poverty line fell sharply from 70 percent to 30 percent in 2008 and then rose to close to 35
percent in the aftermath of the crisis (Figure 4). Comparing this performance with other CIS countries
shows that although Armenia performed better than Georgia and Tajikistan, poverty rates are still quite
high as compared to Belarus, Moldova, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan.

2 Based on analysis in the 2012 Social Snapshot and Poverty in Armenia produced by the NSS: In 2011, the general
and the extreme poverty lines per adult equivalent per month were estimated at AMD 36,158 (US$ 97.1) and AMD
21,306 (US$ 57.2), respectively. The general poverty line represents the amount of expenditure required to purchase
the typical food basket that provides 2,232 calories per day per capita and a minimal amount of non-food items.

Sharing prosperity, the bottom 40 percent in the distribution income of the population
enjoyed strong consumption growth, but were affected by the 2008 global crisis. The Bank's
indicator of shared prosperity, i.e., the growth rate of consumption per capita of the bottom 40 percent,
demonstrates that economic growth in Armenia benefitted the poor and vulnerable more than the overall
population (Figure 5). During 2006-2008, mean real consumption per capita of the bottom 40 percent
outpaced that of the population as a whole (6.5 percent versus 5.2 percent). The 2008 crisis eroded the
growth in average consumption enjoyed by the bottom 40 percent and the population overall. As a result,
cumulatively between 2006 and 2011, the consumption per capita of the bottom 40 percent grew at 0.4
percent per year while that of the population as a whole stagnated overall.

Unemployment and low education prevail among the poor and the bottom 40 percent more
generally. Those in the bottom 40 percent are more likely: (i) to be out of the labor force or unemployed;

7

(ii) to have less education; (iii) to live in urban areas outside the capital; (iv) to have larger households
with more children; and/or (v) to live in households headed by women. Their poverty profile shows a

similar pattern. In 2011, poverty incidence among households with no employed members was 41
percent, i.e. 21 percent higher than the national average. Households headed by individuals holding
university degrees had, on average, consumption levels that were 24 percent above the consumption
levels of households headed by individuals with lower education. Female-headed households are more
likely to be poor as compared to male-headed households (35.2 percent versus 34.3 percent). Households
with members who had migrated and returned from abroad enjoyed 18-23 percent higher consumption
than households with no migrants. Women are also more likely to be unemployed than men, with
unemployment rates of 22.3 percent and 17.5 percent in 2011, respectively. Only 55 percent of women
aged 15+ participate in the labor market, a figure 24 percentage points lower than for men in Armenia.

24. 
Armenia is on track to achieve most of its Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by 2015
(Table 2). The Government's 2012 progress report on meeting the MDGs showed significant gains in
eradicating extreme poverty; rapid fall of infant and maternal mortality; virtually full enrolment in
primary education, with higher ratio of girls to boys in primary and secondary education; and increased
proportion of population with access to safe water sources. However, sustained efforts will be necessary
in reducing the number of people living below the poverty line down to the pre-crisis levels, promoting
gender equality, and ensuring environmental sustainability. Achieving these targets by 2015 is at the core
of the Government's development strategy but might prove challenging in the current global economic
environment. Ahead of the post-2015 Global Development Goals, Armenia has adopted new national
development goals to be achieved under the ADS by 2025.

The overarching objective of this CPS is to support the Government's vision for boosting
shared prosperity and reducing poverty through accelerated economic growth and job creation.
The main binding constraints to achieving these goals are poor labor market outcomes, notably high

8

unemployment and low-paid employment, insufficient coverage and targeting of the social protection
systems, and insufficient investment and firm creation that would spur competitiveness and growth. The
severe underutilization of labor translates into lack of opportunities, notably for the bottom 40 percent of
the population, whose households has fewer people employed and lower earnings. Reversing this trend
requires policies that promote equality of opportunities and create an enabling environment for private
sector-led job creation.

26. 
Low labor force participation, which disproportionally affects women, results from few
jobs, a skills mismatch, and an underdeveloped job matching system. Relatively few persons of
working age are employed, and many of those who are employed have low-productivity jobs. At 53
percent, Armenia's employment-to-population ratio is below the European average of 60 percent.
Increasing employment to European average would require creating an additional 166,000 jobs; which in
turn could lift GDP by about 8 percent.4

27. 

Low-productivity employments do not pay enough to lift people out of poverty. Women are
particularly affected, given that they earn on average approximately 40 percent less than men. Agriculture
employs over nearly 40 percent of workers but accounts for only 17 percent of GDP. Agricultural jobs are
of low-productivity. One in five agricultural workers is poor. Although, the poverty rate among workers
employed in industry is only marginally lower (18.5 percent), industry is, in general, more productive
than agriculture and thus generates higher earnings. Improvements in agricultural productivity and the
gradual reallocation of jobs from agriculture to higher value-added activities, notably in manufacturing
and modem services, are key to reducing poverty and improving the living standards of the bottom 40
percent of the population.

28. 
Many of the unemployed have low skills, lacking the technical, occupation-specific skills
demanded by employers. Many firms report that inadequate skills constitute an important obstacle to
doing business. Individuals with general secondary education - with no technical skills - represent the
largest fraction of unemployed workers. But many unemployed do possess technical, occupation-specific
skills. For these workers, the challenge then is securing jobs that match their skills. Highly educated
workers face a lower risk of unemployment, earn higher wages, and thus, are less likely to be poor. The
challenge for the educational system is to identify skills that are required by employers. Moreover, few
unemployed use public employment services, but still fewer employers post job vacancies.

29. 
High unemployment significantly reduces social welfare, impeding poverty reduction and
shared prosperity goals. In 2011, poverty incidence among households with no employed members was
41 percent, i.e. 21 percent higher than the national average. Unemployment is pervasive. The augmented
unemployment rate, which takes into account persons of working age who are available for work, but are
not actively looking for jobs, is about 30 percent. Unemployment is particularly high among youth; it
affects over 38 percent of persons aged 20-24, and the augmented unemployment rate in this category
reaches 49 percent. According to international experience, the youth unemployment rate is about twice as
high as the total unemployment rate, and Armenia is no exception. The high youth unemployment rate
reflects the difficulty of school-to-work transition and of entry into the labor market, and the likelihood
that young workers change jobs more frequently than older workers. Gender differences in labor force
participation and unemployment represent a broader set of gender inequalities on other dimensions (Box
1).

4 This estimate assumes that the labor's share of national income is 60 percent and that the productivity of newly
created jobs is the same as that of existing jobs. As such, it is likely to provide a lower-bound estimate of the income
gain because newly created jobs tend to be more productive than existing ones.

9

Box 1. Key Gender Issues

Over the past decade Armenia has made progress in many gender-related aspects, notably in ensuring
equal access to basic social services. Overall education and health outcomes show little or no gender gaps.
Gender disparities remain, however, in endowments, access to economic opportunities, and women's voice and
representation. The labor market displays the most notable gender inequalities. Only 55 percent of working age
women are in the labor force, compared to nearly 80 percent of working age men in the labor force. The overall
high unemployment rate in Armenia also masks a gender difference, with 17.5 percent of men and 22 percent of
women unemployed. Among those working for pay, women's average monthly earnings are only 60 percent of
men's. More effort remains to be made to improve women participation in the labor force and thereby raising
their economic levels.

Demographic patterns also reflect gender inequalities. In the population as a whole there are more women
than men, reflecting higher female life expectancy and greater outmigration by working age men. Reflecting
these patterns, nearly 40 percent of households are headed by women. Among children, unlike adults, boys
outnumber girls. Between 2006 and 2012, about 115 boys were born against 100 girls. This is unusual since in
most parts of the world roughly equal numbers of boys and girls are bom keeping the sex ratio at birth close to
100. Research suggests that this unbalanced sex ratio at birth reflects a preference for sons over daughters.

Institutional structures supporting gender equality exist but need further strengthening. In February 2010,
the Government adopted a Gender Policy Strategic Action Plan for 2011-15 which aims to promote gender
equality; safeguard equal conditions and opportunities for men and women; ensure their equal participation in
all aspects of social life; eliminate gender-based discrimination; and protect against gender-based violence.
Implementation of this policy remains the challenge. In 2012, the Government introduced gender councils in all
regional and municipal administrations, and the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs developed criteria and
guidelines for introducing gender-disaggregated monitoring system in the public sector. A more comprehensive
system to advance gender equality will be instituted and a wider dialogue will emerge about gender equality in
all spheres, including education, health, labor markets and institutions. In addition, a recent study highlights the
need for strengthening civil society organizations working on gender equality and women's rights.

30. 
Armenia needs to foster job creation, particularly in the formal sector of the economy.
However, the pace of job creation in the formal sector is slow and has not kept pace with the growth of
the working age population, leading to growing unemployment and a decline in the already low
employment rate. Sustained economic growth prior to the global financial crisis did not produce a
sufficient number of new jobs; instead, gains in labor productivity led to rising wages. The construction
boom prior to the crisis translated into employment growth, but proved unsustainable. To date, Armenia
lacks a critical mass of small, dynamic and job creating enterprises. New, small firms led job-creation in
the years ahead of the crisis, according to the Business Environment and Enterprise Performance Survey
(BEEPS) data. As new business registration fell in 2008 and 2009, job creation in Armenia has become
more challenging.

31. 
The model that produced growth and poverty reduction prior to the 2009 crisis was
unsustainable. Looking ahead, growth must be broader based and led by tradable sectors capable of
creating jobs for the large number of-mostly young-unemployed Armenians. New drivers of growth
will have to be industry and modem services competing in international markets, coupled with
productivity increase in agriculture. Within industry, manufacturing is the most likely sector to create
employment. Labor productivity is significantly higher in manufacturing than in, for example, agriculture,
and its production technology is much more labor intensive than that of heavy industry and modem
services. Manufacturing is therefore rightly targeted in the ADS as the sector in which high quality,
decently paid jobs will be created. Likewise, agriculture is targeted as a means for improving living
conditions in rural areas. With 36 percent of the population residing in rural areas, agriculture is the main
livelihood of rural communities. It provided employment to more than 40 percent of the country's active
population, including 75 percent in rural areas. Higher productivity in this context means higher growth

10

and faster poverty reduction in both urban and rural areas. While manufacturing and services will strive to
absorb the excess labor in rural areas, agricultural will need continued support to increase productivity.
Across these sectors, a tremendous amount of mobility needs to take place to transit workers from low-
pay and low-productivity jobs to high-pay and high-productivity ones.

32. 
Fighting corruption in public administration is another development challenge. This battle
entails tackling the lax practices in tax and customs administrations and the inadequate enforcement of
conflict of interest regulations. The challenge also is to address issues of market dominance and its abuse
in all markets, including those in which oligopolistic structures might prevail. This undermines the
capacity to share prosperity. For Armenia to tap its significant investment and growth potential, breaking
the nexus among oligopolistic control, low tax collection, and lack of competition is central. Conflicts of
interest also hinder competition. Close connections between large firm groups and elected officials pose
challenges to the management of conflicts of interest.

33. 
The 2013 Country Economic Memorandum on Growth 
(Armenia: Accumulation,
Competition, and Connectivity) suggested a combination of four factors to boost job creation. First,
higher investment and better financial intermediation between savers and investors. Second, better
utilization of the labor force, including women, the youth and the largely untapped resource of Armenians
abroad. Third, stronger competitive pressures in the markets for goods and services, which will improve
incentives for companies to innovate, adopt new technologies, and become more efficient. Fourth,
enhanced connections of the landlocked Armenian economy with world markets, including through land,
air, and through internet and communication technologies.

34. 
Fiscal space will be more limited going forward; but social programs need to be protected
and strengthened. The Government responded to the economic crisis by a large fiscal stimulus, which
increased nominal public spending by 13 percent in 2009 to stimulate the domestic economy and to
protect the poor. Despite reduced fiscal revenues, the Government succeeded in protecting its priority
social spending programs such as pensions, the Family Benefit Program (FBP), education and health
expenditures. The protection of public spending on these programs, as well as improved targeting of FBP,
helped avoid worse poverty outcomes. The programs proved to be effective instruments to address
poverty and played a more enhanced role in the aftermath of the crisis (Figure 6). This is evident from
what the levels of poverty would have been in the simulated absence of these transfers before and during
the crisis. In 2008, before the impact of the crisis was felt, poverty incidence would have been 43 percent
without both FBP and pensions, as opposed to the actual 27.6 percent. In 2011, on the other hand, poverty
would have gone from the actual 35 percent to over 53.2 percent in the absence of these social protection
transfers.

35. 
Despite the positive steps taken to protect environmental and natural resources over the
past decade, environmental management remains a concern in Armenia. Multiple problems with
respect to air, water, soil pollution, and threatened ecosystems have kept the environment in a critical
state, thus impeding economic growth, increasing the threats to livelihoods, and contributing to the
vulnerability of the population. Despite efforts to strengthen the institutional response to environmental
issues and build capacity through the Ministry of Environment, there remain legislative and policy gaps,
poor or nonexistent enforcement systems, and major investment needs in the sector.

36. 
Climate change poses great development challenges to Armenia because it is inextricably
linked to economic growth, poverty reduction, and environmental sustainability (Box 2). Over recent
decades, Armenia's climate has changed with average higher temperatures and lower precipitation, as
well as more frequent extreme events including droughts, floods, and cyclones. The Government's
strategy is to improve and strengthen climate resiliency of the sectors most affected by climate change. In
this connection, the Authorities assessed the socioeconomic impacts of climate change with regard to
agriculture, energy, and forestry; and developed policy recommendations and measures with UNDP
support. Major challenges remain, however, to promote the best available climate adaptation and
mitigation policy measures, and build institutional capacity for their implementation.

Box 2. Climate Change Vulnerabilities
The adverse impacts of climate change are expected to worsen in the future. As a result, the challenges to
agriculture will become more acute. According to the national climate scenarios forecast, over the next century,
Armenia's average annual temperature will increase by 4.5' C in the lowlands and 7' C in the highlands.
Average annual precipitation is expected to decrease by as much as 9 percent. The biggest reductions are
predicted for Yerevan and the Ararat Valley, which can expect 30 percent less precipitation by 2100. Higher
temperatures will lead to more evaporation, which means less soil moisture and drops in rivers flow by as much
as 24 percent. These losses will reduce the availability of water for agriculture and power generation. In turn,
most crop yields will be lower; livestock will experience increased heat stress; and conflicts over increasingly
limited water resources will increase. Given their limited ability to adapt to climate changes and the existing
adaptation deficit, the rural poor will be the most vulnerable. Climate change impacts thus threaten to undermine
the progress that has been made in reducing poverty by aggravating food insecurity and slowing economic
growth in vulnerable areas.

II. GOVERNMENT'S VISION

A. Armenia Development Strategy

37. 
Armenia's long-term development vision is articulated in the Armenia Development
Strategy 2025. This vision sees Armenia as a middle-income country achieving a per capita income in
excess of US$10,000 by 2025 (i.e. three times higher than its 2012 level). It projects an ambitious annual
GDP growth rate of 6.4 percent and mainstreams employment creation as the key engine for improving
living standard and reducing poverty, and the main priority for the next five years.

38. 
The ADS 
is built around four pillars: creating jobs, developing human capital,
strengthening social protection system, and modernizing public administration and governance.
The priorities for each pillar are as follows:
* Employment expansion through high-productivity and decently paid jobs.
* Enhancement of human capital through better access to quality services, including healthcare,
education, culture, and basic infrastructure.
Improvement of social protection through higher efficiency, including improved targeting, of
existing systems to ensure financial sustainability.

* 

12

* Modernization of public administration and governance, through increased efficiency of the state,
improved quality of and access to public services, increased transparency of decision-making and
accountability of public spending, and fight against corruption.

* 

39. 
The ADS specifies a set of policies 
to achieve the overarching objectives. Different
instruments of monetary, fiscal and social policies will be channeled to address the employment
expansion objective. This will be achieved through ongoing structural reforms with the following main
priorities:
* Stepping up both productivity increase and employment growth, specifically in export-oriented
activities, as the main drivers of economic growth.
Increasing external competitiveness, by improving the business climate, ensuring fair competition
and economic diversification.
* 
Improving access to credit, notably for SMEs, to diversify options for reducing unemployment.
* Making strategic reallocations in the structure of public spending aimed at enhancing human
capital creation and improving Armenia's skills base.
* Ensuring 
fiscal, social, and environmental 
sustainability 
through 
fiscal consolidation,
infrastructure maintenance, maintaining pro-poor spending and improving targeting of social
assistance, and environmental safeguards.

40. 
The Strategy is operational. It provides an annual breakdown of macro-fiscal projections for the
next five years (2013-2017) and more aggregated targets for main economic parameters up to 2025. To
further operationalize 
it, the Government prepared a more detailed Medium Term Expenditure
Framework (MTEF) for the first five-year phase, which aims at maintaining the debt-reducing level of
fiscal deficit below 2 percent of GDP and lowering the current account balance to 4.6 percent of GDP by
2017 (Table 3).

41. 
The ADS aims to develop a new and more sustainable growth path for the economy after
the setback of 2009. To meet its new growth targets, Armenia needs to enact policies to restore
headroom for macroeconomic policy maneuvering and, at the same time, to engineer a shift in the
economy toward tradable sectors. Fiscal policies aim to reduce the fiscal imbalance and anchor the public
debt around 37 percent of GDP from 2014 and thereafter; monetary policy to ensure low inflation; public
financial management reform to increase revenue collection, strengthen macroeconomic stability, and
improve public sector performance and service delivery; and financial sector reform to increase national
savings and access to finance. External sector policy focuses on increasing capital inflows to finance
growth and foreign reserve accumulation to buffer potential vulnerabilities. These measures would also
strengthen Armenia's capacity to access capital markets and diversify its sources of financing, given its
upcoming graduation from concessional financing from IDA and other international financial institutions.

13

42. 
Aggressive implementation of productivity enhancing structural reforms that help promote
private investment, SME development, competition and economic diversification would reinforce
macroeconomic measures, such as the needed fiscal consolidation. These policies would help maintain
investment around 28 percent of GDP over the medium-term, of which 15 percent would come from
Government and 85 percent from private investment. Such level of investment is necessary to achieve the
ADS's ambitious GDP growth targets which are projected 1.3 percentage points above the baseline trend.
The Government agreed that the path is challenging, but argues that setting such ambitious goals is
necessary to trigger more aggressive reforms in order to meet the country's development objectives
(Figure 7).

Armenia Development Strategy

43. 
The Strategy forecasts critical risks with the potential to change the projections at the basis
of the macro-economic scenario. These risks pertain to the global economic environment; the private
sector supply response to the improvements in Armenia's investment climate; the optimism of the growth
projections, which require pursuing a strong agenda of structural and sectoral reforms, the implementation
of which could be constrained by Armenia's weak institutional capacity and governance systems; and the
elasticity of poverty reduction to the proposed export-led growth strategy. The fiscal headroom will
remain low and this would limit the possibility of further counter-cyclical policies in case of new external
shocks.

B. Key Structural and Sectoral Issues

44. 
The ADS acknowledges that higher growth would require increased investment and total
factor productivity which, in turn, could only be achieved through structural reform. Accordingly,
the Strategy examines the constraints to growth and employment creation sector by sector; identifies
policy, legal, and institutional reforms for completion in the medium to long run; and proposes entry
points for short-term actions. It also identifies cross-cutting governance issues that adversely affect
growth and labor market outcomes, noting the need to fight corruption and improve the business climate.

(i) 

Fostering Competitiveness and Job Creation

45. 
To promote sustainable employment, the ADS identifies three cross-cutting issues and five
specific sectors to be targeted for direct policy interventions. The former includes macroeconomic
stability, international competitiveness, and business and investment climate. The latter consists of
industry and export promotion, tourism development, information and communication technology (ICT),
agriculture and rural development, SME development and access to finance. The Government's
employment strategy also contains measures that focus on labor market policies, institutions, and
regulations; education and skill development; and social protection. These reforms address constraints to
job creation and bottlenecks in skills formation and in the enabling regulatory environment. They are

14

expected to boost private sector-led growth and job creation. To complement these structural measures,
major investments are also required to upgrade Armenia's key infrastructure and transport networks.

46. 
SMEs are the main engine of growth and employment creation in Armenia. During 2008-
2011, they created over 100,000 jobs and accounted for about 40 percent of GDP. Under the ADS, the
Government plans to increase their value added to 60 percent of GDP by 2025. This will require pursuing
an ambitious reform agenda focusing on the improvement of the business environment, rules-based
regulatory and governance institutions, fair competition, improved legal and court systems, better access
to finance and skilled labor, and a range of reforms in specific sectors such as agriculture, utilities,
logistics, transport, and ICT. Support to women entrepreneurs will also be key.

(ii) Developing Human Capital

47. 
The ADS sets out appropriate goals for the health and education sectors. 
Improving
efficiency, equitable access, and quality of these services remain a priority and go well beyond the
objective of supporting growth. These are essential to equalize opportunities among various parts of the
population, reduce the potential of conflict and, ultimately, maintain an equitable society.

48. 
The ADS health objectives are threefold: (a) to improve health outcomes by reducing mortality
and morbidity, with a focus on the poorest segment of the population; (b) to protect households against
high out-of-pocket payments for health care, by ensuring that people do not face medical expenditures
that are either "impoverishing" to drive them below the poverty line, or unaffordable as a result of an
episode of ill health; and (c) to ensure efficient and fiscally sustainable service delivery. In addition, the
government will continue improving the financing mechanisms of medical care. In particular, the system
of co-payment financing introduced in 2011 will be further developed and deepened; the compensation
mechanisms for hospitals will be improved to make a gradual transition to more effective disease
management and financing; and their governance and accountability systems strengthened.

49. 
In education, the ADS objectives aim at developing relevant skills needed for economic
growth and job creation. The five-year sector development strategy adopted in July 2011 support
improvement in all levels of education. However, during the ADS's first-phase (2013-2017), efforts will
be focused on vocational training and higher education, which will be enhanced in accordance with the
provisions of Bologna and Turin Treaties which Armenia joined in 2005 and 2010, respectively. This will
help address the existing gaps between the education outcomes and skills requirement of Armenia's
evolving labor market.

(iii) Strengthening Social Protection System

50. 
Public spending on social protection and improved coverage and targeting of social safety
net programs will continue to play a key role in mitigating poverty and inequalities. In response to
widespread vulnerability as a result of the global economic crisis, coverage and targeting for the Family
Benefit Program (FBP), Armenia's flagship social assistance program, and other social safety net
programs, as well as the implementation of the mandatory funded pension system introduced in 2012 will
remain the focus of Government's interventions under the ADS.

51. 
A key feature of these programs will be a gradual transition from the provision of
predominantly monetary assistance to the delivery of more comprehensive social services packages
based on beneficiaries' needs, designed to target better the bottom 40 percent, expand their capacities
and opportunities while promoting greater inclusion in the labor market. In addition, given the
multiplicity of social protection services offered, the government aims to provide integrated delivery of

15

services by introducing new social case management practices. Independently operating public
employment, pension, and social assistance agencies will be integrated and underpinned by one-stop-shop
approach. The government began piloting three integrated social services (ISS) centers in 2013. By 2017,
all of the country's 54 social services access points are expected to operate as integrated centers.

(iv) Modernizing Public Administration and Governance

52. 
Under the ADS, the Government plans to modernize and enhance productivity of public
services through reforms on three tracks: (a) fighting corruption and conflict of interest in the public
sector; (b) reforming and rightsizing the civil service, introducing merit-based systems of recruitment and
promotion, increasing salaries and incentives, streamlining the redundant regulations of the public
administration through the regulatory "guillotine" exercise; and (c) modernizing the custom and tax
administration, the financial inspection/supervision system, the Public Finance Management (PFM)
system, and the judiciary system. Progress will be monitored through a cluster of six indicators for
assessing public administration developed by the World Bank and widely used for international
comparisons. The targeted values under the first phase of the ADS, to be met by 2017, are equal to the
average indicators for Eastern European and Baltic States in 2010 (Table 4).

53. 
The Government is committed to revamp its anti-corruption policy and institutional
framework which has been in place since 2003 and was updated in 2009. This update intended to
build on the results and organizational framework established under the 2003-2007 strategy and action
plan, which comprised an Anti-Corruption Council and an Anti-Corruption Strategy Implementation
Monitoring Commission. However, engagement of civil society was very limited. Sufficient resources
were not allocated to support the new action plan; and, without clearly defined responsibilities and
functions, it was not fully owned across ministries, and by lawmakers and the public at large. As a result,
there has been poor accountability of its implementation and lack of clearly defined responsibility for
results.

54. 
The Government is determined to improve its revenue performance. At approximately 22
percent (including social security payments), Armenia's tax-to-GDP ratio in 2012 was lower than those of
most ECA countries at comparable income levels. Armenia's tax productivity-defined as the ratio of tax
collected to GDP divided by the statutory rates- has been below regional averages even during periods of
high growth. This lower ratio is the result of narrow tax bases with numerous tax exemptions and weak
capacity to detect and penalize tax frauds. Moreover, compliance costs for taxpayers remain high which
have negative implications on private sector development in the formal sector. Under the ADS, the
Government plans to improve tax administration and step up revenue collection by 0.3-0.4 percentage
points of GDP annually in order to raise the tax/GDP ratio up to 23.7 percent by 2017, 25 percent by
2021, and 25.3 percent by 2025.

55. 
The Government will accelerate the implementation of its 2010-2015 PFM reform strategy.
This strategy identified three major phases for advancing PFM reforms in the medium term. During the

16

first phase, the strategy prioritized acceleration of reforms in the lagging areas of the downstream PFM
elements: internal control, internal audit, and fiduciary control. The strategy then envisaged further
deepening the policy orientation of budgeting and advancing public sector accounting reforms. It further
suggested integrated management of the PFM system under the Government Financial Management
Information System (GFMIS) umbrella. Implementation of the strategy will be accelerated in line with
identified priorities and sequence. A separate strategic development plan is currently being implemented
by the Chamber of Control with a view to transform it into a modem and professional external audit body
of the public sector.

III. WORLD BANK GROUP PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY

A. Lessons Learned from Previous CPS and Stakeholder Feedback

Lessons from the CPS Completion Report 5

56. 
Overall, the WBG was successful in helping Armenia weather the impact of the 2009 global
crisis and position itself for sustained growth. Robust growth in 2012, prudent monetary policies,
subdued inflation, ongoing fiscal consolidation, and a sustainable public debt allow a cautiously
optimistic medium-term outlook. The impact of the crisis on the poor was well managed. The poverty
level would have been much higher had the government not sustained the targeted social spending in the
scarce state budget. CPS-supported measures strengthened governance and PFM, enhanced the
transparency and accountability of the public sector, and improved the performance of the judicial system.
Significant progress was made towards four other key goals of the CPS program: (i) fostering the e-
economy and technological progress; (ii) supporting competition and private sector development; (iii)
improving road, energy, irrigation, and water infrastructure; and (iv) human capital development.

57. 
The CPS design should be flexible enough to enable timely adjustments to evolving country
needs and changing economic environment. Indeed, the design of the CPS FYO9-13 reflected country
reality at the time it was written in the midst of the 2009 global economic crisis. Appropriately, the CPS
focused on addressing vulnerability and mitigating the adverse poverty effects of the crisis, and
strengthening the foundations for medium-term competitiveness and growth. Over the course of its
implementation, the country and global economic environment changed and the program adequately
adapted to those changes. The mid-term CPS Progress Report extended by one year the original FYO9-12
CPS duration to align with Armenia's political cycle; updated the outcome targets on the basis of progress
made so far, evolving country circumstances, and feedback from the Government and other stakeholders;
and increased proposed WBG financing and advisory services. The Progress Report also dropped 31 of
the 65 original CPS result indicators and added 15 new ones for a total of 49.

58. 
Well focused projects enable more efficient implementation and more effective delivery of
results. Virtually all the investment projects financed by the Bank had a well-defined focus geared to
specific results on the ground. This helped overcome inherent coordination problems among line
ministries and increased flexibility when responding to needs and implementation constraints. The use of
additional financing helped scale up engagement in success areas. Ten Additional Financings represented
38.5 percent of the 26 operations approved by the Board during FY09-13. This lesson will be applied in
the new CPS, which would consider additional financing or follow-up of successful projects that are
aligned with its priorities.

5 The draft Completion Report on the CPS FY09-13 is provided in Annex 2.

17

59. 
A strengthened focus on institutional capacity building and a better selectivity of
performance indicators will drive the new partnership with Armenia. Capacity constraints are
identified more clearly and will be mainstreamed in the country program. Informed by upfront
institutional assessments, extensive recourse to IDF/TF support for capacity building and technical
assistance, and just-in-time AAA will help accelerate the implementation of the program and achievement
of results. The new CPS also benefitted from more realistic assessment of outcome indicators, excluding
indicators not entirely attributable to the Bank-supported program which may otherwise prove difficult to
achieve and may overstate the role and impact of the Bank on progress towards country goals.

60. 
Learning from experience, the Bank should step-up its role in fostering consensus on
reforms. Inevitable political tensions and distrust of Government can be mitigated by information and
communication with stakeholders. The use of policy seminars with senior government officials, public
workshops, dissemination of analytical work through Internet and the media, consultation of project
beneficiaries, information of the Parliament, disclosure of Bank operations are some of the tools used
effectively in Armenia to mitigate in part political and program implementation risks.

Feedback from the Stakeholder Survey

61. 
A Stakeholder Survey was carried out in November 2012 to complement the WBG's self-
assessed Completion Report on the CPS FY09-13. This survey captured the view of 213 respondents.
Its findings support several conclusions from the CPS Completion Report. Respondents noted that
economic growth and education were the country's foremost development priorities, and the Bank's role
had been determinant in these areas. Governance and anti-corruption, private sector development, and job
creation were also considered important; however respondents noted that the WBG track record in these
areas had been below expectations. Lending, technical assistance, and knowledge services were seen as
the WBG's greatest strength, but the speed of processing its operations as its greatest weakness. More
than a quarter of respondents believed that the Bank should offer more innovative knowledge services.
This was as important to respondents as reducing the complexity of lending procedures. Nearly a third of
respondents reported that one of the main reasons for policy failure or slippages were due to inadequate
level of citizen participation. They indicated a need for listening to citizens, increasing stakeholder
participation and outreach, and providing knowledge and advice, as being central to doing development
better.

B. Current World Bank Group Program

62. 
The World Bank's active portfolio in Armenia consists of 14 operations with a total
commitment of US$ 445.4 million, of which US$ 210.9 were undisbursed as of September 3, 2013.
Disbursement remains satisfactory with a disbursement ratio at 32 percent as of end FY2013. Annex B.2
provides an overview of the current portfolio. It includes five investment lending operations 
in
infrastructure (transport, electricity, water, and irrigation), four in social sectors (health, education, social
protection, and social investment 
fund), 
three 
in public sector (judicial reform, public sector
modernization, and 
tax administration), and 
two in sources of growth 
(ICT and agriculture).
Implementation of all Bank projects is satisfactory and there is no project at risk. A Country Portfolio
Performance Review (CPPR) was carried out in June 2013 to assess the portfolio performance and
identify cross-cutting and project-specific issues affecting implementation.

63. 
Knowledge services will continue to inform investments and policy dialogue and provide the
analytical underpinning of future lending under the CPS. Ongoing programmatic works support the
policy dialogue on debt and fiscal consolidation, poverty and gender, social protection, and financial
sector stability. The 2012 Joint Bank-IMF Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) underpins the

18

ongoing financial sector development strategy. Strategic works are also in progress on education sector,
with a view to defining the priorities for public policy to support innovation and skill development; and
on environment, with a focus on mainstreaming environmental sustainability in the mining sector. In
addition, an approach to gender-informed projects is mainstreamed through Portfolio Gender Reviews.
Moreover, an active program of TF operations totaling US$ 18.2 million is co-financing ongoing projects
as well as providing sector diagnoses and strategies that underpin the Bank's dialogue and possible
interventions (Annex 4).

64. 
Building on the successful expansion of IFC's investment activities during the previous CPS
period, the IFC's committed investment portfolio as of the end of FY13 stood at US$ 146.5 million
in 29 projects with 12 clients. IFC operations in the financial sector include provision of short-term
liquidity (such as trade finance), risk management products, and advisory services to help banks better
manage portfolios and non-performing loans. IFC provides financial and advisory support to banks to
extend access to finance to micro, small and medium-sized businesses and for investment in sustainable
energy. IFC is engaged in the development of housing finance in the longer term through advisory and
investment services. IFC supports creditworthy and transparent investment clients in sectors that can
contribute to sustainable 
long term growth and economic diversification, for example in mining,
agribusiness, and real estate. IFC also contributes to the country's economic competitiveness through
advisory work to improve the investment climate and decrease the costs of doing business, with a
particular focus on the agribusiness sector

C. Indicative Program of Support FY2014-2017

65. 
In line with the WBG's twin goals, the new CPS for Armenia supports the Government's
over-arching objective of job creation. Within this framework, there are two clusters of outcomes
targeted (Figure 8), based on where there is a clear line of sight between the Bank's support and its
contribution towards boosting shared prosperity and reducing poverty:

(i) Supporting competitiveness and job creation. The CPS focus is on removing the most binding
constraints to private sector led sustainable growth through strengthening competitiveness which in
turn supports job creation. In Armenia, employment creation is expected to foster income growth of
the bottom 40 percent of the population. This is where the greatest leverage will come from the
World Bank Group given the key role that IFC plays in supporting private sector-led growth; and

(ii) Improving efficiency and targeting of social services. The CPS aims to consolidate development
progress to date in areas where outcomes and results have been achieved in reducing poverty and
improving the impact of social services. These areas are social protection, education and health
where ownership and implementation capacity are already strong. The Bank will build on its current
portfolio with the focus on improving access by the bottom 40 percent of the population.

66. 
Improving governance and anti-corruption (GAC) measures in public services is a cross
cutting theme. 
In Armenia, governance challenges deter private investment and hamper job creation,
while at the same time weaken the impact of public services. The focus area of the Bank's future work is
to consolidate public administration modernization through e-governance applications which would
reduce opportunities for corruption and improve access to services by the population. This would
contribute to creating an environment where public services can have greater impact, through being
delivered in a more efficient, cost-effective and sustainable manner. In addition, based on the findings of
the gender diagnostics, selected activities under the first two clusters include a focus on gender
dimensions with the goal of promoting women's economic and public participation.

19

67. 

The CPS exercises selectivity in three fundamental ways:

(i) Concentrating the focus and prioritizing resources of the new lending program on the first
cluster of outcomes - supporting competitiveness and job creation - which will also
maximize the synergies between the Bank and IFC. The line-of-sight objective is to address
the most binding constraints to private sector-led growth through strengthening competitiveness,
facilitating investment and the creation of new firms, which in turn will increase economic
opportunities and foster income growth of the bottom 40 percent of the population. Over 83
percent of the WBG indicative new lending program will target these outcomes.

(ii) Consolidating the progress achieved to date by the Bank's program on the second cluster of
outcomes - improving the impact of social services. The line-of-sight objective is to continue
targeting the well-being of the bottom 40 percent through improving health and education
outcomes and continue strengthening the social protection system which has played an important
role in mitigating poverty.

(iii) Eight out of 12 operations are either additional financing or repeaters of ongoing projects
which have achieved good results to date and where ownership and capacity are strong.
These operations are encompassed in the two clusters where the Bank will continue to implement
on-going projects during the time-frame of this CPS and where it will provide further selective
support to the proven strong implementation of the programs where there is good absorptive and
management capacity. From FY15 onwards, the Bank's program will become significantly more
focused with 4 operations planned for FY15 and just 3 planned annually for FY16 and FY17.

68. 
To provide flexible support, the CPS mid-term review will provide an opportunity to
consolidate the focus further and revisit the mix of instruments if necessary. Moreover, whenever
appropriate, the WBG will continue to leverage support from other donors and private sector financing.
Lastly, the CPS is aligned with Armenia's political cycle and overlaps with the first phase of the ADS
launched by the newly-elected Government.

Instruments of Engagement

69. 
IBRD/IDA support for the CPS period FY14-17 is estimated at $683.5 million. Armenia has
the potential for graduation from IDA by the end of the IDA16 Replenishment period, depending on
continuing per capita performance and growth. Therefore, no assumption is made for FYl5-17 as this is
part of IDA17 and will be decided in that context. IBRD lending will depend on how government demand
and performance evolve in the course of the CPS period, and on IBRD's lending capacity and demand
from other borrowers. Actual resource allocations will be determined on the basis of annual programming
exercises carried out jointly with Government. Subject to these considerations, 
indicative IBRD
commitments would be $599 million over FY14-17. The proposed instruments will include budget
support, investment lending, analytical work, just-in-time policy advice, trust funds, as well as advisory
and investment support to the private sector. Knowledge services will underpin investments and policy
dialogue and will provide the analytical building blocks for future lending under the CPS (Annex B-4).

6 Armenia has access to unused IDA16 resources estimated to SDR1O.6 million and an indicative IDA allocation of SDR

35.3million for FY14. The final FY14 allocation may vary depending on: (i) total IDA resources available, (ii) the country's

performance rating, GNI per capita, and population; (iii) the terms of IDA assistance and the allocation deductions associated

with MDRI annual debt service foregone; (iv) the performance, other allocation parameters, and IDA assistance terms for other

IDA borrowers; and (v) the number of IDA-eligible countries. Also, IDA allocations are made in SDRs based on performance.

While the US dollar equivalent amount is provided at the exchange rate of US$1.50233/SDR, the final exchange rate for each

operation depends on the applicable prevailing rate at the time of approval.

seek opportunities to promote investment in sustainable energy, mobilizing additional investment from
partners where possible. Implementation of existing advisory programs will continue; new programs may
be developed during the CPS period depending on demand.

The DPL has been prepared in coordination with the 

tMF and is central to help maintain

macroeconomic stability. The new series builds on the previous DPL series (2009-2012) which

supported measures aimed at mitigating the effects of the global crisis and lay the foundations for post-
crisis growth. In addition, the ongoing Tax Administration Modernization Project (TAMP), a planned
PFM support, and a strong AAA program will contribute to the achievement of this outcome. Key AAA
include the ongoing programmatic works on debt and fiscal consolidation, public expenditure reviews,
governent policy notes, institutional and governance review, and a growth study to inform resources
reallocation from non-tradable and less productive sectors to tradable and high productive sectors of the
economy. 
IFC's ongoing Investment Climate Reform Project complements 
these 
initiatives by
streamlining and increasing the effectiveness of regulation in the area of tax administration, specifically in
terms of reporting, filing and payment procedures, and through the development of a specific tax regime
for SMEs.

73. 
In addition, the Bank will support macroeconomic monitoring and analysis, particularly on
policies to restore the Government's fiscal headroom by balancing the fiscal deficit as the economy
recovers, and by prudently managing sovereign debt. Key advice would focus on both expenditure
efficiency and equity gains and on strengthening the revenue base through improvements in tax policy
and administration. Given the need to enhance productivity, a greater part of public spending needs to be
devoted to pro-growth activities. To this end, the Bank would help introduce a sound system of project
appraisal, prioritization, execution, and evaluation to ensure that money goes to projects with the highest

economic rate of return. In view of Armenia's access to capital markets aimed at diversifying its sources

of financing, the Bank will provide assistance on related risk mitigation and debt management practices.

First Strategic Cluster: Supporting Competitiveness and job Creation

74. 
The CPS will support private sector-led growth and job creation given the evidence-based
importance that job creation has on poverty reduction. As previously mentioned, the bulk of the
financing program will be directed at this cluster, encompassing the following three engagement areas: (i)
improving the business environment and investment climate to remove impediments to strong growth; (ii)
improving the rural economy in a sustainable way, thus targeting a significant proportion of the poor and
the bottom 40 percent; and (iii) upgrading key economic infrastructure services that are identified as
significant to spurring growth. These areas maximize the synergies between the World Bank and IFC,
particularly as regards providing a basis for stronger private sector investment through PPPs.

22

Engagement Area 1.1: Improved business environment and investment climate for SME creation,
growth, and innovations

Line of sight: The CPS objective will facilitate investment and the creation of new firms and jobs,
which in turn will increase economic opportunities and foster income growth of the bottom 40 percent
of the population.

75. 
Support to improve the environment for SME development will target appropriate
macroeconomic policy, including flexible exchange rate policy, as well as business climate reform,
export and investment promotion, corporate financial information and access to finance. Building
upon their complementary in clients and services, the Bank and IFC will seek additional opportunities to
further strengthen joint work in these areas. Developing SMEs is critical to ensuring a broader growth
base, especially as regards improving access to finance for parts of the population who were previously
not served by the financial system.

76. 
The WBG will continue supporting the Government's Action Plan for Improving
Armenia's Business Environment based on the Memorandum of Reforms on Doing Business in
Armenia. The 2013-2015 Action Plan focuses on areas where Armenia performs relatively poorly
according the Doing Business Indicators (e.g., paying taxes, getting electricity, trading across borders,
protecting investors). In addition, the Bank will help strengthen the legal framework for enterprise exit
and restructuring. This agenda is supported by policy advice under the DPL series, an ongoing IDF grant
for capacity building for automation and one-stop-shop for construction permits procedures, and another
IDF grant for Guillotine regulatory reform capacity strengthening. 
IFC's advisory services Investment
Climate Reform Project plays a key role here as it aims to streamline and increase the effectiveness of
regulation in the areas of tax administration, trade across borders, and inspections, with a cross-cutting
focus on food safety and the agribusiness sector.

77. 

The Bank will help strengthen the competition framework, building upon the momentum of
reform adopted in 2012, which empowered the State Committee for the Protection of Economic
Competition to address the abuse of market dominance under its enhanced legal framework. To date,
actions have focused on retail trade, aviation, fuel sector and pharmaceutical supplies within public
procurement, but now efforts need to be expanded to other economic activities. Additional changes to the
legal framework are needed to strengthen the definition and assessment of dominance, anticompetitive
agreements, and price-related practices; and to increase the number of fines and introduce sanctions on
individuals. This will be achieved through TA and policy advice under the DPL and would be supported
by programmatic analytical work on the sources and drivers of growth.

78. 
An active promotion of exports and investments will be necessary to encourage new
exporters, facilitate trade for established exporters, and promote FDI in tradable sectors, in addition
to efforts aimed at enhancing market access and establishing a business environment that enhances firms'
competitiveness. These are areas of high potential employment growth that can contribute to sustainable
poverty reduction and shared prosperity enhancement in the country. Armenia has taken an important step
in this regard by preparing an Export Promotion Strategy, which needs strong implementation. The
proposed Trade Promotion and Quality Infrastructure Project (FY15) would support the achievement of
these objectives. Together with IFC's work, this project would further strengthen the supply and quality
of analytical and advisory services to businesses for export promotion.

79. 
Incoming tourism is Armenia's second export after mining and metal industry, and covers
more than half of services export. About 20,000 people are employed in the hospitality industry, and it
is estimated that the number of directly tourism-related jobs will increase by 9.400 over the next decade.
The proposed Tourism Economy and Infrastructure Development Project (FY16) will support these

23

outcomes by promoting an integrated approach 
to regional development focusing on tourism
infrastructure, urban regeneration, cultural heritage restoration, and attracting private investors through
PPP arrangements. The World Bank and IFC will capitalize their global knowledge and be a catalyst to
leverage additional finances from other partners, especially the USAID-funded Enterprise Development
and Market Competitiveness Project, and the private sector. In addition, under the DPL, the Government
plans to introduce an integrated border management system with a view to establish joint border crossing
points with Georgia, and to assess, rationalize, and streamline the institutions supporting competitiveness,
export and SME development.

80. 
Competitiveness and innovations are key to achieve the ADS vision of transforming
Armenia from a factor-driven to a knowledge-based economy. Limited innovation in the private
sector hinders economic diversification, industrial upgrading and access to global markets. Weak enabling
environment, lack of sufficient skills, poor vocational training programs, and limited public support for
innovation constitute barriers to innovation, technology transfer, and knowledge-based enterprise growth
in Armenia. The World Bank support will be designed with the ultimate goal of increasing productivity in
most competitive industries and fostering skills development by improving relations between educational,
R&D and scientific institutions and the private sector. Specifically, the Bank though the proposed Trade
Promotion and Quality Infrastructure Project (FY15) will help improve transfer and diffusion of
knowledge and technology through modernization of the framework for intellectual property right,
support ICT-based innovation building upon the ongoing E-Society Project, and enhance technology
transfer and R&D in the private sector.

81. 
Poor financial intermediation and access to financial services are major constraints to
enterprise creation and growth in Armenia. Private sector credit remains low at about 27 percent of
GDP in 2010, compared to the ECA median of 42 percent. The Bank will support increasing financial
intermediation, notably SME access to finance through the planned Long-term Export Finance Project
(FY14). The DPL will also support measures aimed at improving SME access to credit. Additional
technical assistance will be mobilized to strengthen the currently under-developed non-banking financial
institutions and markets, including the insurance and mortgage markets, improve the legal and regulatory
framework as well as the underlying financial infrastructure of other non-banking financial instruments,
such as factoring, leasing, and postal banking. The Bank will continue with policy advice to the Central
Bank, in close coordination with the IMF, on financial sector policy and institutional changes to enhance
financial stability, increase transparency in line with EU directives and Basle core principles, and
strengthen the financial markets. In this connection, an FSAP was completed in 2012 and an update of
this report is on the agenda for the latter period of the CPS. Moreover, ongoing IDF grants will support
the rollout of the country strategy and action plan in corporate financial reporting. Further Trust Fund
operations will help to: (a) enhance literacy in financial services and further strengthen the institutional
arrangements for financial consumer protection to build confidence in banks and encourage deposits; (b)
strengthen the institutional basis for the ongoing pension, life insurance, and capital market reforms; and
(c) improve corporate financial reporting, accounting, auditing, and disclosure standards as part of the
above agenda. IFC's current focus on the financial sector will continue, with various instruments targeting
micro and SME finance, trade, agribusiness, and sustainable energy finance, and possible capitalization
support with equity or quasi-equity instruments. Banking sector consolidation is likely in the medium
term, and IFC could support this process. IFC will also provide advisory services to develop knowledge
and capacity within the banking sector, manage risks, serve SME clientele, and promote sustainable
energy finance, including residential energy efficiency.

24

Engagement Area 1.2: Rural economy sustainably improved

Line of sight: The focus of the program is on boosting incomes of the poorest segments of the rural
population through strengthening agricultural productivity and the social and environmental
sustainability of mining, and improving infrastructure linkages ofpoor rural areas with markets.

82. 
The Bank will support the implementation of the Government's strategy for agriculture
and rural development. Given the importance of the agriculture sector for employment and livelihoods
in the rural areas, it will be a priority for the Bank's investment support with a focus on targeting the
poorest 40 percent (often female-headed rural households). The ongoing Community Agriculture
Resource Management and Competitiveness (CARMAC) Project, a follow-up CARMAC-2 project
(FY14), and the proposed Agriculture Supply Chain operation (FY17) are all instruments that focus on
strengthening agricultural productivity and improving the welfare of the rural population. These projects
are complemented by the IFC Food Safety Improvement Project that supports competitiveness and market
access. In view of the severe climate vulnerabilities, the Bank will support climate-smart agriculture and
agricultural risk management. Key measures to cope with climate change include: (a) improving farmer
access to agronomic technology and information; (ii) investigating options for crop insurance, particularly
for drought; (iii) improving the quality, capacity, and reach of extension services, both generally and for
adapting to climate change; (iv) 
improving capacity of hydro-meteorological 
institutions; and (v)
improving farmers' access to rural finance to enable them to access new technologies.

83. 
Through IDFs and other Trust Funds, the Bank will support four core diagnoses to fill in
the sector knowledge gap: (i) an agricultural census to collect data on demographic structure, gender-
disaggregated, and other socioeconomic characteristics of farmers, which are essential for a sound
diagnostic of the sector and effective policy responses; (ii) an economic analysis of the investment needs
for water resource management, including reservoir and irrigation structures; (iii) a public expenditure
review to enhance efficiency of public spending, reform the existing agricultural subsidy system, and
identify ways to improve the sector's contribution to fiscal revenues; and (iv) an integrated agricultural
risk management assessment 
to help design mitigation-transfer-coping 
strategies and prioritize
interventions to reduce short term volatility and to build long-term resilience of agricultural systems.

84. 
IFC made its first direct investment in the agribusiness sector in FY13 and will seek further
opportunities to support competitive businesses along the agriculture supply chain, including
regional investments by Armenian companies seeking growth opportunities in Georgia and other markets.
IFC's Armenia Food Safety Improvement Project aims to increase the competitiveness and market access
of food producers by increasing their awareness of food safety issues, and helping them implement food
safety management systems. IFC may also consider advisory services to address the lack of transparency
in Armenia's food processing sector, which remains a significant barrier to investment, and will work
with interested companies to improve reporting practices.

85. 
Mining is Armenia's main source of export revenues. To improve this sector's contribution
to fiscal revenues, the Bank helped prepare a new mining code in 2012 and will continue supporting
regulatory reforms and capacity strengthening aimed at enhancing the sector's social and
environmental sustainability. This will be achieved through the ongoing IDF grant on environmental
governance, inclusion and transparency in the mining sector, and related advisory services. In addition,
the Extractive Industries Technical Advisory Facility will support essential building blocks for investment
to occur, such as detailed mining regulations underpinning the mining law, support for the one-stop-shop
on evaluating and processing mining license applications, multi-stakeholder workshops 
to better
understand the sector issues, upgrading of mining cadaster, and progress towards accession to the
Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI). Moreover, under the DPL series, the Bank will help
improve the draft law on environmental impact assessment and expert examination, by addressing

25

specific issues related to the mining sector such as proper handling of waste, protection of water courses
from industrial residue, prevention of land erosion and polluted floods in order to improve the livelihoods
of mining communities in the medium term. Already, the new mining legislative framework supported by
the Bank has paved the way for growing foreign investment. In this connection, IFC has supported a
major mining company listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange, by financing its initial gold mining
exploration works in Armenia through equity investment; and further plans to develop additional equity
investment, with plans to develop additional investments.

86. 
Infrastructure projects will further contribute to the sustainable development of the rural
economy. In this connection, the ongoing irrigation projects will be instrumental in restoring irrigation
systems, enhancing their sustainability, and strengthening the participatory management of the networks
through Water Users Associations, including greater representation of women. The ongoing lifeline/rural
road improvement projects and a follow-up operation (FY16) will promote greater connectivity of rural
areas and facilitate the commercialization of agriculture by increasing access to markets and improving
the delivery of extension services. Connecting farmers to markets in a more effective way is expected to
boost incomes both at the farm and non-farm rural level of some of the poorest segments of the
population, thus bringing about better poverty reduction.

Engagement Area 1.3: Improved access, quality, and sustainability of key infrastructures

Line of sight: The CPS objective is to enhance the effectiveness and impact of infrastructure by
selectively investing in roads and energy as these are areas which are identified as constraints to
growth. WBG work on improving transport, energy and water infrastructure will support effective
targeting of the benefits to the bottom 40 percent of the population.

87. 
In transport, the focus will be on effective implementation of the ongoing Lifeline Road
Network Improvement Projects because of their importance for poverty reduction. The Bank's
focus on the lifeline road network is fully targeted at the bottom 40 percent which are those who rely on
the secondary (lifeline) roads for their economic opportunity (mainly farmers) who would have improved
access to markets, services, and reduced travel time and risk. Improving the quality of key regional and
rural roads is part of a wider strategy to improve both domestic and external connectivity and overall
economic competitiveness. The main highway network is not covered by the Bank's support because the
Asian Development Bank and European Investment Bank are the main donors. The Bank's projects will
also strengthen the capacity of the Ministry of Transport and Communication to manage the road
network. The ongoing operation builds on the previous project, particularly in improving the use of
efficient contracts and the sustainability of the road sector.

88. 
In addition, the CPS will support reforms aimed at addressing regulatory weaknesses in air
transport to improve Armenia's air connectivity. As a land-locked country, air transport is particularly
important for Armenia's trade and global connectivity. Given that only one of Armenia's four land
borders is open (the border with Georgia), air transport is the only other gateway for trade. This is why
air transport issues are being addressed through the DPL, because of its importance to growth and
competitiveness. Flying to and from Yerevan is relatively expensive, and there are limited options for
routes and timings. Costs are often significantly higher than to neighboring Tbilisi. Higher prices are
partially explained by the lack of competition between airlines. A reduction in concentration-an
indication of the market power that can be exerted by companies on a given route-by half, could lead to
a drop in ticket prices in the range of 20 to 30 percent. Under the proposed DPL, the government will
increase transparency, investigate possible non-competitive practices, define its air transport policy, and
assess capacity building needs.

26

89. 
Energy security and supply reliability are identified by the private sector as major
constraints to growth. The Bank will support the Government's plan aiming at promoting energy
security and efficiency by introducing new least-cost generation capacity, investing in renewable energy
supply and energy efficiency, and improving the electricity pricing system. The urgent investment needs
for a transmission network (including rehabilitation of more than 300 km of transmission lines) are
estimated at $80 million - $120 million. The ongoing Electricity Supply Reliability Project is financing
the replacement of approximately 230 km of the transmission network: additional financing will be
provided in FY14 which will increase power supply reliability by increasing line capacity and reducing
outages. In addition, a second energy project would aim at leveraging up to $40 million from other
partners, including grant financing, from the Scaling-up Renewable Energy Program (SREP), to support a
priority renewable energy project that will be included in the Renewable Energy Investment Plan
currently developed by the Govermment and to be submitted to SREP for funding approval. With regard
to energy efficiency, the ongoing Government-funded program supported by the Global Environment
Facility (GEF) will continue financing the reduction of energy consumption of public facilities and
removing barriers to the implementation of energy efficiency investments in the public sector. The Bank's
ESW will help inform the Government's policies to safeguard the sector's financial viability, ensure
affordable supply, optimize the transmission network, and improve its safety, helping at improving the
livelihood of the Armenian population. On the private sector side, IFC's Sustainable Energy Finance
Project seeks to establish a market for energy efficiency and renewable energy investments in Armenia.
The project aims to develop sustainable energy financing through local financial intermediaries by
improving the regulatory framework for renewable energy, increasing awareness and expertise of project
developers and local design companies, and building awareness and market demand for sustainable
energy finance. In energy, the IFC Sustainable Energy Finance Project supports common program goals
on energy efficiency and renewable energy generation;

90. 
In water, the focus will be put on assisting the Government to allow equitable access by the
poorest households, achieve sustainability of the sector through regulatory reforms and increase
operational efficiency. Technical assistance will help: (a) revisit the sector structure, including the
rationale for geographic cross-subsidies and, as a consequence, for operating several utility companies;
(b) design tariff policies needed to safeguard the financial viability of the water utilities while allowing
equitable access by the poorest households; (c) develop a viable financing strategy through an affordable
mix of cash generation, long-term debt, Govermment transfers, and donor funds; and (d) deepen the
current PPP schemes from management to lease contract, and from lease to concession. Efficiency
measures should be taken to reduce excessive non-revenue water (NRW) from its current level-a
whopping 83.5 percent of water production to date-to about 70 percent. The ongoing water sector
projects will support the above activities, with strong leverage from other donors' programs and the
private sector.

Second Strategic Cluster of Engagement: Improving Efficiency and Targeting
of Social Services

91. 
The CPS will support selected elements of the Government's program that particularly
focus on eliminating extreme poverty and mitigating poverty of the poorest 40 percent of the
population through further strengthening the social protection system, and ensuring access of all,
especially women, to quality social services. The Bank's program is built on the results of good
experience to date whereby projects have been implemented well with documented good impact. The
implementation of on-going operations will be complemented by additional financing or follow-on
operations in three selected areas - health, education and social protection.

27

Engagement Area 2.1: Improved efficiency and equity of health services

Line of sight: The CPS will target improving health outcomes by reducing mortality and morbidity,
with a focus on the poorest segment of the population. A key objective is on protecting households
against high out-of-pocket payments for health care, by ensuring that people do not face medical
expenditures that are either "impoverishing" to drive them below the poverty line, or unaffordable as a
result of an episode of ill health.

92. 
Armenia still faces 
the dual challenge of the unfinished MDG agenda that affect
disproportionally the bottom 40 percent (notably on maternal and child health) and a record increase
in Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs). No major progress has been achieved in improving health
outcomes in terms of mortality and morbidity. The greatest burden of disease in Armenia, as in most
European countries, comes from NCDs, a group of conditions that includes cardiovascular disease,
cancer, mental health, diabetes mellitus, chronic respiratory disease and musculoskeletal conditions. Age-
standardized death rates indicate that more men than women die from NCDs. The CPS will build on the
major sector reforms carried out in recent years, which helped develop primary healthcare, improve health
financing, optimize and modernize public hospitals across the country, and strengthen the Government
institutional capacities. The ongoing Disease Prevention and Control Project (FY13) is the key
instrument for further addressing this agenda. This project has a particular gender focus as it aims to
improve maternal and child health services, as well as the prevention, early detection, and management of
selected NCDs at the primary health care level; and the efficiency and quality of selected hospitals in
Armenia. Within that framework, the Bank and IFC have joined efforts to advise the Government on
approaches to improve the delivery of oncology services, with the Bank providing funding and policy
advice to the Government and IFC helping carry out feasibility studies formulating advisory proposal to
structure the transaction as a PPP.

93. 
Through sector policy dialogue and AAA, the Bank will assist the Government in better
targeting Armenia's limited health budget to the poor and vulnerable groups. Armenia has the
second highest rate of inequality in the utilization of health care between rich and poor in the ECA region,
due in large part to the high levels of out-of-pocket payments currently required for accessing care. The
Bank will contribute to the discussion of fiscal space for the health sector, including analysis of the
appropriate funding for the sector and strategies for moving towards universal health coverage.
Furthermore, as Armenia has moved away from centralized management and given more autonomy to
health facilities, there is an emerging need to define coherent governance models for hospitals to produce
the expected results. A proposed ESW will aim at ensuring proper accountability and supervision
arrangements for performance of public hospitals, adherence to norms in all institutions; ensuring
transparency in planning and use of public health care finances; and strengthening monitoring and
evaluation of policy implementation and outcomes.

Engagement Area 2.2: Improved efficiency, equitable access, and quality of education services

Line ofsight: The CPS objectives aim at developing relevant skills needed for economic growth and job
creation by addressing gaps between education outcomes and the skills needs of the labor market.
Furthermore, the high school actions are linked to the shared prosperity goal as continuing education
to high school level is linked to socio-economic status. The pre-school component will benefit directly
the poorest communities in the country where such schools are usually lacking

94. 
The CPS will build on the first and second Education Quality and Relevance Projects
(EQRP, 2004 to date) which helped, inter alia: develop and implement new curriculum, standards and
syllabi; improve student learning; strengthen teachers' training and evaluation, expand e-access by all
schools, and reform the per capita financing mechanism, resulting in substantial efficiency gains,

28

increased student-teacher ratios, and enhanced school autonomy. The on-going second EQRP extended
the scope of the previous project to preschool, secondary education and higher education. The CPS
proposes a new Education Quality Project (FY14) to improve school readiness of children entering
primary education, improve the learning environment in general education, including integration of ICT
into teaching and learning processes and enriching education in high schools, and increase partnerships
between higher education institutions and the private sector established under the ongoing EQRP-funded
Competitive Innovation Fund with the aim of developing and modernizing the higher education sector in
Armenia. This project will include approaches to attract women to non-traditional fields of study and
hence address gender segregation in the labor market, while building the skills required for Armenia's
knowledge-based economy and with it opportunities. The assessment of student learning and achievement
will be further supported by the Russia Aid for Education Development (READ) Trust Fund.

Engagement Area 2.3: Improved coverage and targeting of the FBP and efficiency of social services
delivery

Line of sight: Public spending on social protection and improved coverage and targeting of social
safety net programs will continue to play a key role in mitigating poverty, addressing vulnerability and
inequalities.

95. 
The Bank will assist the government in improving the coverage and targeting of the Family
Benefits Program (FBP) flagship program to better benefit the poor and vulnerable. This social
assistance program has a good targeting accuracy but its coverage of the poor is low, and has gone down
in recent years along with the total number of beneficiaries despite the increase in poverty incidence after
the crisis. The proposed reforms will extend the program's coverage while maintaining its targeting
efficiency. In addition, the government plans to extend health benefits to a larger share of social
assistance beneficiaries. Under current arrangements, vulnerable families are exempt from health co-
payments. However, coverage of this health benefit is lower than the coverage of the FBP, due to a more
stringent eligibility threshold. With a modest increase in social protection allocations envisaged in the
2013-2015 MTEF, the government intends to make this benefit available to families with the same
eligibility threshold as the FBP. Achievement of these outcomes will be underpinned by the DPL series
and the programmatic analytical work on poverty and vulnerability.

96. 
The Bank will support the Government's efforts aimed at providing integrated delivery of
social services, especially to the poor, through one-stop-shops. This will help streamline social welfare
provision, increase more equitable coverage, and use resources more efficiently to address the needs of
poor and vulnerable families. These integrated centres will also promote employment intermediation and
match-making, thereby increasing labour market efficiency and promoting job opportunities for poor and
vulnerable beneficiaries of various social assistance programs. The government piloted three integrated
access points for social service delivery in 2013. By 2017, all 54 access points across the country are
expected to be functional. The roll-out of the integrated social services across the country will be
supported by the upcoming Social Protection Administration Support Project (FY14). The existing DPL
will track progress based on the share of households below the poverty line covered by FBP (overall and
disaggregated by female- and male-headed households given the association between poverty and gender
of household head), the share of FBP benefits paid to poor households (targeting accuracy), and the
number of consolidated service centers. The Government intends to maintain its focus on pro-poor
spending in the MTEF, and therefore protect the share of such spending in the budget. This will be also
monitored under the DPL.

97. 
Over 175,000 persons are officially registered as People with Disabilities (PWDs) 
in
Armenia. They suffer from insufficient care and protection due to government's limited capacity, and
have unemployment rates four times higher than the rest of the population. To help communities address

29

their needs, the government supports community-driven approaches for social service delivery. The
World Bank and other partners have provided technical and financial support to help NGOs pilot these
approaches at the community level. In that context, the World Bank supported Mission Armenia, a local
NGO, to implement a grant from the Japan Social Development Fund (JSDF) to improve self-reliant
livelihood generating opportunities and vital services for the extremely vulnerable and disabled persons in
Armenia, through ensuring access to social services, care and promoting self-employment opportunities.
The approaches and the models to be implemented by the Project can be scaled up and effectively used in
other parts of country for poverty reduction and addressing need of people with disabilities.

98. 
A community-driven development (CDD) approach to basic infrastructure services delivery
will be promoted through the ongoing Social Investment Fund and a follow-up operation (FY15). These
operations would focus on the bottom 40 percent through specifically targeting interventions that will
improve people's lives in the poorest rural and urban areas through rehabilitation and creation of social
infrastructure aimed at improving social welfare in poor communities and mitigating regional disparities;
contribute to job creation; and strengthen efficiency in community governance.

99. 
The Bank will support Armenia in developing catastrophe risk financing and weather risk
hedging instruments, to reduce the financial vulnerability of the government, businesses, and households
to the adverse 
impacts of geo-hazards and climate change, 
through market-based risk transfer
mechanisms. The poor are the most affected by these events and thus this intervention would benefit
them. Major investments into prevention activities are needed, given Armenia's high exposure to disaster.
Yerevan, home to 40 percent of the population, is in one of the highest seismic risk areas. A recent
analysis of its building stock revealed that an earthquake with a magnitude of 7 or above would destroy
most buildings, potentially killing 60,000 people. Desertification now threatens some 80 percent of the
country and severe desertification is a threat in 50 percent of the country.7 Disaster mitigation could
include flood control, retrofitting of buildings, bridges, lifelines and other key infrastructure to resist
seismic shocks. Since not all risks can be mitigated, adaptation becomes essential to ensure that
development activities take into consideration the current risks. The Bank will support prevention
activities which will include reinforcement of key public facilities, such as schools and government
buildings, and will seek grants from the Global Fund for Disaster Risk Reduction to fund related advisory
and advocacy services. The Govermment developed criteria for selection of at-risk key public facilities
requiring retrofitting, which with Bank's support are currently being finalized for retrofitting.

Cross-Cutting Cluster of Engagement: Improving Governance and Anti-
corruption Measures in Public Services

100. 
Selected strategic CPS interventions will support key elements of the Government's
governance and anti-corruption agenda, including revamping the anti-corruption framework, improving
efficiency of the public administration, and deepening PFM reforms. The focus areas of the Bank's work
are to improve overall public administration management which would allow for a better business
framework necessary for enterprise growth and job creation, and to create an environment where public
services can have greater impact, through being delivered in a more efficient, cost-effective and
sustainable manner.

Reference is made to GLASOD/LADA land/aridity classifications ensuring a distinction between land degradation induced by
human/livestock pressure and process of desertification driven by aridity.

30

Engagement Area 3.1: Improved framework for fighting corruption in public services

Line of sight: Corruption hurts the poor and vulnerable, deters private investments, and hampers job
creation. The goal of the Bank's program is to strengthen good governance and anti-corruption
through, on the demand side, developing social accountability tools for the population and, on the
supply side, strengthening anti-corruption bodies

101. 
The Bank will work closely with the EU and other partners to advise Government on its
new GAC strategy, following the expiration of the 2009-12 strategy and action plan which produced
little results. In this connection, Trust Fund resources will be sought to: (a) promote improved access to
information on Government activities, notably through the ongoing electronic procurement program
which would allow disclosure of procurement outcomes, effective contract management to ensure
compliance with deliverables, and public reporting to enhance accountability over results; (b) strengthen
the core anti-corruption bodies, including the Ethics Commission for High-Ranked Officials, as well as
the Chamber of Control's auditing capacity and professionalism; and the Central Bank's capacity to
combat money laundering; (c) roll-out legal and judicial reforms to capture demand-side institutions,
including advocacy and pre-court 
investigative functions and documentation; and (d) design and
implement a capacity development and anticorruption training and awareness program for employees
across all levels of the civil service.

102. 
Through social accountability tools, the Bank will promote demand-driven initiatives for
good governance. The CPS addresses social accountability through ongoing support to Parliament
oversight committees, works with and strengthens all tiers of government, and emphasizes broadly shared
benefits of growth. Further actions to be considered include (a) strengthening the capacity of media in
investigative journalism; (b) formalizing the participation of private sector and nongovernmental actors in
public policy deliberations, public discussions on the efficacy of the Government's anti-corruption
strategy, and monitoring and evaluation of development programs; (c) improving civil society monitoring
of the mining code implementation, and transparency/EITI related issues; and (d) mainstreaming tools
such as client/user satisfaction surveys to collect feedback on public services delivery, including their
quality and integrity, and strengthening grievance redress mechanisms. These tools will help increase the
trust in government and ensure that services that are delivered are tailored to the needs of beneficiaries.
Social accountability activities would thus be mainstreamed 
in the portfolio, notably in projects
supporting service delivery to local communities, with the aim of both improving the quality and reach of
public services, and involving and empowering citizens, notably women, in making decisions about
issues that affect them.

Engagement Area 3.2: Improved efficiency of public administration and service delivery

Line of sight: The CPS objective is to help create an environment where public services can be
delivered in a more efficient, cost-effective and sustainable manner, which in turn will make it possible
to foster income growth for the bottom 40 percent of the population in a manner that is sustainable
over the medium-term.

103. 
Under the DPL series, the Bank will support the Government's strategy to increase
efficiency of the civil services through changes in legislation designed to enhance flexibility of
recruitment and promotion of professional staff, introduce merit-based systems, and discontinue the
system of periodical attestation of civil servants, which has become obsolete with the development of
modem performance evaluation tools. Armenia's civil service is hampered by the low level of public pay
and cumbersome procedures. Both affect its capacity for policy formulation and support to government
systems. Low pay and stringent requirements for years of professional experience discourage applications
from many qualified candidates for positions for specialists. A centralized human resources management

31

system further reduces the flexibility with which open positions can be filled (except for decentralized
recruitment of Junior Staff). Regular mandatory attestations, which bear little relation with actual job
requirements, further contribute to low staff morale.

104. Moving from physical to electronic transactions can greatly increase efficiency both in the
public and private sectors. Necessary conditions for the new electronic business model to thrive are
secure access to electronic services and interoperability of systems. The government therefore plans to
introduce regulation and standards for cyber security and interoperability. It will start with costing and
planning necessary investments, before adoption of an Electronic Transactions Act which will include key
regulations pertaining to electronic transactions within the government, between government and citizens,
and government and businesses. A special institutional framework will be established to govern electronic
government. The inter-operability of databases will also help anti-corruption efforts. Effective data
exchange and inter-operability of public administration databases with the planned Electronic Disclosure
System managed by the Ethics Commission for High Ranking Officials will facilitate enforcement of
ethics rules. Policy, legislative, and institutional reforms to achieve the above outcomes would be
underpinned by the DPL series and supported by the public sector modernization project (FY15).

Engagement Area 3.3: Management of public resources strengthened

Line of sight: Improving public resource management will entail setting up a fairer tax administration
system which allows for a better business environment necessary for enterprise growth and job
creation and, at the same time, allows Government to improve revenues for financing social programs.

105. 
In Armenia's resource constrained environment, effective use of public resources is critical
for achieving its ambitious growth, job creation, and poverty reduction agenda. Particular attention
will be paid 
to strengthening public finance management 
(PFM). Increasing 
transparency and
accountability should be at the core of the next generation of PFM reforms which, together with program
budgeting, place even greater emphasis on performance accountability.

106. 
The upcoming Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) assessment will
update the PFM diagnostic, identify weak spots, and inform future reforms. The previous PEFA
assessment played a key role in setting the agenda for recent reforms which resulted in some progress in
Public Internal Financial Control (PIFC) and internal audit. The next assessment currently underway and
scheduled to be concluded later in 2013 will help identify PFM priorities to be reflected in an updated
reform strategy. The national PEFA assessment will be complemented by a comprehensive Business
Process Re-engineering (BPR) carried out by the Ministry of Finance with support from a Russian Trust
Fund. The BPR will focus on the current needs and assess each existing function to determine the scope
of future activities, including budgeting, treasury system, payroll, etc. In addition, a new framework for
enhanced monitoring and control of State Non-Commercial Organizations (SNCOs) will need to be
implemented to provide better transparency and accountability of their activities; improve the existing
legal system; and reduce these organizations' overall fiscal risks. The Armenian Chamber of Control will
need to be strengthened 
to conduct sound external audit and thereby improve transparency and
accountability leading to better management of public resources.

107. Other PFM policy issues require priority attention. These include the need to, inter alia:
produce a medium-term policy document to set new policy priorities/targets and guide the budgeting
process; enhance public debt management capacity to inform fiscal policy; introduce a public investment
appraisal system to improve efficiency of capital expenditure management; set up a fiscal risks
management system, advance Treasury reforms to facilitate the program-based budgeting system; and
enhance the internal control and internal audit institutions in the overall governance environment to
enable greater managerial accountability for results. PFM support will be provided primarily through an

32

investment loan (FY15) and Trust Fund operations, building upon the extensive Bank support already
provided by a series of trust funds in the areas of fiscal management, government information
management systems, accounting, internal control, fiduciary control over SNCOs, external audit, and
others. The ongoing multi-year public expenditure review will also be an important vehicle for support.

D. Development Partner Coordination

108. 
Partnership, financial and policy coordination is central to the CPS. The WBG will
increasingly rely upon leveraging other development partners. The Bank will continue engaging with
the IMF, especially on issues affecting Armenia's macroeconomic stability and competitiveness. The
Bank leads the policy dialogue on structural and institutional reforms while the IMF assists with
macroeconomic policy advice. The WBG will also coordinate closely with the European Commission,
given the EU's rapidly expanding program in Armenia. Annex 3 provides further details on other donors'
activities and areas of collaboration and cross-support with the WBG.

109. 
The Government has taken the lead in promoting an efficient division of labor among
development partners. Donor meetings chaired by the Prime Minister are held periodically to discuss
key strategic and resource mobilization issues. Sectoral coordination meetings are hosted by the Minister
of Finance and/or the Minister of Economy. These meetings provide a platform for aligning donors'
programs with Government priorities, ensuring complementarity of approaches, and minimizing
duplication. The meetings are often ad hoc and would therefore benefit from a more structured
government-led coordination mechanism, in line with the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness.

110. Most donors provide the government with budget estimates for disbursement of project aid
at stages consistent with the government's budget calendar. There is a need, however, to ensure that
donor-funded investment projects, which are currently managed according to the individual procedures of
the donors, are fully incorporated into the public investment process and clearly linked to sectoral policies
and the MTEF. UNDP and other partners helped develop an e-database on donor projects, administered
by the Ministry of Economy, and comprising inter alia, disbursement plans, budget breakdown consistent
with the budget classification. Efforts to strengthen the Country Systems (including procurement,
financial management, and safeguards) are in progress to align with international standards and promote
their use in donor-funded projects, in accordance with the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness.

E. Monitoring and Evaluation

111. 
Given the results focus of the CPS, strong emphasis is placed on the results monitoring and
evaluation framework. The results focus will be implemented at three levels: (i) at the national level
through support to the development of an effective ADS results monitoring system; (ii) at the WBG
portfolio level through the establishment of a robust CPS results framework; and (iii) at the project level
through strengthened results evaluation of individual Bank operations.

112. 
The Bank and other partners are currently supporting the Government to put in place the
appropriate tools and processes to ensure effective monitoring and evaluation of the ADS. Results
and policy matrices linking the ADS results measurements and policy actions for all key sectors will be
developed. A Monitoring Unit responsible for producing annual progress reports will be established in the
Ministry of Economy and/or Ministry of Finance. Capacity gaps have been identified in poverty
measurement, data collection and analysis, notably in aligning statistical production with the ADS, the
MTEF, the sector monitoring requirements in line ministries and the NSS. These shortcomings will be
addressed through advisory services, training, and Trust funded technical assistance from the World
Bank, the EU Twining Facility, UNDP and other partners.

33

113. 
The CPS will support the ADS objectives aiming at lifting over 400,000 people net out of
poverty and, thereby, reducing poverty incidence from 35 percent of the population in 2011 to 23
percent in 2017. The Bank will continue to strengthen the NSS's capacity to measure growth in both
consumption and real income per capita of the poor and bottom 40 percent, track the patterns of
inequality, and better inform related policy-making on the pathways for sharing prosperity and reducing
poverty in Armenia.

114. 
The CPS Results Matrix is aligned to the ADS monitoring and evaluation system, by linking
where possible the indicators, data sources, and result tracking system of the Bank operations to the ones
of the Govermment. The Matrix is focused where the Bank is expected to be able to influence over the
CPS period. The outcomes have been formulated bearing in mind that results during this period will come
mainly from the implementation of the on-going program, as well as proposed AAA, ongoing portfolio,
and quick-disbursing operations included in the lending program. The CPS Progress Report will provide
an opportunity to update the results framework if necessary, in the light of developments. To the extent
possible, the impact of Bank operations on gender issues will be monitored as part of the results
indicators of individual projects and analytical works; and a stock-taking will be carried out at the time of
the CPS Progress Report. CPS results will be further monitored via regular project implementation
support missions, annual reviews of programmatic knowledge and convening services, annual Country
Portfolio Performance Reviews, client demand and feedback, Bank internal independent evaluations, the
mid-term CPS Progress Report and the final CPS Completion Report.

F. Consultations

115. 
The CPS preparation benefited from extensive stakeholder consultations. The process started
with a High Level Policy Forum chaired by the Prime Minister in December 2012. This Forum discussed
the Bank report titled "Policy Notes for the New Government", which helped inform the Government's
reform agenda and the CPS. A series of stakeholder consultations were held in May/June 2013, including
meetings with central and local government representatives, members of parliament, donors, the business
community, academia, youth and students, think tanks, civil society organizations, women associations,
and media outlets. The main objectives of the consultations were to solicit views on the WBG's role in
Armenia and discuss key development challenges of the country as well as the WBG's response and
results framework. The analysis and consultations served as the basis for the proposed CPS's strategic
framework and engagement areas.

116. 
The Bank also supported the participatory and consultative process of the ADS organized
by the Government in March-June 2013 with other partners. This process was structured in two
phases: (a) discussions of the ADS's macroeconomic framework and scenario held in Yerevan, which
assessed the growth projections, resource mobilization prospects, and costing under the MTEF; and (b) a
series of public consultations in the provinces (marzes) focusing on sector policy reforms, priority public
investment programs, expected results, and the monitoring and evaluation system. The consultations were
attended by diverse stakeholders and helped enhance the broad ownership base of the Strategy and its
alignment with the CPS in fine.

117. 
Stakeholder consultation and public outreach are mainstreamed in the CPS. The Bank will
continue working closely with the Government to consistently reach out to project beneficiaries, local
govermment officials, and other stakeholders. Various workshops and consultative events will be
organized on key policy issues, including investment climate reforms, fight against corruption, social
protection, climate change, agriculture, mining, etc. The Bank also stepped up its engagement with
academic institutions, think tanks, and students through the conduct of policy seminars. With support
from an IDF Grant, the Bank is helping strengthen the Parliament's capacity for policy formulation and

34

public dialogue. The CPS proposes to track the impact of these communications, including quality and
strategic outreach, to strengthen the dialogue and dissemination on institutional and policy reforms, as
part of the results monitoring.

IV. MANAGING RISKS

118. 
The macroeconomic risks are significant. Although the economy has recovered, the
downside risks remain high. A new global economic downturn could have ripple effects on the demand
of Armenia's exports and the reduction of remittances and foreign investment flows. As the Government
has less than before fiscal space for further counter-cyclical and social support policies this could result in
another contraction of economy. Social tensions could increase, exacerbated by rising food prices,
unabated poverty, and reduced job opportunities, notably for the youth and women. Such external shocks
could impact the Bank program by shifting priorities towards greater budget support to help Government
sustain its pro-poor spending in case of an emerging crisis. By strengthening Armenia's economic and
social agenda, the World Bank Group helps mitigate the external risks arising from the global economic
environment and increase the economy's resilience to a possible shock.

119. 
The regional security risks remain high with regard to the conflict with Azerbaijan over
Nagorno-Karabakh and the stand-off between 
the international community and Iran. The
Govermment of Armenia is engaged with the Minsk Group of countries under the OSCE in their efforts to
assist the parties in finding a peaceful solution to the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. The Armenian economy
has reduced its links to the Iranian economy over the past years, but a closure of the Iranian border would
nevertheless hit exports to Eastern markets, which otherwise provide promising opportunities for
diversification of Armenian exports. An escalated conflict with Azerbaijan could reduce the Bank
Group's ability to deploy its programs across the country due to heightened security concerns. The
portfolio could be restructured accordingly, depending on the evolving security situation.

120. 
Domestic political developments could lead to policy slippages in implementing structural
reforms. The recent elections did not fully resolve the protracted crisis between the ruling and opposition
parties. In this connection, the government commitment to continue implementing transformational
reforms may falter if opposition to key measures gains political support. To mitigate the risk of vested
interests undermining reform implementation, the authorities have increased outreach efforts to build
consensus and broaden the political support for the reforms, particularly among the beneficiaries. The
Bank is supporting these efforts and the CPS will be implemented in a manner that widens dialogue and
knowledge dissemination, and so works to build broad support for institutional and policy reforms. The
CPS also retains flexibility to adjust Bank lending to respond to shifting needs and policy slippages.

121. 
The risks of natural disasters and climate change remain high. Armenia is a high risk country
in terms of exposure to natural disasters and severity of potential human and economic losses from
earthquakes that are the principal risk. Armenia has the highest potential of economic loss due to
catastrophic events among ECA countries. It is also highly exposed to increased climate extremes which
undermine its sustainable development. The poor are particularly vulnerable to these events. A Bank
report financed under the GFDRR has recommended actions for short, medium and 
long term
interventions directed toward reduction of risks of natural disasters. Integrate disaster risk management
into development is a priority. This includes proper land planning, enforcement of disaster resilience
building codes, and investments into prevention such as retrofitting of critical infrastructure and
reinforcement of key public buildings, such as schools, hospitals and government buildings. Depending
on their magnitude, natural disasters could impact the Bank programs. The CPS would exercise flexibility
and adjust Bank lending to respond to emerging priorities, social support, and reconstruction needs.

I. Context and Overall Assessment

1. 
This Country Partnership Strategy Completion Report (CPSCR) evaluates the effectiveness
of the World Bank Group's assistance to Armenia during FY09-13 and draws lessons for the
preparation of the forthcoming Country Partnership Strategy FY14-17. Initially the CPS was
envisaged for FY09-12, however at the mid-term review the Progress Report (CPSPR) extended the
CPS period by one year in order to align with Armenia's political cycle and provided additional
financing. The evaluation of the CPS program is based on the alignment of the Bank Group's
assistance program with the strategic objectives of the Government's Sustainable Development
Program and related progress towards Armenia's longer-term development objectives, the outcomes
of the implementation of Bank-financed operations, the role of IFC investment and advisory
operations, the capacity building activities, and the impact of analytical and advisory activities
(AAA). The CPSCR evaluation of results is based on the updated FY09-13 Results Matrix of the
CPSPR. The CPSCR benefitted from feedback and advice provided by the Bank's and IFC's
operational staff in general and the Country Offices in particular. Its findings and proposed lessons
have been discussed with relevant Government interlocutors, other Armenian stakeholders and donor
representatives.

2. 
The CPS was built around two strategic pillars: addressing vulnerabilities and
strengthening competitiveness for post-crisis growth. The CPSPR confirmed these pillars and the
underlying results areas and outcomes:

* The first pillar included measures to mitigate risks in three areas: 
(i) macroeconomic
stabilization and positioning of Armenia for post-crisis growth through counter-cyclical and
prudent macroeconomic policies, reform of tax regime and administration, and increased
financial 
intermediation 
to foster private sector output and employment; (ii) poverty
alleviation through employment generation, higher and better targeted social protection
spending, better access of the poor to basic health services, and increased use of safe gas
heating for schools and apartment dwellers; and (iii) reduced rural and environmental risks
through increased irrigated areas and livestock productivity, fiscally, environmentally and
socially sound mining legislation, and preparedness for managing natural disasters.

* The second pillar aimed at strengthening competitiveness for medium-term economic growth
by: (i) improving governance to boost public sector efficiency through reduced conflict of
interest among public officials, fair market competition rules, consistent and predictable rule-
bound judicial decisions, more efficient 
tax and customs administration, 
improved
transparency, effectiveness and accountability of public expenditure, a more functional and
rule-bound judiciary, and improved performance and financial management of corporate
entities; and (ii) strengthening knowledge and competitiveness through development of the
knowledge economy infrastructure, easier access to internet, improved roads, improved
energy efficiency, 
lower transmission 
losses and development of renewable energy
generation, improved access to safe water, SME's access to credit, improved food safety
practices, direct investment in competitive private sector entities and education reforms to
improve access and quality.

3. 
The overall performance of the CPS FYO9-13 program was rated Satisfactory with 90
percent of the 20 outcomes and of the 48 CPSPR results indicators achieved fully or
substantially. As discussed in detail in Section III, four of the five results areas were evaluated by the
team as achieved overall, and a fifth one (rural and environmental risks) as partly achieved (see
Annex A). Out of the 20 CPS/CPSPR outcomes 18 were achieved, and only two (support to rural
output and natural disasters prevention) were not achieved. Bank program performance was rated by
the team as Satisfactory, for both quality at entry and for Bank support to CPS implementation.
Section IV documents the implementation of the proposed lending and non-lending operations and
activities. The findings and recommendations of this Completion Report were taken into account for
the preparation of the new CPS for FY14-17.

II. Armenia's Progress Towards Sustainable Development Goals

4. 
Armenia's Development Strategy. The 
latest development strategy, 
the Sustainable
Development Program (SDP) 8 of Armenia was issued in October 2008. The SDP provided an
adequate policy framework for the FY09-13 country assistance program even though it had not
anticipated the onset of the economic crisis and macroeconomic projections were overtaken by
events. The SDP comprehensive policy agenda included: 
(i) general economic policies; (ii)
employment generation to mitigate poverty; (iii) agriculture and rural development; (iv) infrastructure
development; (v) family and child benefits as mainstay of social protection; (vi) health; (vii)
education; (viii) public administration effectiveness, governance and accountability, e-government,
public financial management; (ix) judicial system reform; and (x) anti-corruption policies. Most of
these themes were retained by the CPS program, while taking into account the short- and medium-
term impact of the global economic and financial crisis.

5. 
Economic policy updates. The Government's Letters of Development Policies (LDP) and
Letters of Intent (Lol) underpinning the budget and balance of payments support programs concluded
by Armenia with the Bank and the IMF 9 validated the SDP strategy and reflected the changed
economic and social environment due to the crisis by emphasizing short- and medium-term policy
measures, spelling out the expected outcomes, and defining monitoring arrangements.

6. 
Armenia made good progress towards the implementation of the SDP. While Armenia's
economy was severely hit by the financial and economic crisis, it was not anticipated and therefore
not considered at the time of SDP preparation. Due to the severe impact of the crisis, Government's
priorities shifted quickly away from the SDP agenda towards emergency crisis responses. The SDP
thus became irrelevant as a development strategy and was not further implemented nor monitored. In
the absence of Government reports on SDP implementation, progress assessment is largely based on
the evaluation of the CPS-supported program, which is congruent with most of the SDP objectives.
The next section will provide a more detailed description. Competitiveness gains critical to
sustainable economic growth and outstanding challenges were confirmed by the latest Doing Business
surveylo, which documents Armenia's progress made during 2005-2013 towards the performance
frontier in the areas of starting a business, dealing with construction permits, facilitating access to
credit, protecting investors and paying taxes. The report ranked Armenia 3 2 d out of the 185 countries
from 3 9 th in 2008. At the same time, the survey noted that Armenia still ranks poorly with respect to
paying taxes, and that it made less or no progress in the areas of registering property, trading across
borders, enforcing contracts and resolving insolvency). The Global Competitiveness report ranked

surveyed in 2008-09."

Armenia weathered the impact of the global crisis and is well positioned for sustained

7. 
growth:
* Macroeconomic stabilization. Robust growth, prudent monetary policies, subdued inflation,
fiscal consolidation and a sustainable public debt allow a cautiously optimistic medium-term
outlook. Prudent macroeconomic management and counter-cyclical fiscal policies helped
reverse the sharp 14.1 percent GDP contraction of 2009: growth resumed in 2010, accelerated
to 4.7 percent in 2011 and 7.2 percent in 2012, and is projected to continue in 2013-15 at a
steady rate of over 5 percent. The cash fiscal deficit, which had reached 7.6 percent of GDP
in 2009, was sharply reduced to 1.7 percent in 2012 and is projected to stabilize at 2 percent
of GDP through 2015. Inflation declined to 3.2 percent by end-2012 and is projected around 4
percent in the medium-term. The current account deficit of the balance of payments was
reduced from 15.8 percent of GDP in 2009 to 10.8 percent in 2012 and would further decline
in the medium term. After reaching in 2013 at 38 percent of GDP (well under the legally-
mandated ceiling of 50 percent), public debt would remain broadly stable and sustainable in
the medium-term.

* Poverty Mitigation. The high growth performance of the pre-crisis period was translated into
poverty reduction gains but was eroded during the 2009 crisis and remained stagnant in 2010.
In just four years of high growth between 2004 and 2008, Armenia's absolute poverty rate,
measured using the national poverty line, fell from 53.5 percent to 27.6 percent. This drop in
poverty by half would have led to further improvements in the country's social indicators had
the economic crisis not hit Armenia in 2009. As a result of the crisis, poverty rate increased
from 27.6 percent in 2008 to 34 percent in 2009 and remained at 35 percent (2011) since then
despite the growth recovery since 2010. The poverty differences by gender are insignificant.
Poverty incidence among women was 34.5 percent in 2011, while for men it was 35.5
percent. The impact of the economic crisis on the poor was well managed. The share of social
protection and pensions spending in total government expenditure increased from 24.8
percent in 2008 to 29.4 percent in 2012, thus protecting the coverage of the poorest
households despite the increase in the number of poor by 270,000. Targeting of social
protection improved, and households in the bottom quintile received 74.5 percent of benefits
in 2011 compared with 67 percent in 2008. The average benefit paid to social programs
beneficiaries was maintained during 2008-12 at about 17 percent of the consumption basket
of the poor. Government spending for health increased from 1.4 percent of GDP in 2008 to
1.7 percent in 2011 and 1.6 percent in 2012, and 95 percent of population had access to
qualified medicine practices by end-2012.

* Rural and Environmental Issues. Rehabilitation of irrigation canals 
in 2009-12 made
irrigation feasible on 8,000 ha by end-2012 and another 6,500 ha by end-2013. Actual use of
this irrigation potential hinges on farmers' willingness and ability to invest, especially when
establishing vineyards or orchards that carry high investment costs. The Government is
implementing measures to increase rural output and mitigate poverty through better control of
livestock disease prevalence, pasture management and increased livestock productivity, but
results will take a few years to materialize. Bank-financed projects generated by November
2012 about 73,000 person/months of temporary jobs, mostly in the rural areas. Environmental
risks were addressed through the adoption of a new Mining Code and subsidiary legislation
compliant with best international practice, though implementation of disaster management

'The Global Competitiveness Reports 2008-2009 and 2012-2013 (World Economic Forum, Geneva,
Switzerland, 2009 and 2012).

44

measures, including a program to retrofit schools and other key public facilities at risk from
earthquakes, is proceeding slower than anticipated.

* Public Sector Efficiency. Certain steps have been taken towards strengthening of the
governance and public financial management, enhancing the transparency and accountability
of the public sector, and improving the performance of the judicial system. The Authorities
enacted legislation to contain conflict of interest in the public sector, introduced risk-based
custom clearance and a modem information system and transparency tools at courts,
introduced performance-based public financial management, and strengthened fiduciary
controls on public financial management and corporate entities. Improved access of courts to
modem information systems envisaged speeding up of judicial decisions and enhancing
consistency. The 2012-13 Global Competitiveness Report indicates a significant gain in
Armenia's ranking on "Transparency of Government Policy Making" (from 103th to 16 th)
compared to 2008-09, and noticeable gains on the "Wastefulness of Government Spending"
(from 7 7th 
to 4 5th), "Diversion of Public Funds" (from 1 1 0 th to 
8 1th), and "Judicial

Independence" (from 12 3th to 11 0 th)

* Knowledge Economy and Competitiveness. Progress was made towards four key goals: (i)
fostering the e-economy and technological progress through improved access to computers
and internet, e-services in the public sector, business incubators, techno-parks and technology
transfer centers attached to universities; (ii) fostering private sector competitiveness and
development, including improved PPP framework, corporate and SME financial reporting
standards, access to finance, streamlining of regulatory requirements in tax administration,
customs, permits, inspections, and business registration, legal framework for competition and
proper enforcement; (iii) modernizing infrastructure, with a focus on road improvement,
energy efficiency, renewable energy generation, access to and safety of drinking water; and
(iv) better access to and quality of public education in general and higher education in
particular.

III. Evaluation of CPS Program Performance

8. 
This section evaluates the implementation of outcomes and progress made towards the
proposed results indicators. The evolution of the results indicators, milestone progress indicators and
achievement of targets are detailed in Annex 1.A, including the rationale for the CPSPR omitting
some of the initial results indicators, while Annex 1.B summarizes the status of the CPS program
implementation. Results indicators are assessed as Achieved (A), Partly Achieved (PA) or Not
Achieved (NA); pending evaluation is noted as PE. Additional results germane to the respective
outcomes are also presented.

Strategic Objective 1: Addressing Vulnerabilities

Results Area 1: A post-crisis Armenia that regains macro-stability and is poised for high growth
9. 
The CPS program proposed three outcomes monitored by six results indicators, to: (i) address
macroeconomic stresses induced by the crisis and restore sustainable medium-term macroeconomic
stability, (ii) increase public resource mobilization essential to sustainable growth through tax regime
and administration reforms, (iii) manage financial sector risks and vulnerabilities while increasing its
contribution to financing economic growth. All three outcomes were achieved.

10. 
Macro-stability was restored. Armenia met and exceeded CPS targets. Economic growth
picked up steadily in 2010-12 and recouped the sharp GDP drop of over 14 percent in 2009. Growth
averaged 4.7 percent per annum, reached 7.2 percent in 2012, and is expected to continue at around 5
percent per annum over the medium-term. Growth was fueled by tradable sectors, mainly food

45

products, beverages, mining, and manufacturing. The slowdown in food prices due to agricultural
output growth helped bring inflation to 3.2 percent at end-2012 reversing the 2010-11 inflationary
pressures due to rising prices for imported staples (e.g., sugar), pharmaceuticals, and medical
services. 2012 exports were about 47 percent higher than in 2008 in spite of the 24 percent slump
recorded in 2009, reducing the current account deficit to an estimated 10.8 percent, below the 11.8
percent level of 2008. The cash fiscal deficit was brought at 1.7 percent of GDP in 2012, below the
historical level of around 2 percent of GDP, after reaching 7.6 percent of GDP in 2009. Public debt is
significantly higher than before the crisis at about 44 percent of GDP in 2012 compared with 16.4
percent in 2008; however, its growth has stabilized and its level is deemed by the IFIs to be
sustainable.

11. 
Tax revenue increased. Tax revenue (including social contributions and deducting VAT
refunds) would meet the 2013 target of 22 percent of GDP, reaching 21.5 percent of GDP in 2012 and
a projected 22.2 percent of GDP in 2013. Substantive tax regime changes included a new mining
royalty, increased income and payroll taxes on high-income earners, higher excise and presumptive
taxes for alcohol, tobacco, luxury vehicles and other goods, higher presumptive taxes on casinos and
restaurants, and more stringent transfer pricing and capitalization provisions. In partnership with the
State Revenue Committee, IFC prepared a comprehensive Tax Compliance Cost Survey (TCCS)
under the Armenia Regulatory Simplification and Doing Business Reform Project (2008-11).

12. 
Recommendations from the TCCS formed the basis for tax administration reforms,
including risk-based management in tax and customs departments, tax e-filing, and creation of tax-
payers service centers and a tax appeals committee. The impact of these measures on tax revenues has
been slower than anticipated, due mainly to capacity constraints which the FY10 IDF Grant for
Improving Fiscal Management and Tax Compliance Capacity could alleviate only in part. Tax
collection remains 4-6 percent below regional and international comparators. Another important issue
is the intentional under-reporting of taxable income by companies in the real sector, many of which
allegedly have links to politically exposed individuals. Ambiguous and opaque procedures applied at
Armenian customs often result in failure to honor genuine invoices for assessment of customs duties
and taxes and application of controversial reference-price based system for customs clearance creates
systemic corruption risks and favors economic agents who abuse political and administrative powers.
Armenia needs to step-up efforts to enhance fiscal revenue mobilization in order to finance
development and prevent higher fiscal gaps as of 2014. The Bank-financed Tax Administration
Modernization Project approved in FY13 builds in part on a number of recommendations from the
TCCS and will contribute to this goal.

13. 
Credit to the economy in general and SMEs in particular increased. The CPS target was
met and exceeded. Proactive steps to tighten the supervision of the banking sector and manage
interest and exchange rates addressed effectively financial vulnerabilities. Credit to the economy
increased by 257 percent in nominal terms between December 2008 and December 2012. The ratio of
loans to GDP (excluding mortgage and consumer loans) increased to 41.2 percent at end-2012,
compared with 10.1 percent in December 2010. The SMEs' demand for credit exceeded expectations.
The Bank-financed project Access to Finance for SMEs extended credits to SMEs totaling US$100
million between April 2009 and December 2012, 66.7 percent more than the CPSPR target of US$60
million for 2012.

14. 
For its own account, IFC invested a total of US$224 million in Armenia's private sector
through direct lending and equity investment and via wholesale financing to financial institutions,
exceeding the upper range of the investment targets set at $160 million in the CPS. IFC provided
US$206 million in credit lines, guarantees and risk management products to banks and non-bank
financial institutions serving an MSME clientele seeking access to traditional loans, as well as trade,

46

residential and industrial energy efficiency, renewable energy, and agri-finance products. At end-
2011, IFC's portfolio clients in the banking sector held outstanding MSME portfolio of US$475
million in 58,735 loans. IFC's Armenia Microfinance Program (2009-12) increased access to finance
for micro-entrepreneurs and small business owners. Over three years, Inecobank, the participating
financial institution, originated 101,160 micro loans of which 84% (84,486 loans) were originated in
rural parts of Armenia,

15. 
IFC worked with the Central Bank of Armenia to establish the National Mortgage
Company (Armenia Banking Market Development Project, 2009-12), which has refinanced more
than US$55 million in mortgage loans for 3280 borrowers. At the onset of the crisis, IFC refocused
work under the project to improve risk and distressed asset management frameworks and practices in
the financial sector. The Project worked with ASHIB, Anelik and Ameriabank, which control roughly
25% of the total assets of the sector. The Project banks granted about 600,000 loans with a total
volume of about US$ 1.4 billion during the project period, which resulted in a 76% portfolio increase.
The project also initiated a certification program for risk professionals with the Global Association of
Risk Professionals (GARP). Public outreach activities related to loan resolution strategies and risk
management complemented these initiatives and were carried out under IFC's regional ECA FM
Crisis Management Program (2009-13).

Results Area 2: Adverse poverty impact limited amidst assured health and social protection

16. 
The CPS program proposed three outcomes monitored through six results indicators to: (i)
mitigate the crisis-induced poverty impact through job creation and social assistance benefits; (ii)
improve the access of the poor to health services; and (iii) provide safe gas-based heating in schools
and for households in multi-apartment buildings. From the three outcomes two were partly achieved
and one was fully achieved.

17. 
Poverty was mitigated by job-creation programs and improved poverty targeting. The
CPS targets were partially achieved. Job generation by road rehabilitation, community development
and rural sector projects, intended to forestall the erosion of poverty reduction gains achieved by
Armenia before the crisis, was significant. IDA fast track operations for Lifeline Roads Improvement,
the Social Investment Fund, Irrigation Rehabilitation Emergency, and Rural Enterprise and Small
Scale Agriculture generated about 73,000 person/months of temporary jobs by March 2013, against a
CPSPR end-target of 60,000 person/months. The Government aimed to improve the targeting of
social assistance through elimination of ineligible recipients of family benefits and by increasing the
share of transfers benefitting the poorest quintile. Progress notwithstanding, the proposed target of
reducing ineligible beneficiaries to 20 percent has not been fully met. While 58.8 percent of transfers
go to the poorest quintile, according to the June 2012 Poverty Update the coverage of the poor
remains low at 25.6 percent in 2011. Expenditure for social protection increased from 6 percent of
GDP in 2008 to 7.3 percent in 2012, after peaking at 7.8 percent in the 2009 crisis year. Family
benefits increased from 1 percent of GDP in 2008 to 1.2 percent of GDP in 2012.

18. 
Better access of the poor to health care. The CPS targets were partly achieved. The
Development Policy Operations (DPO2 and DPO3) supported the introduction of performance-based
contracting for primary health care and a co-payment system. Increased hospital reimbursement
helped reduce OOPs from almost 51 percent in 2008 to 38.4 percent in 2011, and access to qualified
family practices for basic health care services increased from 85 percent of population in 2010 to 95
percent as of April 2013. In-patient services for the poorest income quintile increased from 3.5
percent in 2008 to 3.8 percent in 2011; financing constraints will prevent Armenia from reaching the
CPS target of 5.5 percent in 2013. The Government approved in 2011 a national framework strategy
for prevention and control of non-communicable diseases 
(NCDs), and sub-strategies 
for

47

cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and cancer. The implementation of this strategy will be supported
by the FY13 Disease Prevention and Control Project.

19. 
Safer gas-based heating in schools and multi-apartment buildings was expanded. The
CPS targets were met. By end-2011 the Bank-financed Urban Heating Project had rehabilitated safe
gas-based heating of 120 schools (of which 7 special schools for children with disabilities), extended
loans to 7,225 urban households to purchase safe gas-based heaters or boilers for their apartments,
and provided capital grants to 8,265 poor urban households to give them access to the gas network
or/and verify safe gas-based heating. As of 2009/10 around 70 percent of households in urban multi-
apartments buildings had access to safe gas-based or hot water-based heating, compared with 45
percent in 2007. Safety improved, with incidence of carbon monoxide poisoning reduced from 37 per
10,000 connections in 2005 to 10 in 2011. Client surveys indicated that all schools benefitting from
rehabilitation of their heating systems and 91 percent of the urban poor who received grants for
connection to the gas network were satisfied with the outcome.

Results Area 3: Rural and environmental risks decrease

20. 
The CPS program proposed four outcomes monitored through nine results indicators, to: (i)
rehabilitate 
irrigation systems; (ii) increase rural productivity and output; (iii) update mining
legislation; and (iv) enhance preparedness for handling natural disasters. Two outcomes were
achieved and two were partly achieved.

21. 
Irrigation infrastructure was rehabilitated. The CPS target of a 7,300 ha increase in
irrigable area (from 128,750 ha in 2009 to 136,050 ha in 2012) was exceeded. Between October 2009
and June 2011 the Bank-financed Irrigation Rehabilitation Emergency Project restored irrigation
potential on about 8,000 ha; an additional 6,500 ha were restored by end-FY13 with support from the
Irrigation Additional Financing operation. Actual use of the irrigation potential hinges on the
farmers' ability to carry out productive investments. Water losses were cut by about two-thirds, from
22.5 percent in 2009 to an estimated 6-7 percent in 2013.

22. 
Rural productivity gains were pursued. CPS targets on increased milk productivity and
effectiveness of communal pasture management have been partly met. The Bank-financed CARMAC
project supports productivity gains for cattle and sheep through reduced livestock disease prevalence
and improved effectiveness of communal pasture management. Progress to date is expressed in a
score of 34.5 compared to zero in 2008.12 Milk productivity gains cannot be assessed in the short-
term, but are projected by CARMAC at 20 percent over the medium-term. IFC's Armenia Food
Safety Project (2011-2014) introduces risk based inspections of food producers and helps them
implement food safety management systems in order to increase competitiveness, attract investment
and broaden market access. Results to date include increased awareness about food safety through
training more than 400 market participants, improved local consulting capacity through training, and
implementation of food safety management systems with food processors to encourage replication.

23. 
Mining legislation was updated in compliance with international standards. The CPS
targets were met. A new Mining Code and Amendments to the Natural Resource User Fee were
adopted by the National Assembly in December 2011 and promulgated by the President. The
Government also adopted the subsidiary legislation needed for the implementation of the Code. The
new legislation is expected to attract private investment, streamline the management of environmental
and social impact assessments, and enhance public disclosure. The Bank's efforts on the mining law
were complemented by IFC investments in mining. Over the CPS period, IFC has made equity

made the first new discovery of gold in Armenia since independence and IFC has provided the
company with assistance to develop the mine in accordance with IFC Environmental and Social
Standards.

24. 
Improved emergency preparedness, management of disasters and retrofitting of public
buildings. This CPS outcome was only partly achieved. The GFDRR-financed report on Disaster
Risk Reduction and Emergency Management in Armenia recommended short-, medium- and long-
term actions towards reducing the risk of and mitigating the impact of natural disasters. Armenia
postponed a decision to join the South-Eastern European Countries Catastrophe Risk Insurance
Facility (SEEC CRIF), a catastrophe and weather-risk re-insurance facility, pending an assessment of
the performance of this facility. The Government took a major step towards developing selection
criteria for retrofitting key public buildings at risk with support from the GFDRR-financed
Institutional Arrangements for Disaster Risk Management in Armenia operation. However, no
financial sources were identified for the retrofitting program. Another GFDRR-financed technical
assistance operation has been approved to undertake vulnerability assessment of schools with the aim
to catalyzing contributions from other development partners and preparing a potential Bank project.

A. Strategic Objective 2: Strengthening Competitiveness for Post-Crisis Growth

Results Area 4: Strengthening governance with resulting rise in public sector efficiency

25. 
The CPS program proposed three outcomes monitored through seven results indicators to: (i)
improve governance by reducing conflict of interest and fostering fair competition; (ii) facilitate
taxpayers' tax compliance; and (iii) strengthen the functioning of courts, civil service performance,
and public financial management. These objectives were partially achieved, reflecting satisfactory
outputs, on the one hand, but unmet desired outcomes, on the other hand.

26. 
Legislation on conflict of interest and competition was updated. The CPS targets were
nominally met, though important challenges remain in actual implementation. First, Armenia enacted
in 2011 a Law on Public Service that clarified the interpretation of the conflicts of interest for public
officials and established in January 2012 an Ethics Commission for High Level Public Officials. The
2011 income and asset declarations of 698 out of the 700 officials requested by Law to submit such
declarations were filed and posted on the Ethics Commission website - a 99.7 percent compliance
rate compared to the CPS target of 100 percent for 2013. However, the Law has several drawbacks:
(i) it does not specify penalties to apply for false declarations or failure to file a declaration; (ii) it
leaves at the Government's discretion the publication of financial disclosures; and (iii) it has a limited
coverage. Moreover, the quality and reliability of the declarations submitted is at times questionable.
Second, in 2009 the Government approved an Anti-Corruption Strategy for 2009-12. The Strategy
was not updated or extended beyond 2012. And third, a new Competition Law promulgated in April
2011 gave a clearer mandate to address discriminatory treatment by government officials and
potential distortions stemming from state aid to enterprises. Implementation of the new legislation is
hampered, however, by the assessment of market dominance, the structure of fines, mergers and
concentrations, and excessive focus on price levels rather than anti-competitive conduct. Challenges
notwithstanding, Armenia made progress towards better rule of law towards business conflict
resolution. Armenia's Global Competitiveness Index (GCI) increased from 3.7 to 4.0 between
2008/09 and 2011/12, and its ranking improved from the 8th decile to the 6th decile of the 144
countries surveyed. The rating of the efficiency of the legal framework in settling disputes and in
challenging regulations improved from 78.9 percent of the GCI mean value in 2008/09 to 94.7

49

percent in 2011/12.13 Bank instruments such as DPO series and PSMP contributed to the above
results.

27. 
Taxpayer access to revenue administration was improved. The CPSPR updated the results
indicators to focus on increased use of risk-based management for customs declarations, e-filing of
tax returns, and use of risk-based inspections, objectives pursued jointly by the Bank's DPO and
IFC's Armenia Regulatory Simplification and Doing Business Project (2009-11) and its successor
project, the Armenia Investment Climate Reform Project (2011-14).

* 

IFC helped the Customs Service and Ministry of Economy prepare an Import/Export Process
Map which identified ways to simplify customs and technical control procedures and reduce
related costs for businesses. Reforms included an August 2010 Decree which provided the
needed legislative framework for the Customs Green Channel operation, including the
incorporation of the signature module in the Trade World Manager software. In 2011, the
Customs Service introduced electronic self-declarations desks and the risk management
system. The capacity of Customs to enforce compliance was strengthened through adoption
of amendments to the Customs Code in January 2011. In 2012, the Green Channel was fully
functional and operated clearance by default, backed by post-release verification, controls,
audits and investigations, clearing 70.1 percent of the customs declarations.

* The introduction of e-filing of tax returns was facilitated by amendments to the Tax Law in
2009. As of end-2012 7,367 VAT payers e-filed returns (24.3 percent of the total number of
legal entities active taxpayers), compared with none in 2008 and with a CPSPR target of
3,000 e-returns. The amendments adopted in June 2011 to the Law on Organizing and
Conducting Inspections have curtailed discretionary practices and improved business
perception about the behavior of revenue agencies. The State Revenue Agency is posting its
annual plan of tax inspections on the Web.

* The 2013 Doing Business survey provides additional indicators on progress: (i) Armenia's
overall ranking in the "paying taxes" area improved from 152 in 2012 to 107; (ii) the annual
number of tax payments was drastically reduced from 50 to 13 and the annual time needed to
pay taxes was shorten from 581 to 380 hours in 2006-11, following a Government decision in
2012 to reduce the number of tax payments for social security contributions, corporate
income, property and land taxes, and other major taxes. The DPO series contributed to the
above results.

28. 
The functioning of Courts, civil service management, and public financial management
(PFM) were strengthened. The majority of the eight original CPS targets on public financial
management and civil service performance were fully or substantially met by mid-2011, and the
CPSPR focused more on the functioning of the judiciary and corporate financial management.
Progress on PFM was based on a Decree on a Public Financial Management Strategy, and included:
(i) 
increased capacity of public administration for strategic planning, policy formulation and
performance management; (ii) introduction of a performance management system in the Government
Office and six pilot ministries, subsequently rolled out in the Civil Service system, comprised of
around 45 public entities; (iii) enactment of legislation on auditing and accounting standards
consistent with best international practice, including a new Law on Internal Auditing, and piloting of
redesigned fiduciary controls over non-commercial entities; (iv) design and introduction of an e-
procurement system piloted 
in 2012 with the support of the Bank-financed Public Sector
Modernization Project. Additional efforts are needed to address the limitations observed during

13 World Economic Forum, The Global Competitiveness Reports 2008-2009 and 2012-2013.

50

piloting; (v) preparation of the Budget in programmatic format as of 2010. Every December the
Ministry of Finance (MoF) puts online the program for tax returns to be audited. Civil service
performance was enhanced by merit-based appointments. The CPSPR proposed targets on improved
functioning of the judiciary were met: (i) all 48 Courts are connected to the Judicial Decision
Database - Court Automation and Skills Transfer (JDD/CAST) system and equipped with the
DataLex kiosks, and 38 courts are equipped with Case Recording Systems (CRS); (ii) the DataLex
kiosks disseminate the legal decisions of the higher courts and facilitate the practice of judicial
precedent.

Results Area 5: Strengthening knowledge and competitiveness.

29. 
The CPS program proposed seven outcomes monitored through 21 results indicators, to: (i)
foster the knowledge economy; (ii) encourage Public-Private Partnership (PPP); (iii) improve roads;
(iv) increase renewable energy generation and energy efficiency, and reduce transmission losses; (v)
improve access to and quality of drinking water; (vi) enhance the access of the private sector to
finance; and (vii) improve access to and quality of education. All seven outcomes were achieved.

30. 
The knowledge economy was fostered by measures to enhance e-government and
infrastructure, and modernize accounting and auditing practices. Internet access improved
markedly, from 18 percent in 2008 to 52 percent at end-2012. In November 2012 35 percent of
households had home computers, compared with 25 percent in 2008. E-services provided by public
entities increased: 531,007 tax returns were e-filed in 2012 compared with none in 2008; registration
of new firms has been facilitated by electronic linking of the one-stop Yerevan shop for business
registration to other municipalities, reducing registration time from 20 to 2 days; and e-kiosks and e-
portals improved efficiency of customs declarations, as well as access to information in government
and the judiciary. The Bank-financed E-Society and Innovation for Competitiveness project and DPOs
encouraged broadband infrastructure development, strengthening of the regulatory framework and
institutions for public services, and supporting development of Gyumri Techno Park. Quality
standards for accounting were improved through introduction of International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRS) and International Standards of Auditing (ISA) starting in 2009 in the banking sector
and gradually instituted in other sectors. Implementation is hampered by capacity constraints. The IT
workforce increased from 5,000 in 2008 to 9,354 as of end-2012. The Global Competitiveness Report
noted significant gains between 2008/09 and 2012/13 with regard to technological readiness,
including e-access, FDI technology transfer, firm-level technology absorption, and availability of the
latest technologies.

31. 
The PPP framework of the knowledge economy was strengthened. Following the
Government's decision in September 2011 to lease free bandwidth of public fixed-line telephone
network to private operators, the number of wireless Internet providers increased by about 19 times
and the monthly cost of broadband access reduced by 60.2 percent compared to 2008 as of end-2012.
By January 2010 an additional 85,000 households gained access to basic telephone service. One
Techno-park, one Business Incubator and one university-based Technology Transfer Center were
established as of end-2012. 14

32. 
Secondary roads were rehabilitated. Since 2009, 433 km of secondary roads were
rehabilitated with the support of the Bank-financed Lifeline Roads Improvement Project (LRIP) and
two additional financing operations. The objective of the LRIP was to stimulate economic growth and
contribute to poverty reduction by helping improve 430 km priority roads from the 4,000 km lifeline

14 PPPs in operation include the Bank-financed municipal water projects, the Yerevan airport, and the Tatev
Revival Project.

51

roads network identified by the Government, which ensures access to all 960 communities in
Armenia. The LRIP fostered local employment and reduced journey time for road users: between
2009 and 2012 the LRIP created 33,647 person-months of temporary jobs and reduced the journey
time by 36.8 percent.

33. 
Renewable energy generation and energy efficiency 
increased. The CPS objectives of
improved generation of renewable energy and increased efficiency of energy transmission were partly
met. In 2012 the 220 MW capacity of renewable energy generation was 64.2 percent higher than in
2008, but transmission losses of 1.9 percent were actually higher than in 2008 (1.5 percent) as
transmission lines got older and line rehabilitation works underway have yet to be completed. The
rehabilitation of gas heating systems for schools together with other energy efficiency measures led to
energy savings estimated at 30-40 percent in 13 schools. In the private sector, IFC's Sustainable
Energy Finance Project worked with HSBC Armenia to build capacity to finance energy efficiency
investments by SMEs. IFC also provided a US$22 million senior loan, augmented by US$8 million in
co-financing from the Canada Climate Change Program, which helped to finance seven energy
efficiency projects with expected energy savings of 8,339 MWh/y and greenhouse gas (GHG)
emissions avoidance of 1,245 tCO2e annually. The project also provided advice and a US$10 million
senior loan to Byblos Bank Armenia to support residential energy efficiency financing and general
mortgage lending. IFC's Sustainable Energy Finance Project also helped Ameriabank CJSC build
capacity to finance renewable energy projects and provided a US$15 million senior loan to the bank,
financing twelve small hydropower plants with installed capacity of 40.1 MW, generation of 124.9
GWh of electric energy and expected GHG emissions avoidance of 49,964 tCO2e annually.

34. 
Supply, quality and cost recovery of water supply improved. The quality, reliability, and
efficiency of water supply services improved for Yerevan and AWSC service areas with the support
of several Bank-financed water supply projects. Over 332,000 households in Yerevan and 264,000
households in other towns benefitted from improvements in the duration of water supply and water
quality. As of end-2011 88.8 percent of the Yerevan consumers had 21.3 hours/day of water supply,
compared with 75.5 percent of consumers receiving 18.1 hours/day of water supply in 2008.
Considerable progress was made in delivery of water services in small and medium-size towns of
Armenia, where 62.6 percent of consumers had 15 hours/day of water supply as of end-February
2012, compared to 12 hours/day in 2008. Water bacteriological safety exceeded targeted standards,
reaching 99.5 percent in Yerevan and 98.2 percent in the AWSC service area as of end-201 1.
Revenue collection in the AWSC service area increased from 48 percent in 2008 to 100.8 percent as
of end-February 2012. The public/private approach piloted on water and sanitation has been
innovative and has delivered substantial results. The Bank-financed water projects are among the
pioneer projects in Europe and Central Asia (ECA) in terms of successful public-private partnership
(PPP). It is a success story of evolving from management contract to lease contract through well-
grounded sector reform agenda and continued improvement in service delivery.

35. 
Access to education is improving, and quality standards in higher education were
enhanced. Armenia achieved virtually all the targets set under the CPS program: (i) enrollment of
preschool-age children increased from 31 percent in 2008/09 to 75 percent in 2012/13. With the
support of the Bank-financed Second Education Quality and Relevance (APL2) Project implemented
during 2010-12 6,000 children were enrolled in 193 preschools. 1,500 more children are expected to
enroll in 2013/14 as 70 new schools would be created; (ii) a Student Financial Support Program
regulation was approved by the Government and 1,000 needy university students are expected to
qualify for assistance in the 2013/14 academic year. Their number would gradually increase to 2,500
by 2015; (iii) a student loan program had been envisaged under the Bank-financed APL2. At the
Government's request, this initiative was replaced by an agreement reached by the Authorities with
the Armenian Banks Association on extension of student loans partly subsidized by the State, starting

52

in the academic year 2013-14; (iv) public funding for competitive innovation in higher education will
be provided under the APL2 project; (v) progress was made in improving the quality assurance
standards of universities through legislation approved in 2012 on their accreditation, evaluation
against the new standards, and support for the establishment or improvement of internal quality
assurance units.

IV. 

Bank Performance

36. 
The World Bank Group's overall performance has been rated Satisfactory. The CPS
design was consistent with Armenia's development goals, provided an adequate framework for the
WBG's operations and advisory activities, had a clear architecture and explicit monitorable targets,
took into account the country's capacity for implementation, and proved resilient to the challenge of a
global crisis that was more pervasive and longer than originally expected. The CPS was effectively
managed through budget support, financing of critical investment projects, and provision of just-in-
time capacity building and technical advice. The WBG carried out a constructive and effective
dialogue with the Authorities, responded promptly to evolving circumstances and country demands,
and coordinated well with other IFIs and bilateral partners.

37. 

CPS quality at entry was adequate:

* The CPS design responded to the country priorities. It was fully aligned with the SDP and its
comprehensive policy agenda which covered over 10 themes. Retaining all these themes in
the CPS program was justified by the state of development of the Armenian economy, its
fragile governance and policy-making process, 
its weak institutional capacity, and the
Government's request for Bank's hand-holding support across sectors as a means to build
sustainable capacity. The Authorities also valued 
the Bank's convening role among
development partners as a further justification of its involvement in many areas. While
keeping the CPS's two strategic objectives, the CPSPR promoted greater selectivity by
deepening engagement (including through additional financing and repeater projects) and
increasing the average size of operations in order to achieve greater impact.

* The selection of areas and instruments for Bank assistance built on past lending and
comparative advantage. The CPS built on the four policy-based Poverty Reduction Support
Credits (PRSC) operations, the investment project portfolio and AAA activities implemented
in FY05-0815 , and complemented the IMF-supported and other donors' assistance programs.

* The Results Framework was well aligned with the two key objectives and five results areas of
the CPS. The expected outcomes and results proved to be realistic, as evidenced by the
proportion achieved or on track by May 2013: 90 percent of the 20 outcomes and of the 48
CPSPR results 
indicators were achieved 
fully or substantially. These substantial
achievements reflected the Government's strong commitment to reforms and its track record
of implementation. They corroborated Armenia's consistent ranking among the top IDA
performers as measured by the CPIA. However, the Results Framework would have benefited
from a more realistic assessment of outcome indicators, excluding higher SDP goals and
indicators not entirely attributable to the WBG-supported program which may otherwise
overstate the role and impact of the Bank on progress towards country goals.

* Critical risks were clearly identified at entry and were mitigated in part by: the Government's
counter-cyclical 
fiscal, monetary and borrowing policies; progress on economic and
institutional reforms; and financial and advisory support extended by the Bank Group in close
collaboration with other partners.

15 See CASCR for FYO5-08 (CPS FYO9-12, Annex 1).

53

38. 
Implementation of the CPS program was efficient. The Bank Group deployed its mix of
instruments of engagement in a timely fashion, with effective synergy between the Bank and IFC:

* Financial support to Armenia's macroeconomic stabilization and development agenda.
Respondents in the November 2012 Country Survey ranked financial assistance as the most
important contribution of the Bank 
to Armenia. IBRD/IDA exceeded planned new
commitments to Armenia over the FYO9-13 period by 7.3 percent, totaling US$686.6 million.
(Table 3). During this period the Board approved 16 new projects and 10 additional
financings for ongoing projects (the CPS and CPSPR had proposed 27 operations). Lending
included three DPOs for US$165 million in budget support. Ten of the 23 investment
operations consisted of additional financing of ongoing projects, to address the need for faster
response to Armenia's financial constraints.

* Financial support to the private sector. IFC investment over the five year CPS period was
greater than in the preceding 14 years. IFC invested US$224 million during FYO9-13 through
34 operations in the banking sector and in the leasing, mining, real estate, agriculture and
energy sectors. Investment operations were complemented by advisory focused on business
climate reform (including permits and inspections related to food safety), risk and NPL
management 
in the banking sector, capacity building in the microfnance sector, and
development of the market for sustainable energy. Advisory activities were supported by
donor funding equivalent to US$5.48 million over the CPS period, plus IFC contribution of
US$1.39 million. IFC investment in the financial sector leveraged credit extension to SMEs
and farmers: as of end-201 1 IFC portfolio clients in the banking sector held outstanding SME
loans totaling US$392 million and micro-finance loans totaling US$83 million. IFC invested
US$47 million to finance renewable energy generation (primarily small hydro-power) and
energy efficiency renovations of residential buildings, supported development of the mining
sector, and invested in business infrastructure by financing completion of high quality
commercial real estate. The IFC Global Trade Finance Program provided US$85 million in
guarantees, of which US$75 million to import energy efficient machinery and materials.

* Capacity building and technical assistance. The CPS did not discuss explicitly capacity
implementation constraints. However, analytical and advisory work provided by both IBRD
and IFC was supplemented by an extensive capacity building program. During FY09-13 the
Bank implemented 16 IDF/TF operations totaling US$7.7 million, which complemented the
technical assistance provided under investment projects. IFC implemented seven country-
specific advisory projects and programs, supported by US$4.9 million in donor funding, plus
IFC contribution of US$1.38 million. IFC's advisory programs in Armenia are closely linked
with investment operations.

54

* Knowledge-based activities. Policy dialogue with the Authorities was underpinned by tasks
initiated before FY09 (at least 11 studies and reviews), as well as by some 22 tasks initiated
in FYO9-13 (Annex 3d). Knowledge-based AAA activities were particularly intensive during
the first part of the cycle (FYO9-1 1), as the Bank responded to Armenia's demand for policy
advice on urgent reforms. The tasks were germane to Armenia's priorities (and implicitly to
the CPS program), and provided analysis and policy recommendations on poverty alleviation,
economic growth, financial intermediation, public financial management, development of key
sectors, environmental management, governance, and other areas. Programmatic assessments
were carried out annually for poverty, public expenditure and the financial sector. Policy
notes and a high level policy forum addressed the new government's need for information
and advice. The Country Survey ranked capacity building, 
technical assistance and
knowledge transfer as the second most important contribution of the Bank.

* 

Synergy of Bank and IFC programs. Bank synergy and complementarity with IFC was
strong: in mining, Bank work on legislation (including environmental management) paved the
way for IFC investment in mining; in energy, the IFC Sustainable Energy Finance Project
supports common program goals on energy efficiency and renewable energy generation; in
agriculture, the Bank-financed CARMAC project for structural transformation of subsistence
farming 
is complemented by the IFC Food Safety Improvement Project that supports
competitiveness and market access; in health, the Bank and IFC are jointly advising the
Government on improving delivery of oncology services and exploring PPP opportunities; in
the financial sector, the two institutions joined forces to help Armenia mitigate the effects of
the financial crisis and provide financing for MSMEs; in the area of the investment climate,
Bank support for tax and customs reform and business climate improvement are closely
linked to IFC advisory programs described above.

* Support for project implementation. The annual Reviews of Portfolio Performance gave
Armenia consistent high marks on portfolio implementation, disbursements, and results on
the ground. Procurement and financial management of the portfolio is satisfactory overall.
The portfolio disbursement ratio averaged 53.6 percent in FYO9-13, compared to the ECA
average ratio of 20.3 percent. There are no projects at risk. The realism index of the portfolio
is 100 percent, and the average project age is 3.4 years. While the Country Survey noted
stakeholders' perception of the Bank's slow, complex and bureaucratic policies, procedures
and processes, these issues are generic and not specific to Armenia's program. IFC's
investment portfolio was US$146.5 million committed (of which US$126.5 million were
disbursed and outstanding) in 28 projects with 11 clients. IFC's investment portfolio has
grown 235% over the CPS period, maintaining strong performance with no non-performing
loans, realized net equity gains of US$16.8 million and total unrealized gains on equity
investments of US$8.2 million.

* Effectiveness of the dialogue with Authorities and other stakeholders. The WBG has
maintained an open and constructive dialogue with the Authorities and other stakeholders.
The Bank dialogue with government counterparts has been effective and included regular
joint supervision of projects and joint reviews of portfolio implementation. Policy seminars
and via round table discussions, dissemination of AAA via workshops and seminars, and
public dissemination of Bank reports both through publication and media have been useful
for awareness arising and knowledge building. The 2012 Country Survey rated highly the
contribution of knowledge 
transfers 
through Internet, 
television, and Bank-organized
seminars, workshops and conferences. Donor coordination was good but could be enhanced
through instituting financing of joint projects. A joint FSAP was conducted with IMF in
2012. Water sector and transport sector reforms were coordinated with ADB and EBRD.
Judicial and civil service reforms were coordinated with the EU. Regulatory reforms related

55

to business inspections implemented with support from IFC's Investment Climate Reform
Program were closely coordinated with the EBRD; tax reforms were coordinated with the
IMF; customs reforms were coordinated with the EU. USAID is a key partner in supporting
Government's broader health reforms agenda and a partner for the Regulatory Guillotine
Reform Project supported by a Donor Consortium.

* Mitigation of risks. The WBG addressed proactively risks to the implementation of the
country strategy. Political risks were partly mitigated through activities such as the High
Level Policy Forum organized for the new Government that took office in 2010 dialogue with
senior Government officials. Capacity constraints were mitigated by capacity building IDFs
and TFs, advisory work delivered through ESW, IFC advisory, workshops and seminars, and
TA and capacity building components of Bank-financed projects. Portfolio implementation
risks were addressed by the Country Program and Results Review which assessed the
contribution of Bank-financed projects to the achievement of CPS goals and results
indicators, and helped identify and address proactively portfolio generic and project specific
issues. Mid-term portfolio reviews complemented close project monitoring through regular
joint supervision and emphasized 
issues of quality and sustainability. IFC carried out
quarterly portfolio reviews complemented by close project supervision. Fiduciary risks were
partly mitigated by CPAR and CFAA activities, the initiation of joint fiduciary (procurement
and financial management) reviews in most of the projects, and regular project support
missions carried out by Bank teams.

* 

Independent assessment of project design and implementation performance. The
Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) evaluated four projects (Social Investment Fund, Public
Sector Modernization, Urban Heating and Avian Influenza Preparedness). IEG ratings
highlighted concerns with the quality of entry, quality of supervision, achievement of
outcomes and monitoring and evaluation. The Urban Heating project was the only one of the
four to receive satisfactory ratings across the board.

* Recognition of IDA Replenishment Guidelines. The IDA16 Replenishment approved in
February 2011 retained the four "special themes" of crises response, gender, climate change,
and fragile and conflict affected countries within the overarching development results theme.
The approval of IDA16 practically coincided with the mid-term review of the CPS.
Retrofitting the country program to reflect the "special themes" was not feasible. However, it
should be noted that the CPS program addressed well the "crises response" theme through
emergency projects, additional financings with an accelerated processing schedule, and an
overall increase in lending; the "climate resilient development" theme was partly addressed
through support for energy savings, renewable energy generation, and increased use of gas
heating in schools and apartment buildings; and the "fragile and conflict affected countries"
theme was not applicable to Armenia; the "gender mainstreaming" theme was not specifically
addressed. The new CPS for FY14-17 will address these themes and the IDA17 guidelines
more explicitly.

V. Key Lessons and Suggestions

39. 
The November 2012 Stakeholder Survey acknowledged the Bank's contribution and
provided constructive criticism and suggestions. The Survey confirmed the Bank Group's
important role in supporting economic growth and education, but noted the need for increased
contributions to governance and anti-corruption, private sector development, and job creation.
Lending, technical assistance, and knowledge services were seen as the WBG's greatest strengths,
while cumbersome and slow lending procedures and not sufficiently innovative knowledge services

56

were considered its greatest weaknesses. Respondents noted the need for increasing stakeholder
participation and outreach (see Annex G for a summary of the Survey).

40. 
The key lessons stemming from the review of the FYO9-13 Bank program and from
feedback provided by Armenian counterparts and external partners include:
* Continued support from the World Bank Group and other development partners
remains critical. Armenia made significant progress during FYO9-13, but faces important
challenges. Many of the results achieved under the FYO9-13 CPS are enabling steps for future
results on the ground. Legislative and institutional initiatives, enabling investment, piloting of
reforms, capacity building activities and other similar measures are opening the way for
competitiveness gains, growth and poverty reduction, but will require further strong
Government action and financial and technical support from the World Bank Group and other
partners.
* Fostering consensus on reforms and overcoming resistance from vested interests were
key ingredients of the CPS implementation success. The WBG used a multiples channels
of communication and knowledge sharing to reach out to different stakeholders, including
senior-level policy seminars, public workshops, donor meetings, dissemination of analytical
work through publications, discussions, internet and the media, and consultation of project
beneficiaries. This was effective to mitigate political and program implementation risks,
notably within government. Looking forward, the WBG should step-up these efforts and
further reach out to lawmakers, local government officials, and other domestic stakeholders.
* The CPS success also owed 
to efficient collaboration and synergy with other
development partners. Donor dialogue is good. During the CPS period stronger partnerships
were built and led to joint-programs which are likely to expand further under the new CPS.
To succeed however, it is important to devise more predictable arrangements for burden-
sharing and effective division of labor among partners, and to strengthen the Government's
capacity and role in donor coordination.
* Armenia's capacity for strategic planning, coordination of sector initiatives, dialogue
with external partners and domestic stakeholders, and monitoring of outcomes needs to
be reinforced. The Government's development strategy has yet to be expressed 
in
operational terms that would both guide public expenditure policies, and provide donors with
explicit guidance on Armenia's investment priorities to avoid duplication of efforts and
ensure better synergy of external assistance. This may help increase co-financing of projects
and complementary analytical and advisory activities. The recent decision to transfer to the
Ministry of Finance the responsibility for articulating the national development strategy is a
step in the right direction. However, the capacity of the Government needs to be reinforced in
the areas of inter-sector coordination, coordination of external partners, results monitoring,
and outreach activities.
* Upfront identification of capacity constraints and prompt mitigation are essential.
Capacity building constraints must be identified more clearly by the CPS and mainstreamed
in the country program. An upfront Institutional Assessment would be useful. Just-in-time
recourse to IDF TF support for capacity building, technical assistance, and analytical and
advisory activities can accelerate the implementation of the program and achievement of
results.
* Outcome indicators must be realistic and monitorable. Outcome indicators not directly
attributable to the Bank-supported program may be difficult to evaluate and may overstate the
role and impact of the Bank on progress towards country goals. Monitoring of results by the
Government needs to be strengthened. Interim results including legislative and regulatory

57

initiatives or institutional changes could be identified as milestones rather than results
indicators.
* Harmonization of generic project activities. Project-supported capacity building, IT,
outreach and similar generic activities would benefit from common platforms using existing
operations.
* Harmonization of complementary activities supported by multiple projects. In the rural
sector in particular, projects supporting infrastructure (roads, irrigations) are not always well
integrated with parallel agricultural, education or health projects, sometimes because of
differing rates of economic return in select areas. One option would be upfront integrated
economic analysis of complementary operations.
* Advisory and TA activities could associate more national counterparts and continue
during implementation. Interviews with Government counterparts highlighted the need to
integrate Bank consultants with local teams and follow the impact of their recommendations
during implementation.

17 The PFM project initially scheduled in FY10 under the CPS was intended to cover both tax administration and PFM reforms.
However, during project preparation, the Bank and Government agreed to: (a) process the Tax Administration Modernization
Project separately; it was subsequently approved in FY13; and (b) continue the diagnostic of PFM issues supported by Trust
Fund resources to further inform the preparation of a new PFM project. In fact, this new PFM project is now scheduled in Fy15
under the new CPS FY14-17.
