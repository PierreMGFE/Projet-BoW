PANAMA COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY PROGRESS REPORT

I. 

Introduction

1. 
This Progress Report assesses the implementation of the current joint IBRD-IFC Country
Partnership Strategy (CPS) for Panama for FYI 1-14. The CPS was built around three pillars
aimed to support Panama in addressing its development challenges: (i) economic growth that
builds on Panama's competitive advantages; (ii) providing greater opportunities for all; and
(iii) a transparent and efficient public sector that provides returns to society. The third pillar was
cross-cutting and aimed to support growth and provide for a more efficient and effective public
sector.

2. 
The World Bank Group (WBG) focused within each of these pillars on areas in which it
had a comparative advantage by virtue of prior successfully-implemented programs in Panama or
relevant regional and global expertise. At the same time, the program was intended to be flexible
and responsive to evolving client needs. The CPS envisaged US$400 million in new IBRD
lending commitments by the end of FY12, purposely leaving the program for FY13-14 flexible,
so as to retain the demand-driven aspect of its engagement in Panama.

3. 
During the first part of the CPS period (September 2010-December 2012), Panama
posted some of the highest growth rates among emerging economies, due to massive public
investment in infrastructure, strong growth in many sectors and private consumption. This
growth has promoted "shared prosperity", as poverty and inequality were significantly reduced,
on the back of income growth and substantial public transfers. Considerable reforms have been
achieved (e.g., tax policy and administration, doing business) and progress has been made
towards achieving CPS outcomes, despite a slower-than-anticipated delivery at the start of the
program and subsequent changes in its composition. Some of the outcomes and many milestones
under the three pillars have been met or are on track to be met (e.g., completion of the national
health and disaster risk management plans, recertification of 20 percent of beneficiaries of the
conditional cash transfer (CCT) program, and creation of 59 agricultural productive alliances).

4. 
The original CPS pillars remain valid, though some of the outcomes that the Bank
expected to influence by means of IBRD lending have been achieved through other sources (e.g.,
in the roads sector). Strengthening of social protection systems, basic health services, water and
sanitation in remote rural communities, access of poor urban households to water and sanitation,
agricultural productivity and conservation of forests and biodiversity remain an important part of
the portfolio. At the same time, in line with the increased demand for technical assistance and
advisory services rather than financial support, the envisaged lending program has been scaled
down.

5. 

Knowledge products and advisory and convening services have become an increasingly
important part of IBRD's program to help Panama face its new challenges. An emerging topic
has been adaptation to the approaching change of phase, from the boom of public investment in
infrastructure-especially the expansion of the Panama Canal-to a new phase focusing on
Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) attraction to leverage the operations of the expanded Canal for
sustained shared prosperity. The Bank has delivered well-received work to support this agenda,

1

providing tools to frame a development strategy for the reverted areas around the Canal and
implementation of the maritime and logistics strategy; a study on better jobs and the role of
human capital; and help in organizing high-profile annual investors conferences. This thrust of
Bank support will continue for the remainder of the CPS through policy notes, and other
Analytic and Advisory Activities (AAA).

6. 
The IFC program has focused on fostering further development of Panama's financial
markets and infrastructure through support to micro- and trade finance, cellular networks, clean
energy production, the Panama Canal expansion, and promoting investments oriented to low-
income groups. This engagement has built on synergies with the Bank, specifically on promoting
competitiveness through Doing Business Reform advisory services, technical assistance (TA) to
improve the transparency of the country's tax system and enhance its ability to exchange tax
information to meet the standards of the Global Forum'. IFC's committed portfolio to date is
US$560 million, including US$300 million for the Panama Canal expansion project.

7. 
MIGA has issued a US$320 million guarantee to support financing of the Panama City
metro construction, its first coverage of a sovereign financial obligation in Latin America. Two
advisory services in support of the fiscal sustainability objective-on public debt management
and asset management-are planned by the WB Treasury. The WBG engagement in Panama will
continue to focus on providing tailored support from across the institution.

8. 
One important lesson learned during the implementation of the CPS is that in an upper
middle-income country, knowledge products 
tailored 
to specific country demands and
complemented by development policy lending (DPL), can be a more appropriate and effective
tool than conventional investment loans.

II. Country Context

9. 
Panama's economic growth has been one of the fastest in Latin America over the past
decade, a trend that has even accelerated in recent years. It quickly rebounded from the 2008
global economic crisis, and real gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 7.6 percent in 2010,
reached 10.6 percent in 2011, and is projected at 10.5 percent for 2012. The major drivers of
growth during this period have been massive public investment and private consumption. In
terms of sectors, infrastructure construction has been the main source of growth, helped by
housing construction, retail and wholesale trade, transportation, communications, and tourism.
Growth of domestic credit, export and foreign direct investment also provided important growth
impulses.

10. 
Strong growth and public transfers have translated into impressive poverty reduction. The
poverty rate fell from 48.5 percent in 2002 to 27 percent in 2011, while extreme poverty
decreased from 21 to 11 percent over the same period 2 . Poverty has become more of a rural
phenomenon due to the much larger reductions in poverty in urban areas. The highest incidence
of poverty is observed in the three remote and sparsely populated indigenous areas (comarcas)

1 Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes.
2 Preliminary Government data for 2012 estimates poverty rate at 25.8% and extreme poverty at 10.4%.

2

-Ngobe Bugle, Emberi, and Kuna Yala-containing less than 6 percent of the total population3
but concentrating 16 percent of the poor and 28 percent of the extreme poor. Better targeting of
poverty interventions and providing access to services in isolated communities remain challenges
for the Government's social programs.

11. 
Economic growth has been pro-poor and contributed to more widely shared prosperity.
The growth of the income of households in the bottom forty percent of the income distribution
reached 7.3 percent between 2002 and 2010, far exceeding the average income growth of
4.3 percent over the same period. In addition, a measure of economic growth adjusted for equity
yields a rate of 7.1 percent compared to the 5.8 percent in annualized GDP growth in 2002-2010.
This is due to a decrease in inequality levels, with the Gini coefficient dropping from 0.57 in
2002 to 0.53 in 2011.

12. 
However, Panama's Gini coefficient is still at the mid-range of Latin American countries
and there remains a significant unfinished agenda on social 
inclusion, reducing 
income
inequality and improving service delivery, especially in rural and indigenous areas. Addressing
these challenges would be critical for Panama to converge towards the most advanced countries
in terms of shared prosperity.

13. 
Panama has made substantial progress in integrating into the global economy, leveraging
its unique geographical position and turning into a trade and logistics hub. The expansion of the
Panama Canal has shown significant progress4 , as well as other major infrastructure projects to
increase connectivity and competitiveness 
(e.g., expansion of the 
international airport,
construction of local airports, port facilities, primary and secondary roads, metro in Panama City,
metro bus project, creating cold storage and warehousing to boost agricultural production, etc.).
While the large public investment program has put upward pressure on public expenditures, the
budget deficit has been kept under 3 percent of GDP and overall fiscal sustainability has
improved as public debt decreased from 53 percent of GDP in 2007 to 42 percent of GDP in
2011.

14. 
Tax policy and administration reforms helped increase tax revenues and a new sovereign
wealth fund was set up to ensure that part of the additional revenues from the expanded Canal
will be saved for spending during emergencies or recessions. To improve the efficiency of
public spending, the authorities also implemented important reforms in public procurement and
embarked on reforms to improve service delivery such as the restructuring of the water and
sanitation sector. Panama has been actively developing its domestic capital market by issuing
treasury notes, thus diversifying financing sources and reducing government exposure 
to
refinancing and interest rate risks. Reflecting the strengthening of public finances, low debt, and
a favorable growth outlook, the three major credit rating agencies awarded Panama investment
grade in 2010 and have since further upgraded their ratings. The latest Doing Business Report

Based on the data of Encuesta de Hogares de Panama (household surveys), 2010.
Overall project is at 50 % completion, with most of the dredging works finished. The completion of new locks construction, at
37% now, is expected by April 2015 instead of October 2014, with the expanded Canal fully operational by June 2015.
The sovereign wealth fund is expected to accumulate savings from annual Panama Canal transfers when they exceed 3.5% of
GDP starting in 2015.

15. 
The country has done well in terms of primary education enrollment, which is almost
universal, and has also initiated an early childhood development program. However, the quality
of education, both secondary and tertiary, continues to lag behind the needs of the economy. The
lack of adequate skills, quality of educational outcomes and preparedness of the Panamanians to
join the workforce at the level required by a fast-growing and competitive economy remains a
major challenge. While unemployment is low, at 4.2 percent in 2011, the shortage of qualified
labor is a significant issue for both private and public sectors. As a short-term solution to attract

4

qualified professionals, the Government recently changed the immigration law making it easy for
qualified foreigners to receive resident permits in Panama. However, to ensure medium- and
long-term sustainability, the country needs to embark on education reforms, going beyond
coverage.

16. 
In order to improve transparency and address reputational risks associated with offshore
financial centers, the Government has taken both legislative and institutional actions to
implement the recommendations of the Peer Review of the Global Forum to effectively apply
international tax agreements and exchange information for tax purposes. Some of these actions
included international tax agreements, reforms to the fiscal code, and resolutions to oversee
international taxation. Further steps are needed but the Government's commitment to this
process makes it likely that this outcome will be reached.

III. Relevance of the Country Partnership Strategy

17. 
Overall, the CPS overestimated Government demand for investment lending, and as a
result some of the planned operations did not materialize. This was due to several factors: fast
growth generated higher revenues for own financing; rigorous debt management and fiscal space
limits set by the Social and Fiscal Responsibility Law limited the demand for external financing
from the IBRD and other development partners; the use of country rules for procurement in large
infrastructure projects to fast track implementation precluded the Bank's participation; and in the
social sectors, the Government decided not to borrow for some new projects containing a
substantial recurrent costs component.

18. 
At the same time, the development goals supported by the CPS strategic areas of
engagement remain relevant, as does the CPS overall objective of supporting improvement of
Panama's productive capacity, enhancing public sector efficiency, increasing basic public
services coverage in remote areas and promoting inclusive growth. The continued strategic focus
of the CPS on the three pillars is predicated on the need to further strengthen the foundations for
medium-term competitiveness and growth, especially in terms of sustainability, as well as the
continued mitigation of social vulnerabilities, particularly with regard to the rural and indigenous
population.

19. 
Panama continues to seek Bank support in the priority areas set out in the CPS, with the
exception of the roads sector, where the country was able to expand and upgrade the network
without IBRD financing (e.g., over 58 percent of secondary paved roads are by now in good
condition). Similarly, while the ongoing health and social protection projects have shown
substantial execution, the new lending envisaged in the CPS for these sectors was not requested
by the Government, as it opted not to borrow for recurrent expenditures in light of fiscal
sustainability concerns. The client predominantly used own financing and funds already secured
from other development partners.

20. 
The outlined CPS outcomes, with the exception of those associated with dropped lending
activities, are relevant and will contribute to the country's development goals. They are expected
to be achieved through: (i) 
the implementation of the ongoing projects in the portfolio;
(ii) support to the Government with AAA, non-lending technical assistance and convening

5

services; and (iii) support to institutional reforms through development policy lending (DPL).
Given the political cycle, the Bank will also prepare demand- and supply-driven sector policy
notes and will facilitate the dialogue with all stakeholders to prepare the ground for the Bank's
strategy with the next administration.

21. 
The shift towards knowledge and convening services as the bulk of new activities for the
remainder of the CPS period is presented in detail in Annex 3. In terms of new lending, the
second DPL of the series (US$100 million) will be delivered in FY13, and the third one
(US$50 million) is expected in FY14, with potentially one more investment operation 6 for the
remainder of the CPS, following a request from the Government received in December 2012.
This Progress Report further maintains the principle of flexibility that underpinned the CPS and
takes the opportunity to streamline the Bank's engagement in Panama as the current political
administration enters the second part of its term.

IV. 

Progress toward achieving CPS Objectives and Outcomes

22. 
Overall, considerable progress has been made towards achieving CPS milestones and
outcomes. A detailed description of progress towards CPS results in each of the three pillars is
presented in both the revised Results Matrix (Annex 1) and in Annex 2.

Significant reforms have been achieved under the CPS in critical areas...

23. 
The DPL reform actions related to legislative change at the onset of the political cycle
have been particularly successful as illustrated by the tax policy and tax administration reforms
undertaken by the Government to widen its tax base and reduce tax exemptions thus maintaining
fiscal sustainability by keeping the fiscal deficit within the limits of the Social and Fiscal
Responsibility Law.

24. 
Together with the social protection project, the DPL contributed to the reform of the
Government's CCT program, Red de Oportunidades, RdO (e.g., by providing tools for the
recertification of the eligibility of beneficiaries) and helped streamline and target transfer
programs better. It has been an integral part of the Government's social protection agenda,
together with its flagships-the Beca Universal scholarship program, covering all eligible
children in grades 1-12 in public schools, and the "100 a los 70", a non-contributory pension
program. However, like in other sectors, these programs have been affected by institutional
weaknesses, fragmentation, and lower budget allocations resulting in lower-than-expected results
(e.g., in the implementation of the M&E system to assess results in pilot social sectors).

25. 
Given the fast growth and reduction in poverty levels, the Government is incorporating
vulnerability dimensions in the eligibility criteria of its social policy instruments (e.g., "RdO",
"100 a los 70", and the new "Guardian Angel" disability program). The eligibility criteria of
RdO include household income indicators, with data collected through the Vulnerability Census.
The Ministry of Social Development has recently passed a resolution establishing the Social
Vulnerability Survey to assess risk dimensions among eligible elderly (e.g., income level, health

conditions, one-person household), with a similar instrument being developed for the "Guardian
Angel" program.

26. 
The reform of the public procurement system in Panama continues to deliver tangible
benefits. The procurement system has undergone a significant upgrade, with technical assistance
from the World Bank for the design and implementation of PanamaCompra, a fully transactional
e-procurement platform, which the Government is now working to expand beyond common use
goods and standard services contracts. 
It serves not only as an effective means to promote
transparency and efficiency in government procurement, but also as a business tool for
companies 
interested in competing for public contracts. 
The Bank has also supported
improvement of financial reporting and auditing practices, contributing to the country systems
agenda.

27. Water sector restructuring to foster improved provision of water and sanitation services,
especially in rural areas, is a priority for the Government and a process is underway to modernize
Panama's water and sewerage authority7 and reform the institutional framework of the sector.
This has created an environment conducive to mobilizing resources for the sector, and the Bank
has worked closely with two main development partners in the country-the Inter-American
Bank for Development (IDB) and the Development Bank of Latin America (CAF)-to enhance
policy dialogue and coordination. The draft law has been prepared and is awaiting review by the
National Assembly.

.... combined with tangible results achieved through ongoing IBRD operations

28. 
The targeted results of IBRD operations under implementation relate directly to the
overall CPS outcomes and in many cases important progress has been achieved despite various
implementation challenges.

29. 
Key accomplishments were achieved under all three pillars, such as: over 36,000 hectares
of forest are now under effective conservation; 59 productive alliances were formed with small-
scale producers receiving financing to access markets; the national disaster risk management
plan for 2011-2015 is under implementation; a water supply and sanitation master plan has been
completed for the cities of Chilibre, Alcalde Diaz, and San Miguelito; 144 rural water
organizations were supported by the rural water project leading to 41,257 people in target areas
receiving improved water and sanitation services; the number of framework agreements for
procurement of goods and standard services has increased and e-procurement is now widely used
by the public sector, with surveys conducted to measure public views of the system.

30. 
One of the objectives of the WBG partnership with Panama has been to help decrease
gender gaps, improving the lives of poor and indigenous women in particular. The Health Project
contributes to higher percentages of women receiving at least three prenatal controls, and births
attended by trained personnel. Participation of women in environmental sub-projects 8 of the GEF
Rural Productivity project is at 43 percent exceeding the targeted 40 percent of beneficiaries. The

Sub-projects include forest conservation, natural resource management, reforestation, production of medicinal plants, etc.

7

Bank-supported CCT program transfers resources to mothers to improve their families' living
standards.

31. 
Another important objective has been focusing on addressing poverty and inequality
within the most vulnerable indigenous communities. Six out of the seven ongoing investment
lending projects serve indigenous and poor communities, and Indigenous Peoples Plans put in
place in consultations with the beneficiaries are monitored regularly. 
The coverage of
indigenous population by mobile health clinics services went up from 120,000 to 213,193 people
exceeding the target of 180,000; 46.3 percent of the CCT program is targeted at indigenous
recipients; and 10,847 indigenous people are receiving improved water and sanitation services.

Knowledge and Convening Services have been an important element of the CPS

32. 
Knowledge and convening services have become an increasingly important part of the
support provided by the Bank to Panama. In terms of AAA, while the CPS anticipated delivery
of ten pieces, twelve have been delivered to date, with the total number expected to reach
thirty over the CPS period, including a reimbursable advisory service (RAS) to frame a
development strategy for the reverted areas around the Canal-a new Bank instrument for
Panama which paves the way for future engagement on this basis. This number also includes
regional analytical pieces that specifically cover Panama (e.g., Trade Facilitation and Regional
Integration in Central America; Regional Poverty Study; Regional Social Expenditures Review;
Good Jobs: the Role of Human Capital). The Bank has maintained a follow-up dialogue on
Accounting and Auditing Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC) and support
regarding International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). It has also provided convening
services 
to Panama, specifically in the area of competitiveness, 
trade and logistics, and
increasing efficiency of public procurement. Annex 3 provides detailed information about non-
lending activities.

Some CPS outcomes are no longer sought or have been modified

33. 
Results in the third pillar to support a transparent and efficient public sector have been
slower to materialize partly due to the long structural delay of the effectiveness of the Enhanced
Public Sector Efficiency investment lending operation. While good progress has been made in
some key areas, such as procurement, areas like implementation of the new version of the
Integrated Financial Management System remains a medium-term agenda which is likely to take
time in terms of showing results in key outcome indicators. In light of this, the revised Results
Matrix in Annex 1 proposes some new outcome targets which are more realistic. The original
CPS outcomes remain relevant but would only materialize during the next CPS period.

34. 
Slow progress in enhancing the quality of higher education and innovation remains a
challenge for the Government, and the shortage of qualified labor in Panama's fast-growing
economy is becoming a serious limitation to its competitiveness. The quality of the higher
education and innovation systems has not yet adapted to the needs of a dynamic global
environment. The AAA on Higher Education and Innovation for Global Competition initially
planned under the CPS was replaced by the regional study on Good Jobs: The Role of Human
Capital which includes a thorough diagnostic of tertiary education and vocational training issues

8

in Panama. More needs to be done in this area in the near future and the Bank is planning a
policy note on the sector to foster dialogue with a variety of stakeholders in Panama in the lead
up to the political transition. No lending in the education sector is planned at this time but could
be envisaged under the next CPS.

IFC has a growing presence in Panama

35. 
IFC engagement in Panama has built on synergies with the Bank, specifically on
promoting competitiveness through advisory services to improve the investment climate in the
areas covered by the Doing Business report and to respond to the challenges related to tax
transparency. IFC has continued to support private sector development in financial markets and
infrastructure, and to promote investments oriented to low-income groups. During the CPS
period, IFC has made investments in the housing and banking sectors to expand residential
mortgage lending to low-income households, expected to increase access to financial services to
over 2,700 
individuals; supported lending to SMEs in the agricultural sector to benefit
260 farmers; and supported increase in trade and regional integration through US$150 million in
trade guarantees to a local bank. The details of the IFC portfolio are presented in Annex 6.

36. 
Infrastructure investments included participation in the financing of the Panama Canal
expansion 
(US$300 million), a hydro-power project estimated 
to provide power 
for
270,000 customers (US$38 million), a green-field cellular network built by a local phone
company estimated to create 500 direct jobs, US$10.5 million in taxes and other payments to the
government and 700,000 phone connections.

Overall, success has been impressive where activities benefited from strong government
ownership

37. 
In areas where the Government has put in place institutional structures with the
appropriate legal and resource backing, results have been achieved and sometimes exceeded
expectations as, for example, in the case of the tax administration tribunal in terms of number of
cases resolved, or the implementation of PanamaCompra in terms of the number of contracts for
common use goods processed.

Implementation

38. While there has been a shift to AAA 
in terms of new activities, the bulk of the CPS
development results are still expected to be delivered through the existing portfolio of lending
operations, with complementary advisory and convening services. The portfolio performance is
satisfactory for the most part, despite slower-than-expected disbursements. The portfolio
includes eight projects totaling US$302.4 million in commitments, including a DPL with
Catastrophe Drawdown Option (CAT-DDO) (US$66 million) and a GEF grant (US$6 million),
in human development, infrastructure, rural productivity, disaster risk management, and public
sector efficiency. A total of US$142 million in investment lending remains to be disbursed, with
three projects spanning beyond the CPS period. Two projects, Social Protection and Metro
Water, 
representing 21 percent of total commitments are currently 
rated moderately
unsatisfactory.

in subsequent years, reaching 16.2 percent 
Disbursement 
levels 
improved 
in FY11 and
15.3 percent in FY12 (excluding DPL disbursements). 
Initial delays in implementation and
relatively low disbursements stemmed from several factors:
/ 
structural delays in reaching loan effectiveness (Enhanced Public Sector Efficiency and
Metro Water and Sanitation Improvement projects);
/ high project staff turmover in some Project Implementation Units;
/ 
lengthy approval processes for project restructuring, mostly by the Comptroller's Office;
/ 
slower disbursements on some of the projects due to lower allocations in the national
budget-this also affected loans from IDB and CAF.

41. 
Many of these concerms are valid for the remainder of the CPS period, and the dialogue
with the Government and project staff on improving project implementation is ongoing. Annual
Country Performance Portfolio Reviews (CPPRs) held jointly with the Ministry of Economy and
Finance and the implementing agencies that have helped sharpen the focus on implementation
and resolution of bottlenecks will continue. As will sector-specific "mini-CPPRs" and regular
meetings with the Ministry of Economy and Finance to review implementation progress of each
project. Furthermore, enhanced supervision 
is in place for projects that are encountering
implementation challenges.

42. 
As a result of a sustained close engagement, several projects (Water and Sanitation in
Low-Income Communities, Health Equity and Performance Improvement, Social Protection,

10

Rural Productivity and 
the accompanying GEF grant) were restructured 
to accelerate
implementation and ensure achievement of their development objectives. Since the restructuring,
significant progress has been observed, with ratings upgraded for two projects, Water and
Sanitation in Low-Income Communities and the Rural Productivity GEF grant, from moderately
unsatisfactory (MU) to moderately satisfactory (MS).

V. 

Proposed Modifications to the CPS

43. 
The modifications proposed to the CPS respond to the country's evolving needs and
demand, while aiming to bolster the chances that Panama can continue deepening its shared
prosperity path. 
In order to deliver quickly on its planned program, and facing fiscal space
constraints, the Government has resorted primarily to other sources of funding, thus substantially
reducing uptake of new IBRD lending. As a result, the composition of the program changed to
reflect increased focus on demand-driven knowledge services. Compared to the US$400 million
in new lending envisaged, a total of US$221 million in new IBRD commitments has been
delivered to date in support of enhanced public sector efficiency, fiscal management and
efficiency of expenditures, and disaster risk management.

44. 
Aside from the second DPL (US$100 million) in FY13, a potential third DPL
(US$50 million) in FY14 and potentially one more investment operation before the end of the
CPS period, no new lending is envisaged. This is in line with the Government's decision to
maintain its fiscal space with regard to international debt as stipulated under the Social and
Fiscal Responsibility Law. The rest of the investment lending planned under the CPS is therefore
being dropped with this Progress Report, as is presented in the Results Matrix (Annex 1).

45. 
The Government has expressed continuous interest in the WBG's non-lending services
which, complementing the ongoing portfolio, will represent the bulk of the Bank's new activities
moving forward. Some of the topics that are expected to be taken up are: Panama urban growth
strategy, digital inclusion, rural water and sanitation strategy, analytical work on labor markets,

11

training and skills. The CPS Progress Report outlines program activities planned over the next
two years which would support economic growth, competitiveness, greater opportunities for all,
and enhanced public sector effectiveness (see Annex 3 and Standard CPS Annex B8).

46. 
Going forward, the IFC program in Panama is expected to grow, capitalizing on previous
investments in infrastructure and financial markets, and eventually expanding into the service
sector. Some opportunities include support to the infrastructure value chain related to the Panama
Canal expansion and continuation of support 
in trade finance. IFC is also evaluating
opportunities to support private tertiary education. The newly-established IFC office in Panama
is expected to coordinate IFC's operations in Central America, and eventually provide support to
the Caribbean.

VI. 

Risks

47. 
Economic: The risk of lower-than-expected growth leading to lower results of tax
reforms did not materialize. The main economic risks derive from the fiscal stance and the
country's vulnerability to external shocks. Some risk of overheating has stemmed from the
combination of expansionary fiscal policy, high growth rates, and expansionary US monetary
policy to which Panama is tied through its currency peg. Yet this risk is subdued as headline
inflation is declining and the global environment is conducive to a smooth transition to trend
growth in the medium term. There is some risk that fiscal balances may deteriorate. This would
not compromise debt sustainability but would slow the reduction of the public debt-to-GDP ratio
and limit room for maneuver should negative shocks hit the economy. The main mitigating
factors are: flexibility in the timing of capital expenditure; the majority of public infrastructure
projects are being executed on time and within budget, and are expected to be completed before
the end of the current Administration's term; and the Government has been actively raising
revenues. In addition, Panama is vulnerable to external shocks. Strong domestic fundamentals,
the fact that a large part of the current account is financed through relatively stable FDI inflows,
accumulation of savings in the sovereign wealth fund9 , and the country's access to multilateral
financing for investment projects are likely to alleviate this risk.

48. 
Institutional: The main institutional risks relate to weak participatory processes and the
quality of public institutions. To improve transparency and efficiency of public spending, the
Government is implementing reforms in the areas of fiscal management and procurement, such
as strengthening budget execution, accounting and controls through an integrated financial
management system. These reforms are supported by several donors, including the World Bank,
through investment and TA projects that are expected to improve the monitoring and evaluation
of public investment and spending. The effectiveness of some of the reforms depends on the
capacity and ability of the Government to involve relevant stakeholders to create consensus
around reforms. The Bank will closely engage with the relevant stakeholders on the reforms
supported by the CPS, while recognizing the weaknesses of consultations as a general problem.

9 As pointed out by IMF and Moody's analyses, the effect of the sovereign wealth fund may be less than expected as the net

savings 

in the fund (savings less incremental debt incurred during the year) will likely be low if the Government were to

register the maximum permissible deficits under the Social and Fiscal Responsibility Law.

12

49. 
Political and Social: With presidential elections coming up in May 2014, the speed of
implementation of the Government program may lead to challenges in dealing with sensitive
policy actions. Some opposition could occur regarding the recertification of eligibility of CCT
programs as some current beneficiaries may cease to receive benefits, as a result of better
targeting. The consultation process has started, following preparation of a communication
strategy for current beneficiaries. In response to concerns voiced by some legal firms and other
stakeholders regarding tax transparency reforms, the administration has opened a participatory
process to reach out to stakeholders and better communicate the benefits of the proposed
measures. The risk to the IBRD investment program is mitigated by the fact that all operations
were properly consulted during their preparation phase and Bank teams are doing due diligence
to ensure that the dialogue with all stakeholders remains open during implementation. The Bank
will continue to stress the importance of strengthening the dialogue so that stakeholder concerns
are captured and addressed. However, the Bank recognizes that the country is entering the pre-
electoral phase and this presents a risk to the pace of the implementation of the WBG program
and reform in general.

50. 
Environmental and Natural Disaster: The risk that the Government's ambitious
investment plan could be delayed due to natural disasters and environmental concerns did not
materialize. To reduce this risk, the Bank will continue to work closely with the client to ensure
that all environmental evaluations and mitigation strategies are properly implemented during
project execution. 
In those cases where environmental issues have been identified during
supervision missions, 
remediation measures have 
taken place 
including 
restructuring,
modification of environmental frameworks or preparation of new environmental plans, capacity
building, and increased environmental supervision and project monitoring.

51. 
The impact of a possible natural disaster could be partially mitigated by the DPL with a
CAT-DDO approved in FY12, which would provide immediate liquidity to the Government to
attend to affected areas and populations. Emergency grants that Panama has received from IDB,
CAF, and the Central American Bank for Economic Integration show that financing from these
institutions is an important factor in Panama's response to natural disasters. In addition, potential
financing through the sovereign wealth fund would be available to mitigate the impact of certain
emergencies in the future. The country's National Plan for Disaster Risk Management (2011-
2015) defines specific actions to increase disaster resilience. To mitigate the risk of policy
uncertainty, the Bank will work closely with the client to evaluate the impact of policy changes
and facilitate broad country dialogue on risks. The DRM dialogue promoted by the CAT-DDO is
leveraging other disaster risk reduction activities and interventions, such as promoting wide
participation and ownership by local stakeholders and vulnerable groups. This includes the
development of local disaster risk reduction platforms in indigenous regions which take into
account specific vulnerability needs and integrate traditional knowledge into the DRM agenda.

10 Although according to the World Bank's Natural Disaster Hotspot Study, Panama ranks 14 th among countries with the highest
economic risk exposure to multiple hazards.

17 The original baseline was based on administrative data estimates. The corrected baseline based on an individualized roster of beneficiaries was established during the first

year of implementation and was much lower than originally expected for both indicators - 26%o and 20%o respectively. Given the revised baseline values, the original targets

became unrealistic and were revised after the project restructuring to 850% and 70C respectively.
By 2009, the RdO program, which started in the previous CPS period, reached more than 76,590 beneficiary households. Since then the coverage declined reflecting: (i)

introduction of the non-contributory pension program ]OO a los 70 in 20 10 which led to 1, 100-- senior beneficiaries migrating from RdO to ]OO a los 70; (ii) exclusion of non-
eligible recipients following implementation of MIS in 20 10; and (iii) reduced unemployment and poverty levels. By August 2012, even with the addition of new eligible
households the number of beneficiaries reduced to 73,069. Current coverage reflects improvements in program management and in economic conditions. Increase in number of

beneficiaries is no longer a relevant indicator in a growing economy, where significant reduction in poverty lowers the number of people covered by social programs.

Annex 2 - Review of the Progress achieved under the Pillars of the CPS

1. 
Half of IBRD new lending under the CPS to date was in the form of Development Policy
Lending with the First Programmatic Fiscal Management and Efficiency of Expenditures
Programmatic DPL (US$100 million) which was approved in May 2011 and contributed to all
three pillars of the CPS, and the DPL with a CAT-DDO approved 
in October 2011
(US$66 million).

2. 
The current investment lending portfolio includes seven operations (US$302.4 million) in
Human Development (social protection and health), infrastructure (water and sanitation), rural
productivity, and public sector efficiency.

3. 
A broad range of non-lending activities, including convening services and knowledge
exchanges, also contributed to the results highlighted below.

4. 
Overall, considerable progress has been realized towards achieving CPS milestones and
outcomes. Progress has been most significant under Pillar 1, Growth and Competitiveness.
Under Pillar 2, Opportunities for All, results have been mixed, and more needs to be achieved
under Pillar 3, Enhancing Public Sector Efficiency. A detailed description of progress towards
CPS milestones and outcomes in each of the three pillars is presented in this annex and in the
Results Matrix (Annex 1).

Pillar 1 - Economic Growth that supports Competitive Advantages

5. 
Pillar 1 called for maintaining fiscal stability and for actions in four key areas of
competitiveness for Panama: agricultural productivity, roads, higher education and innovation,
biodiversity and conservation, and natural disaster risk management and adaptation to climate
change.

6. 
The DPL reform actions related to legislative change at the onset of the political cycle
have been particularly successful as illustrated by the tax policy and tax administration reforms
achieved by the Government to widen its tax base and reduce tax exemptions. Although the tax-
to-GDP ratio target featured in the DPL (12.80) has not yet been achieved, the tax-to-GDP ratio
increased substantially over the baseline value and reached 12.10 in December 2011.

7. 
Two instruments-both ongoing-contributed to increasing agricultural productivity,
the Rural Productivity investment lending project and the Rural Productivity GEF grant. After a
period of slow implementation due to initial changes in project staff and low financing, the
project has picked up pace significantly. As of mid-2012, 121 alliance sub-projects involving
approximately 4,400 producers and receiving close to US$20 million of grants were at various
levels of implementation. The project contributes to increased agricultural productivity of small-
scale producers targeted by the program and is well under way to reaching the target outcome of
25 percent increase (18.8 percent at progress report) in sales receipts of small-scale producers via
the project financed productive alliances.

8. 
With regards to the road sector, substantial progress has been achieved under this
Administration, both in terms of network expansion, as well as its improvement. The Bank has

23

not contributed to these achievements, however, as the Government relied primarily on other
sources of financing and decided not to seek IBRD lending for road infrastructure. The two
roads operations planned at the onset of the CPS have been dropped and no Bank engagement in
support of this sector is planned under the remainder of the CPS.

9. 
Less progress has been achieved in enhancing higher education and innovation, and
both remain a challenge for the Government as the lack of qualified labor in Panama's growing
economy is limiting its competitiveness. The quality of higher education and innovation has not
yet adapted to the needs of a dynamic global environment. The current shortage of qualified
labor constrains firm growth in international markets and limits productivity growth and thus
employment opportunities. The AAA on Higher Education and Innovation for Global
Competitiveness initially planned under the CPS was superseded by the regional study on
employment generation which includes a thorough diagnostic on Panama. More needs to be
done in this area in the near future and the Bank is planning to produce a policy note on the
sector to foster dialogue with a variety of stakeholders in Panama. No lending is planned at this
time but could be envisaged under the next CPS.

10. 
The Rural Productivity GEF project has contributed to mitigating the risk to natural
ecosystems and global biodiversity stemming from deforestation and lack of sustainable
conservation policies. Much progress has been achieved under this grant as 36,126.5 hectares
(72 percent of the 50,000 hectares target) are already under effective conservation. The grant is
also supporting 
the National Environmental Agency's effort to update a vegetation and
ecosystem map that will monitor deforestation progress. The updated map which is expected to
be completed in 2013 will help validate results on the ground.

11. 
Panama has made great strides in the last two years in the area of disaster risk
management and adaptation to climate change. In support of the National Disaster Risk
Management Plan, the Ministry of Finance has played an active role in reducing the fiscal impact
of natural disasters by: (i) securing contingent lines from IBRD-a DPL with a CAT-DDO for
US$66 million approved in October 2011 -and 
IDB; (ii) designing a reserve fund for natural
disasters in the national budget; and (iii) creating a sovereign wealth fund - Fondo de Ahorro de
Panama (FAP) in June 2012. FAP funds may be used by the Ministry of Finance in the event of
a natural disaster and to purchase catastrophic risk insurance. In the context of the Central
American Probabilistic Risk Assessment (CAPRA) initiative funded by the Global Facility for
Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR), Panama successfully carried out the first study on
probabilistic seismic risk assessment for the city of David (the second largest city in Panama and
one of the most vulnerable), through a TA project supported by the World Bank. It proved to be
an excellent mechanism for training and capacity building. The focus is on assessing how health,
education and housing infrastructure in David could be impacted by earthquakes. Results are
helping to better identify risk management policies and investments, including the need to bolster
structures to make them more resistant. More GFDRR-funded activities are envisaged during the
second half of the CPS.

12. 
Since the approval of the DPL with a CAT-DDO, the Government has been consistently
implementing its DRM program. Several priority actions of the National DRM Plan have been
completed, including: (i) introduction by the Ministry of Housing and Land Use Planning of

24

disaster risk criteria into the TOR for the design of plans of local land use; (ii) update of the
National Plan for Integrated Water Resources Management and the National Policy on Climate
Change to 
include key DRM components by the National Environmental Agency; and
(iii) passing a decree empowering the Directorate of Investment, Concessions and Risks of the
Ministry of Finance to develop a Disaster Risk Finance and Insurance Strategy.

13. 
Two additional demand-driven initiatives not originally planned under the CPS were
undertaken, both contributing 
to 
the overarching objective of enhancing Panama's
competitiveness: (i) the Maritime and Logistics Strategy Implementation; and (ii) the Strategy
for the Development of Panama's Reverted Areas designed to help Panama obtain the best results
from use of its remaining "Reverted Areas". This was the first Reimbursable Advisory Services
(RAS) to Panama and paves the way for further engagement on such basis.

14. 
The Maritime Strategy Implementation has aimed to support the Maritime Authority of
Panama in the preparation of a Maritime and Logistics Action Plan for implementing the
National Maritime Strategy in order to promote sustainable maritime and logistics development
through institutional strengthening and generate spillover effects for socioeconomic development
and employment opportunities in an efficient maritime-logistics sector. All major activities under
the project have been completed and a successful Stakeholder Coordination Workshop (October
2011) led to reaching a broad consensus among the various stakeholders on the key challenges
and priority actions to address them.

15. 
The Areas Revertidas Strategy lays out options for the optimal use of the land in the
Canal Zone, leveraging the Canal, integrating development needs, and maximizing the positive
spillover effects of investments on these lands. Studies carried out under the Strategy include an
Economic Impact Assessment of "input-output" and "crowd-sourcing" models to analyze which
economic activities will have the most positive impact for Panama. The RAS also carried out
environmental audits of eight sites and provided Panama with a toolkit for doing this analysis
going forward. It also estimated the cost for expanding infrastructure and, in turn, calculated the
true value of developing sites. In addition, a Residential Development Potential Study was
completed for reverted areas in Panama City and Colon with recommendations for market-based
tools for sustainable urban growth.

Pillar 2 - Greater Opportunities for All

16. 
The focus of Pillar 2 has been to create greater opportunities for all and promote shared
prosperity, with specific outcomes foreseen in the areas of water and sanitation, access to health
and nutrition services, and social protection.

17. 
The DPL series has contributed to the strengthening of social protection of the
vulnerable segments of the population through better targeting of the Government's CCT
program Red de Oportunidades. Better targeting and the realization that not so many households
actually fulfill the criteria for inclusion in the CCT program have led to a lower than initially
foreseen number of beneficiary households. The DPL target related to the "100 a los 70"
program for the elderly, which established that transfer to at least 10 percent of the program
beneficiaries would be dependent upon compliance with health co-responsibility, has not been

25

achieved. Payments are being made 
to beneficiaries without monitoring and recording
compliance with visits to health practitioners. The World Bank, through its Social Protection
project, is working with the authorities to address this issue.

18. 
The current Administration considers the water and sanitation sector a priority and has
engaged in a process to modernize Panama's water and sewerage authority (IDAAN) and reform
the institutional framework of the sector. This has created an environment conducive to
mobilizing resources for the sector and has added pressure on IDAAN to deliver. The Bank has
worked closely with the two main partners (IDB and CAF) to enhance policy dialogue and
coordination. A number of activities that were linked to water sector policy have not reached
their full potential yet, as reform of the sector is still pending.

19. 
The Bank's engagement in Panama's water and sanitation sector has been strong with
two significant lending operations, the first one approved in 2007 under the previous CPS with
specific focus on low-income communities, and the second one (approved in May 2010)
targeting the Panama City metropolitan area. The latter experienced a long effectiveness delay
and it is too soon to report accurately on its progress at this time.

20. While the earlier Bank operation was characterized by an overly ambitious design, which
subsequently led to project restructuring and scaling back of some targets, it successfully
targeted Panama's poorest population. To date, 25,326 beneficiaries (86 percent of total
beneficiaries) live in poor townships, and 10,847 beneficiaries (37 percent of total beneficiaries)
live in indigenous comarcas. Expanding access to water and sanitation services (WSS) with an
emphasis on community involvement, local capacity-building and social outreach has worked
very well in implementation. Communities are developing a sense of ownership of their WSS
systems, which promotes sustainability.

21. 
The project also incorporated 
innovative activities such as the development of the
Information System for Rural Water Supply and Sanitation (SIASAR) web interface, which is
revolutionizing the way of doing business in the water sector in Central America and is
encouraging South-South knowledge exchange and regional coordination. The Water Partnership
Program, the Water Sector Program and other operational and grant programs financed by the
World Bank have been instrumental in supporting the launch of the SIASAR in Panama. IDB's
upcoming project with the Directorate for the Water and Sanitation Sub-sector (DISAPAS),
which draws heavily on the design of the Bank-funded Rural Water and Sanitation project, will
support the achievements already gained.

22. 
The Bank's ongoing operations in health and in social protection have contributed to
progress in improving poor households' access to quality basic health and nutrition services.
The specific milestone related to the development and dissemination of a National Health Plan
has already been achieved. With regards to the second milestone-the completion of background
studies for the preparation of a new operation in health-some adjustments have taken place
given the Government's decision not to pursue a new IBRD operation in the health sector.
However, based on the initial discussions about 
this new operation a note on "Non-
Communicable Diseases (NCDs) at a Glance in Panama" was prepared and discussed with the

26

Government. These discussions also contributed to a sub-regional document on NCDs in Central
America.

23. 
Due to incorrect baselines for outcome indicators in the health sector, the targets set to be
achieved under the CPS have been revised and are expected to be met fully by the project end.
Although taking more time than originally anticipated, several structural changes in healthcare
management have been introduced by the Government, which have a positive impact on the way
healthcare is delivered in rural isolated areas. The Bank project supported the implementation of
the Coverage Extension Program which aims to provide services through mobile teams in rural
areas, at a decentralized level, via the Ministry of Health regional offices.

24. 
In the first two years of the CPS, the Red de Oportunidades, the Government's social
protection program, was strengthened considerably. Coverage was adjusted to take into
account the establishment in 2010 of the non-contributory pension program "100 a los 70",
which provides cash transfers to eligible beneficiaries over 70 years old, who are no longer
covered by the Red de Oportunidades. The passage of Law 86 (November 2010), which
introduced an additional eligibility condition, has helped ensure better targeting of the "100 a los
70" Program, which is directed at seniors who are vulnerable and poor.

25. 

In addition, a new management information system was introduced which enabled the
identification and exclusion of households that moved to other regions, had duplicate records, or
were no longer eligible due to their employment/income status. The greatest impact on the CCT
program, however, has been Panama's sustained growth in the last two years, which has led to a
significant decrease in the unemployment rate-from 8.6 percent in 2006 to 4.2 percent by
2012- and an impressive reduction in poverty-from 38.3 percent to 25.8 percent- 
in the same
period 2 1 . These positive developments have translated into a reduction in the number of
beneficiaries of the Government's social protection programs, and while the current coverage is
lower than planned at the onset of the CPS, it reflects important improvements in program
management, as well as changing external conditions. The World Bank funded Social Protection
operation, approved under the previous administration contributed to this progress.

26. 
In terms of final outcomes, the CPS now includes a new outcome related to the universal
scholarship (Beca Universal) program which aims to cover all eligible children in grades 1-12 in
public schools.

Pillar 3 - Enhanced Public Sector Transparency, Effectiveness, and Efficiency

27. 
Under Pillar 3, the Bank aims to contribute to enhanced public sector transparency,
effectiveness and efficiency. Bank support includes Investment Lending, Development Policy
Lending and AAA.

28. 
Overall, in areas where the Government has put in place institutional structures with the
appropriate legal and resource backing, results have surpassed expectations as, for example, in
the case of the tax administration tribunal which has surpassed the intermediate outcome

21

Source: Ministry of Finance, 2012

27

indicator of number of cases resolved, or with the implementation of the e-procurement system
PanamaCompra and the number of common use goods contracts processed through it.

29. 
Implementation has been more challenging in cases where additional legal backing was
weak and Government resources scarce. This was the case for the recertification of the 100 a los
70 beneficiaries where the needed legal instruments had yet to be developed to enable the
recertification process and the budget allocation was insufficient. As a result, little progress has
been made on the DPL target related to compliance monitoring. The target was to achieve
compliance with health co-responsibility as determinant of the transfer payment for 10 percent of
beneficiaries. Currently payments are being made without monitoring and recording compliance
with visits to health practitioners target. The Ministry of Social Development is aware of the
challenge but currently does not have the resources to implement a monitoring system.

30. 
Progress has been strong in the area of modernizing financial and procurement
systems, with the introduction of the Integrated Financial Management System (SIAFPA) and
PanamaCompra, both designed to contribute to the improvement of the Government's capacity
to make budget decisions based on systematic provision of information on performance of public
programs.

31. 
The reform of the public procurement system in Panama continues to deliverer tangible
benefits. The procurement system has undergone a significant upgrade in recent years, with
technical assistance from the World Bank for the design and implementation of PanamaCompra,
a fully transactional e-procurement platform. This electronic system, though not yet universal,
serves not only as an effective means to promote transparency and efficiency in government
procurement, but also as a business tool for companies interested in competing for public
contracts. The improved efficiency of the public procurement for common use goods contracts
has reduced purchase times from 56 days on average to 24 hours, and the Government is
working to use PanamaCompra more widely for other procurement transactions.

32. 

Less progress was achieved in terms of improving the mechanisms in place in sector
ministries to ensure correct budget execution and evaluate success based on outputs and
outcomes. Most of the milestones have not yet been achieved, as the Bank operation designed to
contribute 
to 
this outcome 
initially faced serious 
implementation challenges posed by
effectiveness delay, administration changes and high staff turnover 
in the implementing
agencies. The primary outcome indicator under the high-level objective of improving the
efficiency of public expenditure has been revised and now reads "Improved mechanism in place
in sector ministries to ensure correct budget execution as measured by linking the public sector
budgeting, investment and procurement systems". In addition several new outcomes have been
added to the Results Matrix (Annex 1) that will be monitored during the remainder of the CPS.

Annex 4 - Panama Economic Achievements

1. 
Panama has made important strides in its economic development 
in recent years.
Panama's economic growth has been one of the fastest in Latin America over the past decade, a trend
that has even accelerated in recent years (Figure 3). The country has done well in integrating into the
global economy and has leveraged its geographical position, turning itself into a well-connected
logistics hub. Panama has also consolidated its position as the most competitive economy in Central
America and second after Chile in Latin America and the Caribbean, according to the 2012-13
Global Competitiveness Report.

2. 
Strong economic growth and public transfers have translated into poverty reduction.
The poverty rate fell from 48.5 percent in 2002 to 27 percent in 2011, while extreme poverty
decreased from 21 to 11 percent (Figure 1). Poverty has become more of a rural phenomenon due to
the much larger reductions in poverty in urban areas. The highest incidence of poverty is in the three
remote and sparsely populated indigenous areas Ngobe Bugle, Emberd, and Kuna Yala-
containing less than 7 percent of the total population but concentrating 16 percent of the poor and 28
percent of the extreme poor.2 2 Better targeting of poverty interventions and providing access to
services in isolated communities remain challenges for the Government's social programs.

3. 
Economic growth has been pro-poor and contributed to prosperity being more widely
shared. Income growth of households in the bottom 40 percent of the income distribution reached
7.3 percent between 2002 and 2010, far exceeding the average income growth of 4.3 percent over the
same period. Panama is catching up with the most advanced countries in terms of shared prosperity.
In fact a measure of economic growth adjusted for equity has grown faster than the growth of GDP
(7.1 percent compared to 5.8 percent annualized growth in 2002-2010). This is because inequality
decreased, with the Gini coefficient dropping from 0.57 in 2002 to 0.53 in 2011.

4. 

Yet inequality remains in the mid-range for Latin American countries and challenges
persist in the public provision of services. In addition, ample scope remains for improving the
public provision of social services across the country converging towards the most advanced
countries in terms of shared prosperity. For example, children in indigenous communities still have
less access to basic services than children in rural or urban areas (Figure 2).

22 These numbers are based on the 2010 Household Survey.

5. 

As part of a strategy to address the country's development challenges, the

Government has been improving tax revenue, efficiency of spending and social protection.

At the outset of its term in 2009, the Government presented a five-year strategic plan with the
overall objectives of sustainable economic growth and reduction of poverty and inequality. It
also presented a strategy to mobilize tax revenue to increase fiscal space for public investment
and social protection. The Government is currently implementing two tax reforms that widen the
tax base and improve the efficiency of tax administration, and has made significant progress on
negotiating a series of bilateral tax information sharing agreements. These revenue measures
have been complemented by financial management and procurement reforms to increase
transparency and efficiency of spending. The Government has also improved social protection by
introducing a non-contributory pension program 100 a los 70 and a universal scholarship
program Beca Universal and improving the targeting of the conditional cash transfer (CCT)

program Red de Oportunidades.

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS IN PANAMA

6. 

Panama's strong and relatively stable growth over the past decade has resulted

from an open, diversified economy. Panama's real growth over the past ten years averaged 6.8
percent, double the average for Latin America and the Caribbean. The economy is one of the
most open in the region. Growth has mainly stemmed from transport and communications, trade,
construction and financial intermediation. The strong growth in these sectors has also translated
into increases of 1.3 percentage points of total employment in the transport and communication
sector, of 0.6 in construction and of 0.5 in financial intermediation between 2008 and 2012. Over
time, growth has transitioned to a more domestic demand-driven model on the back of increased

23 Based on Human Opportunities Index estimations, the Figure shows the probability that a child in the different
areas will have access to the services.

32

investment growth and related increases in imports (Figure 4). With no independent monetary
policy due to dollarization, much of the relative stability can be attributed to prudent fiscal
policies that have kept public debt at manageable levels (Figures 5 and 6).

7. 
After a temporary deceleration in 2009, economic growth has exceeded the pre-
crisis pace, mainly driven by massive infrastructure investment and private consumption.
The 7 percentage point fall in GDP growth in 2009 mainly resulted from the effects of the global
slowdown through declines in credit growth, reduced transshipment and trade financing and a
halt in new real estate construction. Yet, the economy continued growing at 3.9 percent in that
year, and has picked up based on the public investment program, the Canal expansion and
private consumption. Economic growth in 2011 and 2012 reached 10.6 percent and an expected
10.5 percent, respectively, based on massive investment in infrastructure, reinforced by housing
construction, retail and wholesale trade, transportation and communication, as well as tourism.
The Government's five-year US$15 billion investment program has primarily accounted for the
increase of public capital expenditures from 5.6 percent of GDP in 2008 to an expected 9.1
percent in 2012 and the US$5.3 billion expansion of the Panama Canal has also driven up
investment rates. At the same time, the external current account deficit widened sharply to 12.8
and 12.5 percent of GDP respectively in 2011 and 2012, up from 0.7 in 2009.

Fiscal deficits have expanded to accommodate the Government's crisis response as
well as investment and social protection projects. In 2009, authorities raised the fiscal deficit
ceiling mandated under the Social and Fiscal Responsibility Law to allow an expansionary fiscal
stance in 2009. Social assistance expenditures increased by 6.6 percent in 2009 and stimulus
measures included subsidies on basic goods, a new labor program Mi Primer Empleo to help the
youth find jobs and an increase in the minimum wage. Since then, the Government with the
support of the National Assembly has raised the deficit ceiling of the nonfinancial public sector
(excluding ACP) twice to allow deficits to reach 2.9 percent of GDP in 2012. Central
government capital expenditure has increased from 5.6 percent of GDP in 2008 to an expected
9.1 percent in 2012, accounting for most of higher public spending. Major public investment
projects under the Government's five-year plan include the construction of a first metro line in
Panama City (US$1.9 billion), a major improvement of the national road network (US$677
million) and an expansion of airport infrastructure (US$227 million). So far, these projects have
been advancing within the budget and planned timeframe and are expected to be finalized before
the end of the term of the current administration in May 2014.

9. 
Panama's debt-to-GDP ratio has been declining along with the risk exposure of the
debt portfolio. Rapid growth and contained fiscal deficits are reflected in debt declining from 53
percent of GDP in 2007 to 42.1 percent in 2012. In addition, the quality of the debt portfolio has

35

steadily improved as the authorities have extended the maturities of new issues and smoothed the
portfolio redemption profile. The value of Treasury notes issues in the domestic market during
2011 reached US$538 million, which corresponds to 30 percent of financing needs. These
policies have significantly reduced exposure to refinancing and interest rate risk. This overall
improvement has been recognized by all credit rating agencies, which awarded Panama
investment grade in the spring of 2010 and have further improved the rating since. With the last
upgrade by Moody's in October 2012, Panama's sovereign rating is on par with Brazil, Mexico,
and Peru. The reforms of debt management supported by this operation will further contribute to
these improvements.

10. 
The Government has also addressed low tax-to-GDP ratio through tax reforms that
are achieving expected results. The Government has been implementing tax policy and
administration reforms 
that were approved 
in September 2009 and March 2010. The
implementation of the reforms was expected to raise an additional 1.7 percent of GDP in
revenues consisting of a 0.9 percentage point increase through the changes in the personal and
corporate income tax, a negative impact of 0.6 percentage points through the lowering of the tax
rates and the increase of income thresholds, and a further increase of 1.4 percentage points due to
other reforms, including 0.5 percentage points related to tax administration reforms. While the
first DPL in the series supported tax policy measures under the 2010 tax reform, the DPL II
supports their implementation and other tax administration efforts. To date results have been
considerable: overall tax revenue as percent of GDP has increased by 1.5 percentage points
relative to 2008 and reached 12.1 percent in 2011 and an expected 12.6 percent in 2012 (see
Table 2). In 2008 the economy grew at a comparable rate to 2011 and 2012, suggesting that the
higher tax-to-GDP ratio results from the reforms rather than an increase in economic activity.

11. 
However, the tax-to-GDP ratio is still low in international comparison, and reforms
supported by DPL II are relevant to further increase spending efficiency. Panama's tax
revenues undershoot the Central American average of 13.3 and are significantly lower than the
19.2 percent average for Latin America (OECD, 2011). While dividends and fees from the
Panama Canal and other non-tax revenues add another 7 percentage points of GDP to total public
revenues, they remain low by international standards. A higher tax-to-GDP ratio would help
alleviate the Government's resource constraint, reflected by below-average social spending.
Panama spent 9.4 percent of GDP on social expenditure compared to a 13 percent average for
Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC, 2011). The scarcity of resources highlights the
relevance of reforms in the areas of procurement, debt management, and social protection to
increase efficiency of spending.

MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY

12. 
The Panamanian economy 
is 
likely to continue growing at a strong pace.
Infrastructure investment and private consumption would continue driving growth in 2013 and
2014. The Government's investment program is expected to extend into 2014 when major
infrastructure projects would be finalized within budget and the planned time horizon. The
Panama Canal expansion is also expected to sustain strong growth in 2013 and 2014. The project
is progressing within budget and the expanded canal is expected to be completed in April 2015.
After the finalization of the Canal expansion, large private investment projects such as a US$ 6.5

36

billion investment in copper mining due to start in 2013 and new public investments such as a
second line of the Panama City metro would further sustain growth. In addition, increased
activity around the Canal would help to drive growth. Current growth rates are likely to sustain
and lead to a smooth transition towards trend growth in the medium term. Yet, sustaining high
growth in the long run will require investment in education and innovation for growth to rely
more on increases in total factor productivity and less on capital accumulation.

13. 
Inflation and current account deficit are expected to remain at manageable levels in
the short term and to decrease in the medium term. CPI inflation is expected to moderate to
5-6 percent in 2013. It had reached 6.3 percent in 2011 based on an increase in the minimum
wage, record levels of investment and higher commodity prices (food and oil) (Figure 4). The
decline is expected to stem from stabilized international commodity prices. In the medium term,
inflation is expected to gradually drop to around 4 percent. A potential spike in oil prices and a
continued rise in food prices are upside risks to the inflation outlook. The current account deficit
has risen largely on account of the import content of the Government investment program and
the canal expansion, and is expected to decrease slowly with the investment rates in the medium-
term (Table 1). While the large deficit exposes the economy to deteriorations in external demand
and changes in the risk aversion of foreign investors, strong domestic fundamentals mitigate the
impact of such shocks. The economy's demonstrated resilience during the 2009 crisis and
subsequent reforms to improve the financial safety net and financial sector supervision further
mitigate external vulnerability.

14. 
Although the fiscal deficit has been increasing, projections suggest a declining debt-
to-GDP ratio on account of strong economic growth. Panama's fiscal deficit is projected to
reach 2.5 percent of GDP in 2012 and to be below 2 percent in 2016 (non-financial public sector
excluding the canal authority). With the finalization of the current public investment projects and
the completion of the Canal expansion, fiscal accounts are expected to improve primarily
through higher revenues from the expanded Canal.

15. 
Under conservative assumptions, Panama's public debt is expected to remain
sustainable. A 2013 debt sustainability analysis by the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
shows that a combination of a gradual rise in revenue and a containment of current expenditure
would allow the authorities to expand public investment while keeping public debt sustainable in
coming years. Under a number of alternative scenarios, debt sustainability shows the greatest
sensitivity to shocks to the country's growth rates. However, under reasonable assumptions,
these shocks are not expected to undermine debt sustainability in the medium term. While a
further deterioration of fiscal accounts would decrease the room for maneuver in case of an
external shock, it would not endanger debt sustainability. With capital expenditure explaining the
bulk of deficit expansion, the Government has some room to cut spending if necessary. In
addition, the Government has engaged in reforms to increase revenue, including tax policy and
administration reforms and the approval of the Fondo de Ahorro de Panama (FAP) in 2012. This
sovereign wealth fund will save transfers from the Panama Canal Authority to the Treasury in
excess of 3.5 percent of GDP starting in 2015. Yet, as pointed out by several analysis (IMF and
Moody's) the net savings (savings less incremental debt incurred during the year) in the FAP
will likely be low if the Government were to register the maximum permissible deficits under the
Social and Fiscal Responsibility Law. Regarding mitigation measures, the Ministry of Economy

37

and Finance is also preparing a medium-term debt management strategy, supported by the DPL
series. As a result, the quality of the debt portfolio is expected to further improve.

16. 
Panama's macroeconomic framework is adequate for development policy lending.
Fiscal policy remains prudent and consistent with medium-term sustainability. This is even more
important given the specific set-up of the economy without independent monetary policy and the
large degree of openness.

Annex 5 - MIGA Support for the Metro Project Financing

1. 
On June 29, 2012 (FY12) MIGA issued a guarantee of US$320 million to support the
construction financing of "Line 1" of the Panama metro system. Line 1 consists of the
Greenfield development, construction, supply, and installation of a 13.7 km metro line between
the northern Los Andes and south-west Albrook areas of Panama City.

2. 
Total project cost is estimated at US$1.9 billion, of which US$1.5 billion is related to the
turnkey Engineering Procurement and Construction ("EPC") contract for Line 1.

3. 
The guarantee issued represents MIGA's first coverage of a sovereign financial obligation
in the Republic of Panama, and more broadly in the LAC region.

4. 

The primary direct developmental benefits of the Line 1 are expected to be:

* 

Increased Travel Time Savings. The main direct beneficiaries of Line 1 are expected to
be the users who will significantly reduce their travel time. This benefit is the most
significant constituent of the Line 1 benefits, given that the current average commuting
time in Panama City is 70 minutes in each direction2, and Line I will significantly save
on travel time associated with public transportation.

-25

24

-

-

* Reduced Vehicle Operating Costs. For those who do not switch to bus and metro, it is
expected that the mass transit system, along with additional public works focusing on six
key intersections in Panama City, will significantly reduce congestion and therefore
reduce private vehicle operating costs associated with congestion.

* Greater Environmental Benefits. The reduced congestion expected of an integrated
Metrobus and Metro system will also reduce pollution by reducing C02 exhaust pipe
emissions. These emissions tend to increase with stationary vehicles which are running
(as is typical in times of congestion) and also tend to increase with the time vehicles are
on the road. Improved mobility should address these two issues.

* Reduced Pedestrian Accident Rates. Another expected benefit of the metro relates to
increased urban street safety conditions as traffic congestion is reduced, and pedestrians
wait in metro and bus stations for public transport rather than doing so on the road.

24 Based on the 2007 Urban Mobility Study by the World Bank.
25 Based on the report prepared by Deloitte Inc., the GoP consultants for the economic viability assessment of the
Line 1, travel time of public transportation increases by 21 minutes from 2009 to 2035 without metro, whereas
the transportation time increases by only 5 minutes with metro.

Annex 6 - IFC recent Investments and Results

IFC's investments have climbed steadily every year since 2006 when the Corporation made just
US$1.1 million in commitments to Panama. IFC's commitments in FY12 totaled US$176 million
over four clients. IFC's committed portfolio as of June 30, 2012 is US$630 million. Consistent
with IFC's regional priorities, infrastructure/sub-national finance accounted for 47 percent of the
portfolio, financial markets for 30 percent, and electric power for 9.5 percent.

Financial Markets

Banco General US$50 million loan to facilitate private sector lending to low- and moderate-
income households (FY12).

* BBVA Panama US$25 million loan to support the Bank's lending activities to local SMEs
(FY12).
* GTFP Multibank US$100 million trade finance line to support regional integration (FY12).
* QBE US$10 million in non-convertible preferred shares and US$8.5 million in common
equity to support the expansion in the medium and low income insurer market (FY10).

Infrastructure

* Pando Montelirio US$60 million loan (own account) plus US$143 million (mobilization); the
commitment is to support a hydropower development that plans to use the water of the
Chiriqui Viejo River (CVR) in the Chiriqui Province in Western Panama (FY11).
