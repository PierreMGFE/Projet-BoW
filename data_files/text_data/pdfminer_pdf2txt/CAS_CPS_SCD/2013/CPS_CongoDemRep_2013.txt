EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

1. 
The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is emerging from a long period of conflicts and 
mismanagement, which have had devastating impacts on the economy, the institutions, and the 
social fabric. In spite of the many challenges and concerns regarding the fairness of the 2011 electoral 
process, for the first time in more than four decades, DRC was able to organize back -to-back multiparty 
presidential and parliamentary elections.  

2. 
Over the past few years, with the support of the international partners, including the World 
Bank, DRC was able to make significant progress in restoring security to most of its territory and 
stabilizing its economy. Implementation of sound macroeconomic policies has enabled DRC to weather 
the current global crisis. Since 2010, the DRC’s economic growth has exceeded the average for Sub -
Saharan Africa by 2 percentage points, growing at an annual average of 7 percent. Economic growth in 
2013 is projected to reach 8 percent, and future prospects remain broadly positive.  

3. 
Following the progress made in the implementation of sound economic policies and 
structural reforms supported by the Bank and IMF during the previous CAS, DRC reached the 
HIPC completion point and in July 2010 received a debt cancellation of US$12.3 billion (the largest 
in HIPC history). Moreover, in order to entrench good governance following the HIPC completion point, 
an economic governance matrix focusing mostly on publication of mining and forestry contracts, 
increased transparency in the management of public resources, and improvement of the business climate 
was agreed with the authorities and has been implemented since December 2010. Progress in 
implementing it has triggered Bank financial support to DRC since December 2010. In agreement with 
the Government and the IMF, new forward-looking measures to deepen governance and development 
impact of the extractive industries, PFM, and state-owned enterprise (SOE) management are being added 
to the matrix.  

4. 
DRC has huge potential to grow more quickly, reduce poverty, and improve human 
development indicators. Despite its abundant mineral resources and long history of mining, DRC has 
not yet reaped their developmental benefits. DRC remains one of the poorest countries in the world, 
ranking last on the UN Human Development Index in 2013. Seventy-one percent of its population lives 
on less than US$1.25 per day. The country will not meet any of the MDGs by 2015. Poor governance––
truly evidenced by the mismanagement of extractives, weak institutions, wars, and conflict––has 
prevented the population from enjoying the benefits of their country’s incredible natural endowments. 
Addressing this paradox has been at the heart of the DRC Second Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper 
(PRSP) and the May 2012 Government Program.  

5. 
The new FY2013-FY2016 CAS rests on the fundamental thrust that business as usual is not 
an option for a country that will have the world’s 11th largest population in 2050 and that is facing 
the challenges of stabilization and peace consolidation in its eastern part . This new CAS is a joint 
WB, IFC, and MIGA strategy firmly anchored in the Government’s program as well as the World Bank 
Strategy for Africa. It aims at helping the Government make progress towards achieving the MDGs and 
strengthen the country’s foundations for higher growth rates, and shared prosperity. 

6. 
The CAS program focuses on four strategic objectives: (i) increase the effectiveness of the 
state at the center and at decentralized levels and improve good governance while strengthening the 
development impact of World Bank operations; (ii) boost the competitiveness of the economy by 
accelerating private-sector-led growth that will create jobs; (iii) improve social service delivery to raise 
human development (HD) indicators, and (iv) address the development deficits contributing to fragility 
and conflicts in DRC's Eastern provinces. Gender and climate change are treated as cross -cutting issues 
and are addressed through the above four strategic objectives as relevant.  

ix 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Supporting the first strategic objective on state effectiveness and good governance will cover civil 
service reform and rejuvenation in targeted ministries, implementing the public financial management 
action plan at the center and at the provincial levels, strengthening the capacity of civil society 
organizations to demand good governance, and reinforcing the capacity of state oversight institutions 
including the Parliament. As part of the same strategic objective, all Bank-financed operations will be 
implemented by Government’s institutions, and no new parallel project implementation units will be 
created while the existing ones will be phased out at the end of their respective programs.  
 To boost the competitiveness of the economy and accelerate private-sector-led growth, the Bank will 
support the development of one of the continent’s most cost-effective and abundant power sources 
(Inga); and agriculture and agribusiness value chains in geographically targeted economic spaces by 
financing hard and soft infrastructure and by addressing value chains specific investment climate 
bottlenecks, and skills limitations.  
 Strengthening basic services delivery systems, targeted social protection coverage, and access to 
primary and post-primary and other health services will support the third strategic objective.  
 The Bank will support the fourth strategic objective through an economic empowerment program by 
increasing economic opportunities in eastern DRC and by addressing some of the drivers of conflicts 
through analytical work and dialogue with all stakeholders; and by leveraging programs supported by 
donors including the UN that focus on the reform of the justice system and the security services. The 
regional dimension of the instability in Eastern DRC also will be covered. The February 24, 2013 
Framework Peace Agreement offers an opportunity to build on a regional initiative that will anchor 
peace and stability in Eastern DRC. 

7. 
The FY2013-FY2016 CAS will be supported by several of AAAs and 12 lending operations 
financed under IDA16-17. Strengthening national capacity for results will go a long way in 
reinforcing the national institution for statistics and enhancing the national capacity for monitoring 
and evaluation (M&E), which will be an integral part of the program supported by the Bank. The 
results framework will pay particular attention to gender-disaggregated indicators. Projects will report on 
results quarterly, and the use of surveys and targeted impact evaluations with Bank-financed operations 
will be made systematic. However, the lack of data including the recent poverty profile and the weakness 
of the statistical system in DRC are big issues. Under this CAS, the Bank will support the preparation of a 
household survey in 2013 and the development of statistics system including the national account 
statistics through a trust fund (TF) and additional IDA funding for the statistical system. Updated 
analytical work based on poverty data from the household survey will be used to prepare the Mid-term 
CAS progress report. 

8. 
As was the case with the preceding CAS, this one will be implemented under challenging 
conditions. The main risks are related to both domestic factors, including political, security, deteriora ting 
fiscal position, opposition to reforms and transparency by deeply entrenched vested interests, low 
capacity for effective and impactful program implementation; and lack of engagement by civil society and 
high unmet expectations for access to information and demand for good governance; and external factors, 
mainly and external shocks in a context of an uncertain global environment. 

9. 
In recognition that sustained progress on governance is critical for this CAS to achieve its 
objectives, its implementation will pay particular attention to issues related to good governance. Good 
governance will be the building block to support state effectiveness, service delivery, and improved 
business climate for private sector development (PSD) and job creation. Lack of consistent progress in 
economic governance that could prevent the delivery of basic services to sizable parts of the population 
would make Bank assistance ineffective and less and less relevant. Under such conditions, the Bank 
would reduce its financial assistance and engage more on policy dialogue and targeted interventions that 
support access to basic services by the poor. The situation will be assessed at the mid -term review when 
the CAS Progress Report is being prepared.

INTRODUCTION 

1. 
The last World Bank Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for the Democratic Republic of 
Congo (DRC) covered FY08–FY11 and was broadly aligned with the IDA15 cycle. That CAS was 
discussed by the Board of Directors on December 18, 2007. A CAS Progress Report (CASPR) was 
presented to the Board on May 26, 2010. In the absence of a fully developed Poverty Reduction Strategy 
Paper (PRSP), and taking into account the uncertainty related to the general elections scheduled for end -
2011, a strategic note for IDA16 and the FY12 Work Program were presented to the Board on June 28, 
2011. While the CASPR made some adjustments to the lending program to sharpen the focus of the 
Bank’s support to DRC and to strengthen the CAS results framework, the key objectives of the CAS were 
retained.  

2. 
This new DRC CAS covers FY2013–FY2016 and has been prepared jointly with the 
International Finance Corporation (IFC) and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency 
(MIGA).While building on the progress achieved by DRC during the past 5 years, the new CAS aims to 
help the Government of DRC address ongoing challenges and assist in the implementation of DRC’s 
second Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP-2) (2011–2015), adopted in late 2011. This CAS has 
been prepared in parallel with other development partners, including the African Development Bank 
(AfDB), the European Commission (EC), and the United States Aid Development Agency (USAID) . 
These partners also are preparing their respective country assistance strategies while the United Nations 
has completed the preparation of its assistance strategy. To provide operational advice on key priorities to 
strengthen the PRSP implementation, a Joint Staff Advisory Note (JSAN) for PRSP -2 was circulated to 
the World Bank Board on December 18, 2012. Similar to the previous one, this CAS is a results-based 
strategy anchored firmly in the Government’s program as well as in the World Bank Strategy for Africa 
(AS).1 The CAS also aligns with the Country Assistance Framework, which is the overall framework for 
donors’ coordination, which was jointly chaired by the United Nations Development Programme/United 
Nations (UNDP/UN) and the World Bank. 

3. 
This CAS is organized in four sections. The first section provides an overview of the 
country’s political, economic, security, and governance contexts, including a summary of achievements in 
key areas over the past few years. The second section presents the Government’s development program, 
as outlined in the PRSP-2 and its May 2012 national program; and summarizes the opportunities and 
ongoing challenges faced by DRC. The third section focuses on the World Bank Group’s (WBG) new 
strategy, laying out ongoing and new activities and implementation arrangements. The fourth section 
addresses risks and their mitigation. Appendixes provide additional information and statistics, including 
the completion report of the previous CAS and the Results Framework of this CAS.  

II. 

SETTING THE COUNTRY CONTEXT: A FRAGILE ENVIRONMENT 

4. 
DRC’s poverty and political instability are concerns in their own right. With a land 
surface area of 2.3 million km2, DRC is the largest country in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and shares 
borders with 9 countries. The country is endowed with rich natural resources (mineral deposits, forests, 
water, and arable land), a strategic location, and a young population. Despite this wealth, 71 percent of 
Congolese live below the poverty line of US$1.25/day. DRC is emerging from more than four decades of 
conflicts and mismanagement that have devastated the economy and the people. Since 1998, over 3.5 
million people are estimated to have died. During the same period, countless millions of others have been 
plunged into acute vulnerability due to displacement, loss of economic livelihoods, dilapidated 
institutions, and a destroyed social fabric.

5. 
DRC also is a destabilizing factor for its nine neighboring countries . While most of the 
country has returned to peace since the end of wars in 2002, Eastern DRC remains unstable. The recent 
crisis involving the M23 armed group2 has plunged the eastern region into yet another cycle of violence 
that could have spillover effects at both the national and regional levels. A large number of the drivers of 
conflict in Eastern DRC require a development solution that has a regional dimension perspective that 
involves all countries of the Great Lakes region in general; and Rwanda, Burundi, and Uganda in 
particular. In fact, peace and stability in DRC in general and in Eastern DRC in particular cannot take 
place without addressing the social, economic, and political roots of the conflicts. 

A. Political Context 

6. 
The 2011 presidential and legislative elections tested the stability of DRC’s institutions . 
These elections were the second to be organized in DRC following the adoption of the 2006 Constitution. 
The 2006 elections were managed largely by the international community. Since that time, the authorities 
promulgated a new organic law dated July 28, 2010 to create a new Independent National Electoral 
Commission (CENI) to manage the presidential, legislative, provincial, and local elections. The 
international community was not involved directly in the organization of the 2011 elections , but it did 
help defray their costs.  

7. 
The 2011 elections were marred by violence and contestations of the results. International 
observers raised doubts about the fairness and transparency of the process. Joseph Kabila, the incumbent 
President, was declared the winner and sworn in as President on December 20, 2011. However, the results 
were challenged by Etienne Tshisekedi, who came in second and declared himself president, initially 
posing a significant challenge to President Kabila and the stability of the country. More than 19,000 
candidates contested the 500 parliamentary seats. President Kabila’s coalition won a large majority in 
Parliament (341 of 500 seats) and appointed a new prime minister and government. Nevertheless, the 
2011 elections showed how fragmented the political spectrum was and underscored the fragility of DRC’s 
electoral institution in addition to the lack of a clear roadmap for organizing the next provincial and local 
elections. This situation has undermined the legitimacy of the political personnel.  

8. 
The unfinished decentralization agenda has caused tensions between central authorities 
and the provincial authorities. To prevent the concentration of power that took place in DRC for 
decades, and in consideration of the country’s size, the 2006 Constitution defined DRC as a unitary but 
decentralized state. The current 11 provincial capitals are located on average 1,700 km from Kinshasa, the 
capital city; the closest provincial capital, Matadi, is located 346 km from Kinshasa. The 2006 
Constitution assigned important responsibilities to the provinces. The decentralization framework 
envisaged the transfer of competencies in health, primary and secondary education, and agriculture to the 
provinces. In return, provinces were entitled to 40 percent of fiscal revenues collected by the national 
authorities. The number of provinces was set to increase from 11 to 26. In contrast, the reality is that (i) 
the existing provinces have limited institutional capacity or means to discharge their responsibilities and 
(ii) the large cost associated with creating 15 additional provinces has stalled the process. Despite their 
recent increases, provincial revenues consistently have been below the constitutionally mandated share. 
This situation has raised tensions between national and provincial authorities. In fact, the weak 
institutional capacity and limited accountability of the provincial authorities have impeded the delivery of 
basic services and have minimized the benefits expected from decentralization.  

9. 
The current government is headed by Prime Minister Matata Ponyo, who, as minister of 
finance in the previous cabinet, was credited with solid macroeconomic management performance.

His new government, composed mostly of technocrats, was formed on April 28, 2012. Since then, the 
performance of public institutions has improved slowly. However, despite the parliamentary majority that 
the parties close to the president enjoy, the new Government remains at risk of being side tracked by 
those who are unhappy with the new drive for more transparency and accountability. At the same time, 
the state-owned enterprises (SOEs) continue to exhibit low levels of accountability, driven mostly by 
well-connected managers and staff. In the absence of well-functioning state institutions, the actions of a 
small number of individuals remain largely unconstrained and continue to have a disproportionate impact 
on the ability of state institutions to deliver for the population, thus undermining the effectiveness of the 
state. 

B. Security Situation 

10. 
Since the end of the wars in 2002, DRC has been at peace everywhere except in some 
areas in the Eastern provinces. While most of the provinces in the west, the center, the north, and the 
south have been at peace for years, some locations in the Eastern provinces have been affected by low-
intensity conflicts for decades. The only brief period of peace there was 2009 to 2011. The invasion of 
Goma, capital city of North Kivu on DRC’s eastern border with Rwanda in November 2012 for 11 days 
by the M23 rebellion was the cornerstone of the instability that continues to negatively affect large swaths 
of population. Decisions by the authorities by mid-2012 apparently (i) requiring the rotation of military 
troops from their initial postings in the mineral-rich Eastern provinces to other locations in the country 
and (ii) arresting one of the high-ranking military officials indicted by the International Criminal Court 
(ICC)3 may have contributed to the resurgence of the conflict in North Kivu during recent months. At 
present, over 2 million people are internally displaced (doubled from 1 million in 2006), while another 
300,000 are refugees in neighboring countries. Violence against civilians also is pervasive. In 2011 over 
10,000 acts of sexual violence were recorded in the North Kivu and South Kivu provinces and in the Ituri 
District of the Orientale Province.  

11. 
The persistent instability in the East is the obvious manifestation of crumbling state 
institutions. Dysfunctional institutions that are not held accountable have diminished the country’s 
resilience to both internal and external shocks. Institutions with the ability to adjudicate the many 
conflicts and their underlying grievances over land rights and mineral and historic disputes are a 
precondition for peace. Strengthening these institutions could unlock the economic potential of DRC 
overall and of the Eastern provinces in particular. For decades, ethnic and communal identities in Eastern 
DRC have been manipulated by political actors and armed groups. These manipulations together with 
demographic imbalances created as a result of armed conflicts and migrations within the Great Lakes 
region have engendered social and political exclusion and loss of identity status. This situation has fueled 
instability and created large populations of forcibly displaced people, in and of themselves potential 
drivers of further conflicts. Ethnicity and identity also have been used in the competition for and 
occupation of land, leading to disenfranchisement and conflicts. Addressing these deep structural 
imbalances will require both investment to enhance social resilience through reconciliation and 
nonviolent conflict resolution, and the establishment of inclusive and equitable local governance 
mechanisms. 

12. 
Numerous peace initiatives have failed to put an end to fighting among armed groups in 
the East. Over 25 armed groups are active in the Eastern DRC, among them the M23, the Democratic 
Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR), the different Mai-Mai groups, and the Lord’s Resistance 
Army (LRA). Since 2004, several waves of armed groups have been integrated in the national army, but a 
number of them including Mai Mai always kept back some of their combatants, who continued harassing 
civilians and fighting one another or the army, often for control of mines. Finally, addressing the

instability in Eastern DRC will require a regional solution that involves all of the countries of the Great 
Lakes region in general, and specifically, Burundi, Uganda, and Rwanda. The signing of a peace, security 
and cooperation framework for DRC by the 11 countries of the region on February 24, 2013 is an 
important step toward a sustainable peaceful solution to the conflicts in Eastern DRC4.  

C. Poverty Profile, Social Context, and Progress toward MDGs 

13. 
Poverty remains widespread and the country will not reach any of the Millennium 
Development Goals (MDGs) by the 2015 deadline. With a 2011 per capita gross national income (GNI) 
of US$190, DRC’s population of approximately 71 million is among the poorest in the world. More than 
71 percent of the population lives under the US$1.25-a-day poverty line (2006) and 14 percent of the poor 
in SSA live in DRC. The country’s poverty is more than monetary. It includes a sense of exclusion, 
economic instability, and the inability to cope with uncertainties and to project in the future. Poverty also 
is experienced as the lack of economic opportunities and physical and psychological insecurity. 

14. 
While widespread, poverty is more likely to affect people living in the rural areas . There, 
75 percent of the population is poor compared to 61 percent in the urban areas. Level of poverty also 
varies by province. Available data shows that the poorest provinces in DRC are the Equateur, Bandundu, 
and South Kivu, in which poverty is higher than 85 percent. South Kivu’s high level of poverty can be 
explained by insecurity, which directly impacts economic activities. In the affected regions, conflicts are 
making poverty reduction an elusive goal. In the other two provinces, the main causes are associated with 
the total collapse of economic activities due to the closing of large farms and the absence of road 
infrastructure. The lack of economic activities in sectors with high growth and poverty reducing potential 
such as agriculture has reduced opportunities for DRC to achieve the MDG1 on poverty and malnutrition. 
The vulnerability of the population is higher in areas affected by conflicts because they create fragile, 
insecure, and violent environments that hamper the people’s ability to maintain sustainable livelihoods. 
This insecurity is exacerbated by the quasi-absence of basic services. Displacement of large populations is 
another strong contributor to poverty.  

15. 
All DRC’s human development indicators are low: the 2012Human Development Index 
(HDI) ranks DRC last among 187 countries.5 Life expectancy at birth is 48 years (2009); maternal 
mortality ratio6 is 670 per 100,000 live births, infant mortality rate is 97 per 1,000; and under-5 child 
mortality rate is 158 per 1,000. Causes of death are typical of those found in very low income countries 
with very poorly developed health systems. Among these causes, the lack of infrastructure, malaria, 
preventable infectious diseases, malnutrition, and pregnancy-related deaths are particularly prevalent and 
have impacted the government’s efforts toward achieving MDGs 4, 5 and 6. 

16. 
Poverty in DRC clearly is gender biased. Discrimination against women is of particular 
concern given that women head 21 percent of households. Twenty-eight percent of women have never 
gone to school, compared to 14 percent of men. In the 15–49 age brackets, 4 times more women than men 
lack education (21 percent compared to 5 percent). Participation in the workforce is biased toward men: 
women’s participation is at 55 percent compared to 85 percent for men. When it comes to same job/same 
pay, women in DRC are more disadvantaged than in neighboring countries. DRC’s low ratio of 46

percent7 contrasts with 69 percent in Uganda, 77 percent in Burundi, and 79 percent in Rwanda. Gender 
inequalities are profound, as reflected in the fact that DRC ranks 148 of 157 countries in the Gender -
Related Development Index. 

17. 
The alarming nutritional status of women and children has severe consequences. Poor 
maternal health care leads to poor nutrition for both mother and child. In DRC, 46 percent of under -5-
year-olds are chronically malnourished or stunted. Malnutrition in the first 1,000 days of a child’s life 
leads to irreversible cognitive losses, which in turn lead to a significant and permanent lost-income-
earning potential when these children become adults. Such high levels of chronic malnutrition in women 
and children have been shown to lead to annual GDP losses of 2 percent–3 percent.8Furthermore, 
malnutrition is an underlying cause of 48 percent of the under-5 child deaths (DHS 2007). DRC’s 
prevalence of malnutrition among pregnant women and children under 5 is among the highest in Sub-
Saharan Africa, driven by poverty, poor access to basic health services, and inadequate hygiene and 
sanitation.  

18. 
The absence of comprehensive and recent poverty information remains a major concern 
although data from the 2007 DHS and the 2010 MICS have provided valuable information to all 
stakeholders. The latest DRC census goes back to 1984 and the 2013 Household Survey (1-2-3 survey) is 
still ongoing. Data from this survey are still being collected although they were primarily intended to 
provide a new poverty profile in order to design the Government’s Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper, 
which was adopted in 2011. The Bank is financing the ongoing household survey and will support under 
this CAS, the development of the statistical system, including the national account statistics, through a TF 
and additional IDA funding for statistics. Data from the ongoing household survey will be used when 
preparing the CAS mid-term progress report. The Bank also will help the Government and the UNFPA to 
prepare a new census in 2014. To coordinate all of these programs, a seasoned statistician has been posted 
in the country office. 

D. Recent Economic Developments 

19. 
DRC is now one of Africa’s most rapidly growing economies, but a lack of employment 
opportunities poses significant risks. Since 2010, economic growth has exceeded the average for SSA 
by 2 percentage points with the DRC economy growing from a very low base. According to Congolese 
Central Bank (BCC) projections, economic growth in 2013–15 is projected to reach 7.3 percent––some 5 
percent per capita. These projections assume that the agricultural sector is expanding by over 3 percent 
whereas observers based in the provinces record double-digit growth. These divergent numbers suggest 
that actual growth may be nearly 9 percent. In addition, inflation declined to a single digit in 2012, down 
from 15.4 percent at end-2011 and from over 50 percent at end-2009. At the same time, over the past few 
years, the Congolese franc has remained stable at approximately 920 CDF per US$1.  

20. 
The rapid growth of the economy over the past years has not contributed to private sector 
employment. The private sector offered formal employment to only 1.2 percent of the labor force 
between 2001 and 2005. Moreover, DRC has formidable infrastructure and institutional obstacles to 
employment growth. In the absence of reliable data, the estimated employment is based on the 2005 
household survey. The survey shows that young people, who constitute more than 50 percent of the 
workforce, are most affected by unemployment, particularly in the urban areas. The unemployment rate 
for the 15–24 age bracket is 32.2 percent, approximately twice the national average for urban areas (17.8

percent). Despite the fact that small-scale agriculture and large-scale mining are expanding rapidly, the 
absence of growth in the manufacturing sector and constraints to small and medium enterprise (SME) 
development suggest that job creation has been small.  

21. 
Despite an overall positive economic outlook, DRC’s economy faces substantial downside 
risks because of its continued reliance on mining exports with no local content or significant in-
country transformation. Mineral exports remain critical to DRC’s export revenues. A small number of 
mining products dominate exports while there is very little transformation in the country. However, when 
one or a few commodities account for the largest proportion of exports, the desire to maximize the value 
retained domestically is very high. DRC should develop mechanisms to undertake downstream processing 
of their raw materials to create a self-sustaining industrial base. The expansion of mineral processing is 
seen not only as an avenue for export promotion through vertical diversification, but also as a means to 
promote human resources and technological development by upgrading and creating specialized skills in 
both the private and public sectors. Primary commodity export prices have increased on global markets 
since 2002 but remain volatile. For example, copper prices declined by approximately 67 percent in early 
2009 before recovering later that year. Hence, export revenues are vulnerable.  

22. 
Fiscal revenues have increased dramatically as a share of GDP but remain low for a 
country of this size with so many needs. Following the introduction of a value-added tax (VAT) and 
other measures in 2012, the authorities’ own revenues are projected to reach 22 percent of GDP in 2012; 
up from 19 percent in 2011. Tax revenues increased most rapidly while petroleum royalties were more 
stable. In 2010 HIPC debt relief boosted the contributions of grants to the budget. Since then, grants have 
amounted to approximately 8.5 percentage points of GDP annually. Thanks to the HIPC initiative 
supported by the Bank, between 2009 and 2010, pro-poor spending grew as a share of total spending by 
roughly 5 percentage points (from 34 to 39 percent); whereas in 2011, there was a small drop in the share 
(to 38 percent of domestically financed expenditure), because higher than expected election costs put 
pressure on other spending items. Preliminary data from the2012 budget execution show that the share 
may have dropped to approximately 36 percent (but still above the share in 2009) due to the pressure on 
the budget from security-related spending because of the conflict in Eastern DRC. 

23. 
Fiscal revenues have contributed to an investment boom. In 2012 public investment 
reached almost 10 percent of GDP, concentrated in public roads and, more recently, electricity generation. 
However, the impact of public investment remains low, explained partly by capacity constraints. Line 
ministries’ directorates of studies and planning still have difficulties in identifying and evaluating public 
investment projects. Furthermore, while representing approximately 75 percent of the total capital budget, 
investment projects financed from external resources, in most cases , are developed outside the budget and 
not incorporated in the sector Medium-Term Expenditure Frameworks (MTEFs).The effective MTEF 
approach requires a major change of the budgeting system and significantly strengthening line ministries’ 
capacities. Using capital expenditures as shock absorbers has long-term costs; hence the need to look for 
alternatives hedge strategies for which TA from the World Bank Treasury Department may be available, 
to be combined when possible with support from the IMF and IFC. 

24. 
DRC’s medium-term economic outlook remains positive: economic growth is projected 
conservatively at 7 percent–8 percent during the CAS period with substantial upward potential. 
Baseline projections use BCC data, which are biased toward officially recorded activities. These 
projections show dramatic growth in the construction sector but do not reflect the growth potential of the 
agricultural or manufacturing sectors. On the demand side, public and private investments remain the 
main drivers of economic growth. Private investment is dominated by large-scale investment in the 
mining and telecommunications sectors, financed primarily by foreign investors. Residential construction 
is increasingly important. An analysis of agricultural growth suggests that, once basic security has been 
reestablished in Eastern DRC, double-digit growth will be feasible. Improved security and property 

6 

 
 
 
 
 
 
protection are likely to leverage agricultural gains because, today, only some 10 percent of agricultural 
land is under cultivation. Agricultural growth already may have cushioned the inflationary impact of 
rising international food prices to the benefit of the urban population, particularly the poorest, who tend to 
spend their income disproportionately on food.  

25. 
Regular missions and technical assistance from the IMF have anchored financial sector 
and macroeconomic policies but are no substitute for resilient institutions . Under the IMF-supported 
program, the Government has been able to maintain solid macroeconomic performance despite the 
resumption of conflicts in the East. DRC’s fiscal and monetary policies are based on IMF-sanctioned 
projections that also suggest the policy priorities that would underpin the outcomes. The IMF also is 
supporting the development of institutional capacity that will help the authorities to make their own 
projections on which they can base policies. Because DRC had failed to publish one last mining contract, 
the IMF program expired in December 2012 without concluding the fourth and fifth reviews . An IMF 
mission visited the country March 5-12, 2013 and the Fund has been in discussion with the Government 
on the next steps of their partnership. 

III. 

DEVELOPMENT AGENDA AND GOVERNMENT PROGRAM 

26. 
DRC has the potential to achieve significant economic growth and create job 
opportunities due to its abundant natural resources and under-employed, low-cost workforce. With 
its rapid population growth rate of 2.8 percent per year, by 2050 DRC will be the world’s 11th most 
populous country. The large and rapidly growing population represents a great market for the central 
Africa region if a large middle class population can develop. Regional integration cannot be put forward 
in this part of the continent without DRC. The country’s full richness encompasses fertile land that can 
feed the entire SSA, rivers for hydropower, mineral wealth, vibrant cross-border trade, and a young 
population thirsty for economic opportunities. For these huge potentials to be realized, the Government’s 
growth strategy should address the structural deficiencies of the economy and deeply reform the 
unfriendly investment climate while building a skilled workforce and maintaining macroeconomic 
stability. 

27. 
Although DRC is a resource-rich country, it faces the multiple challenges of (i) improving 
governance and building strong institutions,(ii) improving infrastructure and the investment climate to 
unleash private sector potential that will create growth and generate jobs, (iii) building human capital, and 
(iv) consolidating peace and stabilizing the Eastern part of the country. 

A. Opportunities and Development Challenges 

Natural resources (mineral, forests, and water) and agriculture 

28. 
The country’s mineral resources are huge and can make a tremendous difference in 
improving living conditions. The copper reserves of Katanga are the second largest in the world after 
Chile’s. DRC’s copper reserves are estimated to be as large as 70 million tons. Its cobalt and zinc reserves 
could represent 5 million tons and 6 million tons, respectively. The country has the world’s largest 
diamond reserves––representing almost 25 percent of the total. DRC also has great potential to exploit 
major reserves of gold, cobalt, rare earths, cassiterite, and columbite-tantalite (coltan)––all located in the 
East. The latter two are in high demand by global electronic goods manufacturers. Seventy percent of the 
world’s coltan production is in DRC. Ensuring transparency and accountability in the management of 
these natural resources, building capacity to negotiate and value these natural assets, and developing 
strong public finance management and strong public investment management capacity are essential to 

7 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
transform natural wealth into development outcomes. These outcomes didn’t materialize in the past so 
DRC should advance on all of these fronts. 

29. 
DRC’s potential hydroelectric generation capacity could power most of the continent. Of 
DRC’s potential capacity of 100,000 MW,9 2,400 MW are developed, but, of these, only 700 MW are 
available to the population. As a result, power supply is heavily constrained and subject to blackouts, 
placing major limitations on private sector activity. Less than 9 percent of the population has access to 
(unreliable) electricity, compared to 30 percent on average in SSA. Improving energy production and 
distribution to households and local private companies will spur economic activities and generate growth. 
However, these improvements will require (i) the development of an appropriate regulatory framework 
that can attract private sector participation and (ii) deep reforms in the governance of the national power 
utility and strengthened oversight of this entity in addition to a revision of the current monopoly 
arrangement. 

30. 
DRC has the world’s second largest tropical forest endowment and carbon sink. DRC has 
145 million ha of rain forests representing over 60 percent of the total forest area in the Congo basin, the 
second largest forest endowment in the world, and the second largest carbon sink in the world. On the 
other hand, DRC rain forests harbor 30–40 gigatons of carbon, which equal 8 percent of the world forest 
carbon, the equivalent of 3–5 years of world emissions of CO2 equivalent. Deforestation in DRC equals 
0.25 percent per year, the highest deforestation rate in the Congo basin, but still a low rate compared to 
South America and Southeast Asia. Their net deforestation rates are, respectively, 2 and 4 times higher. 
DRC’s deforestation rate is expected to double in the next 20 years providing an opportunity for the 
country to pursue a low-emissions development pathway by sustainably managing its forests (REDD+). 

31. 
The country’s enormous agricultural potential remains largely unrealized and could be 
its best source of inclusive growth. The country is endowed with over 80 million ha of fertile, arable 
land capable of supporting immense agricultural activities. The country ranks among the world’s areas 
with the highest potential agriculture value for the major crops : maize, palm-oil, soybean, and sugarcane. 
Today, only 10 percent of the fertile land is farmed, and 13 thousand ha are irrigated, a very small share 
of the potentially irrigable area (4 million ha). Furthermore, a stunning 52 percent of all fresh water 
resources in SSA are concentrated in DRC. The current land could support 40 million cattle whereas only 
700,000 are in place. In addition, if the existing agricultural potential were being fully exploited, DRC 
could feed 1 billion people. However, currently, even the relatively small domestic market demand for 
food products is not met, so approximately one-third of all the food consumed in the country is imported. 
Annual imports include 200,000 tons of rice, 200,000 tons of maize, 120,000 tons of fish, 80,000 tons of 
sugar, 60,000 tons of vegetable oils, 50,000 tons of meat, and 30,000 tons of poultry.  

32. 
Increased productivity, storage, processing, and marketing of agricultural products 
would accelerate growth and increase income generation from agriculture. Years of neglect of 
agricultural extension services have resulted in a low level of adoption of appropriate technologies and 
low agricultural productivity, confining farmers to subsistence agriculture. Substituting domestically 
produced food for imports could spur DRC’s agricultural growth by an additional 1 percent–2 percent per 
year. Poor infrastructure has locked down productivity and inhibited private investment in inputs and 
outputs marketing. Studies have shown that a 10 percent reduction in transportation costs could increase 
agricultural productivity by 6 percent. Increasing agricultural production by 10 percent could increase 
revenues by 16 percent, compared to 10 percent for services. Because of the labor -intensive nature of 
agricultural production, investing in agriculture would support job creation and reduce poverty. Increasing 
women’s access to agricultural inputs also would improve women’s livelihoods and increase food 
security in households.

Governance 

33. 
Indicators benchmarking countries show that tackling governance problems in DRC is a 
priority. The quality of public administration, as measured in the 2012 Country Policy and Institutional 
Assessment (CPIA), is stable at 2.0 (of 6.0), compared to the average among IDA borrowers of 2.9. In 
2012, DRC ranked 160 of 180 countries with a score of 21 of 100 and was perceived as one of the most 
corrupt countries in Transparency International’s (TI) Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI). DRC ranks 50 
of 53 countries in the Mo Ibrahim Governance Index. According to the 2011 World Governance 
Indicators, DRC ranks in the lowest 10th percentile on voice and accountability and regulatory quality; 
and as low as the 5th percentile on government effectiveness, rule of law, political stability, and control of 
corruption. This performance remains significantly below the Sub-Saharan averages.

34. 
Corruption continues to hamper DRC’s development prospects. Corruption remains 
widespread and is taking a heavy toll on public service capacity to deliver key services. Many high -level 
officials have tried to rapidly take advantage of their positions in a context fraught with uncertainties 
because of the repeated conflicts. Political turmoil that has lasted for decades in the absence of a strong 
executive able to impose effective sanctions has worsened the situation. At the lower echelons, the 
problem is compounded by the extremely low levels and still irregular payment of government 
employees’ salaries. The consensus is that, unless decisive action is taken in this area, DRC may not be 
able to break the current cycle of corruption, thus further opening the path to fragile institutions unable to 
reduce poverty. 

35. 
For DRC’s exceptional resource endowment to be translated into long-term, sustainable 
growth and poverty reduction, strengthening the foundations to build government’s effectiveness is 
an essential condition. While successive administrations have struggled to meet this challenge, the new 
government is determined to push forward public sector management reforms that will underpin a 
credible fiscal policy and sustainable economic development. Areas of focus include strong PFM, a 
competent administration at both the national and provincial levels, and transparent and effective 
management in the extractive industries as well as in SOEs. To ensure credible and transparent 
management of the entire value chains of extractive industries, major efforts are required ranging from 
contract adjudication to monitoring operations, collection, and management of revenues to delivering 
services to the population. 

36. 
Work is underway to strengthen DRC’s public financial management and public sector 
performance. Over the past five years, DRC has moved toward rebuilding a well -functioning PFM 
system. In June 2010 a strategic plan for public finance reform based on the 2008 Public Expenditure 

9 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Review (PER) was adopted. In July of the same year, a comprehensive legal framework was approved: 
the Public Financial Management Act (Loi relative aux Finances Publiques)10 regulates the management 
of public finances across the country. The new Public Procurement Code became effective in October 
2010.11To mobilize revenues and improve revenue management, in January 2012, the Government 
introduced the Tax Payer Identification Number and implemented a VAT . The Government also is 
committed to undertake a long-overdue, comprehensive public administration modernization reform. This 
reform will be accomplished through creating a proper legal framework, improving human resources 
management, and creating a retirement system. Similar administrative reforms are underway in the Kasai 
Occidental, Katanga, South Kivu with support from the Bank, and Bandundu provinces, and locally to 
support the ongoing decentralization reforms. 

37. 
However, to avoid potential risks to public funds at the central and local levels, the PFM 
system needs to be strengthened, and transparency and accountability improved. A 2012 Public 
Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) Assessment shows that the budget formulation and 
execution processes remain weak and that sector budgets often are not linked to the national development 
strategy. Consequently, substantial deviations between budget allocations and execution, in amount and 
composition, as well as abuses in the use of emergency procedures were observed. Particular attention 
needs to be paid to public investment management reforms that will improve the procedures for 
identification, selection, supervision, monitoring, and execution of investment programs. Even though 
basic systems of accounting, recording, and reporting are in place, DRC’s accounting system does not 
comply with international standards. A modern financial management information system has been 
introduced, but it is far from ensuring quality and reliability in reporting.  

38. 
DRC’s implementation of governance and transparency reforms in extractive industries 
is moving slowly in the right direction but more needs to be done to entrench transparency and 
accountability. A detailed set of measures aimed to bring more transparency and a stronger legal and 
regulatory framework to the extractive and natural resources sectors is substantially completed. Some 
SOEs still resist being more transparent in managing their assets and operations. Weak management, 
limited capacity, poor governance structures, lack of supervision by national authorities and absence of 
sanctions have been the key impediments to the mining sector contributing substantially to fiscal 
revenues. However, the organization of the conference on governance and transparency in the mining 
sector in Lubumbashi under the chairmanship of President Kabila on January 30–31, 2013 was the right 
signal that management of the mining sector may no longer be as opaque as it was before.  

Box 1. Economic Governance Matrix 
Following an impressive effort during 2009–10, DRC reached the HIPC completion point in July 2010. Since then , 
economic governance has deteriorated after reports of cases of nontransparent concession awards in the extractive 
sectors. Poor governance has negatively impacted the business climate and accountability and efficiency in revenue 
collection. 

Thus, a stronger commitment to transparency was critical to restore confidence with development partners . 
An Economic Governance Matrix was prepared by Government and agreed with the Bank, aiming to improve 
governance in the management of natural resources, improve the business environment, and strengthen public 
finance management. The matrix was presented to the Bank’s Board in December 2010, and updates were presented 
to the Board in April 2011, June 2011, and June 2012. 

Major measures include (i) introducing critical transparency measures: publication of contracts (particularly in the 
mining, forestry, and oil sectors and traceability of revenue; (ii) adhering to the 1958 New York Convention on the 
Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards and implementing the enabling legislation to restore 
investor confidence and (iii) fully operationalizing the Procurement Code.  

10Law No 11/011 of July 13, 2011.

Progress on the governance matrix has continued, with good progress on the publication of the mining 
contracts and related financial transactions by mining SOEs . As of early April 2013, the government has 
published 134 out of 135 mining contracts, and reached an agreement with the IMF regarding the treatment of the 
remaining COMIDE asset transfer. The New York Convention has been approved by government, and is pending 
approval in Parliament during April 2013 . The new procurement entities are operational and they include the 
regulatory agency, the procurement board, and the conflict resolution mechanism. (The regulatory agency will be 
fully operational once overstaffing issues are resolved). Procurement units have been established in most ministries 
and other public institutions such as the National Assembly and the Supreme. In addition, since July 13, 2012, DRC 
has been a member of the Legal Framework on Harmonization of Business Laws in Africa (OHADA)––an 
important milestone to improve the country’s business c limate. 

The new Government, which came in power following the November 2011 presidential elections, is committed 
to reforms and has taken positive steps toward improving governance in DRC. For instance, the Government 
organized a high-level conference on governance and transparency in the extractive industries in Lubumbashi on 
January 30–31, 2013.  

In collaboration with other partners, the Bank will leverage this momentum and has proposed forward-
looking measures as part of the Economic Governance Matrix. These proposals are being discussed with the 
authorities. New governance reforms could include institutionalizing the principle of competitive sales of mining 
assets which will automatically increase transparency, systematic publication of mining contracts, and transparent 
disposal of financial resources deriving from the sales of mining assets, enhanced role of CSOs on supporting 
demand side accountability platforms in the extractive industries, annual assessments of the implementation of the 
procurement code at the central and decentralized levels, publication of these assessments and establishment of 
procurement boards in all provinces and all ministries and key SOEs. The same reforms regarding transparency and 
competition also should apply to the forestry and oil sectors. The new Bank facility that supports negotiations of 
mining deals will be used to help DRC better negotiates its mining contracts. The country can derive additional 
benefits by adopting the new mining code drafted with the Bank support that should promote increased 
transparency. In addition, the World Bank has started to discuss the possibility that the policy matrix could serve as 
a basis for channeling Norwegian and German support to REDD+. Based on progress in meeting forestry -related 
governance indicators, Norway could disburse funds to the DRC through the Bank, potentially tens of millions of 
dollars annually until 2020. 

Business climate  

39. 
The business climate remains unfriendly to the private sector, and public sector 
institutions are dysfunctional. For example, Port services in Matadi are costly and inefficient by global 
standards. Container dwell times average 25 days, more than 5 times the SSA’s top performer. Crane 
productivity also is only a fraction of that found elsewhere. Not only is the quality of service poor (44 
days to export, 63 days to import), but also, at $10 per ton, port-handling charges for general cargo are 
significantly higher than elsewhere.  

40. 
Amid improving regulation, the small, underdeveloped financial sector is growing 
quickly; however, DRC’s access to financial services is one of the lowest in Africa. This low access is 
due to (i) high risks and costs of lending; (ii) weak capacity for long-term or large-scale investment 
project finance; and (iii) slow development/reform of the nonbanking financial sector , including 
insurance, pension system, leasing, secured lending, and other forms of financing. The extremely low 
banking penetration is apparent in the fact that less than 1 percent of the population has a bank account 
and the limited availability of branch banking (especially outside the largest urban centers). With the 
exception of microfinance, credit is restricted primarily to the largest companies or loans that are cash 
collateralized or benefit from offshore guarantees. There is some growth in the availability of trade 
finance (letters of credit, performance bonds) due mainly to the recent influx of large investment projects.  

11 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Infrastructure 

41. 
The limited infrastructure stock and its poor quality have hindered the development of 
economic activities and are a drag on private sector development. Regional Diagnostic Studies have 
shown that economic growth per capita could have increased by 5 percent per year if the country had had 
the same infrastructure stock as Mauritius.12DRC’s infrastructure challenges are responsible for a 40 
percent productivity loss handicap. Upgrading and expanding infrastructure are critical for economic 
development in DRC. Improving power supply could reduce costs to firms by as much as 80 percent, and 
improving feeder roads could reduce the cost of moving agricultural products by 70 percent. Dredging 
and upgrading could reduce river transportation costs by 50 percent. A reliable power system could 
increase manufacturing turnover by 60 percent and timber and mining exports by 30 percent.  

42. 
The bulk of DRC’s territory is inaccessible, making moving people and goods very 
expensive. Kinshasa is connected to 5 provincial capitals (Bandundu, Kananga, Matadi, Mbandaka and 
Muji-Mayi) by road, to 1 provincial capital (Kisangani) by river and air, and to 4 provincial capitals 
(Bukavu, Goma, Kindu, and Lubumbashi) by air only. Communication among these capitals and other 
provincial centers as well as access to rural areas often is not possible 

43. 
Communication is slow and expensive. The landline telephone network is almost completely 
destroyed, with much of its equipment either out of date or broken. There are no national fiber optic 
backbone and no broadband connection available using the existing infrastructure. DRC has neither direct 
nor indirect access to submarine fiber-optic cables. It is one of the few African countries that remain fully 
dependent on satellite for 
international bandwidth. The cost of bandwidth 
is US$4,000–
$5,000/Mbps/month, which is very high by SSA standards. By comparison, the equivalent price in East 
Africa is approximately US$500/Mbps/month and continues to decrease as a result of intense competition 
among submarine fiber-optic cable companies. 

44. 
The DRC is undergoing rapid urbanization. Its 12 largest cities are estimated to be growing 
4.7 percent annually. In 1956 the country was 9.9 percent urbanized. In 2012 , the urban population was 
estimated to be 37 percent of the total population, or 24 million people. This number is projected to reach 
40 million by 2025. With 400,000 new inhabitants joining the city every year, by 2030 Kinshasa will be 
the largest African city, ahead of Cairo and Lagos and the 16th largest metropolis in the world. All urban 
centers in DRC lack basic infrastructure and are characterized by their haphazard development, which, in 
turn, undermines economic growth. 

45. 
The DRC is endowed with abundant water resources but access to water still is a 
challenge. Its river network, one of the most extensive in the world, and groundwater resources, 
considered to be widespread, have remained largely untapped. Despite this abundance, the country faces 
major challenges in supplying water to its population. Today, only 26 percent of the total population, as 
compared to the SSA average of approximately 60 percent. The unavailability of safe drinking water 
poses a major public health threat. Young children die from dehydration and malnutrition, results of 
suffering from diarrheal illnesses that could be prevented by clean water and good hygiene .13 Women and 
young girls, traditional water carriers are thus prevented from doing income-generating work or attending 
school, because the majority of their day is often spent walking miles for their families’ daily water needs. 
Because they travel such great distances from their villages on a daily basis, women and girls also are at 
an increased risk of violent attacks.

Human development 

46. 
The very rapid demographic growth that DRC is experiencing makes any response to its 
difficult social and economic conditions even more difficult and more expensive.At2.8 percent per 
year, DRC has one of the highest population growth rates in SSA. At such a rate, the country’s population 
will double in fewer than 25 years, putting massive pressure on all sectors. Given DRC’s very young age 
structure, high fertility rates, and low levels of modern contraceptive use , this population growth is 
expected to continue unabated. Approximately 46 percent of the country’s population is younger than 15 
years old. Even greater problems with respect to human capital formation (such as in education and 
health) and job creation are likely if measures are not taken to address this demographic growth. 
Furthermore, due to the continuing high dependency ratio, estimated at 98 percent, rapid population 
growth impedes poverty reduction. Without a rapid decline in fertility, there will be no possibility of a 
demographic dividend for DRC. The total fertility rate was estimated at 6.3 in 2007, with differences 
between urban areas (5.4) and rural areas (7.0).14High fertility rates, close birth spacing, and teen 
pregnancies are additional major contributors to maternal and child morbidity, mortality, and 
malnutrition. Furthermore, by 2040, approximately50 percent of the total population will be of working 
age, most of them very young. This “youth bulge” poses enormous challenges to the Government on how 
to manage it so that these young people have a chance to be effective development agents. 

47. 
Despite some progress in recent years, education outcomes remain low. The primary 
school completion rate is only 59 percent compared to a Sub-Saharan average of 76 percent. Girls remain 
disadvantaged compared to boys; the gender parity index is 0.87. Learning achievement remains low: 
only 59 percent of pupils demonstrate “minimal” knowledge in mathematics and 47 percent in French 
(PASEC 2010). According to a 2008 study,1568 percent, or 3 million, of DRC’s 4.3 million youths aged 
12–14 years were out of school. Of these 3 million, only 71 percent had had some primary education. Of 
the 5.2 million youth aged 15–19 years who were out of school, 70 percent had some primary education . 
However, only 4 percent had completed 8 years of schooling. The situation was even worse for the 20–
24-year-old group (approximately 6 million youth), 93 percent of who were out of school and 75 percent 
of who were illiterate. Although more recent figures are not available regarding level of schooling, it is 
unlikely that the situation has changed much since 2008. Latest information16 shows that 7.3 million kids 
aged 5-17 years are out of school and they represent 28.9 percent of the population of children that should 
be attending school and that this proportion was reduced from 38.5 percent in 2007 to 32.5 percent in 
2010. 

48. 
DRC’s education system is fraught with deep-seated challenges, especially for technical 
and vocational education (TVE) and higher education. The quality and relevance of vocational 
education and training, which cover some 43 streams, generally are poor due to many factors. These 
include weak management, irrelevant curricula, obsolete equipment, and unqualified teachers. In addition, 
the consensus among stakeholders is that the training provided is largely supply driven with few linkages 
to labor market needs. As indicated earlier, gender disparities also are a central issue in the education 
sector. Over previous decades, as a result of increased access to basic education, student enrollments in 
tertiary education rose rapidly, from approximately 30,000 students in 1980–2001 to 338,000 in 2009–
2010 (although at a slow pace in the science and technology areas). However, the quality of tertiary 
education is questionable due to the low number of qualified instructors, poor learning conditions, and 
absence of a coherent quality assurance system. Less than 10 percent of teachers in tertiary education

have a doctorate, and many of the qualified teachers are overage (65 on average). The latter fact points to 
a critical staff renewal issue.  

49. 
Skills demand is becoming an increasingly important constraint to formal firms. Surveys 
such as the World Bank’s Investment Climate Assessment (ICA) seem to suggest that human capital is 
not among the preeminent barriers (governance, security, and infrastructure constraints) to private 
investment. Nevertheless, there is evidence that skills shortages and mismatches in key sectors such as 
construction and mining are an emerging issue. In 2010, 9 percent of formal firms perceived skills as a 
problem, whereas only 1 percent felt it was a problem in 2006. More medium-sized firms (23 percent) 
experienced shortages than smaller and larger ones 

50. 
Public sector financing of education and health services remains very low. During the 
years of conflicts when public financing were severely restricted and the state almost absent, faith -based 
organizations (FBOs) stepped in to administer state schools (Ecoles Conventionnées). Today, 72 percent 
of the 10.6 million primary pupils attend schools managed by religious communities. Public financing of 
education remains low and far below SSA’s average, putting a high burden on households, the majority of 
whom are poor. In the tertiary education subsector, too, cost-recovery mechanisms have resulted in 
substantial affordability barriers to entry to poorer students. An estimated US$200–$300 is collected 
every year from every student who attends a public university or other tertiary institution to cover a range 
of recurrent costs, including supplemental salaries for teaching staff. In recent years, national authorities 
have issued regulations to implement constitutionally mandated provisions for free education, but in the 
absence of effective state institutions, implementation of this policy has been poor. 

51. 
Similarly, in the health sector, the Government spends only approximately US$2 per 
capita per year––one of the lowest levels of health funding in the world, with most of it allocated to 
personnel in Kinshasa and a few provinces. Between 2006 and 2010, Government health expenditures 
(from domestic resources) oscillated around 4 percent of its budget . This amount represents a substantial 
increase from the 2003 level of approximately US$0.40 per capita but remains among the lowest in the 
world. DRC’s health budget execution varies highly from one year to the next. The Government has made 
a number of salary commitments (incentives and additions to the civil service rolls) that cannot be 
covered by budget commitments. In the last decade, international financing of the sector has increased 
substantially––on the order of US$200 million annually. Even so, disbursement rates lag significantly 
behind commitments because of the health system’s poor implementation capacities. DRC’s decades -long 
chronic underfunding of the health sector undermines the improvement and sustainability of health care 
delivery in the country. However, DRC has made progress in achieving consensus on a development 
strategy and technical standards for health. 

52. 
Current social protection programs, including safety nets, are fragmented and inefficient 
and do not respond to the needs of the chronic poor and most vulnerable. Although the PRSP 
specifically addresses social protection, the Government does not have a comprehensive social protection 
strategy (the current one was designed in 2004 and needs to be updated) nor clear social protection 
policies. The great majority of the country’s many vulnerable people do not benefit from any private or 
public interventions. The limited social protection services are concentrated in DRC’s most important 
cities and are offered primarily by FBOs and NGOs. In contrast, services provided by public actors are 
marginal, and their quality suffers from an acute lack of both human and financial resources . In light of 
the country’s damaged social fabric and widespread chronic poverty, social safety nets should receive 
particular attention. So far, however, interventions have been designed primarily as temporary programs 
focused on short-term emergency relief, especially in the conflict-stricken East, or limited to specific 
vulnerable groups. 

14 

 
 
 
 
53. 
The instability in Eastern DRC and the persistence of low-intensity conflicts have 
worsened already low human indicators in that part of the country, sacrificing generations for 
decades. In the Eastern provinces, continued armed conflicts and the total absence of effective state 
authority perpetuate significant human suffering, resulting in indicators that are consistently lower across 
the board, compared to the rest of the country. Gender inequality is high, and gender -based violence is a 
bleak day-to-day reality for a large number of Congolese women, as highlighted in the Gender Study17that 
was prepared as a background paper to the CAS. State institutions are captured to prey on the poor, and 
there is little investment in public goods and services, severely limiting the population’s access to basic 
services. The vulnerability of displaced people exacerbates the issue of access to services by the 
population. Furthermore, the persistence of the conflict in the East is consuming significant national 
resources and distracts the Government from addressing important development issues including support 
to social development programs.  

Security and peace consolidation 

54. 
Years of conflict and neglect by the Central Government have led to the near-total 
collapse of state authority and services in the Eastern region, allowing armed groups and criminal 
elements to operate with impunity. State institutions in Eastern DRC exhibit a marked lack of capacity 
and resources to deliver the minimal security and other essential public services that are the prerequis ites 
to addressing the underlying structural causes of conflict and violence. At the same time, years of conflict 
have destroyed most state-owned infrastructure, while continued insecurity impedes the restoration and 
deployment of state services beyond provincial capitals. These problems have been compounded by 
inadequate transfers of resources from Central Government to provincial authorities, further distorting 
incentives and leading some officials to profit personally from insecurity and instability. In addition, 
forced displacement is a debilitating consequence of conflicts and instability but also is a contributing 
factor, exacerbating existing tensions. 

55. 
Despite significant investments by the international community in Eastern DRC and a 
Government stabilization and reconstruction program (STAREC), peace remains elusive. Since 
2006, international partners have been heavily involved in efforts to address security, humanitarian , and 
stabilization priorities in Eastern DRC. The UN’s largest peacekeeping operation in the world, 
MONUSCO, with an annual operating budget of approximately US$1.2 billion and over 18,000 troops, is 
concentrated in the East, supporting efforts to protect civilians and stabilize the region. A massive 
humanitarian operation averaging US$300–$500 million per year is providing essential services and relief 
to millions of people. Despite these efforts, neither the Government nor the international community has 
been able to stabilize the region. 

Dysfunctional statistical system and lack of quality data 

56. 
Credible policy formulation and monitoring of development progress in all sectors are 
severely hampered by DRC’s poor statistical capacity. As of 2011, the statistical capacity was 74 
percent of the SSA average, particularly on aspects related to source data and reporting.18Monitoring 
progress toward the MDGs, IDA Tier 1 and Tier 2 population-based indicators, sector strategies, and the 
macroeconomic situation is constrained by a lack of trained staff, insufficient and often poorly 
coordinated resources in a donor-driven environment, and the nearly 30-year gap since the last population 
and housing census (PHC). Most SSA countries have completed a census in the past 10 years. The quality

of the database for DRC generated from extrapolating information collected from surveys will continue to 
decrease as the time lag between censuses grows longer. Routine administrative data are scarce, and their 
quality is uncertain. The needs of the decentralized institutions cannot be met by the available statistical 
information. However, a positive trend is developing slowly through both the PRSP’s results-monitoring 
arrangements and the Government’s funding for national price statistics, the population, and housing 
census.  

B. Country vision and poverty reduction strategy paper 

57. 
The Government outlined its vision in the second Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper 
(PRSP-2), adopted in 2011, which aims to reduce the country’s poverty rate from 71 percent to 60 
percent by 2015. DRC plans to achieve this reduction by maintaining a GDP growth of 7.2 percent per 
year and by increasing its public investment to an average of 19 percent of GDP. PRSP -2 rests on 4 
pillars: (i) strengthening governance and consolidating peace, (ii) diversifying the economy to accelerate 
growth and create employment, (iii) improving access to basic social services and enhancing human 
capital, and (iv) protecting the environment and fighting climate change. The document also expects the 
achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and the elimination of gender-based 
inequalities by 2020, both highly unlikely targets. The new post-election Cabinet Development Program 
2012–2016 provides a comprehensive implementation plan of PRSP-2. 

State effectiveness and governance  

58. 
The Government’s vision is to promote a modern public administration, to strengthen 
governance in the management of natural resources, and to streamline the management of state 
enterprises to grow their contribution to the creation of national wealth. The Government has taken 
significant actions to tackle some key governance issues. Concerning public sector reform, the 
Government adopted a plan to transform its state-owned enterprises into commercial entities in 2009. 
Since January 2011, most SOEs have changed their status to commercial, but the transformations are not 
yet fully implemented. SOEs have been commercialized and transformed into limited liability 
corporations with new governing rules and regulations and boards of directors. For the first time, 
performance contracts have been signed for companies such as REGIDESCO (water utility) and SNEL 
(Société Nationale d'Electricité). Hence, it is extremely important for the Government to deepen this 
reform, including strengthening the supervisory capacity of the Ministry of Portfolio to adapt to the post-
reform environment and ensuring that boards of directors and managers are acting in the best interest of 
their companies and the public.

In September 2010, the authorities adopted the Economic Governance Matrix to improve 
governance including transparency, accountability, and effectiveness in the management of natural 
resource, particularly in the forestry, mining, and petroleum industries. The economic governance 
measures aim to restore investors’ confidence and improve transparency in the management of the 
extractive sector (box 1).With support from the Bank, a review of the mining code also is being 
undertaken to increase transparency and accountability in the management of mining assets and resources 
and to ensure that DRC gets its fair share of its natural wealth. In addition, the Government is 
implementing a plan to reach the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) validation status in 
May 2013.19 

19The validation status was due on March 1, 2013 but final decision is expected in May 2013 during the Sydney 
meeting of the EITI board and DRC was allowed more time to address the lack of specific data. The 2010 report was 
prepared following the definition of the perimeter, which includes 46 mining companies and 11 oil companies. The 
draft report was circulated to the main stakeholders for review. The DRC EITI Secretariat is working hard with the 
authorities to redress some of the discrepancies in the financial data.

60. 
Regarding public finance management, in June 2010, the Government of DRC adopted a 
comprehensive PFM Reform Strategy for 2011–18. This plan is being reinforced to take into account 
the recommendations of the 2012 PEFA assessment. Furthermore, on March 24, 2011, to advance the 
fiscal decentralization agenda, the Government approved the action plan of the Strategic Framework for 
the Implementation of Decentralization (CSMOD).  

Consolidating macroeconomic stability, sustaining economic growth, and creating employment 

61. 
The Government has adopted ambitious targets to accelerate growth through the 
development of growth pole programs. The objective of these programs is to unleash the growth 
potential of key productive sectors including agriculture and agro-business, mining, and forestry. Under 
development program 2012–2016, the Government has identified 5 priority economic spaces that could 
be targeted for the development of integrated growth poles. 

62. 
The Government has an ambitious program to improve the access to and quality of 
infrastructure services including improving the management of utility companies. For the latter, a 
new SNEL Board was appointed in September 2011; a performance contract between the state and SNEL 
was signed in February 2012; and the process to recruit a service contract operator is progressing, with the 
operator expected to be in place by September 2013. In the water sector, an international water operator 
has been contracted under a three-year Services Contract to help REGIDESO reach its objectives under 
the Performance Contract signed between it and the state. The Government also is implementing, albeit 
with some difficulties, the railways’ (Société Nationale des Chemins de Fer du Congo, or SNCC) 
financial and operational viability plan. The focus is on major SOEs in the infrastructure sector which are 
critical to improving the business climate and to the delivery of basic services. 

63. 
Taking advantage of the country’s geographic position, the Government has ambitions to 
use regional integration as an opportunity to boost economic growth and create jobs. DRC is 
coordinating its market integration, infrastructure, and business environment with three regional 
economic communities. They are the East African Community (EAC) and the Common Market for 
Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) in the East, and the Economic and Monetary Commission for 
Central African States (CEMAC) in the West. With the African Development Bank (AfDB) support, the 
authorities have launched studies for the construction of the railway and road bridge between Kinshasa 
and Brazzaville as part of the regional integration in Central Africa priority investment programs defined 
under the New Partnership for Africa Development (NEPAD).  

64. 
DRC was admitted to the Legal Framework on Harmonization of Business Laws in 
Africa (OHADA) in July 2012, which will guarantee creditor rights and will provide more 
coherence, clarity, and impartiality to DRC's corporate legal framework. By coordinating business 
law among 17 countries in SSA, the OHADA treaty seeks to promote regional integration and economic 
growth and to ensure a secure legal environment. In the telecommunications sector, the Government’s 
policy to open its markets has succeeded in making the mobile phone service attractive to foreign 
investors, with four mobile telecommunication companies operating in the country. The Government 
continues to reform the payment system and the banking sector including the Congolese Central Bank, 
and to implement the roadmap of measures to improve the business and investment climate.  

Improving access to basic social services and enhancing human capital 

65. 
The Government’s vision is to strengthen human capital, fight against HIV-AIDS, reduce 
inequalities, improve the living conditions of the population, and promote community dynamics. In 
education, the Government has developed an Interim Education Plan (IEP), which was endorsed by the 
Local Education Donors Group (LEDG) in June 2012. The IEP’s priorities include the (i) development of 

17 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
a policy for early childhood education and primary education for all, (ii) reform of pre-service and in-
service training for teachers and education advisers, (iii) restructuring of the Ministry of Primary, 
Secondary, and Vocational Education (Ministère de 
l’Enseignement Primaire, Secondaire et 
Professionnel, MEPSP) management at all levels, (iv) reform of teacher management, and (v) 
development of new policies for school construction and textbooks.  

66. 
The Government has committed to strengthen service delivery systems in the health 
sector and to boost the achievement of basic health outcomes in the country. Some underlying 
strategic and planning work already has been done by two existing strategies. The 2006 Health System 
Strengthening Strategy focuses on the development of integrated primary health care services at the most 
decentralized level of the system (Health Zone). The 2010 National Plan for Health Development 
provides a robust framework for future directions, but it remains vague about resource mobilization and 
implementation. Some progress has been made in implementing these strategies, particularly in increasing 
access to a well-defined package of quality essential health services and rehabilitating health centers in 
targeted areas.  

67. 
HIV-AIDS continues to be a government priority in the 2011–2015 PRSP. Actions and 
reforms are underway to reduce sexually transmitted diseases and HIV; improve universal access to care 
and treatment; and mitigate the health and socioeconomic impact of the epidemic at the individual, 
household, and community level. However, huge financing gaps to support the overall health sector 
remain because the resources that the Government has allocated to the sector are insufficient to fund key 
programs. 

Protecting the environment and fighting climate change 

68. 
The Government has emphasized measures to manage natural resources and protect the 
environment. The emphasis includes (i) adopting and implementing legislation for the new environment 
framework law passed in 2011; (ii) taking actions to reduce climate change; (iii) strengthening national 
resilience to adapt to climate change, particularly because it negatively affects agricultural production, 
water resources, and vector-borne diseases. In addition to participating in the United Nations Reduced 
Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation in Developing Countries Program (UN-REDD), the 
Government’s intention is to rehabilitate and expand its entire protected areas network. 

IV. 

PROPOSED WORLD BANK GROUP ASSISTANCE STRATEGY 

A. Implementation of the Previous Country Assistance Strategy and Lessons Learned 

69. 
The World Bank formulated the previous CAS (FY2008–FY2011) as DRC was gradually 
returning to peace, and a new, democratically elected government was installed. Formed in March 
2007, the Government launched a social and economic rehabilitation program, which was presented in the 
first Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP). It was against this background that the World Bank, in 
collaboration with other partners under the Country Assistance Framework (CAF), elaborated the FY08–
FY11 CAS. The CAS was discussed at the Board on December 18, 2007.  

70. 
The overall objective of the previous CAS was to lay the foundation for a medium-term 
poverty reduction effort, with a strong focus on governance and shared growth. While drawing from 
Bank experience on working in post-conflict and transitional countries, the document focused on (i) 
promoting good governance and consolidating peace through strengthened institutions , (ii) consolidating 

18 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
macroeconomic stability and growth, (iii) improving access to social services and reducing 
vulnerability,(iv)combating HIV/AIDS, and (v) promoting local initiatives.  

71. 
The strategy was slightly adjusted at mid-term to further sharpen the focus of the Bank’s 
support to DRC. The CAS program was regrouped under three themes: (i) rebuild state capacity to 
increase access to, and improve the quality of, basic services; (ii) create conditions for growth and 
economic diversification; and (iii) increase access to health and education. The CAS Progress Report 
(CASPR), presented to the Board on May 26, 2010, also strengthened the CAS Results Framework. The 
CAS Completion Report (CASCR) uses the updated results framework as the reference for assessing the 
CAS program’s performance. 

72. 
Overall, the performance of the previous CAS program (FY08–FY11) is rated moderately 
satisfactory because the program achieved good progress toward major expected outcomes. More 
specifically, progress was moderately satisfactory regarding the first 2 pillars (rebuilding State capacity to 
increase access and improve the quality of basic services, and creating conditions for growth and 
economic diversification), and satisfactory for the third pillar (providing improved access to education 
and health). However the outcomes achieved (16 out of 30) were significantly more important than those 
partially (10) or not achieved (4). Notably, DRC reached the HIPC Completion Point in July 2010 and 
received a debt cancellation of US$12.3 billion. As a result of Bank support, the DRC also made 
particularly notable advances in road development (the share of high priority road network classified in 
good and fair condition increased from 13.8 percent in 2009 to 36.1 percent in 2012) , the forestry sector 
(forested land under concessions was reduced from 24 million to 12 million ha following the cancellation 
of 76 existing concessions), health (increased access to qualified delivery care from 47 percent in 2007 to 
77 percent in 2011), and education (gross enrollment rates of primary education increased from 64 
percent in 2007 to 93 percent in 2011). Some progress was made in PFM. Less progress was registered in 
decentralization, energy, and public enterprise reform despite the transformation of the status of many of 
the SOEs, due primarily to the complexity of the issues, weak implementation capacity, and, in some 
cases, insufficient political commitment. The CASCR provides a detailed assessment of results achieved. 

73. 
The Bank learned many lessons over the prior CAS implementation period. These lessons 
relate to the scope of the strategy, the choice and mix of instruments, addressing risks and changing 
conditions, involving stakeholders, working with donors, and achieving and reporting results.  

 

 Scope of the strategy. In a country such as DRC, whose needs are great and whose financial and 
human resources are limited, prioritization and trade-offs are essential. Going forward, more 
focused Bank strategies will require better coordination with donors, while ensuring that 
coordination inside of the institution is maximized.  
Implementing reforms. Reforming state-owned enterprises and public administration, especially 
in fragile contexts, requires time and a deep understanding of the country’s political economy. In 
DRC, 20 public companies have become commercial entities through the Bank-financed Private 
Sector Development Project. Taking the next steps, which include addressing the huge debts 
saddling these companies, has been a long process and one that the previous Government had 
been unwilling to address decisively. For these companies to become viable entities and for the 
country to benefit from the reform, the challenge is for the new Government to directly address 
the SOE corporate governance issues. 
 Choice and mix of instruments. Instruments should be packaged to deliver tangible and 
impactful results and not be a wish list of activities to be implemented. The role and importance 
of knowledge should be underscored, and the way that knowledge is generated also is crucial to 
achieve impact. Going forward, it will be critical to (i) leverage more strongly the Bank’s and 
other donors’ analytical work; and (ii) make optimal use of local knowledge to better understand 
the political economy issues and be able to support the necessary far-reaching reforms. For 

19 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 

instance, the latter will require strengthening dialogue with other stakeholders including national 
and provincial think tanks and academia; or initiate the review of projects by the beneficiaries. 
For these steps to succeed, the analytical pieces should be limited to a few key strategic areas in 
which the knowledge gap is the greatest.  
 Addressing risks and managing changing conditions. The previous CAS developed built-in 
arrangements to address changing conditions, and the scope of the strategy was adapted 
appropriately when needed. Mid-term reviews are opportune periods to update strategies, but the 
approach in DRC should remain flexible and take into account changes in the environment . 
Increasing beneficiary participation. To secure their buy-in, it is essential that beneficiaries be 
proactively and frequently involved during project preparation and implementation. The capacity 
of civil society needs to be strengthened and not taken for granted so that it can better engage 
with the Bank and the authorities during the design, implementation, and monitoring of the 
Government’s projects. More broadly, an independent, representative, and dynamic civil society 
needs to be fostered and engaged so that achievements in sector, national, provincial and district 
governance are sustained and adjusted to the changing context. 
 Achieving results and disbursements. Results are within reach, even in DRC’s difficult political 
and capacity-constrained environment. Disbursing in a post-conflict country is possible only if 
doing so is coupled with leadership, a proper M&E framework, and accountability. To achieve 
results, focusing on implementation readiness and disbursement arrangements during the 
preparation of projects is critical. Achieving bolder results that are transformational and 
identifiable should be an important piece of Bank support to DRC; thus, the need to be selective. 

B. Overview of the New World Bank Group DRC Country Assistance Strategy 
(FY2013–FY2016) 

74. 
The new CAS provides a framework for World Bank Group support to DRC over 4 
years, from FY2013–FY2016.The overall goals of the Bank Group’s proposed program are to support (i) 
the consolidation and expansion of DRC’s gains in macroeconomic stability, infrastructure, and human 
development through improved governance; (ii) the development of the enabling environment for 
sustained and inclusive growth and raising HD indicators; and (iii) the country's transition out of fragility, 
with a focus on addressing the developmental deficits that help to perpetuate violence and conflicts in the 
Eastern provinces. In addition to being aligned with the Government’s PRSP-2, the new CAS will absorb 
the lessons of experience and anchor country-specific analysis from the Africa Strategy (AS); the 2011 
World Development Report (WDR) on conflict, security, and development; the 2012 WDR on gender 
equality; the 2013 WDR on jobs; and the 2011 DRC Country Economic Memorandum. Finally, the CAS 
builds on the 2011 Gender study as well as lessons learnt from the Gender-Based Violence program in 
South-Kivu that was completed in 2012. 

75. 
To achieve these goals, the joint World Bank/IFC/MIGA program will focus on four 
strategic objectives. Making a serious dent in poverty will require a high economic growth rate for 
decades. In the absence of appropriate redistribution tools, only a sustained high level of economic 
growth will help DRC break away from its current poverty level. Achieving this high level of economic 
growth and ensuring that basic services are provided to the population will require an effective state that 
creates the conditions for the private sector to strive and a serious upgrading of governance. As a result, 
more jobs and basic services should be delivered, thus increasing the credibility of the institutions and 
helping the country transition away from fragility. The CAS’s strategic objectives are aligned with the 
pillars of the PRSP-2: 

20 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The first strategic objective is to increase state effectiveness and improve good governance . It 
supports the first pillar of the PRSP: “Strengthening governance and consolidating peace.” 
 The second strategic objective is to boost competitiveness to accelerate private-sector-led 
growth and job creation. It supports the second pillar of the PRSP: “Diversifying the economy to 
accelerate growth and create employment” and the fourth PRSP pillar: “Protecting the 
environment and sustaining the fight against climate change.” 
 The third strategic objective is to improve social services delivery and increase human 
development indicators. It supports the third pillar of the PRSP: “Improving access to basic 
social services and enhancing human capital.” 
 The fourth strategic objective is to address fragility and conflict in the Eastern provinces . This 
objective supports the Government's STAREC (Programme de Stabilisation et de Reconstruction 
des Zones sortants des Conflits) through a multi-sectoral intervention of assistance that targets 
key social, economic, and governance impediments to peace consolidation and sustainable 
development. This fourth objective also supports the first pillar of the PRSP: “Strengthening 
governance and consolidating peace.” 
 Gender and climate change are cross-cutting themes. 

76. 
During this CAS period, the Bank Group will continue to provide strong IDA support to 
DRC. The CAS period spans two IDA replenishment periods (FY13–FY14 in IDA16 and FY15–FY16 in 
IDA17). In IDA16, DRC has been granted an extension of the phase-out period to receive an exceptional 
post-conflict allocation,20 which continues to provide a higher per capita allocation than regular IDA 
support. The indicative IDA envelope available for FY13–FY14 is approximately US$760 million21 to 
support IDA operations. The indicative envelope for FY15–FY16 is estimated at US$500 million.22In 
addition, the Bank will work closely with the authorities to fully explore the flexibility in IDA financing, 
including the potential use of the Immediate Response Mechanism.23The mechanism could support the 
Government’s rapid response to eligible crisis and emergency situations as well as the potential access to 
the IDA regional program, which could provide additional resources for participating in regional 
integration operations. The potential use of IDA guarantee24 or hedging instruments also could increase 
the leverage of IDA financing. Finally, the Bank would continue to play a platform role in helping the 
authorities improve donor coordination and leverage financing from other sources to support inclusive 
growth and poverty reduction. 

77. 
Six principles will guide the development of the CAS. They comprise(i) making governance 
a principle for engagement, which also will require engaging more with civil society, including the active 
engagement and participation of women, and nontraditional stakeholders to enhance the demand side of 

20 The extension of the phase-out of IDA16 (FY12–FY14) increased the duration of post-conflict support to DRC 
from 10 to 12 years and the total amount of the IDA16 envelope by approximately 20%. 
21 The estimate of the IDA envelope is based on resources available from the IDA16 replenishment and is updated 
annually. The indicative estimate may vary depending on (i) total IDA resources available, (ii) the country’s 
performance rating, GNI per capita, and population; (iii) the terms of IDA assistance (grants/credits) and the 
allocation deductions associated with Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI); (iv) the performance, other 
allocation parameters, and IDA assistance terms for other IDA borrowers; and (v) the number of IDA -eligible 
countries. The IDA allocation is provided in SDR terms. While the US$ -equivalent amount is provided at the IDA16 
replenishment exchange rate of US$1.50233/SDR, the exchange rate for each oper ation depends on the applicable 
prevailing rate at the time of approval. 
22 This estimate will be revised on completion of changes to IDA’s resource allocation framework being discussed in 
the context of the IDA17 replenishment negotiations. 
23 This mechanism enables the inclusion of emergency-related contingent components in selected investment 
operations to support rapid response in eligible crisis and emergency situations. 
24 Only one-quarter of the amount of an IDA guarantee would count toward its IDA enve lope. For example, an IDA 
envelope of $25m can support an IDA guarantee of $100 million. 

21 

 
 
 
 
                                                           
good governance and in recognition that disengagement is the worst option; (ii) being selective and 
identifying impactful development solutions by focusing on geographically targeted interventions and 
enhanced coordination with other donors; (iii) using government structures to implement Bank-financed 
projects that support state effectiveness and capacity building; (iv) keeping fragility and conflict in mind, 
particularly for activities in the Eastern provinces; (v) maintaining flexibility in the design and 
implementation of the program to respond to changing conditions in a fragile setting; and (vi) promoting 
regional integration. 

78. 
Consultations were held with stakeholders in DRC in May-June 2012. They involved 
intensive dialogue with civil society, think tanks, youth groups, religious groups, Parliament, members of 
the Government, and donors. The overarching theme of the consultations centered on inclusive growth 
with an emphasis on job creation. The main recommendations were to (i) improve access of local 
enterprises to finance; (ii) reduce barriers to business activities, including red tape and constant 
harassment by government officials; (iii) support efforts to move informal activities to the formal sector; 
(iv) enhance the skills of the workforce to fill the disconnect between supply and demand in the labor 
market; (v) support the reconstruction of a statistical system; (vi) continue support to infrastructure; (vii) 
increase allocation of public resources to the social sectors; (viii) improve citizens’ and donors’ access to 
information, including publishing budget reports; and (ix) improve transparency in the forestry, mining, 
and petroleum sectors. 

C. Strategic Objectives and Results 

79. 
A limited number of outcome indicators will be used to monitor progress in 
implementing the CAS. Most of the results that will be achieved during this CAS period will come from 
ongoing programs, at least until the mid-term review. The results framework will pay particular attention 
to gender-disaggregated indicators. Strengthening national capacity for results will go a long way to 
reinforce the national institution for statistics and enhance national capacity on M&E. Projects will be 
required to report results quarterly, and the use of surveys will be promoted and made systematic with 
Bank-financed operations in addition to targeted impact evaluations. 

Strategic Objective One: To increase state effectiveness and improve good governance  

80. 
The World Bank Group-supported activities will aim to (i) increase transparency and effective 
management of public finances at the central level and in the provinces of Bandundu, Katanga, Kasai 
Occidental and South Kivu: (ii) increase transparency and effectiveness in the management of financial 
resources from the extractive industries and ensure that the country gets a fair share from the management 
of its natural endowments; and (iii) strengthen governance of the mining sector SOEs and increase the 
operational performance of other SOEs including the water utility, the power utility, and the state airport 
authority. 

CAS Outcome 1.1. Increasing transparency and effectiveness in the management of public finances at 
the central level and in the provinces of Bandundu, Katanga, Kasai Occidental, and South Kivu 

81. 
According to all stakeholders met during the extensive consultative process that 
preceded the preparation of the CAS, poor governance including poor management of public 
finances and human capital is at the root of the DRC’s development challenges. Addressing 
governance issues is critical for DRC to progress in bolstering economic growth, creating jobs, and 
reducing poverty. Support to public sector effectiveness will be centered on two existing operations: a 
new investment lending project and close coordination with other development partners involved in PFM. 
Actions are necessary to address the supply as well as demand sides of governance. In light of the 
entrenched vested interests and the culture of impunity that pervades DRC, making progress will not be 

22 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
easy. Key areas to tackle include strengthening the public sector’s capacity to manage public resources, 
particularly the vast endowment of natural resources, effectively and transparently.  

Analytical and advisory activities  
82. 
Following the Public Expenditure and Financial Assessment (PEFA) carried out in FY12 
with Bank support, an action plan to improve the management of public finance was adopted. The 
action plan will be implemented in FY13 and beyond with the likely support of the UK’s Department for 
International Development (DfID) and a group of donors including the European Commission, France, 
Germany, UNDP, and the Bank. The Government is keenly interested in direct budget support. Therefore, 
having a strengthened PFM system in place is critical. A PEFA update will be completed before the end 
of the CAS period (FY15), and the next PEFA will be developed in the four above mentioned provinces 
in partnership with other donors. 

World Bank financing  
83. 
Reforming civil service and restructuring the public sector are critical to re-establish the 
credibility and the effectiveness of the state. The scope of Bank interventions will be targeted to a 
limited number of ministries given the complexities of the undertaking, the huge stock of social debts, 
overstaffing, deep political economy issues, and the advanced state of degradation of DRC’s public 
sector. Two ongoing governance operations––the Enhancing Governance Capacity Project (US$50 
million) and the Capacity for Core Public Management Project (US$29.9 million)––aim to enhance 
transparency and efficiency in central and subnational public finance and human resources. The approval 
of US$67 million in additional financing (planned for FY2013) to the Enhancing Governance Capacity 
Project will increase the Government’s ability to improve financial and procurement management as well 
as strengthen capacity in the four provinces (Bandundu, Katanga, Kasai Occidental, and South Kivu) 
which already benefit from these operations. A new Public Financial Management and Accountability 
Project (US$25 million) with likely funding from DfID is being prepared to support implementation of 
the PEFA action plan. 

84. 
A new operation––the Public Service Reform and Rejuvenation Project (US$100 
million)––will focus its interventions on a limited number of key ministries. This project will support 
(i) improving human resources management at the central and provincial levels and addressing the issue 
of staff who have reached retirement age but still are on the payroll , and the competitive recruitment of 
younger, more qualified staff; and (ii) supporting the establishment of an operational public service 
pension system combined with the organizational restructuring of targeted ministries while introducing a 
meritocratic performance system. This new operation will build on the experience gained at the provincial 
level. The operation will complement ongoing efforts to reform the Ministry of Environment and Nature 
Conservation under the Forestry Project and parallel efforts to support the Ministry of Agriculture under 
the ongoing Agriculture Rehabilitation Project. This new Public Service Reform and Rejuvenation Project 
will not specifically target the SOEs. Instead, it will strengthen the capacity of the ministry in charge of 
the SOEs to be in a position to supervise and monitor the performances of the 20 public enterprises now 
operating under commercial rules and ensure that appropriate and operating governance structures are in 
place to foster transparency, effectiveness, efficiency, and accountability in these entities. This project 
also will support social accountability by organizing and building the capacity of local civil society 
organizations (CSOs), a critical element to strengthen the demand for good governance.  

85. 
The decentralization process provides significant scope for enhancing transparency and 
accountability at the local level. The Bank is supporting the development of public sector and financial 
management systems including personnel and payroll management in the same four provinces. Other 
donors such as EC, UNDP, and USAID are supporting similar activities in other provinces.  

23 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
86. 
Improving the collection and processing of data, as well as optimizing the use of the 
limited data available, are key elements in enhancing governance and decision-making. A new 
statistics operation financed by the Bank’s Catalytic Fund (US$11.5million) will be prepared to support 
the development of the country’s statistical capacity. The new operation aims to strengthen the DRC’s 
National Statistical Institute (INS), improve staff working conditions, strengthen technical and 
management capacity, and support the preliminary activities needed to gather the national census and to 
improve national accounts. Resources from the Catalytic Fund remains limited in comparison to the 
needs. Additional funding will be provided by IDA to complement efforts supported by the fund and 
likely will target the development of human resources, the production of sector statistics, and a 
comprehensive civil registration system. The need for more qualified statisticians cannot be met through 
external scholarships for a few. Therefore, the setting up a good statistics train ing center in country 
remains a priority, as does the establishment of a true civil registration system. The Bank will work with 
donors to coordinate their statistical activities in support of better data quality and availability. Joint donor 
missions organized to date for the Population and Housing Census (PHC) have shown the benefit of 
working together, but additional efforts are required.  

87. 
Accelerating the delivery of basic services and getting the state closer to the population 
require effective and accountable local government institutions. For these entities to carry out their 
mandated responsibilities in a country the size of Western Europe , the demand and supply sides of good 
governance as well as capacity building are essential. Competent and accountable local government 
structures will deliver better services that are locally demanded, thus increasing the resilience and 
decreasing the vulnerability of local communities. At the same time, effective local governance 
arrangements can help address overarching challenges to sustained development, such as corruption and 
mismanagement of public resources. 

88. 
Results achieved under a pilot program initiated in South Kivu have shown that 
consistent introduction of participatory public finance practices facilitated by modern information 
and communication technologies (ICTs) can enhance people’s participation in budgetary decision-
making and create mechanisms for effective public oversight over demand-driven capital 
investments. Implementation of an Institutional Development Fund (IDF) grant resulted in the adoption 
of provincial legislation that institutionalized citizens’ participation in public decision-making. It also led 
to significant increases in budgeted transfers from provincial to district administrations. Finally, closing 
the accountability loop, infrastructure projects that were selected for construction in a participatory 
manner have been completed on time and to the satisfaction of the population. Building on the knowledge 
and practice of workable ICT-enhanced participation in public investments, this program will be extended 
to the Bandundu, Katanga, and Kasai Occidental provinces. Civil society budget execution reports will be 
prepared by the National Civil Society Coordination Network. The Bank also will support the 
Parliamentary commissions in charge of finances to be in a better position to carry out the Parliament’s 
constitutional mandate over budget execution. In addition, the Bank will support CSOs’ work to clamp 
down on corruption in procurement through the Contract Watch Initiative. CSOs will be actively involved 
in supervising Bank operations, and the use of External Implementation Status and Results Reports 
(EISRs) will be generalized. In this regard, the work of the three CSOs that were awarded funding 
through the Global Facility for Social Accountability will be made public and widely publicized. The 
Bank also will support the organization of an annual international conference on economic growth and 
governance in DRC25 and will support the work of selected groups from academia, CSOs, and think tanks 
who address issues regarding economic management, service delivery, and good governance. 

25The first conference will take place in 2013. This annual conference will be institutionalized to open up the policy 
debate on economic growth, economic management, and governance.

An engagement framework will be designed with civil society, including women, to 
promote demand for good governance. This framework will cover demand-driven approaches across 
sectors and programs. The framework will elaborate appropriate mechanisms and institutional 
arrangements to engage with the relevant citizen groups including tools and techniques required to ensure 
broader outreach. The framework also will ensure women’s effective participation.  

CAS Outcome 1.2. Increasing transparency and effectiveness in the management of financial 
resources from the extractive industries and ensuring that the country gets a fair share of the revenues 
from its natural endowments 

Analytical and advisory activities  
90. 
The DRC is a country with vast natural resources wealth, but poor governance has 
deprived the population of benefiting from this wealth. The World Bank made a bold attempt to 
increase transparency in the management of DRC’s natural resources by supporting the implementation of 
the Economic Governance Matrix(box 1). During this new CAS period, the Bank will continue to closely 
monitor government’s implementation of agreed actions, will regularly extend and update the governance 
matrix, and will support governance improvements and capacity building of the main mining SOEs. The 
new Bank facility supporting negotiations of mining deals will be used to help DRC better negotiates its 
mining contracts. The Bank will support the creation of an Inter-ministerial Council to oversee the 
granting of contracts and mineral asset sales. Civil society also will be invited to the contract negotiation 
table. The Bank will further strengthen its policy dialogue to include discussions aimed at setting up 
mechanisms to improve local content of mining operations, which will include training of nationals. In 
addition, the World Bank has started to discuss the possibility that the policy matrix could serve as a basis 
for channeling Norwegian and German support to REDD+. Based on progress in meeting forestry-related 
governance indicators, Norway could disburse funds to the DRC through the Bank, potentially tens of 
millions of dollars annually until 2020. 

World Bank financing  
91. 
In addition to the capacity to manage the sector, transparency in the extractive 
industries in general, and in the mining sector in particular, it is critical for DRC to take advantage 
of its vast natural endowments to benefit its population. The Bank essentially is supporting DRC 
through two existing operations in the mining and the forestry sectors. First is the ongoing US$90 million 
Growth and Governance in the Mineral Sector Technical Assistance Project (PROMINES) , co-financed 
with DfID. PROMINES has been designed to address capacity building at the Central Government level 
and governance issues in the mining sector, and to strengthen the capacity of CSOs to demand 
transparency and accountability. PROMINES is helping the Government, the private sector, and civil 
society to prepare a revised, forward-looking mining code with embedded transparency requirements. The 
code will build on the lessons learned from implementing the current 2002 code. PROMINES will give 
DRC a better knowledge of its mining assets by developing a geodesic and geological database, which 
will put DRC in a better position to auction these assets.  

92. 
PROMINES also is providing TA to the oil sector by helping to draft a framework oil 
concession contract and preparing a diagnostic for the sector. In addition to the financing from 
PROMINES, the Bank is supporting DRC to become EITI compliant by 2013 and, going forward, will 
support DRC to entrench EITI principles and processes through a new Multi-donor Trust Fund (MDTF) 
under preparation. At the CAS mid-term review, the Bank will provide additional financing to 
PROMINES to tackle the governance, operational, and financial performance of the main mining sector 
SOEs. 

25 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
93. 
Good governance 
in the extractive 
industries requires supporting demand-side 
monitoring and multi-stakeholder engagement. With the monitoring facilitated by the Economic 
Governance Matrix, the Bank’s support has been critical in stimulating the interest of DRC’s CSOs in 
issues related to transparency in the extractive industries. The CSOs also are becoming more vocal on 
governance-related issues, especially in the extractive industries. This momentum should be maintained 
and expanded. In coordination with the Carter Center, the WBI is supporting a number of activities. They 
include, first, piloting the new Extractive Industries Contract Monitoring Roadmap by local CSOs. A 
second activity is supporting the accountability platform design/planning of the PROMINES Project . This 
activity also is supporting the active use of the Sharing in Governance of Extractive Industries (GOXI) 
platform by stakeholders to share, learn, and connect for action toward greater accountability and, in turn, 
to facilitate better development outcomes from the extractive industries. The platform is used, for 
example, by Katanga civil society to exchange with other CSOs on strategies for better governance and to 
secure better impacts for the local population. In addition, PROMINES will identify specific high -impact 
activities (short or medium term) in which civil society involvement is crucial for successful 
implementation on the ground. 

94. 
The ongoing Forestry Project (US$64 million) is helping to strengthen governance in the 
forest sector. The project includes support to decentralized forest management in the three main forested 
provinces: Bandundu, Equateur, and Orientale. The project also is facilitating the negotiation of social 
responsibility agreements between logging concessions and local communities; and the control, with the 
help of an international firm, of illegal chain saw lumber exports to neighboring countries. The DRC 
needs to explore aggregate offsets for biodiversity conservation - a mechanism to generate compensation 
revenues for the loss of biodiversity from forest exploitation or various extractive industries such as 
mining or hydrocarbon development. 

Trust Funds 
95. 
The Bank is also involved in biodiversity conservation in DRC through its GEF National 
Parks Project (PREPAN) and Conservation Trust Fund (CTF) Projects. PREPAN (US$7 million) 
aims at strengthening the capacities of the Congolese Institute for Nature Conservation (ICCN) at both 
national and local levels. The CTF, for which the Bank is the executing agency for the investment of 
USD$12 million of GEF resources, will provide long-term sustainable funding for the management of 
DRC’s protected areas. The DRC's biodiversity is of outstanding importance globally, most notably 
encompassing the World's second largest area of remaining tropical rainforest. Although as yet generating 
little direct economic returns from nature-based tourism, the country has a huge potential to generate 
revenues from its biodiversity endowment. Gorilla-based tourism in Virunga National Park generated 
about $1 million per year of revenues for ICCN, a significant part of its budget, up until early 2012, at 
which time civil strife effectively brought a halt to tourism in this area. This amount is only a tiny fraction 
of future potential revenue country-wide, once minimal infrastructure and security measures are in place. 

96. 
The Bank also is involved in three forest/climate change projects. The Congo Basin Forest 
is the second largest carbon sink in the world. Compared to business as usual, reduced deforestation 
would significantly help to reduce world CO2 emissions (box 2). 

26 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Box 2. Forests and Climate Change in DRC 
The rainforest in the Congo Basin is the second largest rainforest in the world behind the Amazon Basin, 
with 300 million hectares (ha) compared to the 800 million ha in the Amazon. Roughly 50 percent (145 
million ha) of the Congo Basin rainforest lies within DRC’s boundaries. Since 1990, DRC’s deforestation rate 
has remained constant at 0.25%, which equates to the loss of 362,000 ha of trees annually. Compared to a 
business-as-usual development scenario in DRC, using current demographic and socioeconomic development 
trends, future environmental impacts caused by land degradation and deforestation might be significantly higher. 
Potentially 12–13 million ha could be deforested and 21–22 million ha degraded by 2030. Emissions would 
equate to 400 million tons of CO2in 2030, resulting from an increase of emissions by 3%–4% annually from 
2010–30. 

The Forest Carbon Partnership Facility (FCPF) is a multi-donor initiative led by the World Bank. FCPF, 
along with other partners such as UNDP and the Norwegian Agency for Development (NORAD), is assisting 
DRC to become ready to benefit from REDD+ (reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation 
while promoting conservation of forest carbon stocks, sustainable management of forest, and enhancement of 
forest carbon stocks). The country has made considerable progress on this front and is well on track to hav e all 
key elements of “REDD Readiness” in place by the end of 2014. In addition, the Forest Investment Program 
(US$36 million from the Climate Investment Funds, or CIF) will support pilot investments to reduce 
deforestation in the vicinity of Kinshasa. 

In parallel to the REDD Readiness process and in close cooperation with NGOs and private partners, the 
DRC is developing early ideas relative to a first Emission Reduction Programme (ER -Programme) in 
Bandundu Province. Once completed and submitted to the FCPF Carbon Fund, the country might enter into 
negotiations with the Carbon Fund for the sale/purchase of emission reductions to be generated under the 
program. These negotiations might lead to the signature of an Emission Reduction Purchase Agreement (ERPA), 
which would be one of the first REDD+-based carbon-forward transactions in the world. The nominal value of 
the ERPA would depend on the specifics and performance of the Programme, but it is expected to amount to 10 
million tons of CO2 or US$50 million over 2015–20. Other buyers could acquire the leftovers of this program. 

The Bio Carbon Fund, for which the World Bank acts as a Trustee, supports the Ibi Bateke Carbon Sink 
Project, the first registered Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) project in Central Africa . The project is 
aimed at reforesting degraded lands around Kinshasa while providing a sustainable source of charcoal to the 
country's capital and testing carbon finance as a source of funding for reforestation activities. DRC also signed 
an Emissions Reduction Purchase Agreement (ERPA), in which the Bank buys emission reductions, (carbon 
credits) from DRC until 2017. 

CAS Outcome 1.3. Strengthening governance of the mining sector SOEs and increasing the 
operational performance of other SOEs (REGIDESO, SNEL, SNCC, and RVA) 

World Bank financing  
97. 
To date, corporate governance issues have been addressed through multiple ongoing 
sectoral operations. They are the (i) Multimodal Project (SNCC, RVA), (ii) Regional Southern Africa 
Market Project (SNEL), and (iii) Urban Water Supply Project (REGISEDO). An Additional Financing to 
PROMINES Project will be prepared to tackle the governance, operational, and financial performances of 
the mining sector SOEs. The new operation––Public Service Reform and Rejuvenation Project––will 
strengthen the capacity of the Ministry of Portfolio to monitor performance and enforce accountability 
and transparency in the management of these entities.

Box 3. State-Owned Enterprises 

The 20 state-owned enterprises (SOEs) responsible for delivering the majority of public services across 
DRC are in extremely difficult financial position. Their restructuring and transformation is urgent. Most SOEs 
drain national fiscal resources, distort competition, and deter foreign investment in key sectors. The SOEs need to 
be thoroughly transformed to be able to deliver quality, commercially competitive services in liberalized sectors 
following modern corporate governance practices. All 20 SOEs are plagued with similar cross -cutting issues that 
weigh heavily on their ability to achieve viability. These issues include excessive indebtedness, deficient title to 
property and assets, unfinished separation of regulatory versus operating functions, and weak management know -
how and discipline.  

Due to the strategic sectors that they operate, seven SOEs are considered of paramount importance . They 
are SNEL (energy), SNCC (railways), REGIDESO (water supply), SCTP (river transport, railways, and ports), 
RVF (river management and hydrology in support of r iver transport), RVA (airports authority and operator) and 
Gecamines (mining enterprise controlling vast territories for exploration on behalf of government). 
Transformation of the SOEs involves three phases: stabilization, restructuring, and rehabilitatio n. Four of the 7 
SOEs (SNCC, Gecamines, SCTP, and RVA) received stabilization assistance from international teams of 
management experts with limited success. The Belgian private operator , Vecturis, is helping SNCC through the 
next phases of its transformat ion. In 2012, to improve its operational and financial management, RVA signed a 
results-based TA arrangement with a foreign airport agency, Aéroports de Paris (AdPi). The Government has 
signed performance contracts with SNEL and REGIDESO to be backed by performance-based service contracts 
with international companies. Such an arrangement is in place at REGIDESO and setting up the same 
arrangement with SNEL will take place by September 2013.  A similar plan is being contemplated for SCTP.  

98. 
Gender. The Bank will proactively support the establishment of mechanisms for greater 
gender inclusion in policy- and decision-making bodies at the local and community levels. Through the 
support of the Global Partnership for Social Accountability (GPSA), CSOs representing women at the 
national and local levels will receive capacity building support. In synergy with the Bank’s mining 
assistance program, the Nordic Human Rights Trust Fund could be leveraged to address women’s and 
children’s rights in mining areas. Improved collection of gender-disaggregated data and analysis of 
gender issues will be supported through the Catalytic Project to Strengthen the National Statistical 
Institute.  

Development partners 
99. 
The Bank will collaborate with the IMF to define and monitor economic governance reforms 
in DRC. Other development partners include DfID (joint financing of the ongoing mining project, 
PROMINES, and PFM); AfDB (PFM governance; and capacity building in energy, transport, and water 
sectors); UNDP (justice, statistics); European Commission (PFM and 
justice), Belgium/CTB 
(governance); and USAID (natural resource management, or NRM).  

Strategic Objective Two: To boost competitiveness to accelerate private-sector-led growth and job 
creation 

100. 
The CAS will help support the design and implementation of growth pole programs in 2 
of the 5 priority economic zones identified in the Government PRSP-2 (2011–2015). The CAS will 
initiate a new approach that focuses on transformational projects in energy, transport, skills development, 
ICT, and agriculture under a growth pole approach in specific and limited geographic areas around two 
zones (Western and Southeastern DRC).26 This approach is justified by the country’s large size and the 
importance of achieving impact that will facilitate replication in other places. The CAS will focus on four 
outcomes: (i) enhanced business environment for PSD; (ii) improved access to quality broadband network 

26 AfDB will support the development of a growth pole in the Bandundu, Kasai Occidental, Kasai Orientale, 
Maniema provinces, and northern Katanga province. This project will be a key piece of the AfDB’s new Country 
Assistance Strategy, which is under preparation. 

28 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                           
and services at reduced cost; (iii) increased generation of energy and improved and increased access to it; 
and (iv) increased agriculture productivity and production and access to markets. 

CAS Outcome 2.1.  Enhanced business environment for private sector development 

101. 
The Bank, IFC and MIGA will collaborate closely to actively support job-creating 
private sector development in DRC. IFC’s planned operations in DRC for FY13–FY16 are in line with 
the CAS’ second strategic objective, which aims to boost competitiveness by accelerating private -sector-
led growth to create jobs. Since 2007, the 3 pillars of IFC’s post-conflict initiative in DRC have evolved 
around combined advisory and investment operations focused on (i) improving the investment climate; 
(ii) proactive project mobilization and developing key investment projects to promote high-growth 
sectors; and (iii) expanding support to the SME sector. IFC’s operations have resulted in an investment 
portfolio that covers finance, telecommunications, and mining. IFC’s advisory services, supported by the 
CASA (Conflict-Affected States in Africa) Initiative, and in collaboration with the Bank, have focused on 
SME banking, microfinance, investment climate (OHADA, business reforms, and the establishment of a 
framework for Special Economic Zones), SME development support, and the provision of risk capital and 
advisory services to small businesses. MIGA’s planned engagement in DRC is also directly in line with 
the CAS’s second strategic objective. MIGA’s business strategy prioritizes IDA countries and post -
conflict and fragile environments, and its product range is directly suited to investors concerned about the 
local business environment.  Over the CAS period, MIGA will look to build on its existing portfolio in 
the country, which already covers the infrastructure and financial sectors.  

102. 
During the FY2013–FY2016 period, IFC will continue to partner with the Bank based on 
achievements and lessons learned in the previous CAS period and in accordance with the February 
22, 2012 guidance given by the Corporate Operations Committee to support a phased re-
engagement in DRC (following the suspension of new IFC activities since 2009). The guidance provides 
for investments in SMEs to benefit the base of the pyramid with no government involvement and 
continued advisory services work. The guidance also states that full re-engagement with real sector 
advisor and investing will be possible only following the DRC government’s clear commitment to good 
governance, notably via accession to the New York Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of 
Foreign Arbitral Awards. When possible, full reengagement will enable IFC to resume direct and large-
scale/transformational investments in all growth sectors through targeted sector strategies with the Bank; 
facilitate private sector entry to infrastructure markets and service delivery; and support deeper and more 
impactful investment climate reforms. Alongside the Bank and IFC, MIGA will look for new 
opportunities to support private investment into the country. It will do this either on its own or in 
partnership with the broader Bank Group, replicating successful experience of joint collaboration 
elsewhere, where MIGA’s guarantees have been used alongside other World Bank products such as IFC 
loans or Partial Risk Guarantees.  

Analytical and Advisory Activities 
103. 
Strengthening the capacity of SMEs to take advantage of business opportunities and to 
effectively and efficiently manage their existing businesses is important for DRC. IFC/Bank support 
for SME development will be provided through the DRC SME Development Program (second phase), 
which will design/establish a privately owned SME Facility with a virtual scheme in key markets to roll 
out IFC SME Management Solutions (Business Edge, SME toolkit, SME Governance). Working with 
lead firms in agribusiness, light manufacturing, and telecommunications, the DRC SME Development 
Program aims to increase the reach of SMEs through inclusive supply chains. The program also will 
intensify SMEs’ linkages to financial institutions. The program’s delivery model will be strengthened 
with additional resources provided by the Bank to scale it up and reach a much larger number of SMEs, 

29 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
including female entrepreneurs. The program also will help develop integrated packages and promote new 
products and tools (certification, corporate governance, standards). 

104. 
Strengthening DRC’s financial sector to ensure that economic activities are financed is 
critical for the development of private-sector-led growth and job creation. A Financial Sector 
Assessment Program (FSAP) is planned for FY2014. The FSAP will be a key element of the Bank’s 
assistance to help DRC strengthen its institutions and practices to provide adequate financing, payments 
support, and insurance against PSD risks. These risks are associated with short-term credit, trade 
facilitation, and long-term infrastructure finance facilities. A modern payment system will be 
implemented by end-2013. It will be financed through the new Financial Sector Support operation. A 
skills development study, an Investment Climate Strategy, and an ICT policy advisory note will address 
some of the knowledge gaps and support policy dialogue. 

105. 
Furthermore, Bank engagement will include (i) a strategic partnership on supply chains 
with the Proactive Investment Promotion Platform and the Project Development Facility (PDF), which 
were presented to, and welcomed by, donors in December 2012; and (ii) the program for reopening closed 
companies that the Bank is pursuing to support jobs creation. These activities include the identified case 
of Bas-Congo, which will return approximately 150,000 small farmers to productive economic activities; 
and (iii) options to carry out adhoc operations such as Kintech (the technical pole of Kinshasa’s creative 
industries), Kinmeubles (clustered furniture city), and Kinmecanics (motor vehicle repair/maintenance) 
with common services centers from which IFC could deploy its support programs to SMEs. In addition, 
IFC, through its CASA initiative, will continue to support the Bank’s PSD operations. 

World Bank Group financing. 
106. 
The Western DRC Agriculture-based Growth Pole will build on DRC’s comparative 
advantage in agriculture and the unmet demand for cheaper food for the 10 million inhabitants of 
Kinshasa. Anew Agriculture-based Growth Poles Project (AGPP) (US$110 million) will be prepared 
with IFC. The project will address critical bottlenecks in infrastructure and business climate by focusing 
on the Boma-Matadi-Kinshasa corridor (Bas Congo and Kinshasa Provinces) and building on programs 
already financed by other donors in the same geographic area. The project will deploy a critical mass of 
concrete, complementary interventions in the locations of highest potential. Examples of interventions are 
feeder roads, transportation, logistics, power, water supply, agriculture interventions, support to 
agribusiness, access to finance, support to SMEs, and trade facilitation. The project will select groups of 
interrelated industries with high employment potential that could drive growth in the intervention zones.  

107. 
Efforts to address skills gaps also will be supported. To respond to the skills needs, the 
Bank will use the ongoing analytical work on skills and competencies. IFC will contribute technical 
support to the Bank’s planned AGPP including (i) incorporation of the deliverables of the IFC/WB-
supported SEZ Program and continued provision of TA by IFC; (ii) provision of business development 
services to SMEs’ beneficiaries of the linkages created by the AGPP; and (iii) technical support aimed at 
addressing some key investment climate issues that constrain the creation and operation of SMEs. The 
project is being developed through the intensive engagement of the private sector. Efforts will be made to 
attract Congolese individuals, including the diaspora, to invest and develop micro, small, and medium-
scale companies.  

108. 
To re-launch the private sector, increasing SMEs’ access to finance and supporting the 
development of the financial sector in DRC are essential. The World Bank will prepare a new financial 
sector development project. This project will aim to modernize the DRC's banking, microfinance, and 
public sectors to enable effective and timely delivery of financing to private sector entrepreneurs and 
households. The project also will help increase availability of funds among trading partners nationally and 
internationally by enabling electronic payments and money transfers to be available almost immediately 

30 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and accurately, replacing the time-consuming manual clearing and settlement of payments that is subject 
to delays and errors. The new operation also will provide support to the growth of the microfinance 
industry in continuity with the $7 million in IDA funds in circulation among the Microfinance Promotion 
Fund (FPM) and various commercial banks and microfinance institutions, thereby fueling the expansion 
of the sector using cheaper long-term credit. IFC will further develop the range of products suitable to 
DRC’s financial markets and help build efficient financial infrastructure. Through its Central African 
SME Fund (CASF) and in close collaboration with the SME Development Program, IFC’s SME Ventures 
Program will expand the provision of risk capital and advisory services to a greater number of small 
businesses. 

109. 
In addition, as part of its partnership with the MasterCard Foundation to scale up 
microfinance in Africa, IFC will continue to expand its microfinance programs in DRC to increase 
and support the number of commercially viable microfinance institutions and broaden SMEs’ 
access to financial services. IFC also will explore the possibility of complementing the Bank’s support to 
the microfinance fund. In parallel, IFC will continue to help build the capacity of MSMEs to strengthen 
their credit-worthiness. When feasible, IFC will develop additional projects with local banks to support 
small business banking through its Africa Microfinance, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) Finance 
Program. These projects will include thematic- and/or industry-focused activities (such as agribusiness, 
education, and gender).IFC will continue to provide trade finance advisory to finance professionals and 
team up with the Bank to establish nonexistent financial infrastructure (credit bureau, collateral registries, 
leasing regulatory framework). Based on market demand, 
technical feasibility, and financial 
sustainability, as well as lessons learned from previous IFC/Bank experience, IFC and the Bank will work 
together to establish risk-sharing facilities and introduce/develop housing finance in DRC.  

CAS Outcome 2.2.  Improved connectivity and access to transport infrastructure 

Analytical and Advisory Activities 
110. 
A series of analytical works is planned to support the regional integration agenda. In 
Western DRC, the Bank is supporting the preparation of a trade facilitation study between the ports of 
Kinshasa and Brazzaville. This study, carried out jointly with EC and DfID, will help the Governments of 
DRC and the Republic of Congo (RC) design and implement measures to facilitate the flow of goods and 
services between the two capital cities. More broadly, the Bank will help DRC design an integrated 
development strategy to benefit its border countries in the West (RC and Angola), with particular 
attention to the interests of Bas Congo Province. Competition among various infrastructure options will 
be one of the principles used in the study, allowing for simultaneous development of transport, energy, 
and telecommunications corridors, thus guaranteeing continuity of service if one supply route is 
disconnected. A similar study is envisaged for Eastern DRC to review trade opportunities and 
competitions with countries including Burundi, Rwanda, Uganda, and Zambia. 

111. 
In addition, a new ESW––Spatial Economics, Growth Impacts, and Decision making for 
Infrastructure Investment in DRC––is intended to assist the Government in identifying the potential 
growth impacts of its  five “priority economic zones” (see map in appendix 14). These potential areas for 
“spirals” of growth form a part of the Government’s 2012–16 Development Program. Infrastructure 
investment planning often is carried out in sectoral silos, with little attention to the agglomeration 
economies that could result from coordinating and sequencing interventions. In many cases, when 
projects are evaluated independently rather than as a package, not only are agglomeration economies not 
captured, but also the result is overlap and duplication of services. AfDB already has expressed its intent 
to help the Government develop Zone 2, and the World Bank is preparing operations in Zones 1 and 4. 
Zone 5, the river leg of the Congo Basin Atlantic Corridor, will be studied as well. This ESW could help 
determine which zones and which investments within areas are the most efficient and the priorities for 

31 

 
 
 
 
 
 
economic growth. This ESW might be undertaken in collaboration with, and possibly financed by, the 
Regional Spatial Development Initiative of the Development Bank of Southern Africa (DBSA).  

World Bank Group financing  
112. 
The ongoing Multimodal Transport operation (US$255 million) will retain its critical 
role in supporting and revitalizing the core railway network in large parts of Southern and Central 
DRC, which could collapse without support from the project. The planned additional financing to the 
project (US$180 million) is ready and scheduled for Board presentation (FY13). The project will continue 
to help the Government implement structural reforms at SNCC (the national railway company) , 
implement a transport-sector-wide governance plan, and strengthen the transport SOEs’ operational 
performance.  

113. 
A new Urban Development Project (US$100 million) is being prepared to help secondary 
cities in growth corridors deliver basic services and reap the benefits from economies of 
agglomeration. The project will build up urban infrastructure through labor-intensive methods in the 
cities located in Western DRC (Matadi, Kikwit, and Mbandaka) as well as in the East and North Katanga  
(Bukavu,  Kindu and Kalemie), areas targeted by the two agriculture-based growth poles operations. This 
project will focus on how best to use local materials and promote private sector initiatives. It also will 
improve urban governance through performance-based allocation of project resources with links to 
revenue collection and strengthened financial management. Strengthened urban governance will enable 
targeted cities to better provide basic services to their fast-growing populations while supporting linkages 
to their rural hinterlands. This approach underpins decentralization by pushing resources to the city level 
and supporting inclusive local governance. The project is expected to help generate jobs in construction 
and related activities. The urban project will complement the reconstruction program supported by China. 

CAS Outcome 2.3.  Improved access to quality broadband network and services at reduced cost 

Analytical and Advisory Activities 
114. 
The Bank has started a policy dialogue to review the legal and regulatory framework 
according to best practices (no exclusive rights on fiber optic assets, financial autonomy of the 
regulatory authority) with the objective that new legislation will be enacted in 2013. Its approval would 
make DRC eligible for the Central African Backbone (CAB) program. 

World Bank Group financing 
115. 
The Government has officially indicated its interest in participating in the Central 
African Backbone (CAB) program (regional project). The Government already is participating in the 
public-private partnership (PPP) approach for international connectivity via the West Africa Cable 
System (WACS) consortium, and has installed a submarine landing station in Moanda and a fiber optic 
cable between Moanda and Kinshasa. Bank Group support is sought to develop, operate, and 
commercialize on a wholesale basis key economic clusters (Kinshasa, Lubumbashi, Goma) connected to 
submarine cable capacity with the quickest route (WACS for Kinshasa, cross -border connections for the 
other clusters), which will be linked together in a second phase via national fiber links. The Bank has 
started to review the legal and regulatory framework according to best practices (no exclusive rights on 
fiber optic assets, and financial autonomy of the regulatory authority). 

116. 
In addition, IFC will help improve access to telecommunications for populations in 
remote and/or poorly covered areas by building on the successful pilot phase with a mobile operator to 
launch the broad Village Phone Program. The targets are 4,500 village phone operators (jobs) and 
improved access for approximately 900,000 people. 

32 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
CAS Outcome 2.4Increased generation of and improved access to energy 

Analytical and Advisory Activities 
117. 
There is an ongoing ESW on rural electrification that will complement the new TA 
project on Inga3.DRC also will benefit from the Africa Renewable Energy and Access Expansion 
Program (AFREA) funding. AFREA is an Energy Sector Management Assistance Program (ESMAP) for 
Africa with the objective to support the scale-up of energy access and clean energy solutions in SSA.DRC 
has been selected as a target country for the expansion of the World Bank’s Lighting Africa activities in 
the region and a pilot country for the Africa Clean Cooking Energy Solutions (ACCES) initiative, 
financed by AFREA. Lighting Africa is a joint World Bank-IFC program to accelerate the adoption of 
clean, off-grid lighting technologies by households and businesses throughout SSA that currently rely for 
their lighting needs on candles, kerosene, and other inferior and harmful fuels. In DRC, the program will 
be co-financed with the Global Partnership on Output-Based Aid (GPOBA) grant and will target 
providing output-based subsidies for the dissemination of modern off-grid lighting to increase its 
affordability for the poor. The ACCES objective is to accelerate the development of the clean cooking 
sector in SSA in order to increase access to modern technologies and cooking fuels that will alleviate the 
adverse health, environmental, and socioeconomic impacts of traditional cooking practices. In DRC, 
ACCES will cooperate with the forthcoming Forest Investment Program (FIP) to complement its 
activities with the focus on the promotion of clean cooking solutions, such as improved and advanced 
cook stoves. 

World Bank Group financing 
118. 
Access to cheaper power is a key component of the competitiveness agenda. The Bank will 
prepare a new Technical Assistance Project with parallel financing from the AfDB to help the 
Government finalize the feasibility studies for Inga3 and midsize hydro-projects, select a developer, and 
prepare the detailed design of other hydroelectric sites in DRC. To date, the Bank’s heavy engagement in 
the electricity sector through the 2 regional energy projects (Southern African Power Market, 
US$560.6million; and Regional and Domestic Power Market Development, $US579.7 million) has 
yielded limited results. However, significant progress has been made in the recent months on the 
institutional front, including strengthening governance within the National Electricity Company (SNEL), 
as demonstrated by the appointment of a new Board and senior management, the signing of the 
performance contract between SNEL and the state, and progress in the recruitment of the TA service 
operator supported by the Bank. To prepare for the increasing demand for electricity in Katanga’s mining 
sector as well as in countries belonging to the Southern Africa Power Pool, including South Africa, AfDB 
has financed preliminary feasibility studies of a new 4.8 GW generation capacity at Inga (Inga3). With a 
hydropower potential of 40 GW, Inga is the largest and most cost-effective hydroelectric site in the world.  

CAS Outcome 2.5Boost agriculture production and increase access to markets 

Analytical and Advisory Activities 
119. 
Studies financed under the regional ongoing Trust Fund will enhance access to the results of 
research in the regional agriculture systems in Eastern and Central Africa (ASARECA) as part of the 
Regional Integration Strategy for Central Africa. 

World Bank Group financing  
120. 
The Bank will continue to implement the ongoing Support to Agriculture project ($120 
million), which focuses on support to farmers’ organizations and linking farmers to market. The 
project’s objective is to double yields for maize, cassava, and rice. To achieve its objectives, the project 
will enhance the capacity of 400,000 beneficiaries and rehabilitate 2,500 km of feeder roads to connect 
farmers with Central Africa Republic (CAR) and the Congo River. In addition, a new Southeastern DRC 
Agriculture-based Growth Pole Project is proposed that will focus on agriculture and agribusiness. This 

33 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
project will complement road and rehabilitation efforts under two ongoing projects in the Southeast (from 
Katanga to South Kivu). It will complement port rehabilitation activities on Lake Tanganyika financed by 
the European Union, and agriculture programs financed by Belgium and the AfDB. If these initiatives are 
successful in creating much-needed jobs, the Government, with the support of other development 
partners, will extend these programs to other areas. These agriculture operations as well as the AGPP will 
significantly contribute to supporting Government’s efforts at alleviating extreme poverty and 
malnutrition (MDG1). 

121. 
Gender. Boosting competitiveness by accelerating private-sector-led growth will facilitate 
jobs creation. The Bank program on PSD and employment (growth poles projects based on agriculture 
and agribusiness) will specifically support the promotion of sma ll-scale agricultural businesses run by 
women, improve their access to finance, focus agricultural service delivery on the needs and priorities of 
women farmers, and ensure gender inclusion in community-level and other REDD-related decision-
making bodies. This support will complement ongoing efforts developed by IFC’s Advisory Services 
programs for Access to Finance and SME Development program. At the same time, the Bank program 
also will make specific efforts to promote employment of male youth. 

Development partners  
122. 
Key development partners include France (AFD) (infrastructure); AfDB (growth pole 
project, regional integration infrastructure––roads, energy, and river transport, environment and climate 
change); Belgium (agriculture, rural roads, 
technical and vocational 
training); China (basic 
infrastructure); DfID (PSD, roads); European Commission (infrastructure, rural roads, energy), KWF and 
EIB (energy); FAO (agriculture), and UNDP/UNCDF (business climate). 

Strategic Objective Three: To increase access to social services and raise human development 
indicators 

123. 
It is essential that DRC address its stark social inequalities and raise the quality and 
stock of its human capital. As conflict situations stabilize, health and education services are among the 
most important improvements that people expect. In addition, investing in the human capital of its entire 
population, especially in the current context of high fertility rates, will position DRC to take full 
advantage of its enormous natural resource wealth in the coming decades and to garner long-term 
productivity gains that otherwise would be lost. The Bank’s engagement will emphasize both (i) financing 
essential services and (ii) maintaining strategic and sustained engagement to strengthen service delivery 
systems in education, health, nutrition, and social protection. 

124. 
Regarding IDA financing in the social sectors, a core principle will be to focus on 
strengthening governance and service delivery systems, while supporting delivery of services to the 
population. Another principle will be to build multi-sectoral programs that will have the desired 
development impact effectively and in scale, while staying mindful of the need to avoid implementation 
complexities. For example, the objective of achieving higher health facility utilization rates might entail 
incorporation of demand-side interventions developed in collaboration with the social protection sector. 
Another example could be to reduce DRC’s high levels of malnutrition through a complementary 
program of agriculture and health sector interventions. A third example might be to increase girls’ school 
completion rates by incorporating water and sanitation services as integral parts of a basic education 
program. While having a primary sector of focus, all future operations also will seek opportunities to 
build on synergies with other sectors to maximize service delivery and results. 

34 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
CAS Outcome 3.1. Increased access to clean water and sanitation 

World Bank financing  
125. 
Support to the water sector will be provided mostly through the ongoing Water Sector 
Rehabilitation Project, approved in FY10; no new water operation will be prepared during this 
CAS period. The project will support the Government’s efforts to improve access to potable water, which 
contributes to the achievement of MDG 7. It aims to increase access to drinking water in three major 
urban centers of DRC (Kinshasa, Lubumbashi, and Matadi), and to improve the performance of 
REGIDESO. The access rate in the targeted cities will increase from 43 percent at end-2011 to 53 percent 
by end-2015. This increase will result in approximately 1.2 million urban residents’ gaining access to safe 
water. The project will increase the financial viability of REGIDESO, and improve its operations. An 
international water operator has been contracted under a three-year service contract and has started to help 
REGIDESO reach its objectives under the performance contract signed with the state. 

126. 
In collaboration with the Bank-financed Water project team, WBI is launching a 
beneficiary feedback in the water sector called MAYINTIC.27The purpose of this program is to 
strengthen governance in the sector by supporting the ongoing dialogue between REGIDESO and the 
water users. MAYINTIC gives voice to users’ grievances, which are geo-referenced and aggregated 
through a short message service (SMS) data collection system. The data generated is made available to 
the public. Feedback to users on their complaints is done through SMS, exchanges with local water 
associations, and a television show on which REGIDESO representatives must respond monthly to the 
complaints received through SMS. This process of gathering beneficiaries’ feedback and monitoring 
results will be mainstreamed throughout this CAS period for other sectors. UNICEF is emulating the 
same approach by moving most of its M&E activities into SMS-based monitoring. 

Development partners 
127. 
The Water project complements programs supported by other donors. These donors include , in 
particular, the AfDB, French Development Agency (AFD), Belgium, German Development Agency 
(KfW), and EU. In addition, the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) and the Chinese 
Cooperation have projects in the same urban areas in which the Bank is active with its financing. While 
the Bank-financed project focuses on urban water supply, other donors, including the AfDB, AFD, 
Belgian Technical Cooperation (BTC/CTB), and UNICEF are focusing on the semi-urban and rural 
sectors. The Water project also is implemented in full partnership with the AfDB -funded Water project 
(2007), which focuses on investments while the World Bank supports investments and the reform 
process.  

CAS Outcome 3.2.  Improved access to health services in targeted areas 

Analytical and Advisory Activities 
128. 
The Bank will continue to support analytical work in the social sectors carried out by the 
Government and other partners. The Bank will focus its support to the preparation of a higher 
education strategy, social protection strategy, skills development, social sector public expenditures review 
including health finances, and the development of systems to identify and target the most vulnerable 
populations.  

129. 
Jointly with interested international partners (IPs) , the Bank will update the 2008 public 
expenditure review (PER) in the social sectors. Building on ongoing engagement on budget issues in 
these sectors, the PER will cover the health, education, and social protection sectors. For example, 

27 “Mayi” means “water” in Lingala, a local language widely spoken in DRC, and “NTIC” is French for “TIC” 
(Technologie de l’Information et de la Communication) 

35 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                           
building on the existing sector strategy in health, the PER will inform the policy dialogue with the 
Government, the decentralized authorities, and the donors to increase the effectiveness of spending in the 
sector and ensure that the Government allocates adequate funding to the health sector. Thanks to the 
ongoing policy dialogue on health sector financing, in 2012 the Government allocated more funding to 
the health sector and, for the first time, provided financing to procure vaccines. The PER will build on 
this encouraging development. In addition to improvements in budget preparation and execution , there is 
a need for DRC to track expenditures from the Central and provincial levels to service delivery points at 
the community level. 

130. 
The Bank, in collaboration with its partners, will undertake a Programmatic Multi -Year 
Non-Lending Technical Assistance Program (FY2013–FY2016) in health systems to identify and 
address key bottlenecks in health sector management. The specific areas of intervention will be 
identified in the coming months. Some of these areas could include drug supply and management, health 
information systems, health worker training and distribution, planning and management capacity at health 
zone and facility levels, and use of adequate PFM instruments at the peripheral levels. 

131. 
The PFM instruments will build on the ongoing activities in capacity building for budget 
preparation and execution in the health sector, financed by a Bank-executed Canadian International 
Development Agency (CIDA) Trust Fund of US$4.6 million. These activities are helping to improve the 
budgetary processes in the sector at the provincial and national levels in line with Government PFM 
reform. This PFM reform includes the development of multiyear budget programming through the 
introduction of sectoral Medium-Term Expenditure Frameworks (MTEFs) and support to decentralized 
budgeting processes in 11 provinces. In addition, these activities will strengthen institutional capacity to 
(i) improve health sector budget execution and results monitoring (at the central and provincial levels) 
within the existing budget execution framework, as well as (ii) prepare the sector to migrate progressively 
toward the new PFM policy and procedures. Such activities are expected to continue beyond FY14 with 
additional support from CIDA and, potentially, DfID. 

World Bank financing  
132. 
The Bank already has initiated support to DRC to strengthen its health service delivery 
system. IDA’s $75 million additional financing (FY13) to the ongoing Health Project ($260 million), 
which became effective in November 2012, will begin to address some of systemic issues at the central 
and health zone levels. The capacity of the central Ministry of Health (MOH) to monitor and supervise 
the implementation of the National Health Plan will be strengthened in parallel with the establishment of 
National Health Accounts. At a decentralized level, the supervisory responsibility carried out by NGOs 
will be transferred to the Health Zone management teams with TA provided by the project. In parallel, the 
project will finance basic health packages, malaria and HIV/AIDS control, family planning, pre- and post-
maternal health, nutrition, immunizations, and piloting results-based financing (RBF) of health services in 
5 provinces (83 health zones). The project will contribute to Government’s efforts towards the 
achievement of three MDGs (MDG 4, 5 and 6). The rapid demographic growth and high level of fertility, 
mentioned earlier as the central development issues in DRC, will be addressed in targeted areas by 
supporting family planning and birth control. 

133. 
Future Bank involvement in the health sector will use a two-pronged approach: 
improving governance, management, and financing of the sector while continuing to provide 
support to the delivery of essential services to the population. A new health sector project is scheduled 
for FY14. This new lending operation will help address health system strengthening, governance, and 
service delivery issues. Experiences from RBF approaches will be used to help formulate the new 

36 

 
 
 
 
 
 
program. Indeed, the Katanga RBF Pilot, which is being evaluated through an impact evaluation28 and 
routine monitoring data, is showing significantly better results in the RBF facilities compared to areas that 
have no RBF.29 Learning from this pilot will help shape the thinking of the potential benefit of scaling up 
RBF in DRC.  

134. 
Furthermore, given the weak service delivery capacity across the social sectors, the Bank 
will finance a multi-sectoral HD Service Delivery Technical Assistance Program (FY14) to provide 
strategic financing to strengthen key systems in education, health, and social protection.  

CAS Outcome 3.3. Improved access to basic education in targeted areas 

Analytical and Advisory Activities 
135. 
At the basic education level, interventions are needed to reduce the number of out -of-
school children, increase completion rates, and expand access to all, including minorities and those 
in the conflict areas in the East. Progress made in basic education calls for expansion of secondary 
education opportunities, particularly for girls, who are grossly under-represented. In addition, reforms to 
technical and vocational education (TVE) to better align it with the needs of the economy are urgent. The 
Bank is supporting a skills development study that should help define training priorities for the needs of 
the Western DRC Agriculture-based Growth Poles operation and for the Kinshasa area. 

136. 
At the tertiary education level, a robust regulatory regime to ensure a level playing field , 
quality of education, and value for money is urgently needed. This regime would need to be 
accompanied by reform of the financing system to improve equity in access (for example, the introduction 
of a student loan system plus a scholarship system for disadvantaged students). Given the low funding of 
the subsector, special effort is needed to mobilize other sources of funding, including from the private 
sector and development partners active in the DRC. 

World Bank financing  
137. 
Although major access and quality challenges remain at the basic education level, a 
holistic and integrated approach to education development in the DRC is necessary. To support 
inclusive growth, the country needs adequate human resources. Ensuring a minimum level of education 
for all citizens is a way to strengthen their participation in development, increase the potential for peace, 
and reduce vulnerability to conflict. Improving quality of learning is a priority at all levels. The Bank’s 
ongoing US$150 million Education project (PASE) is the current major operation targeting primary 
education, for which approximately US$70 million remain to be disbursed. 

138. 
Because of its leadership in the education sector, the Bank has been requested to manage 
the US$100 million multilateral Global Partnership for Education (GPE) for the next 3 years . This 
operation, expected to be approved in FY13, will complement the ongoing Education project. A key 
policy dialogue will center on increasing the national budget allocation to the education sector and 
supporting training of teachers and learning assessment activities. In addition, a new operation (US$150 
million) will be financed in the education sector to reinforce the gains achieved and expand them to 
secondary and tertiary education.  All three operations support Government’s efforts towards achieving 
MDG 2 and 3. The 2012 budget funded the education sector at 9 percent, higher than in previous budgets 
and the 2013 allocation has been increased to 11 percent of the budget.

CAS Outcome 3.4. Strengthened social protection 

Key outcome indicators expected to be influenced by Bank-supported activities: 

Analytical and Advisory Activities 
139. 
The Bank will provide technical support to help the Government review its social 
protection programs, update the Social Protection Strategy (FY2014–FY2015), and define a 
concrete action plan for implementation. One lesson from experience in other countries is that the most 
effective approach to prepare for crises is to build elements of a safety net that can be used in normal 
times as a permanent program for vulnerable groups (for example , infants, pregnant women, disabled) 
and be scaled up to cover others during crises. The assistance provided will focus on developing an 
efficient system by building on the ongoing institutional audit of the Ministry of Social Affairs (supported 
by the Street Children Project) and on the findings of the envisaged Social Sectors Public Expenditures 
Review, as well as on the efforts of other partners, such as UNICEF’s support for the establishment of a 
comprehensive database. The multi-sectoral HD Service Delivery Technical Assistance Program (FY14) 
mentioned above also will contribute to translating into concrete actions the recommendations of the 
institutional audit. Opportunities for partnerships with the private sector will be explored, giving special 
attention to the extractive industries to leverage governance efforts under Strategic Objective One. 

World Bank financing  
140. 
The CAS will focus on assisting the Government to improve the allocation and 
effectiveness of fragmented social protection expenditures and their impacts on human 
development. To contribute to social protection for the most vulnerable, the Bank will finance a Social 
Protection and Eastern recovery project (FY14) that will build on the positive experience of the 
Emergency Social Action Program (closing in June 2013). This operation will improve delivery of basic 
social services by rehabilitating and building community infrastructure, while at the same time fostering 
governance at the local level and building social accountability. Given the particularly acute needs of the 
conflict-stricken East and the proven effectiveness of such approaches in fragile contexts, a special 
economic recovery envelop should complement the allocation for that part of the country. 

141. 
Because a labor-intensive public works program was piloted successfully in Katanga 
province, it would make sense to launch a similar program with much wider coverage, setting the 
basis for a safety net system. Given the employment challenges faced by youth and the strong link 
between youth unemployment and civil unrest, a public works program should target the youth, and 
include capacity building elements to help them bridge the gap between occasional and steady 
employment. Whether these pro-youth elements can be built into the proposed new operation or will 
require a standalone project can be determined at a later stage and the IDA envelope adjusted accordingly. 

142. 
Gender. Improving social services delivery and raising human development indicators. The 
Bank’s program in the social sectors will focus on gender inclusion in access to schools at all levels. One 
of the components of the ongoing health project addresses family planning, reproductive health, and 
sexual health care. The proposed PER in the social sectors, as well as the proposed ESWs on higher 
education, skills development and health systems and financing, will consider and address gender 
inequality in the underlying analysis. Women’s needs and perspectives will be taken into consideration 
when designing and implementing the Eastern DRC Economic Recovery Project. 

Development partners 
143. 
Key development partners include DfID (primary health, water, sanitation and hygiene, 
primary education); USAID (health, education); EU, WHO, MSF, and Belgium (health); and AfDB, 
UNDP, UNICEF, and Belgium/CTB (education). 

38 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
144. 
Given the size and the importance of the needs, close coordination with international 
partners will be important to avoid duplications, create synergies, and ensure coherence in 
approaches. As an example of close collaboration between the WB and IPs, the World Bank President 
and USAID Administrator have called for a stronger collaboration between the two agencies, and DRC 
was chosen as one of the pilot countries for this initiative. As a result, the 2 teams have developed an 18-
month action plan to identify additional areas of collaboration such as the necessity to build the capacity 
of DRC’s health system to reduce parallel donor systems. An area of current collaboration is financing the 
2012–13 Demographic and Health Survey (DHS). 

Strategic Objective Four: To address fragility and conflicts in the Eastern provinces 

145. 
Supporting stabilization and peace consolidation efforts in Eastern DRC are parts of the 
broader development agenda and should include a regional dimension. In view of the destabilizing 
impact of continued conflicts and insecurity in Eastern DRC on the development prospects of the country 
as a whole, the Bank will seek to identify opportunities to work with other partners to optimize the 
development impacts of its interventions. In line with World Development Report 2011: Conflict, 
Security, and Development, the Bank will design a targeted, multi-sectoral program of assistance that 
builds on the existing portfolio and complements the Bank's already diverse assistance strategy. All 
efforts should be made to coordinate efforts with Bank programs in Burundi and Uganda, and 
communications among members of the respective country teams should be intensified. In addition, 
country management units (CMUs) covering Burundi, DRC, Rwanda, and Uganda will coordinate their 
work and information on conflicts with the support of the Nairobi Hub and in relation with the Regional 
Integration department of the World Bank Africa Region. The program will pursue two main directions, 
which follow. 

146. 
Leveraging national policy dialogue to support peace consolidation. World Bank 
engagement in national policy dialogue and reform will be leveraged to prioritize strengthening the 
accountability and effectiveness of state institutions in the Eastern provinces. The Bank will ensure that 
support for policy dialogue with the Government on economic governance, transparency, financial 
management, and management of mining contracts also extends to the Eastern provinces, particularly 
areas affected by or prone to destabilization and conflicts. Successful ongoing Bank support will be scaled 
up and extended to other provinces, including South Kivu, in which the current support is helping to 
improve inclusion, institutional transparency, and effectiveness through participatory budgeting. 

147. 
Strengthening resilience, peace consolidation, and sustainable development in the East. 
To strengthen societal capacities for local peace consolidation and sustainable development, the Bank's 
long-standing expertise and experience will be focused on bridging ongoing stabilization interventions 
developed within the STAREC/I-SSSS with longer term development solutions. The objective of Bank 
engagement will be to mitigate key determinants of conflict and instability; while strengthening the 
sustainability, effectiveness, and accountability of local institutions. Given the immense human impact of 
conflicts during the past several years, Bank interventions will target areas of acute vulnerability, focusing 
on war-affected populations (including returning IDPs, refugees, high-risk youth, and local communities). 
Particular emphasis will be placed on income-generating activities, promoting equitable and participatory 
forms of local development planning, and strengthening mechanisms for the peaceful resolution of 
conflicts related to land and identity. 

CAS Outcome 4.1.Improved management of public finances and accountability in targeted conflict-
affected areas 

Analytical and Advisory Activities 

39 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
148. 
To support the revised I-SSSS, and in view of the necessity for the Government to deepen 
a security sector reform (SSR)in order to provide effective security to its citizens, the Bank could 
support other donors that may want to review public expenditures in the security sector. In the DRC 
context, Bank engagement could be only on a supporting basis. It could be envisaged if associated with a 
credible, comprehensive SSR process steered by the Government and supported by a broad coalition of 
international partners heavily involved in SSR over the years, including the bilateral partners and 
MONUSCO. 

149. 
Given the Bank’s long-standing expertise and experience coupled with its convening 
capacity, it is well positioned to support a larger policy dialogue around the drivers of conflict in 
the East and the rest of DRC. The World Bank will launch a capacity building initiative to support 
national think tanks in analyzing sources of conflict and fragility, developing policy recommendations, 
and ensuring that the information is widely disseminated and discussed by all stakeholders . Multimedia 
campaigns will be used to disseminate findings and facilitate dialogue around the main issues. 

150. 
Furthermore, specific analysis of possible Government responses to the drivers of 
fragility will be carried out by the Bank together with local think tanks. A series of analytical 
activities will be undertaken to support an engagement with the Government on strengthening policies to 
reduce conflict around, among others, land, governance of natural resources, and local power-sharing. 
This analysis will be carried out in close collaboration with Bank partners, particularly the UN and DfID. 

World Bank financing  
151. 
The Bank will contribute to this pillar through the ongoing Governance project by supporting 
the Government’s efforts to transfer its share of budget to provinces, including conflict-affected province 
of South-Kivu, and improve budget execution at the provincial and local levels. The Bank will aim at 
mainstreaming participatory budgeting in all districts of South Kivu.  

CAS Outcome 4.2. Increase social economic opportunities in conflict-affected areas 

152. 
The World Bank will implement a two-pronged approach to provide support in Eastern 
DRC, predicated on rapid deployment for early results; flexible, context-driven design; and the ability to 
make corrective adjustments in the course of execution. This approach will build on some of the positive 
dynamics observed in South Kivu. Perhaps the three most impactful determinants of success in peace 
building are employment generation, improved local governance, and participation. These three will be 
pursued as key cross-cutting objectives under all activities. 

World Bank financing  
153. 
The first prong will focus on leveraging the current IDA portfolio to increase its impact 
on stabilization and peace consolidation. The Bank will examine how existing and planned operations 
could have more impact on peace consolidation in the East, drawing on the relative success of existing 
projects in improving economic productivity, livelihoods, and economic governance. This realignment of 
projects when appropriate will take into account conflict sensitivity, synergies with the UN and other 
organizations, and flexibility to respond rapidly to needs. The sectors through which a peace 
consolidation focus will be strengthened during the CAS period will include agriculture, roads, urban 
development, governance, and community empowerment.30 

30 World Bank operations identified in this context also will include existing and pipeline projects from other CAS 
strategic objectives/pillars based on their relevance and ability to contribute to peace and stability outcomes in the 
Eastern provinces. 

40 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                           
154. 
The second prong will focus on identification of instruments to drive innovative 
approaches. This prong will include a component on data collection and analysis and a component that 
will support quick experimentation with small projects that, if successful, could be scaled up under 
funding from IDA or other donors. The second component will be funded possibly through a strategic 
State and Peace-building Fund (SPF) or similar mechanism: 

i. In Eastern DRC, the drivers of fragility due to conflict have been well studied, and a number 
of organizations (from the UN to local CSOs) regularly collect data on a wide range of issues. 
At present, however, there is no reliable mechanism to link real-time data collection and analysis 
with interventions designed to address medium-term peace consolidation and development 
priorities. To test and evaluate pilot programs, and monitor their impact on beneficiaries over time, 
specific mechanisms need to be set up. These mechanisms are particularly important in DRC due to 
the localized nature of conflict and the enormous diversity and complexity of conflict dynamics 
throughout the eastern part. These mechanisms also will be of value to World Bank task team 
leaders and staff involved in the design and implementation of operations, as well as to local 
governments and international partners. The World Bank will work closely with UN, Government 
(particularly with the STAREC structure), and NGO partners. 
ii. A facility will be created to support small pilot projects that will be deployed rapidly and to 
test new experimental approaches. This facility will help identify implementation arrangements 
adapted to the operating environment in Eastern DRC (particularly South Kivu). The facility will 
address areas with priority stabilization needs that can be subsequently scaled up through larger 
projects. It also could support local institutional strengthening, easing the resumption of 
Government activities, and testing mechanisms for local conflict resolution.  

155. 
The Bank will develop an Eastern DRC Economic Recovery project targeting areas in 
provinces covered by the STAREC program. The Bank will allocate US$65 million to help build 
social cohesion and strengthen community-level capacities in local development planning. The project 
will also help reintegrate displaced people. The project will be based on CDD approaches already proven 
effective in other fragile and conflict-affected countries. It will complement activities that will be 
developed under the Southeastern DRC Agriculture-based Growth Pole. It will also complement activities 
undertaking by the new Urban Development project in the city of Bukavu , aiming to improve access to 
basic services. This project will undertake labor intensive public works, which would lead to short-term 
employment generation.  

156. 
Gender. When addressing gender issues in DRC’s conflict-affected areas, the fact that conflict 
negatively affects women and men in different ways and results in gender -specific disadvantages will be 
taken into account. The direct impact of violence falls primarily on young males, the majority of fighting 
forces. Women and children, on the other hand, often suffer disproportionately from indirect effects. 
Gender inequality reflects power imbalances in social structures that existed in pre-conflict periods and 
are exacerbated by armed conflicts and their aftermath.  

Development partners 
157. 
The Bank will prioritize collaboration within the framework of the Government's 
STAREC Program and the UN-I-SSSS. In doing so, the Bank will seek to identify areas in which it can 
complement and extend current stabilization and peace consolidation efforts that are aligned with its 
current portfolio. Where possible, the Bank also will seek opportuni ties for deeper operational alignment 
and synergies with key Government and international partners. It also will participate in key field 
coordination mechanisms (notably the provincial joint technical committees) to ensure that its operations 
are well informed and optimally coordinated with those of its partners. Key DPs include the United 
Nations (MONUSCO and other UN agencies, funds and programs involved in the I-SSSS), USAID, 
DfID, and key development-focused international NGO.

Climate Change 

158. 
Climate change in DRC and the Congo River Basin could undermine the productive use 
and economic benefits of water and land resources, and escalate the impacts of natural disasters 
related to extreme water and weather events. Therefore, it is essential to build the capacity to monitor 
and forecast hydro-meteorology (hydro-met) in DRC, and importantly, transfer this improved 
understanding of current and future climate to decision-making and planning as a way to build adaptation 
and resilience. Over the last decades, the number of meteorological synoptic stations declined from 125 to 
24, including 10 installed in airports to assist with air navigation. From 350 hydro-meteorological stations 
in 1960, the country has only 10 today: 5 on the Congo River and 5 on the Kasai River. Considering the 
need to understand climate change impacts and to enable the resources of the Congo River, whose 
discharge is equivalent to almost 70 percent of the discharge of Africa’s 20 largest rivers, a future hydro-
met TA project will be prepared to strengthen Congo’s hydro-meteorological services. 

159. 
This new project will help the Government of DRC as well as key stakeholders, including 
dam operators, river basin organizations, and the private sector, in reducing the uncertainties and 
shocks to climate change. It also will strengthen the application of more accurate water and weather 
forecasts in productive sectors such as navigation for river transport and aviation, as well as management 
of water for hydropower and agriculture. Investments would have to be cognizant of the complexities of 
water management in DRC and the need for training and capacity building, the vastness and hydrological 
uniqueness of the Congo River, and the critical status of hydro-met services at present. As such, 
investments will focus on optimizing hydro-met monitoring through suitable rehabilitation/installation of 
observation equipment, as well as bringing in data and forecasts from remote sensing sources. During the 
CAS period, significant advances are expected in the global understanding of climate change but also the 
ability to derive useful information from satellite monitoring.  

160. 
In the context of DRC, the proposed project could bridge these global resources and 
expertise to meet the need for relevant hydro-met information at country level. Equally important, 
the project would focus on improving the sharing of information and forecasts as public goods that are 
used in decision-making, particularly in water resources planning, climate change analysis, and early 
warning systems that would benefit vulnerable communities in flood- or drought-prone areas.  

161. 
In addition to this operation, the Bank will ensure that projects and other activities 
under the new CAS will be designed and implemented to integrate both the adaptation and the 
mitigation dimensions of climate change. Adaptation is particularly important in the energy (including 
hydropower), agriculture, and transport sectors. Complementing other regional activities supported by the 
Bank, such as the Inga3 case study in the regional infrastructure and climate change ESW, the proposed 
support will seek strong development outcomes while improving climate resilience. In combination with 
the support to strengthen the capacity of the Government’s hydro-met services, these initiatives are 
mutually reinforcing. 

D. Strengthening World Bank Coordination and Donor Harmonization 

162. 
Going forward, the Bank and IFC are committed to continuous and meaningful 
collaboration (where it is likely to add real value) to reach the highest development impact in DRC 
by combining resources and leveraging synergies. As part of the continuous joint strategy process, 
Bank and IFC teams will be planning joint dissemination and implementation exercises. Periodic reviews 
will be conducted jointly to track progress, make needed course adjustments, and explore additional 
opportunities for greater collaboration.

163. 
DRC is a priority country for MIGA, in line with two of the Agency’s key strategic 
objectives: supporting projects in IDA countries and projects in post-conflict and fragile 
environments. For this CAS, MIGA will continue to engage alongside the other World Bank institutions 
in the country and is likely to be most closely aligned with the private sector (second strategic objective).  

164. 
Currently, MIGA has 2 active projects in DRC that are guaranteed for investment. The 
two represent a gross exposure of US$30.1 million and support the infrastructure equipment and 
financial sectors. The two operations complement the Bank’s and IFC’s operations to support the 
economic diversification agenda. In the coming period, MIGA will look to further capitalize on its 
existing engagement. MIGA continues to offer its product for investors looking to enter the local market, 
thus supporting its own and the WBG’s wider objectives in the country. MIGA’s support for DRC will 
continue to be offered across its Transfer Restriction, Expropriation, Breach of Contract , and War and 
Civil Disturbance political risk insurance product lines. As elsewhere in Africa, these product lines can be 
used alongside other World Bank products, for example, IFC loans or PRG (Partial Risk Guarantees) 
support; or to directly support Government PPPs or Independent Power Projects, as applied elsewhere in 
the region. MIGA's Small Investment Product (SIP) also could be useful for the country, whereby more 
streamlined procedures could enable smaller projects to be supported. The Bank and IFC will explore 
further collaboration with MIGA in the course of this strategy.  

165. 
Traditional annual donor contributions to DRC are estimated at US$1.6 billion. The 
infrastructure sector is the largest beneficiary (37 percent, of which energy is 17 percent, transport 14 
percent, and water and sanitation 6 percent). The social sectors rank second with 28 percent (18 percent 
for health, 6 percent for social protection and emergency support, and 4 percent for education). They are 
followed by agriculture and environment (14 percent); governance (13 percent, including support to 
public sector reform and statistics,); and security, the judiciary, and democracy (10 percent). 
Development banks contribute approximately 60 percent of annual financial assistance to the DRC 
(including 26 percent from the World Bank and 16 percent from the AfDB). Europeans, including the 
European Union, provide 25 percent of the total; and USAID 13 percent.  

166. 
In Eastern DRC, partnerships with international partners including the UN constitute 
sine qua non prerequisites for leveraging Bank resources and enabling collective risk sharing. The 
Bank will seek to promote closer alignment among diplomatic, security, humanitarian, and development 
actors in the international community. This alignment will build on the Bank's current leadership role 
(together with the UN) within the Donor Coordination Group (DCG), and its participation in the 
implementation of the G7+/New Deal initiative. The Bank also will lend its support, through the EU’s 
Good Humanitarian Donorship (GHD) and DCG mechanisms, to the articulation of closer coordination 
between humanitarian and development efforts in Eastern DRC, to enable an eventual transition as 
conditions stabilize. 

167. 
Coordination with international partners will be strengthened, enabling the World Bank 
to be more selective than in the past. To prepare for such strengthening, the donor community, under 
Bank coordination, has prepared a series of 19 policy notes with the objective of reaching consensus on 
key policy reforms and providing a detailed picture of existing and intended activities. Among traditional 
donors, the mechanism for IP coordination is formalized through the DCG, which, until recently, was co-
chaired by the Bank and the UN. The coordination platform for PFM reforms recently put in place can be 
considered a model for the other sectors on how to engage in a concerted dialogue with authorities (box 
4).  

168. 
For newcomers, such as China and India, donor coordination is not formalized. However, 
China recently attended some DCG meetings. Efforts will be made during the DCG period to reinforce 
information-sharing with these key partners and further strengthen harmonization and results-oriented 

43 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
collaboration. Several IPs are developing their new multiyear strategies in parallel with the Bank. 
Appendix8shows the main donor-supported programs. The DCG will remain the Bank’s main forum for 
consultations and partnership as it harmonizes its selective approach to assistance and risk-mitigating 
strategy in DRC’s evolving operating environment.  

Box 4. Improving Donors’ Coordination in PFM Reforms in DRC 
Donors’ public financial management (PFM) practices are limiting the extent of their influence, particularly 
because of weaknesses in donor coordination. To address this challenge, and after the successful completion of 
the 2012 Public Expenditures and Financial Accountability (PEFA) exercise, international development partners that 
make up the PFM thematic group on public finances 31 and the Government signed a memorandum of understanding 
(MOU) to monitor the implementation of the PFM reform program and harmonize interna tional development 
partners’ PFM interventions.  

The joint donor/Government group will meet quarterly to (i) discuss the strategic direction and orientation of PFM 
reforms, (ii) review the implementation progress of the Strategic Plan for Public Finance Reform (PSRFP), and (iii) 
discuss any coordination issues in funding the reform program. Successful implementation of the MOU is expected 
to improve donor coordination and the sequencing of PFM reforms. The action plan will be implemented in FY13 
and beyond, with the likely support of DfID and a group of donors including IMF, European Commission, African 
Development Bank, France, Germany, and UNDP.  

In order to support the scaling up of the World-Bank-executed trust fund to be financed by DfID, a PFM reform 
program using a basket-funding mechanism through a multi-donor trust fund (MDTF) is being developed with the 
support of DfID. This MDTF should serve as a platform for better donor coordination of PFM reform by using a 
common basket-funding mechanism and increasing financial information about donor-funded operations such as aid 
budget and on accounting. 

169. 
DRC has requested and obtained “pilot” country status under the “New Deal,” the most 
recent in a number of successive paradigms intended to improve the qua lity of donor support to 
fragile and post-conflict states. Three aspects of the New Deal could be of immediate relevance to DRC 
and its partners. They are: 
 To reduce artificial barriers between the humanitarian/relief and the development communities of 
practice. While many locations remain recipients of humanitarian assistance, the transfer of 
services from emergency provision to more sustainable management remains problematic. 
 To avoid making a false dichotomy between short-term, quick-impact interventions (from 
emergency health services to road repairs) and sustainable long-term interventions in 
infrastructure, agriculture, or energy. Both types are needed. 
 To adjust implementation arrangements to a realistic assessment of capacity.  

E. CAS Instruments 

170. 
Over the past years, the portfolio has improved. It includes 15 projects and 2 regional 
projects for a total commitment of US$3.1 billion, of which US$1.14 billion goes to regional projects. 
Infrastructure accounts for 64 percent of the project portfolio, followed by the social sectors (18 percent), 
agriculture and private sector development (11 percent), and governance (7 percent). The portfolio has no 
problem project. However, great attention needs to be paid to the large share of potential problem 
projects, and all efforts should be geared to maintaining the current 100 percent proactivity rating. 
Appendix 5 provides a detailed picture of the ongoing project portfolio. The portfolio is complemented by 
a number of existing AAA (appendix 6) and Trust Fund activities (appendix 7). 

31 These donors include AfDB, DfID, French Cooperation, German Cooperation, UNDP, and World Bank. 

44 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                           
171. 
The DRC portfolio has made great progress toward increasing its disbursement levels 
beyond the target set for the Africa Region. In FY2012, the DRC portfolio disbursement reached the 
27 percent target––2 percentage points above the target set by the institution. Significant efforts have been 
made to increase disbursements, and the overall trend is higher than in previous fiscal years. Several 
factors have contributed to this performance including close follow-up with counterparts, regular 
performance review meetings, and a large number of tasks managed by decentralized staff. In low-
capacity environments, the standard Bank model of supervision cannot be expected to function 
successfully, so Bank teams must be prepared to operate on a more supportive, even hand-holding, basis. 
The Bank also must be prepared for higher supervision budgets to finance longer periods in the field 
working directly with Government counterparts. Similarly, the Bank should anticipate higher overhead 
and administrative costs within project budgets to ensure that Government units have the capacity to 
ensure smooth project implementation. Finally, to be closer to beneficiaries and to sustain the day-to-day 
dialogue with national counterparts, key IPs, and the entire spectrum of stakeholders, the Bank may need 
to address the limitations posed by being located exclusively in Kinshasa.  

172. 
The portfolio will be consolidated. Limited IDA resources need to be allocated strategically 
to maximize development outcomes in key areas. Areas of interventions will be better focused to ensure 
greater impact. Consolidation will take account of the Bank’s comparative advantage in sectors important 
to unlocking growth while maximizing employment creation. Project teams will be encouraged to 
consider additional financing and restructuring, especially in sectors in which scaling up is necessary or in 
which a different approach may be needed based on the evolving dialogue with the Government. Such 
circumstances most certainly will require making tougher strategic choices in consultation with the 
Government. All new Bank-financed operations included in this CAS will be implemented by 
Government’s institutions. No new project implementation units will be created, and existing PIUs will 
be phased out at the end of their respective programs. 

173. 
Given the fluid political and security conditions of different parts of the country, the 
Bank should be in the position to differentiate its operational procedures as it sees fit. Flexibility––
using multiple and differentiated approaches according to situations––will be a key feature of Bank 
interventions, The Bank should be able to use appropriate arrangements according to options provided by 
OP8.0. Options include the use of additional financing and project restructuring; use of a third-party agent 
or agents to augment and strengthen––but not substitute for––project supervision; use of mobile-phone-
based technologies to get insights into implementation of projects and to ensure direct feedback from 
beneficiaries in remote areas; and relying on partnerships, especially with UN agencies, NGOs, and 
community groups. The World Bank’s Centre for Conflict, Security and Development in Nairobi is hiring 
clearance-level fiduciary staff in procurement, financial management (FM), and safeguards. The center is 
incorporating these staff when needed into regular supervisory missions. Their participation can help 
elevate and resolve implementation issues sooner rather than later. 

Proposed new activities 
174. 
Analytical and Advisory Activities. In partnership with Government and donors, the Bank will 
undertake core AAA diagnostics; AAA related to CAS objectives; and just -in-time policy notes as 
needed. In undertaking AAA, the Bank will emphasize Government ownership to ensure that findings are 
internalized and translated into actions and results. Most of the AAA will be developed with local 
institutions including NGOs and think tanks, and dissemination will be an important part of the 
knowledge work. Appendix 3 provides a tentative AAA pipeline. 

175. 
World Bank financing. Under the 4-year CAS, the World Bank will finance approximately 12 
new projects and use 3 additional financings to scale up successful interventions. The Bank will finance 
an additional two regional investment operations that involve DRC. Appendix 4 provides a detailed list of 
pipeline projects. Development policy operations should be considered as part of the menu of instruments 

45 

 
 
 
 
 
 
that could be used to address critical reforms. The massive work on PFM reforms that the Bank will 
support during this CAS period should help create the conditions for the use of this important instrument.  

V. 

RISKS AND MITIGATION 

176. 
As was the case with the preceding Country Assistance Strategy, this CAS will be 
implemented under highly challenging conditions. Some of the main risks are (i) political and security-
related and the conflict in the East; (ii) system-wide shocks associated with the external environment due 
to the volatility of demand for minerals, high oil and food prices, and the persistence of the euro crisis; 
(iii) poor fiscal space, deteriorating fiscal position, and their macroeconomic impacts; (iv) opposition to 
reforms and transparency by deeply entrenched vested interests; (v) corruption; (vi) tensions arising from 
unmet expectations in improved living conditions in the face of a dynamic youth bulge and the unfinished 
decentralization agenda; (vii) low capacity for program implementation; and (viii) lack of engagement by 
civil society and unmet high expectations regarding access to information and demand for good 
governance. 

177. 
Political and security-related risks. Recently, the security situation in North Kivu has 
deteriorated considerably. If the Government proves unable to control the rebellion, the former’s survival 
may be at risk. In such a case, delivering the proposed program would be extremely difficult. The UN 
reports that the chances that the rebellion continues to prosper in Eastern DRC are real, considering the 
inability of the armed forces to dislodge it and the lukewarm reaction of the neighboring countries to limit 
their support. The conflict will last, and resources will be diverted to military expenditures so will not 
serve development purposes. This situation is unlikely to affect Bank-financed programs in the rest of the 
country but will make critical national reforms difficult to implement. In the end, continuous fighting in 
the East will undermine the Government’s ability to deliver, so will weaken it and could lead to its 
dismissal. However, the recent signing of the Framework peace agreement offers additional conditions for 
the restoration of peace but peace will not automatically happen of the signing of another peace accord. 
The present Government is the most committed to reforms since the re-establishment of a democratic 
process in 2006. If this Government does not make consistent progress in economic governance and 
deliver basic services to sizable parts of the population, Bank assistance would not be effective and could 
be considerably reduced. The Bank will focus its intervention on the most critical programs that are 
associated with service delivery and social protection. 

178. 
Shocks associated with the external environment, including poor fiscal space . DRC 
remains vulnerable to the reverberations of the European financial crisis. Exports of mining products 
represent some 63 percent of GDP in DRC, making the economy vulnerable to natural resource prices on 
international markets. In absence of access to international financial markets, a fall in mining prices 
would constrain funding for imports or quickly exhaust accumulated foreign exchange reserves as 
experience in early 2009. A sharp contracting in import would have devastating effects on living 
standards in DRC in particularly in urban centers such as Kinshasa which are dependent on food 
imports. Reduced demand for 
the commodities exported by DRC would negatively 
impact 
macroeconomic management and public finances. However, to date, DRC has demonstrated its capacity 
to weather the global financial crisis. As it has increased its capacity to adjust production, its economic 
system is becoming more resilient to external shocks. The recent introduction of the VAT has 
strengthened the resilience of DRC’s revenue mobilization. Non-concessional borrowing, as was done 
under a 2008 scheme, remains a potential source of risk and would have to be effectively managed to 
avoid seriously undermining DRC’s fiscal position. The Bank may require access to the Crisis Response 
Window and prepare an emergency support operation to provide funding that will help sustain financing 
by the Government of social sectors and critical imports.  

46 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
179. 
180. 
Opposition to reform from entrenched vested interests. The present Government is well 
aware of resistance to change, including at different levels of the state. Nevertheless, this Government is 
committed to reform the public sector, including public enterprises, and to improve the business climate. 
Delivering on its commitment as rapidly as possible remains a critical step toward neutralizing 
opposition, building confidence with citizens, and generating a momentum for reforms. It is important for 
the Bank and the donor community to be highly supportive of those in DRC who are keen to embrace and 
implement reforms and to carefully monitor early successes and build on them. In the coming months, if, 
despite the crisis in the East, the Government is able to take highly relevant actions demonstrating its 
commitment to increased transparency and better governance, these actions would sustain the momentum 
for reforms that, over time, will undermine the resistance of vested interests. The Bank will promote 
broad support for, and ownership of, programs both at the national and provincial levels so that success 
becomes less dependent on individuals and the Bank will beef up its staffing capacity to respond to the 
situation. 

181. 
Corruption. Critical risks include persistence of poor governance in critical areas (mining, 
public expenditure management), misuse of Government’s budget resources and misuse of resources 
under donor-financed projects. Based on previous experiences, project oversight has been strengthened, 
with more frequent oversight and implementation support missions, and a heightened dialogue and focus 
on good governance, including through the economic governance matrix. The Bank will take early 
measures as risks emerge, to ensure that resources are not misused.  

182. 
Tensions due to unmet expectations in improving living conditions and in decentralizing. 
As indicated above, the effective decentralization of fiscal and human resources is lagging behind stated 
intentions. In several provinces, the Bank has been active in promoting participation of local staff in the 
preparation of programs. Past efforts are expected to be amplified during the CAS period. It is important 
for the Bank to use its convening power to help national and provincial actors reach agreements on how to 
share limited resources as effectively as possible. The Bank will continue to strengthen capacity including 
core fiduciary functions of the central and decentralized governments. Promoting the accountability of 
provincial and local governments should continue in order to support the country’s stability and increased 
and better service delivery. The Bank will strengthen its staffing capacity to support the provinces and 
assist in the policy dialogue on decentralization.  

183. 
Low capacity for program implementation. Restoring strong public service with high-
quality and well-paid staff remains a daunting challenge. It is critical to design and implement a realistic 
program to rebuild capacity in state institutions at the Central and provincial levels. The Government has 
launched the preparation of a public sector reform and rejuvenation program aiming to hire talented and 
motivated junior staff. Staffing capacity will be reinforced, and the country team will build on support 
from the Nairobi Hub and other expertise within the Africa Region.  

184. 
Low civil society engagement. Civil society consistently has demonstrated its interest in 
participating in programs designed to improve the living conditions of the population. Too often, civil 
society has been prevented from being too assertive, as doing so would threaten powerful rent -seeking 
groups. It is important for the Bank to ensure the broad and active participation of potential beneficiaries 
in the preparation and implementation of projects. The use of the Global Facility for Social 
Accountability (GFSA) will support Bank efforts in this direction, and the Bank will support a concerted 
effort to strengthen the capacity of CSOs. The Bank will strengthen its staffing profile to respond to the 
needs. 

47 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
185. 
Additional risk analysis and lower case scenario. In response to the volatility of the 
environment and to maximize the Bank’s responsiveness to significant shocks, the CMU will launch a 
holistic country and operational risk analysis, culminating in the formulation of a flexible/viable 
alternative engagement scenario. The current CAS presumes a positive progression toward improved 
country conditions and the active engagement of national counterparts. Thus, the country team’s focus 
will be directed at harnessing these positive factors toward attaining the CAS’s development objectives. 
The risk analysis and formulation of a lower case scenario will help the Bank internalize the potential 
impact of shocks (escalation/expansion of conflict, political shocks, natural catastrophes, program or lack 
of program with the IMF, other). These actions will facilitate the design of the fundamental elements of a 
response around the type of projects to be frozen or scaled up and how the team should organize to 
deliver in such conditions. The mid-term review will help the Bank adjust its interventions.

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO 

FY08-FY11 

I. 

INTRODUCTION 

1. 
This report assesses the performance of the FY08-FY11 Country Assistance Strategy for the 
Democratic Republic of Congo which was discussed at the Board on December 18, 2007.  It 
describes the support provided through an integrated package of financial, knowledge, and coordination 
services, evaluates the strategy’s outcomes and the Bank’s performance, and draws lessons for the new 
FY13-FY16 CAS currently under preparation. The May 26, 2010 CAS Progress Report slightly adjusted 
the original CAS program and strengthened the CAS results matrix. This completion report uses the 
updated results matrix as the reference for assessing the CAS program’s performance. 

A. DRC’s Economic and Social Context at Inception of the FY08-FY11 CAS 

2. 
At the time of developing the FY08-FY11 CAS, DRC was still reeling from years of 
economic mismanagement and from the effects of a protracted civil war, with several parts of the 
country – especially in the east – still under active armed conflict.  After many years of neglect, very few 
roads were passable, and schools and health facilities had fallen into disrepair, and HIV/AIDS epidemic 
remained uncontained. Although still very fragile, the economy was already beginning to stabilize by 
2007.  Indeed, inflation was down to 10 percent at end 2007, from 18 percent at end 2006, and annual 
GDP growth was averaging 6 percent. However, the country remained saddled with massive external 
debt.  Debt service on public and publicly guaranteed (PPG) external debt amounted to 26 percent of 
exports at end 2006, while the net present value of PPG external debt exceeded 300 percent of exports, 90 
percent of GDP, and 700 percent of government revenue. This was clearly unsustainable, making 
reaching HIPC completion point and stimulating economic growth of utmost urgency. 

3. 
In view of the above, the newly elected Government, which was formed in March 2007, 
launched a social and economic rehabilitation program organized around five themes: (a) promotion 
of peace and good governance; (b) consolidation of macroeconomic stability and promotion of economic 
growth; (c) improvement in access to social services; (d) prevention of HIV/AIDS; and (e) promotion of 
community dynamics. It is against this background that the World Bank, in collaboration with other 
partners under the Country Assistance Framework (CAF), elaborated the FY08-FY11 CAS.   

B. World Bank’s Program Support 

4. 
Picking up from the Government’s own strategy and the CAF, the CAS was organized 
around five themes: (i) promoting good governance and consolidating peace through strengthened 
institutions; (ii) consolidating macro-economic stability and growth; (iii) improving access to social 
services and reducing vulnerability; (iv) combating HIV/AIDS; and (v) promoting local initiatives. The 
strategy was slightly adjusted at mid-term in order to respond to (a) the large macroeconomic imbalances 
resulting from the impact of the global financial crisis on the DRC economy; (b) the findings of analytical 
work undertaken during the CAS period; (c) the outcomes of the aid coordination conference (the 
Kinshasa Agenda) of June 2009, which set the stage for enhanced donor coordination; and (d) lessons 
learned in implementing the CAS, including the need to address the persistent weakness in Government 
capacity.  

62 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5. 
Specifically, activities were added to the program to protect critical imports and expedite 
economic recovery, respond to the malaria epidemic, contain a polio outbreak, consolidate the roads 
rehabilitation program, strengthen core public sector capacity, rejuvenate the aging public service, 
mainstream governance, support climate change adaptation and mitigation, and promote regional 
integration through trade facilitation. 

6. 
In order to further sharpen the focus of the Bank’s support to DRC, the CAS program was 
regrouped under three themes: (i) rebuilding state capacity to increase access and improve the quality 
of basic services; (ii) creating conditions for growth and economic diversification; and (iii) providing 
improved access to health and education. 

II. 

CAS PROGRAM PERFORMANCE 

7. 
Overall, the performance of the CAS program is rated moderately satisfactory as the 
program achieved good progress toward all major expected outcomes. More specifically, progress 
was moderately satisfactory regarding the first 2 pillars (rebuilding State capacity to increase access and 
improve the quality of basic services, and creating conditions for growth and economic diversification), 
and satisfactory for the third pillar (providing improved access to education and health). However the 
outcomes achieved (16 out of 30) were significantly more important than those partially (10) or not 
achieved (4). There were particularly notable advances in road development, forestry sector, health and 
education, and some progress in public finance management (PFM) and decentralization. Less progress 
was registered in energy, and public enterprise reform, due to the complexity of issues, weak 
implementation capacity, and in some cases insufficient political commitment. The CAS results matrix is 
shown in Annex 1. This section presents an overview of key principles of engagement that underpinned 
the CAS, followed by a succinct summary of the specific progress made under each of the three strategic 
elements of the CAS. 

A.  Overview of Principles of Engagement 

8. 
The Bank followed three basic principles of engagement in developing its relationship with 
DRC: flexibility, gradual shift from the emergency mode to a sharper sectora l focus, and donor 
coordination. The Bank sought to act flexibly in implementing the CAS.  For instance, during the 2008-
2009 global financial crises, the Bank approved and disbursed, in record time, funding to protect critical 
imports.  Second, there was a deliberate shift away from emergency operations to sustainable 
development through the development of a number of sector strategies (such as in health, education, 
transport, energy, and telecommunication), and a greater focus on the often harder to implement structural 
reforms.  Finally, there were efforts to enhance donor coordination within the CAF, including 
establishing thematic groups and holding an Aid Effectiveness Forum that resulted in a coordination 
framework called the Kinshasa Agenda.  

B.  Progress toward CAS Outcomes, by CAS Pillars as Restated at Mid Term  

B.1. Pillar 1:  Rebuilding State Capacity to Increase Access and Improve the Quality of Basic 
Service 

9. 
Progress under this pillar was moderately satisfactory. Bank support mainly focused on: (i) 
reforming the public administration, especially within the context of decentralization; (ii) strengthening 
public financial management; and (iii) improving access to water and sanitation services in selected urban 
centers.  4 out of the 11 outcome indicators for this pillar (36 percent) have been achieved, 5 (45 percent) 

63 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
partially achieved and 2 (18 percent) not achieved. Regarding the milestones, 9 (56 percent) have been 
achieved, 4 (25 percent) partially achieved and 3 (19 percent) not achieved. 

10. 
Public Administration Reforms and Decentralization. Major progress was achieved in 
supporting the decentralization agenda considering the importance of decentralized governments in the 
management of service delivery in a country as large of two thirds of Europe. Despite the obvious 
resources constraints these entities have to go through, provincial governments have seen their financial 
resources increased manifolds in Katanga, Bandundu, and South Kivu for example. New financial 
management procedures were set up and implemented as well as the approval of new procurement codes 
in South Kivu and Katanga provinces. Resources managed at the provincial level increased to 31.5 
percent of national resources in 2011 compared to 11 percent in 2008. The Bank, jointly w ith the 
European Commission, UNDP, and the Belgian Cooperation, supported several pieces of analytical 
work32 and technical assistance, which were instrumental in the crafting of a package of laws regulating 
the functions of the provincial governments, including the organization of civil service between the 
central and provincial governments, developing a transparent revenue sharing mechanism between the 
central and provincial governments, and assessing the financial feasibility of the proposed territorial 
administration reforms including the decoupage from 11 to 26 provinces as mandated by the Constitution. 
In addition, the reforms entailed putting in place a legal and regulatory framework for human resource 
management and inter-governmental fiscal relations. The process was not easy because of deep political 
economy considerations. The complexity of these reforms, the difficulty in reaching a consensus among 
the various stakeholders, and especially the inadequate political commitment in many cases, resulted in 
limited progress on the finalization of legal frameworks for decentralizations, despite a lot of technical 
background work that was accomplished. However, the Government adopted in 2011 several elements of 
an over-arching framework for civil service reform in order to make it able to support the process of 
decentralization.  

11. 
However there are still a number of pieces of legislation to accompany this process of 
decentralization, which have been in their final draft form for some time, but still await cab inet and 
parliamentary approval.33 

 Rejuvenating the public sector. Good progress has been made in developing and adopting tools 
and practices for a more efficient, and results-oriented administration. A critical dimension of 
public administration reform includes retiring over-age staff (more than two thirds of DRC civil 
servants are past retirement age due to lack of funds to pay their departure indemnities), 
rejuvenating the public service, and hence improving the performance of those who stay or are 
newly recruited. The payment system has been simplified by reducing the number of variables 
from 20 to 3. As a result, 55 percent of civil servants are paid through the payment system in 
2011 compared to 31 percent in 2008. Similarly, preparation is underway for supporting the 
retirement process based on an incremental approach – ministry by ministry. As of to date, the 
Ministry of Environment, Nature conservation and Tourism (MECNT) is one that is most 
advanced with a biometric census completed that has identified all MECNT staff including 
approximately 2,700 workers eligible for retirement, 1,700 of whom received their retirement 
payments in May 2011. Moreover, 2,267 staff of the national railways company (SNCC) that 
have past retirement age have left the company following the payment of their retirement rights 
with funding from the World Bank. This support from the Bank has reduced the operating costs

of SNCC and has improved the prospect for this company to reach financial self -sufficiency in 
the next future. Progress was also made in defining eligible staff and organizing the retirement of 
staff in several ministries (agriculture, budget and finance in particular). The next steps in the 
public sector will be supported by the new project in preparation which will tackle the reform of 
the ministries in charge of finances, budget, planning and portfolio. 

 Public Finance Management.  The objective was to, among other things, to reform budgetary 
processes, to establish a more effective and transparent payroll system for civil servants, and to 
improve government revenues and inter-governmental resource transfers. The PEFA assessment 
carried out between June 2012 and September 2012 showed that about 50 percent of the PEFA 
ratings increased from 2008 to 2012. A new public finance law organizing the management of 
public resources has created the legal framework that will speed the modernization of the public 
financial management systems and increase transparency and accountability in the use of public 
resources. Key aspects of inter-governmental fiscal relations were addressed in this new Public 
Finance Law through the Coordinated PFM reform Assistance Trust Fund. However, central 
government revenue collection and resource transfers to provinces remained below targets.  The 
new provinces revenue law, supported through the Fiscal and Administrative Impact Assessment 
of Administrative Territorial Reform Trust Fund, has been adopted by the Parliament early 
October 2012 and it is expected that provinces revenue collection will increase to reduce their 
dependency from the national budget. Medium term expenditures frameworks were developed for 
the first time for the ministries of Health, Education and Agriculture thanks to Bank support 
(under the Capacity Building in Macro-projections for the MTEF and PRSP Trust Fund) but their 
use in the preparation of the budget has been lagging. PFM and human resource management 
systems have been developed in four provinces (Katanga, South Kivu, Bandundu, and Kasai 
Occidental) which have resulted in marked improvements in the way these provinces are 
managed compared to provinces where no Bank interventions have been in place. More striking 
has been the dramatic increase in internally revenue generation in the provinces of Bandundu and 
Katanga over the last two years thanks to the reforms of the provincial collection revenue 
agencies. These reforms are complemented by the revenue administration reforms at the national 
level where the integrated financial management system of both the customs and tax departments 
are streamlined, import valuation procedures enhanced and the large taxpayers unit strengthened. 
Central Government budget execution data is regularly published though quality remains to be 
improved.  The strengthening of the expenditure chain both at the central and at provincial levels 
has started and this has translated in stronger discipline in the management of resources at the 
provincial level. 

 Procurement. The Bank provided financial and technical assistance for the development of a 
new public procurement law, which was approved in 2010 replacing an obsolete and poorly 
transparent system dating back from 1969. For the first time, a procurement regulatory agency 
was established as well as procurement implementation entities (ARMP and DGCMP) although 
only partially operational since April 2011. At the central level, the procurement units are 
operational in 10 major ministries including the ministries of (i) Interior and Security, (ii) Health, 
(iii) Infrastructure, Public Works and Reconstruction,(iv)Agriculture,(v)Energy, (vi) Primary, 
Secondary and Professional education,(vii)Environment, Nature Conservation and Tourism, 
(viii)Budget. The procurement units are also in place in public institutions such as National 
Assembly and the Supreme Court, and 6 out of 11provinces have already adopted decrees on 
public procurement. In addition, the Dispute Resolution Committee has been established and staff 
appointed and installed by Decree No 12/027 of July 25, 2012. More than 1,500 staff has already 
been trained on the new system. As of to date, all the procurement plans and decisions are 
published on ARMP website (www.armp-rdc.com).An independent firm has been recruited to 

65 

 
 
 
 
review the performance of the new procurement system, and the draft audit report has been 
prepared.  

 Water and Sanitation. The Bank supported the rehabilitation of water facilities under two 
existing emergency operations, including construction of a new unit at the N'Djili water treatment 
facility, adding 160,000 m3 of drinking water per day, and doubling the distribution capacity in 
order to provide water to about 3 million people in Kinshasa. A new operation (Water Sector 
Rehabilitation Project) was approved and is under implementation to further increase access to 
drinking water in some major urban centers of DRC, and to improve the performance of the 
country’s water utility (REGIDESO).  Selection of an international water operator has been 
completed and the operator is about to start its activities which will consist of managing the water 
utility and improving REGIDESO operational and financial performance following decades of 
mismanagement is ongoing.  

B.2. Pillar 2: Creating Conditions for Growth and Economic Diversification 

12. 
Progress under this pillar has been moderately satisfactory. Bank support focused on: (i) 
maintaining macroeconomic stability and improving fiscal management; (ii) rehabilitating targeted 
transport infrastructure; (iii) increasing the availability of electricity to serve domestic demand and for 
export; (iv) undertaking reforms and building capacity for sustainable natural resource management 
(especially forestry and mining); and (iv) improving the business climate, coupled with restructuring and 
reforming public enterprises in line with international standards. Progress has been satisfactory thanks to 
significant headways in economic and fiscal management, and in transportation infrastructure. However, 
little progress was made on the business climate while impressive strides were made in disclosing mining 
contracts despite attempts to derail this process by key and well-connected stakeholders.  The World Bank 
was quite active and the only donor addressing the highly charged reform of public enterprises. Overall, 8 
(53 percent) outcome indicators have been achieved, 5 (33 percent) partially achieved and 2 (13 percent) 
not achieved. As regard to the milestones, 10 (56 percent) have been achieved, 7 (39 percent) partially 
achieved and 1 (6 percent) not achieved. 

 Macroeconomic Stabilization and Fiscal Management. A major achievement during the CAS 
period was the achievement of DRC at HIPC Completion Point in July 2010 for a debt 
cancellation of US$ 16.3 billion in total of which US12.3 billion after the completion point. 
Following the achievement of the DRC at HIPC completion point, all external debt indicators 
remain below the required thresholds, with the exception of the present value of debt -to-GDP 
ratio (over 30%), as a result of government guarantees for loans contracted under the Sino -
Congolese agreement. The DRC economy, which had grown at an average of 6 percent between 
2001 and 2008, began to weaken with the onset of the global financial crisis, dropping sharply to 
2.8 percent in 2009. There was a sharp deterioration in the country’s terms of trade and a rapid 
depletion of foreign reserves.  Inflation, which had reduced to 10 percent by end 2007, increased 
to 27.6 percent by end 2008, peaking at 53.4 percent by 2009.  Many jobs were lost, especially in 
the artisanal mining sector.  The Bank, together with the IMF and other development partners, 
acted quickly with policy advice and funds to protect critical imports, build foreign reserves, and 
stimulate growth.34  In 2010, with the resumption in mining activity, growth was back up at 7.2 
percent, and average inflation down to 23.2 percent (end of year 9.8 percent). A spike in 
international food and fuel prices early in 2011 boosted inflation but by year end it had declined 
again to 15.4 percent at end-2011, and is estimated to fall to 4.5 percent at end-2012.  

34

The Bank’s support of $100 million, provided in February 2009, was the first op eration in the Africa Region under the Fast 
Track Facility.   

66 

 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                           
 
 Transport. Major progress was made in this sector, including the reopening of 1,530 km of roads 
in Province Orientale, South Kivu and Katanga. Of the 15,800 km of high-priority road networks, 
36.1 percent are now classified as in good or fair condition, compared to 13.8 percent in 2009. 
The Bank and DFID contributed the bulk of the financing for these roads’ reopening. The 
economic impact of the rehabilitated sections was significant, reducing transportation costs by as 
much as 80 percent in some cases and cutting travel time by more than half. For instance, in two 
isolated areas in Katanga province, travel time was reduced from 60 hours to 3 hours to cross 110 
km. The Bank, through ProRoutes project, contributed to the bulk of the financing of this road 
with support from DFID. The Study on “Prioritizing infrastructure investments: a spatial 
approach” carried out in 2009, and financed by a Trade Facilitation and Corridor Diagnostic Trust 
Fund, helped identify the priority corridors with high potential impact including the road 
networks. In addition, the Bank supported the restructuring of the National Railway and the 
improvement of governance in other transport state-owned enterprises. This recently included the 
provision of finance for a comprehensive railway rehabilitation program, as well as selective 
modernization of the other transport SOEs.   

 Energy. Significant progress has been made on the institutional front, including strengthening of 
governance within the National Electricity Company (SNEL), as demonstrated by the 
appointment of a new Board and Senior Management, the signing of the performance contract 
between SNEL and the State and progress in the recruitment of the technical assistance service 
operators supported by the Bank. Progress has also been made in the overall support to SNEL 
performance, as measured by a 30 percent increase in revenue collected per kWh from 2007 to 
2011, and an increase of 20 percent of total collection rate within the same period. However less 
progress has been made on the rehabilitation side. Works on four Inga units are still underway, 
and the delivery of the first Inga unit (G12) will now happen only in 2013. The rehabilitation and 
reinforcement of the high voltage transmission line corridor from Inga to Kasumbalesa at the 
border with Zambia is also ongoing. Under the SAPMP, 95 km of new transmission line have 
been built and contracts for the remaining lines have been signed. The delay in starting the 
rehabilitation of Inga units was mostly due to difficulties to attract qualified contractors in the 
post conflict environment of DRC, and difficulties for studies and bidding documents to properly 
define the scope of the required rehabilitation works leading to non- conclusive bidding process 
for many contracts. 

 Forestry. Bank support played an important role in the legal review of the 156 logging contracts 
by an inter-ministerial commission, which was successfully completed in early 2009. The Bank 
helped to consolidate these gains by helping carry out institutional reforms a t the ministry in 
charge of forestry aimed at strengthening its oversight capacity. This included facilitating the 
retirement of some 1,700 past-retirement staff, creating room for more suitably adapted new 
hires. Bank support is facilitating the negotiation between forest concessionaires and local 
communities and indigenous peoples on social responsibility contracts.35  Bank funding has 
enabled the Government to deploy a new timber control system in Western DRC in May 2012 
and over 100,000 m3 of illegal wood have been identified and seized since then. The control 
system is generating a considerable increase in tax receipts and it is set up to be self -financing. 
The Bank is also supporting the rehabilitation of the protected areas around the Virunga National 
Park, including a program of community development and conservation activities. Bank support 
was also instrumental in helping the country to play an important role in the Copenhagen climate 
change negotiations, where it advocated for the creation of a Reduced Emissions from 

35 Some 41 such contracts have already been signed, setting the stage for forest industries to make significant contributions to 
social infrastructure (schools, medical facilities) in the remote areas where the concessionaires are operating.

Deforestation and Degradation in Developing Countries (REDD) mechanism. Forest Carbon 
Partnership Facility (FCPF) and UN-REDD (FAO, UNDP, UNEP) are jointly supporting the 
country in REDD Readiness. The coordination of these two REDD programs in DRC is regarded 
as a model for other countries engaged in REDD, as well as for donor harmonization. DRC is 
preparing its REDD+ strategy, is in the process of finalizing the preparation of its investment 
program thanks to the Forest Investment Program (FIP) and is ready to request funding for 
emission reduction. 

 Mining Sector. Significant progress was made in this sector. In 2008, the Bank carried a series of 
analytical works to: (i) examine the mining sector’s potential to contribution to economic growth 
and (ii) propose measures to strengthen institutions and good governance in the mining sector. 
Key reforms are supported under the growth with governance in mining sector project. Following 
reports of non-transparent handling of mining concessions in the spring and summer of 2010, the 
Bank agreed with Government on economic governance measures aimed at improving 
transparency in the extractive industries. According to the information available to date, 100 
percent of the existing petroleum contracts and 134 out of the 135 existing mining contracts have 
been published. In addition, The Bank supported mining sector project will help strengthen the 
capacity of key institutions to manage the minerals sector, improve the conditions for increased 
investments in and revenues from mining, and help increase the socio-economic benefits from 
artisanal and industrial mining in mining areas.  

 DRC was accepted as an EITI Candidate Country at the EITI board meeting in Accra in 
February 2008, and produced its first mining revenues reconciliation report in December 2009, 
and is at an advanced stage for validation. In April 2010, on the basis of the progress to date, the 
country was granted by the EITI Board a 6-months extension period to be able to reach full 
validation. Because of the scope of the mining sector in DRC, it was difficult for the country to 
meet the requirements in the first place. A new deadline of March 1, 2013 was set by the EITI 
secretariat to achieve the EITI Compliant status, and efforts are made by Government with the 
Bank support to achieve this target. Finally, decision regarding validation will take place in May 
2013 at the EITI board meeting in Australia. 

 Private Sector Development. Significant progress has been achieved under the Bank’s support to 
private sector development.  World Bank support was focused on laying the foundations for an 
improved business climate, including: (i) reducing the time for creating business (down by 51 
percent over the CAS period); (ii) reducing the time for securing Property Registry and 
Construction Permits (down by 54 percent), although the number of procedures remains 
unchanged and high; (iii) instituting a one-stop-shop for customs administration; (iv) reducing the 
number of taxes (from 118 to 30); (v) preparing DRC for adhesion to the harmonized regional 
business laws commonly known as OHADA (which are now effective as of September 2012 after 
DRC’s adhesion as a member country)36; and (vi) facilitating DRC participation in the African 
Trade Insurance system (with DRC currently constituting ATI’s largest portfolio). Regarding 
OHADA, the adhesion of DRC to OHADA brings modern legislation, which, albeit imperfect 
and in need of further reform, raises DRC judicial standards to at least on par with many of its 
trading partners in the region, as well as institutes supranational oversight of DRC commercial 
justice framework that opens more channels for transparency, equity and efficiency in 
enforcement of court decisions. On the financial sector, the action plan for modernizing the 

36

OHADA is a system of business laws and implementing institutions adopted by sixteen West and Central African nations. 
OHADA is the French acronym for "Organisation pour l'Harmonisation en Afrique du Droit des Affaires", which translates into 
English as "Organization for the Harmonization of Business Law in Africa". It was created on October 17, 1993 in Port Louis, 
Mauritius. 

68 

 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                           
banking sector payment system was developed, and the implementation process has been 
initiated. Although setting up the Microfinance Promotion Fund has been slow, which is now 
fully funded by IDA contribution, it is now supporting this fast growing sector as evidenced by 
the growth from 100,000 clients in 2007 to the current 700,000 clients compared to a target of 
300,000 clients. The Bank also supported Government in drawing up legal instruments for 
adhering to the New York Convention of 1958 on International Arbitration. They have been 
approved by cabinet, and are awaiting Parliamentary approval.  While a lot of progress has been 
made, DRC still has a challenging business environment, and more work lies ahead. In addition, 
overall competitiveness is still hampered by the unfinished rehabilitation of the state-owned 
enterprises, which play a dominant role in DRC’s economy. Developing their restructuring 
strategies was slow because of the complexity of the reforms and lack of a political consensus, 
but has been restated with vigor by the new Government in place with the signing the decree 
clarifying how social debts will be addressed. This is a major step that will help complete the 
restructuring process and support the positive contribution of these enterprises to the economy 
following the transformation of the status as commercial entities of 20 more public enterprises. 

B.3. Pillar 3: Providing Improved Access to Education and Health 

13. 
Progress under this pillar was satisfactory and all targeted indicators achieved and even 
surpassed. The Bank mainly focused on improving access to basic primary education and increasing 
access to a well-defined package of quality essential health services in target areas.  While still off track 
to reach the Millennium Goals, the country has made some progress in improving education and health 
outcomes, compared to conditions during the conflict, and the Bank has contributed significantly to these 
results. Health and education services have been delivered in very remote areas of DRC where no partners 
or services were available for decades. Programs in landlocked districts with no road access have been in 
place and made a difference in districts such as the Mongala and Tshuapa districts of the Equateur 
province and as result, supporting the decentralization process in such a large country. Under this pillar, 
all the 4 outcome indicators have been achieved. Regarding the milestones, 4 (67 percent) have been 
achieved and 2 (33 percent) partially achieved.  

 Education. Significant results have been achieved including: (i) 396 schools were constructed as 
part of the Emergency Social Actions Fund project and 522 classrooms as part of the Education 
project and construction and rehabilitation of facilities was over the target; (i i) gross enrollment 
rates of primary education increased from 64 percent in 2007 to 93 percent in 2011 compared to 
the expected 72 percent; and (iii) a total of 43,355 teachers were integrated to the public payroll 
compared to a target of 30,000 teachers; (iv) completion rate increased from 29 percent in 2007 to 
59 percent in 2011 compared to a target of 34 percent. In order to improve learning outcomes and 
improve the quality of education services about 14 million books and teacher guides were 
purchased and distributed to public and private primary schools and teachers' in-service training 
were provided.  In fact, 125,208 teachers benefited from teacher guides compared to a target of 
125,000 teachers. In partnership with other sector donors, the Bank assisted the Government in 
developing its basic education strategy which was adopted in March 2010.  In order to have an 
integrated strategy covering the whole sector by 2013, the Bank has been instrumental in 
providing support to the Government in the development of a strategy for higher education, and 
for non-formal education and literacy. Bank support has also contributed to a progressive 
development of the sector, including an improved access and equity to basic education, 
strengthening of the learning environment and more effective management of the system.  While 
the quality of education remains a key issue, student learning assessment surveys point to 
significant progress in comparison to other countries in the region. 

69 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Health. A lot of progress has been achieved in DRC despite the challenging conditions. The 
Bank’s support focused on providing essential health services and infrastructure rehabilitation in 
selected health zones. These interventions were successful in the targeted districts. For example, 
the percentage of children of 0-11 months vaccinated with DTP3 has increased from 54 percent in 
2007 to 83 percent in 2011, and deliveries assisted by qualified personnel went from 47 percent in 
2007 to 77 percent in 2011 compared to the target of 65 percent in the same year, thanks to 
PARSS project and an Immunization and Vaccination Program. Distribution of treated bed-nets 
to more than 1 million households has increased the number of children in the Kinshasa area 
protected against malaria from 32 percent to 62 percent. More than 2.8 million bed-nets have 
been distributed in the Kwango and Kwilu districts of the Bandudu province by the multi sector 
PURUS project and 12 million bed-nets have been distributed by the PARSS through a 
combination of routine distribution and mass campaigns. Moreover, the target of constructing 86 
health centers was met and in addition, 808 health facilities were constructed/renovated and 
equipped. The broad issue of rehabilitating and adequately supplying and maintaining the health 
sector remains a daunting challenge, requiring massive resources . DRC’s health sector continues 
to be characterized by poor funding, lack of qualified personnel, inadequate essential medicines, 
dilapidated infrastructure, and overall poor service delivery. Government needs to mobilize more 
resources to the social sector to allow the Bank and other development partners to gradually shift 
from directly supporting health service delivery to systems strengthening. A better harmonization 
and complementarity of donor support is also crucial for this sector. 

III. WORLD BANK GROUP PERFORMANCE 

14. 
The World Bank’s performance is rated satisfactory. The CAS was relevant, aligned with the 
Government PRSP, well-coordinated with other development partners (both through the CAF and the 
Kinshasa Agenda), and its design and implementation allowed for focus, and timely adaptation to 
changing circumstances and priorities. 

A.  CAS Design 

15. 
The CAS was fully in line with the Government’s PRSP .  It’s anchoring in the Country 
Assistance Framework (a collection of 17 donors in DRC) was the right approach as it greatly facilitated 
donor harmonization, and synergy.  The CAS’s flexibility allowed addressing the: (i) global financial 
crisis with speed to contain its contagion effect on the Congolese economy with the US$100 million 
Mitigating the Impact of the Financial crisis ; (ii) malaria epidemic and polio outbreak with two 
Additional financing of US$110 million to the Health project; (iii) economic governance issues through 
an Economic governance matrix addressing the issues of transparency and accountability in the extractive 
industries, public finances management and the business climate  when these became paramount 
concerns, especially by mid-2010. 

B.  Implementing the Strategy 

16. 
The Bank made considerable efforts to enhance the overall quality the portfolio, especially 
by laying a strong emphasis on the reduction of problem projects and a considerable increase of the 
disbursement ratio. The number of problem projects was reduced during the CAS period from 3 projects 
at end-2010 to 2 at end-2011. There is currently no problem project in the portfolio since the long-
standing agriculture and water projects had been upgraded in 2012. It is currently stable with 3 problem 
projects. Thanks to the recent upgrade of two long-term moderately unsatisfactory projects, precisely in 
the water and agriculture sectors, the proactivity rate has also improved from 50 percent in 2011 to 60 
percent in 2012 and it is now at 100 percent. In terms of disbursemen ts, DRC is now one of the top 

70 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
performing large portfolios of the regions: from a disbursement rate of 19.5 percent in FY08 -10, the 
country surpassed the region's disbursement target of 25 percent by reaching 27.4 percent in FY12. This 
was achieved through: (a) intensified dialogue with the Government during the annual Country Portfolio 
Performance Reviews, and following up with monthly meetings with government project coordinators to 
resolve any impediments to implementation; (b) increased staff presence in the field from around 45 
members in 2009 to 64 member in 2012 (including consultants and temporaries); (c) adoption of e-
signature disbursement arrangements for most of the projects; and (d) a drive for timely effectiveness of 
new operations. 

17. 
As indicated above, the Bank significantly strengthened its presence on the ground, greatly 
enhancing dialogue and project implementation. The Country Director relocated to Kinshasa in 2008, 
and in the course of 2009-2011, about 15 international staff relocated to Kinshasa as well, including a 
Lead Operations Officer and Sector Leaders for sustainable development and human development. 
Currently, 10 out of 16 active projects are managed from DRC and neighboring countries. 

18. 
The Bank also intensified its donor coordination efforts.  Official development assistance to 
DRC (from a large number of development partners) remains high, financing some 35 percent of 
government spending. IDA’s engagement with other development partners was strengthened substantially 
during the elaboration of the 2007-2010 multi-donors CAF in 2007, from which the CAS was derived.  
During the entire CAS period, the Bank continued to play a leading role in improving donor coordination 
and harmonization, including helping organize the Aid Effectiveness Forum in June 2009 that resulted in 
a coordination framework called the Kinshasa Agenda and a number of thematic groups, three of which 
(governance, industry, and mining) are co-led by the Bank.  The Kinshasa Agenda calls for better division 
of labor among donors and use of harmonized implementation mechanisms (in the absence of use of 
national systems). The Bank has taken the lead in developing joint mechanisms for project 
implementation to help reduce the cost of doing business and avoid overtaxing already weak government 
capacity37. In addition, the Bank, in coordination with other donors, will continue to move from stand -
alone project units towards sector implementation units integrated in the line ministries. 

Partnership with IFC and MIGA 

19. 
The Bank worked very collaboratively with IFC and MIGA to ensure synergy while 
capitalizing on each institution’s comparative advantage and mandate. 

 

IFC.  IFC’s activities in DRC included investment operations and advisory services, especially in 
facilitating access to finance.  In 2009, IFC provided a US$7 million line of credit to local bank 
(Rawbank), accompanied by a US$1.2 million technical assistance to help Rawbank develop 
products and services targeting small and medium enterprises and women-owned businesses. A 
venture capital fund was created to provide risk capital of up to US$500,000 to start -up 
companies. IFC’s Africa Leasing Facility is working in partnership with the Central Bank and the 
Ministry of Finance to develop leasing activities. A partnership has been finalized with the pan-
African leasing group Alios Finance to create the first leasing company in DRC.  IFC is 
collaborating with the World Bank is setting up a Special Economic Zone near Kinshasa through 
the new Growth Poles project which is currently under preparation. The main challenge for IFC’s 
program in DRC was the Government’s cancellation in 2009 of the mining contract regarding the 
Kingamyambo Musonoi Tailings (KMT) mining project, in which IFC had an ownership stake. 
The case got resolved in February 2012.  

37An illustrative case is the joint implementation unit for energy sector programs funded by the Bank, AfDB, and 
the European Investment Bank (EIB).

 MIGA.  MIGA’s exposure over the CAS period was US$41.9 million for five projects. In the 
period under review, MIGA supported two investment projects in DRC – (a) US$25.1 million in 
Political Risk Insurance to Congo Equipment Company; and (b) a US$4.3 million guarantee for 
Congo Oil and Derivatives Company.  MIGA is exploring opportunities in energy generation 
projects, telecoms, and agribusiness. 

C.  Managing the Risks 

20. 
Some of the risks that had been identified in the CAS included risks related to the fragile 
political and security situation, the limited capacity to manage macroeconomic shocks, the slow 
implementation of economic and governance reforms, a poorly managed decentralization process, 
corruption, lack of donor coordination, and poor operational performance. Generally, the CAS 
managed well the risks that arose during its implementation, although some impacted the implementation 
pace of the Bank funded portfolio. For instance, the slow pace of decision making significantly reduced 
the speed at which reforms of the public administration and state-owned enterprises were conducted. The 
Bank closely monitored these risks, and where possible, took proactive measures for their mitigation.  For 
example, the Bank and IMF acted quickly to contain the impact of the global financial crisis of 2008. 

21. 
The risks related to the security situation didn’t materialize during the CAS 
implementation period but fighting in North Kivu broke up in April 2012 fueling a humanitarian 
crisis in this part of the country. The new CAS will address some of the underlying causes of the 
conflict and will support social cohesion among the communities and access to economic opportunities. 
In addition, the political transition following the 2011 presidential and legislative elections was much 
smoother than foreseen with a continuity of programs and an excellent relationship with the new 
authorities.  

22. 
Deterioration in economic governance, in particular in the extractive industries prompted 
the adoption of a matrix of measures to reinforce economic governance, including improved guarantees 
in relation to contract sanctity and measures to enhance transparency and competitive principles in 
contract and concession awards. Close monitoring of the matrix has been organized and updates have 
been provided to the Board on a regular basis.  

IV. 

LESSONS LEARNED AND RECOMMENDATIONS 

At the country level 

23. 
Scope of the strategy. In a country such as DRC, whose needs are great and whose financial and 
human resources are limited, prioritization and trade-offs are essential. Going forward, more focused 
Bank strategies will require better coordination with donors, while ensuring that coordination inside of the 
institution is maximized. 

24. Working with donors. DRC is country for which 20 donors are providing 90 percent of the 
official development assistance (ODA). Coordinating the strategies of all these donors has been a very 
difficult undertaking that goes beyond organizing regular monthly meetings. There are two key roles for 
the government still to play (i) better aligning donor interventions with the government’s priorities and 
(ii) identifying sectors of concentration or focus for or by each donor. Two areas of urgent concern and 
attention are the education and the health sectors where better coordination will be needed and division of 
labor should be better defined. 

72 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
25. 
Implementing reforms. Reforming state-owned enterprises and public administration, especially 
in fragile contexts, requires time and a deep understanding of the country’s political economy. In DRC, 
20 public companies have become commercial entities through the Bank-financed Private Sector 
Development Project. Taking the next steps, which include addressing the huge debts saddling these 
companies, has been a long process and one that the previous government has been unwilling to address 
decisively. For these companies to become viable entities and for the country to benefit from the reform, 
the challenge is for the government to directly address the SOE corporate governance issues. 

At the operational level 

26. Maintaining Flexibility.  In a post conflict environment, it is important to design and implement 
investment, AAA program and Trust Funds in a flexible manner.  As indicated earlier, the country team 
demonstrated great agility in responding to unanticipated events. Beyond program design, this should 
extend to flexible procurement procedures to accommodate the challenges in such environments. There 
were instances where more flexible application of the rules would have yielded quicker and cheaper 
solutions.38 

27. 
Choice and mix of instruments. Instruments should be packaged to deliver tangible and 
impactful results and not be a wish list of activities to be implemented. The role and importance of 
knowledge should be underscored and the way knowledge is generated also is critical to achieve impact. 
Going forward, it will be critical to (i) leverage more strongly the Bank’s and other donors’ analytical 
work; and (ii) make optimal use of local knowledge to better understand the politica l economy issues and 
be able to support far-reaching reforms that the country needs. For instance, this will require 
strengthening dialogue with other stakeholders including national and provincial think tanks and 
academia; or initiate the review of projects by the beneficiaries. For these steps to succeed, the analytical 
pieces should be limited to a few key strategic areas in which the knowledge gap is the greatest. 

28. 
Addressing risks and managing changing conditions. The previous CAS developed built-in 
arrangements to address changing conditions, and the scope of the strategy was adapted appropriately 
when needed. Mid-term reviews are opportune periods to update strategies, but the approach in DRC 
should remain flexible and take into account changes of the environment. 

29. 
Increasing beneficiary participation. To secure their buy-in, it is essential that beneficiaries be 
proactively and frequently involved during project preparation and implementation. The capacity of civil 
society needs to be strengthened and not taken for granted so that it can better engage with the Bank and 
the authorities during the design, implementation, and monitoring of the government’s projects. More 
broadly, an independent, representative, and dynamic civil society is a prerequisite to any sustained 
demand for good governance. 

30. 
Achieving and reporting results. The World Bank’s credibility lies in the ability of its support 
to the country to deliver impactful, clear, and attributable results for the authorities but, more importantly, 
for the population to recognize. For this reason, clearly identifying in advance the results to be achieved; 
measuring the results; and involving stakeholders in identifying and measuring these results are critical. 
Achieving bolder results that are transformational and identifiable should be an important objective of 
Bank support to DRC; thus, the need to be selective.  

38For example, when a contractor became bankrupt, the Bank objected to Government’s request to negotiate with an 
existing contractor that had been selected competitively to undertake similar work, at competitive rates. Rebidding 
eventually cost an extra nine months and at twice the price of what Government had been able to get under sole 
source     

73 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                           
31. 
Achieving results and disbursements. Results are within reach, even in DRC’s difficult political 
and capacity-constrained environment. Disbursing in a post-conflict country is possible only if doing so is 
coupled with leadership, a proper M&E framework, and accountability. To achieve results, focusing on 
implementation readiness and disbursement arrangements during the preparation of projects is critical. 
Achieving bolder results that are transformational and identifiable should be an important piece of Bank 
support to DRC; thus, the need to be selective. 

32. 
Avoiding overruns and delays in infrastructure projects. Past large infrastructure programs 
(such as the rehabilitation of the power facilities at Inga) have incurred major cost overruns. 
Predetermining costs in a fragile environment has been very difficult, as has obtaining a large number of 
competitive bids. Similarly, bidders attach a high risk premium to operating in DRC, which has been 
difficult for task teams to handle. To avoid disrupting implementation, programs under the new CAS 
should entail more thorough preparation and envisage robust contingencies. 

33. 
Strengthening Safeguard Oversight.  The number of Inspection Panel cases has abated in recent 
years due to more thorough preparation and implementation monitoring of World Bank financed projects.  
The new CAS period should aim at eliminating altogether situations that warrant such investigations. The 
preparation of projects should be done better and more importantly, implementation and supervision 
should pay attention to these issues. The decentralization of staff dealing with safeguards has been 
positive and should help the team. 

34. 

Operating outside Kinshasa. DRC is an immense country with severe infrastructure challenges 
that make it difficult to move around. Air transportation has been the only effective mean to travel outside 
Kinshasa to conduct the supervision of project activities in the field. However given the dreadful security 
and the poor safety record plaguing DRC aviation industry, Staff was advised to fly by international 
companies with connections to Addis Ababa, Nairobi and Johannesburg in order to organize their 
supervision mission in the Eastern part of DRC notably (Kisangani, Lubumbashi, Bukavu, Goma, the last 
two cities requiring an additional transport by road from and to Kigali). The transport arrangements 
increased significantly the cost of projects supervision. Further, several projects suffered from getting in 
contractors who are able to deliver at sub-national level.  Project preparation and monitoring in outlying 
provinces could be enhanced by a fully-equipped field office at a suitable location outside Kinshasa, in 
addition to the Kinshasa office.

the contracts have a long 
implementation period. In addition, 
due to the country’s post conflict

documents could not properly define 
the scope of the required rehabilitation 
works leading to protracted or repeated

2. Achieved. Primary education 
completion rate increased from 29% in 
2007 to 59% in 2011 (2010/11 school 
year data). It is important to note that 
baseline data was probably not entirely

project and 26,000 integrated in 
October 2010 by Government. 

c. Achieved. Although no formal 
assessment has been done, significant 
efforts have been made to reduce 
school fees. From the Bank side, the 
Emergency Urban and Social 
Rehabilitation project financed school 
operating costs in targeted areas and 
the Education project supported the 
integration of primary school teachers 
into the public payroll (as described in 
the indicator above). Government has 
also adopted a fee-free policy in 
primary education, for the first three 
grades. 

d. Achieved.  The Education project 
restructuring supports this indicator. A 
draft teacher career structure (training, 
deployment, salary and incentives) has 
been approved by the Government. 
The final report on the teacher career 
structure has been submitted for 
Government approval. Reformed 
guidelines for pre-service teacher 
training have been developed and 
applied.

e. Education sector strategy 
approved. 

e. Partially Achieved. The strategy for 
primary, secondary education and 
vocational training was adopted by the 
Government in March 2010. The 
strategy for higher education and that 
for non-formal education and adult 
literacy are underway for Government 
adoption.  The development of a global 
strategy for the sector is progressing 
with some difficulty as the task of 
integration of the three sub-sector 
strategies in a rational manner is 
complex.  The selection of a consultant 
to support that work is well advanced.  
It is expected that the work will be 
completed by January 2013.A 
consensus has been made to put 
priority on primary education, and the 
fee-free policy in primary education, 
starting with the first three grades, has 
been under implementation since Sept 
2010.

improvement in project

Use of implementing 
partners (international 
NGOs) contributed to 
ensuring delivery of 
services to the target 
population but further 
effort needs to be made in 
strengthening of local 
health authorities' 
capacity to ensure better 
ownership. 

While the emphasis was 
understandably on the 
provision of basic health 
care, more attention 
should be paid to health 
systems strengthening: 
financing, human 
resources, 
pharmaceuticals, 
regulations/governance 
and Health Information

Appendix 7: Trust Funds Portfolio (as of January 2013) 

The Bank funding envelop for the Democratic Republic of Congo described in Appendix 5 is 
complemented by a Trust Funds (TFs) portfolio amounting to approximately US$30 million in 
net commitments. The portfolio consists of 24 active Trust Funds mostly recipient-executed, with 
an overall disbursement rate of 42 percent as of January 2013.The funds are distributed among six 
major sectors with a large allocation to Forestry and Nature Conservation (45 percent), and 
Governance (19 percent). More specifically, donor contributions were translated in the 
implementation of the National Parks Network Rehabilitation Project and the Forest and Nature 
Conservation Project, which serve as mechanisms to ensure transparency in the forestry sector. 
Additionally, two TFs were set up in order to increase the effectiveness of the state at all levels 
and improve governance, particularly in the mining sector. Major efforts to strengthen the health 
sector are mainly supported by the TF for Capacity Building in Budget Preparation for the Health 
Sector.

Appendix 12: Key findings of the 2012 PEFA Assessment 

Despite recent progress, improving public sector capacity and efficiency is one of the key challenges 
in the DRC. The 2008 and 2012 Public Expenditures and Financial Accountability (PEFA) reviews 
identify a range of weaknesses in DRC’s Public Financial Management system, including critical 
shortcomings in budget preparation and execution processes as well as in internal and external controls. 
These shortcomings are a key impediment to service delivery. The key features of the PFM performance 
system in DRC are follows: 

Planning and budgeting.There is no coherent forward-looking perspective in the budget. Despite the 
development of medium-term expenditures frameworks (MTEF) in key sectors (i.e., health, primary, 
secondary and vocational education, agriculture, rural development and infrastructure), the link between 
sector policies and priorities and the budget is still weak. Major capacity constraints exist in various 
departments. The Directorates of Studies and Planning of line ministries still have difficulties in 
identifying and evaluating investment projects. Moreover, the new budget classification is still not 
operational, nor is it fully understood by all stakeholders. It has not yet been codified into the PFM 
information system. Furthermore, there is no clear plan to establish administrative and financial 
directorates in line ministries, although this is a key requirement of the Public Financial Management Act 
(Loi relative aux Finances Publiques, hereafter LOFIP)41. 

Budget execution. Budget execution is affected mainly by (a) redundant and lengthy steps in budget 
execution processes, including various political interventions in the approval of commitments and 
payments; (b) abuse in the use of the exceptional/emergency procedures; (c) excessive centralization of 
budget execution authority in the Ministry of Economy and Finance and Ministry of Budget; (d) and non -
incorporation of significant budget expenditures, including payroll into the budget management 
information system. 

Accounting, cash management, and reporting. One of the most important challenges in the 
modernization of the DRC PFM systems is the rebuilding of the entire accounting system. Both at the 
institutional and operational levels, accounting and financial reporting are characterized by considerable 
delays. A proposed reorganization of the various directorates in charge of accounting, cash management, 
and financial reporting is being developed. This reorganization includes the creation of a Directorate 
General for Public Accounts and the Treasury and the establishment of a General Regulation on Public 
Accounts. It also consists of the development and implementation of an accrual accounting system as well 
as the creation of a network of public accountants. This is an essential reform that should improve the 
quality and timely production of the accounts and periodic financial reports. However, it requires strong 
collaboration of the Central Bank that plays the de facto accountant general’s role in the PFM system. 

Internal audit. Internal audit falls under the purview of the General Inspectorate of Finance, which has 
overall authority to audit public finances. Recent retirements have reduced significantly the number of 
inspectors. Besides, like many government services, the General Inspectorate of Finance suffers from lack 
of funding for its operating costs. Consequently, the General Inspectorate does not have the capacity to 
perform its mandate adequately and cover key risk areas. 

External audits. The Supreme Audit Institution (Cour des Comptes), which has made significant 
progress over recent years with support from various donors, including the European Commission. As a 
result, the Cour des Comptes has developed its strategic plan and reviewed the Government’s audited 
financial statements from FY2004 to FY2008. However, significant challenges remain within the 
institution, including (a) delays in the approval of its organic law, which reinforces its independence; 

41Law No 11/011 of July 13, 2011.  

117 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                           
(b)delays in judgment of the accounts; (c) lack of follow up of audit recommendations and findings; (d) 
limited human resources capacity; and (e) lack of audit manuals and a risk-based approach. 

Legislative oversight. The Constitution entrusts the Senate and the Parliament with the responsibility of 
financial oversight over government spending. The Parliamentary Oversight Committees, with the 
support of the Law Committee, are in charge of reviewing the draft budget bill and then to audition 
Cabinet and administrative authorities concerning its content. However, the Parliament and Senate have 
not played their oversight role over the last years, except for the review of the annual budget laws . They 
have not yet reviewed the audited financial statements sent by Cour des Comptes and have not taken any 
actions to follow up on these findings and observations. Members of Parliament also are facing serious 
capacity constraints and receive no support that would assist them in actually carrying out their oversight 
function. 

Public sector and PFM systems at the provincial level . Decentralization has been a key tenet of the 
country’s democratic processes since 2006 and was further strengthened by subsequent adoption of 
decentralization laws in 2008. It is broadly perceived as the only long-term option for preserving national 
integrity. With support from a World Bank-funded GCEP, a triumvirate of development partners that 
support public sector management reforms at the subnational level, the Government, and subnational 
authorities agreed in October 2010 on a decentralization framework. This framework agreement 
(plateforme minimale pour les provinces) sets minimum requirements that development partners must 
include in their programs when supporting subnational governments. In addition, each development 
partner was assigned specific provinces with the understanding that the framework agreement will be the 
basis for supporting public sector reforms. While the development of the framework agreement has 
improved the public sector management of the provinces, there remain significant challenges. Despite the 
apparent support of Central Government authorities to the decentralization agenda, fiscal transfers to 
provinces fluctuated between 6 and 15 percent in the period of 2007-2011.In addition, the adjustment 
fund (Caisse de péréquation) is not functioning. Another key challenge is the delay in adoption of laws 
and regulations by the provinces. There also are few checks and balances at the provincial level. Ex post 
controls (General Inspectorate of Finance and Cour des Comptes) are non-existent, and civil society 
oversight is still at its early stages. Provincial assemblies are still not exercising their oversight roles and 
tend to approve all documents submitted by the local authorities. 

Summary of PFM Performance Scores in 2012 and 2008 

As a result of the weaknesses in its PFM system, DRC scored very low in the 2008 PEFA assessment—
22 of 28 indicators that measure PFM performance were rated “D”. In 2012, the PEFA assessment 
shows an improvement in the overall scoring of the performance indicators. Only 17 indicators were 
rated “D” with a majority improving from D to D+. However, the 2012 assessment also highlights the 
continued weaknesses in key pillars of the PFM framework. With four “D” scores, budget credibility 
ranks as the weakest pillar of the overall PFM system. External controls and legislative oversight also are 
areas of concern and where significant improvements are needed despite the clearing of backlog of audit 
reports by Cour des Comptes. One interesting finding is the rating for PI 8, Transparency of inter-
governmental fiscal relations, which slightly improved from “D” in 2008 to “D+” in 2012 despite the 
country’s focus on decentralization. Another notable result is the static rating for donor practices. Like 
2008, the 2012 scores rating donors’ practices remain at “D”, indicating a very low trust in the country’s 
PFM systems by the donor community. During the review period, none of the donors provided direct 
budget support. Financial information about donor-funded operations is partially included in the budget 
documents.
