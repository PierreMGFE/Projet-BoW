EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

i. 
Turkey’s rapid growth and development over the last decade is one of the success stories of 
the global economy. Today, Turkey is an upper middle income country with a population of 75 million 
and a gross domestic product of US$735 billion, making it the 16th largest economy in the world. It is the 
Government’s stated intention that Turkey becomes one of the world’s 10 largest economies by 2023, the 100th 
anniversary of the founding of the Turkish Republic.  Turkey is an EU accession candidate country, a member 
of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and the G20, and an increasingly 
important donor of bilateral Ofﬁ cial Development Assistance (ODA). Turkey is one of the largest middle 
income partners of the World Bank Group (WBG).  

ii. 
Turkey faces signiﬁ cant economic risks going forward, including spillover from the European debt 
crisis.  With low domestic savings, Turkey’s economic growth relies on capital inﬂ ows to ﬁ nance investments 
and growth. The country’s large current account deﬁ cit and the composition of its ﬁ nancing remain critical 
concerns. A weak outlook for global activity and more severe international funding strains have the potential 
to spill over to Turkey.  Turkey’s dependence on external ﬁ nancing has left the country prone to boom-bust 
cycles, and the key challenge going forward is to deliver a soft landing, from the high growth rates in 2010 
and 2011.

iii. 
Other countries, notably in the Middle East and North Africa, are looking to Turkey, with its gains 
in income and social outcomes in recent years, as an interesting development model to emulate.  Per capita 
income almost tripled in less than a decade and now exceeds US$10,000. The Government’s 2023 ‘vision’ 
aims for per capita income to reach US$25,000. Poverty decreased from 28.1 percent in 2003 to 17.1 percent 
in 2008, increasing by 1 percentage point to 18.1 percent in 2009 as a result of the global crisis. It is expected 
to have fallen since then as labor markets, the main channel through which the crisis affected households, 
recovered quickly, with seasonally adjusted unemployment at 9.1 percent and the employment rate at 45.4 
percent in October 2011, improving on pre-crisis levels. Economic growth and social policies are behind these 
achievements. The results of the nation-wide Health Transformation Program launched in 2003, for example, 
include remarkable gains in the health status of the Turkish people, particularly among women.  At the same 
time, regional, gender, and other disparities persist, and inequality remains a challenge.

iv. 
This Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) aims to contribute to Turkey’s goal of fast, sustainable and 
inclusive growth that respects the environment.  Its design reﬂ ects priorities established in Turkey’s own 
development frameworks, notably the Ninth Development Plan 2007- 20131 and the 2012-2014 Medium-Term 
Program (MTP), and is intended to be ﬂ exible to adapt to changes.  The main criterion for WBG support in 
Turkey is its ‘strategic value-added’, through a combination of ﬁ nancing, analysis and advice, implementation 
support to help address development challenges, and the sharing of global experience to provide benchmarks 
and help inform the development and implementation of policies and programs. 

v. 
The CPS has three main strategic objectives and pillars: enhanced competitiveness and employment; 
improved equity and public services; and, deepened sustainable development. In pursuit of these objectives, 
the Turkish government, private sector, civil society and the WBG plan to work together toward ten key 
outcomes during the four-year CPS period, as set out in Figure A.     

1 The Tenth Development Plan starting 2014 is under preparation.

iv

vi. 
Strategic Objective 1: ‘Enhanced Competitiveness and Employment’. Planned CPS activities include: 
(i) support for the adoption and implementation of the National Employment Strategy currently under 
preparation with Development Policy Loan (DPL) ﬁ nancing and analytical and advisory activities (AAA). 
The aim is to enhance productive employment, particularly the activation of low-skilled youth and women 
into formal employment and the expansion of employment activation programs, focused on skills upgrading; 
(ii) support for investment and business environment reforms and the completion of the review of the national 
competition policy framework; and, (iii) provision of medium and long-term funding to Small and Medium 
Enterprises (SMEs) and exporters.

vii. 
Strategic Objective 2: ‘Improved Equity and Public Services’. Planned CPS activities include:  (i) 
increasing ﬁ nancing for early childhood education (ECE); (ii) strengthening the Ministry of Health’s 
stewardship functions (not its role as service provider); (iii) the development and implementation of the 
private sector gender equity certiﬁ cation program; and, (iv) analytic and advisory work on state-owned-
enterprises (SOE) governance.

viii. 
Strategic Objective 3: ‘Deepened Sustainable Development’. Planned CPS activities include: (i) policy 
advice and ﬁ nancing to address energy, environmental and climate change challenges in a more integrated 
manner; (ii) support for the completion of a water basin management strategy; and (iii) analysis, advice, and 
investment ﬁ nancing, by IBRD and IFC, for the Sustainable Cities Program, which is grounded in Turkey’s 
Integrated Urban Development Strategy and Action Plan 2010-2023. 

ix. 
‘Sharing Turkey’s Experience – Results, Knowledge and Capacity’ is a dimension of the CPS that 
cuts across all three objectives.  Turkey and the World Bank are exploring avenues to collaborate in sharing 
Turkey’s successful economic and social reforms. Two areas of particular focus include: health sector policy, 
reform, and performance; and disaster prevention and mitigation. The WBG intends to use its global network 
to work with Turkey in sharing these experiences and successes with a wider international audience. 

v

x. 
While Turkey will remain a large-scale borrower during this CPS period, the role of analytical 
and advisory activities will grow in relative terms. Knowledge services and technical assistance add value 
through the provision of analysis, global experience, and hands-on implementation support. Reﬂ ecting the 
Government’s ongoing demand for analytical and advisory services, the share of AAA spending in IBRD’s total 
work program budget for Turkey steadily increased over the last four years.  Responding to the Government’s 
request for continued high levels of IBRD ﬁ nancing, the CPS FY12-15 envisages an IBRD ﬁ nancing program 
in the order of up to US$4.45 billion. IFC’s own-account investment program in Turkey is expected to remain 
in the range of US$425-500 million a year or, US$1.7-2.0 billion for the CPS period.

xi. What we can learn from the past partnership with Turkey. The WBG is most effective when it 
combines the skills of its three arms: IBRD, IFC and MIGA. Opportunities for mutually complementary work 
are high in areas such as supporting SMEs, exporters, and energy efﬁ ciency investments, which will continue 
to feature prominently in the new CPS. Lessons from the FY08-11 CPS include: 
• The systematic development and maintenance of a policy dialogue in support of long-term strategic 
goals, combining knowledge and lending operations, are vital to support reforms. 
• The new engagement on environment and climate change, which started during the previous CPS, 
illustrates the importance of identifying strategic entry points for policy dialogue and seizing 
opportunities to strengthen engagement as country priorities evolve. 
• An increased focus on monitoring and evaluation (M&E) during the last CPS period, welcomed by the 
Turkish authorities, resulted in a deepening of the Turkey-WBG partnership.
In a number of ﬁ elds Turkey’s policies and reforms, some of which were conducted in partnership with 
the WBG, have gained international recognition. This provides an opportunity for Turkey and the WBG 
to work together in sharing knowledge and experience with countries in the region and further aﬁ eld.

• 

xii. 
The outcomes of this CPS are subject to signiﬁ cant external economic risks. Increasing global 
uncertainty and deteriorating prospects for economic growth and stability in Europe and other developed 
economies create downside risks to global demand for Turkish exports, to output growth and correspondingly 
ﬁ scal performance, and to the availability of international private capital ﬂ ows to ﬁ nance Turkish investments. 
The key to mitigating the most severe risks of further global economic disruption lies in sound economic 
management – and in particular measures to contain and reduce the current account deﬁ cit. Over the medium 
term, increased productivity, the expansion and diversiﬁ cation of exports, higher domestic savings, and 
greater energy efﬁ ciency and diversiﬁ cation of energy sources are the keys to reducing Turkey’s reliance on 
external ﬁ nance. Turkey faces political and economic risks to the effective implementation of complex and 
challenging reforms – which can however be mitigated through systematic policy dialogue, participatory 
project preparation and implementation and evidence-based analytic work. Turkey also faces signiﬁ cant risk 
of natural disaster as the recent, tragic earthquakes in the Van region have shown.

I. COUNTRY CONTEXT

Country Background and Political & Social Context

1. 
Turkey’s rapid growth and development over the last decade is one of the success stories of the 
global economy. Today, Turkey is an upper middle income country with a population of 75 million and a 
gross domestic product of US$735 billion, making it the 16th largest economy in the world. Per capita income 
almost tripled in less than a decade and now exceeds US$10,000. Standard & Poor’s upgraded Turkey’s 
local currency credit rating to investment grade in September 2011.2 Turkey has already met the Millennium 
Development Goals (MDGs) for maternal and infant mortality as well as universal primary education, and 
is well on the way towards meeting its other MDGs by 2015. Turkey is an EU accession candidate country, 
a member of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and the G20, and an 
increasingly important donor of bilateral Ofﬁ cial Development Assistance (ODA).3 Turkey is one of the largest 
middle income partners of the WBG. 

2. 
Economic growth has been aided by a long period of political stability. In June 2011, the Justice 
and Development Party (AKP) won a mandate for a third-term of single-party government, with 327 seats in 
Turkey’s 550 seat unicameral Parliament. Constitutional reform is high on the agenda. The Turkish people 
approved an earlier package of constitutional reforms by referendum in September 2010.  Parliament started 
work on a new constitution in October 2011 and expects to complete a draft by the end of 20124.  Approval 
of constitutional changes or a new constitution will require a two-third parliamentary majority (367 votes or 
more), or a 60 percent majority (330 votes or more) and adoption in a public referendum.  

3. 
Turkey’s regional and global role is growing. Turkey has set out to strengthen relations with countries 
in the region, broadening its engagement with the Middle East and increasing its presence in Africa, the 
Balkans, the Caucasus, and Central Asia.  Recent political developments in the Middle East and North Africa 
have focused regional and worldwide attention on Turkey’s political and economic system, inspiring other 
countries. Prime Minister Erdoğan acknowledged this interest in his June 2011 election victory speech, which 
outlined Turkey’s willingness to extend and deepen ties across the region.  

4. 
Turkey made gains in social outcomes - supported by a decade of economic growth. Poverty 
decreased from 28.1 percent in 2003 to 17.1 percent in 2008 (using the national poverty line), but remained 
unchanged in rural areas.  Extreme poverty has virtually disappeared. Inequality has declined but still remains 
a challenge. The crisis affected households mainly through the labor market.  It led to a one percentage point 
increase in the poverty rate in 2009 according to ofﬁ cial estimates. Although more recent ﬁ gures are not yet 
available, poverty is likely to have come down after the crisis, as labor markets recovered quickly, with the 
seasonally adjusted unemployment rate falling to 9.1 percent and the employment rate rising to 45.4 percent 
by October 2011, improving on pre-crisis levels. Economic growth, social policies, and the nation-wide  

2 S&P raised Turkey’s local-currency rating by one notch to BBB in September 2011 citing ‘continuing improvements’ in the country’s ﬁ nancial 
industry and the expansion of local debt markets.
3 Turkey’s ODA increased almost 15-fold from US$67 million in 2003 to US$967 million in 2010 and is predominantly bilateral (2010: US$920 
million bilateral versus US$47 million multilateral). The largest bilateral recipients are Afghanistan, Kyrgyz Republic, and Pakistan, followed by 
Kazakhstan and Iraq. Turkey’s contribution to International Development Association’s (IDA) 16th replenishment was US$15.5 million, a share 
of 0.06 percent, the same as it was in IDA15.
4 The Parliamentary Commission charged with drafting a new constitution aims to complete a draft by 2012.

2

Health Transformation Program launched in 2003, are behind these achievements. The health status of the 
Turkish people has improved, particularly that of women. Maternal mortality fell from 29 deaths per 100,000 
live births in 2005 to 16.4 deaths in 2010, while infant mortality fell from 25 deaths in 2005 to 10.1 deaths in 
2010, meeting the MDG targets for maternal and infant mortality. There has also been an increase in access to 
education, particularly among girls: Turkey has virtually achieved universal primary education and increased 
secondary school enrollment to 69 percent.

5. 
European Union (EU) accession continues to be a priority. Turkey has a deep-rooted relationship 
with the EU. The EU is Turkey’s largest economic partner, accounting for 46 percent of Turkish trade in 
2010. Turkey became a candidate for full membership in the EU at the Helsinki summit in 1999. Accession 
negotiations began in October 2005 and continue to progress, albeit slower than Turkey would like.   Following 
the June 2011 elections, the Government upgraded the institution which oversees EU accession into the new 
Ministry for EU Affairs.  Negotiations on 13 chapters of the Acquis Communautaire are currently open. One 
of the 35 Chapters (Chapter 25: Science & Research) has been opened and provisionally closed. Turkey is 
determined to continue its reforms on the way to EU accession, its strategic objective. Turkey has beneﬁ ted 
signiﬁ cantly from deepening integration with the EU through growing sophistication of both exports and 
imports and access to ﬁ nancing5.

II. ECONOMIC CONTEXT

6. 
While Turkey beneﬁ ts from strong private and public sector balance sheets, an externally-ﬁ nanced 
demand boom has recently weakened Turkey’s resilience. Strong growth over the 2010-11 period has led 
to a fast widening current account deﬁ cit. In the current uncertain external economic environment, risks to 
growth (particularly in 2012) are signiﬁ cant. Recent economic developments are discussed below, followed 
by a discussion of medium-term prospects and risks.

Recent Economic Developments
7. 
Turkey’s macroeconomic policies and structural reforms over the past decade have yielded robust 
economic growth. Real GDP growth averaged nearly 7 percent during 2003-07, up from 4 percent during 
the 1990s.  Growth resumed rapidly after the 2008-2009 global crisis, at 9 percent in 2010 and 9.6 percent in 
the ﬁ rst three quarters of 2011. Per capita income now stands at US$10,067.  Public sector primary balance 
averaged about 2.8 percent of GDP over 2004-10 and gross public debt as a percentage of GDP fell from 73.4 
percent in 2002 to 45 percent in 2010, in spite of a moderate increase during the 2008-09 global crisis.

8. 
The credibility built with consumers, investors, and ﬁ nancial markets over several years allowed 
the Government to adopt expansionary macroeconomic policies during the 2008-2009 global crisis. Turkey 
suffered from a short but sharp fall in GDP (4.8 percent) in 2009. Imports and exports (which are concentrated 
in pro-cyclical goods) both declined in 2009. Foreign direct investment slowed considerably from 2.3 percent 
of GDP (US$17 billion) in 2008 to 1.1 percent of GDP in 2009 (US$6.9 billion). Unemployment reached a 
high of 16.1 percent in February 2009, an increase of 4.2 percentage points compared with the same time in 
2008. The authorities moved quickly to maintain conﬁ dence and liquidity in the banking sector (including 
through a reduction in reserve requirements and the reintroduction of a ‘blind-broker’ lending facility), and 
implemented a set of employment measures, as well as ﬁ scal stimuli. Between October 2008 and November 
2009, the overnight interest rate was cut by a cumulative 10.25 percentage points. The general government 
ﬁ scal deﬁ cit increased sharply from 1.6 percent in 2008 to 5.5 percent of GDP in 2009, due mainly to the 
operation of automatic stabilizers (such as the increase of approximately 1.8 percentage points of GDP in 
budgetary transfer to the Social Security Institution (SSI)). Facilitated by expansionary policies, output is now 
almost 10 percent higher than its pre-crisis peak, and the unemployment rate has fallen below 10 percent in 
April 2011 for the ﬁ rst time since mid-2008, notwithstanding an increase in labor force participation. However, 
Turkey faces the challenge of managing the ﬁ nancing of its high growth performance as well as increased 
inﬂ ation rates.

year low in 2009 to historic highs during 2011, ﬁ nanced largely by short-term inﬂ ows. The CAD widened 
from US$14 billion (2.3 percent of GDP) in 2009 to US$47.1 billion (6.4 percent of GDP) in 2010 and US$77.8 
billion as of November 2011 (9.8 percent of GDP) on a 12-month rolling basis. Furthermore, the composition 
of ﬁ nancing of the CAD deteriorated with the share of FDI in total inﬂ ows falling from 45 percent in 2007 to 
18 percent in 2011 (Figure 1). Although energy accounts for a large share of the trade deﬁ cit (nearly 5 percent 
of GDP on average in recent years), the non-energy balance contributed signiﬁ cantly to the deterioration. The 
private sector accounted for the bulk of the CAD, and private external indebtedness increased correspondingly, 
from US$188 billion in 2008 to US$202.2 billion in 2011. The high level and short-term nature of the ﬁ nancing 
of the current account deﬁ cit will likely continue in the near future, with the associated risks of a signiﬁ cant 
growth slowdown should Turkey be hit by growing risk aversion in global ﬁ nancial markets.

10. 
High growth translated into continuing improvements in the headline ﬁ scal balance, but primary 
spending remains above pre-crisis levels. The general government ﬁ scal deﬁ cit declined from 5.5 percent 
of GDP in 2009 to an estimated 1.2 percent in 2011 and, after a crisis-related increase in 2008, the public debt 
to GDP ratio has resumed its downward trend. The decline in the ﬁ scal deﬁ cit reﬂ ects the strong cyclical 
nature of tax revenues, but a comprehensive tax restructuring program and a reduction in the interest bill 
have also contributed. However, primary spending remains signiﬁ cantly above the pre-crisis level, primarily 
due to higher capital investment, wage and pension spending. Adjusting for cyclical factors, the underlying 
structural ﬁ scal position has loosened, from a structural primary surplus equivalent to 1.3 percent of GDP in 
2007 to an estimated deﬁ cit of around 1 percent of GDP in 2011.

11. 
Facing difﬁ cult policy trade-offs, CBRT (Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey) has implemented 
an ‘unorthodox’ policy, moving to a tightening stance in late 2011. A weak global economy, the crisis in the 
Euro-zone, and the transition from large capital inﬂ ows and upward pressure on the lira in 2010 to declining 
inﬂ ows and lira depreciation pressures in 2011 have created difﬁ cult economic policy trade-offs. In late 2010, 
in response to surging capital inﬂ ows, CBRT adopted an ‘unorthodox’ monetary policy cutting overnight 
interest rates in an effort to discourage portfolio investors from taking short-term ‘carry trade’ positions in lira 
assets, while at the same time increasing reserve requirements to curtail domestic credit. The lira weakened 
signiﬁ cantly as a result, while credit growth began to slow following the introduction of macroprudential 
measures by the Banking Regulation and Supervision Authority in June 2011. Prompted by concerns about the 
global economy and early indicators of a domestic slowdown, CBRT reduced the policy rate by 50 bps in early 
August. Since mid-October 2011, responding to an increase in inﬂ ation (primarily reﬂ ecting pass-through of 
the cumulative 30 percent nominal depreciation since November 2010), CBRT has tightened monetary policy, 
inter alia by increasing overnight lending rates and engaging in large-sale foreign exchange selling auctions 
and direct interventions.  As a result, the interbank overnight rate increased from 6.5 percent in December 
2010 to 11.2 percent in December 2011, and the benchmark government bond yield rose from 7.11 to 11.04 
percent during the same period. 

12. 
Turkey has moderate public safety net capacity and readiness in the event of a sudden increase 
in needs. Social assistance spending is still low by international standards (1.2 percent of GDP in 2010) but 
growing fast (a budget increase of 40 percent in 2012). Large programs, such as the Green Card and the 
Conditional Cash Transfer Program, coexist with a multitude of small programs. These programs are now 
better integrated thanks to the creation of a new ministry in charge of all social assistance beneﬁ ts and the 
introduction of an Integrated Social Assistance Information System (ISAIS). The new system, along with efforts 
to develop a single and improved proxy-means test for targeting all beneﬁ ts, will enhance the responsiveness 
of the social assistance system to future crises by determining eligibility automatically and objectively through 
a single proxy-means test.

Medium-term Economic Prospects
13. 
Growth is expected to slow down signiﬁ cantly in 2012, before recovering to about 5 percent annually 
in the medium-term. On the back of slower credit growth and falling domestic and foreign demand, a slow-
down in growth in the last quarter of 2011 is expected, following 9.6 percent GDP growth during the ﬁ rst 
three quarters of 2011. The annualized weekly credit growth rate declined to 23 percent in mid-December 
2011, less than half its peak of 50 percent in January 2011. Annual GDP growth for 2011 is expected to be 
around 8 percent and about 3 percent in 2012. The medium term macroeconomic outlook beyond 2012 is more 
favorable and, in line with Government’s Medium-Term Program, projects a GDP growth rate of around 5 
percent per annum, driven largely by strong private-sector led domestic demand. The projected growth is 
predicated on capital inﬂ ows ﬁ nancing a current account deﬁ cit of 5-6 percent over the medium term.  

6

14. 
The growth path projected in the MTP is predicated on continued progress on Turkey’s unﬁ nished 
structural reform agenda. Such reforms include the implementation of the new commercial code and the 
code of obligations, the labor market reform, measures to bolster long-term ﬁ scal savings, and steps to reduce 
the dependency on imports of fuel through an expansion of renewable energy use in electricity generation 
and improvements in energy efﬁ ciency.

15. 
Despite the benign outlook in the baseline scenario, a combination of external and domestic factors 
pose signiﬁ cant risks going forward, including spillover from the European debt crisis. With low domestic 
savings, Turkey’s economic growth relies on capital inﬂ ows to ﬁ nance imports. The country’s large current 
account deﬁ cit and the composition of its ﬁ nancing remain critical concerns. Under a deepened crisis scenario 
in the Euro zone and a corresponding sudden stop of capital inﬂ ows to emerging markets driven by a ﬂ ight 
to safety, Turkey could possibly face a renewed recession. See Annex 2 for the sustainability analysis.

III. VISION AND DEVELOPMENT
CHALLENGES

16. 
The Government of Turkey has set itself ambitious development goals. Turkey intends to be one 
of the world’s 10 largest economies by 2023 – the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Turkish Republic. 
The Government’s 2023 ‘vision’6 aims for a gross domestic product of US$2 trillion; a foreign trade volume 
in excess of US$1 trillion; per capita income to reach US$25,000; and, unemployment to decline to 5 percent. 
Turkey also aims to complete full membership negotiations with the EU; further develop Istanbul as a leading 
international ﬁ nancial hub; and, become the leading manufacturing and service provider both in the region 
and beyond 7. 

17. 
To achieve Turkey’s development goals and realize sustainable shared growth, the Government 
is pursuing a wide range of economic policies and structural reforms, set out in its Ninth Development 
Plan for 2007-2013,8 2012-2014 Medium-Term Program, and annual programs.   Priorities include: (i) sound 
macroeconomic and related structural ﬁ scal policies to maintain stability and reduce short and medium term 
vulnerabilities; (ii) investment climate, labor market, and skills reforms to increase competitiveness and create 
jobs, especially for women and youth; (iii) fundamental education reforms and continuing health and social 
welfare reform to increase productivity and help share the gains from growth through equal opportunities; 
and, (iv) continuing energy and water sector reforms and investments to increase energy efﬁ ciency, the use of 
renewable energy, improve energy security, help reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and mitigate and adapt 
to climate change. 

The Challenge of Enhancing Competitiveness and Employment

18. 
For the last decade the Government’s rolling multi-year programs have been grounded in 
macroeconomic policies and ﬁ nancial reforms to support sustainable public and external debt positions. 
During the 2001 banking crisis, GDP contracted by 5.7 percent and the country embarked on a concerted path 
of structural reforms. These reforms included, inter alia, improving ﬁ scal and public ﬁ nancial management 
and revamping the framework for macroeconomic management, within which an independent CBRT is 
now responsible for inﬂ ation-targeting and the lira ﬂ oats freely against other currencies. The effect of these 
reforms has been pronounced. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) deﬁ ned public sector primary balance 
averaged about 4.5 percent of GDP over 2004-07 and, after more expansionary policies in 2008-2009 during 
the global crisis, the primary balance reverted to 1.6 percent in 2010.  Gross public debt fell sharply from 73.4 
percent of GDP in 2002 to 45 percent in 2010. Strengthening private and public sector balance sheets in the 
aftermath of the 2001 crisis made Turkey resilient when the global economic and ﬁ nancial crisis hit in 2008, 
but growing external imbalances during the recovery have since eroded some of this resilience. 

19. 
The overarching macroeconomic goal of the Government’s medium-term program for 2012-14 is 
to maintain robust growth and generate employment by improving competitiveness and increasing and 
diversifying exports, thus helping to contain and reduce the current account deﬁ cit. As Turkey’s openness 
to trade – measured as the share of imports and exports in GDP – increased modestly over the last decade, 
one target is to achieve exports of US$500 billion by 2023, up from US$114 billion in 2010. Meanwhile, the 
composition of exports by sector underwent changes with a switch from textiles and garments to machinery

exports. Turkey’s trade with the EU-27 also changed as in particular Germany’s share of total exports fell 
from 20.7 percent in 1997-99 to 10.5 percent in 2007-09. In 1997-99, the top ﬁ ve destinations for Turkey’s 
exports (Germany, the United States, the United Kingdom, Italy, and France) accounted for 45.9 percent of 
total exports but in 2005 the top ﬁ ve (Germany, the United Kingdom, Italy, France, and Iraq) accounted for 
only 40.4 percent of total exports.

20. 
Creating more and better jobs for Turkey’s young and growing population is the most important 
medium-term challenge. Although the labor market adjusted ﬂ exibly after the international ﬁ nancial crisis, it 
remains characterized by low activity rates and low labor productivity, especially among women and youth. 
Less than half of the working-age population (15-64 year olds) is employed, 20 percent below the OECD average, 
and the employment rate of women is especially low (26.5 percent). About 31.1 percent of youth (15-24 year 
olds), mostly women, are neither working nor attending school—the highest share of inactive youth among 
OECD countries. Job informality (deﬁ ned as jobs without social security beneﬁ ts) has fallen remarkably, but 
still affects 43.3 percent of workers (29.1 percent excluding the agricultural sector), contributing to Turkey’s 
lower labor productivity compared with OECD and other peer countries. Urbanization, agricultural labor 
shedding and a still rapidly growing working-age population (until 2020) will continue to put pressure on 
the labor market. 

21. 
The Government’s prioritization of the labor market and jobs agenda will allow Turkey to use its 
gradually closing demographic window and lay the basis for the creation of more and more productive 
jobs as early as possible. The Government introduced an action plan to reduce informality in 2008.  The 
2008 labor reform reduced non-wage labor costs and opened Active Labor Market Programs (ALMP) to all 
registered unemployed. Subsequently, the Government expanded the coverage and increased the relevance 
of ALMPs, with a focus on vocational training. The 2011 Omnibus Law reduced disincentives to part-time 
work and extended the program of subsidies to new employees (particularly women and youth).

22. 
The Government is preparing a new National Employment Strategy, which will include a focus on 
making labor markets more ﬂ exible while increasing the protection of workers. Policies and reforms under 
discussion include: more ﬂ exible contracting, including reduced restrictions or disincentives for part-time, 
ﬁ xed-term and temporary work; the introduction of pre-funded severance accounts and an increased coverage 

9

of unemployment insurance; and an enhanced enforcement of labor laws and awareness-raising to reduce 
informality. Also under consideration are efforts to further scale up employment activation programs and 
services, particularly among low skilled youth and women, in a cost-effective way through better targeting 
and proﬁ ling (so that the package of services is adapted to the needs of the jobless) and linking the receipt of 
social beneﬁ ts to activation. The new National Employment Strategy will complement ongoing and planned 
reforms to improve secondary education curricula to build job-relevant skills, increase program choice and 
ﬂ exibility in secondary education, and raise quality assurance in higher education.

23. 
Building skills for work, entrepreneurship, and innovation will enhance productive employment.  
Half of the working-age population has less than basic education and this group accounts for 64 percent of 
the jobless and 65 percent of informal workers. Younger workers are better educated and skilled, but still lag 
behind their counterparts in OECD countries. Turkish ﬁ rms cite skills as the third most important constraint 
to business operations after credit availability and corruption. The Government is focusing on challenges 
like building a strong foundation through early childhood education, getting basic skills right through basic 
education, and building job-relevant skills through high quality secondary and higher education, as well as 
upgrading skills and reducing employment barriers particularly for low skilled youth and women.

24. 
Continuing efforts to improve the business regulatory regime will also be important in enhancing 
private sector competitiveness.  Turkey has made strides to improve business regulation, partly through 
closer consultation with the private sector. This has been most notably done through the Committee for 
the Improvement of the Investment Climate (YOIKK) platform. However, challenges remain with red tape 
continuing to impose a signiﬁ cant cost on businesses.9 The lead agency in regulatory reform, the Prime 
Ministry, is addressing these challenges in the preparation of a national strategy for regulatory reform. This 
is expected to focus on improving intra-government coordination, better documentation of the many relevant 
laws and secondary regulations, and on a pilot project for administrative simpliﬁ cation.10 

25. 
Turkey has made progress in promoting more competitive domestic markets, and the authorities 
have identiﬁ ed and set out to address remaining challenges, particularly in the area of state-owned 
enterprises. Turkey has strengthened the application of antitrust and merger control policies, achieving a 
high level of alignment with the EU. Since the early 2000s a signiﬁ cant privatization program was launched 
reducing the share of SOEs net sales to 23 percent (2009) of the largest 500 ﬁ rms. The share will go down further 
as the energy privatization progresses. However, it remains a reform agenda as government ownership is still 
prevalent in Turkey in some areas of the economy.11 Moreover, these companies receive state support and 
often regulatory functions are not clearly separated. This risks distorting the market and creating a non-level 
playing ﬁ eld for potential private entrants and investors.

26. 
The Government recognizes the importance of innovation to increase long term growth.  Innovation 
can serve as a ‘silent engine of prosperity,’ spurring sustained wealth and growth.  It can lead to the expansion 
of an internationally competitive SME sector to complement Turkey’s globally integrated large corporations. 
Public and especially private sector R&D spending can help boost the productivity of existing ﬁ rms and 
stimulate the creation of new innovative businesses. While Turkey still has ample scope to grow by adopting 
frontier technologies from abroad, it shares with many European countries the challenge of promoting 
product and process innovation among its SMEs, which account for 27 percent of total output and 80 percent 
of employment.

27. 
Deeper and broader ﬁ nancial markets will promote investment and competitiveness. Turkey’s 
ﬁ nancial system has deepened since the 2001 crisis, with ﬁ nancial system assets amounting to 105 percent of 
GDP in 2010. However, despite a relatively large number and variety of non-bank ﬁ nancial institutions, the 
market share of the banking sector, already relatively high, has increased.  Moreover, despite recent gains, 
the maturity proﬁ le of both assets and liabilities remain short term in nature, with the average maturity of 
deposits oscillating at around 45 days, and just about half of loans bearing a remaining maturity of one year or 
less as of end-June 2011. Turkey is still relatively under banked, with a credit to GDP ratio of about 50 percent. 

28. 
Turkey’s ﬁ nancial services coverage is particularly low in rural areas and among female-owned 
enterprises. Expanding access to ﬁ nance is critical for both farmers and agro-processing companies–
especially in the SME segment–to upgrade productive assets, compete with EU counterparts and move 
towards compliance with European Union food safety standards. In Turkey, women-owned businesses 
represent almost 40 percent of registered SMEs, of which only 15 percent have access to ﬁ nance. The banking 
environment does not encourage women to receive bank ﬁ nancing.  

29. 
Productivity and competitiveness have been rising in agriculture and rural areas, but more slowly 
than in other sectors and urban areas—and government policies and programs aim to address the challenges 
of rural competitiveness; rural area job creation; and, rural-urban migration. Although Turkey is a leader 
in the production of a number of crops with export potential, limited technical and human capacity and 
non-compliance with EU food standards (the largest potential market for Turkey’s agro exports) constrain 
the development of Turkey’s agri-business sector.  Agricultural polices aim to bring agriculture in line with 
EU standards, with a particular emphasis on agri-business modernization. The Government aims to develop 
policies toward measures that support private investments in rural areas, including the agri-food sector, as 
well as in R&D and human resources to create rural opportunities and help boost efﬁ ciency, competitiveness 
and improve market access.  The Government is in the process of strengthening water management to address 
energy, agricultural, environmental, and climate challenges.  Possible government interventions may include 
programs for modernizing agri-food processing; an innovative rationalization of land consolidation; and, 
integrated approaches to water basin management and strategic regional development.  

The Challenge of Improving Equity and Public Services
30. While average social outcomes have improved, large inequalities persist, starting at a very early 
age and reinforced in school.  Turkey’s Human Development Index (HDI) has increased from 0.671 in 2005 
to 0.699 in 2011, putting Turkey in the high human development group, although its index remains below the 
OECD average. However, Turkey’s inequality-adjusted Human Development Index (IHDI)—which adjusts 
for inequalities in health, education and income measures—is 23 percent lower than its nominal HDI.  A large 
share of this inequality is explained by factors outside of individuals’ control: one third of wealth inequality is 
explained by factors like birth place and parental education. Inequality of opportunities transcends generations 
and thus appears from a very early age, limiting the ability of poor children to succeed in life: 29 percent of 
0-5 year olds in the low opportunity group suffer from stunting (very low height for age, an indicator of 
malnutrition), compared to only 3 percent of the high opportunity group.12 Similar differences can be seen in 
child care and preschool use. These differences are reinforced by the school system, leading to differences in 
educational achievement and learning outcomes. 

12 

 The low opportunity group includes children who live in rural areas, with parental educational attainment of primary school or less and 
households where the mother tongue is not Turkish. The high opportunity group includes children who live in urban areas; where the 
mother has at least secondary and the father at least tertiary education, and where the mother tongue spoken at home is Turkish. For further 
information, see Turkey: Equality of Opportunities and Early Childhood Development (World Bank, Report No. 48627-TR, February 2010). 

11

31. 
The Government plans to expand early childhood education (ECE) to help correct inequalities at 
an early stage by providing a strong foundation for all children. Adding one year of pre-school education 
in Turkey could increase family incomes by 8 percent, reduce the number of poor families by 11 percent, and 
increase female labor force participation by 9 percent. A plan is underway to achieve universal enrollment 
of ﬁ ve-year olds by 2014.13 Building on this plan, the further expansion and improvement of ECE could be 
supported by increased public funding; targeted resources for disadvantaged children and lagging provinces; 
a quality assurance system, including education standards and a mechanism for monitoring and enforcing 
them; and, reaching out to groups including the private sector and NGOs to complement government efforts.

32. 
The Government aims to improve teacher quality and education service delivery in low performing 
schools to help promote equal opportunities and provide all children with basic skills.  The average 15 year 
old in Turkey is still about one full school year behind the average OECD student. However, performance 
varies across schools and regions: while students in Science and Anatolian high schools perform at OECD 
levels, other schools (accounting for 75 percent of students) perform below. These inequalities are partly rooted 
in the secondary education entrance exam and the system of private tutoring centers that it has generated—a 
system that the Government is reviewing and targeting to eliminate its demand. Efforts are under way to 
expand and improve in-service teacher training. Other key challenges and opportunities for improving the 
education service delivery system and learning outcomes lie in developing a more objective and transparent 
education ﬁ nancing system that allocates funding according to costs, providing additional resources to 
disadvantaged schools, and increasing school ﬁ nancial autonomy and accountability at all levels.14

33. 
Gender equality has improved in education and health, but large inequalities remain in the access 
to economic opportunities. There are virtually no differences in vaccinations and stunting between 0-5 year 
old boys and girls. Maternal mortality has been sharply reduced. Virtually all girls and boys attend primary 
schools and, in 2011, girls’ secondary enrollment rate of 66 percent lagged 6 percent behind the 72 percent 
for boys. However, only about one quarter of women work (as opposed to 67 percent of men), 60 percent 
of women work in the informal sector (37 percent of men), and only 9 percent of ﬁ rms have a female senior 
manager. Even among youth, 48.1 percent of women neither work nor attend school or training (21.6 percent 
of men). Improving women’s access to more and better jobs as well as opportunities for entrepreneurship will 
increase total productive employment in Turkey. Indeed, a 6 percentage point increase in the proportion of 
working women might increase income by 7 percent and reduce poverty by 15 percent. 
34. 
Turkey’s Health Transformation Program has produced gains in the access to and quality of 
health services since 2003, leading to cumulative improvements in aggregate health outcomes.15 The 
family medicine model is already operational nationwide and Universal Health Insurance covers most of the 
population16. Both internal factors (increased social security and health service coverage) and external factors 
(rising demand for new and expensive technologies, population ageing and the rising incidence of non-
communicable diseases) will drive up health care costs in the coming years. Global expenditure caps have 
helped to contain health spending in the short term, but addressing the underlying drivers of health spending 
could further strengthen the long term sustainability of the health system. To sustain high performance, the 
Government is pursuing further reforms to increase the efﬁ ciency of health spending, including: a review of 
the basic beneﬁ ts package, improvements to the current provider payment and cost containment mechanisms 
(through measures such as the expansion of diagnosis-related group payments for hospital inpatient and 
outpatient services to all hospitals), strengthened pharmaceutical policies, hospital autonomy, and the 
introduction of incentives for family medicine providers to act as gatekeepers to the system, particularly in 
strategic areas like Non-Communicable Diseases.

 School report cards may be one tool for increasing school accountability.
 For example, maternal mortality fell from 29 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2005 to 16.4 deaths in 2010. Infant mortality also decreased, 
dropping from 25 to 10.1 per 1,000 live births in the same period.

35. 
Turkey’s 2008 social security reform improved the coverage of public pensions and is expected 
to yield signiﬁ cant savings - but these are insufﬁ cient to ensure pension system balance over the long 
term. Pension spending in Turkey is still modest in comparison to high income OECD countries at around 
7 percent of GDP, reﬂ ecting a relatively young population. However, more than half of pension spending is 
ﬁ nanced through budget transfers. This is due to the high system dependency ratio (fewer than two people 
contributing per beneﬁ ciary), unusual for a country with a young and growing population, resulting from 
generous eligibility for public pensions (early retirement, low minimum years of service). The 2008 reform 
adjusted pension parameters, gradually increasing the retirement age and contribution period and reducing 
the accrual rate. But the adjustments are phased in over a period of several decades, too slow to counter 
the effects of rising coverage and a maturing population on pension system deﬁ cits which are expected to 
remain around 3 percent of GDP until the middle of the century. To improve the long term sustainability of 
pensions, additional parametric adjustments of public pensions, increased formal labor force participation, 
and expanded private pensions would be necessary. Current efforts to reduce social security deﬁ cits are 
focused on reducing informality through better monitoring; enforcement and awareness; and, containing 
health spending.  

36. 
The Government is taking steps to develop an integrated social assistance system and expand 
targeted social assistance to help welfare recipients out of poverty. Social assistance spending increased 
rapidly in recent years, but remains low by international standards (1.2 percent of GDP).  Coordination across 
social assistance programs has been limited in the past. After the June 2011 election, the Government combined 
responsibility for all central government social assistance beneﬁ ts under the new Ministry of Family and 
Social Policies.  The Government is implementing a new Integrated Social Assistance Information System, 
with a single proxy-means test to target beneﬁ ts more effectively. All beneﬁ ciaries of social assistance who are 
able to work are required to register with ISKUR. 

37. 
Building on the achievements in reforming the public ﬁ nancial management system, both in 
sectors (like health and social assistance) and the central government at large, Turkey is now focusing on 
implementation issues and an extension of the reforms to the rest of the public sector. At the central level, 
the Government is planning to amend the Public Financial Management and Control Law, drawing on ﬁ ve 
years of experience with the systems the law established. Strengthening the link between plans, programs and 
budgets will be one priority for the Government—for example by moving towards a program based budget 
classiﬁ cation that is compatible with the existing budget code. Other areas include the full implementation of 
the new external and internal audit framework, the complete integration of the internal audit function, and 
improvements in the commitment monitoring system. In addition, the Government plans to broaden and 
deepen reforms in the public ﬁ nancial management and accountability framework for local administrations, 
where progress has been lagging to date, in part due to the weak capacity of many local administrations. The 
Government also plans to prepare a new governance framework for state-owned enterprises (SOEs), with a 
view to improving the transparency, accountability and efﬁ ciency of SOEs while promoting private sector 
entry and investment in markets where SOEs participate. 
38. 
The Government is planning to advance Turkey’s decentralization agenda, with a focus on 
improving public service delivery while maintaining ﬁ scal discipline. In its 2012 Annual Program, the 
Government announced its intention to prepare new legislation on local administrations’ own revenues. This 
will complement the previous efforts to reform intergovernmental ﬁ scal relations. 

Box 1: Implementing Governance to Underpin Economic Growth

13

• 

Overall, Turkey is ahead of other upper middle income countries, as well as of countries in the Europe and 
Central Asia region, in many governance indicators. Signiﬁ cant strides have been made in introducing an 
appropriate legal framework to address governance challenges. However, implementation issues exist, as well 
as more generally access and use of information by civil society1. This box provides a summary of governance 
challenges in the public and private sector, focusing on areas where the authorities and the World Bank have 
partnered in the past and intend to continue work during this partnership strategy:
Governance and the Public Sector: 
• Public Financial Management Performance: A 2010 benchmarking study highlights areas for improvements in 
downstream budget management, including internal control and audit systems and commitment monitoring. 
It also indicates that the modernization of external audit has not kept pace with progress in other parts of the 
public ﬁ nancial management system. The new Turkish Court of Accounts (TCA) Law, enacted in 2010, expands 
the mandate of the TCA to cover the entire public sector, introducing ﬁ nancial and performance audits in line 
with international standards and providing the legislative basis for improved control. 
Legal Framework against Corruption: A national Anti-Corruption Strategy and Action Plan were adopted in 2010, 
with a focus on preventative and awareness-increasing measures. The adoption of speciﬁ c provisions in the 
Criminal Code, and legislation on public procurement, public ﬁ nancial management, right to information, 
and asset declaration strengthened the legal framework. Enforcement efforts have been enhanced through 
the establishment of agencies such as the Public Procurement Agency, the Ethics Board, the internal Audit 
Coordination Board and a more autonomous Revenue Administration Ofﬁ ce. More streamlined procedures 
for tax administration; customs; and business licensing have increased efﬁ ciency and reduced opportunities 
for corruption. Judicial Reform and ‘Fight against Informality’ Strategies have been prepared, and action plans 
are in place to follow through on implementation.
Governance and the Private Sector: 
Licensing Procedures: Turkey lags behind comparator economies in offering efﬁ cient and transparent licensing 
procedures. OECD indicators of product market regulation show that administrative procedures in Turkey 
remain opaque and continue to impose high entry barriers on new market players. Compared to EU countries, 
for example, start-ups in Turkey have to undergo more mandatory steps, need to interact with more public 
and private bodies, spend more time and money to complete registration requirements, with no single contact 
points (‘one stop shops’) for obtaining information and for issuing licenses. Moreover, according to the World 
Bank’s 2008-2009 Enterprise Survey, the share of senior management’s time spent dealing with requirements 
imposed by government regulations averaged 27 percent in Turkey, compared to an average for the Europe 
and Central Asia region of 15 percent.
• Corporate Governance and Contract Enforcement: The implementation of a New Commercial Code (to become 
effective in June 2012), together with additional steps to reduce red tape, will play a signiﬁ cant role in improving 
corporate governance in Turkey. The main approach of the new Code is to introduce more transparent 
corporate governance principles, with the aim of fostering trust in the ﬁ nancial positions of Turkish companies 
and thus increasing their global competitive strength. The four main pillars of the code are: Transparency, 
Accountability, Regulatory Innovation and Fairness. It is expected that Turkey would improve its score in the 
‘protecting investors’ indicators in the World Bank’s Doing Business ratings following this reform.

• 

1 A detailed report on governance in Turkey has recently been prepared by Global Integrity. Comparative data can also be found in annual 
reports by Transparency International, the Bertelsmann Transformation Index and the World Bank Institute Governance indicators. The 
Business Environment and Enterprise Performance Survey provide information on governance issues seen from the perspective of the private 
sector. This box draws on these and other public sources.

The Challenge of Deepening Sustainable Development
39. 
Building on fundamental energy sector reform, which accelerated over the last decade, Turkey is 
moving to develop an increasingly reliable and efﬁ cient energy supply, while seeking to mitigate climate 
change. After a temporary slowdown during the global crisis, energy demand is growing rapidly, particularly 
electricity demand (which grew by 7 percent in 2010), mirroring the rebound in economic growth. Turkey has 
added signiﬁ cant new generation capacity - 11,400 MW between 2008-11. Future demand growth however, 
is projected to be around 6.5-7.5 percent per annum, and forecasts suggest that in the absence of continued 
large-scale investments in generation and under average hydrological conditions, Turkey could begin to see 
supply shortages by 2015/16. Challenges include:
i. Import dependency: Energy imports (mostly oil and gas) account for over 20 percent of Turkey’s imports 
and about 50 percent of the current account deﬁ cit. Natural gas now accounts for almost half of total 
electricity generation, and has the largest share of primary energy supply (at 31 percent, followed by oil 
at 28 percent). Turkey’s dependence on imported gas could therefore increase energy security risks - in 
terms of both volume and price. Growing diversiﬁ cation of energy supply, particularly through renewable 
resources, could help reduce this import dependence over time.
ii. Legal and regulatory framework strengthening for more hydro energy: Turkey’s target is to utilize its estimated 
140 TWh of economic hydro potential, of which about 40 percent has been exploited. Further development 
requires addressing potential cumulative environmental effects and dam safety issues.
iii. Transmission network investments for more wind energy: Turkey’s target is to reach a wind generation capacity 
of 20,000 MW by 2023 from just above 1,300 MW in 2010. Wind generation is decentralized, has a short 
construction period and produces electricity intermittently with substantial variations. The challenge for 
the transmission system is therefore the large-scale implementation of the still largely untested licensing 
and grid connection mechanisms like SmartGrid applications.
iv. Climate change mitigation through energy efﬁ ciency: Turkey’s economy is relatively energy intensive – 
requiring 0.26 ton of oil equivalent (toe) for every US$1,000 of GDP, compared with the OECD average of 
0.18 in 2008. A recent World Bank study17 estimated that in industry and buildings alone, the total energy 
saving potential is about 27 percent or 15.1 million tons; about 20 percent of annual energy imports. The 
systematic pursuit of energy efﬁ ciency is therefore a priority and critical for Turkey’s energy security, 
macro/ﬁ scal stability, competitiveness, climate change mitigation and environmental sustainability. 
The Government has taken many of the required legal, regulatory/pricing and institutional measures to 
promote energy efﬁ ciency and is supporting the ﬁ nancing of investments through specialized targeted 
credit lines.  

40. 
The sustainable management of natural resources and nature protection are growing in importance 
as long-term challenges for Turkey, along with climate change adaptation. Turkey’s natural resources face 
increasing pressures from growth in energy use, industry, transport, tourism, and agriculture resulting in 
water stress, soil erosion and pollution. At the same time, Turkey is also one of the most vulnerable countries 
in Europe and Central Asia to climate variability and change because of its location and the condition and 
sensitivity of its natural resource base. Issues include: water stress—with Turkey already being considered a 
‘water-stressed’ country by international standards;18 and severe land degradation—with more than 59 percent 
of Turkey’s land area suffering from severe erosion, and forest cover now at 26 percent, down from 70 percent 
originally. Turkey is already addressing a range of regulatory and institutional reforms in the environment and 
forestry sectors and prioritizing investment programs in infrastructure, pollution mitigation, and afforestation. 
Measures to address these challenges are now becoming a priority for the Government. Negotiations on the 
EU Chapter on Environment were opened in December 2009.

 Tapping the Potential Energy Savings in Turkey (World Bank, Report No. 52210-TR, January 2011).
 Turkey’s renewable water resources are estimated around 1,500 m3 per capita per year, expected to further drop in the future as a result of 
climate change and resource exploitation. 

15

41. 
Cities are at the forefront of Turkey’s sustainable development agenda. The pace of urbanization in 
Turkey has transformed what was a predominantly agrarian economy in the 1950s with only 4 million Turks 
living in cities (25 percent of the total population) into a globally competitive industrialized economy with 
over 70 percent of its population in cities. While cities enabled this economic transformation, bringing human 
capital, innovation and know-how to urban centres, they have also brought new sustainability challenges.  
For instance, motorization rates have increased more than ten-fold over the past 30 years (15 vehicles per 
1,000 persons to 190 vehicles per 1,000 persons), adding congestion costs to growing metropolitan areas. 
Housing shortages have driven up rents, causing informal settlement expansion in precarious locations with 
inadequate services and sub-standard housing vulnerable to seismic risks. Longer planning horizons will 
be important for improvements in the sustainability of Turkish cities–as will improved land-use planning 
and a shift to life-cycle costing of investments, which may entail higher upfront capital outlays but reap 
better economic returns over the long term. The Government’s newly issued National Integrated Urban 
Development Strategy (KENTGES 2011) reﬂ ects these progressive urban planning principles. 

42. 
Turkey is vulnerable to natural disasters, particularly earthquakes.  Within the nation’s high-risk 
context, Istanbul is most vulnerable due to its seismic-prone location on the North Anatolian Fault, and its 
high population and commercial/industrial densities.  The Government has made progress in strengthening 
the national emergency management system, and the local system in Istanbul.  In addition, a large program of 
seismic retroﬁ tting of public buildings in Istanbul is an internationally respected showcase.  However, much 
remains to be done to replicate the experience of Istanbul in other high-risk areas in Turkey, and to expand 
the current mitigation actions to include private and commercial buildings.  Disaster mitigation, including 
preparation for long-term effects such as climate change, remains a focus of Turkey’s urban development 
agenda.

IV. TURKEY-WORLD BANK
GROUP PARTNERSHIP

Previous Country Partnership Strategy 

43. 
During the FY08-11 CPS, Turkey achieved substantial development results, while weathering 
the impact of the global economic crisis, with the World Bank Group playing a catalytic role.  Sound 
government policies were at the heart of Turkey’s strong overall economic performance.  Policies, programs, 
and projects realized in partnership with the WBG produced concrete development results.  For example, 
electricity transmission and peak capacity increased by 60 percent between 2002 and 2010.  The health system’s 
greater reach and efﬁ ciency improved health outcomes throughout the country, and has gained international 
recognition.  The progress made by Istanbul’s Governorship in strengthening the city’s resilience against 
earthquakes, and disaster response preparedness, is considered an international model. Most CPS milestones 
were achieved or partially achieved (see CPS Completion Report, Annex 3).

44. 
Over the course of the previous CPS, Turkey’s partnership with IBRD, IFC and MIGA, while 
strategically focused, grew in size, importance, and strength—with a timely scale-up of WBG ﬁ nancial and 
knowledge services during the global crisis:
a) Increased ﬁ nancing: Turkey became IBRD’s second largest client, with US$12.9 billion in outstanding 
commitments at the end of FY11. Total new IBRD ﬁ nancing commitments in the CPS were US$7.6 billion, 
an increase of US$1.4 billion from the originally envisaged US$6.2 billion, reﬂ ecting increased ﬁ nancial 
support to help address the impact of the global ﬁ nancial crisis. IFC delivered US$2 billion in ﬁ nancing 
in 45 projects: 41 percent in the infrastructure sector; 38 percent in the ﬁ nancial sector; and 21 percent in 
manufacturing, agribusiness and the health and education sectors. Turkey is now MIGA’s second largest 
client, with a growth in gross exposure from US$671.8 million at the end of FY08 to US$951 million at 
end-FY11.
b) Extensive demand-driven knowledge and technical assistance: IBRD’s large program of analytic and 
advisory (AAA) services focused on supporting Turkey’s policy and reform priorities.  It featured 52 
knowledge products, many of which were prepared jointly with Government and in collaboration with 
other development partners. Topics included, inter alia, work on public ﬁ nancial management; informality 
and savings; energy sector reform and regulation; food safety, and watershed management, education 
quality, female employment and gender certiﬁ cation, and the (in)equality of opportunities, the investment 
climate, competition and business regulation, and corporate bond market development. 

45. 
The CPS’ ﬂ exible framework enabled the World Bank Group to support Turkey in attaining results 
beyond the strategy’s original scope. The WBG was able to respond to Turkey’s request for additional 
support, and to adapt the composition and sequencing of analytical work and ﬁ nancing to help address 
urgent new challenges, while keeping a focus on longer-term development priorities. The CPS also permitted 
Turkey and the WBG to launch a new collaboration on climate change and environmental management. 
The initial strategy had not elaborated program activities in the areas of climate change and environment, 
but recognized and allowed for the possibility of developing collaboration later. Such collaboration indeed 
developed later, including through both analytic work and ﬁ nancing, and is expected to grow in the new CPS.

 
18

46. 
Leveraging the capabilities of the entire World Bank Group in strategic sectors strengthened the 
partnership. Work on private sector development is a good example. IBRD was able to focus on medium 
and long term policy issues, for example through investment climate assessments (ICAs) and the preparation 
of a roadmap for the development of the Turkish corporate bond market.  IFC focused on infrastructure 
projects, mobilizing US$1.6 billion through private ﬁ nancial institutions, and helped to strengthen ﬁ rms’ 
competitiveness and international expansion including to the Balkans, Russia, Georgia, Tunisia, and Egypt.  
Both IBRD and IFC scaled up ﬁ nancing for SMEs and exporters during the global crisis when such ﬁ nancing 
was urgently needed—serving a broadly complementary customer base. MIGA also supported the private 
sector, and assisted Turkish companies looking to expand abroad – there were ﬁ ve active projects guaranteeing 
these sorts of investments at the close of the last CPS.

Lessons from the FY08-11 Country Partnership Strategy Completion Report

47. 
Lesson 1: The systematic development and maintenance of a policy dialogue in support of long-term 
strategic goals, combining knowledge and lending operations, are vital to support reforms. Major policy 
and legislative reforms can take time to implement; therefore ﬂ exibility and patience are critical for ensuring 
good results. Collaboration on the Commercial Code (seven years in preparation) provides an example of the 
value of long-term engagement from the previous CPS. To increase success, the full integration of combined 
analytical work and policy ﬁ nancing into national development plans and medium-term programs is critical. 
The programmatic structuring of work, in the form of modular interventions which build on each other 
sequentially, is particularly effective.

48. 
Lesson 2:  The new engagement on environment and climate change, which started during the 
previous CPS, illustrates the importance and value of carefully identifying strategic entry points and 
seizing opportunities as country priorities evolve. Turkey and the WBG agreed not to use the environment 
as a pillar in the CPS FY08-11, reﬂ ecting limited advancement of the environmental agenda during 2004-
2007 and a decision to consider a possible re-engagement, at Turkey’s initiative, during the 2008-2011 CPS 
period. Turkey’s accession to the Kyoto protocol and the opening of the Environmental Chapter of the EU 
Acquis in 2009 provided the opportunity and strategic entry point for a new engagement on this topic. This 
opportunity grew out of the Turkey-WBG partnership on energy. The electricity DPL series was broadened 
into the Environmental Sustainability and Energy Security (ESES) DPL series, with three components: energy, 
climate change, and environmental sustainability. This work led to collaboration in preparation for the 2012 
UN Sustainable Development Conference (Rio+20). IFC used its support for Turkey’s liberalization program 
to secure low carbon solutions to meet growing electricity demand.

49. 
Lesson 3: A strengthened focus on monitoring and evaluation (M&E), welcomed by the Turkish 
authorities, became a vehicle for further developing the Turkey-World Bank Group partnership.  Turkey 
and the World Bank established a rolling programmatic Joint Portfolio Progress Report (JPPR) to collaborate 
in strengthening monitoring and evaluation and the results focus of government and WBG-supported 
programs.  The World Bank also provided technical assistance on M&E ﬁ nanced by the IDF, and Turkey and 
the World Bank were partners in many task-speciﬁ c M&E activities during the CPS period, including special 
efforts to include results frameworks in all AAA activities, with the intention of strengthening the World 
Bank’s own approach to M&E.

50. 
Lesson 4: In a number of ﬁ elds Turkey’s policies and reforms, conducted in partnership with 
the World Bank Group, have gained international recognition. Examples include health, energy market 
development, and disaster risk management. This experience provides a basis for further such Turkey-WBG 
collaboration in this CPS. Turkey and the WBG plan to expand their partnership by working together on 
enabling knowledge sharing and contributing to development with other countries both in the region and 
globally.

19

51. 
The World Bank Group will continue to be most effective in its partnership with Turkey by 
leveraging its three arms: IBRD, IFC and MIGA. Turkey and the WBG expect to continue the approach to 
private sector support in the previous CPS—where all parts of the WBG provide complementary ﬁ nancing 
and services to Turkish clients. 

Stakeholder Consultations and Client Country Survey 

52. 
The 2011 Client Country Survey, conducted in preparation for the new CPS, presented a broad 
range of opinions on the World Bank Group’s work in Turkey. Development priorities for Turkey-
WBG partnership identiﬁ ed by respondents were education with an emphasis on skills; environment and 
natural resource management; employment; energy; and disaster preparedness19. These choices are broadly 
consistent with the priorities identiﬁ ed in this CPS and the analysis presented in the CPS Completion Report. 
Development priorities were as follows: rural development, increased job opportunities in the formal sector, 
enhancing opportunities for private sector growth and investment, access to pre-school education, and 
economic growth. With the exception of rural development, these sector priorities largely mirrored work 
carried out in the previous CPS. Less positively, respondents noted the slowness and complexity of processes 
as the WBG’s greatest weakness in Turkey, and identiﬁ ed interaction with stakeholders outside government 
as an area for improvement. Respondents also perceived WBG work as not being particularly effective in 
reducing poverty in Turkey.

53. 
The World Bank Group undertook a number of formal consultations and workshops with 
counterparts and civil society while preparing this CPS. Events were held in Ankara, Erzurum and Istanbul, 
in addition to the WBG’s regular process of consulting with both government counterparts and Turkish civil 
society. Overall, the feedback from all parties was encouraging and provided both a realistic vision of the 
efﬁ cacy of the WBG’s work in Turkey to date, and provided valuable input on future directions the partnership 
might take–both in the new CPS and beyond. In this CPS, to further strengthen its partnership with Turkey 
and ensure that work carried out becomes increasingly responsive to client demand, the WBG will continue 
to work with, and listen closely to, civil society and our broader range of counterparts in Turkey. 

19 

 The survey had a 32 percent response rate.

V. RESULTS AREAS

Strategic Objectives of Country Partnership Strategy FY12-15  

54. 
The objective of this partnership strategy is to contribute to Turkey’s goal of fast, sustainable, 
and inclusive growth that respects the environment. Turkey has a set of clear strategic development 
frameworks that guide the implementation of its reform agenda. The most important medium to longer-term 
programs are the Ninth Development Plan 2007- 201320, the Medium-Term Program, and the Pre-Accession 
Economic Program 2011-13; these are complemented by the Government’s Annual Programs.  The CPS 
design reﬂ ects the priorities established in these programs and is ﬂ exible to respond to changes. The main 
criterion for WBG support in Turkey is its ‘strategic value-added’, through the combination of ﬁ nancing 
support, analysis and advice, and implementation support to help address particularly complex development 
challenges, and relevant international experience to provide benchmarks and help inform the development 
and implementation of policies and programs. 

55. 
The CPS has three main strategic objectives: enhanced competitiveness and employment, improved 
equity and public services, and deepened sustainable development. In pursuit of these objectives, the 
Turkish government, private sector, civil society and the WBG plan to work together toward the following 10    
outcomes during the four-year CPS period:

22

56. 
A ﬂ exible CPS design. The results framework for the CPS deﬁ nes the development outcomes of the 
WBG partnership with Turkey for the entire four-year CPS period. These CPS outcomes are contributions 
to concrete government targets. A number of speciﬁ c milestones will serve to monitor progress toward 
achievement of the CPS outcomes.  These milestones mostly reﬂ ect the envisaged partnership through 
analytic and advisory services and DPL ﬁ nancing and, as much as possible, quantitative targets drawing 
on the planned implementation of WBG ﬁ nanced investments in some areas. The coverage of milestones 
is focused on FY12-13.  The CPS Progress Report will deﬁ ne milestones for FY14-15, allowing for mid-term 
adaptation to respond to evolving priorities. This pragmatic approach is expected to facilitate the formulation 
of realistic and veriﬁ able milestones that enjoy the ownership of implementing agencies.

57. 
A sizable program of analytical and advisory activities (AAA) will continue to be a central feature 
of the Turkey-World Bank partnership. Knowledge services and technical assistance add value through 
the provision of high quality analysis, global experience, and practical hands-on implementation support. 
Reﬂ ecting the high value that the Government places on AAA, the share of AAA spending in IBRD’s total 
work program budget for Turkey has steadily increased over the last four years.  In the next CPS, Turkey and 
the World Bank expect to identify and explore modalities, including cost sharing options, for continuing a 
large and strong AAA program.

58. 
The World Bank Group ﬁ nancing program. Responding to the Government’s request for continued 
high levels of IBRD ﬁ nancing, the CPS FY12-15 envisages an IBRD ﬁ nancing program in the order of up to 
US$4.45 billion. The indicative ﬁ nancing program is set out in Table 3.  Overall amounts will depend, inter 
alia, on government demand and performance, country and global economic and ﬁ nancial developments, and 
IBRD’s ﬁ nancing capacity and demand by other borrowers throughout the CPS period. The IBRD ﬁ nancing 
program for FY14-15 will be ﬁ nalized at the time of the CPS Progress Report. IFC own-account investment 
program in Turkey is expected to remain in the range of US$425-500 million a year or, US$1.7-2.0 billion for 
the CPS period.  IFC expects to invest US$200-230 million a year in the ﬁ nancial sector, US$130-150 million a 
year in infrastructure, and US$90-120 million a year in the manufacturing, agribusiness and services sectors.  
IFC’s  advisory services will continue to focus  on sustainable energy and gender ﬁ nance.

Strategic Objective 1: Enhanced Competitiveness and Employment 

World Bank Group contributing to:
Outcome 1: Sustained macroeconomic and ﬁ nancial stability and strengthened exports, domestic savings, 
and external resilience 
Outcome 2: Increased employment and reduced job informality, especially for women and youth 
Outcome 3: Improved investment and business climate; deepened and broadened access to ﬁ nance 

59. 
Outcome 1: Sustained macroeconomic and ﬁ nancial stability and strengthened exports, domestic 
savings, and external resilience. The Government’s medium-term program projects robust growth for the 
next four years, grounded in continued strong economic policies and reforms. However, new vulnerabilities 
have emerged as a byproduct of strong growth. These are unlikely to abate in the near term, and careful 
management will be important to avoid the boom-bust cycles of the past. Implementing ongoing and planned 
reforms to bolster productivity, employment and to secure long-term ﬁ scal savings will be critical. These 
include: implementing the new commercial code and code of obligations; planned second-stage labor market 
reforms; including severance pay reform and greater employment ﬂ exibility; improvements to the business 
environment; and further privatization that will help gradually improve corporate sector productivity and 
proﬁ tability. 

23

60. 
Outcome 2: Increased employment and reduced job informality, especially for women and youth. 
The World Bank plans to continue supporting the Government’s labor market reform and job creation 
agenda, including in particular the implementation of the new, comprehensive National Employment 
Strategy—with its expected focus on increased labor market ﬂ exibility and worker protection, the market 
relevance of skills and education, the employability of vulnerable groups such as youth and women, and 
reduced informality.  The WBG intends to support government efforts to enhance productive employment, 
particularly the activation of low skilled youth and women into formal employment through the expansion 
of well-designed employment activation programs, with a focus on skills upgrading. The program for the 
planned new programmatic DPL series around growth, competitiveness, and employment is expected to 
include policy actions to increase labor market ﬂ exibility, worker protection, and reduction of job informality. 
AAA is expected to support the development and implementation of the National Employment Strategy; 
education and training initiatives through studies (e.g., ESW on Labor, ESW on Programmatic Education); 
and, technical assistance (e.g., Programmatic Human Development TA). The WBG is also expected to continue 
to work with the Employment Agency ISKUR on the effectiveness of vocational training programs.  

61. 
Outcome 3: Improved investment and business climate, and deepened and broadened access to 
ﬁ nance. The main objective of the ongoing Second Access to Finance for SMEs Project (FY10) is to broaden and 
deepen the access of Turkish small and medium enterprises to medium- and long-term ﬁ nance, with a view to 
ultimately contributing to an expansion of productive activities and job creation.  The Fourth Export Finance 
Intermediation Loan (FY08) supports exports by providing medium and long-term working capital and 
investment ﬁ nance to private exporting enterprises, and improves the ability of the ﬁ nancial sector to provide 
ﬁ nancial resources to ﬁ rms through development of ﬁ nancial intermediaries. Proposed CPS milestones and 
activities that help achieve them are expected to include: 

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

The development and completion of a review of the national competition policy framework, reﬂ ecting 
policy dialogue with the Turkish Competition Authority and through the planned programmatic DPL 
in support of growth, competitiveness and employment. 
Introduction of simpliﬁ ed administration for licenses and permits, such as a ‘one stop-shop’, or more broadly 
(under discussion): formulation of a national strategy for regulatory reform, reﬂ ecting technical 
assistance (e.g., Investment Climate and Competitiveness TA). The regulatory reform strategy would 
cover: (a) the formal use of Regulatory Impact Analysis for the introduction of new regulations, (b) 
an increase in the transparency of the regulatory process, including through formal consultation with 
stakeholders; and (c) the introduction of a well-deﬁ ned administrative simpliﬁ cation program for 
Turkey, with speciﬁ c monitorable goals.
Identiﬁ cation of regional dimensions of the challenges and opportunities facing the private sector to inform 
future policy, reﬂ ecting, for example, the implementation and ﬁ nancing of regional Investment 
Climate Assessments (ICA), building on the 2010 ICA. 
Development of policy options for a legal framework to help foster the commercialization of public 
research and for rebalancing incentives for private research, reﬂ ecting policy dialogue, analysis, and TA 
focused on reforms to help increase the efﬁ ciency of R&D expenditures and enhance the role of the 
private sector in R&D21. 
Improved SMEs’ and exporters’ access to longer-term funding, with an enhanced capacity of 
intermediaries to appraise investment projects with longer maturity proﬁ les: IBRD expects to continue 
ﬁ nancing lines of credit for SMEs (including focus on speciﬁ c sectors like agri-business and micro 
enterprises) and exporters. IFC expects to invest more than US$800 million in the ﬁ nancial sector 
during FY12-15 with emphasis on (a) ﬁ nancial inclusion by focusing on underserved sectors and 
regions like upgrading agribusiness productive assets; (b) gender ﬁ nance by enabling banks to focus 
on women-owned SME’s; (c) development of new ideas and products, including the development of 

21 Turkey has the goal for R&D expenditure to reach 3 percent of GDP and private sector R&D spending to reach 2 percent of GDP by 2023 (Decree 
adopted in 23rd Meeting of Supreme Council for Science and Technology).  In 2010 (latest available ﬁ gure) R&D expenditure was 0.84 percent of 
GDP.

the Turkish corporate bond market; and, (d) South-South cooperation.  If needed, IFC would be able 
to provide a rapid and coordinated crisis response in Turkey that is demand driven and can be quickly 
rolled out with active coordination with other IFIs.
Enhanced ﬁ nancial sector effectiveness, reﬂ ecting technical assistance (e.g., Financial Sector Development 
TA) on broadening the investor base for non-bank liabilities, enhancing the capacity of bank regulators 
in evaluating system risks, and deepening ﬁ nancial intermediation.

62. 
Support provided to Turkey in governance and reforms of public ﬁ nancial management systems 
is a part of the World Bank Group’s Governance and Anticorruption Agenda (GAC). The Bank’s approach 
to governance aims both to directly improve the development effectiveness of its own support to Turkey 
as well as strengthening Turkey’s country systems. As country ownership and leadership are vital in the 
implementation of the World Bank’s GAC agenda, work in this area will continue to be driven by client 
demand.  In this regard, support for the Government’s new governance framework for SOEs will be  
particularly important; and will complement work carried out in the previous CPS. 

Strategic Objective 2: Improved Equity and Public Services

World Bank Group contributing to:
Outcome 4: Improved  quality and coverage of early childhood education
Outcome 5: A more effective and  ﬁ nancially sustainable health system; other countries expressed 
interest to learn from Turkey’s good experience 
Outcome 6: Progress made toward gender equity 
Outcome 7: Improved public services and governance

63. 
Outcome 4: Improved quality and coverage of early childhood education (ECE).  Turkey and the 
WBG plan CPS activities to contribute to an expansion in coverage and improvements in early childhood 
education (ECE) toward the broader objective of equality of opportunities for all. World Bank support for 
the development and implementation of a program to expand and improve ECE in Turkey will build on 
current progress to achieve universal enrollment of ﬁ ve-year olds by 2014 and may include a combination of 
programmatic analytic work, technical support and a ﬁ nancing operation. The Government’s ECE program 
is expected to include a sound quality assurance system and, possibly, targeted resources for disadvantaged 
children and lagging provinces.  

64. 
Outcome 5: A more effective and ﬁ nancially sustainable health system; other countries expressed 
interest to learn from Turkey’s good experience. The WBG plans to support the Government’s Health 
Transformation Program (HTP) as outlined in the Ministry of Health’s (MOH) Strategic Plan 2010-14, which 
aims to improve the coverage, effectiveness and ﬁ nancial sustainability of health services in Turkey. The 
ongoing Health Transformation and Social Security Reform APL2 is contributing to these results through 
support to increase the effectiveness of the Social Security Institute (SSI) and the Ministry of Health (MOH) in 
formulating and implementing reforms in provider payments and health systems performance, and piloting 
output-based ﬁ nancing for prevention and control of non-communicable diseases. CPS activities are expected 
to include capacity building support to the Ministry of Health to carry out its stewardship functions, continued 
strengthening of the family medicine program, improvements in provider payment systems, and a focus on 
pharmaceutical spending and the rational use of drugs. Studies and technical support (e.g., Programmatic 
ESW on Health, including evaluation of the family medicine model, impact evaluation of positive incentives, 
rational use of drugs, and evaluation of beneﬁ ts package and burden of diseases) are expected to be elements 
of WBG engagement. An operation, potentially featuring results-based disbursements, is expected to support 

25

this agenda. The HTP is already recognized as a global ‘good practice’ reform and under the CPS, modalities 
are expected to be explored for sharing this experience in the region and beyond. The Turkish Ministry of 
Health’s ‘Health Care Public Private Partnership Program’ and its strategic plan aims at providing affordable 
services beyond major urban areas.  IFC plans to support it with tailoring ﬁ nancing products for healthcare 
companies.

65. 
Outcome 6: Progress made toward gender equity. The CPS program plans to support government 
efforts to increase women’s access to economic opportunities, particularly access to formal employment and 
entrepreneurship. In the new CPS, Turkey and the WBG plan to build on the momentum of debate among 
the public and policy makers partly fueled by a Female Labor Force Participation Study in Turkey completed 
in 200922. Analytical work and TA are expected to support efforts to help (i) low skilled women ﬁ nd formal 
employment; (ii) increase access to affordable child care; (iii) improve gender equity in the workplace; 
and, (iv) increase female entrepreneurship. The Government and the private sector expect an expansion of 
employment activation programs for low skilled women. The ongoing implementation of a WBG supported 
pilot gender certiﬁ cation program will promote the incorporation of gender equity as an internal business 
practice for enhancing equal job opportunities. Completion of the piloting and national expansion of the 
model is expected in the course of this CPS. In addition, work is planned on gender equity in the private 
sector. IFC intends to encourage women to receive bank ﬁ nancing to serve better women-owned businesses, 
which represent almost 40 percent of registered SMEs. In order to promote ‘Banking on Women’ in Turkey, 
IFC will establish a platform for Turkish banks to scale up their reach to women-owned SMEs.  IFC will offer 
a package of investment and advisory services to interested ﬁ nancial institutions, encouraging them to focus 
on women owned businesses.
66. 
Outcome 7: Improved public services and governance. The WBG plans to continue its programmatic 
engagement in public expenditure and ﬁ nancial management with analytic studies and technical assistance. 
WBG support includes policy recommendations for the transport sector in a Public Expenditure Review 
(FY12), and continuation of the work on a Citizen Score Card system. The WBG expects to also work closely 
with the Turkish Government to support its efforts to strengthen the ﬁ nancial management and ﬁ scal 
position of local administrations and improve SOE governance.  In education services, the CPS is expected 
to support government efforts to raise l earning standards through improved education access, quality and 
equity including stronger governance mechanisms.  Studies and technical assistance are planned to support 
efforts to (i) develop a more objective and transparent education ﬁ nancing system that allocates funding 
according to costs (as opposed to inputs); (ii) provide additional resources to disadvantaged schools; (iii) 
increase school ﬁ nancial autonomy; and (iv) increase school and teacher governance accountability (e.g., 
through school report cards). The School Development Program under the ongoing Secondary Education 
Project (FY05) is expected to deliver about 3,500 grants to disadvantaged schools throughout Turkey. IFC will 
explore opportunities to play an increasing role in the transport sector, given substantial funding gaps created 
by the current market dislocations and withdrawal of many traditional project ﬁ nance banks from the market. 
IFC expects to support private sector participation in the ﬁ nancing and operation of motorways and bridges 
through debt and equity as well as the mobilization of funds from other ﬁ nancial institutions.

Strategic Objective 3: Deepened Sustainable Development 

World Bank Group contributing to:
Outcome 8: Improved supply of reliable and efﬁ cient energy, increased use of renewable energy sources 
and climate actions under implementation  
Outcome 9: Strengthened environmental management and adaptation to climate change 
Outcome 10: Improved sustainability of Turkish cities 

67. 
Outcome 8: Improved supply of reliable and efﬁ cient energy, increased use of renewable energy 
sources and climate actions under implementation. During the FY12-15 CPS, Turkey and the WBG will 
continue addressing energy, environmental and climate change in an integrated fashion—an approach that 
has proved successful during the FY08-11 CPS.  Milestones include: (i) improvements in energy security, 
through the commissioning of at least 10,000 MW new generation capacity, reduction/avoidance of electricity 
supply/demand imbalances, and/or conclusion of new gas import contracts, (ii) expansion of renewable 
energy, through increased renewable energy investments, measured by renewable electricity generation as a 
percentage of total generation, from 19 percent in 2009 to 30 percent or more in 2015, (iii) implementation of 
the Climate Change Action Plan with the help of technical assistance, (iv) the adoption of an Energy Efﬁ ciency 
Strategy, and (v) the adoption of market-based mechanism for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The Private 
Sector Renewable Energy and Energy Efﬁ ciency Project (FY09) is helping to increase privately owned and 
operated energy production from indigenous renewable sources, enhance demand-side energy efﬁ ciency, 
and thereby help reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The ongoing Energy Community for South East Europe 
Project (FY11) will increase the reliability and capacity of the power transmission system in Turkey and 
improve its ability to integrate renewable energy into the system.  Planned or possible energy sector CPS 
activities to help achieve these milestones include:
i. Continued AAA with an emphasis on energy efﬁ ciency and renewable energy.
ii. A third operation in the Programmatic Environmental Sustainability and Energy Sector (ESES) DPL 
series.  The ESES DPL 3 program will revolve around further electricity and gas sector restructuring, 
further electricity market development, renewable energy, the National Climate Change Action Plan, 
and transposition of EU’s Large Combustion Plants directive. 
Investment ﬁ nancing to support energy security, greenhouse gas emissions limitation through 
renewable energy development, energy efﬁ ciency in private ﬁ rms, in the building sector, and in 
electricity production; to help the Turkish Electricity Transmission Corporation (TEIAS) integrate 
renewable energy into the national power system; and to help integrate renewable energy generation 
to the distribution system; and/or to help ensure adequacy of funding for the gas storage facility.  
Turkey’s participation in the World Bank-managed Partnership for Market Readiness provides the 
opportunity to exchange views and learn from the experience of about 15 other middle-income 
countries.  
EU IPA (Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance) grant support for complex energy sector reforms 
and programs may draw on WBG managed analytical and TA support, possibly starting in 2012 with 
initial funding of around EUR 11.8 million (subject to a satisfactory project ﬁ che).  Such input will help 
maintain the reform momentum and strengthen institutional capacities in the areas of power and gas 
market development, energy efﬁ ciency and renewable energy integration as pointed out in the Multi-
annual Indicative Planning Document as energy sector priorities. 

iii. 

iv. 

v. 

27

vi. 

IFC also plans to emphasize ﬁ nancing for sustainable energy, renewable energy (e.g., geothermal, 
hydro, and wind power), and gas distribution projects. IFC will focus on projects with high 
development impact that cannot be achieved through alternative investments resulting in signiﬁ cant 
GHG emission reductions and projects where IFC can play a mobilization role.  IFC will increasingly 
seek opportunities to invest in large ticket equity investments utilizing the Asset Management 
Company and the new Global Infrastructure Fund.  

68. 
Outcome 9: Strengthened environmental management and adaptation to climate change. WBG 
support for sustainable and equitable resource management and environmental protection is expected to 
focus on the implementation of EU environmental acquis, and exploring the options for Turkey to invest in 
environmentally sustainable growth (including sustainable accounting, carbon markets, climate adaptation 
in climate sensitive sectors such as agriculture and water management, and forestry management, including 
completion of the National Basin Management Strategy). Using AAA, the WBG plans to support the 
formulation of Turkey’s position at the Rio+20 Conference. The continuation of the programmatic AAA on 
National Watershed Management is expected to include the development of a methodology for integrating the 
cumulative impact assessment of water usage installations in river basins in the current legislation, effective 
monitoring and evaluation tools, and more effective targeting of investments using social, environmental, 
and economic criteria. The ﬁ nal operation in the Environmental Sustainability and Energy Sector (ESES) 
Development Policy Loan series is expected to cover the implementation of environmental policies—including, 
for example, further harmonization with relevant EU legislation, strengthening the environmental permitting 
and enforcement processes, and further development and use of economic instruments.  

69. 
Outcome 10: Improved sustainability of Turkish cities.  The CPS envisages support for Turkey’s 
response to its urbanization challenge through the Sustainable Cities Program. Using the Integrated Urban 
Development Strategy and Action Plan 2010-2023 as a basis, the sustainable cities program is expected to 
provide an umbrella framework for partners in government, civil society, ﬁ nancing institutions, among others, 
and the WBG to work together in a multi-sector manner to support: (i) policy analysis and advice in areas 
of urban development such as urban transport, housing and land markets, urban transformation including 
an assessment of risk, improving city management, fostering agglomeration and regional development, 
improved urban/rural linkages, and ﬁ nancing of cities; (ii) capacity building for government agencies, cities 
and domestic ﬁ nancing institutions to assess and strengthen ﬁ nancial capacity of cities; (iii) the use of global 
experience for monitoring city sustainability and livability; and (iv) investment ﬁ nancing, possibly through 
Iller Bank, for environmental and energy efﬁ ciency investments in cities. As the Sustainable Cities Program 
develops over time, other areas and mechanisms of engagement may be added. Along with the Bank, IFC will 
contribute to the Sustainable Cities Program by providing support at the municipal level to build ﬁ nancial 
management capacity and improve project preparation and implementation standards. IFC can draw on a 
wide range of products including straight senior loans, both in EUR and local currency, channeling its funds 
through local banks with a portfolio approach, and foreign exchange hedging for EUR denominated loans. IFC 
expects to seek collaboration with local banks in expanding access to ﬁ nance to underserved municipalities. 
The World Bank and IFC/Public-Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility launched a joint initiative to provide 
technical assistance to Turkey’s central government and local administrations in an effort to help improve the 
ﬁ nancial and environmental sustainability and the efﬁ ciency of public service delivery at the municipal level. 
The ongoing disaster mitigation and emergency preparedness program in Istanbul will undergo a detailed 
evaluation. On the basis of this information, an expansion of Turkey’s disaster mitigation program will be 
discussed.  

70. 
The World Bank Group plans to explore with Turkish counterparts, over the CPS period, the possible 
scope for collaboration in addressing selected rural development challenges. Areas to be explored include: 
policies for strengthening rural competitiveness and managing rural-urban migration; technical assistance 

28

and possibly ﬁ nancing for the development of innovative rural investments including for the modernization 
of agri-business; and, technical assistance in areas such as basin management, land consolidation, sustainable 
tourism to foster local economic development, and adaptation to climate change in the agricultural sector. 
Building on the ongoing dialogue and analytic and advisory work, the CPS Progress Report may identify 
further speciﬁ c activities for inclusion in the FY14-15 CPS program.

A Cross-Cutting Partnership Dimension: Sharing Turkey’s Experience – Results, Knowledge and 
Capacity 

71. 
Turkey’s development success and a number of its economic and social reforms have attracted 
international interest and recognition. Turkey is also increasingly interested in expanding and strengthening 
certain elements of its international development cooperation. Together, Turkey and the World Bank are 
exploring avenues to collaborate in sharing Turkey’s experiences abroad. Areas of particular interest include 
health sector reform and disaster prevention and mitigation (see Box 2). The WBG’s ‘value-added’ in sharing 
development experience is the breadth and strength of its global network, and its credibility as the premier 
global development institution and ‘honest broker’ in validating international good practice. As one initial 
step, work has begun to explore trade relations between Turkey and its neighbors. Teams from Turkey, 
the Middle East and North Africa, and the Caucasus identiﬁ ed opportunities where the World Bank might 
support the regional sharing of Turkish success. Other World Bank tools available include support from WBI, 
the South-South Experience Exchange Trust Fund (SSTF), the Knowledge Platforms Initiative, and the Global 
Expert Teams. 

29

Box 2: Sharing Turkey’s Experience—Two Success Stories

Effective Disaster Risk Mitigation and Management: Istanbul’s Experience 
The Istanbul Governorship launched the Istanbul Seismic Risk Mitigation and Emergency Preparedness Project 
(ISMEP) in 2005 to help Istanbul prepare for potential earthquakes. The project pioneered an innovative approach 
of combining a focus on preventative investments (especially the retroﬁ tting or reconstruction of schools and 
hospitals) and programs (e.g., broad public awareness campaigns) with disaster response investments (state of the 
art disaster management center with modern equipment and communications) and supportive measures, such as 
for an improved enforcement of building codes and land use plans—as well as, a ﬁ rst in Turkey, the development 
of a digital inventory for cultural heritage buildings and pilot designs for the seismic strengthening of buildings. 
Initially supported with a US$550 million IBRD loan, the project has attracted a total ﬁ nancing of Euro 969.8 million 
(about US$1.3 billion) from International Financial Institutions. The Istanbul Governorship, with the support of the 
National Disaster Management Presidency under the Prime Ministry, and through the Istanbul Project Coordination 
Unit (IPCU), is already sharing its experience with other countries in neighboring regions and globally, and plans to 
continue to expand and strengthen these activities during the CPS period.  Activities will include the dissemination 
of the project methodology, guidelines, and publications; the provision of training through training modules, 
training materials, or training of trainers; public campaign models; workshops, seminars and conferences; on-site 
surveys; and customized project design, implementation, and dissemination activities based on needs assessments. 
Health Sector Reform: Delivering Affordable Universal Health Insurance and Quality Health Care to All
The transformation of Turkey’s health sector and health service delivery systems through the implementation of 
the Health Transformation Program (HTP) since 2003 has attracted many countries’ attention, and Turkey has already 
entered in a number of cooperation agreements. One of the goals of the Strategic Plan of the Ministry of Health 
(MOH) is to share its successful experience systematically and expand and strengthen the collaboration on the design 
and implementation of health policies and delivery systems with other countries and national and international 
institutions. Speciﬁ cally, the MOH aims to (i) increase the number and quality of projects with international 
institutions, (ii) enter into new cooperation agreements, (iii) strengthen its own efﬁ ciency and effectiveness in 
engaging with international institutions, (iv) implement projects and programs for third countries, and (v) conduct 
training and research activities for and with foreigners who come to Turkey under the framework agreements. 
Neighboring countries, countries in the Balkans and Central Asia, the Middle East, Afghanistan, Pakistan, African 
and other interested countries are potential partners.  Some initial priority areas for MOH in sharing its success 
story include health system analysis, the development of training programs, and the preparation of presentation 
and training materials on the HTP and speciﬁ c topics

30

31

VI. IMPLEMENTATION

Implementation of the FY12-15 Partnership Strategy  
Managing the Program 
72. 
Analytical and Advisory Services (AAA) are central to the Turkey-World Bank partnership and are 
expected to grow further—programmatic multi-year; ‘discrete’ single-year; and, ‘just-in-time’ AAA.  In the 
new CPS, Economic and Sector Work (ESW) and technical assistance are expected to be ﬁ nanced in two ways. 
While the World Bank’s core provision of AAA will continue, Turkey and the World Bank will explore and 
complement the core AAA program with cost sharing activities. Cost sharing, as an element of the Turkey-
WBG partnership, is expected to enable the Government to select, design, and pursue additional tasks. 

73. 
The ﬁ nancing framework provides for up to US$4.45 billion in the CPS FY12-15 period.  Development 
Policy operations (DPL) have a proven record of combining policy advice and support and ﬂ exible ﬁ nancing 
and are expected to continue to play an important role. At the same time, the proportion of investment 
ﬁ nancing, as a constituent part of the overall lending envelope, is expected to increase. Reﬂ ecting lessons 
learnt from the previous CPS, the timing and composition of IBRD ﬁ nancing is expected to be managed 
ﬂ exibly, allowing for ﬁ nancing across instruments and areas of engagement in response to evolving global 
conditions and country priorities within the overall envelope. During the next CPS, Turkey and the World 
Bank also intend to explore the use of new investment ﬁ nancing instruments like Program for Results. 

74. 
IFC aims to tailor its program in Turkey to achieve maximum development impact.  Although IFC’s 
investment volume is not expected to increase, its strategy is ﬂ exible and consistent with the WBG’s approach 
to MICs.  IFC aims to adjust its areas of intervention, products and instruments to the country’s needs – focused 
on its competitiveness agenda and employment creation.   IFC expects to target under-served segments of 
the economy, providing ﬁ nancing in areas including Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises; energy efﬁ ciency 
and renewable energy; municipalities; and, poorer regions in the country. IFC intends to continue promoting 
South-South investments and supporting Turkish companies to invest in the region and further abroad.  

75. 
The Turkey World Bank Group partnership covers only a small part of Turkey’s development 
program. WBG ﬁ nancing therefore accounts for only a small fraction of Turkey’s total external ﬁ nancing23. In 
the new CPS, the WBG’s contribution is targeted at providing mainly catalytic support. Direct attribution will 
remain challenging, if not often impossible—although Turkey’s continued high demand for WBG services may 
provide an imperfect, indirect indicator of their ‘value-added’. In this assessment it is important to remember 
that demand for IBRD services continues to exceed already high levels of new ﬁ nancing and knowledge 
services IBRD is able to provide, given ﬁ nancial risk management considerations and budget limitations.
Loan Portfolio and Pipeline Management 
76. 
IBRD’s portfolio is expected to remain concentrated and strategically focused. An effort to 
concentrate and increase the focus of the lending portfolio has resulted in fewer, larger operations. The average 
investment loan size increased from US$245 million in FY08, to US$339 at the end of FY11. As of January 2012, 

23 

 The scale of WBG ﬁ nancing, averaging US$1.9 billion in new commitments and US$1.71 billion in disbursements during FY08-11, was very 
small when compared with Turkey’s total public debt, which was US$321.4 billion in 2010, and it amounted to 23 percent of Turkey’s average 
public external borrowing (US$8.43 billion between 2007-2010) and less than 1 percent of its average total gross external debt per year (US$266 
billion) between 2007-2009.

32

the Turkey portfolio features 14 projects and US$5.56 billion in net commitments, compared to 24 projects and 
US$5.67 billion at the end FY07. Portfolio quality has continued to increase, supported by concerted efforts 
and joint management of the portfolio with the Government. A proactive approach to implementation issues 
translated in a signiﬁ cant decrease in problem projects, from ﬁ ve at end-FY09 to one in the ﬁ rst half of FY12. 
Good progress in project implementation is reﬂ ected in a disbursement ratio of 31% at end-FY11, and of 20% 
during the ﬁ rst half of FY12.

77. 
A procurement review is planned to increase efﬁ ciency and help address challenges arising from 
differences between national procurement laws and those of the World Bank Group. The proposed review 
will help the Bank to recognize the debarment under national law within the framework described in the 
January 2011 Procurement Guidelines as well as to understand the national rules. As the national procurement 
law does not allow contracts to be awarded to nationally debarred ﬁ rms not only in national competitive 
bidding but also in international competitive bidding contracts, there is a danger that procurement processes 
might create reputational and implementation risks which could prove difﬁ cult to resolve. The planned 
Procurement Review is expected to explore this issue and seek to identify systemic solutions.  In anticipation 
of potential results-based projects in health and education sectors, the World Bank will conduct a dialogue on 
procurement with the Government and undertake procurement assessments to underpin project preparation 
and monitoring of such operations.

Working with Development Agencies and Partners  

78. 
Good and broad relations with civil society remain an important part of the Turkey-World Bank 
Group Partnership. Continuing with work begun in the previous CPS, where civil society participated in the 
preparation and implementation of projects including the HTP and ISMEP, the World Bank aims to broaden 
and deepen its relationship. The World Bank intends to continue using its convening power: working with 
the Turkish Investment Advisory Council; Parliament; and, developing new avenues for engagement with 
civil society, including organizations like TEPAV (Training and Research Institute for Public Policy), as it 
looks to support Turkey in sharing knowledge and expertise regionally and globally. Beyond consultations 
undertaken with civil society in developing this CPS, the World Bank will also seek to ensure that it maximizes 
the effectiveness of its relations with academia, think tanks, private sector associations and businesses, as well 
as NGOs.  

79. 
A continued strong and good relationship with development partners. The World Bank aims to 
continue working closely with the IMF, sharing expertise on macroeconomic and a broad range of structural 
issues. It intends to continue its close working relationship with the UNDP and UNICEF in Ankara. Turkey, 
the WBG and the European Union are working closely together to further strengthen alignment on ‘Europe 
2020’, while also seeking to strengthen their multi-lateral relationship. Regular meetings are planned between 
the EU Commission and the World Bank’s Europe and Central Asia Vice-Presidency; the ﬁ rst of which took 
place in October 2010 with the EU’s Directorate General for Employment and second of which is planned in 
March 2012. A new phase of tripartite institutional partnership may provide new opportunities for closer 
operational cooperation in important sectors including energy. For example, working alongside the European 
Commission and Turkey’s ministries for EU Affairs and Energy and Natural Resources, World Bank technical 
and analytical assistance on energy is currently scheduled for 2012 EU IPA funding of about EUR€ 10 million. 
The WBG also expects to look to further relations with bilateral partners – building on the pilot project run 
by the World Bank’s private sector team (ECSPF) on the simpliﬁ cation of administrative procedures with the 
UK Foreign and Commonwealth Ofﬁ ce (FCO) in FY12. IFC intends to continue working closely with other 
IFIs, including the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the Black Sea Trade & Development 
Bank, and Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau Bankengruppe (German Development Bank).

 
33

VII. RISKS

80. 
The outcomes targeted by this CPS are subject to economic and external risks. Increasing 
global uncertainty and, deteriorating prospects for economic growth and stability in Europe and other 
developed economies create downside risks to the global demand for Turkish exports, to output growth 
and correspondingly ﬁ scal performance, and to the availability of international private capital ﬂ ows 
to ﬁ nance Turkish investments. The main macroeconomic risk is a reversal of capital ﬂ ows, which could 
cause a signiﬁ cant growth slowdown, given the high level and the short-term nature of the ﬁ nancing of the 
current account deﬁ cit. There is also a risk of further systemic disruption in the global ﬁ nancial system, with 
potentially signiﬁ cant ripple effects on the Turkish economy. The key to mitigating the most severe risks 
of further global economic disruption lies in sound economic management – and in particular measures to 
contain and reduce the current account deﬁ cit. Over the medium term, higher productivity, higher exports to 
more diverse markets, higher domestic savings, and greater energy efﬁ ciency and diversiﬁ cation are the keys 
to reducing Turkey’s reliance on external ﬁ nance.

81. 
Risks of natural disasters, while mitigated by some World Bank supported programs, remain. 
Turkey is particularly vulnerable to earthquakes, and within the nation’s high-risk context, Istanbul is most 
vulnerable due to its seismic-prone location on the North Anatolian Fault, and its high population and 
commercial and industrial densities. As the recent, tragic, earthquakes in the Van region have shown the 
preparation for and the mitigation of risks associated with seismic activity remain a foremost development 
challenge for Turkey and the WBG and the Turkish authorities expect to maintain ongoing dialogue on this 
issue over the course of the new CPS.

82. 
Implementation risks. Social consensus on the reform program and institutional capacity are needed 
for the implementation of the CPS which supports the Government’s Ninth Development Plan. The complexity 
and social impact of many elements of the reform program require consensus building among all interested 
groups. This is a process which takes time and results in compromises. However, the implementation of

dialogue with country counterparts on World Bank supported project preparation and implementation, 
and analytic and advisory work can support countries’ reform process. Institutional capacity building, in 
particular in the area of monitoring and evaluation, strengthens the implementation of policies and projects.

Annex 2

Recent Economic Developments24

MACROECONOMIC ANNEX

1. 
After a banking crisis in 2001, when GDP contracted by 5.7 percent, and an expensive recapitalization 
of its banks, Turkey embarked on a path of concerted structural reforms. Reforms were wide-spanning and 
aimed at improving ﬁ scal and public ﬁ nancial management, strengthening banking supervision, introducing 
a comprehensive social security reform, and revamping the framework for macroeconomic management, 
within which an independent CBRT is responsible for inﬂ ation-targeting.

2. 
Turkey’s macroeconomic policies and structural reforms over the past decade have yielded robust 
economic growth.  Real GDP increased by 50 percent between 2001 and 2010 and the average growth rate 
was nearly 7 percent during 2003-07, up from an average of 4 percent during the 1990s. Growth resumed 
rapidly after the 2008-2009 global crisis, at 9 percent in 2010 and 9.6 percent in the ﬁ rst three quarters of 2011. 
Per capita income almost tripled since 2002 and now stands at US$ 10,067. Public sector primary balance 
averaged about 2.8 percent of GDP over 2004-10 and gross public debt as a percentage of GDP fell from 73.4 
percent in 2002 to 45 percent in 2010, in spite of a moderate increase during the 2008-09 global crisis. Inﬂ ation 
came down from a high of around 70 percent to under 10 percent. Healthy export growth (13 percent per 
year over 2004-10) contributed to limiting external vulnerability. On the back of strong reserve build up, 
improvements in the country’s prospects were also signaled by upgrades post- 2008 and outlook revisions 
by all the main credit rating agencies. More recently, in September 2011 S&P raised Turkey’s local-currency 
rating by one notch to BBB-. In November 2011 Fitch changed Turkey’s sovereign debt rating outlook from 
positive to stable while keeping the rating at BB+, reﬂ ecting increasing near term risks to macroeconomic 
stability (see below).

3. 
The Government adopted expansionary macroeconomic policies during the 2008-2009 global crisis. 
Turkey suffered from a short but sharp fall in GDP (4.8 percent) in 2009 reﬂ ecting a strong deterioration of 
investor and consumer conﬁ dence and a drop in external demand and capital inﬂ ows. The current account 
deﬁ cit narrowed signiﬁ cantly as imports reacted strongly to the sharp slow-down in domestic demand while 
exports were less affected. Foreign direct investment slowed considerably from 2.3 percent of GDP (US$ 
17 billion) in 2008 to 1.1 percent of GDP in 2009 (US$ 6.9 billion). Unemployment reached a high of 16.1 
percent in February 2009, an increase of 35 percent compared with the same time in 2008. The authorities 
moved quickly to maintain conﬁ dence and liquidity in the banking sector (including through a reduction in 
reserve requirements and the reintroduction of a ‘blind-broker’ lending facility), and implemented a set of 
employment measures, as well as ﬁ scal stimuli. Between October 2008 and November 2009, the overnight 
interest rate was cut by a cumulative 10.25 percentage points. The general government ﬁ scal deﬁ cit increased 
sharply from 1.6 percent in 2008 to 5.5 percent of GDP in 2009, due mainly to the operation of automatic 
stabilizers (such as the increase of approximately 1.8 percentage points of GDP in budgetary transfer to the 
Social Security Institution (SSI)). Facilitated by expansionary policies, unemployment peaked by mid-2009 
and output began to recover by the last quarter of 2009.  

4. 
Turkey recovered from the 2009 recession with a GDP growth of 9 percent in 2010 and 9.6 percent 
during the ﬁ rst three quarters of 2011, facilitated by rapid credit growth25 and high capital inﬂ ows on 
the back of global liquidity and healthy Turkish balance sheets. Output is now almost ten percent higher 
than its pre-crisis peak. During the past two years, growth has been driven by domestic consumption and 
investment demand from the private sector, fueled by historically low interest rates. In 2010 economic 
growth was 9 percent; of this, private consumption and private investment accounted for a sizeable share 
(about 5 percentage points each, with net exports making a negative contribution; see Table 1). With very 
low domestic savings, and on the back of healthy Turkish balance sheets and quantitative easing in some

 Annualized weekly credit growth peaked at 50 percent in January 2011.

advanced economies, growth has relied on short-term, capital inﬂ ows (mostly mediated by the banking 
system) to ﬁ nance imports, while Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) has remained subdued. This has in turn 
contributed signiﬁ cantly to the widening of the current account deﬁ cit.

5. 
High growth of imports (in particular of capital and intermediate goods) led to a rapid rise in 
Turkey’s current account deﬁ cit (CAD), from an 8-year low in 2009 to historic highs during 2011. The CAD 
widened from US$ 14 billion (2.3 percent of GDP) in 2009 to US$ 47.1 billion (6.4 percent of GDP) in 2010 
and 77.8 billion as of November 2011 (9.8 percent of GDP) on a 12-month rolling basis. Furthermore, the 
composition of the CAD deteriorated with the share of FDI in total inﬂ ows falling from 45 percent in 2007 to 
18 percent in 2011 (Figure 1).  Although energy accounts for a large share of the trade deﬁ cit (nearly 5 percent 
of GDP on average in recent years), the non-energy balance contributed signiﬁ cantly to the deterioration. The 
private sector accounted for the bulk of the CAD, and private external indebtedness increased correspondingly, 
from US$ 188 billion in 2008 to US$ 202.2 billion in 2011. The reliance on high level and short-term nature of 
the ﬁ nancing of the current account deﬁ cit will likely continue in the near future, with the associated risks of 
a signiﬁ cant growth slowdown should Turkey be hit by growing risk aversion in global ﬁ nancial markets.

6. 
Unemployment has fallen below pre-crisis levels, notwithstanding an increase in labor force 
participation, but it remains high. After peaking at above 16 percent in February 2009, seasonally adjusted 
unemployment has decreased steadily falling to 9.1 percent by October 2011, improving upon pre-crisis levels. 
Nonetheless, open unemployment in Turkey remains high in absolute terms, and the Turkish labor market 
is characterized by low activity rates and high job informality. The employment rate of working age (15-64) 
women in 2010 is the lowest among OECD and Europe and Central Asia countries. And about 40 percent of 
those employed are working in the informal sector, although job informality has been decreasing somewhat.

1 Gross public debt as deﬁ ned by the Undersecretariat of Treasury varies from the EU deﬁ ned general government debt stock deﬁ nition. The 
difference arises from the following adjustment items for EU deﬁ ned debt: (i) recording of zero coupon securities at face value; (ii) inclusion of 
inﬂ ation variation for CPI indexed bonds; (iii) inclusion of coins in circulation issued by Treasury; and, exclusion of the government securities held 
by different public sector institutions, (iv) exclusion of debt stocks of SOEs. *actualized

7. 
High growth has translated into continuing improvements in the headline ﬁ scal balance, but 
primary spending remains above pre-crisis levels. The general government ﬁ scal deﬁ cit declined from 5.5 
percent of GDP in 2009 to an estimated 1.2 percent in 2011 and, after a crisis-related increase in 2008, the public 
debt to GDP ratio has resumed its downward trend. The decline in the ﬁ scal deﬁ cit reﬂ ects the strong cyclical 
nature of tax revenues, but a comprehensive tax restructuring program and a reduction in the interest bill 
have also contributed. However, primary spending remains signiﬁ cantly above the pre-crisis level, primarily 
due to higher capital investment, wage and pension spending. There has been structural loosening in recent 
years, from a structural primary surplus equivalent to 1.3 percent of GDP in 2007 to an estimated deﬁ cit of 
around one percent of GDP in 2011.

8. 
Facing difﬁ cult policy trade-offs, CBRT has implemented an ‘unorthodox’ policy, moving to a 
tightening stance in late 2011. A weak global economy, and the transition from large capital inﬂ ows and 
upward pressure on the lira in 2010 to declining inﬂ ows and lira depreciation pressures in 2011 have created 
difﬁ cult economic policy trade-offs. In late 2010, in response to surging capital inﬂ ows, CBRT adopted an 
‘unorthodox’ monetary policy cutting overnight interest rates in an effort to discourage portfolio investors 
from taking short-term ‘carry trade’ positions in lira assets, while at the same time increasing reserve 
requirements to curtail domestic credit. The lira weakened signiﬁ cantly as a result, while credit growth began 
to slow following the introduction of macro-prudential measures by the Banking Regulation and Supervision 
Authority only in June 2011. Prompted by concerns about the global economy and early indications of a 
domestic slowdown, CBRT reduced the policy rate by 50 bps in early August 2011. 

9. 
Since mid-October 2011, responding to an increase in inﬂ ation (primarily reﬂ ecting pass-through 
of the cumulative 30 percent nominal depreciation since November 2010), CBRT has tightened monetary 
policy.  It has inter alia increased overnight lending rates and engaged in large-sale foreign exchange selling 
auctions and direct interventions.  As a result, the interbank overnight rate increased from 6.5 percent in 
December 2010 to 11.2 percent in December 2011, and the benchmark government bond yield rose from 7.11 
to 11.04 percent during the same period. 

10. 
Turkey’s EMBI spread has continued to outperform the aggregate emerging market index. It fell 
from a post-crisis high of 889 (October 27, 2008) to 265 at end-November 2009, essentially back to pre-crisis 
levels. By mid-November 2010, Turkey’s EMBI spread had dropped to 159 bps, but by end-November 2011, 
they surged to 352 bps (although still below the 413 bps EMBI global spread for emerging markets).

Medium-term Economic Prospects

11. 
Growth is expected to slow down signiﬁ cantly in 2012, before recovering to about ﬁ ve percent 
per annum in the medium-term. The annualized weekly credit growth rate declined to 23 percent in mid-
December 2011, less than half its peak of 50 percent in January 2011. On the back of slower credit growth and 
falling domestic and foreign demand, growth is estimated to have slowed down already in the last quarter 
of 2011, bringing the growth rate for the year at around eight percent. Real GDP growth is expected to slow 
down to about three percent in 2012. The macroeconomic outlook beyond 2012 is more favorable and, in line 
with Government’s Medium-Term Program (MTP), projects a GDP growth rate of around ﬁ ve percent per 
annum, driven largely by strong private-sector led domestic demand.  The projected growth is predicated on 
capital inﬂ ows ﬁ nancing a current account deﬁ cit of 5-6 percent over the medium term.  

12. 
This growth path is predicated on continued progress on Turkey’s unﬁ nished structural reform 
agenda. Such reforms include the implementation of the new commercial code and the code of obligations, 
the labor market reform, measures to bolster long-term ﬁ scal savings, and steps to reduce the dependency on 
imports of fuel through an expansion of renewable energy use in electricity generation and improvements 
in energy efﬁ ciency. The current account deﬁ cit is projected to narrow in the outer years (on the back of 
structural reforms and enhanced competitiveness as well as a recovery in global growth) and supported by 
higher domestic savings.

13. 
The MTP envisages gradual improvements in ﬁ scal balances. On the public sector side, Table 2 
shows a shift from a 1.0 percent public sector primary deﬁ cit in 2009 to a 1.4 percent surplus by 2014, with the 
general government balance shifting correspondingly from a 5.5 percent deﬁ cit in 2009 to a 0.5 percent deﬁ cit 
in 2014. Given current global economic uncertainties, the Authorities need to remain vigilant and avoid ﬁ scal 
policy slippages. This will help limit risks, which can rapidly increase in the current volatile environment, 
strengthen investor conﬁ dence, and moderate aggregate demand.

44

Annex 2

14. 
The ﬁ scal adjustment over 2012-14 will come mainly from expenditure measures. General 
government expenditures as a share of GDP are projected to decline, from the 2009 level of about 40 percent, 
to about 36.8 percent by 2014, leading to a declining borrowing requirement. The decrease in spending over 
the MTP period is driven by a decline in current expenditures, mainly cuts in goods and services spending, 
and a decrease in current transfers to the Social Security Institutions (because of the improvements in its 
balance).

15. 
External ﬁ nancing needs will remain high in 2012-16 (Table 3).  Turkey should be in a position to 
attract further FDI given privatization efforts and the potential for mergers and acquisitions. The baseline 
net FDI inﬂ ows are projected to rise from US$13 billion in 2012 to US$18.1 billion in 2016. Similarly, net 
portfolio ﬂ ows are assumed to be positive, consistent with continued Eurobond issuance and the potential of 
the domestic capital market to raise ﬁ nancing. However, higher oil prices than assumed here (US$100), for 
a sustained period, would create additional external ﬁ nancing requirements - a risk that needs to be closely 
monitored going forward. A US$10 increase in oil prices would increase the CAD by an estimated 0.4-0.5 
percentage point of GDP, and would shave around 0.2-0.3 percentage points of growth.

16. 
Despite the benign outlook in the baseline scenario, a combination of external and domestic 
factors poses high risks going forward, including from the spillovers of the European debt crisis. Turkey’s 
dependence on external ﬁ nancing has left the country prone to boom-bust cycles. The weakening global 
economic outlook and increasingly severe international funding strains have the potential to spill over to 
Turkey.  Under a deepened crisis scenario in the Euro zone and a corresponding sudden stop of capital 
inﬂ ows to emerging markets driven by a ﬂ ight to safety, Turkey could possibly face a renewed recession. 

17. 
In such a scenario, unlike in the baseline scenario, public debt would rise. The public debt 
sustainability analysis suggests that the risks to the sustainability of Turkey’s debt burden are moderate in 
the baseline scenario. Under the baseline macroeconomic scenario, gross public debt is forecast to decline 
from 45 percent of GDP at end-2010 to 33.2 percent of GDP by 2015.  However, in the extreme downside 
scenario described above the interest rate would go up, the exchange rate would depreciate and GDP contract 
and ﬁ scal performance would deteriorate. As a result, public debt to GDP ratio would rise to 44.4 percent 
(7.4 percentage points above baseline) in 2013 before resuming its downward trend and declining to slightly 
below 39 percent by 2016.

External debt dynamics are also vulnerable to a severe unfavorable shock.  After declining 
considerably from 56.2 percent in 2002 to 35.3 percent in 2005, external debt stood at 41.3 percent at end-2011 
and is forecast to increase to 42.6 percent by end-2012 before easing to 41.1 percent by end-2016 in a baseline 
scenario. However, external debt sustainability analysis shows that, in the event of a sudden stop of capital 
ﬂ ows, the external debt to GDP ratio would rise from 41.3 percent to almost 48 percent in 2014 (5.3 pp higher 
than in the baseline) (Figure 3). The pace of increase in the external debt ratio would slowdown thereafter, 
with external debt to GDP at 48.6 in 2016.

TURKEY: COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY COMPLETION REPORT
World Bank Group FY08-1126 

I. INTRODUCTION AND OVERVIEW

1. 
The FY08-11 Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) between Turkey and the World Bank Group 
(WBG) was carried out against the backdrop of the global ﬁ nancial crisis. The global downturn had a 
signiﬁ cant impact on Turkey, but the economy rebounded quickly and strongly.  Turkey’s robust growth 
before the global crisis, resilience during the global crisis, and renewed rapid growth after the global crisis 
are grounded in sustained strong economic management and fundamental and systematic structural reforms 
carried out since the economic crisis in 2001 and continuing today—all supported by the WBG.
2. 
Turkey expanded and strengthened its partnership with the International Bank for Reconstruction 
and Development (IBRD), the International Finance Cooperation (IFC), and the Multilateral Investment 
Guarantee Agency (MIGA) during the CPS period. Total new IBRD ﬁ nancing of USD 7.6 billion in this 
CPS—an increase by USD 1.4 billion over the originally envisaged USD 6.2 billion, reﬂ ecting increased 
ﬁ nancial support to help address the impact of the global crisis—meant that by June 2011 Turkey was IBRD’s 
second largest borrower, with USD 12.9 billion outstanding. Total new IFC ﬁ nancing was USD 2.0 billion and 
its committed portfolio grew by 82 percent. Turkey is MIGA’s 2nd largest client, as gross exposure grew by 42 
percent, from USD 671.8 million in 2008 to USD 951 million at end-FY11. 
3. 
Turkey and the WBG adjusted the CPS at its halfway point. The modiﬁ cation, laid out in the 
Country Partnership Strategy Progress Report (CPSPR), enabled the WBG to support Turkey in its response 
to the ﬁ nancial crisis and the recovery of sustainable growth. The adjusted CPS centered on macroeconomic 
resilience and stability; an increase in medium-term credit to the private sector, especially small and medium 
enterprises (SMEs), which create around 80 percent of employment in Turkey; and medium-term structural 
reforms to underpin sustained economic growth and job creation—with an additional new focus (introduced 
through the CPS PR) on the environment and climate change. IFC realigned its strategy to help its clients to 
survive the crisis and improve their competitiveness, while conserving and creating jobs. 
4. 
This self-evaluation argues that the FY08-11 CPS was successful. Both the program’s  performance 
in inﬂ uencing CPS outcomes as laid out in the results matrix, and the WBG’s performance in designing and 
managing the implementation of the program during the CPS period have been assessed as satisfactory.  The 
reasons for this are as follows:

• All CPS milestones were achieved or partially achieved (see Section III below for details).  Sound policies 
and reforms, supported by the WBG, contributed to Turkey’s strong overall economic performance—rapid 
growth, interrupted for two years by the global crisis, macroeconomic and ﬁ nancial stability, and increased 
employment.  Moreover, policies, programs, and projects realized with the support and partnership of 
the WBG produced concrete development results in key CPS areas.  For example, electricity transmission 
and peak capacity increased by 60 percent between 2002 and 2010.  The health system’s greater reach and 
efﬁ ciency improved health outcomes nationwide, gaining international recognition.  The progress made 
by the Istanbul Governorship in strengthening the city’s  resilience against earthquakes, and preparedness 
for responding to disasters is considered to be an international role model. 

26 Date of CPS: January 25, 2008 (Report No. 42026 TR). Board discussion on February 28, 2008. Date of CPS Progress Report:  December 3, 2009 
(Report No.51689-TR) Prepared by Ina-Marlene Ruthenberg, Ben Welch and the Turkey Country Team. George Konda had the leadership for 
IFC contributions, and Franciscus Johannes Linden for MIGA. October 26, 2011.

Annex 3

• The open design, ﬂ exible mid-point adaptation, and effective implementation of the CPS helped ensure 
that all goals and milestones were at least partially met even in the highly challenging context of the 
2008-2009 global ﬁ nancial crisis.  Goals and milestones that were partially rather than fully achieved 
are concentrated in areas particularly sensitive to the impact of the crisis, such as increasing private 
investment, improving export competitiveness, and increasing employment.

• The CPS delivered results beyond its originally envisaged scope and goals. The WBG worked closely with 
Turkey in responding to the global crisis.  Support for Turkey’s energy reforms grew into collaboration 
on renewable energy, energy efﬁ ciency, and climate change mitigation.  Turkey became the ﬁ rst country 
to access the Clean Technology Fund (CTF).  The engagement on clean energy and climate change and 
customized knowledge services on watershed management and the alignment with EU environmental 
regulations led to consideration of a sustainability pillar in the FY12-15 CPS. 

II. PROGRESS TOWARDS COUNTRY GOALS

Turkey emerged from the global ﬁ nancial crisis with an impressive rebound in GDP growth 
The current account deﬁ cit remains a vulnerability 
5. 
Turkey has made major advances towards achieving its development goals outlined in the Ninth 
Development Plan27 and its Millennium Development Goals (MDG), as shown by its 2010 MDG Report.   
Turkey’s per capita income almost tripled since 2002 and now exceeds USD 10,00028. Extreme poverty has 
been eliminated; the primary education and maternal health goals have been achieved; signiﬁ cant progress 
has been made in reducing infant mortality and improving environmental sustainability; and Turkey is on 
its way to reach other outstanding MDGs by 201529. EU harmonization is advancing, albeit slowly—with 13 
chapters of the EU-Acquis opened and one (Science and Research) provisionally closed.  Turkey increased its 
net ofﬁ cial development assistance from USD 67 million in 2003 to USD 967 million in 201030. 
6. 
Turkey’s economic stability is enhanced and its credit ratings have been upgraded,31 although the 
country’s current account deﬁ cit remains a critical vulnerability. After rapid economic growth before the 
crisis averaging almost 7 percent during 2003-2007, GDP fell by 4.8 percent in 2009, and unemployment 
peaked at 16.1 percent in February 2009 (29 percent among youth). Yet, in a rapid and strong rebound, the 
Turkish economy grew by 9 percent in 2010 and by 10.2 percent in the ﬁ rst half of 2011, and unemployment 
fell back to pre-crisis levels, at 9.2 percent, in May-August 2011.  The quick return to robust growth caps a 
decade of robust growth since 2010—a decade in which sound and prudent macro-economic management, 
coupled with ambitious structural economic reforms, turned Turkey into a leading international economy.   
EU deﬁ ned gross public debt fell from 77.9 percent in 2001 to 42.2 percent in 2010 (even after the temporary 
increase during the global crisis).  The government’s primary surplus fell from 5.3 percent of GDP in 2006 
to 0.7 percent in 2010, and the primary surplus is expected to increase in 201132.  Despite broad success, 
challenges remain. The largest of these is the current account deﬁ cit (CAD). The 12-month rolling CAD rose 
to USD 74.6 billion in June 2011, and the annualized current account as of June 2011 reached 9.3 percent of 
GDP—not yet reﬂ ecting initial signs of a cooling down of credit, import, and output growth.  More than 60 
percent of the CAD reﬂ ects Turkey’s structural dependence on energy imports. The high CAD is a particular 
vulnerability, as about half of it is ﬁ nanced by short-term capital inﬂ ows.

 Turkey’s Ninth Development Plan 2007-2013 lists these strategic objectives: increasing competitiveness, increasing employment, strengthening 
human development and social solidarity, ensuring regional development, and increasing quality and effectiveness of public services. 
 According to TURKSTAT, per capita GDP was USD 3,492 in 2002 and USD 10,079 in 2010.
 Other MDGs cover universal primary education (Goal 2), gender equality & empower women (Goal 3); child mortality (Goal 4); HIV/AIDs, 
malaria & other diseases (Goal 6); ensure environmental sustainability (Goal 7); and a global partnership for development (Goal 8).

7. 
The ﬁ nancial sector proved resilient in the crisis, and ﬁ nancial markets are deepening slowly, but 
medium and long-term credit remains scarce. Credit markets are stronger and the scope of ﬁ nancial services 
is greater today than in 2007, at the beginning of the CPS period and before the global crisis.  Bank credit 
increased signiﬁ cantly after 2008-09; by 2010 the share of total credit in the economy was 48 percent of GDP, 
up from 32 percent of GNP in 200633. Nevertheless, while the maturity proﬁ le of loan portfolios has improved, 
as of end-June 2011 about 50 percent of banks’ loans had a remaining maturity of less than one year. Other 
forms of ﬁ nancing have expanded commensurately: leasing, factoring and consumer ﬁ nance assets grew 
by more than 80 percent, from TL 20 billion in 2006 to TL 36.4 billion in 2010. Bonds issued by banks have 
increased almost tenfold, with TL 14.3 billion of corporate bonds outstanding in July 2011.
8. 
A business climate reform program is underway, but trade performance is improving slowly after a 
steep decline in 2008-2009, in part due to weak external demand. Export growth slowed in late 2010 and early 
2011, held back by weak demand (particularly European)34. Foreign direct investment ﬂ ows also dropped 
dramatically during the crisis35. Despite signiﬁ cant increases in 2010 they have yet to return to pre-crisis 
levels. Business climate reforms, started before the crisis, have resumed. Sweeping legislation to modernize 
the investment climate and further align it with EU regulation was passed in 2010 and 2011—including a 
new Commercial Code, which fundamentally reforms and is akin to a ‘new constitution’ for the corporate 
sector and commerce; a new Code of Obligations; a new Civil Procedures Law; and a new Monitoring and 
Supervision of State Aids Law. 
9. 
Employment and labour market reform is incomplete. The Government separated reforms into 
two packages. The 2008 Labour Package reduced non-wage labour costs, cutting employers’ social security 
contributions by 5 percent. This lowered tax loads, reduced the non-ﬁ nancial costs of providing employment, 
and supported the expansion of Active Labour Market Policies (ALMP). The February 2011 Omnibus Law 
reduced disincentives for part-time work. The Government’s Medium-Term Program for 2011-2013 envisaged 
the adoption and implementation of a comprehensive new employment strategy, including reforms to increase 
labour market ﬂ exibility and worker protection. 
10. 
Turkey’s energy reforms yielded impressive results. Effective management and regulation increased 
energy security and reliable supply to households and ﬁ rms. Annual output increased from 176 TWh in 2006 
to 210 TWh in 2010. Electricity tariffs have allowed for full cost recovery since 2008.  The private sector’s share 
of distribution grew from 3 percent in 2006 to 44 percent in 2010. Renewable energy capacity and investments 
increased: electricity produced by privately owned renewable generation facilities rose nine-fold, from 1,490 
GWh in 2002 to 14,002 GWh in 2010; and the 2007 Energy Efﬁ ciency Law gives further impetus to energy 
efﬁ ciency.

Social outcomes have improved
11. 
Health outcomes have improved.  Access to education and to social security has broadened.  According 
to government data, maternal mortality fell from 28.5 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2005 to 16.4 in 2010, 
and infant mortality decreased from 25 to 10.1 per 1,000 live births in the same period—a major achievement, 
although infant mortality remains high in comparison to other OECD members.  Access to education has 
improved substantially: primary education is now virtually universal, and secondary education enrolments 
and completion are also on the rise (for details: paragraph 28).  Pre-primary school enrolment, at 30 percent, 
is rapidly increasing, but remains below the level of countries with similar income levels. Consumption(food 
and non-food)-based poverty36 fell from 27 percent in 2002 to 17 percent in 2008 and, after a modest increase 
to 18 percent in 2009 during the global crisis, is estimated to have been falling again in 2010-2011. 

33 
 TURKSTAT calculated GNP in 2006 and calculates GDP today.
34 
 MTP 2011-2013 revised targets to USD 127 billion in 2011, USD 143.5 billion in 2012 & USD 160 billion in 2013.
35 
 Gross FDI was: USD 22 billion (2007), USD 19.5 billion (2008), USD 8.4 billion (2009) & USD 8.9 billion (2010).

Annex 3

Public sector management and service delivery are improving in quality and transparency
12. 
Public sector management has improved. Successful tools include medium-term projects and 
budgets, strategic plans, and performance programs.  Turkey’s systematic implementation of public ﬁ nancial 
management (PFM) reforms has improved the comprehensiveness, transparency, accountability and 
credibility of government budgets, especially at the national level.  It has also strengthened the capacity, 
transparency, and effectiveness of the public sector and public sector service delivery throughout the central 
public administration.
13. 
Sustainable municipal development is key; improved disaster risk management is a success. 
Turkey’s urbanization rate has reached at 65 percent. The Law on Iller Bankası A.Ş., enacted in 2011, is a 
major achievement in the development of municipal infrastructure ﬁ nancing and effective local ﬁ nancial 
management systems. Turkey’s new Integrated Urban Development Strategy and Action Plan for 2010-
2023 lays out a comprehensive approach to city development, including spatial planning and infrastructure 
prioritization. Turkey has made great strides in upgrading its disaster management system.  Istanbul’s Seismic 
Risk Mitigation and Emergency Preparedness Project is acknowledged as a leading international example of 
work in the ﬁ eld.
III. DEVELOPMENT OUTCOMES OF THE COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP PROGRAM

Pillar 1: Competiveness and Employment Opportunities
Macroeconomic stability and economic growth have been sustained
14. 
Turkey and the WBG responded to the global economic crisis by adapting the CPS to focus on 
macroeconomic resilience and stability, maintaining medium-term credit to the private sector, especially 
SMEs, and medium-term structural reforms to underpin growth and job creation.  The implementation 
of the CPS program supported and contributed to Turkey’s achievement of robust and resilient economic 
growth, improved ﬁ scal performance, and a decline in inﬂ ation, which fell to 6.2 percent in June 2011, the end 
of the CPS period. 
15. 
Central to the WBG’s partnership with Turkey were four programmatic DPL series, and 
accompanying parallel programmatic AAA, focused on competitiveness, employment, the public sector, 
energy, environmental sustainability and crisis response37.  The four DPL series provided total IBRD 
ﬁ nancing of USD 4.4 billion.  More importantly, the DPL series and parallel AAA were the key vehicle for 
the WBG’s partnership and engagement with Turkey on macroeconomic policy and medium-term structural 
reforms.  Economic growth was also supported by 11 IBRD and 45 IFC investment projects.  

Private investment, export competitiveness, and ﬁ nancial sector performance felt the impact of the global 
ﬁ nancial crisis but proved resilient 
16. 
Private sector credit, including ﬁ nancing for exporting ﬁ rms and SMEs, has resumed rapidly after 
contracting during the crisis.  After remaining essentially ﬂ at in real terms in 2009, total loans increased by 
33.9 percent, and loans to SMEs increased by 50.6 percent, in 2010. During the entire CPS period, credit to 
SMEs increased by 64 percent.  The growth in total credit, and in particular SME credit, during 2007-2010 
is particularly noteworthy, because the global crisis sharply curtailed credit to the private sector, especially 
to SMEs. However, lending remains mostly short-term although maturities are gradually being extended, 
reﬂ ecting a dearth of longer-term ﬁ nancing. Indeed, the 2010 Investment Climate Assessment showed 
that the majority of surveyed ﬁ rms (especially SMEs) see themselves as restrained by problems associated 

37 Development Policy Lending during CPS period:   
• Competitiveness and Employment DPL 2 (CEDPL2) for USD 500 million. (CEDPL 1 was part of the previous CAS.) 
• Programmatic Public Sector DPL 2 (PPDPL) for USD 400 million (PPDPL 1 was part of the previous CAS.); Restoring Equitable  Growth and 
Employment (REGE) DPL 1 for USD 1,300 million; and REGE DPL 2 for USD 700 million.  Responding to the global crisis, the PPDPL series 
continued into the REGE series, which also incorporated key elements from the remaining CEDPL agenda.  
• Programmatic Electricity DPL (PEDPL) 1 for USD 800 million and Environmental Sustainability and Energy Sector (ESES) DPL 2 for USD 
700 million. The name of the series changed (PEDPL to ESES) when it was broadened to include climate change and the environment.

with access to ﬁ nance. SMEs account for almost half of total investments, two-thirds of total retail sales, 
and around 60 percent of total exports in Turkey. Both IBRD and IFC ﬁ nancing helped the Turkish private 
sector maintain production, exports, and employment during the crisis.  IBRD lines of credit (LOC) provided 
targeted support to exporting ﬁ rms and SMEs.  The IBRD AAA program included an evaluation of the results 
of the LOCs—showing that the two SME LOCs  contributed to the creation of an estimated  9,300 jobs and 
the exports of ﬁ rms beneﬁ tting from the second export ﬁ nance intermediary LOC (EFIL II) increased by 
117 percent during the CPS period. The SME LOCs included a requirement that on average 25 percent of 
disbursed funds be provided to underserved regions.  IFC support included an emphasis on short-term trade 
ﬁ nance and debt roll-overs, risk diversiﬁ cation through exports, microenterprise and SME ﬁ nancing through 
portfolio ﬁ nancial institutions and private equity investments, and the mobilization of long-term funds from 
other ﬁ nancial institutions (USD 1.73 billion).  IFC’s client banks provide more than USD 10 billion in loans to 
MSMEs and its portfolio companies have 68,000 employees, including 16,000 women.
17. 
The investment climate, export competitiveness, technology use and innovation are improving 
slowly; further advances are a priority.  The CPS program included a substantial of analytic and advisory 
services as well as policy based ﬁ nancing in support of business and investment climate reforms—including 
investment climate assessments, Environment and Enterprise Performance Surveys (BEEPS), a study of SME 
development, and ﬁ nancing under the Second Competitiveness and Employment Development Policy Loan 
(CEDPL) and the Restoring Equitable Growth and Employment Development Policy Loan (REGE DPL) 
series. The program helped sustain the momentum of investment climate reforms through the global crisis.  
Signiﬁ cant progress has been made, including the adoption of major reforms, such as the Commercial Code 
and the Monitoring and Supervision of State Aids Law, supported by the WBG.  However, the achievement 
of milestones has been slow. The ﬁ nal draft of a new Public Private Partnership Law (PPP) was prepared in 
2010 (in the meantime BOT Law no: 3996 was amended in 2011 and the secondary legislation was revised 
accordingly to move forward with the BOT highway projects), enforcement of the new Intellectual Property 
Rights (IPR) legislation has still to be fully raised to EU standards and the Commercial Code will take time to 
become effective and be implemented. Preparation for a new capital markets law is ongoing.  IBRD and IFC 
are working together in providing ongoing support to the Capital Markets Board on the development of a 
corporate bond market.  In the meantime, IFC ﬁ nancing has helped strengthen Turkish ﬁ rms’ competitiveness 
with new technology (e.g. energy efﬁ ciency and cleaner production) and on supporting Turkish companies’ 
regional and international expansion (15 projects in the Balkans, Russia, Georgia, Haiti, Tunisia, Egypt, and 
Argentina with over USD 350 million in ﬁ nancing).  MIGA worked extensively on this issue. In Turkey 5 projects 
(4 infrastructure and 1 ﬁ nance) 38 were carried out, with a total of USD 1.02 billion in gross exposure. The ﬁ rst 
underground metro system on the Asian side of Istanbul was supported by MIGA’s new guarantee product. 
MIGA added 1 guarantee supporting an investment sponsored by a Turkish investor in a manufacturing 
project in Iraq, bringing the total gross exposure of MIGA guarantees to Turkish investments outside Turkey 
to USD 29 million in 5 currently active projects.

Turkey’s low employment rate and high informality remain a challenge
18. 
Turkey’s low employment rates and high informality made policies to enhance productive 
employment a top priority.  A series of analyses, most joint with government and other development partners, 
and advisory work led to key policy recommendations on labour taxes, informal economy, female labour 
force participation, and youth employment.  IBRD ﬁ nancing under the PPDPL-REGE DPL series supported 
the ﬁ rst stage of Turkey’s labour market reform in 2008, which was focused on reducing non-wage labour 
costs and improving skills.  Technical assistance supported the preparation of a crisis-response employment 
package; the expansion and improvement of Active Labor Market Policies (ALMP);39 and the development of 
the upcoming National Employment Strategy.

Annex 3

Energy supply is more reliable and more efﬁ cient

19. 
Turkey has an impressive track record in implementing reforms and improving energy security.  
During the CPS period, Turkey updated its energy strategy; and introduced and implemented cost recovery 
pricing. IBRD’s ﬁ nancing and knowledge activities supported tariff reform, privatization, energy market 
liberalization and regulation, power generation rehabilitation and transmission investments, and the 
strengthening of Turkey’s Electricity Transmission Corporation (TEIAS). IFC invested around USD 2.2 billion 
(USD 560 million of its own ﬁ nancing and over USD 1.6 billion through mobilization) in 5 power sector 
projects. The power sector represented the majority of IFC investments in infrastructure, with syndication an 
important component of IFC ﬁ nancing.  IFC investments focused on supply security through private sector 
participation in power distribution, including one of Turkey’s ﬁ rst two privatized distribution companies40, 
and new generation capacity projects, particularly clean energy projects41. 

20. 
Increasing renewable energy use and energy efﬁ ciency is vital for Turkey. Renewable energy and 
energy efﬁ ciency investments increase energy supply security; help contain energy imports and thus the 
current account deﬁ cit; create jobs; and reduce greenhouse gas emissions and help mitigate climate change. 
In short, they are a “quadruple win.”  The Turkey-WBG partnership has included a major focus on promoting 
renewable energy use and energy, and during the CPS period Turkey established a clear legislative-regulatory 
framework for renewable energy, implemented energy efﬁ ciency legislation, and included renewable energy 
and energy efﬁ ciency as key components in its new National Climate Change Strategy.  As a result, Turkey 
was able to attract substantial private investment for the development of renewable energy, especially 
wind and small hydropower stations. Extensive IBRD knowledge services and the PEDPL-ESES DPL series 
supported the new legislation and reforms.  WBG ﬁ nancing included IBRD credit lines, intermediated through 
local institutions, for renewable energy and energy efﬁ ciency investments,42 especially in wind power and 
small-scale hydropower plants.  IBRD and IFC partnered with the Clean Technology Fund (CTF).  IFC also 
undertook the ﬁ rst limited recourse wind farm ﬁ nancing, laid the groundwork for private investment in 
new technologies like solar technology, facilitated JVs between international players and local partners, and 
in March 2011 published ‘Sustainable Investment in Turkey’, as a part of IFC’s broader efforts to promote 
sustainable investment.  

21. 
Addressing climate change is becoming a priority. Turkey became a party to the Kyoto protocol on 
August 26th 2009, and the Government and the WBG have become partners in Turkey’s efforts to mitigate 
and adapt to climate change.   As the energy sector accounts for more than 70 percent of Turkey’s greenhouse 
gas emissions, climate change mitigation is closely tied to “green and clean” energy investments and reforms. 
This link is reﬂ ected in Turkey’s new National Climate Change Strategy and forthcoming National Climate 
Change Action Plan.  The World Bank has supported the National Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan 
with advisory services and through the Environmental Sustainability and Energy Sector (ESES) DPL II. IFC 
supported its client companies to invest in new technologies with a focus on energy efﬁ ciency and cleaner 
production. Also, IFC’s investments in the energy sector were focused on renewable energy projects43.  As 
Turkey is expected to be among the countries most affected by climate change in the Europe and Central Asia 
region, climate change adaptation will continue growing in importance over the medium term.

 Awarded “Best Power Deal in CEE” by EMEA Finance
 Enerjisa was selected as 2008 “European Portfolio Power Deal of the Year” by Project Finance Euromoney Magazine, as well as “Best EMEA 
power Deal for 2008” by EMEA Finance Magazine.
 IBRD Credit Lines in this CPS were as follows: Fourth Export Finance Intermediary Loan (EFIL IV), 2008; Access to Finance for SMEs – 
Additional Financing, 2009 ; Private Sector Renewable Energy & Energy Efﬁ ciency, 2009; Access to Finance for SMEs – Second Additional 
Financing, 2010; Access to Finance for SME II, 2010; & Fourth Export Finance Intermediary Loan (EFIL IV) Additional Financing, 2011.
43 The Enerjisa project alone is expected to generate over 20,000 MWh of clean energy, representing nearly 10 percent of Turkey’s electricity needs, 
and to reduce anticipated CO2 emissions by 1.15 million tons per year by 2014. 

Annex 3

Pillar 2: Equitable Human and Social Development

Social security has been strengthened and become more equitable 
22. 
Turkey’s health and social security reform (the Social Insurance and Universal Health Insurance 
Law was enacted in 2006, amended in 2008 and most provisions of the Law took effect by October 1, 2008) 
established universal health insurance, increased coverage for the poor, and fundamentally reformed the 
pension system.  The Green Card system, established in 1992, provides free access to medical care for those 
who earn less than a certain minimum (deﬁ ned by law) and are not covered by public insurance. The Green 
Card program grew from 6.852 million beneﬁ ciaries in 2004 to 9.4 million in 2010 which, along with the 
introduction of universal health insurance, have signiﬁ cantly increased   the share of the population covered 
by some form of health insurance (an increase from 86 percent in 2005 to 96.2 percent in 2010). All Green Card 
holders are expected to be covered by 2012 according to the Law No: 5510 Provisional Article 12.  The health 
and social security reform also put the pension system on a path toward long-term ﬁ scal sustainability and 
improved its equity, by better aligning the pensions of civil servants, workers and the self-employed.
23. 
 Some initial steps were taken to integrate social assistance programs. While social assistance 
spending increased rapidly, it accounted for only 1.2 percent of GDP in 2009. A new ministry called the 
Ministry of Family and Social Policies was created after the June 2011 elections, bringing all social beneﬁ ts 
under a single roof. An integrated social assistance information system has been developed and is already 
operational. 
24. 
The WBG has been a close partner with Turkey in supporting social security reform and in efforts 
to improve equity and inclusion.  The PPDPL and REGE DPL series and parallel policy dialogue, analyses, 
and advisory services supported the social security and universal health insurance reform, the accompanying 
administrative reform to unify existing social security schemes under the Social Security Institution (SSI), and 
crisis response measures.   The Second Privatization Social Support Project (PSSP2) assisted the privatization 
program by mitigating the negative social and economic impacts of the privatization of State-Owned 
Enterprises (SOEs).  Analytical studies, technical assistance and close policy dialogue included assessments 
of the welfare impact of the economic slowdown, labour force activation policies, pensions’ and the Green 
Card program.

25. 
Two major studies, on female labour force participation (joint with the Government) and on 
equality of opportunity, broke new ground on key social policy issues in Turkey, providing new analysis, 
advancing public debate, and helping inform policy. The female labor force participation study found that 
an increase in female employment to 29 percent (the target rate in Turkey’s 9th Development Plan), with new 
entrants assuming full-time jobs, could reduce the poverty rate to 15.5 percent.   The equality of opportunity 
study found large demographic disparities in opportunity among children from early ages and made the case 
for early childhood development as an effective means to promote equal opportunities, strengthen growth, 
and reduce poverty.  The studies’ ﬁ ndings were taken up in a joint WBG/United Nations Children’s Fund 
(UNICEF) conference on Early Childhood Development (ECD).  A roundtable on Early Childhood Education 
(ECE) and a study exploring the expansion of the provision of high quality ECE followed—in partnership 
with UNICEF and in support of the Government’s priority program to roll out universal pre-school education. 

Turkey’s health system has become more effective

26. 
Turkey’s Health Transformation Program (HTP) has improved healthcare. It increased access, 
ﬁ nancial protection, service coverage and patient satisfaction. The roll-out of Family Medicine as part of the 
HTP, completed in December 2010, improved patient satisfaction and access to health services across the 
country. Average patient satisfaction in family medicine provinces rose from 69 percent in 2004 to 86 percent 
in 2008. 

56

Annex 3

27. WBG support for the strong implementation of the HTP complemented the support for the 
introduction of universal health insurance, improvements in health system performance, and ﬁ scal 
sustainability under the PPDPL-REGE DPL series.  IBRD support for the HTP focused on increasing 
health insurance coverage, expanding and improving family medicine, improving hospital autonomy, and 
strengthening performance management.  It included two Adaptable Program Loans—the Health Transition 
Project and the Health Transformation and Social Security Reform Project—and accompanying advisory 
services and technical assistance.  A 2008 study jointly prepared with the Organisation for Economic Co-
operation and Development (OECD) assessed health system performance and provided the analytical 
foundation for deepening reforms.  The World Bank Institute (WBI) engaged policy makers and stakeholders 
on health sector reform and sustainable ﬁ nancing. IFC supported private sector participation with two 
investments totalling USD 50 million. Through a loan to a leading leasing company in Turkey, IFC supported 
550 SME healthcare projects. Additionally, through equity investments in a distressed but signiﬁ cant 
healthcare provider, IFC enabled improved access to high quality private healthcare services at affordable 
prices, including frontier and underserved regions.
The education system is expanding, reforming, and increasing its sensitivity to labor demand
28. 
Education reforms led to improvements in school access and educational achievements. Primary 
education is now nearly universal (98 percent in 2010-2011).  Secondary education enrolment and completion 
rates increased signiﬁ cantly during the CPS period: enrolments increased from 57 percent in 2006-2007 to 69 
percent in 2010-2011, and completion rose from 45 percent to 51 percent in the same period44.  Pre-primary 
education enrolments are increasing rapidly, as the Government is rolling out its program to implement 
universal pre-school enrolment of 5 year olds by 2014.  Regional and gender disparities remain signiﬁ cant.  For 
example, 2010-2011 preschool enrolments varied between 13 percent in Hakkarı and 59 percent in Amasya, 
and girls’ secondary school enrolments remain six percentage points below boys’ (66 versus 72 percent).  
Turkey’s results in the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA), which assesses the educational 
attainment of 15-year olds, improved signiﬁ cantly in the 2009 round compared with the 2006 round, partly 
due to the new primary education curriculum.  However, the average 15 year old remains about one full 
school year behind the average OECD student.    

29. 
Turkey’s partnership with the WBG in education focused on improvements in quality and equity.  
The IBRD supported Secondary Education Project (SEP) included the development of a new secondary school 
curriculum and a national career guidance and counselling system to improve the quality and relevance 
of secondary education—along with the development of a national qualiﬁ cations framework for vocational 
education and training, and enhanced in-service teacher training.  To improve the quality of disadvantaged 
schools, the SEP introduced school grants and piloted a different way of ﬁ nancing schools: funds are distributed 
in proportion to the number of students, and schools have autonomy in the allocation of funds.   Analytic 
and advisory services included studies on the quality and equity of basic education and early childhood 
education.

Pillar 3: Efﬁ cient Provision of High Quality Public Services

Public expenditure management system has improved; Public sector governance was strengthened
30. 
Turkey’s public sector increased in breadth, transparency, accountability and credibility, 
according to the Public Financial Management Performance (PFMP) benchmarking in June 2010. Turkey 
has reformed many central government institutions, systems and laws governing public sector transparency 
and performance. The implementation of the 2006 Public Financial Management and Control (PFMC) 
Law throughout the CPS period effectively delegated ﬁ nancial control and internal audit to line agencies. 

44 Here the secondary completion rate is deﬁ ned as the proportion of 20-24 year olds who have completed at least secondary education, data taken 
from Labor Force Survey.

Annex 3

57

Accordingly, ﬁ nancial controls and internal and external audit structures have signiﬁ cantly improved. The 
enactment of the Turkish Court of Accounts (TCA) Law in December 2010 broadened the mandate of the TCA 
to audit the entire general government and aligned its structure with the PFMC Law. 

31. 
The Turkey-WBG partnership on public sector reform included both analytic and advisory 
services and ﬁ nancing.  Programmatic public expenditure and public ﬁ nancial management analytic work 
and technical assistance, jointly implemented with the Government and also with Parliament, and ﬁ nancial 
support under the PPDPL-REGE DPL series were closely integrated with the National Development Plan.  
Their programmatic design proved effective in the support of complex public sector legal and institutional 
reforms, which often require a number of years to fully implement and deliver.  Two examples are the 
establishment of strategy development units for ﬁ nancial control and internal audit in all general government 
institutions, and the development of speciﬁ c codes to allow the Ministries of Finance and Health to track 
program expenditures under the HTP.  The TCDD Railway Restructuring Project met its development 
objectives, as operating revenues and the ratio of operating revenues to expenses rose toward commercially 
viable levels. TCDD’s legal status is unchanged, although a draft law is under preparation.

32. 
Progress on the judicial aspects of governance has been slower. A new Civil Procedure Code 
was enacted in February 2011 and the Government plans to resubmit a draft mediation law to the Judicial 
Commission of the Grand National Assembly. The judicial network project (UYAP) established online 
connections in 100 percent of courts. The Judicial Reform Strategy and Action Plan was endorsed and 
published in 2009. Regional Courts of Appeal have been established in 15 centers (Istanbul, Bursa, İzmir, 
Ankara, Konya, Samsun, Adana, Erzurum, Diyarbakır, Sakarya, Gaziantep, Antalya, Kayseri, Trabzon and 
Van) but are not yet operational. However chief public prosecutors of all these courts have been appointed by 
High Council for Judges and Prosecutors. The efﬁ ciency of judicial processes has been reforming slowly, and 
Turkey’s demand for World Bank contributions was limited. 
Local service delivery and disaster preparedness have improved
33. Municipal reform has moved forward. Total budgetary transfers to local administrations as a share 
of tax revenues increased from 9 percent in 2007 to 10 percent in 2010 (including BELDES and KOYDES 
programs that support development at local level, the budgetary transfer to local administrations increased 
from 10 percent to 11 percent during the same period). The Law on Iller Bankası A.Ş., enacted in 2011, was 
critical for municipal infrastructure ﬁ nancing and effective local ﬁ nancial management systems. Progress 
was made on cadastre modernisation. Cadastre and Registration Agency has started working on property 
valuation policy in-line with international practices and standards, and 24 institutions now have on-line 
access to digital cadastre information, exceeding the target of 18.  Successful IBRD support for municipal 
infrastructure investments, through Iller Bank, led to additional ﬁ nancing in 2010 to scale up results.  IFC’s 
investment in the Istanbul Metro was the ﬁ rst WBG ﬁ nancing in Turkey at a sub-national level without a 
sovereign guarantee and has become a ﬂ agship project for private sector participation in the urban sector.  It 
is considered a major step towards greater ﬁ nancial strength and independence for municipal governments 
in Turkey.  Beyond the original CPS objectives, Turkey and the WBG started work on ‘Sustainable Cities’, and 
Turkey launched a new Integrated Urban Development Strategy and Action Plan (2010-2023)—envisaging a 
comprehensive approach to city development, including spatial planning and infrastructure prioritization. 
34. 
Istanbul’s improvements in disaster preparedness are an international success story. Investments 
have been made in seismic strengthening for public buildings, especially schools, hospitals and dormitories. 
Of 1,576 public facilities identiﬁ ed, 496 had been completed by February 2011 through combined World 
Bank, EIB and CEB ﬁ nancing. The Istanbul Seismic Mitigation and Emergency Preparedness (ISMEP) Project 
includes collaboration with the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Response and the World Bank 
Institute (WBI). A national-level Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency was created in the Prime 
Ministry, unifying previously fragmented institutional responsibilities.

IV. WORLD BANK GROUP PERFORMANCE

Country Partnership Design

35. 
The CPS was designed to be based on, fully aligned with, and adaptable to changes in Turkey’s 
evolving development priorities.  The ﬂ exible CPS design was tested and proved successful during the global 
ﬁ nancial crisis, as the strategy was adjusted at the mid-term progress review (CPSPR). DPL support expanded 
and focused on macroeconomic stability and medium-term structural reforms to support economic growth 
and job creation (REGE DPL series)45. In response to client demand, IBRD increased total ﬁ nancing over the 
CPS period was USD 7.6 billion, with USD 3 billion committed in FY10. In parallel, in view of global credit 
restrictions, IFC focused on client companies rolling-over short-term debt, provided much needed short-term 
ﬁ nance such as trade ﬁ nance, and mobilized long-term funds from other ﬁ nancial institutions (USD 1.73 
billion).  

36. 
The CPS was designed to support Turkey’s Ninth Development Plan, with advisory services geared 
to inform and support national policies and WBG ﬁ nancing contributing to large nation-wide programs 
and selected speciﬁ c projects.  Combined ﬁ nancing and knowledge services enabled support to be delivered 
in a targeted, effective and timely manner.  The extensive use of programmatic AAA and DPLs allowed IBRD 
to provide customized and consistent yet ﬂ exible support for broad development goals and programs over 
several years. The large volume of LOCs (6 WBG operations, including 3 Additional Financings, totalling 
USD 2.35 billion) is a distinct feature of the CPS program, facilitating the wide reach and rapid disbursement 
of WBG project ﬁ nancing.46  These design choices reﬂ ect country demand and a shared assessment by Turkey 
and the WBG of the areas of maximum WBG “value-added.”  Naturally, the Turkey-WBG partnership covers 
only a small part of Turkey’s development program, and WBG ﬁ nancing accounts for only a small fraction 
of Turkey’s total external ﬁ nancing47.  The WBG’s contribution has thus been mainly catalytic, with direct 
attribution being challenging if not often impossible, and with Turkey’s continued high demand for WBG 
services providing an imperfect, indirect indicator of their value added.  Demand for IBRD services continues 
to exceed the already high levels of new ﬁ nancing and knowledge services IBRD is able to provide, given 
ﬁ nancial risk management considerations and budget limitations.

37. 
In general, the CPS results framework was a useful structure for measuring progress and 
performance.  Milestones in the results framework were largely met.  A review of results against targets 
must take into account that some original milestones and targets became less relevant as the crisis changed 
country and program priorities.  Thus, the CPS goal of enhancing the educational system and increasing the 
sensitivity of education to labour demand (Pillar 2C) is assessed to have been substantively achieved, albeit 
in a very narrow sense. Similarly, progress has been made towards the goal of increased private investment, 
improved export competitiveness, and a deeper and broader ﬁ nancial sector (Pillar 1B), but major legislation 
to modernize the investment climate was passed only in late 2010 and in early 2011. As there is neither new 
Public Private Partnership (PPP) nor bankruptcy legislation, the achievement of milestones was slower than 
anticipated, and the overall goals in this pillar are assessed to have been partially achieved.  At the same time, 
WBG support has contributed to the achievement of additional outcomes, beyond those originally envisaged 
in the CPS. These are outlined above.

45 REGE-DPL focused on the transition from managing the impact of the global crisis to ﬁ scal consolidation and shared growth and contributed 
to the following objectives: (1) economic management; (2) public ﬁ nancial management; (3) affordable universal healthcare and improved 
educational access; (4) employment; (5) improved investment climate; and (6) increased ﬁ nancial intermediation, especially to SMEs.
46 The WBG’s Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) rated the outcomes of two export ﬁ nance loans (EFIL II & III) as highly satisfactory.
47 The scale of WBG ﬁ nancing, averaging USD 1.9 billion in new commitments and USD 1.71 billion in disbursements during FY08-11, was very 
small when compared with Turkey’s total public debt, which was USD 321,4 billion in 2010, and it amounted to 23 percent of Turkey’s average 
public external borrowing (USD 8.43 billion between 2007-2010) and less than 1 percent of its average total gross external debt per year [USD 266 
billion] between 2007-2009.

CPS Implementation

38. 
IBRD’s portfolio is large, focused and considerably improved. Disbursement rates steadily increased, 
rising from 20 percent in FY08 to 31 percent in 2011.  With a realism rate of 94 percent, which stood at virtually 
100 percent over the majority of the CPS period, and proactive portfolio management (67 percent), only one 
problem project remained at end FY11 (compared to 3 at end-FY10 and 4 in mid-FY11). The one problem 
project was the Istanbul Municipal Infrastructure Project (Loan No. 4866-TU), which was cancelled at the 
borrower’s request in July 2011.

39. 
IFC ﬁ nancing during FY08-11 was spread across 45 projects with USD 2 billion in commitments, 
compared to USD 1.55 billion over 35 projects during FY04-07. IFC also mobilized USD 1.73 billion through 
private ﬁ nancial institutions to assist the private sector. Targeted areas included exporters, MSMEs, renewable 
energy, energy efﬁ ciency, cleaner production and energy security, health, infrastructure, trade ﬁ nance and 
support for Turkish companies investing in the region and beyond.

40. 
Implementation of an extensive program of analytic and advisory (AAA) services, focused on 
Turkey’s key policy and reform priorities, was central to the success of the CPS.  IBRD’s AAA program 
featured 52 major knowledge products, many prepared jointly with the Government and in collaboration 
with academia, UN institutions, and other development partners.  Topics ranged from public ﬁ nancial 
management, informality, and savings to energy sector reform and regulation, food safety, and watershed 
management, to education quality, female employment and gender certiﬁ cation, and the (in)equality of 
opportunities, to the investment climate, competition and business regulation, and corporate bond market 
development.  The program also included focused “just in time” analyses of draft legislation and reform 
options and policy notes for the incoming Governments in August 2007 and June 2011.  Turkish counterparts’ 
persistent strong demand for these knowledge services is testimony to their value-added, which is rooted 
in their demand driven selection and design, their collaborative preparation, the extensive engagement on 
ﬁ ndings and conclusions with a broad range of stakeholders, and the increasing use of results frameworks for 
knowledge activities. 

41. 
Good relations with civil society. Civil society participated in the preparation and implementation of 
projects, including HTP and ISMEP. The WBG works with academia, think tanks, private sector associations 
and businesses, as well as a wide range of non-governmental organizations including TUSIAD (Turkish 
Industry and Business Association) and KAGIDER (Women Entrepreneur’s Association of Turkey). The WBG 
played a convening role: working with Parliament; supporting the World Water Forum; and holding its 2009 
Annual Meetings in Istanbul. A speciﬁ c example of the WBG’s convening power is the human development 
policy dialogue carried out jointly with the Middle East Technical University, Ankara University, Sabanci 
University, and UNDP.  In preparing this CPSCR, the WBG met with civil society organizations to gauge 
opinions of work carried out during the CPS period and seek inputs to the report.

42. 
Strong partnership with development partners. The WBG works closely with the International 
Monetary Fund (IMF) on macroeconomic issues, sharing expertise on pension, energy sector, and a broad 
range of other structural issues. It maintains a close relationship with the EU, UNDP and UNICEF in Ankara. 
Of particular note was the success of the WBG private sector team (ECSPF) in mobilizing £100,000 from the 
UK Foreign and Commonwealth Ofﬁ ce to fund a pilot project to simplify administrative procedures, a ﬁ rst 
for the WBG in Turkey. IFC increased its cooperation with other IFIs in Turkey. Work included a country 
engagement plan with EBRD on the Clean Technology Fund; syndicating a ﬁ rst loan with Black Sea Trade 
and Development Bank, based on IFC’s Master Cooperation Agreement; coordinating with FMO to jointly 
sign a subordinated loan to a client bank; and cooperation in two projects with KfW on energy efﬁ ciency and 
MSME ﬁ nancing.

Annex 3

43. 
The 2011 Country Survey presented a broad range of opinions of the work of the WBG. With a 
32 percent response rate, respondents identiﬁ ed education (skills), environment and natural resource 
management, employment, energy, and disaster preparedness as key development priorities for the WBG’s 
partnership with Turkey.  This choice is broadly consistent with the CPS and the analysis in this CPSCR.  Sector 
priorities were as follows: rural development, increased job opportunities in the formal sector, enhancing 
opportunities for private sector growth/investment, access to pre-school education, and macroeconomic 
growth. With the exception of rural development, these largely mirror work carried out in this CPS.  Less 
positively, respondents noted the slowness and complexity of processes as the WBG’s greatest weaknesses 
in Turkey and identiﬁ ed interaction with stakeholders outside Government as a key area for improvement.  
Respondents also perceived WBG work as not being particularly effective in reducing poverty. 

V. KEY LESSONS LEARNED & RECOMMENDATIONS FOR MOVING FORWARD

44. 
The systematic development and maintenance of a policy dialogue in support of long-term 
strategic goals, combining knowledge and lending operations, is vital to support reforms. Major policy 
and legislative reforms can take time to implement; therefore ﬂ exibility and patience are critical for ensuring 
success. Successful collaboration on the Commercial Code (seven years in preparation) is an example of the 
value of long-term engagement. To increase success, the full integration of combined analytic work and policy 
ﬁ nancing into national development plans and medium-term programs is critical. Programmatic structuring 
of work, in the form of modular interventions which build on each other sequentially, was particularly 
effective.

45. 
The story of engagement on environment and climate change: step back, identify strategic entry 
points and seize opportunities that open as country priorities evolve. Turkey and the WBG agreed not to use 
environment as a pillar in CPS FY08-11, reﬂ ecting limited advancement of the environmental agenda during 
2004-2007 and a decision to consider jointly a possible re-engagement, at Turkey’s initiative, later during the 
2008-11 CPS period. Turkey’s accession to the Kyoto protocol and the opening of the Environmental Chapter 
of the EU Acquis in 2009 then provided the opportunity and strategic entry point for a new engagement 
on environment and climate change. The new engagement grew out of the Turkey-WBG partnership on 
energy. The electricity DPL series was broadened into the ESES DPL series, with three components: energy, 
climate change and environmental sustainability. This work led to collaboration in preparation for the 2012 
UN Sustainable Development Conference (Rio+20). IFC used its support for Turkey’s liberalization program 
to secure low carbon solutions to meet growing electricity demand. 

46. 
A strengthened focus on M&E and results has been welcome and useful. Turkey and the WBG 
have collaborated in strengthening monitoring and evaluation and the results focus of government and WBG 
supported programs - through the rolling programmatic JPPR, technical assistance on M&E ﬁ nanced by the 
IDF and many other task speciﬁ c M&E activities. A special effort was made to include results frameworks in 
all AAA activities. One joint example of M&E and a strong results focus is the work on vocational training 
with ISKUR. 

47. 
Sharing success. A number of Turkey’s policies and reforms, conducted in partnership with the WBG, 
are leading examples of work in their ﬁ elds. These include: (1) the Health Transformation Program; (2) energy 
market development, and (3) disaster risk management. This experience provides a basis for further Turkey-
WBG collaboration during the next, FY12-15, CPS in knowledge sharing and contributing to development 
with other countries, regionally and globally.
