FY14-FY17 COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY 

I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

1. 
This is a joint World Bank and International Finance Corporation (IFC) Country 
Partnership Strategy (CPS) for Belarus.  This joint CPS is based on: 1) an analysis of 
Belarus’s key development challenges informed by our recent economic and sector work, 2) 
alignment with the country’s development priorities and commitments, 3) examination of the 
World Bank Group’s track record and lessons learned in implementing support programs in the 
country, and 4) extensive consultation with and feedbacks from key stakeholders including 
government agencies, local authorities, civil society organizations, development partners and 
representatives of beneficiaries of our past and on-going support programs.  
2. 
Up until 2008 Belarus was a strong economic performer, with an average economic 
growth rate of 8.1 percent during 2001–2008.  Growth was propelled by a combination of 
favorable external factors, including strong export demand by key trading partners, especially 
Russia, underpriced energy imports from Russia and favorable terms of trade for key export 
goods.  Combined with public sector wage increases, this high growth rate resulted in a reduction 
of absolute poverty from 30 percent in 2002 to 5 percent in 2009 and 2010.  Poverty slightly 
increased to 7 percent in 2011, as a result of declining real incomes in the context of high 
inflation in 2011, but declined to 4.6 percent in 2012.  Some progress has also been made in 
reducing the role of the state in the economy.  For example, the general governmental 
expenditures were reduced from 46 percent of GDP in 2004 to 40 percent of GDP in 2012, while 
the share of the private sector in GDP increased from 25 percent in 2004 to 30 percent in 2010 1.  
However, overall structural reforms remain slow and piecemeal and Belarus continues to rely on 
a largely unreformed economic model based on the dominance of the state-owned sector and 
implied “social contract” of broad-based income distribution and high level of equity.   
3. 
The strong economic and social progress came to a halt in 2009, with the current 
account deficit widening to over 12 percent of GDP, as the global financial crisis led to 
reduced access to external borrowing and a sharp decline in exports, and price of gas 
imports from Russia increased. In response, the government tightened macroeconomic policy 
and devalued the Belarusian Rubel (BYR) by 30 percent, supported by financial assistance from 
Russia and the International Monetary Fund (IMF).  Initial stabilization gains were reversed, 
however, after completion of the IMF Stand-By Arrangement (IMF SBA) in March 2010.  
Expansionary fiscal and monetary policies, including rapid credit and wage growth, led to a 
widening in the current account deficit and intensified pressure on international reserves.  After a 
significant loss of reserves at the beginning of 2011, confidence in the BYR collapsed, sparking 
a foreign exchange crisis.  By December 2011, the BYR had lost about 70 percent of its value to 
the US Dollar and inflation soared to 109 percent.  However, by early 2013, the authorities 
managed to restore macroeconomic stability by tightening monetary and fiscal policies, while a 
new favorable energy trade agreement with Russia helped to improve trade balance and, 
consequently, ease pressure on the current account.   
4. 
Significant risks remain, especially given the large external debt financing needs.  
Risks stemming from any loosening of fiscal and monetary policy are exacerbated by the 
significant external refinancing needs Belarus will face in the next four years.  This reinforces 

1Belarus Public Expenditure Review, 2012; EBRD Transition Reports

the continued need for tight macroeconomic policies and containment of the current account 
deficit, especially given persistently low foreign exchange reserves. 
5. 
In addition to exposing existing macroeconomic vulnerabilities, the economic crises 
reinforced the need for structural reforms to regain competitiveness and diversify and 
modernize Belarus’s economy.  In recent years, Belarus’s growth model has relied primarily on 
a combination of external borrowing and cheap energy inputs, while productivity growth has 
slowed down and has been outpaced by real wage growth.  Moreover, Russia’s accession to the 
World Trade Organization (WTO) will increase competition for Belarusian products on the 
Russian market.  For Belarus to achieve further growth and social development, it needs to create 
an environment that allows its enterprises to dynamically adapt to the demands of an increasingly 
competitive global economy.  Achieving this while preserving social outcomes will require 
tackling several complex challenges. 
6. 
Comprehensive structural reforms will be critical to regaining competitiveness, 
maintaining macroeconomic stability and sustaining growth.  In the future, Belarus’s growth 
will have to rely on significant productivity gains driven by structural reforms.  Such reforms are 
needed to invigorate key engines of growth, primarily the private sector, attract Foreign Direct 
Investment (FDI) and technology, and reduce the footprint of the state-run segments of the 
economy.  Labor and capital need to be reallocated to high-productivity segments, the state-
owned enterprise (SOE) sector needs to be restructured, and reforms implemented to support the 
private sector.  Further integration into the global economy and diversification of exports, 
especially of non-energy exports, would also contribute to improved economic resilience.  
Belarus’s intention to join the WTO offers an important opportunity in this respect and will also 
reinforce the impetus for liberalization across several sectors in the economy, including services.  
Finally, building on the fiscal consolidation effort of the past years, further efforts are needed to 
reduce inefficient subsidies, whilst addressing spending pressure from an aging population, and 
to enhance efficiency of spending. 
7. 
Growth sustainability is also constrained by deteriorating infrastructure, inefficient 
use of energy, and significant unrealized economic potential of the country’s natural 
resources, particularly forestry.  Despite remarkable progress in reducing energy intensity, 
which fell from 0.69 tons of oil equivalent per thousand of 2005 dollar of GDP (PPP) in 1990 to 
about 0.23 in 2010, Belarus is still lagging behind Organization for Economic Cooperation and 
Development (OECD) countries.  There is a need for more sustainable use of domestically 
available fuels, including renewables, and greater diversification, as currently about 95 percent 
of Belarus’s power is produced from gas imported from Russia.  This is especially important as 
the effective subsidy on imported gas has been declining.  Finally, there is a need for more 
effective use of agricultural, forest and other environmental resources – forests and arable land 
together constitute only 9 percent of value added in the economy, despite accounting for 70 
percent of the country’s land area.  
8. 
Social service delivery systems, while providing widely accessible and affordable 
social protection, health and education services, are costly and inefficient.  Belarus has a 
very low share of targeted, means-tested programs, and it does not provide adequate 
unemployment insurance.  It is therefore ill-prepared to mitigate the social impact of structural 
reforms.  Life expectancy remains nine years below the Western European average, largely due 
to high adult mortality, especially among men (whose life expectancy is 12 years less than in 
Belarus’s European neighbors).  The education system has performed well in terms of access and 
enrollment, but much needs to be done to improve spending efficiency in the sector.  Education 
and labor skills mismatch is increasingly becoming an issue. 

v 

9. 
Responding to the above development challenges, the World Bank Group (WBG) 
strategy will support three areas of reforms to improve: (1) competitiveness of the economy 
by supporting structural reforms, including reducing the role of the state, transforming the SOE 
sector, promoting private and financial sector development and integration into the global 
economy; (2) quality and efficiency of public infrastructure services, use of agricultural and 
forestry resources and global benefits of public goods; and (3) human development outcomes 
through better education, health and social services. 
10. 
The WBG’s program in Belarus will be calibrated according to the depth, breath 
and speed of structural reforms. The program will include Analytical and Advisory Activities 
(AAA), investment lending by the World Bank and investments in the private sector by the IFC.  
Accordingly, the AAA and lending programs have been identified only for the first two years of 
the CPS.  Should structural reforms accelerate, lending scope and instruments could be revisited 
at mid-term of the CPS period. 
11. 
The WBG’s AAA program will be critical in creating consensus in important policy 
areas and building capacity in the country.  It will focus on advice in key policy areas such as 
structural reforms, trade, fiscal, PFM, private and financial sector development, education and 
municipal services.  The World Bank’s investment lending will focus on sectors with an 
adequate and improving policy framework, a sufficient knowledge base, a solid implementation 
track record and demonstrated Government commitment, direct benefits to ordinary citizens 
and/or global public goods benefits.  
12. 
The IFC will support private sector development and energy efficiency 
improvements through a combination of investments and advisory work.  The IFC program 
in Belarus will support: (i) trade development in critical sectors such as agriculture, with 
strategic focus on small and medium-sized exporters and importers, (ii) micro, small, and 
medium-sized enterprises’ (MSMEs) access to finance, (iii) investments into energy efficiency 
improvements, and (iv) advisory work on regulatory simplification, including in agriculture and 
forestry. Agriculture and forestry will remain priority sectors, with support directed at 
improvements in agricultural output and efficiency, access to finance, regulatory environment, 
and food safety.  
13. 
The WBG will continue using donor Trust Fund (TF) resources strategically to 
support the core objectives of the CPS. The WBG will use its AAA to engage other 
development partners in supporting the country’s reform program and seek partnerships with 
donors to leverage funds for programmatic technical assistance and advisory services. 
14. 
All areas of engagement will benefit from an increased focus on governance and 
social accountability.  Engagement on governance issues through policy dialogue will continue 
on the most crucial reform issues, including public finance and fiscal governance reforms and 
dialogue on transition to a new growth model.  The demand-side governance engagement will 
focus on participatory monitoring of service delivery outcomes, encouraging accountability to 
the beneficiaries through transparency and empowerment.   
15. 
The WBG will apply a gender lens in its AAA and lending operations aiming to 
identify gender disparities and suggest possible ways of addressing them through WBG 
supported activities.  Building on the current WBG program, possible focus areas could include 
equal participation of women in the labor force and entrepreneurship, reduced male mortality 
rates linked to non-communicable diseases and hazardous lifestyles, sustainability of the pension 
and healthcare systems, and higher impact of social services. 
16. 
Risks to the CPS remain high due to a historically mixed track record of reform 
implementation in the past.  The proposed calibrated engagement will mitigate this risk by 

vi 

designing and adjusting the WBG’s assistance according to the strength of the government’s 
commitment and reform progress.  Also, the WBG will continue to engage in dialogue with the 
Government in important policy reform areas. 
17. One major risk is the reemergence of price and exchange rate instability.  Belarus 
has only recently emerged from the severe crisis of 2011, when unsustainable policies pushed the 
economy into an inflation-depreciation spiral.  Since mid-2011 stabilization measures have been 
in place, restoring foreign exchange markets and reducing inflation and the current account 
deficit.  However, premature policy loosening in 2012 has led to the reemergence of price and 
exchange rate pressures, posing renewed risk to an already-weak reserve position.  Accordingly, 
the WBG will carefully monitor emerging economic and fiscal developments.  While the IMF 
will take the lead on macroeconomic issues, the WBG’s dialogue on public expenditures and 
budget management would be intensified and re-oriented, should economic instability reemerge. 
18. 
The CPS has been developed through extensive consultations with key stakeholders 
including the authorities, business associations, civil society, development partners, and 
beneficiaries of WBG-supported programs.  A wide range of perspectives on Belarus’s 
development priorities, challenges, and opportunities in such areas as economic competitiveness, 
human development, infrastructure services, global public goods, governance and gender were 
received and taken on board.  As proposed by civil society partners, instruments will be 
developed to engage beneficiaries and civil society in monitoring the provision of services in 
projects supported by the WBG, thus contributing to improving results and enhancing dialogue 
with the authorities and service providers on the needs of beneficiaries.

II. COUNTRY CONTEXT AND DEVELOPMENT AGENDA 
Social and Political Context 

19. 
Belarus is an upper middle income country with a population of 9.5 million, similar 
in size to many Central and Eastern European countries, with a fast declining and aging 
population.  In the past ten years the population fell by over 400,000 and the number of citizens 
above the age of 60 is projected to increase by 14 percent in the next decade alone. 2  Although 
Belarus has already achieved almost all of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), 
continued efforts are needed to enhance progress in combating HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis, 
ensure environmental sustainability, develop a global partnership for development, and boost 
shared prosperity. 3 
20. While the role of the state has been gradually reduced, Belarus continues to 
preserve a largely unreformed economic model based on the dominance of public sector 
and a “social contract” of broad-based income redistribution and a high level of social 
equity.  The country has highly centralized decision-making and relatively strong administrative 
capacity.  Public trust in public institutions such as the government, the parliament, and the 
presidency is higher than in most countries of the region 4 .  Although global and regional 
pressures and country-specific economic challenges have led to some liberalization of the 
business climate and optimization of social programs, the potential short-term social costs of 
reforms have limited the speed of reform.  
21. 
Relations with the European Union (EU) and the United States remain strained on 
account of these actors’ concerns regarding political rights, following the controversial 
2010 Presidential election.  Belarus is a member of the multilateral track of the six-country 
Eastern Partnership Community that aims to foster cooperation with the EU, and among the 
partner states themselves. In 2012, the EU designed and launched the European Dialogue for 
Belarus Modernization, a multi-stakeholder exchange of views and ideas between the EU and a 
variety of stakeholders in Belarus.   
22. 
Belarus enjoys economic and geo-political support from its Eastern neighbors.  The 
Common Economic Space of Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan, which allows free movement of 
capital, goods, services and labor, was launched in January 2012.  An agreement on establishing 
a Eurasian Economic Union could be signed as early as in 2015.  Belarus also receives 
significant Anti-Crisis Fund support (USD 3 billion over 2011-2013) from the Eurasian 
Development Bank (EDB).  

Recent Economic Developments 

23. 
Up until 2008, Belarus was a strong economic performer in a fast-growing region. 
During 2000–08, the country’s GDP grew on average by 8.1 percent annually, more rapidly than 
the averages for both the Europe and Central Asia (ECA) region (5.7 percent) and the 
Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) (7.1 percent).  During that period, per capita income 
more than doubled in real terms, reaching USD 5,820 in 20115.  Rapid economic growth was 
propelled by a combination of favorable external factors.  These included strong export demand 
by key trading partners (CIS, especially Russia), underpriced energy imports from Russia and 
large terms of trade gains stemming from exporting goods such as oil products and fertilizers, 
which saw steep price increases, especially in the years prior to the global economic crisis.  But 
the strong growth record was associated with growing macroeconomic vulnerabilities.  External

started to gradually move towards market-based pricing of its energy exports to Belarus.

24. Growth slowed substantially during the global economic crisis of 2008-09, and since 
then the country has gone through a period of recurring macroeconomic instability.  The 
2008 global economic crisis was transmitted to Belarus primarily through lower export demand 
and reduced access to external borrowing.  Growth dropped to 0.2 percent in 2009.  The 
government’s initial macroeconomic policy response in 2009 involved an external adjustment 
through tight macroeconomic policy and a one-off adjustment of the exchange rate, supported by 
external financing, including from the IMF.  However, initial stabilization gains, achieved in 
2009, were reversed by expansionary fiscal and monetary policies, including fast credit 
expansion under government-directed lending programs, which fuelled a rapid, but short-lived 
economic recovery in 2010.  This recovery came at the expense of further deterioration of the 
current account deficit to 15 percent of GDP in 2010, heightened pressure on the exchange rate 
and foreign exchange reserves, which eventually led to loss of control of the exchange rate and 
sharply accelerating inflation during 2011.  After a period of multiple exchanges rates, the BYR 
lost close to 70 percent of its value vis-à-vis the USD and inflation soared to 108.7 percent in 
December 2011. 
25. 
As of early 2013, macroeconomic stability remains fragile.  Tight monetary and fiscal 
policy, especially during the first half of the year helped to contain Consumer Price Index (CPI) 
inflation, which was subdued to 21.8 percent (eop) in 2012, compared to 108.7 percent (eop) in 
2011.  The foreign exchange market has stabilized after a sharp devaluation in 2011.  The 
devaluation, together with significant terms of trade gains related to a new favorable energy trade 
agreement with Russia, helped to improve the trade balance from a deficit of 2.0 percent of GDP 
in 2011 to a surplus of 4.6 percent of GDP in 2012.  This in turn eased pressure on the current 
account deficit, which narrowed further from 8.5 percent of GDP at the end of 2011 to 2.8

26. However, significant risks remain, especially given large external debt refinancing 
needs over the coming four years. Imbalances could reemerge if there is renewed fiscal and 
monetary expansion.  With consumer price inflation in Belarus remaining above the level of 
most trading partners, real exchange appreciation is already eroding the competitiveness gained 
from the devaluation. In addition, the country faces significant external refinancing needs.  
Belarus has largely relied on external debt to finance its current account deficit with limited FDI. 
Gross external debt to GDP ratio increased 2.5 times over 2009–11, exceeding 62 percent of 
GDP, while public debt more than doubled in relation to GDP within the same period to 30.7 
percent at the end of 2012.  The maturity structure of private corporate and banking sector 
external debt is heavily weighted on the short term (around 45 percent).  Belarus will also need 
to refinance a significant part of its public external debt in the coming three years, including 
repayments of IMF loans and Eurobonds.  This will add significantly to the country’s gross 
financing needs and put additional strain on the balance of payments, reinforcing the continued 
need for tight macroeconomic policies and containment of current account deficit, especially in 
the context of persistently low foreign exchange reserves. 
27. Moreover, the macroeconomic crises of the past few years have revealed deep 
structural constraints in Belarus’s state-dominated economic growth model.  Past growth 
was significantly assisted by a combination of favorable external factors, including cheap energy 
imports from Russia, strong export demand by key trading partners, especially Russia, and 
favorable terms of trade for key export goods.  These (temporarily) positive factors have partly 
offset the negative impact of state interference in resource allocation and economic management, 
which has resulted in stagnating productivity and eroding competitiveness. 6  State interference 
has left a large proportion of productive resources locked in an inefficient SOE sector, and has

restricted private sector development, particularly of the Small and Medium-Size Enterprises 
(SMEs) and service sector, which are crucial for employment growth.  Expansion of the private 
sector has also been hindered by a small and undiversified financial sector dominated by state-
owned banks and state lending programs. GDP growth has thus become increasingly dependent 
on domestic demand driven by expansionary monetary/fiscal policies, but at the expense of 
macroeconomic stability. 

Poverty Trends, Shared Prosperity and Gender 

28. 
Rapid economic growth has translated into remarkable poverty reduction over the 
past decade, despite a modest increase in poverty in the aftermath of the recent crisis.  The 
absolute poverty rate (national poverty line 7 ) declined from 30 percent in 2002 to about 11 
percent in 2006, and more than halved in recent years, falling from 11 percent in 2006 to 5 
percent in 2010.  The rapid decline in poverty was driven by fast GDP growth and increases in 
wages and real income.  The poverty rate increased slightly to 7 percent in 2011, largely as a 
result of price increases and declining real wages in the context of high inflation in 2011, and 
declined to 4.6percent in 2012.  This positive trend in poverty reduction is matched by Belarus’s 
high level of shared prosperity.  Growth in consumption for the poorest 40 percent of the 
population was not only higher than in other countries of the region, but also above national 
average growth in consumption, suggesting a positive trend in income equality between 2002 
and 2008.

data. 

29. However, absolute poverty in rural areas is twice as high as in urban areas, and 
large heterogeneity in poverty incidence is found among regions.  Although poverty declined 
in both rural and urban areas between 2006 and 2010, the rural poverty rate remained about 
twice as high as the urban rate throughout the period.  Similarly, both areas experienced an 
increase in absolute poverty in 2011, resulting in poverty rate of 11.5 percent in rural and 5.8 
percent in urban areas.  Further heterogeneity is found among regions.  In Brest, Vitebsk, Gomel 
and Mogilev, absolute poverty ranges between 9 and 10 percent, although the 2011 increase in 
poverty affected in particular Brest and Vitebsk.  Minsk and Grodno oblasts appeared less 

7 In 2013, the national poverty line in Belarus is set at around USD 107 per month.

vulnerable to the 2011 crisis: poverty levels remained almost stable at 2010 levels of around 6.2 
percent and 3.7 percent, respectively, despite the increasing trend in Minsk oblast in previous 
years.  
30. Moreover, households with children remain highly vulnerable to absolutely poverty, 
and poverty increased more among working-age men than women.  In 2011, the proportion 
of children aged 17 and below living in families with incomes below the poverty line was 12.3 
percent (11.9 percent in 2010).  Additionally, the deterioration in the poverty rate in 2011 
particularly affected men of working age:  6.2 percent of men over 18 (versus 5.3 percent of 
women) in Belarus are estimated to live in absolute poverty.  The gender gap in the poverty rate 
between men and women has been widening, possibly due to a higher level of economic activity 
among men, which results in higher vulnerability to changes in the economic environment. 
However, the gender gap is reversed in terms of relative poverty, due to women’s greater 
dependence on pensions and employment in lower-paid jobs. 
31. While Belarus follows principles of equality and non-discrimination in its policies 
and has a basic legal framework in place, gender equality appears to be given lower 
priority compared to other social issues, and gender gaps persist in the areas of human 
capital and economic opportunities.  Gender inequality affects primarily women on issues of 
employment and economic opportunities, although less than in most countries in the region.  In 
particular, women participate less than men in the labor market (in first quarter 2012, 62 percent, 
compared to men’s 69 percent and ECA average of about 51 percent).  Despite a higher 
educational level, women tend to earn on average about 26.3 percent less than men (2011), and 
the wage gap has been increasing over the past decade.  Women appear to be disproportionately 
represented in the public sector, and are less likely to be represented at the top levels in politics 
and public administration, or own business and manage firms.  On the positive side, according to 
the most recent Business Environment and Enterprise Performance Survey (BEEPS, 2008), 
participation of women in management is higher in Belarus than in ECA on average; women are, 
however, more likely to manage and own small enterprises rather than manage large firms.  
Despite the Government’s efforts, human trafficking and domestic violence still represent 
significant risks for women.  
32. Men are at a disadvantage compared to women in terms of life expectancy and 
enrollment in tertiary education. The gender gap in life expectancy at birth is a particular 
cause for concern (65 years for men and 77 years for women in 2011). This gap has been stable 
throughout the past decade and remains among the highest in ECA.  More details about gender 
issues in Belarus are provided in Annex 5. 

Economic Prospects and Risks 

33. 
Belarus enters this CPS period with fragile macroeconomic stability and in an 
external environment characterized by great uncertainty.  Over the short to medium term, 
Belarus’s economic prospects depend on consistent and stability-oriented macroeconomic 
policies to lower inflation, to rein in external imbalances, and to strengthen reserves, particularly 
given the looming external debt refinancing risks.  Consequently, structural reforms to address 
the lack of competitiveness and other structural constraints will need to be accelerated.   

34. 
Looking ahead, growth rates over the near to medium term are expected to remain 
far below the levels experienced prior to 2008, given external and domestic constraints.  
Growth is expected to accelerate to 2.5 percent during 2013, driven by an expansion of domestic 
demand.  The current account deficit is expected to widen to 4.7 percent of GDP in 2013, as 
external demand will remain subdued, putting renewed pressure on foreign reserves, especially 
in the context of large external refinancing needs over the coming 4 years, due to repayments of 
IMF loans and maturing external bonds.  On the fiscal side, while a balanced budget is expected, 

5 

slowing inflation together with rising expenditures is likely to lead to a return of small deficits 
during 2014 and 2015.

35. 
Domestically, more expansionary monetary and fiscal policies could boost growth, 
but would undermine macroeconomic stability.  While the authorities have stated continued 
stabilization as a primary objective for 2013 and going forward, official growth targets still aim 
for 8.5 percent GDP growth in 2013, which would be incompatible with this objective.  Attempts 
to achieve a growth target through more aggressive monetary and fiscal expansion could succeed 
in the short run, but would risk renewed destabilization, inducing a sharper – and hence more 
damaging – adjustment later on.  
36. 
These risks could be amplified by further deterioration in the external environment 
if demand for Belarusian exports were to worsen.  The high concentration of exports to the 
Russian market exposes Belarus to terms of trade and export demand risks.  A substantial 
deterioration of the external environment associated with a worsening of the Eurozone crisis 
could pass through to Belarus through declining commodity prices and its impact on external 
demand, especially in Russia.  A significantly lower growth path of the Russian economy would 
lead to a worsening of Belarus’s already precarious external position.  The situation could be 
further exacerbated, if Russia would again start to raise energy prices, reversing recent terms of 
trade gains, with detrimental impacts on Belarus trade and external position. 

Development Challenges and Opportunities 

37. 
Belarus has emerged from the macroeconomic crises of 2009 and 2011, but faces both 
formidable challenges and unique opportunities to build the foundation for sustained and 
shared prosperity.  The macroeconomic crises of the past years have reinforced the need for 
structural reforms to regain competitiveness, to diversify and modernize the country’s economic 
structure, and to create sustainable and productive jobs.  For Belarus to achieve further growth and 
social development, it needs to create an environment that allows its enterprises to dynamically 

6 

  
adapt to the demands of an increasingly competitive global economy.  Achieving this, while 
preserving social outcomes, will require tackling several complex and interrelated challenges. 8 

A. 

Creating a Competitive and Sustainable Growth Model 

38. 
Comprehensive structural reforms will be critical to maintain macroeconomic 
stability, improve competitiveness, sustain growth and job creation and boost shared 
prosperity for all citizens of Belarus.  Compared to most other transition economies, Belarus 
has pursued a very gradualist transition path.  Despite some initial structural reforms, the 
economy continues to be characterized by a large state presence. Belarus has preserved large 
state-owned and state-controlled enterprises.  The state-owned sector, which is supported by an 
extensive system of state support, still accounts for over half of output and two thirds of 
employment.  While this approach has helped Belarus avoid the social cost associated with 
economic restructuring, it has resulted in serious vulnerabilities, including stagnant productivity 
growth, loss of competitiveness and reliance on underpriced energy imports from Russia.

39. 
Belarus’s economy remains dependent on energy and resource intensive exports and 
underpriced energy imports from Russia: Belarus’s trade is concentrated in energy- and 
resource-intensive product categories. Imports of mineral products, including crude oil and 
natural gas account for 42 percent of the country’s total imports, while mineral exports, mainly 
of refined oil products account for about 36 percent of total exports (2011).  Belarus continues to 
import natural gas and crude oil from Russia at below world market prices.  The average annual 
Russian oil and gas subsidy for the period 2001–08 is estimated at 14.5 percent of Belarus’s 
GDP, but declined sharply during 2009–10, as a result of rising import prices and falling world 
commodity prices. While these underpriced energy imports have spurred economic growth, they 
expose the country to increased commodity price volatility and risks associated with the 
negotiation of energy trade agreements with Russia.  The increase in the import price of natural 
gas from USD47 per thousand cubic meters (TCM) in 2005 to USD263.5 per TCM in 2011 was 
associated with a sharp deterioration of Belarus’s energy trade balance, which in turn put 
pressure on the current account.  The most recent energy trade agreement concluded in late 2011 
and covering the period until 2014 reduced the gas import price for 2012 to USD165.6 per TCM, 
contributing positively to the external adjustment.

Figure 9: Real Wages Outpaced Labor 
Productivity Growth 

40. 
At the same time, productivity 
growth in non-energy sectors has been 
stagnating, especially in the state-owned 
sector.  Aggregate productivity growth has 
been on a declining trend since 2004 (Figure 
7).  While productivity growth contributed 
over one-half of GDP growth in 2000–04, it 
represented only 24 percent of overall growth 
in 2010.Moreover, SOEs not only tend to 
have lower levels of total factor productivity, 
but their productivity also increases at a 
slower pace than comparable private sector 
enterprises (Figure 8).  This implies that the 
productivity differences between state and 
private 
enterprises 
stem 
from 
the 
unproductive use of factors of production.  Rapid growth in real wages has outpaced labor 
productivity, creating cost pressures and undermining competitiveness.  These internal cost 
pressures are compounded by Russia’s WTO accession, which will intensify competition, not 
only in Belarus’s main export market for manufactured goods, but also domestically through 
commitments under the Customs Union. 
41. 
Despite improvements in the business climate, the private sector remains small 
relative to regional peers.  Given the dominance of SOEs, the private sector and especially 
SMEs remain marginalized.  Over the past several years, Belarus has made a deliberate effort to 
improve its business climate. The most recent World Bank/IFC Doing Business Indicators for 
2013 show marked achievements in the areas of business start-up and property registration, but 
persistent weaknesses remain in the area of regulatory environment for business operation as 
well as protection of property rights.  With eased regulatory requirements for entry, the number 
of new private firms increased by some 30 percent in 2007 and 2008, albeit from a very small 
base.  The rate of private firm growth decelerated considerably in 2009 and did not recover in 
2010 in the context of persistent macroeconomic uncertainty.  More importantly, these 
improvements related to business entry have not translated into significant private sector job 
creation.  
42. 
Relatively undiversified and costly financial intermediation is also a significant 
constraint to private sector investment and growth.  Commercial banks control 98 percent of 
total assets in the financial sector.  Corporate bond and equity markets, which have become a

major source of investment financing in many other middle-income economies, as well as non-
bank financial institutions, are at a nascent stage of development.  Moreover, the banking sector 
is dominated by state-owned banks.  While there are 31 licensed commercial banks, the two 
largest state-owned banks—Belarusbank and Belagroprombank—have a combined market share 
of about 70 percent of total assets. In addition, the Government exerts direct influence on credit 
allocation through government-directed programs, which channel funds toward the government’s 
priority sectors, projects, and individual companies at subsidized interest rates, often with 
explicit government guarantees.  The crowding out by government lending programs drives up 
the cost of funding for private firms, particularly in the aftermath of the latest crisis.  Recurrent 
macroeconomic instability also impedes financial inclusion, with only 19 percent of population 
currently using formal intermediaries for savings purposes.

43. While Belarus has achieved a significant contraction in the size of the government 
budget, the overall tax burden remains high.  Since 2008 – induced in part by the 
macroeconomic crises, Belarus has achieved a significant contraction in the size of 
Government. 9  The public expenditure to GDP ratio contracted by almost 14 percentage points 
over the past four years, to reach 36 percent of GDP at the end of 2011.  The composition of the 
adjustment largely reflects a contraction in discretionary spending.  Capital expenditures took the 
brunt of the adjustment, while government consumption contracted at a much slower pace.  
Despite this contraction, Belarus continues to have a high overall tax burden in regional 
comparison. Reflecting the social orientation of economic policies, public expenditures are 
dominated by social transfers, including pensions and social protection spending.  At the same 
time, the country also continues to have above average outlays for subsidies (about 5 percent of 
GDP in 2011), including in the agricultural sector. 
44. 
Securing macroeconomic stability is key to sustainable prosperity.  To curb 
overheating and avoid reigniting inflationary and exchange rate pressures, sound macroeconomic 
policy is critical.  The flexible exchange rate policy needs to be maintained; credit growth, 
especially lending under government programs (LGP) needs to be further curtailed; fiscal 
accounts need to remain balanced, as planned by the authorities; and income policies, especially 
real wage growth, need to be moderated in line with productivity growth. 
45. 
Coupled with stability-oriented macroeconomic management, deepened and 
accelerated structural reforms are required to regain competiveness and combat economic 
imbalances. This implies that growth will have to rely on significant productivity gains driven 
by structural reforms. Such reforms are needed to invigorate additional engines of growth (such 
as the private sector, including services), attract quality FDI and technology, and reduce footprint 
of the state-run segments of the economy.  Increasing Belarus’s competitiveness requires the 
reallocation of labor and capital to high productivity segments, restructuring of the SOE sector, 
and implementation of reforms to support the private sector.  In addition to accelerating 
privatization to bring strategic investment, both financially and in terms of production 
technologies, this will entail changes in the incentive structure of SOEs to ensure efficient 
employment of both capital and labor.  In parallel, moving towards a more diversified financial 
sector operating at market terms is essential for more efficient allocation of resources to the 
productive parts of the economy.  These reforms are especially urgent given the loss of 
competitiveness and a governance structure based on rigidly planned targets which do not reflect 
true economic scarcities, and low capacity to adapt to changes in demand and supply.  Further 
integration into the global economy and diversification of exports would also contribute to 
improved economic resilience.  Belarus’s intention to join the WTO offers an important 
opportunity in this respect and will also reinforce the impetus for liberalization across several 
sectors in the economy, including services.  Finally, building on the fiscal consolidation effort of 
the past years, further efforts are needed to reduce inefficient subsidies whilst addressing aging-
related spending pressure and enhancing the efficiency of spending in the social sectors, 
including health and education.  

9 The Belarus Programmatic Public Expenditure Review Volume 1 and 2 (2011 and 2012) provides an in-depth 
analysis of macro-fiscal policies and public spending in key sectors, including energy services, agriculture, social 
assistance, pensions, intergovernmental fiscal relations, education and health.

46. 
Long-term sustained growth in Belarus is constrained by deteriorating infrastructure, 
inefficient use of energy, and failure to realize the economic potential of the country’s natural 
resources. 
Public Infrastructure Services 
47. Growth, 
employment 
creation and poverty reduction 
in Belarus are all threatened by 
aging and sometimes poorly 
maintained infrastructure and 
inefficient use 
of natural 
resources. In the road sector in 
the 1990s and 2000s, the country 
was able to avoid large-scale 
deterioration of 
infrastructure 
assets that was common in most 
ex-Soviet countries by continuing 
to spend adequately on road 
maintenance, repair and upgrading.  However, in recent years expenditures on road maintenance 
(current and periodic) have decreased substantially, falling to unsustainable levels which are now 
resulting in worsening road conditions and further undermining Belarus’s competitiveness.  
48. 
In the water and wastewater sector, infrastructure development needs also remain 
very significant: 26 percent of the population is yet to be connected to sewerage services and 14 
percent to water services. Wastewater treatment, affected by obsolete equipment and technology, 
often fails to meet acceptable standards in terms of nutrients removal– water with excessive iron 
content is still supplied to more than 20 percent of Belarus population. Low operational 
efficiency coupled with user charges well below cost-recovery level puts a strain on public utility 
and communal budgets, which force local authorities to postpone important capital replacement 
and rehabilitation investments.  As a result, technical and economic efficiency has significantly 
deteriorated, with water losses in urban areas increasing from 15 percent to 25 percent in the last 
four years. Local authorities’ discretion in setting tariff levels is limited and deficits are generally 
covered by subsidies and transfers. It is estimated that these tariffs cover about half of the cost of 
waste collection and disposal and 85 percent of the cost of water and wastewater services, with 
the difference covered through cross subsidies from non-households and other transfers from 
Oblast budgets.  In addition, there is an urgent need to improve the system’s energy efficiency.   
Energy 
49. 
Energy is by far the most unsustainable element of the public sector in Belarus. 
Despite remarkable progress in reducing energy intensity, which fell from 0.69 tons of oil 
equivalent per thousand of 2005 dollar of GDP (PPP) in the 1990 to about 0.23 in 2010, Belarus 
is still lagging somewhat behind OECD countries. To reduce dependence on energy imports, 
there is a need for increased use of domestically available fuels, including renewables, and 
greater diversification of Belarus’s energy sector – currently about 95 percent of Belarus power 
is produced from gas imported from Russia.  Reforms of the utility sector, including tariff 
reforms are vital to achieving financial viability of the energy sector, especially as import prices 
may increase again in the future.  
50. 
The sector is characterized by a high degree of state ownership, strong vertical 
integration, administered tariffs, and cross-subsidization.  Residential tariffs are very low and 

11 

 
 
12 

do not reflect the cost of services.  While low residential tariffs have kept household 
expenditures on utility services in Belarus below 10 percent of household income much lower 
than in most countries in the region—they have undermined the financial viability and 
sustainability of the sector, especially with the uncertainties about level of subsidies on gas 
imports from Russia.  Significant financial losses incurred by utility companies are compensated 
through a complex, non-transparent system of direct subsidies and cross-subsidies between non-
residential and residential consumers as well as between energy services.  Taken together, the 
sector drains fiscal resources to the tune of about 2 percent of GDP annually.  
51. 
In response to rising energy costs, the Government plans to move to cost-reflective 
energy pricing by 2014 and generate fiscal savings in the range of 1–2.6 percent of GDP 
annually.  The required tariff increases to achieve these cost recovery targets are substantial. 
Residential heat tariffs would have to be increased by 112–256 percent by 2014, depending on 
import fuel prices.  With no real increases in residential tariffs, the estimated size of budgetary 
and cross-subsidies for 2011–14 would be in the range of 1.9–3.9 percent of GDP annually, 
depending on natural gas prices.

52. Opportunities to reduce energy intensity and net carbon emissions could derive 
from three sources: 
• infrastructure improvements that can reduce the carbon footprint of public services, 
including transport and water supply 
• continued improvements in energy efficiency that can reduce consumption of carbon 
fuels 
• efficient exploitation of Belarus’s extensive forest resources, which cover about 39 
percent of the land area, that can contribute to carbon absorption 
Natural Resources and Environmental Sustainability 
53. 
Natural resources also suffer from sub-optimal management. There is great potential 
for more effective use of agricultural, forest and other environmental resources.  This will require 
significant policy reform, including restructuring of agricultural policies and subsidies, which are 
currently accounting for over half of agricultural output.

Forestry 
54. 
Forests in Belarus cover nearly 39 percent of the territory, providing multiple 
environmental services, raw material to forest industry, employment, biomass for generation of 
heat and power and non-timber forest products for commercial production and subsistence 
consumption by local communities.  In 2011, the forestry sector contributed 1.2 percent of GDP 
(0.7 percent forest industry) and exports amounted to USD 1.2 billion. There is considerable 
domestic and international investment planned for the wood processing sector (USD 2.9 billion 
over the next 5 years).  Generally, Belarus forests are well stocked and growing (in both standing 
volume and area), and illegal harvesting is practically non-existent.  There is, however, room for 
improving management in use of forestry resources, better forest policy, legal, administrative 
and institutional reforms, including an up-to-date national forest policy and strategy, better forest 
legislation and law enforcement, and more efficient technologies for forest harvesting. 
Agriculture 
55. 
Agriculture is unreformed and underperforming, and is a burden on the state 
budget.  The sector contributes just about 8 percent to GDP, while absorbing as much as 5 
percent of GDP in the form of state support in subsidies and tax concessions.  Fiscal support to 
the agricultural sector, including tax concessions and budgetary expenditures, is substantial, 
accounting for 67 percent of agricultural GDP.  This extensive support has resulted in a largely 
unprofitable sector, with enterprises registering soaring levels of debts, often government-
guaranteed, resulting in further pressure for state support.  
56. 
Agricultural subsidies absorb the largest share of spending, while expenditures on 
non-distorting public goods are limited.  Subsidies have increased as a result of growing input 
prices and growing expenditures on interest subsides and called guarantees for directed lending 
activities in the sector.  Capital expenditures are down from a peak of almost 11 percent of total 
agricultural spending to 5 percent in 2009-10.  Using the WTO classification of agricultural 
support, amber box measures (market- and trade-distorting state support) account for the largest 
chunk of spending, while the share of market-neutral green box measures remains low. 
57. 
Agricultural policy aims to support producers and protect consumers by keeping 
food prices low, but current policies distort incentives and undermine financial viability of 
the sector.  Farm production costs have risen quickly as a result of increased prices for fertilizers 
and other farm inputs, while price controls and artificially low farm gate prices have depressed 
farm revenues.  Productivity of labor and capital in agriculture is much lower than in other 
sectors of the economy and about 6.9 percent of Belarus’s farms are unprofitable enterprises. 
Continuous state support and soft loans have avoided the needed restructuring of non-viable 
enterprises and contributed to poor and declining farm performance. 

C. 

ImprovingHuman Development Outcomes 

58. 
Reflecting Belarus’s socially oriented economic policies, social sector spending, 
including social protection, education and health, accounts for about half of government 
expenditures.  However, while the current social protection system provides a wide range of 
benefits, Belarus has a very low share of targeted, means-tested programs.  More importantly, the 
system does not currently provide for adequate unemployment insurance and is therefore ill-
prepared to mitigate social impact of structural reforms and to cope with demands of a more 
dynamic labor market.  Moreover, the public service delivery system, while providing widely 
accessible and affordable health and education services, is constrained by the lack of incentives 
to improve efficiency and quality due to input and historical-expenditure-based financing 
mechanisms. 

13 

14 

59. 
The social sectors suffer from high levels of expenditure but relatively poor 
outcomes.  Life expectancy – while slowly recovering – remains 9 years below West European 
average, largely due to high adult mortality, especially among men (whose life expectancy is 12 
years less than their European neighbors).  Belarus is characterized by extremely high mortality 
rates among adults, vast majority of which is due to non-communicable diseases (in particular 
cardio-vascular diseases, which are now the main cause of mortality and the key reason for low 
life expectancy) and injuries. 
Education 
60. 
Belarus’s education system has performed well 
in 
improving access and 
enrollments.  Gross enrollment ratio in primary education remains high at 100 percent since 
2000 while gross enrollment ratio in general secondary education was at105 percent by 2011. 
Demand for tertiary education has increased over the last decade leading to a 1.7 times increase 
in the number of students per 10,000 population between 2000 and 2011.Belarus ranks high in 
terms of the Human Development Index (HDI) (50th out of 187 countries in 2012), largely thanks 
to the achievements in education.  Household spending on education is moderate by regional 
standards, suggesting broad affordability of education. 
61. While 
public 
expenditures on edu-
cation are in line with 
the regional average, 
the focus needs to be 
on increasing efficiency 
of spending, especially 
in view of declining 
student 
population.   
Student-teacher ratios at 
both 
primary 
and 
secondary 
level 
in 
Belarus are among the 
lowest in ECA.  At the 
same 
time, 
teacher 
salaries remain relatively 
low, making it difficult 
to attract and 
retain 
skilled staff in the teaching force.  Belarus could save about 11 percent of the education budget 
(0.6 percent of GDP) if its student-teacher ratio were to rise to the OECD average – it is 
currently the second lowest in the CIS.  While per-student cost has been increasing, this has not 
necessarily led to better learning outcomes.  Yet, the current system of education financing 
provides little incentive to sub-national governments to allocate resources in an efficient manner. 
Instead, existing financing arrangements which focus on inputs encourage schools and local 
governments to retain large numbers of staff and maintain excess facilities. 
62. 
Education is becoming outdated– larger number of businesses in Belarus than in most 
ECA countries report shortages of skilled labor as the main constraint to business (although such 
reported shortages are also linked to broader issues in terms of labor market functioning).   
Health 
63. 
The health system has delivered effectively on a range of indicators, including infant 
and maternal health and containment of communicable diseases, including HIV and TB. 
However, life expectancy – while starting to recover over last two years– remains below pre-

transition levels largely due to high adult mortality, especially among men. Belarus lags behind 
on prevention of non-communicable diseases (NCDs), in particular of cardio-vascular diseases, 
which are now the main cause of mortality and key reason for low life expectancy. 
64. 
Public health spending, 
Figure 17: Number of Hospital Beds per 1,000 
financed 
from 
the general 
Population 
budget, accounts for 3.5 percent 
of GDP, above the CIS average of 
2.7 percent, and in line with other 
middle income countries in ECA, 
but sharply below 
the OECD 
average of 6.8 percent. While 
level of public health spending 
seems broadly commensurate with 
Belarus’s level of income, there 
are signs of operational and 
allocation 
inefficiencies. 
 The 
health care system is characterized 
by an expansive delivery structure 
with a focus on hospital-based 
services.  For its population size, 
Belarus has a large number of 
hospitals, hospital beds, doctors, 
nurses and other personnel, but they do not translate into good health outcomes by regional 
standards. Significant savings could be made if Belarus reduced its number of hospital beds and 
strengthened its preventive and primary care services. 
65. Moreover, there are large discrepancies in internal efficiency of hospitals, with 
significant variation in average length of stay and unit costs for similar treatments across the 
country.  These problems are a result of the current, largely input-based financing arrangement 
that encourages health care providers to use more staff, beds and other inputs to justify their 
budgets and does not provide any incentive to improve productivity, quality of care or health 
outcomes.

Social Assistance 
66. 
Belarus operates one of the most 
extensive social assistance systems in the 
region, with total spending equal to 2.7 
percent of GDP and reaching about half of 
the population.  This substantial resource 
commitment has contributed to low levels of 
poverty and to low inequality in the country.  
However, the current system uses significant 
fiscal 
resources and 
in a 
tight 
fiscal 
environment, pressure 
to contain 
social 
assistance spending remains acute.  At the 
same time, robust social safety nets are needed 
to preserve the significant gains in social 
development 
that Belarus has achieved, 
especially in view of a possibly protracted 
economic recovery and structural reforms that 
are likely to hurt the most vulnerable.  Faced 
with these simultaneous challenges, the need to 
realize efficiency gains is urgent. 
 More 
generally, an aging population presents 
significant economic and social challenges: a 
shrinking labor force, an unsustainable pension 
system, and broad implications for health, education and productivity.

Government Priorities and Medium-Term Strategy 

67. 
The Government identifies the country’s development challenges and constraints to 
sustainable economic growth as: (i) inadequate economic efficiency caused by the dominance 
of high import, resource and energy intensive industries  and low labor productivity leading to 
low competitiveness of domestic production;  (ii) reduced investment efficiency and slow growth 
of FDI; (iii) lagging innovations; (iv) small GDP share of SMEs (21 percent) which is much 
lower than in European countries; (v) high dependence on energy imports and high energy GDP 
intensity; (vi) low incentives for productive labor and low efficiency of agriculture; (vii) low 
financial efficiency and missing resources for modernization in the real sector; and (viii) lack of 
adequate institutional infrastructure to facilitate public/private interface (property rights, efficient 
rules, financial intermediation). 
68. 
The Program of Social and Economic Development for 2011-2015, together with 
Plan of Government’s Activities for 2011-2015,  sets an objective to increase prosperity and 
improve living conditions of the population on the basis of modernization of economic 
relations, innovative development and increased competitiveness of the economy.  It sets bold 
targets for 2015 vis-à-vis 2010 and calls for ambitious reforms in the following priority areas: (i) 
human development, including quality of health and education (increase life expectancy to 72-73 
years and ensure Belarus is in top-50 countries in Human Development Index); (ii) economic 
modernization and high-tech development (the share of exports of high-tech goods should 
account for 12-14 percent in total exports of goods and services); (iii) entrepreneurship and 
business initiative and FDI (the share of SMEs should go up to 30 percent of GDP);(iv) exports 
of goods and services, and foreign trade (exports of goods and services should grow by 2.2 times 
and current account surplus should amount to at least 0.5-0.6 percent of GDP); (v) sustainable 
regional development; 
(vi) accessible housing; and 
(vii) efficient agriculture and 

16 

forestry(agricultural output should grow by 1.39-1.45 times and share of mature forests should 
increase to 11-12 percent of forest stock). 
69. 
Implementation of the above goals is further defined with specific actions: 
• Plan for the Implementation of President’s Directive #4 (Resolution #251/6 of the 
Council of Ministers and the National Bank dated 28 February 2011) contains actions and 
targets on structural reforms such as strengthening competition, improving the business 
climate, removing red tape, strengthening the tax system and moving to international 
financial reporting standards.  
• The Joint Plan of Action of the Council of Ministers and the National Bank (Resolution 
#1150/17 of the Council of Ministers and the National Bank dated 13 December 2012) 
seeks to meet the targets of social, economic, fiscal, and monetary policies set for 2013. 
The Plan outlines a set of measures to improve the investment climate, encourage 
economic modernization, launch high-technology manufacturing enterprises, and develop 
small and medium-sized business. The Government intends to further reduce red tape for 
both local and foreign investors and simplify the procedures of obtaining land for 
investment projects.   
70. 
The Government believes that the challenges in the priority areas, if addressed, 
would result in: (i) new and modernized jobs, reduced energy intensity, and expanded share of 
services sector; (ii) expanded private sector and reduced administrative barriers 
to 
entrepreneurship as testified by Belarus’s 30th position for ease of doing business in Doing 
Business report; (iii) Belarus entering a group of 50 countries with the higher level of human 
development; (iv) economic development at the average European level; and (v) social and 
economic development targets achieved. 
71. 
This reform and growth agenda will dominate the Government’s demand for WBG’s 
services over the medium term.

III. WORLD BANK GROUP PARTNERSHIPSTRATEGY 

A. Lessons Learned and Stakeholder Feedback 

72. 
The FY08-FY11 Country Assistance Strategy Completion Report (CAS CR) noted 
that the WBG managed its program well in a high-risk country environment with an 
uncertain structural reform implementation record.  The CAS recognized that potential 
benefits of stepped-up cooperation outweighed high macroeconomic and implementation risks, 
and a decision was taken mid-stream to expand engagement in light of the global financial crisis 
and progress in economic liberalization by the Government. As a result, the WBG, along with 
the IMF and other partners, provided additional support to reinforce social protection, address 
weaknesses in market pricing mechanisms, and strengthen budgetary process. Notwithstanding 
the recognition that policy reforms supported through the Development Policy Loan (DPL) laid 
the ground for future engagement in some areas, the WBG’s performance in designing and 
managing CAS implementation is judged at moderately satisfactory, given the overall limited 
sustainability on the policy front.  
73. 
On the other hand, the CAS CR gives a positive assessment to WBG’s responsiveness to 
the crisis, good performance of the investment portfolio, and high-quality, timely and strategic 
technical assistance and analytical support to the authorities.  
74. 
In particular, the CAS CR notes that the AAA program was instrumental in 
building a dialogue with the Government in important policy areas (see Box 2). It noted that 
high quality, relevant and data-based analysis established a foundation of trust in the dialogue 
with the Government.  A combination of deep analytical work with just-in-time advice and TA, 
have resulted in solid analytical underpinnings for future reforms and a better understanding 
among domestic and foreign stakeholders of the reform agenda and trade-offs ahead in Belarus.  
Moreover, strategic sectoral AAA informed the World Bank's own interventions and current 
thinking, in particular in transport sector, district heating and municipal services.  
75. Over the period of FY08-FY11 CAS, Belarus showed tangible progress on many 
CAS outcomes. However, insufficient progress on several CAS supported development issues 
was reflected in the moderately satisfactory program performance rating. Variability of results 
was observed in the energy sector – from extremely successful projects in support of energy 
efficiency and environmental protection that led to social and health benefits in schools, 
kindergartens and other public institutions, to the lack of progress in tariff policy. Achievements 
in other outcomes on public goods and services were also mixed, with good progress in transport 
sector and less successful work in the water supply and sanitation program.  The public sector 
efficiency and governance agenda advanced in tax reforms and strengthened budgetary practices 
but stalled in politically sensitive privatization. Belarus has made major advances in reducing the 
cost of doing business, moving from 115th position in 2008 to 58th in 2010. Some, albeit far 
from sufficient, progress was made in price liberalization. Modest goals set in the context of very 
limited possibilities for WBG impact in financial sector development have been achieved as have 
been social protection outcomes.  
76. 
The FY08-FY11CAS CR  draws the following key lessons that have been taken into 
account in designing the proposed CPS: 
• The new CPS should focus on critical priorities, adjusting the scope of the program and use 
of instruments to the readiness of reforms and willingness of the authorities to implement 
them. In doing this, the WBG will seek long-term engagement and maintain program 
continuity. The Bank will also pay increased attention to a medium-term macroeconomic 
framework to ensure sustainability of structural reform program supported by the WBG.  

18 

 
Box 1. Impact of AAA in Belarus – Some Examples 
Recognizing that policy reforms remain critical to addressing the most important development challenges in Belarus, 
the WBG has placed knowledge services at the core of its engagement. The AAA program has provided the 
analytical foundation for and contributed to policy formulation and evidence-based policy debate and catalyzed 
reforms in several policy areas. The policy dialogue built around core analytical reports, including a Programmatic 
Public Expenditure Review (PER 1 and 2, 2011-13) and Country Economic Memorandum (CEM, 2012), which 
were prepared and delivered through an interactive, collaborative process that informed policy discussions and 
ensured relevance and impact of recommendations.  
Structural Reforms: The CEM analyzed structural constraints in the current state-driven growth model and engaged 
the authorities in a dialogue on the need for structural reforms, including price liberalization, SOE restructuring, and 
creation of a conducive environment for private sector development. The Government has established a joint 
structural reform working group co-led by the Ministry of Economy and the WBG, with participation of 
governmental agencies and development partners, including the IMF, EU-ECFIN, and EBRD. Through this 
mechanism the Government requested WBG’s advice on key policy issues such as price liberalization, bankruptcy 
legislation, and removal of quantitative targets for SOEs.  
Privatization: Through a Privatization Technical Assistance funded by the Government of Austria WBG has 
supported the establishment of the National Agency for Investment and Privatization (NAIP).  The Agency is now 
working with the help from reputable financial advisors on attracting strategic investors for eight medium-sized 
SOEs, using competitive, open and transparent tender methodology consistent with international good practice.   
Fiscal Consolidation and Tax Reforms: The WBG supported the Government in undertaking fiscal consolidation in 
the wake of the global financial crisis through the PER, which provided options for expenditure rationalization and 
efficiency gains in core areas of the budget (macro-fiscal policy, energy, agriculture, social assistance, pensions, 
education and health, tax reforms). The PER has reinforced the Government’s objective to rationalize expenditures, 
starting with the most inefficient subsidies and to undertake tax reforms to gradually reduce tax burden on the 
economy. The Government undertook a significant fiscal consolidation program, reducing the public expenditure to 
GDP ratio from over 50 percent of GDP in 2008 to about 40 percent in 2012.  At the same time, the Government 
reformed the tax system, not only lowering overall tax burden, but also eliminating distortions (including eliminating 
a local sales tax) and reducing marginal rates on both personal and corporate income taxes.  In addition, the PER 
opened up the policy dialogue on important topics, such as public utility pricing, and education and health financing.  
Utility Tariff Reforms: The PER 1 analyzed the fiscal cost of provision of district heating, electricity and gas to 
residential consumers at below cost recovery tariffs and also assessed the social impact of urgently needed tariff 
increases. The analysis showed not only that fiscal cost is substantial, but also benefits of these subsidies are 
regressive, disproportionately benefitting the wealthier segments of society. As one of the options, the PER 
recommended the introduction of progressive tariff structures for electricity which would raise cost recovery and 
reduce the regressivity of energy subsidies while cushion the impact of tariff increases for lower income households. 
The Government adopted differentiated consumption-based gas and electricity tariffs, starting February 1, 2013. 
Enhancing Efficiency of Education Financing: The analysis, conducted during preparation of PER 1 with the help 
of a BOOST public expenditure tool, showed that the current input-based financing arrangements in education sector 
have provided weak incentives (and limited authority) to rationalize the use of inputs and improve productivity, 
service quality and outcomes. The PER 2 analyzed financing of education services and recommended reforms that 
would strengthen incentives for efficiency in public service delivery. Following PER 2 delivery, the Belarus 
authorities approached the Bank for advice on how to improve the effectiveness of their school optimization 
program.  The World Bank has responded to a Government request by launching a multi-year program of technical 
assistance with the initial aim to help Belarus authorities implement per-student financing (PSF) pilots in 17 general 
secondary schools in the cities of Minsk, Grodno, and Gomel.  The Bank will also continue sharing with the 
Government relevant international experiences, as well as train the Belarus counterparts in the use of data-driven 
analytical techniques that can help design an effective funding formula that can be perfected before nationwide roll-
out. Under this engagement, the Bank will also provide assistance on appropriate school autonomy and 
accountability mechanisms that will allow for an effective reform of the Belarus school financing regime. 

19 

 
 
 
• AAA work will be critical in creating consensus in important policy areas and building 
capacity and in preparing for lending operations.  The WBG will continue offering analytical 
work in response to real policy demand, and will apply an integrated approach in which 
analytical and diagnostic work will be combined with just-in-time policy advice, capacity 
building and lending. 

• 

In investment lending, the WBG should focus on sectors with an adequate or improving 
policy framework, solid knowledge base, good implementation capacity and a track record of 
successful cooperation in the past.  Despite the relatively good performance of investment 
projects, teams will be encouraged to pay extra attention to project design with due 
consideration to the country’s policy cycle, local capacity, implementation readiness, and 
engagement of project affected groups in project implementation and monitoring. 

Findings from Client Surveys and Stakeholder Consultations 

77. 
The FY08-FY11 CAS CR discussions and CPS consultations were held with small 
groups of targeted counterparts with day-to-day experience of working with the WBG, 
business associations, civil society organizations, development partners and beneficiaries of 
WBG-supported programs. The stakeholders shared their views regarding key priority areas 
for the next four years and the role of the WBG in addressing them. The outcomes of the 
meetings were important for outlining the CPS concept and developing a three-pillar approach. A 
strategic dialogue with the Interministerial CPS Working Group provided a platform for 
discussing the needs of the country and the way to address expectations in the framework of a 
future partnership. Consultations with wider groups of multi-stakeholders across regions carried 
out in January-April 2013 focused on economic competitiveness, human development, 
improvement of infrastructure services, global public goods, and governance and gender 
78. Overall, participants in the consultations agreed with the CPS approach and 
rationale and outlined the following key areas of focus for the WBG partnership with 
Belarus: quality of life, municipal sector services, education and employment, private sector 
development, efficiency of resource allocation, public administration, climate change, renewable 
energy, forestry and agriculture. Stakeholders emphasized the importance of taking into account 
the specifics of the country, providing technical assistance and advice, and sharing regional and 
global expertise and knowledge. Representatives of the civil society proposed to include 
information and awareness raising components in every project and to develop instruments for 
beneficiaries’ engagement in monitoring and assessing the provision of services in projects 
supported by the WBG, thus contributing to improving results and enhancing dialogue with 
authorities and service providers on the needs of beneficiaries.   
79. While reviewing the lessons of projects completed during the FY08-FY11 CAS, the 
Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) emphasized the importance for program success of 
ensuring the Government’s commitment, selecting projects with visible economic and social 
benefits, and quantifying outcome indicators at design stage.  IEG also pointed out significance 
of associated technical assistance and sufficient capacity development to carry out reform 
programs. Proper macroeconomic framework was noted as critical for the medium-term 
effectiveness of WBG-supported reforms.  
80. 
In January 2013, a client survey about stakeholders’ views of the World Bank and 
its work in Belarus identified a significant role for the WBG in Belarus and suggested areas 
for improvement in the medium term.  One hundred ninety stakeholders – drawn from a range 
of central and local state institutions, implementing agencies, civil society, media, private sector, 
academia, beneficiaries and development partners – were invited to provide their opinions on the 

20 

Bank’s assistance to the country. A total of one hundred fifteen stakeholders completed the 
survey (61 percent response rate).  
81. Overall results suggest that private sector development and such areas as economic 
growth, competitiveness and diversification, FDI, SOE, and energy efficiency are perceived 
to be the top development priorities for the country, and key drivers to improving people’s 
lives in Belarus. Opinion leaders see a critical role for the Bank in these top priority areas and 
areas related to public sector reform, social protection, and environmental sustainability in terms 
of Bank financial resources and knowledge products. These results are consistent with the 
priorities identified in this CPS and the findings of the CAS Completion Report.  
82. 
The WBG has a meaningful role to play in generating knowledge.  While two thirds 
of respondents believe that the WBG’s most effective instrument in helping to promote 
development and reduce poverty in Belarus is investment lending, the survey findings suggest 
that technical assistance, capacity development, and knowledge products are valued highly in the 
country.  

B. World Bank Group Partnership Strategy Overview 
Calibrated Assistance 

83. 
In response to the risk of reversal of policy reforms and reflecting the lessons learnt 
from the previous CAS, the WBG proposes to calibrate its program against the depth, 
breath and speed of structural reforms. The program will include Analytical and Advisory 
Activities (AAA), investment lending by the Bank and investments in the private sector by IFC.  
Should structural reforms accelerate, lending scope and instruments could be revisited at mid-
term of the CPS period.  
84. 
The WBG’s AAA program will be critical in creating consensus in important policy 
areas, building capacity and laying the analytical foundation for lending operations in the 
country. Core diagnostics around critical developmental issues will continue, including 
structural reforms, fiscal, PFM, trade, WTO accession, private and financial sector development. 
These AAA engagements - many of them of a programmatic nature - will underpin the policy 
dialogue in critical reform areas, supporting the Government in designing and implementing 
policies 
to achieve stated objectives of economic modernization and strengthened 
competiveness.  AAA activities in such areas as municipal services, forestry, education and 
health will underpin future investment operations. 
85. 
In the new CPS, World Bank’s investment lending will focus on sectors with adequate 
and improving policy framework, sufficient knowledge base, solid implementation track record 
and demonstrated government commitment, direct benefits to ordinary citizens and/or global 
public goods benefits. This includes energy efficiency and municipal utilities where we have on-
going operations with good track record of implementation as well as PFM, forestry and 
education, new sectors where: 1) we have established a solid  knowledge base through our recent 
and on-going AAA, and 2) there is an active policy dialogue and demonstrated government 
commitment to undertake policy reforms. 

Expected Results and Program of Lending and Non-Lending Activities  

86. 
The WBG Strategy will respond to the development constraints and possibilities 
outlined above by focusing on three key areas of reform and investment that could help 
improve: (1) competitiveness of the economy by supporting structural reforms, including 
reducing the role of the state, transforming the SOE sector, promoting private and financial 
sector development and integration into the global economy; (2) quality and efficiency of public 
infrastructure services, use of agricultural and forestry resources, and global benefits of public 

21 

goods; and (3) human development outcomes through better education, health and social 
services. 

Pillar 1: Improving Competitiveness of the Economy by Supporting Structural 
Reforms, Including Reducing the Role of the State, Transforming the SOE Sector, 
Promoting Private and Financial Sector Development and Integration into the Global 
Economy 

World Bank Group contributing to: 
Result Area 1: 
Economic stability and competitiveness 
Result Area 2: 
Deepening financial intermediation on market-based terms 
Result Area 3: 
Liberalized environment for private sector investment 

87. 
The CPS will address the need for structural reforms to allow Belarus to maintain 
stability, regain competitiveness, and diversify and modernize its economy, allowing 
enterprises to dynamically adapt to the evolving demands of the global economy (see 
paragraphs 37-45 above).  The CPS will accordingly contribute to an improved 
environment for private sector growth through support for economic stability and 
competitiveness, strengthened financial sector, and a liberalized environment for private sector 
investment.  
88. 
The three outcomes will also be supported through a number of more specific 
interventions from both the Bank and IFC. 

Result Area 1: Economic stability and competitiveness 

89. 
Belarus has suffered in the recent past from a severe macroeconomic crisis, and 
growth and employment creation are currently being undermined by decreasing competitiveness, 
caused both by rising real wages and stagnant productivity, and by the opening of Russia’s 
markets after its WTO accession (paragraphs 33-36 above).  The CPS proposes to help address 
both problems. 
90. 
Overall support for these aims would be provided through a Programmatic Structural 
Reform AAA(Technical Assistance (TA), FY13-15), which would anchor the dialogue and 
technical assistance on structural reforms, including further price liberalization, regulatory 
reforms, and SOE transformation reforms. The task will deliver several analytical and policy 
notes as well as training and capacity building events. An integrated Trade Policy/WTO 
Accession AAA (TA, FY13-15) would provide technical assistance to support Belarus in its 
effort to join the WTO. The task would comprise technical and policy notes on key aspects of 
WTO accession, inter alia on the economic impact of WTO accession, implications for financial 
service regulation, and system of state support. 
91. 
The CPS would contribute to economic stability necessary for investor confidence 
through its Fiscal Policy Dialogue AAA (TA, FY13-15). This task would continue to provide 
targeted analytical and advisory services to support fiscal reforms to enhance fiscal stabilization 
within a consistent macroeconomic framework, to ensure fiscal and debt sustainability and to 
provide for growth supporting expenditure and revenue policies. The task would deliver a series 
of technical notes, reports and training events. 
92. 
The CPS would support improvements in the management of Government finances 
through a Public Financial Management (Loan, FY15, USD100 million) – the project could 
also include a component for customs modernization.  The project is expected to improve 
transparency and efficiency of public financial management and strengthen accountability of the 

22 

 
 
Government for the use of public funds. It would support improvements in procedures for 
national budget planning, execution, accounting and reporting through review of existing 
methodologies in those areas and their alignment with applicable international standards and 
good practices. The project would also support modernization of the tools used by the Ministry 
of Finance and its subordinate units for processing, consolidation and analysis of financial 
management information to make it more accessible for specialists, decision makers and general 
public.  
93. 
In addition, the Regional Development AAA (Analytic/Advisory, FY15) would deliver 
a regional development report for Belarus, assessing economic geography, agglomeration of 
economic activity and sectors, labor markets and internal migration. The report would assess 
potential impact of structural reforms across different parts of the country and recommend policy 
options.  
94. 
A Trade Finance Program (TA, IFC, FY14) would extend and complement the 
capacity of banks to deliver trade finance. The program would give priority support to trade 
flows that promote critical sectors such as agriculture and energy efficiency, while maintain 
strategic focus on SME importers and exporters and trade between emerging markets. 

Result Area 2: Deepening financial intermediation on market-based terms 

95. 
Better access to finance is key to improved competitiveness of Belarusian economy 
(paragraph 42 above).  A Financial Sector Policy Dialogue AAA (TA, FY13-16) is providing 
just-in-time policy advice and TA to NBRB on deepening market-based financial intermediation 
while making the sector more resilient to possible shocks.  The agenda discussed with NBRB 
includes financial consumer protection and financial literacy, regulation of non-bank financial 
institutions, and development of market-based mortgage instruments to substitute for declining 
volume of subsidized housing programs.  With an improved policy framework, the dialogue 
could expand to cover topics such as restructuring of state-owned banks, financial sector stability 
framework, and enhancing bank supervision. 
96. 
Private sector growth is significantly impeded by lack of affordable finance (paragraph 
42 above). The CPS would support improved private sector access to finance through the 
MSME Lending Program (IFC Financing, FY14). The program is designed to provide 
funding to MSME market in the form of long-term debt finance.  IFC advisory program experts 
may also advise the banks on best practice tools on how to assess risks in lending to MSMEs, as 
well as help with risk management procedures. At the request of the authorities, the Bank will 
undertake a modular Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) (Analytic, FY14) 
focusing on the development of non-bank financial intermediaries (NBFI) sector (microfinance, 
credit unions, leasing, etc.).  

Result Area 3: Liberalized environment for private sector investment 

97. 
Belarus suffers from a generally poor environment for private business (paragraph 41 
above).  The CPS will support improvements in the business environment and in business 
services.  A Regulatory Simplification, Investment Climate Improvement Program (TA, 
IFC, Ongoing) is helping to expand the private sector and increase FDI in Belarus through 
improved regulatory policies and strengthened institutions, would continue to advise the 
Government on implementing policy reforms in regulatory simplification (permits, inspections, 
licenses), secured transactions and debt resolution, and investment generation.  In addition, 
potential delivery instruments to support the private MSME sector could include TA or 
investment loan to provide matching grant facility and/or line of credit through qualified 
commercial banks and/or microfinance institutions.   

23 

98. 
A Sector-Specific Business Regulation Project (TA, IFC, FY15) would build on the 
previous achievements of IFC’s investment climate work which resulted in broad-based reforms 
of procedures for obtaining permits and licenses, inspections, technical regulations, insolvency. 
Sectors (e.g. agriculture, forestry) would be selected based on their importance to the economy 
and competitive advantages that would allow Belarus to become a leading producer and exporter 
of agricultural and forest commodities in the world.  The program would aim to develop 
transparent and consistent regulations to create a more attractive investment climate for domestic 
and foreign investors, leading to sustainable future growth of the sectors. 
99. 
A Pilot SOE Privatization TA Project (Austrian Trust Fund, FY13-16, ongoing) 
would continue to provide advisory services to the Ministry of Economy and National Agency 
for Investment and Privatization to support tender privatization of select medium-sized SOEs 
using international best practice.  In the event of a successful outcome of the pilot transactions, it 
is expected that the program could be scaled up by the authorities, including changes in the 
legislative regime for privatization.   
100. 
If overall investment climate improves and reform advances to a point where SOE 
privatization is expected to include larger enterprises, IFC could support select SOEs through 
pre-privatization investments.  Through its involvement IFC can improve governance and help 
the investees adopt best practice standards, including in environmental and social areas, reporting 
and governance, thus contributing to more successful privatizations.   
101. The Government of Belarus sees a high potential in the private information and 
communications technology (ICT) sector becoming one of the pillar industries driving growth in 
FDI and export of services. Furthermore, introduction of ICT systems would be critical to 
support WTO accession.  The Bank will consider providing support in introduction of ICT 
infrastructure within public sector. 

Pillar 2: Improved Efficiency and Quality of Public Infrastructure Services, 
Enhancedand Sustainable Use of Agricultural and Forestry Resources and Increased 
Global Public Good Benefits 

World Bank Group contributing to: 
Result Area 1: 
Enhanced energy security and efficiency of resource use 
Result Area 2: 
Improved standards in agriculture and forestry sectors 
Result Area 3: 
Improved public 
infrastructure and municipal public utility 

102. Growth sustainability is also constrained by deteriorating infrastructure, inefficient 
use of energy, and significant unrealized economic potential of the country’s natural 
resources, particularly forestry (see paragraphs 47-57 above).  The CPS will address these 
constraints by supporting efforts to improve energy security, raise efficiency of the use of natural 
resources, and provide better and more cost-effective public services. 

Result Area 1: Enhanced energy security and efficiency of resource use 

103. Belarus’s economy and fiscal balance are compromised by high energy use and an over-
dependence on a single source of imports (paragraphs 49-52 above).  The CPS will contribute to 
improved energy security and efficiency of resource use through a number of initiatives.  There 
will be three areas of focus: 
104. Energy Efficiency: The Energy Efficiency Project (Loan, FY10, USD125 million and 
Additional Financing FY13, USD90 million) is supporting improved energy efficiency in heat 
and power generation in selected towns in Belarus.  The Project is aligned with priorities of the 

24 

 
Belarus national energy programs to improve energy security and to reduce dependency on 
energy imports.  The Post-Chernobyl Recovery Additional Financing (FY11, USD30 million) 
is providing the population residing in the Chernobyl affected area with energy efficient and 
reliable heat and hot water services in order to improve their living environment and provide 
clean and improved space heating to households that were burning wood inside homes with 
potential negative environmental and health consequences.  The Energy Efficiency Project 
(IFC Finance, FY14-15) will support funding of projects leading to improvements in energy 
efficiency, through providing banks with longer-term funding and advisory support for 
development of energy efficiency and SME banking products. 
105. Renewables: The Biomass-based District Heating TA (FY13, on-going) identifies and 
analyzes available least-cost heat supply options, namely increased use of biomass energy for 
heat production and associated energy efficiency measures.  The results of the study will be used 
to identify the scope of a Biomass District Heating Project (Loan, FY14, USD 90 million) to 
increasing use of renewable biomass and improving energy efficiency of district heating systems.  
While the project is targeting the supply side of district heating, it is complemented by an 
ongoing Poverty and Social Impact Analysis (PSIA) assessing  affordability of proposed 
energy tariff reforms as well as energy efficiency and renewable energy measures available to 
reduce the cost of energy (in particular heat) supply. 
106. 
In addition, the Renewable Energy Project (IFC Finance, FY15) will support private 
companies engaged in the generation of alternative sources of energy.   
107. Resource Efficiency: The Resource Efficiency Financing (IFC and Ministry of 
Finance of Austria, FY11-16, On-going and Regional) will seek to stimulate investment into 
uptake of resource-efficient (REF) technologies and best practices; to improve management 
processes and operational practices in industry across all sectors; and to raise awareness among 
policy makers and financial institutions.  The Sub-National Finance Project (IFC Finance, 
FY16) would build on successful sub-national experience in the region and support reform 
oriented sub-national entities in the areas of infrastructure upgrading, with a particular focus on 
resource efficiency. 

Result Area 2: Improved standards in agriculture and forestry sectors 

108. Belarus’s agricultural sector is sub-optimal and a drag on the budget.  There is also 
great potential for more effective use of forest and other environmental resources (paragraphs 
53-57 above).  The CPS will support improvements in agricultural output and efficiency, food 
safety, and forest management.   
109. Agriculture: The Agriculture Project (IFC Finance, FY15) will support private 
operators in agriculture, especially the dairy sector, throughout the supply chain to address the 
main bottlenecks to the sector’s growth and to generate broad sectoral impact.  The emphasis 
will be on projects which maximize impact, through demonstration effect and linkages to local 
producers. Investments can be accompanied by advisory work to improve the investment climate 
for agribusiness and bring food safety standards to an international level.  In addition, the 
Institutional Development Fund (IDF) Grant for Strengthening Capacity for Monitoring of 
Agricultural Policy Instruments (TA, on-going, FY11-15) is supporting the Government’s 
review of current arrangement for monitoring and evaluation of agricultural policy drawing on 
European experience, providing training in analytical methods for policy analysis and applying 
these skills to the analyses of policies initially in the dairy sector.   
110. Forestry: Since satisfactory completion of the WBG’s first involvement in Belarus’s 
forest sector (the Forestry Development Project) in 2003, the WBG has continued its engagement 
in the sector through technical assistance funded by the EU through the Forest Law Enforcement 
and Governance (FLEG) Program.  On-going support includes FLEG II (TA, EU TF, FY13-17) 

25 

implemented by the WB in partnership with two international NGOs (World Conservation Fund 
(IUCN) and World Wildlife Fund (WWF)).  The FLEG Program (starting with FLEG I from 
2008-12 and continuing with FLEG II from 2013-17) is supporting the formulation and 
implementation of forest policy, legal, administrative and institutional reforms, including support 
in the preparation of Belarus’s new Strategic Forest Development Plan to 2030.  A Forest Policy 
Note (ESW, FY13) provides strategic advice to help define sector goals, aims and opportunities 
for consideration in the preparation of the Strategic Forest Development Plan and helps identify 
potential areas for support to the sector. In addition, the Forest Management Improvement 
Project (Loan, FY15, USD40 million) will support strengthening of forestry protection and 
forest fire prevention, production of alternative energy (wood-chip fuel); and introducing new 
technologies for forest harvesting. 
111. Agriculture and Forestry: The IFC’s Sector-Specific Business Regulation TA (see 
paragraph 97 above) would support reforms of procedures for obtaining permits and licenses, 
inspections, technical regulations, insolvency in sectors including agriculture and forestry.   
112. Food Safety: The Food Safety Project (IFC Advisory Services, FY10-13, USD1.25 
million with Ministry of Finance of Austria) aims to increase competitiveness and export 
opportunities of Belarus food processors by improving existing food safety standards and 
building capacity of the local food safety inspectors and experts.  This activity will continue to 
provide advisory services to Belarusian private food processors to facilitate the uptake of 
internationally recognized standards through raising awareness of the standards, training food 
safety consultants, and providing in-depth assistance to clients.  If brought up to international 
food safety and quality standards, the Belarusian food industry could accommodate significant 
export market growth which will help increase Belarus’s trade and subsequently enhance the 
country’s economic development. 

Result Area 3: Improved public infrastructure and municipal public utility services 

113. Belarus has deteriorating infrastructure with high operating costs (paragraphs 46-47 
above).  The CPS will support improvements in efficiency, quality and sustainability of 
municipal and communal public utility services. 
114. Water Supply and Sanitation: The Water Supply and Sanitation Project (Loan, FY09 
USD60 million and Additional Financing, FY14, USD60 million) would together support 
improvements in access to water supply and quality of water and wastewater services.  The FY09 
Project has been focusing on upgrade of wastewater treatment systems serving 600,000 people, 
on improvement of water quality for more than 300,000 urban dwellers, and on extension of 
water supply systems to 8,000 people.  The proposed FY14 Additional Financing will support 
similar objectives, with a specific focus on development of additional wastewater treatment 
facilities.  These projects are supported by the Municipal Water Sector Review (Analytic, 
FY13, ongoing) whose objective is to formulate sector modernization recommendations 
addressing service efficiency and sustainability challenges.  The analysis is also seeking to find 
the most efficient ways to enhance interface between utilities and users to promote transparency 
of services delivery and tariffs and feedback mechanisms on service provision.  This effort 
would also reduce governance risks and increase results orientation of the projects. 
115. Municipal 
Services: 
The Municipal 
Services 
Performance Review 
(Analytic/Advisory, FY15) would provide evidence-based policy recommendations targeted at 
strengthening delivery outcomes, environmental performance and sustainability of services 
provided by Belarus sub-national government entities.  The AAA would assess (i) access, 
quality, and customer satisfaction with municipal services and (ii) financial and environmental 
sustainability and efficiency of service provision.  This would also include a review of the sub-
national finance framework to assess revenue, transfer and expenditure position of public utilities 

26 

and communal service departments.  An assessment of the enabling environment affecting 
municipal service performance, such as sector institutional framework and governance structure, 
and review of options for private sector participation in selected service areas would also be 
included. 
116. Waste Management: The Integrated Solid Waste Management Project (Loan, FY10, 
USD42.5 million) supports improving municipal service provision and increasing environmental 
benefits by recovering and reusing recyclable materials.  The loan finances (i) establishment of a 
Materials Recovery Facility and (ii) upgrading of the separate waste collection system in the City 
of Grodno.  A waste separation and collection improvement plan was prepared and adopted by 
the City of Grodno.  Coverage of the city’s recycling system would be expanded to provide 100 
percent of the population with access to separate waste collection services.  Waste disposed at 
landfill would be reduced by an estimated 20,000 tons per year as a result of waste source 
separation and material recovery.  Specific information and feedback mechanisms will be created 
and institutionalized to ensure sustainability of project results and monitor project beneficiaries’ 
satisfaction.  The POPs Stockpile Management Project (GEF, FY10, USD5.5 million) has 
been strengthening national capacity to manage hazardous wastes associated with Persistent 
Organic Pollutants (POPs).  The project will reduce environmental and health risks associated 
with the presence and release of POPs in the local and global environments. 
117. The Roads Project (Loan, FY10, USD150 million) is an ongoing project which 
upgrades a section of the European road corridor IX from a two-lane road to a four-lane 
motorway.  It also helps the Government to address the problem of road deterioration due to 
overloaded trucks, by introducing a modern axle load monitoring and control system. 

Pillar 3: Improved Human Development Outcomes 
ofEducation, Health and Social Services  

through Better Delivery 

World Bank Group contributing to: 
Result Area 1: 
Improved social protection and greater labor market efficiency 
Result Area 2: 
Increased efficiency of health and education services delivery 

118. Belarus’s social service delivery systems, while providing widely accessible and 
affordable social protection, health and education services, are costly and inefficient.  The 
CPS will support better and more cost-effective education, health and social protection service 
with the aim of improving human development outcomes. 

Result Area 1: Improved social protection 

119. Belarus’s social protection system provides a wide range of benefits, but has a very low 
share of targeted programs; it also does not provide for adequate unemployment insurance 
needed to mitigate the social impact of structural reforms (paragraph 66 above).  The CPS would 
support better social protection and improved mobility in the labor market through an 
Employment/Labor Market AAA (TA, FY13-15), which will make optimal use of Labor 
Force Survey (LFS) data and carry out detailed and comprehensive labor market analysis. This 
would underpin further engagement in strengthening unemployment protection in Belarus and 
assess potential for introduction of unemployment insurance, expanding active labor market 
policies, and enhancing the capacity of the national employment service to use labor market data 
for policy design. A series of capacity building activities will be organized, starting with training 
in Automated DEC Poverty Tables for Labor Market Analysis (ADEPT LM) for Government 
counterparts and local think tanks. Institutional assessment of Belarusian public employment 
services and active labor market policies would be another important task to prepare the 

27 

 
Government to cushion the impact of restructuring and labor shedding.  Furthermore, the TA 
would produce an engagement note on the challenges posed by the demographic transition and 
increased longevity. It will analyze the impact of the demographic transition on the size and 
composition of the Belarus labor force, policy scenarios to stem the demographic decline, and 
implications for productivity growth, skills development, and social policies such as 
employment, long-term care, health and pension policies.  The note would aim to inform policy 
makers about the nature of the coming changes, identify possible policy areas for reform, and 
discuss areas of further cooperation. 
120. Based on the engagement note and depending on interest shown by the Government in 
subsequent discussions, the CPS could include a Long-Term Care AAA (ESW, FY15-16) 
which would focus on development of long-term care services.  The study may be used to outline 
further path for reforms in residential care (de-institutionalization), pensions, and health care 
services. 

121. The CPS would be prepared to support strengthened social protection through structural 
reforms in social assistance and pension domains if the Government’s commitment to reform 
warrants.  A Social Protection AAA (TA) would provide technical advice to improve targeting 
of the social assistance and to ensure sustainability of the Pay-As-You-Go pension system in the 
medium and long term. 

Result Area 2: Increased efficiency of health and education services delivery 

122. Both health and education sectors suffer from poor outcomes in relation to the resources 
committed to them (paragraphs 60-65 above). The CPS would support strengthening of health 
services for better health outcomes through an Improving Quality of Care Programmatic 
AAA (TA, FY14-16), which will (i) contribute to align the health care delivery system to 
existing needs and changed epidemiological and demographic profile; help Government develop 
new non-communicable diseases’ prevention and control strategies; (iii) contribute to enhance 
quality of care in the health sector by updating and expanding the national protocols and clinical 
guidelines by level of care (“care pathways”) to standardize care processes, reducing the 
variability in clinical practice and improving outcomes; (iv) contribute to establish functioning 
long-term care sector with a focus on de-institutionalization of patients, on care coordination 
between the health and social sector under the principle of money following the patient, and on 
building-up of community-based social services for the elderly.  To this end, a series of capacity 
building activities will be organized, starting with the Mogilev Oblast authorities, who will be 
conducting a pilot project starting in 2014. 

123. 
In education, the Government has requested Bank support on efficiency reforms in the 
general education subsector.  In response to this request, the CPS would include a 
Programmatic Education AAA (TA, FY14-15), which will (i) bring best practices from 
regional experience in per-student financing (PSF) to Belarus; (ii) assess the feasibility of school 
network optimization and simulate potential efficiency gains; (iii) assist in designing and piloting 
the PSF formula in up to 3 cities/oblasts; (iv) build capacity among education and finance 
authorities to monitor and evaluate the piloting of the formula and identify formula adjustments, 
as needed; (v) advise on the appropriate legal framework necessary for reform to increase school 
budget autonomy; and undertake other related activities. If the reform process advances 
successfully, the CPS would support continued improvements in education sector quality and 
efficiency through an Education Services Transformation Project (Loan, USD50 million, 
FY15/FY16)that would support national rollout of PSF by: (i) preparing receiving schools for 
inflow of students from optimized schools; (ii) providing training and methodological support to 
local authorities and school principals and accountants; (iii) strengthening national systems 

28 

needed to monitor the impact of reform, including development of student assessments to gauge 
education quality. 

IV. IMPLEMENTING THE COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY 
Proposed Lending and Knowledge Program 

A. 

124. 
Implementation of the existing portfolio will determine achievement of majority of 
CPS outcomes.  The current investment lending portfolio includes five operations, totaling USD 
457 million, with about 53.0 percent to be disbursed.  Most of the ongoing projects were 
approved at mid-point of the previous CAS in 2009-2010, in response to initial market-oriented 
reforms and global financial crisis.  The entry of new investment projects into a small portfolio 
resulted in a reduced disbursement ratio at the end of the previous CAS.  Additionally, 
insufficient implementation readiness, limited capacity of the new implementing agencies and 
impact of the financial crisis caused implementation delays in two projects: Water Supply and 
Sanitation and Integrated Solid Waste Management. Implementation hurdles have been 
overcome in the Water Supply and Sanitation project, while work is still underway to bridge 
implementation gap in Integrated Solid Waste Management project.  Overall portfolio 
performance has improved steadily in the past year as a result of intense focus by the Bank and 
Government on portfolio management, which 
included semi-annual Country Portfolio 
Performance Reviews (CPPRs) which set time-bound action plans for each project and the 
portfolio as a whole, regular monitoring of procurement milestones and disbursements and active 
restructuring. As of April 2013, overall portfolio disbursement ratio reached 28 percent. 
125. The World Bank’s lending program for FY14-15 will play an important role in 
achieving the CPS outcomes and envisages a total of about USD380 million in investment 
loans (Table 2).  New lending has been identified for the first two years of the CPS, while the 
lending scope and specific projects for the outer years will be defined in the CPS Progress Report 
based on evolution of country’s demand and priorities as well as pace in implementation of 
sectoral and structural reforms.  Additional Financing to the ongoing Energy Efficiency project 
(USD90 million) is FY13 deliverable but is expected to become effective in FY14 and, therefore, 
included in the list of new activities.  Investment lending pipeline for FY14 includes Additional 
Financing to the on-going Water Supply and Sanitation project and a Biomass-based District 
Heating project. In addition, two projects are envisaged in FY15: PFM Modernization and 
Forest Management Improvement. Additionally, an Education Services Transformation 
project will be considered for delivery in either FY15 or FY16depending on progress in sector 
reforms and implementation of piloted PSF mechanism. In FY16-17, investment lending may be 
considered in: (i) health and education; (ii) municipal services, including energy efficiency; (iii) 
transport; (iv) private sector development and competitiveness, and (v) agriculture.  
126. 
IFC annual commitments for FY14-15 are planned to total up to USD70 million per 
annum and will contribute to achieving CPS outcomes under Pillars 1 and 2.  Under Pillar 
1, IFC will continue to provide finance in the framework of Global Trade Finance Program 
(GTFP) and extend support to MSMEs through local commercial banks. Under Pillar 2, IFC will 
consider energy efficiency finance programs aimed at stimulating energy efficiency investments 
through bank guarantees and advisory services. 
127. The WBG’s AAA program will be critical for achieving the CPS outcomes under all 
3 Pillars (Table 2).  AAA will focus on advice in key policy areas such as structural reforms, 
trade, fiscal, PFM, private and financial sector development, and municipal services.  A number 
of earlier started TA activities will continue in support of sectoral dialogue in privatization, 
forestry, and agriculture and in new areas, in particular, in health and education, to build the 
knowledge base and policy environment for new lending. IFC Advisory Services, seeking to 
expand the private sector and increase FDI in Belarus through improved regulatory policies and 

29 

strengthened institutions, would continue to advise the Government on implementing policy 
reforms in regulatory simplification (permits, inspections, licenses), reforms on secured 
transactions and debt resolution, and investment generation.  This program would build on the 
previous achievements of IFC’s investment climate work which resulted in broad-based reforms 
of procedures for obtaining permits and licenses, inspections, technical regulations, insolvency. 
128. Trust Funds resources made notable contribution to the FY08-11CAS outcomes as 
they were closely integrated into the core program of the WBG, linked to the analytical work and 
responded to country priorities, including strengthening institutional capacity and contributing to 
a dialogue on tackling present macroeconomic vulnerabilities and advancing economic 
liberalization; increasing efficiency of resource allocation, building statistical capacity, 
addressing energy efficiency and renewable energy, hazardous waste management, and  forestry 
and agriculture issues.  
129. The Trust Funds portfolio increased to seventeen grants totaling USD16 million in 
FY13, managed by the Bank and IFC, up from four programs totaling USD 3.5 million in FY08 
and four programs totaling USD2.2 million in FY10.  Partnership with other donors resulted in 
leveraging funds for technical assistance and advisory services but also for project preparation 
and co-financing, including financing from United States Agency for International Development 
(USAID), Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA), Danish Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs, Federal Ministry of Finance of Austria, multilateral grant facilities, such as 
Energy Sector Management Assistance Program (ESMAP), Strengthening Accountability and 
the Fiduciary Environment (SAFE), and grants from trust fund for Statistical Capacity Building 
(TFSCB), Institutional Development Fund (IDF) and Global Environment Facility (GEF).  

130. The WBG will continue efforts to enhance the role of Trust Funds in leveraging the 
WBG resources and contributing to the CPS outcomes.  Trust fund activities will support a 
number of priorities under the CPS pillars, including fiscal governance, consumer protection and 
financial literacy, labor force survey, regulatory simplification and investment generation, 
private enterprise development and privatization, promotion of public-private partnerships in 
municipal sector, increasing use of renewable energy and resource-efficient technologies, 
improving forest law enforcement and governance, and enhancing monitoring and evaluation of 
agricultural policy instruments and agricultural competitiveness. 

131. The Results Matrix is based on the existing program and the activities proposed for 
the first two years of the CPS.  The Progress Report will expand the results framework based 
on evolution of the WBG engagement and activities for the remaining years of the CPS. 
132. While reflecting strategic country development goals in areas supported by the 
WBG, the CPS results framework will ensure clear attribution between WBG-financed 
activities and CPS outcomes. In particular, as noted by the CAS CR, this CPS will pay greater 
attention to realism of CPS outcomes and will establish more direct linkages between the WBG-
supported activities and influence they had on advancing the country development goals.

B. Managing Program Implementation 

Implementation Readiness 
Incorporating lessons from the CAS CR, the CPS will place additional attention on 
133. 
implementation capacity and quality at entry, in particular on procurement readiness of 
investment projects.  In this CPS, preference will be given to activities that build on successful 
projects where ownership is clear and implementation capacity is in place.  Greater emphasis 
will be given to the analytical grounding of investment operations.  The AAA program - many of 
which have started in FY11-FY13 – will underpin future investment activities, in particular in 
PFM, municipal services, forestry, and health and education. In case of first-time borrowers, 
capacity-building will be built into project design during preparation, and disbursement and 
implementation schedule will be aligned with capacity-building in procurement and contract 
management.   
Increased emphasis on procurement readiness, with realistic advance planning of 
134. 
procurement and close downstream contract management, will ensure that implementation 
and disbursement can start soon after project effectiveness.  Additionally, semi-annual joint 
CPPRs will continue to be used to monitor portfolio performance and resolve implementation 
bottlenecks and combined with regular on-the-ground, hands-on implementation support by task 
teams and proactive use of restructurings.  
Operationalizing Governance 
135. 
Increased attention will be paid to governance issues and social accountability 
across the entire program.  Entry points for sector engagement will be determined based on: (i) 
quality of policy framework in the sector; (ii) Government commitment/demand; (iii) capacity of 
state and non-state institutions; and (iv) potential impact on improving transparency and social 
accountability of decision-making.  For example, following these principles, lending pipeline for 
FY14-15 offers either scaled-up support to sectors with established capacity and solid 
implementation record in the past, or proposes new lending in areas such as PFM and forestry 
where ownership and capacity exist.  
136. At the project level, the CPS proposes to use a GAC filter for lending operations, 
trust funds, and major AAA to examine GAC-related implementation risks and their 
influence on country outcomes.  It will be applied at pre-concept, design, and implementation 
stages and will ensure that GAC issues are given appropriate attention, risks are identified and 
mitigation measures discussed early on.  The filter is intended to guide management and teams 
on the kinds of issues that should be given particular attention.  The filter was introduced in the 
Belarus, Moldova and Ukraine Country Department at the time of the Ukraine CPS FY12-16, 
and is an adaptation of the Operational Risk Assessment Framework (ORAF) to the governance 
circumstances in the country. 
137. Use of GAC filter will help integrate analysis of GAC related risks in operations and 
ensure systematic risk-based decision-making across the portfolio.  At pre-concept stage, 
before significant WBG resources are committed, GAC risks and benefits of proposed operations 
are identified and discussed, using a set of guiding questions summarized in Annex 6.  This stage 
will focus on the most salient risks and opportunities, as well as a recommended course of 
action; for example, additional GAC or political economy diagnostics, demand-side initiatives, 
and other design features could be advised.  In some cases, it may be recommended not to pursue 
the proposed activity further.  At later stages, GAC filter will be used to review the evolution of 
risks during project preparation and to assess the effectiveness of efforts to manage GAC risks 
during implementation. 

32 

138. Engagement on governance issues through policy dialogue will continue on the most 
crucial reform issues for the Government to consider.  In particular, the WBG will support 
Government’s efforts to improve long-term public finance sustainability through public finance 
and fiscal governance reforms, including spending adjustment and efficiency (primarily, in 
health and education; social protection; and intergovernmental fiscal relations), and debt 
management.  It will also continue dialogue on transition to a new growth model, including 
reform of SOEs, and private sector governance.  The ongoing work on municipal services will 
support Government’s efforts to further improve quality of public service delivery.  
139. Demand-side governance engagement will focus on participatory monitoring, 
encouraging accountability to the beneficiaries through transparency and empowerment.  
Participatory monitoring will allow for active participation of project beneficiaries, communities 
and other primary stakeholders in project design and implementation and monitoring of project 
outcomes.  A focused portfolio review will be undertaken in FY13 to identify the most 
appropriate social accountability tools to increase project effectiveness and development impact. 
The review will identify social accountability instruments and approaches tailored to project 
needs and country context, and will ensure their integration into the World Bank portfolio by 
applying social accountability-linked 
indicators 
in operations, as well as 
identifying 
opportunities for the use of beneficiary surveys and feedback.  For example, specific information 
sharing and feedback mechanisms will be created and institutionalized to ensure sustainability of 
project results and monitor project beneficiaries’ satisfaction as well as enhanced compliance 
with the right to information. 
140. CPS activities will also involve civil society in a proactive way, particularly to 
support their role in governance and social accountability.  CPS activities will support 
dialogue between civil society, authorities, and public agencies through: (i) proactive 
information dissemination,(ii) capacity building, and (ii) civil society involvement in Monitoring 
and Evaluation (M&E) activities.  The CPS will build on the Global Partnership for Social 
Accountability to help broaden accountability of public institutions at the national and local 
level. 
Gender  
141. 
In response to the challenges identified in paragraphs 30-32 above, the WBG will 
continue addressing gender issues through its financing, analytical work and technical 
assistance.  In particular, analysis under the Programmatic PER, including on long-term fiscal 
sustainability of the pension and healthcare systems in the context of projected demographic 
changes, situation with non-communicable diseases, efficiency and sustainability of pension 
system and health care, suggests specific reform options to confront challenges and ensure higher 
impact of social services.  Introduction of a regular LFS containing gender-disaggregated data 
would allow improved gender statistics.  Financial Sector TA supporting the national financial 
literacy program is expected to result in increased use of financial services by women, including 
for business purposes. 
142. Gender lenses will be applied in all operations aiming to identify gender disparities in 
endowments and economic opportunities in selected areas of development and suggest possible 
ways of addressing such most critical gaps through WBG-supported activities.  Building on the 
current WBG program, possible focus areas could be equal participation of women in the labor 
force and entrepreneurship, curbed male mortality rate linked to non-communicable diseases and 
hazardous lifestyle, sustainability of the pension and healthcare systems, and higher impact of 
social services. 

33 

 
 
Partnerships and Donor Coordination 
143. The proposed WBG strategy has been designed in close coordination with other 
development partners.  Throughout the process of FY08-11 CAS implementation, the WBG’s 
team collaborated closely with a number of development partners, including the IMF, European 
Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), EU, Nordic Investment Bank (NIB), SIDA, 
United Nations Development Program (UNDP), US Agency for International Development 
(USAID), and other bilateral donors. In the new CPS the WBG will continue seeking 
partnerships on key policy issues, technical assistance and advice.  The WBG would aim to 
further leverage partnerships to: (i) share more systematically the findings of economic and 
sector work (ESW) with other partners, (ii) undertake joint ESW/TA whenever possible, and (iii) 
leverage other donors' resources. 
144. The WBG and the IMF teams will continue working closely in calibrating and 
delivering their assistance.  The IMF plays a key role at the macro level, while the WBG 
focuses on the structural reform agenda, energy efficiency, infrastructure and social and 
environmental issues.  Recent examples of close cooperation and coordination between the WBG 
and the Fund include discussions under the IMF SBA post program monitoring and during the 
preparation of the CEM, and joint work with the Government Working Group on structural 
reform issues, and the joint support in the development of a Medium-Term Debt Strategy 
(MTDS). Areas of shared responsibility between the Bank and the Fund include macroeconomic 
development, public expenditure management, debt management and financial sector. 
145. The WBG closely coordinates its activities with the EU through the Bank/EU Day, 
regular consultations through the meetings organized by the EU, participation in the European 
Dialogue and managing regional programs (FLEG and REPARIS/STAR-EaP).  On bilateral 
basis the WBG works with the Government of Austria on (i) a pilot project to launch and roll out 
a privatization program consistent with international best practice,  and (ii) a project targeted at 
enhancing the competitiveness of Belarusian food producers by improving their food safety 
practices. 
146. The EU and the WBG teams would also associate technically under some on-going 
EU and WBG assistance to Belarus.  The EU has ongoing programs in Belarus that provide 
policy advice on electricity sector reforms, energy efficiency norms and standards and promotion 
of renewable energy.  The WBG is providing TA in the promotion of renewable energy, wood 
biomass in particular.  Potential areas for collaboration between the EU and the WBG include 
structural and institutional reforms in the energy sector aiming to support the Government in (i) 
unbundling and liberalizing the utilities market, (ii) decreasing the energy intensity; (iii) 
increasing the use of domestic and renewable energy resources; and (iv) energy tariff reforms. 
Synergies will also be established in climate change mitigation area (e.g. forestry, waste 
management) aligned with the EU regional strategy.  A dialogue in the forestry sector will be 
maintained though the second phase of the EU funded FLEG Program for which the Bank is an 
implementing agency. 
147. The WBG and the EBRD will continue a dialogue in such important policy areas as 
investment climate and structural reforms (including privatization).  The proposed WBG CPS 
complements well the recently approved EBRD Strategy for Belarus and new synergies will be 
sought in energy efficiency, renewable energy, and the municipal sector. 
148. The WBG in partnership with SIDA and USAID is implementing Regulatory 
Simplification and Investment Generation Advisory Project to help Belarus improve its business 
and investment climate. 
149. The WBG and UN have established synergies and coordinate their efforts consistent 
with the UN Development Assistance Framework (UNDAF) for the Republic of Belarus for 

34 

2011-2015. The WBG and UN agencies maintain continuous dialogue in five strategic areas of 
UNDAF: (i) sustainable social and economic development; (ii) national health care systems; (iii) 
environmental sustainability; (iv) national migration management in line with international 
standards; and (v) national governance system. Another important area of ongoing multi-year 
cooperation is recovery and sustainable development of the Chernobyl-affected regions. 
150. The WBG and NIB have discussed and agreed on approaches to rehabilitation of 
wastewater management facilities under respective ongoing lending operations in Belarus. 

V. MANAGING RISKS 

151. A major risk is the reemergence of price and exchange rate instability.  As discussed 
in paragraphs 23-27, Belarus has only recently emerged from the severe balance-of-payment 
crisis of 2011, when unsustainable policies pushed the economy into an inflation-depreciation 
spiral. Since mid-2011 stabilization measures have been in place that have restored foreign 
exchange markets and reduced inflation and current account deficit. However, premature policy 
loosening in 2012 has led to the reemergence of price and exchange rate pressures, posing 
renewed risk to an already-weak reserve position.  These risks are exacerbated by Belarus’s 
reliance on subsidized energy inputs from Russia, directed credit and sizeable foreign financing. 
In particular, the Government’s over-optimistic growth forecasts for 2013 and potential use of 
monetary, fiscal and quasi-fiscal stimulus to achieve it raises concerns over monetary and fiscal 
prudence.  In addition, Government commitments to increase major expenditure categories – 
especially wages –could exacerbate the situation.  These risks would be further magnified if 
there was continued economic slow-down in Russia and/or the EU.  Accordingly, the WBG will 
carefully monitor emerging economic and fiscal developments.  While the IMF will take the lead 
on macroeconomic issues, the WBG’s dialogue on public expenditures and budget management 
would be intensified and re-oriented should economic instability reemerge.   
152. Despite the need for deep structural reforms to enhance Belarus’s medium-term 
economic prospect, reforms to date have progressed slowly and may experience further 
reversals during this CPS period.  The risk of policy reversals remains high given the 
centralized decision-making and control, lack of broad-based support for reforms and track 
record of reform reversals in the past, including, for example, expansion of the list of socially 
important goods subject to price controls in 2011 or shift back to ad hoc privatization in 2012. As 
a mitigation measure, the CPS proposes to calibrate WBG assistance against the depth, breath 
and speed of structural reforms. In case of constrained reform space in Belarus, the Bank 
program will be limited to traditional uncontroversial investment projects for infrastructure 
needs, especially those with global public good benefits, and AAA with stronger advocacy 
element and IFC Advisory Services and investment in the private sector. 
153. Another risk is that relations with the EU could deteriorate.  Relations with the EU 
have remained strained since 1996, with temporary rapprochement in 1999 and 2008.  Any 
further deterioration in relations could threaten trade and investments from OECD countries.  If 
the trade and investment environment deteriorates some of IFC activities, e.g. advisory programs 
may become infeasible or dependent on availability of funding.  The WBG will continuously 
consult with key stakeholders so that WBG programs have support even in difficult environment. 
154. Gas pricing is another area of significant risk.  In 2010 deteriorating relations with 
Russia led to the temporary removal of discounts on energy imports from Russia, sharply 
increasing the current account deficit and contributing significantly to the 2011 foreign exchange 
crisis. Over time, gas import prices should return permanently to market levels, affecting the 
balance of payments and fiscal situation if remedial measures are not taken in advance.  In 
addition, the reliance on Russia as a key creditor in the 2011 crisis has further increased 

35 

 
economic dependence.  Should the trade or financial situation again deteriorate, the CPS 
program would be modified to refocus the economic dialogue and reassess which IFC financings 
could still be productive. The WBG’s policy dialogue on increasing domestic prices, tariffs and 
energy efficiency and ongoing investments in energy efficiency would help to mitigate the risk.

World Bank Group FY08-FY11Country Assistance Strategy Completion Report 

Date of CAS: November 7, 2007, Board Discussion   
Date of CAS Progress Report: October 27, 2009 
Period Covered In The CAS Completion Report: FY08 – FY11 
CAS Completion Report (CAS CR) prepared by Gregory Jedrzejczak, Elena Klochan, Yulia Snizhko and 
Oksana Nagayets under the guidance of Qimiao Fan, Country Director (ECCU2) and Rufat Alimardanov, 
Country Manager (IFC).  The CPS CR team included Marina Bakanova, Irina Oleinik, and the WBG 
Belarus Country Team. 

Executive Summary  

1. 
The World Bank Group (WBG), under the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for FY08-FY11, 
supported the Government’s reform agenda through a program of selective investment and analytical and 
advisory activities (AAA) with a strong focus on public goods and benefits to citizens. The WBG’s 
strategy was adjusted mid-stream in light of the 2008 global financial crisis, economic liberalization 
measures undertaken by the Government, and good WBG portfolio performance.  As a result, the WBG, 
along with the IMF and other partners, provided additional support to reinforce social protection, address 
weaknesses in the market pricing mechanisms, and strengthen the budgetary process.  IFC adjusted its 
product mix in response to the crisis to better meet the needs of its private sector clients. 
2. 
The FY08-FY11CAS - both original and adjusted in CAS Progress Report - acknowledged that 
macroeconomic and implementation risks would be high given the country’s economic vulnerabilities, 
policy reversals, and inconsistent implementation of reforms in the past. However, the risks were worth to 
be taken given the opening window of opportunity to engage Belarus in more substantial cooperation. The 
policy reforms supported through the DPL laid the ground for future engagement in some areas. Through 
its policy work, the Bank opened additional avenues for dialogue and produced and transmitted 
knowledge useful for follow-up activities. 
3. 
Overall, program performance was moderately satisfactory, with a deepened dialogue and 
tangible achievements towards the CAS goals, but insufficient progress on several development issues.  
The WBG’s performance was moderately satisfactory, given the limited sustainability  on the policy 
front, offset, however, by responsiveness to changing external economic environment, solid performance 
of the ongoing program of investment operations, high-quality and relevant AAA, and fruitful 
cooperation with the majority of involved partners.  
4. 
Due to political developments in the country that strained relations between Belarus and key 
shareholders, preparation of a new CPS was postponed for more than a year. This CAS CR - while 
dealing with the CAS period of FY08-FY11 - also looks at the results achieved beyond this period 
whenever it is substantially relevant to the CAS outcomes.  

Progress Towards Country Development Goals  

5. 
Belarus has long been considered a country performing rather well on many measures, but well 
below its potential: not using in full its well-educated population, broad industrial base, and geographic 
location. For almost two decades the country has followed a state-led, highly centralized economic model 
with a significant government share in all sectors of the economy and hands-on involvement of public 

37 

 
 
 
administration in managing enterprises and resource reallocation.  Attempts at market reforms - most 
recently in 2010 - were too inconsistent and hesitant to move away from a state-dominated model. 
According to the EBRD Transition Report, Belarus consistently rates below comparators on the extent to 
which it has transformed its economy to the new post-Soviet realities.  
6. 
The period of the CAS started with promising developments: the economy grew at 8.2 percent in 
2007 and at 10 percent in 2008, mostly because of strong demand for Belarus’s traditional products, 
cheap energy from Russia, and improvement of terms of trade.  
7. 
The global crisis was transmitted to Belarus in the fall of 2008 through lower export revenues and 
reduced access to international borrowing.  The impact, however, was milder in Belarus than in other 
former Soviet Union countries in terms of output decline and unemployment growth10. Economic growth 
slowed to 0.2 percent in 2009 but quickly rebounded to 7.7 percent in 2010 and 5.3 percent in 2011. 
Poverty rate fell by 0.7 percentage points to 5.4 percent in 2009 and further to 5.2 percent in 2010, before 
increasing to 7.3 percent in 2011 as a result of currency and balance of payments crisis that resulted from 
loose macroeconomic policies in pre-election 2010 and early 2011. 
8. 
The CAS was well aligned with the Government’s strategic goals articulated in the Program of 
Social and Economic Development (PSED) for 2006-2010 11.  
9. 
Originally, the CAS strategic outcomes were grouped under two pillars: (1) Delivering Global 
Goods and (2) Facing Transition and Shocks through Competitiveness and Inclusion. The first pillar was 
aimed at improving energy efficiency, water supply quality, waste management, and infrastructure 
services in Chernobyl-affected areas. The second pillar focused on increasing competitiveness and 
diversification of the economy, and promoting effective and transparent government.  
10. 
In 2009, to mitigate the effects of the global financial and economic crisis, the Government 
requested the WBG to broaden assistance in light of reform progress and the good track record 
established in the implementation of WBG-supported activities. In response to the good progress 
confirmed by the CAS PR, the WBG stepped up its engagement, opened a dialogue on structural reforms, 
and increased lending twofold, including policy lending not envisaged in the original CAS. The structure 
of the CAS was extended with a third pillar, Public Sector Efficiency and Fiscal Discipline. The 
adjustment did not change the development objectives of the original CAS (to assist Belarus to address 
global public goods in the areas of natural environment and energy challenges and enhance the 
competitiveness of its economy to ensure rising incomes and to protect the welfare of the weakest). The 
extended strategic goals focused foremost on strengthening public financial management system, with 
particular emphasis on reform of targeted social assistance to reduce leakages and protect the most 
vulnerable groups in view of expected severity of the crisis. With these adjustments, the CAS remained 
consistent with Belarus’s evolving development strategy.  
11. 
Adjustments to the CAS were coordinated with other development partners, including the IMF, 
EBRD, and UNDP. A Development Policy Loan (DPL) complemented the macroeconomic framework 
supported by the IMF’s Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) initiated in January 2009. However, when the 
IMF-supported macroeconomic program expired, lack of this anchor contributed to a progressive 
unraveling of macroeconomic discipline that undermined and diminished the effectiveness of parallel 
structural reforms. 

Overview of Program Achievements  

Delivering Global and Local Public Goods (Pillar I)  
12. 
This pillar supported investment projects with a focus on global public goods and improved 
quality of public services not requiring significant policy reforms. It focused on energy efficiency, water 
and waste management, and environment.  At mid-term, this pillar has been expanded to include tariff 

10 The Belarusian model allowed growth to continue but at the expense of increased inventories; registered 
unemployment remained low, but there was an increase in shortened labor weeks and forced leaves. 

11 Program of Social and Economic Development of the Republic of Belarus for 2006-2010. Decree of the President 
of Belarus # 384, June 12, 2006. 

38 

                                                           
 
reforms expected under the DPL.  The program envisaged under this pillar has had mixed results: with 
success in energy efficiency and environment protection, delays in the water supply and sanitation 
program, and little progress in tariff policy reform.    
13. 
A more detailed description is presented below and in the self-assessment annex. The general 
positive lesson is that strong demand at the beneficiaries’ level, strong ownership, and established 
collaboration with the implementing agencies bring expected results. The two investment loans to enable 
greater energy efficiency in public facilities including in Chernobyl-affected area were very timely and 
met their goals. The negative lessons can be drawn from unrealistic expectations of substantially 
improved and sustainable policies in socially sensitive areas at the time of Presidential elections and 
worsening economic fundamentals. A reversal in the recovery of energy and utility tariffs is an example 
of economically inconsistent mid-term policies not anchored in external obligations such as IMF SBA or 
a DPL.  On the Bank portfolio side, insufficient readiness for implementation of the water supply and 
sanitation investment led to implementation delays while flaws in project design required project 
restructuring. 
Outcome 1: Provision of investments in energy efficiency measures to selected social and other public 
sector facilities and households, including upgrading/replacement of heat generation and distribution 
equipment, thermal insulation improvements.  
14. 
This outcome was achieved. The main vehicles for this outcome were Social Infrastructure 
Retrofitting Project and Post Chernobyl Recovery Project, including additional financing. The IBRD’s 
program was timely and coordinated with the Government’s program for improving energy efficiency, 
which had started 15 years earlier. The program was in high demand at the beneficiaries’ level as it led to 
social and health benefits in schools, kindergartens and other public utilities. IFC contributed to the 
energy efficiency agenda by providing its first targeted loan, and accompanying advisory services, to 
Minsk Transit Bank to support energy efficiency improvements by micro, small and medium enterprise 
(MSME) borrowers.  
Outcome 2: Improved cost recovery of energy and utility tariffs. Reduced cross-subsidization among all 
consumer categories 
15. 
Outcome 2.1 was not achieved, though some progress in improved cost recovery for heating 
should be noticed. While the need to improve cost recovery and limit cross-subsidization of tariffs was 
well understood by Government officials, political economy considerations prevailed. 
16. 
Outcome 2.2 was achieved. The number of preferential consumers fell from 149 companies in 
2008 to 130 in 2009 (by 13 percent) and 53 in 2011 (by 65 percent). 
Outcome 3: Reduction of health risks for people living in Chernobyl-affected area due to exposure to 
radioactively contaminated wood 
17. 
This outcome was achieved. Switching from burning contaminated wood to clean gas has had 
multiple positive impacts on the health of users and environment. Successful implementation of the 
investment was due to the Government’s and local authorities’ ownership on the one hand, and good 
design and implementation readiness of the project on the other.   
Outcome 4: Improved quality of water and wastewater management. Improved access of urban 
population to a centralized water supply 
18. 
This outcome was not achieved. Implementation of the Water Supply and Sanitation Project - 
underpinning this outcome - has been slower than planned, mostly due to insufficient project readiness for 
implementation and weak implementation capacity of the new counterpart. Deficiencies in project design 
(the fragmentation of resources across a too large number of beneficiaries) undermined the possibility to 
achieve major impacts. In addition, the project was affected by the 2011 foreign exchange crisis, and 
several BYR-denominated contracts without a price adjustment clause had to be cancelled and re-bid.  

39 

 
Entry, Regulatory Reform and Competitiveness (Pillar II)  
19. 
This pillar comprised the most socially and politically sensitive outcomes; particularly, with 
Belarus’s strong focus on safeguarding access to basic goods and services and retaining jobs in the short 
term. Both the IBRD via its DPL, and IFC via its direct investments in the private sector companies and 
its advisory services, including the Investment Climate Advisory Project, continued to support these 
efforts and provide technical advice on how to move forward. However, the changing macroeconomic 
conditions played a critical role in the progress or lack of it.  
Outcome 5: Reduction of regulatory and administrative barriers and decreased costs to business entry and 
operation 
20. 
This outcome was achieved. There has been notable progress on this front, particularly regarding 
small and medium-size enterprises.  Belarus has made major advances in reducing its cost of doing 
business.  According to the Doing Business Report, Belarus jumped from the 115th position in 2008 to the 
58th in 2010. This made Belarus one of the top ten reformers in 2009 and 2010, an achievement aided by 
both the IBRD and IFC: the former through its DPL and AAA, and the latter through its advisory 
services.   
Outcome 6:Greater access to finance for private sector companies 
21. 
This outcome was achieved. IFC investments in Belarus grew rapidly during the FY08-FY11CAS 
period, from less than USD 5 million in about two projects per year during the previous CAS period to a 
record USD 125 million invested in FY11 in eight projects. Total investments in Belarus during the 
FY08-FY11CAS period amounted to USD 335 million in 18 projects in financial, manufacturing, 
agribusiness, and retail sectors. On-lending of IFC financing through private sector banks facilitated 
almost 19,000 new loans to micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs). Over 100 additional SMEs 
were reached through IFC investments in agribusiness, expanding their market access. More than USD 
180 million in trade finance lines to banks facilitated trade flows, especially in the aftermath of the 2008-
2009 financial crisis. IFC investment portfolio in Belarus of USD 154 million is nearly fully disbursed 
(86 percent) and is performing well, with no non-performing loans (NPLs) as of the end of 
2012.Economy-wide, however, much still has to be done to create an even playing field for private 
businesses when compared with state enterprises. However, the CAS design recognized the limited scope 
for broad-based WBG impact in this area and set relatively modest goals which have been achieved. 
Outcome 7:Support further tax simplification and reduction of tax burden on enterprise sector 
22. 
This outcome was achieved. Under the DPL and the follow up dialogue on structural and fiscal 
reforms, Belarus achieved substantial progress in tax reforms. The most distortive taxes - turnover tax and 
local tax on goods and services - were eliminated. Also, corporate income tax rate was reduced and 
enterprises were allowed to use accelerated depreciation and carry forward mechanisms to add flexibility 
to their corporate governance toolkit.12 
Outcome 8: Support transition to free market pricing by further reduction of administrative price controls 
and regulated trade margins 
23. 
This outcome was partially achieved. Belarus has had a higher level of price control than other 
transition economies. From this vintage point, the CAS period brought quite important progress toward 
market-based prices. This progress was confirmed by an improving EBRD index of price liberalization. 
2011 saw some setbacks on price control, but it was relaxed in 2012 when market and social tensions 
abated. The agenda of reducing administrative price control to the levels of modern market economies is 
still far from being realized. The Customs Union with Russia and Kazakhstan, the accession of Russia to 
the WTO, and intensified efforts to speed up Belarus’s WTO accession make the challenge even more 
acute.   

12Doing Business Report for 2013 recognizes these efforts and contains a box on Belarus’ progress in the area of 
paying taxes as the best practice.

Outcome 9:Quality, transparency, accountability, and efficiency of the privatization process improved 
24. 
This outcome was partially achieved. The IBRD-supported pilot project on privatization of 
several medium-size enterprises is currently underway with an objective of introducing the best 
international practices based on competitiveness and transparency of the process. The newly established 
National Agency for Investments and Privatization is now fully operational. At the same time, the 
privatization of large state-owned enterprises (SOEs) is still routinely done in relatively non-transparent 
fashion, mostly driven by fiscal considerations. While corruption is relatively low, enterprises - 
irrespective of their ownership - are mandated to retain jobs even if this is detrimental to their 
competitiveness.  
Outcome 10:Facilitate competitiveness of transport sector by supporting modernization and upgrading of 
critical physical infrastructure in road and railway sectors 
25. 
This outcome was achieved. Road Upgrading and Modernization Project - underpinning this 
outcome - became effective in 2010, and road upgrading works are progressing well.  However, the 
modernization component of the project has to be modified since the Government decided to implement 
road tolling in Belarus on a faster track and outside the IBRD’s project. The lesson learnt is that 
investment projects in Belarus are prone to broader risks - not so much for implementation efficiency 
(which is generally good), but in the sense that important decisions may be taken at very high levels of 
Government and outside the control of the WBG’s direct sector counterparts, without leaving space for 
discussing the rationale of such decisions and their consequences for a project in particular, and for 
reforms in general.    

Public Sector Efficiency and Fiscal Discipline (Pillar III) 
26. 
This pillar was added in response to the financial crisis and was supported by a DPL. The DPL 
was prepared with recognition of the urgency of the situation and with little previous experience in policy 
lending dialogue with Belarusian counterparts.  CAS outcomes reflect this urgency: from a well-defined 
and structurally important outcome on safety nets to less elaborated outcomes on budgetary practices and 
agricultural dialogue. In hindsight, additional outcomes of the reviewed CAS, reflected in the DPL, put 
more pressure on reforms supportive to the efficient budgetary process and fiscal constraints at the 
expense of social protection reforms. However, at the moment of adjustments to the CAS in the Progress 
Report, the risk of grave social consequences of the crisis and an increase of poverty was real, but turned 
to be overemphasized.  
Outcome 11:Strengthen social safety nets by better targeting accuracy of the social assistance programs 
for the poor and scaling-up of social assistance programs. Share of social assistance received by the 
poorest 20 percent of population 
27. 
This outcome was achieved. Better targeting of social assistance expenditures had two objectives.  
One was to recalibrate social assistance programs, away from universal benefits to targeted benefits, 
converting these programs from entitlements to needs-based ones.  The second was to make these 
programs more flexible and responsive to economic vagaries, particularly in light of the 2008 global 
financial crisis.  The initial assessment was that the economic shock affecting Belarus would substantially 
increase poverty.  Hence, the DPL encouraged the Government to expand the existing targeted social 
assistance programs with the budget for such programs doubled. Fortunately, poverty increase projections 
did not materialize. Nevertheless, better targeting and accuracy of social assistance spending were 
warranted - the goal of delivering 45 percent of these funds to the bottom 20 percent of the populations 
was achieved. 
Outcome12: Strengthening financial sector discipline  
28. 
This outcome was partially achieved. The IBRD support in this area has been limited to analytical 
work, which helped to structure the IMF SBA program in 2009. The financial sector in Belarus is small 
and - dominated by state-owned banks - inefficient. Continued lending with government guarantees and 
subsidies creates consistent liquidity problems in major state-owned banks. Their recapitalization (5.3 
percent of GDP in 2011) presents a large contingent liability for the Government. In the nascent privately-
owned segment of the banking sector, IFC has worked to promote best practices among its client banks 
41 

 
and, following the financial crisis, offered risk management advisory support to strengthen their 
operations and manage the increase in NPLs. 
Outcome 13:Budgetary practices in line with the best regional practices 
29. 
This outcome was partially achieved. The results of this outcome are mixed. Belarus scores above 
regional averages on five of six PEFA dimensions. On the other hand, introduction of a Medium-Term 
Expenditure Framework (MTEF) for policy-based budgeting has not been achieved yet. This was mostly 
due to incompatibility of the MTEF three-year framework with the existing practice of five-year planning 
cycle that is legally binding for the Government. 
Outcome 14:Dialogue launched to increase efficiency in agricultural resource allocations 
30. 
This outcome was partially achieved. Agricultural and forest resources are the most important 
natural assets Belarus has. Agricultural land is still owned by state farms and the system needs deep 
reforms. While the Bank has prepared an Agricultural Productivity and Competitiveness Note, its impact 
was negligible as the Ministry of Agriculture and Food - the main policy maker in this area - was not the 
main counterpart for the Note, and the Ministry’s commitment to continuing a reform dialogue with the 
IBRD was not strong. Expectations for this outcome should have been more realistic.  
31. 
In the forestry sector the IBRD continued substantial and successful dialogue via the EU-funded 
regional Forest Law Enforcement and Governance (FLEG) program, although it was not reflected in the 
CAS outcomes. 

The World Bank Group’s Performance 

Design of the Strategy 
32. 
The original directions of the strategy were relevant to the challenges facing Belarus and aligned 
with the Government’s core priorities at the moment of strategy formulation.  The FY08-FY11 CAS was 
more selective than past strategies, lowering expectations and narrowing its focus on what could be 
achieved and, therefore, bringing risks to manageable levels. The FY08-FY11CAS was more realistic 
than in the past. Having recognized that the political economy was not conducive for the Government to 
take on “big ticket” comprehensive reforms, the CAS focused on investment lending leaving policy issues 
to AAA.  The revised CAS took a much higher deliberate risk by engaging in activities necessary to 
mitigate the expected serious negative social consequences of the global crisis. Also, the WBG accepted 
(though with some reservations) the declared Government commitments to more comprehensive reforms. 
As a result, the WBG decided to use this “crisis opportunity” to deepen the dialogue despite the fact that it 
was understood that policy results might be smaller than spelled out in the revised CAS and the DPL. 
Policy engagement was important for strengthening the role of the Bank in Belarus over the whole period 
of the CAS.   
33. 
The IFC program focused on the sectors that were open to private sector participation and had a 
comparative advantage for Belarus, such as agribusiness and value-added manufacturing. IFC also 
provided targeted financing through financial intermediaries to small and micro businesses. As expected 
in the CAS PR, since FY10 the IFC’s investments averaged more than USD 80 million per year, with new 
investment products introduced, such as energy efficiency lending, trade finance, and the first parallel 
loan mobilized for an existing client in the manufacturing sector. Advisory work on the business 
environment successfully continued during the CAS period, and several new advisory projects were 
launched to help improve the competitiveness of private companies in the area of food safety standards, 
sustainable finance, and, most recently, the efficiency of resource use. IFC repositioned itself in response 
to the crisis to better address its clients’ needs through shorter term financing instruments, such as trade 
finance and risk management advisory services.  
34. 
The ensuing results matrix closely corresponded to the strategic goals set out in the CAS. The 
matrix suffered from a few shortcomings, however.  The first was the lack of clear linkages between some 
actions and the influence they had on advancing the Country Development Goals.  In the area of private 
sector development, the business enabling environment agenda for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) 
was closely aligned with the Country Development Goals and produced measurable broad-based results, 
42 

 
which are summarized in the self-assessment table. In the area of direct support to the private sector, 
through IFC’s investments or company-focused advisory work or through the IBRD’s pilot privatizations, 
the WBG impact was limited to enterprises in question and to generating demonstration effects, providing 
best practice examples, and modeling the desired behaviors.  This was also the case in realizing 
improvements in agriculture, where support by the IBRD was insufficient to have relevant material 
influence, and water and sanitation with overly optimistic expectations about achieving results within a 
short time period.  The second was an uneven importance of the expected outcomes - from some related 
to fundamental structural reforms to rather marginal ones which would rather qualify as intermediate 
targets. The IBRD’s lending envelope was modest - about USD 100 million per year, typically one 
investment operation, while AAA was expected to provide the intellectual basis to engage in policy and 
technical assistance on the specific sectors’ issues. Originally, no development policy lending was 
anticipated. This changed, however, in response to the 2008 global financial crisis and as an opportunity 
to deepen the policy dialogue emerged, and was reflected in the CAS PR.  

Implementation of the Strategy 
35. 
Hesitant reforms implemented by the Government led to repeated stops-and-starts in the Bank’s 
program, including time gaps between subsequent strategies. The FY08-FY11 CAS was the first one 
since FY02-FY04 CAS, and expired in mid-2011.  This negatively reflected on building the investment 
portfolio and related AAA activities in a more systemic way and in line with the long-term strategic 
objectives.  No new loan was approved between 2001 and 2006, and only preparation of an investment 
operation designed to support recovery of Chernobyl-affected area of Belarus and AAA activities 
advanced at the beginning of the FY08-FY11 CAS period.  However, in response to market oriented 
reforms and global financial crisis, 2009-2010 saw a significant increase in lending: about 60 percent of 
lending Belarus received from the beginning of its IBRD membership was approved during these two 
years.  Significantly, the IBRD provided the first DPL, but reversal in reforms led to another slow-down 
in lending in 2011-2012. In FY11 - under a revised lending program, the IBRD provided a new 
investment loan to upgrade part of the international transport corridor, and an additional financing loan 
for improving energy efficiency in Chernobyl-affected areas.  
36. 
Overall, the WBG managed its program well in a high-risk country environment with uncertain 
structural reform implementation record. The IBRD has been responsive and provided timely and high-
quality strategic technical assistance and analytical support to the authorities; it created relationships with 
other development partners, in particular, building strong complementarities with the IMF program.  
37. 
Together with the IMF’s support for macro-stabilization, the IBRD’s DPL helped to ease the 
immediate pressures on the economy in the first half of 2009. The DPL allowed the dialogue to deepen on 
structural reforms, but, unfortunately, the IBRD had limited leverage to influence significant change in 
the structural reforms agenda, with mixed results achieved (from good progress in deregulation, reduction 
of tax burden, moves towards market-based price-setting in goods and services, and social assistance 
strengthening - to no progress in improving cost recovery of the energy sector and hardening of the 
budget constraints for state-owned enterprises) and their medium-term effectiveness questionable. 
38. 
During the CAS period, the investment portfolio performed well. There were no at risk or actual 
problem projects. All of the five ongoing operations were rated satisfactory for Development Objective 
(DO) and Implementation Progress (IP). The entry of two new investment projects in 2009 and one in 
2010 into a small portfolio resulted in a reduced disbursement ratio of 10.6 percent in FY10.  The 
disbursement ratio started picking up to 14 and 16 percent in FY11 and FY12, respectively. Despite some 
improvements in 2011, a combination of inflation and significant BYR depreciation had an adverse 
impact on contract performance under all projects (as price adjustment clause was not included in the 
works contracts) and resulted in lower than anticipated disbursements across the portfolio. Additionally, 
insufficient implementation readiness as well as limited capacity of the new implementing agencies 
caused delays in two projects: Water Supply and Sanitation and Integrated Solid Waste Management.  
39. 
The AAA program was instrumental in building a dialogue with the Government in important 
policy reform areas. Throughout the CAS period the WBG consistently provided independent and data-
based analysis, establishing a foundation of trust in the dialogue with the Government. In FY08-11, the 
43 

 
Bank delivered a series of Economic Policy Notes to update the 2005 Country Economic Memorandum (CEM).  
Background materials and discussions for these notes informed the preparation of the DPL. A PEFA was 
completed in FY09 and served to underpin the DPL through measures to streamline tax and control 
systems and increase the transparency of state support. The FSAP Update and Auditing and Accounting 
ROSC also contributed to the policy and reform dialogue. The FSAP update highlighted the adverse 
impact of directed lending schemes on resource allocation, the health of the banking sector and the 
structure of incentives in the economy.  Its recommendations were reflected in the DPL, as well as in the 
IMF’s SBA.   
40. 
The Country Economic Memorandum and Public Expenditure Review were the key ESW 
products in FY11.  Additionally, the Bank continued to be engaged in technical assistance (TA) to help 
improve the targeting of social assistance programs and ensure pension system sustainability in Belarus, 
as well as to continue the dialogue on structural reforms and strengthening public finance management.  
Technical assistance to privatization was another key product in FY11. Building on the dialogue with the 
Government started in 2009, the TA stepped up assistance to support the Belarus privatization program 
through the grant provided by the Government of Austria.    
41. 
The sectoral AAA was strategically linked to lending and filling gaps in priority areas. The 
Transport Sector Policy Note completed in FY11 served as an analytical underpinning for the preparation 
of the lending operation. In the energy sector, the Bank supported the preparation of an ESMAP funded 
study Harmonizing Renewable Energy Legal and Regulatory Framework with European Union.  In the 
agricultural sector, the IDF Grant for Strengthening Institutional Capacity for Monitoring and Evaluation 
of Agricultural Policy Instruments followed the FY10 Agricultural Productivity and Competitiveness 
Note. A dialogue in the forestry sector was maintained through the EU-funded regional FLEG program.  
42. 
IFC’s performance and program were moderately successful. IFC investments had strong results 
as evidenced by the reach indicators cited earlier, although none of the IFC investments in Belarus have 
been evaluated by IEG during the CAS period. IFC operations contributed to the relevant CAS outcomes 
of improving business environment, strengthening the financial sector, including in the context of the 
financial crisis, and supporting the nascent private sector. IFC expanded its investments, providing USD 
335million to the private sector with a focus on priority areas in line with the country’s strategic 
objectives.  Accompanying advisory services focused on improving the business environment.  IFC 
rapidly adapted to the changing macroeconomic environment during the financial crisis, contributing to 
the resumption of trade finance and funding for MSMEs, as well as improved risk management practices. 
This helped IFC clients withstand the crisis and maintain relatively good portfolio quality. The Global 
Trade Finance Program in Belarus reached its peak utilization of nearly USD 80 million during the 2011 
crisis.  Over 12,000 people, half of whom are women, are employed by IFC’s real sector clients, 
contributing to the CAS PR objective of preserving and creating new sustainable jobs in the private 
sector. IFC’s demonstration effect is typically difficult to measure, but the ability to bring a parallel lender 
into a project or to attract a major international company to Belarus market are all examples of this 
impact, and both took place during the CAS period with IFC support. 

Risk Management 
43. Managing the risks of the CAS was a daunting task for many reasons.  Firstly, Belarus’s social 
and economic programs were often driven by political considerations, and policy decisions were taken 
outside the public scrutiny with new priorities often difficult to predict. Secondly, the CAS period 
covered quite dramatic turns in the economic global environment and in relations between Belarus and 
the West.  In this context, the Bank Group reacted well by building steady relations and knowledge 
transfer in a number of Government agencies. It paid back, particularly with quick and workable response 
of the post-crisis DPL. 
44. 
The CAS appropriately emphasized the risk of the political economy context (which in Belarus is 
quite fundamental) and fragile sustainability of the reforms.  Macroeconomic risks were appropriately 
identified in the CAS to the extent possible in the very volatile global environment but, in retrospect, their 
potential impacts were underestimated while the willingness of the Government to undertake decisive but 
socially risky actions to improve the macroeconomic situation was overestimated, as acknowledged in the 
44 

 
CAS PR.  Leveraging policy reforms through increased coordination with other development partners, 
most notably the IMF and the EBRD, proved to be a right mitigation tool.  A DPL that was prepared hand 
in hand with the IMF SBA in early 2009 produced very positive initial results.  However, when the IMF-
supported macroeconomic program expired, the lack of leverage contributed to unraveling of 
macroeconomic discipline that resulted in the second internally induced macroeconomic crisis at the end 
of 2010 as well as undermined effectiveness of structural reforms. 
45. 
In the case of implementation risks, flaws in projects’ design and readiness, as well as 
institutional weaknesses of implementing agencies, were not always identified properly in advance and 
had to be remedied during implementation by restructuring projects and adjusting their implementation 
schedules. 
46. With regard to IFC operations, the impact of the crises on IFC’s ability to provide new lending 
was not fully anticipated.  The provision of local currency finance was restricted when the National Bank 
of the Republic of Belarus curbed the use of the swap facility.  In the context of deteriorated political 
environment and strained relations with the EU and the US, IFC temporarily limited its pre-privatization 
activities in the country per guidance from its Senior Management and the Board and in line with the 
position taken by the EBRD. 

Lessons Learned and Suggestions for the New CPS 

47. 
This self-evaluation of the WBG's activities over the FY08-FY11 period generates lessons that 
may be relevant for the next CPS as highlighted below.  
48. Managing risks in the next CPS.  In the next CPS period, engagement of the WBG in Belarus is 
likely to remain high-risk, given mixed track record in implementation of policy reforms and limited 
leverage of the Bank in the country.  While potential opportunities for engagement remain significant, 
making continued engagement necessary, there are a few lessons to be heeded.  Increased attention to a 
medium-term macroeconomic framework would be critical to ensure sustainability of structural reforms 
program supported by the WBG. Given capacity constraints in implementation of some reforms in the 
past (for example, social assistance targeting), any future program should focus on critical priorities, but 
be flexible enough to allow adjustments to the Government’s implementation pace.  While a single-
tranche DPL was an appropriate instrument to direct and test the Government’s reform commitment 
during the crisis, going forward (should the WBG decide to re-engage in development policy lending) it 
would be advisable to consider programmatic engagement with a medium-term perspective. Finally, the 
Bank should pay increased attention to cooperation with the key donor partners in the country, 
coordinating their dialogues and policy frameworks. 
49. 
Synergies between Bank products.  While the weight of policy reform is typically borne by 
DPLs and investment operations help to implement these policies, going forward the IBRD should make 
sure that its investment lending engagement is in the sectors where there is an adequate or improving 
policy framework.  The use of integrative approach - working closely across the sectors, combining 
diagnostics with just-in-time advice and capacity building, and creating complementarities with the other 
donors - proved to work particularly well in FY08-FY11 CAS, and should be built on in the next CPS. 
Learning and Knowledge Transfer.  Since Belarus has its own reform modus operandi - more 
50. 
gradual and top down than in other transition economies - it would be important to take into consideration 
what has worked in other countries, and how those approaches might be adapted to Belarus.  The WBG 
should seek dialogue and cooperation with empowered policy makers and drafters of legislation, even if it 
is more difficult at the beginning and will require more hands-on engagement of WBG staff. There is a 
need for continuous interaction and learning between Belarusian policy makers and the WBG on core 
strategic goals, as well as increasing awareness among the public.  This approach has worked in a number 
of sectors where local staff was ready to provide professional daily advice to counterparts. The IBRD’s 
solid work in outlining the path to reforms in social protection and statistics is a good example of building 
the knowledge base for investment operations and/or DPL, and leveraging the knowledge with partners to 
influence broader sector outcomes.  The challenge is to sustain and broaden such efforts.  

45 

 
51. 
Trans-border Approach. Thanks to the geographical location and historical experience, 
Belarus’s development is dependent on the cross-border cooperation more than that of its peers.  
Transport, forestry and trade are the best examples where the WBG could use its regional expertise to the 
benefit of the country. 
52. 
Institutional Capacity and GAC. In Belarus, the capacity of the Government agencies to 
generate policies and implement WBG projects is very uneven. The WBG should realistically focus on 
the sectors with stronger implementation capacity and a track record of successful cooperation in the past. 
As a rule, PIUs are part of the government administration with all its limitations for hiring additional 
professionals, such as lawyers or procurement and financial specialists. Loan-imbedded training 
opportunities can provide good incentives for hiring professional staff. 
53. 
Program Flexibility and Sustainability. In Belarus’s highly centralized economic model with a 
large role of the state sector and primacy of non-transparent politics, the WBG has to be ready to adjust 
the program (both up and down) depending on readiness of reforms and willingness of the authorities to 
implement them. With the exception of large unpredictable swings in the external economic situation that 
may force emergency interventions (as with the DPL under the last CAS), the new CPS should clearly set 
the menu of options and critical conditions for the WBG engagement. The CPS has to take into account 
that reforms in Belarus are often quite shallow and reversible once the external pressures abate and/or 
political calculations change. In doing so, it is important to seek long-term engagement, maintain program 
continuity and not to be distracted by short-term changes in the authorizing environment. 
54. 
Expected outcomes.  Expected CPS outcomes should better reflect the real impact of available 
instruments. CPS outcomes should be modest and better focused on a few areas with realistic potential to 
make a difference, rather than cover a wide “wish list” of reforms.  
55. 
Projects Design and Readiness.  Despite relatively good performance of projects in the 
portfolio, teams must be vigilant to avoid designs that are too complex, do not fully take into 
consideration local capacity, are not ready for implementation at effectiveness, and are not flexible 
enough to adjust to changing policy and macroeconomic environment without project restructuring. 
56. 
AAA.  Comprehensive and deep analytical pieces were the platform for the policy dialogue and 
have helped to build trust with key policy makers. Several key AAA (including the CEM and PER) were 
built around continuous client engagement with many intermediate outputs being shared and discussed 
intensively with the authorities. The analytical reports built  solid underpinnings for future reforms and 
contributed to better understanding by all stakeholders (domestic and foreign) of the reform agenda and 
trade-offs faced by Belarus.  Their preparation process was supported by seminars and study tours and 
helped to involve counterparts with the decision making capacity.  This approach should be continued in 
the next CPS, perhaps with more continued, upfront assessment of impact of specific AAAs on 
implementing the CPS strategic pillars.    
57. 
Staffing and budgetary resources.  Last but not least, relative weakness of institutions, the need 
for intensive transfer of knowledge, and the need for broad public advocacy of reforms would require 
adequate attention of the WBG management, stronger local and international staffing, and adequate 
budgeting.  Mid-term CAS adjustment and the DPL stretched the capacity of the staff (local in particular) 
to the limit and left some emerging opportunities for deepened cooperation unaddressed.

2011). 

Outcome 1.2 has been achieved.  
148 400 MWh/year of fuel was saved 
due to modernization of boiler houses 
and other energy efficiency measures 
under PCRP (September 2012) 

Outcome 1.3 has been dropped. The 
feasibility studies carried out during 
WSSP implementation clarified that 
priority investments should focus on 
service quality and coverage expansion 
rather 
than on energy efficiency 
improvement. WSSP was restructured 
in December 2012 to reflect this change 
in the scope of investments. 

Lessons and Suggestions for the new CPS 

SIRP and PCRP were essential components 
of 
the Government’s 
larger well 
implemented energy efficiency program as 
well as - in case of PRCP - aligned with the 
government’s program to improve living 
conditions in the Chernobyl affected area. 
Strong Government ownership ensured 
visible economic and social results of the 
IBRD’s assistance.   

SIRP included a tariff and subsidy study, 
but project rightly did not require changes 
in energy pricing and subsidies, given the 
level of the IBRD's relationship with the 
country at the time of project preparation. 

A simple and well-focused design of SIRP 
and PCRP, backed up by TA, contributed to 
solid projects’ implementation.   

One of SIRP lessons is the importance of 
establishing baselines and targets already at 
the preparation stage. For example, social 
aspects of the project were not quantified in 
advance and were difficult to monitor and 
attribute to the project.  

Procurement under SIRP and PCRP was 
difficult as it included many sites widely 
dispersed 
throughout 
the country and 
contracts were too small for international 
bidders. The lesson is that in order to 
facilitate least-cost procurement and attract 
international bidders, 
the procurement 
approach needs to include: (i) the provision 
of workshops and information to local

2.2. Number of preferential consumers 
reduced (percent): 
• Baseline: 100 (2008) 
• Target: no less than 87 (2011)

achieved.

electricity and 45.6 percent for heating.  
In 2010 and 2011 planned residential

percent for electricity and 36.8 percent 
for heating in 2010 and further to 57.80 
percent for electricity and 17.98 percent 
for heating as of July 1, 2011.    

Outcome 2.2 has been achieved. The 
number of preferential consumers fell 
from 149 companies in 2008 to 130 in 
2009 (by 13 percent). In 2010 and 2011 
the number of preferential recipients 
dropped to 108 and 53 companies or by 
28 percent and 65 percent vis-à-vis the 
2008 baseline, accordingly.  

Outcome 3:Reduction of health risks 
for people living in Chernobyl affected 
area due to exposure to radiation 
contaminated wood. 

Outcome 3 has been achieved.

extended to 3,774 under PCRP and

bidders to inform them about the Bank’s 
procurement procedures and determine the 
reasons for their lack of interest or failure to 
bid; and (ii) revision of conditions and 
terms of the bidding documents to elicit a 
sufficient number of bids. 
The risks of changing macroeconomic 
policies were underestimated. The efforts to 
carry out some of the reforms the program 
supported have been put in jeopardy by the 
loose macroeconomic policies carried out 
after March 2010 when the IMF Stand-by 
Arrangement expired. The 
increases 
in 
cross-subsidies in the energy sector also 
undermined 
the 
achievement of 
the 
program. As indicated in the DPL ICR, the 
WBG - in the future - should make a more 
forceful statement on the inconsistencies 
between the unsustainable macroeconomic 
policies and the structural reform agenda.  

The main lesson is that if the Government 
cannot ensure a suitable macroeconomic 
framework 
in 
the medium 
term, 
the 
medium-term effectiveness of a WBG 
supported reform program can be weakened 
or outcomes reversed. Prior actions are 
unlikely to mitigate the risk to reform 
program caused by the lack of financial 
discipline and - as a result - the Bank has to 
be more realistic in assessing limitations of 
the 
political 
economy 
of 
expected 
outcomes.  

In addition to the lessons listed above under 
Outcome 1, another important factor that 
contributed to meeting Outcome 3 was the 
Government’s commitment to limit the 
health risk of radiation and to improve 
standard of living in the affected areas. The 
financial 
commitment

effected 
households to cover part of the costs of

improved. 
Improved access of urban population to

Discharge of wastewater with BOD levels 
in excess of 15 mg/l reduced in project

Share 
of 
urban 
population with 
centralized water supply (percent): 
• Baseline: 90 (2008) 
• Target: 97 (2011) 

Outcome 4 has not been achieved. 
Progress under Bank-financed Water 
Supply and Sanitation Project - the 
main vehicle for this outcome - has 
been slower than expected. Moreover, 
CAS outcome and the original project 
results framework were poorly aligned.  
The project was 
restructured 
in 
December 2012, and the works are to 
be completed by 
the new project 
closing date of December 31, 2014. 
Once completed, 
the project will 
increase access to water supply services 
and improve the quality of water supply 
and wastewater services in selected 
urban areas in six oblasts.

A Mid-Term Review identified insufficient 
level of public awareness regarding the 
gasification process and the selection of 
households in some areas. This required 
improved communication and outreach 
efforts in project area.   
The lesson learned is the importance of 
having 
realistic, quantifiable outcome 
indicators prior to implementation - the 
project’s results framework failed to capture 
outcomes supported by project activities. 

Poor readiness was at the core of delays in 
implementation 
of WSSP. By 
the 
effectiveness date feasibility studies and 
design documents had been prepared for 
only half of 21 
sub-projects. This 
considerably slowed down implementation 
and disbursement. Moreover, fragmentation 
of investments supported by WSSP across 
too many sites 
limited developmental 
impact 
and 
contributed 
to 
slow 
implementation pace.  

Working with inexperienced agencies in 
decentralized 
setting 
proved 
to 
be 
particularly challenging. The 
lack of 
capacity in a new implementing agency was 
exacerbated by the need to work with 
multiple foreign consultants and local site 
owners.   

WSSP focused entirely on priority physical 
investments and did not address the issues 
of sector efficiency and sustainability. 
Going forward, systemic causes of sector 
inefficiencies need 
to be addressed 
to 
ensure services sustainability. The recently 
launched Municipal Water Sector Review is 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
an important first step in engaging in 
institutional and regulatory modernization 
of water sector. 

Weak implementation capacity (in analysis 
of project design options, procurement and 
contract management) for ISWMP at the 
central and local levels led to significant 
delays in project implementation.  

Although newly appointed local authorities 
developed ownership of the project after 
intensive 
implementation 
support 
and 
supervision 
activities, 
changes 
of 
counterparts caused delays since it required 
additional time to familiarize them with the 
project. Better coordination between central 
and local authorities to facilitate decision 
making will be crucial 
to 
improve 
implementation.  

Work on 
simplification of business 
environment was 
client-driven; 
the 
counterparts facilitated access to data and 
information, provided timely feedback and 
suggestions for the issues to be covered.  

Integrative approach was crucial: EWS and 
TA tasks were part of the integrated macro-
structural 
dialogue. This

to

inspection 
for 
individual 
entrepreneurs does not exceed 15 days.  

Outcome 5.2 has been achieved.  Since

the number of 
economic activities subject to licensing 
requirements was reduced, as were 
simplified 
licensing procedures and 
requirements. The time to get a license

List 
of 
Administrative 
Procedures

increasingly 
difficult 
to 
persuade

pursue further reform and simplification.  

In general, the Doing Business indicators 
have provided a good window to engage the 
Government on several issues. However, 
the use of Doing Business indicators as 
performance benchmarks for senior officials 
makes the temptation to game the indicators 
strong; with weak incentives to undertake 
comprehensive

reforms 
instead. 

Regulatory reforms are starting 
to be 
hindered by the lack of administrative

tape and

been eliminated since 2010. In 2011, 
local tax on services, local fee for 
territorial development 
and 
three 
payments within the environmental tax 
were eliminated. This contributed to 
overall tax burden decrease from 47.6 
percent in 2008 to 34.7 percent of GDP 
in 2011.  

These results have been confirmed by 
improved ranking on paying taxes by 
DB13.

in 
this area was continuous

to combine the advantages of analysis and 
just-in-time advice, obtain early feedback 
and increase the overall impact of AAA.

controls and 
regulated trade margins. 

8.1. Share of regulated socially important 
goods and services in CPI basket reduced 
(percent): 

         Baseline: 10.4 (2008) 
         Target: less than 9.2 (2009) 

8.2. Launch 
dialogue 
to 
increase 
efficiency in agriculture sector through 
move towards market-based pricing and 
reduction of state control over farm 
management. 

Outcome 8.1 has been partially 
achieved. Between 2008 and early 
2011, 
the price 
liberalization was 
implemented through (i) eliminating 
the requirements for price registration 
and removing administrative limits on 
increases in prices, (ii) removal of retail 
trade margins 
for domestic 
and 
imported goods (excluding a limited 
list of socially important goods and 
goods subject to monopoly power), and 
(iii) reducing 
the 
list of socially-
important goods and services subject to 
administrative price controls. 

The share of socially-important goods 
and services in CPI basket was reduced 
from 10.4 percent in 2008 to 9.2 
percent in 2009 as the number of 
socially important service categories 
was reduced by half.    
Belarus was upgraded in the EBRD 
index of price liberalization in 2009 
(for the first time since 2001) from 2.7 
to 3.0 and further to 3.3 in 2010. 

Price 
liberalization was 
partially 
reversed in 2011 when some temporary 
price 
control 
measures 
were 
(re)introduced 
in 
response 
to 
the 
macroeconomic crisis. According to the 
2012 IMF Article IV Staff Report, in 
2011 the list of socially important 
goods subject to price controls was 
expanded to cover 25-30 percent of the 
consumer price basket. 

In 2012, 
the government 
started 
developing a regulation that would 
cancel previously 
introduced price 
controls and bring its policy in this area 
in 
proximity with much more

term effectiveness of the WBG supported 
reform program 
is posed by changing 
macroeconomic policies and 
lack of 
coherent implementation of the structural 
reform agenda.  
Going forward, the WBG may consider a 
more programmatic policy engagement with 
a focus on a medium-term perspective. This 
may help ensure the depth and continuity of 
structural reform efforts and thus would 
reduce the risk of serious policy reversals.  
Heightened attention to a medium-term 
macroeconomic 
framework would be 
critical 
to ensure sustainability of any 
structural reforms program supported by the 
Bank. 

So 
far 
the 
IDF 
for Monitoring and 
Evaluation 
of 
Agricultural 
Policy 
Instruments 
(2011) has had marginal 
support of the Ministry of Agriculture and 
Food which is the main policy maker in 
agricultural reforms area. The lesson is that 
the limited impact was mostly due to the 
selection of the research institute as a 
counterpart rather than working directly 
with the ministry.

accountability, and efficiency of the 
privatization process improved. 

9.1. Improved legislative framework for 
privatization prepared: (i) establishing 
clear procedures for privatization of state-
owned enterprises; (ii) reducing list of 
enterprises not subject to privatization. 

9.2. New 
independent privatization 
agency established and operational. 

liberalized 
regimes of Russia and 
Kazakhstan. Still, the share of the 
goods and services controlled by the 
Government remains significant. 

Outcome 8.2 has been partially 
achieved: the dialogue launched in the 
process 
of 
preparation 
and 
dissemination 
of 
Agriculture 
Competitiveness Note has not yet been 
continued.    
Outcome 9 has been partially 
achieved.  
Outcome 9.1 has been partially 
achieved. In 2008 the golden share rule 
was abolished, and the moratorium on 
the sale of individual shares and the 
requirement to sell shares to workers 
was lifted.  The list of SOEs eligible for 
privatization and unitary enterprises 
due 
for 
corporatization 
expanded 
significantly. The earlier narrow lists of 
SOEs 
to be privatized have been 
replaced with narrow lists of SOEs not 
to be privatized, making all other SOEs 
potential privatization candidates. The 
New Privatization Law was enacted in 
2010. However, the biggest and most 
expensive privatization cases have been 
decided in a non-transparent manner, 
outside the institutional privatization 
system. 

Efficiency of privatization process still 
has to be improved, as fewer than 
expected SOEs have been sold so far, 
and transactions in a transparent best-
practice way are yet to be concluded. 

Outcome 9.2 has been achieved. A new 
National Agency for Investment and 
Privatization (NAIP) was established

Support to the privatization process is very 
time consuming and requiring building trust 
and multi-faceted cooperation with 
the 
Government officials, privatization agency, 
privatized 
enterprises 
(managers 
and 
workers), consultants and investors. The 
IBRD’s support has been successfully 
focused on introducing the best practices in 
privatization 
of 
the medium-sized 
enterprises. Neither the IBRD nor the IFC 
have enough leverage to be a partner in 
privatization of 
large 
strategic SOEs 
without taking too much reputational risk. 

NAIP was established, staffed and became 
operational 
as 
a 
new 
vehicle 
for 
privatization with significant and hands-on 
support from the IBRD and IFC. The

and supported 
the WBG approach of 
starting institutional setup for privatization 
which has no burden of inefficient practices 
from the past. 

Project 
implementation 
showed 
that 
decisions made at the ministerial level are 
sometimes overturned or changed (at least 
temporarily) at the level of highest political 
authority.  This may affect agreements 
between the IBRD and counterparts, and 
can 
affect project 
execution. Future 
activities in the sector should try to address 
this risk by leaving enough flexibility in the 
projects to react to these changes whenever 
possible without 
recourse 
to project 
restructuring. 

The open and competitive international 
bidding process resulted in the recognition 
in Belarus that their system of artificially 
determining prices (based on the reference 
price system inherited from the past) may 
not give them good value for money.  The 
IBRD should bring this issue up with the 
Ministry of Finance who might be more 
interested in this subject than the Ministry 
of Transport and Communications.  

The local State-owned construction firms 
should continue to stay eligible and be 
exposed to foreign competition; this will 
help them to become more competitive.     

under the MOE in 2010 and became 
operational in 2011.  The capacity of 
NAIP to implement privatization has 
yet to be demonstrated by bringing to 
the point of sale 
the 
first eight 
companies selected for privatization 
under the WB supported privatization 
program TA.   
Outcome 10 has been achieved. 
Outcome 10.1 has been achieved. The 
Government has adopted the equivalent 
of the Transport Sector Strategy and 
Investment 
Program. The Bank 
completed a Transport Sector Note 
focused on transport sector efficiency. 
The Government mobilized 
internal 
and external financing for significant 
road and rail investments. It supports a 
balanced approach in transport sector 
development, with investments in roads 
and 
in railway modernization and 
logistics. 

Outcome 10.2 has been achieved.  In 
2010, 
the Road Upgrading 
and 
Modernization 
Project 
(RUMP) 
upgrading a strategic Trans-European 
Transport Corridor IX connecting the 
Black Sea with the Baltic countries, 
was approved and has made very good 
progress.   

The Government decided to accelerate 
the 
introduction of electronic road 
tolling 
system, which 
originally 
planned 
to be designed under 
the 
RUMP and in February 2012 signed a 
concession contract for the construction 
and operation during 20 years of an 
electronic state-of-the-art road tolling 
system for trucks on the most important 
roads of Belarus. The system should be

Starting from 2008, privileges based 
DPL (FY10) 
programs were replaced with TSA and 
child benefits with much higher 
targeting efficiency. The Government 
has scaled up and broadened these 
programs in response to the crisis. To 
provide adequate resources for 
the 
expanded TSA, budget expenditures on 
it doubled in 2009 compared to 2008.

All milestones on strengthening of the

under the 2009 DPL by the adoption of 
the Presidential Decree No.458 on 
September 15, 2009, in effect since 
January 1, 2010.   

Given the breath of the reform agenda in 
this area, the IBRD should maintain a 
flexible approach to effectively accompany 
the authorities in surmounting the reforms’ 
implementation hurdles.  

With not sufficient institutional capacity to 
carry out a broad reform program (e.g., 
social assistance) the IBRD should be ready 
to provide proper and timely technical 
assistance.  

Selection of sectors for PER should be 
better consulted and upfront agreed with the 
client. In this case, the sectors were selected 
by the Bank team, as a priority from the 
fiscal adjustment point of view (pensions 
and SA). However, when PER was done, 
the counterpart was not really ready to 
move on these sectors and only now is 
ready to move on SA reforms, though not 
yet on pensions. (The two PER chapters on 
pension and SA provided the evidence basis 
and policy framework which will be used, 
sooner or later, whenever these reforms will 
be undertaken. So they are useful to the 
Government anyway).

2009. However, with expiration of the 
IMF SBA and suspension of the budget 
support by the Bank, further results on 
the ground have been uneven. While 
direct lending has been curtailed via 
tighter budgetary constraints as part of 
fiscal policy, a new special financial 
agency has not been established, as 
planned. Accordingly, NPLs under 
directed lending programs have not 
been removed from the balance sheets 
of major state banks. IFC successfully 
provided advisory support to several 
private sector banks, which are not 
engaged 
in directed 
lending, on 
improving risks management practices 
and NPL resolution. 
Outcome 13 has been partially 
achieved. 
Belarus scores above regional averages 
on five of the six PEFA dimensions. 
For policy-based budgeting, Belarus 
scores less well primarily as other 
countries started introducing MTEFs 
earlier 
and 
are 
further 
in 
implementation. 

Introduction 
of Medium 
Term 
Expenditure Framework (MTEF) for 
policy-based budgeting has not been 
achieved mostly due to incompatibility 
of MTEF three-year framework with 
the existing practice of five years 
planning cycle which is legally binding 
for the Government. The adoption of 
the new regulation stipulating 3-year 
rolling macroeconomic framework as a 
basis for MTEF was postponed. This 
happened not only due to domestic 
policy decision but also due to the fact 
that many countries in the region and 
world-wide postponed the introduction 

57 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
of the MTEF in the context of high 
global macroeconomic uncertainties 
and volatilities of the past 3-4 years. 

Out of 35 parameters Belarus scored A 
(reflects sound practice) on 9 and D 
(suggests deficiency in performance) 
on 12 indicators. Although the Ministry 
of Finance started the preparation of the 
medium-term 
debt 
management 
strategy (MTDS) in late 2008, the 
explicit requirement to do so was 
absent in legislation at the time of 
DeMPA mission. In 2012 the Debt 
Management Department requested a 
joint Bank-Fund technical assistance 
mission to develop an MTDS. 
Outcome 14 has been partially 
achieved.

Despite a remarkable progress in 
reducing energy intensity (EI) (by 
67% in 2010 relative to1990), 
Belarus is still lagging behind the 
EU.  In 2010, Belarus EI was 0.23 
toe/thousand of 2005 USD of GDP 
(PPP); (compared to 0.15 in 
Poland; Germany – 0.12). Belarus 
is behind EU 27 countries, for 
which the average EI is 0.13 
toe/thousand of 2005 USD of GDP 
(PPP) 

Belarus ranks among the top 30 
GHG emitters worldwide.

Annex 3: Overview of Main Trust Funds in Belarus 

1. 
Trust Funds resources made notable contribution to the CAS FY08-11 outcomes as they 
were closely integrated into the core program of the World Bank Group, linked to the analytical work and 
responded to the country priorities, including strengthening institutional capacity and contributing to a 
dialogue on tackling present macroeconomic vulnerabilities and advancing economic liberalization; 
increasing efficiency of resource allocation,  building statistical capacity, addressing energy efficiency 
and renewable energy, hazardous waste management, and  forestry and agriculture issues.  

2. 
The Trust Funds portfolio increased to 17 grants totaling USD 16 million in FY13, managed 
by the Bank and IFC, up from 4 programs totaling USD 3.5 million in FY08 and 4 programs totaling 
USD 2.2 million in FY10. Partnership with other donors resulted in leveraging funds for technical 
assistance and advisory services but also for project preparation and co-financing, including financing 
from United States Agency for International Development (USAID), Swedish International Development 
Cooperation Agency (SIDA), Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Federal Ministry of Finance of Austria, 
multilateral grant facilities, such as ESMAP, SAFE, and grants from TFSCB, IDF and GEF.  

3. 
Trust Fund to help Strengthen Financial Management Performance and Accountability (SAFE) 
was part of on-going dialogue on PFM issues across the budget cycle with a particular focus on 
improving medium-term fiscal planning and supporting introduction of output based financing 
arrangements in education and health sectors.   

4. 
Privatization TA, financed by the Federal Ministry of Finance of Austria, is another key product 
with the implementation period FY11-FY16. It is focused on providing advice on legal and institutional 
instruments and implementation capacity building to successfully launch and roll out a privatization 
program consistent with international best practice.  

5. 
IFC in partnership with the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA), the 
United States Agency for International Development (USAID), and the Ministry of Finance of Austria is 
implementing Regulatory Simplification and Investment Generation Advisory Project in Belarus to help 
the country improve its business and investment climate.  

6. 
Technical assistance, training, and key advisory services aimed at strengthening medium-term 
fiscal planning processes were provided under a Strengthening Accountability and the Fiduciary 
Environment (SAFE) grant.  Trust Fund for Statistical Capacity Building (TFSCB) supported an 
introduction of a regular National Labor Force Survey—a priority area for the development of the 
country’s statistics—providing relevant, precise, and complex statistical information on labor conditions, 
economic activity, employment, and unemployment.  

7. 
Under a Biomass-Based District Heating Program (ESMAP), experts are looking at existing 
legislation on renewable energy, barriers and options for increased use of biomass energy for heat 
production, and energy efficiency, as well as opportunities to increase private sector participation in the 
sector.  

8. 
Belarus is an active participant of the Forest Law Enforcement and Governance (FLEG), an EU-
funded, six-country regional program coordinated by the World Bank. The program promotes sound and 
sustainable forest management practices, including the reduction of illegal forestry activities.

Annex 4: Findings from IEG Evaluations, Client Surveys and Stakeholder 
Consultations 

Stakeholder Consultations  

1. 
CAS Completion Report discussions and CPS visioning meetings were held with small groups 
of targeted counterparts with day-to-day experience of working with the World Bank Group. The 
stakeholders shared their views regarding key priority areas for the next four years and the role of the 
Bank in addressing them.  
2. 
The outcomes of the meetings were important for outlining the CPS concept and developing 
a three pillar approach verified during subsequent consultations with representatives of the authorities, 
business unions, academia, civil society organizations and the donor community in early 2013. A strategic 
dialogue with the Intergovernmental CPS Working Group provided a platform for discussing the needs of 
the country and the ways of addressing expectations in the framework of a future partnership.  
3. 
Consultations with wider groups of multi-stakeholders across regions included a series of 
face-to-face meetings with central and local authorities, public professionals, parliamentarians, civil 
society organizations, students and academia, private sector, development partners, and beneficiaries of 
World Bank Group’ supported programs carried out in January-April 2013.The discussion focused on 
opportunities in such areas as economic competitiveness, human development, improvement of 
infrastructure services and global public goods, gender, approaches to supporting the governance and 
social accountability agenda, the existing mechanisms and possible new frameworks for participation of 
beneficiaries in World Bank Group supported programs. Discussions at regional level were centered on 
regional development issues, results and effectiveness of programs supported by the Bank, and ways 
beneficiaries could be informed about its programs and participate in monitoring service delivery.  
4. 
Overall, participants of the consultations agreed with the CPS approach and rationale and 
outlined the following key areas of focus for the WBG partnership with Belarus: quality of life, municipal 
sector services, education and employment, private sector’s role, efficiency of resource allocation, public 
administration, climate change, renewable energy, and forestry and agriculture. They emphasized the 
importance of taking into account the specifics of the country, providing technical assistance and advice, 
and sharing regional and global expertise and knowledge.  
5. 
Many stakeholders stressed that the key issue for the Government was to improve the 
competitiveness of the private sector and reduce the role of the state, and that the country 
modernization agenda should be used in the dialogue on enhancing management efficiency, restructuring, 
promotion of private sector development, and reducing the dominating role of the state. WTO accession 
could become a driving force to liberalize the economy and develop private participation.  
6. 
It was noted that social agenda is an important element of economic transformation, and the 
country needs international experience and best practices on social reforms, in particular on integration of 
education and labor issues, restructuring of enterprises with due account of social aspects, ways to 
improve labor force mobility inside the country, and developing incentives for families to increase birth 
rate. It was recommended that the Bank pay closer attention to health, education and social protection 
areas. 
7. 
The participants admitted successful earlier cooperation in the area of environment and 
forestry development, and importance of regional cooperation, as one of the participants put it “forest 
cannot be divided by borders” suggesting to strengthen cross-country exchanges and coordination. 
Representatives of the civil society proposed to include information and awareness raising 
8. 
components in every project, more effectively use available mechanisms of public participation (e.g. 
public hearings, as the legislation provides for participation in decision-making and consultations) and 
develop instruments for beneficiaries’ engagement in monitoring and assessing the provision of services 
in projects supported by the WBG, thus contributing to improving results and enhancing dialogue with 
authorities and service providers on beneficiaries’ needs. Improving accountability in service delivery is 

70 

very important but it was admitted that there is neither experience nor technologies on how to introduce 
them and involve local communities.  
9. 
CSO representatives requested the Bank to reinforce its role as a facilitator between CSOs 
and authorities on development issues, directly engage with CSOs in implementation of programs 
and projects and do it more systematically across the following areas (i) quality of life, (ii) environment; 
(iii) renewable energy, and (iv) climate change, noting that energy efficiency is an example of positive 
cross-sector cooperation.  
10. 
Topical webpages in Russian and English on the World Bank country internet site were 
launched, containing information about results of the World Bank Group support to the country, 
proposed priorities for the CPS to provide a channel to participate in discussion to parties not involved in 
face-to-face consultations and ensure that information about the CPS reaches all interested.  

Client Opinion Survey 

11. 
In January 2013, a client survey about stakeholders’ views of the World Bank and its work 
in Belarus identified a significant role for the Bank in Belarus and suggested areas for improvement 
in the mid-term.  One hundred ninety stakeholders - drawn from a range of central and local state 
institutions, implementing agencies, civil society, media, privates sector, academia, beneficiaries and 
international agencies – were invited to provide their opinions on the Bank’s assistance to the country. A 
total of one hundred fifteen stakeholders participated in the country survey (61percent response rate). 
Participants in the survey were drawn from among the central and local authorities; project management 
units, overseeing implementation of projects supported by the Bank; local government officials; bilateral 
and multilateral agencies; private sector organizations; private banks; CSOs; 
the media; 
academia/research institutes/think tanks; and program beneficiaries. Respondents were asked about the 
country development challenges and priorities, familiarity with the World Bank and their overall attitude 
toward the institution, the Bank’s effectiveness and results in Belarus, the role the Bank should play in 
Belarus’s development in the near future, and communication and information sharing. The main findings 
are summarized in the text box below. 

Independent Evaluation Group recommendations 

12. While reviewing the lessons of projects completed during the lifetime of FY08-FY11 CAS, the 
Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) emphasized the importance for program success of ensuring the 
Government’s commitment, selecting projects with visible economic and social benefits, and quantifying 
outcome indicators at design stage.   IEG also pointed out significance of associated technical assistance 
and sufficient capacity development to carry out reform programs. Proper macroeconomic framework 
was noted as critical for the medium-term effectiveness of the WBG supported reforms. 

71 

CLIENT OPINION SURVEY MAIN FINDINGS 
Overall results suggest that private sector development and such areas as economic growth, 
competitiveness and diversification, foreign direct investment, transformation of state-owned 
enterprises, and energy are perceived to be the top development priorities for the country, and key 
drivers to improving people’s lives in Belarus. Respondents see a critical role for the Bank in these top 
priority areas related to private sector development and areas related to public sector reform, social 
protection, and environmental sustainability in terms of Bank financial resources and knowledge 
products. These choices are consistent with the priorities identified in this CPS and the findings of the 
CAS Completions Report.  
While two thirds of respondents believe that the Bank’s most effective instrument in helping to 
promote development and reduce poverty in Belarus is investment lending, the survey findings suggest 
that technical assistance, capacity development, and knowledge products are valued highly in the 
country. Respondents are quite positive about the substance and technical quality of the Bank’s 
knowledge work (research, data, conferences, etc.), including its accessibility, usefulness, relevance, 
and adaptability to country’s specific development challenges and would like to see more attention 
given to dissemination of the knowledge work and its contribution to good policy making. 
The survey findings suggest that the Bank’s greatest strength as an effective development partner is 
related to the way it collaborates with the Government. The Bank receives high ratings in areas such as 
staff accessibility, following through over time, straightforwardness and honesty. The areas worth 
further consideration are related to greater flexibility in terms of Bank’s products and services and 
changing country circumstances. 
With more than forty percent of stakeholders noting that the way the Bank can be of greater value in 
Belarus is to reach out more to groups outside of government, and the survey findings strongly suggest 
that the more stakeholders engage with the Bank, the more positive they are about most indicator 
measurements in the survey, such as overall effectiveness, staff capability, collaboration, etc. This 
analysis supports continued strategic efforts to engage with key stakeholders and beneficiaries of the 
programs, to ensure productive collaboration and partnerships that lead to more effective development 
results on the ground. 
About ninety percent of respondents get most of information about economic and social development 
issues in Belarus from Internet, however top three preferable ways of getting information from the 
Bank also include seminars and direct contacts with Bank representatives, apart from online resources. 
Only one percent of participants would like to receive information about the Bank from social media.

Key Issues Raised 

Suggestions/Recommendations 

Sector/ 
Issue 
Social issues/ 
employment 

Social reform agenda is an important element of economic 
reforms.  

Support is needed in deinstitutionalized social services to the elderly and 
the disabled.  
Pension system should address the issue of aging and shrinking of the 
labor force.   
WBG should provide methodological and advisory support and sharing 
best practices on employment with the focus on: 
• 
employment policies in the context of enterprise restructuring and 
labor shedding  
• matching labor market needs and education sector  
• 
facilitation of self-employment for those who have lost their jobs as a 
result of restructuring  
• ways to improve labor force mobility inside the country 
Technical assistance and training for healthcare professionals on 
improving health care system financing and overall support to health 
financing reform was requested. 
It is important to bring international experience to improve the quality of 
education and the regulatory framework, develop per student financing 
formula, and provide training to the financial staff and school principals in 
using the formula. 
The quality of public administration should be a priority focus for WBG 
support.  
CSOs should become implementation agencies for state programs and get 
access to public funds. 
Public councils should become a promising mechanism of collaboration 
between the state and CSOs.  
WBG should create mechanisms for CSOs involvement in WBG-
supported projects. WBG should finance small local initiatives. 
WBG should facilitate establishing channels of citizens’ feedback on 
quality of services, bring experience and global best practices for 
participatory monitoring and beneficiaries’ involvement. 
Monitoring and evaluation mechanisms and criteria should be developed 
and introduced across the sectors.  

Health 

New approach to planning health expenditures is needed. 

Education  

Pilot on reforming education financing is to be launched. 

Governance 

Importance of participatory monitoring, encouraging 
accountability of the beneficiaries through transparency 
and empowerment was noted. 
Cooperation at the national level between the state agencies 
and CSOs varies from non-collaborative to systematic (e.g. 
Ministry of Natural Resources and Environmental 
Protection has a public advisory council providing a 
discussion platform for CSOs and state agencies). 
Local authorities are ready to cooperate with CSOs if they 
see a practical implication/solution to local issues.

Sector/ 
Issue 
Gender 

Transport  

Energy and 
energy 
efficiency 

Gender discrimination is often hidden and difficult to 
identify, measure and assess.  
Issue of domestic violence has received proper attention 
recently.  
Different fields of education and occupation result at 
difference in wages between men and woman.  
The country has a strong legacy of traditional gender roles.  
Road project supported by the Bank led to attraction of 
other investors.  
Price of houses along reconstructed roads (RUMP) has 
increased; their residents could take part in economic and 
financial activities. 
Energy efficiency measures get attention in all the regions. 
Belarus capacity in renewable energy is underestimated 
(solar, hydro, biogas). 

There is a need to develop gender disaggregated statistics 
Gender wage gap should be assessed. 
It is important to look carefully at life expectancy gap between men and 
women and international experience of addressing it.  
The public at large should be better informed about gender issues. 

WBG could contribute to developing regional cooperation e.g. road 
connections with Poland, Ukraine and other countries. 

It was recommended to enhance energy efficiency policy implementation, 
e.g. energy certification of buildings, involvement of citizens, awareness-
raising among general public, etc.  
WBG assistance in implementation of the new program of energy system 
development till 2016, in particular energy savings in electricity 
generation sector, was requested. 
It is important to ensure investments in: 
• 
using biomass in district heating systems 
• 
retrofitting energy efficiency infrastructure in social sector buildings  
• 
expanding the use of renewable energy (biogas) 
• 
building hydro power generation facilities 
WBG could provide support to modernization of Hydromet to bring the 
quality of the service to the EU standards. 

WBG investment to construction of forest roads, fire protection of forests, 
development of forest seed centers and nurseries, and use of wood chips 
for energy production was requested.  
WBG could promote knowledge exchange with the European neighbors 
on the up-to-date forest management practices. 

Environment  

Forestry  

Successful earlier cooperation - reconstruction of 
enterprises to eliminate ozone depleting substances; 
improved regulatory framework on environmental permits 
and POPs, etc. - was noted.  
IBRD supported Forestry project in 1990s and FLEG 
helped to train high-level specialists; they remained in the 
sector and held leading positions.  
New technologies and innovations do not work without 
training.

There is a strong need for cross-border decisions.  
Forest is a strategic natural resource. Belarus plans to 
develop:  
• 
environmental tourism  
• wood chips 
fire protection 
• 
The country plans: 
• 
double output of milk and develop new milk farms 
• 
reduce energy consumption and costs in agriculture 
• modernize farms and processing enterprises 
• 
use alternative sources of energy 

The country is facing acute problems in rural territories and 
needs to develop their potential. 
Directive #4 on liberalization of economy led to more 
active dialogue of the state with the business, although its 
norms are often neglected. 
There is reduction of tax burden on SMEs. 
Development of the service sector was noted.  
The 2011 crises took significant assets from private 
businesses. Wages growth with no growth of productivity 
could lead to another crisis. 
Wrong state policies to address inefficiencies (merging 
inefficient and efficient companies, unwillingness to 
privatize poorly managed facilities) raise serious concerns. 
It is difficult to get public support for privatization, to a 
certain extent resistance to reforms comes from the fact that 
state-owned-enterprises perform social functions.  
There is inconsistency between declaration and actions of 
the Government and policy reversals (nationalization of 
earlier privatized companies and increasing state assets). 
There are infringements at all government levels. 

75 

The WBG could support: 
• modernization of food processing industry  
access of agricultural products to Customs Union markets and the EU 
• 
market 
establishing a unified center for food products quality control 
harmonizing the national standards with those of the EU 

• 
• 

The key issue is to improve the competitiveness of the private sector and 
reduce the role of the state. 
Private business needs access to financial resources and protection of 
property rights. 
Modernization and attraction of investments could be achieved by 
privatization but it requires political will.  
WBG should contribute to increase the role of the private sector and 
continue dialogue on structural reforms taking into account experience of 
other countries.  
Professionals with technical skills to participate in competitive fields are 
needed as well as experts to prepare companies to privatization.  
Proposed amendments to the privatization law (state representatives in 
privatized companies) could be detrimental to private business 
development and attraction of investors.  

 
 
 
 
Sector/

Key Issues Raised 

Suggestions/Recommendations 

Business community presented to the Government 
recommendations for private sector development based on 
WBG advice; however, most of them failed to be  reflected 
the private enterprise development program adopted in 
2012. 

Financial and 
Fiscal 

Statistics  

Civil Society CSOs rely on membership fees and donations; international 
support requires registration; CSO economic activity is not 
allowed; and activity of non-registered organizations is 
prohibited.  
Law on social services is a mechanism of public order for 
social contracting, but there is a lot of skepticism about its 
enforcing.  
Resolving issues at the community level (elderly people, 
disabled) require systemic approach, the country’s social 
services are not ready to respond to them. 

76 

• 

• 

Suggestions for the WBG support:  
• 
development of financial market legislation, securities market, 
insurance market; leasing and banking regulations 
deepening cooperation on financial literacy, including special courses 
in primary school curriculum, textbooks and courses for unemployed 
on financial literacy 
assistance on simplification of the tax procedures based on ICT 
establishing tax consultancy and advisory service     
WBG could expand cooperation on assessing living standard and poverty 
level, labor force migration and introduction of national accounts 
methodology based on international standards  
It is important to maintain the practice of joint events with CSO and 
government representatives.  
Regulation of humanitarian and technical assistance and CSO registration 
should be simplified.    
It is critical to involve local authorities as partners and the Bank should 
work more with local authorities and arrange capacity building events for 
local communities, including local administration. 
It was recommended to include design of local development agenda as a 
requirement for IBRD supported operations. 
Hands-on training for CSOs on getting information on operations 
supported by the WBG was requested.  

 
 
 
 
 
Annex 5. Gender Assessment Summary 

Belarus has invested significantly in the human capital of its population—both in men and women. This 
continued and significant investment in health and education has helped to close gender gaps in key areas 
of primary and secondary schooling and women’s access to maternal and child care. Also, as a result of 
the socialist legacy, women’s participation in the labor market has been long standing. The legal 
framework governing men and women’s employment is “gender blind”. In addition, the laws do 
acknowledge women’s role in child bearing and there are sensible benefits related to parental leave (for 
both women and men).  
Gender disparities are best understood by analyzing men and women’s (human capital) endowments and 
economic opportunities. The dialogue can also be broadened to discuss the institutional framework, social 
norms and agency as factors which shape women’s and men’s ability to act independently. By covering 
these three aspects, we are able to obtain a useful overview of the main gender gaps that remain in 
Belarus.  Yet all of this should be considered against the backdrop of a society facing a demographic 
transition and a rapidly aging society. Belarus’s main challenges in gender equity remain in access to 
economic opportunities and agency.  
Endowments. Gender gaps in education are not large at the school level, but men begin to lag 
behind at the tertiary level. There are no gender gaps in gross primary and secondary enrollment rates, 
which are about 100 percent. Yet, women are more likely to continue on into higher education and a large 
gender gap in favor of women exists (100 and 71 percent for women and men, respectively). However, 
female students in particular are concentrated in tertiary subjects that are not well suited to the demands 
of the labor market. Women are also less likely than men to receive vocational training, which 
compounds the occupational segregation that is prevalent in Belarus’s labor market (NSC 2010).  
Women’s health indicators are relatively strong for an upper middle income country, but men’s life 
expectancy is low. There is a large gender gap of 12 years in life expectancy, which is 65 for men and 77 
for women (WDI 2012). Unhealthy and risky behaviors among men lead to notably higher mortality rates 
from cardiovascular diseases and injuries (WHO 2012). On the positive side, maternal and infant 
mortality rates have improved in the past decade and are now comparable to those of developed countries 
(WDI 2012).  However, about 70 percent of women are ill during pregnancy (NSC 2011). This in addition 
to the male mortality rates indicate that the Government may wish to focus on improving the quality of 
existing health services and their accessibility. 
Economic Opportunities. The gender gap in labor market participation in Belarus is relatively low 
compared to other upper middle income countries, but this is driven by below average male 
participation. In first quarter 2012, the female and male participation rates were 62 and 69 percent 
respectively for persons between the ages of 15-64 years. The key issues facing women in the labor 
market are occupational segregation and lower earnings. The raw monthly wage gap in Belarus was 
estimated at 26.3 percent in 2011 and only a small share of this can be explained by observable 
characteristics. Though it is difficult to identify the reasons for women’s lower earnings, possible causes 
include the need for women to balance their domestic responsibilities with the demands of work. 
Moreover, though child care is available, there are wide regional disparities in the availability of pre-
school education.  
Women’s employment benefits have mixed impacts on their careers and long term welfare. In 
Belarus, women are entitled to 126 days paid maternity leave—which is not overly generous. However, 
employers are obliged to keep women’s jobs open (while on leave for family reasons) for up to three 
years, and this may hurt their employment opportunities. Women also have a lower retirement age (55 
years) compared to men (60 years). The earlier retirement age for women adversely affects career 
progression and wages—and ultimately their pension income. This latter impact is especially detrimental 
to women’s welfare since they have longer life expectancy and higher pension income would be 
important for warding off poverty in old age. 
Agency. Though women are earners and well-educated, they continue to face gender based 
exploitation in some key areas. On the one hand, women in Belarus are in a stronger position than 

77 

women in the ECA region. For example, one out of four formal sector firms have a woman as a top 
manager (BEEPS, 2009) compared to only 19 percent for the region. Also, women hold one third of the 
seats in Parliament and are also well represented in mid-level positions in sub-national governments. 
However, Belarus also faces problems with human trafficking. According to the United States 
Department of State (2011), Belarus is a source, destination, and transit country for persons (especially, 
women) subjected to sex trafficking and forced labor. Another problem women face is domestic violence, 
though there is no robust data that quantifies the extent of the problem. However, opinion polls show that 
there is a high societal tolerance for domestic violence. The legal support for victims may improve with 
the adoption of the drafted Law on Prevention of Domestic Violence, which outlines specific rights for 
victims to assistance, protection, and compensation (CEDAW 2011).
