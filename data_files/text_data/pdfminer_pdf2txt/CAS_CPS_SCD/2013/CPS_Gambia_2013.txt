ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS  

The World Bank Group (WBG) and the African Development Bank (AfDB) greatly appreciate the close 
and fruitful collaboration with the Government of The Gambia in the preparation of this Joint Partnership 
Strategy.  

The preparation of the JPS document was a team effort by both organizations’ country teams for The 
Gambia.  Many team members made substantial contributions by drafting parts of the document, 
participating in review meetings and providing comments and advice. Special thanks go to Annette De 
Kleine Feige, World Bank Senior Economist for The Gambia, for her tremendous support during the 
finalization phase of this document, Rory O’Sullivan, Consultant, who helped in the initial stages of the 
document preparation, Victor Wahba, Consultant, who elaborated the JAS-1 Completion Report,  Upulee 
Dasanayake, Consultant/Operations Analyst, for her patience in updating the document and her detailed 
editorial support, and Anta Loum Lo for editing and finalizing the Board package. Last but not least, 
special thanks to Badara Joof, World Bank Liaison Officer in Banjul, for his extremely valuable support in 
facilitating multi-stakeholder consultations and dialogue with Government authorities throughout the full 
process of strategy preparation.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

i. 
The Gambia has had strong economic performance in recent years with average 
annual real GDP growth of 6-7 percent during 2008-2010. But it has since dropped to 3.5 - 4 
percent in 2012. Effects of the global financial crisis of 2008 were tempered by good agricultural 
outputs in the same period, and by increased tourism receipts. Overall poverty rates declined from 
58 percent in 2003 to 48.4 percent in 2010, and education coverage and quality improved.  
Progress was made in the areas of public sector, economic and fiscal management, civil service 
and justice reform, anti-corruption and public procurement reform. Recent data show modest 
developments in health, notably on HIV/AIDS prevalence (which remains stable) and maternal 
mortality (which declined considerably). The Government is committed to consolidating these 
achievements while creating space for continued funding of poverty reduction programs.  
ii. 
As a small, open economy, however, The Gambia remains highly vulnerable to 
external shocks, given its relatively undiversified economic base. The Gambia is heavily 
dependent on rain-fed crops for agricultural production, on imports for food security, and on 
tourism receipts and remittances for foreign exchange earnings. The 2011-2012 Sahelian drought 
crisis caused massive crop losses, with related impacts on household food security and nutrition, 
the availability of seeds, and the balance of payments. GDP growth slowed to -4.3 percent in 2011 
(compared to 5.5 percent in 2010). And Gambian transit and re-export trade activity has been 
hampered by gains in competitiveness in neighboring countries, specifically Senegal, and the 
impacts of the most recent crises in Mali and Guinea-Bissau. Finally, the country’s vulnerability 
to climate change, land degradation and disaster risk explicitly highlights the need to promote and 
strengthen integrated management of the coastal zone and to protect and preserve biological 
diversity and ecological assets. 
iii. 
The Gambia faces three main challenges: 
a. Restoring growth and macroeconomic stability. This will require diversification of 
the economy and an improved private sector investment climate.  
b. Improving service delivery, through effective civil service reform including 
improved management capacity for strategic planning, performance measurement, 
and institutional coordination, collaboration and dialogue. 
c. Improving transparency and accountability in public financial management and 
public procurement. In particular, improving the demand side of public financial 
management by disseminating information to the public and creating a culture of 
accountability and citizen participation.  
iv. 
The second AfDB/WB Joint Partnership Strategy (JPS-2) for the 2013-16 period, in 
support of the Government’s 2012-15 Program for Accelerated Growth and Employment 
(PAGE)1 proposes to respond to these challenges by concentrating on two main pillars: 
Pillar 1:  
Enhancing Productive Capacity and Competitiveness in order to strengthen resilience to 
External Shocks. This pillar is aligned with elements of PAGE pillars I (Economic Growth), II 
(Infrastructure) and IV (Governance). 

viii	

	
	
	
 
 
Pillar 2:  
Strengthening the Institutional Capacity for Economic Governance and Public Service 
Delivery is aligned with elements of PAGE pillars III (Human Capital, Social Services), IV 
(Governance) and V (Social Cohesion, Cross-cutting interventions). 
The AfDB will focus on economic governance and agriculture, while the World Bank Group 
(WBG) will, in addition to these, focus on infrastructure, i.e. the energy sector and internet 
connectivity, human development, and private sector development.  
v. 
This Joint Strategy has been prepared and will be implemented jointly by the AfDB 
and the WBG to better harmonize the two institutions’ assistance to The Gambia in line with the 
2011 Busan Declaration on Aid Effectiveness. The Completion Report of the first Joint 
Assistance Strategy (JAS, 2008-11) concluded that this collaborative approach was successful in 
improving the impact of the development efforts by the two institutions – allowing them to align 
their development programs, avoid duplication of efforts, and combine their technical expertise. 
To this end, the WBG and the AfDB have been working together to develop shared objectives and 
a common platform for lending and non-lending activities during the coming JPS period.  
vi. 
Over the four year JPS period, about US$90 million in lending, supplemented by 
trust fund (TF) resources, will be available to support The Gambia’s PAGE. This support 
will be complemented by analytical work and other non-lending activities. The program design is 
currently based on the assumption of (a) a three-year (2012-14) African Development Fund 
(ADF) resource allocation for new commitments of UA3 million (equivalent to US$4.5 million) 
from ADF 12 available for 2012 and 2013; (b) UA 8 million (equivalent to US$12 million) from 
ADF 13 available for 2014 and 2015; and (c) an indicative IDA-16 allocation of SDR29.8 
million (equivalent to US$44.7 million) followed by estimated IDA-17 annual allocations of 
about US$14 million, supplemented by TF resources. 
vii. 
The proposed JPS-2 also takes into account the complementary efforts of other 
donors. As part of the program, both institutions will seek to strengthen their communication 
with other donors and help the Government improve donor coordination in the country. 
viii. Risks: The proposed program carries risks. The overall country risks are vulnerability 
to exogenous shocks and governance-related risks, notably with respect to accountability and 
transparency in the management of public resources. Major policy reversals and other unexpected 
decisions, such as the President’s temporary introduction in late October 2012 of a fixed exchange 
rate peg of the GMD to the US dollar is a cause of concern. The temporary lifting of the 
moratorium on capital punishment with the executions of nine death row inmates in August 2012, 
and the most recent introduction of a four-day work week for the public service represent 
challenges for the Government’s dialogue with internal  and external stakeholders. Those actions 
have reduced confidence in the Government’s commitment to its international agreements. These 
risks will be closely monitored by both Banks and their impacts on the joint program mitigated by 
continued strong collaboration with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the EU, and other 
donors on macro-economic management, program design and implementation support.

I. 

INTRODUCTION 
1. 
The Gambia is the smallest country on the African mainland. Its stretches 450 km 
along the Gambia River. Its 11,285 sq. km area is surrounded by Senegal, except for a 60 km 
Atlantic Ocean front. Although small in size, The Gambia harbors a wealth of land, coastal, 
marine and wetland habitats and species of local, national, regional and global significance, 
making Gambia an attractive tourist destination and, due to is unique geographic location, a hub 
for trade in the region.   
2. 
The country has a population of 1.8 million and a Diaspora of around 0.5 million. 
The current population has been growing at a fairly high rate of 2.8 percent per year over 
the last decade. Life expectancy at birth for the average Gambian is 58 years and 60 percent of 
the population is under 25 years of age. Most of the population (57 percent) is concentrated 
around urban and peri-urban centers. The main languages are English, Mandinka, Wolof, Jola and 
Fula, and 90 percent of Gambians are Muslim.  The Gambia has maintained a reputation of 
relative stability and peace, although its sub-region has been marked by recurring instability and 
conflict. The incumbent President2 Yahya A.J.J. Jammeh was re-elected for a fourth term on 
November 24, 2011, receiving 72 percent of the popular vote. 
3. 
The Gambia is facing serious challenges in achieving most of the Millennium 
Development Goals (MDGs). According to the World Development Indicators database, the 
poverty reduction goal at the poverty line of US$1.25 has been achieved. In terms of human 
development, The Gambia has achieved the MDGs related to gender parity in primary and 
secondary education, and to improved access to water sources. Progress towards all other MDGs 
is off-target.  The MDGs related to primary school completion rates (even though considerable 
progress has been made), infant and child mortality, measles vaccination and births not attended 
by skilled staff are seriously off-target, and will not be reached any time soon if current policies 
are continued and donor support is maintained at current levels (Annex 6). 
4. 
Regional integration and cooperation are extremely important for The Gambia, due 
to its limited surface area, population size and markets, and its geographical position as a 
semi-enclave into Senegalese territory. Any developments affecting the sub-region, specifically 
Senegal, affect the country’s growth prospects, the sustainability of its natural resource basis, and 
its political stability. The Gambia is a member of regional bodies such as the Economic 
Community of West African States (ECOWAS), and the Gambia River Basin Development 
Organization (OMVG). Based on its historic linkages to Great Britain, the Gambia is also a 
member of the (British) Commonwealth. Given its location, The Gambia will need to collaborate 
closely with Senegal to overcome two major hurdles that might hamper its integration in the sub 
region, namely the quality of Senegalese roads and the willingness of Senegalese authorities to 
facilitate transit trade.  
II. 

COUNTRY CONTEXT 

1.1 Economic Developments  

5. 
The Gambia’s average per capita GDP was US$610 in 2011 (Atlas Method). GDP 
composition by sector is depicted in Table 1 below for 2005-2012 The composition though stable 
can shift somewhat,  due to variations in crop production, but the broad proportions highlight the 
importance of the agriculture and trade (including tourism) sectors, and weak manufacturing 
activity.

The Gambia benefitted 
from considerable multilateral 
debt relief after reaching the 
HIPC Completion Point 
in 
December 2007. With HIPC 
completion, 
the country also 
became eligible for debt relief 
from the IMF, IDA, and the 
African Development 
Fund 
(ADF) under 
the Multilateral 
Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI). 
Total debt service savings under 
the MDRI will amount 
to 
approximately US$373.5 million 
in nominal terms until 2050. The total estimated nominal debt relief under both the Enhanced 
HIPC Initiative and the MDRI, on principal as well as interest payments is equivalent to about 
US$514 million.  
7. 
Fiscal discipline slipped in 2009 and 2010, but has since improved.  The deterioration 
was partly due to the unstable global environment and declining tourism receipts. But it also 
reflected an increase in tax exemptions on imports, and delays in adjusting the pump prices for 
petroleum products. In 2011, the Government generated a basic primary fiscal surplus3 estimated 
at 1.2 percent of GDP which is projected to rise to 1.6 percent in 2012, up from minus 0.4 percent 
in 2010. This has helped to contain the Government’s net domestic borrowing.  It also helped 
clear the Government’s overdraft with the Central Bank and, with that, marked an end to the 
Central Bank financing of the  deficit (see Table 2, below).   
8. 
Prudent fiscal management is particularly important given the country’s relatively 
high public debt to GDP ratio, with low maturity levels for domestic debt.  Foreign and 
domestic public debt remains high, notwithstanding the country having reached the HIPC/MDRI 
completion point at end 2007. The key exposure indicators of the IMF and WB show that total 
debt outstanding as a ratio to GDP declined from 143.2 percent in 2006 (pre-HIPC) to 55.1 
percent in 2008. However, it increased again to 68.4 percent in 2011, reflecting the combination 
of a fast-growing, high-cost, domestic public debt (29 percent of GDP), and a slow-growing, 
mostly concessional external public debt (39 percent of GDP). Thanks to improvements in its 
Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) rating, The Gambia has been upgraded to a 
medium performer, with higher policy thresholds for the assessment of the sustainability of its 
debt. There is now some scope for the government to borrow on non-concessional terms.  This 
and the inclusion of re-exports have resulted in a decrease in the risk of debt distress, from high 
debt distress to medium in 2012. However, near and medium-term external debt sustainability 
remains vulnerable to adverse shocks, and domestic debt is costly and poses high rollover risks. 
Further, it is important to note that active debt management – with a view to minimizing 
budgetary risks and ensuring long-term debt sustainability - is one of the criteria for the 
determination of the IDA and ADF Resource Allocation Indicators (RAI).

Large fiscal deficits in recent years have forced the Government to resort to 
borrowing from the domestic market where interest rates are high. Interest on foreign and 
domestic debt in 2011 accounted for an estimated 22.5 percent of public revenues with 18.5 
percent of revenues absorbed by domestic debt service alone. While the real yield on the total 
public debt is relatively low (averaging less than 5 percent), this average conceals the very high 
average interest rates on the domestic public debt (just under 9 percent). There is a significant 
domestic debt refinancing exposure.4  The average time to maturity of the external debt is 14.5 
years, whereas the average time to maturity of the stock of domestic debt is less than one year.  
As a result, the servicing of domestic public debt has crowded out private sector borrowing by 
putting upward pressure on domestic interest rates. This has also reduced the available revenues 
for development spending.  The Government is currently implementing a fiscal adjustment 
program aimed at reducing the net domestic borrowing to 0.5 percent of GDP by 2014.     
10. 
As part of the fiscal consolidation effort, a comprehensive tax reform program is 
being envisaged to help stabilize revenues. Actions are being taken to set limits on how tax 
exemptions are being awarded, to strengthen tax administration and to raise tax payer awareness 
of the application of tax laws and the coverage of the value-added tax (VAT).  These actions will 
be further strengthened by the establishment and institutionalization of the Tax Tribunal. Better 
and more frequent human resources planning for payroll management and control given the 
increase in the civil service over the last few years is under consideration. The validation of the 
Human Resource records in the Integrated Financial Management Information System (IFMIS) 
payroll module envisioned under the proposed grant would allow for the regularization of these 
records, with the removal of ghost workers and the elimination of vacant positions.  This will, in 
effect, strengthen the base for a more judicious management of the personnel records, including 
the inclusion of new entrants into the payroll, under the auspices of the Personnel Management 
Office. These actions will further safeguard the acceptable macroeconomic framework achieved 
in 2011.   

3 	

	
 
 
11. 
The IMF-supported Extended Credit Facility (ECF) program includes additional 
initiatives to maintain and enhance the country’s current fiscal discipline. Actions under the 
ECF program to increase tax revenue collection include the closer alignment of domestic fuel 
prices with international prices in 2012, and the introduction of the VAT in 2013. These and other 
actions will help to reduce annual domestic financing needs and create fiscal space for the 
implementation of the Program for Accelerated Growth and Employment (PAGE).  
12. 
The IMF postponed its First Review of the Extended Credit Facility from late-2012 
until early-2013, due to uncertainties about monetary policy implementation following the 
President of Gambia’s decree in October 2012 that introduced a fixed exchange rate peg and 
controls on US-dollar shipments. The controls on shipments were subsequently lifted within a 
week of the decree’s announcement and the exchange rate peg was lifted in November 2012 with 
the reintroduction of a market determined floating exchange rate. The IMF conducted a mission in 
December 2012 to assess the impact of the monetary policy shifts, and determined that exchange 
rate activity had largely returned to normal and that uncertainty pertaining to the recent policy 
shifts had diminished substantially. Nevertheless, market confidence in the Government’s 
commitment to the stated exchange rate policy has been eroded.  Confidence can only be regained 
over time by the Central Bank's ongoing commitment to the market determined exchange rate 
policy complemented by the gradual accumulation of international reserves to support 
macroeconomic stability. The IMF is finalizing the First Review of the ECF for Board Review. 
An Article IV mission is planned following the IMF-WB 2013 Spring Meetings, and the Second 
Review of the ECF is envisaged in fall 2013.  
13. 
The 
country 
remains 
highly vulnerable to external 
shocks, as key sources of foreign 
exchange earnings were hit hard 
by the global financial crisis: In 
aggregate, net receipts for travel 
services 
(tourism), 
worker 
remittances and 
foreign direct 
investment (FDI) have declined 
markedly to an estimated one-fifth 
of GDP (20 percent) in 2011 from 
more than one-fourth of GDP in 
2007 (27 percent) and nearly one-
third in 2006 (31 percent). Aside 
from providing valuable foreign 
exchange earnings, these inflows 
buoy activity 
in 
the domestic 
economy through various linkages; 
worker remittances and FDI, for 
example, 
provide 
significant 
support 
to 
domestic 
private 
consumption 
and 
investment, 
respectively. While the level of net 
tourism receipts are estimated to 
have recovered to the pre-crisis 

The Gambia is one of the most vulnerable countries in Africa to the 
adverse impacts of climate change. With approximately 50% of the 
total land area being less than 20m above sea level, and about 33% of 
the country below 10m above sea level, any significant global 
warming-induced sea level rise could submerge much of the country. 
Currently, about 20% of the country is flooded annually and the 
mangrove ecosystems are already affected by saline intrusion as well 
8.8mm per month per decade.  Projected annual change ranges from ‐
as flooding.  
Linear trends indicate that wet season rainfall in The Gambia has 
decreased significantly between 1960 and 2006, at an average rate of 
23 to +18% by the 2090s, with increasing occurrence of heavy rainfall 
events.  
Global warming and associated impacts of climate change, as well as 
projected extreme weather and climatic events will compound efforts 
to address the development challenges of the country in the face of 
rapid population growth: The country’s First National Communication 
projected that about 92 sq. km of land in the coastal zone will be 
inundated as result of 1m sea level rise. Accordingly, the whole of the 
capital city of Banjul will be lost due to the fact that the greater part of 
the city is below 1m. The report also predicts negative effects of 
projected climate change on crop production, biodiversity and wildlife, 
coastal resources, forestry etc. Effective adaptation to climate change 
and its mainstreaming into national development is a pre-condition for 
sustainable development.

14. 
The Gambia is also vulnerable as a result of its heavy reliance on rain-fed 
agriculture, which has led to wide variability in agricultural activity. The severe drought in 
2011 and concomitant 60 percent drop in crop production and depletion of seed stores are cases in 
point. Notably, with favorable weather conditions, the agriculture sector witnessed substantial 
growth in the years5 before the 2011 Sahelian drought which had buoyed domestic consumer 
demand and, with that, more than offset the negative impacts of the global economic crisis during 
2008 through 2010. The sector is characterized by subsistence production of rain-fed crops (such 
as coarse grains, rice, etc.) and semi-intensive cash crop production (groundnuts and vegetables). 
Groundnuts are the most important agricultural export, accounting for 60 percent of domestic 
exports. 
15. 
Food security in The Gambia is strongly dependent on imports. Cereal imports 
account for 50-60 percent of consumption needs and the average Gambian spends more than 60 
percent of his/her income on food in a normal year. The rising food prices since 2007 began on 
the heels of locust invasion and a series of droughts that affected both cereals and cash crop 
(groundnut) production. In light of rising prices of cereal crops many Gambians have faced 
serious hardships in terms of household food security. 
16. 
The Gambia’s coastal and marine areas, where a large proportion of the country’s 
population resides, are under increasing pressure. Population growth and in-migration as a 
result of disrupted rainfall patterns and land degradation in the hinterland translate into growing 
pressure on coastal and marine resources, including from sand mining, fishing, and clearing of 
forest and mangroves for use as domestic fuel. There is also evidence of significant pressure on 
species of global and regional concern6. With the further destruction of coastal areas, one of the 
country’s primary tourism attractions might be compromised, and with it, one of its major sources 
of revenues.

1.2  Political and Governance Context 

17. 
The Gambia is a presidential republic with a unicameral legislature. The incumbent 
President7 Yahya A.J.J. Jammeh, who originally took office in a bloodless coup in 1994, was re-
elected for a fourth term, with 72 percent of the vote, on November 24, 2011. Parliamentary 
elections took place on March 29, 2012, with the President’s party (the Alliance for Patriotic 
Reorientation and Construction, or APRC) maintaining its sizeable majority, with 43 seats in the 
53-seat National Assembly. 8 Most opposition parties boycotted the elections due to concerns 
related to the timing and context of the elections, and to what they perceived as an absence of a 
level playing field for competition in the election process. 9 Women continue to be under-
represented at all political levels.  
18. 
Progress has been made in selected areas of governance. In the face of still pervasive 
corruption 10 , the Government is in the process of establishing an Anti-Corruption Agency to 
coordinate and consolidate integrity activities within the public sector. Since the early 2000s, the 
country’s public procurement system has undergone substantial reforms 11 and there has been 
moderate progress in the field of justice.12 
19. While economic governance has been improving, political governance indicators 
have declined 13 , and recent major policy reversals have undermined confidence in the 
Government’s commitment to its international agreements. For example, The Gambia’s August 
2012 executions of nine death row inmates, including two Senegalese nationals, in breach of the 
Geneva Conventions and Cotonou Agreement, have unfavorably affected its relations with 
Senegal - even though the moratorium on capital punishment has been re-instated one month 
later. Another example is the President’s temporary introduction in late October 2012 of an ad-
hoc fixed exchange rate peg that risked the overall macro-framework and diminished confidence 
in The Gambia’s commitment to the ECF arrangement signed with the IMF earlier in 2012. 
20. 
The 2012 Mo Ibrahim Index of African Governance ranks The Gambia in the middle 
of the countries of the continent. The Gambia scores 51.6 (out of 100) for governance quality – 
slightly lower than the regional average for West Africa of 51.9 - and is ranked 27th out of 52 
countries. The Gambia ranks relatively well among its West African peers on the 2011 Global 
Gender Gap Index, at 77 (out of 135), ahead of neighboring Senegal (rank 92) and Mauritania 
(rank 114). The Freedom in the World 2012 report categorizes The Gambia as “not free”. Internal 
governance issues have had an unfavorable impact on economic development by, at times, 
compromising relations with neighboring countries, development partners, and 
internal 
stakeholder groups. Poor governance also undermines urgently needed private sector investments 
due to concerns related to corruption, political interference and the rule of law. 
21. Weak public sector capacity remains a significant constraint. The Government 
recently launched a new Civil Service Reform Strategy (2012-2015) building on previous 
initiatives. The strategy comprises seven components dealing with broad areas of public sector 
performance, pay and pension reforms, accountability and service delivery. Earlier activities, 
supported by UNDP and Spain, have improved capacity in public sector management and e-
governance, the justice sector, and the National Assembly14.  

6 	

	
 
 
1.3 Social Context 

22. 
The Gambia ranks 168th out of 187 on the 2011 Human Development Index and will 
not achieve most of the MDGs (Annex 6). Some gains have been recorded in education, health 
and nutrition in recent years; however, many challenges remain.  
23. 
The Government made commendable progress with respect to education coverage, 
and quality has started to improve as well. The Gross Enrollment Rate (GER) for lower basic 
education increased considerably in the last few years and reached 90 percent in 2012 (including 
the certified madrassas which follow the regular curriculum) which is at par with the SSA 
average. Gender parity has been achieved at both the lower basic and upper basic levels. With a 
primary completion rate of 72 percent, The Gambia compares well with other countries and, if it 
accelerates efforts to improve the quality of education, might be able to attain universal primary 
completion by 2020.  
24. 
Progress in health indicators has been less consistent and The Gambia is unlikely to 
achieve any of the health-related MDGs: This includes maternal as well as infant and under-
five child mortality rates and the percentage of births not assisted by skilled staff. The under-five 
child mortality is 106 in the Gambia, compared to 77 in Senegal.  As to projections based on 
progress in the past five years, the MDG targets for infant and under-five child mortality will be 
reached only towards the end of the century or in the 2030s, respectively, if current policies 
continue to be implemented as they were in the most recent past - and/or donor support is 
maintained at the current levels. Earlier progress in reducing malnutrition has stalled in recent 
years: According to the new World Health Organization (WHO) standards, stunting increased 
between 2000 and 2005 from 24 to 28 percent, but fell to 23 percent in 201015. Projections on the 
MDG target related to undernourishment show insufficient progress, reflecting, amongst others, 
the impact of the 2011 drought. 
25. 
The latest sero-surveillance data indicate that the HIV-1 prevalence rate is stable and 
not significantly improving. With a prevalence rate of 0.9 percent amongst adults aged 15 to 49, 
according to UNAIDS estimates for 200716, it is at a very low level for Sub-Saharan Africa17.   
26. 
Though well executed, the poverty programs are primarily contingent on continued 
donor support. The budget execution rate of social programs in 2011 was 96.5 percent (see 
Table 4).  The highest rates were recorded for education, health and nutrition programs, which 
reached percentages in the upper 90s.  However, most of the program budgets went to wages and 
salaries.

1.4 Poverty Profile and Trends 

27. 
Poverty noticeably declined during the last decade, but remains widespread with 
considerable regional variation. The overall poverty rate was an estimated 48.4 percent 18 in 
2010, down from an estimated 58.0 percent in 2003.19  While there are problems of comparability, 
this suggests a fairly high elasticity of poverty with respect to growth and therefore a relatively 
inclusive pattern of growth. This is broadly consistent with the important role played by 
agriculture during this period.  
28. 
There are large regional variations of poverty within The Gambia, with urban areas 
recording (based on the upper poverty line) a much lower poverty headcount (32.7 percent) 
compared with rural areas (73.9 percent). However, there appears to have been a modest 
narrowing of the gap, with poverty actually increasing in the Banjul area, probably due to rapid 
migration from rural areas.  At the same time, the poorest region, Central River Region-North, 
enjoyed the largest decline in poverty between 2003 and 2010, although 79 percent of its 
population remains poor. Inequality appears to be somewhat higher than in neighboring 
Senegal20.   
29. 
The extreme poverty rate for female-headed households is significantly lower than 
for male headed households – 38 as compared to 51 percent. Factors explaining these figures 
include the fact that bigger households, which are most often headed by males, are generally 
poorer than those with fewer members. Also, female-headed households are mostly found in the 
urban areas, with household heads more often than not gainfully employed. Remittances from 
abroad continue to play a significant role in these households. However, the female labor force21 
is predominantly rural, and less-skilled, and earns less income than male workers. 
30. 
The unemployed in The Gambia are more likely to be young, urban, female, and 
better educated – reflecting the weakness of the country’s formal economy. 22 Nearly 60 
percent of the poor in The Gambia are under the age of 20. Youth face significant challenges with 
respect to employment outcomes, such as very difficult transition from school to work and very 
low levels of education and training. Rural unemployment rates are low and vary little across the 
whole age spectrum, predominantly as a result of rural workers being absorbed into low pay, low 
qualification, high informality and low quality jobs in the agriculture sector. In cities and towns, 
the services sector is the most important source of employment, particularly for young people, 
accounting for almost 65 percent of employed youth aged 20-24 years.  

1.5 Major Development Challenges 

 

31. 
The Gambia faces three main challenges that need to be addressed to increase 
resilience, and allow for more adequate responses to external shocks, including volatile weather 
conditions and the effects of climate change: 
 Restoring growth and macroeconomic stability. This will require in particular 
diversification of the economy and an improved private sector investment climate.  
Improving service delivery. This will require effective civil service reform including 
improved management capacity for strategic planning, performance measurement, and 
institutional coordination, collaboration and dialogue. 
Improving transparency and accountability in public financial management and public 
procurement. The demand-side of public financial management needs to be improved 

 

8 	

	
by disseminating information to the public and creating a culture of accountability and 
citizen participation.  

Reestablishing Growth and Macroeconomic Stability 
32. 
Sustained reforms are required to enhance the business environment, in order to 
underpin growth and private sector employment. In the 2013 Doing Business Report, The 
Gambia is ranked 147th out of 185 countries and has dropped in all indicators except enforcing 
contracts. The Gambia’s ranking in the Global Competitiveness Report slipped from 81th of 133 
in 2009/2010 to 98th of 144 in 2011/2012, but it remains the highest ranked in West Africa. The 
Report identified access to finance 23 and tax rates as the most problematic factors for doing 
business, far ahead of other issues such as tax and foreign currency regulations and inadequate 
infrastructure. 
33. 
The energy sector of The Gambia - a major bottleneck for the business environment 
- faces a number of challenges ranging from structural and operational issues to the need 
for significant capital to upgrade and expand its generation, transmission and distribution 
capacity. The high cost and the lack of availability of electricity is a serious constraint to 
enterprise development and there is also concern that the sector amasses substantial contingent 
liabilities.  The parastatal, the National Water and Electricity Company (NAWEC) is facing 
serious financial issues, and efforts are needed to improve its financial viability and operational 
performance24, including efforts to address power transmission and distribution losses.  Given the 
small size and geographic position of the country, The Gambia will need to explore options for 
power generation and distribution in close cooperation with neighbors in the region such as 
through joint projects under the River Gambia Development Organization (OMVG).  
34. Weak telecommunications links have affected the competitiveness of the business 
sector for many years, but basic telecommunications infrastructure is now being 
transformed by improved overseas and regional links. Access to the new high capacity 
submarine Africa Coast to Europe (ACE) cable will connect The Gambia and other West African 
countries with the rest of the world, and make telecom services, including high-speed internet 
services, more reliable and affordable. The challenge then will be for local telephone companies 
to provide an efficient technical and financial interface that will allow businesses and consumers 
to take advantage of this new link. 
35. 
The Gambia’s performance in the tourism sector has been good as a result of recent 
reforms and institutional changes. Recent efforts have focused on increasing air access, and 
more needs to be done to (a) update the quality of accommodation (three stars and above); (b) 
diversify tourism products; and (c) improve service delivery by adequately training staff and 
fostering entrepreneurs. 
36. 
The agriculture sector continues to be constrained by (a) insufficiently developed 
water management systems, leaving the country almost entirely dependent on rainfall, in spite of 
the availability of important inland water resources; (b) timely accessibility of farmers to quality 
inputs, credit, know-how and new technologies; (c) weakness in linkages for creating value added 
through agro-processing; (d) excessive post-harvest losses paired with low value addition, caused 
by weak storage, processing and marketing capabilities, and (e) climatic hazards, such as droughts 
and floods. While these challenges need to be tackled on the level of Gambian communities and 
households, regional cooperation on cross-cutting sector issues could play an important role in the 

9 	

	
context of organizations such as OMVG and the West and Central African Council for 
Agriculture Research (CORAF). Due to its relevance to the Gambian rural economy in terms of 
income generation, the value chain linked to the groundnut subsector deserves particular 
attention. 
37. Given the direct impacts of the most recent crises related to food price hikes, 
drought, and decline in agricultural production, there is a need for reshaping the food 
security agenda.  A  more coherent approach to food security will require that agricultural and 
food security interventions be embedded in the community nutrition service delivery platform 
(based on community needs, and implemented through community participation as opposed to top 
down government implemented programs).   
38. Women across all ethnic groups do not have land rights in The Gambia. The 
Government is committed to addressing this issue and the PAGE recognizes the need to 
restructure the land tenure and inheritance system to correct for the “gender bias” and increase 
agricultural productivity.25  

Strengthening Public Service Capacity for Service Delivery 
39. 
Limited public sector capacity remains a significant constraint for service delivery. 
The major capacity bottlenecks include 
inadequate 
coordination 
among 
the 
various institutions within government. 
Additionally, there is little capacity in the 
ministries 
for 
strategic 
planning, 
performance 
measurement 
and 
management. Consequently, 
there 
is 
limited accountability for results and 
delays in the decision-making process. 

Box 2: Innovations in the Education Sector 

A number of innovations, analytical work and rigorous 
studies have been introduced in the sector showing the 
government’s focus to carry out policy reforms that are 
evidence based. These include (i) a rigorous and prospective 
impact evaluation of whole school development and school 
grants on students’ learning; (ii) a number of pilots  to inform 
policy decisions such as a conditional cash transfer for Imams 
(religious leaders) to allow their students (from the Daaras) to 
learn literacy and math skills; inclusion of local languages in 
first grade to facilitate the acquisition of reading; a 
community based ECD pilot; (iii) strategy building for higher 
education policy, science and technology innovation and 
inclusion of ICT in education for 21st century skills 
development instead of traditional and rote learning methods; 
cards to share results with parents and communities at large.	
(iv) a system of accountability, such as the introduction of 
performance management system that is based on annual 
service level agreements holding public sector servants 
accountable to meet their annual goals; and school report 

40. 
These constraints are rooted in 
structural issues related to the incentive 
structure and competencies in the civil 
service, and frequent and unpredictable 
reshuffling of key Government officials, 
including ministers. In 
the short 
to 
medium term, a focus on the efficient 
management of human resources within 
the civil service, including the recruitment 
and retention of personnel should be a 
first priority.

Improving social services 
41. 
In the education sector, The Gambia has made significant strides in increasing the 
number of students enrolled at all levels. The remaining challenges for the education sector 
include (a) meeting the demands of hard to reach populations, in order to reach full enrollment, 
(b) improving early childhood, senior secondary and higher education and skills development in 
general, and (c) improving the quality of education overall, although important steps have already 
been undertaken in terms of provision of learning materials, teacher training support and 
provision of hardship allowances for qualified teachers in remote and poverty stricken areas26.  
42. 
A significant proportion of young people, especially in rural areas, leave school early, 
in part because of perceived low returns on education. Many of those who do receive high-
quality education and training choose to emigrate. There is clearly a mismatch between skills and 
market demand, and the gap between skilled and unskilled labor income, as well as urban and 
rural income is widening. The Gambia will need to align skills with the demands of the private 
sector labor market in promising sectors (tourism, agriculture, ICT), and provide incentives to 
attract qualified Gambians who are residing abroad back to their home country.   
43. 
In the health sector, in order to achieve the health-related MDGs and meet the goals 
set out in the PAGE 2012-2015, two priorities stand out: (a) maternal health and nutrition; 
and (b) household food security. The current stagnation in maternal (and child) health and 
nutrition outcome indicators is mainly associated with: (a) a decline in support for Primary Health 
Care (PHC) in favor of a proportional increase in spending on tertiary health care, (b) the 
virtualization of health programs related to specific diseases, such as malaria, HIV/AIDS and 
tuberculosis, (c) centralized planning and budgeting, which leaves regions with little control over 
service delivery programs, and (d) limited harmonization of donor support and intra-sectoral 
funding processes.  
44. 
Existing social protection programs, including safety nets, are fragmented and 
inefficient and do not respond to the needs of the chronic poor and the most vulnerable.  
Very little is known about the actual effectiveness and scope of existing safety net interventions in 
The Gambia. Most interventions are fairly small, temporary programs focused on short-term 
emergency relief and financed by ad-hoc external resources, rather than elements of a coherent 
medium-term strategy to protect the poor that could be scaled-up when a crisis occurs. A more 
coherent approach is needed to link the development of social protection strategies to reforms 
aimed at strengthening agriculture productivity, food security and nutrition outcomes at the 
household level.  
Improving Transparency and Accountability in Public Financial Management and Public 
Procurement 
45. 
Public financial management and transparency have improved in recent years. 
Progress is reflected in the findings of the 2010 Country Financial Accountability Assessment 
(CFAA), the 2011 Public Expenditure Review (PER) Update, and the improved CPIA ratings. 
One key achievement has been the establishment of an Integrated Financial Management 
Information System (IFMIS). This system has improved the timeliness of financial reporting by 
providing monthly and comprehensive within-year budget execution reports, which facilitate the 
preparation of annual financial statements and subsequent budgets.27 As a next step, the IFMIS 
system needs to be upgraded and further expanded to include donor-funded projects and linked to 
the debt management system. Meanwhile, The Gambia has also reduced the backlog of audited 

11 	

	
Government financial statements28, established a Tax Tribunal, and strengthened the internal audit 
function.  
46. 
In the area of procurement, the Government issued a new report in March 2010 as 
an update of its 2005 Country Procurement Issues Paper. The proposed reform agenda 
includes three major objectives: (a) amending the Gambia Public Procurement Act, with a view to 
de-linking regulation from implementation; (b) re-engineering the Gambia Public Procurement 
Agency (GPPA) to become exclusively a regulatory body (similar to the Gambia Public Utilities 
Regulatory Authority, PURA); and, (c) establishing a procurement cadre that will be responsible 
for implementation. 29 To accelerate progress, the WBG will collaborate with the EU on an 
operation to support public procurement reform under the EU’s governance program.  

1.6  

The Gambia’s Development Strategy and Priorities 

Box 3: Policy and Legal Framework for Gender Equity 

Long-Term Vision and Priorities 
47. 
The Gambia’s long-term strategic goals were articulated in its Vision 2020, which 
aimed “…to transform The Gambia into a financial center, a tourist paradise, a trading export-
oriented agricultural and manufacturing nation, thriving on free market policies and a vibrant 
private sector, sustained by a well-educated, skilled, healthy, self-reliant and enterprising 
population, guaranteeing a well-balanced ecosystem and a decent standard of living for all, 
under a system of government based on the consent of the citizenry”. 
The Gambia’s Medium-Term Development Strategy 2012-2015 - PAGE 
48. 
In 2012, 
the Government 
launched 
the 
“Program 
for 
Accelerated 
Growth 
and 
Employment” (PAGE 2012-2015), to 
succeed PRSP II 2007-2011, based on 
broad stakeholder consultations. The 
PAGE is based on the Government’s 
Vision 2020 
and various 
sector 
strategies, and is fully aligned with the 
MDGs. Its principle strategic objective 
is to accelerate growth and employment 
and reduce poverty. The PAGE targets a 
15 percent decline 
in 
the poverty 
headcount 
index 
to 33.4 percent, 
assuming a 3.1 percent per capita 
growth rate over the 2011-15 period. 
The PAGE was discussed 
in 
the 
IMF/IDA Joint Staff Advisory Note (JSAN) of March 8, 2012. 
49. One key conclusion of the JSAN was that further prioritization of objectives and 
activities is required given the constrained resource envelope. The Government estimates the 
total cost of implementing the PAGE at US$943 million. Taking into account the resources 
already available for on-going projects, the shortfall in resource requirements is more than 
US$650 million. The Government is committed to contributing 35 percent of this amount, leaving 
a financing gap of US$423 million to be financed by donors and the private sector.   

Improvements in gender equality features as one of the eight 
priority areas in the Government’s PAGE, which also reflects 
priority objectives outlined in the Government-approved 
National Gender Policy (2010-2020).  Furthermore, the 
enactment of the Women’s Act in 2010 - a legislative milestone 
for women’s right in The Gambia – has been called one the most 
comprehensive attempts to domestically enshrine international 
and regional conventions on women’s rights.  
Significant challenges remain to allow men and women to 
equally live up to their development potentials, including, 
women’s access to economic opportunities, participation in 
decision making and a still high maternal mortality rate.   
And still, every day in The Gambia thousands of women and 
girls are victims of gender-based violence including sexual 
abuse, trafficking or early and forced marriage. Also, 80 percent 
of girls are submitted to the practice of female genital 
mutilation.  

12 	

	
50. 
The JSAN also highlights the importance of regional integration for the country, 
recommending that PAGE implementation pay close attention to regional trade arrangements.  In 
addition, it highlights the need to take advantage of regional programs funded by various donors, 
including the AfDB and IDA programs on dry lands, water resources management, and regional 
agriculture. 
51. One of the challenges for the PAGE implementation is the weakness of the country’s 
statistical system. Improving the timeliness and quality of statistics would greatly support the 
economic development program delineated in the PAGE, which now lacks target indicators for 
development results due to a dearth of data or, in some cases, significant lags between completion 
of field surveys and their publication. A further constraint is the limited capacity at all levels to 
analyze and use data effectively. There is also a need to monitor and track governance and related 
indicators, as well as to increase the frequency of disease surveillance and continue building the 
database for health information. Improving macroeconomic accounts is also critical to better 
support macroeconomic management. The JSAN recommends prioritizing implementation of the 
Government’s “Strategic Plan for the Development of Statistics in The Gambia,” which focuses 
on continued structural reforms and capacity building of the Gambia Bureau of Statistics. The 
authorities have asked donors, including the WBG, to renew their support for the country’s 
statistical system. 
III. THE AfDB AND WBG SECOND JOINT PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY 

2.1  Lessons from the Previous Joint Assistance Strategy (JAS), Stakeholder 
Feedback and Gender Assessment 

Lessons from the JAS-1 Completion Report 
52. 
Results and lessons from the first IDA/AfDB Joint Assistance Strategy (JAS-1) for 
the period of 2008-11 were assessed in a JAS Completion Report (see Annex 3). The results 
have been assessed as moderately satisfactory by both Banks as good progress was made towards 
achieving most major expected outcomes.  
53. One of the key lessons from the experience of the JAS-1 is that the JAS was a useful 
tool for coordinating the development efforts of both Banks.  Despite some processing challenges 
due to different disbursement schedules, the collaboration was determined to be very successful in 
improving the impact of the development efforts by the two Banks, and should be continued. The 
collaboration allowed the two institutions to align their development programs, avoid duplication 
of efforts, and combine their technical expertise. WB and AfDB have worked together to develop 
shared objectives and a common platform for lending and non-lending activities in line with the 
country’s priorities.  
Findings from WB IEG Evaluations, 2012 Country Survey, Stakeholder Consultations and 
Portfolio Gender Assessment 
54. 
The ex-post project evaluations carried out by the WB Independent Evaluation 
Group (IEG), lessons learned emphasize the importance of strong Government leadership, and 
coordination between 
line ministries and 
implementing agencies, 
for 
the successful 
implementation of programs and projects. A better understanding of political economy issues is 
also critical for the effective design of sector reforms. IEG evaluations also highlighted the 
importance of quality at entry, managerial and technical capacity and project management for 

13 	

	
good project implementation.  
55. 
The FY12 Country Survey shows that the WB is valued for its work. Stakeholders 
value the Bank’s policy and economic advice as much as its financial resources, and are satisfied 
with the overall relationship. Issues raised were related to (a) alignment of the Bank’s priorities 
with perceptions of the country’s top priorities; and (b) Bank procedures and policies (perceived 
lack of flexibility, complexity of its financing and levels of bureaucracy).  At the country level, 
there is clear recognition that capacity is lacking and that reform efforts need to be tailored to 
country challenges and circumstances.  
56. 
The content of the proposed JPS-2 is based on in-depth discussions with the Government 
and consultations with donors and other stakeholders on various occasions, preceding a round of 
more comprehensive multi-stakeholder consultations in March/April 2012. 
57. 
The 2012 WB Portfolio Gender Assessment concluded that the current IDA portfolio 
in The Gambia is fully gender informed, meaning that the ongoing IDA and TF portfolio 
addresses gender-related aspects in their analysis and/or actions, specifically with respect to (a) 
gender parity in basic lower and upper education levels; (b) productivity and access to markets for 
female farmers; (c) nutrition of children and lactating women. Some operations also have a 
substantial gender informed monitoring and evaluation framework. The AfDB 2011 Gender 
Profile for The Gambia30  provided a picture of the policies, programs and practice areas that have 
promoted women’s empowerment and gender equality in the Gambia. Conclusions and 
recommendations of both documents have informed the preparation of the proposed Joint 
Strategy. 

2.2  The Portfolios of Both Banks 

58. 
The current IDA portfolio (Table 5) for The Gambia comprises six active operations 
(including two regional projects and one budget support operation), representing a total 
commitment of US$77.75 million. The IDA portfolio is complemented by TF resources totaling 
about US$36.75 million.   
59. 
The current AfDB portfolio (Table 6) for The Gambia consists of eight active 
operations (including one regional project and one budget support operation), representing total 
commitments of UA89.34 million. The AFDB portfolio includes TF commitments totaling about 
UA8.4 million.  

60. 
The performance of both portfolios is overall satisfactory. Positive examples include 
WB-supported operations in the education sector, The performance of both portfolios is overall 
satisfactory. Positive examples include WB-supported operations in the education sector, 
implemented by a single Project Coordination Unit (PCU) that manages all projects in the sector 
and is fully integrated into the Ministry of Basic and Secondary Education (MoBSE). Based on its 
successes so far, the Gambian MoBSE has been presented as a case study in a 2012 WB research 
project on Building State Capacity in Challenging Context. The MoBSE Permanent Secretary has 
received an international award31 for outstanding services in the same year. In addition to their 
lending program, the Banks have been engaging in a range of analytical work and technical 
assistance (see Annex 3)

The International Finance Corporation (IFC)’s strategy in The Gambia is selective 
and is focused on (a) enhancing the capacity of local financial institutions (through advisory 
services and financing) to improve access to finance of potential Small and Medium Enterprise 
(SME) clients; and (b) selectively supporting committed and experienced sponsors in priority 
sectors (tourism, agriculture). IFC’s outstanding committed amount as of June 30, 2012 is US$8.5 
million, including US$6.5 million in Coco Ocean, a tourism project, and US$2 million with 
Ecobank Gambia. IFC's investment in Coco Ocean supports the development of a new up-scale 
market niche and promotes The Gambia’s image as a quality destination, with the aim of 
attracting visitors with higher purchasing power. To further strengthen the country’s banking 
sector, the IFC committed two investments in Ecobank Gambia, including a US$0.3 million tier-2 
investment through the IFC managed Cap Fund and a US$2 million trade finance facility under 
the Global Trade Finance Program, with the latter expected to foster external trade, including for 
SMEs.  The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) has not yet issued coverage for 
any investments in The Gambia.

2.3 The JPS-2 Strategic Approach 

Strategy Overview 
62. 
The Banks’ overarching objective for the proposed JPS-2 is to support the 
Government’s efforts to address major challenges in the areas of poverty reduction, job 
creation and economic growth, in light of the country’s vulnerability to external shocks, and in 
line with priorities outlined in PAGE 2012. The JPS-2 builds on the successful implementation of 
the preceding JAS-1, and gives priority to the consolidation of progress achieved and to creating 
linkages among areas of interventions in order to strengthen resilience on both the macro and 
micro levels.  Given the high elasticity of poverty with respect to growth, the underlying 
expectation is that the promotion of growth through interventions in agriculture and rural 
development will contribute significantly to poverty reduction.  
63. Governance represents a key factor for achieving the growth and service delivery 
results envisioned in the Government strategy. Strengthening governance, including through a 
solid and predictable policy and macro-economic framework, is critical for providing an enabling 
environment for productive investments to unlock the country’s full growth potential. Similarly, 
more effective and transparent management of public resources, along with enhanced human 
resources capacity could support improvements in service delivery. The JPS recognizes the cross-
cutting role that governance plays in the two proposed pillars. In light of the considerable 
governance challenges, the JPS proposes to focus on areas where progress has been recorded, i.e. 
economic development with a specific focus on rural areas, and service delivery for human 
development. Sector operations also will more systematically take governance into account in 
their project design. The JPS also includes a dedicated governance and capacity building 
operation in the outer year of its implementation period, which will further support an integrated 
approach to governance and maximize development effectiveness across the two pillars. 
64. 
Under the proposed new JPS, the Banks would provide technical assistance and  
analytical and financial support to a joint and complementary program which focuses on 
the following two pillars:  

Pillar 1:  
Enhancing Productive Capacity and Competitiveness in order to Strengthen Resilience to 
External Shocks - aligned with elements of PAGE pillars I (Economic Growth), II (Infrastructure) 
and IV (Governance). 

JPS-2 Pillars 

Pillar 2:  
Strengthening the Institutional Capacity for Economic Governance and Public Service 
Delivery - aligned with elements of PAGE pillars III (Human Capital, Social Services), IV 
(Governance) and V (Social Cohesion, Cross-cutting interventions). 

65. 
These pillars are a slightly modified version of the JAS-1 pillars reflecting a shift in 
priorities given the country’s most recent exposure to external shocks which affected both the 
drivers of growth and the Government’s capacity for service delivery.   
66. 
The approach of the JPS is to consolidate gains achieved in previous years, while 

16 	

	
 
 
 
 
selectively exploring new areas of intervention in the outer years. The Gambia’s overall 
development agenda has not changed fundamentally, and the resource allocation of both Banks is 
limited. 
67. 
The principles proposed by AfDB and the WBG to guide the design of the JPS 
program are as follows: 
 Draw on the comparative strengths of each Bank and on AfDB’s focus on economic 
governance and agriculture, specifically in response to the 2011 Sahel drought crisis. 
 Ensure complementarity and avoid overlap, with the activities of other key donors. 
 Align the activities, where possible, with key institutional and regional priorities of 
both Banks, including the AfDB RIAS and the WB Africa Strategy. 
 Given the small size of the country, regional integration will be a cross cutting theme 
as it was in the previous JAS. Regional program resources will be used, where 
available to leverage the national IDA and/or ADF allocations and acquire GEF co-
financing while assuring selectivity in the overall lending program. 
 The JPS-2 program will be very selective and focus on only few key areas of 
intervention, 
i.e. governance/public 
financial management, 
agriculture/rural 
development (both Banks in close cooperation); critical infrastructure (AfDB on 
transport and WBG on energy); and service delivery in the education and health 
sectors at the community level and in combination with interventions on improving 
nutrition for mothers and children (WBG).  
 Both Banks will further deepen attention to gender throughout their lending and non-
lending portfolios in line with the national Gender Policy. 
68. 
The proposed new strategy has been designed and will be implemented jointly by 
teams from both Banks, and (partly) also with other stakeholders, to ensure maximum of 
synergies in approaches and activities, as recommended by the JAS-1 Completion Report.  The 
proposed strategy includes a joint results matrix which – to the extent possible – specifies which 
partner is undertaking which activities. 
Expected Results and Program of Lending and Non-Lending Activities 
Pillar 1: Enhancing Productive Capacity and Competitiveness in Order to Strengthen 
Resilience to External Shocks 
69. 
Pillar I focuses on promoting a competitive investment climate, strengthening the 
agriculture and rural development sectors, including through drought recovery measures, and 
developing key supporting infrastructure, with a focus on energy and water sectors – with a view 
to strengthening the economy’s resilience to external shocks including those related to climate 
change and extreme weather events. 
70. 
Agriculture and Rural Development: Interventions by both Banks will aim to promote 
more diversified and efficient production of priority agricultural commodities by both 
smallholders and commercial farms. Specifically, the interventions will promote good practices 
and strengthen capacities for sustainable and efficient management of the country’s water 
resources. The approach will ensure that agriculture and rural development are geared towards 
environmental sustainability and linked to poverty alleviation, improved food security, nutrition 
and social protection – and that macro-economic policy, addressed under Pillar 2, builds the 
necessary supportive framework for sustainable results in these fields of intervention.32 Support 

17 	

	
will also include the generation and dissemination of adapted technology for enhanced 
agricultural productivity in the context of a regional program. One additional focus will be to 
create incentives for increased private sector engagement, including commercial agriculture.  
71. 
Rural development and agriculture under the proposed JPS will be supported by a new 
IDA Commercial Agriculture and Rural Development operation (CARD, US$14 million, FY14), 
complemented by the FY13 (second) Emergency Agriculture Production Project (JSDF grant, 
US$3 million). The design of both operations will be informed by an Agriculture Sector Policy 
Note that was prepared in 2012 in the context of the preparation of the proposed JPS. Synergies 
will be created with the regional IDA West Africa Agricultural Production Program and the 
ADF-supported Regional Sahel Resilience Program. Relevant AfDB projects include the GAFSP 
Food Security Project to enhance food security planned for 2013; and the multinational Sahel 
Resilience Project, which includes The Gambia and aims at developing measures and techniques 
to counter weather variability. 
72. 
Production-oriented activities would be complemented by a targeted approach 
towards social protection for the most vulnerable rural population through community-driven 
development (CDD) activities to strengthen resilience to external shocks / adverse conditions on 
the local level.  A CDD component in the CARD will use social protection strategies to support 
demand-driven activities on the local level related to preventing the impacts of adverse weather 
conditions on agricultural production, and make provision for food security and sustained 
nutritional outcomes for the most vulnerable, under-served rural poor population.33  The proposed 
JPS will build on the multi-sectoral experience in nutrition and CDD from the previous JAS 
period. By targeting women, promoting small-scale and diversified food production, and 
expanding food and nutrition behavior change communication strategies, the WBG will support 
the Government’s efforts to improve the food security and nutrition of its population. 

JPS-2 Outcome 1 – Adoption of Diversified Production and Marketing of Selected Agricultural 
Commodities 
Outcome Indicators: 
 Number of additional households engaged in food diversification through small scale fruit and 
vegetable production, and/or small animal husbandry (25,000 by June 2016 from 0 in 2012). 
JPS-2 Outcome 2 - Adoption of improved technologies in Agriculture 
 Number of additional beneficiaries who have adopted technologies for enhanced agricultural 
productivity and storage (120,000 by June 2016 from 0 in June 2012).  
Incremental percentage increase in horticulture sales ≥ 15%  in June 2015, from 0% in 
September 2012 relative to baseline of GMD 3,644 in January 2011)  

 

73. 
Investment Climate: The IDA Growth and Competitiveness Project (GCP) will continue 
to provide support to strengthen the competitiveness of key sectors and improve the investment 
climate. The project will support activities to (a) reduce the costs and delays of starting and 
operating businesses in The Gambia, including the time and costs associated with compliance 
with tax regulations and (b) improve the collateral registry. These activities will foster 
competition and competitiveness, while reducing an important constraint in terms of access to 

18 	

	
 
finance for firms. Tourism is an area of focus of the project, and the revamping of the Gambia 
Tourism and Hospitality Institute will help provide the necessary skills needed to run the tourism 
establishments.  
74. 
Finally, to further ground the Government's private sector development policies, it is 
important to strengthen the public-private dialogue, through the provision of technical 
assistance (TA), logistical and personnel support. The newly established Gambia Investment and 
Export Promotion Agency (GIEPA) is expected to improve private-public dialogue and facilitate 
investment with support from the GCP. The administration of investment incentives has 
reportedly improved and there are renewed efforts in investment promotion. The banking sector 
continues to perform relatively well, although access to finance remains a constraint with 
government borrowing crowding out the private sector. The scope for private participation in 
infrastructure is promising if a clear policy and regulatory framework is put in place.  
75. 
The Government has expressed interest in analytical support for financial sector 
strengthening, private-public partnerships, and trade logistics to complement a number of the 
interventions supported under the GCP. A multi-sector study on Sources of Growth, Business 
Environment and Labor Markets will spell out the main opportunities in agribusiness, mining, 
tourism and urbanization and help guide the implementation of the current PAGE and the 
preparation of a follow-up strategy. This piece of analytical work will also leverage and 
complement the 2009 ICA. Other analytical work will include a Trade Logistics study, a 
Financial Sector Development Strategy and studies on the development of critical public private 
partnerships (PPPs). A request to the AfDB by the Trust Bank Gambia Ltd. for a line of credit 
for on-lending to SMEs, is still awaiting a response.  
76. 
The JPS also proposes to prepare analytical work on Higher Education (tracer study 
of higher education graduates) which could inform the Government’s first ever higher education 
policy aimed at aligning human resource competencies and the labor market. IFC aims to support 
vocational training schools to improve specialized professional skills among the working 
population.   
77. 
IFC will explore how to further support private sector initiatives, especially in the 
power, financial education and agribusiness sectors. To ensure that economic recovery is 
inclusive and sustainable, the focus will be on promoting and engaging the local private sector, 
particularly SMEs. IFC is active in developing trade with a commercial bank under its Global 
Trade Finance Program that is aiming at increasing trade and SME financing. In addition to 
facilitating access to credit via the banking sector, IFC will develop the capacity of SMEs to 
actively participate in the supply and value chains of the large projects in the country. In this 
regard, assessment activities will gauge the potential for Business Edge training programs to serve 
as the SME capacity development component of the Africa Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises 
(AMSME) programs with financial institutions.  

JPS-2 Outcome 3 – Improved Business Environment 
Outcome Indicators: 
 Cost of registering a business (<140 % of GNI/capita by June 2015, from  206.10 % in 
September 2012) 
19 	

Infrastructure: IFC is ready to mobilize resources to support the Government in 

78. 

	
identifying bankable opportunities in the telecom, power, water, road and transport sectors. In 
particular, IFC is engaging in a dialogue with The Gambia’s institutions and development 
partners in order to identify PPP possibilities that might be in the best interest of the country, in 
partnership with the Public Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility (PPIAF). 
79. 
Energy: Development of the electricity sector, specifically as related to the 
organizational effectiveness of NAWEC and the exploration of potential for PPPs, would be 
followed up by through the implementation of the recommendations of the 2010 Energy Sector 
Diagnostic Study. The WBG will support an Integrated Resource Planning Study (funded in part 
through an Additional Financing grant under the IFMIS Project, and in part by the PPIAF) aimed 
at reducing the NAWEC’s burden on government accounts, and prioritizing needed investments.  
A more important investment in the energy sector will be provided by the WBG’s Energy Sector 
Support Project (US$8 million, FY15). IFC support to any Independent Power Producer project 
will be contingent to reforms of the sector and NAWEC. The AfDB is considering supporting 
private-sector investments in thermal and renewable energy.   
80. 
Transport: The AfDB will continue supporting the Gambia on more efficient cross-
border road infrastructure, specifically as related to the Trans-Gambia Bridge to Senegal that 
will be critical in facilitating of cross-border trade in the sub-region. IFC has been in preliminary 
discussions with AfDB regarding advisory opportunities on the Trans-Gambia bridge project.  

JPS-2 Outcome 4 - Improved Cross Border Transit Time. 
 Reduced transit time across the Gambia River (from 79min in 2012 to <30min by 2016)  
 Reduced waiting time at borders (from 4 hrs in 2012 to 2 hrs by 2016) 

81. 
Telecommunication: The IDA West Africa Regional Communication Infrastructure 
Program (WARCIP) has helped The Gambia connect directly to the new high capacity ACE 
submarine cable connecting Africa with Europe. It will facilitate the introduction in The Gambia 
and in the region of high speed internet services, and make telecom services more reliable and 
affordable for consumers. The program is structured to address critical connectivity gaps through 
(a) the establishment of infrastructure and institutional set-up for the landing of the ACE cable 
and (b) TA to strengthen the enabling environment for connectivity, including the policy and 
regulatory framework for open access, in close collaboration with the private sector. 

JPS-2 Outcome 5 - Improved Telecommunication/Internet connectivity  
Outcome Indicators: 
 
Volume of international traffic: International Communications (Internet, Telecoms, and 
Data) bandwidth per person (kbit/per person) (30kbit/person by December 2016, from 
10kbit/person in September 2012) 

 

Volume of available international capacity: International Communications (Internet, 
Telecoms, and Data) bandwidth (Gbit/s) (5.9 Gbit/s by December 2016, from .16 in 
September 2012)

Pillar 2: Strengthening the Institutional Capacity for Economic Management and Public 
Service Delivery 
82. 
Pillar II aims at consolidating the gains reached in the 2008-2011 JAS period on 
transparency and accountability in the use of public resources, improving the performance of the 
civil service, improving public service delivery and quality with a focus on education, nutrition 
and community health, and social protection, and making further progress in these areas 
consistent with the PAGE and the MDG objectives.   
83. 
The main outcomes of the proposed JPS under this pillar will refer to improved 
fiscal and macro-economic management, and improved service delivery in terms of improved 
quality of learning outcomes for basic and secondary education, and nutrition and health 
outcomes for women and children.   
84. 
Recent progress in economic management will be consolidated and further enhanced 
during the coming JPS period. Aspects of public financial management (budget planning, 
execution, reporting; public procurement, internal and external auditing; aid coordination) as well 
as macroeconomic management, education sector management and the role of the private sector 
with specific focus on PPPs, the energy sector, the hospitality industry and agriculture will be 
covered by a series of budget support operations, determined under a Joint Budget Support 
Matrix, as agreed between AfDB, IDA and the Government. The series would be split in four 
operations (two by each Bank) in the overall amounts of UA3 million and US$11 million, 
respectively, over 3 years.  
85. On-going institutional support and technical assistance to the Ministry of Finance 
and Economy (AfDB’s second Institutional Support for Economic and Financial Governance, 
ISPEFG II and IDA’s IFMIS-Project) will complement the economic governance reform 
agenda. The IFMIS Project will be extended and resupplied with fresh resources through an 
Additional Financing (AF) operation that would aim at further rolling out and deepening the 
IFMIS modules. In particular, the IFMIS system could be upgraded to a newer web-based version 
and expanded to include donor-funded projects which constitute about 40 percent of the national 
budget and a link with the debt management system. Additional efforts could also be taken to 
improve the demand side of public financial management by actively disseminating information 
to the public and creating a general environment encouraging transparency, accountability, and 
participation34. The routine publication of IFMIS-generated government fiscal operations reports 
on the web will serve as a key measure to trigger demand side accountability for improved 
allocative efficiency. The envisaged AF for the IFMIS Project will also support a strategic energy 
study - as the energy sector represents a large off budget liability that threatens the country's 
overall fiscal balance. 
86. 
Specifically on Public Financial Management, the WBG will work with the 
Government to develop a Customs Assessment Trade Toolkit – an integrated monitoring tool to 
measure customs performance over time, to ensure consistency with best practice and/or best fit, 
using objectively verifiable data sets. This will provide additional analytical underpinning for a 
focused engagement with the Government in the implementation of requisite policy reforms that 
could lead to common and simplified customs procedures as well as strengthened regional 
integration.  A Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) Assessment is foreseen 
for FY14, and Institutional Development Fund (IDF) resources (US$0.7 million) will be 
requested for the implementation of actions aimed at strengthening the Public Accounts 

21 	

	
Committee (PAC) in its oversight role over the three-year period starting in mid-2013.  

JPS-2 Outcome 6 – Improved Public Financial Management  
Outcome Indicators: 
 Completion of accounts reconciliation within 30 days of the end of the month for at least 12 
months in a row by end 2016. 
 Time needed for Public Accounts Committee’s completion of review of latest audit reports 
(within 12 months of receipt from the NAO by June 2016, from >12 months in 2011). 
 Number of procurement organizations compliant with the Gambia Public Procurement Act, as 
reflected in annual Gambia Public Procurement Agency report. (9 by end-2015, from 0 in 
2012) 

87. 
The WBG will also collaborate closely with the European Commission (EC) to 
improve governance in the Gambia, under the public financial management component of 
the EU Governance Support Program approved in 2011. The WBG will prepare and 
implement a technical assistance intervention funded under the EU Program, which aims at 
boosting Public Procurement Reform by (a) strengthening the Gambia public procurement 
institutions, (b) improving the efficiency and transparency of the country’s public procurement 
system, and (c) enhancing the compliance of the national procurement system with international 
quality standards. In addition, options to link activities in support of public procurement with 
the IFMIS Project will be explored, as part of tackling the bigger challenges in PFM and 
governance.  
88. 
The ongoing, incremental civil service reform will be supported through the 
continued implementation of a small Institutional Development Fund (IDF) grant for 
technical assistance to support key components in the Government’s long term Civil Service 
Reform agenda, specifically in the areas of strengthening the capacity for human resources 
management, and wage bill and pension management. Building on this grant, the new JPS will 
provide support to more effective service delivery through extensive capacity building and the 
introduction of performance management tools in collaboration with other development partners, 
notable the EU and UNDP.  
89. 
In addition, the WBG has agreed to resume support to statistical capacity 
development for the Gambia Bureau of Statistics (GBOS) and for statistical departments in line 
ministries with financial resources to be requested from the Trust Fund for Statistical Capacity 
Building (TFSCB). The AfDB has launched the 2011 round of the International Comparison of 
Prices (ICP) Program with price data collection in 18 regional member countries, including The 
Gambia, in support of and in close collaboration with GBOS.   
90. 
In the social sectors, support will concentrate on education, and on nutrition and 
household food and nutrition security in combination with community-based health care. 
91. 
In education, the successful WBG support during previous years, with its strong 
focus on access, will be continued under this JPS with a stronger focus on education quality. 
The ongoing Education for all Fast Track Initiative Project financed by the Global Partnership for 
Education (GPE), and the IDA Third Education Project (phase 2) will be completed. A follow-up 
IDA Education Sector Support Project and, if possible, a new GPE Basic Education Grant, would 
be prepared for FY14 to continue the reform process aimed at improving the quality of learning 

22 	

	
outcomes for basic education. Complementary to these investments, a small number of very 
targeted analytical work and technical assistance will help define and support certain elements of 
reform, notably a Survey on Parenting Practices, an operation to develop a program for Teaching 
Math and Physics through E-learning, and a National Language Pilot TA. 

JPS-2 Outcome 7 – Improved quality of learning outcomes for basic education 
Outcome Indicators: 
 % of teachers whose attendance is over 90% in 2016 by region, from 75% in 2012. 
 % of students reaching the minimum literacy standard on grade 3 NAT reaches 43% in 2016, 
disaggregated by gender, from 36.7%, in 2012. 

92. 
In the area of maternal and child health, nutrition, and household food security the 
WB will follow-up on the support provided to the Gambia National Nutrition Agency under 
the JAS-1 with a combined IDA / TF operation focused on Community-based Nutrition and 
Primary Health Care Services for maternal and child health and nutrition – in close coordination 
with activities for rural and agricultural development. This operations will use Results-Based 
Financing (RBF). Improved service delivery performance in primary health and community 
nutrition, together with complementary measures as suggested in the 2012 Global Monitoring 
Report, will strengthen household food and nutrition security resilience in the wake of external 
economic shocks, thereby supporting the Government in developing more effective social 
protection strategies. The AfDB is considering investment options in the health sector through 
support to a private clinic in collaboration with the private sector. 

Outcome 8 – Improved nutrition and health services for women and children  
Outcome Indicators: 
 Proportion of births assisted by skilled personnel (65 percent by June 2016, from 57% in 2012)  
 Exclusive breastfeeding rate in the first six months (i.e., proportion of children 0-6 months 
exclusively breastfed in the last 24 hours) (40 percent by June 2016, from 34% in 2012) 
 Prevalence of anemia in children under five (52% by June 2016, from 62% in 2012) 

93. 
The application of the RBF approach to the health and nutrition service delivery will 
be a catalyst for improving service delivery systems by strengthening accountability systems 
as a means of providing quality services to poor people. Substantial technical assistance 
accompanying RBF processes will be provided, including TA for the management information 
system, the external verification of results, integrated program planning and budgeting, and inter-
agency coordination and organizational development.  In addition, the WBG will work with 
UNICEF to monitor household food and nutrition security through child anthropometrics.  These 
analytical products and the Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey results of 2010 will provide the 
basis for policy dialogue. 

23 	

	
 
 
 
 
	
94. 
The Bank will provide technical support to help the Government Review the Social 
Protection Programs (including safety nets) and define a concrete action plan for developing an 
efficient system.  One lesson from experience in other countries is that the most effective 
approach to prepare for crises is to build elements of a safety net system that can be used in 
normal times as a permanent program for vulnerable groups (for example infants, pregnant 
women, the disabled) and can be scaled up to cover others in periods of crisis.  
95. 
Disaster Risk Preparedness: A US$660,000 grant for a Bank executed non-lending TA 
project, currently under preparation, will help reduce vulnerability to disaster and foster disaster 
preparedness. The team will explore options to create synergies among this activity and the 
envisaged new Commercial Agriculture and Rural Development Project and the recently 
approved Emergency Agricultural Production Support operation, specifically on risk mitigation 
measures. 
96. 
The government will make an effort to build on the recently approved gender 
legislation in country, to deepen the WB’s effort to ensure gender issues are built into the 
projects. 

2.4 

Implementing the Second AfDB / WBG JPS 

Financial Envelope 
97. 
The proposed program design is based on the assumption of a three year (2012-14) 
ADF resource allocation for new commitments of UA3 million (equivalent to US$4.5 
million) from ADF 12 available for 2012 and 2013 and UA 8 million (equivalent to US$12 
million) from ADF 13 available for 2014 and 2015, in addition to an indicative IDA-16 
allocation of SDR 29.8 million (equivalent to US$44.7 million35) followed by estimated IDA-17 
annual allocations of US$14 million. This would amount to a total in combined ADF and IDA 
funds over the four-year JPS period of almost US$90 million, supplemented by TF resources. 
Both AfDB and IDA have been quite successful in leveraging additional resources through Trust 
Funds and will continue to do so under the JPS-2. Additional resources could come from the 
Global Agriculture Food Security Program (GAFSP), Rural Water Supply & Sanitation Initiative 
(RWSSI), African Water Facility (AWF), IDF, GPE, GEF (specifically, on dry land agenda and 
environmental stability as part of the envisaged CARP) and Bank-executed TFs for technical and 
analytical work.  Added to this would be allocations for regional projects, to be determined, from 
both Banks.  
Managing Program Implementation 
98. 
The JPS-2 lending program (Table 7) will be implemented by Government 
implementing organization (IO) and Project Coordination Units (PCUs) or Project 
Implementation Units (PIUs) with close support of the WB and AfDB teams. Due to capacity 
limitations, most PCUs are still not fully mainstreamed into the respective implementing 
organizations. It will be crucial to build mechanisms that would allow the transfer for knowledge 
and skills related to project management in these organizations, including strategic planning, 
fiduciary management, and monitoring and evaluation, on all levels. 
99. 
Program implementation will be continuously reviewed through annual Country 
Program Performance Reviews, in addition to the close follow-up on implementation by sector 
teams. Progress on the implementation of the proposed JPS will be analyzed in the course of a 

24 	

	
 
mid-term review and subsequent elaboration of a JPS Progress Report.

Partnerships and Donor Coordination 
100. The Gambia continues to be highly dependent on external development assistance. 
More than 80 percent of the country’s development budget is financed by the international donor 
community. In addition to the AfDB, the IMF and the WB, major development partners currently 
include the Islamic Development Bank; the EU; DFID; OPEC; UNDP; IFAD; the UN agencies; 
Taiwan, China; and Japan.  However because of budget constraints in donor countries, external 
donor assistance is expected to decline slightly over the period 2012-2015. Moreover, donors 
raise concerns about respect for the constitution, the rule of law and good governance in the 
country, specifically as related to the events of August 2012. The EU is considering options for an 
escalation of pressure through the ongoing political dialogue under Article 8 of the Cotonou 
Agreement, which could, as a last resort, lead to a suspension of EU support under Article 96 of 
that Agreement.  
101. Aid harmonization is an important issue in a small country such as The Gambia. 
While an overall framework for external partners’ coordination is not yet in place, the recent 
introduction in The Gambia of a joint Government/donor review of budget allocations and 
performance on a quarterly basis is a good step forward.  The Gambia has signed the Paris 
Declaration on Aid Effectiveness, and most external partners are aligning external assistance with 
country objectives as presented in the PAGE. The preparation of this JPS has been discussed with 
other partners. And a two-day donor conference in support of the implementation of the PAGE, 
organized by UNDP, was held in July 2012. Close cooperation is envisaged with a number of 
donors, including on fiduciary and governance issues; for example on public procurement reform 
with the EU.   
102. 
In addition to the close cooperation between AfDB and WB on the budget support 
policy matrix, donor harmonization is most advanced in the education sector (Table 8).  At 
the pre-higher education levels, IDA and GPE (previously called EFA FTI) are the largest 
partners supporting the systemic issues. WFP will continue to support school feeding with a view 
of developing a home grown school feeding program. UNICEF will continue to provide support 
to the child friendly school initiative. The Islamic Development Bank has recently negotiated a 
US$10 million project to support bilingual education in madrassas. At the higher levels of 
education, Islamic Development Bank, Kuwaiti Fund, OPEC, the Arab Bank for Economic 
Development of Africa (BADEA) and Saudi Fund are supporting the construction of faculty 
buildings and student dormitories for the expansion of the University of The Gambia.  During the 
JPS period, IDA will focus on providing strategic advice and technical assistance as required. 
Efforts are also underway for close consultations and harmonization of donors supporting the 
agricultural sectors under leadership of the AfDB, and including the WB, Islamic Development 
Bank (IDB) and the Institute for Agricultural Development (IFAD).  Joint project supervision 
with other donors will be sought where interests overlap, along the lines of what is already in 
place in the education sector.36 More generally, both banks will continue to work with the Gambia 
and other development partners to foster donor coordination.

Monitoring and Evaluation 
103. The Ministry of Finance and Economic Affairs will be responsible for the co-
ordination, monitoring and evaluation of the progress of the five pillars of PAGE through the 
existing PAGE National Implementation Team. The overall management will be through a 
National Coordination Committee that will report to the Ministerial level High Level Economic 
Committee. On the Civil Society side, a pro-poor advocacy group (Pro-PAG) established by Civil 
Society Organizations (CSOs) to participate in the monitoring of PRSP 2 would also participate in 
monitoring PAGE implementation.  
104. The WB, AfDB and others will continue to strengthen the capacity of the 
semiautonomous Gambia Bureau of Statistics (GBOS). The poverty database has been 
improved through the 2010 Household Budget Survey and the 2011 Poverty Assessment - both 
supported by UNDP. 
105. A JPS results framework will be put in place by the WB and AfDB similar to that used 
for the 2008-11 JPS, which will allow adequate review of AfDB and WB contributions toward the 
development of The Gambia under the JPS-2. As to the recommendations of the JAS-1 CR, JPS 
outcomes will be strictly aligned to specific interventions proposed in the JPS program. There will 
be no separate JPS results monitoring foreseen by the government or non-governmental 
stakeholders.  
106. The Results Matrix (see Annex 1) will include a list of results and intermediate 
outcomes to be monitored during the period FY12-15 based on envisaged project outcomes 
and indictors, in order to ensure attribution to the work of both Banks and for which the two 
institutions will be jointly held accountable. Project activities will be assessed on a regular basis, 
including during regular portfolio reviews. The JPS implementation monitoring system will be 
linked to the Government’s PAGE monitoring through (a) regular reporting on AfDB/WB 
projects and programs (review of key performance indicators, portfolio reviews, project 
completion reports), and (b) a planned mid-term evaluation of the JPS. 

27 	

	
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
IV. MANAGING RISKS 
107. The program supported by the proposed JPS carries risks, including governance, 
political, macroeconomic, project implementation and fiduciary risks, along with exogenous 
shocks that can only be partly mitigated in collaboration with the international donor community.  

3.1.  Governance Risks 

108. The JPS-2 will be implemented in an environment with various governance risks. 
Governance factors, such as accountability and transparency in the management of public 
resources and challenges related to the political economy in the environment of projects, will be 
anticipated and built into project design. However, they cannot fully be mitigated. In preparation 
of the joint strategy, multi-stakeholder consultations have been conducted to enhance ownership. 
The consultations have confirmed overall agreement to the proposed approach and substance of 
the JPS-2 program. On the level of individual operations, both Banks have been assured of strong 
Government and other stakeholder ownership, and both Banks will continue to encourage 
constructive multi-stakeholder dialogue, 
transparency, and participation during program 
implementation in order to reduce governance risks and maximize development impacts. 
Internally, the Banks will apply their standard fiduciary and procurement safeguards and ensure 
that all projects build in governance mitigation measures for the intended development outcomes. 
Externally, in line with its mandatory Access to Information policy, the WB will proactively 
disseminate information to beneficiaries and other stakeholders to increase opportunities for 
citizen feedback. 
109. Economic governance slippages and weak technical and managerial public sector 
capacity could compromise the most effective use of scarce public resources. The JPS-2 
provides for the continuation of the policy dialogue of both Banks through a series of 
development policy operations (DPOs) to strengthen economic governance. Amongst others, the 
DPOs support improvements in public financial management and budget planning to enhance the 
quality of public spending and transparency. At the government level, the WB’s Integrated 
Financial Management Information System (IFMIS) project will support the Government in a 
more effective management of its resources, including through the progressive integration of 
donor-funded activities into the system. Together with other tools, IFMIS can thus serve as an 
instrument to help improve fiscal management and transparency and mitigate governance risks. A 
further extension of the scope and application of the IFMIS system will be encouraged. 
110. Major policy reversals and other unexpected decisions also represent significant 
risks and have undermined confidence in the Government’s commitment to its international 
agreements. One recent example is the President’s intervention of October 2012 into the 
jurisdiction of the Central Bank in terms of determining the country’s monetary policy through 
the (temporary) introduction of a fixed exchange rate peg. This unexpected policy change 
exposed the risk of possible political capture of macroeconomic policy with significant 
undesirable implications37 and raised questions on the independence of the Central Bank and in 
the government’s commitment to the ECF Arrangement that it had signed with the IMF earlier in 
2012. Had the peg not been removed quickly, and in consequence, the IMF program been 
declared off-track and even possibly suspended, the decision could have affected the approval of 
much needed budget support by both Banks in the near future. Another recent example of an 
unpredicted decision was the introduction of the four-day work week for the public service in 
January 2013. Implications of this decision still have to be observed. Both Banks will continue 

28 	

	
working closely with the IMF to reach out to the government to highlight the inadvertent 
consequences of unanticipated decisions, and if need be, adjust the program accordingly. 

3.2 Macroeconomic Risks 

111. The Gambia is highly vulnerable to exogenous shocks, including commodity price 
volatility and the impact of the global economic slowdown. The main risk of the economy is 
erratic weather that cause crop failures either through droughts, as experienced in 2001/02 and 
2011/12 that led to GDP contractions, and flooding, as experienced in more isolated areas of the 
country in 2012/13  and may again lead to crop failures at present and in. Interventions especially 
in agriculture will need to be designed for taking into account these risks, and identify appropriate 
mitigation measures and responses. 
112. The ongoing global financial crisis presents considerable risks through secondary 
effects of the economic downturn on commodity prices and exports, reduced inflows from 
remittances and export services, and more restricted access to finance for both the public and 
private sectors. These downside risks are only partly mitigated by lower oil prices, as The Gambia 
is fully import dependent on oil. Other adverse external factors include the impact of external 
crisis or unfavorable climate conditions. The JPS-2, which will strengthen governance and 
improve the business environment, will help the country better deal with external and internal 
shocks.  The Banks may consider reconfiguring the program in case of unexpected emergencies. 
The team will also consider tapping into new Crisis Response Window options, if available and 
necessary. 
113. The domestic macroeconomic framework and policy conditions also represent 
significant risks for The Gambia. Public sector domestic debt, in particular, represents a 
significant risk to macroeconomic stability as (i) a high roll-over risk, since it is held entirely in 
short-term maturities (one-year or less) and (2) a risk to potential GDP growth through the 
crowding out domestic investment. Persistent, albeit recently shrinking, fiscal deficits also 
represent an important risk to growth outturns and public sector service delivery, as resources are 
diverted to debt and interest payments and by limiting fiscal space and the ability of the 
government to respond in the event of crises. Sudden and nontransparent shifts in monetary policy 
are disruptive to economic activity and undermine domestic and international confidence.  
114. While the overall objective of the JPS-2 to support the Government’s efforts to 
address challenges in the areas of poverty reduction, job creation and growth will be 
affected by the impacts of the described external and internal risk factors, the proposed 
program contributes to at least partially mitigating these risks. Given the vulnerability to 
exogenous shocks and the volatile global environment, the IMF, IDA and AfDB will continue to 
closely monitor the government’s macroeconomic performance. To date, under the IMF ECF-
supported program, has been satisfactory. The PFM reforms supported by the Banks’ budget 
support series and the IFMIS Project can also help enhance controls in executing the overall and 
sectoral budgets.

Program Implementation and Fiduciary Risks 

115. Frequent and unpredictable turnovers of Government counterparts present another 
risk for program implementation. During the JAS-1 period, several Bank programs experienced 
frequent turnovers of Government officials, including at the ministerial level. The resulting 

29 	

	
instability and uncertainty negatively affected program execution and undermined steady 
implementation. The risk of ongoing reshuffling is largely outside the control of the two Banks, 
except for two approaches: (i) to emphasize the importance of continuity for project 
implementation as part of the ongoing political dialogue, and (ii) to diversify and institutionalize 
implementation processes as much as possible to reduce dependence on individual counterparts. 
116. 
Institutional and individual capacity weaknesses pose a risk to effective and timely 
project management, and to achieving results, which has in the recent past affected Borrower 
performance ratings of projects in Implementation Completion and Results Reports.  Possible 
mitigation measures will, for example, include the option to embed an Immediate Response 
mechanism into new projects in case they are facing critical implementation delays. Further, 
implementation and fiduciary risks will be mitigated through intensive supervision from the 
Washington and Dakar Offices; such supervision will complement various capacity building 
activities (as part of the cross-cutting theme) to ensure substantial TA is provided to strengthen 
public institutions, including implementing agencies.  The JPS program will be monitored on an 
annual basis and a formal JPS mid-term review will be conducted to assess progress and 
determine the need for any revisions to the scale and scope of the proposed programs. Also, the 
Banks will strengthen their strategic communication with country counterparts, including both 
Government and key non-governmental stakeholders and other donors. Nonetheless, the residual 
risk remains substantial.

Annex 3: JAS Completion Report – FY08-11 

THE REPUBLIC OF THE GAMBIA 
JAS COMPLETION REPORT FY08-11 

Country: The Gambia 

Date of JAS 1: February 1, 2008 

Period Covered by the JAS Completion Report: February 1, 2008 – December 31, 2011 
______________________________________________________________________________ 

I. 

INTRODUCTION  

1.1 
The purpose of this JAS Completion Report (CR) is to draw lessons from the design and 
implementation of the outgoing JAS (2008-2011) and to provide guidance for the design and 
implementation of the forthcoming JAS covering the period 2012-2015. The CR is also meant to 
serve as an accountability tool for the country teams in both institutions. This introduction 
presents a brief summary of the findings of the self-evaluation and the ratings under each 
component. Section II presents a review of the progress made towards achieving the main 
country goals; whereas Section III presents the highlights of the detailed evaluation of the 
outcomes of the strategy. Section IV presents an assessment of the performance of each 
institution; and finally Section V presents key lessons and suggestions for the forthcoming JAS 
(2012-2015). 

1.2 
The design of the 2008 JAS was aligned with the PRSP II, and  focused on two pillars: 
(i) Strengthening the institutional framework for economic management and public service 
delivery, with three components including sub-components, and altogether nine outcomes, and 
(ii) Enhancing productive capacity and accelerating growth and competitiveness, with four 
components and additional eight outcomes. Pillar (i) was definitely the pillar with the stronger 
weight in terms of resource allocation, number of interventions, and attention throughout most of 
the JAS period (see details in Annex 3, Table (1), pp. 70ff). Following the JAS mid-term review 
in 2010 and as laid out in the 2010 JAS Progress Report, the JAS Results framework was 
somewhat straightened and adjusted to implementation reality, notably through the removal of 
sub-components and the dropping and/or replacement of outcomes (and related indicators) that 
were not relevant anymore, and the reduction in the number of outcomes from 17 to 14. 

1.3 
Progress towards the JAS (2008-2011) implementation has overall been moderately 
satisfactory as it achieved good progress toward all major expected outcomes. Under pillar (i) 
progress is rated overall satisfactory: Interventions by both Banks contributed towards 
macroeconomic and fiscal stabilization through budget support and the institutional support 
projects. Major achievements in this area included reforms in the legislative framework for 
budget management and public procurement and the rolling out of the Integrated Financial 
Management Information System (IFMIS) in January 2011. There has also been progress – albeit 
moderate – in the civil service reform and in strengthening the national statistical system and the 
audit function.  Progress under pillar (ii) has been moderately satisfactory. The JAS contribution 
to improving the investment climate has been positive. Intervention for the improvement of crop 
productivity and increased output of fisheries has been impressive, particularly with respect of 

36		

	
	
	
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
groundnuts and rice, up to the onset of the 2011 Sahel drought. However, extension of credit to 
smallholder farmers for the financing of agricultural inputs has been confronted with managerial 
problems and low recovery rates, and access to financial resources by MSNEs has been limited. 

1.4 
Performance by both institutions in the design and implementation of the JAS has 
overall been satisfactory. In the design of the joint strategy, the two partners pursued strategic 
selectivity and complementarity in their respective interventions and both institutions have 
supported their respective interventions with joint and separate non-lending activities (AAA), 
which are of relevance to the portfolio in support of the JAS and both institutions have been 
proactive in adjusting the JAS to changing circumstances during the Progress Report exercise. 
Both institutions delivered both the lending and non-lending activities, with adjustments to the 
changing country circumstances during the JAS implementation.  

II. 

PROGRESS TOWARDS ACHIEVING COUNTRY LEVEL GOALS 

2.1 
The Gambia’s long-term strategic goals were articulated in its Vision 2020, which 
aimed “…to transform The Gambia into a financial center, a tourist paradise, a trading export 
oriented agricultural and manufacturing nation, thriving on free market policies and a vibrant 
private sector, sustained by a well-educated, skilled, healthy, self-reliant and enterprising 
population, guaranteeing a well-balanced ecosystem and a descent standard of living for all, 
under a system of government based on the consent of the citizenry”. The current Poverty 
Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP II 2007-2011), which is the second in a series of PRSPs1, is 
based on Vision 2020 and on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). 

2.2 
PRSP II has five pillars: (i) Create an enabling policy environment to promote growth 
and poverty reduction; (ii) Enhance the capacity and output of productive sectors: agriculture, 
fisheries, industry, trade and tourism, with emphasis on productive capacities of the poor and 
vulnerable populations; (iii) Improve coverage of the basic social services and social protection 
needs of the poor and vulnerable; (iv) Enhance governance systems and build the capacity of 
local communities and civil society organizations (CSOs) to play an active role in economic 
growth and poverty reduction; and (v) Mainstreaming poverty related cross-cutting issues into 
poverty reduction. 

2.3 

The overall implementation of the PRSP II (2007-2011) has been mixed.  

 Regarding the first pillar, while the target for economic growth has been attained, fiscal 
deficit and mounting public indebtedness continue to pose a serious challenge. The 
policy and institutional reforms introduced since 2005 partly contributed to the relatively 
high GDP growth, which averaged a remarkable 6.2 percent during the period 2008-10 - 
despite the onset of the global financial crisis in 2008 - up from an average of 1.3 percent 
during the preceding 3 years. In 2011, however, the sources of growth in The Gambia 
shifted with the onset of the 2011/2012 drought, which led to a sharp contraction in crop 

1 The first PRS covered the period 2003-2005. 

37		

	
	
	
 
 
 
 
 
 
																																																								
	
production. The revival in tourism activity in the same year helped to partly offset the 
crop failure and was supported by The Gambian’s tourist industry capturing some of the 
shift in market shares due to the Arab Spring. Greater fiscal and monetary discipline 
contributed to maintaining consumer price inflation for 2011 at below 4.5 percent, down 
from 5.8 percent in 2010. However, fiscal deficit has been on the rise since 2008, 
reflecting both overspending and public revenue shortfalls. The basic fiscal balance 2 
deteriorated from a surplus of about 3 percent of GDP in 2007 to a deficit estimated at 3.3 
percent in 2010 and a projected deficit of 2.3 percent in 2012. The country continues to 
be debt-distressed 3 in spite of the HIPC relief since reaching Completion Point in 
December 2007 and the subsequent debt relief under the Multilateral Debt Relief 
Initiative (MDRI). The total debt outstanding as a ratio to GDP declined from 143.2 
percent in 2006 (pre-HIPC) to 55.1 percent in 2008 but it increased again to 68.4 percent 
in 2011.  

 Regarding the second pillar, there are proof that indicate the productive capacities of 
vulnerable population, particularly smallholder farmers, has generally improved with 
favorable weather conditions and the pricing and marketing reforms within the 
groundnuts sub-sector and the introduction of improved rice (NERICA). The agricultural 
sector has witnessed substantial growth in recent years (until the onset of the 2011 
drought) mainly due to favorable weather conditions and strong support by the 
development partners. Nevertheless it continues to be constrained by serious problems, 
which include: (i) accessibility of farmers to timely inputs and credit; (ii) increased 
agricultural productivity will be dependent on reducing the number of people currently 
(under) employed in agriculture, by generating more off-farm employment; (iii) 
weaknesses in forward linkages for creating value added through agro-processing; (iv) 
excessive losses in post-harvest handling and storage and adverse weather conditions. 

 Regarding the third pillar, the 2010 MDG Status Report concludes that there has been 
progress in the area of universal primary education, and in the ratio of girls to boys in 
primary, secondary and tertiary education. But there is still a wide gap between PRSP 
and MDG targets and the current status.  The country’s health indicators remain 
relatively good compared with other Sub-Saharan Africa countries. Infant mortality rates 
and under-five mortality rates are at par with the best in the Region. There has been less 
progress in the under-5 mortality rate and insufficient progress in maternal health and in 
combating HIV/AIDS, Malaria and other diseases. 

 Under the fourth pillar, progress in enhancing governance systems and building capacity 
in local communities has been limited. 

2 Source: IMF. Basic balance is defined as overall balance, excluding statistical discrepancy, less expenditure financed by project 
grants and external borrowing. 
3 Thanks to improvements in its CPIA rating, The Gambia has been upgraded to a medium performer, with higher policy 
thresholds for the assessment of the sustainability of its debt. This, and the inclusion of re-exports, has resulted in a decrease in 
the risk of debt distress, from high to medium in 2012. 

38		

	
	
	
 
 
 
 
																																																								
	
 Under the fifth pillar, recent estimates (2011) indicate that poverty had declined 
substantially from 58.0 percent (using the US$1.00 a day poverty line) in 20034 to 48.4 
percent (upper poverty line: US$1.25 a day)5.   

III. 

EVALUATION OF THE PROGRAM PERFORMANCE 

The JAS within The Gambia’s PRSP (2008-2011) 

3.1 The joint strategy has had a positive contribution on the Government’s PRSP over 
2008-2011. The major areas, where the two institutions had positive impact were in public 
finance management, agricultural development, basic education, health, and water and sanitation. 
The strategy’s objectives in developing the energy sector and in improving the business 
environment, however, have fallen short of the planned outcomes.  

3.2 The JAS, through budgetary support, technical assistance, and project investments 
contributed to robust economic growth and stable macroeconomic economic environment, 
which prevailed during 2008-2011. The strategy in particular focused on improving financial 
transparency and accountability in the use of public resources through institutional reforms in the 
areas of budgeting, public revenue mobilization, public procurement, and civil service reform. 
The strategy also involved the implementation of IFMIS, which was completed by the end of 
2011, and continued to provide staff training in the use of the system. Both institutions provided 
technical assistance and institutional support to bridge the eight years external auditing backlog 
existing in 2008 and have provided substantial capacity building in external and internal 
auditing. An important output of the strategy intervention was the preparation of a 
comprehensive PFM reform strategy (2010-2014), which is currently being up-dated.  

3.3 The strategy also had substantial positive impact within the agricultural sector, which 
is estimated to have grown by an average 18 percent annually during most of the JAS period. 
Most of this growth has been partly attributable to favorable weather conditions and to policy 
and institutional reforms within the groundnuts sub-sector, which have been supported by the 
joint strategy. Direct project investments in the introduction and dissemination of NARICA rice, 
support of artisanal fisheries, and integrated rural development projects have substantially 
increased output of both cash and subsistence crops and has  contributed to reduced poverty, 
improved health  and nutritional standards.  

3.4 Interventions by both institutions were expected to have contributed to improved 
public service delivery in education, health, water and sanitation, and the energy sector. 
Whereas achievements related to improved access to basic education were substantial, the impact 
of interventions within the health sector has been mainly related to improving nutritional

5 Estimations from 2010 IHS jointly conducted by the Gambia Bureau of Statistics (GBoS) and the National Planning 
Commission (NPC), and facilitated by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP).  The poverty headcount ratio was 
measured at US$ 1.25 and US$1.00 per day at purchasing power parity equivalent as a percentage of the Gambian population.

standards through support to the policy and strategic framework for nutrition and the provision of 
technical assistance for the strengthening of the National Nutrition Agency (NaNA).  

3.5 The joint strategy has had negligible direct impact on the water and sanitation sector 
during 2008-2011, as there has been no direct project investment within the sector by either 
institution. With AfDB support, a technical study to assist in the formulation of a national water 
sector reform program has been initiated, and implementation of a new Rural Water Supply and 
Sanitation Project started by mid-2012. The initial outcomes related to improved effectiveness of 
the energy sector and respective indicators were dropped following the mid-term review, since 
investments and/or technical assistance by either partner have not come forward in view of 
financial and institutional weaknesses of the National Water and Electricity Company (NaWEC). 
The initial strategic approach was replaced by a modified new outcome, aiming foremost at 
reaching an agreement with the government on priority reforms needed. An Electricity Sector 
Reform Note has been prepared, and will be followed up under the new JPS.  

3.6 The strategy’s objective of promoting a competitive investment climate has been 
achieved moderately, so far, and facilitating access to financial resources by SME’s has not 
been attained. The WB’s Doing Business Indicators reveal that the country’s ranking has 
actually deteriorated in recent years. The IDA Growth and Competitiveness Project (approved in 
late 2010) aims at improving investment climate and strengthen competitiveness in key sectors, 
with mixed results so far despite moving forward on a promising track. The Gambia component 
of the IDA West Africa Regional Communications Infrastructure Project has successfully 
connected The Gambia to the African Coast to Europe submarine communication cable. The 
AfDB regional The Gambia River Bridge Project will improve the country’s comparative 
advantage as a regional hub for transit trade and promote tourism.  

3.7 The following is a more detailed review of progress made on the two JAS pillars. 

Pillar #1: Strengthening the Institutional Framework for Economic Management 
and Public Service Delivery 

3.8 
There were three components with initially nine and finally eight outcomes under the first 
pillar (one outcome, on provision of electricity, was dropped following the 2010 JAS mid-term 
review): (i) Improving the transparency and accountability in the use of public resources (three 
outcomes); (ii) Improving civil service (one outcome); and (iii) Improving public service 
delivery in education, health and sanitation, and rural electrification (initially five and finally 
four outcomes). 

Component #1: Improving Transparency and Accountability in the use of Public 
Resources

 Outcome #1 Strengthened public financial management. Overall progress under this 

40		

	
	
	
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
outcome has been partly achieved / moderately satisfactory6, as reflected in the findings of the 
2010 Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA), the 2011 Public Expenditure 
Review (PER) Update, and the improved CPIA ratings. With support from both Banks, the 
Government has been making strides in improving its public financial management and 
transparency, benefitting from major reforms, which included updating the legislative framework 
for budget management and public procurement including a Public Financial Management 
Reforms Comprehensive Strategy for the period of 2010 to 2014. One key achievement has been 
the establishment of an Integrated Financial Management Information System (IFMIS). This 
system has improved the timeliness of financial reporting by providing monthly and 
comprehensive within-year budget execution reports and facilitating the preparation of the 
annual financial statements.7 In particular, the IFMIS system has permitted the closer control of 
the status of budget execution and of spending levels; an enhanced management of ministerial 
resources due to the access to real time information on the status of their budgets; a strengthened 
sectoral allocation, planning, and analysis; and greater effectiveness in Government expenditure 
programs by identifying cost-drivers in program activities. An IFMIS interface at the Central 
Bank has been established, ensuring real-time information on budget financing shortfalls and on 
the timing of needed public domestic borrowing, and efforts are being made to regularize the 
Human Resource records of central government employees on the IFMIS payroll. Meanwhile, 
the Gambia has also reduced the backlog of audited Government financial statements 8 , 
established a Tax Tribunal, and strengthened the internal audit function. 

3.10 Outcome #1: Strengthened Public Financial Management, the results have been very 
encouraging and are rated partly achieved/ moderately satisfactory, specifically due to the 
slow progress in the field of budget management. The Gambia Revenue Authority (GRA) 
implemented a three-year Strategic Plan (2008-2010) to up-grade staff performance and has set 
specific targets for tax collection and audit of large taxpayers. In 2009 GRA installed a new tax 
administration IT for processing large taxpayers. And GRA has now an activity based budgeting 
system in place that is linked to its mandate of collecting revenues. Further, a revised Customs 
and Excise Act was enacted in April 2010. The Customs regulations have been developed, with 
comments from extensive reviews waiting to be incorporated, at the time of the writing of this 
document. To improve public procurement, the government has up-dated the Action Plan (2011-
2016) to upgrade procurement practices agreed upon in the 2005 Country Procurement Issues 
Paper (CPIP) Action Plan. The first priority in this area is to separate the policy and regularity 
functions of the Gambia Public Procurement Authority (GPPA). Progress on the Action Plan, 
however, has been slow in view of capacity and financial constraints. 

3.11 Progress on budget management has been mixed: Semi-annual fiscal budget reports and 
monthly budget outturns are being published since 2010 and these have recently being integrated 
into IFMIS. Key PRSP public expenditures (education, health & social welfare) have since 2008 

	6	The rating of outcomes follows both WB and AfDB rules: Whereas the WB rules allow for 4 categories of outcome ratings 
(achieved, partially achieved, not achieved, and not observable), AfDB ratings are covering a 6 point scale (highly satisfactory, 
satisfactory, moderately satisfactory, moderately unsatisfactory, unsatisfactory and highly unsatisfactory). 
7The IFMIS currently produces in-year fiscal reports with an average lag of one month and reconciles most banking and fiscal

records also on a monthly basis.

been in line with the planned targets. However, there were considerable deviations in critical 
sectors relevant for the country’s development agenda – ranging from 9 percent (forestry) to 47 
percent (energy) - between initial allocations and actual expenditure for 2011, which is clearly 
not satisfactory.  A comprehensive MTEF is now anticipated to be introduced by 2013. The 
government has requested technical assistance from the IMF in this regard.  

3.12 The main instrument of support towards attaining this outcome has been the two budget 
support operations9 , which supported policy and institutional reforms in macroeconomic and 
public finance management, civil service reform, and the groundnuts sub-sector. The two 
institutional support operations: IDA’s CBEMP and AfDB’s ISPEFG were designed to 
complement the budget support programs and covered the same areas of coverage as the budget 
support. The former has mainly supported the establishment and initial roll-out of IFMIS; 
whereas the latter has provided technical assistance for the drawing up of the Public Financial 
Management Reforms Comprehensive Strategy (2010-14). Non-lending operations by both 
Banks also contributed towards attaining the outcomes. These included the CFAA exercise 
(WB/AfDB and DFID) and the WB’s: Poverty Assessment Study, PER, procurement support 
TA, and Anti-money Laundering. 

3.13 The sustainability of the gains attained under this category is at risk, however. This is 
particularly so in the case of IFMIS, whose sustainability would require further development, 
maintenance and capacity building. To mitigate such risk the government has prepared an IFMIS 
Sustainability Plan, and the needed costs were included in the 2009-2011 budget. A Follow-up 
IDA IFMIS grant (US$ 5.2 million) was approved in June 2010, and an Additional Financing 
will be included into the upcoming new JPS. 

3.14 Outcome #2: Strengthened National Statistics System: The main objective of support is to 
build capacity to process and disseminate key findings from national surveys within one year of 
data collection. Progress towards this goal has been partly achieved / moderately satisfactory. 
Most of the support in this area has been through the WB’s CBEMP and technical assistance to 
the Gambia Bureau of Statistics (GBOS), which supported the transformation of the previous 
Central Statistics Department into the GBOS, with greater autonomy. The national accounts data 
based on a new methodology were disseminated using IFMIS and NAO web-based information 
system by end-2009. Financial reporting by GBOS has also improved with the broad application 
of IFMIS and the monthly publication of the cost price indices. There is little progress, however, 
in the timely publication (within one year of data collection) of data, specifically national 
surveys, on the GBOS’s web-site; the results of the 2010 Integrated Household Survey have been 
made publicly available through the GBOS website only in early 2012.  

3.15 Outcome #3: Strengthened Audit Function: Progress in strengthening audit has been 
partly achieved / moderately satisfactory. The 8-year backlog of unaudited public accounts, 
which existed in 2008, was cleared, which is a huge accomplishment. But the timing of 
production and dissemination of audit reports has still not fully met the expectations: 
Government Financial Statements from 2008-2010 were submitted to the National Audit Office 

9 IDA’s “Public Sector Reform and Growth Grant” and AfDB’s “Poverty Reduction Budget Support.”	

42		

	
	
	
 
 
 
 
																																																								
	
for auditing only in May/June 2012, which exceeds the benchmark of one year following the end 
of the respective fiscal year. The 2011 Statements have been submitted on 20th December 2012. 
The AfDB’s ISPEFG was the main vehicle of support in capacity building since 2009; the 
recently approved ISPEFG II involves capacity building and institutional strengthening in 
internal and external audit. 

Component #2 Improving Civil Service 

3.16 Outcome #4: Enhanced HR Management Policy and Tools used In Public 
Administration: The planned outcome involves the establishment and use of an enhanced human 
resources management policy and tools in public administration. Performance under this 
component has overall been partially achieved / moderately satisfactory. A joint WB, AfDB 
and DfID study on Civil Service Reform formed the basis of the formulation of the government’s 
2008-2011 Civil Service Reform Strategy, approved by the Cabinet in mid-2009. The strategy 
envisages key reforms related to civil service salaries and performance evaluation systems. In 
implementing the strategy, the government increased civil service salaries by about 40 percent 
over 2008-09, which has helped in attracting and retaining competent staff at the higher levels of 
government. In order to facilitate decision-making, a Pay and Employment Model (basically a 
sensitivity analysis on the immediate fiscal impacts of the changes in pay and employment 
structures) was prepared with support from the WB.  The full success of the measure, however, 
has been constrained by the reduced fiscal space available to government to apply the originally 
designed pay reform (increase of 68 percent). Integration of the HR information system with the 
payroll is ongoing. An Institutional Development Fund for Civil Service Reform grant was made 
available during the JAS period to support key components in the government’s long term Civil 
Service Reform agenda, specifically in the areas of strengthening the capacity for human 
resources management, wage bill and pension management. Development of an effective 
performance appraisal tools is in the final stages, and will be piloted in The Ministries of 
Tourism, and Youth & Sports. Further activities are ongoing and include the addition of an HR 
Module in IFMIS to improve budget reporting, which is currently envisaged as one of the new 
activities to be financed under IFMIS AF. 

Component #3: Improving Public Service Delivery in Education, Health and 
Sanitation and Rural Electrification  

(a) Education 

3.17 Outcome # 5: Increased Primary Enrollment: Performance towards increased primary 
enrollment has been partially achieved/moderately satisfactory with the objectives for the JAS 
period. The Gross Enrollment Rate (GER) for lower basic education increased considerably and 
has reached 90 percent in 2012 (including certified madrassas following the regular curriculum). 
Gender parity has been met at both the lower basic and upper basic levels - helped by 
construction and rehabilitation of classrooms, separate latrines, as well as scholarships for needy 
girls provided under the IDA and EFA-FTI (Education for All – Fast Track Initiative, now: 
Global Program for Education, GPE) projects. Issues of hard to reach populations need to be 
given focused attention during the implementation of the upcoming JPS. The JAS indicator 
target of 100 percent primary enrollment, however, was not achieved.  

43		

	
	
	
 
 
 
 
 
 
3.18 Outcome #6 Increased Quality of Education: Expected progress has been partly 
achieved / moderately satisfactory: Internal efficiency is quite good in comparison with other 
countries, with a primary completion rate of 72 percent which is exceeding the JAS target of 68 
percent for the primary completion rate. However the target of 30 percent of beneficiaries of the 
in-service training program to obtain credits in English and math could not be achieved. Among 
the total of 2,730 beneficiaries, only about 20 percent, i.e. 484, took the English, and only 5 
percent, i.e. 140) the Math WASSCE, respectively, in September 2012. The results are expected 
in February 2013, but even in the best of all possible cases, the target of 30 percent will not be 
achieved. 

3.19 The WB support of basic education has been through the Third Education Project (Phase 
2) complemented by PHRD co-financing and Additional Financing. The latter introduced 
interventions on higher education and teachers training. Further, the WB has also contributed to 
improved enrollment and quality of primary education through supervision of the Education for 
All-Fast Track Initiative project and various non-lending operations. The AfDB supported the 
sector through a Basic Education Project, which was completed in June 2010.  

(b) Health 

3.20 Outcome #7: Strengthened Policy Framework for Nutrition Programs: The original 
planned outcome: “Increased number of households with access to basic health services.” was 
replaced at mid-point by: “Strengthened policy framework for nutritional programs.” Expected 
progress towards this outcome has been achieved / satisfactory: A new Nutritional Policy 
(2010-2020) has been formulated and validated in January 2011 and a costed Strategic Plan for 
Nutrition (2011-2015) has been elaborated. The policy and strategic plan have been presented in 
early 2012. There has been little direct support to the general health sector by both the AfDB and 
the WB. The AfDB Health Services Development Project was completed in 2007. The project 
may have had an impact, but it is not feasible to gauge it. The WB’s CDDP has financed 4-5 
health sub-projects; but health projects generally have not been selected by the beneficiary 
communities in this demand-driven project. The health sector may also have benefited indirectly 
from the budget support operations provided by both the WB and the AfDB 10 . To improve 
nutritional standards the WB approved in September 2010, the Rapid Response Nutrition 
Security Improvement Project, alongside a two year complementary Technical Assistance 
intervention to strengthen the National Nutrition Agency’s (NaNA) capacity to improve nutrition 
outcomes (December 2009).   

(c) Water and Sanitation 

3.21 Outcome #8: Increased access to Water and Sanitation: The original planned outcome 
“Increased number of water and sanitation connections in the Greater Banjul Area (GBA was 
recast and replaced by “Increased access to water and sanitation”, following the 2010 JAS mid-

10 Of the AfDB’s UA 4.0 million budget support operation, approved in 2009, one million was from the Africa Food Crisis 
Response (AFCR).

term review, with a view to monitor progress of new connections across the whole country, 
rather than focusing exclusively on the GBA. There has been no direct investment in the sector 
by either institution during the JAS period. Hence, the achievement of the target towards this 
outcome, of more than 100,000 people benefitting from additional water and sanitation 
connections, as established in the JAS Progress Report, cannot be observed. The AfDB in 
preparation for future operations within the sector approved in 2010 a National Water Sector 
Reform Study to support the formulation of a National Water Sector Reform Program. Further 
progress in this regard is anticipated through the currently ongoing AfDB Water Supply and 
Sanitation Project11, approved in February 2012.  

(d) Provision of Electricity 

3.22 Outcome #9: Increased number of Households with access to electricity in targeted areas: 
The original planned outcome towards this goal was: “Increased number of households with 
access to electricity in targeted areas, and cannot be observed, since envisaged interventions 
towards this objective did not materialize. Following the mid-term review, new outcomes for 
energy sector support were included under pillar 2. 

JAS Pillar (2): Enhancing Productive Capacity and Accelerating Growth and 
Competitiveness. 

3.23 The second pillar under the original JAS involved four components and eight planned 
outcomes. The four original components were: (i) Promoting a Competitive Investment 
Climate/Growth and Competitiveness (3 outcomes); (ii) Facilitating Access to Financial 
Resources by MSMEs; (one outcome); (iii) Strengthening the Agricultural Sector (two 
outcomes); and (iv) enabling the environment of the Energy Sector (two outcomes). Following 
the mid-term review, three of the original components remained the same; the third component, 
however, has been expanded to read: “Strengthening the Agricultural Sector and Rural 
Development.” The number of expected outcomes was reduced from eight to four with three of 
the four original outcomes being reformulated. Pillar (2) has proven to be more difficult to assess 
than pillar (1) in view of the lack of available baseline information and data collection problems, 
except for agriculture. Thus, assessment at the end of the JAS period is based on general trends. 
In cases where the linkage between the planned outcomes and outputs is weak, changes have 
been introduced in the outcomes. 

Component #1: Promoting a Competitive Investment Climate/Growth and 
Competitiveness 

3.24 Outcome #10: The three original planned outcomes: “Increased number of tourists,” 
“increased volume of agribusiness exports,” and “increased credit to private sector,” were 
replaced by a single outcome: “Improved business climate” because of lack of credible 
indicators, measured by revised indicators, i.e.“monetary value of new private investment 

11AfDB UA 1.1 million, plus Euro 4.0 million from the Rural Water and Supply & Sanitation Initiative.	

45		

	
	
	
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
																																																								
	
attracted in JAS period through GIPFZA12 (since 2008)” with a target value of US$55 million, 
and “Time and cost of new company registration” (targets: 20 days at cost of not more than 190 
percent of per capita income, down from 215 percent at mid-term). Program performance overall 
is promising and progress is partially been achieved/moderately satisfactory. Progress in 
terms of value of new private investment (actual investments) through GIEPA has surpassed the 
target: In addition to investments of US$ 30 million in 200813, GIEPA received in 2010 seven 
new private sector investment proposals with a total proposed investment value of about US$ 
30.4 million14. Corresponding figures for 2011 were 13 investment proposals the value of which 
stood at US$ 60.0 million. The 2013 Doing Business Report indicators, however, show that the 
time required for registering a business was still 27 days, in contrast to 34 days for sub-Sahara 
Africa, whereas the cost of business registration (158.7 percent of per capita income) by far 
exceeded that of sub-Sahara (67.3 percent), but still met the very conservative target value. 
Doing Business Indicators depict that the country’s rank for doing business has slightly 
improved from 149 in 2012 to 147 in 2013. 

3.25 
In support of this component the WB approved in September 2010 the Growth and 
Competitiveness Project with its primary objective to improve investment climate and strengthen 
competitiveness of key sectors in the economy. The project involves improving business 
environment through business registration and tax administration reforms and the strengthening 
of MSMEs through access to finance, marketing, and skills promotion in key sectors of the 
economy (horticulture, groundnuts, tourism, etc.). In addition, the WB implemented a small 
Trust Fund operation to create small enterprises for the development and distribution of fuel 
efficient stoves and biomass briquettes.  

3.26 Two other regional operations were approved, one by the WB and the other by the AfDB, 
which will have a positive impact on economic growth and competitiveness, in the long run. The 
IDA-funded West Africa Regional Communications Infrastructure (approved in March 2011) 
aims at connecting 23 countries to the Africa Coast to Europe submarine cable, and has 
established a landing station with private sector involvement in The Gambia. The AfDB 
combined resources from the regional allocation and the ADF for the financing of “Gambia 
River Bridge Project” (approved in September 2011). The bridge constitutes the key component 
for the Trans-Gambia Road Transport Corridor, which is an economic and strategic link 
connecting the northern and southern parts of both The Gambia and Senegal, and with this, other 
ECOWAS countries through the corridor between Dakar and Lagos. The AfDB’s planned 
“Private Sector Profile Study” has not been undertaken. 

Component (2) Facilitating Access to Financial Resources by SMEs 

3.27 Outcome #11: The original outcome: “Improved access to finance” has been 
reformulated to: “Improved access to finance for MSMEs” and the indicator has been changed 

14 Not including an exceptionally high investment proposal of US$ 450 million.

to: “Number of (direct) clients served through microfinance components of EPMDP and IFC 
support” with a target of 10,000. Overall, expected results have not been achieved, and progress 
has been unsatisfactory as there has been limited progress in microfinance and almost no 
progress at all in SME finance. The AfDB’s Entrepreneurship Promotion and Microfinance 
Development Project (EPMDP) over 2009-2011 extended about GMD2 million15 to 567 small-
holders for the financing of agricultural inputs. The IFC aims to improve access to finance 
through microfinance institutions and trade finance through local banks. Estimates by the Central 
Bank put the number of microfinance clients at the end of 2009 at 158,000, compared to 144,500 
at the end of 2008 and 129,000 at the end of 2007, but attribution to IFC interventions could not 
be established. Total loans outstanding increased from GMD 233 million at end of 2007 to GMD 
271 million at end of 2009.  

Component (3) Strengthening the Agricultural & Rural Development Sector. 

3.28 Outcome #12: The original outcome: “Improved productivity of crops, livestock, and 
forestry” has been recast to: “Improved productivity of crops and livestock production and 
fishery.” Progress under this outcome has overall been achieved/ satisfactory to the most part, 
mainly due to the strong support to the sector by both Banks and the good weather conditions 
which prevailed during the period under review until the onset of the 2011 Sahel drought. 
Groundnuts output increased from 110,000 MT in 2008 to 122,000 MT and 138,000 MT in the 
subsequent two years. Paddy rice over the same period increased from 11,400 MT in 2008 to 
61,000 MT in 2010. Rice has benefited from the widespread adoption by farmers of the new 
NARICA variety, introduced through the AfDB’s regional NARICA Rice Development Project. 
Groundnuts also benefited from the marketing and pricing policy reforms of the two budget 
support operations and by IDA’s Gateway Project. There has been, however, limited progress in 
 the livestock and forestry improvements to date. Fish output increased from 46,000 tons to about 
50,000 tons over 2008-2010. The AfDB in 2009 approved an NTF supplementary Artisanal 
Fisheries Development Project16, which involved improvement of fisheries infrastructure and 
facilities; strengthening of the fisheries department; monitoring and control and a credit program.  

3.29 The AfDB had seven ongoing agricultural operations at the start of the JAS in 2008: (i) 
Farmer Managed Rice; (ii) NERICA Dissemination;(iii) Peri-Urban Agricultural Development; 
(iv) Artisanal Fisheries Development; (v) Participatory Integrated Water Shed; (vi) 
Entrepreneurship Promotion & Microfinance; and (vii) Community Skills Improvement. Of 
these seven operations, only the Supplementary Artisanal Fisheries Development and NARICA 
Dissemination are still on-going. Two new projects were approved during the JAS period; these 
are: The Livestock and Horticulture Development Project and the Sustainable Land Management 
Project. The IDA portfolio had one ongoing operation covering rural development including the 
agricultural sector at the start of the JAS, the CDDP. Three new projects were approved by the 
WB in the course of the JAS: The West Africa Agricultural Productivity Program complements 
AfDB’s NERICA Rice Project through the establishment of regional centers of excellence in 
agricultural research centered on new crop varieties and regional dissemination of new

technologies. The Gambia Emergency Agriculture Production Project was approved in January 
2010 with resources from the Global Food Crisis Response Trust Fund. Its main objective was to 
improve access to agricultural inputs, equipment, and postharvest storage capacity by targeted 
farmers. Outputs by far surpassed the envisaged targets by far: As to WB project monitoring 
reports, more than 60,000 farmers had received improved seeds and recommended fertilizer by 
early 2011 (as compared to the initial target of 20,000), and 870 farmer groups received farm 
machineries (as compared to 667 initially expected). The number of beneficiaries of pesticide 
distribution could not be established.  The GEF-funded Integrated Biodiversity Management 
Project was approved in December 2010. Its main objective was in support of the MDG 
environmental sustainability goal.  

3.30 Outcome #13: Improved prevention and locust early waning reaction: Progress in 
improving prevention and early warning of locusts’ infestations has been achieved/ satisfactory, 
as the WB’s regional Locust Project established facilities, which reduced response time from 30 
to an estimated one day. 

Component (4): Enabling the Environment for Development of the Energy Sector. 

3.31 Outcome # 14: Intervention for reform of Electricity Sector agreed with Government. 
This outcome has replaced the original two outcomes: “Secure funding for investments identified 
in new Electricity Master Plan” and “PURA applies new tariff”. Progress under this outcome 
has been moderately unsatisfactory. Private sector investments within the electricity sector 
have not materialized mainly due to concerns related to the effectiveness and efficiency of the 
National Water and Electricity Company (NAWEC) and its lack of ability to undertake much 
needed internal reforms, and to assure revenues needed for investments aimed at reducing 
transmission and distribution losses.   

IV. 

INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE 

Design of the Strategy 

4.1 
The strategy design has been satisfactory as it focused narrowly on two of the five 
pillars of the PRSP II: (i) strengthening the institutional framework for economic management 
and public service delivery, and (ii) enhancing productive capacity and accelerating growth and 
competitiveness. Given IDA’s and AfDB’s concessional resource constraint, as well as the 
country’s limited absorptive capacity, the original JAS program focused on mainly four areas17: 
(i) policy reforms and institutional support; (ii) agriculture and rural development; (iii) water and 
sanitation; and (iv) private sector development. In this respect the JAS avoided committing fresh 
funds, where other development partners were already engaged, or where there are on-going 
operations, such as health, nutrition, telecommunication, power generation, and transport.  

4.2 
In selecting the areas of engagement and instruments, the strategy addressed 
priority needs for promoting sustainable poverty-alleviation growth. The first pillar was 

17Excluding on-going operations prior to 2008. 

48		

	
	
	
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
																																																								
	
relevant to the PRSP II so as to prepare the way for sustainable growth; it also complemented the 
IMF’s efforts in restoring macroeconomic stability and laid the foundations for improved 
financial management. The first pillar also included operations (mostly ongoing) to improve 
public service delivery in health, education and water and sanitation standards.  

4.3 
The second pillar is also relevant to the country’s PRSP II as it focused on accelerating 
poverty-reduction growth through enhancing agricultural yields and improving the business 
environment. The second pillar complemented the first pillar as it addressed issues related to 
poverty alleviation through improved accessibility to credit for micro, small, and medium 
enterprises (MSMEs).  

4.4 
The JAS recognized that some of the outcome indicators do not exist and used 
milestones and other general indicators as proxy to outcomes. Some outcome indicators had 
to be reformulated following the JAS mid-term review, because of little direct support in the 
respective sectors.  

4.5 
Several of the identified critical risks have materialized. The risk pertaining to the 
vulnerability of the economy to external shocks has materialized by the sharp increase in the 
prices of food and energy in the 1980s, and subsequently by the global financial crisis, which 
adversely affected tourism and remittances. The risk relating to the deterioration of the 
macroeconomic position has also materialized in view of the increased public expenditure, 
increased domestic borrowing, and the relative decline in public revenues (2.4-2.5). Risks 
relating 
to governance, shortage 
in absorptive capacity and relatively week project 
implementation continue to pose risks to sustained growth and development. 

4.6 
Both banks have been proactive in adjusting the JAS to changing circumstances and 
priorities.  The AfDB responded to the sharp increase in food and fuel prices in 2008 by 
increasing the amount it had allocated for budget support (US $ 4.5 million) by 30percent to help 
the country in absorbing the increase in the international prices of food and fuel. Also in 
response to the food crisis, the AfDB restructured two ongoing agricultural operations18 with the 
objective of increasing food production. At the request of the government, the AfDB has also 
financed the Gambia Bridge Project (Regional). The WB, in reacting to the potential adverse 
impact of food shortages approved the Emergency Agricultural Development Project. Following 
the mid-term review, the WB shifted emphasis from the general health sector to improving 
nutrition security. In this respect the WB initiated a Rapid Social Response Operation on 
nutrition and complemented it with a Technical Assistance project. The AfDB opted to assist the 
country in the formulation of a national water sector reform program prior to investment in the 
sector. The outcome matrix following the mid-term review has been adjusted to reflect changing 
circumstances. The changes involved the reduction in the number of the planned outcomes from 
seventeen to thirteen and the adjustment in four of the remaining outcomes.

Program Implementation 

4.7 
The Banks’ overall program implementation has been satisfactory. Both Banks have 
delivered the planned lending and non-lending activities although there have been some 
modifications to adapt to changing country conditions and needs. In terms of  analytical and 
advisory activities (AAA), the following activities were delivered: (i) in support of strengthened 
public financial management the following activities were undertaken: (i) the CFAA exercise 
(AfDB/WB/DFID); (ii) Public Expenditure Review (WB); (iii) Procurement Support TA (WB); 
(iv) ROSC with focus on auditing and accounting; (v) Poverty Assessment. In the area of Civil 
Service Reform the following studies and TA were provided: (i) Civil Service Reform Study 
(AfDB/WB/DFID); (ii) Pay and Employment Model (WB); (ii) in support of governance the 
AfDB carried out a Governance Profile and a Gender Profile, whereas the WB provided TA in 
Anti-Money Laundering. In support of the national statistical system the WB provided TA for 
the Transformation of the Central Statistics Department into GBOS. In support of its portfolio in 
the education sector the WB undertook the following: (i) Multi-Grade Reading Initiative; (ii) 
Reaching out-of-school children & Building Skills for youth Employment Study; (iii) Education 
Country Status Report Light; (iii) in support of its operations within the health sector, the WB 
provided TA for the National Nutrition Agency (NaNA) and in support of the agricultural sector 
it carried out a CDDP Impact Evaluation and an Agricultural Sector Policy Note. Within the 
infrastructure sector, the AfDB financed the Banjul Port Design Study.  

4.8 
The above studies and TA work were of immediate relevance to the development process 
of the Gambia and contributed to the policy design of the JAS and to individual project design. 
Most of the work has been carried out by professional and specialized staff and thus are 
generally of credible quality. The reports were disseminated widely. Most of these reports were 
posted on the respective web-sites (AfDB/WB/Government). The following are planned to be 
posted in GBOS’ web-site shortly: Integrated Household Budget Survey (2010); the Poverty 
Profile; the Multiple Indicators Cluster Survey, the Malaria Survey, and the Information 
Communication Technology Survey. 

Cooperation between the AfDB and WB within the JAS Context: 

4.09 Cooperation between the AfDB and the WB within the context of the JAS has been 
successful. The first AfDB/WB JAS (2008-2011) was initiated in response to the need for 
harmonizing development assistance in The Gambia in line with the Paris Declaration on Aid 
Effectiveness. It was an attempt by both institutions to align their strategies and programs and 
optimize their respective technical expertise. The partnership between the two institutions 
resulted in complementarity and synergy through their lending and non-lending operations 
(AAA). Both institutions supported policy and institutional reforms in the area of public finance 
management. Whereas the AfDB focused on tax revenues, public audit, increased budgetary 
allocations for poverty related aspects, the WB focused on improved budgeting, civil service 
reform and price and marketing reforms in the groundnuts subsector.  

4.10 
In the area of technical assistance and institutional support, the AfDB focused on 
macroeconomic and public finance management, whereas the WB focused on capacity 
building in IFMIS. Intervention through institutional support and technical assistance provided 

50		

	
	
	
 
 
 
 
 
 
synergy to the policy and institutional reforms supported through the budget support operations 
by both institutions, particularly in the area of public audit, macroeconomic modeling, financial 
budgeting and planning and accounting for PRSP expenditures. 

4.11 There is a general consensus amongst the country teams in both institutions that the 
first JAS exercise has been an effective tool for coordinating strategies and streamlining the 
lending and non- lending programs and activities, but there is still room to improve upon 
the process. The consensus was that there has been very useful collaboration in the budget 
support process, as there is an already established institutional process for that purpose. Similarly 
the collaboration was very effective in the education sector, where the government plays the 
leading role in coordinating development partners’ intervention. Discussion amongst country 
teams has concluded that there is a need for a mechanism for closer collaboration - at the country 
team level - in other major sectors of focus such as agriculture, regional integration, 
infrastructure, and energy. This is particularly so in view of the relatively weak government-
donor development coordination in the field. Cooperation between the two institutions in The 
Gambia was further consolidated by the joint portfolio review exercise undertaken in 2011.  

4.12 Efforts by the WB and AfDB to attract more development partners into the JAS 
process have failed. However, donor coordination in general has been strengthened within the 
overall context of budget support. The Gambia General Budget Support Program (GBSP) has 
been jointly designed and monitored by the government, the AfDB, the WB and the European 
Union (despite the latter not being a party to the JAS). A draft MOU outlining the modalities for 
implementing and monitoring the program has been developed and a Joint Policy Reform Matrix 
has also been developed. Semi-annual joint reviews of progress in the policy framework have 
been undertaken. Notwithstanding these positive developments, the government’s lead role in 
donor coordination remains weak because of capacity constraints - despite several efforts by the 
JAS partners to strengthen the Aid Coordinating Agency in the Ministry of Finance and 
Economic Affairs. 

4.13 
Joint Monitoring and Evaluation: The JAS outcome matrix provides a good framework 
for the contribution of each institution to the development effort of The Gambia. However, there 
is a need to improve upon the choice and quantitative indicators for the planned outcomes. The 
mid-term review is another important tool of the joint M&E process. In addition, both 
institutions take advantage of the semi-annual budget support review meetings, held semi-
annually in Banjul, to review progress in the implementation of the JAS and streamline their 
respective programs. There is a need, however, to link more closely the JAS implementation 
monitoring system to the Government’s PRSP monitoring. 

Assessment of Country Capacity in Project Implementation 

4.14 Capacity Development: The Civil Service Reform Study, which was jointly financed by 
both institutions (AAA) and which was finalized in 2009 concluded the following: (i) the size of 
the civil service and the wage bill were relatively reasonable compared to similar countries. (ii) 
Staff composition emerged as a critical issue, mainly in view of the loss in upper grade staffs: it 
has been estimated that the period 2003-2007 witnessed a 14 percent decline in managerial staff 
(grades 11-12), whereas senior staff (grades 9-10) and junior staff have declined by 39 percent, 

51		

	
	
	
 
 
 
 
 
and 5 percent respectively, whereas the semi-skilled and unskilled (grades 1-3) have increased by 
31 percent. (iii) A major cause of staff attrition has been the low salaries and benefits. (iv) 
Human resource management has been accorded low priority. Efforts by both institutions during 
JAS-1 has been focused on building capacity in the areas of macroeconomic management, 
budgeting, public finance management, external and internal audit use and maintenance of 
IFMIS and in national accounts and CPI (3.14-3.16). The forthcoming JAS will continue to focus 
in public finance management areas, including MTEF, audit, and IFMIS.  

4.15 The Joint AfDB/WB/GoTG Country Portfolio Performance Review undertaken in April 
2011 has concluded that project implementation continues to be weak. Some of the major 
factors, which contribute to weak implementation include: (i) inadequate funding of counterpart 
funding of development projects; (ii) prolonged administrative delays in processing duty-waivers 
for project goods and activities; (iii) weak capacity of PIU staff in the areas of procurement, 
monitoring and evaluation; (iv) weak communication between the Banks and the coordinating 
agency in the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development and the PIUs.  

V. 

KEY LESSONS AND SUGGESTIONS FOR THE NEW JPS 

Key Lessons Learned 

5.1 
The undertaking of this AfDB/WB JAS-1 completion report is a step forward in the 
cooperation between the two institutions, but more needs to done to harmonize the 
processing in both institutions for joint JAS. The processing of this Completion Report has 
been faced with difficulties because of lack of procedures specifically laid out for a Joint 
Partnership strategy completion reports. Further problems were encountered because of 
inadequate budgeting on the part of the AfDB associated with direct hire.  

5.2 
The role of the AfDB’s country team and the review process of the design and 
program assessment of country strategies need to be revisited. There has been very little 
interaction between the sectoral departments and the country program department, beyond 
country team meetings. Thus, there may arise a risk of disconnect between the strategy process 
and the programming process. It is therefore suggested that management of the AfDB should 
revisit the design of country strategy process to strengthen the link between the strategy and 
country programming.  

5.3 
Collaboration with other Development Partners needs to be further improved. Other 
major development partners, who were active during the JAS period, include the IMF, the EU, 
DFID, IsDB, UNDP, and Japan. The IMF has mainly provided TA in the area of revenue 
mobilization, national accounts, and CPI data. DFID has been active in the area of TA in 
financial management and poverty alleviation. The EU has supported poverty alleviation through 
food security and income generation, decentralization, infrastructure development, energy and 
agriculture and rural development. The UNDP has been active in governance reforms, poverty 
alleviation, decentralization, and education. The IsDB invested in health, education and 
infrastructure; whereas Japan has supported operations within the education, agricultural and 
rural development. Attempts to draw other development partners into the JAS partnership have 
not been successful, as most of the bilateral partners insisted on following their own procedures.  

52		

	
	
	
 
 
 
 
 
 
5.4 
There is need to improve upon the programming aspect of the JAS at the design 
phase. The planned JAS program for the AfDB was UA 15.00 million, whereas actual 
commitments stood at UA 89.28 million – a six folds increase. Similarly the WB planned JAS 
program amounted to US$ 20.25 million, whereas actual commitments stood at US$ 98.21 
million – 5.6 times more than the planned amount. Most of the increase in both institutions was 
due to inclusion of projects, which were not factored in during the JAS design phase and which 
were financed from multinational allocations or from special accounts. Attempts should be made 
to factor in “potential projects” at the JPS design phase for regional projects and special accounts 
and to ensure that the proposed projects are consistent with the strategy.  

5.5 
A lesson learned from the mid-term review is the need to improve upon the quality 
of the outcome matrix by identifying appropriate outcomes, which can be quantified, and for 
which baseline data exist. Difficulties in this area were evident during the mid-term review, 
following which the number of outcomes was reduced from seventeen to thirteen and 
adjustments incorporated in four of the retained thirteen outcomes. 

Recommendations for the Forthcoming JPS (2012-2015) 

5.6 
The two pillars of the 2008-2011 JAS continue to be consistent with the 
Government’s PAGE (2012-2015). The first JAS pillar corresponds to pillars (iii) and (v) of 
PAGE, whereas the second pillar of JAS corresponds to pillars (i), (ii), and (v). Thus, based on 
the PAGE and the need to consolidate the gains attained under JAS 2008-2011, it is proposed 
that the forthcoming JPS 2012-2015 should maintain Pillar I of JAS-1. Focus under component 
#1 should be geared to support the major policy reforms in the next budget support program. 
Potential outcomes under component #1 may include revising and updating the current PFM 
program (2010-2014), measures to improve domestic resource mobilization, including tax 
reforms (replacement of the current sales tax with VAT), public procurement reform, and the 
introduction of a three-year MTEF rolling program, adequate budget allocations for the 
maintenance and capacity building of IFMIS, consistent with the government’s IFMIS 
Sustainability Plan.  

5.7 
The on-going institutional support and technical assistance operations (AfDB’s 
ISPEFG II and IDA’s IFMIS project) complement the policy and institutional reform 
agenda. Any fresh commitments of funds should be devoted to building capacity in PFM 
monitoring and evaluation, internal and external audit, design and implementation of MTEF. The 
forthcoming JPS should also consider pursuing further the civil service reform (component #2) 
through the application of the enhanced human resources management policy and tools in public 
administration. Public service delivery (Component #3) should continue to focus on basic 
education, and water and sanitation.  

5.8 
The components under pillar II of the 2008-2011 JAS need to be reformulated to be 
more strategically focused, yet catering for the investments introduced in infrastructure and 

53		

	
	
	
 
 
 
 
 
 
regional development19. Components 1 and 2 could be revisited and/or collapsed. The focus of 
pillar II, however, should be on the agricultural sector and rural development (Component 3), 
where the strategy should be on poverty alleviation and improved food security. The success of 
the JAS within the agricultural sector should be consolidated with further appropriate 
intervention. To contribute towards food security and to improve nutritional standards, it is 
proposed that the forthcoming JPS should consider expansion in rice production, following 
success of NERICA Rice Dissemination Project. Component #4 “creating an enabling 
environment for development of the energy sector” could be pursued further, within a new 
component relating to infrastructure.  

5.9 
There is need for both institutions to build on the established partnership during 
JAS-1, through closer collaboration in critical sectors such as agriculture, regional infrastructure, 
and energy. The institutions should also improve dialogue with the government and with other 
development partners. Coordination between the JPS partners and other development partners 
has already received a big boost through the semi-annual budget review meetings. There is a 
need however, to build capacity within the government to enable them play the leading role in 
donor coordination. There is also a need to improve the outreach to civil society, particularly 
during the JPS design phase, to include the private sector, members of the National Assembly, 
political leaders, and opinion leaders.

Annex 4: The Gambia Country Climate Fact Sheet 

INTRODUCTION: This document is prepared as part of the African Development 
Bank’s preparatory activities for the development of The Gambia’s Country Strategy 
Paper (CSP) for the period 2012 – 2016. The objective is to promote climate proof 
investments and climate resilient development in the country through mainstreaming of 
climate change concerns into the country’s CSP. The Fact Sheet also identifies a range of 
investment activities that the AfDB and WB could jointly finance in their support to the 
country’s efforts to pursue sustainable development, particularly in the implementation of 
its Program for Accelerated Growth and Employment (PAGE - 2011- 2015). 

GENERAL CLIMATE CONTEXT OF THE COUNTRY: Temperatures in The 
Gambia generally increase from the coast towards the west. In the hottest season of April 
to June (AMJ, the hottest (inland) regions have averages temperatures of up to 35°C, 
seasons. Mean monthly wet‐season rainfall varies between 150 and 300mm between the 
whilst the cooler coastal regions are 25 to 28°C. In the cooler seasons of October to 
December and January to March (OND and JFM) average temperatures can be below 
25°C at the coast and up to 30°C in the west. The Gambia has distinct dry and rainy 
northern and southern extremes.  
RECENT CLIMATE TRENDS: Mean annual temperature has increased by 1.0°C 
since 1960, an average rate of 0.21°C per decade.  The rate of increase is most rapid in 
OND, at 0.32°C per decade. Available data indicate that the average number of ‘hot’ 
nights per year increased by 7.8percent between 1960 and 2003. Linear trends indicate 
that wet season rainfall in The Gambia has decreased significantly between 1960 and 
2006, at an average rate of 8.8mm per month per decade. 

FUTURE CLIMATE SCENARIOS: Recent scenario analysis produced by the UNDP 
Climate Change Country Profiles for The Gambia. The mean annual temperature is 
projected to increase by 1.1 to 3.1°C by the 2060s, and 1.8 to 5.0°C by the 2090s. All 
wet season. Projected annual change ranges from ‐23 to +18percent by the 2090s, with 
projections indicate substantial increases in the frequency of days and nights that are 
considered ‘hot’ in current climate. Projections of mean annual rainfall averaged over the 
ensemble means between 0 and ‐3percent. Projected changes ranges from ‐53 to 
+74percent by the 2090s, with ensemble means between ‐7 and ‐ 20percent. Despite the 
country from different models in the ensemble project a wide range of increases and 
decreases in precipitation for The Gambia, but tend towards decreases, particularly in the 
to sea‐level rise as sea‐level in this region is projected to rise by between 0.13 and 0.56 
projected decreases in total rainfall, the proportion of total annual rainfall that falls in 
heavy events tends towards increases in the ensemble projections. The IPCC (2007) 
regional projections indicate that the coastal lowlands of The Gambia may be vulnerable 
under different scenarios (Christensen et al. 2007). 
TRENDS IN EXTREME WEATHER SCENARIOS: Climate change will magnify 
natural disasters’ severity in terms of intensity and frequency in The Gambia. Substantial 
increases in the frequency of days and nights that are considered ‘hot’ in current climate 

66

	
	
	
	
	
 
 
 
 
are expected from climate change projections. ‘Hot’ days40 will occur on 22‐48percent of 
days by the 2060s, and 25‐69percent of days by the 2090s. Days considered ‘hot’ by 
season of July to September. Projected increases in hot days and nights are more rapid in 
current climate standards for their season may increase most rapidly during the rainy 
the east of the country than the west. The proportion of total annual rainfall that falls in 
heavy events tends towards increases in the ensemble projections. It is expected that there 
will be increasing frequency of extreme weather events evident in terms of floods and 
drought in the country.  

COUNTRY VULNERABILITY: The Gambia is one of the most vulnerable countries 
in Africa to the adverse impacts of climate change. With approximately 50percent of the 
total land area being less than 20m above sea level, and about 33percent of the country 
below 10m above mean sea level, any significant global warming-induced sea level rise 
could submerge much of the country. Currently, about 20percent of the country is 
flooded annually and the mangrove ecosystems are already affected by saline intrusion as 
well as flooding. Erratic rainfall patterns impact on freshwater reserves and increased 
evaporation affects groundwater 
replenishment. The country’s First National 
Communication projected that about 92 sq. km of land in the coastal zone will be 
inundated as result of 1m sea level rise. This suggests that the whole of the capital city of 
Banjul will be lost due to the fact that the greater part of the city is below 1m, with losses 
estimated at 217 million US Dollars as at 2003. The other key sectors of The Gambia that 
are considered most vulnerable to climate change are water resources, forestry, 
agriculture, fisheries and energy, and health, and their potential vulnerabilities have been 
elaborated in the country’s NAPA. In particular, agriculture which is about 99percent 
rain-fed is extremely vulnerable to climate. This sector’s contribution to GDP is about 
30percent and its share of the workforce is about 70percent. 

COUNTRY CLIMATE CHANGE STRATEGY: Gambia has recognized the need to 
address the challenge of climate change seriously, and has put in place many policies and 
strategies towards promoting climate resilient economy and society. Some of the polices 
and measures to directly or indirectly address the adverse impacts of climate change 
include (i) National Adaptation Program of Action (NCC/NAPA, 2007); (ii)  The Gambia 
Environmental Action Plan II (GEAP, 2010); (iii) Nationally Appropriate Mitigation 
Actions (NCC/NAMA, 2011); (iv) National Disaster Management Act (2008); (v) 
Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper II (2007 – 2011); (vi) Program for Accelerated Growth 
and Employment - PAGE(2011 – 2015), which integrated climate change in the 
development strategies. Its pillar 5 has critical elements of environment, disaster risk 
reduction and climate change treated as cross-cutting issues; ; (vii) establishment of the 
National Climate Committee in 1992; and (viii) submission of the First National 
Communication to the UNFCCC (NCC/FNC) in  2003). The encompassing strategic 
approach of these initiatives is the pursuit of low-carbon high resilient infrastructure for 
sustainable development. In addition, the Government of The Gambia has been 
partnering with many donors to implement many projects that have significant bearing to 
the issues of climate change.  

67

	
	
	
	
 
 
 
COUNTRY MITIGATION POLICY: As climate change is mainly due to the 
concentration of greenhouse gases (GHG) in the atmosphere that results in global 
warming, any mitigation strategy will have to reduce the emissions of these gases and/or 
enhance the carbon sinks. The country’s First National Communication to the UNFCCC 
in 2003 identified options for reducing emissions of GHGs and for the greater 
sequestration of these gases. These options include:  
 Reduction of the use of fossil fuel in the generation of electricity especially in the 
rural areas;  
 Promotion of improved cooking stoves;  
 Carbon sequestration through reforestation and the protection of existing forests;  
 
Integrated crop and livestock farming; and  
 Large scale introduction of Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) to displace fuel wood  

There is a serious ongoing attempt to promote alternatives to conventional energy sources 
and secure of greater private sector participation.  
COUNTRY ADAPTATION POLICY: 
In response to the challenges of climate hazards and climate change the Government 
completed the formulation of the National Adaptation Plan of Action (NAPA) in 2007 
which provides a policy framework to address the impact of climate change at national 
and local levels. The main goal of the NAPA is the identification of priority adaptation 
activities. Building upon 
the existing coping strategies 
implemented by 
local 
communities in order to enhance their adaptation capacity NAPA seeks to: (1) understand 
the main characteristics of climate hazards in The Gambia (flood, drought, salt water 
intrusion); (2) understand coping mechanisms to climate hazards and climate change at 
the local and national levels; (3) understand existing programs and institutional 
arrangements for addressing climate hazards and climate change; (4) identify and 
prioritize adaptation activities to climate hazards and climate change. Key national 
adaptation measures are given in Table 9.

1) Projections proposed have been modeled based on progress made in the latest available 5 year period. This reflects the assumption that the latest five year period and consequently a time 
span that starts after the adoption of the Millennium Declaration (2001) and the Monterrey Consensus (2002) provides a more adequate picture of the impact of the MDGs on policies 
implemented and respective donor support received by a current government or its immediate predecessor. Projections on MDG progress on this basis indicate the prospects of achieving the 
targets, in case most recent policies were continued to be implemented in the same way in the years to come – and/or donor support in a respective sector would be maintained at the current 
level. These projections also reflect more accurately any backdrops due to more recent events; i.e. the 2011 Sahel drought and related food crisis might have contributed to seriously delaying 
progress on MDG 1: undernourishment.``

15This rate compares favorably by the sub-Sahara African average of 39%, but is still considerably higher than the 16% 
(2012) in neighboring Senegal. Acute malnutrition remains stubbornly close to the WHO threshold criteria of 10% for 
targeted relief interventions. In 2010, the rate was estimated at 9.5% (as compared to 8.9% back in 2000, Senegal’s

23Access to finance has been made more difficult recently because of the crowding out of the domestic financial market 
by substantial T-bill emissions by the government to finance debt obligations. The Micro-Finance sector operates 
without regulations which put clients at risk and obliges them to accept loans at very high costs. Formal credit to the 
agriculture sector heavily depends on commercial banks, which mostly limit their exposure to large, short-term loans 
24The steady and drastic decline in NAWEC’s financial performance was triggered to a large degree by the rise in crude 
oil prices (the country's main fuel for power generation) from 2008 onwards for which NAWEC was unable to raise 
offsetting revenues. 
25This is in line with international research findings showing the link between land ownership and related incentives for 
more substantial investments on land, and productivity. The World Bank is currently planning to undertake more 
detailed analytical study on land governance in several countries in the sub-region, including in The Gambia. 
26Other measures put in place to support the quality of teaching included additional learning opportunities for primary 
teachers at the Gambia College, improved content knowledge through long distance learning and strengthened 
supervision of teaching practice for student teachers. Progress has also been made in addressing teacher supply. 
27The IFMIS currently produces in-year fiscal reports with an average lag of one month and reconciles most banking 
and fiscal records also on a monthly basis. In particular, the IFMIS system has permitted the closer control of the status 
of budget execution and of spending levels; an enhanced management of ministerial resources due to the access to real 
time information on the status of their budgets; a strengthened sectoral allocation, planning, and analysis; and greater 
effectiveness in Government expenditure programs by identifying cost-drivers in program activities. An IFMIS 
interface at the Central Bank has been established, ensuring real-time information on budget financing shortfalls and on 
the timing of needed public domestic borrowing, and efforts are being made to regularize the Human Resource records 
of central government employees on the IFMIS payroll. 
28The Government financial statements for 2008, 2009, and 2010 have been submitted to the National Audit Office.

parameters. The allocation is currently firm for FY12 (SDR 9 million) and FY 13 (SDR 11.1 million) and indicative for

country’s performance rating, GNI per capita, and population; (iii) the terms of IDA assistance (grants/credits) and the 
allocation deductions associated with MDRI annual debt service foregone; (iv) the performance, other allocation
