Executive Summary

Costa Rica’s Development 
Model: Enduring 
Democracy, the Social 
Compact, Open Economy, 
and the Green Trademark

Sometimes referred to as the “Switzerland 
of Latin America,” Costa Rica stands out for 
being among the most politically stable, pro­
gressive, prosperous, and environmentally con­
scious nations in the region. This model has 
brought important economic, social, and envi­
ronmental dividends, with sustained growth, 
upward mobility for a large share of the popu­
lation, important gains in social indicators, and 
significant achievements in reforestation and 
conservation. Perhaps most important, the 
country experienced shared prosperity, with 
strong income growth of the bottom 40 percent 
for many years, and poverty rates in Costa Rica 
are among the lowest in Latin America and the 
Caribbean.
Indeed, Costa Rica has had uninterrupted 
democratic regimes since 1953, making it the 
oldest working democracy in Latin America. 
Following a two­month civil war in 1948, the 
Legislative Assembly was democratically 
elected to draft a new Constitution. The post– 
civil war administration also abolished the 
army, and ever since Costa Rica has instead 
relied on a police force to maintain order. In 
1953, the first presidential elections under the 
new Constitution were held, and since then 
the country has held 15 additional elections 
(the last in 2014), widely considered peaceful 
and transparent. The country was not only an 

island of peace at a time when armed conflict 
was predominant in Central America but it 
also played a key role in the Esquipulas Agree­
ments that set the basis for the pacification of 
Central America.
Likewise, the country’s Social Compact 
traces its roots back to the middle of the 20th 
century. Many of the central tenets of the So­
cial Compact were instituted during the 
1940s–50s, including: (i) enacting the Labor 
Code and establishing a professional civil ser­
vice isolating civil servants from changes in 
the Executive; (ii) guaranteeing basic social 
rights in the Constitution and adopting basic 
welfare legislation; (iii) establishing a universal 
health care system under the Costa Rican So­
cial Security Agency (Caja Costarricense de 
Seguro Social, [CCSS]); and (iv) guaranteeing 
public education for all. This ambitious Social 
Compact has had the backing of high and ris­
ing social spending. Spending on  education, 
health, and social protection started to rise in 
the 1950s, reaching over three percent of GDP 
by 1958, nearly ten percent by the end of the 
1990s, and then doubling during the first de­
cade of the 2000s. At 20.8 percent of GDP in 
2012, Costa Rica’s social spending is one of the 
highest in Latin America and on par with Or­
ganisation for Economic Co­operation and 
Development (OECD) countries.
And the Social Compact has achieved 
many successes, particularly in the delivery 
of universal services. Costa Rica’s trademark 
universal and integrated health care system, 
managed by the CCSS has provided access to 
health care to its entire population, including 
the poor and bottom 40 percent. It is widely 
recognized that this health care system, 

Executive Summary

combined with the expansion of safe water 
and sanitation, are the key reasons behind 
Costa Rica’s impressive health outcomes: 
life expectancy at birth improved from 61.6 
years in 1960 to 72.5 years in 1980 and to 
79.7 years in 2012, similar to the OECD aver­
age of 80.7 years. Almost 100 percent of all 
births are attended by skilled medical person­
nel, and the infant mortality rate has fallen 
from 90 to 10.6 deaths per 1,000 live births. 
The social security and pension system has 
also been quite inclusive, and today most of 
the population is covered by at least one of 
the programs, which have been extended 
throughout the country and include contrib­
utory pensions, social pensions, workers’ 
compensation, and numerous social assis­
tance benefits. Finally, the country has also 
shown a strong commitment to investing in 
education, nearly reaching the spending tar­
gets of eight percent of GDP that were ap­
proved by the Assembly in 2010. The literacy 
rate for adults 15 years old and above is al­
most universal (97 percent), and the share of 
adults 25 years and above who had no formal 
education has declined from 21.2 percent in 
1950 to 3.4 percent today. Younger cohorts 
are also attaining more years of education as 
time goes by ; for example, the cohort 25–29 
years old had only about four years of educa­
tion on average in 1950; in 1980 it had on av­
erage a complete primary education (above 
six years), and in 2010 it had a complete basic 
education (nine years on average).
Costa Rica’s economy has been trans­
formed by its outward­oriented policies. 
Trade openness has been a critical building 
block of this model, dating back to 1963, 
when Costa Rica joined the Central American 
Common Market and to Costa Rica’s mem­
bership in the Caribbean Basin Initiative in 
1983. But perhaps the most significant step 

was joining the Central America Free Trade 
Agreement (CAFTA­ DR), which provided a 
more stable and reliable framework for Costa 
Rica’s trade with the United States as its main 
trading partner, introduced changes to the 
legal framework to promote transparency, en­
sured a secure and predictable environment 
for investors, and led to the breakup of gov­
ernment monopolies in the telecom and in­
surance sectors. Following CAFTA­DR, Costa 
Rica has entered into further trade agree­
ments with Canada, China, The European 
Union, Mexico, Peru, and Singapore, thus 
consolidating its open economy. Another key 
building block of the economic model was the 
passage of the Free Trade Zones (FTZ) law in 
1981, which started a wave of Foreign Direct 
Investment (FDI) into the country: first with 
low­tech sectors (textiles), and gradually at­
tracting companies in high­tech sectors (elec­
tronics, advanced manufacturing, medical 
devices and life sciences, and services for 
export).
This outward­oriented development 
model has been successful in attracting FDI 
and moving Costa Rica up the global value 
chains over the past two decades. The devel­
opment model has transformed the country 
from a rural  agriculture­ based economy in 
the mid­1950s to one with high value­added 
industries that contribute to several global 
value chains. By 2014, FTZs accounted for 53 
percent of exports, and Costa Rica’s economy 
is very intensive in FDI (4.2  percent of GDP). 
In this regard, the decision by Intel to set up a 
semi­conductor assembly and test plant in 
Costa Rica in 1996 was clearly a turning 
point in attracting foreign investors. Indeed, 
after Intel, other well­known multinationals 
such as Abbott Laboratories (now Hospira), 
Baxter Healthcare, and Procter and Gamble 
have invested in the country ; and by the late 

2 

Executive Summary

1990s manufacturing and services had over­
taken agriculture in their contribution to 
GDP. Costa Rica’s exports are well diversified 
with high­tech manufacturing and services 
playing an increasingly important role. Costa 
Rica contributes to at least five major high­
tech global value chains: electronics, medical 
devices, automotive, aeronautic/aerospace, 
and film/broadcasting devices. Electronics, 
medical devices, and other manufactured 
goods now make up about 60 percent of goods 
exports. The increasingly diversified agricul­
tural portfolio (bananas, pineapples, coffee, 
etc.) accounts for most other goods exports, 
while low value­added products such as tex­
tiles are losing their relevance. Services ex­
ports (tourism, business services) also play 
an important role in the economy and have 
also diversified. Business services (mainly 
Informa tion and Communication Technol­
ogy, ICT, related) account for almost half of 
all services exports.
Finally, Costa Rica has also built a 
world­ renowned “Green Trademark” cen­
tered on conservation, reforestation, and 
national parks. It is the only tropical coun­
try in the world that has reversed deforesta­
tion, increasing the area covered by forests 
from 26 percent in 1983 to 52 percent today. 
Reforestation is attributed, in part, to Costa 
Rica’s Payments for Environmental Services 
(PES) program, which provides incentives 
for forest conservation and rehabilitation 
of an average of 310,000 hectares per year of 
privately owned lands over the past decade. 
National parks and protected areas com­
prise 26 percent of land area in Costa Rica, 
and they have become an important desti­
nation for tourists. Costa Rica also stands 
out as the only country in Latin America 
that has adopted the goal of achieving car­
bon neutrality by 2021.

Indeed, the country is one of the most 
visited nations in Latin America. In 2013, 
close to 2.5 million tourists visited the coun­
try. This implies that the number of visitors 
per capita (at around 0.5) is above popular 
destinations in the Caribbean basin such as 
Mexico (0.2), or the Dominican Republic 
(0.38). While  sun­and­beach tourism clearly 
is part of Costa Rica’s attractions, eco­tour­
ism (an area where it has been a pioneer) is 
also very popular with many travelers visit­
ing the national parks and protected areas. 
Moreover, the country typically ranks at the 
top of the Latin American Region Travel and 
Tourism Competitive Index compiled annu­
ally by the World Economic Forum to mea­
sure the factors that make a destination 
attractive for the travel and tourism industry.
These hallmarks of Costa Rica’s develop­
ment model have produced clear economic 
and social dividends—and poverty rates 
are among the lowest in Latin America and 
the Caribbean. GDP per capita has tripled 
since 1960 and now stands at US$13,876 
(current PPP). Growth has averaged 4.5 
percent between 2000 and 2013, above the 
Latin American average of 3.8 percent. 
Using a US$4 poverty line, only 12 percent 
of the country’s population is considered to 
be poor (less than half the Latin American 
average). Taking a US$2.5 poverty line, 
only 4.7 percent of the population is poor 
(or about one­third of the Latin American 
average). Moreover, only 1.4 percent of the 
population lives under the US$1.25 poverty 
line, well below the World Bank Group’s 
Twin Goals poverty objective for 2030. Not 
surprisingly, the middle class has become 
the largest socioeconomic group of the coun­
try, comprising about 47 percent of the 
population.

However, despite these impressive achieve­
ments, there are a number of emerging chal­
lenges that will need to be addressed to 
main tain the country’s successful develop­
ment path.
First, despite reasonable growth and a 
strong commitment to the Social Compact, 
poverty reduction has stagnated and in­
equality is rising. The long­term trend sug­
gests rising or stagnating inequality across 
most of the past 25 years, in stark contrast 
to the significant decline in inequality in 
the broader LAC region. More recently, the 
gap between the rich and poor has wid­
ened significantly since the global crisis. 
Although growth recovered promptly after 
the global crisis, above the regional aver­
age, job creation for low­skilled workers 
has been feeble, contributing to rising un­
employment and pushing returns to higher 
education upwards. Growth has been un­
even, with lower growth and job creation 
in sectors that are more likely to employ 
unskilled workers (e.g., construction and 
agriculture). Not surprisingly, inequality 
has increased, with the widening gap be­
tween the earnings of rich and poor work­
ers mirroring large disparities in human 
capital and educational attainment. More­
over, despite high spending on social pro­
tection benefits and the broader Social 
Compact, taxes and transfers have not 
proven to be effective in redistributing in­
come to compensate for these disparities. 
Consequently, rising inequality offset the 
poverty­reducing impact of growth in the 
late 2000s, and reversed what should have 
been a decline in poverty between 2010 
and 2014, with poverty increasing by 0.4 
 percentage points instead of falling by a 
projected three percentage points during 
the post­crisis “recover y” period.

Second, Costa Rica has not converged to 
countries of higher income, such as the US. 
Unlike the top regional performers (Chile, 
Panama, and Uruguay) Costa Rica’s per ca­
pita GDP has not shown any signs of conver­
gence towards the US level in the last 25 
years. For example, in 1990, Costa Rica’s per 
capita income was 13 percent of the US level, 
approximately as it is today. At the same 
time, the per capita GDPs of Chile, Panama, 
and Uruguay have increased from 13, 12 and 
9 percent of the US per capita GDP in 1990 
to 21, 17 and 17 percent today, respectively. 
Production costs that weaken the country’s 
competitiveness prevent Costa Rica from 
joining the top growth performers. These 
production costs are affected by relatively 
high wages that limit the country’s competi­
tiveness in low value­ added sectors, as well 
as by a number of investment­ climate related 
factors such as rising electricity costs, weak 
infrastructure, and burdensome regulations.
And third, fiscal pressures threaten to 
undermine the sustainability of the coun­
try’s Social Compact and Green Trademark, 
and prevent it from undertaking much 
needed investments in public infrastruc­
ture. Without fiscal consolidation, the defi­
cit could push public debt to unsustainable 
levels and threaten the country’s economic, 
social, and environmental gains. The fiscal 
situation has deteriorated substantially 
since the global crisis, with the overall defi­
cit of the Central Government growing to 
5.6 percent of GDP in 2013, and is projec­
ted to have surpassed six percent in 2014 
and to reach 6.6 in 2015. In tandem, public 
debt increased from 25 percent of GDP in 
2008 to 37 percent in 2013, with projections 
of 63 percent by 2019 unless corrective 
measures are implemented. This recent de­
terioration stems from counter­cyclical 

4 

Executive Summary

measures under­taken during the crisis and 
structural forces that will require actions on 
multiple fronts.
Moreover, the current political landscape 
and institutional framework add an addi­
tional layer of complexity for approving and 
implementing key reforms needed to address 
these emerging challenges. The shift from a 
two­party to a multi­party system in the last 
fifteen years has resulted in more complex 
and lengthy reform processes. The delays and 
difficulties in passing comprehensive and 
meaningful reforms, particularly on sensitive 
issues such as tax reform, has resulted in a 
mismatch between the demands of the popu­
lation and the “political delivery”. This is an 
increasing concern given the growing need 
to react and adapt quickly to changing global 
developments. Likewise, capacity constraints, 
related to weak sectoral planning and bureau­
cratic inefficiencies, also affect the ability of 
the public sector to implement policies and 
execute public investment projects.

Inclusion: Inequality, 
Jobs, and Skills

Despite its progressive social 
 policies and in contrast to the trends in the 
Latin American region, inequality is rising 
in Costa Rica. Long­term trends over differ­
ent periods indicate that inequality has ei­
ther increased or remained flat since the late 
1980s. Changes in household survey meth­
odologies create problems of comparability 
over time.1 During the period from 1989 to 
2000, the Gini measure of inequality aver­
aged 0.45, rising from 0.44 in 1989 to 0.48 
by 2000. During the period from 2001 to 
2009, the Gini fell and then rose again, aver­
aging 0.50 across the period. Inequality has 

risen in recent years, averaging 0.52 during 
the period from 2010 to 2014, which corre­
sponds both to a revised household survey 
and the post­crisis recovery. In contrast, the 
rest of Latin America witnessed a marked 
decline in inequality, with the regional aver­
age falling by five points, from 0.57 in 2000 
to 0.52 in 2012. As a result, Costa Rica has 
gone from being the least unequal country 
in LAC after Uruguay in 2000, to being 
around the median country out of 17 coun­
tries for which internationally comparable 
data exist for 2012.
Moreover, the incomes of the bottom 
40  percent have fallen behind in recent years. 
The recent changes in the income distribution 
are also apparent when looking at the evolu­
tion of the incomes of the bottom 40 percent 
of the population, which grew about two per­
centage points less than the mean income 
growth between 2010 and 2012. The stub­
bornly high inequality level not only offset the 
poverty­ reducing impacts of growth in the late 
2000s, but also reversed what should have been 
a decline in poverty of about three percentage 
points between 2010 and 2014, into a poverty 
increase of 0.4 percentage points.
The widening income gap between the 
top and bottom quintiles of the population 
reflects the mismatch between the pattern of 
growth and employment versus the skills 
profile of the workforce. As discussed above, 
Costa Rica’s outward­oriented economic 
model has favored the development of high 
value­added sectors, such as electronics, 
medical devices, IT business services, and so 
forth. In contrast, lower value­added sectors, 
such as construction, domestic services, and 
agriculture, have grown more slowly—or 
even contracted. Costa Rica’s push toward 
high­end sectors has been quite successful. It 
has also created excess demand for skilled 

Executive Summary 

5

workers, increasing their market value. And 
yet, Costa Rica has not sufficiently increased 
its stock of high­skilled workers. Surpris­
ingly, despite the long­standing commitment 
to invest in public education, less than half 
of the cohort 25–29 years old had achieved a 
secondary or higher education by 2010, fur­
ther adding to the stock of low­skilled adult 
workers, a legacy of the 1980s crisis. Costa 
Rica’s educational attainment is lower than 
in peer countries in LAC (such as Chile and 
Panama), and significantly lower than peer 
countries in Europe (such as Croatia and 
Lithuania), and far lower than graduation 
rates in the OECD. Moreover, indicators of 
the quality of education, such as OECD’s 
PISA or UNESCO’s TERCE tests, place Costa 
Rican students behind most countries with 
spending at comparable levels. Even more 
worrisome, scores on  international tests have 
worsened in recent years. Thus, the shift 
from low to high value­ added sectors with­
out a corresponding increase in the stock of 
skilled workers has produced the same result 
on the distribution of income as Skill­Biased 
Technological Change—where low­skilled 
labor is gradually replaced by capital. And 
yet, with low graduation rates, the stock of 
unskilled workers  continues to grow.
The labor­market effects of this structural 
mismatch of skills and jobs have become 
even more pronounced since the global cri­
sis. Job creation in sectors that employ mostly 
low­skilled labor has been low or negative 
since 2007. Unemployment started to rise 
during the global crisis and has continued in­
creasing thereafter, reaching nine percent in 
2014. The poor, women, and youth have been 
disproportionately affected in their inability 
to find jobs, as the sectors where job creation 
has been minimal or even negative in the last 

six years are those mainly employing low­
skilled workers. Thus, it is no surprise that 
unemployment increased the most for this 
segment of workers. At the other end of the 
spectrum, sectors that employ mostly high­
skilled workers, such as financial services, 
real estate, personal services, and others, are 
growing fast, pushing returns to higher levels 
of education upward.
As such, the earnings gaps between rich 
and poor and between the skilled and un­
skilled have widened since the “inflection 
point” of the global crisis. Specifically, be­
tween 2007 and 2013, the earnings of those 
in the top quintile increased relative to the 
median earner (from 2 to 2.19), whereas 
the earnings of workers in the bottom quin­
tile fell in relation to the median (from 0.52 
to 0.29). A similar picture is seen in dispar­
ities by skill levels: for workers with tertiary 
education, the ratio to the median income 
increased (from 1.89 to 2.01), whereas the 
ratio for workers with secondary complete 
or incomplete remained flat, and for work­
ers with primary education or less the ratio 
fell (from 0.79 to 0.73 of the median income). 
Indeed, the returns to education have in­
creased alongside the rise in inequality in 
Costa Rica, in contrast to trends in most 
other LAC countries.
Furthermore, despite Costa Rica’s ambi­
tious Social Compact, taxes and transfers 
have not proven to be effective in redistribut­
ing income to compensate for these dispari­
ties. This is explained by two main factors. 
First, although revenue collection in Costa 
Rica is on par with upper­ middle­ and high­ 
income countries (at around 22  percent of 
GDP for general taxes plus social security 
contributions and other revenues), general 
tax revenues are low (13.5  percent of GDP), 

6 

Executive Summary

and the taxation structure is not very progre­
ssive. Since 1953, the Assembly has approved 
1,259 tax exemptions (nearly half of them 
with unclear definitions of the taxes ex­
empted), amounting to 5.6 percent of GDP. 
Hence, the country has a limited ability to 
counterbalance income inequality through 
tax policies. Second, social assistance pro­
grams in Costa Rica are fragmented, with 
fairly low coverage among the poor and weak 
targeting accuracy. Even the most widespread 
program (school meals) reaches only half of 
the population in the lowest income quintile. 
A large share of the non­poor benefit from 
social programs, and the targeting accuracy 
of programs is low compared to other coun­
tries. For example, only 44 percent of Costa 
Rica’s conditional cash transfer program 
(CCT) “Avancemos” go to those in the poor­
est quintile as compared with 74  percent of 
CCT benefits under Panama’s “Red de Opor­
tunidades” Program.

Growth and 
Competitiveness

Costa Rica’s average growth perfor-
mance has been positive over the past de­
cades. As discussed above, GDP per capita 
has tripled since 1960 against a 260 percent 
increase in the region. Growth has averaged 
4.5 percent between 2000 and 2013, above 
the Latin American average of 3.8 percent. 
Looking at the post global­ crisis period, the 
country’s economy recovered similarly to a 
set of comparator countries (Chile, Croatia, 
Dominican Republic, Lithuania, Panama, 
and Uruguay). Yet, as discussed above, since 
1990 the country has not shown any sign 
of convergence towards the US per capita 

income levels in contrast to the top perfor­
mers in the Latin American region.
Importantly, the country faces several 
challenges to its competitiveness, and the 
economy is showing signs of built­up vul­
nerabilities. These constraints reflect two 
forces: the mismatch of skills and jobs, and 
 investment­climate related factors.
First, relatively high wages have made 
Costa Rica less viable in low value­added sec­
tors, while insufficient supply of skills ham­
pers competitiveness in high value­ added 
sectors. On the one hand, high income levels, 
coupled with generous social benefits, have 
resulted in high reservation wages across the 
board. Relatively high wages have made the 
country less competitive in low value­added 
sectors. On the other hand, the push toward 
high value­ added sectors such as electronics, 
medical devices, and IT services has been 
quite successful; but insufficient supply of 
high­skilled workers has created excess de­
mand for high skills. This, in turn, has put 
upward pressure on the salaries of high­
skilled workers.
And second, numerous investment­cli­
mate­related factors hinder Costa Rica’s com­
petitiveness. Rising electricity costs, high 
logistics costs, and burdensome regulations, 
plus the appreciation of the real exchange 
rate over the past eight years, are eroding the 
country’s external competitiveness. Com­
bined with high wage costs, these costs have 
made the country less competitive in low val­
ue­added sectors. For example, textile ex­
ports have dropped dramatically over the last 
decade, falling from 13.3 percent of exports 
in 2000 to 1.6 percent in 2014, and this trend 
has been mainly attributed to high produc­
tion costs in Costa Rica compared to neigh­
boring countries. Although Costa Rica has 

Executive Summary 

7

excelled in its push towards high value­ad­
ded sectors, weak infrastructure outside the 
Free Trade Zones and low backward links 
between export­oriented multi­national cor­
porations and local firms have limited poten­
tial spillover effects to the broader economy. 
The quality of transport services and road 
and port infrastructure in particular is rela­
tively weak. The appreciating real exchange 
rate has also had negative  consequences for 
exports and the tourism sector, as well as for 
FDI coming into or exiting the country. For 
example, in 2014, Intel’s announcement to 
relocate its microchip manufacturing plant to 
Vietnam, and Bank of America’s subsequent 
announcement of the closing of its service 
center, have sparked renewed dialogue about 
the importance of diversifying exports and 
improving competitiveness. Although Intel 
has maintained its engineering and design 
services in Costa Rica, exports of electronics 
contracted by almost 20 percent in 2014. 
Still, export diversification has helped, and 
strong growth in medical device production 
has helped offset this contraction in 
electronics.

Sustainability: 
Fiscal, Social, and 
Environmental 
Pressures

Sustainability is threatened by the dete­
riorating fiscal situation. As in many other 
countries, Costa Rica faced the global crisis by 
implementing countercyclical fiscal policies. 
This was welcomed given the magnitude of 
the crisis and the fiscal space the country had 
at the time (public debt was below 25 percent 
of GDP in 2008). However, these policies 

created structural pressures on the country’s 
fiscal accounts: unlike other countries which 
implemented temporary fiscal policies, Costa 
Rica chose to implement steep, permanent in­
creases in public salaries in 2008–2010. As a 
result, the wage bill of the central government 
increased from 5.5 percent of GDP in 2008 to 
7.4 percent in 2014. At the same time, how­
ever, government revenues, which had risen 
steeply prior to the crisis, dropped back to the 
average level for 2000–05. Thus, the over all 
deficit of the central government grew, reach­
ing 5.6 percent of GDP in 2013, and it is pro­
jected to surpass six percent of GDP in 2014, 
and reach 6.6 percent of GDP in 2015. As a 
result, public debt increased by 12 percentage 
points in five years, reaching 37 percent of 
GDP in 2013, and is projected to surpass the 
somewhat worrisome level of 63 percent of 
GDP by 2019, unless corrective measures to 
control expenditures and/or increase revenues 
are implemented. However, such measures are 
constrained by a number of rigid ities in the 
system, including numerous expenditure 
mandates, earmarked revenues, and tax ex­
emptions. These rigidities leave only five per­
cent of the annual budget for strategic 
allocative decisions in any given year. Further­
more, the budget process is fragmented, with 
only the central government budget requiring 
approval by the Legislative Assembly. Without 
fiscal consolidation, the deficit could push 
public debt to unsustainable levels and 
threaten the country’s Social Compact and 
Green Trademark.
Indeed, there are tensions between the high 
level of social spending and Costa Rica’s ability 
to deliver on its ambitious Social Compact. In 
health, despite the country’s long­standing 
commitment to universal coverage, important 
“cracks in the system” reduce the efficiency of 
this cornerstone of the Social Compact. The 

8 

Executive Summary

current organization of the system has led to 
increasing wait times and patient frustration. 
Out­of­pocket spend ing has increased along­
side rising public spending on health, and 
budget allocations do not take into account 
demographic and demand changes, leading to 
inefficiencies and inequities of health care. 
Furthermore, an out dated infrastructure and 
information management system lowers qual­
ity and decreases transparency and efficiency 
of resource management. In education, out­
comes have been particularly disappointing, 
despite high public spending. Drop out rates 
are high, test scores are low, and the system is 
not producing the skills needed to meet the 
demands implied by Costa Rica’s pattern of 
growth. Finally, despite high coverage of the 
social protection system, different pension re­
gimes exacerbate inequities and social assis­
tance programs are fragmented and weakly 
targeted, with limited impacts on poverty and 
inequality. In the face of rising inequality com­
bined with the deterioration of the fiscal situa­
tion, these inefficiencies erode support for the 
Social Compact. There are growing signs that 
the middle and upper classes are slowly start­
ing to “opt out” of public services and pay for 
private ones (as is widespread in other Latin 
American countries). To the extent that this 
process continues, it will seriously undermine 
the commitment of these groups to finance 
universal services that they no longer use, fur­
ther eroding the quality and legitimacy of the 
system.
Similarly, Costa Rica’s global leadership in 
environmental conservation faces the chal­
lenge of growing pressures on the use of re­
sources and of urbanization. First, the 
Pay ment for Environmental Service (PES) 
model competes with rising land use opportu­
nity costs, which makes it fiscally unsustain­
able in the long run. Furthermore, the 

commitment to carbon neutrality entails not 
only maintaining the current levels of forest 
cover but also reducing the current levels of 
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from all 
sectors. While a large share of GHG emissions 
can be achieved from better management of 
forested and agricultural land, the country 
also needs to reduce carbon emissions from 
fossil fuels coming from transport, from con­
struction, and increasingly from general elec­
tricity consumption. This creates significant 
trade­offs: the PES model is itself dependent 
on revenues generated from taxes on gasoline; 
and increasing the production of clean energy 
necessitates in some cases intervening in pro­
tected areas. Second, urbanization has in­
creased air and water pollution, and there is 
no long­term plan to protect the environment 
from these threats. The country needs to im­
prove its infrastructure quality, from public 
transportation to waste treatment capabilities. 
Finally, the intensive use of agricultural land 
has generated a worrisome level of agro­ 
chemical use, and more generally the lack of a 
proactive approach to territorial planning 
jeop ardizes the gains in environmental con­
servation. Put differently, the status quo is at 
odds with the long­term goals of the country 
in terms of environmental sustainability.

Governance

On top of the challenges affecting the 
three basic pillars of development (inclusion, 
growth, and sustainability), there is an addi­
tional one that cuts across the pillars: a public 
sector administration that has not moder­
nized in tandem with the economy, therefore 
limiting the State’s ability to deliver. Despite 
Costa Rica’s good standing on governance 
relative to the LAC region, both perceptions 
and evidence suggest that its institutions and 

Executive Summary 

9

procedures have not been able to adapt to the 
challenges of a new economic and social en­
vironment. Governance challenges hamper 
Costa Rica’s effectiveness in several ways. 
First, in a governance structure where power 
is spread across many actors, political grid­
lock has hampered the adoption of reforms 
in many instances over the past decade(s). As 
a result, a consequence of this gridlock in 
passing reforms has been the proliferation of 
an increasing number of public (and often 
autonomous) institutions created to address 
specific problems. Second, the budget process 
and numerous earmarked expenditures re­
duce the margin for the executive to control 
public investment and current expenses – or 
to make strategic allocative decisions. Third, 
public investment –  particularly in infra­
structure – has been at a standstill for de­
cades. Various factors are named as obstacles 
to the implementation of public infrastruc­
ture and social projects in the various line 
ministries, such as the cumbersome pro­
cesses associated with the Public Procure­
ment Law, deficiencies in the environmental 
regulatory framework, cumbersome checks 
and reviews throughout the process, and so 
forth. Fourth, perception and evidence sug­
gest inefficiencies in public service delivery 
(as discussed below for basic social services). 
And finally, the institutional complexity of 
the public sector makes for convoluted pro­
cedures that increase transactions costs of in­
teracting with public institutions and service 
agencies. The relatively poor ranking of 
Costa Rica in the Doing Business Indicators 
(ranking 83rd out of 189 countries in 2015) is 
partly attributed to burdensome procedures 
within and between public institutions. Costa 
Rica also ranks poorly on indices of Protect­
ing Investors (181st), Enforcing Contracts 
(129th), Paying Taxes (121st) and Starting a 

Business (118th). It’s startling that a country 
that depends so heavily on FDI fares so 
poorly in those categories.

Priority Areas, 
Links, and  
Complementarities

Several threads weave across this “tril­
ogy” of challenges for inclusion, growth, and 
 sustainability—and point to priority areas for 
action. One thread involves the interactions 
between inequality and growth, which hinge 
on the mismatch of skills and jobs. Another 
strand is the dual challenge of maintaining 
competitiveness of high value­added sectors, 
while enhancing the viability of traditional 
low value­added sectors. Mounting fiscal 
pres sures threaten the sustainability of the So­
cial Compact and Green Trademark. Finally, 
the challenges of governance also weave 
across the development agenda, limiting the 
capacity of the public sector to adopt reforms, 
deliver services, and execute infrastructure 
projects. These inter­connected challenges 
highlight a number of priority areas that 
Costa Rica needs to address to continue on a 
sustainable and inclusive growth path.

Education and skills. Costa Rica needs 
to build a skilled workforce to supports its 
trajectory towards a high value­added 
economy and to reduce the skills­income 
gap. With fewer than half of young adults 
graduating from secondary school, and 
with performance on test scores falling, 
Costa Rica’s labor supply does not appear 
to be well adapted to generate the skills 
needed for the labor market. Thus, building 
a more skilled workforce will ensure that 
the country remains competitive in high 

10 

Executive Summary

value­added sectors, and that more workers 
can access these better paying jobs, includ­
ing those in the bottom 40 percent of the 
population. As these changes are structural, 
for the most part they are also long term in 
nature. Workers cannot just “acquire an ed­
ucation overnight.” As such, tackling these 
challenges will require a three­pronged ap­
proach: (i) strengthening the quality, reten­
tion, and relevance of the education system 
(from pre­school through secondary 
school)—which will help build the skills of 
“tomorrow’s workers”; (ii) improving the 
quality and relevance of tertiary education; 
and (iii) strengthening the technical train­
ing system for the workforce.
Bold actions are needed to overhaul Costa 
Rica’s education system. Given the country’s 
level of development and high education 
spending, the education system seriously un­
derperforms in quality (as demonstrated by 
test results), retention (low completion rates), 
and relevance (as indicated by low returns to 
training and lower levels of education). Al­
though high rates of secondary school drop­
out are a symptom of the broader challenges 
in the system, imbalances in the allocation of 
public spending favor primary (41 percent) 
and tertiary education (32 percent) with rela­
tively little allocated to the secondary level 
(27  percent). Indeed, both the share of public 
spending and the allocation per student in 
secondary education are low by international 
standards and given Costa Rica’s level of de­
velopment. Moreover, inequities in learning 
outcomes start early in life—and affect moti­
vation and abilities to learn throughout the 
school years. In addition to rebalancing 
spending towards secondary school and early 
childhood development, Costa Rica needs to 
strengthen teacher quality and improve ac­
countability through regular monitoring with 

standardized learning assessments, and a 
more effective governance and incentive 
framework.
Given the high­skilled profile of job op­
portunities in Costa Rica, systemic efforts 
are also needed to enhance the quality and 
relevance of tertiary education. Currently, 
the tertiary education system is heavily bi­
ased towards social science and humanities, 
and produces few STEM (Science, Technol­
ogy, Engineering and Mathematics) gradu­
ates, further contributing to the skills 
shortage in high value­added sectors. More­
over, outdated and bureaucratic procedures 
for recognizing foreign degrees create obsta­
cles for Costa Rica to “import” the skills 
needed to sustain its high value­ added 
growth model. Quality and accountability 
mechanisms are also needed, with perfor­
mance agreements with public universities 
and quality accreditation standards for both 
university and non­university tertiary 
education
Finally, the country needs to expand the 
offering and relevance of technical training, 
which is the most direct way to build the 
skills of the current workforce. Again, stron­
ger quality standards, certification of techni­
cal programs, and accountability of training 
institutes could help. The National Learning 
Institute (INA) could also improve coordina­
tion with private­sector employers to design 
market­relevant curricula and course offer­
ings so as to better respond to the needs of 
the growing sectors of the economy.

Competitiveness and the business 
 climate. Boosting growth and inclusion in 
the labor market requires confronting the 
dual challenge of maintaining competitive­
ness of high value­added sectors, while im­
proving the viability of low value­added 

Executive Summary 

11

sectors. For instance, improving the integra­
tion of export­ oriented and domestic firms 
through backward linkages could sustain the 
growth among small and medium enter­
prises (SMEs), generating jobs in mid­ and 
low­skilled occupations. This can be done 
by lowering operation costs to improve the 
productivity of labor and counterbalance the 
high labor costs in Costa Rica compared to 
its neighbors, for example by lowering the 
costs of doing business through regulatory 
simplification.

Infrastructure. Reducing the infrastruc­
ture deficit would increase competitiveness, 
growth, and environmental sustainability. 
Costa Rica’s historical efforts to build an 
extensive network of infrastructure in 
nearly all productive service areas (water, 
sanitation, transport, electricity, and tele­
communications) are clear from the infra­
structure stock: the country has two times 
the road and three times the rail density of 
the average middle­income country ; access 
to electricity is nearly universal; and mo­
bile penetration is higher than the OECD 
average. Yet, the near freeze in public infra­
structure investment until the 1990s, as 
well as recent fiscal constraints, have taken 
a toll on the country’s ability to upgrade 
and maintain its infrastructure. Further, 
the government has faced significant chal­
lenges in executing infrastructure invest­
ment in a timely manner. As a result, today 
roads and ports have among the lowest 
quality marks in the LAC region. Electric­
ity prices have doubled since 2007 due to 
weather related variable hydroelectric out­
put, causing increased use of thermal units 
and high operating costs, among other fac­
tors. This infra structure deficit reduces the 
potential of local firms to grow and create 

jobs, and this is true in particular for firms 
that operate outside Free Trade Zones 
(FTZs). In addition, the country needs to 
improve its waste management and clean 
energy production capabilities to be able to 
reduce GHG emissions, and water and soil 
pollution. Infrastructure improvement 
poses a number of tradeoffs, including the 
need to intervene in protected areas (in the 
case of clean energy production), as well as 
the need to control the current fiscal defi­
cit. Given the necessity of continuing to in­
vest in infrastructure, and the reality of 
fiscal constraints, Costa Rica must look for 
options for private sector participation in 
the maintenance and upgrading of its 
infrastructure.
Both growth and inclusion would benefit 
from the many complementarities involved 
in improving education, competitiveness, 
and infrastructure. A well­educated work­
force with relevant skills is fundamental for 
sustaining economic growth and increasing 
productivity. In parallel, closing the educa­
tion gap between the poor and non­poor is 
also highly relevant for inclusion by provid­
ing opportunities those in the bottom 40 
percent. Lowering the costs of doing business 
will boost competitiveness across various 
sectors. Furthermore, increasing infrastruc­
ture spending would stimulate construction, 
thereby creating more jobs for the large stock 
of low­skilled workers.
At the same time, actions are needed to 
ensure the sustainability of Costa Rica’s de­
velopment model:

•	 Fiscal sustainability : Improving the 
fiscal stance to restore sustainability re­
quires  reforms to manage expenditures 
and increase revenues. On the expen­
diture front, these include containing

the wage bill of the consolidated public 
sector, as public sector wages, both in 
government and more so in state­owned 
enterprises and other public institutions, 
are well above the private sector at all 
employment categories; and reviewing 
the fiscal sustainability of the pension 
system, particularly of special pension 
regimes in the public sector. In addition, 
a comprehensive reform of the budge­
tary process is needed to  increase effi­
ciency and transparency in all public 
sector entities. Finally, curtailing the 
earmarking of revenues, which cover 
more than half of primary spending, 
would make the budgetary process more 
flexible. Comprehensive reforms are also 
needed to increase revenues. For exam­
ple, the 1,259 tax exemptions approved 
since 1953 that comprise almost six 
percent of GDP need to be thoroughly 
reviewed. Curtailing those exemptions 
would make the tax system more ratio­
nal and progressive, as well as produce 
higher revenues. This reform is essential 
for restoring sustainability to the fiscal 
accounts, which is a necessary condition 
for achieving Costa Rica’s economic and 
social objectives.
Social sustainability: In addition to 
strengthening education, priority areas 
for sustaining the Social Compact include 
health and social protection. Costa Rica 
needs to modernize its universal health 
system to improve quality by: (i) strength­
ening the health care model to enhance 
capacity to adapt to demographic and 
epidemiological change while ensuring 
quality and timeliness of service  delivery; 
(ii) improving the financial model of 
budget and resource allocation; and (iii) 
improving the management model for 

•	

the health system for accountability, ef­
ficiency, and performance. The  country 
also needs to increase the effectiveness 
of social protection programs by (i) har­
monizing eligibility criteria and social 
information systems; (ii) improving per­
formance monitoring and evaluation; and 
(iii) reducing institutional and program 
fragmentation.
•	 Environmental sustainability : To sus­
tain its celebrated “Green Trademark,” 
Costa Rica needs to balance environmen­
tal and natural resource management 
goals, by : (i) reviewing the sustainability 
of the PES mechanism for conservation; 
(ii) modernizing water and solid waste 
treatment (infrastructure,  service deliv­
ery, regulatory framework, capacity); 
(iii) increasing the supply of renewable 
energy by making regulations on the use 
of protected areas more flexible; (iv) im­
plementing a comprehensive transport 
policy, including measures to reduce 
growth of demand for energy associated 
with transport; (v) reinforcing regulation 
and oversight of agro­chemical use and 
incentivizing the expansion of “green” 
(organic) agriculture; and (vi) improving 
territorial planning, land management, 
and management of natural and man­
made disasters.

Governance. Progress in all the priority 
areas discussed above hinges on improving 
the capacity of the public sector to plan and 
implement policies, execute public invest­
ment projects, deliver services, and increase 
accountability. Despite Costa Rica’s good 
governance levels compared to the rest of the 
LAC region, there is a growing perception of 
low effectiveness of government institutions. 
Cumbersome regulations, in many cases 

Executive Summary 

13

resulting from lack of coordination among 
institutions, make the process of starting and 
running a business— particularly a non­FTZ 
small or medium enterprise—more chal­
lenging. Low levels of transparency and ac­
countability lower the efficiency of public 
spending. The current political landscape, 
where political minorities have the power to 
delay votes, further reduces the margin for 
approving and implementing needed re­
forms. The need to improve governance is 
apparent in all priority areas, for instance by 
increasing accountability in the education 
sector (e.g., by tracking student achievement 
to reward teacher and school performance). 
Employment creation would benefit from 
streamlining business regulations as well as 
the public procurement and investment pro­
cesses to improve infrastructure. A more 
consolidated budget, fewer tax exemptions, 
and more control over spending by autono­
mous institutions could greatly help to re­
duce the current fiscal deficit, and would 
improve the capacity to monitor results of 
public spending. In turn, results­based man­
agement would help to boost the efficiency 
of public spending, for example, enforcing 
the use of common information systems and 
modernizing the M&E frameworks in the 
social sectors.

An agenda for knowledge. Finally, a 
number of knowledge gaps need to be 

Note

filled to inform better policy decisions. Al­
though there is a large and productive re­
search and policy analysis community 
studying Costa Rica, there are a few issues 
where having further research and data 
collection would provide more information 
to help design more concrete policy re­
forms to tack le the issues presented above. 
For example, the specific factors driving 
secondar y dropout are still not well under­
stood. In the labor market, it is not clear 
whether the contraction of employment in 
agriculture, manufacturing and construc­
tion is of a cyclical or structural nature, 
and this has important implications for 
low­skilled unemployment. Likewise, al­
though there are strong signs that reserva­
tion wages are high, there could be more 
studies to quantify this  phenomenon bet­
ter. To improve the efficiency of the public 
sector, it is crucial to identify the specific 
governance bottlenecks in executing infra­
structure projects, as well as their cost im­
plications. Also, the articulation 
mech anisms to improve the effectiveness 
of social programs need to be based on a 
thorough institutional mapping of social 
programs. Finally, environmental conser­
vation needs to be better linked with eco­
nomic activity, and a key knowledge gap in 
this regard is how to link sustainable pro­
duction and rural landscapes 
to conservation.

 1. The long­term trends in poverty and inequal­
ity are subject to caveats regarding income 
measurement due to several changes in sur­
vey methodology across that time period. 
The main “breaks” in comparability of the 

data series occur in 2001 and 2010. As such, 
measurement of welfare across the three time 
periods of 1989–2000, 2001–09, and 2010–14 
is not strictly comparable. See chapter 2 and 
box 2.1.

Executive Summary

1. Introduction and Country Context

Costa Rica is a small country, with am-
bitious economic, social, and environmental 
goals. The country covers a land area of 
19,700 square miles (51,100 square kilome-
ters), with a population of 4.9 million, of 
which about three-quarters live in urban 
areas. An upper- middle income-country, 
with GDP per capita of US$13,876 (current 
PPP), it is under consideration for member-
ship to the Organisation for Economic Co-
operation and Development (OECD), with 
discussions scheduled for this year. Costa 
Rica’s development model centers on four 
key pillars: its long-standing democracy, an 
ambitious Social Compact, an outward-ori-
ented economy, and its celebrated Green 
Trademark. This model has achieved many 
successes, including sustained healthy 
growth rates, improvements in social indi-
cators, environmental gains, and one of the 
lowest poverty rates in the Latin America 
and Caribbean region.
Anchored in a region rife with political 
and social turmoil until the late 20th century, 
Costa Rica stands out as the longest working 
democracy in Latin America. The country—
one of the smallest in Latin America and the 
Caribbean (LAC)—started a process of de-
mo cratic nation building back in the 19th 
century, with the development of the coffee 
industry. Stability and consensus were nur-
tured from the country’s early years and con-
tinued during the transition to the modern 
democracy that started in 1949 (box 1.1). 
Since then, elections have been held every 
four years, with peaceful transitions of power 
between political parties, making it the oldest 
working democracy in 

Latin America. There is a clear checks-and-
balances system between the Executive and 
the Legislative Assembly. Costa Rica’s politi-
cal norms have long placed a high premium 
on achievement of wide socio-political con-
sensus on major policies. Participation in 
elections remains high, with 70 percent vot-
ing in 2010 and 68 percent in 2014, although 
it has declined from levels around 80 percent 
during elections in the 1990s.1 This political 
stability, which has earned Costa Rica the 
label of “Switzerland of Latin America,” has 
been attributed to several factors, including 
the abolition of the army after a two-month 
civil war in 1948, the limited presence and 
power of land-based oligarchies, and the 
1949 Constitution, which created one of 
Latin America’s first welfare states.
The country has also forged a far-reaching 
Social Compact, with universal access to basic 
services and a long tradition of social rights. 
Costa Rica’s Social Compact traces its roots 
back to the middle of the 20th century, and is 
founded on constitutional guarantees of basic 
social rights, an extensive Labor Code, public 
education, and a universal health care system 
managed by the Social Security Agency (box 
1.1). As a result, most of the population has 
access to improved water sources (96 per-
cent), sanitation (94 percent), and electricity 
(99 percent).2 It is widely recognized that 
Costa Rica’s universal health care system, 
along with the expansion of safe water and 
sanitation, are the key reasons behind its im-
pressive health outcomes.3 Life expectancy at 
birth increased from 61.6 years in 1960 to 
79.7 years in 2012, just one year less than the 
OECD average of 80.7 years. Almost all births

Box 1.1 Historical Underpinnings of Costa Rica’s Social Compact

Costa Rica’s social contract has its roots in the pattern of its colonial settlement and the 
structure of coffee production. Largely isolated, sparsely populated, and without precious 
metals to export, Costa Rica was a uniformly poor subsistence economy during the colo-
nial period (1600–1800). The farmers of the Central Valley worked their own land on 
homesteads. Given the dominance of the farm household, Costa Rica has been described 
as a “rural democracy” during this period, with minimal social divisions and few class dis-
tinctions, in contrast to neighboring countries.
Following independence in 1821, coffee production grew rapidly and became the en-
gine of Costa Rica’s economic growth. Coffee became a driver for the development of 
the countr y’s infrastructure, institutional organization, and productive structure. 
Roads were built to export coffee to Europe. Coffee production accelerated moving 
from communal land rights to the privatization of land, and the predominance of 
small landholdings and the notion of individual property rights contributed to low in-
equality and shared wealth. Abundant land supply and labor scarcity contributed to 
high wages, contributing to a more equitable distribution of the income from coffee 
exports. As international demand increased, large exporters were forced to buy coffee 
from the smallholders, while in turn smallholders depended on large exporters for the 
beneficio—the huller y where coffee is washed, dried, and packaged for export—thereby 
creating a strong mutual interdependence. By the middle of the 19 th centur y, this facili-
tated the consolidation of the Coffee Pact—the implicit contract developed between 
the large exporters and smaller producers. In part, this pact was feasible because Costa 
Rica had a small territor y with a small population concentrated in the Central Valley, 
where all faced the same adversities and risks. The implicit contract was a social mech-
anism for dealing with these risks and overcoming the shortcomings of small size.
The social relationships implicit in the Coffee Pact gradually led to the emergence of a na-
tional egalitarian ideology that validated the participation of small producers and the 
landless workers not only in the distribution of the economy’s product but also in the po-
litical arena. This led to Costa Rica’s version of the liberal state, in which the interests of 
different sectors could be democratically expressed, rules were universally applicable, and 
institutions and legal codes promoted the growth of economic activity and a democratic 
society. Liberal governments created a legal framework that protected individual and pro-
perty rights, guaranteed market freedom, and placed multiple limits and counterbalances 
on power.
This egalitarian ideology provided the underpinnings for Costa Rica’s notable Welfare 
State. In 1941, President Rafael Angel Calderon Guardia created the social security sys-
tem (Caja Costarricense de Seguro Social, CCSS) to provide public health services, which

have become universal since then. In 1943, a Labor Code was enacted and an article on 
social rights (garantías sociales) was written into the Constitution of 1949. The social 
rights included health, housing, social assistance, public services, taxes, and minimum 
wages, among others.

are attended by skilled medical personnel, 
and the infant mortality rate stands at 10.6 
deaths per 1,000 live births, a vast improve-
ment since 1960 which recorded 90 deaths 
per 1,000. Moreover, by 2011 the literacy rate 
for adults 15 years old and above had reached 
97 percent, and the share of adults 25 years 
and above who had no formal education was 
3.4 percent in 2010. Younger cohorts are at-
taining more years of education as time goes 
by. For example, the cohort of young adults 
aged 25–29 years had only about four years of 
education on average in 1950; in 1980 it had 
on average a complete primary education (six 
years); and by 2010 it had a complete basic 
education (nine years on average). This is in 
part the result of a strong commitment of the 
society to invest in education, as reflected in a 
recently approved constitutional mandate 
(June 2010) to raise education spending from 
six to eight percent of GDP.
Costa Rica’s economy has been trans-
formed by its outward-oriented policies, 
centered on trade openness, export diver-
sification, Free Trade Zones (FTZs), and 
foreign direct investment (FDI). Trade 
open ness has been a critical building block 
of this model, dating back to 1963, when 
Costa Rica joined the Central American 
Common Market (CACM, made up of El 

Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and 
 Nicaragua), which spearheaded trade inte-
gration in Central America, eventually 
leading to a customs union. A second 
milestone took place 20 years later (1983), 
when Costa Rica joined the Caribbean 
Basin Initiative, strengthening its trade re-
lations with the United States. But perhaps 
the most significant step was joining 
CAFTA- DR (the Dominican Republic-
Central America- United States Free Trade 
Agreement), which provided a more stable 
and reliable framework for Costa Rica’s 
trade with its main trading partner, the 
United States, introduced changes to the 
legal framework to promote transparency, 
ensured a secure and predictable environ-
ment for investors, and led to the breakup 
of government monopolies in the telecom 
and insurance sectors. Following CAFTA- 
DR , Costa Rica has entered into further 
trade agreements with Canada, China, the 
European Union, Mexico, Peru, and Singa-
pore, thus consolidating its open economy. 
Another key building block of the econo-
mic model was the passage of the FTZ law 
in 1981 (amended in 1990 and 2010), 
which started a wave of FDI into the coun-
tr y : first with low-tech sectors (textiles), 
and gradually attracting companies in 

Introduction and Country Context 

17

high-tech sectors (electronics, advanced 
manufacturing, medical devices and life 
sciences, and ser vices for export).
This outward-oriented development 
model has been successful in attracting FDI 
and moving Costa Rica up the global value 
chains over the past two decades. The devel-
opment model has transformed the country 
from a rural  agriculture-based economy in 
the mid-1950s to one with high value-added 
industries that contribute to several global 
value chains. By 2014, FTZs accounted for 
53 percent of exports, and Costa Rica’s econ-
omy is very intensive in FDI (4.2 percent of 
GDP). Exports are well diversified with 
high- tech manufacturing and services play-
ing an increasingly important role. Costa 
Rica contributes to at least five major high-
tech global value chains: electronics, medical 
devices,  automotive, aeronautic/aerospace, 
and film/broadcasting devices. Electronics, 
medical devices, and other man ufactured 
goods now make up about 60 percent of 
goods exports. The increasingly diversified 
agricultural port folio (bananas, pineapples, 
coffee, etc.) accounts for most other goods 
exports, while low value-added products 
such as textiles are losing their relevance. 
Services exports (tourism, business services) 
also play an important role in the economy 
and have also diver sified. Business services 
(mainly Information and Communication 
Technology, ICT, related) account for almost 
half of all services exports.
Finally, Costa Rica has built a world- 
renowned “Green Trademark,” centered on 
conservation, reforestation, and protected 
areas. It is the only tropical country in the 
world that has reversed deforestation, in-
creasing the area covered by forests from 26 
percent in 1983 to 52 percent today (box 
1.2). Reforestation is attributed, in part, to 

the Payments for Environmental Services 
(PES) program, which provides incentives 
to forest conservation and rehabilitation, 
reaching an average of 310,000 hectares per 
year of privately owned lands over the past 
decade. Costa Rica has also set aside 26 
percent of its land area for protected areas, 
including national parks, which have be-
come an important destination for tourists 
(53  percent of tourists visited those parks 
in 2012).4 Tourism has become a dynamic 
sector, contributing 4.6 percent of GDP and 
14.2 percent of total exports in 2013. Costa 
Rica also stands out as the first country to 
adopt the goal of achieving carbon neutral-
ity by 2021 (box 1.2).
This development model has produced 
clear economic and social dividends—and 
poverty rates are among the lowest in Latin 
America and the Caribbean. GDP per capita 
has tripled since 1960 and now stands at 
US$13,876 (current PPP). Growth has aver-
aged 4.5 percent between 2000 and 2013, 
above the Latin American average of 3.8 per-
cent. Using a US$4 (2005 PPP) poverty line, 
only 12 percent of the country’s population 
is considered to be poor (less than half of the 
Latin American average). Taking a US$2.5 
poverty line, only 4.7  percent of the popula-
tion is poor (or about one-third of the Latin 
American average). Moreover, only 1.4 per-
cent of the population lives under the 
US$1.25 poverty line, well below the World 
Bank Group’s Twin Goals poverty objective 
for 2030.5 Not surprisingly, the middle class 
has become the largest socioeconomic group 
of the country, comprising about 47 percent 
of the population.
However, despite these impressive achieve-
ments, underlying vulnerabilities challenge 
Costa Rica’s development model. There is a 
sense that, although Costa Rica has achieved 

18 

Introduction and Country Context

Box 1.2 Costa Rica’s Celebrated Green Trademark 

Costa Rica takes up only 0.03 percent of the earth’s surface but is considered to be one of 
the 20 countries with the greatest biodiversity in the world, with 52 percent covered by 
forests and 26 percent in protected areas. This was not always the case. Although more 
than half of the country was covered by forest in 1950, deforestation had stripped this to 
just 26 percent by 1983 under the pressures of a growing population and massive conver-
sion of forest to pasture, underpinned by  policies that supported cattle ranching and agri-
cultural development.
Green Framework and Payments for Environmental Services. Recognizing the potential 
economic and global value of the forests and the risks to environmental degradation of 
rapid deforestation, several framework laws established the basic principles of Costa Rica’s 
“Green Trademark” aimed at rehabilitating wooded lands and setting aside vast areas of 
land as protected areas. It took years of policy debate and consensus building to develop 
a national approach of paying for environmental services—which now takes the form of 
the world-renowned Payments for Environmental Services (PES) program. This program 
builds on a long chain of earlier legislation that made the costs of reforestation tax de-
ductible (Forest Law No. 4475 of 1969), established reforestation as a legal imperative 
(Forest Law No. 6184 of 1977), and established fiscal incentives through the creation of 
certificates that rewarded landowners for reforestation and allowed for significant forest 
authority intervention in the use of forest resources (Forest Laws No. 7032 of 1986 and 
7174 of 1990).
The PES was formally established in 1995 when the government adopted Forest Law 
No. 7575. This law established a framework for payments to landowners for these eco-
system services, and established the National Fund for Forestry Financing (Fondo 
Nacional de Financiamiento Forestal, FONAFIFO), to manage the PES and established 
a new certificate for forest conservation to reward landholders for their ecosystem ser-
vices. Besides the 1995 Forest Law, the government enacted other environmentally re-
lated laws: (i) the 1995 Environment Law No. 7554, which mandates a “balanced and 
ecologically driven environment for all”; (ii) the 1996 Forest Law No. 7575, which man-
dates “rational use” of all natural resources and prohibits land cover change in forests; 
and (iii) the 1998 Biodiversity Law, which promotes the conservation and “rational use” 
of biodiversity resources and includes measures to conserve, protect, and sustainably 
exploit biological resources to ensure quality of life for future generations and the sur-
vival of natural heritage. Subsequently, the Fiscal Simplification and Efficiency Law No. 
8114 (2001) fixed FONAFIFO’s share of fuel tax revenues to 3.5  percent, guaranteed 
through the Ordinary National Budget. In addition, the Decree of the President of the 

Introduction and Country Context

Box 1.2 continued
Republic No. 32868 in 2005 (“Inaugurating and Regulating a Water Charging Scheme”) 
introduced a mandatory payment for ecosystem services via instituting a water tariff 
structure through which 25 percent of the proceeds from water charges are allocated to 
the PES Program.
National Parks and Protected Areas. The National System of Protected areas was introduced 
in the late 1980s, followed by the National System of Conservation Areas (Sistema Nacional 
de Áreas de Conservación, SINAC) was created in 1994 to organize the country into 11 
large conservation areas, most of which are based around a major national park, to avoid a 
situation in which the protected areas would serve as isolated “green islands” in an other-
wise improperly managed landscape. SINAC oversees over 160 protected areas, of which 
26 are designated national parks. Other areas are designated wildlife refuges, biological re-
serves, national monuments, forest reserves, national wetlands, and protected zones.
Carbon Neutrality. In May 2007, the Costa Rican government announced its intention to 
become 100 percent carbon neutral by 2021. Efforts are underway to begin offsetting all of 
the country’s carbon dioxide emissions using a wide range of budgetary, legal, and finan-
cial incentives including measures to promote biofuels, hybrid vehicles, and clean energy. 
Another key component of the national strategy will be a “C-Neutral” label to certify 
that tourism and certain industrial practices mitigate all of the carbon dioxide they emit. 
Under the new certification system, tourists and businesses would be charged a voluntary 
“tax” to offset their carbon emissions, with one ton of carbon valued at US$10. The funds 
would be used for conservation, reforestation, and research in protected areas.

impressive “levels” of performance for many 
indicators (relatively low poverty rates, long 
life expectancy, near-universal literacy, envi-
ronmental conservation), it is increasingly be-
coming constrained on the “deltas” of 
ado pting the changes needed to make the 
transition to a modern, higher- income econ-
omy that is aspiring to join the OECD. These 
“cracks in the system” are apparent in many 
dimensions: rising inequality; growing unem-
ployment, especially among the poor; consis-
tently high school dropout rates; increasing 

dissatisfaction in the quality of the health care 
system; rising electricity costs; a near halting 
of infrastructure investment; increasing air 
and water pollution; and the deteriorating fis-
cal balance. In turn, these risks are symptoms 
of deeper structural problems in the economy 
and the public sector. The implications of 
these challenges are worrisome: although the 
economy is expected to continue to grow at 
healthy rates, poverty reduction has stagnated, 
the incomes of the bottom 40 percent are fall-
ing behind, and inequality is rising.

20 

Introduction and Country Context

These challenges affect the basic pillars un-
derlying poverty reduction and shared pros-
perity: inclusion, growth, and sustainability.

 • On the inclusion front, inequality is 
rising, despite the countr y’s progressive 
policies and ambitious Social Com-
pact—and in contrast to the marked 
decline in inequality in much of the 
LAC region. Consequently, inequality 
offset the poverty-reducing impacts of 
growth in the late 2000s, and reversed 
what should have been a decline in 
poverty, with poverty increasing by 0.4 
 percentage points instead of falling by 
a projected three percentage points 
during the post-crisis recover y period. 
The widening income gap between rich 
and poor reflects changes in the labor 
market, weak educational outcomes, 
and a mismatch between the pattern 
of growth and the skills profile of the 
workforce.
 • On the grow th front, although Costa 
Rica’s growth performance over the 
past decades has been positive, it has 
not made much headway in conver-
gence with the United States, lagging 
behind structural peer  countries, such 
as Chile, Panama, and Uruguay. More-
over, the countr y faces several chal len-
ges to its competitiveness, including 
the mismatch of skills and jobs, invest-
ment-climate related factors, production 
costs, and weaknesses in public- sector 
administration. As a result, the econ-
omy is showing signs of built-up 
vulner abilities.
 • And finally, on the sustainability front, 
the deterioration of fiscal balances, ten-
sions in the Social Compact, and various 
risks to the Green Trademark all combine 

to threaten Costa Rica’s development 
model. The fiscal situation stands out as 
one of the most pressing development 
challenges facing Costa Rica. The recent 
deterioration stems from a combination 
of countercyclical measures undertaken 
during the crisis and structural forces. 
Without fiscal consolidation, the deficit 
could push public debt to  unsustainable 
levels and threaten the country’s eco-
nomic, social, and economic gains. 
Indeed, fiscal pressures, as well as rising 
inequality, and increasing dissatisfaction 
with social services all combine to create 
tensions in the social compact. Finally, 
Costa Rica’s leadership in  environmental 
conservation faces the challenge of 
growing pressures on the use of resources 
and of urbanization. Changing economic 
incentives threaten the gains in reforesta-
tion, and the use of agro- chemicals is 
worrisome. Urbanization has increased 
energy use, as well as air and water pollu-
tion; and the country has not  developed 
a long-term plan to  protect the environ-
ment from these threats.

This Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD) 
takes stock of Costa Rica’s path to success, and 
reflects on the development constraints and 
opportunities that the country faces going for-
ward. It does so through diagnostics of the 
trends, drivers, and challenges to provide ele-
ments to answer three basic questions:
1. To what extent has the Costa Rican 
development model been inclusive?
2. What has driven growth in Costa Rica 
in recent years, and what are the bottle-
necks that need to be addressed?
3. How sustainable is the development 
model of Costa Rica economically, 
socially, and environmentally?

ter 2 examines trends in poverty and 
shared prosperity. Chapter 3 assesses the 
inclusiveness of growth, with a focus on 
the challenge of rising inequality and the 
mismatch of labor opportunities and the 
skills of the workforce, with implications 
for the poor and the bottom 40 percent 
of the population. Chapter 4 analyzes the 
drivers of growth, as well as key con-

Introduction and Country Context

2. Poverty and Shared Prosperity

Pover ty rates in Costa Rica are among the lowest in Latin Amer ica and the Car ibbean, and 
the middle class is the predominant group. Nonetheless, pover ty increased and then stagnated 
dur ing and after the global cr isis. The patterns of pover ty show an uneven level of develop­
ment in the country, w ith the Central region being more prosperous relative to the per ipheral 
regions. Moreover, income inequality is r ising, in contrast w ith the histor ical decline observed 
in most countr ies in Latin Amer ica. Consequently, inequality offset the pover ty­reducing im­
pact of grow th in the late 2000s, w ith pover ty r ising instead of declining despite economic 
grow th.

Poverty: Relatively Low 
Levels, but Recent 
Stagnation

One of the great outcomes of Costa 
Rica’s sustained GDP growth and Social 
Compact is the reduction of poverty that 
took place over the second half of the 20th 
century. The poverty headcount—measured 
with an internationally comparable poverty 
line of US$4 per day—was reduced from 
around 40 percent in 1989 to 27 percent by 
the turn of the century. Poverty decreased 
further to 18 percent in 2007, falling at a 
rate of about 1.5 percentage points per year 
(figure 2.1a). However, poverty reduction 
stagnated during and after the global crisis. 
Trends for extreme poverty—defined inter-
nationally in Latin America and the Carib-
bean (LAC) as per capita income under 
US$2.50 a day—are similar, with a sustained 
fall from 14 percent in 2001 to seven per-
cent in 2007, and a slower decline after 
2010 to an average of five percent.1 Costa 
Rica’s poverty rate of 12 percent was the 
lowest in Latin American after Argentina 

(11 percent), Chile (10 percent), and 
 Uruguay (8 percent) and less than half of 
the LAC average in 2012.
Official poverty figures show a modest 
decline since the 1990s, and a stagnation of 
poverty since 2010. Using the official pov-
erty line and the per capita income aggre-
gate, overall poverty in Costa Rica declined 
from around 31 percent to 19 percent be-
tween 1989 and 2007 (figure 2.1b). Poverty 
reduction followed a cyclical pattern: after a 
period of sharp decline in 1989–1994, pov-
erty stagnated until 2000; then during the 
economic expansion of 2001–2007, it de-
clined modestly at about 0.6 percentage 
points per year. The global crisis reversed 
some of these gains, causing poverty to in-
crease to 21.6 percent in 2009; and it has re-
mained stable during the 2010–2014 period 
at around 24 percent. Extreme poverty fol-
lowed a similar pattern, declining from 9.9 
percent to 3.7 percent between 1989 and 
2007, and then increasing to 5.2 in 2009. 
Extreme poverty has averaged 7.2 percent 
in 2010–2014. By 2014, the number of poor 
amounted to 1.17 million, including 0.45 
million of extreme poor (box 2.1).2

Box 2.1 How Have Methodological Changes Affected Poverty Measures 
in Costa Rica?

The analysis of trends in poverty and inequality over time must be treated with some 
caution due to changes in methodologies used both for the collection of household survey 
data and for the calculation of poverty lines in Costa Rica.
Two household surveys are used to measure poverty from 1989 to 2014, but they do not 
allow for comparisons on poverty rates. The surveys are Encuesta de Hogares de Propósitos 
Múltiples (EHPM) up to 2009 and the Encuesta Nacional de Hogares (ENAHO) from 2010 
to 2014. Several improvements in the methodology to estimate household incomes were 
introduced in the ENAHO. For example, the new questionnaire includes more and better 
questions on labor and non-labor income; the consumption basket was revised using the 
consumption patterns found in the 2004 National Income and Expenditure Survey ; and 
there were methodological changes in how to adjust for under-declaration of incomes and 
the imputation of labor income.

Box 2.1 continued

Costa Rica uses two income-based poverty lines, one for extreme poverty and another for 
overall poverty. The extreme, or “food,” poverty line is the value of the basic food basket 
required for an individual to meet the minimum caloric intake. The overall poverty line 
considers other basic resources beyond food.
A methodological change in calculating the poverty line was also introduced with the 
ENAHO. Before 2010, both components of the poverty line were adjusted using the food 
consumer price index (CPI). This was likely to have resulted in overestimation of poverty 
when food prices were rising faster than overall prices, as happened in 2007–2009. In 2009, 
for example, the poverty rate would have been 18.7 percent, about three percentage points 
lower, if the non-food component of the poverty line had been updated using the general 
CPI (Figure B2.1.1). Since 2010, the official poverty line is adjusted using the food CPI for 
the food component of the poverty line and the non-food CPI for the non-food part.
Comparing Costa Rica’s poverty rates with those of other countries presents a series of 
challenges, but harmonized survey data are available for that purpose from the Socio-
Economic Database for Latin America and the Caribbean (SEDLAC). The harmoniza-
tion was developed by the Center for Distributional Labor and Social Studies (CEDLAS) 
at the University of La Plata, Argentina, and the World Bank. The harmonized survey 
data allow for cross-country comparability of poverty and inequality measures. However, 
per capita income and poverty lines from SEDLAC differ from official estimates. Extreme 
poor are individuals with a harmonized per capita income lower than US$2.50 a day, 
while poor are individuals with a harmonized per capita income lower than US$4 a day 
(2005 PPP). International comparable data from SEDLAC are available only up to 2012.

Profile of the Poor: 
Increasingly Urban, Larger 
Households, and Lower 
Educational Attainment

Spatially, poverty rates are the lowest 
in the Central region, as compared to the 
other regions. Poverty rates vary signifi-
cantly across the country (figure 2.2a). In 
particular, poverty rates are as high as 

35 percent in the Brunca and Chorotega 
regions, as compared with 19 percent in 
the Central region.
In terms of their numbers, however, the 
poor are concentrated in the Central Region. 
About half of the 1.7 million poor Costa Ricans 
live in the Central region, with the other half 
distributed almost evenly across the rest of the 
country ( figure 2.2b). The relative high concent-
ration of poor in the Central region mirrors 
population density as this region concentrates

Note: The sample of the household survey allows estimating poverty in the six regions of the country: Central; Chorotega; Pacifico Central; 
Brunca; Huetar Atlantica; and Huetar Norte. Poverty rates in 2001 and 2014 are not strictly comparable (see box 2.1). Poor are individuals 
with a per capita income below the official poverty line.

62 percent of the country’s now mostly urban 
population.
Regional disparities are significant, and 
poverty rates are much higher in the border 
areas. The 2011 county-level map of income 
(monetary) poverty produced by INEC re-
veals a large heterogeneity of poverty rates 
within and across regions.3 In particular, 
poverty rates range from over 50 percent 
along the border with Nicaragua and Pan-
ama to less than 15 percent in some coun-
ties located in the Central region (figure 
2.3a). The cantons with the highest poverty 
rates are also those where most of the in-
digenous population lives (box 2.2). Inter-
estingly, the poverty map also shows a high 
concentration of poor households, with al-
most a quarter of poor households 

con centrated in only five counties in Costa 
Rica in 2011 (figure 2.3b).
Poor and non-poor households have sig-
nificantly different characteristics. Table 2.1 
compares the profile of the poor and the 
non- poor, as well as those in the bottom 40 
and top 60 percent of the income distribution 
in 2014. Non-poor households tend to have 
higher levels of human capital: heads of house-
hold had nine years of education on average 
among the non-poor, compared with about 
five years among poor and extreme poor 
households. The poor and extreme poor be-
longed to larger households compared to the 
non-poor. They were also more likely to live 
in households with larger dependency ratios 
of younger children compared to the non- 
poor; the proportion of individuals 12 years

old or younger in poor households was twice 
as large as that observed in non-poor house-
holds in 2014.
Income-generation capacity also varies. For 
example, the average per capita income of the 
non-poor is 17 times higher than the income 
of the extreme poor and seven times higher 
than the income of the overall poor. The poor 
are more likely to work in the agricultural sec-
tor and to be self-employed, while the non- 
poor tend to work more in services and to be 
formally employed. The poor are also more 
likely to live in female-headed households, but 
non-poor women are twice as likely as poor 
women to participate in the labor force.
Indicators of “multidimensional pov-
erty” improved between 2000 and 2011. 

Despite the modest reduction in income 
(monetary) poverty reduction that the 
country experienced during the first decade 
of the 2000s, the 2011 Census revealed a 
significant reduction in the percentage of 
households considered poor from a multi-
dimensional measure, related mostly to im-
proved access to basic infrastructure and 
services.4 Thus, the percentage of house-
holds in multidimensional poverty—that is, 
who did not meet one or more of the four 
basic conditions—dropped from 36.1 
 percent in 2000 to 24.6 percent in 2011.5 
The share of households who did not meet 
the “education” component of the multi- 
dimensional indicator fell from 15.2 to 
8.3 percent, as school attendance of

indigenous People in Costa Rica: A Very Small and 
Disadvantaged Minority

Costa Rica’s indigenous population is small, but occupies a vast share of the land. In the Latin 
American region as a whole, indigenous people make up about seven percent of the total 
population (over 36.6 million people). In comparison, in Costa Rica they represent 2.4 percent 
of the population (104,143 indigenous people). As such, Costa Rica, along with El Salvador, is 
the country with the smallest proportion of indigenous people in the entire region. In terms of 
land, legally established indigenous territories cover about seven percent of the Costa Rican 
territory (about 350 thousand hectares), but 91 percent of the indigenous population is 
concentrated in three cantons—Talamanca, Buenos Aires, and Hojancha (figure B2.2.1).
In the first decade of the 2000s, the indigenous population experienced a similar demo-
graphic transition as the rest of the Costa Rican population, with a falling share of chil-
dren and a growing share of elderly adults. The dependency rate fell from 108 percent in

2000 to 79.8 percent in 2011, showing the sharp decline in the share of children that re-
sulted from a decline in fertility rates, from 9.6 to two between 2000 and 2011, together 
with an increase in the share of elderly adults, from four percent to 8.8 percent. Even if in-
digenous households are still larger than non- indigenous (3.6 versus 3.4 people per house-
hold) these differences have been falling over time.
Historically, indigenous populations have had lower access to basic services than the non- 
indigenous. Despite a broad coverage of basic services to most of the population of Costa Rica, 
indigenous people still lag behind in access to electricity, water supply, and sewage. According 
to the 2011 Census, 80 percent of indigenous households had an electricity connection, 
against 99 percent of non-indigenous. Still, compared to other indigenous populations in 
LAC, access to electricity is higher than in Colombia (58 percent), El Salvador (62 percent), 
Nicaragua (50  percent), or Panama (40  percent). As for access to clean water, 31 percent of the 
indigenous population had no access to sewage (public or private), against four percent of 
non- indigenous. And only 67 percent had access to piped water, against 94 percent of non- 
indigenous ( figure B2.2.2). However, these indicators have improved significantly since 2000, 
as the 2000 Census reported that only 53 percent of households had access to clean water, 
50 percent had access to some form of sewage, and 67 percent had electricity. In addition the 
share of households living in overcrowded conditions fell from 30 percent to 11 percent.
Human capital accumulation and income generating opportunities are also lower for in-
digenous populations. Indigenous people report lower educational attainment than non- 
indigenous: average years of education among the indigenous is 6.1, against 7.7 for 
non-indigenous (although this shows progress from the 3.9 years on average in 2000).

Illiteracy is at 7.7 among indigenous and 2.2 among non-indigenous, and attendance to 
formal education among people 5–24 years old is 64.9 against 71.7 for non-indigenous. 
This translates into lower employment and income opportunities among the indigenous, 
as they have a higher probability of working in self-employment or unpaid work, and to 
be doing household chores rather than studying, for those who do not have an income- 
generating activity (figure B2.2.3).

of households did not satisfy the “health” 
condition, while 7.8 percent did not satisfy 
the “consumption” condition, and 6.2 per-
cent did not satisfy the “housing” condition 
(still, all three measures were lower than in 
2000). Increased access to piped water and 
sewage, increased access to electricity, and 
a lower dependency ratio contributed to re-
ducing the share of households who did not

Rise of the Middle Class

Nearly half of Costa Ricans are classified 
as “middle class.” The middle class, interna-
tionally defined as the share of the popula tion 
that lives on US$10 to US$50 per day, has ex-
panded significantly, from 32  percent of the 

population in 2001 to almost 47 percent by 
2012, mirroring trends in the LAC region 
(figure 2.4a). As figure 2.4b shows, Costa 
Rica’s middle class is among the largest in 
LAC in percentage terms, surpassed only by 
Argentina (54 percent) and Uruguay (57 per-
cent). Still, about one-third of the population 
(those with incomes between US$4 and 
US$10 a day) remains vulnerable to falling 
back into poverty if hit by a shock.
Upward mobility has contributed to the 
rise of the middle class. Trends in the share of 
poor and the middle class conceal movements 
in and out of poverty. Between 2003 and 2009 
(a period for which comparable data exist for 
Costa Rica), increasing incomes resulted in 
important upward mobility. About 17 percent 
of Costa Rica’s population (57 percent of the 
originally poor) escaped poverty during those 
years (figure 2.5).6 At the same time, however, 
about eight percent of the total population fell

living with a per capita income between US$4 and US$10 a day. Middle class is defined as the proportion of individuals with an income 
between US$10 and US$50 a day. Rich are those with an income higher than US$50 a day. Regional estimates are population-weighted 
averages of country-specific estimates for Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador,

(CEDLAS and the World Bank).
Note: Poor are individuals with a per capita income lower than $4 a day. Estimates of poverty at the regional level are population-weighted 
averages of country-specific estimates for Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, 
Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, and Uruguay. Country-specific figures in regional estimates come from 
2004 or 2012 surveys, or the nearest year in cases in which 2004 and/or 2012 data are unavailable. Due to comparability issues, Costa Rica 
estimates come from 2003 and 2009 surveys. International comparable SEDLAC data is available only up to 2012.

into poverty, including 11 percent of those who 
were previously non-poor. Downward mobility 
was higher in Costa Rica than in the LAC re-
gion, while upward mobility was lower. About 
23 percent of the total population of LAC (half 
of the originally poor) escaped poverty between 
2004 and 2012, while only four percent (about 
two percent of originally non-poor) moved into 
poverty during those years.
Costa Rica experienced many years of 
shared prosperity, with the incomes of the 
poorest 40 percent growing faster than the 
average. Income growth of the bottom 40 
 percent was six percent between 2003 and 
2007, higher than the mean income growth 
of 3.9 percent. Moreover, the incomes of 
those in the bottom 40 percent also grew 
faster in Costa Rica as compared with their 
counterparts in other countries in the LAC 
region (figure 2.6a).
However, after the g lobal f inancial cri-
sis, shared prosperity declined and the 

incomes of the poorest fell behind. Income 
growth for the bottom 40 percent fell to 1.6 
percent over the period from 2007 to 2012, 
signif icantly lower than average income 
growth in Costa Rica (3.4 percent) and 
among the lowest in LAC (f igure 2.6b). 
This lower income growth for those in the 
bottom 40 percent of the population did 
not allow many individuals to escape pov-
erty after 2010, and poverty reduction 
stagnated.
Before the crisis, even the poorest regions 
benefitted from shared prosperity. Between 
2003 and 2007 there was some income con-
vergence across regions, with the  incomes of 
the bottom 40 percent growing at more than 
10 percent in Brunca and Chorotega (the 
poorest regions in the country), against 3.4 
percent in Central region (figure 2.7a). Even 
in the Central region, incomes at the bottom 
40 and at the average grew at similar rates. 
However, after the global crisis ( figure 2.7b)

Rising Inequality, in 
Contrast to Regional 
Trends

Income inequality has risen or stag-
nated since the 1990s. Changes in house-
hold survey methodologies create problems 
for the comparability of measure of inequal-
ity over time (box 2.1).7 Nonetheless, long-
term trends over different periods indicate 
that inequality has either risen or remained 
flat since the late 1980s. During the period 
from 1989 to 2000, the Gini measure of in-
equality averaged 0.45, rising from 0.44 in 
1989 to 0.48 by 2000. During the period 
from 2001 to 2009, the Gini fell and then 

rose again, averaging 0.50 across the period. 
Inequality has risen in recent years, averag-
ing 0.52 from 2010 to 2014, a time period 
that corresponds both to the post-crisis re-
covery and to the period covered by the 
new ENAHO household survey (box 2.1).8
In contrast, the rest of Latin America 
witnessed a marked decline in inequality, 
with the regional average falling by five 
points, from 0.57 in 2000 to 0.52 in 2012 
( figure 2.8a).9 As a result, Costa Rica has 
gone from being the least unequal countr y 
in LAC after Uruguay in 2000, to being 
around the median countr y by 2012.10 In 
non-LAC OECD countries, income in-
equality has been consistently much lower, 
with a Gini coefficient 0.30 in 1995–2012. 
Rising inequality in Costa Rica is under-
pinned by the widening gap between the 
earned incomes and skillset of rich and 
poor workers in Costa Rica (see chapter 3).
Similar to most countries in LAC, in-
come is highly concentrated among the

Source: Calculations using SEDLAC data (CEDLAS and the World Bank) for LAC countries and OECD Stats for non-LAC OECD countries; and 
EHPM/ENAHO for Costa Rica.
Note: Numbers for LAC are calculated using pooled data in Panel A and population-weighted country-specific averages for Argentina, 
Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, 
Paraguay, Peru, and Uruguay in Panel B. Numbers for non-LAC OECD countries are un-weighted average of country-specific averages for 
non-OECD countries: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, 
Iceland, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Korea, Luxembourg, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, 
Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, united Kingdom, USA. Poor are individuals with a per capita income lower than US$4 a day (2005 
US$ Purchasing Parity Power per day). Vulnerable are those living with a per capita income between US$4-US$10 a day. Middle class is 
defined as the proportion of individuals with an income between US$10-US$50 a day. Rich are those with an income higher than US$50 
a day. SEDLAC international comparable data is only available up to 2012. Inequality numbers are not strictly comparable before and after 
2001 and before and after 2010 (box 2.1).

rich in Costa Rica. About 22 percent of in-
come is held by the rich in Costa Rica, a 
similar share to the average in LAC (figure 
2.8b). The top 20 percent of the population 
earns 54 percent of the income, while the 
share of income going to the middle class—
spanning the 48th to 96th centiles of the pop-
ulation in 2012—amounts to 61 percent. 
The average income of the rich was 10.3 
times higher than that of the poor in Costa 
Rica, slightly higher than the LAC ratio 
(9.5 times).
Within the country, inequality varies across 
regions. Brunca, Norte, and Chorotega are the 
regions with the highest income inequality, 
while Pacifica and Atlantica are the least un-
equal ( figure 2.9a). It is interesting to note that 

inequality fell since 2010 in all but the Central 
region, where the capital city of San Jose is lo-
cated. Thus, the Central region seems to have 
driven the overall increment of the Gini by one 
point. The weight of the Central region in ex-
plaining the overall Gini is confirmed by  figure 
2.9b, which shows that inequality in the Cen-
tral region accounts for three-quarters of total 
inequality in Costa Rica.

Limited Poverty 
Responsiveness to Growth

During the 2000s, poverty was not very 
responsive to growth in Costa Rica. Indeed,

increase in GDP per capita was associated 
with only a 0.60 percent reduction in the of-
ficial poverty rate.11 In comparison, the pov-
erty-growth elasticity in LAC over the same 
period was much higher, reaching 1.43. After 
the global financial crisis, the growth-poverty 
elasticity decreased even further in Costa 
Rica, to 0.44 over 2010–13, whereas in LAC 
it increased further to 2.0 in 2010–2012.12 
This low  poverty-growth elasticity in Costa 
Rica was also observed for periods before 
2000, particularly during the 1990s.13
The global financial crisis marks a clear 
inflection point, after which the incomes in 
the wealthiest deciles grew significantly faster 
and the poor fell behind. Growth incidence 
curves (figure 2.10) reveal that before 2007, 
growth was largely pro-poor. Indeed, the in-
comes of the bottom deciles of the income 
distribution grew faster than those in the top 
deciles. During and after the crisis, however, 
the incomes of those in the poorest deciles 

fell, further widening the gap between the 
poor and the rest of the population.
Over time, rising inequality and price 
 effects have offset the contribution of 
growth to poverty reduction. Changes in 
income poverty stem from growth, inequal-
ity, and inflation. Inflation could affect pov-
erty through its effects on real wages, cost 
of goods and  services, and the regressive 
nature of the inflation tax. Costa Rica’s suc-
cess in controlling inflation could suggest 
progress in poverty reduction. A decompo-
sition of changes in poverty suggests shift-
ing effects of these factors (figure 2.11). 
During the pre-crisis period, poverty fell by 
3.8 percentage points, helped by strong 
growth and changes in inequality that posi-
tively affected the bottom end of the income 
distribution. However, these gains were 
partially offset by rising prices. During the 
global crisis, growth slowed, food prices 
rose, and inequality worsened—so that the

Note: The poor are individuals with a per capita income lower than the official poverty line (the overall poverty lines was CRC 96,565 in June,

net effect was an increase in poverty of 2.6 
percentage points during these years (2007–
09). Finally, in the post-crisis recovery pe-
riod, rising inequality more than offset the 
positive contribution of growth to poverty 
reduction, such that poverty rose slightly 

during that period (2010–14). If income in­
equality had not increased, growth alone 
would have decreased poverty by three per­
centage points during the recovery of 2010–
14.14 Instead, poverty rose by 0.4 percentage 
points during that period.

Notes

 1. The rate of global extreme poverty, measured 
as the share of the population living with under 
US$1.5 per day, is 1.4 percent (2012). See 
World Bank Poverty and Inequality Database.
 2. Please note that poverty rates after 2010 are 
not comparable to previous years due to meth-
odological changes.
 3. The small area estimation technique follows 
Elbers, Lanjouw, and Lanjouw (2003) and 
combines information from surveys and cen-
suses to produce estimates of monetary pov-
erty in small geographic areas. By applying 
this technique, INEC combined information 
from the 2011 Census together with the 2011 
ENAHO survey to produce poverty rates at 
the county level. For more information on the 
2011poverty map visit INEC’s website  (www 
.inec .go.cr).
 4. The multidimensional poverty measure from 
INEC captures four basic conditions that are 
strongly related to monetary poverty : housing, 
health, education, and access to other goods 
and services (purchasing power). Each condi-
tion has one or more indicators. A house hold 
is considered poor if  it cannot satisfy one or 
more condition. 
 5. Morales (2013). 
 6. The analysis on the movement in and out of 
poverty relies on a synthetic panel estimated 
using the methodology of Dang and Lanjouw 
(2014). The synthetic panel results for poverty 
do not completely align with the national or 
international figures presented earlier, be-
cause the sample is restricted to households 
whose head is between 25 and 65 years of age.

 7. The long-term trends in poverty and inequal-
ity are subject to caveats regarding income 
measurement due to several changes in sur-
vey methodology across that time period. 
The main “breaks” in comparability of the 
data series occur in 2001 and 2010. As such, 
measurement of welfare across the three time 
periods of 1989–2000, 2001–09, and 2010–14 
is not strictly comparable. See box 2.1.
 8. Inequality based on official per capita income 
presents a similar trend, decreasing from 
0.52  to 0.48 in 2000–2005 and increasing to 
0.51 in 2009. After the global crisis, inequal-
ity increased marginally from 0.51 to 0.52 in 
2010–2014. The ENIG (Encuesto Nacional de 
Ingresos y Gastos) finds that income inequal-
ity remained constant with a Gini of 0.534 
after adjusting for methodological differences 
in the definition of  income (email exchanges 
with INEC’s staff http://www.inec .go.cr/).
 9. See World Bank (2014e).
 10. LAC averages and comparisons cover 17 coun-
tries for which internationally comparable 
data exist. See World Bank (2007) and World 
Bank (2014e). 
 11. This elasticity is somehow larger when using 
the international poverty rate.
 12. Measured using a US$4 a day poverty line.
 13. See World Bank (2007).
 14. The decomposition follows Kolenikov and 
Shorrocks (2005), who extended the standard 
Datt and Ravallion (1992) decomposition to in-
clude price changes. The effect of inflation dur-
ing 2007–2009 on the poverty rate is due mainly 
to measurement issues (see box 2.1).

Poverty and Shared Prosperity

3.  Inclusive Growth? Inequality, Jobs, 
and Skills

Costa Rica’s inequality trends over the last two decades present a dilemma. The widening income 
gap between the top and bottom quintiles of the population reflects changes in the labor market 
and a mismatch between the patterns of growth versus the skills profile of the workforce. With 
weak educational outcomes, the Costa Rican labor force is not well adapted to a labor market 
that increasingly demands high skills, and unemployment has increased among the poor and low­
skilled workers, particularly since the global crisis. The earnings gaps between rich and poor, and 
between the skilled and unskilled, have widened. Furthermore, despite Costa Rica’s ambitious So­
cial Compact, taxes and transfers have not proven to be effective in redistributing income to com­
pensate for these disparities.

Labor Earnings and 
Inequality

Rising inequality stands out as a pressing 
challenge for Costa Rica, particularly in light 
of its enduring commitment to a far- reaching 
Social Compact. As discussed in chapter 2, 
the gap between the rich and poor has wid-
ened significantly since the global crisis. This 
follows two decades of rising or stagnating in-
equality—in stark contrast to the significant 
decline in inequality in the broader Latin 
America and Caribbean (LAC) region. These 
trends are particularly puzzling given Costa 
Rica’s long-standing investment in an ambi-
tious Social Compact and high social spend-
ing, as discussed in more detail in chapter 5.
Most inequality stems from differences in 
earned labor incomes. In general, inequality 
can come from many sources: differences in 
labor earnings, pension income and other 
public sector transfers, and in the returns to 
capital. Throughout Latin America and the 
Caribbean, changes in poverty and inequal-
ity have been mainly driven by changes in 

labor incomes.1 And this has also been the 
case for Costa Rica, where changes in labor 
incomes have been the driving force behind 
reductions and increases in poverty and in-
equality over the past 15 years. Specifically, 
increases in labor incomes contributed to a 
4.2 percentage point reduction of poverty 
and a 1.0 point reduction in the Gini coeffi-
cient during the pre-crisis period of 2000–
07, but this trend was reversed during the 
global crisis and changes in labor incomes 
resulted in a 2.2 percentage point increase in 
poverty and a one percentage point increase 
in the Gini coefficient during the period 
from 2007 to 2009 ( figure 3.1). Over the 
post-crisis recovery period, changes in labor 
incomes have contributed to a slight increase 
in poverty and an additional one-point in-
crease in the Gini coefficient (2010–14).
Moreover, most inequality derives from 
differences in labor earnings in the private 
sector. A decomposition of the Gini coefficient 
in 2001, 2007, and 2012 reveals that labor in-
come explained over 80 percent of overall in-
come inequality (table 3.1).2 However, while

the labor income share decreased over the 
2000s to 72 percent, this decline was entirely 
explained by changes in labor incomes in the 
private sector, while the share of inequality 
stemming from differences in incomes from 
public sector jobs remained constant over that 
period. Although the contributions of non-la-
bor income remain relatively small, the share 
of inequality deriving from differences in re-
turns to capital and pension income doubled, 
from about nine percent to nearly 18 percent 
over the period (table 3.1). Public sector 

transfers (social assistance) reduced inequality 
only marginally and only until 2007: they be-
came regressive, contributing to increased in-
equality by 2012.3 This confirms that larger 
increases in the top portions of the income 
distribution (and in the public sector in par-
ticular) in the second half of the 2000s played 
an important role in the increase of inequality, 
which social assistance programs were not 
able to counterbalance.

Fewer Jobs for Poor 
and Unskilled Workers

Poor and unskilled workers are finding 
limited job opportunities due to the long-
term shift in Costa Rica’s pattern of growth 
and the recent contraction following the 
global crisis. Costa Rica’s outward- oriented 
economic development model has brought 
about a significant shift in the demand for 
skilled and unskilled labor. As discussed in 
chapter 4, it has favored the development of 
high value-added sectors, such as 

42 

Inclusive Growth? Inequality, Jobs, and Skills

 
 
 
 
 
electronics, medical devices, IT business 
services, and so forth. In contrast, lower 
value- added sectors, such as construction, 
domestic services, and agriculture have 
grown more slowly—or even contracted. 
The growth of low-end manufacturing (such 
as textiles), construction, and agriculture 
has particularly slowed since the onset of 
the global crisis. Job creation has been mini-
mal or even negative in sectors like con-
struction, domestic services, and agri culture, 
which employ over 50 percent of low-skilled 
workers (figure 3.2). At the other end of the 
spectrum, sectors that employ mostly skilled 
workers, such as financial services, real es-
tate, personal services, and others, are grow-
ing fast (though from a low base in the case 
of sectors such as utilities or financial ser-
vices). Changing patterns in foreign direct 
investment (FDI) and trade, along with 

Skill- Biased Technological Change, have in-
creased local demand for high-skilled labor 
at a time when Costa Rica has a larger rela-
tive supply of low-skilled labor.4 High and 
increasing labor costs, relative to other 
 Central American countries, could explain 
the decrease in low-skilled job creation in 
lower value-added sectors, as discussed in 
chapter 4.
This structural mismatch of skills and jobs 
has translated into rising unemployment and 
falling demand for low-skilled labor, particu-
larly since the crisis. Overall unemployment 
climbed from 4.6 percent just before the crisis 
to 7.3 percent during the crisis. Even with 
economic recovery post-crisis, unemployment 
has steadily risen to nine percent of the work-
force in 2014 ( figure 3.3). These trends reflect 
a growing mismatch between the demand for 
labor and the skills profile of the workforce.

As such, unemployment has hit the poor 
particularly hard. The unemployment rate for 
the bottom quintile in Costa Rica exceeds 20 
percent, far higher than for other income groups 
(figure 3.4a). By comparison, unemployment 

in the top two quintiles is less than five per-
cent. The differential in the unemployment 
rate between the poor and non-poor is signifi-
cant and increasing, reaching more than 15 
percent in 2013 (figure 3.4b). In contrast,

 unemployment rates in the bottom quintile 
among other Central American countries (El 
Salvador, Honduras, and Panama) are signifi-
cantly lower—hovering around five percent— 
likely reflecting higher rates of informality in 
their labor markets. Interestingly, higher un-
employment among the poor in Costa Rica is 
not associated with an increase in the share of 
self-employed workers (a proxy for informal 
employment).
Furthermore, over 60 percent of poor 
and extreme poor adults do not generate 
any labor income. There is a stark contrast 
in terms of labor market activity between 
the poor and the non-poor in Costa Rica. 
As figure 3.5 illustrates, over 60 percent of 
the working-age adults who are non-poor 
are employed, while about 30 percent are 
inactive and about four percent are unem-
ployed. In contrast, among the poor and 

the extreme poor, the opposite is true: 60 
percent or more of working-age adults in 
these groups are either inactive or unem-
ployed. Put differently, less than 40 percent 
of these adults generate any form of labor 
income. Moreover, this situation has 
slightly worsened since 2007, when the 
share of inactive plus unemployed was 
below 60 percent for the poor and slightly 
above for the extreme poor.
Moreover, the labor market presents a 
bleaker picture for women than for men. Fe-
male labor force participation has been his-
torically low in Costa Rica and is among the 
lowest in the LAC region. By 2013, slightly 
over half (50.8 percent) of women of work-
ing age were active in the labor market, and 
participation has fluctuated around 50 
percent during the 2000s, increasing only 
marginally. Moreover, unemployment rates

going from 6.9 percent in 2007 to 10.9 percent 
in 2013. As a result, the share of working-age 
women who are actually generating labor in-
come is below 40 percent. Poor women who 
are heads of household and immigrant

ment rates (box 3.1).

Box 3.1 Female Household Heads and immigrants Face a Tough 
Labor Market

In the last two decades, the Costa Rican population has seen a significant change in the 
composition of households, with an important increase in the share of households headed 
by women. Between 1990 and 2013, the share of households headed by women doubled 
from 18 percent to 36 percent. According to some studies, this increase implied a higher 
female participation in the labor market, especially among women who are low skilled 
and more likely to live in poverty. Indeed, the participation of female household heads in 
the labor force is much higher than the average female participation, although it is espe-
cially high among non-poor household heads (figure B3.1.1a).

Poor women who are heads-of-household experience particularly high unemployment 
rates. Female heads-of-household who are poor, and in particular single mothers, have an 
unemployment rate of over twice the average for women (figure B3.1.1b). Given that these 
women are more likely to have low skills, their employment opportunities are fewer, and 
as a result they experience higher unemployment.
Immigrant women have even higher unemployment rates. Immigrants, particularly from 
Nicaragua, represent a large share of the labor force in Costa Rica, in particular in low-
skilled employment. As shown in figure B3.1.2, women born in Nicaragua and other 
Central American countries have an unemployment rate around twice the average for 
women, whereas for men the rate is below average.

to ensure opportunities for the poor. Educa-
tional outcomes are surprisingly weak, given 
the level of spending and development. Like 
many middle-income countries, Costa Rica 
is finding that achieving basic levels of edu-
cation, such as near universal literacy and 
completion of primary school, is not enough 
to generate the skills needed to sustain the 
demands of its evolving economy—or to 
promote inclusive opportunities for the poor 

and bottom 40 percent of the population. 
Given the country’s level of development and 
high spending, its education system seriously 
underperforms in terms of retention (as evi-
denced by high school dropout rates) and 
quality (as demonstrated by weak test results). 
Moreover, disparities in education out comes 
are large, putting the poor and bottom 40 
percent at a significant disadvantage for 
learning and earning.

Low educational attainment: 
overall and for the poor

Despite large public investment and impor-
tant achievements, average school attain-
ment is still low in Costa Rica. The growing 
investment in education in the country has 
brought important gains in terms of literacy 
and primary school completion. By 2011, 
the literacy rate for adults 15 years old and 
above had reached 97 percent, and the share 
of adults 25 years and above who had no for-
mal education went from 21 percent in 1950 
to three percent in 2010. By 2010, 83 percent 
of adults had achieved at least a complete 
primary education ( figure 3.6a). However, 
the average level of education today is below 
what would be expected given Costa Rica’s 
GDP per capita and education spending. In-
deed, today, fewer than half of young adults 
18–29 years old—and less than 40 percent of 
the overall workforce—have completed sec-
ondary education (figure 3.6b).
Indeed, compared with other countries, 
dropout rates are quite high in Costa Rica. 

Less than half of the cohort 25–29 years old 
had achieved a secondary or higher educa-
tion by 2010, further adding to the stock of 
low-skilled adult workers, a legacy of the 
1980s crisis. Costa Rica’s educational attain-
ment is lower than in peer countries in LAC 
(such as Chile and Panama), and significantly 
lower than in peer countries in Europe (such 
as Croatia and Lithuania), and far lower than 
graduation rates in the Organisation for Eco-
nomic Co-operation and Development 
(OECD) (figure 3.7).
Inequities in educational attainment are 
closely related to poverty. Figure 3.8a shows 
gross attendance rates by quintile for primary 
and secondary. Attendance in primary is 
higher at lower levels of income, which is 
positive in the sense that it is very high for 
all children, even the poorest. However, 
 figure 3.8b shows that the share of children 
who are over-age (that is, who are a year or 
more older than the correct age for their 
grade) is higher for children in poorer quin-
tiles. Taken together, these statistics suggest

that even though enrollment is high among 
poor children, repetition rates are also high, 
and therefore the quality of their learn ing 
might be lower and their incentives to drop 
out after completing primary may be higher. 
Consistent with that story, we observe that 

enrollment rates in secondary are signifi-
cantly higher for children in richer quintiles.
There are large disparities in enroll-
ment in day care and preschool, but these 
even out by the time children enter pri-
mar y school. As  f igure 3.9a shows, by age

four about 60 percent of children from 
households with educated parents are at-
tending a day-care center, as compared 
with 40 percent for children in households 
with medium education attainment, and 
about 20 percent for children from house-
holds with low education.5 Attendance in 
preschool is also higher for children from 
wealthier families: virtually all f ive to six 
year olds from the top quintile of the pop-
ulation attend preschool, as compared with 
79 percent of those in families in the poor-
est quintile.6 Enrollment equalizes by the 
time children start f irst grade, and it re-
mains close to 100 percent for all children 
throughout primar y, ref lecting Costa Rica’s 
long-standing guarantee of basic public 
education.
The transition from primary to second-
ary school is particularly prone to high drop-
out rates, especially among children from 
households with weaker parental education. 

At around age 12, some children begin to 
drop out, and those from households with a 
low “educational environment” (that is, chil-
dren whose parents have low education) 
have a much faster dropout rate than chil-
dren from more educated households (figure 
3.9b). In fact, a recent study of the factors 
behind human capital accumulation finds 
that, although context variables, such as 
place of residence, explained a significant 
share of the educational attainment inequal-
ity in the 1990s, at present only household 
and individual level variables, such as paren-
tal education, explain such outcomes.7 In-
come status also affects enrollment, with 
only 77 percent of teens aged 13 to 17 from 
households in the poorest quintile attending 
school as compared with 93 percent of those 
from households in the richest quintile.8
Dropouts are highest in seventh grade, 
just after the completion of primar y educa-
tion. For many children, this is linked to

KNoWLeDGe GAP 3.1 Why Are So Many Kids Dropping out of School in 
Costa Rica?

The skill-biased development that Costa Rica has experienced has raised returns to 
education, particularly secondary and tertiary. Given a large secondary school network in 
the country and universal primary completion, it is therefore surprising that more than 
half of the children who finish primary fail to complete secondary education. Although 
some general factors are known (see figure K3.1.1), such as lack of motivation, distance 
(in rural areas), and gender bias, the specific factors that push children out of school are 
still unknown, as are the critical ages at which early signs of dropout can be detected.

attainment of adults 15 years and older is up 
to twice as high in the Central Region (dark 
green in the map) as in the peripheral dis-
tricts around it (dark red districts). A rank-
ing of all districts in Costa Rica according to 
the share of adults 17–21 who have com-
pleted secondary education shows that there 
is a 42-percentage point gap between the 
completion rate for the bottom and the top 
20 percent of districts in terms of completion 
(26.3 percent against 68.2 percent). A similar 
gap is seen in terms of net upper secondary 
enrollment ( figure 3.10b) across districts, al-
though the gap has been closing in recent 
years, as low- performing districts have in-
creased their enrollment rates faster than 
high-performing ones.9 Notice, however, that 
even in the best- performing districts net 

enrollment in upper secondary is below 
50 percent.

Poor quality of education

The quality of education in Costa Rica is also 
very low, given its level of spending. At the 
primary school level, the latest results from 
the TERCE examination of Latin American 
students by UNESCO show that Costa Rica is 
the only country in the sample where stu-
dents in both third and sixth grades per-
formed worse in TERCE (2013) than they 
did in SERCE (2006) in reading and in math-
ematics.10 Similarly, the performance of Costa 
Rican students at the secondary school level 
is also weak. Speci fically, the performance of 
15-year-old students on the international 
PISA mathematics exam is far lower than

would be predicted by Costa Rica’s spending 
on secondary education (figure 3.11).11 More-
over, since these tests are taken only by those 
who remain in school by age 15, and since 
dropout rates are so high in Costa Rica, the 
average skill levels and learning outcomes of 
all 15 year olds (including those in and out-
side school) are likely even lower.
Moreover, there are large disparities in 
learning outcomes by socioeconomic sta-
tus. UNESCO’s SERCE study also shows 
that  children from higher socioeconomic 
backgrounds obtain better scores than 
their peers from lower socioeconomic 
backgrounds ( f igure 3.12).12

Widening Earnings Gaps 
for Poor and Unskilled 
Workers

Wages are relatively high across the 
board—even in low value-added sectors. 
As discussed in chapter 4, Costa Rica has rel-
atively high wages compared to Central 
American neighbors, in both agriculture and 
low- tech industry (light manufacturing)—
two sectors that traditionally employ low-
skilled workers. Surprisingly, neither rising 
rates of unemployment nor the continuous 
influx of low-skilled migrant workers from

KNoWLeDGe GAP 3.2 Are Reservation Wages High in Costa Rica?

The increase in unemployment rates, especially among poor workers, and the marginal 
changes in self-employment, a proxy for informal employment, is a puzzling finding. Most 
LAC countries respond to a decrease of jobs in the formal sector with a surge in informal 
employment, in the absence of a safety net that enables workers to look for other formal jobs. 
In Costa Rica, however, this did not happen, even if there is no clear evidence that the social 
safety net provides sufficient income support to those who are unemployed. Thus, the ques-
tion arises of how high reservation wages are in Costa Rica, in a context of high average wages 
and a high cost of living relative to other countries in the region.a

a. For evidence on the cost of living in Costa Rica by international standards, see Programa Estado de la Nacion (2014).

Nicaragua (box 3.2) have put down ward 
pressure on low-skilled wages. Moreover, the 
minimum wage does not appear to be driv-
ing artificially high low-skilled wages. Mini-
mum wages are binding for most Costa Rican 

workers in formal salaried jobs, especially in 
low-skilled jobs.13 And while changes in min-
imum wages over the 1980s–1990s did result 
in a small reduction in employment, this ef-
fect was minor, and there were no effects on

Box 3.2 Nicaraguan Workers in Costa Rica Do Not Appear to Drive 
Down Native Workers’ Wages

Immigrants, particularly from Nicaragua, represent a large share of the labor force in 
Costa Rica, in particular in low-skilled employment. In 2013, over 10 percent of those 
employed in Costa Rica were foreign-born, of which eight percent were Nicaraguan. 
Nicaraguan immigrants in Costa Rica are largely unskilled: less than 20 percent com-
pleted secondary school while over a third (35 percent) did not complete primary 
school.a However, Costa Ricans also have low schooling on average—in fact, 46 percent 
of both Nicaraguan and native-born adults finished primary school but did not complete 
secondary. This significant overlap in educational attainment suggests the potential for 
competition between these two groups for low- or unskilled jobs. This can be particularly 
true in specific sectors and specific parts of the country due to the non-random disper-
sion patterns of immigrants. Four sectors of employment—agriculture, domestic service, 
commerce and hotels/restaurants, and construction—account for 75 percent of low-
skilled immigrant employment in 2013. For context, these same four sectors accounted 
for only 59 percent of low-skilled native-born employment. In some parts of the country, 
foreign-born workers account for significant shares of workers in these four sectors, 
including over 20 percent of all workers in domestic services and construction in Huetar 
Norte and the Central regions.
The presence of immigrant workers has little bearing on the wages of low-skilled Costa 
Rican workers—and is actually correlated with higher wages among higher-skilled Costa 
Ricans. Exploiting the sectoral and geographical differences in immigrant employment in 
Costa Rica, log wage regressions reveal positive correlations between native wages and the 
proportion of  foreign-born workers in the same employment category as natives, where 
the employment category is defined at the region and sector level. This suggests positive 
complementarities between immigrant labor and skilled native labor. This is a sizeable 
relationship, with native workers who completed secondary receiving a wage premium of 
22 percent at the average share of immigrants for this group (8.3 percent).b At the same 
time, no statistically significant relationship is evident between unskilled native workers 
and immigrants—suggesting that wages of native workers are not being lowered by 
immigrant labor. Similar analysis found no evidence of increased unemployment among 
native labor in regions with more immigrants.

a. These education rates are calculated for the adult population 20 and above using the 2011 Costa Rica Census.
b. Note that this is not necessarily a causal relationship—for example, it could be that immigrant workers are more likely to migrate 
to higher-paying regions and/or work in higher-wage sectors resulting in a higher share of immigrant workers in these higher-paying 
sectors.

wages or employment in the uncovered sec-
tors (self- employment). More recently, 
changes in the minimum wage have been 
very modest, mostly correcting for inflation, 
and the evolution of the real minimum wage 
has closely tracked the evolution of labor 
productivity (figure 3.13). Moreover, a study 
of the increase in the enforcement of mini-
mum wage policy shows that it had a small 
positive effect on wages, especially where the 
minimum wage is most binding (at lower lev-
els), but it did not affect employment in any 
segment of the  distribution.14 Rather, it ap-
pears that high income levels, coupled with 
generous social benefits, have resulted in 
high reservation wages across the board in 
Costa Rica.
Despite relatively high wages even for 
low-skilled workers, the earnings gap be-
tween rich and poor workers is widening. 

Even though earnings have grown in real 
terms for low-skilled workers, they have 
fallen in relative terms to high-skilled work-
ers. As figure 3.14 shows, relative to the me-
dian earnings level, between 2007 and 2013 
workers in the top quintile increased the 
ratio of their earnings to the median earner 
by 0.19 (from 2 to 2.19). At the same time, 
workers in the bottom quintile decreased 
the ratio of earnings to the median by 0.23 
(from 0.52 to 0.29), while workers in the 
second to fourth quintile kept the ratios to 
the median almost flat. A similar picture is 
seen when income groups are divided ac-
cording to workers’ education. For workers 
with tertiary education, the ratio to the me-
dian income increased from 1.89 to 2.01 be-
tween 2007 and 2013, for workers with 
secondary complete and secondary incom-
plete it remained flat, and for workers with

primary or less the ratio fell from 0.79 to 
0.73 of the median income. This resulted 
in a widening of the gap between the high-
est-paid and the lowest-paid workers, 
which is at the root of the increase in in-
equality that occurred in the second half of 
the 2000s.
Indeed, the incomes of the poorest and 
those with the lowest skills grew faster be-
fore the crisis—and fell the most since the 
crisis.  figure 3.15 plots the evolution 

of incomes for individuals in the poorest 
income decile ( figure 3.15a) and the r ichest 
decile ( figure 3.15b), divided according to 
the educational attainment (skills level) of

clearly that before 2007, the incomes of in-
dividuals in the poorest decile, whose head 
of household had fewer than eight years of 
education, grew faster than the incomes of 
those individuals (also in the poorest 
decile) whose household head had more

the incomes of individuals in the richest 
decile, which actually fell between 2001 and 
2007. In contrast, starting in 2008 low in-

ent after 2010.15 Interestingly, educational

ers in the pre-crisis period.

Redistribution Has Not 
Offset Rising Inequality

Finally, redistributive policies have 
not been effective in compensating for in-
equities associated with labor earnings and 
skills. Redistribution policies have had a 
modest effect on overall inequality. The 
challenges facing Costa Rica and other 
LAC countries for reducing poverty in the 
future highlight the importance of ensur-
ing that fiscal policy has a strong equity 
focus and redistributes the gains from 
growth among those who are less well off.16 
The Commitment to Equity Project (CEQ), 
a joint initiative of Tulane University and 
the Inter-American Dialogue, has devel-
oped a harmonized methodology to assess 
the distributional impact of taxation and 
public expenditure throughout Latin 
America.17 Figure 3.16a shows the gradual 
impact of fiscal policy in six LAC countries 
including Costa Rica. Fiscal policy is de-
composed into direct taxes (such as in-
come and payroll taxes); direct transfers 
(such as non- contributor y pensions, and 

conditional and unconditional cash trans-
fers); and indirect taxes and transfers (such 
as value added taxes, and fuel subsidies).18 
In Costa Rica, direct and indirect transfers 
and taxes decrease income inequality by 
three Gini points, from 0.51 to 0.49, a re-
duction comparable to Brazil, Mexico, and 
Uruguay, and larger than the reduction in 
Bolivia and Peru. The evidence available 
for these six countries suggests that fiscal 
policy in LAC is not able to counterbalance 
the inequality pressures from labor 
income.
On the other hand, the experience from 
OECD countries shows that redistributive 
policy has the potential to reduce inequal-
ity. As figure 3.16b shows, non-LAC OECD 
and select LAC countries, including Costa 
Rica, have similar levels of market income 
inequality before any fiscal intervention. 
The Gini coefficient hovers around 0.4 and 
0.5 for all these countries. However, there 
are significant differences in the impact of 
transfers (direct taxes on income, payroll 
taxes, and direct transfers) between the 
LAC group and the OECD. The Gini that 
results after taking into account direct taxes 
and transfers in the OECD group is some-
where around 0.3, while it remains almost 
unchanged at around 0.5 in Costa Rica and 
the rest of the LAC group. According to 
World Bank (2014e), the low tax revenue 
and high reliance on indirect taxation in 
LAC are important reasons for these differ-
ences. This is also the case of Costa Rica. If 
compared with non-LAC OECD countries, 
fiscal revenues are low and rely heavily on 
indirect taxes, which are neutral in relative 
terms and therefore tend to reduce the pro-
gressivity of the overall tax system.19

income definitions. Market Income is the income received before any fiscal intervention. Net Market Income subtracts direct income and 
and subtracts taxes from disposable income. Final Income is Post-Fiscal Income plus in-kind public transfers on health and education 
payroll taxes to Market Income. Disposable Income is Net Market Income plus direct transfers. Post-Fiscal Income adds indirect subsidies 
(World Bank 2014e).

4.  The Nature of Costa Rica’s Growth and 
Its Constraints

Costa Rica’s small and open economy has achieved solid growth with an outward­oriented model 
combined with macroeconomic and political stability. This model has encouraged export diversifi­
cation towards higher value­added sectors and increasing labor productivity. However, the economy 
is showing signs of built­up vulnerabilities, resulting in weak job creation and loss of competitive­
ness. How can Costa Rica achieve higher levels of growth? Evidence points to three priority areas: 
education & skills, infrastructure, and government effectiveness and regulatory quality.

Costa Rica experienced solid economic 
growth in the past 25 years, as compared to 
Latin America and the Caribbean but not 
with other countries. Its real growth averaged 
4.7 percent since 1990, above the Latin 
 America average of 3.1 percent (figure 4.1). 
During 2003–2007, Costa Rica’s GDP growth 
was particularly strong at 6.7 percent on av-
erage, well above the regional average for Latin 
America of 4.6 percent. During the crisis, 
growth slowed to 1.2 percent in 2008 and 
contracted by one percent in 2009. Following 
the global crisis, Costa Rica recovered simi-
larly to a set of peer comparator countries 
(Chile, Croatia, Dominican Republic, Lithua-
nia, Panama, and Uruguay) (figure 4.2). How-
ever, this recovery has been slower than that 
of upper-middle -income countries or com-
parator countries in Latin America and the 
Caribbean (LAC). Growth decelerated in 
2013 to 3.5 percent and remained stable in 
2014. The outlook is that growth will not ac-
celerate in 2015, amid  deteriorating fiscal bal-
ances and a rising public debt-GDP ratio, but 
it is expected to pick up afterwards. The recent 
closure of Intel’s microchip factory is expected 
to dampen growth by about one-half to three- 
quarters percentage points in 2014–15.1

More broadly, GDP per capita did not 
make much headway in convergence with 
the United States (f igure 4.3). GDP per 
 capita grew by 83 percent to US$ 5,839 
(constant, 2005 prices)—higher than the 
average of countries in LAC (48 percent) 
and the world (35.5 percent). In terms of 
Latin American per capita income ranking, 
Costa Rica is the seventh richest countr y 
of the region (in 2005 constant US$), just

as it was back in 1960 and 1990. Growth 
has displayed low volatility in international 
comparisons during 2000–2013 (figure 4.4).

Growth Analysis and 
Trends

When examining growth by factor of 
production, the contribution of capital has 
been relatively stable in the past two decades. 
However, the mid-2000s saw a sharp decline 
in the contribution of Total Factor Produc-
tivity (TFP). Between 2000 and 2004, TFP 
declined strongly and even turned negative, 
dragging overall growth by about 1.7 per-
centage points a year (down from the positive 
contribution to growth of about 0.9 percent-
age points a year over the 1995–1999 period). 
TFP recovered over the 2005–2009 period, 
but employment growth declines resulted in 
a sizeable reduction in labor’s contribution 
to output growth from about 3.2 percentage 

points a year to 1.9 percentage points (figure 
4.5). Over the 2010–2014, the contribution 
of labor further declined to 1.1 percentage 
points. Although growth accounting is a de-
scriptive methodology and, by definition, 
does not provide specific insights into the 
factors that underlie TFP growth, economists 
have consistently relied on measures of the 
growth “residual” TFP as a gauge of a coun-
try’s technological change and innovation. 
In this light, TFP growth reflects a realloca-
tion of inputs to the sector of the economy 
with higher productivity gains. Moreover, 
this is consistent with observed increases in 
labor productivity, measured as output per 
worker (figure 3.13 in chapter 3 and figure 4.6).
Weakened investment and net exports 
have dragged growth in recent years. In 
the mid-2000s, the external sector had a pos-
itive contribution to growth from an 
 aggregate demand perspective, as exports 
outweighed imports (figure 4.7). With the

global crisis, however, exports declined 
sharply without an accompanying strong de-
cline in imports. Softer economic growth in 
the United States (Costa Rica’s main trading 
partner) as well as in China have weakened 
demand, and the recent closure of Intel’s mi-
crochip factory in 2014 has further reduced 
exports. Intel’s electronics exports alone ac-
counted for 20 percent of merchan dise ex-
ports.2 The lost dynamism in exports has been 
exacerbated by rising imports outside free 
trade zones (FTZs). The contribution of in-
vestment has also declined, lowering overall 
GDP growth.
The service sector continues to sustain 
growth. It has accounted for more than 60 
percent of GDP growth (about 2.7 percent-
age points of growth per year) before and 
after the global crisis (figure 4.8). Economic 
growth has been particularly strong in the 
telecommunications and tourism sectors. 
The telecom liberalization has brought a 

renewed dynamism to the economy due to 
new investments and expansion in the provi-
sion of services.3 The tourism sector also 
showed healthy growth of eight percent a 
year in both 2013 and 2014, though its con-
tribution to overall GDP remains small (ac-
counting for about 4.6  percent of GDP).
However, manufacturing, agriculture, 
and construction have reduced their contri-
bution to GDP growth. The manufacturing 
sector has experienced a loss of competi-
tiveness due to exchange rate appreciation, 
growing wages for low-skilled workers, and 
rising electricity prices. The construction 
sector, which experienced a boom in the 
2000s, has not returned to pre- crisis levels. 
The data on new construction permits (ex-
cluding infrastructure and all public con-
struction) shows that during the boom years 
the construction sector doubled the num-
ber of permits from 2.2 to 4 million of 
square meters per year ; but, after adjusting

is the Contraction of employment in the 
Agriculture, Manufacturing, and Construction Sectors Cyclical or 
Structural?

Costa Rica has seen a significant contraction in employment in the construction, manu-
facturing, and agricultural sectors. Cyclical patterns could be the culprits as the pattern 
emerged during the global crisis for all three sectors, compounded by the Roya coffee rust 
fungus and weather factors in agriculture. However, the contraction in jobs has persisted, 
which is particularly worrisome given that these sectors employ a higher share of the poor 
and lower-skilled workers—and given the sustained rise in unemployment. What are the 
structural factors in these sectors that are causing this sustained contraction?

abruptly in 2009, the number of new per-
mits has contracted in the last two years. 
Amounting to about five percent of GDP, 
the construction sector is relatively under-
developed in Costa Rica when compared to 
Panama (10 percent) or Uruguay (eight 
percent)). This underdevelopment is partly 
attributed to weakened public infrastruc-
ture spending, which has been constrained 
by the limited fiscal space and anemic im-
plementation of projects, and lower credit 
growth. Agriculture output also stagnated 
due to weather factors and the spread of the 
Roya fungus (“coffee rust”).4 As a share of 
GDP, agriculture accounts for five percent 
of GDP, though it generates 12 percent of 
jobs. Agriculture is an important source of 
jobs for the bottom 40 percent of the popu-
lation (18 percent) and the extreme poor 
(22 percent). Agricultural products, mainly 
coffee, pineapples, and bananas, account for 
25 percent of exports.
The slowdown in economic activity after 
the global crisis has translated into weaker 
job creation. As discussed in chapter 3, the 
unemployment rate stood at nine percent 
in 2014, which was relatively high by Costa 
Rican historical standards (figure 3.3). In the 

past three years, the economy has been add-
ing around 10,000 jobs per year, which is 
lower than the usual average annual increase 
in the labor force of about 38,000. The un-
derperformance of the construction and ag-
riculture sectors is particularly worrisome 
considering that they employ a higher share 
of low-skilled workers ( figure 4.9). Another 
explanation for weaker job creation is that 
new firms, which tend to create more jobs, 
are not appearing in sufficiently high num-
bers following the global crisis (figure 4.10).

Policies Explaining 
Growth

Macroeconomic stability

One of the reasons behind growth perfor-
mance is that the country has made efforts 
to maintain reasonable macroeconomic sta-
bility. Costa Rica learned the importance of 
macroeconomic stability the hard way : dur-
ing the Latin American crisis of the early 
1980s it suffered a cumulative per-capita in-
come loss of nearly 20 percent. Following 
that crisis, a new government started a se-
ries of structural reforms and committed to

The Nature of Costa Rica’s Growth and Its Constraints

pursuing macroeconomic stabilization.5 
Those policies proved successful in achiev-
ing a high and sustainable rate of growth av-
eraging nearly five percent per annum in 
1983–2006. The fiscal deficit was virtually 
eliminated at the end of that period, and 
public debt was reduced by two thirds, of 
which less than 20 percent was from exter-
nal sources. The decline of the debt burden 
was due in part to the Ministry of Finance 
initiatives relating to the creation of a con-
solidated cash management office and the 
implementation of a debt management strat-
egy. Monetary and exchange rate policies 
have evolved from a crawling peg policy to 
exchange rate band (2006) to abandonment 
of the pre-defined bands (2015). Inflation 
has dropped to single digits since 2009. 
Until the global crisis, Costa Rica’s GDP 
had not  contracted in 25 years.

Trade liberalization, FDI, and 
structural transformation

Moreover, outward-oriented policies have 
played a key role in fostering trade. Trade lib-
eralization has been nurtured through various 
actions and dates back to 1963, when Costa 
Rica joined the Central American Common 
Market (CACM, made up of El Salvador, 
Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua). Join-
ing the CACM required the elimination of 
trade barriers among member countries and 
fueled an increase of manufacturing exports 
to the CACM. A second milestone took place 
20 years later (1983), when Costa Rica joined 
the Caribbean Basin Initiative, strengthening 
its trade relations with the United States.6 Like 
other Central American countries, Costa Rica 
began to reduce tariffs unilaterally in the mid-
1980s, with trade tariffs declining from 53 
percent in 1985 to about 5.2 percent in 2004 

and falling further since then. But perhaps the 
most significant step was joining CAFTA-DR, 
after an intense national debate that required 
a referendum for its ratification. 7 CAFTA-DR 
provided a more stable and reliable frame-
work for Costa Rica’s trade with its main trad-
ing partner, the United States, introduced 
changes to the legal framework to promote 
transparency, ensured a secure and predict-
able environment for investors, and led to the 
breakdown of government monopolies in the 
telecom and insurance sectors.8 Following 
CAFTA-DR, Costa Rica has entered into fur-
ther trade agreements with Canada, China, 
the European Union, Mexico, Peru, and Sin-
gapore, consolidating its open-economy 
agenda. Exports now represent around 55 
percent of GDP, compared to around 27 per-
cent in 1980. The openness of the economy 
(measured by the ratio of exports plus im-
ports to GDP) increased to 100 percent of 
GDP from 65 percent during the same period.
An explicit policy to attract foreign di-
rect investment (FDI) complemented trade 
liberalization efforts. Trade agreements, 
through provisions governing investment, 
reduce the risk of expropriation and ensure 
against the discrimination of foreign firms. 
The passage of the Free Trade Zones law in 
1981 (amended in 1990 and 2010), which 
was adopted to promote the export of non- 
traditional products, has contributed to 
 attract FDI into Costa Rica.9 Free Trade 
Zones accounted for 51 percent of mer-
chandise exports in 2014, compared to 21 
 percent in 1997. Whereas Costa Rica’s in-
vestment attraction efforts in the 1980s fo-
cused on lower value- added sectors such as 
textiles, since the mid-1990s it has shifted to 
attracting FDI with high value-added sec-
tors, especially electronics and advanced 
manufacturing, medical devices and life 

70

sciences, and ICT-related services. The 
coun try received US$407 million (three 
percent of GDP) in FDI inflows in 1997, 
and this grew to US$2.7 billion by 2013 (5.4 
percent of GDP). FDI decreased by about 
1.2 percentage point of GDP, reaching 4.2 
percent of GDP in 2014, partly affected by 
the exit of Intel and Bank of America (figure 
4.11a). Nevertheless, Costa Rica is one of 
the world’s most FDI-intensive economies, 
with its FDI-to-GDP ratio exceeding inter-
national levels from 1985 through 2010.10 
The composition of FDI has shifted towards 
services, which accounted for 8.3 percent of 
total FDI inflows in 2002–05, but increased 
to 28 percent in 2010–14, partly attributed 
to the liberalization of the telecom and in-
surance sectors (figure 4.11b). In 2014, 
Costa Rica attracted US$474.4 million of 
new investments across 39 projects that cre-
ated 10,281 jobs, offsetting the 4,343 jobs 
lost due to the exit or downsizing of some 
foreign firms.11
A successful institutional cluster has been 
effective in supporting trade and FDI. In the 
context of Productive Development Policies 
(PDPs) that Costa Rica has put in place since 
the 1970s, one success story is the PDP to at-
tract FDI and promote exports. In this task 
there are three main actors: the Costa Rican 
Investment Promotion Agency (CINDE), 
PROCOMER (Promotora del Comercio Exte­
rior de Costa Rica), and the Ministerio de 
Comercio Exterior (COMEX). All three work 
in tandem to bring foreign direct investment 
to Costa Rica and promote exports. Collabo-
ration between CINDE and high levels of 
government, including the president, success-
fully brought Intel to Costa Rica in 1996 (box 
4.1). By streamlining processes and facilitat-
ing the removal of bottlenecks for multina-
tional companies in the FTZs, these agencies 

were able to contribute to the development of 
high-tech manufacturing and the country’s 
status as an attractive FDI location.
Trade liberalization and FDI have made 
Costa Rica stand out for its vibrant high-tech 
and ICT sectors. Agricultural production 
now accounts for a little over five percent of 
GDP, compared to 13 percent in the early 
1980s. Moreover, the service sector’s share of 
GDP has increased, becoming the main sec-
tor of the economy. The share of the manu-
facturing sector in GDP has stagnated at 
about 22  percent in the past 25 years. At the 
same time, the employment share of manu-
facturing decreased from 25 percent to 12 
percent.12 As a result of attracting FDI in 
high-technology sectors, Costa Rica’s share 
of high-tech manufacturing and ICT exports 
is among the highest among upper-mid-
dle-income countries and Latin America 
(figure 4.12). These trends suggest a fast 
transformation of the economy into sectors 
in which Costa Rica had a competitive 
advantage.
The economy contributes to a number 
of global value chains and has been able to 
upgrade its product mix over time. Some 
examples are electronics, medical devices, 
auto motive, aeronautic/aerospace, film/
broad casting devices, and offshore ser-
vices.13 During the 1990s the profile of new 
companies shifted from a focus on electri-
cal assembly to electronics. The product 
mix for medical devices is complex and so-
phisticated, including products in the areas 
of optics, dental, cardiovascular, and breast 
implants. Over time, many firms operating 
in the medical device cluster have vertically 
integrated, received raw materials, and 
 performed different activities in the value 
chain (sustaining engineering, process de-
velopment) (figure 4.13). In the case of

intel and Development of the High-Tech Sector in Costa Rica

In 1996, Intel, the world’s largest computer chip maker, announced plans for the 
establishment of its US$300 million semiconductor assembly and test plant in Costa 
Rica. The country’s economic and political stability, its proximity to the United States, 
and its pro-business environment were all important. Some bottlenecks in Costa Rica’s 
investment climate raised some concerns, however, such as inadequate supply of skilled 
labor, infrastructure and logistics (airport upgrades), tax incentives, and improvements 
in permits and construction processes.a The country’s tertiary educational system was 
strengthened with the introduction of a series of programs to increase both the 
number of graduates with engineering and technical degrees and the proficiency of the 
graduates.b The stock of graduates from engineering programs in Costa Rica reportedly 
increased by almost 40 percent between 2002 and 2011.c CINDE also worked with 
existing investors to “back link” potential suppliers—both local, through the Costa 
Rica PROVEE program, and foreign—of products and services that transcended 
sectors, identifying commonalities between medical devices and electronics in their 
procurement of clean room services, plastics, and metal mechanics.d
Intel contributed to the development of the high-tech sector through three channels: (i) it 
had a direct impact on employment, investment, trade, output, and the development of 
the technology cluster ; (ii) it served as a catalyst for repositioning Costa Rica as an attrac-
tive investment location, through its impact on the country’s technical education, incen-
tives laws and regulations, and infrastructure;e and (iii) it increased the confidence of 
foreign investors through the demonstration effect. Intel’s decision to invest in Costa Rica 
gave a “signaling effect” that helped solidify the country’s emergence as an attractive desti-
nation for FDI in high-tech manufacturing. Companies that followed Intel in establishing 
manufacturing and global service operations in Costa Rica included Abbott Laboratories 
(now Hospira), Procter & Gamble (P&G), and Hewlett Packard.
In April 2014, Intel announced its decision to close its Costa Rican microchip assembly fac-
tory and move its assembly operations to China, Malaysia, and Vietnam. While all micro-
chip assembly operations will move to Asia, Intel will keep its engineering and design 
departments and its global service center in Costa Rica, a move that showcases Costa Rica’s 
competitiveness in high value- added segments. It is unclear what the repercussions will be 
of Intel’s decision to leave because Costa Rica’s high-tech exports have become increasingly 
diversified. As it has in the past, Costa Rica will need to strategically position itself and capi-
talize on its strengths to continue to attract FDI and increase job creation.

aeronautics, firms are focusing on higher- 
value service activities—such as software 
and design and engineering—and their 
product mix has upgraded as well.14
Not only have exports tilted towards 
higher value-added sectors but they have 
also become more diversified, minimizing 

exposure to weather or other shocks. With 
its integration into the global value chain of 
medical devices, the country has been able 
to survive the phasing out of Intel’s manu-
facturing plant. Exports of medical devices 
have grown at an average annual rate of 12 
percent in the last decade (from US$0.55 

74 

The Nature of Costa Rica’s Growth and Its Constraints

 
 
billion in 2004 to US$1.9 billion in 2014), 
while electronics grew at four percent per 
year on average. The product mix in the 
medical device cluster is complex and so-
phisticated, including products in the areas 
of optics, dental, cardiovascular, and breast 
implants. With its increas ingly diversified 
agricultural portfolio (bananas, pineapples, 
coffee, and agroindustry), agricultural ex-
ports have been shielded from wide swings 
due to weather and diseases (figure 4.14a). 
Business services (mainly ICT related) ac-
count for almost half of all service exports. 
Leading activities in this sector also in-
clude design and engineering, professional 

services, shared service centers (for exam-
ple, back-office services for one company, 
including accounting, finance, procurement, 
and human resources), business  process 
outsourcing (to a lesser extent), architec-
ture, and digital animation (figure 4.14b).
However, backward linkages from mul-
tinational corporations (MNCs) to local 
companies remain weak. On average, local 
suppliers provide only 24 percent of inputs 
to MNCs in Costa Rica.15 Other studies cite 
that this percentage is even lower, at one 
percent of MNCs’ inputs. Less than 20 
 percent of inputs sourced locally were in-
corporated in MNCs’ exports, indicating

that the inputs are likely of low value and 
not central to the value chain.16 Locally 
sourced products are largely low valued- 
added products and services such as pack-
aging, printing materials, and services (for 
instance, cleaning and security).17 However, 
there is tangible demand for increased 
local sourcing by MNCs. Of the MNCs in-
terviewed by the World Bank in 2014, 93 
percent declared an interest in local pro-
curement, and 40 percent claimed to have 
a supplier development program already in 
place. Local firms face difficulties in com-
plying with MNCs’ requirements, such as 
quality standards, delivery times, or up-
grading of technical capabilities. Moreover, 
local small and medium enterprises may be 
deterred from seeking business with MNCs 
due to the uncertainty around the process 
of upgrading their operations.18 The gov-
ernment’s programs to support backward 
linkages have had some tangible results, al-
though these are quite small. The programs 
have insufficient scale and scope to signifi-
cantly influence the development of pro-
ductive linkages between domestic SMEs 
and MNCs.19
Although backward linkages may be 
small, the presence of MNCs has had posi-
tive spillovers through knowledge transfers. 
One venue for these knowledge spillovers is 
through labor movement from MNCs to 
local companies. A recent study for Costa 
Rica finds a positive spillover generated by 
the movement of workers from MNCs to 
local firms. Former workers of MNCs create 
new firms with lower mortality rates or 
boost firm performance for their new local 
employer.20 By inducing skill upgrades and 
changes in education programs, the pres-
ence of MNCs have also benefit local firms 
(box 4.1).

Capitalizing on protected areas

Costa Rica has successfully capitalized 
on its environmental policies and Green 
Trademark, by embracing and developing 
a sustainable tourism industry.21 In 2013, 
close to 2.5 million tourists visited the 
country. This implies that the number of 
visitors per capita (at around 0.5) is above 
popular destinations in the Caribbean 
basin such as Mexico (0.2) or the Domini-
can Republic (0.38). While sun-and-beach 
tourism clearly is part of Costa Rica’s at-
tractions, eco- tourism (an area where it has 
been a  pioneer) is also very popular, with 
many travelers visiting the national parks 
and protected areas. Moreover, the country 
ranked sixth in the region and 47th overall 
according to the 2013 Travel and Tourism 
Competitive Index compiled annually by 
the World Economic Forum to measure the 
factors that make a destination attractive 
for the travel and tourism industry. Costa 
Rica’s large and mature ecotourism indus-
try has earned it a reputation as a top 
 ecotourism destination in the world. The 
tourism industry is one of Costa Rica’s 
main sources of foreign exchange (14.2 
percent of total exports in 2013); its direct 
share in GDP was 4.6 percent in 2013 (the 
indirect share was 12.1 percent), and it 
contributed directly 4.6 percent of total 
employment (indirectly, it contributed 11.5 
percent).22 The tourism sector comprises a 
diverse set of operators (hotels, airlines, 
transportation companies, restaurants, etc.) 
that work together. Costa Rica’s main at-
tributes for tourists are its beautiful na-
tional parks, pleasant climate, and social 
and economic achievements.23 Although its 
infrastructure has deficiencies, it has been 
able to sustain the accelerated growth of 
the industry since the 1980s. Currently, a 

76 

The Nature of Costa Rica’s Growth and Its Constraints

sector-wide traveler tax is used for interna-
tional promotion of the Costa Rican “brand,” 
which prevents free riding and ensures that 
marketing for the country is well funded.
The tourism sector is well organized, with 
a strong public-private collaboration where 
incentives are aligned. The sector is orga-
nized around two umbrella organizations: 
the Costa Rican Chamber of Hotels (CCH), 
a very influential organization regrouping 
the largest hotel chains (and several smaller 
hotels), and the National Chamber of Tour-
ism (CANATUR), where tourism-related 
businesses are represented (travel agencies, 
hotels, restaurants, etc.). The Costa Rican 
 Institute for Tourism (CR-ICT) is the auton-
omous public institution in charge of setting 
tourism policy. The board of directors of the 
CR-ICT has a good balance of political ap-
pointees and representatives of the industry, 
and the CEO of CR-ICT often comes from 
the tourism private sector. Over time CR-
ICT has adopted the role of promoter of pri-
vate sector development, coordinator of 
sectoral dialogue, and administrator of tour-
ism development incentives.24 Key elements 
in the successful relationship between these 
three bodies are their strong complementa-
rity, the consultative approach to developing 
policy (there is a continuous dialogue be-
tween the private and public sector), and the 
alignment of incentives (to maintain the 
Green Trademark).

Competitiveness 
Challenges

Increasing production costs 
weaken Costa Rica’s competitiveness. For 
many years, the attraction of strategic for-
eign investment relied on the country’s 
unique combination of location close to 

large markets, educated labor force, and po-
litical stability.25 According to the latest 
Global Com pet itiveness report, the country 
scored well for health and primary educa-
tion, higher education and training, tech-
nology readiness, and innovation potential, 
and this contributed to Costa Rica’s being 
ranked as the third most competitive econ-
omy in Latin America, behind Panama and 
Chile. However, other countries in the re-
gion and beyond have caught up in terms of 
stability and education of their labor force. 
In contrast, Costa Rica’s education system 
has not adapted to provide the skills needed 
for the changing economy. Private firms 
perceived that rising costs are affecting their 
operations (41  percent), with ones in the ag-
ricultural (62 percent) and manufacturing 
(50 percent) being the most affected.26 The 
cited factors for rising production costs are 
electricity (24 percent), fuel prices (17 per-
cent), and salaries (13 percent).
Competitiveness pressures are not new : 
private firms have reported these invest-
ment climate obstacles for many years. The 
World Economic Forum, which carries out 
yearly surveys to construct its index of 
global competitiveness, has asked business 
executives to identify the most problematic 
factors for doing business. For Costa Rica 
in 2014, the top five areas were inefficient 
government bureaucracy (27 percent), in-
adequate supply of infrastructure (24 per-
cent), access to financing (11  percent), 
corruption (eight percent), and restrictive 
labor regulations (eight percent). These 
areas are very similar to the ones identified 
seven years ago.27 The World Bank Enter-
prise Surveys (WBES) also provides data 
on the perception of the private sector on 
growth. In 2010, the latest survey, the top 
five problem areas were access to finance 

The Nature of Costa Rica’s Growth and Its Constraints 

77

(26 percent), practices of informal sector 
(23 percent), inadequately educated work-
force (13 percent), business licenses and 
permits (nine percent), and labor regula-
tions (five percent).
These investment climate constraints do 
have a harmful effect on firms’ productiv-
ity. Using objective indicators of invest-
ment climate constraints, Fajnzylber et al. 
(2009) find that improvements in regula-
tory compliance would have the most ben-
eficial  impact on the productivity of Costa 
Rican firms.28 With an expected contribu-
tion ranging from 61 to 72 percent depend-
ing on the benchmark selected, the regu  
latory compliance captures the effect of 
regulation and institutional quality and is 
proxied by sales declared for tax purposes 
and external audits. Governance indicators, 
proxied by bribes, crime losses, and secu-
rity costs, rank second, contributing be-
tween 19 to 22  percent of the productivity 
increase. Infrastructure quality, which is 
proxied in this analysis by firms’ losses 
caused by electricity outages, explains be-
tween one and 10 percent of the productiv-
ity increase.
Moreover, these constraints affect overall 
growth rates. Cross-country growth regres-
sions have been used to identify statistically 
and economically significant determinants of 
growth rates. While these regressions are not 
without their limitations,29 they provide useful 
information on counterfactual estimates on 
the potential impact on growth due to improve-
ment of different investment climate areas. 
Two recent studies are of interest to bench-
mark Costa Rica’s  economic growth: (i) Araujo 
et al (2014) studies economic growth in Latin 
American and the Caribbean for 1970–2010, 
updating the work of Loayza, Fajnzylber, & 
Calderón (2005); and (ii) Swiston and Barrot 

(2011) examine the role of structural reforms 
in raising economic growth in Central Amer-
ica for 1960–2009.30 Benchmarking Costa Rica 
against top performers in LAC, Araujo et al. 
(2014) found the largest effects on per capita 
GDP growth from lowering inflation, increas-
ing financial depth, increasing trade openness, 
improving infrastructure, and improving the 
education level of the workforce.31 When Costa 
Rica is benchmarked against OECD countries, 
the largest effects on growth will come from a 
better road  infrastructure, greater financial 
depth, lowering inflation, improving the edu-
cation level of the workforce, and increasing 
trade openness. The magnitude of the estimated 
effects suggests that per capita GDP growth 
could have been two to 14  percent higher, pro-
viding an indication of forgone growth and its 
potential impact on poverty reduction. Swis-
ton and Barrot (2011) conclude that structural 
reforms in the financial sector (particularly 
improvement in bank supervision and devel-
opment of domestic security markets) and in 
product markets (agriculture liberalization, 
flexibility in electricity [independent regulator 
and wholesale market], and telecommunica-
tions with private participation) could raise 
growth by about two percentage points. In fact, 
Costa Rica has already  undertaken a major re-
form in telecommunications, which has con-
tributed positively to economic activity.
Furthermore, competitiveness challenges 
could affect Costa Rica’s strong track record 
for attracting FDI. The exit of Intel from its 
manufacturing operations, foreign investors’ 
growing shift towards service functions, and 
increasing competition from other countries 
for FDI mean that Costa Rica cannot lag be-
hind in its capacity to upgrade the areas that 
are important to continue to attract FDI and 
maximize their spillover into the local econ-
omy. A study of five global value chains 

78 

The Nature of Costa Rica’s Growth and Its Constraints

highlights areas that could strengthen their 
growth, such as increasing the supply of 
skilled labor.
The consequences of these competitiveness 
challenges have become more evident after the 
global crisis. These challenges are the result of 
several forces: monetary and exchange rate 
policies that have resulted in an appreciation 
of the exchange rate, an education system that 
is not generating enough graduates demanded 
by the high-technology sectors, inadequate 
supply and quality of infrastructure, and pub-
lic sector administration that has not evolved 
quickly enough to respond to the change of 
the economy. Addressing them will be impor-
tant to preserve Costa Rica’s competitive edge.

Exchange rate appreciation

Although inflation has dropped to single 
digits since the global crisis, the real effective 
exchange rate has appreciated, negatively af-
fecting Costa Rica’s international competi-
tiveness (figure 4.15).32 Domestic inflation 

persistently above that of the United States 
(its major trading partner) and large capital 
inflows put appreciating pressure on the ex-
change rate. The real effective exchange rate 
(REER) index appreciated by 12.3  percent in 
2011–13, negatively affecting Costa Rica’s in-
ternational competitiveness. During that pe-
riod, the Central Bank of Costa Rica (BCCR) 
actively intervened in the foreign exchange 
market, buying foreign currency to keep the 
exchange rate above the lower end of the tar-
get range. As a result, net international re-
serves rose from US$4.8  billion at end-2011 
to US$7.3 billion at end-2013. The BCCR 
sterilized the resulting monetary expansion 
with domestic bonds, which pay a substan-
tially higher interest than the returns it gets 
on international reserves. Consequently, in 
2013, the BCCR quasi-fiscal deficit rose to 
0.9 percent of GDP, and its debt stood at 
about 10  percent of GDP.
Greater exchange rate flexibility could 
have several advantages for the country. 
In early 2015, the BCCR abandoned the

exchange rate band, allowing more flexibility 
to the exchange rate, as part of its transition 
to inflation targeting. Allowing pressures 
on the external position to be absorbed by 
the exchange rate would facilitate facing ex-
ternal shocks and could help prevent a sud-
den drop in reserves. Changes in world 
prices would be transmitted more directly 
to the local economy, thereby aligning in-
centives to changing international condi-
tions. Further, as both creditors and debtors 
perceive higher risk regarding the direction 
and magnitude of exchange rate fluctua-
tions, the new exchange rate regime could 
lead to a gradual de-dollarization of the 
economy.33

High wages and mismatch of 
skills and jobs

Relatively high wages have made Costa Rica 
less viable in low value-added sectors. High 

income levels, coupled with generous social 
benefits, have resulted in high reservation 
wages across the board. Figure 4.16 plots 
hourly wages (in constant 2001 US Dollars) 
between 2000 and 2012 in two sectors that 
traditionally employ low-skilled workers: 
agriculture (primary sector) and low-tech 
industry (light manufacturing) for Central 
American countries and Chile (one of Costa 
Rica’s structural peers). Except for Chile, 
Costa Rica displayed the highest wages in 
these sectors over the period 2000–2012.34 
After 2006, the gap in real wages between 
Costa Rican workers and the others started 
to widen, but it did even more so after 2010, 
partly attributed to the appreciation of the 
real effective exchange rate. Textile exports 
have dropped dramatically from 13.3 per-
cent of exports in 2000 to 1.6 percent in 
2014, mainly attributed to high production 
costs in Cost Rica in relation to neighboring 
countries.

The Nature of Costa Rica’s Growth and Its Constraints

 
 
 
 
Changing patterns in FDI and trade 
have created excess demand for high skills, 
putting upward pressure on the salaries of 
high-skilled workers.35 Most of the reduc-
tion in jobs comes from sectors that tend 
to employ low-skilled workers (figure 3.2), 
such as agriculture and construction. It is 
precisely in these sectors where job creation 
has been minimal or even negative in the 
last six years (figure 4.17). At the other end 
of the spectrum, sectors that employ mostly 
skilled workers, such as financial services, 
real estate, personal services, and others, 
are growing fast (though from a low base in 
the case of sectors such as utilities or finan-
cial services).
As such, returns to education have in-
creased along with inequality in Costa Rica in 
the 2000s, in contrast to trends in most other 
LAC countries. In much of the region, the re-
turns to higher levels of education began to 
fall in the 1990s—and continued during the 
2000s—as more students achieved higher 

levels of education. This decline in the returns 
to education contributed in part to the his-
toric fall in inequality in many LAC countries 
over the past 15 years.36 Costa Rica’s path has 
been different from the rest of the region, for 
trends both in inequality and in the returns 
to education. Specifically, in Costa Rica, the 
returns to education fell during the 1980s 
(over a decade before similar patterns emerged 
in the region), thus contributing to a reduc-
tion in inequality during that period.37 How-
ever, contrary to LAC, the returns to education 
remained roughly constant during the 1990s 
and early 2000s in Costa Rica, and they 
started to rise again after 2007. Thus, the pre-
mium for having completed secondary edu-
cation rose by 11 percentage points between 
2007 and 2013 and by six percentage points 
for those with any tertiary education (figure 
4.18). This is consistent with a pattern of 
skill-biased technological change, which gen-
erates relatively more skilled occupations, a 
phenomenon also documented in a study of

the evolution of occupations over the last two 
decades, and which shows that Costa Rica 
has followed a pattern of changes in occupa-
tions similar to high- income countries.38
And yet, the workforce is not well 
adapted to the current needs of the labor 
market, creating a deficit of workers with 
the skills demanded by the fastest growing 
sectors. Indeed, less than half of the cohort 
25–29 years old (42.3 percent) had achieved 
a secondary or higher education by 2010, 
which is worrisome for a country that aims 
for a structural shift into “new economy” 
sectors. In turn, the higher education sys-
tem is biased towards social sciences and 
does not sufficiently generate graduates 
with the skills  demanded, such as basic sci-
ence and engineering ( figure 4.19).39 In 
other words, students still prefer to study 
careers that had growing demand during 
the 1980s and 1990s, rather than those that 

have high demand (and growing wages) 
today.40 The technology sectors, in particu-
lar, are affected by the relatively small 
skilled labor force. For example, a study of 
skills needs in network technology esti-
mates that the gap between demand and 
supply of skilled labor in Costa Rica in 
2011 was 36 percent, and for 2015 this gap 
was projected to expand to 48 percent; the 
worst among the eight Latin American 
countries included in the study.41 Another 
study by the Costa Rican Chamber of Tech-
nology of Information and Communications 
(Cámara de Tecnologías de Infor mación y 
Comunicaciones) showed that, in 2008, the 
country had lost an estimated US$72 mil-
lion, as a consequence of the lack of techni-
cians and professionals in this area. The 
technology sector is not the only one af-
fected by this trend: CANATUR (Costa Rican 
Chamber of Tourism), called attention to a

shortage of human capital in the tourism 
industry.
Moreover, regulatory procedures do 
not facilitate the recognition of foreign de-
grees, which could help to fill the skills gaps. 
The norms that govern the recognition of 
qualifications, particularly the Regulations 
Governing Article 30 of the Agreement for 
Higher Education Coordination of State 
Universities, were defined in 1986 and have 
not been updated. Institutional arrange-
ments are also fragmented: academic qualifi-
cations and university degrees are evaluated 
by the various higher education institutions 
that form CONARE (Consejo Nacional de 
Rectores, National Council of Rectors), while 
those granted by other kinds of higher edu-
cation institutions (para- university institu-
tions) are evaluated by the Council for 
Higher Education. Although CONARE has 
defined common criteria for the documents 

needed for recognition, requirements for ob-
taining recognition and equivalency may 
vary depending on the institution carrying 
out the evaluation. There is no unified proce-
dure for presenting appeals against adverse 
decisions.
The difficulties created by this fragmented 
and outdated system can result in denial of 
work authorizations for otherwise qualified 
workers with foreign degrees. Thus, Costa 
Rica has obstacles to either “produce” or “im-
port” the high skills needed to sustain its 
high value-added growth model. Regulations 
and procedures should be updated and uni-
fied, in line with international criteria; and 
measures should be taken to facilitate ac-
creditation, adoption of a list of institutions 
with established quality, and efficient pro-
cessing of “similar cases” whereby applicants 
have similar titles, degrees, and qualifications 
as previous candidates.

Infrastructure: 
telecommunications, transport, 
and electricity

Infrastructure coverage and access are rela-
tively good. Over several decades of invest-
ment, the country built an extensive network 
of highway and feeder roads, electric power 
grids, and telecommunication system in the 
context of the “Social Compact” that also put 
an emphasis on providing universal access to 
infrastructure services that would improve the 
wellbeing of the population.42 Costa Rica has 
two times the road and three times the rail 
density of the average middle-income country 
and is behind only Lithuania and the OECD 
on these indicators (figure 4.20). Access to 
electricity in rural areas and mobile services is 
nearly universal. The liberalization of the tele-
communication sector allowed for fast growth 
in access to mobile and broadband services.43 
The vast coverage of infrastructure has histori-
cally supported Costa Rica’s trade and growth 
and standards of living.
The overall quality of infrastructure is 
low compared to structural peers. Figure 
4.21a shows the World Economic Forum 
Index on the overall quality of infrastruc-
ture, showing that Costa Rica has the worst 
ranking. This low ranking is mainly attrib-
uted to the poor quality of ports, roads, and 
railways (figure 4.21b).

Telecommunications. Despite progress 
in the coverage of telecommunication ser-
vices, areas outside the Free Trade Zones 
(FTZs) and in protected areas have lower 
access, creating regional disparities in com-
petitiveness for local f irms. Between 2008 
and 2012, the percentage of households 
with a cellphone increased from 69 percent 
to 97 percent.44 During the same period, 

the percentage of households with Internet 
access increased from 15 percent to 47 
percent; however, it is still highly concen-
trated in the Central region, with much 
lower access in areas with higher poverty 
rates or with indigenous populations (top 
row of f igure 4.22). Interesting ly, cantons 
that have Free Trade Zones (FTZs) have on 
average better cellphone and Internet pen-
etration (bottom row of f igure 4.22) than 
cantons with no FTZ. Internet access in 
cantons with FTZs is 15 percentage points 
higher than in cantons without them (42 
percent versus 27 percent, respectively). 
Similarly, cell phone use is f ive percentage 
points higher in cantons with FTZs (ICT 
and quality broadband are required in the 
high-tech sectors which predominate in 
the FTZs).45 At the other extreme, cantons 
with Protected Areas, which attract tour-
ists, have lower access than the rest.

Transport. Despite good access, the quality 
of transport services is deficient. On the two 
most widely used international rankings of 
transport service provision—the World 
Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness 
Index and the World Bank’s Logistics Perfor-
mance Index (LPI)—Costa Rica barely reaches 
the middle point among the 160–170 coun-
tries ranked, scoring below peer middle- 
income countries and well below the average 
OECD country. Costa Rica ranked 87th out of 
160 countries on the 2014 LPI, with a score of 
2.7 (figure 4.24). Costa Rica’s score is compa-
rable to the middle-income average but well 
below the OECD average of 3.7. The country’s 
mediocre ranking can be traced to poor 
perfor mance in customs and border clear-
ance,46 but also to poor quality of transport in-
frastructure, particularly in infrastructure that 
concerns port services. Costa Rica’s score and

rank on the quality of its port infrastructure is 
the lowest among middle-income peers, scor-
ing a 3.0 on port quality and ranking 115th out 
of 160 countries (figure 4.21b). A bit more 
promising is the air transport quality in which 
Costa Rica scores 4.6 and ranks 61st (out of 
160). The results for transport quality are sim-
ilarly poor on the WEF’s competi tiveness 
index. Costa Rica scores about 40 percent of 
the maximum score of seven points on the in-

dex’s user assessment of road and port quality 
(with scores of 2.8 and 3.0, respec tively). This 
score puts the country behind the perfor-
mance of similar middle-income countries 
(which average 3.5 to 3.7) and very far from 
the infrastructure services delivered in the av-
erage OECD country (5.2 to 5.3). In contrast 
to other countries, Costa Rica has not made 
progress in its connectivity with global ship-
ping networks.

Weak road and port infrastructure cause 
major losses and delays in land and sea 
transport.47 An extreme example of poor 
road quality comes from rural routes serving 
the pineapple industry. On the trip from 
farm to distribution center, product losses 
can be 50 percent larger than for the much 
longer trip from Costa Rica to Rotterdam.48 
Costa Rica also performs at the bottom of 
the middle-income group in quality of its 
port infrastructure, with a score of 3.0, and 
ranking 115th out of 160. A salient illustra-
tion is the Port of Limón. Responsible for 
most of Costa Rica’s maritime traffic, the 
port has very low productivity and long de-
lays: the median time between a ship’s port 
arrival and its dock arrival is more than 15 
hours, compared to a normally acceptable 
range of five hours.49
Not surprisingly, firms in FTZs tend to 
rely more intensively on air transport—which 
is more efficient than ports in Costa Rica. In 
value terms, about two-thirds of FTZs’ ex-
ports are shipped via air transport, which is a 
more expensive but faster transport mode. 

Air transport becomes attractive and cost- 
effective as a modal alternative when goods 
are highly perishable or, more important, 
when value added is over a certain threshold. 
And although ports in Costa Rica have the 
worst rating in the region, the air transport 
market appears to be competitive for LAC 
standards.50 In fact, air transport quality in 
Costa Rica scores 4.6 and ranks 61st out of 
160 in the LPI (figure 4.21b).

Electricity. Electricity tariffs have in-
creased significantly in recent years, affect-
ing production costs. Between 2007 and 
2013, the real industrial electric tariff in-
creased from eight to 20 US cents per kWh 
(figure 4.25). Industrial and commercial 
electricity tariffs are competitive relative to 
the rest of Central America but high rela-
tive to other competitors with larger mar-
kets, such as China, Mexico, and the 
United States.
The rise in electricity tariffs originates 
from a combination of factors due to the en-
ergy mix and governance issues of the sector.

First, due to its high reliance on hydropower 
generation, the power sector is particularly 
vulnerable to rainfall variability. Hydropower 
output has been increasingly variable over 
the past decade due to successive dry years, 

and the country has struggled to meet de-
mand with renewable energy sources.51 Be-
tween 2000 and 2013, the share of  thermal 
generation increased from one percent to 12 
percent, raising the short-run marginal cost

of generation due to high fuel cost. Thus, the 
transition path toward a carbon neutral econ-
omy has been a major challenge: in the last 
two years, existing thermal generation capac-
ity has been dispatched during the entire 
year. The cost of thermal generation is influ-
enced by oil prices and by expensive thermal 
generation leasing agreements. Fuel expendi-
tures are now reflected in the tariff.52 Second, 

although technical losses in transmission and 
distributions are low (10  percent) compared 
to other countries, ICE’s operating perfor-
mance could be improved (figure 4.26). With 
197  customers per employee, ICE (Instituto 
Costarricense de Electricidad, Costa Rican 
Electricity Institute) is the worst performer 
among regional peers (Colombia, the Do-
minican Republic, Honduras, Panama, and 
Uruguay). Although there is not data avail-
able on the level of salaries and benefits pro-
vided to ICE’s employees, using data from the 
ENAHO the average central government to 
private sector wage premium was  estimated 
at 23 percent in 2012—and this premium was 
49 percent for other public sector entities (for 
example, state-owned enterprises).53 Third, 
high depreciation costs—due to an acceler-
ated depreciation schedule—have also in-
creased operational costs that result in higher 
electricity tariffs. For example, depreciation 
accounted for 17 percent of generation cost 
in 2013.54 Finally, ICE expanded its genera-
tion capacity through expensive leasing 
 arrangements that have led to higher opera-
tional costs and electricity tariffs. Although 
these arrangements allowed ICE to finance 
its generation expansion, they have carried 
higher interest costs and shorter maturity 
than other financing alternatives. These leas-
ing arrangements (alquileres) accounted for 
15.4 percent of operating costs in 2010–12 
and will increase to 19 percent in 
2013–2015.55
Indicators of service quality, such as wait-
ing periods for new connections and fre-
quency and duration of outages, are below 
those of its structural peers. This is particu-
larly troublesome because of Costa Rica’s in-
terest in developing high-tech industries for 
which highly reliable electricity is essential.

Surveys, private companies in Costa Rica re-
ported an average waiting period of 39 days 
for a new electricity connection, which is the 
highest in Central America and 17 days 
higher than the regional average. Although 

in terms of frequency of outages Costa Rican 
firms experience 1.3 outages in a typical 
month, this is higher than OECD countries 
(0.4), Panama (0.6), or Uruguay (0.2). A 
similar pattern is observed for the duration

of outages. To address quality problems, ICE 
offers agreements to businesses in which the 
quantity and quality of electricity supply are 
clearly indicated, and those businesses can 
finance ICE’s investments in exchange for 
lower tariffs.56
Sector governance is weak, resulting in 
bottlenecks that affect the overall operational 
and economic efficiency of the sector. The 
roles and responsibilities of ICE, ARESEP 
(Autoridad Reguladora de los Servicios Públi­
cos, Regulatory Authority of Public Services), 
and MINAE (Ministerio de Ambiente, En­
ergía y Telecomunicaciones, Ministry of Envi-
ronment, Energy, and Telecommunications) 
overlap in some areas, causing inefficient 
planning and policy formation outcomes. 
MINAE is currently developing the VII na-
tional energy plan with public consultations 
(“mesas de dialogo”). The key focus areas for 
the consultations are: energy efficiency, dis-
tributed generation, optimizing the electric-
ity matrix, and social and environmental 
issues. Costa Rica’s institutional framework 
may not be sufficiently flexible to respond to 
the strategic and expansion needs of the sec-
tor. ICE faces a significant financing gap 
(Costa Rica needs to invest over $8 billion in 
the energy sector over the next twenty years), 
but there is no clear plan on how to increase 
private sector participation to attract needed 
investment, especially considering the exist-
ing legal constraints. The corporate gover-
nance of ICE compares somewhat poorly 
with peer countries in Latin America (see 
box 4.2).
Expansion of the electricity supply is con-
strained by social-environmental restrictions, 
the capacity of ICE to finance new generation 
assets, and legal caps on private sector partici-
pation. The first challenge is how to address an 
increasing gap between the demand and supply 

of electricity with renewable sources only. 
Costa Rica will need to double its installed ca-
pacity in the next 20 years. A large hydro proj-
ect is under construction (Reventazon, 305 
MW) and will start operations in 2016–17, 
significantly contributing to increase the sys-
tem’s reserve margin. The project cost has 
been estimated at around US$1.4 billion, 
which at US$4.6 million per MW is on the 
high end of the range for new hydropower 
projects in Central America and clearly above 
global benchmarks. This much-needed capac-
ity is necessary to ensure the security of the 
country’s supply; however, the high capital 
cost will have an impact on the capital compo-
nents of the tariff (depreciation and return on 
assets). Indeed, investment costs could be fur-
ther reduced in future capacity additions if a 
competitive mechanism for granting hydro 
concessions and resulting electricity contracts 
was in place. Another large hydro project 
(Diquis, 700 MW) is confronting complex en-
vironmental and social issues.57 Expanding 
generation capacity with geo-thermal energy, 
which is not affected by rainfall variability and 
can be dispatched in base-load, will require 
handling environmental regulations with pro-
tected areas as most volcanos are in national 
parks. The second challenge is how to finance 
the large costs associated with any project. 
ICE’s capacity to issue new debt is limited to 
certain thresholds. The legal framework limits 
private sector participation through indepen-
dent power producers (IPP) and build-oper-
ate-transfer (BOT) schemes to no more than 
30 percent of installed capacity.

Addressing the infrastructure gap. 
The deficiencies in productive infrastruc-
ture raise concerns about the adequacy of 
the levels of spending and implementation 
capacity for infrastructure projects. Costa

Box 4.2 Corporate Governance of State-owned electric Utility iCe

The corporate governance of state-owned electric utility ICE was considered poor when 
evaluated in 2009 against five key components of corporate governance (legal soundness, 
board and CEO competitiveness, professional management, performance orientation, and 
transparency and disclosure). ICE ranked 10th in the aggregated “corporate governance 
index” when compared to a peer group of 13 state-owned enterprises (SOEs) operating in 
the Latin American region. ICE ranked 11th in the group, in terms of performance orienta-
tion (process of setting objectives, the instruments used to set objectives and their en-
forcement, and the authority that conducts the assessments). This is indeed one of the 
areas where ICE seems to be weak.

Rica has made significant efforts to in-
crease infrastructure investment since the 
structural freeze of investment imposed in 
the nineties but has not yet been able to 
 leverage significant private sector funds. 
After investing no public funds in infra-
structure throughout the 1990s, Costa Rica 

has recommitted to an investment pro-
gram. In fact, in 2012 Costa Rica invested 
the most in infrastructure as a percentage 
of GDP (5.47 percent) of any Latin American 
country.58 However, the vast majority of 
this investment is public sector spending: 
private participation represents only 10 

The Nature of Costa Rica’s Growth and Its Constraints 

91

 
percent of total spending ( figure 4.27). The 
necessity of continuing to invest in infra-
structure and the reality of fiscal con-
straints mean that Costa Rica must 
encourage more private sector participa-
tion in the construction and maintenance 
of its infrastructure. The lack of investment 
in maintenance is particularly acute in the 
road sector, where a cycle of underinvest-
ment leading to deterioration that requires 
still more resources has been created.59
Expenditure on public infrastructure is 
uneven across sectors, implementation is 
deficient, and expenditure has not been able 
to keep up with needed investments. Public 
investment has been dominated by the 
transport and energy sectors with increasing 
investment in telecommunications in recent 
years. Historically, investment in water and 

sanitation has been very low, but there has 
been a recent increase. Poor implementation 
of infrastructure projects also contributes to 
the large infrastructure gap.60 For example, 
the Legislative Assembly takes between 1.5 
to 2.2 years to approve external loans by the 
 Inter-American Development Bank (IDB). 
Also, of the $2,000 million in loans from 
multilateral institutions only 28 percent has 
been executed.61 Limited execution is also 
reflected in the contraction of 2.6 percent, 
while it grew in most sectors. A failure of in-
stitutions is also apparent in the roads sector 
where resources made available by multilat-
eral organizations have not been put to use 
because of inadequate management.
Infrastructure limitations and growing 
environmental challenges could affect fur-
ther expansion of the tourism industry. As

discussed earlier, the stock of infrastructure 
covers most of the country, protected areas 
still have coverage deficiencies, and in par-
ticular quality of infrastructure is low. 
Moreover, the growing urban population 
creates pressure on public services like 
waste management (solid and water), which 
do not comply with international standards 
for environmental sustainability. To make 
sure that green tourism can continue to 
grow in Costa Rica, it is necessary to coor-
dinate the efforts of a large number of pub-
lic actors, from infrastructure, health, 
training, and other institutions.

Business regulations

Business regulations and red tape also affect 
competitiveness. Costa Rica ranks poorly in 

many indexes of competitiveness (figure 
4.28): Doing Business 2015 (83rd out of 189 
countries), Protecting Investors (181st), En-
forcing Contracts (129th), Paying Taxes 
(121st), Starting a Business (118th), Getting 
Credit (89th), and Resolving Insolvency 
(84th). These rankings suggest issues to be 
addressed in order to improve firm produc-
tivity and unleash faster rates of economic 
growth. The complex organization of the 
government and lack of coordination among 
agencies produce lack of clarity regarding 
steps and agencies and time to process regu-
latory requirements. For example, when the 
telecommunication sector was liberalized, 
the new private entrants reported delays in 
installing their systems due to the slow ap-
proval of tower building permits by the

municipalities.62 Environmental, health, and 
construction are the areas mostly  affected by 
these factors.

Access to finance

Costa Rica’s financial system is highly dollar-
ized and dominated mainly by public banks, 
although the system has become more diversi-
fied in recent years. Dollarization is wide-
spread in Costa Rica. Forty-one percent of 
deposits and loans to the private sector were 
denominated in dollars at the end of 2014 (fig-
ure 4.29).63 Higher interest rates for loans in 
local currency and a stable exchange rate ex-
plain the attractiveness of borrowing in dol-
lars. The widespread dollarization of the 
economy adds vulnerability to the financial 

system and undermines the effectiveness of 
monetary policy since it operates on a smaller 
monetary base.64 Public banks account for 50 
percent of the system’s lending to the private 
sector, private banks’ share is 31.4 percent, and 
non-bank financial intermediaries (for exam-
ple, cooperatives, finance companies, and mu-
tualistas) represent about 19 percent of the 
total system’s credit to the private sector.
Credit to the private sector has grown 
slowly, and its level is below that for struc-
tural peers. Liberalization of the banking 
sector in the mid-1990s reignited credit, 
which grew from a low 18.5 percent in 1998 
to 32 percent in 2004 and 50 percent in 2013 
(figure 4.30). This level of financing is still 
low when compared to structural peers and 
OECD countries (figure 4.31).

Credit growth slowdown after the global 
crisis and its growth has been uneven 
across sectors. Credit growth accelerated in 
2014, reaching 17 percent as a result of the 
government having removed in August 
2013 the limits it had imposed at the begin-
ning of the year. Credit in foreign currency 
grew faster than in local currency, but that 
trend has so far been reversed in 2014 
when credit in local currency grew faster 
(figure 4.32). Growth in credit is uneven 
across different sectors of the economy. The 
area of highest growth within banks’ port-
folio is retail lending (consumer and hous-
ing), which averaged 52.6 percent of private 
credit in 2010–14, double the average in the 
1990s (25.7 percent). Lending for housing, 
services, and consumers have increased

their share of total credit ( figure 4.33). In 
contrast, the share of lending to agriculture 
and industries decreased in the past two 
decades to 4.4 percent in 2010–2014.
The penetration of financial services 
among firms and the population, especially 
the poor, is low. Costa Rican firms do not 
compare favorably in their use of banks to 
finance investments or working capital (22 
and 30 percent, respectively) when com-
pared to the Latin American average or 
structural peers (see figure 4.34). In the case 
of individuals, access to finance indicators 
are above regional peers; however, poorer 
segments (for example, the bottom 40 
 percent of income earners) of the Costa 
Rican population have much more limited 
access. According to the World Bank Finan-
cial Inclusion database from 2014 (Findex), 
65 percent of the Costa Rican population 

over the age of 15 has an account at a formal 
financial institution, well above the regional 
average of 51 percent. The gap in access be-
tween those in the bottom 40 percent of in-
come earners and the top 60 percent is only 
5 percentage points, about half than for the 
regional average.
The banking system has adequate levels 
of capitalization and asset quality. Accord-
ing to the Financial Soundness Indicators 
(FSIs), banks had a capital adequacy ratio 
of 16.2 percent in July 2014, well above in-
ternational standards. Non-performing 
loans (NPLs) stood at 1.7 percent, with 
high level of provisions. Profitability, mea-
sured as return on equity, was stable in 
2013/2014 at around eight percent, but 
lower than other countries in the region, 
such as Chile (21 percent) or Panama (15.6 
percent).

 3. The telecommunication sector attracted large 
FDI flows, produced a significant consumer 
surplus advantage from the reduction in 
prices and increase in Internet and cellular 
line access, increasing its contribution to GDP 
(World Bank, 2013a). New private telecommu-
nication companies and ICE contributed more 
to the value added in telecommunications, as 
they provided more services and added new 
clients, generating new revenues.

industrial policy regulation and initiating a 
gradual opening of the economy, it brought the 
fiscal situation under control by both increas-

revenue side, the value added tax rate was 

increased and the tax base broadened. On the 
expenditure side, most agricultural subsidies 
were eliminated, public sector salaries were 
frozen, and the public pension system was 
reformed. The colon became fully convertible, 
and a crawling peg policy was implemented to

 28. Using a pooled sample of more than 10,000 
firms from 16 Latin American countries, 
Fajnzylber et al. (2009) estimated the impact of 
objective indicators of investment climate con-
straints (governance and institutional quality ; 
infrastructure; access to finance; and education, 
skills, and technology) on firm performance 
indicators, such as labor productivity, total 
factor productivity, and wages. The authors 
benchmarked firm performance against five 
different scenarios: moving to Ireland’s invest-
ment climate, moving to Chile’s investment cli-
mate, the 75th percentile of the entire sample of 
firms, the 75th percentile within same industry 
and firm size, and the 75th percentile within 
same industry, firm size, and country.

 29. Some of the limitations of cross-country 
growth regression include: omitted variables, 
instruments used for the GMM estimation 
may be mis-specified, explanatory variables 
may not capture the structural or stabiliza-
tion policies that are most relevant, and risk of 
over-fitting the model. 
 30. These studies rely on cross-country regres-
sions, using five-year non-overlapping data, 
and generalized method of moments (GMM) 
estimators for dynamic models of panel data. 
The GMM estimation takes into account 
unobserved country-specific effects and the 
joint endogeneity of the explanatory variables 
(growth drivers) with the dependent vari-
able (economic growth) in a dynamic model 
of panel data. Araujo et al. (2014) use a sam-
ple of 126 countries and Swiston and Barrot 
(2011) use a sample of 79 countries. Araujo et 
al. (2014) classify the determinants of growth 
into structural and stabilization policies. 
Structural policies include education (human 
capital), financial depth, trade openness, gov-
ernment burden, infrastructure, and gover-
nance. Stabilization policies include measures 
of fiscal, monetary, and financial policies, such 
as price stability and real exchange rate over-
valuation. Swiston and Barrot (2011) use a set 
of structural indexes to gauge the extent of

 31. The analysis finds that, if Costa Rica were a 
top performance in government size (i.e., by 
having a smaller government, as measured 
by government consumption expenditure as 
a share of GDP), its GDP per capita would be 
12 percent higher. That is because the bench-
marking exercise, due to the estimated coeffi-
cients of the model, views government size as 
something negative to improve upon. However, 
one has to consider that Costa Rica may have 
large government consumption due to its social 
compact, allocating around 23 percent of GDP 
to public health and education.
 32. While the real exchange rate affects interna-
tional competitiveness, it is an endogenous 
variable, which the authorities can use only in 
the short term. In the longer term, competi-
tiveness is determined by the structural factors 
elaborated later in this chapter.

 33. The widespread dollarization of the economy 
adds vulnerability to the financial system and 
undermines the effectiveness of monetary pol-
icy, since it operates on a smaller monetary 
base. As of December 2014, forty-one percent 
of deposits and loans to the private sector were 
denominated in dollars.

The Nature of Costa Rica’s Growth and Its Constraints

5.  Sustainability of Costa Rica’s 
Development Model

The sustainability of its development model is at risk due to the deterioration of fiscal balances, tensions 
in the Social Compact, and various threats to the Green Trademark. The fiscal situation stands out as 
one of the most pressing development challenges facing Costa Rica. The recent deterioration stems from 
a combination of countercyclical measures undertaken during the crisis and structural forces. Without 
fiscal consolidation, the deficit could push public debt to unsustainable levels and threaten the country’s 
social and economic gains. Indeed, fiscal pressures, as well as rising inequality and increasing dissatis­
faction with social services, all combine to create tensions in the Social Compact. Costa Rica’s leader­
ship in environmental conservation faces the challenge of growing pressures on the use of resources and 
of urbanization. Changing economic incentives threaten the gains in reforestation, and the use of 
agro­chemicals is worrisome. Urbanization has increased energy use and air and water pollution, and 
the country has not developed a long­term plan to protect the environment from these threats. Finally, 
the current political landscape and institutional framework add an additional layer of complexity for 
approving and implementing key reforms needed to address these emerging challenges.

Fiscal Sustainability

The fiscal situation is arguably one of 
the most pressing development challenges fac-
ing Costa Rica. Growing deficits could push 
the public debt to unsustainable levels and 
constrain resources for public investment, so-
cial services, and environmental goals.

Fiscal deterioration since 
the global crisis: deficits and 
public debt

The fiscal situation has weakened substan-
tially since the global crisis, with the overall 
deficit of the Central Government growing 
to 5.6 percent of GDP in 2013, and surpass-
ing six percent in 2014 and projected to 
reach 6.5 in 2015 (figure 5.1). As a result, 
public debt has increased by 12 percentage 
points over the past five years, from 25 

percent of GDP in 2008 to 37 percent by 
2013, with projections of 63 percent by 2019 
unless corrective measures are implemented 
(Figure 5.1).1 A study by the IMF estimates 
that Costa Rica has to lower its primary def-
icit by 3.5 percent of GDP to achieve debt 
sustainability and by 4.5 percent of GDP to 
bring its debt ratio to the pre-crisis level.2
Fiscal deterioration after the global crisis 
is not unique to Costa Rica. figure 5.2 and 
figure 5.3 present the overall and primary 
deficits, respectively, of Costa Rica and of 
the structural peer countries. The fiscal bal-
ance worsens for all countries. However, al-
though Costa Rica was among the better 
performing countries before the crisis (third 
below Chile and Uruguay), after the crisis it 
was among the worst: its primary balance 
was only slightly smaller than Lithuania and 
Croatia, and its overall deficit was the sec-
ond largest of the group. 3

A consequence of weakening fiscal ac-
counts is the downgrading of Costa Rica’s 
 investment rating. In September 2014, Stan-
dard & Poor’s Ratings Services downgraded 
the country’s rating due to fiscal trends and 
the foreseen difficulties in passing a compre-
hensive tax reform that could put the debt 
on a sustainable path. The longer the delay to 
 address the fiscal deficit, the larger will be 
the adjustment needed to stabilize the public 
debt ratio and the potential impact on the 
poorer segments of the population.

The growing deficit: cyclical 
measures and structural forces

This recent fiscal deterioration stems from 
countercyclical measures undertaken during 
the crisis and structural forces. Moreover, 
countercyclical measures adopted during the 
crisis were structural, rather than temporary, 
further adding to existing rigidities in gov-
ernment finances and spending.
The set of policy actions taken to con-
front the g lobal economic crisis has long- 
lasting implications for f iscal accounts. As 
in many other countries, Costa Rica faced 
the g lobal crisis by implementing counter-
cyclical f iscal policies. This was welcomed, 
given the magnitude of the crisis and the 
f iscal space the countr y had at the time, 
because the primar y balance was positive 
and public debt was below 25 percent of 
GDP in 2008. However, unlike other coun-
tries, which implemented temporar y f iscal 
policies, Costa Rica adopted policies with 
long- lasting structural effects. Specif ically, 
it chose to implement steep, permanent in-
creases in public salaries in 2008–10, and 
the wage bill of the public sector continued 
to grow even after the crisis. Current trans-
fers also doubled to f ive percent of GDP. 

And revenues, which had increased steeply 
prior to the crisis, dropped back to average 
levels from 2000–05 (f igure 5.1).
Public sector wages are particularly high 
in Costa Rica, as compared with other coun-
tries and the private sector. The public sector 
wage policy adopted during the crisis aimed 
to increase salaries in the central government 
to the 50th percentile (known as the percentil 
50) of pay for similar jobs in the rest of the 
public sector. Originally intended to adjust 
the wages of some categories of public sector 
workers, it expanded throughout most enti-
ties of the central government as well as de-
centralized institutions.4 As such, the wage 
bill of the central government rose (increas-
ing from 5.5 percent of GDP in 2008 to 7.4 
percent in 2014), and the consolidated wage 
bill of the overall public sector expanded sig-
nificantly (climbing from seven percent of 
GDP to 10 percent in 2010). Public sector 
compensation is much higher in Costa Rica 
than in other countries, given its level of GDP 
and government revenues—and public sector 
wages are significantly higher than private 
sector wages, in particular for state-owned 
enterprises (SOEs) (figure 5.4 and  figure 5.5).
Another “big ticket item” on the expendi-
ture side is pensions. Costa Rica’s public pen-
sion system includes the main pension fund 
(Seguro de Invalidez, Vejez y Muerte), a non-
contributory social pension, and special pen-
sion regimes for teachers, civil servants, and 
the judiciary. The first two are managed by 
the Caja Costarricense de Seguro Social 
(CCSS), which also operates the universal 
health insurance system. Although the CCSS 
pension accounts are currently roughly bal-
anced, with aging and demographic pres-
sures they will likely face an imbalance in the 
foreseeable future. Even more pressing are 
the balances of the special pension regimes.

Over all government support to special pen-
sion regimes will cost Costa Rica about 59 
percent of (2012) GDP over the next four de-
cades.5 A recent study by the IMF projects 
that the special regime for the judiciary will 
start to run deficits very soon, and will de-
plete its assets by 2030; the special regime for 
the civil service is projected to run flat at 2.4 
percent of GDP through 2020, and will slowly 
diminish after that. Moreover, the special re-
gimes are far more generous than the CCSS 
regime, which raises the question of equity, 
apart from their burden on the fiscal ac-
counts.6 For instance, in 2012, the CCSS spent 
2.2 percent of GDP in general pension pay-
ments for 190,000 pensioners, against 2.6 
percent of GDP for 62,500 pensioners of the 
special regimes. And while the average annual 
pension of a retired worker of the general 
 system of the CCSS amounts to around 50 
percent of GDP per capita, the average pen-
sion of a retired civil servant is about 170 
percent of GDP per capita, and the average 
pension of a retired judge is about 270 percent 
of GDP per capita.
Managing expenditures is further compli-
cated by extensive rigidities built into the sys-
tem. These rigidities stem from the index ation 
of public sector wages and pensions, as well as 
numerous spending mandates. These include 
both constitutional expenditure mandates 
with out corresponding financing sources, as 
well as legally required expenditures.7 For ex-
ample, there is a constitutional mandate to in-
crease expenditures in education from six to 
eight percent of GDP. There are also legal 
mandates for allocations to municipalities, 
housing subsidies, earmarked taxes, wages, 
pensions, and interest payments on the debt. 
The sum total of all of these rigidities leaves 
the government with only five percent of the 
annual budget for strategic allocative decisions 

in any given year—and also limits its ability to 
control expenditures and the deficit. 8
Further, the budget process is fragmented 
and much of it is outside the control of the 
central government. Parliament approves 
only the budget of the central government, 
which represents about one-third of consoli-
dated public expenditures. The budgets of 
decentralized institutions, public enterprises, 
financial intermediaries, and de-concentrated 
entities is determined largely by their heads 
under budget caps and guidelines provided 
by the Ministry of Finance and subject to 
modification and monitoring by the Office 
of the Comptroller General (CGR).
Structural rigidities also prevail on the 
revenue side. Although overall revenue col-
lection is on par with upper-middle- and 
high-income countries, at around 22 percent 
of GDP, tax revenues are low (13.5 percent 
of GDP) and a large share of the remaining 
revenues are earmarked to autonomous pub-
lic institutions (such as social security con-
tributions for pensions and health insurance, 
which are managed by the CCSS). Moreover, 
since 1953, Parliament has approved 1,259 
tax exemptions, of which only 23 percent 
had a time limit. Further, nearly half of these 
exemptions have no clear definition of the 
tax that is exempted.9 The potential magni-
tude of these exemptions for revenues is 
quite large, amounting to 5.6 percent of GDP. 
Finally, the budgets of SOEs do not require 
Parliamentary approval, and SOEs do not 
publish data. In an attempt to address the sit-
uation, Congress approved a fiscal reform in 
2012, but it was deemed unconstitutional by 
the Supreme Court on the basis of proce-
dural irregularities.
In addition, coordination between fis-
cal, monetary, and exchange rate policy is lim-
ited. Fiscal policy has not been sufficiently 

106 

Sustainability of Costa Rica’s Development Model

coordinated with monetary policy, and the fis-
cal deficit is adding to inflationary pressures. 
The BCCR-stated objective is to move to a 
fully inflation-targeting system, and the recent 
measure of floating the exchange rate, aban-
doning the pre-defined bands, is a move in the 
right direction. It is expected that this policy 
change will reduce dollarization of the finan-
cial system, reducing a source of vulnerability.

Sustainability of the 
Social Compact

To ensure sustainability of the Social 
Compact, Costa Rica must confront the tri-
ple challenges of fiscal pressures on social 
spending, increasing dissatisfaction with pub-
lic services, and rising inequality. First, the 
deterioration of the fiscal system implies po-
tential tradeoffs among social goals—and the 
need for improved quality and efficiency of 
social spending. Second, increasing dissatisfac-
tion with the quality of health care symbolizes 
the numerous “cracks in the system” that are 
emerging in the delivery of public services. 
There is a sense that, although Costa Rica has 
achieved impressive “levels” of performance 
for many indicators (low poverty, life expec-
tancy, literacy), it is increasingly constrained 
on the “deltas” of adopting the changes 
needed to make the transition to a modern 
economy with an effective “Welfare State” in 
the context of demographic transition. Third, 
rising inequality has exposed disparities in 
the education system and the mismatch of 
skills and jobs, as well as the ineffectiveness of 
social transfers to redistribute income to com-
pensate for these inequities.

The long rise of social spending

Costa Rica’s Social Compact has deep his-
torical roots. The construction of the Social 

Compact goes back to Costa Rica’s early 
days as a coffee-producing economy of 
small landholders (see chapter 1). It was 
consolidated during the middle of the 20th 
century with the creation of the universal 
health and social security system Caja 
 Costarricense de Seguro Social (CCSS) in 
1941, the establishment of the Labor Code 
in 1942, the guaranteeing of public educa-
tion for all, and the 1949 Constitution, 
which mandated basic social rights (com-
plemented by extensive social welfare 
legislation).
This ambitious Social Compact has had the 
backing of high and rising social spending. 
With the abolition of the army, the country 
had more resources to invest in the provision 
of basic public and social services to the entire 
population. As a result, social spending started 
to rise in the 1950s, reaching over three 
percent of GDP by 1958 (figure 5.6). It then in-
creased steadily over the decades, reaching al-
most 10 percent by the end of the 1990s and 
20.8 percent by the end of the first decade of 
the 2000s. This is close to the average level 
spent by OECD countries,10 and significantly 
higher than Central American neighbors (fig-
ure 5.7). Investment in education was initially 
the highest category of social spending, but by 
the 1990s health and pensions had both sur-
passed education. In 2012, total social spend-
ing amounted to 20.8 percent of GDP, with 7.4 
percent for pensions, seven percent for health, 
5.3 percent for education, and 1.1 percent for 
social assistance.

universal ser vices such as health care. Uni-
versal access to the health care system has 
led to outstanding health outcomes for the 
population. The  countr y’s integrated and 
universal health care system, managed by 
the CCSS, has provided access to health 
care to the entire population, including the 
bottom 40 percent (figure 5.8). Universal 
health care has been a key factor in im-
proving key social indicators: life expec-
tancy in Costa Rica is 82 for women and 
above 77 for men, and child mortality is 
low (about half of the Latin American and 
Caribbean average). Institutional births are 
virtually universal and maternal mortality 
has fallen over the last 20 years, reaching 
levels that are less than half of the LAC 
average.

The country has also invested heavily in 
infrastructure, providing the population with 
universal access to electricity and water, and 
an extensive road network covers most of the 
country. Early on, Costa Rica built an exten-
sive network of infrastructure in nearly all 
productive service areas (water, sanitation, 
transport, electricity, and telecommunica-
tions), responding to strong social demand.11 
Access to electricity went from 40 percent of 
households in 1950 to 99 percent by 2013. Ac-
cess to improved water sources is also nearly 
universal, with 96 percent of households hav-
ing access to piped water and 92 percent with

lines increased dramatically, from 11 fixed 
telephone lines per 1000 inhabitants in 1950 
to 203 in 2012. Almost all households have 
access to a cell phone (94 percent, higher than 
the OECD average) and 50 percent to a fixed 
phone line in 2013.12 This large endowment 
of infrastructure has historically supported 
Costa Rica’s economic growth and standards 
of living.

Health care: increasing concerns 
about quality and sustainability

Overall health spending has continued to 
grow during the 2000s, raising concerns 
about sustainability. Between 2000 and 2010, 
total expenditure on health went from 6.5 
percent of GDP to 10.1 percent. By 2012, 
public expenditure was around seven percent 
of GDP.13 This is far higher than public health 
spending for countries of similar levels of 
development (figure 5.9), and it exceeds 

average public spending on health in OECD 
countries (which averages 6.2 percent of 
GDP).14
Moreover, recent increases in health 
spending have not been matched by gains in 
service delivery. Between 2005 and 2010, the 
CCSS experienced a rapid increase in spend-
ing without revenue growth, where 97 percent 
of the extra spending corresponded to an in-
crease in the number and salary of employees. 
This was not accompanied by an increase in 
productivity: estimates suggest that between 
2009 and 2011, average daily hospital produc-
tion dropped from 69 to 61 days, and the 
number of annual outpatient visits per profes-
sional declined from 758 to 654.15 Hence, re-
cent increases in spending have not translated 
into better services.
Health budget allocations do not take 
into account demographic and demand 
changes, and thus leads to inefficiency and 
inequality of care. Budget allocation for 
health facilities across the country is done on

the basis of historical allocation, instead of 
current needs stemming from demographic 
pressures and local morbidity patterns. As a 
result, the resources that health centers re-
ceive are disconnected from the resources 
they need, and this is leading to inequity in 
the capacity to deliver care.
Furthermore, the current organization of 
the system leads to increasing wait times and 
patient frustration. The demographic change 
in Costa Rica implies that as the population 
ages, chronic conditions—which are more 
costly to treat—will become more prevalent. 
Yet, the 3-level organization of healthcare 
(going back to the 1970s) is not well adapted 
to a growing number of patients with 
chronic conditions. Level-1 facilities are not 
equipped to deal with such patients, thus 
they refer them to level-2 or level-3 facilities, 
which also have to deal with more complex 
cases. This creates bottlenecks, whereas a 
more consolidated system would be able to 
deal with chronic cases (of low complexity).
Likewise, an outdated infrastructure and 
information management system lowers 
quality, and decreases transparency and effi-
ciency of resource management. The current 
health infrastructure does not reflect the 
high level of spending: Costa Rica is consid-
erably below the average of its peers both in 
density of hospital beds and medical staff, 
and a recent assessment by the CCSS found 
that only 26 percent of hospitals and clinics 
were in good or excellent condition.16 In ad-
dition, the information management system, 
which dates back to the 1970s, has not been 
adequately modernized, and as a result it is 
highly fragmented and information flows are 
very difficult. This hampers efficient resource 
management and lowers the accountability 
of the entire system (for example, most in-
formation systems, except clinical records in 

some health centers, are paper-based or at 
best spreadsheets not linked to aggregated 
databases).
As a result, private health costs are on the 
rise, and the perception of quality is declin-
ing. Between 1995 and 2010 the share of pri-
vate out-of-pocket spending has gone from 
23.5 percent to 31.9 percent (of total health 
spending). This has occurred in parallel to 
the aging of the country’s population, which 
has naturally increased the demand for health 
services. As a result, users of the CCSS face 
increasingly long wait times, in particular for 
surgery and specialized treatments. Not sur-
prisingly, patients who can afford private in-
surance policies often use them, not to pay 
for complementary services to those covered 
by the CCSS, but to get the same services 
with a preferential treatment. This lowers the 
transparency of the system, and generates in-
equities in access and quality of treatment, 
which in turn fuels patient dissatisfaction 
(figure 5.10).

Education: patterns of public 
spending versus the skills gap

Similarly, Costa Rica has historically spent a 
large share of GDP on education. During the 
sustained growth period between 1950 and 
1980, Costa Rica considerably expanded its 
investment in human capital, particularly in 
education. By the end of the 1950s, educa-
tion expenditure was over two percent of 
GDP, and by 1980 it had reached 4.4 percent.17 
The crisis of the early 1980s caused a sharp 
reduction in public spending across the 
board (figure 5.11); for example, education 
spending fell to 1.9 percent of GDP by 1982, 
and by 1990 it was still only at 3.3 percent of 
GDP, one percentage point below the spend-
ing share of 1980. Nonetheless, education

spending increased systematically over the 
1990s and 2000s, as the Assembly approved 
spending targets of six percent of GDP in 
1997 (reached by 2009) and eight percent of 
GDP in 2010 (projected to be reached by 
2018).18 These levels of public spending as a 
share of GDP are higher than the 5.4 percent 

of GDP spent by OECD countries on 
average.19
Education spending is in the “mid-range” 
between middle-income and high-income 
countries. Measuring education spending as a 
share of GDP is useful for assessing its trend 
over time, as well as its fiscal implications. 

112 

Sustainability of Costa Rica’s Development Model

 
 
However, when comparing with other coun-
tries, measuring per student spending as a 
share of GDP per capita allows us to take into 
consideration the country’s size and level of 
development.20 With this adjusted measure, 
Costa Rica spends relatively more than some 
LAC countries and even on par with some 
high-income countries (HICs) like Australia, 
the Republic of Korea, Israel, or Singapore, 
but relatively less than Brazil, Mexico, and 
all other OECD countries (figure 5.12). 
Moreover, compared to the high-performing 
Scandinavian countries, Costa Rica spends 
significantly less per student, even relative to 
its much smaller GDP per capita. As dis-
cussed earlier, this investment in education 
has translated into important achievements 
in terms of literacy and primary education 
attainment.
Costa Rica’s education expenditure favors 
primary and tertiary, against spending on 
secondary schooling. One-third of the 

budget goes to tertiary education ( figure 
5.13), which responds in part to the coun-
try’s pattern of growth and the shift towards 
high-skilled, high value-added sectors and 
also to the guaranteed allocation of the bud-
get that is granted to autonomous public 
universities. However, only 22 percent is al-
located to secondary education, despite the 
demographic transition (trending towards 
fewer younger children) and the large skills 
gap for completion of secondary education 
(with over half of young adults dropping out 
before completing high school, many of 
them as early as seventh grade, as discussed 
in chapter 3). Compared with other coun-
tries, both the share of public spending on 
secondary and spending per secondary-
school student are low for Costa Rica, given 
its level of development (figure 5.14).
As a result of high dropout rates at the 
secondary level, public spending in educa-
tion becomes regressive at higher levels.

Given that a larger share of children from 
lower-income households drop out of sec-
ondary education, those who remain en-
rolled in the system and eventually access 
tertiary education tend to come from mid-
dle- and upper-class households. As figure 
5.15 shows, spending in tertiary education 
goes mostly to upper-income quintiles, in 
contrast to spending in primary, which is 
more heavily directed to lower-income quin-
tiles. Given that tertiary education is allo-
cated 32 percent of the total education 
budget, the result is a regressive system 
where most Costa Rican households are sub-
sidizing the education of a minority of well-
off children.21
Given fiscal constraints, rising inequal-
ity, and the mismatch of skills and jobs, 
Costa Rica needs to increase the efficiency 
of spending with a focus on improving 

quality and completion rates. As discussed 
in chapter 3, the low results in school attain-
ment and quality are worrisome, given the 
high share of spending on public education 
and the shift in labor demand towards high- 
skilled labor. Thus, the solution is not to 
spend more, but to spend better, by increas-
ing the efficiency of spending to achieve 
better results. Some reform options are 
dis cussed in chapter 6.

Social protection: not so 
effective for reducing poverty 
or inequality

Social protection spending, which includes 
social security and social assistance, is high 
by regional standards. Between 2007 and 
2012 social protection spending rose from 
7.3 percent of GDP to 8.5 percent of GDP 
(left panel of figure 5.16). This is less than 
what is spent in OECD countries (which 
average 12.3 percent on old age and work-
ing age benefits),22 and is considerably 
higher than in neighboring countries, such 
as El Salvador (5 percent), Honduras (6.1 
percent) or Panama (5.8 percent).23 The 
largest share within social protection 
spend ing corresponds to social security 
(that is, contributory pensions), whereas 
social assistance spending represents only 
1.1 percent of GDP, similar to the share in 
Guatemala (1.1 percent), Nicaragua, and 
Panama (0.9 percent) and below El Salva-
dor (2.6 percent). During the crisis of 2009, 
the government increased social protection 
spending, particularly cash transfers, 
which doubled in terms of GDP percentage 
from 0.3 percent to 0.6 percent.24 All other 
spending categories remained largely un-
changed during the period (right panel of 
figure 5.16).

Pension coverage is high, but different 
pension regimes exacerbate inequities. A 
look at pension coverage among the elderly 
reveals that, though not universal, coverage 
is rather large for LAC standards.25 Indeed, 
by 2013, 58 percent of the elderly in the 
bottom income quintile received a pension 
(of which 40 percent was non-contribu-
tory), and 67 percent of the elderly in the 
top quintile also received a pension (where 
64 percent were contributory pensions). 
Thus, two-thirds of the elderly receive some 
form of pension, and there is very little in-
equality in terms of coverage across income 
quintiles (figure 5.17). Yet, the elderly poor 
are much more likely to receive non-con-
tributory pensions, which are clearly smaller 
than contributory pensions. Moreover, 
among those that receive contributory pen-
sions, there is a stark difference between 
pensioners of the public sector and private 
sector regimes. The special regimes (now 
mostly closed to current workers) pay sig-
nificantly more generous benefits than

those provided by the CCSS for the general 
population. This is not only a source of in-
equity but also raises sustainability ques-
tions, as discussed in the previous section.
At the same time, social assistance trans-
fers have had limited effects on poverty and 
inequality due to low coverage of the poor. 
This is explained by the fact that most social 
assistance programs in Costa Rica have fairly 
low coverage among the poor. As figure 5.18 
shows, even the most widespread program 
(school meals) reaches only half of the pop-
ulation in the lowest income quintile; and 
the second largest program, the conditional 
cash transfer program Avancemos, reaches 
only 28 percent. In addition, there exist a 
large number of programs, whose coverage 
is not documented in the household survey 
ENAHO and that reach a very small number 
of beneficiaries (fewer than 20 thousand in 
most cases).
Moreover, most major social assistance 
programs are not well targeted. As the top 
panel of figure 5.19 shows, even the “best” tar-
geted programs, such as the non-contributory 
pension, have about half of their beneficiaries 
in the bottom quintile. At the other end, a 
program like school meals provides most of 
its benefits to non-poor children, and a simi-
lar situation occurs with training programs 
from INA (Instituto Nacional de Aprendizaje, 
National Learning Institute). Putting Costa 
Rica in an international context (bottom panel 
of figure 5.19) reveals that there is significant 
room for improving the targeting accuracy of 
its programs. For example, 74 percent of cash 
transfers in the CCT Red de Oportunidades of 
Panama (one of Costa Rica’s structural peers) 
go to the poorest quintile, against 44 percent 
for Avancemos. Thus, it is unclear how effec-
tive Costa Rica’s programs can be to help the 
poor (and especially the poorest) bridge the

gaps created by low human capital and low ac-
cess to jobs.
Furthermore, social assistance is widely 
seen as “welfare assistance” instead of a 
 system to lift people out of poverty. Despite 
a broad political and social support for so-
cial programs for the poor, there is a com-
mon view both in the government and in 
the society, that social programs are not ef-
fective in generating capabilities that would 
enable people to escape poverty. They are 
rather seen as a retaining wall that prevents 
further increases of poverty, especially dur-
ing crises, as seems to be the case with some 
programs like the CCT Avancemos (figure 
5.20), but they have little impact on over-
all poverty. Yet, many social programs 
were conceived expressly to boost income- 
generating capabilities. This is the case of 
all school support programs (school meals, 
Fondo Nacional de Becas (National Scholar-
ship Fund, FONABE) scholarships, and 
Avancemos), but also of the early childhood

programs (Red de Cuido/CEN-CINAI), the 
housing programs (BAHNVI), and other 
smaller training and entrepreneurship pro-
grams. The lack of a culture of evaluation 
and social accountability within the social 
sector (and beyond) has contributed to 
the view that social programs have “no 
 impact” and that they only serve as basic 
safety nets. In the long term, this can under-
mine the legitimacy and the public support 
for them.
Finally, a significant challenge for the effi-
ciency and effectiveness of the social protec-
tion system is its fragmentation and insti  
tutional complexity. Institutional arrange-
ments in the management and financing of 
social programs are highly complex. Before 
funds can be used by an implementing 
agency (for example IMAS (Joint Institute 
for Social Assistance), they flow through 
various channels, in particular FODESAF 
(National Development and Family Alloca-
tions Fund, run by the Ministry of Labor), 
which distributes funds from the central 
government to various programs, based on 
an allocation formula set by law. The result-
ing earmarking makes budget allocation in-
flexible; and because more than 50 percent 
of FODESAF’s budget is earmarked, it is dif-
ficult to track financial flows and to assess 
the cost effectiveness of programs.26

nificant achievements in reforestation. Over 

Sustainability of Costa Rica’s Development Model

the last 30 years, forest cover has increased 
from 26 percent to 52 percent (figure 5.21). 
This has been made possible through public 
and private engagement and the use of eco-
nomic incentives for conservation (under 
the 1996 Forest Law and its Payment for 
Environment Services [PES] framework), 
which have served as important drivers for 

promoting forest conservation, reforesta-
tion, and afforestation (chapter 1, box 1.2). 
These have proven critical to Costa Rica’s 
development strategy, given the country’s 
recognition as an international ecotourism 
desti nation. The tourism industry generated 
income of US$2.3 billion in 2013, repre-
senting around 44 percent of total service 

KNoWLeDGe GAP 5.1 How Can Costa Rica improve the effectiveness 
and Coordination of its Social Programs?

Social policy is fragmented across numerous institutions in Costa Rica, many of them 
autonomous agencies. Consequently, more than two dozen social programs operate in 
parallel, often with similar target groups. What is the mapping of social programs by 
agency, objectives, coverage, and performance? How can these duplications (and resulting 
gaps in coverage for some population groups) be reduced, either through consolidation of 
programs, integration of Social Registries (such as the SIPO, operated by IMAS, and the 
SINIRUBE [National System of Registration of Beneficiaries], operated by FODESAF), or 
more ambitious institutional consolidation? This is the topic of a new non-lending techni-
cal assistance being requested by the Government of Costa Rica.

Sustainability of Costa Rica’s Development Model

 
 
KNoWLeDGe GAP 5.2 How Can Costa Rica Link Sustainable Production 
and Rural Landscapes to its Conservation Model?

Costa Rica’s well-known Green Trademark has been centered on a conservation approach, 
supported by public sector economic incentives for conservation and reforestation (the 
PES mechanism) and eco-tourism resources. Fiscal and economic pressures, as well as 
scope, bring into question the sustainability of that model. How can Costa Rica adapt to 
the next generation of the green agenda, going beyond conservation and nature protection 
towards innovative ways for mainstreaming conservation into productive landscapes, 
and beyond carbon neutrality towards resilience? Further work under the programmatic 
NLTA on Green and Inclusive Growth seeks to bring further evidence to this important 
policy question.

exports or 19 percent of merchandise ex-
ports (chapter 4). Approximately 40 percent 
of tourists visited national parks. Costa Rica 
continues to strive for “green” leadership 
with its international commitment in 2009 
(at the UN Summit on Climate Change) to 
become a carbon neutral nation by 2021 
(chapter 1, box 1.2).
However, its Green Trademark and its 
commitment to carbon neutrality are at 
risk. Being green and carbon neutral at the 
same time entails not only maintaining the 
current levels of forest cover, but also re-
ducing the current levels of Greenhouse 
Gas (GHG) emissions from all sectors. This 
is a challenging task given the trade-offs 
built into the current economic incentive 
structure for forest conservation and re-
forestation, which is dependent on reve-
nues generated from tax on gasoline. While 
a large share of GHG emissions can be re-
duced through better management of for-
ested and agricultural land, the country 
also needs to reduce carbon emissions 
from fossil fuels coming from transport, 

construction, and increasingly from gen-
eral electricity consumption.27
The current environmental regulatory 
framework favors a strong conservation ap-
proach that has limited productive opportuni-
ties. During the last four decades, the focus 
on conservation has led to the development 
of a nature-based tourism sector, on the one 
hand, and a significant contraction of the do-
mestic timber industry, on the other. Costa 
Rica has become a net importer of processed 
and finished wood products, such as furni-
ture.28 As the demand for wood and processed 
timber has been steadily increasing over the 
last decade, underinvestment in the timber in-
dustry has led to a 36.4 percent drop in output 
of processed timber between 2007 and 2012 
and an increase in the exports of low-value 
unprocessed products (such as palettes [tari-
mas], construction material, sawn wood). Ag-
ricultural productivity of many of Costa Rica’s 
main crops has also seen a declining trend 
(coffee, in particular) (chapter 4), which affects 
the livelihood of rural populations engaged in 
agriculture. The focus on conser vation has also 

Sustainability of Costa Rica’s Development Model 

121

limited the country’s potential to meet increas-
ing energy needs through renewable energy 
generation (such as hydropower, geothermal, 
and biomass), which would require the ex-
ploitation of resources located within the 
boundaries of protected areas.
Efforts to maintain or further increase 
the forest cover are undermined by rising 
opportunity costs. The fiscal weight of 
Costa Rica’s conservation and reforestation 
program can prove too heavy to sustain in 
the longer term, with more pressing social 
and economic issues that the country faces 
in the short term and an increasing oppor-
tunity cost of alternative land-use options. 
More profitable non-traditional export crops 
such as pineapples, bananas, or oil palm are 
becoming more economically attractive, 
with land owners opting out of the conser-
vation and reforestation programs once the 
contracts are phased out. Although these 
activities generate employment in rural areas, 

they may jeopardize Costa Rica’s achieve-
ments in countering deforestation trends 
and promoting a green image, unless land 
use change is adequately managed and po-
tential negative environmental externalities 
(such as heavy use of agro-chemicals—see 
figure 5.22) are internalized through effec-
tive mechanisms (such as organic produc-
tion). If in the medium to long term Costa 
Rica wants to continue increasing or main-
taining its current forest cover, the regula-
tory framework governing its management 
and associated incentives needs to be re-
viewed and adapted to a growth strategy 
that considers the role of forest conserva-
tion in the context of a rural productive 
space that is increasingly vulnerable to 
weather changes.
Moreover, rapid urbanization has brought 
new challenges for the country. Costa Rica’s 
urban population has been growing rapidly, 
from 50 percent of the total population in

1990 to 75 percent in 2013. The first chal-
lenge relates to the transportation area and 
associated carbon emissions and air pollu-
tion. Increasing energy demand is boosting 
the use of fossil fuels and raising air pollu-
tion levels, mainly through a significant in-
crease in road-based transport. Growing 
and aging vehicle fleets and increased con-
gestion are key drivers, especially in the San 
José Greater Metropolitan Area (GMA).29 
Energy subsidies, especially for transport 
fuels, further magnify this development by 
incentivizing inefficient use of vehicles. 
However, the public transportation system 
in the GMA is obsolete (all routes converge 
to the city center) and contributes to grid-
lock. The economic costs of urban air pollu-
tion in Costa Rica amount to about CRC 
210 billion (about one percent of GDP). 
Around 350 premature deaths and close to 
4,700 lost Disability-Adjusted Life Years 
(DALY) are attributable to urban air pollu-
tion (Particulate Matter (PM) exposure). 
The second set of challenges emerging from 
urbanization includes sewage treatment and 

solid-waste management. Although access 
to sanitation is almost universal (chapter 3), 
96 percent of all urban wastewater collected 
is discharged into rivers and receiving water 
bodies without any treatment, generating 
public health risks and water resources con-
tamination (figure 5.23). Only eight percent 
of the population is connected to a sewage 
system and to a wastewater treatment plant. 
In San José, only four out of 16 wastewater 
treatment plants comply with state regula-
tions. The water contamination has been 
so severe in some cases as to result in five 
beaches being declared unsuitable for 
swimmers (Quepos, Azul, Tarcoles, Portete, 
and Balneario municipal de Limon).30 
Mounting unmanaged solid waste has con-
sequences for public health and the sustain-
ability of the green model. In sum, an 
emerging area of environmental sustain-
ability is the brown agenda.
The country is also highly exposed to nat-
ural hazards and faces significant challenges 
from climate change. Costa Rica is one of 
the countries with the highest exposure to

hazards, including hydro-meteorological 
(floods, cyclones, and landslides) and geo-
physical (earthquakes and volcanoes).31 It is 
the second most exposed country to multiple 
hazards based on land area, with 36.8 percent 
of the total area exposed to three or more 
natural hazards. It is estimated that 77.9 per-
cent of the population and 80.1 percent of 
GDP are subject to high risk from multiple 
hazards. While Costa Rica has been spared 
by major disasters in recent years, it is not 
immune to the potential of a catastrophic 
event. Hurricane Thomas in 2010 caused 
damages estimated at US$292 million; Tropi-
cal Depression 12E in 2011 caused US$60 
million in damages; and in 2012 the Samara-
Guanacaste earthquake generated US$100 
million in damages to public buildings, 
transport, health, education, and water and 
sanitation infrastructure. Furthermore, ac-
cording to the Intergovernmental Panel 
of Climate Change (IPCC), some of the cli-
mate change projections for Costa Rica indi-
cate up to a 32 percent decrease in overall 
rainfall precipitation by 2050. Some areas, 
especially in the North, have recently seen 
more frequent and prolonged drought peri-
ods. Changes in storm regimes near the 
coast may further erode coastal morphology, 
disrupt fishing areas and agricultural lands, 
and salinize water sources.32
Increasing urbanization and vulnerabil-
ity of public infrastructure are two factors 
contributing to risk exposure. The San Jose 
GMA’s fast- growing population puts pres-
sure on the limited natural resources and 
on public goods and services. Affordable 
housing is a major socioeconomic con-
straint (see chapter 3) that forces many 
low-income families to relocate to higher- 
risk areas. In fact, most of the people af-
fected by disasters such as floods live in 

informal urban settlements.33 On the pub-
lic infrastructure side, low levels of invest-
ment in disaster risk reduction are putting 
critical transport infrastructure at risk of 
failure in the event of a disaster. An illus-
trative example is the need to replace and 
retrofit the bridges most crucial for trans-
port and most vulnerable to seismic and 
hydro- meteorological events. Of all the 
damages due to hydro-meteorological events 
between 2005 and 2010, 51.6 percent were 
recorded in the transport sector.
Strengthening prevention and resilience 
is complicated by low capacity of local gov-
ernments. Even though national policies for 
Disaster Risk Management (DRM) exist at 
the national level, a major constraint in the 
process of generating more knowledge and 
increasing preparation is the level of local 
technical capacity to absorb information 
and implement the right measures.34 For ex-
ample, the capabilities to use and process 
information vary widely across municipali-
ties: only a few have the right human and 
infrastructure resources, such as sophisti-
cated mapping systems. As a result, overall 
resilience and adaptation to climate-induced 
impacts has yet to be achieved at local 
levels.
Sustaining and promoting a Green Trade-
mark needs to extend beyond forest conser-
vation and reforestation. The “green” asset 
that Costa Rica has established with its forests 
can be maintained only through an integrated 
approach that enables the conservation of 
natural resources to be developed in parallel 
to other productive activities and balances 
the many financial and environmental trade-
offs. This has been achieved in other coun-
tries, such as New Zealand and Finland, 
where the “green” image is supported with 
strong forestry and agricultural sectors and a 

124 

Sustainability of Costa Rica’s Development Model

risk preparedness framework. However, the 
challenge in Costa Rica will be to find the 
right balance, if any, between “green” and car-
bon neutral while addressing increasing is-
sues in the brown agenda in the country.

Governance Challenges 
Hamper Government 
Effectiveness and 
Regulatory Growth35

Despite Costa Rica’s good standing on 
governance relative to the LAC region, both 
perceptions and evidence suggest that its in-
stitutions and procedures have not been able 
to adapt to the challenges of a new economic 
and social environment. Costa Rica has bet-
ter governance indicators than LAC, but lags 
behind OECD countries (figure 5.24). After 
the 1948 civil war, the abolition of the army, 
and the creation of the new Constitution 
in 1949, Costa Rica became an exemplary 

democracy, with a clear checks and balances 
system between the executive and the legisla-
tive (Assembly). Since 1953, elections have 
been peaceful and citizen participation in 
the political process is high (chapter 1). 
Costa Rica also has high marks in the areas 
of voice and accountability and control of 
corruption. The areas of government effec-
tiveness and regulatory quality are the ones 
trailing behind, with the largest difference 
with OECD countries.
The current political landscape poses ad-
ditional challenges for approving and im-
plementing needed reforms. Costa Rica’s 
legislative power has gradually shifted from 
a bi-partisan to a multi-party system, ham-
pering the adoption of reforms in many in-
stances over the past  decade(s) ( figure 5.25). 
Parliamentary procedures, which histori-
cally did not impede decision making, give 
political minorities the power to delay votes 
or to file injunctions, which, in a fragmented 
and polarized environment, seems to be 
hampering reform processes.36 One example

is the fiscal reform package that was ap-
proved by the Legislative Assembly, and 
later invalidated by the Constitutional 
Court following an injunction filed by a leg-
islator. The leadership, in drafting new legis-
lation, has also shifted slightly from the 
executive to the legislative, partly a reflec-
tion of parliamentary procedures. For ex-
ample, during the Chinchilla administration 
(2010–2014), most of the new legislation 
passed originated in the Arias administra-
tion (2006–2010). Paradoxically, the Chin-
chilla government experienced the most 
difficulty in passing comprehensive reforms 
in the Assembly during its first two years, 
when the political capital would seemingly 
be the highest.37 During the second half of 
the term, the “wear and tear” of parliamen-
tary negotiations manifested itself, and the 
magnitude of the new legislation passed 
also diminished. The delays and difficulty in 
passing comprehensive and meaningful re-
forms result in a mismatch between the 
“political delivery” and the demands of the 

population. Finally, in the absence of clear 
political leadership and consensus, new in-
terpretations of the existing laws take the 
place of passing new laws.
A consequence of this gridlock in pass-
ing reforms has been the proliferation of an 
increasing number of public (and often au-
tonomous) institutions created to address 
specific problems. Costa Rica is notorious in 
Latin America for the large number of pub-
lic institutions. In 2011, the state comprised 
324 entities (table 5.1), followed by El Salva-
dor with only 162. Many of these institu-
tions were born out of a desire to make the 
government apparatus more efficient and 
agile—typically through the creation of “au-
tonomous institutions,” which are run under 
different regulations from the Central Gov-
ernment and have a separate budget process 
(more on this below). Also, these institu-
tions usually have much more generous pay 
scales than the Central Government, but the 
same level of job security, and no real per-
formance evaluation mechanisms. In the

last two decades, more public entities were 
created than in the entire period 1950–1979. 
Between 1990 and 2009, 118 were founded 
or restructured. Over time, these new bod-
ies are affecting the government’s efficiency 
(and service  delivery), thus reinforcing the 
vicious cycle that leads to the creation of 
new institutions. In some cases, some insti-
tutional clusters have been effective in 
achieving positive outcomes (for example, 
the attraction of FDI and tourism develop-
ment discussed earlier); but in others there 
are failures, too, the most salient one being 
the case of the rice sector (box 5.1). With 28 
institutions, the agricultural sector provides 
an example of the fragmentation of institu-
tions that hinders the coordination and ef-
fectiveness of policies, decision-making, and 
quality of services for producers.38 As long 
as public sector action is needed to provide 
services to foster growth, modernizing the 
public sector becomes a needed foundation 
that will impact all aspects of the economy.
Besides the proliferation of institutions, 
current procurement practices are not con-
ducive to an effective control of resources. 

Current public procurement practices fail to 
consolidate purchases (taking advantage of 
framework agreements, for example) or 
standard bidding documents, both of which 
could lead to important cost savings. Also, 
neither the public sector entity nor the gov-
ernment makes good use of existing infor-
mation technology to plan, manage, or 
control procurement. In many cases, precise 
purchasing statistics are not available and 
there are only weak links between procure-
ment plans, the budget process, and various 
aspects of the financial management at the 
budget execution stage. In addition, within 
this overall legal and oversight framework, 
each public sector entity is free to set its pro-
curement rules and procedures, making it 
difficult to do centralized planning or to 
consolidate purchases across institutions. 
This absence of complete statistics on pro-
curement and procurement methods makes 
it difficult to identify patterns, learn from 
mistakes, carry out performance evaluation, 
and design efficient procurement policies.
Another complexity of the intricate pub-
lic sector administration is the budget and

Box 5.1 The Rice Sector: Failure of a Productive Development Policy

Rice, a staple item in the food basket of the poor, is one of the most protected commodities 
in Costa Rica. Rice tariffs in Costa Rica are high, at 62 percent for processed rice (having 
recently increased from 35 percent), and prices for locally produced rice are controlled at 
each step of the process. Rice subsidies (in the form of guaranteed prices), amount to 45 
percent of the domestic price, higher than in the United States or the European Union 
(EU). Ironically, the policies that protect rice prices under a banner of food security and 
equity have brought them well above international prices, benefiting a handful of large 
producers and harming the budget of the poor.
The Corporación Arrocera Nacional (CONARROZ), created in 2002, has been effective in 
protecting producers from international price shocks, but not in improving local produc-
tion conditions. CONARROZ gathers a very diverse set of rice producers and processors, 
most of them very small producers. Its lobbying efforts are presented as a way of defend-
ing these small producers and protecting jobs in the agricultural sector. However, most 
of the rice produced in Costa Rica (about 80 percent) comes from a minority of large 
producers and processors, who also benefit from tariff-free import quotas (assigned 
proportionally to their processing capacity). Thus, they can purchase rice at international 
market prices, and sell the processed rice domestically with a high profit. It is estimated 
that from 1995 to 2005, consumers transferred US$396 million to rice producers, which 
for the poorest households represents seven to eight percent of their per capita income.
Price controls have done little to improve productivity among rice producers but have 
created incentives to maintain the status quo. Although consumer prices have continu-
ously increased since 2008, producer prices have remained flat or decreased, mostly due to 
low quality. The average yield per hectare has gone down from 4.8 tons in 1999/2000 to 
3.39 tons in 2011/2012. As a result, most domestic rice producers, particularly the smaller 
ones, would not be profitable at international prices, and thus have a strong interest to 
maintain the status quo.

planning system. The current budget system 
limits the ability to have a comprehensive 
discussion on policy and spending priori-
ties.39 Costa Rica has three distinct budgetary 
processes in the public sector. First, the cen-
tral government budget or national budget, 
which is approved by the legislative assembly. 
Second, the budgetary process of the 

institutions outside the central government, 
whose budget is approved by the Comptroller 
General of the Republic (CGR), and which 
doubles the size of the national budget. Of 
the total public sector budget, the national 
budget is about 33 percent, and the budget of 
other institutions is 66 percent.40 The third 
budget process is for municipality budgets,

In terms of budget, the Costa Rican Social Security Institute (Caja Costarricense de Seguro 
Social, CCSS) is the largest decentralized autonomous entity in the Government. Its 
annual budget of about US$5.6 billion 
for 2015 is equivalent to 37 percent of 
the Central Government Budget.
The CCSS’ operational processes are 
characterized by complex and cum-
bersome procedures. They rely on a 
“silo” approach that favors fragmenta-
tion and duplication of many pro-
cesses paired with multiple layers of 
approvals. Moreover, the fragmenta-
tion of processes has resulted in the 
development and use of multiple non- 
linked IT tools (including Excel sheets 
and databases) for the recording, control, and generation of different pieces of information. 
The information generated by these independent IT tools needs to be aggregated and 
reconciled. In a highly decentralized environment, having excessive manual controls is not 
effective and has consequences in terms of added transaction costs and difficulties in 
producing information that could assist with service delivery.
The preparation of financial statements provides a good example of the challenges that 
CCSS faces to adequately monitor the use of its resources. Information from over 20 IT 
systems and databases is manually collected and aggregated Because these systems and 
databases are not linked, the CCSS has developed burdensome and manual reconciliations 
across the organization, as well as additional manual controls, in order to ensure that 
errors are prevented or detected in a timely manner. The lack of an integrated IT platform 
does not allow the timely and systematic recording of financial and accounting transac-
tions. While these manual and compensating controls allow for the timely preparation of 
budgetary reports and financial statements (including budget monitoring, reconciliations 
of accounts, analyses of fluctuations, aging of accounts, and manual and supervisory 
reviews), given the nature of the CCSS more meaningful financial information—such as 
financial information by service delivery units or by cost centers—might be needed to 
support decision-making and monitoring financial performance.

which account for less than two percent of 
public sector expenditures. The CGR verifies 
the legality of proposed expenditures by the 
municipalities. Thus, a large part of public 
expenditures is not under the direct control 
of the executive or the legislative powers.41 
The latest PEFA assessment (World Bank and 
IDB 2010), found that only 49.6 percent of 
expenditures were approved by the Congress 
and in 2011 the central government ac-
counted for only 41 percent of expenditures 
and 27 out of a total of 229 entities.42
The budget process and numerous ear-
marked expenditures reduce the margin for 
the executive to control public investment 
and current expenses. Budgets are increas-
ingly constrained by constitutional man-
dates and rules without corresponding 
financing, such as directives on minimum 
spending for education, municipalities, 
housing subsidies, and community devel-
opment. Additional laws stipulate that por-
tions of taxes and fees must be allocated to 
certain activities and institutions, such as 
FODESAF (National Development and 
Family Allocations Fund) and CONAVI 
(National Roads Authority). Pensions, wages, 
and salaries account for three- quarters of 
central government expenditures. Public 
sector employment is much higher in Costa 
Rica than in most other Latin American 
countries, comprising 14.4 percent of the 
labor force in 2012 compared to an average 
of 10.9 percent (figure 5.26). Public sector 
wages are also significantly higher than the 
private sector ones (see chapter 5, figure 
5.5). Moreover, the central government tax 
revenue is still insufficient to fund all these 
legal and constitutional mandates. A World 
Bank Public Expenditure Review finds that 
“in order not to exceed spending limits and 
given these rigidities, the government has 

often resorted to cutting back on public in-
vestment, putting pressure on service deliv-
ery. One of the most evident results of 
public investments restrictions is the dete-
rioration in the quality of most of Costa 
Rica’s infrastructure services.”43 More im-
portant, the executive has no power to di-
rect or contain spending in autonomous 
institutions, since they operate with wide 
margins of budgetary and administrative 
independence, and are constitutionally 
protected from political interference or 
changes in government.
Moreover, sectorial planning is weak 
with limited medium-term costing projec-
tions. Annual work plans are developed at 
the institution level despite a provision 
made in Law 8131 to develop multi-annual 
plans at the sectorial level (multi-institu-
tional). The PEFA (ID-11 iii) shows a very 
weak environment for sectorial planning. 
More analysis will be needed to fully under-
stand the consequences of weak sectorial 
planning coupled with increased number of 
institutions (including special purpose insti-
tutions, executive agencies) on service de-
livery, but clearly a fragmented planning 
system is not conducive to improving the 
quality of public expenditures.
The main effect of weaknesses in public 
sector administration is on the diminished 
ability of the public sector to deliver services 
expected by the population and private sec-
tor. Agencies affected are those in charge of 
education, health, public infrastructure, and 
social assistance, which have a direct effect on 
the inclusiveness of growth. Not surprising, 
there is a growing perception of low effective-
ness of government institutions and civil ser-
vants. According to a 2011 Latinobarómetro 
study, Costa Rica was rated by its own citizens 
at 5.5 out of 10 on the efficiency of the

Knowledge gap 5.3 what are the Key governance Bottlenecks in 
executing Infrastructure projects—and what are Their Cost Implications?

Various factors are named as obstacles to implementation of public infrastructure and 
social projects in the various line ministries, such as cumbersome processes in the Public 
Procurement Law, deficiencies in the environmental regulatory framework, cumbersome 
checks and reviews by the Contraloria, and deficiencies in the expropriations law. Further 
evidence on the trajectory of investment projects—and the time delays and costs of each 
step along the way—would help inform the debate about how to reduce the “chokes and 
strangleholds” on public investment in Costa Rica.

that increase the transaction costs of inter-
acting with public institutions and decrease 
the quality of services. The poor ranking of 
Costa Rica in the Doing Business Indicators 
(see figure 4.28) is partly attributed to bur-
densome procedures within and between 
public institutions. Reducing red tape will 
facilitate firms’ operations, reducing trans-
action costs of interacting with public insti-
tutions. Only one quarter of firms report 

that red tape declined in 2014.44 Small and 
medium enterprises are the most affected 
by red tape. Firms in the FTZs depend on 
CINDE to expedite solutions for complying 
with business regulations. Furthermore, the 
quality and efficiency of public services can 
be affected by cumbersome procedures.
In sum, we find that the public sector has 
moved very slowly to adapt to the increasing 
sophistication and needs of the economy.

of it was due to interest payments. Nowadays, 
interest payments are around half that amount, 
and the overall deficit reflects a growing pri-

public expenditures.

6.  Priority Areas, Linkages, and 
Complementarities

Costa Rica’s development model has 
sustained impressive achievements. Centered 
on its long-standing democracy, ambitious 
Social Compact, open economy model, and 
Green Trademark, the country has sustained 
healthy growth rates, improvements in social 
indicators, environmental gains, and one of 
the lowest poverty rates in the Latin America 
and Caribbean (LAC) region.
However, despite these impressive 
achieve ments, there are a number of emerg-
ing challenges that will need to be addressed 
to main tain the country’s successful develop-
ment path.
First, despite reasonable growth and a 
strong commitment to the Social Compact, 
poverty reduction has stagnated and inequal-
ity is rising. The long-term trend suggests ris-
ing or stagnating inequality across most of the 
past 25 years, in stark contrast to the signifi-
cant decline in inequality in the broader LAC 
region. More recently, the gap between the 
rich and poor has widened significantly since 
the global crisis. Although growth recovered 
promptly after the global crisis, above the re-
gional average, job creation for low-skilled 
workers has been feeble, contributing to ris-
ing unemployment and pushing returns to 
higher education upwards. Growth has been 
uneven, with lower growth and job creation 
in sectors that are more likely to employ un-
skilled workers (e.g., construction and agri-
culture). Not surprisingly, inequality has 
increased, with the widening gap between the 
earnings of rich and poor workers mirroring 
large disparities in human capital and 

educational attainment. Moreover, despite 
high spending on social protection benefits 
and the broader Social Compact, taxes and 
transfers have not proven to be effective in re-
distributing income to compensate for these 
disparities. Consequently, rising inequality 
offset the poverty-reducing impact of growth 
in the late 2000s, and reversed what should 
have been a decline in poverty between 2010 
and 2014, with poverty increasing by 0.4 per-
centage points instead of falling by a projected 
three percentage points during the post- crisis 
“recovery” period.
Second, although GDP has grown steadily 
in recent years, especially compared to the 
Latin American Region as a whole, Costa 
Rica performance is not comparable to the 
top regional performers. Unlike the top re-
gional performers (Chile, Panama, and 
 Uruguay) Costa Rica’s per capita GDP had 
not shown any signs of convergence towards 
the US level in the last 25 years. For example, 
in 1990, Costa Rica per capita income was 
13 percent of the US level, approximately as 
it is today. At the same time, the per capita 
GDP of Chile, Panama, and Uruguay have 
increased form 13, 12 and 9 percent of the 
US per capita GDP in 1990 to 21, 17 and 
17 percent today respectively. Production 
costs that weaken the country’s competitive-
ness prevent Costa Rica from joining the top 
growth performers. These productions costs 
are affected by relatively high wages that 
limit the country competitiveness in low 
value added sectors, as well as by a number 
of investment-climate related factors such as 

Priority Areas, Linkages, and Complementarities 

135

rising electricity costs, weak infrastructure, 
and burdensome regulations.
And third, fiscal pressures threaten to un-
dermine the sustainability of the country’s 
Social Compact and Green Trademark, and 
prevent it from undertaking much needed 
investments in public infrastructure. With-
out fiscal consolidation, the deficit could 
push public debt to unsustainable levels and 
threaten the country’s economic, social, and 
environmental gains. The fiscal situation has 
deteriorated substantially since the global 
crisis, with the overall deficit of the Central 
Government growing to 5.6 percent of GDP 
in 2013, and is projected to have surpassed 
six percent in 2014 and to reach 6.6 in 2015. 
In tandem, public debt increased from 25 
percent of GDP in 2008 to 37 percent in 
2013, with projections of 63 percent by 2019 
unless corrective measures are imple-
mented. This recent deterioration stems 
from counter-cyclical measures under-taken 
during the crisis and structural forces that 
will require actions on multiple fronts.
Moreover, the current political landscape 
and institutional framework add an addi-
tional layer of complexity for approving and 
implementing key reforms needed to address 
these emerging challenges. The shift from a 
two-party to a multi-party system in the last 
fifteen years has resulted in more complex 
and lengthy reform processes. The delays and 
difficulties in passing comprehensive and 
meaningful reforms, particularly on sensitive 
issues such as tax reform, has resulted in a 
mismatch between the demands of the popu-
lation and the “political delivery”. This is an 
increasing concern given the growing need to 
react and adapt quickly to changing global 
developments. Likewise, capacity constraints, 
related to weak sectoral planning and bureau-
cratic inefficiencies, also affect the ability of 

the public sector to implement policies and 
execute public investment projects.
Several threads weave across this “tril-
ogy” of challenges for inclusion, growth, 
and  sustainability—and point to priority 
areas for action. One thread involves the in-
teractions between inequality and growth, 
which hinge on the mismatch of skills and 
jobs. Another strand is the dual challenge of 
maintaining competitiveness of high val-
ue-added sectors, while enhancing the via-
bility of traditional low value-added sectors. 
Mounting fiscal pressures threaten the sus-
tainability of the Social Compact and Green 
Trademark. Finally, the challenges of gover-
nance also weave across the development 
agenda, limiting the capacity of the public 
sector to adopt reforms, deliver services, 
and execute infrastructure projects. These 
inter- connected challenges highlight a 
number of priority areas that Costa Rica 
needs to address to continue on a sustain-
able and inclusive growth path.
These links highlight a number of comple-
mentary priority areas for Costa Rica to con-
tinue on a sustainable and inclusive growth 
path. As in other countries, the list of policy 
areas that could potentially help make prog-
ress toward poverty reduction and shared 
prosperity is long. Through a combination of 
diagnostics, benchmarking, and internal and 
external consultations, this Systematic Coun-
try Diagnostic (SCD) refines the long list to 
identify a set of cross-cutting areas with 
strong linkages and complementarities. These 
include: strengthening the education and 
training systems, boosting competitiveness 
and reducing the infrastructure deficit, 
strength ening governance, and undertaking a 
variety of measures to ensure the sustainabil-
ity of the fiscal situation, the Social Compact, 
and the Green Trademark (figure 6.1).

Education and skills. Costa Rica needs 
to build a skilled workforce to supports its 
trajectory towards a high value-added 
economy and to reduce the skills-income 
gap. With fewer than half of young adults 
graduating from secondary school, and 
with performance on test scores falling, 
Costa Rica’s labor supply does not appear 
to be well adapted to generate the skills 
needed for the labor market. Thus, building 
a more skilled workforce will ensure that 
the country remains competitive in high 

value-added sectors, and that more workers 
can access these better paying jobs, includ-
ing those in the bottom 40 percent of the 
population. As these changes are structural, 
for the most part they are also long term in 
nature. Workers cannot just “acquire an 
 education overnight.” As such, tackling 
these challenges will require a three-pronged 
approach: (i) strengthening the quality, re-
tention, and relevance of the education sys-
tem (from pre-school through secondary 
school)—which will help build the skills of 

Priority Areas, Linkages, and Complementarities 

137

“tomorrow’s workers”; (ii) improving the 
quality and relevance of tertiary education; 
and (iii) strengthening the technical train-
ing system for the workforce.
Bold actions are needed to overhaul 
Costa Rica’s education system. Given the 
country’s level of development and high ed-
ucation spending, the education system se-
riously underperforms in quality (as 
demon strated by test results), retention (low 
completion rates), and relevance (as indi-
cated by low returns to training and lower 
levels of education). Although high rates of 
secondary school dropout are a symptom of 
the broader challenges in the system, imbal-
ances in the allocation of public spending 
favor primary (41 percent) and tertiary ed-
ucation (32 percent) with relatively little al-
located to the secondary level (27 percent). 
Indeed, both the share of public spending 
and the allocation per student in secondary 
education are low by international stan-
dards and given Costa Rica’s level of devel-
opment. Moreover, inequities in learning 
outcomes start early in life—and affect mo-
tivation and abilities to learn throughout 
the school years. In addition to rebalancing 
spending towards secondary school and 
early childhood devel opment, Costa Rica 
needs to strengthen teacher quality and im-
prove accountability through regular moni-
toring with standardized learning 
assessments, and a more effective gover-
nance and incentive framework.
Given the high-skilled profile of job op-
portunities in Costa Rica, systemic efforts are 
also needed to enhance the quality and rele-
vance of tertiary education. Currently, the 
tertiary education system is heavily biased to-
wards social science and humanities, and 
produces few STEM (Science, Technology, 
Engineering and Mathematics) graduates, 

further contributing to the skills shortage in 
high value-added sectors. Moreover, outdated 
and bureaucratic procedures for recognizing 
foreign degrees create obstacles for Costa 
Rica to “import” the skills needed to sustain 
its high value-added growth model. Quality 
and accountability mechanisms are also 
needed, with performance agreements with 
public universities and quality accreditation 
standards for both university and non-univer-
sity tertiary education.
Finally, the country needs to expand the 
offering and relevance of technical training, 
which is the most direct way to build the 
skills of the current workforce. Again, stron-
ger quality standards, certification of techni-
cal programs, and accountability of training 
institutes could help. The National Learning 
Institute (INA) could also improve coordi-
nation with private-sector employers to de-
sign market-relevant curricula and course 
offerings so as to better respond to the needs 
of the growing sectors of the economy.

Competitiveness and the business cli-
mate. Boosting growth and inclusion in 
the labor market requires confronting the 
dual challenge of maintaining competitive-
ness of high value-added sectors, while im-
proving the viability of low value-added 
sectors. For instance, improving the integra-
tion of export-oriented and domestic firms 
through backward linkages could sustain the 
growth among small and medium enter-
prises (SMEs), generating jobs in mid- and 
low-skilled occupations. This can be done by 
lowering operation costs to improve the pro-
ductivity of labor and counterbalance the 
high labor costs in Costa Rica compared to 
its neighbors, for example by lowering the 
costs of doing business through regulatory 
simplification.

Priority Areas, Linkages, and Complementarities

Infrastructure. Reducing the infrastruc-
ture deficit would increase competitiveness, 
growth, and environmental sustainability. 
Costa Rica’s historical efforts to build an ex-
tensive network of infrastructure in nearly 
all productive service areas (water, sanita-
tion, transport, electricity, and telecommuni-
cations) are clear from the infrastructure 
stock: the country has two times the road 
and three times the rail density of the aver-
age middle-income country ; access to elec-
tricity is nearly universal; and mobile 
penetration is higher than the OECD aver-
age. Yet, the near freeze in public infrastruc-
ture investment until the 1990s, as well as 
recent fiscal constraints, have taken a toll on 
the country’s ability to upgrade and maintain 
its infrastructure. Further, the government 
has faced significant challenges in executing 
infrastructure investment in a timely man-
ner. As a result, today roads and ports have 
among the lowest quality marks in the LAC 
region. Electricity prices have doubled since 
2007 due to weather related variable hydro-
electric output, causing increased use of 
thermal units and high operating costs, 
among other factors. This infrastructure def-
icit reduces the potential of local firms to 
grow and create jobs, and this is true in par-
ticular for firms that operate outside Free 
Trade Zones (FTZs). In addition, the coun-
try needs to improve its waste management 
and clean energy production capabilities to 
be able to reduce GHG emissions, and water 
and soil pollution. Infrastructure improve-
ment poses a number of tradeoffs, including 
the need to intervene in protected areas (in 
the case of clean energy production), as well 
as the need to control the current fiscal defi-
cit. Given the necessity of continuing to in-
vest in infrastructure, and the reality of fiscal 
constraints, Costa Rica must look for options 

for private sector participation in the main-
tenance and upgrading of its infrastructure.
Both growth and inclusion would benefit 
from the many complementarities involved 
in improving education, competitiveness, 
and infrastructure. A well-educated work-
force with relevant skills is fundamental for 
sustaining economic growth and increasing 
productivity. In parallel, closing the educa-
tion gap between the poor and non-poor is 
also highly relevant for inclusion by provid-
ing opportunities those in the bottom 
40 percent. Lowering the costs of doing busi-
ness will boost competitiveness across vari-
ous sectors. Furthermore, increasing 
infrastructure spending would stimulate 
construction, thereby creating more jobs for 
the large stock of low-skilled workers.
At the same time, actions are needed to 
ensure the sustainability of Costa Rica’s 
 development model:

•	 Fiscal Sustainability: Improving the fiscal 
stance to restore sustainability requires 
reforms to manage expenditures and 
increase revenues. On the expenditure 
front, these include containing the wage 
bill of the consolidated public sector, as 
public sector wages, both in government 
and more so in state-owned enterprises 
and other public institutions, are well 
above the private sector at all employ-
ment categories; and reviewing the fiscal 
sustainability of the pension system, 
particularly of special pension regimes 
in the public sector. In addition, a com-
prehensive reform of the budgetary 
process is needed to increase efficiency 
and transparency in all public sector 
entities. Finally, curtailing the earmark-
ing of revenues, which cover more than 
half of primary spending, would make 

Priority Areas, Linkages, and Complementarities 

139

•	

the budgetary process more flexible. 
Comprehensive reforms are also needed 
to increase revenues. For example, the 
1,259 tax exemptions approved since 
1953 that comprise almost six percent 
of GDP need to be thoroughly reviewed. 
Curtailing those exemptions would 
make the tax system more rational and 
progressive, as well as produce higher 
revenues. This reform is essential for 
restoring sustainability to the fiscal ac-
counts, which is a necessary condition 
for achieving Costa Rica’s economic and 
social objectives.
Social Sustainability : In addition to 
strengthening education, priority areas 
for sustaining the Social Compact in-
cluding health and social protection. 
Costa Rica needs to modernize its uni-
versal health system to improve quality 
by : (i) strengthening the health care 
model to enhance capacity to adapt 
to demographic and epidemiological 
change while ensuring quality and 
timeliness of service deliver y ; (ii) im-
proving the financial model of budget 
and resource allocation; and (iii) im-
proving the management model for the 
health system for accountability, effi-
ciency, and performance. The countr y 
also needs to increase the effectiveness 
of social protection programs by (i) har-
monizing eligibility criteria and social 
information systems; (ii) improving 
performance monitoring and evalu-
ation; and (iii) reducing institutional 
and program fragmentation.
•	 Environmental Sustainability: To sustain 
its celebrated “Green Trademark,” Costa 
Rica needs to balance environmental 
and natural resource management goals, 
by : (i) reviewing the sustainability of 

the PES mechanism for conservation; 
(ii)  modernizing water and solid waste 
treatment (infrastructure, service de-
livery, regulatory framework, capacity); 
(iii) increasing the supply of renewable 
energy by making regulations on the use 
of protected areas more flexible; (iv) im-
plementing a comprehensive transport 
policy, including measures to reduce 
growth of demand for energy  associated 
with transport; (v) reinforcing regulation 
and oversight of agro-chemical use and 
incentivizing the expansion of “green” 
(organic) agriculture; and (vi) improving 
territorial planning, land management, 
and management of natural and man-
made disasters.

Governance. Progress in all the priority areas 
discussed above hinges on improving the ca-
pacity of the public sector to plan and imple-
ment policies, execute public investment 
projects, deliver services, and increase account-
ability. Despite Costa Rica’s good governance 
levels compared to the rest of the LAC region, 
there is a growing perception of low effective-
ness of government institutions. Cumbersome 
regulations, in many cases resulting from lack 
of coordination among institutions, make the 
process of starting and running a business— 
particularly a non-FTZ small or medium en-
terprise—more challenging. Low levels of 
transparency and accountability lower the effi-
ciency of public spending. The current political 
landscape, where political minorities have the 
power to delay votes, further reduces the mar-
gin for approving and implementing needed 
reforms. The need to improve governance is 
apparent in all priority areas, for instance by 
increasing accountability in the education sec-
tor (e.g., by tracking student achievement to 
reward teacher and school performance). 

140 

Priority Areas, Linkages, and Complementarities

Employment creation would benefit from 
streamlining business regulations as well as the 
public procurement and investment processes 
to improve infrastructure. A more consoli-
dated budget, fewer tax exemptions, and more 
control over spending by autonomous institu-
tions could greatly help to reduce the current 
fiscal deficit, and would improve the capacity 
to monitor results of public spending. In turn, 
results-based management would help to boost 
the efficiency of public spending, for example, 
enforcing the use of common information sys-
tems and modernizing the M&E frameworks 
in the social sectors.

An agenda for knowledge. Finally, 
a number of knowledge gaps need to be 
filled to inform better policy decisions. Al-
though there is a large and productive re-
search and policy analysis community 
studying Costa Rica, there are a few issues 
where having further research and data col-
lection would provide more information to 
help design more concrete policy reforms to 

tackle the issues presented above. For exam-
ple, the specific factors driving secondary 
dropout are still not well understood. In the 
labor market, it is not clear whether the con-
traction of employment in agriculture, man-
ufacturing and construction is of a cyclical 
or structural nature, and this has important 
implications for low-skilled unemployment. 
Like wise, although there are strong signs that 
reservation wages are high, there could be 
more studies to quantify this phenomenon 
better. To improve the efficiency of the pub-
lic sector, it is crucial to identify the specific 
governance bottlenecks in executing infra-
structure projects, as well as their cost impli-
cations. Also, the articulation mechanisms to 
improve the effectiveness of social programs 
need to be based on a thorough institutional 
mapping of social programs. Finally, envi-
ron mental conservation needs to be better 
linked with economic activity, and a key 
knowledge gap in this regard is how to link 
sustainable production and rural landscapes 
to conservation.

Appendix A: Team Engagement and 
Consultation Process

The Systematic Country Diagnostic 
(SCD) core team followed a highly inclusive 
process in the development of the final prod-
uct and the elaboration of the diagnostics. In 
this appendix, the collaborative steps fol-
lowed towards the preparation of the draft 
document are detailed.

Team collaboration steps within 
the World Bank Group

March 2014—Initial Country Team brain-
storming: The initial task team organized a 
half-day country team meeting to discuss the 
guidelines for SCD and to consult on an 
initial power-point on key challenges for 
adequate growth, inclusive growth, and 
sus tainable growth.
April 21, 2014—Concept Note Review 
Meeting: The review meeting took place with 
a concept note that laid out the rationale, 
objectives, and approach for the task, as well 
as the work plan going forward. Some back-
ground papers were commissioned after the 
concept note review.
August/September 2014—Formulation of 
hypotheses: The SCD preparation process 
started with the formulation of a set of 10 
general hypotheses around key areas for 
Costa Rica’s growth and poverty reduction 
patterns based on the review of the literature. 
The country team and key specialists in 
specific areas provided feedback and com-
ments on their validity as well as additional 
information to substantiate, refine, or change 
these hypotheses, or to dismiss them.

September/October 2014—Brainstorming 
sessions: the SCD team held two broad 
brainstorming sessions in which the partici-
pants discussed: (i) the revised hypotheses 
and proposed means of analyzing the know-
ledge gaps; and (ii) a draft of the overall SCD 
storyline that translated the hypotheses into a 
full structure around growth, inclusiveness, 
and sustainability following the SCD 
guidelines.
October/November 2014—Bilateral 
consultations: Several rounds of bilateral 
consultations with sectorial teams were held 
to focus on the remaining knowledge gaps 
that could be filled prior to the elaboration of 
the overall storyline.
December 2014—Quality Enhancement 
Review : Chaired by the Latin American and 
Caribbean (LAC) Chief Economist, the 
Quality Enhancement Review allowed the 
SCD team to received feedback on the 
storyline from peer reviewers.
February 2015—Prioritization work-
shop: A facilitated workshop with the broad 
Costa Rica Team was held with the objec-
tive of soliciting inputs on identified prio-
rity areas for growth, inclusion, and 
sustainability. Key constraints and solution 
areas were identified for each priority area. 
The discussion revolved around how to 
simplify the list of priority areas and which 
priorities were considered but discarded. At 
the end, there was consensus on the cross- 
cutting nature of the proposed priority 
areas, and some of them could be combined

to provide a better entry point with the 
government counterparts.
March 2015—Regional Operation 
Committee Decision Meeting: Chaired by 
the LAC Vice President, the Decision 
Meeting provided further feedback and 
guidance to the team.

Engagement with Costa Rica

The SCD preparation was accompanied by a 
consultation process in Costa Rica to ensure 
that key stakeholders provided inputs into 
the deliberations and shared early findings. 

A preparation mission was conducted during 
September 22–26, in which the SCD team 
participated in the “Encerrona” event orga-
nized with the counterparts in Costa Rica to 
discuss the World Bank engagement. The 
SCD team held meetings with counterparts 
in Costa Rica from the government, private 
sector, academia, and think tanks to get their 
views on the poverty and inequality trends, 
as well as on the growth pattern of Costa 
Rica. Two more consultation missions were 
carried out in November 2014 and January 
2015.

Appendix B: Country Comparators

To benchmark Costa Rica’s performance, 
this report uses six comparable groups of 
peers: Central American countries, Latin 
American peers, upper-middle-income 
countries, the average for the World, struc-
tural peers, and aspirational peers. 
Organisation for Economic Co-operation 
and Development (OECD) countries are 
used as “aspirational peers” given Costa 
Rica’s ongoing accession talks to the OECD. 
The structural peers were selected using the 
“Find your friends” tool.
The group of structural peers includes 
countries that provide appropriate bench-
marks for answering SCD-relevant questions 
such as whether or not certain conditions, 
policies, or economic performances in Costa 
Rica are adequate. The criteria and filters for 
selection were the following: (i) GDP per 
capita between US$5,500 and US$15,500, as 
Costa Rica is an upper-middle-income 
country ; (ii) population between 2.5 million 
and 20 million people; (iii) CO2 emissions: 
Costa Rica is one of the most environmen-
tally sustainable countries in the world, and 
only countries with less than 5 CO2 metric 

tons emissions (the world average) per capita 
were included in the selection process; (iv) 
geography, which often determines compara-
tive advantage and in some cases historical 
similarities; landlocked econo mies and small 
island states were excluded, while several 
Central American countries were included; 
and (v) only non-fragile states were selected. 
The use of these criteria resulted in the 
following set of countries: Chile, Croatia, 
Dominican Republic, Lithuania, Panama, 
and Uruguay.

Costa RiCa stands out foR being among the most politiCally stable, progressive, prosperous, and environmentally 
conscious nations in the Latin America and the Caribbean region. Its development model has brought impor-
tant economic, social, and environmental dividends, with sustained growth, upward mobility for a large 
share of the population, important gains in social indicators, and significant achievements in reforestation 
and conservation. However, there are a number of development challenges that need to be addressed to 
maintain the country’s successful development path. This Systematic Country Diagnostic takes stock of 
the  poverty, inequality, and growth trends, addressing the following questions: 

•	 To what extent has the Costa Rican development model been inclusive? 
•	 What has driven growth in Costa Rica in recent years, and what are the bottlenecks that need to be 
addressed? 
•	 How sustainable is the development model of Costa Rica economically, socially, and environmentally?
