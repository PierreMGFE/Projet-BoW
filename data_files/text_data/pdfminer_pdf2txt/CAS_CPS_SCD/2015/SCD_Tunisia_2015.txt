Tunisia: sysTemaTic counTry DiagnosTicExecutive Summary

Context

The Tunisia Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD) seeks to identify the challenges and opportunities to 
achieve the twin goals of reducing poverty and boosting shared prosperity in a sustainable way. This SCD 

takes into account Tunisia’s historical sociopolitical context and the political economy of past reforms to pro-
vide the context for the challenges and opportunities that exist today to make progress toward the twin goals. 
The economic policies of the two decades preceding the 2011 revolution delivered widely recognized achieve-
ments, including growth rates above the regional average, impressive progress in human development indicators 
and reduced poverty. However, they failed to address, and even exacerbated, the deep-rooted distortions in the 
economy that closed the channels—in particular, productive employment and job creation—for a more equal 
and inclusive society. These distortions were also grounded in a tightly controlled social and political space that 
favored the elite while repressing others. This development model proved to be economically and socially unsus-
tainable. With a new constitution adopted in 2014 and a democratically-elected government established in 2015, 
there is today an unprecedented window of opportunity for Tunisia to embark on deep structural reforms to open 
the channels conducive to a more equal and inclusive society and put the country on a path of more sustainable 
development. The SCD identifies key opportunities to build on Tunisia’s multiple strengths and economic po-
tential to help guide future development policies. It highlights the importance of social and political stability (as 
well as domestic security) as prerequisites for critical reforms to be undertaken, as well as the importance of voice, 
transparency, and accountability in all economic and institutional spheres for those reforms to be sustainable.

An Economic “Success” Story hindered by Social and Economic Exclusion

Tunisia’s economic policies over the two decades preceding the revolution delivered widely recognized 

achievements. One of the first countries in the region to embark on early structural reforms that contributed 
to the successful economic performance since mid-1990s, Tunisia saw in parallel significant progress in social 
and human development indicators. In the two decades prior to 2011, the country benefitted from growth 
rates1 above the regional average, sustained progress in access to primary education (today almost universal) 

1 Real GDP grew at an average of 5 percent yearly between 1995 and 2008. Growth was mainly driven by large public investment 
and strong domestic demand, coupled with more dynamic exports and a sharp increase in FDI inflows. Tunisia also benefitted 
from an improved macroeconomic management since the 1990s, when a first wave of structural reforms started. Strengthened 
management of monetary and fiscal policies allowed containing the fiscal deficit (lower than 3 percent of GDP between 2000 and 
2008) and inflation, safeguarding in this way most of the real purchasing power of the poor.

and health care, and a tremendous reduction in overall poverty incidence, which was halved in the decade 
between 2000 and 2010.2 As of today, Tunisia remains one of the most progressive countries in MENA in 
terms of women rights and female emancipation.3 

The very same policies, however, failed to generate inclusive growth in its most comprehensive sense. 

Economic progress was often seen as the main priority in the several development plans that followed since 
independence4 while socio-political stability was frequently obtained at the price of denied civil liberties and 
political freedom. High economic growth and a generous and committed (especially in straining circum-
stances) social policy5 were the foundations of the unwritten social contract between the state and its citizens, 
which promised to deliver socio-economic development and welfare. The gains in welfare would compensate 
for the lack of basic civil liberties and political freedom. The vast majority of the population was excluded 
from active social, political and economic engagement. The pre-revolution Tunisia was labeled “not free” by 
the international observers and think tanks: Freedom House reported the lack of guaranteed freedom of as-
sociation and the fact that citizens’ participation in the elections was purely nominal; Global Integrity ratings 
indicate that Tunisia was one of the most repressive regimes in the world in terms of media freedom. The 
lack of adequate participation, transparency, and accountability in the management of public affairs,6 which 
reached its peak during the decade preceding the revolution, undermined the economy’s ability to take off and 
bring prosperity and good jobs to all.

Economic and social exclusion eventually prevented the country from joining the path of a strengthened 

and sustainable economic growth. Tunisia’s growth performance, although good compared to its regional 
peers, was substantially weaker than other upper middle-income countries, particularly from 2000 to 2010. 
Tunisia’s economy grew at about 3.4 percent per year in real per capita terms between 1990 and 2010 and 
was the second fastest growing country in the MENA region since 1990. Nevertheless, other upper middle-
income countries (U-MICs) on average grew at 1.5 times that speed over the last decade. Well-performing U-
MICs such as China enjoyed double-digit growth over the same period. Unlike many of its peers Tunisia did 
not experience an economic take off during the past two decades. This diagnostic argues, based on the most 
recent analytical evidence available, that economic performance has been hindered by a protected regulatory 
environment resulting in lack of competition and large bureaucratic burden, a financial sector hampered by 
governance failures, labor rules that paradoxically promote job insecurity, and industrial, agricultural, and 
natural resources management policies that introduce distortions and deepen regional disparities.

2 Poverty rates (based on a national poverty line estimated at 1,077 dinars in 2010, date of the most recent poverty survey which 
amount roughly to $3.42 per day (2005 PPP). Based on a $2 per day poverty line, poverty rates stand at 4.3 percent.
3 Tunisia has been at the forefront in the Arab World in terms of legal reforms relating to women’s equal status and protection under 
the law. In the 1990s, a series of legislative reforms accorded greater rights to women in personal status, civil status, employment 
opportunities and family law. Women have equal citizenship rights to men and have the right to vote and to be elected into of-
fice. They also have equal rights in marriage, divorce, custody, and ownership of property, including land, even though this right 
is rarely exercised in practice. Furthermore, the law protects women’s personal security: violence against women is a crime and 
punishable by law. Finally, a 2002 amendment to the nationality law gives women married to foreign citizens the right to pass on 
their nationality to their children.

6 Global Financial Integrity estimated that the amount of illegal money lost from Tunisia due to corruption, bribery, kickbacks, 
trade mispricing, and criminal activity between 2000 and 2008 was, on average, approximately two percent of GDP per year (ap-
proximately US$1.2 billion per annum). With a population of approximately 10.6 million that means a loss of almost $110 per 
person per year in the unrecorded transfers of illegal capital (Global Financial Integrity 2011).

A slower pace of growth has important consequences on the ability to contain poverty and increase 

shared prosperity. Shared prosperity is strongly correlated with overall prosperity. This would mean that poli-
cies that are important to generate and sustain growth remain relevant and a necessary condition to achieve 
progress toward the twin goals. In Tunisia, despite the overall reduction in poverty rates, the probability for 
many households to fall into poverty remains substantial. The bottom 40 percent has one chance in four of 
falling into poverty. The revised poverty estimates show that in 2010 almost two million people remained in 
impoverished conditions, half a million of which were below the extreme poverty line. Preliminary analysis 
of the poverty trends7 shows also how the gains realized in the past decade remain fragile. For instance, many 
households’ consumption levels in 2010 remain just above the poverty threshold, making them very vulner-
able to exogenous shocks, such as employment loss or hikes in the prices of essential goods. 

Wide regional disparities have persisted and even increased during the past decade. Though there is less 

inequality in consumption expenditures within regions, the gap between regions has widened. In 2010 pov-
erty rates ranged from a low rate of 8–9 percent in the Center East region and Grand Tunis to a high of 26 
and 32 percent in the North West and Center West regions respectively. Extreme poverty has become more 
concentrated than before: the poorest region of the country, namely the Center-West, was in 2010 home to 
more than 40 percent of the extreme poor living in the country. Despite substantial progress in increasing ac-
cess to basic services and infrastructure in Tunisia in the decade prior to the revolution, substantial disparities 
(across space and socio-economic and demographic characteristics) persist in access to, and quality of, basic 
infrastructure and services provided by local and central governments. The pre-revolutionary centralized gov-
ernance structure stifled accountability and social equality. Despite the importance of country’s cities (roughly 
70 percent of the country’s eleven million citizens live in towns and cities, accounting for a significant portion 
of country’s national income), Tunisian local governments have had few responsibilities, did not have mean-
ingful decision-making powers, and did not have a real connection with their citizens. The highly centralized 
oversight system of “tutelle” which subjected elected local governments to central government administrative 
supervision, and required central government approval for key local government mandates has sharply con-
strained service delivery on the ground, deterioration in municipal services and prevented the emergence of 
accountability and citizen participation.

Wide spatial and income disparities persist in access to basic services, such as education, transports or 
water and sanitation. Differential access to opportunities translates into unequal human development 

and labor market outcomes. Tunisia has one of the largest rural connectivity deficits in MENA: 39 percent 
rural access compared to a 58 percent average in MENA. Access to public transportation is much lower in the 
interior regions: 87 percent of households in urban Tunis live within a 15 minute walk to the nearest bus sta-
tion and in the North-West and Mid-East, the proportion falls to 54 percent and 65 percent respectively. In 
rural areas, only 55 percent of the population has access to piped water and 52 percent to improved sanitation 
(compared to near universal access in urban areas) and only 55 percent of women have access to at least four 
prenatal visits compared to 75 percent in urban areas.8 Access to education services is also widely unequal be-
tween (and within) regions: more than one fourth of students in the interior governorates of Sidi Bouzid, Kas-
serine, Kairouan, and Siliana are at more than three kilometers from the closest primary school, compared with 
a national average of 12 percent. Those four governorates have the worst access indicators in almost all fronts 
including qualification of teachers, multi-grade classes and internet access.9 Differential access to opportunities

translates into unequal human development and labor market outcomes. While aggregate human development 
indicators improved, progress was limited in remote regions. In rural areas: (i) children are more than twice as 
likely to be stunted (10 percent in rural areas versus four percent urban); (ii) fewer women get prenatal services 
or treatment for high-risk pregnancies; (iii) maternal mortality rates are three times higher (70 versus 20 deaths 
per 100,000 live births); (iv) pupils face higher levels of repetition and drop-outs (20.1 percent repetition and 
12.7 percent drop-outs in Kasserine at the upper secondary level); and (v) levels of unemployment ranged in 
2013 from 20–22 percent in interior regions to around 7–11 percent in coastal areas).

The way forward Towards a More open, inclusive and Prosperous Society

Significant strides toward a more open, inclusive, and transparent society have been achieved since the 
2011 revolution, laying the foundations for a new social contract embodied in the new 2014 Constitu-

tion. Tunisia successfully implemented a sometimes rocky, but altogether remarkable democratic transition. 
Since the revolution, policies have mainly focused on the most immediate challenges (first and foremost 
combating security threats), while ensuring a most-needed successful democratic transition, thereby leaving 
many of the structural economic and social challenges unaddressed. Boosting shared prosperity will require 
a concerted effort to further strengthen the social contract, particularly in the area of promoting equality of 
opportunity. In the case of Tunisia, this will mean first and foremost re-establishing trust in public institu-
tions and ensuring active citizen participation in political and social affairs. Significant progress has been 
made during the 2011–2014 political transition to strengthen transparency and participation, particularly by 
enhancing civil and political rights as highlighted by the first free and fair elections in the country, increased 
freedom of press and association, easing restrictions on the operations of civil society organizations and other 
associations, and improving economic governance. These major advances in terms of institutional, legislative 
and judicial framework, and the recognition of rights which are now enshrined under the 2014 Constitu-
tion,10 will set the stage for furthering social progress and strengthening opportunities.

Having successfully completed a historical and remarkable democratic transition, Tunisia can now em-
brace an unprecedented opportunity to unlock the economic and institutional reforms necessary to put 
the country on a faster and more inclusive development path. Tunisia, as many middle income countries, 

has made considerable strides in meeting the basic needs of the population (as shown in the improvement 
of human development indicators). However, the need to strengthen the link between growth and social 
progress, notably through the channel of more and higher quality employment opportunities, remains an 
imperative and will determine the extent to which Tunisia could embark on a more robust, sustainable, and 
inclusive growth path. Advances in terms of citizens’ participation and agency, and improved governance in 
the economy and in the society at large would in fact unleash the potential for higher growth thanks to a more 
dynamic private sector, higher productivity and innovation and a more efficient public sector, all enhancing 
human and social capital. The opening of the political and social space brought by the new democratic set-
ting offers an unprecedented opportunity to build on a participative social and economic dialogue to identify 
channels to strengthen the link between growth, welfare, and citizen participation. This dialogue, conducted 

10 The new Constitution recognizes the right of access to information as a prerequisite for transparency and accountability of the 
government, allowing citizens to make informed choices, and safeguarding them against mismanagement and corruption. It also 
strives to guarantee that adequate check and balance processes are in place. Among its main achievements, the new Constitution 
preserves and further guarantees women’s rights and equality of female and male citizens and confirming the right to conscious and 
limits the parliament in restricting freedoms and fundamental rights, especially through the newly created constitutional court.

by domestic stakeholders with the technical support of international partners as needed, will reinforce the 
design and implementation of policies to deliver higher growth and inclusion.

Substantial and timely action is now required to trigger the structural transformation of Tunisia’s econ-
omy, which would ensure sustained, sustainable, and inclusive growth. Growing evidence suggests that 

improving access to economic opportunities and social services and tackling disparities are not only about 
“fairness” and building a “just society,” but also about realizing a society’s aspirations of economic prosperity. 
Progress toward increased and shared prosperity will depend on whether or not specific groups can participate 
in, and benefit from, economic growth. The extent of real and perceived inclusion can have significant impacts 
on overall sustainability. Strengthening the social pact that weaves together all Tunisians, a primary challenge 
of the post-transition period, will be therefore another crucial prerequisite and condition to the long-term 
sustainability of the desired inclusive economic model. However, while reinforcing security for citizens and 
businesses will continue to be a major policy focus in the medium-term, deep structural reforms, including 
promoting value creation and innovation, and continuing to dismantle undue economic rents and privileges, 
remain crucial to enabling a lasting economic recovery, and to join the path of upper MICs in other regions, 
which have performed much better than Tunisia over the past two decades. These reforms would need to tap 
on the country’s underlying capabilities and realign incentives to facilitate sustained and inclusive growth. In 
this context, this Systematic Country Diagnostic identifies the promotion of private-sector- driven growth 
(and job creation) and the improvement of equality of opportunities as the two key drivers of change where 
it is advisable to decisive policy initiatives. 

Tunisia Systematic Country Diagnostic

This Systematic Country Diagnostic identifies some key areas where opportunities that build on Tuni-
sia’s multiple strengths arise, which could help guide the future development policies of the country. The 

SCD is meant to support preparation of the upcoming Country Partnership Framework (CPF) 2015–2020 
for Tunisia. The diagnostic has been placed in the country’s historical socio-political and geographic context to 
better understand the political economy of past reforms and future opportunities. To seize these opportunities 
a (non-exhaustive) platform for reforms actions to address some of the most binding constraints to growth 
and inclusion is presented in this diagnostic, based on the strength and depth of their potential development 
impact in the medium term, but with a view also to the long term development goals of the country. The 
feasibility of implementation as well as the conditions in place for the sustainability of reforms are taken into 
account—together with the results of the technical analysis—in the identification and selection of areas where 
opportunities for advancement toward the goals are most compelling. The next sections summarize the main 
areas where the SCD sees Tunisia’s strengths and opportunities, and where ongoing reforms or dialogue on 
reforms would sustain progress toward more inclusive growth and a new development model.

Sustain reforms of the business Environment to Stimulate Productive investment and 
Prevent Elite Capture in the future

Government regulations, actions and monopolies in Tunisia are distortive of market development and 

generate unintended barriers to competition. Contestability of markets is weak given significant barriers to 
entry (especially legal and administrative measures), widespread pricing policies and restrictive practices. Per-
vasive restrictions to the number of firms allowed to operate in the market are coupled with many legal (pub-
lic) monopolies and undue regulatory constraints in network sectors, severely limiting competition. In fact, 

xviii

sectors in which investment faces restrictions account for over 50 percent of the Tunisian economy, whether 
through the Investment Incentives Code, the Competition Law or specific sectoral legislation. Many of these 
sectors at present remain de facto closed to competition. In addition, there are legal constraints on the sale of 
the stakes held by the government in publicly controlled firms in some of these sectors.11

The widespread lack of competition has far reaching implications for the performance of the economy. 

Firms in these sectors de facto benefit from rents that arise because they face limited competition. These firms 
remain profitable largely thanks to the protection they enjoy in the domestic market—at the expense of the 
consumers who are forced to buy more expensive and lower quality goods produced by the uncompetitive 
onshore firms—further reducing investment and productivity. The Competition Law does not in fact support 
competition and the weak governance of SOEs further undermines the operations of markets. Beyond the 
measurable direct and indirect costs that the heavy regulatory and bureaucratic burden imposes on firms, there 
is a significant issue related to how policies and regulations are applied today. This problem appears to be most 
prevalent in the administration of both customs and tax, suggesting these services require significant regulatory 
simplification reform (aiming to reduce the room for discretion). Discretionary implementation of customs 
regulations and tariff evasion results in an estimated annual revenue loss of at least US$100 million (approxi-
mately 0.15 percent of GDP). Moreover, import-monopolists (i.e. firms that are the only firms that import 
particular products) on average underreport in the magnitude of 131 percent relative to firms that are not.

Reforms in the business environment have great potential for growth, job creation, and ultimately in-

clusion. Removing the barriers to entry and competition would substantially improve the performance of 
the Tunisian economy and boost the ability of the most productive firms to grow and create good quality 
jobs, thereby contributing to the establishment of a genuine “economic democracy” where entrepreneurs ac-
cess resources on the basis of the merits of their projects. This is the time where the socio-political space for 
this type of reform is open and therefore the opportunity to advance is the greatest. The removal of barriers 
to market competition would open up investment in these sectors, and should start with backbone services 
sectors, which were the most shielded from competition in the past, and sectors with high potential for jobs 
creation, notably commerce and telecommunications. 

The gains from heightened competition in Tunisia would be considerable and result in faster jobs cre-

ation. There is ample empirical evidence internationally on the substantial benefits of allowing greater compe-
tition. The empirical analysis presented in the 2014 Tunisia DPR found that a five percentage point decrease 
in firms’ profit margins (driven by greater competition) would translate into additional GDP growth of 
around 4.5 percent per year and approximately 50,000 new jobs per year. Since the 2011 revolution, impor-
tant measures have been taken to enhance competition and promote a level playing field. For instance, a draft 
competition law that reinforces the role and independence of the Competition Council is under consideration 
and is expected to be adopted in 2015. The Council can play a key role in stimulating competitive forces to 
the benefit of consumers, including lifting barriers that may be preventing retail and wholesale prices from 
falling toward their competitive levels. Similarly, revisions of the Investment Code—whose draft is currently 
under review- will be crucial to re-align incentives and dramatically improve the investment climate. Key re-
forms are being undertaken at the sector level, for instance in telecommunications, to allow for more service 

11 Network sectors such as gas and electricity; water mobilization, treatment, and distribution; and rail transport (infrastructure 
operation, passenger and freight transport) as well as other sectors such as the tobacco supply chain are legal/state monopolies. 
In these same sectors, regulatory barriers to international telecommunications and air transport entail de facto monopolies or 
oligopolies. Even segments of markets in gas, transport, and telecoms where private sector participation is feasible are closed in 
Tunisia compared to comparator countries.

providers to be able to enter the markets. Other important areas of reform to improve the investment climate 
include tax reform, the alleviation of the regulatory burden, the fight against corruption and the accelera-
tion of public infrastructure programs, notably through the increased recourse to public-private partnerships 
(PPPs) in infrastructure. 

An open and engaged public-private dialogue should accompany deeper regulatory reforms. However, 

many of the regulations and practices that create market power rents still exist and many companies continue 
to benefit from them. A drastic simplification of the pool of regulations hindering private sector activity with a 
view to reducing the room for discretion in their implementation is critical for a private sector-driven growth 
and ultimately inclusion. Moving forward, it will be crucial to build on a strong public-private sector dialogue 
on regulatory reform and develop tools to ensure that existing and new regulations are fit for the purpose and 
serve the public and private interests.12 

Develop and implement a National financial Sector Strategy to increase Economic 
opportunities

Access to finance remains underdeveloped at both household and firms levels in Tunisia. According to 

Findex data,13 fewer than five percent of adults save at a formal financial institution although 25 percent save 
informally and 32 percent report has access to an account at a bank or the post. The non-salaried population, 
despite being very large,14 is not served by financial institutions. The reliance on informal financial services 
also suggests that the supply of financial services targeted to the poor is not adapted to financial needs, leav-
ing a significant market gap. Access to finance was indicated as a major constraint by 34 percent of Tunisian 
firms, the second highest leaving aside concerns about political and macro uncertainty (which are exacerbated 
in the post-revolution transition phase)

The banking sector suffers from a severe lack of competition, despite a large number of banks. The Tu-

nisian financial sector is small and dominated by banks, with assets equal to about 115 percent of GDP. The 
Tunisian banking system is characterized by limited profitability, inefficiency, low credit intermediation, and 
significant vulnerabilities. The absence of long term refinancing resources for banks mainly through capital 
markets limits long-term domestic lending and impacts credit affordability. As a result, financial deepening 
has been limited over the past decade and remains well below potential, the performance of the loan portfo-
lio is very weak and increasingly poses a risk to the stability of the financial system, and progress in product

13 According to Findex 2011, about 32 percent of adults in Tunisia have access to an account (39 percent among men and 25 percent 
among women; and 26 percent among young adults). This level of financial inclusion is higher than regional 18 percent level 
(13 percent for women and 13 percent for young adults), however it is lower than the average H-MIC level of 57 percent (53 per-
cent for women and 49 percent for young adults). The access to accounts is significantly lower among women, young adults, 
rural population and population with primary or less education; the access to account among these groups are 25–26 percent in 
Tunisia. It compares favorably to MENA benchmarks for these categories; however, in the other U-MICs these indicators are at 
about 50 percent or more on average. Only 16 percent of those in the bottom 40 percent of income have access to accounts, which 
is worse than any other groups (youth, women, rural, etc.) taken separately. The benchmark for U-MICs is 42 percent for this 
category, and it shows that the access to accounts for bottom 40 percent is very non-inclusive.

innovation and quality service has generally been low. The low level of competition in the banking sector 
appears due to an environment fraught with weak regulatory practices, and substantial failures in the corpo-
rate governance of, in particular, state owned banks (SOBs). In addition, inadequate bankruptcy procedures 
enable inefficient firms to survive (instead of having to restructure or exit), therefore (and to the advantage 
of the less productive units) slowing down the success of productive firms and the rechanneling of resources 
toward more productive uses

Nonbank financial institutions could play an important role in providing credit, savings, and insurance 
services (among other financial services) to segments of households and firms not traditionally served 

by banks but development has so far been limited. The non-bank financial sector accounts for around 
20 percent of financial systems assets in Tunisia. Tunisia has a small insurance sector, with 19 companies pri-
marily focused on nonlife activities (85 percent of premiums) and annual premiums to GDP of about 2 per-
cent. The equity and fixed-income markets are still small, with a market capitalization equal to 24 percent of 
GDP, lower than in regional peer countries such as jordan (112 percent) and Morocco (76 percent). Private 
equity remains small and the leasing sector, accounted for 15.5 percent of private gross fixed capital forma-
tion in 2010.15 Flaws in the institutional, legal, and regulatory framework prevent greater growth of NBFIs, 
instruments, and markets

Improving access to financial services for both households and firms is critical to catalyzing private sec-
tor development, improving access to essential services increasing economic opportunities for the most 

vulnerable.16 Strengthening access to credit for firms, particularly those with no credit history and limited 
collateral (mostly MSMEs and startups), and developing alternative sources of financing, will enable resources 
to be channeled to the most productive projects and allow companies to expand and invest productively.17 
Some programs to improve access to finance for high value added exports have been already implemented, 
with support of the WBG.18 There is indeed opening for additional support and instruments to be tested with 
a sector-specific focus and with a more inclusive lens (for instance focusing to address regional disparities in 
access to finance). To improve the efficiency of the banking system and competition within the sector, the 
most compelling reforms should focus on the restructuring and/or privatization of state owned banks (SOBs), 
strictly enforcing bank regulations, and revising procedures to deal with banks in financial difficulty. 

At the household level, increasing financial inclusion (access to and usage of formal financial services such 
as accounts, consumer and housing finance, and insurance) is critical to support access to basic services 
(housing, education, etc.), spur income generation and employment as well as help manage economic 

shocks. Financial inclusion is also positively correlated with financial stability and greater efficiency of financial 
intermediation, both important pre-requisites for job creation and private sector development. Further reform 
and expansion of the microfinance sector should be pursued together with the development of innovative finan-
cial instruments and approaches to cater the needs for non-salaried and low-income households. The develop-
ment of a national financial sector strategy and its immediate implementation represents a clear opportunity to 
determine a feasible road map of actions to achieve both sector development and stability objectives.

Design and implement Policies to Stimulate growth and Job Creation in Sectors where 
Tunisia holds a Strategic Advantage 

In an effort to modernize past industrial policies, a new type of sector-focused strategic development 
policy coupled with reforms to incentivize formal employment would support the structural transfor-
mation of the economy and advance progress toward a more inclusive growth.19 The government can 

play an active role in the development of high potential sectors through enabling the investment climate 
by correcting sector-specific regulatory and coordination failures. Policies to improve the overall business 
environment could be complemented with targeted interventions aiming to create jobs in specific sector and 
regions. Indeed, as discussed in this diagnostic, higher investments alone do not necessarily guarantee that the 
economy will create the jobs needed to improve the opportunities and standards of living of all Tunisians. It 
is important, therefore, that the government, in close consultation with concerned stakeholders (private sec-
tor, labor organizations) also identifies sectoral policies geared to stimulate investment and employment. This 
implies mapping key sub-sectors and value chains within the economy to understand the potential for job 
creation and the types of bottlenecks and regulatory failures that would need to be removed to achieve it. This 
mapping would provide information about the types and level of investments that are necessary, the quantity 
of jobs that can be created, their composition in terms of skills, and their regional distribution.

These policies will need to be accompanied by reforms to remove “horizontal” constraints to employ-
ability. Strengthening the quality and availability of skills for the private sectors would address a key con-
straint for the private sector and contribute to increase competitiveness of Tunisian firms. Lack of adequate 

skills is considered a leading constraint20 for firms in the private sector and should be taken into consideration 
in the mapping of strategic sectors and, more widely in any comprehensive jobs strategy. In addition to the 
quality of education, the relevance of graduates’ skills is crucial for employability. At present, a serious skills 
mismatch, together with low quality of educational outcomes, prevents a full utilization of the human capital. 
The skills and competencies acquired by graduates do not seem aligned with those in demand by the private 
sector. For instance, about 63 percent of all students enrolled in tertiary education institutions in the academic 
year 2010/11 were in the fields of humanities and social sciences. Such skills, however, are not very attractive 
in sectors where employment demand for graduates is highest, such as health, ICT, agro/industrial, financial 
services and telecommunications. Strengthening the quality and relevance of education at all levels—a medium 
to long term agenda but that can be tackled also in the short term with appropriate and targeted programs—will 
alleviate a key binding constraint highlighted by the private sector, and significantly increase competitiveness.

Reforms to consolidate social insurance regimes and align labor regulations will also incentivize formal 

employment and better protect living standards. In terms of social insurance, greater harmonization among 
private and public sector regimes, improving portability, enhancing the governance and management of social 
security schemes, and aligning financing with benefits more explicitly will help to improve incentives for job 
creation, sustainability, and coverage. In terms of labor regulations, curbing the growth of labor costs,21 while 
improving income protection and services to workers would go hand in hand with social insurance reforms. 
Employment protection legislation plays a critical role in shielding workers from the negative consequences

than sectors.

of arbitrary actions by employers, and facilitates industrial stability along with the build-up of firm-specific 
human capital and innovation. When employment protection and contracting is too rigid, however, firms’ 
ability to respond quickly to changes in technology or market demand in terms of hiring or retraining is 
hampered. Moving forward, it is important to accompany the targeted investment policies with the flexibility 
of employment policies, as well as better targeted Active Labor Market Policies (ALMPs), that are crucial for 
efficient job reallocation, greater job creation, and economic growth. Strengthening inclusive social dialogue 
will help support the development of an integrated social protection and labor system needed to achieve the 
right balance between flexibility and security. 

use the Social Dialogue to Catalyze the Adoption and implementation of More Effective 
Social Assistance Policies and That will improve the Equity and Efficiency of Social 
Assistance Programs

More rational targeting of universal price subsidies and social safety nets will improve equity and fiscal 
space needed to jump-start graduation programs to productive livelihoods. Strengthening Tunisia’s social 

safety net system is a necessary complement to pro-growth reforms in order to effectively protect the poor 
and vulnerable from unforeseen shocks, and maintain purchasing power and living standards. As is the case 
in other countries of the region, the current excessive outlay on untargeted subsidies fails to reach the poorest 
and paradoxically largely benefits the better off, thus exacerbating inequality. Existing cash transfer and health 
cards programs, which benefit some of the poor, can be better targeted by further developing the recently 
conceived unique identification system for all social protection and labor programs and introducing exit strat-
egies to ensure equitable access and transition to work for the able-bodied. Combined with the fiscal deficits 
facing the social security system (pensions and health insurance), inadequate coverage and sustainability of 
social protection programs highlight the need for comprehensive reform beginning in the near term. The new 
“Social Contract” signed between the Government and social partners in 2013 shows the commitment of the 
Government to developing the policy dialogue on important reforms such as labor regulations, social security 
reform, subsidy reform, social assistance reform, reform of employment programs, and investment policies 
targeting lagging regions. Further steps in this direction (as already demonstrated by the progress on the social 
protection reforms with the development of a unified social registry and a unique identification system with 
a link to the national identification card) are needed, and are likely to have a significant impact on growth 
and inclusion.

Decentralization as a gateway to increase and Equalize opportunities 

Inclusive growth can be promoted by policies aimed to at addressing spatial inequalities in access to and 
quality of basic services, access to good infrastructure, and more generally targeting institutional failures 

that generate unequal “opportunities.” This diagnostic argues that equal opportunities are a crucial part of 
the “shared prosperity” goal. Increasing parity of access to quality basic services (notably water, health, educa-
tion and municipal services) in lagging areas will improve people’s employment opportunities, their quality of 
life, and ultimately contribute to long-term economic growth. Improving the governance, institutional, and 
regulatory framework to allow both more accountable and efficient services would incentivize investment and 
allow more viable service provision, hence reducing enduring inequality in access and quality across regions.

The government commitment to decentralization could improve provision of services at the local level. 

Despite capital investments in the pre-revolutionary period to support basic infrastructure delivery, municipal

service delivery has been deteriorating in most cities, particularly in lagging regions with significant impacts 
on quality of life, urban environment, public health, as well as on key economic activities such as tourism. 
Both a recent cross-sectoral scorecard undertaken on public services and a pilot municipal opinion survey un-
dertaken in Tunisia showed widespread dissatisfaction with service delivery by municipalities and exceptional-
ly limited engagement of citizens with their municipality. Appropriately, the new Constitution includes clear 
commitments to decentralization, local governance, and empowered local entities as a response to these. The 
provisions of the new Constitution create the framework for fully devolved and empowered local government 
with autonomy for executing their mandates of providing local services according to transparent principles of 
participation by, and accountability to, their electorate.22 The expansion of formal authority of local govern-
ments requires reform of the intergovernmental fiscal transfer system and measures to increase the capabilities 
of local governments including through measurement and public dissemination of local government perfor-
mance. Proper implementation of the decentralization agenda also requires the central government agencies 
to be restructured and transformed, to move them away from a role of control to a role of coordinator and 
enabler. Over time, these measures are designed to lead to better provision of services and infrastructure and 
improved governance in part through greater accountability of local governments to their electorate and to 
the central government

Sustainability of a long Term Development Trajectory

Whether Tunisia can sustain the progress observed in previous years while moving on the path of higher 
and more inclusive growth depends on the extent to which attention is paid to critical socio-political, 

economic, and environmental issues. On all these fronts, emerging issues are overlapping with ongoing 
structural weaknesses and, together, could threaten the effectiveness and impact of identified reforms. There 
are however also new and unique opportunities to move forward and to strengthen the link between specific 
policies and a long-term development vision. Challenges and opportunities to maintain socio-political and 
economic stability are presented below.

Political and Social Stability

Tunisia has suffered from increased instability following the revolution. Restoring and maintaining 

security is key for sustained reforms. Besides the generalized spread of violence in everyday life (increases 
in burglaries, petty crimes, and assaults), there has been an upsurge in explicitly socially, politically, and reli-
giously motivated violence. The unrest intensified during 2013 with the assassination of two prominent op-
position politicians. Although slightly improved in 2014 with installment of a technocratic government and 
the agreement of the new constitution and ultimately with the peaceful conclusions of the elections at end 
2014, the situation has suddenly deteriorated. The brutal terrorist attack in March 2015 in the Bardo area is 
yet another blow at an already fragile security situation. Issues of reforming the police and security services 

22 To this end, the Constitution lays down the mandate for LGs to achieve the following: (i) financial and administrative autonomy; 
(ii) participatory local democracy and open election of municipal representatives; (iii) formal assignment of functions according to 
principles of subsidiarity; (iv) own source revenues and transparent, objective and predictable systems of inter-governmental fiscal 
transfers, including consideration of issues addressing equity, equalization and national policy priorities; (v) governance structures 
that ensure participatory governance and accountability of municipalities to electorates in decision-making and program imple-
mentation; (vi) inter-municipal cooperation in metropolitan areas and (vii) restructuring of the tutelle system to play an ex-post 
rather than an ex-ante oversight role.

will be extremely complex and delicate, and the former have occasionally gone on strike to protest efforts to 
sanction their members. This uncertain security, political, and policy environment has significantly impacted 
investor confidence in Tunisia since the revolution, affecting both domestic and foreign investments. Con-
tinued uncertainty on these fronts will undoubtedly affect the sustainability of Tunisia attracting necessary 
private investment into the country over the coming years.

The volatile regional environment and the difficult security situation, coupled with an economy that 
is still struggling to take off, might contribute to weaken the initial support of the Tunisia popula-

tion for democracy. A recent poll from the Pew Center23 highlights how today only about half of Tunisians 
(48 percent) believe that democracy is preferable to any other kind of government, against a vast majority 
(63 percent) in 2012, soon after the revolution. About a quarter of the respondents replied that in some cir-
cumstances a non-democratic form of government is preferable (26 percent) or that the type of government 
does not matter (24 percent).24 According to the poll, a great part of the public’s discontent is explained by 
the economy. Fully 88 percent describe the country’s economic situation as bad, and 56 percent say it is very 
bad. But a majority is optimistic that the economy will turn around soon: 56 percent expect it to improve in 
the next year. Instability also plays an important role: when asked which is more important, having a demo-
cratic government with some risk of political instability, or a stable government with a risk it will not be fully 
democratic, 62 percent of Tunisians say they prefer stability. This has increased dramatically since 2012 when 
just 38 percent said they would prefer stability to democracy. The toned down enthusiasm and engagement 
is reflected in the voter turnout for the most recent—October 26, 2014—parliamentary elections, where 
participation was estimated at 62 percent of the 5.3 million registered voters. Contrary to some international 
media, which characterized participation as a success, the local feeling is that it is a disappointing turnout, as 
the absolute number of voters is below that of 2011. Reports suggest very weak youth participation, especially 
in the inland/lagging regions.

Despite waning confidence in democracy’s ability to produce results, Tunisians continue to want key 
features of a democratic system, such as a fair judiciary, competitive elections, the right to protest, and 

equal rights for men and women. A strong majority—94 percent—believe that having a judicial system 
that treats everyone in the same way is very important for the country’s future, up 13 points since last year. 
Similarly, 92 percent of Tunisians say having honest, regularly held elections in which people have a choice 
of at least two parties is very important, an increase of 21 percentage points in just a year. Law and order is a 
priority for most Tunisians: 81 percent believe that stability is crucial for Tunisia’s future. More than six-in-ten 
also think that certain freedoms are critical for Tunisia’s future: the freedom to peacefully protest (68 percent), 
equal rights for women (66 percent), freedom to criticize the government (64 percent), and an uncensored 
media (63 percent).

A whole new approach to transparency, media, and civil society will facilitate sustainability of reforms 

by facilitating citizen engagement. The post-revolutionary period has seen an unprecedented expansion of 
free expression. Safeguarding the progress made in protecting fundamental citizens’ rights will be crucial to 

23 The latest survey in Tunisia by the Pew Research Center is based on face-to-face interviews conducted with 1,000 respondents from 
April 19 to May 9, 2014. The poll results were released on October 15, 2014.
24 Findings in Tunisia closely reflect those in Colombia and Thailand, the former in partial transition from conflict and the latter in a 
state of chronic political upheaval. Attitudes in transition countries often reflect the dichotomy of the public’s interest in balancing 
stability with rights and freedoms. In periods of political turmoil citizens may be more willing to trade enhanced rights for greater 
stability. However, without public engagement and pressure difficult reforms are less likely to be addressed effectively. Implementa-
tion of reforms will be heavily dependent on a civil service, which in the past has lacked efficiency and effectiveness.

guarantee social stability, and a continued and informed dialogue between stakeholders and society at large 
will facilitate the implementation of much needed—although at times unpopular—reforms.

Macro and fiscal Sustainability

While Tunisia has remained vulnerable to shocks, lower growth and greater external unbalances threaten 

macroeconomic and fiscal sustainability. For the three years since the revolution, Tunisia has been running 
down its policy buffers. The macroeconomic space for expansionary policies has now vanished. While public 
and external debt remained at an acceptable level compared to international standards, they are expected to 
reach unsustainable levels if reforms are not implemented.

fiscal sustainability

Expansionary fiscal policy since the revolution resulted in growing fiscal deficit and public debt. The 

fiscal deficit increased from 1 percent of GDP to 6.2 percent between 2010 and 2013 and the public debt 
from 40.7 percent of GDP to 44.8 percent during the same period. While this increase was an acceptable 
range, public debt is expected to reach 56 percent of GDP by 2017 before slowly declining over the medium 
term, according to the baseline scenario of the most recent debt sustainability analysis.25 This baseline scenario 
assumes the fiscal consolidation and growth pick up in 2015, however if fiscal consolidation reforms are not 
implemented, it would result in growing public debt that could reach around 62 percent of GDP by 2019, 
while a permanent negative growth shock would increase public debt to about 67 percent of GDP by 2019. 
Public debt dynamics are vulnerable to a slower adjustment path, lower growth, a marked depreciation of the 
exchange rates, or a shock on contingent liabilities.26

In addition, since the revolution, the budget has remained centered on the growing current spend-

ing rather than investment. Notably the wage bill and subsidies continued to increase until 2013, despite 
freezes for salaries and hiring of public servants, and a gradual increase of subsidized fuel prices. In 2013, 
the wage bill accounted for 12.5 percent of GDP (against 10.6 percent in 2010), and subsidies and transfers 
represented 7.8 percent of GDP (against 3.6 percent in 2010). Only in 2014, the was the expansionary 
policy put to a halt, leading the way to a medium-term fiscal consolidation, by slowing down the increase 
in current spending and progressively improving expenditure composition. In particular, spending on sub-
sidies should decrease by 0.6 percent of GDP in 2014, thanks to the initial phase-out of energy subsidies. 
Measures have also been taken on the revenue side, including streamlining exemptions and widening the 
tax base. Assuming the intensification of fiscal consolidation over the medium term, the deficit is expected 
to gradually decline from 6.5 percent of GDP in 2014 to 3.2 percent in 2019. The fiscal consolidation will 
require continued action on wage bill discipline in the public sector, further phase-out of subsidies, SOE 
restructuring, and reforming public sector pensions system. To mitigate the social costs of reforms, a better-
targeted social safety net system and a new strategy for the financing of social security should be quickly 
put in place.

25 IMF December 2014.
26 A key segment of possible fiscal sustainability is the municipalities, accounting for about 1.2 percent of GDP compared with 15 per-
cent in Morocco and 20 percent in Turkey. Growing this underexploited segment will be important in enhancing fiscal sustainability.

Macroeconomic sustainability

Tunisia’s external position has gradually eroded in the face of the expansionary policies favoring domes-
tic consumption, delays in structural reforms to support exports, political uncertainly, and exogenous 

factors. The trade balance deficit widened from 10.4 percent of GDP in 2010 to stand over 13 percent in 
2014. Tourism receipts have been very volatile since the revolution, as the price competitiveness of Tunisian 
destinations has not offset concerns over the security situation until recently. Remittances have, on the other 
hand, quite steadily sustained the current account by about US$2.2 billion a year, but the overall imbalance 
has increased from 4.8 percent of GDP in 2010 to over 8 percent by 2014. Foreign direct investment has 
been negatively impacted by political uncertainty and the delays in reforms. The Central Bank has used up 
significant reserves since 2011, dropping from about US$9.5 billion at the end of 2010 (or 4.4 months of 
GNFS imports) to approximately US$7.3 billion toward the end of 2014 (or 3.1 months of GNFS imports) 
to support the currency first, before limiting interventions to manage an orderly depreciation. While the 
exchange rate depreciation should sustain exports and the decline in international energy prices provides tem-
porary relief, external imbalances will remain a source of vulnerability over the medium-term that can only 
be addressed by reforms favoring an adequate supply side response when foreign markets recover, especially 
in Europe.

Environmental Sustainability

Sharing prosperity with future generations requires addressing the sustainability of Tunisia’s develop-

ment model. Tunisia’s ecosystems support its economic development and provide income and jobs to most 
vulnerable population. For example, the coastal zone is home to over 65 percent of Tunisia’s population and 
to its major industries; it also supports its tourism sector, which relies in its mass on mass beach activity, and 
which contributes 7 percent of GDP (2008) and provides employment opportunities for 380,000 (10 per-
cent of Tunisia’s active population). Tunisia’s water and soil ecosystems support its agricultural activity that 
contributes 8 percent of GDP and employs 16 percent of the national workforce. Tunisia’s development path 
is, however, depleting its natural resource stock. The adjusted net savings (ANS) measures the real difference 
between national income and consumption. It takes into consideration investment in human capital, depre-
ciation of fixed capital, depletion of natural resources, and damage caused by pollution. While Tunisia’s ANS 
rose from 2.6 percent of GDP in 1980 to 19 percent in 1999, it steadily declined over the next decade to 
reach –3.2 percent by 2012 due to energy depletion, local pollution damage, and mineral and forests deple-
tion (WDI 2014).

The unsustainable use of natural capital reduces the flow of economic and social benefits such that it 
is more difficult to achieve sustainable development, poverty reduction and other development goals. 

The linkages between these issues are stronger in Tunisia because an important proportion of the population 
is dependent on natural capital. It is therefore important to ensure an inclusive and participatory approach 
to: (i) consider natural resources as an integral part of a more comprehensive and sustainable socio-economic 
development paradigm, whereby these resources would be viewed as key support for improved livelihoods; 
(ii) consistently improve current practices characterized by slow, inefficient, and top-down decision-making 
processes; and (iii) significantly reconcile broad environmental protection concerns and local socio-econom-
ic priorities, as well as optimally balance potential gains in natural capital and productivity including at 
household level. Furthermore, the approach should be put on strengthening and enhancing sustainable and 
low-carbon local development practices (by reducing greenhouse gas emissions), improving the capacities of 

Tunisia: sysTemaTic counTry DiagnosTicExECuTivE SuMMAry

natural ecosystems to sequestrate carbon, maintaining and improving the value of goods and services of natu-
ral ecosystems, and reducing the pressures facing these ecosystems.

Conclusions

The next five years represent an unprecedented window of opportunity, as Tunisia stands at a crossroads 
to close its disparities and capitalize on its assets and potentials, by implementing sustained reforms. 

Now that the democratic transition is coming to an end and many path-breaking reforms have been initiated, 
Tunisia can now “shift gears” and proceed to implement the next generation of reforms, including deep and 
vital changes that will span from the economic structure to the overall governance dimension of the socio-
economic and political context. This new development model, underpinned by the renewed social contract 
enshrined in the Constitution and a dialogue promoting accountability and opening up of the policy space 
would unleash the potential to achieve higher growth and shared prosperity. The success of this large agenda 
of reforms will depend on the ability of the new and more complex political and social landscape of Tunisia 
to work efficiently, combining adequate consultation and participation with decisive implementation that 
minimizes the gap between the adoption of reforms and the results they deliver on the ground. This will 
further require institutional changes, notably in the public sector, to best serve the economic transformation 
and social inclusion agenda.

introduction 

A comprehensive diagnostic of Tunisia’s development model cannot be detached from an understanding 
of the country’s institutional, social, and political context. With the State playing an active—and at times 

dominant—role in economic development since independence in the late 1950s, Tunisia represents in a most 
emblematic manner the complex relation between economic policies, institutions, and political change. While 
economic policies over the two decades preceding the revolution delivered widely recognized achievements, 
such as growth rates above the regional average, impressive progress in human development indicators and a 
reduction in overall poverty incidence, they failed to address, and even exacerbated, the deep-rooted distortions 
in the economy that prevented operation of the channels for a more equal and inclusive society (productive 
employment and job creation above all). These distortions, grounded in a tightly controlled social and politi-
cal space that favored the elites, have limited citizens’ active political, social, and economic participation, and 
therefore hampered the long-term economic and social sustainability of the country’s development model.

The lack of adequate participation, transparency, and accountability in the management of public af-
fairs, which reached its peak during the decade preceding the revolution, undermined the economy’s 
ability to take off and bring prosperity and good jobs to all. Tunisia failed to create inclusive growth in 

its most comprehensive sense. Unequal opportunities stemming from favoritism and elite capture translated 
into wide disparities in terms of socio-economic achievements. The deep-rooted dichotomies of the Tunisian 
model expanded in several dimensions: in the economy (for instance with the duality between the more dy-
namic exporting offshore sector and the protected and stagnant onshore sector where vested interests shielded 
key sectors from competition); spatially between the thriving coastal regions and the impoverished interior 
areas; in the labor market, between the insiders that benefitted from secure jobs (mostly in the public sector) 
and the outsiders, increasingly young and educated Tunisians who experienced growing unemployment rates 
and jobs insecurity. Growing inequality and unequal access to opportunities and assets eventually fueled a 
rising resentment among the population, undermining the implicit social contract that was holding the de-
velopment model in place, which eventually imploded with the revolution of january 2011.

Significant steps toward a more open and transparent society, an accountable public sector, and a more 
inclusive economic system have been taken since the 2011 revolution. Boosting shared prosperity will 

require a concerted effort to strengthen the social contract,27 particularly in the area of promoting equality of 

27 The term “social contract” refers to some degree of societal consensus over the basic principles of the operation and role of the state 
vis-à-vis the private sector and citizens. In this usage, social contract refers to some aspects of a social equilibrium, including the 
beliefs and actions of citizens, key groups, and state actors.

opportunity. Growing evidence28 suggests that improving access for all and reducing inequality of opportuni-
ties are not only about “fairness” and building a “just society” but also about realizing a society’s aspirations of 
economic prosperity. In the case of Tunisia, this will mean first and foremost re-establishing trust in public in-
stitutions and ensuring active citizen participation in political and social affairs. Significant progress has been 
made by the transition governments to strengthen transparency and participation, particularly by enhancing 
civil and political rights as highlighted by the first free and fair elections29 in the country, increased freedom of 
press and association, easing restrictions on the operations of civil society organizations and other associations, 
and improving economic governance.30 

Substantial action is now required to pave the way for an economic transformation and the dismantling 
of undue economic rents and privileges in order to ensure sustained and inclusive growth. Deep struc-

tural reforms are now needed to enable a lasting economic recovery, following the path of other upper MICs 
that have performed much better than Tunisia over the past two decades. These reforms would need to tap 
into the country’s underlying capabilities and realign incentives to facilitate sustained and inclusive growth. 
The next few years represent an unprecedented window of opportunity, now that the democratic transition 
is coming to an end and many path-breaking reforms have been initiated. Tunisia needs now to “shift gears” 
and proceed to implement the next generation of reforms,31 deep and vital changes that will span from the 
economic structure to the overall governance dimension of the socio-economic and political context This new 
development model, underpinned by a renewed social contract and a dialogue promoting accountability and 
opening up of the policy space, would unleash the potential to achieve higher growth and shared prosperity. 
The success of this large agenda of reforms will depend on the ability of the new and more complex political 
and social landscape of Tunisia to work efficiently.32

In this context, the World Bank Group (WBG) has undertaken a Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD) 
to identify the main constraints to and opportunities for progress toward a more inclusive development 

model. The SCD is meant to support preparation of the upcoming Country Partnership Framework (CPF) 
2015–2020 for Tunisia. The diagnostic has been placed in the country’s historical socio-political and geo-
graphic context to better understand the political economy of past reforms and future opportunities. Given 
the importance of economic growth for sustaining any efforts in the area of poverty reduction and shared 
prosperity, this SCD is organized along opportunities for: (i) accelerating growth and private sector-led job 
creation (ii) improving equality of opportunities and increase resilience. 

28 See reference in Narayan et al (2013).
29 The first free elections were held for the Transitional Constituent Assembly held in 2011 and more recently in October 2014 for 
the parliamentary elections, to be followed by the presidential elections in November 2014.
30 Noteworthy also is the requirement for citizen participation at the local government level in municipal planning, which is a good 
indication of the nationwide implementation of the spirit of the new constitution. Moving forward, the key will be to strengthen 
the capacity of the central government and local governments to implement citizen and civil society engagement.
31 The reference is to the “second generation” of reforms that was invoked after the “first” waves of structural reforms during the 
1990s to gradually open the economy.
32 The recent progress in the democratic transition should not be seen as the end of the process but rather as its very beginning. For 
instance, even though laws are now in place to allow freedom of expression, in a few occasions representatives of the media and 
unions have been tried by military courts (which lack fair trial safeguards) for defaming and insulting the military, which could be 
seen as an attempt to stifle open criticism. Tunisia also adopted a comprehensive transitional justice framework aiming to address 
past human rights abuses and prevent future ones. On the latter, it aims to establish a framework for guiding transition from an 
authoritarian state to a democratic system that guarantees protection of citizens’ rights. However, the institutional arrangements 
and supporting regulations to implement this framework are not yet fully in place.

Context

The political economy of g rowth and inclusion in Tunisia

Tunisia is often seen as one of the leading performers in the MENA region in terms of economic and 

human development outcomes. Tunisia was one of the first countries in the region to embark on early 
structural reforms that contributed to the successful economic performance of the past decades and allowed 
substantial progress on human development indicators. As of today, it remains one of the most liberal coun-
tries in MENA in terms of women rights and female emancipation;33 it has a great wealth of human capital 
thanks to a comprehensive system of public education, and a universal healthcare system. It benefits from a 
generally adequate infrastructure and a long tradition of a strong administration. All these features are the 
legacy of decades of investment and focused policies since independence (for more details on the historical 
background please refer to Annex Iv).

Past policies, however, are also at the origin of the deep-rooted constraints we observe today in the 

country economic model. The concentration of state power dates from the early years of post-independence, 
while the link between government and business and the extraction of profits by privileged insiders became 
a pattern since the early process of liberalization of the economy, and in the 1970s, reaching a much larger 
scale under Ben Ali. Tunisia’s regulatory framework was conceived during the main era of privatization at the 
end of the 1980s and, although modified in 1996 and 2002, it is still plagued with the same major problems 
even three years after the revolution. It is also during this time that regional disparities increased, notably with 
the implementation of an arsenal of investment incentives under the investment code (many still in force 
today), which introduced a dichotomy between an open exporting sector (offshore) and the inward-oriented 
domestic sector. 

Economic progress was often seen as the main priority in the several development plans that followed 
since independence while socio-political stability was frequently obtained at the price of denied civ-

il liberties and political freedom. High economic growth and a generous and committed (especially in 

33 Tunisia has been at the forefront in the Arab World in terms of legal reforms relating to women’s equal status and protection under 
the law. In the 1990s, a series of legislative reforms accorded greater rights to women in personal status, civil status, employment 
opportunities and family law. Women have equal citizenship rights to men and have the right to vote and to be elected into of-
fice. They also have equal rights in marriage, divorce, custody, and ownership of property, including land, even though this right 
is rarely exercised in practice. Furthermore, the law protects women’s personal security: violence against women is a crime and 
punishable by law. Finally, a 2002 amendment to the nationality law gives women married to foreign citizens the right to pass on 
their nationality to their children.

straining circumstances) social policy (see box A4.1 in Annex Iv) were the foundations of the unwritten 
social contract between the state and its citizens, which promised to deliver socio-economic development and 
welfare. The gains in welfare would compensate for the lack of basic civil liberties and political freedom. The 
pre-revolution Tunisia was labeled “not free” by the international observers and think tanks: Freedom House 
reported the lack of guaranteed freedom of association and the fact that citizens’ participation in the elections 
was purely nominal; Global Integrity ratings indicate that Tunisia was one of the most repressive regimes in 
the world in terms of media freedom. 

However, even from a pure economic standpoint, these policies were not sustainable. The welfare gains 

in reality were not equally distributed; in addition, these policies led to macroeconomic imbalances that un-
dermined further economic progress and required reliance on foreign official assistance and critical structural 
reforms. For instance, the heavy social system created to include the population in the economic progress of 
the country created high fiscal deficits, while the reliance on foreign capital and remittances rendered Tunisia 
highly vulnerable to external shocks. 

A Closer look at Tunisia’s pre-revolutionary “economic Success Story”

The implementation of the structural adjustment program in late 1980s represents a turning point 
in economic policymaking in post-independence Tunisia and the beginning of the Tunisian economic 

success story as we know it. This program was aimed at: (i) preserving the stability of the macroeconomic 
framework and financial balances; (ii) integrating Tunisia into the world economy; (iii) redistributing income 
by reconciling social and economic policies; and (iv) reducing poverty and broadening the “middle class” 
group. The reforms were expected to boost economic growth that would trickle down to the population, in 
order to improve income levels and employment. While often disparaged today for the austerity measures in 
entailed, the program reached its macroeconomic objectives. 

Building on these reforms, Tunisia indeed experienced an average 4.5 percent growth rates between 
2000 and 2010, positioning itself among the leading performers of the region. Growth was mainly driven 

by large public investment and strong domestic demand, coupled with more dynamic exports and a sharp 
increase in FDI inflows. Tunisia also saw an improved macroeconomic management and a more stable mac-
roeconomic environment from the 1990s forward. Strengthened management of monetary and fiscal policies 
allowed inflation to be kept under control, thereby safeguarding most of the real purchasing power of the 
poor. The average inflation rate was close to five percent in the 1990s, declined subsequently to less than three 
percent in the period 2000–07 and was kept at bay even during the food and fuel price hike in 2008. The 
budget deficit as a share of GDP was also brought down from an annual average of almost five percent in the 
1980s—when social spending and generous increases in government salaries resulted in macroeconomic dis-
equilibria—to less than three percent, on average, in 2000–08. Employment growth accelerated,34 leading to 
a decrease in unemployment from almost 17 percent in 2000 to 13 percent in 2010,35 albeit remaining high, 
even in comparison to the regional average.

34 Employment creation was mostly concentrated in low value-added sectors. Construction, assembly manufacturing, and services 
such as tourism have been the main sectors for employment for low and semi-skilled workers, while public administration has been 
the main single source of jobs for skilled workers.
35 This decrease was particularly pronounced for unemployment among low-skilled individuals as the Tunisian economy created jobs 
for low-skilled individuals at faster rates than their entry to the labor force.

ty reduction. Macro indicators suggest that GDP 
growth has trickled down to households. According 
to national accounts, household final consumption 
growth closely followed that of GDP, averaging five 
percent during the decade. Poverty incidence de-
clined substantially: poverty rates in 2010 stood at 
15.5 percent, compared with 23.3 percent in 2005 
and 32.4 percent in 2000.36 The extreme poverty 
rate was estimated at 4.6 percent for 2010 com-
pared with 7.6 percent and 12.0 percent in 2005 
and 2000 respectively. An extensive system of sub-
sidies, transfers, and social protection contributed, 
despite great inefficiencies, to keep the cost of basic 
necessities affordable for the poor and protect them 
from shocks. Sustained investment in key infra-
structures contributed to open access to basic needs 
for the poor. Tunisia also performed well on most 
development indicators, improving along key non-
monetary indicators of deprivation over the decade. Economic growth and public investments in human 
development contributed to impressive improvements in school enrollment, infant and maternal mortality 
rates, and child malnutrition at the national level, while contributing to improved access to services such as 
water source and sanitation facilities (Table 1).

Tunisians, however, did not perceive themselves as benefitting from the country’s economic success. 

Fewer Tunisians were “thriving” in the past three years preceding the 2011 revolution, according to a 2011

such as starting their own entrepreneurial endeavors, when it came to unemployment challenges. Tunisians’

worsening perceptions and mounting frustration 
with such domestic challenges increased noticeably 
at the end of the decade. In particular, there was 
increased dissatisfaction with the provision of basic 
infrastructure, services, and worsening perceptions 
about whether the government would allow (small, 
independent) businesses to flourish.

Lack of transparency, social accountability, and 
citizen participation in government’s affairs con-
tributed to social and economic exclusion. Social

and economic exclusion goes beyond the narrower 
conception of material poverty, whether conceived 
in terms of income or the fulfillment of basic needs. 
It is first and foremost about exclusion from the po-
litical process. Despite a system of generous social 
policies established by the regime to compensate for 
the lack of civil and political liberties, economic, so-
cial and political exclusion exasperated all forms of 
inequality and unequal access to opportunity eventually gave rise to resentment among the population and 
broke the underlying social contract that was holding the development model in place leading to the well-
known Jasmine Revolution of january 2011.37

37 Ironically, Ben Ali’s promotion of the ICT sector for the development of the country (despite the imposed restrictions) was the 
accelerating power of his demise. Tunisian youth movements, through social media (Facebook) exposed the world to the discrep-
ancy in the views promoted by the regime and the country’s harsh reality. youth movements and civil society continue to play a 
significant watchdog role, although they still lack a presence within mainstream political institutions.

framing the issues

The Tunisian economy is increasingly affected by distortions and misallocation of resources. The 
structural weaknesses of the economic model are coupled with a volatile external environment. 

The global economic slowdown and the regional political instability create additional challenges to 
progress toward the twin goals of reduced extreme poverty and increased shared prosperity and threaten also 
the pace of much needed reforms. Below we present an overview of the main issues faced by the country as 
well as new challenges in the current context.

Economy Stuck in low Productivity Equilibrium – less Prosperity for All

Tunisia’s growth performance, although good compared to its regional peers, was substantially weaker 
than other upper middle-income countries, particularly from 2000 to 2010. Tunisia’s economy grew at 

about 3.4 percent per year in real per capita terms between 1990 and 2010 and was the second fastest growing 
country in the MENA region since 1990. Nevertheless, other upper middle-income countries (U-MICs) on 
average grew at 1.5 times that speed over the last decade. Well-performing U-MICs such as China enjoyed 
double-digit growth over the same period. Unlike many of its peers Tunisia did not experience an economic 
take off during the past two decades.

A slower pace of growth has important consequences on the ability to contain poverty and increase 

shared prosperity. Shared prosperity is strongly correlated with overall prosperity.38 This would mean that 
policies that are important to generate and sustain growth remain relevant and a necessary condition to 
achieve progress toward the twin goals.

gains in Terms of Poverty reduction remain f ragile and unevenly Distributed

Despite the overall reduction in poverty rates, the probability for many households to fall into poverty 
remains substantial. The bottom 40 percent has one chance in four of falling into poverty. The revised 

poverty estimates show that in 2010 almost two million people remained in impoverished conditions, half 
a million of which were below the extreme poverty line. Preliminary analysis of the poverty trends39 shows

also how the gains realized in the past decade remain fragile. For instance, many households’ consumption 
levels in 2010 remain just above the poverty threshold, making them very vulnerable to exogenous shocks, 
such as employment loss or hikes in the prices of essential goods. Wide regional disparities have persisted and 
even increased during the past decade. Though there is less inequality in consumption expenditures within 
regions, the gap between regions has widened. In 2010 poverty rates ranged from a low rate of 8–9 percent in 
the Center East region and Grand Tunis to a high of 26 and 32 percent in the North West and Center West 
regions respectively. Extreme poverty has become more concentrated than before: the poorest region of the 
country, namely the Center-West, was in 2010 home to more than 40 percent of the extreme poor living in 
the country. 

Employment does not appear to have played a significant part in poverty reduction. Better jobs should 
be central to poverty reduction and shared prosperity moving forward. quite remarkably, the reduction 

in poverty took place in Tunisia without large shifts either in employment dynamics or in the already existing 
gaps between poor and non-poor (or across different population groups defined by gender, skills or location). 
In fact, the share of unemployment increased between 2008 and 2012 among the most vulnerable popula-
tion groups but so it did for the least vulnerable. These findings lead to the suggestion that poverty reduction 
has been detached from the labor market and employment status. Factors that might have driven the poverty

wide regional Disparities in Access to and quality of basic infrastructure and Services

Spatial disparities in access to basic services and opportunities constrain growth and the achievement 

of the twin goals. Despite substantial progress in increasing access to basic services and infrastructure in 
Tunisia in the decade prior to the revolution, substantial disparities (across space and socio-economic and 
demographic characteristics) persist in access to, and quality of, basic infrastructure and services provided by 
local and central governments. Tunisia has one of the largest rural connectivity deficits in MENA: 39 percent 
rural access compared to a 58 percent average in MENA. Access to public transportation is much lower in 
the interior regions: 87 percent of households in urban Tunis live within a 15 minute walk to the nearest bus 
station and in the North-West and Mid-East, the proportion falls to 54 percent and 65 percent respectively. In 
rural areas, only 55 percent of the population has access to piped water and 52 percent to improved sanitation 
(compared to near universal access in urban areas) and only 55 percent of women have access to at least four 
prenatal visits compared to 75 percent in urban areas (MICS 2011–12). Access to education services is also 
widely unequal between (and within) regions: more than one fourth of students in the interior governorates 
of Sidi Bouzid, Kasserine, Kairouan, and Siliana are at more than three kilometers from the closest primary 
school, compared with a national average of 12 percent. Those four governorates have the worst access indica-
tors in almost all fronts including qualification of teachers, multi-grade classes and internet access.40

Differential access to opportunities translates into unequal human development and labor market out-

comes. While aggregate human development indicators improved, progress was limited in remote regions. 
In rural areas: (i) children are more than twice as likely to be stunted (10 percent in rural areas versus four 
percent urban); (ii) fewer women get prenatal services or treatment for high-risk pregnancies; (iii) maternal 
mortality rates are three times higher (70 versus 20 deaths per 100,000 live births); (iv) pupils face higher lev-
els of repetition and drop-outs (20.1 percent repetition and 12.7 percent drop-outs in Kasserine at the upper

secondary level); and (v) levels of unemployment ranged in 2013 from 20–22 percent in interior regions to 
around 7–11 percent in coastal areas).

Entrenched unemployment, Particularly for youth and women 

The number of jobs created in the past decade was not sufficient to absorb the increasing number of 

new entrants into the labor market. Despite a job creation rate of 2.5 percent per year—close to the growth 
rate of the labor force—the Tunisian economy has not been able to absorb new entrants to the labor market, 
particularly young educated workers. At the same time, the jobs that have been created are mainly in the 
informal and low productivity sectors, and employed low skilled workers offering low wages and no job secu-
rity. Indeed, entry rates for young/small firms that create formal sector jobs have been low, and among those 
created only a few have been able to survive and grow. As of today, slightly more than half of the working age 
population is out of the labor force, with the vast majority of this group being women. Among those who 
participate, 18 percent are unemployed and another 41 percent are in low quality jobs, either self-employed 
(including farmers and un-paid workers),41 or as wage employees in the informal sector, in jobs that are not 
covered by labor regulations and that do not provide access to social security. Most of those in informal un-
employment live in urban areas.42 The large majority—close to 90 percent—is represented by people under 
35 years old. Those with secondary education or less account for 70 percent.43

Women are a great part of the inactive population and, when in the labor force, face higher unemploy-

ment rates than men. In 2011, Tunisia was ranked on the lower end of the World Economic Forum’s index 
on gender parity in economic empowerment (126 out of 135 countries). The labor force participation of 
women in Tunisia is only 28 percent and compares to 74 percent for men (2010). The gender ratio of 0.37 
in economic activity is around half of the average ratio found in other U-MICs. This is a very wide gender 
gap particularly given Tunisia’s good performance on education and health indicators as well as the supportive 
legal framework. Moreover, women account for only 25 percent of waged nonagricultural employment. This 
is significantly lower than the 39 percent average for other U-MICs and the world average of 37 percent. 
When in the labor force, women face almost double unemployment rates than men (at 28 percent compared 
to 15 percent). Women represent an extremely valuable asset while at the same time remaining an untapped 
pool of resources—willing to work but unable to find suitable jobs. Finding a way to break the barriers to 
their active participation in the economy would free the country’s potential to accelerate growth and move 
up the income ladder

The tertiary education system is not equipping its graduates with the fundamental skills to perform well 
in labor markets while vocational training remains subpar and attracts too few students. Even though 

education achievements are improving markedly and there are growing cohorts with high school degree, the 

41 About 20 percent of Tunisia’s employment is in agriculture. Rural areas contain large pockets of underemployment, a key driver 
of poverty and vulnerability.
42 Migration between rural and urban areas where jobs are concentrated, is likely limited to key groups and sectors (an area that 
warrants additional analysis). Opportunities for international labor migration are currently not fully exploited, which needs to be 
assessed to determine the optimal strategy for domestic versus international employment.
43 Workers with higher education represent a higher share of the unemployed; the unemployment rate among workers with post-
secondary education was over 25 percent in 2012 and has been increasing over the past years. High jobless rates are coupled with 
widespread underemployment and inefficient school to work transitions.

lack of a highly qualified labor force is still considered one of the leading constraints to businesses. In addition 
to the quality of education, the skills and competencies acquired by graduates do not seem to be aligned with 
those in demand by the private sector. These mismatch results in increasingly high rates of unemployment 
among young and educated workers (which reached 53 percent in 2011).44

lack of Social Progress Due Mostly to lack of opportunities and Exclusion

Tunisia is lagging behind other peer countries45 in terms of inclusion and social progress. Social prog-

ress can be defined in several ways, to include different aspects of the institutional framework which allow 
human and social development. Only recently, however, it has been possible to “measure” social progress for 
most countries around the world. The recently established Social Progress Initiative (see Annex vI) defines 
(and measures) social progress as “the capacity of a society to meet the basic human needs of its citizens, 
establish the building blocks that allow citizens and communities to enhance and sustain the quality of their 
lives, and create the conditions for all individuals to reach their full potential.” Building on this definition, 
Tunisia’s performance, as measured in the country’s scorecard (Annex vI), shows how the sense of social and 
economic exclusion translates in lack of social progress overall. Progress in terms of social inclusion is defi-
nitely linked to but not perfectly correlated with advances in economic development (as measured by GDP 
per capita). Tunisia is an emblematic example of how economic progress can be detached from advances in 
social development.

Tunisia’s social progress has been hindered by exclusion of large segments of the population from eco-
nomic opportunities and active participation and engagement in the society. While active social and 

political participation is a key pillar of active citizenship, very few Tunisians engage in any form of political 
participation. This is particularly true for the youngest generation (under 30 years old), which also express 
disillusion on the role of the state and institutions and a very low level of trust and confidence in their 
ability to engage citizens. Tunisia scores particularly poorly in the dimension of the Social Progress index 
related to tolerance and inclusion (even after 2011, as the index refer to 2013 and 2014) and in proxies of 
agency such as progress to higher education, women’s average years in school, and tolerance for minorities/
religions. The exclusion of large segments of the population from active engagement in the society and in 
the economy had non-negligible economic consequences, placing the country on a low-growth equilibrium 
path (Figure 5).46

44 In fact, there is a surplus of skilled labor not rightly adapted to the needs of the labor market and a shortage of unskilled and semi-
skilled labor. Not only are there few jobs for the skilled workers, but also a severe discrepancy between the competencies required 
by the labor market and the fields students are studying in higher education. In fact, findings from the most recent Investment 
Climate Assessment reports that the level of workers’ skills and education are the second leading constraints perceived by employ-
ers; 39 percent of sampled firms perceive the available skills of the workforce as a weakness. The rates of underemployment and 
mismatch are exceptionally high among university graduates. They reach 30 percent for technicians and 36 percent for those with 
a bachelor’s degree in humanities. At the same time, the distribution of skills favors occupations that have less demand in the labor 
market, to the detriment of occupations such as machine operations, craftsmen, accountants, and salesmen.
45 Peer countries are defined as countries with comparable level of income and HD indicators.
46 A recent IMF paper (“Growth slowdowns and the Middle Income trap”) links growth slowdowns (the other side of the Middle 
income trap) to several components, one of which is “institutions” (measured, among other factors, by size of government, rule of 
law, regulations, etc). It shows how institutions are important in MICs to avoid the “trap.” Hence, the “social capital” of a nation, 
which includes well-established institutions that allow citizens participation and ensure protection of their rights, counts for its 
economic progress.

Manipulation of governance Systems Provided a Mechanism for Elite Capture 

The institutional system that allowed corruption in the form of elite capture, which in turn negatively 
impacted economic, social and political participation, has not been completely dismantled. Economic 

policies aimed at benefitting the elite were implemented through a web of regulatory favoritism that mini-
mized competition, while at the same time restrictions on social and political space stifled criticism and 
undermined accountability. Restrictions on political and economic participation also furthered social exclu-
sion. The governance system was molded around furthering elite capture while eliminating effective means to 
challenge official policies and government actions. Institutions needed to further these needs were themselves 
captured, while others were neglected in terms of building capacity resulting in weak delivery of services to 
the public. The question is to what extent the system that perpetuated elite capture, to the detriment of the 
public interest, has been dismantled. 

The Government of Tunisia has taken steps to improve the legislative framework covering issues of ac-
countability, transparency, and public participation, which if implemented could address elite capture 

and improve service delivery. The transition period should be used to correct governance gaps that allowed 
for elite capture and the resulting economic, political, and social exclusion. The GoT has taken steps to in-
crease transparency and accountability, which if implemented would increase citizen engagement. The new 
Constitution obligates the government to effectively manage public resources (Article 10), serve citizens and 
the public interest according to rules of transparency, integrity, effectiveness, and accountability (Article 15), 
and guarantee the right of citizens and civil society organizations to participate in public policy-making at the 
local level and in implementation of laws (Article 139). The Freedom of Association Law was passed in 2011, 
making it easier to establish civil society (and other types of ) organizations. The GoT also joined the Open 
Government Partnership, committing itself, at least in theory, to timely publishing of budget data, adoption 
of a freedom of information law, establishment of an income and asset disclosure regime covering elected 
and senior public officials, and openness to citizen engagement in policymaking and governance. The Law on 
Transitional Justice, adopted in December 2013, establishes a legal and institutional framework to address hu-
man rights abuses committed during the Ben Ali regime and providing reparations and restitution to victims

11

as a means toward national reconciliation. It also aims to prevent human rights abuses in the future and guide 
the transition from authoritarian state to a democratic system that protects citizens’ rights. 

Assessing implementation and impact of governance reforms is difficult to do at this early stage. With 

most of these laws and agreements meant to address governance gaps only recently put into place, supporting 
regulations and adequately resourced institutions are not yet fully in place to ensure efficient implementation. 
The GoT is in a difficult position given public expectations for quick reforms. In some cases patience is wear-
ing thin, with civil society organizations already questioning commitments to governance reforms.

emerging Challenges

Macroeconomic imbalances

Lower growth and greater external imbalances threaten macroeconomic and fiscal sustainability. For 

the past three years since the revolution, Tunisia has been running down its policy buffers, vanishing any 
macroeconomic space for expansionary policies that could support a relaunch of the economy. The fiscal 
deficit increased from one percent of GDP to 6.2 percent between 2010 and 2013 and the public debt from 
40.7 percent of GDP to 44.8 percent during the same period. Current account imbalances have risen since 
2011, as a widening trade deficit could not be offset by net service imports, notably tourism, due to the un-
certain political and security situation. A more flexible stance in the exchange rate policy, together with heavy 
reliance on external financing from IFIs, helped to preserve an acceptable the level of international reserves.47 
While public and external48 debt remained at an acceptable level compared to international standards, they 
are expected to reach unsustainable levels if reforms are not implemented. Recent debt sustainability analysis49 
shows that if fiscal consolidation reforms are not implemented, public debt could reach around 62 percent of 
GDP by 2019, while a permanent negative growth shock would increase public debt to about 67 percent of 
GDP by 2019. 

Since the revolution, the budget has been increasingly centered on the growing current spending 
rather than investment, undermining growth-enhancing projects. Although the fiscal deficit can still be 

considered acceptable,50 the composition of spending remains problematic, as the bulk of the adjustment 
was borne by lower capital spending combined with improved revenues. Notably the wage bill and subsidies 
continued to increase until 2013, despite freezes for salaries and hiring of public servants and gradual in-
crease of subsidized fuel prices. In 2013, the wage bill accounted for 12.5 percent of GDP (against 10.6 per-
cent in 2010), and subsidies and transfers represented 7.8 percent of GDP (against 3.6 percent in 2010). 
Only in 2014 was the expansionary policy has been put to a halt, leading the way to a medium-term fiscal 
consolidation by slowing down the increase in current spending and progressively improving expenditure 
composition.

47 Reserves stood at around three months of imports. On the positive side, in january 2015 Tunisia launched a US$1 billion sover-
eign bond without guarantees from international community, for the first time since the revolution. The ten year bond was issued 
with an interest rate of 5.75 percent, which is lower than that of Greece and Spain. It demonstrated strong international investor 
confidence in Tunisia and Tunisia’s return to the international capital market.
48 External debt has also increased since the revolution, reflecting the fiscal expansion and the widening of the current account deficit.

50 The estimated primary deficit—3.1 percent of GDP—would be well below the target of the IMF program (6.7 percent).

Considerable fiscal risks exist and need to be addressed. Subsidies have become a growing fiscal burden, 

reaching approximately 24 percent of total spending. Fuel subsidies reached two-thirds of total subsidies bud-
get in 2013, against less than a third in 2009, equivalent to almost 90 percent of the combined expenditures for 
health and basic education. Fiscal risks and contingent liabilities of SOEs are also increasing, as demonstrated 
by the rise of external debt from public enterprises guaranteed by the government to 34 percent of the total ex-
ternal government debt (10 percent of GDP) by end 2013, of which the electricity company STEG accounted 
for 40 percent. Against this backdrop, the government is initiating a more transparent fiscal risk management 
system through improved monitoring of cross-subsidies, audits, and consolidations of financial situations of 
the largest companies, and the governance framework of public enterprises. The necessary stabilization of the 
macro-fiscal situation will require continued action on civil service management and SOE restructuring

The emerging macroeconomic imbalances and challenges represent the major obstacle to accelerate 
growth and to put Tunisia on a sustainable economic development path. Fiscal consolidation and reforms 

to enhance productivity and competitiveness are needed to re-balance the macroeconomic imbalances which, 
although emerging more strongly in recent years, have been underming Tunisia’s growth since the last decade. 
The government’s choice in terms of the speed and depth of these interventions will have consequences on the 
future reduction of poverty and disparities.

regional Political instability and Economic volatility 

Social and economic challenges are emerging from the volatile regional context. The power struggle 

within Libya has brought hundreds of thousands of migrants to Tunisia. The expanded population has meant 
greater competition for housing and basic commodities such as food, fuel, and social services (health and 
more recently education). This has driven up prices for ordinary Tunisians, and the need to supply larger 
amounts of subsidized commodities has played added economic pressure on the government. Tunisia has also 
lost an important source of remittances as the thousands of Tunisians who relied on Libya for their income 
have had to return home to bleak economic prospects. Finally, the fear of instability spilling over to Tunisia 
may have been a deterrent to tourism and foreign investment.

The instability in Libya is putting economic pressure on Tunisia and exacerbating unemployment, par-
ticularly in the lagging regions, promoting informality and thereby creating yet another challenge for 

the government. The official Tunisian policy toward the Libyan power struggle is that of neutrality. That 
neutrality is strained however by the ongoing smuggling of weapons and fighters across its territory and an 
agreement with Algeria to combat terrorist threats. The tension is evident in sporadic violence on the borders 
with both Algeria and Libya. National security was a key issue during the recent elections campaign.

Informal trade has risen considerably between Tunisia and Libya (and also with Algeria), undermin-
ing government revenues, the development of formal businesses, and increasing cases of corruption. 

Although informal trade accounts for only a small proportion of Tunisia’s total trade (less than 10 percent of 
total imports), it plays a significant role in bilateral trade with Libya (where it accounts now for more than half 
of total trade) and Algeria, and in certain sectors.51 The main reasons behind this large-scale informal trade 
are differences in the levels of subsidies on either side of the border as well as the varying tax regimes. The 
collapse of security and controls following the political and social instability in both countries contributed to

the massive increase in the illicit activities across the borders. The growth in informal trade has a significant 
impact on several areas of the Tunisian economy. Fuel is cheaper, but government revenues are reduced, not 
only because goods are not subject to customs duties at the Tunisian border, but also because traders avoid 
paying value-added tax (vAT) provided they remain within the informal network. This loss of revenues can 
be significant. Moreover, this type of trade has an important economic and social impact in border regions. 
In many of these regions, informal trade is one of the most important economic activities—if not the most 
important—as is the case, for example, in Ben Gardane. Numerous individuals and organizations are involved 
in informal trade. While some are highly visible, such as transporters carrying the goods across the border, 
street vendors, and ad hoc traders (known informally as “ants”), others are less so, such as wholesalers, cur-
rency changers, and officials in the relevant administrations who are willing to turn a blind eye on the practice. 
This kind of trade also keeps many goods within budget for Tunisian consumers.

The ongoing exclusion of large segments of Tunisia’s youth population from the country’s social and 
economic mainstream has created a breeding ground for radical politics. The Tunisian Ministry of In-

terior estimates that over 3000 young men and women from Tunisia have traveled to Syria to join jihadist 
fighting groups. International observers see the failure to address the ongoing exclusion of youth from active 
participation in the economic and social life as a potential source of radicalization. Unemployment, although 
a crucial outcome of the youth exclusion, is in fact by no means the only factor contributing to it. young 
people appear52 to have low participation in decisions affecting their lives, limited engagement in associations 
or structures through which they could articulate their opinions, and a detached attitude toward politics. 
Absence of opportunities for voice regarding the direction of the country coupled with lack of accountability 
on the part of public authorities contribute to mounting frustration among this population, which (already a 
potential source of instability) could be further inflamed once former fighters begin returning home.

Conceptual framework

This diagnostic will start from the following thesis:
Tunisia’s economic performance has been increasingly hindered by economic policies and ad hoc 
implementation of regulations that served privileged groups and created multiple barriers to the 
operation of markets, lack of competition, and absence of a level playing field for broad based pri-
vate sector activity. This in turn has led to a distorted allocation of resources and incentives, insuf-
ficient job creation and quality, unequal access to opportunities,53 and ultimately social exclusion. 
The ongoing political transition, if successful, coupled with a fruitful collective social dialogue, is 
a crucial step toward unlocking the economic and institutional reforms necessary to place Tunisia 
on a faster development path.

The building blocks for the diagnostic will be based on the following objectives/pillar, gateways to a more 
inclusive society and more widely shared prosperity:

Strengthen Economic growth

Higher economic growth that translates into better jobs is a necessary condition to increase people’s 

prosperity. Tunisia’s growth has been hampered by multiple distortions, which created structural weaknesses 
to the economy. Such distortions are the result of the past political equilibrium and the direct consequence 
of capture from selected elite. Economic policies operated in a tightly controlled social and political space, 
in which public support for the ruling party was highly beneficial, if not an outright requirement for social 
inclusion, whether it be hiring into jobs in the public sector, access to finance, or engagement in social action, 
such as the limited space allowed for civil society. Similarly, the private sector has been unable to reach its 
full potential due to the distortions in the regulatory framework that provided privileged access to politically 
connected firms. Improved economic governance and transparency is therefore key for any economic reform 
aimed at accelerating growth and supporting broad based private sector development.

Higher growth requires a minimum level of political stability and security. Ensuring that the political, 

security and economic environment is stable and conducive to both public and private investment is an

agency.

essential precondition for fostering economic growth while reducing poverty and enhancing shared pros-
perity. In parallel, strengthening the social pact which weaves together all Tunisians, a primary challenge of 
the post-transition period, will include first and foremost rebuilding the broken trust between citizens and 
state institutions. Within this framework, it will be important to develop an inclusive economic model that 
strengthens efficiency and competition, along with appropriate social safety nets and mechanisms to create 
opportunities for the excluded groups and poor. Political and social stability are also essential to the sustain-
ability of any identified reform (section vII).

Promote inclusive g rowth and redistribution

Growth alone, however, is not sufficient to ensure that the generated prosperity is widely shared. Tuni-

sia failed to create inclusive growth in its most comprehensive sense. Structural weaknesses in the economic 
model and deep-rooted distortions have prevented the operation of some of the main channels for a more 
equal and inclusive society: employment, above all, hardly played any role in reducing poverty and increasing 
sharing prosperity. Unleashing the potential to generate better jobs for all is therefore a crucial step for inclu-
sion and shared prosperity.

Inequality of opportunities, and the exclusion (economic, political, and social) of many Tunisians along 
spatial, demographic, and income dimensions appears indeed to be one of the main constraints to 

achieving the twin goals. The extent to which progress toward the twin goals will happen depends on wheth-
er or not specific groups can participate in, and benefit from, economic growth. Achieving inclusion means 
enhancing ability, opportunity and dignity. The extent of real and perceived inclusion can have significant 
impacts on overall sustainability. Because of the lack of voice and participation, unequal opportunities con-
tinued to operate to create circles of exclusion for those who were born as outsiders to the established order.

The ongoing political transition, and its successful conclusion, could unlock the economic and institu-
tional reforms necessary to put Tunisia on a faster development path. The developments of early 2011 in 

Tunisia offered an opportunity to rebuild the relationship between state institutions and the citizens they are 
expected to serve. Tunisia sought this opportunity and, despite a prolonged period of political uncertainty and 
security incidents throughout 2013 and 2014, the country successfully completed the democratic transition 
process, thanks to the collaboration among all major political parties and key civil society institutions (see An-
nex vI). The next few years represent an unprecedented window of opportunity for Tunisia to engage in deep 
structural reforms, which would put the country on a faster development path.54 Social and political stability 
(as well as ensuring domestic security) are prerequisites for any reform to happen; and voice, transparency, and 
accountability in all economic and institutional spheres are preconditions for the sustainability of any reform.

54 Tunisia’s transition toward democracy represents a unique opportunity to tackle structural economic and social reforms. The “im-
plementation challenge” of such reform agenda remains, however, substantial. Tunisia has moved toward a more pluralist society 
and advanced in terms of institutional and social complexity. This progress is essential to move towards a sustainable reform path, 
but it also poses a number of organizational challenges that will need to be tackled efficiently and quickly. Key stakeholders will 
need to progressively adapt to their new functions and develop structured ways of interacting with other components of the society. 
For instance, the respective role and timing of interactions of the Parliament, Central Government, local governments, legislative 
authorities, civil society organizations, and private sector organizations will need to be structured and strengthened to facilitate the 
identification, preparation and strategic monitoring of key reforms ahead. Resolving this “implementing challenge” is a formidable 
challenge at a time when Tunisia’s political system is under pressure to deliver quickly needed social and economic reforms.

growth Development and Diagnostic

Despite relatively robust growth rates, 
Tunisia’s macroeconomic 
dynam-
ics during the past decade have been 
characterized by low productivity, insufficient 
investment, fading export performance, and 
insufficient employment generation. Underpin-

ning this subpar performance, Tunisia suffers from 
a structurally low investment, especially from the 
domestic private sector, while foreign direct in-
vestment (FDI) has been at times significant but 
poorly diversified. Although Tunisia has often been 
perceived as an open and well integrated economy, 
its export performance has been the second lowest 
in the region and has lagged far behind the most 
dynamic U-MICs.

Tunisia enjoyed a 4.4 percent average annual 
growth in GDP during 1980–2010, placing the 
country among the best performers in the MENA

region. However, the growth has been erratic, and the economy has remained vulnerable to exogenous shocks 
that altered high growth episodes. Despite reforms that helped to reduce the volatility of growth since the late 
1990s, the high growth episodes were short-lived. As a result, while Tunisia outperformed U-MICs average 
during 1980–2000, its growth performance was mitigated during the 2000s, with 4.5 percent average annual 
GDP growth, well below that of the U-MICs average (5.9 percent), and even slightly below that of MENA 
average (4.6 percent).

Tunisian economy has been unable to efficiently reallocate resources from low-return to high-return 
activities, and it has remained trapped into a low-productivity growth. Between 1990 and 2010, ac-

cumulation of capital and labor contributed on average 36 percent and 35 percent to growth, respectively 
(DPR, Chapter I). Only the remaining 28 percent of growth can be attributed on average to improvements 
in Total Factor Productivity (TFP). This corresponds to an average annual TFP growth rate of approximately 
1.3 percent, which, although comparing well with respect to its regional peers, is low when compared to fast 
growing countries. Further, controlling for human capital, the growth contribution of capital, labor, and 

19

Driver of growth

human capital becomes 36 percent, 35 percent and 
22 percent, respectively, such that contribution of 
TFP growth shrinks to an average five percent over 
the last two decades.

Low TFP growth suggests the existence of bar-
riers that prevent a reallocation of resources to-
ward more productive activities and hamper the 
economy’s capacity to generate wealth and jobs.

Moreover, in Tunisia the manufacturing sector has a 
very low productivity, only slightly higher than ag-
riculture, and in fact the textiles sector is even less 
productive than agriculture. This reflects the fact 
that most of the manufacturing in Tunisia focuses 
on simple assembly and other low value added activ-
ities, which also explains the low quality of jobs. La-
bor productivity mirrors this production structure: 
in 2005, labor productivity in manufacturing in Tu-
nisia was only 1.7 times higher than in agriculture; 
this is even lower than the 2.3 gap in Sub-Saharan 
Africa and much below the 2.8 in Latin America 
and 3.9 in Asia (McMillan and Rodrik 2011). The growth in output per worker (a proxy of labor productiv-
ity) was around 2.5 percent on average in Tunisia over the past decade, below most benchmark countries in 
MENA (such as jordan and Morocco) and fast growing countries in the EU and Asia.

Box 1: Comparative perspectives of Tunisia’s economic performance

Tunisia’s economic performance was benchmarked against a set of comparative countries (Chile, Malaysia, Mauritius, Mexico, Morocco, 
Turkey, Thailand, and Bulgaria) that have been chosen based on similar development experiences and challenges,, type of policies adopted, 
openness of the economy, and comparable level of development. 
While most macroeconomic indicators are in line with other middle-income countries, Tunisia stands out for the persistently high level of 
unemployment. Growth and investment were slightly above the average of the comparators, with lower inflation, as well as lower fiscal and 
current account deficit. However, Tunisia has the highest unemployment rate among this group with 13 percent in 2010, against an average 
of 7.7 percent for the comparison group (Figure 10).

Box 1: Comparative perspectives of Tunisia’s economic performance (continued)

Tunisia did not see a manufacturing export surge like many other countries. Its manufacturing value-added as a share of GDP stagnated 
after having reached 19 percent in the early 1990. Among the benchmarking countries, East Asian countries have the highest manufacturing 
share of GDP, with a peak of 31 percent and 36 percent respectively for Malaysia and Thailand during the 2000s, before decreasing to 
24 percent and 34 percent respectively in 2012. The share of Tunisia’s service sector in the GDP has continuously increased, from 47 percent 
in 1980 to 60 percent in 2010, which is comparable to Chile and Mexico, but lower than Bulgaria, Mauritius, and Turkey. Tunisia’s export 
performance was mitigated. Tunisian exports growth was positive but slower than in many of the benchmark countries, and its exports as a 
share of GDP declined from 38 percent to 35 percent over two last decades, with limited increase during the 1990s and a drop over the past 
decade. There was no strong surge like that of East Asian countries, Bulgaria or Mauritius during the 1990s. Moreover, Tunisia has continued 
to import more than export reflecting a structural gap in its trade pattern. Further, Tunisia’s share of goods exports in world trade fell slightly 
between 2002 and 2010 while most benchmark countries increased their export share in the world. 
After the structural adjustment period, the privatization process slowed down leaving intact a large public sector in the economy, which 
increasingly translated in inefficiency, often masked by monopoly-rents, and contributed to weak overall economic performance. SOEs still 
play a dominant role in key sectors, such as in mining and energy, finance, banking and insurance, transport, and communications. As a result, 
among this group of benchmark countries, Tunisia has the highest weight of the public sector in the economy. Measured by public and publicly 
guaranteed debt service as share of GNI, all benchmark countries including Tunisia have continued to reduce the weight of the public sector, 
but the pace was much slower in Tunisia. Tunisia has the highest share among this group with 4.6 percent in 2010, against an average of two 
percent in MENA region, 0.8 percent in upper MICs and 0.5 percent in East Asian region (Figure 12).

Consumption has been the main driver of growth, with private consumption accounting for 66 percent 

of growth during the 2000s. Investment has remained sluggish and volatile, accounting only for 24 percent 
of GDP during the same period, which is low compared to other U-MICs. The level of private domestic 
investment is especially low, at around 15 percent in Tunisia over the period. Further, most of the domestic 
private investment (54 percent) is concentrated in the services sector, which is highly protected from interna-
tional competition. 

Meanwhile domestic private investment has been constrained by prerevolutionary predatory practices 

and an underperforming banking sector. Investment hovered around 24 percent since 2000, which is low

The level of private domestic investment is especially 
low, at around 15 percent in Tunisia over the period. 
Further, domestic private investment remained fo-
cused on real estate (considered safer from predation 
by the Ben Ali regime). Much of the legislative and 
administrative framework that allowed for preda-
tion, crony capitalism, and elite capture remains in 
effect,55 with potential for manipulation by current 
and future regimes. In terms of sectors, most of the 
domestic private investment (54 percent) is concen-
trated in the services sector, which is highly shielded 
from international competition. Meanwhile, the 
domestic banking sector has been unable to chan-
nel credit to the most productive economic activities 
and projects.

Tunisia appeared to have attracted relatively more 
FDI56 than most of the MENA countries (2.3 per-
cent), but its FDI has remained modest com-

pared to other U-MICs that attracted an averaged 
3.4 percent of FDI during the 2000s. Moreover, de-
spite government efforts to promote manufacturing 
exports, FDI in Tunisia has remained concentrated 
on the energy sector, which absorbed 60 percent of 
total FDI during 2007–2010, against 24 percent in 
manufacturing and 15 percent in services (against 
Morocco, for instance, where 88 percent of FDI 
was directed into services sectors).57 In fact, FDI in 
manufacturing dropped by half between 2000 and 
2006, and has remained focused on low value added 
industries.

56 FDI has increased from an average of 2 percent of GDP during the 1990s to 3.1 percent during the 2000s.
57 The telecommunications sector has become one of the region’s main sources of foreign direct investment (United Nations 2008). 
Between 2000 and 2009, the sector attracted almost 70 percent of regional investment (around US$42 billion). The prominent 
trigger of this interregional flow of capital has been the introduction of competition in mobile telecommunications markets since 
the end of the 1990s, with most cross-regional investment focused on mobile operators. Countries that liberalized first or more 
aggressively—such as Morocco, Egypt, jordan, Saudi Arabia, and Iraq—have received the largest FDI inflows from within and 
outside the region (primarily from Europe and South Africa). By contrast, in countries where there has been no or only timid 
liberalization—including Lebanon, Syria, and Libya—capital inflows have been limited. However, even in difficult environments 
where investment carries political risks, such as Iraq, announcements of additional licenses have attracted interest from multiple 
potential bidders. The opening of mobile markets has attracted intraregional and external flows through greenfield investments in 
new licenses and cross-border mergers and acquisitions of national operators and regional groups.

Tunisia’s export performance has remained modest overall, despite an apparently favorable incentives 

regime. While Tunisia traditionally suffered from structural trade deficit due to its assembly type of exports 
(which tend to import more than export), and an under-exploitation of its export potential (for instance, 
food exports, largely geared toward the European market, are merely about 10 percent of total merchandise 
exports.) In many cases Tunisia is not using its full EU quota.58 Recent growth in the deficit reflects an in-
creasing share of energy, accounting now for more than a third of the trade deficit. This is exacerbated by a 
slowdown in export growth,59 lower tourism receipts, and negative supply shocks in the major productions 
(such as phosphate and agriculture sectors). 

In addition, Tunisia has seen a widening energy trade deficit in the recent years, the result of higher energy 
bill, lower oil and gas production (which decreases exports and raises imports), and lower gas transiting from 

58 Tunisia’s agricultural policy objectives aim to achieve food security for a rather narrow set of commodities such as cereals and live-
stock production. Overall incentives are geared towards the production of non-competitive commodities in large-scale farms, often 
located in the coastal areas. Thus, while well intended, the current agricultural policy setting did not manage to support and cre-
ate job-intensive growth as agriculture is dominated by small and medium-sized family farms. Agricultural policy fundamentally 
reduces incentives to labor-intensive crop and livestock production.
59 It is often argued that if Tunisia were to shift production towards several Mediterranean products (arboriculture and horticulture) 
in which it enjoys a comparative advantage, it could boost the export of labor-intensive agricultural products to the EU market. 
Such a shift needs to be implemented gradually to ensure that it does not distort national food security objectives. It would require 
highly sensitive policy prioritization in the area of price support, input subsidies, and the marketing of agricultural products. 
Importantly, it would need significant hard and soft infrastructure investments in several areas, including irrigation, research and 
extension, land registry, and agricultural financing. A system of income transfer to mitigate impacts on existing beneficiaries would 
likely be required.

the Algeria-Italy pipeline (from which Tunisia is 
paid in gas supplies).60 The structural trend of grow-
ing oil and gas consumption against lower produc-
tion due to waning domestic resources is reflected 
in Tunisia’s energy import balance, which up until 
2000 was positive, and since then turned negative. 
At the same time investments in the energy sector 
have been lagging, which could make the system in-
creasingly susceptible to power outages that in turn 
could also negatively affect Tunisia’s export perfor-
mance. In 2013 the Government began a review 
process with the aim of addressing these challenges. 
In 2014 it endorsed a dedicated energy road map 
and priority measures that focuses on (i) reviewing 
existing gas resources and consumption patterns; 
and (ii) diversifying electricity supply away from gas 
thus strengthening energy security. The implemen-
tation of this road map will require making available 
significant levels of financing to ensure necessary in-
vestments can be made to meet electricity demand.

60 Lower levels of transiting gas is a direct result of the unfavorable economics combined with a sharp increase in renewable electricity 
generation in Italy, which has led to a decline of gas demand from Algeria. Given the importance of gas supplies in the electricity 
mix in Tunisia (about 95 percent), the decline in gas supplied in kind through the Algeria–Tunisia–Italy pipeline weighs heavily 
on the overall Government budget.

Poverty incidence in Tunisia halved be-
tween 2000 and 2010, from over 32 per-

cent to 15.5. In the past decade Tunisia saw 
its poverty incidence, officially measured in terms of 
household per capita consumption, substantially de-
cline. This is true across several dimensions: for ab-
solute and extreme poverty lines, across regions and 
by strata (Table 3). Furthermore, estimates from 
the Institute of National Statistics (INS, AfDB, and 
World Bank 2012) confirm that the depth and se-
verity of consumption-based poverty also improved 
consistently in the past decade (Figure 20). 

Tunisia’s poverty reduction process has mostly 
been linked to its economic growth. About 80 per-

cent of the poverty reduction between 2005 and 
2010 has been attributed to growth, and much less, 
about 18 percent, to redistribution.61 These findings 
confirm previous results on the importance of growth 
compared to redistribution from 1980–2000 (Ayardi 
et al. 2005). In other words, it is the increase for all, and not the reduction in disparities, that explains the lion’s 
share of overall poverty reduction experienced in Tunisia. Consistently, the evolution of poverty appears to be 
linked to growth performance. Estimates for post-revolution poverty incidence62 suggest that poverty increased 
immediately after the revolution (where growth reached a record –1.9 percent) and then fell again in 2012 to 
pre-revolution levels (thanks to growth rebound thanks to increased consumption fueled by large public expen-
ditures on wages and social programs). Simulations of the effects of sector-specific changes in growth, prices and 
employment63 observed in 2011 and 2012 had on households’ consumption64 show an increase in poverty to

17.7 percent in 2011 followed by a reduction to 15.4 
percent in 2012. In the case of extreme poverty, inci-
dence increased to 7.4 percent in 2011 and declined 
to 6.7 percent in 2012, still above the pre-revolution 
rate of 4.6 percent in 2010 (Figure 19).65

Despite a remarkable reduction in poverty inci-
dence, regional disparities persisted and even in-
creased in the past decade. Overall consumption 

inequality between 2000 and 2010 decreased only 
slightly: the Gini index went from 0.375 to 0.358. 
However, inter-regional inequality substantively in-
creased with respect to intra-regional inequality. In-
equality between regions explained about 62 percent 
of total inequality in 2010 compared to 50 percent 
in 2000. Regional disparities in poverty headcount 
rates are accompanied by significant regional differ-
ences in the concentration of the poor population, 
which is over-represented in the western regions of 
the country. In 2010 poverty rates ranged from a low 
rate of 8–9 percent in the Center East region and 
Grand Tunis to a high of 26 and 32 percent in the 
North West and Center West regions respectively. 
Extreme poverty has become more concentrated than 
before: the poorest regions of the country, namely 
the (North, Center, and South) West, were in 2010 
home to more than 70 percent of the extreme poor 
living in the country (and 55 percent of all poor). 

Furthermore, poverty incidence in rural areas 
continued to be nearly twice as high as in urban

areas in 2010. It is likely that this pattern has con-
tinued without major changes in the post revolution 
period (at least through 2012). Poverty incidence in 
cities declined from 21.5 to 9.0 percent, while in 
non-communal areas, it fell from 40.4 to 22.6 percent (Table 3). Results from survey-to-survey imputation 
methods suggest that much of the estimated change in poverty between 2010 and 2012 came from reductions 
in urban poverty rather than reductions in rural households’ poverty.66

In addition to the modest decline in overall inequality, vulnerability to falling into and/or remaining 

in poverty modestly improved. However, the probability of falling into poverty for any household in 2010 

65 More sophisticated survey-to-survey imputation methods confirm projected post-revolution poverty trends. Poverty is estimated 
after imputing consumption into the 2012 Labor Force Survey (LFS) using what is known about the key determinants of observed 
consumption reported in the latest available 2010 HBCS survey. Results show that, depending on the assumptions of the imputa-
tion method, poverty would have declined between 2.1 and 2.8 percentage points in 2012.
66 Urban households account for between 65 and 90 percent of the imputed change in total poverty between 2010 and 2012.

tom 40 percent of the population, which had a one 
in four chance of falling into poverty, based on the 
their circumstances, asset ownership, and access to 
basic services. In 2000, the probability of a house-
hold from the bottom 40 percent of falling into pov-
erty was 34 percent.

ceed in reducing disparities. The increase in con-

sumption between 2005 and 2010 was uniform 
among most of the households groups, in spite of 
growth being lower for the richer population. This 
difference led to a pro-poor growth during the pe-
riod that paradoxically did not come from dispro-
portionate gains of the poor, the bottom 40 percent 
or the middle class, but from the reduced growth of 
the rich. After adjusting for inflation between years 
and for spatial price differences, annual growth rates 
between 2005 and 2010 were mostly uniform at 
around three percent for the majority of the distri-
bution (Figure 20). It was only for—roughly—the 
top 20 percent of the distribution that consumption 
growth rates were below average (and only the rich-
est top 2–3 percent had an actual negative growth 
between the two years). In other words, the sus-
tained annual growth rates of consumption are consistent with substantive poverty reduction, but their most-
ly uniform distribution across many Tunisians explains why monetary inequality improved only modestly.

profile of the poor and the bottom 40 percent

Poverty status in Tunisia is positively correlated with household size, location, and level of educational 

attainment of the household head. The poor live in more crowded households, are more likely to reside in 
western regions, and have less-educated members in their households than the non-poor. Education seems to 
be a strong correlate of poverty: in 2010, there was a considerable gap in poverty rates between households 
whose head had less than primary education and others. Specifically, households with uneducated (or less-
educated) heads show a poverty rate of around 23 (30) percent, whereas the rate for households whose heads 
have more than secondary education is just less than 1 (2) percent (Figure 22). The vast majority (around 80 
percent) of the poor population live in a household whose head completed only primary or less education 
(Figure 23). Poor individuals are more likely than non-poor individuals to be unemployed (Figure 24) or work 
in the agriculture sector (Figure 25). Workers in the public sector are also less likely to be poor compared to 
the self-employed and those working in the private sector. 

The poor have typically had substantively low access to basic services, notably water and sanitation, and 
the gaps with respect to the non-poor seem to be an enduring feature. Differences in having a flush toilet 

or being connected to the sewage network were significant in 2005 and 2010. Moreover, coverage among the

non-poor increased while that of the poor remained stagnant in more recent years (Figure 26). The poor also 
have fewer assets than the non-poor, with marked differences in ownership of cars and motorcycles, telephones 
and cell phones, and computers. In terms of consumption patterns, the poor spend relatively more of their lower 
consumption expenses on food than the nonpoor. On the positive side, coverage gaps between the poor and the 
non-poor have narrowed for education services and remain very small for (almost universal) access to electricity. 

For virtually all features considered, the profile of the bottom 40 percent falls between that of the poor 
and the non-poor. Interestingly, for access to services and asset ownership, the profile of the bottom 
40 percent aligns closer to the poor than the non-poor. Households in the bottom 40 percent are larger,

Non poor

have more dependents, and are headed by individuals with lower educational attainment than households in 
the top 60 percent of the distribution. They are also less likely to work in the public sector. Households in 
the bottom two fifths of the distribution had on average six members—one less than households in the top 
60 percent. Dependency rates among households in the bottom 40 percent are higher than those in the top 
60 percent, suggesting they face more stringent economic situations to cover their basic needs. The education 
and economic characteristics of household heads in the bottom 40 percent are similar to the characteristics of 
heads in poor households and typically worse than those of heads in the non-poor household. For instance, 
in 2010 over 75 of the households in the bottom 40 percent were headed by an illiterate individual (over 
80 percent for the poor), whereas half of household heads among the non-poor were. In addition, almost 37 
of household heads in the bottom 40 percent had a household head working in a salaried private job while 
only about 27 percent of the head of non-poor households did.

Individuals and households in the bottom 40 percent are spatially concentrated in the Center West and 

North West regions of Tunisia. In 2010, over 55 percent of households, who belong to the bottom 40 percent 
of the consumption distribution, were located in rural areas of Tunisia. The regions with the largest concentration 
were the Center West and North West regions hosting over 40 percent of the population belonging to the bottom 
two fifths of the distribution (Figure 27). The same regions are home to almost 48 percent of the poor (Figure 28).

The similarity in demographic, economic characteristics and spatial distribution of the poor and the bot-
tom 40 percent population reassures that the poverty reduction and share prosperity boosting targets are 

totally coherent. As shown, poverty status of a household seems to have been related, both in 2005 and 2010, 
to a similar set of characteristics as those from households in the bottom 40 percent.67 These results may hint 
that shifting policies benefitting the entire populations for others that more specifically focus on the bottom 40 
percent would have substantive benefits for the poor as well. 

67 For instance, poor households—as well as households in the bottom 40—percent tend to be larger and concentrated in the western 
and rural regions of the country. Also, non-poor households tend to have heads who have higher education levels or who are more 
likely to be employed in the public sector, as well as much better access to services, particularly water and sanitation.

employment and the poor

In Tunisia, employment rates among the bottom 40 percent of the population are lower than in other 

Middle Income Countries.68 Participation rates are comparable across consumption deciles (see Figure 31). 
There are, however, marked differences in the unemployment rate. Among workers living in households 

Tunisia: sysTemaTic counTry DiagnosTicin the poorest decile, for instance, the average un-
employment rate is more than 30 percent, more 
than double the rate for workers living in the richest 
households (which is below 15 percent). An impor-
tant implication is that, contrary to other countries 
where most of the poor work—albeit in low quality 
jobs—in Tunisia standards of living can still be im-
proved by connecting the poor to jobs.

Workers living in poor households are often 
employed in low quality jobs. In the poorest 

households, less than 20 percent of workers are in 
formal wage employment in the private or public 
sectors. The majority are in irregular wage employ-
ment (40 percent), or self-employed in agricultural 
or non-agricultural activities. In the richest house-
holds, close to 75 percent of workers are in formal 
wage employment. The share of those who are self-
employed in agriculture or in irregular wage em-
ployment is negligible (see Figure 32). 

Workers in the bottom 40 percent are often in 

lagging regions, especially in the North-West, 
Center-West, and South-West. Individuals living in 
these regions are also more likely to be inactive or 
unemployed (see Figure 33 to Figure 36). Improv-
ing labor market opportunities for them might re-
quire targeted multi-sector policies that go beyond 
reforms at the macro level and the overall business 
environment, and focus on the regions where they 
live and sub-sectors linked to the economic activities 
they engage in.

68 At the individual level, youth, women and workers living among the bottom 40 percent of the population have much worse labor 
market outcomes. Among youth in the bottom decile, for instance, only less than 20 percent are employed, 40 percent do not 
participate in the labor market, and over 20 percent are unemployed. The share of inactivity increases across deciles and reaches 80 
percent amongst the richest. Inactivity and unemployment among youth are worse than among the overall working age popula-
tion, across all deciles. In fact, youth are 2.5–3 times more likely than adults to be unemployed; this rate is higher among men 
than women. At the regional level youth are 2–5 times more likely than adults to be unemployed. In addition, 2 out of 3 youth 
with tertiary education are unemployed. In terms of the type of job held, youth and workers in the bottom deciles are more likely 
to be irregular wage employees or unpaid workers and are less likely to be employed in the public sector relative to all workers.

“opportunities.”69 In Tunisia, uneven access to basic services is preventing progress to achieve shared 

prosperity. Equal opportunities occur when access to basic services, employment and, ultimately, welfare 
does not depend on factors for which an individual bears no responsibility, such as the gender, location, 
or the family’s socioeconomic background he or she is born into. To the extent to which those factors play 
an increasing role in such dimensions, a society is said to have unequal opportunities. In Tunisia, unequal 
opportunities determine, in addition to the poverty status, the extent of the disparities in access to services 
among Tunisians.

In Tunisia, access to basic services, with the exception of some educational opportunities, remains low and 

unevenly distributed. In effect, only some educational opportunities, such as attending school and starting 
school on time, are almost universal in Tunisia. In contrast, the likelihood of finishing basic primary education 

69 Opportunities are often used in this diagnostic in a wider sense than what is reported here. In this specific case, we refer to quality 
access to basic services.

on time or having access to other basic services, such as tap water or sanitation, are both low and systematically 
leave out certain groups of the population. Figure 37 presents the coverage rate and HOI70 for education-, water-, 
and sanitation-related opportunities for children in Tunisia.71 Completing six years of education (basic primary 
education) on time and having access to tap water have coverage rates between 75 and 80 percent. But the access 
to these opportunities is not uniformly distributed across different population groups. Their HOI is about five to 
ten percentage points below their respective coverage rates. Access to sanitation and presence of a flushing toilet 
in the dwelling yield the lowest coverage and the largest inequality of access across population groups, with gaps 
between coverage and HOI well exceeding 10 percent points. In other words, not only do fewer Tunisian children 
have access to such services, but there are large inequalities in coverage across different population groups. The 
type of households a Tunisian child is born into still bears a lot of weight in the basic services he and she will 
enjoy early in life. Education of the household head, urban/rural location and regional residence, and wealth are 
systematically the most relevant circumstances to explain unequal opportunities in Tunisia. Combined, they ac-
count for between 75 and 90 percent of the observed inequality among those with access.

70 The Human Opportunity Index (HOI; Paes de Barros et al. 2008) is one of the analytical tools that have been developed to mea-
sure equality of opportunities. The HOI synthesizes in a single indicator how close a society is to universal coverage of a given 
opportunity and how equitably coverage of that opportunity is distributed. The HOI “penalizes” the extent to which different cir-
cumstance groups—that is, population groups defined by certain circumstances, or attributes of an individual environment—have 
different coverage rates. When coverage rates among multiple circumstance groups are equal, the penalty is zero and the HOI is 
equal to the opportunity’s overall coverage rate. As coverage rates differ among circumstance groups, the penalty increases and the 
HOI decreases. Higher inequality in coverage rates leads to lower HOI.
71 The HOI index “corrects” the observed coverage rate of a given service by “penalizing” the extent that coverage varies across differ-
ent population groups. The lower the HOI, the higher the differences in coverage of that given service across different population 
groups (based on their circumstances).

Box 2: Unequal access to (and quality of) water and sanitation

Despite large coverage in water supply,a great disparities persist in Tunisia in access to water between poor and non-poor households, with 
only 73.3 percent of the poor having access (in 2005) to an improved water source, while the nonpoor had 88.3 percent access rate. In 2010, the 
gap between poor and nonpoor had increased, with only 68 percent of the poor having improved access, while the nonpoor had an access rate 
20 percentage points higher (88.3 percent). Households in the first quintile of the consumption distribution showed access rates of 63.5 percent 
in 2005 and 61.7 percent in 2010. In contrast, households in the richest quintile had almost universal access, in both 2005 (97.2 percent) and 
in 2010 (98.1 percent).b For sanitation, while there was significant increase in access to a flush toilet connected to the sewer system between 
2005 and 2010 (35.4 percent in 2005 to 43.8 percent in 2010), the largest expansions occurred among the privileged segment of the population. 
Nonpoor access rates reached 49.3 percent in 2010 (from 41.9 percent in 2005), whereas among the poor, access hovered around 14 percent. 
Important geographic disparities exist in access to water sources and sanitation services While urban households have close to universal 
access to an improved water source, only 6 of every 10 rural households had an improved source in both 2005 and 2010. Similarly, Grand 
Tunis had access rates above 97 percent in 2005 and close to universal coverage in 2010, whereas the western regions (central and north) 
had coverage rates below 70 percent in both years. Geographical disparities for sanitation access seem to have been exacerbated between 
2005 and 2010. Urban households’ sanitation coverage at the highest level reached 64.2 percent—an increase of over 11 percentage points. 
In contrast, rural households’ coverage at the highest level barely budged, increasing just 2.4 percentage points in the five-year period. Also, 
while access rates increased across all regions in Tunisia, eastern regions experienced the largest increases. The Center-West access rate 
improved by 3.1 percentage points, but was the lowest of all regions in 2010 at 15.5 percent. 
The quality of services is also far from ideal, as also reflected in citizens’ perception. When using the definition of adequate access to water 
and sanitation, following the United Nations Children’s Fund’s (UNICEF) conceptual framework, the results show a different water, sanitation 
profile on access of water and sanitation services: less than two percent of Tunisian households in 2012 had access to adequate improved 
water and sanitation; did not share toilets with other households; and safely disposed of child feces. When combining several criteria defining 
adequate water and sanitation services, only 76.5 percent of Tunisian households are considered to have adequate services and most of the 
households with inadequate services are poor (46.5 percent adequacy) or rural (54.5 percent adequacy). Further evidence exists of in relation 
to the quality of services received by citizens. A survey of beneficiaries of 80 rural water supply systemsc shows that a majority of beneficiaries 
complain about the frequency and length of water supply interruptions. In a previous WHO-supported survey covering 1,468 households 
(2004), the quality of potable water was perceived as bad by 12 percent of households (9.8 percent in urban areas, and 15.1 in rural areas).

b In terms of socioeconomic and labor characteristics, a typical pattern emerges: characteristics associated with higher socioeconomic status (e.g. higher 
numbers of rooms per capita, household head working in the public/services sector, heads or other members having higher levels of educational attainment, 
ownership of certain assets such as air conditioner unit or a car) are correlated with higher rates of access to an improved water source and lower rates of 
access to an unimproved source.

Addressing unequal opportunities is a key component for poverty reduction and to increase shared pros-

perity. Circumstances do also affect the vulnerability of Tunisians to fall into poverty, not only access to services. 
This is important because today in Tunisia, factors other than talent and effort determine to a large extent the 
chances of Tunisians to become and remain poor. If we define the top 10 most (least) vulnerable groups as those 
for which poverty incidence in 2005 was highest (lowest) among a series of demographic characteristics, we ob-
serve marked and persistent differentials in terms of poverty incidence. The 10 least vulnerable groups do not ex-
ceed an 11 percent incidence of poverty. In contrast, the incidence of poverty among the top 10 most vulnerable 
groups ranges between 35 and 60 percent. The most vulnerable group in 2005 is composed of female individuals, 
younger than 18 years of age, who belong to households in peri-urban areas located in West regions and where no 
member of her household has at least primary education (see table in Annex Iv). Individuals in this group had 
in 2005 an average poverty incidence of 57 percent. The least vulnerable group, in contrast, refers to males over 
60 years of age, with primary education residing in Grand Tunis. Their observed poverty incidence was just above 
three percent. A cursory assessment indicates that most vulnerable groups are found among young individuals 
residing in Western regions. Moreover, while the most vulnerable groups have typically reduced their poverty 
incidence between 2005 and 2010, their incidence still remains substantially apart from the least vulnerable.

key Constraints to growth and 
inclusion

The most recent analysis on constraints to inclusive growth in Tunisia highlights how policies designed 
in the absence of effective institutions to ensure public sector accountability have acted as binding 

constraints to growth. The 2014 World Bank Development Policy Review (DPR)72—whose conceptual 
framework informs this diagnostic—argues that Tunisian prosperity has been held back by policies that have 
reduced the country’s overall economic performance. These policies created multiple barriers and deep distor-
tions to the operation of markets that are behind the poor growth performance vis-à-vis comparator countries. 
Specifically, the DPR argues that a protected regulatory environment resulting in lack of competition and 
large bureaucratic burden, a financial sector hampered by governance failures, labor rules that paradoxically 
promote job insecurity, and industrial, agricultural, and natural resources management policies that introduce 
distortions and deepen regional disparities are at the core of Tunisia’s economic and social impasse fueling dis-
content that led to the revolution. Similarly, two recent studies73 identified strong state regulations that create 
an environment of low appropriability on returns and low social returns as a binding constraint to growth and 
inclusion. Below, we present the channels through which we believe the institutional and economic set-up is 
preventing higher growth and wider inclusion.

weak Contestability and Competition

Government regulations and actions in Tunisia are distortive of market development and generate un-

intended barriers to competition. Contestability of markets is weak given significant barriers to entry (es-
pecially legal and administrative measures), widespread pricing policies and restrictive practices. Pervasive 
restrictions to the number of firms allowed to operate in the market are coupled with many legal (public) 
monopolies and undue regulatory constraints in network sectors, severely limiting competition. In fact, sec-
tors in which investment faces restrictions account for over 50 percent of the Tunisian economy, whether

Overcoming the Binding Constraint to Economic Growth in Post-Revolution Tunisia,” 2012, D. Pickard & T. Schweitzer, john 
F. Kennedy School of Government, Harvard University. The 2013 study finds (in addition to a lack of checks on executive power, 
which results in predation and protective policies) the high fiscal and regulatory cost of hiring workers to be a binding constraint 
to growth and a leading cause of low worker productivity, a lack of employment opportunities, and therefore to shared prosperity.

through the Investment Incentives Code, the Competition Law or specific sectoral legislation. Many of these 
sectors at present remain de facto closed to competition. In addition, there are legal constraints on the sale of 
the stakes held by the government in publicly controlled firms in some of these sectors. Network sectors such 
as gas and electricity; water mobilization, treatment, and distribution; and rail transport (infrastructure opera-
tion, passenger and freight transport) as well as other sectors such as the tobacco supply chain are legal/state 
monopolies. In these same sectors, regulatory barriers to international telecommunications and air transport 
entail de facto monopolies or oligopolies. Even segments of markets in gas, transport, and telecoms where 
private sector participation is feasible are closed in Tunisia compared to comparator countries.

The widespread lack of competition has far reaching implications for the performance of the economy. 

Firms in these sectors de facto benefit from rents that arise because they face limited competition. These firms 
remain profitable largely thanks to the protection they enjoy in the domestic market—at the expense of the 
consumers who are forced to buy more expensive and lower quality goods produced by the uncompetitive 
onshore firms—further reducing investment and productivity. The Competition Law does not in fact support 
competition and the weak governance of SOEs further undermines the operations of markets.

Political Connection, Economic Performance, and unequal opportunity

Heavily regulated market access has become a smokescreen for rents extraction by politically connected 
firms who receive privileged access to certain lucrative activities. Tunisia’s industrial policy increasingly 

was used as a vehicle for rent creation for the ousted president and his cronies (DPR). Regulatory capture, 
stemming from authorization requirements, investment restrictions or fiscal advantages would allow firms 
owned by Ben Ali’s clan to record spectacularly higher levels of output, profits, and growth than their compet-
itors.74 Thus it appears that capture was a major conduit for rent appropriation. The heavy cost of bureaucracy 

74 The analysis presented in the Tunisia DPR (2014) suggests that the superior performance of Ben Ali-owned firms to a large extent 
results from regulatory capture. In the absence of these regulations, performance differences between Ben Ali and other firms were 
much smaller, absent altogether, or even negative.

represents a burden especially for the small entrepreneurs that do not have the means to outsource the han-
dling of administrative requirements, and induce small companies to remain informal. The results of the 
World Bank 2012 Enterprise Survey highlight that overall the bureaucratic burden imposes a huge “tax” on 
firms’ competitiveness (further discussion follows).

There is significant evidence of tariffs and tax evasion, which hampers competition and gives a strong unfair 

advantage to the (larger and) better connected firms. Beyond the measurable direct and indirect costs that the 
heavy regulatory and bureaucratic burden imposes on firms, there is a significant issue related to how policies and 
regulations are applied today. This problem appears to be most prevalent in the administration of both customs 
and tax, suggesting these services require significant regulatory simplification reform (aiming to reduce the room 
for discretion). Discretionary implementation of customs regulations and tariff evasion results in an estimated 
annual revenue loss of at least US$100 million (approximately 0.15 percent of GDP). Moreover, import-monop-
olists (i.e. firms that are the only firms that import particular products) on average underreport in the magnitude 
of 131 percent relative to firms that are not. Corruption in customs has received considerable media attention 
and has also been identified as one of the key mechanisms by which cronies were able to reap rents.

The regulatory Environment for Private Sector investment

Excessive regulatory burden holds back private sector investment and business, as shown in the high 
management compliance time and the large estimated losses resulting from administrative interaction. 

The 2012 Enterprise survey shows that close to 25 percent of managers’ time is spent on meeting regulatory 
and bureaucratic burden, confirming the multiplicity of interactions with the different agencies. This figure 
is relatively high by international standards. Field interviews show that firms have dedicated personnel whose 
sole responsibility is to ensure that their firms fulfill all its administrative and bureaucratic requirements. Also, 
the ICA estimates that close to 13 percent of firm annual sales is spent to deal with regulations, covering the 
cumulative cost resulting from administrative interaction (direct and indirect costs including compliance 
time), a high percentage relative even to its regional peers. The weak regulatory environment pertaining to 
private businesses creates distortive incentives for firms, thwarts firm growth, and imposes high costs for busi-
nesses. A few examples of these regulatory constraints are presented in Box 4. Similarly, when compared with 
other countries in the region, Tunisia incurs almost as much losses in terms of sales due to investment climate 
issues as FCS countries like yemen and Iraq, while the proportion of time spent by senior managers dealing 
with regulation is much higher than comparator countries (Figures 39 and 40).

Trade and integration in the g lobal Economy held back by weak regulatory 
framework and business Environment

The integration into the global economy, despite being an engine of growth in the past decade, is now 
holding growth below potential by remaining limited in scope and depth. Tunisia’s integration with the 

global economy remains superficial, both in quantities and sophistication of exports. In a sense, Tunisia does 
not “produce” its manufacturing exports. It is mostly serving as a re-exporting hub for products originated 
and sold elsewhere, mainly France and Italy.75 This highly skewed trade pattern reflects the duality of the 

75 Tunisia DPR, WB 2014. Integration is also limited in terms of destination markets: while Tunisia appears integrated with the 
EU, in fact exports are concentrated almost only on France and Italy, linking in this way the performance of exports to a narrow 
demand set and raising the risk of fluctuations.

40

Box 3: How regulations affect businesses and distort incentives

Dealing with construction permits.  Tunisia ranks 122 out of 189 countries in the Doing Business indicators for dealing with construction 
permits, mainly due to (a) the large number of procedures required (19); (b) the long duration needed (average 94 days); and (c) the excessive 
cost (equivalent to 255 percent of income per capita), especially in the review of the building plans and the inspection stages. Multiple actions 
are required to improve the process, including adopting clearer legislation, streamlining the procedures and establishing official time limits, 
digitization, online approvals, rationalization of costs when possible, and putting in place one stop shops to deal with construction permits.
Simplifying the incentives regime. The Investment Incentives Code has so far had limited results in terms of attracting additional investment 
and jobs creation, despite its cost, and has exacerbated regional disparities. By allowing different tax regimesa for exporting and domestic firms, 
the Investment Incentives Code has segmented the economy between the “offshore” and “onshore” sectors, limiting the interaction between 
firms and thereby restricting competition to the detriment of performance in both sectors. This dichotomy has translated into limited back-
forward linkages and productivity spillovers between the export-oriented and more productive offshore sector, and the highly inefficient onshore 
firms. Moreover, the Code has exacerbated regional disparities. Over 85 percent of projects and jobs benefiting from the incentives were in fact 
created in the coastal regions. The analysis of the costs and benefits of the Code has shown that the total cost of incentives is approximately 
2.2 percent of GDP (in 2009) and that 79 percent of this amount is wasted, in that it benefits companies that would have invested even in the 
absence of incentives. In fact, the cost of each additional job created is extremely high for Tunisia, at approximately $20,000 per additional 
job. Further, the Code has attracted mainly: footloose” investment focused on assembly and other low value added activities. In addition, the 
incentives system is extremely complex and there appears to be an opportunity to drastically simplify it by removing incentives of little or no use 
(which however are expensive in terms of readability and administration). In fact the first four types of incentives (out of the list of 68 different 
types) account for nearly 85 percent of incentives, as many incentives schemes are redundant and remain unused.
Simplifying the tax regime. Taxpayers in Tunisia face a complex and unclear tax system, increasing the risk of evasion and reducing 
compliance. Tax compliance is costly for businesses that frequently need to interact with tax officials in order to meet the different requirements 
set by the Direction Générale des Impôts “DGI.” The small business tax regime (forfaitaire), has multiple thresholds and levels of segmentation 
which can be challenging for small businesses who want to comply but are unable to do so due to the complexity. The Ministry of Finance has 
initiated a process of simplification reforms over the past three years, however further more in depth process streamlining and simplification is 
necessary in order to address the compliance costs faced by taxpayers. In particular, VAT refund, appeals, and business cessation procedures 
mechanisms pose a significant burden to taxpayers and consume limited DGI resources to administer. The lack of clarity in tax legal text 
coupled with the dichotomy between the onshore and offshore tax rates creates opportunities for tax avoidance through transfer pricing, both 
locally and internationally.

a The Investment Incentives Code allows tax-free imports of intermediate inputs and grants 10 years of corporate tax holiday for firms producing for export, the 
“offshore sector.” These firms are also largely spared from the suffocating layers of red-tape and bureaucracy which afflict (mainly) the firms producing for the 
domestic market, the “onshore sector.” In theory the offshore firms could buy tax-free from the onshore, and could also sell a share of their production in the 
domestic market. However, very few offshore firms take up these options, since this would expose them to a heavy administrative burden.

concentrated toward low value added activities.76 
The performance of exports remains therefore be-
low potential and limited, with the second lowest 
exports growth (in volume) over the past 20 years 
in the region—and compared to other benchmark 
countries. The performance weakens further if we 
consider the low value added of exports: beside the 
low export sophistication compared to benchmark 
countries—and its slow and only slight increase over 
the past decade—Tunisia’s “share” of value added in 
exports has been estimated around 33 percent (Tuni-
sia DPR) versus an average of 70–80 percent for G7 
countries and 50 percent for countries heavily en-
gaged in processing trade (like China). See Figure 41.

The low contribution of trade to GDP with respect 
to peer countries is linked to the absence of broad 
institutional and structural reforms that included 
domestic deregulation, reforms of the regulatory 
framework and overall business climate. Despite

the trade reforms since the mid-1990s,77 Tunisia’s 
tariff structure and degree of openness vis-à-vis non 
EU countries remains relatively restrictive. This is 
mostly due (beside the persistent high logistic costs) to the prevalence of trade regulations or Non-Tariff 
Measures (NTMs) to manage trade flows.78 Tunisia has relatively low non-tariff measures (NTMs) frequency 
and coverage ratios, but it has highly bureaucratic and potentially discretionary procedures. While technical 
measures and standards (TBTs and SPS) are legitimate and increasingly used worldwide, they may be used 
for protectionist reasons and in a non-transparent way.79 Firms have repeatedly complained about the lack of 
transparency in the application of rules giving room to procedural inefficiencies, obstructions, and arbitrary 
conduct hampering the country’s overall competitiveness.

The contribution to the economy of the agricultural sector, which plays a key role in terms of job 
creation, especially in poor areas of the interior regions, has not reached its full potential. In trade, 

76 Companies from Europe have outsourced the assembly tasks and other low value added tasks to Tunisia, taking advantage of the 
very favorable offshore tax regime, the availability of cheap low-skilled human resources, and the subsidized energy. This has made 
it extremely difficult to move beyond assembly tasks and low value added processes.
77 Tariff reforms gradually reduced the average “most favored nation” (MFN) tariff (calculated as the simple mean of MFN duties 
level at the HS 6-digits level) from 30 percent in 2002 to 16 percent in 2011.
78 Non-tariff measures (NTMs), generally defined as non-price, typically reduce international trade in goods, changing quantities 
traded, or prices or both (UNCTAD, 2010).
79 Augier (2011), Feki (2013, background paper for this report, Basu et al. (2012) report the results from questionnaires administered 
to 395 Tunisian firms. The large majority (74 percent) reported Technical Barriers to Trade (TBTs)s followed by SPS measures 
(four percent). The majority of TBTs were reported by importing firms while for SPS, the majority was for exporting firms with 
five partners (France, Libya, Italy, Algeria, and Germany). Firms reported important procedural inefficiencies, obstructions, arbi-
trary conduct, and charges that were considered abnormally high, show disparity in frequency rates and coverage ratios.

agricultural products do not even meet Tunisia’s EU quota in exports. Agriculture accounts for about 10 

percent of GDP and total exports and it employs, directly and indirectly, about 20 percent of Tunisia’s labor 
force. Although output fluctuates with rainfall, the contribution of the agricultural sector to gross domestic 
product has remained relatively flat over the past decade. Food exports, largely geared toward the European 
market, are merely about 10 percent of total merchandise exports. yet in many cases Tunisia is not using its 
full EU quota. The current agricultural policy setting did not manage to support job-intensive growth as small 
and medium-sized family farms dominate agriculture. Agricultural policy fundamentally reduces incentives 
to labor-intensive crop and livestock production. As a consequence, agricultural policy does not contribute 
effectively to help reduce unemployment and regional disparities.80 

Agriculture in Tunisia has significant potential that could be unleashed through a combination of policy 
reforms, trade facilitation, and infrastructure investments. A crucial aspect would be the reform and pri-

oritization of the current agricultural policy framework. It is often argued that if Tunisia were to shift produc-
tion toward several Mediterranean products (arboriculture and horticulture) in which it enjoys a comparative 
advantage, it could boost the export of labor-intensive agricultural products to the EU market. Such a shift 
needs to be implemented gradually to ensure that it does not distort national food security objectives. It 
would require highly sensitive policy prioritization in the area of price support, input subsidies, standards 
and regulations and the marketing of agricultural products.81 Importantly, it would need significant hard and 
soft infrastructure investments including in irrigation, research and extension, land registry, and agricultural 
financing.82 

Services sectors underperform and undermine the competitiveness of the entire Tunisian economy. The 

relatively high contribution of services trade to Tunisia’s GDP (21 percent compared to 12 percent for OECD 
countries) would suggest both some openness and success on the trade front. However, a closer analysis of the 
country’s services exports reveals a high dependence on transport and travel (tourism). Travel alone represents 
close to 50 percent of Tunisia’s services exports, compared to 25 percent or less, on average, for the rest of the 
world and the OECD (Figure 42). Cumulatively, travel and transport represent almost three quarters of Tuni-
sia’s services exports. As a result, the share in total exports of other types of services such as financial and insur-
ance and communications and computer services remains well below the world average. The high dependence 
of sectors like travel and transport (i.e. tourism) makes the contribution of services trade to growth highly 
susceptible to political and security shocks. The deteriorating security and political situations has negatively 
and severely impacted these sectors and disrupted economic activity since 2011.

80 Tunisia’s agricultural policy objectives aim to achieve food security for a rather narrow set of commodities such as cereals and 
livestock production. Overall incentives are geared towards the production of non-competitive commodities in large-scale farms, 
often located in the coastal areas.
81 In terms of public expenditure efficiency, the current policy focus on achieving food security; partial self-sufficiency is costly. Es-
timates indicate that the budgetary costs may amount to about one percent of GDP. yet there are also significant costs for (largely 
urban) consumers because of the need to pay higher prices for food products. These costs are estimated at up to four percent of 
consumption expenditures. Most importantly, there are significant distortions of production and international trade. While there 
may be uncertainties regarding the true quantitative costs in household welfare and GDP, it is likely that the current policy pro-
duces a net overall net welfare loss, and contributes to major inequities to the Tunisian urban and rural population. Also, similar to 
other countries in the region, Government agriculture services lack responsiveness to producers’ priorities, which further reduces 
expenditure efficiency.
82 A system of income transfer to mitigate impacts on existing beneficiaries would likely be required.

Financing growth

Limited access to finance among MSMEs and households, low levels of financial intermediation, and 
weak financial sector regulation have prevented Tunisia’s financial sector from efficiently allocating 
resources toward the most productive projects, often to the advantage of politically connected firms. 

Similarly, the financial sector has not been an engine of inclusion through promoting access to finance and 
economic opportunity for large segments of the population, including low and middle income households 
and women and youth.

Access to finance remains underdeveloped at both household and firms levels in Tunisia. According to 

Findex data,83 fewer than five percent of adults save at a formal financial institution although 25 percent save 
informally and 32 percent report has access to an account at a bank or the post. The non-salaried population, 
despite being very large (1/3 of non-farm employment, est. 430,000 households and including creditworthy 
segments (average estimated household income: 2.5*minimum wage), is not served by financial institutions. 
The reliance on informal financial services also suggests that the supply of financial services targeted to the 

83 According to Findex 2011, about 32 percent of adults in Tunisia have access to an account (39 percent among men and 25 percent 
among women; and 26 percent among young adults). This level of financial inclusion is higher than regional 18 percent level 
(13 percent for women and 13 percent for young adults), however it is lower than the average H-MIC level of 57 percent (53 per-
cent for women and 49 percent for young adults). The access to accounts is significantly lower among women, young adults, rural 
population and population with primary or less education; the access to account among these groups are 25–26 percent in Tunisia. 
It compares favorably to MENA benchmarks for these categories; however, in the other U-MICs these indicators are at about 50 
percent or more on average. Only 16 percent of those in the bottom 40 percent of income have access to accounts, which is worse 
than any other groups (youth, women, rural, etc.) taken separately. The benchmark for U-MICs is 42 percent for this category, 
and it shows that the access to accounts for bottom 40 percent is very non-inclusive.

Box 4: First steps toward a more inclusive financial system

Micro finance. There have recently been important judicial and regulatory reforms that promote expansion of the Tunisian microfinance 
sector. In March 2011, microfinance was presented as a primary pillar in the Ministry of Finance’s post-revolution economic and social 
development program. The Ministry of Finance put in place a working group composed of donors, microfinance institutions (MFIs), government 
representatives, and outside specialists in order to develop a coordinated strategy for expansion and management of the sector. In conjunction 
with this strategy, the authorities have established a microfinance regulator and have adopted a new microfinance law in 2011. This new law 
allows for the creation of MFIs and allows foreign MFI networks to enter the country. New MFI entrants are critical to expand outreach and 
geographic coverage of microfinance services to the poor. Similarly, new entrants promote competition, which can lead to greater product 
diversification offered at more competitive terms and conditions. Further development of the regulatory framework and financial infrastructure 
is required in order to ensure responsible growth and innovation in the sector.
Restructuring of State-Owned Banks. In August 2014, the GoT approved the restructuring plans of two large SOBs. These restructuring plans 
aim at restoring banking sector stability, increasing banking sector competition and innovation, and improving access to finance.
Banking Sector regulation. After the revolution, the CBT has started implementing stricter banking sector regulation. The 2011 circular 
improved the corporate government practices while the 2013 circular on provisioning rules has forced the banks to significantly increase 
the level of their provision. In some cases, this sudden provisioning caused some banks to display Capital Adequacy Ratios (CADs) below the 
regulatory requirement (9 percent by December 2013 and 10 percent by December 2014). 
Housing finance. The Tunisian government is currently reviewing its housing finance sector as part a new housing strategy effort, with a view 
of increasing outreach to middle- and low-income households and enhancing affordability. Key elements of the strategy include provision 
of better incentives for lenders to further expand down-market including to informal sector households, and improving the targeting of 
credit linked public subsidies to ensure that they are provided to the lowest income households.a Furthermore, the Central Bank of Tunisia is 
considering steps to allow variable rate mortgage lending beyond 15 years, under conditions that preserve stability, and facilitate medium term 
housing loans that are well suited for self-construction.

a Successful targeting along those lines will significantly reduce the need for future subsidies and enable coverage of a larger number of beneficiaries.

poor is not adapted to financial needs, leaving a significant market gap. Access to finance was indicated as a 
major constraint by 34 percent of Tunisian firms, the second highest leaving aside concerns about political 
and macro uncertainty (which are exacerbated in the post-revolution transition phase). A 2014 IFC survey 
found that only 14 percent of MSMEs in Tunisia are served by bank financing, despite contributing 40 per-
cent of the overall GDP.

The banking sector suffers from a severe lack of competition, despite a large number of banks. The Tu-

nisian financial sector is small and dominated by banks, with assets equal to about 115 percent of GDP. The 
Tunisian banking system is characterized by limited profitability, inefficiency, low credit intermediation, and 
significant vulnerabilities. The absence of long term refinancing resources for banks mainly through capital 
markets limits long-term domestic lending and impacts credit affordability. As a result, financial deepening 
has been limited over the past decade and remains well below potential, the performance of the loan portfo-
lio is very weak and increasingly poses a risk to the stability of the financial system, and progress in product 
innovation and quality service has generally been low. The low level of competition in the banking sector 
appears due to an environment fraught with weak regulatory practices, and substantial failures in the corpo-
rate governance of, in particular, state owned banks (SOBs). In addition, inadequate bankruptcy procedures 
enable inefficient firms to survive (instead of having to restructure or exit), therefore (and to the advantage 
of the less productive units) slowing down the success of productive firms and the rechanneling of resources 
toward more productive uses.

Nonbank financial institutions could play an important role in providing credit, savings, and insurance 
services (among other financial services) to segments of households and firms not traditionally served by 

banks but development has so far been limited. The non-bank financial sector accounts for around 20 per-
cent of financial systems assets in Tunisia. Tunisia has a small insurance sector, with 19 companies primarily

Box 5: A comprehensive and integrated job strategy for Tunisia

Considerable work has been done to date to understand the key jobs challenges facing Tunisia: low labor force participation and insufficient 
job creation mostly in low productivity sectors. Even before the revolution and with a growing economy, the country was not creating enough 
jobs to absorb new entrants to the labor force. There were important job deficits affecting, in particular, higher education graduates. Today the 
unemployment rate is high (18 percent overall), particularly among youth (30 percent) and women (20 percent). At the same time, close to 80 
percent of women and 30 percent of youth (who are not studying) do not participate in the labor market.a Those who have a job, on the other 
hand, are mainly in informal activities in low productivity sectors. Regions in the South and West face particularly difficult conditions and overall 
there are wide regional disparities. This also extends to inequalities between the bottom 40 percent, who often live in lagging regions, to the 

upper 60 percent of the population. (See also Development Policy Review, 2014, and Labor Policy to Promote Good Jobs in Tunisia, 2014).
A jobs agenda for Tunisia should focus on three main components: (i) facilitating the creation of new jobs through private sector 
investments, (ii) increasing the productivity of jobs and upgrading production technologies, and (iii) connecting people to jobs. There is 
evidence that new (young) and productive firms create the majority of jobs in Tunisia. Yet, the rate of creation of new firms is low by international 
standards—half of that of other middle income countries such as Brazil or Chile. The business environment suffers from high barriers to entry, 
lack of competition, and a culture of entrepreneurship that thrives on rents rather than innovation. At the same time, current active labor market 
programs are dysfunctional and unable to effectively facilitate labor market transitions and connect individuals to jobs. Labor regulation and 
social insurance policies reach only a minority of workers and yet might be reducing incentives to create formal sector jobs. 
Changing current jobs dynamics, however, requires a comprehensive jobs strategy. Such a strategy needs to go beyond improving the 
investment climate (e.g., financial system reforms, competitiveness law) and the reform of labor policies (e.g. regulations, tax wedge, active 
labor market programs). These reforms are essential to promote investments and growth at the aggregate level, but they do not necessarily 
ensure the creation of the jobs needed to address the current issues. Such interventions do not directly support job creation and reduce 
unemployment in the most disadvantaged regions in Tunisia. Therefore, there is a need for greater detail in the identification of potential 
sources for jobs in specific sectors and occupations. They should target different segments of the labor force across regions and involve an 
assessment of multi-sector, short-term, interventions to be implemented in partnership between the public and private sectors. 

a Up to 80 percent of the unemployed have low education and have not finished secondary education, many of which have problem reading and writing.

focused on nonlife activities (85 percent of premiums) and annual premiums to GDP of about 2 percent. The 
equity and fixed-income markets are still small, with a market capitalization equal to 24 percent of GDP, lower 
than in regional peer countries such as jordan (112 percent) and Morocco (76 percent). Private equity remains 
small and the leasing sector, accounted for 15.5 percent of private gross fixed capital formation in 2010.84 Flaws 
in the institutional, legal, and regulatory framework prevent greater growth of NBFIs, instruments, and mar-
kets. Similarly, bankers and venture capital players in Tunisia point to a scarcity of patient funding products85 
as one of the major impediments for SMEs growth, and one of the causes of firms’ bankruptcy. Even though 
Tunisia has one of the most developed housing finance sector in the MENA region (the mortgage debt to GDP 
ratio is 17 percent), the level of market outreach is very low (around 4 percent of households access housing 
related credit), leaving large fringes to friends and family finance or informality. 

The role of employment and Social policy

Employment did not act as a channel for poverty reduction in the past decade. A comprehensive and 
integrated jobs strategy is therefore key to poverty reduction and shared prosperity moving forward. 

The reduction in poverty took place in Tunisia without large shifts either in employment dynamics or in the 
already existing gaps between poor and non-poor (or across different population groups defined by gender, 
skills, or location). In fact, the share of unemployment increased between 2005 and 2010 (or 2012, based on 
WB estimates) among the most vulnerable population groups but it also increased for the least vulnerable.

Unemployment rates also increased, although to a 
limited extent, among males and females, skilled 
and unskilled youths, or among urban and rural age-
working individuals. It increased among the bottom 
40 percent and the poor. While some population 
groups saw their self-employment rates go up slight-
ly,86 others, such as skilled youths saw their public 
sector salaried employment, the most coveted jobs in 
Tunisia, go down slightly. These findings lead to the 
suggestion that poverty reduction has been detached 
from the labor market and employment status. 

The Challenge of Job Creation 

Tunisia faces a considerable job challenge if eco-
nomic growth is not translated into adequate job

creation. Even during periods of relatively rapid 
economic growth, Tunisia experienced weak private 
sector job creation (five percent GDP growth was 
associated with a two percent increase in employ-
ment87). Insufficient job creation is one of the main causes of persistently high unemployment rates and may 
well remain so in the future if business continues as usual. Even under the assumption that participation rates 
remain at current levels (which is around 50 percent of the working age population88), demographic growth 
alone will push around 47,000 new entrants into the labor market on average per year.89 While higher growth 
rates are a necessary pre-requisite to increase job creation,90 they will need to be coupled with specific policies 
targeting constraints at the micro level, affecting firms and investment. Targeted sectorial policies that aim to 
promote jobs for specific population groups or regions are also an important complement to macro reforms 
aimed to improve macro-economic management, governance and political stability, and micro reforms tack-
ling inefficiencies and bias in the business environment.

A substantial part of investments in Tunisia are directed into lower productivity sectors with lower share 

of labor in total value added (i.e. sectors that are more capital intensive, see Figure 44). Investments in labor 
intensive sectors, such as health and education services, financial services, IT, and insurance are relatively low. 

86 In the case of females, rural residents, the unskilled youth and bottom 40 percent, increases in unemployment rates were also ac-
companied by increases in self-employment work.
87 Tunisia’s employment growth elasticity of only 0.4 is considerably lower than what is observed in other countries in the region.
88 Around 50 percent of the working age population participated in the labor market in 2014; close to 4 million people. This low 
rate is explained essentially by the very low participation rate of women (under 26 percent compared to 71 percent for men). The 
participation rate of women is expected to increase gradually, approaching 30 percent by 2020. But even if it remains at current 
levels, the total labor force is expected to increase to 4.5 million people in 2020, implying that the economy would need to create 
around 50,000 jobs on average per year over the next five years, without taking into account the stock of unemployed and potential 
transitions of individuals in or out of inactivity.
89 ILO, Economically Active Population, Estimates and Projections (6th edition, October 2011).
90 Under the status-quo, assuming that the economy grows at only four percent per year, the unemployment rate would decline by 
only one percentage point over the next five years.

This outcome is the result, among other factors, of distortive incentives introduced by the current investment 
code, which subsidizes mostly capital intensive sectors, coupled with the high tax wedge imposed by the social 
insurance system (more than 35 percent of wages, see section E below) which renders labor-intensive sectors 
relatively unattractive.91 In the absence of structural reforms that affect the allocation of investments, most 
jobs would continue to be created in sectors with low value added per worker, hindering the potential for 
structural transformation92 and with a negligible change in the rate of unemployment, particularly for highly 
skilled workers93 (see Box 6).

Jobs Dynamics at firms level

Younger, smaller and more productive firms have been the main engines of formal job creation in Tuni-
sia. However, their contribution to job creation remains well below potential pointing to the presence 

of substantial constraints to startup growth. Recent evidence on the firm-level determinants of job creation 
shows that in Tunisia—as in most countries in the region as well as in high-growth economies—it is younger 
firms and more productive firms that create more jobs (World Bank, 2014). Figure 49 illustrates this finding 
in the case of firm age. It shows that, while older firms tended to shed workers, net job creation was positive 
for firms in their startup period (first four years). Micro-startups—firms between 0 to 4 years of activity and 
with less than 4 workers—generated about 580,000 jobs in Tunisia between 1997 and 2010, accounting for 
the almost totality (92 percent) of aggregate net job creation. However, small firms did not grow. Micro firms 
with less than ten employees almost never enter larger size categories. Figure 50 summarizes the probabilities 
that firms transitioned among different size categories (or exited them) in 2007–2011. For instance, of all 
one-person firms in Tunisia in 2007, 22 percent exited by 2011, 76 percent remained one-person firms, and 
only two percent hired at least one more worker. The probability of all non-farm micro firms to grow beyond 
ten employees 4–5 years later is strikingly low at three percent in Tunisia (compared for instance to 12 per-
cent in Lebanon). This is a clear symptom of the country’s difficult business environment that prevents firm 
entry (or exit) and hence distorts the process of creative destruction, which would lead to faster productivity 
growth, investment, and jobs creation. A majority of Tunisian firms identify policy “uncertainty,” resulting 
from discriminatory policy implementation, as a “severe” or “major” obstacle to growth.

Access to Jobs

There are important variations in labor market outcomes and access to jobs across regions and be-

tween population groups. Labor force participation rates, unemployment, and type of employment (wage/

91 It is estimated that a 10 percentage point increase in the tax wedge can reduce formal employment by between one and five 
percentage points, with the effects being larger among low skilled workers (Lehmann and Muravyev 2014). This occurs as firms 
substitute labor with capital in the formal sector (that is, they reduce hiring) and as lower-productivity firms and jobs move into the 
informal sector. Many employers and workers could avoid heavy taxation by creating or taking informal jobs, but for larger formal 
sector firms this is more difficult—or potentially expensive—which would lead to strategies to save on labor.
92 As an illustration a four percentage-point increase in the investment rate in Tunisia financed by an increase in local savings, could 
add around 76,000 net jobs to the economy, but their distribution across sectors would vary greatly. The largest increases would 
be in sectors such as construction trade, non-metal industries, and transportation services. In some sectors there would not be 
significant changes in the number of jobs, but in others there could be net reductions, for instance, in agriculture, textiles, and 
tourism, in part due to a lower propensity to consume.
93 And only slight decrease in unemployment among semi-skilled workers, particularly youth (–3.5 percentage points).

Box 6: The complex relations between investment and job creation

New jobs in Tunisia need to come from higher investments in the private sector. However, the links between investments and jobs are 
complex and not unequivocal. The proportion between the stock of capital and labor in the economy or at the sectoral level is not constant; 
job creation therefore does often not have a linear relationship with new investments. Reallocating a given amount of capital to a specific 
sector can have very different consequences in terms of the number and composition of jobs created. These effects operate through two main 
channels: i) a substitution between capital and labor (as more capital reduces its rate of return, capital becomes cheaper relative to labor); and 
ii) the reduction of investments in other sectors, which reduces intermediate consumption from the sector in question.
Labor-intensive sectors might not necessarily be the ones with the highest job potential but could help address unemployment for 
disadvantaged groups and areas. Analytical work done as background to this diagnostic (CGE model simulation) shows how, contrary 
to what is usually assumed, that certain sectors such as agriculture might not necessarily be the sector with the highest potential for job 
creation (Figure 44). Given substitution effects (capital vs. labor) and the need to finance investments by reducing investments in other sectors 
(which can reduce the demand for intermediate inputs produced in agriculture), the net effect can be less important than what is estimated 
from input/output tables. However, the jobs created in some of the labor-intensive sectors (including agriculture, but also textile and wood 
processing) can be very important for unskilled workers both adults and youth (which continue to remain the bulk of unemployed).a Moreover, 
depending on the sector chosen, specific investments entail varying levels of indirect job creation (Figures 45–48). Even if a sector does 
not create a high number of direct jobs, demands of intermediate consumption from others sectors can indirectly create jobs. For example, 
investments in food or IT sectors would lead to a reduction in jobs in those respective sectors but would indirectly create a disproportionately 
high number of jobs in other sectors.
It is crucial to ensure that investments are targeted at sectors with potential to support the structural transformation of the economy and 
to increase productivity at the macro level. Given the current economy, without structural reforms that affect the allocation of investments, 
most jobs would be created in sectors with low value added per worker (Figure 45). The largest increases would be in sectors such as 
construction, trade, textile, and wood. Jobs in different sectors require diverse profiles in terms of skills both for adults and youth and therefore 
have heterogeneous impact on various groups of the active population. It is crucial to ensure that the currently untapped human capital is

allowed to fully contribute to the progress of the economy and that jobs would be the main channel trough which economic development 
operates. Creating a level playing field and nurturing specific sectors via non-distortive policies will encourage investment in new products 
and enable the growth of sectors in which Tunisia appears to have a strong comparative advantage. Tunisia’s high potential in services sectors 
could bolster the process of structural transformation and become a source of dynamic growth and jobs creation, notably for university 
graduates. Soft policies cover capacity-building policies such as investments in infrastructure (transport, telecoms, and energy), fostering 
technical and scientific skills, and promoting research; they also include horizontal incentivizing measures such as macroeconomic policies 
(openness to trade, exchange rate policy, and fiscal and financial incentives), promoting human capital and research, supporting business 
development, harnessing foreign capital and knowledge, and labor market policies. 

a Reallocating US$10 million dollars to agriculture in Tunisia could generate around 140 new jobs. Other sectors in the economy can have larger impacts 
in terms of job creation For instance, for the same level of reallocation trade and education can create about 305 and 237 jobs, respectively. Investment in 
sectors that are high tech might even result in net job destruction in the short term (but would be a first step towards moving up the value ladder).

self-employment, formal/informal) vary markedly across population groups (youth, women) and regions. 
More disadvantaged regions tend to have lower participation rates and higher unemployment. Living in rural 
areas decreases the probability of finding a formal job. Women, youth, and the poor are, as discussed, more 
likely to be inactive or in low quality jobs. Education increases the probability of joining the labor force,94 but 
its effects on employment status are mixed, with higher educated people facing higher probability of being 
unemployed. This signals the presence of a skill mismatch combined with a gap between supply and demand. 
Overall, these outcomes reveal barriers to access to jobs that are linked to poor labor market conditions.

The Tunisian labor market is characterized by deep dysfunctions: rules and institutions have failed to 
protect either workers or jobs and exacerbated the bias toward low-value added activities. The growing 

94 Educational attainments increase women probability to join the labor force (a woman with a university degree is 64 percent more 
likely to participate in the labor force than a woman who completed only primary education.

graduate unemployment over the past decade re-
flects the structural mismatch between the increas-
ingly educated labor force and an economy that has 
remained stuck in low productive activities. As much 
as 77 percent of Tunisia’s workforce is employed in 
low-productivity sectors. High-productivity service 
sectors absorbed only 7.7 percent of total employ-
ment. Available jobs have been of low quality, both 
in terms of value added and also in terms of low job 
security. jobs have increasingly been informal or in 
fixed-term contracts, which entail no workers’ pro-
tection, and have translated into an overly high level 
of turnover: 45 percent of workers do not have an 
employment contract, 64 percent of jobs are either informal or self-employment. The public sector remains 
the main source of formal employment in Tunisia, with 22 percent of employment while only 14 percent of 
all employed individuals are in the private formal sector.

Tunisia’s labor policies and regulations tend to lower wages and discourage job creation particularly 

for educated youth. Half of the companies perceive the labor code as a constraint (ITCEq firm’s survey). 
Despite a competitive minimum wage relative to the value-added per worker, Tunisia’s labor tax and contri-
bution as percentage of wage are among the highest in the world, much higher than MENA or other MICs’ 
averages, and even higher than that of OECD. In Tunisia payroll taxes and social security contributions reach 
almost 29 percent of wages. The average tax-wedge in Tunisia could be as high as 38 percent. These high tax 
and contribution rates inflate the actual labor costs for the firms, and they impact Tunisia’s labor factor com-
petitiveness. They are also at the expense of the labor force, which obtains a lower share of actual labor costs 
and a lower job creation level. Moreover, firing rules in Tunisia are among the most restrictive in the world. 
The rigidity associated with terminating contracts limits turnover in the labor market by increasing informal 
jobs and by reducing job opportunities for the new entrants. Elasticity of employment to economic growth

Box 7: Female labor force participation and access to jobs

At 27 percent, Tunisia has one of the lowest female labor force participation in the world. If things remain the same, it would take 
Tunisia about 150 years to attain the current world average. Both economic and social factors explain such low participation: low market 
wages coupled with high reservation wages (that could arise because of the high cost of and low access to child care and domestic work), 
transportation constraints, and/or low employment quality or safety of available jobs are, among others, important economic factors that 
undermine women’s decisions to join the labor force. These factors are likely to be important in a country like Tunisia, where about half of all 
wage earners work without a contract and in low-pay/low-productivity jobs, conditions that appear particularly binding for women. 
Demographic factors, combined with social norms and economic factors, play an important role in determining women decision to work: 
recent analysis shows that marriage decreases a woman’s likelihood of participating in the labor force by 31 percent compared to single 
women (other things being equal). Corroborating this statement, data from the 2010 labor force survey reveal that family reasons are the most 
often cited reason for women being out of the labor force. Female role models can influence a woman’s decision to look for work, especially 
in societies driven by different cultural preferences and values. Women look at the behavior of other women in the household as role models, 
thus influencing their preferences. For instance, the education of the spouse of the household is positively associated with female labor force 
participation. Women living in households where the head’s spouse has a university degree are 12 percent more likely to participate in the 
labor force compared to women who live in a household with a spouse who attained primary education at most.
Local labor market conditions (such as the prevalence of unemployment in the region/area of residence) also influence female labor 
force participation. Women appear to be less motivated to enter the labor force if they feel there are limited employment opportunities (that is, 
discouragement). For instance, women living in localities where female unemployment rates are higher are less likely to participate in the labor 
force (an increase of the regional female unemployment rate of one percent decreases the probability of a woman participating by almost one 
percent). On the contrary, in regions where unemployment rates among men are higher, women tend to display higher rates of participation. 
This is explained because women’s reservation wages decrease if men in the household are idle, thus making it necessary for the household 
to get additional sources of income (an increase in the regional male unemployment rate of one percent increases the probability of a woman 
participating by almost one percent)

Box 8: The mechanisms of social exclusion – youth inactivity in Tunisia

The lack of jobs opportunities for young (and educated) Tunisians has long-term consequences as it further discourages them to engage 
in education or job search. Young people who are not in education, employment, or training (NEETs) comprise a substantial proportion of 
the potential youth labor force in Tunisia, with one in three young men in rural Tunisia (33.4 percent) and one in five in urban Tunisia. Rates 
are even higher for young women, where half of the young women living in rural areas are NEET (and one third in urban areas). Young people 
without work, who are no longer attending any school or training program, spend on average more than three years searching before finding 
a job, making increasingly less likely for them to find formal employment.
The severity and regional incidence of NEET reflect the extent of regional disparities. NEET affects more than one-quarter in the coastal 
region (23.6 percent urban, 37.3 percent rural), more than one-third in the south (35.9 percent urban, 47.9 percent rural), and about one-third 
of youth in the interior region These young people, excluded from the labor market for years, are referred to as “Generation Jobless”.a Youth in 
the interior face an especially unproductive abyss of years transitioning between their school and work lives. As focus groups revealed, youth 
have little faith in their skills or qualifications as they attempt to navigate a system they perceive to be rife with corruption. 

a The Economist 2013

is among the lowest in the region, less than 0.5 during 2000 to 2009, compared to the 0.8 MENA average. 
Limited labor mobility also reduces the economy’s capacity to respond to the new opportunities and to shift 
toward higher value-added activities. While Tunisia needs to increase job creation for (educated) youth, its 
employment elasticity to the knowledge investment is among the lowest in the region, at only 0.4, against the 
MENA average of 0.7 (World Bank, 2013).

Social Protection, Equity, and resilience 

An extensive system of subsidies/transfers and social protection contributed, despite great inefficiencies, 
to keep the cost of basic necessities affordable for the poor and protect them from shocks. As a legacy of 

the old socio-economic model, Tunisia continues to spend today about 25 percent of GDP on social sectors

(including social protection, health, and education).95 This includes an array of programs, such as universal 
food and energy consumption price subsidies, social security (pensions and health insurance), unconditional

95 Tunisia´s social expenditure mainly comprises education (accounting for 20 percent of total public expenditure), followed by 
consumption subsidies (12.9 percent), health (8.3 percent), direct cash transfers and in-kind social assistance (1.3 percent, of 
which direct cash transfers accounts for nearly 0.5 percent) and active labor market programs (3.9 percent). Nearly 3000 million 
Tunisian dinars (TND) were spent on fuel, food, and transport subsidies, accounting for five percent of GDP as of 2012. Of this 
spending, fuel subsidies account for 1500 million TND and 1200 million TND goes towards subsidizing food and basic products.

cash transfers, and subsidized health care cards in-
tended for low-income and poor groups. In addi-
tion, in principle the government’s provision of 
basic services such as water, education and health 
services are meant to ensure equitable access to ba-
sic necessities (see Box Av.1 in Annex v). While 
improving Tunisians’ welfare, social policy was first 
and foremost designed to compensate for the lack 
of civil and political liberties. Social policies thus 
were not targeted according to efficiency, fairness, 
or effectiveness but rather served to discourage any 
perception from citizens to be excluded by the in-
creased welfare of the country.

Consumption subsidies (particularly subsidies to 
diesel, gasoline, electricity, and liquid petroleum 

gas (LPG) consumption) are the most regressive of 

these policies. Expenditures on basic food, energy 
and transport subsidies paid through the budget rep-
resent today about seven percent of GDP (of which 
about two-thirds is spent on energy products). This 
is today over 10 times that spent on direct social 
transfers to lower-income groups in the form of cash 
(pension, employment, and social assistance, see 
Figure 55). This expenditure benefits both vulnera-
ble and higher-income households, with nearly half 
of energy subsidies consumed by the top 40 percent 
of the income distribution. For diesel and gasoline, 
nearly 60 percent and 70 percent of subsidies accrue 
to the richest 20 percent alone. While food subsidies 
are relatively less regressively distributed, the expen-
diture on subsidies that accrues to the top 60 per-
cent of the income distribution is expenditure that 
may be better invested in policies to mitigate shocks, 
boost purchasing power, and enhance employability 
more effectively for the bottom 40 percent.

A generous (although not very large), nominally targeted cash transfer scheme for the poor and vulner-
able represents about 21 percent of total consumption for the lowest quintile.96 Tunisia’s national cash 

transfer program, though inefficiently targeted, accounted for nearly 420 million dinars as of 2013, or just 
under 0.4 percent of GDP (Figure 55). However, nearly 60 percent of the benefits do not go to the poorest 
20 percent for whom the program ought to be targeted. Due to inefficiencies with the pension system and 

96 Social assistance programs cover about 13 percent of the population within the first consumption quintile. The Program of Sup-
port to the Needy Families (PNAFN), operated by the Ministry of Social Affairs, is the main non-contributory system of social 
protection in Tunisia. It is mostly composed (about 70 percent) of unconditional cash transfers and it also includes cards for health 
services.

high informality, many older persons benefit from the cash transfer program despite not being poor (based on 
$2 per day). Nearly 60 percent of beneficiaries of the cash transfer program are over the age of 65, suggesting 
that this program is acting as both a poverty-mitigating measure as well as a social pension by default. Overall, 
nearly 235,000 households benefit from cash transfers, or nine percent of the population, as of 2014. The cash 
transfers come with health care cards that, in principle, entitle beneficiaries to exemptions from co-pay at pub-
lic hospitals for largely preventative health care services and basic pharmaceuticals. In effect, due to limited 
or low-quality supply, most beneficiaries forego care or pay out of pocket for pharmaceuticals. In addition, 
550,000 low-income individuals benefit from a subsidized health care card also managed under the social 
safety net framework, which entitles beneficiaries to preferential co-payment rates for health care services.

Box 9: A fragmented system that does not provide adequate coverage

Given lagging economic growth, an informality rate estimated at 50 percent, Tunisia’s social security system, which should be a key 
pillar of poverty mitigation and equity, currently faces significant deficits and inadequate coverage. In terms of pensions, as of 2014 the 
system is projected to face a deficit of approximately two percent of GDP by 2018, with the burden of inadequate coverage falling on the low-
skilled and poorer groups. Tunisia’s modern social security system dates from 1898 with the creation of a pay-as-you-go (PAYG) system for 
civil servants. Today, the system is fragmented into two different funds and spans different public pension schemes for various categories of 
workers, with nearly 70 percent of the labor force enrolled. Social insurance and pensions are administered by two main national insurance 
funds. Pensions for civil servants and contractual workers and emergency family loans are administered by the Caisse Nationale de Retraite et 
de Prévoyance Sociale (CNRPS), while pensions for private sector workers are administered by Caisse Nationale de Sécurité Sociale (CNSS). 
The number of contributors as of 2012 is approximately 1.5 million for CNRPS and 646,000 for CNSS. Similarly, health care in Tunisia is 
financed through a combination of social health insurance (Caisse Nationale de l’Assurance Médicale or CNAM), general government revenues, 
and private spending, with health insurance accounting for an increasingly greater share (see section E below on health services). A more 
coordinated approach is needed to enhance coverage and sustainability of both pensions and health insurance. By pooling resources and 
contributions, particularly from non-poor informal sector workers, the sustainability of various social protection schemes becomes more viable

In total, the social safety net programs benefit nearly 23 percent of the population, many of whom are 

middle- or upper middle-income who ought to be enrolled in contributory programs, as benefits and the 
quality of services are stretched as it is. However, despite great inefficiencies in targeting and allocation, these 
programs still remain relatively more efficiently targeted than universal subsidies and can be improved further 
to protect the neediest households (and those that may become so in the future) from income shocks.

Growing fiscal pressure is leading to a revision of some of the structured social assistance—direct and 

indirect—to ensure fiscal sustainability. The slowdown in economic growth and revenue projections will 
require the Government to increase the efficiency of public expenditure, some of which might directly impact 
the poor. For instance, energy subsidy expenditures97 are undergoing revision with the objective of lowering 
the fiscal burden.98 The impact on consumption for the most vulnerable groups99 might be relevant if these 
reforms are not accompanied by a system to protect them. 

Shielding the most vulnerable from the impact of fiscal consolidation and structural reforms should 
therefore be a key priority when considering sustainability of any progress toward the twin goals.

Governance in Tunisia had been characterized by a strong executive with limited checks and balanc-
es, allowing for elite capture to flourish through administrative favoritism, repression of dissent, and 

97 As for food subsidy reform, given the importance of food subsidies for poorer households and despite existing leakages (e.g., to 
hotels or industry), the government will assess at a later stage how to reform these, and may be able to use lessons from the energy 
subsidy reform to design compensatory measures.
98 The government’s medium-term objective is to replace generalized price subsidies with a well-targeted social safety net, starting 
explicitly with the most regressive energy subsidies. As a first step, it increased fuel and electricity prices by around 14 percent 
between September 2012 and March 2013, which has generated one percent of GDP in annual budgetary savings. the government 
also plans to revise and reinstate an automatic price setting mechanism (at least for petroleum and diesel products) by 2014 or 
when retail prices are close to international prices. These increases should be accompanied by a new household compensation (and 
targeting) strategy for selected products. (IMF program note 2013).
99 Recent analysis (verme 2013) reports negligible direct effects of the increase in prices of fuels and electricity on the households’ 
expenses (as they are highly regressive). However, for fuels, the indirect effects might be larger. In addition, food subsidies are an 
important component of household income.

characterized by the dominance of the executive 
branch over both the legislature and judiciary, the 
latter two being unable to provide proper checks 
and balances on executive abuses. During this peri-
od Tunisia fared poorly on a number of governance 
indicators in terms of core governance empirics. 
In 2008 Global Integrity rated it as “very weak” in 
terms of executive accountability, due primarily to 
limited checks and balances, and “very weak” on 
election integrity. The press was rated as “not free” 
by Freedom House. A single party dominated the 
legislature, and the judiciary lacked independence. 
Elections were neither free nor fair. Political opposi-
tion was met with considerable repression, includ-
ing imprisonment and banishment. These gaps were 
both developed and exploited to further elite cap-
ture by the Ben Ali regime and its supporters, while 
at the same time minimizing space for criticism and 
opposition. In addition, both high and low level 
corruption were considerable. Global Financial In-
tegrity estimated that the amount of illegal money lost from Tunisia due to corruption, bribery, kickbacks, 
trade mispricing, and criminal activity between 2000 and 2008 was, on average, approximately two percent 
of GDP per year (approximately US$1.2 billion per annum). With a population of approximately 10.6 mil-
lion that means a loss of almost $110 per person per year in the unrecorded transfers of illegal capital (Global 
Financial Integrity 2011).100

Some of the key governance failures were not adequately captured in the rankings. Tunisia had strong 

governance ratings pertaining to business licensing and regulation as well as taxes and customs (though the 
enforcement of tax laws has often been criticized as being discriminatory). The Anti- Corruption Law was 
seen as of very good quality, although the implementation of this law was considered very weak. Indeed, 
there were important shortcomings and failures not captured by these rankings, most notably related to poor 
progress made on voice and accountability, the highly centralized decision making process which undermined 
the system of checks and balances (which largely existed on paper only), and more generally the substantial 
discretion in the application of the laws.

Since the 2011 Revolution new governments introduced some reforms to address governance gaps, par-
ticularly in relation to enhancing civil and political rights. Successive regimes have undertaken a number 

100 Further, in the aftermath of the Tunisian revolution, assets of the Ben Ali clan were confiscated. The confiscation process involved 
the 114 individuals, including Ben Ali himself, his relatives, and his in-laws, and concerned the period from 1987 until the 
outbreak of the revolution. The confiscation commission estimates that the total value of these assets combines is approximately 
US$13 billion, or more than one quarter of Tunisian GDP in 2011 (which would correspond to a one-off transfer per person 
of approximately US$1,230 per person in Tunisia, i.e. about one quarter of average income). Among the assets that were seized 
were over 300 enterprises (some of which were abroad), 550 properties, 48 boats and yachts, 40 stock portfolios, and 367 bank 
accounts.

of steps to address the serious governance gaps plaguing Tunisia. New elections regulations were passed, 
allowing for greater public engagement in the election process and enhancing accountability of elected of-
ficials. The right to access to information was enhanced by the Constitution and other legislation requiring 
disclosure of public documents, and the establishment of an open data website offering access to public data 
(data.gov.tn) that enables citizens to make direct requests for information. Compliance is to be monitored by 
an independent commission. A number of civil rights enjoy constitutional protection, including: academic 
freedom; rights to peaceful assembly and demonstration; freedom to establish political parties, unions, and 
associations; the right of workers to strike; and freedoms of expression, opinion, thought, and publication. 
Citizen engagement has been enhanced by government decisions allowing citizen participation in the public 
service assessment process, delivery of public services and legislative drafting; a public consultation website 
was created to promote participation in policy-making.101 

The extent to which citizens can adequately exercise these rights will impact social and political exclu-

sion. Exercise of these rights could also help promote greater transparency in public administration and 
accountability of government officials. In part due to these reforms, Tunisia’s ranking by Freedom House 
was raised to “free,” and political rights were given the highest score possible. Some backlash has taken place 
against exercise of civil and political rights, usually justified by security concerns. While instances of arrest 
and conviction of journalists on grounds of defamation have been fewer, independent reporting has been 
punished on security grounds. Cases have been brought against bloggers and union activists on grounds of 
defaming the army or criticizing the GoT on security measures.102 The use of military courts, which lack fair 
trial safeguards, to try civilians is particularly problematic. Criminal cases have been brought against internet 
users based on content they posted online. Civil society organizations have been closed by the government, 
without following established procedures, based on antiterrorism and security justifications. 

Steps have been taken to address elite capture and other forms of corruption, but progress remains 

limited and legislative gaps remain. An anti-corruption commission was established in 2012 and later con-
verted to the Good Governance and Anti-Corruption Commission in 2014 per the Constitution. More than 
five hundred cases have been investigated, with over one hundred forwarded for further investigation and 
prosecution. However, very few prosecutions have taken place, with the notable exception of trails in absentia 
for members of the Ben Ali and Trabelsi families. Given that the Commission is a relatively new institution 
its performance would need to be tracked over time. Allegations of public sector corruption can also be made 
online via a corruption reporting website.103 The frameworks covering financial disclosure by public officials 
is weak, especially in regards to higher-level executive officials. The framework covering conflict of interest is 
even weaker, with very few restrictions applicable to the President, members of parliament, ministers or civil 
servants. Given the history of elite capture in Tunisia, there is a particularly urgent need for stronger frame-
works governing both of these issues.

A framework exists for addressing human rights abuses under former regimes and vetting institutions 

that had been involved in corruption. Tunisia is one of the three countries in the MENA region, along with 
Libya and yemen. to have passed legislation on transitional justice. The Law on Transitional Justice was adopt-
ed in December 2013. Its primary aims are: addressing past human rights abuses through truth-telling and by 
holding perpetrators accountable; providing restitution and reparations to victims of human rights abuses to 
promote national reconciliation; guaranteeing non-repetition of human rights abuses; and guiding transition 
from an authoritarian state to a democratic system that guarantees protection of rights. Specialized courts are 
to be established to prosecute perpetrators of gross human rights abuses.104 A Truth and Dignity Commission 
is responsible for conducting hearings involving political, economic, and social crimes abuses since july of 
1955. Addressing past abuses is a regular component of transitional justice regimes. Tunisia’s framework goes 
further, by mandating the Truth and Dignity Commission to undertake institutional reforms aimed at dis-
mantling and rectifying the system of corruption and repression conducted under previous regimes in order 
to guarantee non-repetition and establishment of the rule of law. These reforms are to be instituted through 
revision of legislation and vetting of public sector entities previously involved in corruption to address vul-
nerabilities. While the latter could potentially be instrumental in addressing corruption and elite capture, it 
would require considerable institutional capacity that may not yet be present in the Commission. Civil society 
has been particularly active in promoting transitional justice initiatives, for example the establishment of a 
Transitional justice Academy and training of judges and other officials on transitional justice issues. 

Governance shortcomings affect the quality of service delivery. Responsibilities for delivery of services 

and planning remain very centralized. Tunisia is facing an important mismatch between institutional man-
dates and the accompanying fiscal assignments. Despite embarking on ambitious decentralization, the pro-
vision of basic services such as health and education, as well as basic infrastructure (e.g., water, sanitation, 
electricity, and solid waste management) remains highly centralized. These services continue to be provided 
by line ministries, their de-concentrated regional offices, and affiliated state-owned enterprises. Additionally, 

104 As defined by the law, gross human rights abuses include: murder; rape and sexual violence; torture; enforced disappearance; and 
execution without fair trial guarantees.

Box 10:  Strengthening the role of public procurement and Public Financial Management in fighting 
corruption

Tunisia scored relatively well on Public Financial Management (PFM) compared to its income group average in the PEFA assessment from 
2010.However, according to a recent assessment,a the PFM system has not aged well and is no longer entirely suited to the demands 
of modern management. Specifically, the system does not permit precise detection of waste and corruption, and has been identified as one 
of the area’s most vulnerable to corruption. Since 2011 the pace of reform has been slowing down. There are major weaknesses in terms 
of lack of multi-year fiscal planning, credible expenditure policy, investments planning and management and in the area of accounting and 
reporting. The area of controls and audits has a solid base in terms of quality of staffing but is hampered by organizational inefficiencies and 
an approach to audit that is insufficiently risk-based and geared toward performance. The country is quite advanced in terms of Performance-
Based Budgeting (PBB) but critical steps still have to be made to have a measurable impact on public sector performance.
Public procurement accounts for close to 18 percent of the Tunisian GDP and 40 percent of the State budget. Until 2011, it was highly 
inefficient, lacking transparency and prone to corruption. In 2011 the Interim Government started to take some short-term actions in particular 
thanks to the 2011 Governance and Opportunities DPL. In 2012, Tunisia conducted a holistic diagnostic of the public procurement system using 
OECD-DAC self-assessment method, with the active support of the World Bank and the African Development Bank. As a result, the government 
adopted a new procurement decree, effective since June 1, 2014, that established new procurement institutions and the foundation of a more 
transparent procurement system (e.g., e-procurement). In parallel, the Bank provided support in various areas, in particular through: (i) the 
mobilization of an IDF Grant for the modernization of the Tunisian public procurement system with a focus on the design of a capacity building 
strategy; (ii) the implementation of a regional program to support SMEs access to public procurement activities and (iii) the establishment 
of a MENA network of public procurement experts to foster integration and knowledge sharing within the region. However, these actions are 
limited in scope and any substantial improvement of the procurement system in Tunisia will require much larger involvement and sustainable 
assistance from the Bank which should include the following reform priorities: (i) strengthening procurement institutions in particular by 
establishing an independent and functioning complaint review mechanism; (ii) professionalization of the procurement function at the central 
and local level; (iii) improving efficiency in procurement processes by removing unnecessary bottlenecks, strengthening the audit function 
and supporting the decentralization of procurement decisions; and (iv) modernization of the procurement system by dissemination of 
e-procurement and development of data and performance management tools. These actions have to be conducted both at the central and 
local level to serve the purpose of delivering better services to the population. 

a Conducted jointly by the OECD and the interim Tunisian government

investments at the local level are highly centralized: municipal investments account for only 10 percent of all 
investments at the local level while the remaining 90 percent is financed and implemented by line ministries. 
This centralized system has done little to involve municipalities in managing urban development within their 
jurisdictions. For the framework of planning, connecting, and financing to work, a good governance structure 
is a prerequisite. Coordination across levels of government and between neighboring jurisdictions will become 
particularly important as Tunisia moves toward greater decentralization and subsidiarity to ensure the coher-
ence and alignment of investments in ways that maximize their value at the local, regional, and national levels.

Recent results from service delivery surveys at the national and local levels show that poorer and less 
educated groups are less likely to rank services positively, and redress mechanisms are weak. Until 2011, 

this weak performance has not been monitored or assessed and citizens’ engagement, needed to help build ac-
countability and performance, has been non-existent. Recently, reforms and measures have been taken to be-
gin enhancing transparency and voice in ensuring services meet the needs of the most vulnerable in particular. 
The wide majority of respondents from a household survey find services in Tunisia to be of poor quality, but 
more importantly, grievance redress mechanisms are weak.105 Health and education are perceived to be of rela-
tively better quality (with 33 and 36 percent, respectively, of respondents rating services as “poor”) than social 
and employment services (56 and 76 percent, respectively). Despite the relatively low perception of the qual-
ity of services in Tunisia, only between 10–20 percent of respondents admitted they had specific complaints 
about the services rendered. Less than half of the respondents who had complaints about the services actually 
issued the complaints formally. Rural respondents formally complained more than urban especially regarding

Box 11: Building citizen engagement for service delivery in Tunisia

Following the 2011 revolution, a participatory process for systematically monitoring the performance of public services by civil society, 
citizens, and service providers is being progressively instituted. The first national scorecard launched by the Prime Ministry sought 
public feedback on over ten public services from April 19 to May 4, 2012. Approximately 8,500 citizens provided feedback and results were 
published online (http://www.consultations-publiques.tn). A second national scorecard on services from the National Health Insurance Fund 
was launched in 2012. In 2012, the government launched consultations with the Tunisian civil society (citizens, patients, HR, experts) to build 
a consensual sector diagnosis and a shared vision of the Tunisian health system. A community health project that includes participatory service 
delivery planning is piloted with the Bank’s support in Jendouba, Tataouine and Kasserine.
As of September 2013 participatory monitoring has been gradually implemented but it remains limited, in part due to a lack of clear 
institutional linkages between participatory monitoring, budgeting, and policy formulation. The reform nevertheless institutionalizes 
mechanisms for participatory evaluation of public service performance improvement, as overseen by the National Controllers Body for Public 
Services (Contrôle Général des Services Publics, CGSP) in coordination with the Prime Ministry’s Department of Public Administration Reforms 
(Direction Générale de la Réforme Administrative, DGRA) and concerned line ministries. The overall aim of the participatory monitoring policy 
is to strengthen citizen voice and accountability in the evaluation and planning of public service delivery. Given that the reform instituted a 
systematic participatory process among government, citizens and civil society for evaluating and reforming services within a supreme audit 
institution such as the CGSP, a more direct link between accountability and access to services can be developed for enhancing opportunity for 
the bottom 40 percent and the poorest groups
The Government is currently introducing an annual performance assessment system for local governments that will offer another 
supply-side tool for enabling citizen engagement in service delivery. The system comprises an annual assessment of each Tunisian 
local government’s performance on a set of indicators measuring the local government’s performance in governance, management, and 
sustainability. The results of the assessment will be made public, will inform citizens as they participate in annual municipal investment 
planning, and they will be used by the central government to allocate capital block grants to local governments. The system was designed in 
2015, will be piloted in 2016 and in full effect in 2017.

employment services and education. In the vast majority of cases when citizens provided feedback, they stated 
that their complaint went unaddressed. These trends, and similar work undertaken by the government, fur-
ther highlight major gaps between citizens’ real needs and what services are offered in the public sector. 

The framework for strengthening accountability adopted in Tunisia has therefore aimed, as an initial 
step, to introduce the tracking of service delivery performance in a highly transparent, participatory way. 

Prior to the revolution, performance targets with which citizens could hold providers accountable were absent 
in Tunisia. Agency and voice of service users and beneficiaries had not been a part of public sector reforms. 
Public financial management and civil service policies generally do not explicitly incorporate incentives for 
achieving agreed-upon results. For transparency and participation in service delivery to realize their full poten-
tial in Tunisia, a stronger policy commitment to both demand- and supply-side reforms is needed. Reinforcing 
demand-side governance in service delivery should be supported through greater public disclosure, participa-
tory budgeting and citizen and civil society involvement. These mechanisms however, will be inadequate in the 
absence of structural reforms such as greater autonomy and decentralization, reforms to introduce performance 
incentives into civil service management, and budgetary and public financial management reforms.

SOEs and Autonomous Government Agencies (AGA) play an important role in the governance of sec-
tors. These entities have not been achieving the required performance and are generally poorly managed 

and poorly monitored by the government. These agencies are often major actors in key sectors such as bank-
ing, transport, energy, and industry, where they play an important economic and social role. In the agriculture 
and agro-industry sector for instance, various SOEs are controlling production, distribution, and commer-
cialization of products, and are enjoying monopoly positions. SOEs and AGAs have been criticized for weak 
management of public resources and for suffering from lack of accountability at the managerial level. The 
fact that the central government is not adequately equipped to play its role as shareholder is further adding to 
the problem. Box 12 below presents an illustration of the variety of governance issues found in sectors where 
substantial governance challenges have been identified (and, in the case of telecom, started to be addressed).

Box 12: Sector-specific governance challenges

Water and Sanitation: A recent OECD studya showed that some of the issues faced by Tunisia in the water sector, like the aging of infrastructures, 
weak service delivery performance, and financing difficulties are the direct consequence of weak governance. Governance of the water sector 
is characterized by strong centralization of responsibilities and decision–making, and by an institutional inertia that is an impediment to 
reform. In addition, the political instability of the transition period has impaired the capacity to build a coherent strategy for the sector and 
has led, in the face of social demands, to a management in crisis mode. The sector would need to reflect on how to best involve the private 
sector and on the implications of this move in terms of institutional and regulatory needs, as well as in terms of administrative culture. Such 
solutions and an effective engagement of communities and in the design and operation of rural water supply services to meet the pressing 
needs of a growing population (private household connections), coupled with a revision of the current water pricing policy (including subsidies) 
to increase the financial sustainability of utilities and pro-poor benefits are key priorities. Development partners including WBG are engaged 
with the government to identify sustainable means of supporting the water sector including through PPPs for sanitation and rural water supply, 
although some of the related institutional reforms may take time.
Energy and Natural resources Management: The January 2014 Constitution ensures that the state “strives for proper management of 
natural resources” (Article 12), that “natural resources belong to the Tunisian people” (Article 13), and that natural resource contracts need 
to be ratified by the NCA, the constituent assembly (Article 13). Article 136 also allows for the possibility of allocating a percentage of natural 
resources to advancing regional development and regional management of resources. This is a significant step forward for Tunisia, where the 
initial protests, leading to the 2011 unrest, were linked to poor governance in the phosphate industry, national parks, and forest areas. A year-
and-a-half after the fall of the Ben Ali regime, Prime Minister Hamadi Jebali announced his government’s commitment to joining the Extractive 
Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), though this has yet to happen. This is an important part of the transparency agenda that will involve 
regulatory bodies, auditors, relevant administrations and SOEs, CSOs and Parliamentarians.
Telecommunications: The Bank has identified the telecommunication sector as being particularly crucial for growth in the Tunisian context 
and has imbedded a reform program in its Governance, Opportunity, and Jobs DPL series. The objective of the reforms is to substantially 
increase competition, and encourage market entry, similarly to the experiences in the EU and Turkey. To strengthen competition in international 
communications, the National Telecommunication Authority (Instance Nationale des Télécommunications, INT) issued a first decision to 
open up access to the landing stations of international telecommunications cables (controlled by SOE Tunisie Telecom) to other operators 
in September 2012 and the requirement to route all their data communications through Agence Tunisienne de l’Internet (ATI) was removed 
from the Tunisian operator’s licenses. The opening of the landing stations of the state-owned operator represented an important decision in 
the overall telecommunications regulatory framework, as it creates the conditions for an increased competition and reduction in the price 
of international communications. In parallel, the Government has also been working to increase competition in the market for backbone 
connectivity. The substantial fiber optic infrastructure owned by various SOEs (notably the electricity utility STEG, the railway corporation 
SNCFT, and the highway operator Tunisie Autoroutes) mainly served their own corporate needs, with large unused capacity. To enable the use 
of such alternative backbone infrastructure, the Telecommunications Code (Code des Télécommunications) was revised by Law No 2013–10 
dated April 12, 2013 and the INT has subsequently approved and published technical and price offers by the two main holders of alternative 
fiber optic backbone infrastructure (STEG and SNCFT) to lease capacity to licensed operators on a non-discriminatory basis (prior action 
GOJ-2). The package of measures currently considered expands the reform process in the sector by (i) tackling the issue of the restructuring 
of the state-owned historical operator, Tunisie Telecom, which cannot any longer be isolated from regulatory reforms; and (ii) broadening 
the liberalization process through service based competition for internet service and voice services (Internet Service Providers and Virtual 
Network Operators), coupled with improved access to fixed backbone/backhaul/local loop infrastructure for data transmission and the internet 
(unbundling and bitstream wholesale offer by Tunisie Telecom).
Financial Sector: The Tunisian financial sector is in need of structural reforms in order to facilitate the country’s economic modernization. The 
banking sector suffers from a high degree of fragmentation and under-capitalization. Political interference and weak governance has severely 
undermined its performance and led to a high number of non-performing loans. To address these problems, the Central Bank has announced 
reform measures including stricter prudential regulations for micro-finance to large state-owned banks.
Transport: (a) Governance of SOE and sustainability: The Tunisian transport sector is characterized by the involvement of several state-
owned companies (SOE) that are currently in weak financial situation, characterized by a high level of borrowing and poor operational 
performance. Often these companies are not even able to maintain their fleet and honor their financial commitments. This is the case of 
most transportation companies, including TRANSTU (urban transport), SNCFT (railways), STAM (port operator), and TunisAir (airline). Existing 
transportation institutions, such as the Ministry of Equipment, need to significantly improve their planning capacity to better respond to the 
economy’s needs with limited resources. Investment may be necessary to improve delivery of services and increase the financial sustainability 
due to lack of maintenance of assets.
(b) Decentralization/Deconcentration of responsibilities: Responsibilities for delivery of services and planning remains very centralized. In the 
road sector, despite the creation of regional administrations, the decision making, financial and human resources remain very central. At the 
city level, (although the 2004 Transport Law provided for the establishment of urban transport management authorities within governorates, 
the funding of transport services by users and other beneficiaries, and the compensation of public service obligations by the State budget) 
the lack of decentralization, strong resistances of several ministries under previous governments to transfer responsibilities, and MOF’s past 
reluctance to revise the tax system of car usage have stalled implementation.
Role for the private sector: As delivery of services has traditionally been provided by SOE, the private sector role in the transport sector is 
sub-optimal. While perception of the private sector during the Ben Ali area, and recent pressure on SOE to increase employment following 
the revolution, there is a need to rethink the role of the private sector. Even when SOE will remain in place a competitive environment

and appropriate governance structure should be encouraged to improve the quality, efficiency and sustainability of transport services and 
infrastructure.
Health Sector. Governance challenges in the health sector undermine equal access to services and their quality. In particular, roles and 
responsibilities are not well delineated, which has led to overlapping functions, conflicts of interest and inefficiencies in the four functions 
of the health system (provision of health care services, resource generation, financing, and stewardship). For example, the MoH, the main 
health care provider, is also responsible for managing the resources allocated to non-contributory health coverage for the poor and vulnerable 
population. Ill-equipped for this function, it manages these resources inadequately, allocating them to public facilities without taking into 
account their activity. Second, although the MoH is supposed to ensure the stewardship of the system, its limited capacities are mainly 
allocated to service provision and financing functions, which do not allow for an effective regulation and control of the private providers. This 
results in important inequities in access to health services and their quality.
Education Sector. The Tunisian education system is characterized by high levels of centralization for all sub-sectors (general, vocational, and 
higher education) and subject to the overall burden of heavy prior controls and other bureaucratic processes with no real check and balance 
mechanisms in place. As a result, education institutions at all levels have little room to manage their inputs and adjust to the needs of the 
students and their families; and there are no incentives for performance or innovation. Another effect is the near absence of involvement or 
even representation of key stakeholders (parents, students, employers, civil society) in the governing bodies and decision-making processes 
of educational institutions. This could explain the disconnect between education outcomes and labor market needs as employers have little 
say in the determination of priority areas and the design of vocational training and higher education programs. Teacher policies have been 
characterized by a succession of inconsistent and ineffective reforms of pre-service teacher training; lack of accountability mechanism; highly 
centralized recruitment systems and related risks of corruption and cronyism; and inefficient distribution of resources disadvantaging the 
interior/lagging regions. Private sector contribution is still very limited (four percent of total students in general education and 6.5 percent in 
higher education). Private providers are subject to tight regulations and relatively severe criteria for investment and operation

Implementing governance reforms and improving delivery of public sector services is dependent on 
the performance of a public sector long characterized by inefficiency. While the skills of civil servants 

have traditionally been relatively high in Tunisia, corruption, nepotism, and the lack of performance moni-
toring and evaluation have undermined performance. Hiring and promotion in the civil service has not 
normally been based on merit. Much of the focus of the civil service was on serving the elite, the party, or 
themselves as opposed to serving the public. GoT plans to incorporate citizen engagement in evaluating 
performance of the civil servants and delivery of services, and implementation of a civil servant code of 
conduct, may have positive impacts. But changing the culture of the civil service is a longer term proposi-
tion. Tunisia’s civil service was relatively large and expensive prior to the transition. In the current political 
climate, with job creation a priority, it is unlikely the civil service will be downsized, but instead is likely 
to grow further.

quality of Education and Skills Mismatch

Tunisia rapidly expanded access to education over the past 20 years, particularly to higher education. 
However, the quality of education has become a challenge and acts as a constraint to growth. From 

1990 to 2010, Tunisia rapidly expanded access to education, particularly to higher levels of education (see 

106 The World Bank defines social capital as, “the institutions, relationships, and norms that shape the quality and quantity of a so-
ciety’s social interactions. Social cohesion is critical for societies to prosper economically and for development to be sustainable.”

Figure 60a and 60b). As a result, impressive progress has been made in enrollment and completion rates in 
both secondary and tertiary education. In particular, gross secondary enrollment rates increased from 52 per-
cent in the early 1990s to 89 percent in 2009, and gross tertiary enrollment rates increased from eight percent 
in the early 1990s to 34 percent in 2009. These increases have made possible a sharp reduction in gender gaps 
in education and for some education outcomes—such as access to tertiary education—a gender-reversed gap 
is observed. However, challenges remain in ensuring the quality of education in Tunisia. Evidence on learn-
ing outcomes—as measured by Trends in International Mathematics and Science Studies (TIMSS) among 
8th graders and by the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) among 15 year olds—points to 
a relatively low quality of education (see Figure 60, bottom pane). The 2011 TIMSS indicates that 75 per-
cent of 8th graders in Tunisia displayed “low” and “below low” performance in mathematics, suggesting that 
secondary school students may not have even basic mathematical knowledge. Similarly, data from the 2012 
PISA suggests that Tunisian pupils’ performance in sciences and mathematics is low (given the country’s level 
of development). While these data look only at performance in secondary education, nevertheless they signal 
that the education system is not producing a critical mass of students who have the fundamental quantitative 
skills to perform well in labor markets.

A serious skills mismatch, together with low quality of educational outcomes, prevents a full utilization 
of the human capital. Lack of adequate skills is the second leading constraint for firms in the private 

sector. The skills and competencies acquired by graduates do not seem aligned with those in demand by the 
private sector. In addition to the quality of education, the relevance of graduates’ skills is crucial for employ-
ability. Ideally, the skills and competencies available among job seekers and those required by available jobs 
in the labor markets should match in order to make graduates employable. About 63 percent of all students 
enrolled in tertiary education institutions in the academic year 2010/11 were in the fields of humanities and 
social sciences. Such skills, however, are not very attractive in private sectors where employment demand for 
graduates is highest, such as health, ICT, agro/industrial, financial services and telecommunications. Other 
factors affecting negatively the quality and relevance of higher education outcomes include the difficult tran-
sition to the newly implemented Bologna LMD model, the limited autonomy of universities and lack of 
employers’ involvement in university programs design. This is reflected in the findings of the most recent ICA 
(2012) where the level of workers’ skills and education are the second leading perceived constraint to firm 
operations, immediately after political uncertainty (see Figure 61). Thirty nine percent of sampled firms in 
the recent ICA (2012) perceive the available skills of the workforce as a weakness. Many firms have responded 
that candidates do not meet their required qualification expectations. For instance, 70 percent of respondents 
stated that the types of engineers and/or professionals available on the job market do not possess adequate 
skills required for the position.

health Services 

While health facilities are relatively well distributed, the main challenges facing the system emanate from a lack 
of adequate financial protection and a poor delivery of public health services, particularly in interior regions. 
Between 2000 and 2013, total health expenditure grew from 5.5 percent to 7.1 percent of GDP, which looks 
adequate for an upper middle income country. However household out-of-pocket (OOP) expenditure are 
persistently high. Health care in Tunisia is financed through a combination of general government revenues 
(27.1 percent of total health spending), social health insurance (Caisse Nationale de l’Assurance Medicale 
or CNAM, which account for 34.9 percent of total health expenditure), private insurance (0.4 percent) and 
household OOP payments (37.5 percent). CNAM covers nearly 66 percent of the Tunisian population but 
services are not adequate, driving many patients to OOP payments on private providers that are not covered

by CNAM’s schemes. As of 2011, CNAM expenditures amounted to 1.5 million TND, or 2 percent of GDP, 
increasing at an average annual rate of growth of 19 percent during 2007–2011 and facing a deficit that equals 
nearly 0.5 percent of GDP as of 2013. Tunisia also provides around one third of the population with non-
contributory health coverage. However, the targeting system is relatively weak and services that are effectively 
covered are limited and of poor quality. As a consequence, out-of-pocket payments on health and personal 
care accounted for an average of 10 percent of total household expenditures as of 2010 and approximately 12 

66

percent of households faced catastrophic health care payments, threatening poverty and shared prosperity. In 
addition, the health financing system challenges exacerbate disparities in health status and the use of health 
services, including among regions. For example, the maternal mortality ratio is over three times higher in rural 
areas such as Kasserine than in urban areas such as Sousse (70 deaths compared to 20 deaths per 100,000 live 
births, respectively, as of 2006).

infrastructure, Connectivity, and Trade logistics

Connectivity is central to improving competitiveness. Despite its high urbanization rate, Tunisia is charac-
terized by a low agglomeration rate (39 percent) due to relatively low densities. Low agglomeration combines 
with gaps in infrastructure (e.g. one of greatest rural connectivity deficits in MENA) and service delivery to 
limit the shared benefits of growth. Recent evidence (Bridging the Spatial Divide)107 suggests that limited 
labor mobility and spatial segmentation in labor markets may be driven by potential migrants’ perceptions of 
higher costs associated with commuting and poorer access to services in the peri-urban neighborhoods they 
would inhabit if they move to major urban areas. Given that almost all movement of people and freight be-
tween cities is on road, the development of road transport corridors is likely to have a significant contribution 
to improving connectivity of lagging regions.108 Growth in lagging regions will also depend on the quality 
of infrastructure to support private sector investment and reducing transportation costs of goods to ports/
markets. At the same time, private sector participation in road rehabilitation and modernization can help the 
Tunisian economy enhancing its production potential, hence benefitting growth in all regions. 

Important bottlenecks in infrastructure-related services and logistics hinder trade and competitiveness. 

According to the WEF’s Competitiveness Index, Tunisia ranks 79 out of 144 countries in terms of infrastruc-
ture provision. Significant previous public investments have in fact resulted in good provision relative to other 
peer countries. Tunisia has also traditionally been perceived as an example of good practices in logistics in the 
MENA region. According to the Logistic Performance Index 2012, Tunisia was ranked 41st in the world and 
the best performer within the MENA region with a score of 3.17 over five (after United Arab Emirates and 
Saudi Arabia) when the Arab Republic of Egypt scored at 2.98, Morocco at 3.03, and Algeria at 2.41. How-
ever, logistics costs related to infrastructure-related services (such as transit costs for containers or shipping 

Box 13:  An example of collective governance failures and delays in infrastructure investments:  
the example of Rades port

Radesa port has been symptomatic of governance failures and bad incentives present in the country: (i) poor management of the main SOEs 
in this area (the port concessionaire, STAM and the OMMP, the company in charge of ports infrastructure and management), which led to 
overstaffing and poor performance ratio (for cranes for instance) but also very limited availability of equipment and inadequate maintenance; 
(ii) governance problems in customs, such as inadequate auction policy and habits for some brokers to collude with some customs officials, 
ineffective 100 percent scanning policy leading to increased corruption, and numerous loopholes in several customs; (iii) complicated tariff 
policy with numerous tariff peaks, which has been an incentive for collusion and corruption leading to long dwell times; and (iv) incentives to 
use the port as storage area with very low levels of storage tariff (lower by a factor of three to comparable ports in the region). Moreover, the 
port has suffered from procrastination and delays in infrastructure investments (such as years long delay of the port extension and dredging 
the channel to a depth of 11m to accommodate the most common feeder vessels),
Given the projected traffic in the coming years, improving Rades port productivity and achieve port expansion should lead to annual savings of 
up to US$300 million for the Tunisian economy (or up to US$600 per container). This should be mainly achieved by improved crane productivity 
and reducing container dwell time by at least 30 percent. To improve Rades port performance, governance problems (in customs and SOEs) 
as well as infrastructure bottlenecks will need to be tackled simultaneously.

a Originally designed solely to carry wheeled cargo, the port of Rades has been adapted over the years to handle container traffic to become the main port in 
Tunisia with almost 90 percent of the national traffic in the 2000s.However, the port has increasingly faced increasing difficulties and penalized importers/
exporters with long container dwell times and increased maritime costs from shipping lines. During the transition period, Rades share in the Tunisian traffic 
decreased from 90 percent to only (approximately) 66 percent.

107 World Bank report, Bridging the Spatial divide: Labor Market Outcomes in Urban Tunisia, 2013, mimeo.
108 In Tunisia, the road network accounts for virtually all movement of persons and over 80 percent of goods transportation. Although 
the national average road density is 12 km per 100 km2 (WDI), it is significantly more developed in the denser eastern coastal 
regions than in lagging regions such as region in the northern and central west of Tunisia.

costs – see Box 13) in Tunisia are high, about 20 percent of GDP against an average of 15 percent in emerging 
countries and 7–10 percent in European countries. 

State-owned companies still dominate Tunisian economy at the expense of effective public spending. Misman-

agement of SOEs has been recurrent for years. Some evidence has been documented by the National Commission 
for the Investigation of Cases of Corruption and Embezzlement in 2011, such as access to state-owned land at 
prices completely out of step with market prices, abuse of state assets for private purposes, and state banks being 
used for special access to credit under advantageous terms. SOEs have been used to generate employment, especially 
after the revolution since their total employment increased by more than 50 percent in less than three years.

The heavy involvement of the state in the form of SOEs, with opaque rules for governance and account-
ability, has prevented infrastructure-related services from operating efficiently and fairly. In the infrastruc-

ture sector there are an estimated 32 SOEs. In comparison in EU countries there are on average nine SOEs in 
infrastructure/network industries (OECD PMR database). The state is active especially in the field of public 
services (electricity, water, sanitation, passenger transport). Market segments of transport services that may be 
supplied by private operators are still serviced by dominant SOEs with market shares larger than 50 percent (see 
governance sector specific issues). Although there is no single model for managing and controlling state-owned 
enterprises, neither Tunisia’s legislative framework nor the implementation of existing framework provides the 
transparency and accountability needed for efficient use and management of public funds. Reforms that mimic 
private sector practices on paper are not implemented or cannot be implemented because of political interfer-
ence and opacity remains a critical issue in Tunisia’s SOE sector. As long as political interference exists in SOE 
management or public procurement, reforms will not have a strong impact on the ground. PPP could improve 
the efficiency of public expenditure and the quality of infrastructure services but at present, an institutional and 
legal environment conducive to the facilitation of a clear strategy for PPP in infrastructure is still missing. 

Tunisia’s growth requires an energy sector capable to supply continuous, stable power. While the sec-
tor thus far has been reasonably able to respond to the demands, significant underfunding over the 

past decade has curtailed the sector. Tunisia’s recovery is driving strong growth in electricity demand (five 
percent per year on average for annual electricity consumption, 11 percent for peak demand). However little 
new power generating capacity was commissioned between 2010 and 2014, and risks of shortages are now 
looming. This strong growth in electricity demand is translating into additional reliance on imports and on 
hydrocarbons. The Tunisian energy system is extremely dependent on hydrocarbons, with oil and gas meet-
ing 99 percent of energy demand (44 percent for oil, 55 percent for natural gas). Power generation is almost 
entirely based on natural gas (98 percent), with renewable energy having only a very small contribution. The 
high level of dependency on hydrocarbons makes the country vulnerable to disruptions in the international 
oil and gas markets and to price volatility, especially as Tunisia has to rely increasingly on imports. One third 
of Tunisia’s gas consumption is currently imported from Algeria. By 2020 it is expected that gas supplies will 
fall short of Tunisia’s needs. In this context Tunisia’s authorities have been contemplating the use of alterna-
tives to gas including a transmission interconnection to Italy for import of electricity and a coal-fired power 
plant in the medium-term. For the longer term solar and nuclear power are being considered. 

The state-owned Tunisian Company for Electricity and Gas (STEG), which owns and operates 88 percent 
of the generation capacity and acts as single buyer for the remaining 12 percent, is in need of reform.109 

109 In order to secure sustainable, efficient and cheap financing for investments and reduce losses (technical and commercial) to 
improve financial viability, STEG should be reformed on the basis of two principles: (i) legislative security through a stable and 
predictable institutional and regulatory framework, and (ii) transparency in operations, tendering, and pricing.

This is reflected in the fact that over the past one to two years power outages have increased, and in 2013 
Tunisia had to resort to leasing expensive rental power plants to respond to its growing peak demand. Unless 
concrete measures to address these structural problems are taken, the energy sector—the engine that drives Tu-
nisia’s economy—will face serious challenges over the next few years. This will also require addressing Tunisia’s 
increasing dependency and its impact on BoP risks. Actions to reduce the carbon intensity of the economy (in 
both energy supply through renewables and efficiency, as well as in energy intense sectors such as transport and 
industry mainly through efficiency measures) are part and parcel of the strategy going forward, as is continued 
attention to energy subsidy reduction.

Delay in connecting new firms to the electricity grid is perceived as a leading constraint to setting up 
new businesses in Tunisia, therefore hindering their efficiency and competitiveness. Major differences 
exist in the provision of the service between regions. “Delays in connecting new firms to electricity”110 is 

ranked as the fifth leading constraint to businesses in Tunisia, with one third of firms citing it as a major or 
very severe constraint. According to the most recent ICA, firm perception of such constraints varies by loca-
tion within Tunisia (ICA). New connecti ons are reported to take an average of 59 days, which is one of the 
highest in the region. Waiting for two months means that despite the relatively easy business registration pro-
cess in Tunisia, setting up new firms is a time consuming process. Long delays in the delivery of services also 
potentially create more space for discretion. According to the Investment Climate survey, 17 percent of the 
firms are expected to make informal payments in order to obtain an electricity connection, a relatively high 
figure when compared to other MENA countries. The level of petty corruption in Tunisia is highest in small 
(24 percent) and medium (21 percent) vs. large firms (five percent).

shares) are the electricity generators, but STEG has the monopoly over the distribution and supply of electricity. In the gas sector, 
production is ensured by five companies (British Gas; ENI; PETROFAC; PERENCO; and Winstar), while imports are performed 
by one SOE (ETAP). The SOEs Société du Réseau Ferrovière Rapide de Tunis (SRFRT), Société des Travaux Ferrovières (STF) et Société 
Nationale des Chemins de Fer Tunisiens (SNCFT) are the most important enterprises in the railways sector.

Tunisia’s transition governments have taken sig-
nificant steps toward the overhaul of its energy 

sector. In 2013/2014, Tunisia launched a national 
debate on the energy transition. The key elements of 
the energy strategy are: (i) development of national 
energy resources and infrastructure; (ii) reinforce-
ment of energy efficiency programs (objective is an 
annual decline of 2.5 percent in energy intensity); 
(iii) diversification of the energy mix through RE 
development (objective is a capacity of 3700 MW in 
2030, with 30 percent RE in electricity production); 
(iv) development/reinforcement of interconnections 
with Maghreb countries and Europe; and (v) reor-
ganization and institutional reforms together with 
better governance of energy strategy and decisions, 
and launch of national energy debate on transition.

sectors. Tunisia’s economic and social development 
has been underpinned by a tradition of successful 
water and wastewater infrastructure (highest level of 
wastewater equipment in MENA) and service provi-
sion. However significant infrastructure and service-
related gaps remain, with several underserved areas 
accounting for as many as 300,000 people lacking 
improved sources of drinking water, and one mil-
lion people without access to an improved sanita-
tion facility, primarily in rural areas (Box 2). These 
gaps have increased following the slowdown in the 
past decade in Tunisia’s high investment in technol-
ogy and water mobilization infrastructure. Sustain-
able water availability in Tunisia is only 440 m3 per 
capita per year (from 470 m3 per capita in 2005), 
less than 50 percent of MENA’s average, and below 
the universal scarcity threshold (500 m3 per capita). 
It is projected to decrease to 360 m3 in 2030 when 
the population reaches 13 million, with severe water stress occurring by the 2050s under a warming and dry-
ing climate. If infrastructure is not upgraded, 7.5 million people stand at risk of water shortages (several cities 
experienced service interruptions on a large scale in the summer of 2012 which led to civil unrest). Degrading 
infrastructure and services ultimately impact the well-being of people and could affect the growth of water-
intensive economic sectors (such as the agribusiness).

use Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) as a key accelerator of social and economic 

development. International fiber optic communications (international bandwidth), both for phone and In-
ternet, has been until September 2014 under the monopoly of Tunisie Telecom.111 The substantial fiber optic 
infrastructure owned by various SOEs (including the railway corporation SNCFT, and the highway operator 
Tunisie Autoroutes) mainly served their own corporate needs, with large unused capacity. As a consequence, 
the cost of telecommunication and internet services in Tunisia is incredibly high, and compares only with 
some of the least integrated economies in the world (like Myanmar or Republic of the Congo). This has hin-
dered Tunisia’s potential to become an internationally competitive player in the global market and has limited 
the ability of the private sector to develop information technologies at their full potential. Even with much 
lower per capita income than Tunisia, Morocco and Egypt are better positioned to become regional hubs in 
the sector, with three and seven operators respectively. These numbers are still much lower when compared to 
more integrated countries such as in Eastern Europe (10 providers per country on average).

111 This is a monopoly on the physical layer of the international network, but alternative licensed operators have the right to have an 
international gateway and to offer international services to their own clients only. As of September 2014, additional international 
infrastructure (sub-marine cables) has been established by alternative operators, which will ultimately provide Tunisia with a more 
secure and competitive access to the global fiber optic network.

Added Value ICT/GDP (%) 

Tunisia’s Information and Communication Technology (ICT)
a is an important and growing sector: its contribution to GDP 
increased steadily from two percent in 2002 to 7.6 percent in 
2012 (equivalent to tourism), providing jobs to 50,000 people 
(1.3 percent of Tunisia’s active population).b ICT is a sector that 
attracts significant investment and can provide income even in 
a phase of depressed economic growth. Average income for ICT 
jobs, be they in the information technologies sub-sector or in the 
telecommunication technologies sub-sector, is higher than those 
in agriculture, industry, and services. While the development of 
the telecommunication technologies sub-sector has been driven 
by a limited number of players (three telecoms operators and two 
independent Internet Service Providers as of 2014), the number 
of companies in the information technologies sub-sector was 
multiplied by five from 1,307 in 2002 (for revenues of TND107 
million) to 5,275 in 2011 (for revenues of TND800 million). Tunisia 
completed in June 2014 the consultative process to adopt its new 
ICT strategy called “Digital Tunisia 2018” which aims at transforming 
the country into an international digital best practice and to use ICT 
as a key accelerator of social and economic development. Tunisia 
also laid the appropriate foundations for e-government through 
its 2010–2014 strategyc and joined the Open Gov Partnership in 
January 2014 that will contribute to the unleashing of Big Data 
opportunities. The website www.data.gov.tn displays approximately 
one hundred links to public databases structured around 17 themes. 
The website www.opengov.tn is a civil society initiative offering 
access to governmental data. The impacts could be far reaching, 
including in terms of job creation and more transparent governance 
and real-time impact analysis and feedback.
ICT, by including an objective to move toward broadbandd for all 
(e.g. 50 percent of the Tunisian population should have access to 
mobile broadband by 2018), represents a leapfrog opportunity 
for Tunisia for poverty reduction and income growth of the 
bottom 40 percent of the population. Broadband is a powerful 
driver for sustainable economic growth, job creation, and human 
skills development and an enabler of democracy and social 
transformation. 
Broadband 
is a general-purpose technology 
(GPT) with 
pervasive productivity impacts on multiple sectors of the 
economy 
(energy, water, 
industrial production, services, 
transport, and so on). Broadband has a similar impact on the 
transformation of the economy as previous GPTs have had in the past, including the printing press, steam engines, and electricity. 
Broadband drives competitiveness in manufacturing through information technology-enabled supply chains: broadband powers the most 
relevant innovations in the production processes likely to shape the future of manufacturing (e.g., digital modeling, simulation and 
visualization, big data analytics, social and collaborative technologies, and just-in-time supply). Furthermore, broadband enables business 
process outsourcing (BPO). Broadband also contributes to the competitiveness of the services sector, bringing positive spillover effects 
to less technology-intensive industries. Finally, the availability of reliable and reasonably priced broadband internet access is a key 
determinant in foreign direct investment (FDI) decisions.

Broadband is also a key enabler of democracy and social 
transformation, as witnessed by the powerful role that was 
played by new and social media networking during the Arab 
Spring. The internet has played a key role in advancing social 
inclusion, accountability, human rights, and civic engagement. 
Social networking tools have the potential to enhance citizen 
engagement in the region, promote social inclusion, and create 
opportunities for employment, entrepreneurial activities, and 
social development.
However, broadband is currently available only in the richest 
part of Tunisia and the current level of broadband prices is not 
low enough to be truly inclusive. There is an ongoing risk that the 
bottom 40 percent of population in Tunisia will remain excluded 
from the information revolution that is shaping the modern world. A 
representative household in the lowest 40 percent income bracket 
of Tunisia would need to spend about 41 percent of its disposable 
income to afford fixed broadband services and about 44 percent to 
afford mobile services.

Sustainability

Whether Tunisia can sustain the progress observed in years before the revolution while moving on the path of 
higher and more inclusive growth depends on the extent to which attention is paid to critical socio-political, 
economic, and environmental issues. On all these fronts, emerging issues are overlapping with ongoing struc-
tural weaknesses and, together, could threaten the effectiveness and impact of identified reforms. There are 
however also new and unique opportunities to move forward and to strengthen the link between specific poli-
cies and a long-term development vision.

political and Social Stability

Tunisia has suffered from increased instability following the revolution. Apart from the generalized 

spread of violence in everyday life (increase in burglaries, petty crimes, and assaults), there has been an 
upsurge in violence that is explicitly socially, politically and religiously motivated. The unrest intensified 
during 2013 with the assassination of two prominent opposition politicians. Although slightly improved in 
2014 with installment of the technocratic government and the agreement of the new constitution and ulti-
mately with the peaceful conclusions of the elections at end 2014, the situation has suddenly deteriorated. 
The brutal terrorist attack in March 2015 in the Bardo area is yet another blow at an already fragile security 
situation. Issues of reforming the police and security services will be extremely complex and delicate, and 
the former have occasionally gone on strike to protest efforts to sanction their members. This uncertain 
security, political, and policy environment significantly affected investor confidence in Tunisia since the 
revolution, affecting both domestic and foreign investments. Continued uncertainty on these fronts will 
undoubtedly affect the sustainability of Tunisia attracting necessary private investment into the country 
over the coming years.

The volatile regional environment and the difficult security situation, coupled with an economy that 
is still struggling to take off, might contribute to weaken the initial support of the Tunisia population 

for democracy. A very recent poll from the Pew Center112 highlights how today only about half of Tunisians 
(48 percent) believe that democracy is preferable to any other kind of government, against a vast majority 
(63 percent) in 2012, soon after the revolution. About a quarter of the respondents replied that in some cir-
cumstances a non-democratic form of government is preferable (26 percent) or that the type of government 

112 The latest survey in Tunisia by the Pew Research Center is based on face-to-face interviews conducted with 1,000 respondents from 
April 19 to May 9, 2014. The poll results were released on October 15, 2014.

does not matter (24 percent).113 According to the poll, a great part of the public’s discontent is explained by 
the economy. Fully 88 percent describe the country’s economic situation as bad, and 56 percent say it is very 
bad. But a majority is optimistic that the economy will turn around soon—56 percent expect it to improve in 
the next year. Instability also plays an important role: when asked which is more important, having a demo-
cratic government with some risk of political instability, or a stable government with a risk it will not be fully 
democratic, 62 percent of Tunisians say they prefer stability. This has increased dramatically since 2012 when 
just 38 percent said they would prefer stability to democracy. The toned down enthusiasm and engagement 
is reflected in the voter turnout for the most recent—October 26, 2014—parliamentary elections, where 
participation was estimated at 62 percent of the 5.3 million registered voters. Contrary to some international 
media, which characterized participation as a success, the local feeling is that it is a disappointing turnout, as 
the absolute number of voters is below that of 2011. Reports suggest very weak political participation among 
youth, especially in the inland/lagging regions.

Despite waning confidence in democracy’s ability to produce results, Tunisians continue to want key 
features of a democratic system, such as a fair judiciary, competitive elections, the right to protest, and 

equal rights for men and women. A strong majority—more than nine-in-ten—believe that having a judicial 
system that treats everyone in the same way (94 percent) is very important for the country’s future, up 13 points 
since last year. Similarly, 92 percent of Tunisians say having honest, regularly held elections in which people 
have a choice of at least two parties is very important, an increase of 21 percentage points in just a year. Law 
and order is a priority for most Tunisians: 81 percent believe that stability is crucial for Tunisia’s future. More 

113 Findings in Tunisia closely reflect those in Colombia and Thailand, the former in partial transition from conflict and the latter in a 
state of chronic political upheaval. Attitudes in transition countries often reflect the dichotomy of the public’s interest in balancing 
stability with rights and freedoms. In periods of political turmoil citizens may be more willing to trade enhanced rights for greater 
stability. However, without public engagement and pressure difficult reforms are less likely to be addressed effectively. Implementa-
tion of reforms will be heavily dependent on a civil service, which in the past has lacked efficiency and effectiveness.

than six-in-ten think that certain freedoms are criti-
cal to Tunisia’s future: freedom to peacefully protest 
(68 percent), equal rights for women (66 percent), 
freedom to criticize the government (64 percent), 
and an uncensored media (63 percent).

A crucial step will be for the citizens to regain trust 
in the public administration and enhance trans-
parency. Achieving greater citizen accountability 
of authorities and greater citizen participation and 
feedback in policy making114 will require greater 
transparency in government operations and higher 
standards for public officials. The important actions 
taken so far to address anti-corruption issues are a 
step in the right direction.115 Another important 
step toward creating a more efficient administra-
tion that is closer to the citizens is the ambitious 
decentralization reform of the public administration 
foreseen in the new constitution. The development 
of a regional administrative level, capable of taking 
into account regional differences and of promoting 
a more equitable economic development across the country, was identified as a priority in the constitutional 
reform process as well as the empowerment and increased autonomy of municipalities. The recognition of the 
importance local administration represents a radical break with past policies, in which the administration was 
largely centralized. A well-functioning democratic system also needs an independent judiciary system capable 
to enforce human and civil rights. While progress has been made116 to ensure that the independence of the 
judiciary system is respected during transition and after the new system is in place, particular attention needs 
to be given to implementation of institutional reforms.

114 Citizen involvement in policymaking and active participation in the civil society cannot be assumed as an automatic outcome 
once the opportunity is granted. An assessment of the degree of citizens’ participation and its impact would need to include both 
quantitative (e.g., amount and/or percentage of population that participate) and also qualitative indicators (i.e., usefulness and/or 
relevance of contributions to the process in question).
115 In 2011, a Minister in the Prime Minister’s Office responsible for Governance and Anti-corruption was appointed and the Na-
tional Anti-corruption Unit was created. Good governance units have been established in all ministries, public enterprises and 
regions, and a national anti-corruption strategy was launched on in December 2012. However, there are still many gaps in leg-
islation, institutions and procedures. Of particular note are gaps in the legislative framework regarding: (1) the asset declaration 
system; (2) the dissemination of laws embodying values and standards for public sector integrity; (3) the lack of participation in 
the formulation of legislation; and (4) limited controls over the finances of political parties and associations. The existing rules and 
regulations are also not implemented systematically or in a transparent way.
116 The revolution left a legal vacuum in which the post-revolutionary judiciary has yet to ensure its independence. The pre-revo-
lutionary judiciary was seen as compromised and lacking independence from the executive branch. After the revolution, judges 
were dismissed and new once were nominated. This process has been criticized for not being transparent and for being driven by 
political motivations. In April 2013 the NCA approved a new law to establish an independent commission to oversee the judiciary. 

78

A whole new approach to transparency, media and civil society will facilitate sustainability of reforms by 

facilitating citizen engagement. The post-revolutionary period has seen an unprecedented expansion of free 
expression. Under the new Freedom of Association Law passed in 2011, associations can now easily assemble 
and no longer need accreditation by the Ministry of the Interior. This has led to a mushrooming of new as-
sociations, from social movements and community organizations to unions and professional associations. 
From january 2011 to December 2012, 4,997 associations were created for a total of approximately 15,000 
associations, around 3.5 percent of which focus on rights and civil engagement.

At present, the Tunisian media provides for a plurality of opinions. Under the new press law and the law 

on audiovisual communications enacted in 2011, publishing newspapers has become easier and direct state 
censorship has ended. In addition, the end of systematic filtering has now allowed the internet to become a 
major and effective communication and information tool. As a result, the use of the internet has expanded 
drastically, with a 33 percent increase in “.tn” websites only a few months following the revolution. Although 
civil society and journalists can now operate generally free from state intrusion, radical groups have limited 
their activities. Ensuring freedom of speech and of criticisms of the government without fear of retaliation is 
an important requisite for a functioning and sustainable democratic system.

Macro and Fiscal Sustainability

While Tunisia has remained vulnerable to shocks, lower growth and greater external unbalances threaten 

macroeconomic and fiscal sustainability. For the three years since the revolution, Tunisia has been running 
down its policy buffers. The macroeconomic space for expansionary policies has now vanished. While public 
and external debt remained at an acceptable level compared to international standards, they are expected to 
reach unsustainable level if reforms are not implemented.

fiscal Sustainability

Expansionary fiscal policy since the revolution resulted in growing fiscal deficit and public debt. The 

fiscal deficit increased from one percent of GDP to 6.2 percent between 2010 and 2013 and the public debt 
from 40.7 percent of GDP to 44.8 percent during the same period. While this increase was an acceptable 
range, public debt is expected to reach 56 percent of GDP by 2017 before slowly declining over the medium 
term, according to the baseline scenario of the recent IMF’s debt sustainability analysis. This baseline scenario 
assumes the fiscal consolidation and growth pick up in 2015, however if fiscal consolidation reforms are not 
implemented, it would result in growing public debt that could reach around 62 percent of GDP by 2019, 
while a permanent negative growth shock would increase public debt to about 67 percent of GDP by 2019. 

In late 2013, the Tunisian National Constituent Assembly enacted a law on transitional justice that most notably called for the 
establishment of a truth council, the establishment of a damage and compensation scheme for dealing with reparation requests, 
and the establishment of new specialized courts. Based on the currently limited information available, implementing the new law 
and operationalizing the Ministry may prove to be problematic. For instance, there is a lack of clarity as to jurisdiction between the 
Ministry of justice and Ministry of Transitional justice. It is not clear how these issues will be resolved or if efforts are underway to 
address them. In addition, and because reparation currently appears to be at the forefront of transitional justice in Tunisia, finan-
cial implications on the government must be addressed and proper mechanisms must be in place before effective implementation 
becomes possible. Thus far, institutional reform, prosecution of abuses and prevention of future abuses have taken a back seat to 
reparation indicating a possible lack of focus and prioritization in terms of improvement of justice delivery and prevention of 
future crimes.

Public debt dynamics are vulnerable to a slower ad-
justment path, lower growth, and a marked depreci-
ation of the exchange rates or a shock on contingent 
liabilities. 

In addition, since the revolution, the budget has 
remained centered on the growing current spend-
ing rather than investment. Notably the wage bill 

and subsidies continued to increase until 2013, de-
spite freezes on salaries and hiring of public servants 
and a gradual increase of subsidized fuel prices. In 
2013, the wage bill accounted for 12.5 percent of 
GDP (against 10.6 percent in 2010), and subsi-
dies and transfers represented 7.8 percent of GDP 
(against 3.6 percent in 2010). Only in 2014, was the 
expansionary policy put to a halt, leading the way to a 
medium-term fiscal consolidation, by slowing down 
the increase in current spending and progressively 
improving expenditure composition. In particular, 
spending on subsidies should decrease by 0.6 percent 
of GDP in 2014, thanks to the initial phase-out of 
energy subsidies. Measures have also been taken on 
the revenue side, including streamlining exemptions 
and widening the tax base. Assuming the intensifica-
tion of fiscal consolidation over the medium term, 
the deficit is expected to gradually decline from 
6.5 percent of GDP in 2014 to 3.2 percent in 2019. 
The fiscal consolidation will require continued ac-
tion on wage bill discipline in the public sector, fur-
ther phase-out of subsidies, SOE restructuring, and 
public sector pensions system. To mitigate the social 
costs of reforms, a better-targeted social safety net 
system and a new strategy for the financing of social 
security should be quickly put in place.

Macroeconomic Sustainability

Tunisia’s external position has gradually eroded in the face of expansionary policies favoring domestic 
consumption, delays in structural reforms to support exports, political uncertainly, and exogenous fac-

tors. The trade balance deficit widened from 10.4 percent of GDP in 2010 to over 13 percent in 2014. Tour-
ism receipts have been very volatile since the revolution, as the price competitiveness of Tunisian destinations 
has not offset concerns over the security situation until recently. Remittances have, on the other hand, quite 
steadily sustained the current account by about US$2.2 billion a year, but the overall imbalance has increased 
from 4.8 percent of GDP in 2010 to over eight percent by 2014. Foreign direct investment has been negatively 
impacted by political uncertainty and the delays in reforms. The Central Bank has used up significant reserves 
in 2011, with the latter dropping from about US$9.5 billion at the end of 2010 (or 4.4 months of GNFS

Box 15: Fiscal risks

Subsidies have become a growing fiscal burden. The Tunisian government controls one third of the CPI basket through subsidized and 
administered price. This limits the effectiveness of monetary policy, as it has no control over one third of the CPI basket. It also means that 
control of inflation is very costly to the state budget: while gradual subsidies reforms since the 1990s succeeded in reducing the subsidy 
spending to less than two percent of GDP until 2006, the trend was reversed due to the recent years’ international oil and food price increases, 
and worsened by the social discontent that contributed to increase the food subsidies in the aftermath of the revolution. As a result, the 
subsidy spending reached 7.2 percent of the GDP in 2013, approximately 24 percent of total spending. Fuel subsidies reached two-third of 
total subsidies budget in 2013, against less than a third in 2009, equivalent to almost 90 percent of the combined expenditures for health 
and basic education. In order to contain the fiscal impact of the rising energy subsidies, the in 2012 government initiated a subsidies reform 
by gradually increasing fuel prices, by increasing electricity tariffs, and by eliminating energy subsidies to cement companies and electricity 
subsidies to energy companies. 
Fiscal risks and contingent liabilities of SOEs are increasing. Budget expansion since 2011 has been driven by an increase in cross-subsidies 
and in the civil service wage bill. In addition, losses related to strikes in phosphate production and higher energy bills largely contributed to 
the worsening fiscal balance. In 2013, external debt from public enterprises guaranteed by the government represented 34 percent of the total 
external government debt (10 percent of GDP), from which the electricity company STEG accounted for 40 percent. Against this backdrop, 
the government is initiating a more transparent fiscal risk management system through improved monitoring of cross-subsidies, audits and 
consolidations of financial situations of the largest companies, and the governance framework of public enterprises.
The deficit of the public sector retirement and social security fund (CNRPS) has increased over the past few years. To ensure the payments 
of pensions, the government is expected to transfer around 0.3 percent of GDP to the CNRPS in 2014, of which 0.1 percent is a transfer to 
cover arrears from the transport public company. The deficit of CNRPS is expected to increase faster to reach 1.3 percent of GDP by 2020. The 
growing deficit reflects a fundamental misalignment between the contribution rate and benefits paid.

imports) to approximately US$7.3 billion toward the end of 2014 (or 3.1 months of GNFS imports), to sup-
port the currency first, before limiting interventions to manage an orderly depreciation. While the exchange 
rate depreciation should sustain exports and the decline in international energy prices provides temporary re-
lief, external imbalances will remain a source of vulnerability over the medium-term that can only be addressed 
by reforms favoring an adequate supply side response when foreign markets recover, especially in Europe. 

External debt has increased since the revolution, reflecting the fiscal expansion and the widening of the 

current account deficit. As for public debt, external debt had declined significantly in the 2000s to reach 
48 percent of GDP in 2011, but the twin deficits led to its increase to 54 percent of GDP at end 2013. 
External debt is projected to increase to 62.6 percent of GDP in 2016 before slightly declining to around 
61 percent by end-2019, according to the recent IMF’s DSA baseline scenario. This scenario assumes a strong 
fiscal consolidation and cautious external borrowing policies. The interest rate and maturity profile of Tunisia’s 
external debt make it relatively robust to shock, but are vulnerable to large exchange rate depreciation.

environmental Sustainability

Sharing prosperity with future generations requires addressing the sustainability of Tunisia’s develop-

ment model. Tunisia’s ecosystems support its economic development and provide income and jobs to most 
vulnerable population. For example, the coastal zone is home to over 65 percent of Tunisia’s population and 
to its major industries; it also supports its tourism sector, which relies in its mass on mass beach activity, 
and which contributes seven percent of GDP (2008) and provides employment opportunities for 380,000 
(10 percent of Tunisia’s active population). Tunisia’s water and soil ecosystems support its agricultural ac-
tivity that contributes eight percent of GDP and employs 16 percent of the national workforce. Tunisia’s 
development path is however depleting its natural resource stock. The adjusted net savings (ANS) measures 
the real difference between national income and consumption. It takes into consideration investment in hu-
man capital, depreciation of fixed capital, depletion of natural resources, and damage caused by pollution.

While Tunisia’s ANS rose from 2.6 percent of GDP 
in 1980 to 19 percent in 1999, it steadily declined 
over the past decade to reach –3.2 percent by 2012 
due to energy depletion, local pollution damage and 
mineral and forests depletion (WDI 2014).

Environmental degradation negatively impacts 

the Tunisian economy. The cost of environmental 
degradation in Tunisia was estimated at 522 million 
Tunisian dinars, or 2.1 percent of GDP for the refer-
ence year (see Figure 75) (World Bank 2004). The 
key factors behind this cost are related to (a) public 
health, in particular with respect to water-related 
diseases resulting from lack of sanitation in rural 
areas, respiratory diseases linked to air pollution, 
and inadequate waste disposal and treatment, and 
(b) productivity of natural resources, in particular 
the loss of agricultural productivity due to soil deg-
radation and the impact on property of inadequate waste disposal and treatment.

Tunisia made considerable steps in its environmental and natural resources management; however, im-

portant challenges remain. Since the 1980’s, Tunisia has put considerable effort toward ensuring environ-
mental protection and management, and has made important achievements in environmental conservation, 
energy use efficiency, and managing its water resources as a key component in the country’s economic and 
social policies, as well as building country capacity for environmental protection and management. However, 
important challenges remain: Tunisia’s already scarce water resources are threatened by over-abstraction and 
pollution; challenges pertaining to hazardous waste (including healthcare waste and PCBs); and reconciling 
the ecosystem conservation with socio-economic development of the local communities. Climate change is 
expected to exacerbate the pressure on Tunisia’s water and biodiversity resources. 

Scarce water resources are impinging on agriculture’s potential—a sector central to Tunisia’s sustainable 
growth, and continued poverty reduction objectives. Currently, both high value production and water ef-

ficiency in agriculture lag behind compared to neighboring countries. Frequent extreme events (drought and 
floods) translate into large inter-annual crop fluctuations (especially for cereal). This penalizes both internal 
supply and Tunisian exports, which in turn affect macroeconomic outcomes and poverty, and lead to further 
exploitation of natural resources. For instance, farmers in the North-West are trapped in a vicious circle of low 
agricultural productivity and lack of income opportunities, which leads to overexploitation of natural resources 
and limits opportunities for improving living conditions. In some cases, poverty is directly caused by land deg-
radation due to overexploitation. As such, agriculture efficiency and natural resource management need to be 
integrated into a sustained holistic public investment effort to foster production and farm revenues—as part 
of a broader strategy to promote the agricultural sector as a priority for jobs and ensuring food security. At the 
local level, economic incentives are needed to reverse the ever-higher costs of public investments in agriculture. 
Appropriate tariffs and subsidies would encourage famers to adopt water saving technologies and reduce losses, 
increasing yield per unit of land (although these may not resulting in water productivity), building on success-
ful past efforts (a water saving strategy previously implemented resulted in increased awareness of the value of 
water to economic development), while pursuing well-tested integrated rural development approaches.

The unsustainable use of natural capital reduces 
the flow of economic and social benefits such 
that it is more difficult to achieve sustainable 
development, poverty reduction, and other de-

velopment goals. The linkages between these is-
sues are stronger in Tunisia because an important 
proportion of the population is dependent on 
natural capital. It is therefore important to ensure 
an inclusive and participatory approach to: (i) con-
sider natural resources as an integral part of a more 
comprehensive and sustainable socio-economic 
development paradigm, whereby these resources 
would be viewed as key support for improved live-
lihoods; (ii) consistently improve current practices 
characterized by slow, inefficient and top-down 
decision-making processes; and (iii) significantly 
reconcile broad environmental protection con-
cerns and local socio-economic priorities, as well 
as optimally balance potential gains in natural 
capital and productivity including at household 
level (a matrix of opportunities for environmental 
sustainability is attached in Annex I.D). Further-
more, the approach should be put on strengthen-
ing and enhancing sustainable and low-carbon lo-
cal development practices (by reducing greenhouse 
gas emissions), improving the capacities of natural 
ecosystems to sequestrate carbon, maintaining and 
improving the value of goods and services of natu-
ral ecosystems, and reducing the pressures facing 
these ecosystems.

Disaster r isk Management

Tunisia is vulnerable to floods, coastal erosion and marine submersions. Over the past 30 years the coun-

try experienced 2,495 disasters that caused 1,075 deaths, with assessed economic losses of US$1 billion. The 
disasters destroyed 20.000 houses and damaged another 24,728. While the country’s location is beneficial 
for its ready access to commerce and culture in the Mediterranean coast, Tunis and all coastal towns also face 
increased vulnerabilities to floods and droughts and extreme weather events. Furthermore, given the rainfall 
decline, and the over-exploitation of its aquifers, the country’s water resources are being depleted, and its 
aquifers are subject to saline intrusion. Given the effects of climate change and variability, sea level rise, and 
rapid urban population growth (expected to increase 33 percent by 2030), the exposure of Tunisia to natural 
adverse events will continue to rise. Lower storage capacity of dams due to erosion, degradation of pastoral 
ecosystems and soils (notably in the South), and pollution due to solid waste sub-optimal management, are 
likely to increase conflicts between sectors with economic effects on agriculture, tourism, urbanization, and 
infrastructure. The effects of climate change are particularly being felt in rural poor areas. Salinization affects

Box 16: The economic cost of disasters

The likely aggregate economic losses in Tunisia from all potential environmental risks has been estimated to amount to a net present value 
of $1.05 billion, or eight percent of the urban economy of the capital city. About 59 percent of the potential losses relate to submersion risks, 
with 26 percent reflecting seismic risks and 14 percent from storm surges. An estimated 25 percent of the potential losses by 2030 would 
be attributable to climate change, with most involving flooding. Floods, a recent and major problem for the city, would likely intensify, rising 
from a current high risk to a very high risk by 2030, despite the full implementation of the trunk drainage system upgrades under way, on 
account of the likely 25 percent increase in extreme precipitation events, which can generate flood levels of more than one meter in certain 
areas of the city. In terms of coastal erosion, the coastline of the Gulf of Tunis has been receding for half a century, despite offshore protections 
mitigating the trend. In some stretches of the coastline it can recede by as much as 10 meters a year. By 2030, 27 kilometers of the urbanized 
seafront would be considered at a high risk of erosion, up from 16 kilometers in 2010. Under the assumption of a global sea level rise of 20 
centimeters by 2030, damage to sea barriers would appear likely, raising the risk of submersions for the city. By 2030, the study estimates 
that an expanded stretch of the urban seafront would be at a high risk of submersion

close to half of irrigated areas, high hydromorphy makes land unavailable for production, and increases loss of 
arable land and capital for vulnerable smallholders. The contribution of natural pasture and range in the feed 
calendar is decreasing dramatically because of droughts and over-grazing, forcing larger import of feedstuffs 
in order to cover animal requirements.

There have been limited efforts targeted to manage the risks of natural disasters. Past episodes of natural 

disasters haven’t been followed by assessments and regulatory or operational improvements. No risk assess-
ment has been performed to date, and early warning and communication systems are only partly operational. 
Cartographic information and geographical databases remain largely absent, along with texts covering specific 
risks. The National Office for Civil Protection leads various agencies in the prevention and management 
of disasters, but the structure of this arm of government has barely changed over the decades. Because of 
the potential damage from earthquakes, floods, sea surges, and tsunamis, it is necessary to install systems 
of monitoring and early warning, coupled with communications plans for alerting citizens and enterprises. 
Tunisia would also need monitoring systems to track the retreat of beaches and threats to its coastal barriers. 
Interconnectedness of hazards and vulnerabilities should be mapped for an effective Risk Reduction Master 
plan for the country. 

Overall, the country would also benefit from a better legal framework for the management of coastal 
zones, risk awareness and financial risk protection measures. Infrastructure strengthening will be critical 

in certain areas. Sewerage and drainage structures in some of the cities will require upgrading, within an over-
arching master plan. The country may significantly benefit from a comprehensive and integrated resilience 
and risk management information system that incorporates all hazards and all sectors (water, energy, urban 
planning, infrastructure, governance and social, risk financing and insurance) and works as a digital com-
munication platform to track all the resiliency initiatives, experts and activities, knowledge sharing, capacity 
building, community feedback and ownership enhancement activities. More specifically the capital city could 
adopt a holistic approach to increase its resilience to natural hazard by developing an urban resilience master 
plan that will help strengthen the technical understanding of multi-hazard risks and enhance the city’s coping 
capacity to manage the adverse impacts of disasters. This could be done through the generation and utiliza-
tion of hazard and vulnerability data, thus supporting the following outcomes: (i) the development of a local 
platform to support awareness and widespread understanding of the ways in which risks can be reduced; 
(ii) improvements in the preparedness and response capacity of the City; and (iii) identification of the City’s 
priority development needs to catalyze investments to protect lives, livelihoods, and assets.

Criteria/filters to identify reform 
Priorities

The SCD mandate is to identify the key constraints and reform priorities to progress toward the twin 

goals. For Tunisia, the diagnostic has been built around two pillars: (i) accelerate growth and private sector-
led job creation to increase prosperity; and (ii) improve equality of opportunity for shared prosperity and sup-
port those who might be left behind. The objective of this part of the diagnostic is to prioritize from among 
the many identified constraints and opportunities to focus on those interventions that can be expected to have 
the broadest impact in accelerating Tunisia’s progress toward inclusive and sustainable economic growth. Each 
constraint has been assessed against its impact on progress toward the twin goals and, specifically for Tunisia, 
toward the two main pillars identified in the conceptual framework. The areas of opportunity have also been 
assessed against a number of criteria which include:

•	 Preconditions: Foundational constraints that are prerequisite for resuming growth and improving wel-
fare (notably political and economic stability but also key elements of governance).
•	 Maximizing impact on the twin goals: Potential impact on sustainable poverty reduction and improve-
ment in the welfare of the bottom 40 percent. However, particular attention will be given to the mul-
tiple dimensions of shared prosperity, in particular channels of inclusive growth, with a greater role for 
labor market and employment (and less reliance on universal social assistance and subsidies) and equal 
opportunities.
•	 Complementarities: Degree to which programs/policies could have positive impacts in other domains 
that are key to address constraints to growth, inclusion and sustainability (for example energy subsidy 
reform).
•	 Time horizon of impacts: This criterion would assess the time frame of impacts and weigh quick wins 
against longer-term impacts. It also supports the process of carefully sequencing reforms.
•	 Evidence-based: This would ensure that there is a clear evidence-base guiding the proposed policies/
programs (robust evidence carries greater weight). 
•	 Citizen participation: This filter uses the degree to which citizen involvement in the form of increased 
information, authority, or participation is going to impact the pace and modality of progress toward the 
twin goals. It also informs the extent to which actions support the building of ownership not just on the 
“what” but also on the “how” of the reform agenda.
•	 Political feasibility: This would assess the country’s political economy, and the governance and institu-
tional issues that would impact the ability to address the constraint. While this criterion is not expected 
to affect the ranking of the constraints (as the SCD should highlight the biggest priorities, irrespective of 
political feasibility), but would inform the process of mapping actions into a CPF.

Box 17: Consultations

The SCD was informed by consultations with key stakeholders in Tunisia with separate sessions that were conducted with the government, 
private sector, and a group of academics, think tanks, and civil society. The main purpose of the external consultations was to seek their 
insights and inputs into the diagnostics and assess the way they portray the emerging reform priorities for broader improvements in growth 
and progress toward inclusion. From the discussions held it appeared that most of the messages emerging from the diagnostic are aligned 
with the assessment and perceptions of both government and civil society. There is also a strong alignment on the most binding constraints 
as identified in the SCD (a constraining business environment and investment climate; heavy state involvement and lack of transparency 
and accountability in service delivery to firms and citizens; low quality of education and skills mismatch combined with a dysfunctional 
labor market). However, there was some degree of freedom  in terms of sequencing of the reforms and implementation. The discussions 
highlighted the importance of tackling the economic reforms (simplify the tax regime; expedite procedure for public investment; encourage 
private investment and job creation through reforms of the business environment) while paying attention to a renewed social contract, which 
will empower citizen by informing them (through data and information awareness campaigns) and strengthen the implementation of the legal 
arsenal to fight corruption and end impunity. New challenges were identified in the declining public support for democracy since 2011, the 
difficult fiscal situation with a constant increase in the weight of public salaries, subsidies, and debt servicing on the budget and some of the 
consequences of the Libyan crisis (migration, remittances, and security issues). 

•	 Sustainability: This filter would assess the present of any serious constraint on sustainability that could 

compromise the achievement of the goals and that would need to be addressed to ensure effective reforms. 
In this sense, it represents a medium-term perspective of the feasibility pre-conditions, and it takes into 
account political and social stability, the adequacy of the macro and fiscal framework and environmental 
sustainability.

The ultimate objective of the SCD’s prioritization of constraints is to assist in the identification of reforms 
to support growth and shared prosperity efforts by the Government (and donors), and to inform the 
World Bank Group’s Country Partnership Framework (CPF). The CPF will be defined and agreed upon 

with the Government of Tunisia and will outline the World Bank Group’s work in Tunisia over the next four 
to five year period. As the SCD is a public document, it is also intended to be a resource for the general public. 
The role played by sectoral (GPs) and country experts has been essential in rating the constraints according to 
the criteria highlighted above and selecting the priorities. As the prioritization exercise requires substantial judg-
ment it was also important to ensure that the process was carried out in an open and participative manner. A first 
brainstorming meeting was held after the review meeting for the Concept Note of the SCD with the relevant 
World Bank Group team (Tunisia team and GPs experts) to collect suggestions on the identification of reform 
priorities. Discussions were also held with relevant stakeholders in Tunisia in january 2015 on the concept note 
of the report (Box 17). The SCD team also engaged with the wider country team during a CPF workshop held 
in Tunis in january 2015 where the preliminary results of the analytical work and diagnostic were presented 
and the enlarged team engaged in discussions and working sessions on the selection criteria to identify priorities 
and areas of engagement for the country to accelerate growth, boost shared prosperity and promote inclusion.

Rating of the criteria and the ranking exercise. The multidisciplinary SCD team consisted of experts across 
14 Global Practices and Cross-Cutting Solution Areas from the World Bank, IFC, and MIGA. The team con-
tributed analyses based on existing literature and produced, in some cases, new analyses to identify constraints 
to inclusive growth. These constraints have then been ranked on the basis of the analytical assessment and 
country-specific context and according to their impact on: (i) growth, (ii) private sector-led job creation, and 
(iii) shared prosperity, poverty, and inclusion. The diagnostic identified “overarching” constraints, considered 
as a prerequisite for any type of reform and their sustainability, and “specific” constraints, which present spe-
cific bottlenecks that appear to prevent further growth and to constrain its inclusiveness. The results of the 
ranking of the constraints by areas are reported in Table 4 below. The definition of the constraints is reported 
in Annex I Table A.

*These constraints refer in particular to the weak management of SOEs and autonomous government agencies affecting the delivery of services in specific sectors

Strong complementarities (as well as trade-offs) exist between different areas of analysis, leading to a 
different ranking of some of the identified constraints vis-à-vis different objectives (i.e.; growth or social 

inclusion). The different ranking of each group of constraints (and within each group, of the individual con-
straints) vis-à-vis the three selected objectives/pillars comes from the assessment of different impact on each 
pillar of removing selected constraints. For instance, the presence of macro imbalances is perceived as a major 
constraint to growth—as an overall constraint—but it has not been considered the most binding constraint 
when it comes to inclusion or private sector job creation (which might seem initially quite counterintuitive. 
See Table 4). Table B in Annex I presents the ranking of the overarching constraints within each group. That 
table shows the different “nature” of each constraint, or rather the channels through which they might oper-
ate. For instance, even though macroeconomic imbalances are not perceived as the most binding constraint 
for private sector job creation, although they remain an overarching constraint, the composition of public 
spending, for instance, and its inefficiency, is seen as the most pressing issue to address to support the private 
sector (for instance through investment in key infrastructure and rebalancing expenditure toward investment 
rather than consumption). While all these constraints are considered relevant for progress in the reforms (and 
their sustainability) the internal ranking might give us a sense of where reforms might be more pressing.

overarching Constraints 

limited mechanisms for voice and accountability and to address elite capture

Limited mechanisms for voice and accountabilty and the quality of governance and state institutions 
emerged as overarching constraints to shared prosperity and inclusion. The lack of a functioning 

88

institutional setting to control for corruption/elite capture is the most important governance factor 

constraining growth and job creation. Recent analysis117 highlights the importance of “institutions” (mea-
sured, as a proxy, by size of government, rule of law and regulations among others) in determining growth 
patterns in middle income countries (and to avoid the so-called “middle income trap” where countries remain 
“trapped” in the income ladder and are unable to reach high income levels). The macro dimesion of gover-
nance, together with the “social capital” of a nation, including well established institutions which allow citi-
zens participation and ensure protection of their rights, has been recognized more and more as an important 
factor for a country’s economic progress.118 In Tunisia, governance is also one of the foundations of a renewed 
“social pact,” which is a start to rebuilding the broken trust between state and citizens. At this point in time, 
it is difficult to assess implementation of most governance reforms that have been anchored in the new legisla-
tion. For instance, conflict of interest and financial disclosure frameworks covering public officials, important 
tools in addressing elite capture, remain weak. Implementation of reforms, including increased governance in 
sectors, is highly dependent on the capacity of civil servants and public institutions, which, while increasing, 
will require time and resources for considerable improvements.

Emerging macro vulnerabilities

The macroeconomic and fiscal environment exhibits large vulnerabilities which, if not addressed, will 
prevent progress toward a more inclusive and sustained growth. A sound macro and fiscal framework 

(albeit with the structural weaknesses described above as part of the growth diagnostic) have contributed to 
the remarkable achievements in the past in terms of poverty reduction and human development progress. The 
recent and emerging macro imbalances threaten some of these achievements (above all in terms of poverty 
reduction) and might even reverse some of the established gains. Deeper medium-term structural reforms are 
essential for improving Tunisia macroeconomic and fiscal prospects, and for the country’s ability to reduce 
poverty and boost shared prosperity. Fiscal consolidation should be based on increasing low tax revenues and 
reducing high spending, particularly on fuel subsidies, where the GOT has taken encouraging steps. On the 
spending side, the wage bill drift needs to be reversed or at least contained through strict controls on new 
hiring, freezing of high salaries, and strategic staff reduction. More importantly, any effort on the macro-fiscal 
consolidation side will need to be coupled with the deep structural reforms necessary to kickstart the struc-
tural transformation of the economy, and to address the most binding constraints to growth.

increased social inclusion and equal opportunities are paramount to social stability 
and economic participation

The diagnostic highlighted how growth alone will not be sufficient by itself to ensure that the gener-
ated prosperity is shared across all segments of the population. To break with the development model of 

117 IMF “growth slowdowns and the middle income trap.” The “middle-income trap” is the phenomenon of hitherto rapidly growing 
economies stagnating at middle-income levels and failing to graduate into the ranks of high-income countries. In this study the 
middle-income trap is examined as a special case of growth slowdowns, which are identified as large sudden and sustained devia-
tions from the growth path predicted by a basic conditional convergence framework. The authors looked into the role of institu-
tions, demography, infrastructure, the macroeconomic environment, output structure, and trade structure.
118 The development of an institutional and legal framework to enable citizens’ rights and their engagement in the society (what we have 
defined here as “social” capital) implies tackling the legal gaps and the institutional weaknesses also at micro level, addressing failures, 
such as the lack of a functioning system to address cases of corruption, leading to the potential perpetration of abuses of the past.

the past it will be crucial to ensure equal opportunities to all and that the rights and freedom of minorities 
are safeguarded. These are defined not only as equal access to services but also as putting in place the condi-
tion for currently excluded groups of the population to actively engage in social, political, and economic life. 
This means, first and foremost, to ensure that regional disparities are addressed. It also means to tackle long-
standing structural obstacles that prevent youth and women in Tunisia from gaining access to productive and 
rewarding jobs. Failure to recognize this risks the undermining of political support for a stable, fairer, and 
democratic society.

Specific Constraints/Areas of focus 

Complementarities, linkages, and tradeoffs exist between all the areas identified in the diagnostic as 

constraints. These links can’t be ignored and call for a more holistic view of Tunisian development than a 
simple ranking exercise can present. Within each group/area there are specific topics that could act as potential 
game changers even if they are located in an area that has not been ranked as the highest priority of interven-
tion. The aim of this diagnostic is to present them in a way that would help prioritizing areas of focus but 
without losing contact with the country’s own development priorities. For Tunisia, specifically, the need to 
“switch gears” in the design of economic policies emerges from each individual constraint, requiring embed-
ding within each specific policy the “soft” side of agency and participation, which is what determines not only 
economic progress but also social advances. This is the lens through which the areas of focus (and later on the 
mirrored opportunities) are presented below. A more detailed description of the channels through which these 
constraints impact growth, private sector development and job creation, and shared prosperity and inclusion 
is presented in Annex I. A.

An unleveled playing field as one of the biggest constraints to inclusive growth

Tunisia’s business environment, its weak market contestability, and the absence of a regulatory envi-
ronment conducive to private investment are among the top constraints to growth and private sector 

development in Tunisia. The private sector has been unable to reach its full potential due to the distortions 
in the regulatory framework that provided privileged access to politically connected firms. The weak business 
climate continues today to limit new firms entry, along with the competitiveness and efficiencies of existing 
firms, thereby directly affecting job generation and thus growth. Regulatory capture, stemming from au-
thorization requirements, investment restrictions or fiscal advantages allowed firms owned by Ben Ali’s clan 
to record spectacularly higher levels of output, profits and growth than their competitors. Steps have been 
taken to address elite capture and other forms of corruption, but progress remains limited and legislative gaps 
remain. The heavy cost of bureaucracy continues to represent a burden especially for the small entrepreneurs 
that do not have the means to outsource the handling of administrative requirements; this burden induces 
small companies to remain informal. 

Government regulations and actions in Tunisia continue to be distortive of market development and 

generate unintended barriers to competition. Sectors in which investment faces restrictions account for 
over 50 percent of the Tunisian economy, whether through the Investment Incentives Code, the Competition 
Law, or specific sectoral legislation. Many of these sectors at present remain de facto closed to competition. 
In addition, there are legal constraints to the sale of the stakes held by the government in publicly controlled 
firms in some of these sectors. Firms in these sectors de facto benefit from rents that arise because they face 
limited competition. These firms remain profitable largely thanks to the protection they enjoy in the domestic 

90

market—at the expense of the consumers who are forced to buy more expensive and lower quality goods pro-
duced by the uncompetitive onshore firms—further reducing investment and productivity. The Competition 
Law does not in fact support competition and the weak governance of SOEs further undermines the opera-
tions of markets.

An undiversified and non-inclusive financial sector prevents efficient allocation of 
resources

Growth is also inhibited by the lack of an inclusive, stable and diversified financial sector capable of 
efficiently mobilizing and allocating resources toward the most productive sectors. Weak corporate gov-

ernance of SOBs and the low level of competition in the banking sector are seen as the third most important 
constraint in the ranking of factors hindering growth. The financial sector in Tunisia is small and dominated 
by banks. Limited competition, deficient regulation, low credit intermediation, and widespread governance 
issues characterize the banking sector. With regards to financial inclusion, a 2014 World Bank study found 
that nearly 45 percent of Tunisian adults do no use formal financial services (including credit), and that the 
unmet demand for financial services is estimated to be 2.5 to 3.5 million individuals and 245,000 to 425,000 
enterprises. Inadequate bankruptcy procedures allow the survival of inefficient firms and prevent the rechan-
neling of resources toward more productive uses. The absence of long term refinancing resources for banks 
mainly through capital markets limits long term domestic lending, and impacts credit affordability. The 
insurance sector remains nascent and has not been able to respond fully to private sector insurance needs for 
production and investment purposes. 

low “connectivity” exacerbates inequalities and hinders Tunisia’s productivity potential 

The “second tier” of constraints to growth, according to the ranking exercise conducted for this diagnos-
tic, includes the lack of connectivity linked to infrastructure deficiencies, which significantly hamper 

growth and jobs creation in the private sectors. The diagnostic presented several specific examples (from 
logistics to water or electricity) of how infrastructure-related service deficiencies affect private sector’s com-
petitiveness. The heavy involvement of the State in the form of SOEs—with opaque rules for governance 
and accountability—has prevented infrastructure-related services from operating efficiently and fairly. For 
instance, while Tunisia is been perceived as an example of good practices in logistics in the MENA region, 
logistics costs related to infrastructure-related services (such as transit costs for containers or shipping costs) 
severely hinder trade and competitiveness. Growth in lagging regions has been hindered also by the weak 
quality of infrastructure, resulting from spatially biased public investment that does not support private sector 
investment and increases transportation costs of goods to ports/markets. Conversely, private sector participa-
tion in road rehabilitation and modernization could help the Tunisian economy to enhance its production 
potential, hence benefitting growth in all regions, but a functioning framework for PPP is still missing. Fi-
nally, the telecommunications infrastructure, broadband, and internet services (as one of the most effective 
backbone services) appear to be, among all sectors, the area with the highest potential for job creation and 
growth (and ultimately the development of human capital), thanks to competitiveness enhancing features 
and complementarities with other dimensions of growth, specifically as an enabler of democracy and social 
transformation. However, the low levels of competition until recently in the telecommunications sector has 
resulted in higher costs to consumers, including firms, and hindered Tunisia’s potential to compete in inter-
national markets and to fully use Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) as a key accelerator 
of social and economic development.

unequal opportunities and the lack of productive employment as the most binding 
constraints to shared prosperity

Inclusion and shared prosperity are prevented by the underutilization of Tunisia’s human capital and 

by unequal opportunities. Stark inequality in the access to and quality of education is a challenge to human 
capital accumulation for a large share of the population. Education is key to the accumulation of human 
capital, which is critical to obtaining high quality jobs, economic growth, and shared prosperity. While Tu-
nisia exhibits relatively strong average human capital particularly in education, the poor quality of education 
generates large inequalities of opportunity among citizens depending on the wealth and income status of their 
parents. This, in turn, widens inequality in the country, both spatially and over time. Equally important for 
shared prosperity is removing obstacles to equal access to basic services, which currently differs among popula-
tion groups and regions or areas of residence. Access to (and quality of ) water has been identified, for instance, 
as a relevant constraint to poverty reduction and to increased shared prosperity.

Labor market rules and institutions, and a fragmented social protection and labor system, are crucial 
impediments to the achievement of a more shared prosperity. The diagnostic highlighted the lack of any 

significant role for employment in the past decade in reducing poverty or boosting shared prosperity. Several 
supply and demand factors contribute to this outcome, including insufficient job creation from the private 
sector, misalignment of skills, and unequal opportunities that translate in differentiated human capital en-
dowments. The incentives inherent within social security, social assistance and labor regulations hamper job 
insertion and increase the cost of labor, resulting in inequitable employment outcomes. The current system 
fails to protect all workers while at the same time hindering job creation for the private sector by increasing 
costs for labor and reducing flexibility required to be competitive and adjust to the changing global market.

9

key opportunities to Accelerate 
growth and boost Shared Prosperity

Opportunities for reforms largely mirror the areas identified as the most relevant constraints to growth, 
private sector-led job creation and inclusion/shared prosperity. They are based on Tunisia’s potential 
and strengths, which could be unleashed by such reforms. The SCD identified two key drivers of change 

where it is advisable to take sustained initiatives. These are: (i) promote private sector-driven job creation; 
(ii) improve equality of opportunities and increase resilience. Within these areas, further efforts have been 
made to identify some specific actions that could point toward the right direction in the short/medium term 
but with a view to the long term development goals of the country. Their feasibility of implementation as well 
as the conditions in place for the sustainability of reforms are taken into account, together with the results of 
the technical analysis, in the identification and selection of areas where opportunities for advances toward the 
goals are most compelling. The team also worked on identifying the magnitude of impact of the selected areas/
opportunities and the time horizon (short-, medium-, or long-term) within which each it is expected to see 
the effect of potential actions/policies adopted to address bottlenecks. All these features together make these 
areas of opportunities as a (non-exhaustive) platform for reforms that could help guide the future develop-
ment policies of the country. A detailed presentation of actions/reforms with potential highest impact is pre-
sented in Annex I.C. The subsequent sections present the main areas where the SCD sees Tunisia’s strengths 
and where ongoing reforms or dialogue on reforms would sustain progress toward more inclusive growth and 
a new development model.

restoring Sound Debt Sustainability and Maintaining Macro and Financial 
Stability is a prerequisite for any Type of reform

Restoring debt sustainability and assuring macroeconomic and financial stability is central to protect-
ing the income and wellbeing of the less well-off and creating the basic conditions for private invest-

ment, growth, and shared prosperity. As mentioned earlier in the diagnostic, emerging macroeconomic 
imbalances are threatening the space for expansionary policies aimed to support growth. Addressing fiscal 
risks and ensuring fiscal space for growth enhancing investments are therefore first order policies.119 Among 
the critical (though not exhaustive) policy actions needed to restore debt sustainability and assure macro 
and financial sector stability are reducing fiscal support to public enterprises, reinforcing governance and the 

119 In june 2013, Tunisia joined a 24-month Stand-By Arrangement program by IMF in an amount equivalent to $1.75 billion. The 
focus of the program is to contribute to short-term macroeconomic stabilization and lay foundations for higher and more inclusive 
growth, including by moving forcefully on banking reforms.

oversight and bank resolution framework, reducing public sector wage bills and pension costs, and better 
managing the public finances, including rebalancing the composition of expenditures toward productive and 
growth-enhancing investment and away from heavy reliance on consumption subsidies.120 

Steps have been taken to initiate fiscal consolidation and the recent governments have demonstrated 
commitment to structural reforms to halt the rise in public debt. The first actions in the reform of the fuel 

subsidies system have been taken121 and the adoption of restructuring plans for the major public banks are 
encouraging steps in the right direction. Initiatives have been taken also to improve budget composition by 
increasing capital spending—particularly in poorer regions—in line with absorption capacity. These reforms 
need to be coupled with increased efficiency in the use of resources, and the rebuilding of fiscal buffers. Ef-
forts are also undergoing to improve the revenue side, and in the near future progress on a comprehensive 
tax reform strategy (following a recent National Tax Consultation and the adoption of the new tax code) is 
envisaged for a more transparent, efficient, and equitable system. Finally, the contingent favorable shock on 
the oil price could facilitate progress in some of these actions as potential net gains materialize from the price 
differential with the benchmark originally assumed as part of the Budget Law. 

Strengthen the link between growth, Welfare, and Citizens participation

The main challenge for Tunisia today is to identify channels to strengthen the link between growth, 
welfare and citizens participation/agency. Having a political space conducive to address this issue is also 

its greatest opportunity. Tunisia, as most middle-income countries, has made considerable strides in terms of 
meeting the basic needs of the population (as shown in the improvement of human development indicators). 
However, as shown also in recent analysis, to progress further middle income countries need to strengthen 
the link between growth and social progress. Although growth would not necessarily determine further social 
progress, advances in terms of citizens’ participation and agency, and improved governance in the economy and 
in the society at large would unleash the potential for higher growth thanks to a more dynamic private sector 
and enhanced human and social capital. For countries like Tunisia, this would require putting policies in place 
to ensure that opportunities are equitable and institutions capable of implementing and safeguarding rights. 

Reforms to address governance gaps, particularly in relation to enhancing civil and political rights have 
been initiated and represent a crucial step toward a more just, open, and inclusive society. Since the 2011 

Revolution, Tunisia has passed new elections regulations, allowing for greater public engagement in the election 
process and enhancing accountability of elected officials. The successful completion of the election cycle by the 
end 2014 are the testimony that the building blocks of a democratic system are fully in place and represent a 
structural break with the past. Citizen engagement has been enhanced by government decisions allowing citizen 
participation in the public service assessment process, delivery of public services and legislative drafting, and a 
public consultation website was created to promote participation in policy making. The newly adopted consti-
tution enhances the right to access to information together with a number of civil rights including: academic 

120 The implementation of a tight monetary policy and a more flexible exchange rate policy are also essential to reducing external 
vulnerabilities, improving Tunisia’s price competitiveness, and rebuilding foreign exchange buffers
121 For example, all energy subsidies to the cement sector have been eliminated since 2013. Recent increases in electricity and fuel 
prices, and the introduction of a reduced electricity tariff for households consuming less than 100 kWh, are also steps in the right 
direction. Public spending savings from these measures are estimated at 0.2 percent of GDP. Eliminating energy subsidies for the 
other energy-intensive industries and increasing electricity and fuel prices for industrial users will result in an additional reduction 
in public spending of 0.5 percent of GDP in 2015.

Special Focus: Women’s economic empowerment is paramount to achieve an open and inclusive 
society and to accelerate growth.

Tunisia is at the forefront of gender equality in the MENA region. Recognized as a principle, in its Code of Personal status, in relation to socio-
economic, cultural, and political rights since 1956, gender equality is enshrined in the new 2014 Constitution, with its Article 21 proclaiming 
full equality of female and male citizens. As a result, Tunisia has the highest representation of women in the legislature in the MENA region, 
which is also comparable to OECD average. Women represent an extremely valuable asset while at the same time remaining an untapped pool 
of resources; willing to work but unable to find suitable jobs. Finding a way to break the barriers to their active participation in the economy 
will therefore free the country’s potential to accelerate growth and move up the income ladder. Active economic participation in turn also 
contributes to expand women’s agency and choice, increasing their voice and ability to influence society and challenge established norms that 
limit women’s rights and hinder economic and social development.

freedom; rights to peaceful assembly and demonstration; freedom to establish political parties, unions and as-
sociations; the right of workers to strike; and freedoms of expression, opinion, thought, and publication. The ex-
tent to which citizens can adequately exercise these rights will impact social and political exclusion. At the same 
time, the recently established (and still to be strengthened) framework to address elite capture and other forms 
of corruptions will impact the way citizens will actively engage in the economic development of the country. 

Sustain reforms of the business environment to prevent elite Capture in the 
Future

Reforms of the business environment have great potential for growth, private sector job creation, and ulti-

mately inclusion. Removing the barriers to entry and competition would substantially improve the performance 
of the Tunisian economy and boost the ability of the most productive firms to grow and create good quality jobs. 
This is the time where the socio-political space for this type of reform is open and therefore the opportunity to 
advance is the greatest. The removal of barriers to market competition should start with backbone services sec-
tors—the most shielded from competition in the past—and sectors with high potential for jobs creation, notably 
commerce and telecommunications in order to open up investment in these sectors. The gains from higher com-
petition in Tunisia would be considerable and result in faster jobs creation. There is ample empirical evidence 
internationally on the substantial benefits of allowing greater competition. The empirical analysis presented in 
the 2014 Tunisia DPR found that a five-percentage-point decrease in firms’ profit margins (driven by greater 
competition) would translate into additional GDP growth of around 4.5 percent per year and approximately 
50,000 new jobs per year. Since the 2011 revolution, important measures have already been taken to enhance 
competition and promote a level playing field. A draft competition law, for instance, that reinforces the role and 
independence of the Competition Council is under consideration and is expected to be adopted in 2015. The 
Council can play a key role in stimulating competitive forces to the benefit of consumers, including lifting barri-
ers that may be preventing retail and wholesale prices from falling toward their competitive levels. Enhancing the 
independence of the authority would constitute a valuable step toward ensuring it can fulfill this role. 

An open and engaged public-private dialogue should accompany deeper regulatory reforms. Many of 

the regulations and practices that create market power rents however, still exist and many companies continue 
to benefit from them. A drastic simplification of the pool of regulations hindering private sector activity with a 
view to reducing the room for discretion in their implementation is critical for a private sector-driven growth 
and ultimately inclusion. Moving forward, it will be crucial to build on a strong public-private sector dialogue 
on regulatory reform and develop tools to ensure that existing and new regulations are fit for purpose and 
serve the public and private interests. Detailed areas of opportunities where reforms are already ongoing or 
where conditions might be in place for their implementation are provided in Annex I.C.

Develop a National Financial Sector Strategy to increase economic opportunities

Improving access to financial services for both households and firms is critical to catalyzing private 
sector development, improving access to essential services, and increasing economic opportunities for 

the most vulnerable.122 Strengthening access to credit to firms, particularly those with no credit history and 
limited collateral (mostly MSMEs and startups), and developing alternative sources of financing will enable 
resources to be channeled to the most productive projects and allow companies to expand and invest produc-
tively.123 Some programs to improve access to finance for high value added exports have been already imple-
mented, with support of the WBG.124 There is indeed space for additional support and instruments to be 
tested with a sector-specific focus and with a more inclusive lens (for instance, focusing on addressing regional 
disparities in access to finance). To improve the efficiency of the banking system and competition within the 
sector, the most compelling reforms should focus on the restructuring state owned banks (SOBs), strictly en-
forcing bank regulations, and revising procedures to deal with banks in financial difficulty. At the household 
level, increasing financial inclusion (access to and usage of formal financial services: accounts, consumer and 
housing finance, insurance) is critical to support access to basic services (housing, education etc.), spur income 
generation and employment as well as help manage economic shocks. Financial inclusion is also positively 
correlated with financial stability and greater efficiency of financial intermediation, both important prereq-
uisites for job creation and private sector development. Further reform and expansion of the microfinance 
sector should be pursued together with the development of innovative financial instruments and approaches 
to cater to the needs for non-salaried and low-income households. The development of a national financial 
sector strategy, championed by the Central Bank and/or Ministry of Finance, represents a clear opportunity 
to agree on a road map of actions to achieve both sector development and stability objectives.

identify and invest in Sectors Where Tunisia Holds a Strategic advantage 

A new, modern type of sector-focused strategic development policy125 coupled with reforms to incentiv-
ize formal employment would support the structural transformation of the economy and advance prog-

ress toward a more inclusive growth. The government can play an active role in accompanying the develop-
ment of high potential sectors through horizontal measures and addressing coordination failures. Policies to 
improve the overall business environment could be complemented with targeted interventions aiming to cre-
ate jobs in specific sector and regions. Indeed, as discussed above, higher investments alone do not necessarily 
guarantee that the economy will create the jobs needed to improve the opportunities and standards of living 
of all Tunisians. It is important, therefore, that the government, in close consultation with social partners, also 
identifies sectoral policies for employment creation. This implies mapping key sub-sectors and value chains 
within the economy to understand the potential for job creation and the types of bottlenecks and regulatory 
failures that would need to be removed to achieve it. This mapping would provide information about the 

122 More details on reform areas in Annex I Table C2.
123 Better performance in the banking sector could increase the level of credit to the private sector by at least 10 percent of GDP, 
which could generate in excess of US$10 billion in additional investments to be injected in the economy over the next 10 years, 
corresponding roughly to an additional 38,000 additional jobs per year (Tunisia 2014 DPR).
124 These include the third export development project and the MSME facility.
125 Industrial policies pursued will have to change their nature that has so far not targeted market failure and have favored firms, rather 
than sectors.

types and level of investments that are necessary, the quantity of jobs that can be created, their composition 
in terms of skills, and their regional distribution. Annex v presents the results of an ongoing sector diagnostic 
work and business opportunities for some key sectors as identified by IFC strategy. 

These policies will also need to be accompanied by reforms to consolidate social insurance regimes 
and align labor regulations to incentivize formal employment and better protect living standards. 

In terms of social insurance, greater harmonization among private and public sector regimes, improving 
portability and aligning financing with benefits more explicitly will help to improve incentives for job cre-
ation, sustainability and coverage. In terms of labor regulations, curbing the growth of labor costs126 while 
improving income protection and services to workers would go hand in hand with social insurance reforms. 
Employment protection legislation plays a critical role in shielding workers from the negative consequences 
of arbitrary actions by employers, thereby facilitating industrial stability, the build-up of firm-specific hu-
man capital, and innovation. When employment protection and contracting is too rigid, however, firms’ 
ability to respond quickly to changes in technology or market demand in terms of hiring or retraining is 
hampered. Moving forward, it is important to accompany the targeted investment policies with the flex-
ibility of employment policies, as well as better-targeted ALMPs, that are crucial for efficient job realloca-
tion, greater job creation and economic growth. Strengthening inclusive social dialogue will help support 
the development of an integrated social protection and labor system needed to achieve the right balance 
between flexibility and security.127 

build on the policy Dialogue on important reforms to improve equity and 
efficiency of Social assistance programs and Strengthen resilience

Greater targeting of universal price subsidies and social safety nets will improve equity and fiscal space 
needed to jump-start graduation programs to productive livelihoods. Strengthening Tunisia’s social safety 

net system is a necessary complement to pro-growth reforms in order to effectively protect the poor and 
vulnerable from unforeseen shocks, maintaining purchasing power and living standards. The current exces-
sive outlay on untargeted subsidies fails to reach the poorest and paradoxically largely benefits the better off, 
thus exacerbating inequality. Existing cash transfer and health cards programs, which benefit the some of the 
poor, can be better targeted by further developing the recently conceived unique identification system for all 
social protection and labor programs and introducing exit strategies to ensure equitable access and transition 
to work for the able-bodied. Combined with the fiscal deficits facing the social security system (pensions and 
health insurance), inadequate coverage and sustainability of social protection programs highlight the need for 
comprehensive reform beginning in the near term. The new “Social Contract” signed between the govern-
ment and social partners in 2013 shows the commitment of the government to developing the policy dia-
logue on important reforms such as labor regulations, social security reform, subsidy reform, social assistance 
reform, reform of employment programs, and investment policies targeting lagging regions. Further steps in 
this direction128 are needed, and are likely to have a significant impact on growth and inclusion.

126 Reducing the tax-wedge, rationalizing redistributive arrangements, reforming dismissal procedures, and reducing discretion in the 
setting of the minimum wage.

Decentralization as a gateway to increase and equalize opportunities 

Inclusive growth can be promoted by policies aimed at addressing spatial inequalities in access to and 
quality of basic services, access to good infrastructure, and more generally targeting institutional fail-

ures that generate unequal “opportunities.” We argue in this diagnostic that equal opportunities are a 
crucial part of the “shared prosperity” goal. Increasing parity of access to quality basic services (notably water, 
health, and education services) in lagging areas will improve people’s employment opportunities, their quality 
of life, and ultimately contribute to long-term economic growth. Improving the governance, institutional and 
regulatory framework to allow both more accountable and efficient services would incentivize investment and 
allow more viable service provision, hence reducing enduring inequality in access and quality across regions.129

The government commitment to decentralization could improve provision of services at the local level. 

The new Constitution includes clear commitments to decentralization, local governance, and empowered 
local entities. The provisions of the new Constitution create the framework for fully devolved and empow-
ered local governments with autonomy for executing their mandates of providing local services according to 
transparent principles of participation by, and accountability to, their electorate.130 The expansion of formal 
authority of local governments requires reform of the intergovernmental fiscal transfer system and measures 
to increase the capabilities of local governments including through measurement and public dissemination of 
local government performance. Over time, these measures are designed to lead to better provision of services 
and infrastructure and improved governance in part through greater accountability of local governments to 
their electorate and to the central government.

129 See Annex I Table C4
130 To this end, the Constitution lays down the mandate for local governments to achieve the following: (i) financial and adminis-
trative autonomy; (ii) participatory local democracy and open election of municipal representatives; (iii) formal assignment of 
functions according to principles of subsidiarity; (iv) own source revenues and transparent, objective, and predictable systems of 
inter-governmental fiscal transfers, including consideration of issues addressing equity, equalization, and national policy priorities; 
(v) governance structures that ensure participatory governance and accountability of municipalities to electorates in decision-
making and program implementation; (vi) inter-municipal cooperation in metropolitan areas; and (vii) restructuring of the tutelle 
system to play an ex-post rather than an ex-ante oversight role.

operate; corruption (bribery, abuse of office) raises 
the costs of doing business; dispute resolution 
mechanisms (courts, arbitration, mediation) ineffective, 
further limiting private sector opportunities

Elite capture prevents competition in the private 
sector, which in turn can prevent establishment of new

Tunisia due to corruption, bribery, kickbacks, trade 
mispricing, and criminal activity between 2000 and 
2008 was, on average, approximately two percent of

(tax evasion, opting out of social security, etc.) 
Young people are most susceptible to having 
informal jobs. The proportion of individuals 
who have informal jobs in the private sector is 
almost 50 percent higher among young people 
(57 percent) than adults (33 percent). 
The low quality of youth employment is also 
reflected in their lack of job satisfaction: a vast 
majority seem to be dissatisfied with their work 
(44 percent of the landlocked regions and 38 
percent on the coast), citing the main reason of 
job dissatisfaction is lack of income.

Focus Areas
1. Business environment and Investment Climate

Weak contestability and 
competition: government regulations 
and actions are distortive of 
market development and generate 
unintended barriers to competition
Regulatory burden in establishing, 
operating, and closing business 

Negative impact on investment, employment 
generation and ultimately economic growth. Limited 
competition also limits productivity and efficiency in 
some sectors, ultimately having a negative impact on 
competitiveness
Increased cost and time of doing business; perceived 
as a key binding constraint for PSD by private sector; 
negative impact on competitiveness, investment, and 
eventually growth

Trade barriers, limited integration 
in GVCs
Inefficient and ineffective delivery 
of services by agencies influencing 
PSD, and limited/ineffective private 
sector participation

Stuck in low-value added; limits exports and 
investments, negative impact on growth and job creation
Key agencies (FIPA, APII, CEPEX) not fulfilling their 
mandate effectively and efficiently jeopardizes the 
ability to execute business climate reforms, negatively 
impact exports and investments; and eventually 
growth

Weak credit environment

Fragile public banking sector

Lack of competition in the banking 
sector

Limited financial inclusion among 
households and micro businesses

2. Financial Sector

Weak credit risk sharing information system, 
restrictive interest rate regulation, loose banking 
sector regulation and inefficient bankruptcy regime 
limiting access to credit and firms’ activity growth.
Ailing state owned banks jeopardizing overall financial 
sector stability and future credit growth. 
Poor financial innovation and financial services quality 
maintaining the gap between supply and demand.

Financial exclusion stymies the emergence of new 
businesses, reducing income generation opportunities 
among poor households, and depresses private sector 
employment prospects, particularly in rural areas. 
Financial inclusion is positively correlated with financial 
stability and greater efficiency of financial intermediation, 
both of which are important prerequisites for job creation 
and private sector development.

Limited competition increases prices for end 
consumers and negatively affects the quality of 
goods and services. It prevents the creation of a 
level playing field, and for some sectors, creates 
unnecessary barriers for small and local players.
Heavily regulated market access acts as 
smokescreen for rents extraction by politically 
connected firms who receive privilege access 
to lucrative activities. Reduces transparency, 
increases the scope for corruption, cronyism, 
and arbitrariness
Impact exacerbated if we link it to marginalized 
sectors or regions
Other institutions (tax authority, competition 
council, etc.) not fulfilling their mandate 
effectively and efficiently negatively impacts 
transparency, equity, and the creation of a level 
playing field

Borrowers without credit history or collateral 
(startups, youth, and women in particular) 
having limited access to credit opportunities.

Public banks not fully participating in the 
financial inclusion agenda. 
Supply/demand gap issues are stronger 
in lagging regions, where banking sector 
competition is even shallower.
Financial exclusion makes it more difficult for 
poor households to manage economic shocks, 
generate income, and invest productively in 
health and educational outcomes for their 
families. It also makes it more difficult for 
governments to provide social transfers at a 
reasonable cost.

creation

and inclusion

(continued)

Underdeveloped capital markets

Underdeveloped insurance sector

Skewed wages and benefits 
between public and private sectors 
(particularly SMEs and self-
employed)

SMEs, large firms, and households having limited 
opportunities in terms of access to long term financing 
to finance their large projects.
Poor solvency in certain insurance segments 
(compulsory motor insurance) and institutions, weak 
supervisory framework, underdeveloped market 
infrastructure and fraud impede a healthy development 
of the sector to respond to private sector insurance 
needs for production and investment purposes. Poor 
institutional investor base (insurance companies) to 
fuel demand for capital market products.

3 Labor Market and Social Protection

Reduces incentives for private job growth and 
exacerbating public sector employment queuing, wage 
bill and sustainability of public spending

Difficult access to long term financing, limiting 
affordable housing policies.

Limited development of insurance services 
which makes it difficult for poor households to 
manage economic and social shocks and which 
increase likelihood of drifting into poverty at the 
occurrence of such shocks. 

Gender: Women have a higher preference 
for employment in the public sector than the 
private sector, especially women who live in 
landlocked regions.
Youth: Jobs in the public sector are most 
preferred by young people though they are less 
likely to get a job in the public sector. When it 
comes to judging government “efforts to create 
and improve employment opportunities,” more 
than half of young people are very dissatisfied.
By Region: Particularly in the landlocked 
regions, the public sector fulfills a semi-safety 
net function, hiring a higher proportion of young 
people who have lower levels of education. On 
the coast, on the other hand, the public sector 
is rarely a source of employment for young 
people who have not completed high school.
In general, women are more likely to be 
inactive or in low quality jobs. Youth are much 
more likely to be inactive or unemployed. The 
poor, overall, are more like to be unemployed or 
in low quality jobs.
Across all deciles, inactivity and unemployment 
among youth are worse than among the overall 
working age population (2.5 to 3 times more 
likely than adults to be unemployed). The share 
of youth labor market inactivity increases 
across deciles and reaches 80 percent among 
the richest. Around two out of three youth with 
tertiary education are unemployed.
In the poorest households, less than 20 percent 
of workers are in formal wage employment in 
the private or public sectors. The majority are 
in irregular wage employment (40 percent), 
or self-employed in agricultural or non-
agricultural activities. Compared to the richest 
households where nearly 75 percent of workers 
are in formal wage employment. 
Impinges sustainability of social insurance, 
health insurance and efforts to institute 
unemployment insurance
Lack of social protection leaves workers 
prone to shocks and inability to enhance living 
standards

(continued on next page)

Lack of effective and efficient 
ALMPs and public employment 
services to help unemployed 
(including youth, women, and the 
poor) find a job.
(Lack of institutions to efficiently 
deal with labor market 
imperfections)

Targeted ALMPs and effective public employment 
services could help curb unemployment and boost 
growth. The current high unemployment levels, 
especially for women and youth, clearly impact the 
long-run growth potential for the country. In 2014: 
only 50 percent of the total working age population 
participated in the labor market. Among those who 
participate in the labor market: 18 percent are 
unemployed; 41 percent are in low quality jobs as 
wage employees in the informal sector or are self-
employed (ex. Farmers, un-paid workers). 
With a very low participation rate for women (just 
under 26 percent compared to 71 percent for men) 
and youth in the bottom decile (40 percent do not 
participate in the labor market, and only around 
20 percent are employed).

High tax wedge impinging on 
benefit level, job creation and equity 

Lack of unemployment insurance 
(UI) leaves workers vulnerable to 
shocks

Contributes to low productivity, low-value added 
sectors and impinges growth acceleration and quality 
of jobs
Impinges flexibility needed to promote job creation and 
boost quality of jobs

102

(continued)

Increasing deficits and fragmentation 
among CNSS, CNAM and AMG 
regimes, impinging on equity 
Poor targeting and leakage of 
social safety nets and consumption 
subsidies
Lack of graduation mechanisms for 
social safety nets

Public Investment: Weak preparation 
and selection of public investment 
projects.
Public procurement as bottleneck 
for execution of investment projects

Weak management of large and 
medium-size cities and inadequate 
policies to enable different sets of 
cities to realize their capabilities
Corporate governance for private 
companies 

Despite a high urbanization rate, 
the country is relatively low 
density limiting the potential to 
leverage economies of scale and 
agglomeration

Heavy state involvement and 
opaque rules for governance and 
accountability, and very low overall 
openness to private investments in 
infrastructure across sectors- have 
dragged down operational efficiency 
of key infrastructure services 
and delayed critical investment 
decisions (including power, water 
and transport)

Accelerate growth and private-sector-led job 
creation

Poverty/shared prosperity  
and inclusion

Likelihood increases for high informality (and low-
productivity)

Inequality in benefit levels and lack of 
portability reduces mobility 

Reduces capacity for boosting purchasing power of 
bottom 40 percent and lagging regions for contributing 
to growth in lagging regions
Reduces employability and narrows potential labor 
force for attracting investment

4. Governance-specific constraints

Impinges on resilience and inclusion

Exacerbates intergenerational vulnerability and 
poverty

Delays important investments which could support 
private sector growth

Missed opportunity to close the spatial divide 
and gap in infrastructure 

Given public procurement’s importance in budget 
execution (it accounts for 18 percent of the Tunisian GDP 
and 40 percent of the State budget), any improvements 
to public procurement will be reflected in the service 
delivery efforts and broader economy and growth.
Public procurement is a huge market from which small 
and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Tunisia should 
be deriving a significant share, considering their overall 
contribution to and makeup of the economy. Therefore, 
the extension of SME access to government contracts 
can be viewed as a trigger to promote economic 
growth in the region and create jobs
Risk to exacerbate the duality of the economic model, 
enlarging the gap between the big coastal cities and 
the rest of the country

Regional and local public services and civil 
servants in Tunisia are suffering from a weak 
capacity in terms of procurement management 
and processing, resulting in huge bottlenecks 
and delays in implementing development 
projects in local level. Any improvement of 
capacity and institutions at the local level 
and better decentralization of procurement 
oversight will help local governments 
implement their investment programs resulting 
in job creation and better share of prosperity 
and access to service delivery.

Imbalances in ownership of the economic 
development agenda are reflected in unequal 
access and outcomes and spatial disparities

Lack of good corporate governance practices including 
partial lack of awareness and lack of “peer pressure” 
in applying good practices 

5. Infrastructure [includes energy] and logistics

A stronger focus on high-density and transit-
oriented development would contribute to 
better access to jobs and opportunities

Urban transport SOE financial situation and 
heavy centralization of decision making, 
contribute to deteriorating level of services to 
people living in cities. This in turns reduces 
urban poor access to opportunities and 
services
Challenges of financial sustainability and 
governance/management in service providers 
(rural and urban utilities) impacts their ability 
to expand services to presently unserved 
population, and provide reliable (no cut), 
continuous (24/7), and sustainable services. 

Low density increases cost of delivering services and 
competitiveness of cities. A stronger focus on urban 
planning and transit-oriented development reduces 
the impact of congestion and, in the case of city ports 
(such as Tunis), support private sector investment in 
and around cities
Poor performance of transport SOE is resulting in poor 
level of services, and budget on the state, contributing to 
poor performance of the transport sector in supporting 
freight and logistics. A typical example is the port of 
Rades, whose performance is very much constrained not 
only by infrastructure but also the performance of STAM 
Inefficiencies in public spending (e.g. untargeted 
subsidies) and lack of integrated strategy of water, 
agriculture, and natural resource management. 
Traditional public investments cannot respond to 
desired economic and social needs in long term 
given in climate risks and population growth. 1) High 
capital investment and maintenance for inter-basin 
conveyance canals and storage infrastructure are ever 
costlier due to higher cost of withdrawals, weighing on 
government budget and utility financial sustainability 
and performance, ultimately affecting quality of 
services. 2) Policy decisions are prone to inefficiencies 
due to misaligned incentives.

Accelerate growth and private-sector-led job 
creation

Limited public investment in the road sector 
connecting lagging regions to Tunis and coastal areas 
is limiting attractiveness of these regions to private 
sector investment, which would result in job creation 
and growth
ICT potential: Poor broadband connectivity across 
the country is limiting the impact at local level of the 
Government ICT strategy “Tunisie Digitale 2018” in 
terms of yearly job creation in the ICT sector (from 
7,500 in 2013 up to 25,000 in 2018) and in terms of 
ICT exports (from 950 Mio DNT in 2013 up to 4,000 
in 2018) 
Example of the Port of Rades: in addition to poor 
performance of STAM, the port current infrastructure 
needs upgrading to better handle containers. 
Improvement in logistics requires better coordination 
and multi-modal approach with a stronger role for 
railways.

Poverty/shared prosperity  
and inclusion

People living in lagging regions feel more 
isolated and neglected than those in coastal 
areas. Limited maintenance contributed to 
poor state of local roads and limited access to 
services and opportunities
Poor availability of broadband outside richest 
areas is leading to an ongoing risk that the 
bottom 40 percent of population in Tunisia 
will remain excluded from the information 
revolution that is shaping the modern world

Poor logistics performance contributes to 
higher cost of transportation, resulting in 
higher cost of imports and uncompetitive local 
products. This contributes to vulnerability of 
poor people and higher cost of goods.

6. Human capital
(a) Education

Skills mismatch due to weak linkages between the 
curriculum in the education system and the skills 
demanded by the private sector
There is a severe discrepancy between the 
competencies required by the labor market and the 
subjects students are studying in higher education. 
Choice of fields of study in the landlocked regions of 
the country are less adapted to the private sector:
University graduates from landlocked regions are 
twice as likely to study literature and humanities, and 
less likely to study economics and law (21 percent) or 
to pursue engineering studies (nine percent) compared 
to graduates on the coast. It is possible that the fields 
of study in the landlocked regions reflect the lack of 
variety of opportunities that exist in the private sector, 
with higher education supporting primarily the needs 
of the public sector.
The rates of underemployment and mismatch are 
exceptionally high among university graduates, 
reaching 30 percent for technicians and 36 percent for 
those with a bachelor’s degree in humanities. At the 
same time, the distribution of skills favors occupations 
that have less demand in the labor market, to the 
detriment of occupations such as machine operations, 
craftsmen, accountants, and salesman. Such mismatch 
between demand and supply of skills prevents an 
efficient allocation of resources and limits growth
Low quality of learning outcomes at the primary 
and second levels result in low quality of inputs to 
vocational and higher education, and thus has a 
negative effect on the skills of their graduates. This acts 
as a constraint to growth by limiting the potential for 
firms to tap into high quality skills required to move up 
the value added chain as well as the innovation ladder

Skills mismatch due to weak linkages between 
the curriculum in the education system and the 
skills demanded by the private sector
The lack of private sector jobs in landlocked 
regions is also reflected in higher 
unemployment rates for the highest levels of 
study (in comparison to the regions on the 
coast), due to the mismatch between the skills 
of university graduates and those sought in the 
labor market.

Disadvantaged interior regions suffer from even 
lower quality of education services due to poor 
infrastructure and less qualified teachers

Accelerate growth and private-sector-led job

(b) Health

Narrows household investments in other productive 
investments/purchasing power needed to simulate 
consumption/growth

Despite availability of health 
coverage, households out-of-pocket 
spending remains important, 
threatening poverty and shared 
prosperity

Low quality of health facilities

Poverty/shared prosperity  
and inclusion

Exacerbates intergenerational vulnerability and 
poverty.
Out-of-pocket payments remain high, accounting 
for nearly 37 percent of total health expenditure 
in 2013. In consequence, the incidence of 
“catastrophic” health expenditures and the 
incidence of impoverishment due to out-of-pocket 
health payments are also high. In addition, there 
is a lack of targeted resource allocation policies 
based on population needs and performance-
based provider payment mechanisms, which 
leads to geographical inequity.
The quality of services is reportedly lower in 
underserved areas and in public facilities with 
notable differences in staff treatment, waiting 
times, and basic amenities. As a consequence, 
despite a significant improvement in the health 
status of the Tunisian population during the last 
two decades, progress in health outcomes has 
been uneven.

7. Natural Resources Management/Disaster Risk Management

Centralized management model 
of forests and rangeland in 
Tunisia contributes to institutional 
and market failures, and to the 
inefficient use and degradation of 
these resources. 

Lower productivity in the agricultural and livestock 
sectors results in low-value added jobs, preventing 
asset accumulation, and preventing the release of 
labor and capital to support the growth of the non-
farm sector. 

The current legal framework 
constitutes the main bottleneck 
to implement the articles of 
the constitutions related to the 
management of natural resources.

See above.

Absence of effective disaster risk 
management systems enabling 
substantial impact (in financial and 
human terms) of disasters

Environmental degradation is a development issues 
for Tunisia that could reverse development gains. Of 
particular interest: industrial pollution and mining 
sectors. 

This is a key constraint to achieving reduction 
in poverty and shared prosperity particularly 
among the poorest communities of the 
North-West and Center-West parts of Tunisia. 
Degradation of forestry and rangeland 
resources lowers the productivity of associated 
agriculture and livestock economic sectors, on 
which households depend for their livelihoods. 
Sector-specific policies and institutional 
reforms are needed to respond and implement 
the new constitution to improve and ensure 
co-management of natural resources. 
This will support economic growth and will help 
protect services provided by these resources 
and increase the productivity of other sectors 
such as agriculture and livestock. 
Because the poor depend on these sectors, 
these policies will also support inclusive 
growth. 
Furthermore, improved management of 
these resources will also help protect water 
resources for rural and urban areas, and reduce 
vulnerability to climate change.
Lately, the civil society has been very vocal 
raising local community concerns on water 
pollution from phosphate mining. There have 
been protests and conflicts among local 
communities and mining companies due to lack 
of investments in environmental protection. 
Many mining companies have limited funds 
to put in place sound environmental systems 
aimed at reducing pollution. This is an area 
where the public and private sector can work 
together to improve the health and safety of 
local communities by bringing financing as well 
as the knowledge to reduce industrial pollution.

Key Knowledge gaps

The SCD has drawn from existing studies (see Table A for a selection of these studies) as well as under-

taken some new analyses (see table A1), specifically: (i) on poverty diagnostics, using two rounds, 2005 
and 2010, of the Household Budget Consumption survey; (ii) a comprehensive jobs strategy; (iii) a study 
on transitional justice; (iv) water, sanitation, hygiene (WASH) and poverty diagnostic; The SCD has also 
identified areas that are clearly important for achieving progress toward the twin goals but where key data and 
knowledge gaps currently limit the ability to outline clearer and well-substantiated policy directions. Table B 
below highlights: (i)) critical data and/or knowledge gaps that cannot be filled immediately, but are crucial 
to address over time to assist countries achieve their development goals; and (ii) future areas of analysis or 
research where available evidence is inconclusive.

Box AIII.1: Revised methodology for poverty estimates

140 

Official poverty and inequality estimates prior to the 2011 revolution were not trusted by the public. The official estimated poverty headcount 
rate was 3.8 percent in 2005, with the rate in rural regions estimated twice as high, at around eight percent. Poverty rates would reach 
13 percent in the most disadvantaged regions, such as the Center-West region These estimates were based on a poverty line of 400 TND per 
year (equivalent to $0.75 per day), which was considered very low for a country like Tunisia. There was a sense, both from the government 
side and the public at large, that the methodology behind such estimates warranted a systematic assessment. The Tunisia interim government 
asked the Bank to review the official methodology for the analysis of the 2010 Household Budget and Consumption Survey (HBCS), which 
serves as the key input for poverty monitoring in Tunisia, and assess trends using past surveys according to revised methodology. The 
openness of the transitional Government to revisit the methodology to assess poverty provided a unique opportunity to contribute and build a 
robust methodology that more accurately represents the reality in the country.
Summary of the revisions. The basis of the estimation of poverty is the data collected by the INS in its National Budget Survey, which 
includes household consumption data. A “poverty line” is defined which is the minimum consumption expenditure necessary to meet essential 
needs, including food and non-food items. The estimate of essential food consumption expenditures is obtained by estimating the cost of 
a food basket that ensures a minimum number of calories essential for meeting energy requirements. This involves two steps. First, the 
recommended caloric requirement is calculated from the anthropometric data and the level of physical activity in different categories (large 
cities, small towns, rural areas) reported in the survey. These are in accordance with the calorie guidelines of the WHO. Second, the cost per 
unit of calorie consumed by the poorest 20 percent of the population is estimated from the survey data. These two estimates are combined 
to provide a food poverty line. Two alternative estimates are obtained for essential non-food expenditures of the poor. In the first method, the 
expenditures on non-food items of households with per capita total consumption just equal to the food poverty line are taken. This is added 
to the food poverty line to give the rock bottom (food and non-food) poverty line. In the second method, the expenditures on non-food items 
of households with per capita food consumption exactly equal to the food poverty line are taken. This is added to the food poverty line to give 
the upper threshold of poverty. The poverty line (in terms of consumption per capita per year) was estimated at 1,277 dinars in 2010 in the 
big cities, 1,158 dinars in smaller towns, and 820 dinars in rural areas. The corresponding estimates for the extreme poverty line were 757, 
733, and 571 dinars respectively.

Sector-focus diagnostic (Competitive Industries Initiative)

Context and methodology

Four “pilot” sectors were shortlisted with the government: Electronic components, Pharmaceuticals (human medicine cluster), Garments, 
and IT services. Based on literature review and preliminary analysis, these offered a balanced mixed-basket in terms of value-added and 
volume of jobs created, potential impact on structural transformation, and contribution to regional development. It must be note that this is not 
a choice of “strategic sectors,” but a choice of a starting point on larger sector work. 
The shortlisted sectors were analyzed based on four lenses that were defined in consultations with the government, the UTICA, and 
the UGTT: i) Exports profile (volume, complexity, and destination of exports based on the Product Space tool by Haussman et al.); ii) Impact 
on employment (volume, quality and adequacy to demand, based on INS and API statistics); iii) contribution to regional development (spatial 
concentration of firms/jobs in the territory, based on API and INS data); and iv) competitiveness (based on the Competitiveness Diamond 
methodology by M. Porter).

Sector-focus diagnostic (Competitive Industries Initiative) (continued)

The analysis and subsequent policy recommendations were developed based on structured public private dialogue (PPD) where key 
actors in each sector (circa 120 in all four sectors) are invited to participate to the diagnostic, the elaboration of a concrete action plan, and the 
implementation thereof. The PPD is nurtured by technical analysis notes by the World Bank and external consultants. 
Conclusions of the Diagnostics phase
The objective of the diagnostics phase was to prioritize constraints to competitiveness and growth base on their severity (through PPD). Three 
categories of constraints were finally identified: a) economy-wide, or “horizontal,” constraints that weigh in heavily on the analyzed sectors 
(or most); b) “vertical” constraints that are common to studied sectors/clusters but that can only be effectively tackled through sector/cluster-
specific reforms and actions; and c) “vertical” constraints that are cluster/sector specific. 
The most prominent examples of economy wide constraints that are particularly binding in the analyzed sectors include: i) Severe lack of 
access to finance, particularly for working capital; ii) low implementation capacity of the government and administrations; iii) the ramifications 
of the onshore/offshore regime, that prevent the development of competitive value chains in Tunisia by complicating B-2-B exchanges between 
offshore firms, or between onshore and offshore firms; iv) low level of soft, cognitive, and behavioral skills due to a decaying basic education 
system; and v) the bottleneck that the Rades Port has become, hindering flexibility and reactivity to the market.
The following chart illustrates some of the “vertical” constraints, common to various sectors or specific to any, in terms of their relation to the 
economy wide constraints identified in the SCD. 

Sector Note on Tourism in Tunisia131 

Tourism is important for jobs and foreign exchange earnings in Tunisia. The sector directly employs 

over 400,000 people across the value chain of 230,000 hotel rooms and roughly 190 tour operators and 
travel agents. An additional estimated 300,000–400,000 are employed in a range of ancillary and support-
ing services such as restaurants and bars, taxis, and a range of retail outlets, such as tourist bazaars, linked to 
the tourism sector. This value chain is a lifeline in many parts of Tunisia. The sector accounts for six to seven 
percent of GDP and about 15 percent of foreign-currency earnings. In 2012, headline indicators showed signs 
of gradual improvement although data from the World Trade Organization indicated that the rebound was 
overstated and affluence of tourists remained well below pre-revolution levels. The current situation, follow-
ing the improvement in political and social stability, offers the opportunity to look at the sector’s variety of 
structural problems and seek ways to address them by capitalizing on opportunities. 

Tunisia is a viable and attractive tourist destination, however, the sector is crippled by structural fail-
ures that will limit its future growth and economic potential. First, the sector has for the past four years 

been affected by the unrest following the revolution in january 2011, the continuing political uncertainty 
in the region, and the protracted crisis in the Eurozone. Underlying these externalities are structural failures 
in the sector as a result of its tourism policies and market focus. Tunisia is an example of rapid develop-
ment of a classic mass tourism coastal destination. The core product is “3S” (sun, sand and sea) and over 80 
percent of visitors are Europeans coming on tour operator packages. Tunisian tourism developed remark-
ably rapidly, from just 4000 beds in 1962 to nearly a quarter of a million today, and with over six million 
arrivals in 2014 it is the third most visited destination in Africa (after Egypt and South Africa). Tourism 
development was initiated by the government with a series of incentives for hotel construction, and has 
been implemented mainly by the Tunisian private sector, with substantial support from the banking sector. 
In the eighties and nineties tourism boomed and Tunisia became firmly established as a cheap beach desti-
nation attracting budget tourists, but totally reliant on European tour operators. Cheap credit, incentives,

127

and quick returns to investors fueled an over-supply of mass market beach hotels many of which were built 
by “investors” rather than “hoteliers.” While initial efforts to create a larger hotel offering were successful, 
the sector has remained trapped in a monoculture and monopoly of low added-value 3S package holidays 
catering to middle-income clients in Europe, and more recently in Eastern Europe. Economic benefits, par-
ticularly employment and revenues, have remained low relative to the number of tourists and the number 
of hotel rooms, and quality of service has also remained unsatisfactory due to weak professional training. 
Weak tourism policies have subsidized less qualified investors and made issues with NPLs more widespread 
and chronic, while poorly planned tourism developments have resulted into damages to the environment, 
including on the isle of jerba. 

The opportunity to revitalize the sector can sustain a path to job creation and economic growth. In the 

short term, given the improvement in the security and political situation, the relative cheapness of Tunisian 
package holidays could help to attract cash-strapped visitors from western Europe, in addition to those from 
eastern Europe, notably Russia, Poland, and the Czech Republic. The Open Skies Agreement negotiated with 
the EU can also open up Tunisia to low-cost airlines and help tourism to grow. In the longer term, however, 
Tunisian tourism will continue to perform below its potential unless it overcomes its long-standing structural 
problems. An ambitious action plan is needed to restructure both the debt and underlying assets on a large 
scale (an AMC seems to be the best way to go but political sensitivity is slowing down the reform process). 
This action plan also requires a broad-based legal and regulatory reform of the insolvency regime (a draft 
bankruptcy law is pending Parliament approval). There is also the need to modernize the tourism sector gov-
ernance (in particular the reform of the ONTT, the public agency in charge of tourism sector promotion). 
Furthermore, while diversification and innovation in the tourism business model are quite urgent, also the 
capacity of attracting new capital and management capable of offering higher quality and diversified products 
come at a very high position in the ranking of priorities. 

Sector Note on agribusiness in Tunisia132 

Agribusiness is one of the leading industrial sectors in Tunisia. With about 1,000 private companies it 

contributes to about three percent of GDP and employs more than 70,000 people. Since the beginning of 
the 1990s, the sector has witnessed a fast modernization to respond to the local demand’s needs and the 
growing power of supermarkets, and to resist to the fierce competition of imported products. In this context, 
the PMN (Programme de Mise à Niveau, EU 960 million) has been aiming at lifting up the quality, produc-
tivity, and management’s levels of Tunisian companies with the aim to align their compliance with norms 
and regulations of EU markets. In line with this, Tunisia has also significantly strengthened its expertise in 
the organic agriculture sector in recent years, including by improving synergies with research centers and key 
main players.133 In addition, in recent years an innovative techno-pole dedicated cluster specializing in food 
industry was created in the north of the country.134 The agribusiness sector has benefitted from investment

133 Already, some key players like Danone and Poulina groups have incorporated into their production system innovative biotechno-
logical applications.
134 Examples of benefits of the Investment Code include: 10 years of tax exemption on profits, payment of tax at a reduced rate of 
10 percent from the 11th year for export revenues and agricultural projects, the possibility of the sale on the local market for 30 
percent of sales agricultural export business with payment of the required duties and taxes.

128

incentives135 through the Investment Code. However, a number of constraints have remained and currently 
indicate a risk that will limit progress and growth in the industry.

The key constraints for the agribusiness sector include market failures, artificial market protection, 
underdeveloped production supply and processing capacity, and weak strategic planning for export de-

velopment. Market failures are caused primarily by horizontal segmentation of the subsectors, government-
regulated pricing policies, and frequent state intervention into private sector matters. In turn, horizontal 
segmentation is due to the lack of direct communication within the different actors in a subsector and the 
lack of incentives to communicate important market information. Some artificial market protection has also 
historically been established through import tariffs and quantitative restrictions, the government control of 
some marketing channels, and the dominant market positions of inefficient parastatals. These have combined 
to provide price umbrellas and remove the incentive for many firms to become more efficient and competitive. 
On the supply and processing side, major constraints appear in land supply, technology adoption, working 
capital, packaging, and management capacity. These limit the ability of the Tunisian agribusiness sector to 
exploit potential resources and maximize economic activity. Lastly, there has been weak strategic planning for 
export development at both state and private sector levels.

Opportunities in agribusiness are crucial for Tunisia, particularly with respect to selected products, 

including olive oil, dates, and fresh fruits.136 With 70 million rain-fed olive trees and 1.6 million hectares 
of arboricultural land for olive oil, Tunisia holds the second widest surface in the world (19 percent of global 
surface). Currently, Tunisia produces about 172.000 tons of olive oil per year, with 127.000 tons for exports. 
This subsector offers 20–40 million labor days per year and plays an undeniable ecological role in terms of 
preserving the soil against desertification. The olive oil sector contributes with about 15 percent of the value 
of the final agricultural products and 45 percent of the total agricultural exports. By upgrading drip irrigation, 
soil preservation, and technology of olive oil mills, the sector could increase productivity, while further sup-
port to olive oil production to export packaged and branded products would improve competitiveness, pro-
vide more value added, and increase job creation. Dates production comes at the second place, following olive 
oil, with 16 percent of agribusiness exports. In the country there are about 5.4 million palm trees including: 
about 3.5 million of the more prestigious Deglet Nour variety (65 percent). Every year, some 60,000 Tunisia 
farmers produce about 190.6 thousand tons of dates, about half for exports. The dates subsector provides op-
portunities for job creation and improved export offerings, assuming the size of plantations are improved and 
more integration with value added products (e.g. dates pasta for energy bars) is achieved.

Lastly, Tunisia should further capitalize on its strategic geographical position. Tunisia sends her products 

to about 138 export destinations. Among the major markets and initiators of business ventures remain those of 
the European Union (Italy, France, and Spain). New destinations included the US, Canada, Russia, japan, other 
Middle East countries and Sub-Saharan Africa (Niger, Senegal and Ivory Coast) where agriculture and food 
security remain crucial issues. Latin American countries, particularly Brazil, have recently shown interest in part-
nering with Tunisia, including on cereal production. Other segments deemed strategic could be dairy and meats. 

135 Located in the north, the Competitiveness Cluster of Bizerte houses the Technology AGRO’TECH food, which extends over 45 
ha located precisely in Menzel Abderrahman. The division also 3 higher institutes and one national school engineers. As part of the 
national industry promotion strategy food, it specifically targets 9 sectors considered priority: olive oil, canned fish and seafood, 
cheese, cereals and derivatives, potato and derivatives, wine, fruits and vegetables, and conservation food products. Furthermore, 
the pole also has an industrial space 112 ha for the sale. To date, the network has 30 partners AGRO’TECH (23 Tunisians and 7 
foreigners) and a core of industrial consists of over 100 companies. The goal is to leverage both national partners continually foreign.
136 IFC has available data on olive oil and dates. Fresh fruit needs further research.

Sector Note on Healthcare in Tunisia

Over the past six years, spending for health care in Tunisia has grown, due to increasing public spending, 

particularly with respect to public health insurance through the Caisse National d’Assurance Maladie (CNAM), 
which patients use to pay for both public and private sector services. This led to a reduction in out-of-pocket 
spending as well as improved affordability and access to health care. At $2.8 billion, total healthcare spending is 
currently at 5.7 percent of GDP, up from 5.3 percent in 2008, half of which is sustained directly by the private 
sector. Over time however, the public sector capacity has remained almost flat in concomitance with a period of 
major political change in the country and in the administration of government, which caused a lot of delays the 
public sector. In parallel, private sector capacity has continued to expand, including with respect to infrastruc-
ture. In addition, Tunisia has more developed health care services than either of its big neighbors, Libya and Alge-
ria, and private Tunisian clinics and other health providers have been experiencing a rising number of Libyan and 
Algerian patients, including an estimated half million or more Libyans who now reside permanently in Tunisia.

Despite good opportunities for growth, the health care sector has been facing key challenges. The shortage of 

construction materials and lack of qualified labor has led to price inflation and project delays in the whole coun-
try. Protracted periods of protest and civil unrest, more lucrative post-conflict reconstruction in Libya, as well as 
significant migration of Libyans to Tunisia have contributed to a slow down of the pace of construction of health 
care facilities. Futhermore the sector has suffered from an increased complexity of regulatory environment and 
delays in decisions for licenses and construction permits, due to the turnover in the political and administrative 
arms of government, and less experienced civil servants. Additionally, the regulations put in place by the Ministry 
of Health during 2011–13 have posed further constraints to private sector health development, by limiting the 
acquisition of important medical equipment, including PET/CT scanners, a type of latest-generation medical 
imaging used mostly for cancer diagnosis and treatment.137 Nonetheless, private sector health service capacity has 
been expanding to meet the demand, which has continued to outstrip supply in both public and private sectors. 
This expansion, however, took place for the most part in Tunis and a few other cities, including Beja and Monastir.

Despite the challenges in the health sector, Tunisian private health care is expected to continue to grow 

and increasingly become a valuable partner to the public health care system. Current trends show that the pri-
vate sector has been expanding its role of health care “provider” by making substantial investments in health 
care infrastructure, while the public system has been expanding its role of health care “purchaser.” Although 
the current regulation climate is less favorable to private healthcare than it was prior to the events of 2011, 
recent changes in the Government of Tunisia are expected to bring about policy shifts in favor of the private 
sector. The expansion of private health care in Tunisia could also benefit from health tourism. Tunisia already 
receives significant numbers of patients from Algeria and Libya due to having more developed health services. 
Tunisia also receives some patients from francophone Sub-Saharan Africa. A smaller proportion of health 
tourists also come from Europe (mainly France and Italy) for cosmetic surgery. This is in keeping with health 
tourism trends in many other countries that receive such patients: the majority, over 80 percent typically, 
travel to seek better care than is available where they live and a smaller group seeks lower cost care. Thanks to 
its strategic geographic position and its African location and proximity to Europe, with educated professionals 
and private clinics, Tunisia has potential to grow as a regional destination for health care and health tourism, 
contributing to growth of the Tunisian economy. 

137 PET/CT licenses have been reserved for the public sector, but the public sector doesn’t have the funds to buy the equipment, so 
Tunisia simply has no PET/CT, resulting in lower treatment quality for patients. Several private players would be willing to make 
the investment if the government would permit them.

Annex v: A historical Perspective on the 
Political Economy of reforms

To a great extent, the period after the country’s independence in 1956 can be divided in three 

stages: (i) the post-independence time under President Bourguiba through 1987; (ii) Ben Ali era 
from 1987 to 2011 and (ii) the 2011 onwards post-Arab Spring time, with a new Constitution and 
a renewed social dialogue.

post-independence until 1987

bourguiba and the Concentration of State Power

A leader of the anti-colonial movement and first president of an independent Tunisia, Bourguiba is 
often remembered for his secular and progressive reforms. However, it is also during these years that 

the high level of state intervention was carved. Bourguiba’s earliest policies focused on female emancipa-
tion, public education, family planning, a modern, state-run healthcare system, and a national campaign to 
improve literacy. yet over his 30-year rule, Bourguiba also oversaw the steady concentration of political power 
and decision-making. In 1963, all political parties other than his Neo-Destour Party were outlawed, and in 
1975 the Tunisian National Assembly voted Bourguiba president for life. 

Along with the concentration of decision-making, the centrally driven development model meant a 
high level of state intervention in all aspects of the economy. At independence in 1956, Tunisia lacked 

the basic elements of a functioning economy. Bourguiba embarked on a project to build the country’s in-
frastructure and create the administrative and financial institutions of a modern state. One of the priorities 
was to move the economy away from reliance on natural resources, agriculture and mining, toward industry 
and manufacturing. In line with his secular outlook, and to undermine any potential rival center of power, 
Bourguiba also nationalized various religious land holdings and dismantled several religious institutions. State 
banks, a general insurance company, as well as a variety of state run companies were established in commerce, 
transportation, mining and all other major sectors. These efforts produced significant achievements, despite 
a difficult external environment, but resulted in the public sector controlling large segments of the economy 
and preventing the emergence of the private sector.

131

132

Economic l iberalization (1970–1980) followed by an Economic Standstill (1980–1987)

Following the failure of a five-year experiment with a socialist economic model, and the threat of social 
unrest, Bourguiba changed course and became one of the Arab world’s earliest proponents of economic 

liberalism. The main steps of the economic program include the introduction of the Investment Code, 
which, despite amendments is still the framework currently in place. It offered major financial incentives and 
tax relief for foreign investors and the initial privatization of some state owned enterprises. While the program 
delivered results in both growth and job creation, family members and business partners of the regime ap-
peared to enjoy a disproportionate share of the profits. This link between government and business, and the 
extraction of profits by privileged insiders, became a pattern in the process of liberalization later reached an 
even much larger scale under the successor Ben Ali regime.

The push to open up the economy was undermined by the fact that the government continued to exer-
cise extensive control and key sectors were still heavily restricted. As continues to this day, prices were still 

largely administered, the financial sector entirely managed by the government and the most lucrative parts 
of the economy protected by very high custom taxes and import restrictions. Further, the new, flourishing 
export-oriented enterprises were concentrated in a small number of regions, thus increasing regional dispari-
ties and encouraging urbanization and migration to the Tunisian North-East. By the mid-70s, the liberaliza-
tion program met with resistance from the trade unions, with the main trade union, UGTT, demanding job 
guarantees and salary adjustments. This led to a general strike in 1978, which the government was successful 
in breaking down, though at the cost of growing political repression and autocratic drift.

By 1980, Tunisia faced the dual challenge of an economic slowdown coupled with internal instabil-

ity, and looked for foreign support as a remedy. Tunisia was deeply in need of investment finance as the 
three different income resources of the 1970s, namely domestic oil revenues, labor remittances, and foreign 
borrowing withered. In a sign of how dependent Tunisia was on remittances, and in turn how vulnerable to 
external actions, the sudden decision by Libya to expel tens of thousands of Tunisian workers in 1985 pushed 
the country into further socio-economic instability. The rise of the “Movement of the Islamic Tendency,” 
(currently Ennahdha), inspired by the Iranian revolution and the Egyptian Muslim brotherhood presented 
yet another challenge. Tunisia stood at the brink of a political and economic crisis. The country turned to the 
IMF for support, but much like today the economy was in urgent need of restructuring, with the dominant 
social forces unwilling to initiate changes that might affect their privileges and diminish their political control.

The implementation of the structural adjustment program in late 1980s represents a turning point 
in economic policymaking in Tunisia since its independence. This program was aimed at: (i) preserving 

the stability of the macroeconomic framework and financial balances, (ii) integrating Tunisia into the world 
economy, (iii) redistributing income by reconciling social and economic policies; and (iv) reducing poverty 
and broadening the “middle class” group. The reforms were expected to boost economic growth that would 
trickle down to the population, in order to improve income levels and employment.

Box AV.1: Social policy under Ben Ali as a regime’s tool for cementing legitimacy and control

A common feature of Tunisia’s development model under Ben Ali was the strong commitment to social spending. The level of public 
expenditure for social policies remained consistently high, at around 19 percent in 1987–2005 (Ben Romdhane, 2007). In particular, spending 
on education and health doubled during the 1986–2002 period, while expenditure on social welfare increased by 214 percent. Where 
necessary, reductions in social spending on food subsidies (by 52 percent over 1986–2002) were compensated by increases in the minimum 
wage (ibid.). In addition to the National Programme for Aid to Needy Families created in 1986 to help the poor, Ben Ali also established two 
social programs, the National Solidarity Fund, also known as: 26-26: (1992) and the National Employment Fund, dubbed: 21-21: (2000), to 
improve basic infrastructure in deprived areas and promote employment opportunities. The population coverage of social security also saw 
remarkable progress over the years, being among the broadest in the Arab world (approximately 85 percent of the population).
While improving Tunisians’ welfare, social policy was, first and foremost, an instrument of power and control in the hands of the regime 
(Hibou, 2006; Ben Romdhane, 2007, Paciello 2011). The ruling party itself directly approved the list of families that benefited from state social 
services, using the generous social policies to compensate for the lack of civil and political liberties. Social policy thus served to discourage 
the emergence of a democratic order insofar as most Tunisians were willing to accept the lack of political freedom as the price to pay for 
socio-economic development and welfare (Ben Romdhane, 2007). Through the massive reduction of income poverty, the regime was also able 
to reduce the risk of social tensions, eventually inhibiting the chances for Islamists to gain terrain in poorer areas (Harrigan & el-Said, 2009). 
However, during Ben Ali’s ruling, many of the resources that were originally designed to improve people’s welfare, as the above mentioned 
funds, went unaccounted for and were distributed through clientelist networks (Kallander, 2011) by the ruling party (RCD)

seize power, Ben Ali at first introduced a limited political opening, allowing other parties to compete in elec-
tions. This opening however was quickly reversed, after the presumed electoral success of Ennahdha in 1989. 
This prompted a repressive campaign against the Islamist party.138 Ben Ali’s success in suppressing Islamists, 
along with his pro-western foreign policy, has moderated Western criticism of what some have characterized 
as Tunisia’s slow pace in improving democratic practices. The positive image conveyed by Ben Ali ensured 
a stable increase in GDP growth through trade relations with the European Union,139 a revitalized tourism 
industry, and sustained agricultural production. For a time, many of the country’s political forces were aligned 
with Ben Ali’s project, as they welcomed the economic revitalization.

The Constitution, a New Social Dialogue and political Trends

Process Toward a New Constitution 

Following a period of social and political instability immediately after the revolution, the compromise 
and consensus enshrined in the Social Agreement—Pacte social—paved the way for the drafting of the 

new constitution. The launch of a Social Dialogue and the signing of the Social Pact in 2013 between the 
Ennahdha-led government, the parliamentary opposition, mediated by the Labor Union (UGTT) and the 
Tunisian Trade, Industry and Handicrafts Union (UTICA), which committed the different political factions 
to work together in a Unity Government for the socio-economic reforms and transformation needed to guar-
antee peace and stability for the period 2012–2014. The pact covers industrial relations and social protection, 

138 This campaign forced their leader, Rached Ghannouchi to flee overseas.
139 A key pillar of Ben Ali reforms program had been the integration of the Tunisian economy into the world economy, together with 
action to reinforce competitiveness. The liberalization program saw an important step with the country’s accession to the WTO in 
1995 and the implementation of a number of free trade agreements (FTAs) with main partners. The association agreement with 
the European Union (EU), which began to be fully implemented in 2008, represents the major trade agreement signed by Tunisia. 
In parallel, a host of programs and economic policy actions aiming at reinforcing competitiveness were committed during the 
same period. They sought the consolidation of tax and financial legislations reforms; more deregulation of investments, trade and 
prices; rebalancing of the roles of the public and private sectors; modernization in the administration of the financial and banking 
systems; improvements in infrastructure; and development of human resources and upgrading of firms and production sectors.

Box AV.2: Achievements under the new Constitution

While Tunisia’s new constitution names Islam as the country’s religion, it guarantees freedom of worship, a secular rule of law, 
confirms women parity in political bodies, and lists a number of rights including that of access to information. Its main achievement 
is its social orientation, the broad scope of political, personal, social, human and civil rights and the regulation of the relationships between 
government branches. Particular attention is paid to preserving and further guaranteeing women’s rights, and the equality of female and 
male citizens is proclaimed in Article 21. The Tunisian constitution also affirms Tunisia is a “civil state,” confirms the right to conscious and 
limits the parliament in restricting freedoms and fundamental rights, especially through the newly created constitutional court (Article118). 
In view of the former authoritarian regime, Article 32 asserts “The state shall guarantee the right to information and the right to access to 
information…” Tunisian civil society, with the support of international institutions, strived to ensure access to information was recognized as 
a prerequisite for transparency and accountability of the government, allowing citizens to make informed choices, and safeguarding them 
against mismanagement and corruption.
Also, the inscription of Chapter Six in the constitution is an effort to further guarantee the check and balance processes. The five 
Independent Constitutional Committees (Articles 125–130): independent regulation bodies for the elections; media; human rights; sustainable 
development and rights of future generations; and good governance and anti-corruption not only secures a number of rights and freedoms 
that were, for the mot part, flouted since independence, but also results in the President of the country not holding office for more than two 
five-year terms (Article 75). The article also states “The number and duration of Presidential terms may not be amended or increased.” 

employment and vocational training policy, and underlines the importance of social dialogue as a genuine 
pillar of a democratic transition toward greater social justice.140 The general agreement is that the constitution 
represents a compromise between all political fronts.141 Extensive deliberations were held especially around 
the topics related to the national identity of the country, the place of Islam, the definition of rights and free-
doms, and the equality between men and women. It took more than two years to complete every article of the 
new constitution. Civil society (including trade and business unions) was very vigilant and influential during 
the drafting process. Over 6,000 citizens, 300 civil society organizations, and 320 university representatives 
provided input to a nationwide dialogue on the constitution. The document was approved, in the end, by an 
overwhelming 200 of Tunisia’s 216-member NCA. The finalization of the constitution has established and 
created a space for “public debate” that has not previously existed in Tunisia.

Tunisia’s Present Political landscape

The recent elections resulted in a politically heterogeneous government, but also clear economic and 

social priorities and agenda. Nida Tounes won the largest number of votes in both the parliamentary and 
presidential elections of 2014. It was not a decisive victory, however, as Ennahdha retained significant pockets 
of support in the center and south of the country. Nida Tounes ended up with a majority in the parliament, 
with 86 seats as opposed to Ennahdha’s 69, and the control of the presidency and the right to nominate the 
new prime minister. In the formation of the new government, the lack of a clear majority forced Nida Tounes 
to seek a consensus among the other parties. The new prime minister was a consensus figure and the rest of 
the cabinet is drawn from a range of political parties to ensure a parliamentary majority. On economic themes, 
there is strong coherence among the different parties on reforms and the best model for Tunisia. yet the politi-
cal heterogeneity of the new government was the source of some controversy, especially around the inclusion 
of Ennahdha, as one of the primary organizing principles of Nida Tounes was its opposition to the Islamist

141 Essentially between Ennahdha, who had a total of 85 seats out of 217 within the National Constituent Assembly, and the other 
political parties with more secular tendencies.

party. More recently, criticism has quieted in the face of the new government’s unprecedented approach to 
governing. An energetic program has been launched of visiting economically disadvantaged regions, holding 
ministerial meetings in situ and making decisions on concrete actions, and including civil society and media 
as meaningful participants. The focus on addressing priority needs has so far not presented any challenges 
to the delicate political consensus. It remains to be seen if the current unity around immediate actions will 
serve as a solid foundation for the implementation of major reforms. A crisis related to security, another of 
the government’s priorities, and spillovers from the Libyan conflict could exacerbate the still palpable political 
divisions and put a strain on political unity. 

Still empowered by the revolution, and with rights consolidated in the new constitution, citizens con-

tinue to be an active and vocal social force. There is immense expectation on the part of citizens that the 
government will address the many root causes of the revolution. Along with consecrating individual rights, 
the constitution also enumerates a number of government responsibilities, which the new government is striv-
ing to deliver on. The first actions have been focused on lagging regions. The prime minister is visible through-
out the country at present, and his visits on the whole have been welcome. This sets the stage for rebuilding 
the trust between citizens and the state. Ministerial meetings have identified and agreed upon specific actions 
for the development of each locality visited. Social stability will depend critically on the ability of the current 
government to listen to and communicate with citizens and to ensure that any action taken on the identified 
priorities is recognized by the population as a step forward toward a more inclusive development model.

Annex vi: The Social Progress initiative

The Social Progress Imperative is a non-profit organization that has elaborated an index for social prog-
ress to be used alongside GDP per capita as a key measure of the success of a country. The ultimate 
objective is to inform governments, businesses and civil society organizations by reframing how the 
world measures success-putting the real things that matter to people’s lives at the top of the agenda. The Social 
Progress Index offers a framework for measuring the multiple dimensions of social progress, alongside three 
dimensions: Basic Human Needs, Foundations of Wellbeing, and Opportunity (see figure below).

The first dimension, Basic Human Needs, assesses how well a country provides for its people’s essential needs 
by measuring whether people have enough food to eat and are receiving basic medical care, if they have ac-
cess to safe drinking water, if they have access to adequate housing with basic utilities, and if they are safe 
and secure. Foundations of Wellbeing measures whether a population has access to basic education, ICT 
infrastructure (mobile, internet ideas and information from both inside and outside their own country), and 
if they have more than basic healthcare and can live healthy lives. This dimension also measures a country’s 
protection of air, water, and land, resources critical for current and future wellbeing. The final dimension, 
Opportunity, measures the degree to which a country’s population is free of restrictions on its rights and its 
people are able to make their own personal decisions, and whether prejudices or hostilities within a society 
prohibit individuals from reaching their potential. This dimension also includes the degree to which advanced 
education is accessible to all those in a country who wish to further their knowledge and skills. Advanced 
education unlocks almost unlimited personal opportunity. The Social Progress Index framework is that it 
integrates Opportunity, an aspect of human wellbeing that is often ignored or kept separate from more foun-
dational and material needs such as nutrition and healthcare, into the definition of social progress. Together, 
this framework aims to capture an interrelated set of factors that combine to produce a given level of social 
progress. Social Progress Index scores at the overall, dimension, and component levels are all based on a 0–100 
scale. This scale is determined by identifying the best and worst global performance on each indicator by any 
country in the last 10 years, using these to set the maximum (100) and minimum (0) bounds

The Social Progress Index measures and benchmarks Tunisia with respect to other countries in the world. 
From this index and its sub-components, it shows how Tunisia has scored relatively low with respect to its 
income-peers in terms of social progress (scoring less than 44 out of 100 and ranking 90th out of 132 coun-
tries). This is due mostly to the lack of opportunities (defined as access to higher education, tolerance, inclu-
sion) and personal freedom. While basic needs have been fulfilled, access to basic services continues to be 
under-achieved.
