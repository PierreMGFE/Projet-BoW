Under its new approach to working with its country partners, the 
World Bank Group (WBG) requires the preparation of a Systematic 
Country Diagnostic (SCD) to precede the development of 
Country Partnership Frameworks which guide programming. 
The objective of an SCD is to identify the most critical constraints 
and opportunities facing a country in accelerating progress 
toward the goals of ending extreme poverty and promoting 
shared prosperity in a sustainable manner. The SCD is expected 
to produce an objective, evidence-based, candid assessment 
of the main challenges facing the country, without limitation to 
the areas where the WBG is currently engaged.

The World Bank Group would like to thank the Government of Maldives, in particular staff at the 
Ministry of Finance and Treasury, for their hospitality and feedback during the preparation of 
this document. Similarly the World Bank would like to thank participants from  the Ministry of 
Fisheries and Agriculture, the Ministry of Tourism and the Maldives Monetary Authority, youth 
groups, Civil Society Organizations, Non-Governmental Organizations, student bodies, academia, 
the private sector and development partners for candidly sharing their perspectives during the 
SCD consultations. The SCD relied on analytical work produced by the World Bank Group, the 
Government of Maldives and other development partners and civil society organizations.

The team was led by Emanuel Salinas (Program Leader, Trade & Competitiveness), Ralph Van 
Doorn (Senior Economist) and Silvia Redaelli (Senior Economist). The team received guidance 
from Francoise Clottes (World Bank Country Director) and Adam Sack (IFC Country Manager). 
Andrea Gallina and Hafiz Zainudeen coordinated consultations with stakeholders in Maldives. The 
peer reviewers were Gabriela Inchauste, Rafael Munoz, and Raju Singh.

The team was further composed of the staff across the World Bank Group’s Global Practices,

Maldives Systematic Country DiagnosticdaTa disClaiMer

The systematic analysis of opportunities and obstacles for poverty reduction and shared prosperity in 
Maldives is limited by shortcomings in official statistics. The lack of consistent and comprehensive data on 
micro and macro-economic aspects in Maldives has been identified as a significant obstacle for evidence-
based policymaking and policy advice. 

Understanding of poverty issues in Maldives is limited by shortcomings in the current poverty measurement 
framework and by data quality and comparability constraints. The latest available household survey data to 
assess evolution of poverty was conducted in 2009-10; differences in survey instruments and possibly in data 
quality limit ability to profile the evolution of poverty. 

Due to the open nature of the economy and capacity constraints, macroeconomic, balance of payments and 
fiscal data are not always accurate. In particular, it has been suggested that the size of the tourism sector, 
even after recent revisions, is still underestimated. On the other hand, the official fiscal expenditure may be 
underreported. 

The analysis of the real sector trends is constrained by lack of information on industries composition and 
out-of-date enterprise surveys. Lack of recent reliable labor force data, especially within the tourism sector, 
limits potential for analysis of youth labor market challenges. Similarly, data on role, size, management and 
fiscal risk of SOEs is not publicly available. 

In undertaking this diagnostic, the team has aimed at complementing official sources of data with information 
from stakeholders gathered through surveys, focus groups and consultations. The team acknowledges the 
limitations in these approaches and thus data stemming from these exercises is duly identified throughout 
the document and used only as means of identification of main issues, rather than as a basis for conclusive 
assessment of policies.

Data and knowledge gaps are identified in the relevant sections of the document.

Maldives is an island nation scattered in the Indian Ocean comprising 1,190 small coral islands 
of which 190 are inhabited by a local population of 341,000. Maldives’ unique archipelagic coral 
island provides the country with an extremely rich and diverse marine ecological system. With 
more territorial sea than land, marine resources have played a vital role shaping the contours of 
economic development, with nature-based tourism being the key driver of economic growth and 
fisheries an important sector of employment for the local population. 

Maldives developed a successful high-end tourism sector, whose sizable rents have been 
redistributed to the population to address its development challenges. Gross Domestic Product 
(GDP) per capita increased from $275 in 1980 to $6,666 in 2013. This growth rate, which averaged 
7 percent between 2002 and 2013, is mainly driven by tourism and non-tradable tourism-
related activities. This impressive track record of economic growth has been supported by capital 
accumulation through investment in resorts, and by an increase in the labor force mainly benefiting 
foreign workers. Fiscal revenues generated in the tourism sector have been used to address some 
of the structural development challenges of Maldives’ economy. 

However, Maldives’ development model has not been sufficiently inclusive and its immediate 
fiscal, environmental and social sustainability is at stake. Although this economic model based 
on tourism-led growth and redistribution of tourism-generated revenues has contributed to 
improving well-being of Maldivian population, poverty reduction has been below potential and the 
level of inequality – and lack of shared prosperity – remain a major challenge. Moreover, recent 
political and socio-economic developments have brought to evidence the inherent vulnerability of 
Maldives’ development model and raise immediate concerns about its fiscal, environmental and 
social sustainability.

This Systematic Country Diagnostic for Maldives aims at identifying the most critical constraints 
and opportunities facing the country as it works towards promoting sustainable growth, reducing 
poverty and boosting shared prosperity. In addition to serving as a public good for the government, 
civil society, research and academic community, and local and international development partners, 
the findings of the SCD will be used as key inputs in the preparation of the WBG strategy, the 
Country Partnership Framework, which will outline how the Bank Group’s engagement in Maldives 
can best contribute towards achieving the twin goals. 

GrowTH and redisTribUTion

Bound by structural constraints and endowed with extraordinary natural assets Maldives developed 
a high-end tourism sector, which has resulted in a very high pace of economic growth over the 
past three decades. However, its form of tourism-led growth has followed an enclave model, reliant 
on imported goods, labor and finance. While tourism accounts for about a third of the country’s 
GDP, it only contributes to 16 percent of the employment in the country. Linkages between 
resorts and local economy are similarly limited, with very few products and services supplied by 
local enterprises. The employment of Maldivian women in the tourism industry faces particular

obstacles. Apart from tourism and fisheries, which is a large employment and export revenue 
generator, there are few sizable economic activities in the country.

The development of the tourism sector in Maldives has created sizable rents, which, through 
taxation and other fiscal means, have been used to address some of the structural development 
challenges of Maldives’ economy. In particular, tourism revenues have been used to support job 
creation in the public sector, to finance the provision of public services and expand access to 
primary health and education facilities beyond the capital area Malé. They also have helped insulate 
the local economy from international price fluctuations through a system of universal subsidies 
on food. The new constitution introducing democracy in the late 2000s has been accompanied 
by an increase in the level of redistribution: (i) the introduction of explicit electricity subsidies; 
(ii) the introduction of a universal health insurance scheme; and (iii) an increase in coverage and 
generosity of pension system. 

PoverTY redUCTion and sHared ProsPeriTY

Poverty incidence in Maldives is substantially in line with that of an upper middle-income country. 
According to the latest available Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES) collected in 
2009/10, the share of population living with less than $1.25 in 2005 PPP a day was 4.9 percent, 
whereas the corresponding share using the $2 a day poverty line was 17.02 percent. These figures 
are very similar to the average poverty outcomes of upper middle-income countries (UMIC), two 
of the small Pacific islands, and neighboring Sri Lanka. Maldives performs better than the other 
countries in South Asia with respect to several socio-economic indicators. Maldives ranks first in 
terms of per-capita GDP and second only to Sri Lanka based on the Human Development Index 
ranking.

Over the seven years between 2003 and 2010, poverty declined nationwide but not uniformly 
across Maldives’ territory. Poverty declined in the Atolls while it remained stable in the capital area 
Malé. The poverty rate is the highest in the Central North and Southern atolls, while the capital area 
Malé is home to the largest share of poor individuals. Sustained migration from the atolls to the 
capital accounts for most of the diverging poverty trends at the subnational level. 

Despite progress, the pace of poverty reduction has been below potential when considering the 
fast GDP growth of the Maldivian economy between 2003 and 2010 due to growing inequality. 
The growth elasticity of poverty reduction (GEPR) in Maldives of about 1.2 percent is relatively low 
by international standards. This is evident in comparison to other countries. For example, while 
Maldives and Sri Lanka shared the same growth rate (approximately 4.8 percent a year over the 
period), poverty reduction in Maldives was one-third less than experienced in Sri Lanka.1  Given the 
slow pace of poverty reduction, Maldives will be able to reduce extreme poverty under 1 percent

by 2040, a much longer period than upper middle-income countries, and other countries in South 
Asia. The lack of shared prosperity in Maldives is the main determinant of the limited impact of 
growth on poverty reduction. The unequal impact of growth is further reflected by an increase in 
the gap between the poorest and richest segments of the population.

Limited jobs opportunities, especially for low-skilled labor might have played an important role in 
limiting contribution of growth to poverty reduction. In particular, the lack of growth in fisheries 
is an important determinant of the limited contribution of growth to poverty reduction, especially 
in the Atolls. As labor income is the main source of household income for the poor, an inclusive 
development of the labor market is key for reducing poverty and boosting shared prosperity.

sUsTainabiliTY

Recent socio-economic and political developments have raised concerns regarding the fiscal, 
political, social and environmental sustainability of Maldives’ development model.

Macro and fiscal sustainability

Maldives is highly vulnerable to shocks due to its small size, lack of economic diversification outside 
tourism and heavy reliance on imports, while its rigid budget adds more risk. Especially in recent 
years, the development model has led to an increasing share of revenue dependent on tourism, 
while an increasing share of expenditure has become “rigid.” The lack of macro policy buffers 
leaves the country with few instruments to stabilize the economy in the event of a downturn in 
tourism.

Unless adjustments are made to revenues and expenditures, the current development model 
raises immediate fiscal sustainability concerns. At current trends it is projected to lead to 
ever increasing levels of public debt and interest payments, even after the fiscal consolidation 
measures budgeted in 2015. The widening fiscal deficit has forced the country to accumulate 
more and more domestic debt at ever higher interest rates. Weaknesses in the Public Financial 
Management system and management of State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) pose further short-
term risks to fiscal sustainability.

Political and institutional risks

As Maldives’ transition to a democratic system is still in progress, powers and relationships among 
democratic institutions remain to be settled. Institutional and political uncertainty constrain the 
sustainability of Maldives’ development model moving forward. 

social sustainability and vulnerability

Economic opportunities in Maldives are out of sync with growth and shared prosperity. The interplay 
of socio-demographic trends and fiscal constraints adds to the social sustainability challenge of 
Maldives’ development model. Particularly vulnerable to these challenges are youth and women. 

The unequal impact 
of growth is further 
reflected by an 
increase in the gap 
between the poorest 
and richest segments 
of the population.

Limited education 
opportunities and

challenge the 
capacity of the 
youth to realize their 
aspirations.

Climate change 
could cause annual 
economic losses 
of more than 12 
percent of Maldives’ 
GDP by 2100.

One of the 
most pressing 
issues relate to 
shortcomings in 
the management of 
natural resources, 
particularly with 
regard to sewage 
and solid waste 
management.

A growing gap between aspirations and opportunities for socio-economic inclusion contributed 
to fostering disenfranchisement among Maldivian youth. Limited education opportunities and 
skill endowments challenge youth capacity to realize their aspirations though a productive labor 
market engagement. High levels of actual and perceived inequality coupled with a progressive 
deterioration of the social contract further contribute to widening youth aspiration gap. State and 
familial structures combine to create a situation where youth and their families do not have the 
incentive to temper youth aspirations, gain skills or search for jobs, feeding into young people’s 
limited productive engagement with the economy and society. Social ills such as gang violence and 
drug abuse are on the rise, and further contribute to strengthening the exclusion of “youth at risk” 
from the social fabric. Moreover, a growing support of more conservative religious practices among 
the youth and negative perceptions towards the tourism industry challenge the inclusiveness and 
social sustainability of Maldives’ development model.

environMental vulnerability and sustainability issues

Climate change is major threat in the long run. Climate change could cause annual economic losses 
of more than 12 percent of Maldives’ GDP by 2100. Due to rising sea levels, the entire country could 
be submerged before the end of the century as 80 percent of land is less than one meter above 
sea level. With 42 percent of the population and more than 70 percent of critical infrastructure 
within 100 meters of shoreline, this would have dire social and economic consequences, notably 
for the poorer and most vulnerable. 

There are also short-term threats to environment sustainability. The most pressing issues relate 
to shortcomings in the management of natural resources, particularly with regard to sewage and 
solid waste management. There is also a growing demand for ground water and rain water as source 
of fresh water, which are at high risk due to climate change and are vulnerable to shocks due to 
the lack of back-up arrangements. Loss of coral reef due to rising sea temperatures, pollution and 
damage represents a threat to the sustainability of the tourism industry and fisheries, and is also 
compounding the effects of climate change. Meanwhile, the institutional capacity for managing the 
country’s natural resources is relatively weak. The cost of electricity generation through imported 
diesel in Maldives is the highest in South Asia, especially in the atolls, while subsidies have led to 
overconsumption and underinvestment in renewable sources of energy.

oPPorTUniTies for GrowTH

tourisM

Tourism is the most important industry in Maldives, but the linkages with the local economy 
are limited. Although Maldives has managed to position itself as a high-end destination, the 
sustainability of such premium cannot be taken for granted and an increase in the number of 
hotels may lead to lower profitability in the tourism sector. Governance shortcomings in the 
current model for allocation of resort leases may be hampering the development of tourism and 
preventing the country from maximizing benefits and enhancing inclusive growth, while concerns 

11

Maldives Systematic Country DiagnosticExEcutivE summary (contd.)

over the investment climate and political risk may undermine the ability of Maldives to attract 
reputable investors in the future. The industry has developed as an enclave, with limited positive 
spillovers to the local communities. 

A more inclusive industry may hold the key to shared prosperity in the country. Better linkages 
between the resorts and the local enterprises may help to leverage tourism growth for development 
of other tradable sectors. Tourism is a large and rapidly growing source of jobs, but most of them 
are not seized by local population due to a host of factors, including: (1) reservation wage that is 
too high for unskilled jobs; (2) lack of skills for technical and managerial jobs; (3) social norms; 
and (4) lack of adequate transport. A nascent segment of community-based tourism, such as 
locally owned guesthouses, may represent a valuable option for diversification and inclusive growth 
through integration with local communities. Growth in this segment has some limitations and 
risks. There are still unrealized opportunities for linkages between tourism and local providers of 
fish and agriculture products, while opportunities for service-provision linkages are more limited, 
as many resorts already own and operate their support services and ancillary functions.

fisheries

The fisheries sector is a critical contributing sector for the country’s national economy and in 
almost all of the country’s inhabited islands. The sector traditionally provides employment, exports 
and food security. Environmentally friendly fishing methods have enhanced Maldives’ ability to 
access premium markets. Marine aquaculture is nascent in Maldives, supported by government 
pilot aquaculture projects and a private aquaculture farm. This can be an important source of 
economic growth and diversification, poverty alleviation and foreign exchange earnings, but 
the future development of aquaculture is hindered by the limited availability of financing and 
technology and a lack of clarity on the legal and policy framework. 

The sustainability of fisheries is jeopardized by inadequate fisheries management and overfishing. 
The industry is experiencing a declining trend, with both catch and employment falling. Employment 
of women in the downstream fish processing industry has been reduced to practically nil. Maldives 
fisheries sector benefits from high value stocks, but its recent trends highlight vulnerability to 
a mix of factors, including overfishing, higher fuel costs, temperature rise leading to change 
in schools aggregation and lack of more effective regional eco-systemic management of the 
shared skipjack tuna stock. Governance deficiencies (limited number of skipjack tuna processing 
licenses) appear to have hampered the development of fisheries and the value they bring to the 
economy. Overfishing of reef fish and climate change present risks to the sustainability of the 
tuna fisheries as well as tourism. Threats to the health of the coral reefs that are significant to the 
fishery sector also come from habitat degradation and loss due to pollution, harbor construction 
and reclamation. 

Better linkages 
between the resorts 
and the local 
enterprises may 
help to leverage 
tourism growth for 
development of other 
tradable sectors.

is high.

essential in order to 
enable the creation 
of inclusive economic 
activities in Maldives.

agriculture

Food security concerns have revitalized the interest in development of the local agriculture 
production. Agriculture is a relatively minor activity in Maldives and has contributed only marginally 
to long-term growth. Potential for agriculture is limited due to the scarcity and dispersion of 
arable land and high cost of fresh water for irrigation, and the country will remain dependent on 
imported food into the future. There are opportunities as well: there may be more potential to cater 
to resorts, growth in agriculture will benefit women who form the majority of employment in the 
sector, other higher-value fruits and vegetables could be tried tested for cultivation, and low-cost 
smallholder greenhouse technologies combined with household based-irrigation/ ‘fertigation’ 
systems could be explored. 

ConsTrainTs

Maldives suffers from the same size and geography challenges as other small island states, 
limiting its production base and competitiveness. As a result of these challenges, the cost of 
providing basic services in a fragmented country is raised across the board. Public expenditure 
in Maldives is structurally high, although Maldives remains an outlier in terms of spending even 
if accounting for its size, insularity and openness, and the duality of its economy. With its small 
population dispersed over many islands across long distances, the country faces the choice 
whether to address the challenge of the high cost of service delivery through consolidation of 
population closer to Malé or through improving services and connectivity to populations at their 
current locations. There has been a steady migration from smaller to larger islands -- in particular 
to the Malé City area -- leading to conditions of overcrowding in Malé, a development successive 
governments have tried to address with limited success. 

The investment climate in Maldives features important constraints for new entrepreneurs and 
for the growth of existing firms. The investment climate in Maldives is much more challenging 
than that of similar island economies and other South Asian countries. Challenges extend beyond 
what is captured by Doing Business rankings (enabling environment for a firm to start operations, 
grow its business and resolve disputes or unwind operations in an orderly, swift and fair manner). 
They include lack of access to foreign currency and sudden changes in the legal and regulatory 
environment taking place in absence of sufficient consultation with private-sector stakeholders. 
Addressing investment climate shortcomings will be essential in order to enable the creation of 
inclusive economic activities in Maldives. 

The uniqueness of Maldives’ natural resources has enabled the country to attract large amounts 
of foreign direct investment (FDI) in spite of shortcomings in the investment climate. However, this 
type of FDI, typically into the development of single-island resorts, has had limited positive spillover 
to the economy. Moreover, recent events, such as civil disturbances in Male and a high-profile 
dispute and costly legal proceedings related to the contract for investment in the international 
airport, have the potential to significantly undermine the confidence of foreign investors on 

13

Maldives. That could reduce its attractiveness as a long-term investment destination in favor of 
jurisdictions that can provide a higher degree of certainty to foreign investors.

Sustainable 
enhancement of 
access to finance in 
Maldives will require 
the development and 
implementation of a 
strategy for financial 
sector development 
that addresses the 
shortcomings faced 
by the sector.

Access to finance has been identified as a major constraint for the development of enterprises 
in Maldives. Financing to the private sector has been lower than the pace of economic growth, 
reflecting a lack of investment opportunities in the local economy. In particular, this has affected 
manufacturing, fisheries and agriculture credit, which has fallen since 2007. High collateralization 
requirements represent major hurdles to borrowers, especially for small and medium enterprises 
and new entrepreneurs. Lack of access to finance has been identified by authorities as a major 
obstacle for entrepreneurship in Maldives, but this challenge will not be resolved through 
concessional credit initiatives. Instead, sustainable enhancement of access to finance in Maldives 
will require the development and implementation of a strategy for financial sector development 
that addresses the shortcomings faced by the sector.

Maldives is facing important governance challenges that affect the business environment and the 
soundness and sustainability of economic and fiscal management. In the public sector, limited 
capacity, a complex institutional framework and inter-institutional conflicts also limit the ability 
of the state to support social and economic progress. Institutional capacity remains much lower 
than that of an average upper middle -income country. A significant amount of procurement in 
the country is carried out by SOEs and the Ministry of Health outside the scope of national rules 
and central government controls, leading to doubts if public resources are spent in the most 
effective and efficient manner. Public-sector management suffers from inefficiencies. The lack 
of settlement in the political and institutional framework impairs the state’s effectiveness, which 
has led in particular to weak rule of law. Governance issues also these extend to the resort tourism 
sector, where a few business groups control a large share of the market. 

Expanding and improving human capital will be of vital importance to promote economic prosperity 
and increase jobs for young people. Maldives has performed well in providing access to primary 
and lower secondary education. However, the country lags sharply behind in education attainment 
at the higher secondary level, while higher education participation is extremely low for a middle-
income country. The quality of education at all levels is a major challenge facing Maldives, both 
in terms of inputs and outcomes. A major challenge is to equip school and university graduates 
with the “soft skills” demanded by employers in the country, the lack of which is linked to high 
youth unemployment. The quality of current Technical and Vocational Education and Training 
(TVET) services needs to be improved so that it becomes both more attractive for youth and more 
relevant for employers. For this, the gap between youth aspirations for employment (white-collar 
jobs) and the actual opportunities for employment (e.g., perceived lower-status jobs) needs to be 
addressed.

The contribution of social spending to poverty reduction and shared prosperity in Maldives 
is declining over time. Recently introduced social insurance schemes have created perverse 
economic incentives that challenge poverty reduction and shared prosperity moving forward. In

particular, universal electricity subsidies disproportionately benefit the richer households, while 
the generosity of the social pension system has exacerbated intergenerational equity issues and 
potentially contributed to increasing distortions on the labor market. (Increasing trends for inter-
generational transfers within the household and increasing reservation wages might challenge 
direct participation of the youth in the growth process.) Moreover, the defined contribution pension 
schemes disadvantage elderly women, given the gender income and wage disparity in Maldives. 

PrioriTizaTion

Based on existing evidence and analysis conducted as part of the Systematic Country Diagnostic, 
The World Bank identified three priority areas to promote growth, poverty reduction and shared 
prosperity in a sustainable way in Maldives. The first is improving opportunities in tourism and 
fisheries for the local population. The second is enhancing the enabling environment, including 
investment climate, access to finance and skills. The third is improving the efficiency and efficacy of 
public resource management and reducing macro fiscal risk. These priority areas were confirmed 
in consultations with local stakeholders and used to further validate hypotheses and analysis. 

Governance issues appear in many of these priority areas as an important cross-cutting constraint. 
Various dimensions of governance constraints can be identified, including lack of transparency in 
tourism, overlapping roles of government agencies in fisheries, incomplete legal and regulatory 
framework hampering the investment climate, weakness of capacity, in particular in natural 
resource management, and deficiencies in the management of SOEs.

Priority area 1: enhancing oPPortunities in tourisM and 
fisheries for the local PoPulation

Given the importance of tourism in Maldives, a more inclusive industry represents a major 
opportunity for shared prosperity going forward. There are four potential complementary avenues 
to improving the inclusiveness of tourism going forward: (1) enhancing the implementation of 
the current resort model; (2) enabling sustainable economic diversification within the tourism 
sector; (3) enabling local employment; and (4) strengthening linkages between tourism and local 
providers of goods and services.

Maldives also has the opportunity to further develop its fisheries sector, and to capitalize on the 
potential benefits to enhance economic growth and sustainable development at a national level. 
As sustainable and inclusive growth of the fisheries sector will likely not be based on increasing the 
volume of catch, a transition to a wealth-based fisheries management system may hold promise 
for the future. There are a range of targeted options for exploiting the opportunities presented to 
Maldives fisheries sector at present, but effective strategies and plans will need to be developed in 
order to identify not only economic potential, but also environmental impact.

Maldives Systematic Country DiagnosticExEcutivE summary (contd.)

Priority area 2. enabling oPPortunities for creation of new 
sources of growth

Economic diversification and competitiveness in Maldives are hampered by significant structural and spatial 
constraints, but improving the enabling environment will enhance the potential for entrepreneurship, creation 
of new firms and growth of existing ones. Maldives faces similar structural challenges of other small island 
states that restrict the extent to which the country can attain competitiveness across the board. However, 
there are visible untapped opportunities where potential (in terms of existing demand and proved production 
capacity) exists, both within value chains of existing industries, as well as potential new economic activities. 

Enabling the local population to seize these opportunities will require addressing a host of factors that 
represent the overall enabling environment in the country. These factors include enhancing the investment 
climate, access to finance and human capital. 

Priority area 3: iMProving the efficiency and efficacy of Public 
resource ManageMent and reducing Macro fiscal risk

The sustainability of Maldives’ development model is dependent on how well the authorities manage the 
country’s wealth-generating natural resources and its financial resources to redistribute this wealth, and how 
resilient the country is to external and domestic shocks. Maldives’ natural resources are its marine life and its 
coral reefs, but there are weaknesses in the exploitation of its natural resources and in its preparedness for 
natural hazards. It appears that a lack of planning capacity at the local and national government level is the 
main constraint to dealing with the challenge of sustainability. 

The main mechanisms to redistribute the wealth generated by tourism are public sector employment, 
social services, subsidies and transfers. The sustainability of the positive outcomes achieved through this 
redistribution system crucially depends on improving its efficiency and cost-effectiveness. The public sector 
employment freeze contributes to managing the wage bills and improving fiscal sustainability, and fiscal 
savings can be used to mitigate the negative impact on employment. While it is important to continue to 
provide wide access to health and education services, more careful planning based on the demographic 
distribution of the population could improve efficiency of spending and free resources to improve quality. 
Targeting reform of electricity and food subsidies could improve efficiency of spending while freeing 
resources to protect the poor. Operational savings in the universal health insurance system Aasandha could 
cut its cost significantly, while preserving the principle of universal health insurance. Finally, there could be 
fiscal savings from improving SOE management and procurement.

Better management of its resources may also make Maldives more resilient to external shocks. Maldives 
will remain exposed to external shocks from tourism under its current development model. While it cannot 
eliminate its vulnerability to shocks Maldives has opportunities to reduce its vulnerability and increase its 
resilience within limits by: (1) reducing exposure to shocks by diversifying its sources of tourism and reducing 
its reliance on fossil fuel; (2) improving international conditions to reduce the domestic transmission of 
shocks by reforming public expenditure and reducing the risk of the public debt portfolio; and (3) increasing 
its risk management through improving institutional quality, including public financing management and 
planning capacity, and increasing policy space. 

Improving 
the enabling 
environment 
will enhance 
the potential for 
entrepreneurship, 
creation of new 
firms and growth of 
existing ones.

The sustainability 
of Maldives’ 
development model 
is dependent on how 
well the authorities 
manage the 
country’s wealth-
generating natural 
resources and its 
financial resources 
to redistribute this 
wealth, and how 
resilient the country 
is to external and 
domestic shocks.

section i : country context

Maldives is an island nation in the Indian Ocean comprising 1,190 small coral islands of which 199 
are inhabited by a local population of 341,000.2 Maldives’ unique archipelagic coral island provides the 
country with an extremely rich and diverse marine ecological system. With more territorial sea than 
land, marine resources have played a vital role shaping the contours of economic development, with 
nature-based tourism being the key driver of economic growth and fisheries an important sector of 
employment for the local population. The population geography in Maldives is strongly polarized. The 
capital Malé, strategically located at the center of the archipelago and served by the first and busiest 
international airport, is the single most populous island of Maldives, with density as high as 53,700 
people per square kilometer3 against an average of approximately 1,900 people per square kilometer 
in the atolls (Figure 1).4

Maldives shares 
many of the Small 
Island Developing 
States development 
challenges. However, 
in the case of 
Maldives, these 
challenges are 
compounded by its 
high geographic 
dispersion with 1,190 
coral islands.

Over the past 30 years, Maldives has successfully built on its extraordinary natural assets to promote 
growth and socio-economic development. Maldives shares many of the Small Island Developing 
States development challenges, such as: a small domestic market; a narrow and fragile resource 
base; a shortage of skilled manpower; difficult inter-island transport and communication; high 
cost of social and economic infrastructure provision; and heavy dependence on external trade 
and vulnerability to external shocks and natural disasters. However, in the case of Maldives, these 
challenges are compounded by its high geographic dispersion with 1,190 coral islands (199 of which 
are inhabited) grouped in 26 atolls, spread over roughly 90,000 square kilometers. Nevertheless, 
the development of a profitable high-end tourism sector has fueled sustained growth rates and 
supported public investments in health and education. In the early 1980s, Maldives was one of the 
world’s 20 poorest countries. Thirty years later, its inhabitants enjoy the same levels of GDP per 
capita and human development outcomes as a middle-income country. 

However, Maldives’ model of economic development has not been inclusive and its future 
sustainability is at stake. Although this economic model based on tourism-led growth and 
redistribution of tourism-generated revenues has contributed to improving well-being of Maldivian 
population, poverty reduction has been below potential and the level of inequality – and lack of 
shared prosperity – remain a major challenge. Moreover, recent political and socio-economic 
developments have brought to evidence the inherent vulnerability of Maldives’ development model 
and raise immediate concerns about its fiscal, environmental and social sustainability.

This Systematic Country Diagnostic for Maldives aims to help identify the most critical constraints 
and opportunities facing the country as it works towards promoting sustainable growth, reducing 
poverty and boosting shared prosperity. In addition to serving as a public good for the government, 
civil society, research and academic community, and local and international development partners, 
the findings of the SCD will be used as key inputs in the preparation of the WBG strategy, the 
Country Partnership Framework, which will outline how the Bank Group’s engagement in Maldives 
can best contribute towards achieving the twin goals.

key Messages
∫ Maldives development model is based on tourism-led growth and redistribution of 
tourism generated revenue
∫ Maldives development model has led to a very high pace of growth
∫ Poverty reduction in Maldives is below potential due to lack of shared prosperity
∫ Public expenditure has increased over past five years
∫ Maldives’ fiscal deficit has been widening leading to high public debt, while its foreign 
exchange reserves are very low

Maldives’ model of socio-economic development relies on tourism-led growth and redistribution 
of tourism-generated revenue (Figure 3). The redistribution of revenue through public service 
delivery is complicated by the geographical dispersion of the archipelago that prevents achieving 
economies of scale, and ultimately leads to question whether this model is sustainable. The 
performance of this development model will be assessed on its ability to: (1) generate growth; 
(2) include as much of the population as possible in the growth process though productive forms 
of employment: and (3) efficiently redistribute resources towards the neediest segment of the 
population to facilitate poverty reduction and shared prosperity.

GrowTH

Bound by structural constraints and endowed with extraordinary natural assets Maldives 
developed a high-end tourism sector, which has resulted in a very high pace of economic growth 
over the past three decades. GDP per capita increased from $275 in 1980 to $6,666 in 2013 
(Figure 4). This growth rate, which averaged 7 percent between 2002 and 2013 is mainly driven 
by tourism and non-tradable tourism-related activities (including construction, transport and 
communications) (Figure 5). This impressive track record of economic growth has been supported 
by capital accumulation through investment in resorts, and by an increase in the labor force mainly 
benefiting foreign workers. 

Economic growth in Maldives has been reliant on the development of tourism, with very limited 
contribution of other economic activities. Tourism accounts directly for around 30 percent of 
nominal GDP,5  and has accounted for about 28 percent of real GDP growth between 2002 and 
2013. Including tourism-related sectors,6 these numbers increase to 64 percent of nominal GDP 
and 65 percent of real growth. There are few other primary industries contributing to economic 
growth, and they are small in relative size. Manufacturing, fisheries and agriculture combined 
accounted for 9.6 percent of GDP in 2013, and private sector-led growth outside of the tourism 
sector has been limited.

But Maldives’ form of tourism-led growth has followed an enclave model, reliant on imported 
goods, labor and finance. Accordingly, while tourism accounts for about a third of the country’s 
GDP, it only contributes to an estimated 16 percent of the employment in the country. Even when 
including sectors that benefit indirectly from tourism employment increases to only 22 percent of 
the total (Figure 35). Linkages between resorts and local economy are similarly limited, with very 
few products and services supplied by local enterprises. Manufacturing firms are small in size and 
lack the quality and reliability demanded by high-end resorts.

The participation of women in tourism jobs has been low. Even when Maldivians are employed, only 
about 30 percent are women, according to data from the 2009/10 HIES. Research suggests that 
social dynamics influence employment decisions such that families are reluctant to allow young 
women to take jobs in the tourism sector because they would have to travel from home to other 
islands and because the tourism sector is associated with “immoral and unethical” practices.7  
A lack of child-care or residential facilities for employed women in the tourism sector further 
exacerbates familial unwillingness to allow young women to work away from home. Women’s 
limited control of transportation means to travel to and from resorts adds another hurdle.8

The tourism industry has contributed to an already large geographical spread of activity. Starting 
in the atolls around the main international airport in Malé (Central North), the tourism sector is 
still largely concentrated around Malé, with 84 percent of resorts within 130 kilometers from Malé 
airport. However, the industry has been slowly taking advantage of advances in transportation 
opening up atolls to the north and south. In fact, the first resort outside this range was opened in 
2005 and there has been a steady increase since. (Figure 6).

Other economic activities also show large geographic dispersion. While public service jobs are 
also concentrated on Malé, with limited spread to the atolls, agricultural production takes place 
mainly in the Central North and Central South regions. For households in the outer atolls, public 
and private transfers are important source of household income (Figure 7).

Note: Transfers include public and private transfers. 

Apart from tourism, there are few sizeable economic activities in the country. Fisheries make 
up the second most prominent industry in the country after tourism, and are the largest goods 
export earner. Maldives benefits from access to high quality fisheries stock, but a large share 
of its value is lost through export of fish as commodities to intermediary markets. As opposed 
to tourism, fisheries accounts for a very small contribution to GDP (1.7 percent) but a larger 
share of employment (10.5 percent).9  Agriculture provides 2.3 percent of GDP and 4.5 percent of 
employment, but it does not export. However, while the economy doubled in size between 2002 
and 2013, fisheries shrunk by 21 percent, and agriculture grew by only 24 percent over that period 
(Figure 8).

role of THe sTaTe and redisTribUTion

The development of the tourism sector in Maldives has created significant sources of revenues 
to the country. Since the nationalization of all land in the country in 1979 and the revocation of 
all permits to operate guesthouses on inhabited islands in 1984, the development of the tourism 
sector in Maldives has been largely dominated by a limited number of local businessmen.10  Barriers 
to entry and capacity controls contributed to limiting competition and diversification of investors, 
but also have increased rents for the state as it has managed to extract increasing fees from 
concessions and lease agreements11  (Figure 9).

Revenues generated in the tourism sectors have been used to address some of the structural 
development challenges of Maldives’ SIDS economy. In particular, tourism revenues have been 
used to support job creation in the public sector,12 to finance the provision of public services and 
expand access to primary health and education facilities beyond the capital area Malé; to provide 
social insurance against financial risks of old age and out-of-pocket health expenditures, as 
well as to insulate the local economy from international price fluctuations through a system of 
universal subsidies on food and energy (Figure 10).

Mihdha (2008).
The tourism sector is taxed directly through the Tourism Tax (or bed-night tax), the Airport Departure Tax, the Goods and Services 
Tax on Tourism (TGST), while tourism also has a significant impact on import duty and Business Profit Tax revenue.  Resort lease 
rent provides a large share of non-tax revenue.
Jobs in the public sector account for 17.3 percent of total employment, while jobs in education, health and social services account 
for 20.5 percent of employment (as of 2010).

* An estimated 20 percent of import duty can be attributed directly to tourism. Business Profit Tax can be attributed to a 
large extent to tourism and related activities.  

The large number of SOEs further contributes to strengthening the role of the state in Maldives’ 
economy. SOEs play a dominant role in many sectors, including trade, fisheries, finance, construction, 
transport, health and utilities. Although their contribution in total fiscal revenue has declined from 19 
percent in 2003 to 4 percent in 2013, thanks to the shift towards new forms of taxation, combined 
revenue of the main three SOEs was still equivalent to 37 percent of GDP in 2013. There are currently 
around 84 SOEs13 , about half of which require active monitoring, whereas 28 have been identified by 
the government for liquidation.14  

The new constitution introducing democracy in the late 2000s has been accompanied by an increase 
in the level of redistribution. In particular, the increase in public spending has been mostly driven by: 

∫ The introduction of explicit electricity subsidies. Due to high costs of domestic electricity production 
and distribution, the country has a long history of subsidized energy prices.15 The current system of 
explicit electricity subsidies was introduced in 2009 in parallel with the reform of electricity tariffs. 
While the electricity tariff reform was meant to curb utility providers’ losses by allowing a cost-
recovering pricing, the contemporaneous introduction of subsidies had the effect of transferring the 
cost of the electricity tariff reform and of any future increase in fuel prices onto the government’s 
budget. Over the last four years, spending on electricity subsidies increased nine times, escalating 
from 0.3 percent of GDP in 2010 to 2.7 percent in 2014 (Figure 11).

15 

Because of complex ownership structures, the number of firms in which the state has a combined direct and indirect stake of at least 
5 percent increases to 92. The state has a control of at least 50 percent in 61 firms, out of which it has 100 percent control of 46.
Draft Aide-Memoire, Maldives Governance of State Owned Enterprises (SOE) mission, World Bank, June 22 - 29, 2014
Due to Maldives’ reliance on imported diesel for electricity generation and inefficiencies in generators’ capacity, the cost of electric-
ity production in Maldives is up to five times as high as in neighboring countries. In particular, electricity production in Maldives is 
2.5, 3.3 and 5 times more expensive than in Pakistan, India and Bangladesh, respectively.

 
 
 
 
∫ The introduction of a universal health insurance scheme. The country’s geography and 
dispersed population, along with its high dependence on imports of medical consumables 
and expatriate manpower, have meant that health services come at substantially higher costs 
when compared with other countries in the region. Maldives spent 9.2 percent of its GDP on 
health in 2011, about half of which came from the government treasury and the rest from 
household sources. Responding to a growing demand for financial assistance to cope with 
out-of-pocket health expenditure, the government introduced a universal health insurance 
system, Aasandha, in January 2012. However, the piecemeal nature of the reform, continuing 
capacity issues within the government and inadequate preparation and planning for these 
reforms have contributed to continuing efficiency, impact and cost challenges. In its first 
year of introduction, the scheme received claims for MVR 943.6 million (corresponding to 2.4 
percent of GDP), well in excess of the amounts approved in the government budget.16  

∫ An increase in coverage and generosity of pension system. The 2009 Pension Act extended 
old-age protection beyond workers employed in the civil sector and mandated the introduction 
of a two-pillar pension system comprising of Maldives Retirement Pension Scheme ( a new 
contributory pension scheme based on a defined contribution model) and the Old Age Basic 
Pension (OABP) (a universal non-contributory pension system for individuals 65 and older). 
While the extension of coverage of the pension system is aimed at closing protection gaps 
between the public and private sector, implementation challenges during the reform and 
the particular generosity of the OABP scheme have contributed to increasing government 
spending.

Maldives spent 9.2 
percent of its GDP on 
health in 2011.

Maldives’ poverty incidence is substantially in line with that of upper middle-income countries. 
According to the latest available HIES, collected in 2009/10, the share of population living with 
less than $1.25 in 2005 PPP a day was 4.9 percent, where the corresponding share using the 
$2 a day poverty line was 17.02 percent. These shares are very similar to the average poverty 
outcomes of UMICs, two of the small Pacific islands, and neighboring Sri Lanka, as shown in Figure 
12. Still, these figures represent that in 2009/10, approximately 48,000 individuals (about one out 
of six Maldivians) were deemed poor, i.e. they were consuming at a level not sufficient to satisfy 
minimum food and non-food needs.

Maldives performs better than the other countries in South Asia with respect to different socio-
economic indicators and gender equality. Compared to other countries in South Asia, Maldives 
ranks first in terms of per-capita GDP and it is second only to Sri Lanka based on the Human 
Development Index ranking (Figure 13, left panel). In 2010, life expectancy at birth was 76.8, three 
years higher than both the average for UMICs and Sri Lanka, the second best of the South Asia

region. Further, Maldives performance is better than the average UMC also with respect to infant 
mortality rate, although it is second to Sri Lanka in the South Asia region (Figure 13, right panel). 
Maldives fares significantly better than many countries when it comes to gender equality, ranking 
49th on the Gender Inequality Index in the 2014 Global Human Development Report of UNDP, in 
comparison with its Human Development Index ranking of 103th. The island nation has the least 
disparities between men and women, when compared with other medium human development 
countries as well as its South Asian neighbors. The country has attained gender parity in primary 
and secondary enrollment, and the number of Maldivian women attaining university degrees is at 
par with that of men.

Over the seven years between 2003 and 2010, Maldives achieved a substantial decline in poverty. 
The poverty headcount based on the national poverty line declined by seven percentage points, 
from 23 percent in 2003 to approximately 16 percent in 2010. Depth and severity of poverty 
declined from 6 to 4 percent and from 2.3 to 1.6 percent, respectively. Similar positive trends are 
observed considering the $2 PPP international poverty line. On the other hand, no statistically 
significant poverty decline is registered when considering the $1.25 PPP international poverty line 
(Figure 14).

Poverty declined in the atolls while remaining stable in the capital area Malé. The decline in poverty 
observed at national level is the result of opposite poverty trends at regional level. In particular, 
while poverty remained substantially stable at around 18 percent in the capital area Malé, it 
declined markedly in the atolls – going from 25 percent in 2003 to 14 percent in 2010. Similar 
patterns are observed using the international poverty lines (see Figure 15).

The poverty rate is the highest in the Central North and Southern atolls, while the capital area Malé 
is home to the largest share of poor individuals. The Central North region of the archipelagos is 
the poorest in both years, with poverty rates of 35 percent in 2003 and 25 percent in 2010. This is 
followed by the Southern region, with 28 percent poor individuals in 2003 and 21 percent in 2010. 
The Central region reduced its poverty rate by more than 80 percent in seven years (see Figure 16).

The pace of poverty 
reduction is below 
potential when 
considering the fast 
GDP growth of the 
Maldivian economy 
between 2003 and 
2010.

Given the slow pace 
of poverty reduction, 
Maldives will be able 
to reduce extreme 
poverty under 1 
percent by 2040, a 
much longer period 
than similar upper 
middle-income 
countries, and other 
countries in South 
Asia.

Sustained migration from the atolls to the capital accounts for most of the diverging poverty trends 
at the subnational level. The seven years between 2003 and 2010 are characterized by substantial 
population movement from the atolls towards the capital area Malé. The share of individuals living in 
Malé increased from 20 percent to 42 percent of the overall population. With only the exception of the 
Central North region, where the population remained stable at around 24 percent, all other regions saw 
a reduction in their population shares, particularly the Central and the Northern regions (Figure 17). 
The pace of poverty reduction is below potential when considering the fast GDP growth of the Maldivian 
economy between 2003 and 2010. The GEPR in Maldives is relatively low by international standards. In 
particular, considering the $2 PPP poverty line, the GEPR in Maldives is about 1.2 percent, meaning that 
for each percent increase in Maldives’ per capita GDP, poverty fell by a mere 1.2 percent. The limited 
contribution of growth to poverty reduction in Maldives is evident when compared to other countries. 
For example, while Maldives and Sri Lanka shared the same growth rate (approximately 4.8 percent 
a year over the period), poverty reduction in Maldives was one-third less than experienced in Sri 
Lanka.17 Even Nepal and Pakistan managed to reduce poverty faster than Maldives, although in these 
two countries GDP growth was, respectively, 2 and 2.5 percentage points lower (Figure 18, left panel). 
Maldives’ limited performance in terms of poverty reduction is even more striking when considering its 
relatively high potential as suggested by the initial level of per capita income. With a per capita GDP of 
$3,360 in 2003, Maldives started with the highest poverty reduction potential of the South Asia region. 
Despite the large income lever that could have helped lift individuals out of poverty, Maldives’ elasticity 
of poverty to GDP growth was significantly lower than countries starting from similar levels of per capita 
GDP, and closer to that of countries with lower levels of per capita GDP such as India or Bangladesh 
(Figure 18, right panel). 

Given the slow pace of poverty reduction, Maldives will be able to reduce extreme poverty under 1 percent 
by 2040, a much longer period than similar upper middle-income countries, and other countries in 
South Asia. If poverty keeps decreasing at the same rate as in the period 2003-2010, Maldives will 
reduce extreme poverty below 1 percent in 30 years, as opposed to only eight years needed to Sri Lanka, 
and more than double the time of the average middle-income country (14 years). Even Pakistan and 
Nepal, which start with much higher poverty rates, will be two years faster than Maldives in defeating 
extreme poverty (see Figure 19).

17 

Poverty decreased at about 0.5 percent per year in Maldives as opposed to 1.6 percent in Sri Lanka.

Note: The figure has been cut at 80 years for better scaling: Bangladesh would need 122 years to fight extreme poverty, 
given current poverty decay.

The lack of shared prosperity in Maldives is the main determinant of the limited impact of growth 
on poverty reduction. Shared prosperity remains a major challenge for Maldives. As shown in 
Figure 20, growth is not equally shared by all sections of the distribution: the bottom 40 percent 
is growing less than average, while people in the upper part of the distribution are growing much 
faster. This un-equalizing impact of growth slowed down poverty reduction. Had all the segments 
of the population benefited equally from growth (i.e. had growth been distribution neutral), poverty 
would have declined by as much as 11 percentage points (Figure 21). 

The unequal impact of growth is further reflected by an increase in the gap between the poorest 
and richest segments of the population. The increase in inequality induced by growth deepened 
the polarization of welfare distribution in Maldives. While inequality as measured by the Gini index 
declined slightly from 39.9 percent in 2003 to 38.6 in 2010, the polarization as measured by 
quintile ratios increased.18 In particular, if in 2003 the poorest individual in the top 10 percent 

18 

The Gini index is more sensitive to capturing changes around the mean of a distribution, and it is therefore poorly suited to captur-
ing polarization and changes around the tails.

of the distribution was consuming four times more than the richest individual in the bottom 10 
percent of the distribution, in 2010 that individual was consuming 5.3 times more. Polarizing 
trends are reflected by the unequal distribution of resources: in 2010, the top 20 percent of the 
population commanded as much as 45 percent of total consumption against only 17 percent of 
the bottom 40 percent.

Limited job opportunities, especially for low-skilled labor, might have played an important role 
in limiting the contribution of growth to poverty reduction. Low education levels, inactivity and 
unemployment are strongly associated with a higher risk of poverty. According to HIES 2009/10 
data, the lower the educational attainment of the household head, the higher is the likelihood that 
the household is poor. About 88 percent of the poor (and 84 percent of those in the bottom 40 
percent) live in households whose head has only completed primary education (see Figure 22). 
Looking at labor market outcomes, Maldivian households whose head is unemployed or inactive 
are on average 1.5 and 1.2 times more likely to be poor than average.

Employment at the lower spectrum of the skill distribution is associated with higher poverty rates. 
In particular, poverty rates are higher when the head of household is employed in construction (26 
percent), manufacturing (18 percent) and fisheries/agriculture (17 percent). Taken together, these 
three sectors account for more than 50 percent of the poor individuals with working household 
heads, and the fisheries sector alone accounts for about 26 percent of the total (Figure 23). 
Fisheries development is particularly important in the atolls, where 30 percent of the household 
heads work in the fishery sector (as opposed to only 1 percent in Malé). In the atolls, the fisheries 
sector alone accounts for 41 percent of poor individuals with a working household head.

As labor income is the main source of household income for the poor, an inclusive development 
of the labor market is key for reducing poverty and boosting shared prosperity. Labor income 
accounts for more than 70 percent of the total household income of the poor, and it is the main 
source of income for 70 percent of poor individuals. In Malé, where two-thirds of employed 
household heads work in public administration, education and health and services, labor income 
comes primarily from wages. In the atolls, where 45 percent of employed household heads work 
in fisheries and manufacturing, labor income is mainly self-employment income (see Figure 23).

After hitting 1.3 percent in 2012, economic growth has been steadily recovering and is estimated 
to amount to 5 percent in 2014.19 Most other service sectors are estimated to have grown as well 
in 2014, while the industrial sector expanded by 13.2 percent in 2014, driven by construction, 
following a contraction of 1.5 percent the previous year. However, the agriculture and fisheries 
sector is estimated to have contracted by 2.1 percent in 2014 after posting growth of 5 percent in 
2013. (Figure 24). See also Box 2 for a discussion on macro data. 

Average stay continued its secular decline as the composition of tourism changes further. The 
average stay of tourists declined to 6.1 days, down from a recorded average of 7.1 days between 
2009 and 2013, reflecting a structural shift in the composition of tourism. Between 2010 and 
2014 the share of European tourists fell by 20 percentage points from 63.8 to 43.9 percent due to 
weaker economic conditions in Europe. The simultaneous increase in the number of Asian tourists 
and demand from Middle East mitigated the weakening European demand. During the 2010-2014 
period the Asian share of tourists expanded by 15.2 percent while the share of Middle Eastern 
tourists grew by 1.6 percent (Figure 25).

Annual average inflation moderated even further in 2014, falling to 2.4 percent, down from 4 
percent in 2013 driven by low food prices and international crude prices. The fall is particularly 
steep considering the 10.9 percent inflation rate recorded in 2012. As measured by the overall 
consumer price index, inflation in Malé has been unstable since 2009 with large fluctuations. 
Following a spike in inflation in 2011, when the currency was floated and sharply devalued, inflation 
started showing signs of moderation and fell to a low of 2.4 percent in 2014 (Figure 26). During 
the second half of 2014, inflation fell even further, driven largely by a drop in food prices (Figure 
27). Prices for food and non-alcoholic beverages grew at a pace of 1 percent in 2014, as opposed 
to 7.5 percent in 2013. 

New taxes in 2011 and 2012, mainly on the tourism sector, have increased fiscal revenue 
structurally; however, the fiscal deficit widened to an estimated 11.6 percent of GDP in 2014. 
These taxes include the new Tourism Goods and Services Tax (TGST, which was increased from 8 
to 12 percent in November 2014) and an increase in the Airport Departure Tax. All these taxes are 
borne by tourists, who, according to the authorities, have an inelastic demand curve.20  In addition, 
a Business Profits Tax21 and a General GST have been introduced. The net impact has been to 
increase revenue from 21.9 percent of GDP in 2010 to 32.4 percent of GDP in 2014 (Figure 28).

However, persistent and widening fiscal deficits have led to a high level of public debt, which stood 
at 74.6 percent of GDP at end of 2014. This represented a net increase of 36.8 percent from 2003. 
This increase was driven by persistent deficits, while fast GDP growth relative to the average real 
interest rate on debt provided some downward pressure on the level of debt. 
Recognizing the unsustainable outlook of its fiscal accounts, the Government has proposed fiscal 
consolidation measures in its 2015 budget. On the revenue side this includes a “green tax” on 
tourism (which effectively replaces the Tourism Tax, which was abolished in late 2014, although 
at a lower rate), increases in import duties, a one-off revenue boost from Special Economic Zones 
(SEZ) acquisition fees and the extension of resort leases. On the expenditure side, the budget 
proposes to better target subsidies and freeze public employment. Although these measures, if 
properly implemented, will help reduce the deficit, they are unlikely to be sufficient to decrease 
the upward path of public debt, and further fiscal consolidation through expenditure and revenue 
measures will be needed in the short and medium term. 

Driven by high fiscal expenditure, the current account has been persistently in deficit, reaching 
an estimated 8.4 percent of GDP in 2014. The goods trade deficit is roughly offset by tourism 
revenue, but net income outflows (such as dividends and interest payments on external debt) 
and remittance outflows lead to an overall structural current account deficit. The deficit has been 
financed through foreign direct investment, while net capital outflows by private banks reflect the 
limited investment opportunities in the non-tourism sector. 

Indeed, apart from buying Treasury bills, the banking sector shows limited appetite to invest in the 
domestic economy. While the government has started to borrow increasingly from banks in recent 
years, a significant proportion of remaining bank assets are parked at the central bank, earning a 
very low overnight night rate,22 or are sent abroad.23  

22 
23 

The Overnight Deposit Facility was introduced in 2010, and the rate has been 1.5 percent since September 2014 (as of May 2015).
This may be a combination of repayments of earlier loans incurred in the mid-2000s and investments.

Meanwhile, credit to the private sector growth has mostly stagnated since 2008. In addition, credit 
to the private sector is concentrated in tourism, which is a legacy of a large increase in resorts 
leased out in the mid-2000s when local branches of banks borrowed from foreign head offices 
to lend to the domestic tourism sector. Since the global financial crisis, credit growth has been 
close to zero, with a write-off of non-performing loans in 2012.24  The focus has now moved to 
construction, electricity and real estate and other loans and advances (Figure 30).

At the end of 2014, gross international reserves increased, but net usable reserves remained low 
at only $120 million, covering less than a month of imports. As a result of the large improvement 
in net capital inflows, gross official reserves have increased from $368 million at the end of 2013 
to $614 million at the end of 2014, covering 3.7 months of imports of goods and services. However, 
the stable exchange rate and the parallel market premium do not signal any shortages. In practice, 
the amount of reserves in the economy may be much larger, and the tourism industry appears to 
supply sufficient quantities of foreign exchange at a stable premium over the official exchange 
rate. The exchange rate remained at MVR 15.4 per USD, while the premium declined, as major 
SOEs abstained from the secondary market.

box 2. a real crisis or a macro data crisis?
It has often said that Maldives is perennially at the verge of a crisis. When looking at the 
macro data the question is indeed why the country is not in a crisis. 

According to the IMF’s 2013 Debt Sustainability Analysis update, Maldives was at high risk 
of debt distress. In particular, the country had a persistent current account deficit of around 
20 percent of GDP; public domestic and external debt was 73 percent of GDP at end-2011, 
while private external debt was estimated at 38 percent of GDP. By February 2013, official 
reserves amounted to $304 million, equivalent to just 1.6 months of imports, and freely 
usable reserves amounted to only $99 million. Despite these challenges, stores were stocked 
with imported items and the exchange rate premium was modest. 

how can this puzzle be explained? 
First, the tourism industry seems to hold sufficient amounts of reserves at home and abroad 
to be able to supply sufficient quantities to the parallel market to keep the premium stable.
Second, given the extreme openness of the economy, the measurement of financial flows 
through the current and capital account are inaccurate. Similarly, poor financial management 
and recording practices contribute to underreporting on the expenditure side. 

The national accounts were revised recently according to international practice resulting in 
an increase of nominal GDP over previous estimates (e.g., by 13 percent in 2013, Figure 2.1).a 
At the same time, significant revisions have been made to the balance of payments data 
using new data sources, better methods and new data in line with IMF technical assistance 
recommendations. This resulted in large changes to the services balance (mostly tourism), 
goods balance (imports) and financial accounts, leading to a substantially narrower current 
account deficit (Figure 2.2), higher estimates of FDI inflows and reduced private-sector 
borrowing. Moreover, surveys and anecdotal evidence suggest that the tourism exports could 
still be underestimated.

As a result of these adjustments, the current account deficit in 2013 has been revised from 
20.5 percent of GDP to 6.5 percent of GDP. The level of public debt at end-2011 has been 
revised down to 59 percent of GDP, while the estimated level of private external debt has been 
revised down to 13 percent of GDP.

Old current account
(December 2013)

New current account 
(October 2013)

Although the 
country looks less 
vulnerable now, it is 
still considered on an 
unsustainable fiscal 
path.

On the other hand, the actual fiscal deficit is estimated much higher than the reported 
deficit. The fiscal deficit (reported by the Ministry of Finance) cannot be reconciled with net 
external and domestic borrowing by the government (reported by the Maldives Monetary 
Authority). While current expenditure in 2013 was reported as 32.6 percent of GDP by the 
authorities, the IMF estimates it to be 36.5 percent of GDP, mainly a result of the authorities 
underreporting interest payments, and incomplete and underreporting of subsidies and 
social welfare schemes, operations and maintenance payments. 

Although the country looks less vulnerable now, it is still considered on an unsustainable 
fiscal path, as the most recent joint World Bank-IMF DSA of 2015 points out. 

Notes: (a) The national accounts moved from basic prices (excluding taxes and subsidies on products) to market 
prices; (b) IMF (2015).

key Messages
Maldives development model is inherently vulnerable to shocks and increasingly not 
sustainable. In particular:
∫ Maldives is highly vulnerable to external macro shocks
∫ Maldives democratic transition is still in progress and political instability high
∫ Maldives social contract is at risk due to lack of inclusiveness, especially of youth
∫ Environmental sustainability is at risk due to climate change, lack of preparedness for 
natural disasters, waste management and lack of access to potable water
∫ Electricity generation cost is the highest in South Asia

Maldives is highly 
vulnerable to shocks 
due to its small size, 
lack of economic 
diversification and 
heavy reliance on 
imports.

Recent socio-economic and political developments have raised concerns regarding the 
sustainability of Maldives’ development model. Despite a long period of sustained economic 
growth, the vulnerability of Maldives’ model of development is increasing over time, especially with 
respect to its fiscal, social, political and environmental sustainability. 

MaCroeConoMiC vUlnerabiliTY and sUsTainabiliTY

Maldives is highly vulnerable to shocks due to its small size, lack of economic diversification and 
heavy reliance on imports. Furthermore, increasing macroeconomic imbalances and escalating 
public debt represent a growing source of external vulnerability. While the Maldivian economy has 
shown resilience in the past, the country may currently lack appropriate buffers to cope with a 
shock that would affect the tourism sector, terms of trade or interest rates.

box 3. how “special” is Maldives?
Before the tsunami hit in 2004, expenditure levels were in line with other island states, such 
as Cape Verde, Sao Tome and Principe, Barbados and Dominica, which are all countries with 
higher tourist receipts, large fiscal deficits, large current account deficits and a soft-peg 
exchange rate. Moreover, expenditure was in the 20th to 80th percentile of emerging and 
developing countries. After the tsunami and the introduction of democracy, expenditure has 
moved to the top 20th percentile and has stayed there (Figure 3.1).

Maldives is also an outlier in many ways compared to the rest of the world. Its exports 
and imports are the 97th percentile of the world, its current account in the 8th percentile 
(although the recent revision makes the current account deficit less exceptional), and 
expenditure in the 77th percentile (Figure 3.2).

In terms of growth volatility as measured by the standard deviation of real GDP growth over 
2003-13, Maldives ranks in the 94th percentile compared to all countries, and it has the 
highest standard deviation among all five peer island states mentioned above.

As a small island

level of imports, the 
country is vulnerable 
to changes in 
commodity prices.

As a small island state with a high level of imports, the country is vulnerable to food and fuel 
commodity prices through the balance of payments. Moreover, as it subsidizes flour, rice and 
sugar, and diesel-based electricity generation, the fiscal accounts are equally vulnerable to price 
shocks. Indeed, 2011, the year of the exchange rate devaluation, saw a one-off spike in subsidies 
of 0.7 percent of GDP. 

Tourism has created additional channels of external vulnerability to shocks, which has created 
significant volatility for the economy as a whole. The trends over the past decade have highlighted 
the fact that tourism can be affected by a host of factors beyond the control of the country. These 
include environmental events (the tsunami affecting Maldives directly), global economic trends 
(the 2001 recession and the recent global financial crisis affecting wealth of European travelers), 
and even security concerns abroad (September 11 terror attacks limiting air travel). These external 
shocks have been passed on to the economy as a whole, given the high dependence of Maldives 
on tourism.

Note: Rigid expenditure defined as salaries, wages and allowances, social welfare contributions, interest payments and 
subsidies and transfers. Tourism-related revenue defined as tourism tax, GST on tourism, Airport Service Charge, royalties, 
land and resort rent, (part of) import duty revenue and Business Profit Tax.

Especially in recent years, the development model has led to an increasing share of revenue 
dependent on tourism, while an increasing share of expenditure has become “rigid”. That is, an 
increasing share of expenditure consists of items that are not easily adjusted in the event of a 
downturn in revenue: subsidies and transfers, social welfare contributions, salaries and wages and 
interest payments (Figure 31). 

The lack of macro policy buffers leaves the country with few instruments to stabilize the economy 
in the event of a downturn in tourism. With high debt and an already high fiscal deficit, it will be 
difficult to increase expenditure or reduce taxes in the case of a downturn. Moreover, for a small 
island state with most consumption goods imported and a high pass-through of exchange rate 
fluctuations into inflation,25  exchange rate stability is of utmost importance. The country’s official 
foreign exchange reserves have frequently reached levels below three month’s import coverage.26  
This limits the country’s ability to respond to pressure on the exchange rate, which has led to 
devaluations in 2001 and 2011 and to balance of payment support in 2005 after the tsunami and 
in 2009 after the global financial crisis. 

Maldives’ already high level of public debt and fiscal path leads to immediate fiscal sustainability 
concerns. Unless adjustments are made to revenue and expenditure, the current development 
model will lead to ever increasing levels of public debt, even after the fiscal consolidation measures 
budgeted in 2015. Overall public debt (including domestic debt) is estimated at 74.6 percent of GDP 
at the end of 2014, well above the benchmark of 56 percent of GDP established under the LIC-Debt 
Sustainability Framework.27  It is projected to continue to grow throughout the projection horizon, 
driven by a persistent primary fiscal deficit. An increasing share of the budget will be devoted to 
paying interest on debt. Moreover, growth shocks and fiscal slippages would lead to even higher

88 percent of a change in the nominal effective exchange rate is passed to consumer prices within one year (Masha and Park, 
2012).
It should be noted though that a lot of foreign exchange remains outside the central bank, and private agents are often able to find 
foreign exchange when needed.

levels of debt. Meanwhile, the persistent current account deficit has led to an increasing level of 
external debt, and the country is at “moderate risk of debt distress.” Although the level of debt is 
below the policy-dependent thresholds, a shock to tourism exports could make it difficult for the 
country to service its external debt (Figure 32 and 33).

Note: Unlike the face value, the present value takes into account debt concessionality. 

Moreover, the widening fiscal deficit has led to rising interest rates. The widening fiscal deficit has 
forced the country to accumulate more and more domestic debt. As a result, the government has 
resorted to central bank debt financing (until May 2014) and domestic arrears28  as additional 
financing sources. As market interest rates started to increase strongly by mid-2013, the 
authorities put a cap on interest rates (called a “tap” system), which has temporarily stabilized 
interest cost on domestic debt. 

Accumulated domestic arrears add an additional fiscal burden. The stock of accumulated domestic 
arrears was estimated at 6.2 percent of GDP at the end of 2012. About 82 percent was owed to 
SOEs, in particular to the government-owned importer of fuel, medicine and basic food, and to the 
Aasandha Company (health insurance). The emergence of arrears is the result of both unrealistic 
budget envelopes and a lack of expenditure controls.29

The IMF estimates arrears in order of 6.3 percent of GDP in 2013 (World Bank and IMF, 2015).

This points to weaknesses in public financial management as a source of fiscal risk. The budget 
as a policy document suffers from a lack of credibility and limited policy orientation. Expenditure 
composition variations are significant at more than 15 percent of the original budget. Furthermore, 
there is no credible medium-term macro-fiscal framework and it has a weak and inefficient system 
of budget review. Existing cash constraints limit the predictability and control of the budget. 
Moreover, although consolidated financial statements have been produced since 2011, data 
quality and consistency are a concern. The government does not meet the basic practices of fiscal 
risk disclosure and analysis on contingent liabilities and actual liabilities. There is no complete 
picture of contingent liabilities that may arise from loan guarantees that have been issued as the 
government does not report on the main risks to its fiscal forecasts.30  

SOEs may pose further risks to fiscal sustainability as most are loss-making and depend on 
government support, with only nine companies having contributed dividends to the budget in 
the last four years. Shortcomings in the operations and oversight of SOEs contribute to macro-
fiscal risks, due to inadequate regulation and supervision. Most SOEs operate at a loss, and 
represent a drain to the budget and a source of risk associated to costly fuel imports, foreign 
exchange transactions, and payment arrears. Capital transfers to SOEs and subsidy transfers have 
contributed substantially to the growth in expenditures in recent years (Figure 34). An independent 
centralized ownership entity (the Privatization and Corporatization Board) was established under 
a comprehensive legal framework in 2013, but final decisions on the appropriate institutional 
arrangements are still under consideration.

PoliTiCal and insTiTUTional risks

Maldives democratic transition started recently. The country adopted a new constitution in 2008, 
ushering in multi-party elections as well as a set of new state institutions at central and local levels, 
often with mandated high degrees of independence. The new constitution enacted a mechanism 
for separation of powers by creating independent branches of the Legislature, Executive and 
Judiciary for the first time in the history of the country.

Powers of and relationships among democratic institutions are still being defined. For instance, 
until recently parliamentarians were able to simply add expenditures to the budget on their own 
initiative without concern for expenditure limits and all independent commissions created their own 
human resource regimes. More importantly, Maldives is a split polity where political contestation is 
not always handled through institutional channels. There have been frequent incidences of political 
unrest over the past 10 years and election processes have been criticized by observers as lacking 
credibility in many key aspects. Institutional incoherence and political instability currently hamper 
the ability of the government to provide goods and services and to carry out its redistribution 
function, which is central to social and economic inclusion in Maldives. It poses a longer-term risk 
to improving government operations and, more generally, public trust in the state. 

Institutional and political instability constrain the sustainability of Maldives’ development 
model moving forward. There is widespread consensus that political stability was critical to the 
development of the tourism industry in Maldives. The current polarization of the political party 
system, resulting political unrest and the limits of checks and balances between powers, all 
contribute to aggravating political and institutional risks as well as macro and social sustainability 
issues.

Economic opportunities in Maldives are out of sync with growth and shared prosperity. Public 
administration is the primary sector of employment in Maldives, particularly for the educated 
local workforce. Alone, it accounts for 17 percent of total employment and one-fourth of the 
employment for workers with secondary or higher levels of education. The tourism industry, while 
driving the growth process and being the main contributor to GDP, accounts for only 16 percent 
of employment and relies disproportionally on expatriate workforce for both high- and low-skilled 
jobs. The fisheries sector, which is a crucial sector for poverty reduction and shared prosperity, 
accounts for 11 percent of total employment and one-fourth of the workforce with less than 
secondary education (Figure 35).

The interplay of socio-demographic trends and fiscal constraints adds to the social sustainability 
challenge of Maldives’ development model. The progress in health indicators, notably the reduction 
in mortality rates over the past decades, has contributed to Maldives demographic transition. With 
a reduction in the total fertility rate to population replacement rates, the population growth has 
stabilized, creating the opportunity for a demographic dividend (Figures 36 and 37). The increase 
in the working age population, with a shift toward a relatively more educated young labor force, 
puts enormous pressure on the absorption capacity of Maldives labor market. That is especially 
the case in view of the hiring freeze of the public sector – which constitutes the main employer for 
high-skilled jobs – and the increasing competition coming from a relatively cheaper (low-skilled 
jobs) and better educated (high-skilled jobs) expatriate workforce.

Youth and women are particularly vulnerable to the social sustainability challenges of Maldives’ 
development model: 

∫ The increasing supply of educated youth in a context characterized by limited labor demand 
by the public sector and a skills mismatch in the private sector has contributed to high youth 
unemployment. In 2010, according to HIES data, the unemployment rate for individuals in 
the 15 to 24 age group was 25 percent, more than double the unemployment rate of the total 
workforce (11.8 percent). The lack of economic opportunities for the youth is contributing 
to other social ills, such as drug abuse and gang-related violence, especially among male 
youth. 

∫ The public sector has traditionally been the biggest employer of women in Maldives, with 
34 percent of female employment in the health and education sector and 15 percent 
employment in public administration. Limited working hours and availability of jobs on 
inhabited islands have made public employment particularly appealing for women and 
contributed to sustaining relatively high female labor force participation (58 percent). 
Fiscal constraints to job creation in the public sector have contributed to increasing female 
unemployment vis-à-vis males.

A growing gap between aspirations and opportunities for socio-economic inclusion has contributed 
to fostering disenfranchisement among Maldivian youth. After 30 years of sustained economic 
growth and social development, the current generation of youth is the first faced with the prospect 
of not being able to achieve the same level of wellbeing as their parents. Increasing competition 
from foreign labor for high- and low-end jobs and limited opportunities for employment in the public 
sector contribute to worsening social mobility prospects for the new generation. Disenfranchisement 
and frustration are growing, especially in the capital area Malé were many youth migrated with the 
hope of building a future. 

Limited education opportunities and skills challenge youth capacity to realize their aspirations though 
a productive labor market engagement. Employment status is crucial to shape life satisfaction,

The current

wellbeing and self-esteem, especially among young males (WDR 2013).31 Facing competition from 
foreign labor and lacking sufficient skills to face the challenge, Maldivian youth are increasingly 
confronted with bleak labor market32 opportunities and a failure to meet their aspirations in terms of 
social mobility. The current economic model has proved unable to provide the youth with the skills and 
knowledge necessary to compete on a globalized labor market  and low productivity public sector jobs 
are becoming increasingly unappealing and scarce due to government budget constraints.

High levels of actual and perceived inequality coupled with a progressive deterioration of the social 
contract further contribute to widening youth aspiration gap. As discussed in Chapter 2, high and 
increasing levels of inequality between the poorest and the richest segments of the population, as 
well as unequal opportunities between Malé and the atolls, all contribute to the emergence of social 
cleavages that work against cohesion and social development33. Moreover, governance constraints, 
such as the lack of transparency and accountability, together with the inability of politics to address the 
most urgent social and economic concerns, add to youth frustration and challenge future prospects of 
inclusive economic development in Maldives. These ongoing social dynamics contribute to widening the 
gap between the adult generation – currently in power and benefiting from the security associated with 
the redistribution of the rents from past economic development -- and a young generation struggling 
to find social space and identity under uncertain socio-economic circumstances. 

Social ills such as gang violence and drug abuse are on the rise, and further contribute to strengthening 
the exclusion of “youth at risk” from the social fabric. Anecdotal evidence suggests that gang participation 
and violence is on the rise among young men. In Malé alone there are 20-30 active gangs, each with 50-
400 members, a majority of whom have suffered from violence or perpetrated violence. Moreover, the 
intensity of gang violence is reportedly rising.34  This increase in gang violence is likely an effect of the 
social, political and economic exclusion of the country’s youth because of their disengagement from 
the labor market and other spheres of public life. Gangs offer a form of inclusion by offering a sense 
of identity and group belonging, and provide financial rewards: a significant proportion of young men 
in gangs are deemed to be engaged in drug dealing.35  Illicit drug use among gang members is also 
increasingly problematic, and is further fueling gang-related and broader social violence. Though drug 
users are overwhelmingly male, there is evidence to suggest that it is an increasing problem for women 
who are increasingly subject to sexual and gender-based violence.36

As discussed in the WDR (2013), job opportunities contribute to determine individuals’ status within a society and how people view 
themselves in relation to others.
This lack of skills includes technical skills, as well as the so-called ‘soft skills’ to secure employment, and when employed, to stay 
in a job, such as positive attitudes toward work and learning, respectful professional relationships, time management and good 
attendance, self-esteem and confidence, and sound professional decision-making. Consequently, young Maldivians may not get 
the jobs they desire because they are perceived to be less responsible, and have a poorer work ethic than the older generation or 
the large numbers of migrant workers. Employers interviewed for a recent gender assessment of the Maldives opined that they are 
unwilling to hire young Maldivians because those they had hired in the past regularly came to work late, take unscheduled leave, are 
unresponsive to supervisor input, and sometimes vanish altogether without any explanation. World Bank, (2014c).
Empirical evidence strongly points out that income inequality leads to greater social and political instability. See Alesina and Rodrik, 
1994, Alesina et al 1996. Briguglio et al. (2006) include social development among the essential components of economic resilience 
in SIDS. According to the authors (ibid: 275), “Social development […] indicates the extent to which social relations in a society 
are properly developed, enabling an effective functioning of the economic apparatus without the hindrance of civil unrest. Social 
development can also indicate the extent to which effective social dialogue takes place in an economy, which would in turn enable 
collaborative approaches towards the undertaking of corrective measures in the face of adverse shocks.”
Asia Foundation(2012)
ibid.; p.15.
According to data from the most recent DHS, over one-quarter (28.4%) of Maldivian women have experienced physical and/or 
sexual violence at some point in their lives by either partners or non-partners.  Though this proportion is lower than other South 
Asian countries, it is higher than in other middle-income Asian countries like Malaysia (14.5%), Indonesia (3.7%) or the Philippines

Natural resources

country’s main asset 
but there are growing 
concerns in terms of 
sustainability.

These dynamics might further limit opportunities for socio-economic inclusion, particularly of 
Maldivian women. According to the HIES (2010), while the major reason given by both women and 
men for being unemployed was their inability to find suitable employment, 22 percent of women 
cited household chores as a reason, and another 3 percent were deterred by objection from family 
members. Thus, lack of supporting environment in the family was a major factor discouraging a 
significant number of women from seeking employment. In particular, marriage and pregnancy 
at a young age, geographical isolation, and social norms restricting women’s mobility are factors 
that limit women’s contribution to national development.

environMenTal vUlnerabiliTY and sUsTainabiliTY issUes

Natural resources represent the country’s main asset but there are growing concerns in terms of 
sustainability. Climate change could cause annual economic losses of more than 12 percent of 
Maldives’ GDP by 2100.37  Due to rising sea levels, the entire country could be submerged before the 
end of the century as 80 percent of land is less than 1 meter above sea level. With 42 percent of the 
population and more than 70 percent of critical infrastructure within 100 meters of shoreline, this 
would have dire social and economic consequences, notably for the poorer and most vulnerable. 
Despite past efforts, the country is not prepared to withstand a rise in sea levels, as most lifeline 
infrastructure (such as power houses, hospitals and harbors), population centers (such as 
schools) and dwellings are not adequately designed. Indeed, “the most serious underlying driver 
of increasing vulnerability to climate change in Maldives appears to be the absence of systematic 
adaptation planning and practice. Climatic risks and long-term resilience are not adequately 
integrated into island land use planning or into coastal development and protection policies and 
practice, and past autonomous risk reduction efforts have sometimes had mal-adaptive effects”.38  
In order to partially address this, the government prepared a Strategic National Action Plan in 
June 2011 to integrate Disaster Risk Reduction and Climate Change Adaptation, but its actual 
implementation appears to be limited.39

However the most pressing issues relate to shortcomings in the management of natural resources, 
particularly with regard to sewage and solid waste management. An estimated 248,000 tons of 
solid waste was generated in 2007, most coming from urban areas (Figure 38), and this figure is 
expected to increase to 660,000 tons by 2020.40  Despite the scale of the challenge, most of the 
134 Island Waste Management Centers, covering 66 percent of the islands, are not fully functional, 
as no program for transport of waste from these centers to a regional or central waste-processing 
center has been established.41  Regulation seems to be poorly enforced. Resorts, in particular, have 
been accused of dumping waste in the sea and not using incinerators as mandated by law (Figure 
39), although this assertion has not been documented. Adequate management of solid waste 
is hindered by the high cost of service delivery in the country, associated with the low volume of 
waste on each island and the high cost of transportation. Land scarcity also limits the options for 
establishing and managing adequate landfills. The issue of sewage and solid waste is particularly 
challenging, as it has a direct impact on the country’s most valuable natural resources – coral 
reefs and fisheries. Uncontrolled waste disposal and floating debris at tourist resorts are the most 
visible threats to the country’s reputation as a pristine high-end tourist destination. They also 
affect the quality of ground water, with a direct impact on island communities.

Most of the Maldivian population depends on the ground water and rain water as source of fresh 
water, which are at high risk due to climate change. As Maldives consists of low-lying islands, 
the rise in sea-levels would force salt water intrusion into fresh water lens. Minimum projected 
sea level rise of 1mm per year shows that the groundwater safe yield will decrease at least by 
3 percent between 2012 and 2030. In addition, in most inhabited islands the groundwater is 
contaminated due to untreated sewage disposal into the ground. It is estimated that per capita 
water availability will decline by 34 percent from the 2009 level of 103 cubic meters per year 
to 76.6 cubic meters per year by 2035. The shifting in the rainfall pattern from drier and more 
inter-annually variable rainfall regime over the next 20 years and increase in temperature of 
0.5°C to 3.5°C expected by 2100 will increase water demand leading to high competition over 
scarce resources, making water security for potable and irrigation purposes continue to be a 
serious problem.42  Confronted by diminishing resources, more than 100 islands have requested 
emergency fresh water shipments since 2005, and the challenge is likely to increase over time 
due to continued population pressure.43  The institutional framework for managing fresh water 
supply needs strengthening, as the government does not have any single and unifying body 
overseeing the water and sanitation sector and therefore no quality checks are performed.

The country is also vulnerable to shocks to drinking water supply due to the lack of back-up 
arrangements. This vulnerability was shown clearly by the water crisis in December 2014, when 
a fire in a water treatment plant in Malé led to acute shortages of drinking water and required 
emergency supplies from neighboring countries.

The loss of coral reef represents a threat to the sustainability of the tourism industry and 
fisheries, and is also compounding the effects of climate change. Coral reefs are a major tourist 
attraction in Maldives but are affected by the rise in sea temperature and pollution However, the 
damage to coral reefs caused by harbor dredging and reclamation are much more significant 
now as a result of the current development model. Other pressures include damage caused by 
divers, illegal collection of corals and unsustainable exploitation of high-value reef resources. 
As coral reefs also play an important role in protecting shores against rising sea levels, their 
destruction may also aggravate the impact of climate change. Furthermore, the loss of coral 
reef is resulting in the loss of valuable bait fish which are used for tuna fisheries, a major source 
of food and income in outer atolls.

Per capita water 
availability will 
decline by 34 percent 
by 2035.

Institutional capacity for managing the country’s natural resources is relatively weak. Because of

Maldives has a significant potential for lowering the cost of electricity generation through wider 
use of renewable energy. At the present time power is supplied by diesel generators through 
isolated, island-specific grids, spread over 900 square kilometers. The country relies almost 
entirely on imported fossil fuel to supply the generators, costing about 15 percent of GDP in 2013. 
Furthermore, due to the high costs of domestic electricity production and distribution, the country 
has a long history of subsidized energy prices that have contributed to over-consumption and 
limited incentives opportunities to invest in alternative and environmentally sustainable renewable 
energy sources. Currently, the cumulative installed photovoltaic-based generation capacity is 
less than 2 MW, spread across several islands and programs. While the installed PV capacity is 
still limited, it has demonstrated its viability as a source of cheaper and cleaner energy. Going 
forward, wider adoption of renewable energy will require, among other things innovative financing 
approaches such as PPPs and a review of the incentives scheme, including the current subsidies 
on diesel-based electricity generation.

key Messages
∫ Maldives main challenge is to improve inclusiveness of the development model
∫ Tourism has developed as enclave model; opportunities for inclusiveness require 
improving:
- Transparency lease allocation for resorts’ development
- Linkages to local economy
- Employment opportunities for local population
- Opportunities for sustainable community-based tourism development
∫ Fisheries development is key sector for improving incomes of the poor; opportunities for 
sector development require improving:
- 
Industry competitiveness
- Management of natural resources
- 
Investment opportunities in sub-industries
∫ Agriculture has untapped potential for growth and employment generation; opportunities 
for sector development require improving:
- Linkages between supply and demand/value chains with tourism
- Adoption of new technologies

Maldives has experienced a high pace of growth, but the main challenge will be to enhance 
its inclusiveness going forward. As discussed in previous sections, the Maldivian economy is 
dominated by tourism, while tradable sectors and physical exports are largely limited to fisheries. 
Tourism has leveraged the country’s endowments to underpin a very rapid growth, but the largely 
high-end tourism industry has developed in an enclave way, with limited linkages with the local 
communities. Fisheries are a significant source of employment, particularly for the poor, but the 
industry has stalled and much of the value is lost through low-added-value exports. The small size 
of the economy, together with other structural environment factors, has limited the development 
of other economic activities. Accordingly, the rapid overall economic growth of the country has 
not been accompanied by a commensurate growth in opportunities and jobs for the Maldivian 
population – especially for the youth, and for women whether youth or adult. 

Maldives has 
experienced a high 
pace of growth, but 
the main challenge 
will be to enhance its 
inclusiveness going

Tourism is the most important industry in Maldives. Tourism constitutes by far the biggest 
contributor to GDP at 28 percent, and is the greatest generator of foreign exchange earnings at 
more than 60 percent in 2014. Revenue from the sector accounts for 38 percent of government 
revenue, derived from various taxes and lease of islands.44  Additional contributions from airport 
service charges, import duty and revenue from ancillary industries increase the overall impact of 
the tourism sector in the economy. 

Tourism in Maldives has grown steadily since 1970s and Maldives has managed to position itself as 
a high-end destination (Figure 40). Tourism in Maldives has developed as a supply-driven industry 
whose development was initially led by the private sector - as opposed to through government 
policies or support programs. Notably, while the supply for touristic facilities is constantly 
increasing, the country so far has been largely able to maintain both high occupancy rates (Figure 
41) as well as a high premium (deemed as high as 40 percent45  over other touristic destinations). 
Such premium is deemed to be based on the unique natural resources of the country, as well as on 
the exclusivity of facilities – which, in turn, is underpinned by the geographic dispersion of islands 
and the enclave conditions of resorts.

However, the sustainability of such premium cannot be taken for granted. The tourism industry 
has been susceptible to external shocks and changes in global trends. Most recently, the global 
financial crisis prompted a structural shift in the composition of arrivals, from Europe to Asia. 
Between 2008 and 2013, the share of European tourists fell by 26 percentage points mainly due 
to weaker economic conditions in Europe. Conversely, the share of Chinese tourists expanded by 
23 percentage points (Figure 42). This shift in demand was pursued by the industry, which made 
important marketing efforts in China and Middle East to compensate for the declining demand 
from Europe. While this shift helped maintain the volume of arrivals and occupancy, the overall 
profitability of the industry appears to be declining. The average length of stay fell from eight 
nights in 2008 to 6.1 in 2014 and is expected to continue declining as Chinese travelers favor 
shorter stays than European ones (Figure 43) and have a lower demand for ancillary activities 
such as diving and fishing, which generate additional revenue for the industry.

And increase in supply may enhance downward pressures on the profitability of tourism. The 
volume of development of new tourism capacity has been growing and is expected to continue 
growing. At the present time, there are 89 new resorts under development with a planned capacity 
of 14,153 additional beds.46  If completed, these new resorts would increase the supply of beds by 
52 percent over the established capacity at the end of 2014. This evolution could translate into an 
increase in revenues as has been the case in the past, but it could also reach an inflection point 
where increased capacity will start driving down prices and premium. Lack of planning has led to 
sub-optimal growth and development proposition as potential resort developments are brought to 
market with little analysis or coordination with other sectors (such as transport47  or skills training). 
While investor interest has remained strong, these challenges often threaten the financial viability 
of new projects and their ability to attract financing. 

Governance shortcomings in the current model for allocation of resort leases may be hampering 
the development of tourism and preventing the country from maximizing benefits and enhancing 
inclusive growth in three main ways. First, although the resort sector is open to competition on 
paper, in practice the sector is dominated by a few large groups. In theory the legal framework

for tourism allows for open and competitive bidding on resorts, although islands in which the 
government makes an investment are exempted from the bidding process.48  In practice it 
appears that there are significant barriers to entry,49  which may have prevented the country 
from maximizing the benefits from its natural resources. As a result, as of the end of 2013, the 
four largest tourism groups (including two of the pioneers) control 31 percent of resorts and 38 
percent of the resort beds. Their influence has remained strong over the decades. For example, 
of the resorts established in the 1990s and after 2010, the four groups account for 52 and 44 
percent of the beds, respectively (Figure 44).50

Second, the current methods for allocating leases has translated into sub-optimal investment 
levels, with a large number of leased islands remaining undeveloped or suffering severe delays 
in construction. At present there are 106 licenses granted for new resorts, but there have been 
significant delays in construction of the planned resorts. Indeed, one-third of the licensed resorts 
have not come into operation more than five years after the license was granted, and 22 licensed 
resorts have experienced delays of around 10 years. Altogether, the licensed but unfinished resorts 
would account for 21,000 additional beds51  that are planned but have not materialized as a source 
of income for the country (which would increase by 78 percent the capacity in the country; create 
31,000 additional direct jobs;52  and provide significant revenue flows to the country through taxes 
and duties). The significant delays in construction of resorts after a license is granted have been 
blamed on a host of factors, including lack of financing. While these factors may indeed become 
hurdles once a license has been granted, the delays in construction appear to evidence significant 
shortcomings in the process followed to grant the licenses in the first place. Stringent and clear 
criteria for licensing of resorts would have enabled the country to ensure that licenses are granted 
to investors than can demonstrate the qualifications, experience and financial ability to develop the 
resorts shortly after licenses are granted. Clear enforcement processes would enable authorities 
to cancel non-performing leases and grant them to better qualified investors.

Third, entities set up to promote the development of tourism may be helping to undermine the 
governance of the sector. The Maldives Marketing and Public Relations Cooperation (MMPRC) is 
as a state-owned enterprise formed in 2009 to promote and market the tourism industry. The 
Maldives Tourism Development Corporation (MTDC) was set up in 2006 as an entity with 47 
percent government ownership and 53 percent private shareholding. Both MMRPC and MTDC can 
acquire leases for resort islands without being subjected to the standard bidding process and, in 
some cases, at below market rates. In turn, these leases can be developed or subleased to private 
parties. While the Ministry of Tourism has aimed to strengthen governance of leases through 
implementation of standard operation procedures, these subleases are not subject to the standard 
operating procedures of the Ministry of Tourism and both MTDC and MMRPC lack procedures to 
ensure transparency in subleases and prevent corruption. Further, the composition of the boards 
of directors of MTDC and MMPRC has raised concerns on lack of transparency on appointments 
and potential conflicts of interest. The later stems from the fact that board members include 
heads of private tourism companies that can benefit from subleases.53  Notably, MTDC holds five 
leases that were granted nine years ago and represent an expected capacity of 1,280 beds that 
have not come into operation. This, together with governance concerns on their operations, calls 
into question the extent to which these two organizations are contributing to development of the 
tourism industry in a way that maximizes the benefits to the country.

53 

At least one case has been identified of a private company linked to a board member which has been granted a sublease from 
MMPRC.

Investment climate and political risk concerns may also undermine the ability of Maldives to attract 
reputable investors in the future. Recent political unrest (which prompted travel advisories from 
various countries) together with international media reports highlighting the risk of radicalization 
have created concerns among tourism private stakeholders of a potential slowdown in demand 
from Western tourists as well as potential long-term deterioration of Maldives brand. Future 
additional investment may also be affected by investors’ perception of instability in regulatory 
environment. This includes: a lack of formal consultation between government agencies, private 
sector and civil society on key policy decisions; a regulatory environment in a state of constant 
flux that leaves businesses financially exposed and unable to plan; and a potentially insufficient 
implementation period for the industry to adapt to new compliance measures.54 Recent negative 
experience in FDI disputes likely works to undermine investors’ confidence in Maldives (see also 
section on investment climate below).

And the industry has developed as an enclave, with limited positive spillovers to the local 
communities. The country’s unique island geography presents many natural as well as socio-
cultural barriers to integration. It is spatially dispersed with small surface areas, and has limited 
transport connections and a small population. As a result, the tourism industry has grown up 
in relative economic isolation with heavy reliance on foreign capital, foreign labor and limited 
economic linkages. There are also significant structural and social barriers to Maldivian women’s 
employment in the tourism sector that contribute to its lack of inclusiveness.

Given the importance of tourism in Maldives, a more inclusive industry may hold the key to 
improving shared prosperity in the country. The industry is dominated by luxury enclave resorts, 
which have grown with heavy reliance on foreign capital and foreign labor and limited linkages 
to the rest of the economy. While there are a number of ancillary industries that have grown 
alongside tourism (notably through demands on the transport, construction and communication 
sectors), the linkages between tourism and the local economy remain modest. The participation 
of women in either the tourism sector per se or in ancillary industries is low. Tourism generated 
38 percent of government tax revenue (2013)55  and 83 percent of the country’s foreign exchange 
earnings from exports of goods and services, but substantial leakages undermine the economic 
and social benefits of the industry. A large proportion of the revenue generated through tourism 
is lost through import of products, import of labor and financial outflows related to dividends and 
external debt servicing (as external debt largely fuels resorts development) and offshore booking 
of revenues originated by resorts. These areas are further discussed below.

Better linkages between the resorts and the local enterprises may help to leverage on tourism 
growth for development of other tradable sectors. According to anecdotal evidence, close to 100 
percent of the goods required by resorts are imported. It is suggested that local enterprises lack 
the ability to provide goods with the quality and reliability needed to cater to the expectations of 
the high-end resorts. Government policies supporting import substitution have not translated into 
a visible growth in the real sector, which remains hampered by, among other things, the small 
size of the economy (with limited economies of scale), high dispersion of the population, and

A commonly-cited example is the T-GST, increased from 8 percent to 12 percent in November 2014, and a green tax of US$6 a bed-

high transport costs. Given the structural limitations of the country, the potential for backward 
linkages between tourism and local enterprises is likely modest and probably limited to a handful 
of products. 

Tourism is a large and rapidly growing source of jobs, but most of them are not seized by local 
population due to a host of factors. While tourism creates a large number of jobs, the Maldivian 
population does not take advantage of them. Across the board, only 15 percent of employed 
Maldivian men and 4 percent of employed Maldivian women work in the tourism sector, while the 
number of foreign nationals employed in the sector has increased constantly over time (Figures 
45and 46). A government-imposed quota (requiring 55 percent of employees in tourism to be 
Maldivian nationals) is customarily unmet56  and, in general, appears to have failed to sustainably 
enhance the participation of Maldivian nationals in tourism. Tourism in Maldives has created 
more than 28,000 direct jobs57  and government targets for new resorts58  imply an added annual 
requirement for 3,300 new staff. The relative importance of this figure is evident when compared 
to the unemployment figures in the country. The total number of the unemployed in Maldives is 
estimated around 11,000, of which around 8,000 are young people. The lack of participation in 
tourism jobs is particularly dire among women, who account for less than 3 percent of the labor 
in the industry.

The obstacles to enhance broader participation of the Maldivian nationals in tourism appear to 
be manifold. Information collected from stakeholders, civil society and youth through interviews 
and consultations during the preparation of this diagnostic identified a number of factors that 
appear to be at play in restricting broader participation of the local population on tourism. These 
include: (1) reservation wage that is too high for unskilled jobs; (2) lack of skills for technical and 
managerial jobs (see section on skills below); (3) social norms (see section on youth below); and 
(4) lack of adequate transport (resorts that are close to inhabited islands and have good transport 
links have a much higher proportion of Maldivian workers).  However, data does not currently exist 
to validate these perceptions in a conclusive manner.59

59 

According to the 2014 census (published by the National Bureau of statistics) the foreign nationals account for 58.4 percent of all 
tourism employees, but anecdotal evidence suggests that this figure may me significantly higher.
According to the 2014 census (published by the National Bureau of statistics)   there were 11,425 Maldivian employees (10,991 
male and 435 female) at resorts, and 16,342 foreign employees (14,339 male and 2,003 female). However, according to the Ministry 
of Tourism, by early 2015, a total of 23,917 resort beds creates an approximate total employment demand (at a ratio of 1:1.5) of 
31,000 staff.
The Government’s plans for development of tourism consider ten resorts (average bed capacity is 220) each year. Source: Ministry 
of Tourism.
This has been confirmed in interviews with Maldivians for the youth and gender studies.

A nascent segment of community-based tourism may represent a valuable option for diversification 
and inclusive growth (Figures 47 and 48). Most importantly, this segment appears to create 
opportunities for tourism that is well integrated with local communities. Guesthouse development 
is the fastest growing segment. New legislation in 2009 allowed islanders to develop their homes 
into guesthouses. This new product has grown rapidly, totaling approximately 238 facilities with 
3,565 rooms, with likelihood of doubling in the next three years. Every atoll (bar one) is now hosting 
some kind of guesthouse or hotel on inhabited islands, with the majority concentrated in the urban 
centers of Hulhumalé and Malé (79 establishments). Attracting a different market, this product 
does not represent competition for resorts other than at an infrastructure level – considering the 
existing limitations of the international airport.

Notably, the potential for integration of this market segment with local communities appears high. 
First, the proportion of Maldivian nationals working in this market segment (estimated by the 
industry at 75 percent of total workforce, see box) is significantly higher than in resorts (estimated 
below 45 percent). Second, there is evidence of a nascent ‘ecosystem’ of local suppliers of goods 
and services around guesthouses. Third, closer interaction between tourists and islanders in 
an every-day setting has been relatively positive in this situation, and may be a case study in 
‘exposure’ and breaking of socio-cultural stigmas towards the sector in general. 

Growth in this segment has some limitations and risks. It is likely to be highly concentrated around 
transport hubs (airports) since elasticity of demand will be lower in this segment. Most importantly, 
the rapid and unplanned growth of this market segment has already translated into visible negative 
impact on the environment compounding the existing challenges in inhabited islands. Waste 
management, land-use planning, population displacement and environmental management are 
some of the issues at the forefront of inhabited islands already. Simply supporting the increase of 
supply will put pressure on island resources to the detriment of all.

There are still unrealized opportunities for linkages between tourism and local providers of goods 
and services. The tourism industry is a large and rapidly growing source of demand for goods. 
In 2014, food items alone (grains, fruit, meat, beverages) were imported at a total cost of$407 
million60  and demand is expected to increase substantially as the sector grows over time (see 
figure). The tourism sector ’s demand for inputs represents a major opportunity for local producers 
(Figure 49). But at the present time most of the goods are imported, given limitations in local 
supply. Resorts report61  a high willingness to purchase inputs locally and are prepared to pay a 
premium for fresh produce. Maldives is deemed to have potential for competitiveness in producing 
a number of agriculture and fishery goods,62  which are already being produced successfully, but 
in quantities still lower than demand.63  Local cooperatives and agricultural-focused islands64

Based on information collected during the preparation of this diagnostic through interviews and consultations with private sector

Ten crops have been selected by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries for high potential in achieving self-sufficiency. Applying 
other filters such as consistent and growing demand from the tourism industry, and a low barrier to entry for Maldivian producers 
yields a list that includes; bananas, papaya, coconuts, lettuce, cucumber, flowers and tuna amongst others.
For example, according to Ministry of Fisheries and Agriculture’s estimates (no country-wide statistics exist) local producers are 
deemed to produce around 400,000 kgs of bananas, a 52 percent of the estimated demand from resorts (755,000 kgs per year).
There are eight agricultural islands and various production cooperatives.

Opportunities for service-provision linkages more constrained. Most resorts own and operate all 
of their support services and ancillary functions65  due to factors including geo-spatial challenges 
and quality in service provision. Accordingly, opportunities may be limited to:

∫ A small number of services that Maldivians have a competitive advantage in providing, and 
are equally in demand by the tourism sector. These include authentic and cultural-heritage 
based excursions or handicraft. While all of these are fairly small-scale, the economic impact 
of better linkages for local communities is likely to be significant.

∫ Development of an ecosystem of service suppliers for the guesthouses niche. 

fisHeries

The fisheries sector is a critical contributing sector for the country’s national economy and forms 
the most important primary economic activity in almost all of the country’s inhabited islands. 
Before the development of tourism, fisheries was the most important industry and source of 
growth for Maldives and, to a large extent, fisheries remains an important reference in Maldives 
culture. Although the relative importance of the fisheries sector has declined since the late 1970s 
(due mainly to the rapid growth of tourism), its role in the Maldivian economy remains significant. 
Fisheries remain a large, source of employment (see below), the largest source of physical exports, 
one of the few local industries supplying the touristic resorts, and a major source of food supply 
for the local market. In 2011, it accounted directly for 1.4 percent of GDP and currently generates 
$110 million in export revenue.

Maldives has benefited in terms of both food security and trade. Along with the tourism sector, 
the productive fisheries sector has been a leader in the country’s growth and development. The 
fisheries sector has remained vital in terms of trade, employment and subsistence especially on 
islands not dominated by the tourism industry. With a fishing-fleet of about 800 national vessels66, 
close to 10,000 individual fishers and their families depend on fishing. In addition, fish is a staple 
food across the archipelago and it remains the main source of protein for the population, covering 
around 88 percent of the total animal protein intake (FAO, 2011). Maldives is among the highest fish 
consuming countries in the world67 ; 49 percent of the fish catch is consumed locally.68  Fish and 
fish products account for almost 98 percent of Maldives physical exports.

However, the industry is experiencing a declining trend (Figures 50 and 51 and Table 1). A 
marked decrease (-28 percent) in catch volumes between 2006 and 2013 has undermined the 
contribution of fisheries to GDP (-54 percent) and translated into rapidly decreasing employment 
in direct fishing activities (32 percent reduction between 2006 and 2013 69). While these figures 
do not include jobs in processing and ancillary industries, the reduction in direct employment is 
particularly concerning given the fact that fisheries represent the single most important source 
of jobs in many islands, especially those that are not close to the capital or touristic resorts. The 
reduction in women’s employment in fisheries is particularly dire; the increased mechanization 
of the fisheries has largely taken over the fish processing activities that were the foundation of 
female employment in this sector. Thus women’s work in fisheries has been phased out such that 
female employment is practically nil in this sector.69  In spite of these negative trends, the value of 
fisheries exports has increased over the same period, reflecting higher prices for fisheries exports 
and thus signaling the unrealized potential economic contribution that a more thriving fisheries 
industry could make to the country.

66 
The Maldivian government imposed the termination of foreign long-line licensing in May 2010.
67 
It is assessed that 341 kcal of fish are consumed per capita per day (FAO, 2011).
68 Worldwide, about a billion people rely on fish as their main source of animal proteins. About 20% of the world’s population derives at 
least one-fifth of its animal protein intake from fish, and some small island states depend almost exclusively on fish. WHO (2015)

Maldives fisheries sector benefits from high value stocks, but its recent trends highlight vulnerability 
to external factors. While the country benefits from access to vast fishing resources spread over 
90,000 sq. km of territorial waters, the bulk of fisheries catch (82 percent) is dominated by two 
types of tuna (skipjack and yellow fin), which are exported. The Maldivian tuna is considered as 
a premium product benefiting both from high quality fish stocks as well as sustainable fishing 
methods (pole and line). In 2013, 95 percent of the 130,000 tons of fish catch was tuna70 . The 
current fish catch consists of skipjack tuna (57 percent), yellowfin tuna (35 percent), and other

kinds of tuna (3 percent). Catches of skipjack tuna have decreased drastically over the 
past years due to a mix of factors including over fishing, higher fuel costs, temperature rise 
leading to change in schools aggregation and lack of more effective regional, eco-systemic 
management of the shared skipjack stock. Conversely, catches of yellowfin tuna are increasing 
thanks to its increasing price in foreign markets and the rapid growth of the hand-line fishery 
(Figures 52 and 53). Reef fish, which account for 16 percent of catch, are mainly used for 
internal consumption and supply to resorts. 

Governance deficiencies appear to have hampered the development of fisheries and their 
value to the economy. The market for skipjack tuna is controlled by a four processing licenses.71  
On the contrary, yellowfin tuna is not regulated through similar licenses. Interestingly, these 
two market segments have evolved in a very different manner. For skipjack tuna, the catch 
volumes have plummeted, the tuna is largely exported as raw commodity to intermediary 
markets and its export price is low and volatile. On the contrary, the (unlicensed) market for 
yellowfin tuna has a different pattern of development, with rapid growth in catch volume, 
development of 12 EU-certified processing facilities, which give it access to final markets, 
and a more stable and higher export price (estimated at 2.5 higher than that of skipjack tuna, 
Figure 54). Accordingly, governance issues seem to influence the development of fisheries, 
including the industry’s ability to reap the value of the country’s stocks and develop ancillary 
processing industries, as well as the levels of investment that the private sector undertakes 
in the fisheries industry. The very different development trends of the licensed and the 
unlicensed market segments call into question the need and/or the suitability of the current 
licensing framework for skipjack tuna. If licenses for processing are maintained, it appears 
necessary to revise the licensing process in order to ensure that: licenses are granted in a 
transparent and competitive manner, and; the selection criteria for licensees emphasizes 
technical and financial capabilities as well as fit-for-purpose considerations.

Environmentally friendly fishing methods for tuna have enhanced Maldives’ ability to access 
premium markets. The Maldivian pole-and-line fishery is one of the largest coastal fisheries in 
the Indian Ocean, and is estimated to account for 18-20 percent of the total catch of skipjack 
tuna in the region72 . The fishery received considerable attention as a potential model for coastal 
states, owing to both its commercial success and its adherence to ecological best practices. Pole-
and-line fishery has been promoted for its environmentally friendly nature73. That has enabled 
a pathway to the export-markets of Europe and allowed it to extract a premium compared to 
other similar fisheries. However, it is important to note that while pole and line fishing is deemed 
environmentally friendly due to low by-catch, it does not prevent over-fishing, which has indeed 
been a problem (see below).

However, the sustainability of fisheries is jeopardized by inadequate fisheries management. Tuna 
and reef fisheries are either fully or over-exploited and catches are stagnating or declining as 
mentioned above. Destructive fishing methods (especially for reef fish) and over-exploitation of reef 
fish74  also raise issues of sustainability. This is mostly due to sub-optimal fisheries management, 
environmental change resulting in increased sea surface temperature, and the estimated high 
levels of illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing in the Exclusive Economic Zone. Development 
and management of capture fisheries is governed by the Fisheries Law of Maldives. However, the 
emphasis of the law is mainly on protecting local fishers and the sovereignty of Maldivian waters, 
with less consideration of fisheries management. Other than two tuna fisheries, there are currently 
few management measures in place for the local harvesting sector. Some important steps have, 
however, already been undertaken: a fisheries licensing scheme75  was introduced in 2010, and 
the Environmental Protection and Conservation Act contains provisions to limit fishing for the 
conservation of biological diversity through 33 protected areas and natural reserves.

In 2012, the Maldivian skipjack tuna fishery successfully completed the process of official certification by the Marine Stewardship 
Council (MSC) recognizing the best practice nature of this fishery.
The sustainability of reef fish is threatened by three factors, namely: a) the tuna fishery in Maldives is heavily dependent on the 
coral reefs for bait. For every 7-10 kg of tuna caught, a kilogram of live bait is required, suggesting a bait conversion ratio of 8:1 on 
average; b) anecdotal evidence identifies negative impacts of bait fishing on the ecosystem due to removal of juvenile reef fish and 
on physical environment due to anchoring pole-and-line boats in coral areas; and c) demand for reef fish has increased threefold 
in the last 15 years with the increasing demand coming from tourist resorts and export industry. Source: Marine Research Centre,

as tourism.

Overfishing of reef fish is a risk to the sustainability of the tuna fisheries as well as tourism. The 
sustainability of reef fish is threatened by three factors: (1) The tuna fishery in Maldives is heavily 
dependent on the coral reefs for bait. For every 7-10 kg of tuna caught, a kilogram of live bait is 
required, suggesting a bait conversion ratio of 8:1 on average76 ; (2) anecdotal evidence identifies 
negative impacts of bait fishing on the ecosystem due to removal of juvenile reef fish and on 
physical environment due to anchoring pole-and-line boats in coral areas; and (3) demand for 
reef fish has increased threefold77  in the last 15 years, with the increasing demand coming from 
tourist resorts and export industry. While there are no reliable statistics to validate over-fishing of 
reef fisheries, if overfished the health of the coral reef ecosystem (a major touristic attraction) can 
be significantly affected. If unchecked, there is a high potential of over-fishing, which could result 
in exhausting of stocks as experienced for giant clam fishery in 199078  and the near collapse of 
sea cucumber fishery in 1997. Fishery bans were imposed on black coral, giant clams in 1991, 
turtles in 1995 and sharks in 2010. However, there is little adequate monitoring to ensure the 
effectiveness of these bans.

The sustainability of fisheries is also threatened by climate change. Climate change impacts such 
as dilution of seawater with the sea level rise and higher temperatures can result in the mortality 
of corals. Changes in surface water temperature and ocean acidification can compromise the 
calcification potential of coral reefs due to changes in the association between corals and their 
symbiotic micro-organisms; hence, result in slow growth and productivity.79  Coral reefs are made 
further vulnerable due to dependency of reproduction on environmental conditions. Similarly, tuna 
is highly attuned to the biophysical conditions of the pelagic environment, particularly El Nino 
Southern Oscillation and associated changes in surface sea temperatures. Recent observations 
of changes in tuna aggregation and migration patterns observed is partly attributed to the rising 
ocean temperatures and ocean acidification that are altering marine ecosystems and impacting 
the fish distribution. Tuna movement and abundance in the Indian Ocean is closely linked to the 
climate-change-driven ocean productivity.80  

Threats to the health of the coral reefs that are significant to the fishery sector also come from 
habitat degradation and loss due to pollution, harbor construction and reclamation. However, the 
extent of the damage that these activities inflict on the health of coral reefs and marine species 
has not been quantified (see also section on environmental sustainability).

In light of declining trends in the capture fisheries, marine aquaculture is nascent in Maldives and 
can be an important source of economic growth and diversification, poverty alleviation and foreign 
exchange earnings. With a view to diversifying the country’s fisheries sector, the government has 
been implementing pilot aquaculture projects for a decade with pearl oysters, Maldivian clownfish, 
and brown marbled groupers. A private aquaculture farm is also producing sea cucumbers,

producing the larvae in hatcheries before growing them in mangroves and lagoons. The future 
development of aquaculture is however hindered by limited availability of financing and technology. 
Operators are also expressing the need to better define the legal and policy framework to clarify 
the business environment, develop the value-chains and facilitate longer-term investments and 
research.

Maldives produces less than an estimated 10 percent of its food requirements, reaching self-
sufficiency in fish only. All other staples are imported (Figure 55). As a result, food items account 
for 21 percent of imports81 . Food imports are required not only to meet domestic food demand 
for the Maldivian people but are also essential to cater to the tourism industry in Maldives. Outside 
of Malé, fishing and subsistence agriculture are the main sources of food security and livelihoods 
for the vast majority of the people. Except for coconut and fresh tuna, 90 percent of all food items 
are imported. 

Food security concerns have revitalized interest in the development of the local agriculture 
production. Import dependency, limited storage facilities and ad hoc distribution pose food 
security risks. In response to the recent food and fuel crises, Maldives has integrated food security 
considerations into national planning. It has removed tariffs on imported food items, agricultural 
inputs and fuel, and is looking for ways to intensify and diversify agriculture and fisheries. The 
government is working with international agencies and private-sector partners to develop 
agriculture by introducing new and innovative techniques and technology to strengthen the 
contribution of farming to rural development. 

Agriculture is a relatively minor activity in Maldives and has contributed only marginally to long-
term growth. Agriculture accounts for 1.7 percent of GDP (even though its value has grown in real 
terms over the past 20 years). Agriculture has traditionally been undertaken as subsistence crops 
in 12 atolls, and only recently higher volume production has been developed (Figure 56). 

Maldives total land area is around 30,000 hectares of which 4,000 hectares are estimated to be 
arable. In 2013, approximately 50 islands large enough to support commercial agriculture activity 
had been leased for agricultural production, spanning a total area of about 1,300 hectares. 
Bananas, coconuts, fresh fruits and vegetables (papaya, eggplant, melons, pineapple and chilies) 
are the main commercial crops produced locally in Maldives.

Maldives, however, faces a number of structural challenges and resource constraints that will limit 
the country’s potential for agriculture development. Arable land is extremely limited and scattered 
among many locations, inhibiting the horizontal expansion of farming areas and the achievement 
of economies of scale. Soils are generally infertile or unsuitable for productive agriculture, requiring 
high levels of supplemental fertilization. Fresh water resources for irrigation purposes are limited 
and new irrigation technologies and technologies to desalinize seawater for agriculture production 
purposes may be prohibitively costly. Start-up investments in high-tech agriculture, including 
production facilities, storage and transport infrastructure, and the associated economic risks are 
high as well. Ensuring predictable product quantities from smallholder producers and ensuring 
product quality that meet expectations and standards of resorts will be challenging. Public R&D 
and extension support systems will be costly to establish domestically (as opposed to R&D 
systems in fisheries where the potential for expansion and take by private sector is significantly 
larger). Given these constraints, Maldives will remain dependent on imports (and vulnerable to the 
associated risk of price shocks) for most if its food demand into the future.

There are however, a number of opportunities to capitalize on agriculture for local income growth. 
Though no official data exist, the linkages between local agricultural production and the tourism 
industry are still limited. Anecdotal evidence suggests that concerns on volume, quality and reliability 
of local production significantly reduce the incentives for resorts to source agricultural produce 
locally, in favor of imports. In spite of that, market participants from both supply and demand 
consider that there may be potential to further and more systematically exploit comparative local 
advantage in the production of various fruits and vegetables to cater to the resorts (see section on 
tourism). Such an emphasis may also have the added benefit of increasing women’s employment, 
since agriculture has a predominantly female labor force (women represent 60 percent of total 
employment in agriculture). Currently, mostly bananas, melons, papaya are produced locally for 
resorts but it may be worthwhile to analyze more systematically what other high-value fruits and 
vegetable are suitable for cultivation. 

In addition to broadening production choices and testing cultivation feasibility of a larger pool of 
fruits and vegetables, the feasibility of low-cost smallholder greenhouse technologies combined 
with household based-irrigation/ ‘fertigation’82 systems could be explored. Producer groups or 
cooperatives of smallholders could help to bundle extension and marketing/ branding support, 
including the operating of local collection, grading, cooling and storage facilities, as well as 
transport to markets or consumers. Most likely, direct marketing arrangements between producer 
groups and selected resorts will be the most viable model for high-value agriculture. Corporate 
Social Responsibility schemes of international resort brands to promote community-based 
organic agriculture could be explored with support from and in partnership with specialized NGOs 
and government. Although there might be potential to strengthen the linkages between local 
producers and the tourism sector through such arrangements, local producers will continue to 
face production risks, as well as demand fluctuations due to the seasonality of tourist arrivals.

key Messages
Constraints to growth and shared prosperity include:
∫ Challenging investment climate constraining creation of new firms and growth of existing 
ones
∫ Limitations in access to finance reduce the ability of the private sector to grow
∫ Governance shortcomings undermine the ability of the private sector to grow in a 
sustainable and equitable manner and have hampered the ability of Maldives to maximize 
the benefits from its natural resources as a foundation for shared growth
∫ Limitations of education sector and mismatch between supply and demand for skills. 
∫ High, unsustainable and increasingly regressive social spending

sTrUCTUral ConsTrainTs 

The geography and population dispersion in Maldives creates a unique set of structural constraints, 
beyond those experienced by other small island states. In line with other small island states, size 
challenges limit Maldives’ production base and competitiveness (Box 4). The country is vulnerable 
to external shocks. In fact, the volatility of its GDP growth is among the highest of all countries in 
the world (Box 3). Similarly, Maldives has a narrow economic base (tourism and fisheries), and the 
small size of the economy limits its ability to sustainably develop local production of other goods 
or services, enhancing its reliance on imports. While the tourism resort industry is able to access 
foreign capital through FDI and borrowing, most other sectors are not, thereby further limiting 
their ability to grow. Beyond that, as opposed to many small island states, which are composed of 
a single island, Maldives is a widely dispersed multi-island state with population disperse among 
more than 190 inhabited islands. 

As an illustration, island transport facilities are limited leading to high inter-island transport 
costs and limited connectivity. Maldives’ islands are dispersed within 90,000 square kilometers of 
territorial waters. As of 2005 only 105 inhabited islands (58 percent of all inhabited islands) had 
adequate harbor and access facilities.83  As of 2011, 25 islands still had no harbor facilities.84  To 
illustrate this point further, while transporting a 20-foot container from Singapore to Male would 
cost about $1,200, the cost for transporting building materials to an island would be about the 
same ($1,000-1,100) with additional costs incurred due to lack of jetty facilities in some of the 
islands.85

structurally high.

As a result of these challenges, the cost of providing basic services in a fragmented country is 
raised across the board, and public expenditure in Maldives is structurally high. Maldives’ public 
spending is well above the level predicted for countries with a similar GDP per capita, although a 
number of other highly dispersed island states (Kiribati, Micronesia, Marshall Islands and Solomon 
Islands) have an even higher level of public spending (Figure 57). Indeed, when taking into account 
its small size (leading to relatively high fixed costs of government), its insularity (a scattered 
population across an archipelago increases the marginal cost of service delivery), the duality of 
its economy (using taxing and spending to redistribute resort rents) and its openness (larger 
government provides insurance against volatile incomes), Maldives moves closer to but still above 
the predicted level of spending.

The small and dispersed population presents the country with a public service and infrastructure 
dilemma. With its population dispersed over many islands across long distances, the country 
faces the choice whether to address the challenge of the high cost of service delivery through 
consolidation of population closer to Malé or through improving services and connectivity to 
populations at their current locations. Each choice will generate different demands on public 
services such as health, education and infrastructure, and will require a strengthening public 
investment management capacity.

box 4. small states challenges
More than 40 countries have a population under 1.5 million, out of which 26 are small island states. 
These countries vary greatly in their level of development and the size of their economies. They 
are also spread out geographically, with most of them clustered in the Caribbean, the Pacific and 
in Africa. Despite their diversity, these countries share a common set of development challenges.

size
Vulnerability to economic shocks and income volatility. Because of the small size of their 
economies, growth strategies in small states rely on foreign markets. A high degree of openness 
however means that they are heavily exposed to external shocks in global markets. Moreover, their 
narrow resource base and small domestic markets prevent small economies from diversifying 
into a wide range of activities, making them more vulnerable to terms of trade shocks. When one 
dominant activity declines, it has an impact throughout the economy, exposing the population 
to income volatility that can create additional hardships as the poorest are less able to weather 
shocks to their incomes. Government revenues are also volatile because they rely more heavily 
on taxing imports as a source of revenue. As tariffs are reduced, so is the government’s income.

Limited capacity. Because of their size, small states are traditionally face challenges in training 
and retaining the right skills in the public sector. They also tend to have larger public sectors 
than other countries. In some states, a widely scattered population adds to the challenge. Small 
states also lack sufficient institutional capacity to participate fully in international fora, which can 
profoundly affect their economies.

Difficulty accessing external capital. Access to global capital markets is important for small states, 
and is one way to compensate for adverse shocks and income volatility. But private markets tend 
to see small states as more risky than larger countries, so spreads are higher and market access 
is more difficult.

geography
Limited competitiveness. Three out of four of developing small states are islands or widely 
dispersed multi-island states; others are land-locked, and some are located far from major 
markets. Their remoteness and isolation make it difficult and costly for these states to access 
world markets to compensate for small domestic markets — a situation that increases the cost of 
intermediated inputs and imports and prevents efficiency and innovation. Domestic competition 
is also limited, which hampers successful development.

78

Susceptibility to natural disasters and climate change. Most small states are vulnerable 
to climate-change-related impacts and natural disasters such as hurricanes, cyclones, 
droughts, and volcanic eruptions that typically affect an entire population and economy. The 
impact on the government’s finances can be overwhelming, limiting a country’s ability to 
build cushions for development programs and future needs.

A combination of a narrow production of export base combined with a vulnerability to shocks 
can to lead to persistent fiscal and external imbalances and high levels of debt. Indeed, 
among the 20 countries with the highest levels of public debt relative to GDP, small island 
states account for 10 countries, and other small states for another three.

Meanwhile, there has been a steady migration of smaller to larger islands, in particular to the Malé 
City area. Internal migration has happened for a long time, often in response to natural disasters, 
including the 2004 tsunami, the difference in the cost of living (the high cost of food and other 
goods and services in the atolls compared to Malé),86  quality of service delivery, and economic 
opportunities. Recent data shows a net decline of population in many small islands; indeed, all 
islands that lost population between 2006 and 2014 had a population below 3,000 in 2006 (Figure 
58). During that period Malé and Hulhumalé saw increases in population of 37 percent (by 34,524) 
and 450 percent (by 12,903), respectively (see also section on Poverty).

PoPulation trends

Net decline of population 

in small islands from 2006-2014

37% increase in Malé Population
450% increase in Hulhumalé Population

Conditions of overcrowding in Malé show that there are limits to centering activity on Malé. 
Between 2003 and 2010 household expenditure on housing, water and electricity in Malé more 
than doubled, and overtook food and beverages as the single largest expenditure item. Between 
2010 and 2013, the number of vehicles in Malé increased by 23 percent, and currently there are 
about 36 vehicles per 100 inhabitants in Malé compared to 5.5 in the atolls excluding Addu City and 
Hulhumalé. As noted earlier, Malé’s population density of 53,700 per square kilometer puts it well 
ahead of large, densely populated cities, such as Mumbai and Dhaka (Footnote 3). 

Successive governments, including the current one, tried to address the structural constraints, 
while attempting to stem the net migration into Malé, through various programs of investment 
and voluntary resettlement programs. The current government’s party manifesto for 2013-17 
pledged to address these issues through a number of actions, including:87  

∫ Malé City area.88 Reduce congestion in Malé, develop Hulhumalé as a modern cosmopolitan city, 
construct bridges to link different parts of Malé City area, develop Thilafushi as an industrial 
zone.

∫ Housing. Provide social housing and loans to renovate housing.

∫ 

Infrastructure. Establish adequate harbors in islands, establish effective sewerage systems, 
ensure safe drinking water through desalination plants for islands with large populations and 
increased water storage capacity.

∫ Reliable transport. Construct airport in islands and connecting ferry services, establish 
permanent system to enable transport of agricultural produce between islands. 

∫ Special Economic Zones. Establish SEZs for tourism, business incubation, free ports, ICT, etc., 
granting special incentives including exemptions from Goods and Services Tax for 10 years, 
Business Profit Tax and Import Duty.89  

In particular, Hulhumalé, an artificial island off Malé, has been constructed to relieve congestion in 
Malé and to attract residents from islands with small populations. Reclamation of 188 hectares of 
land and primary development took place between 1997 and 2004, leading to a population of just 
over 1,000. A resident population of 60,000 is targeted by 2020.90  The next phase of development 
consists of a further reclamation of 240 hectares, catering to a population of 100,000.91   The 
president recently issued a call to residents of islands with small populations to migrate, as the 
government is unable to meet the socio-economic needs of small islands.92 

Beyond structural constraints, a number of shortcomings associated with investment climate, 
access to finance, governance and human capital restrict the potential for existing economic 
activities in Maldives to grow and for new ones to be created. 

invesTMenT CliMaTe 

The investment climate in Maldives features important constraints for new entrepreneurs and for 
the growth of existing firms. The investment climate in Maldives is much more challenging than 
that of similar island economies and other South Asian countries. In 2015 Maldives ranked 116th 
in the World Bank’s Doing Business ranking (out of 189 economies ranked). This ranking was two 
places lower than the previous year, signaling a lower conduciveness of the investment climate in 
the country as compared to other economies ranked. According to Doing Business rankings (Figure 
59), while it is relatively easy to register a new firm in Maldives, there are significant deficiencies 
in the enabling environment for that firm to start operations (register property, obtain electricity 
connection, access finance), to grow its business (access finance, import and export) and to 
resolve disputes or unwind operations in an orderly, swift and fair manner (enforce contracts, 
protect investors and resolve insolvency). A comparison with other small island states highlights 
the significantly higher challenges across the board in the investment climate in Maldives.

However, it is important to highlight the fact that the business environment obstacles faced by 
firms in Maldives go beyond those areas identified by global indicators such as Doing Business. 
Enterprises interviewed during the preparation of this diagnostic identified various other obstacles 
in the investment climate in Maldives, including difficulties in accessing foreign currency,93  that 
limit the ability of firms to operate, invest in foreign capital goods and trade. Other factors cited by 
firms include sudden changes in the legal and regulatory environment taking place in absence of 
sufficient consultation with private-sector stakeholders.

There are major gaps in the legal framework governing activities of private enterprise. A number 
of issues have been identified94  that restrict the effectiveness of the legal framework governing 
firms’ activities, including: 

∫ The need to define basic legal foundations of a system of commercial justice in order to 
reduce legal uncertainly. Courts function without a complete and adequate set of legal rules; 
enforcement mechanisms were found to be non-functional; the system of appeals was 
deemed to generate long delays; and there is lack of technical expertise and knowledge of 
business concepts. There are no alternative dispute resolution mechanisms in place.

∫ 

 Lack of clarity concerning legal sources further undermines legal certainty. The position of 
Sharia law in the private law system has not been fully established; it is unclear whether the 
laws governing commercial activities and Sharia law are compatible. 

∫ Lack of basic regulation in the area of secured transactions and registration of rights. Legislation 
regulating financial distress and insolvency was found to be incomplete and outdated. This was 
also the case with a number of basic private law regulations, including contract law, tort law 
and statute of limitations. In turn, the lack of adequate laws governing secured transactions 
severely undermines the ability of the financial sector to provide credit to enterprises, as it 
enhances the risk of losses in case of borrowers’ defaults due to unpredictable, lengthy and 
costly legal resolution. These deficiencies contribute to reducing the availability of credit, 
increasing its cost and enhancing the amount of collateral required by lenders.

93 

The apparent contradiction with the observation that there seems to be sufficient liquidity in the market (IMF, 2015) could be due to 
the timing of the reports or to the difference between macro and micro observations.
94 World Bank (2013f)

The large state 
presence in 
economic activities 
is not only a fiscal 
sustainability 
concern, but it also 
undermines the 
ability of the private 
sector to flourish by 
crowding it out of 
large segments of 
the market.

Maldives has been 
able to attract large 
volumes of FDI to 
tourism, but it has

economy

∫ Competition law and industrial property law are missing in Maldives. These are key elements 
of the legal framework needed in order to ensure a level playing field and fair treatment of 
investors. The absence of these laws likely undermines the ability of Maldives to attract and 
retain investment beyond tourism.

Addressing investment climate shortcomings will be essential in order to enable the creation of 
inclusive economic activities in Maldives. Evidence worldwide demonstrates95  that investment 
climate hurdles reduce incentives for entrepreneurship, reduce the attractiveness of the country 
as investment destination, foster informality and significantly affect the competitiveness of 
enterprises. So far, in spite of the investment climate shortcomings, Maldives has been able 
to develop a tourism industry leveraging the uniqueness of its natural resources. However, 
investment climate deficiencies have played a significant role96  in preventing the development 
of an ecosystem of local enterprises around tourism as suppliers of goods and services. That, in 
turn, has translated into the current model whereby tourism remains largely an enclave industry. 
Investment climate shortcomings also undermine the ability of the country to diversify its economy 
through creation of new firms in new economic activities. 

Governance issues contribute negatively to development of the private sector in Maldives. The 
large state presence in economic activities (through SOEs) is not only a fiscal sustainability 
concern, but it also undermines the ability of the private sector to flourish by crowding it out of 
large segments of the market. This is demonstrated by a large number of SOEs that are mostly 
loss-making (paragraphs 54 and 89), the large size of public workforce (Figure 35) that may lead 
to higher reservation wages on the part of the domestic labor force (section on Human Capital), 
and large public-sector borrowing that may be crowding out the private sector (paragraph 161). 
This, together with the governance issues affecting tourism and fisheries (paragraphs 113 and 
130), contribute to create a set of significant challenges to private enterprises that go beyond the 
difficulties stemming from business regulation bottlenecks.

investMent cliMate and fdi

Maldives has been able to attract large volumes of FDI to tourism, but it has had limited 
positive spillovers to the economy (Figure 59). The uniqueness of Maldives’ natural resources 
has enabled the country to attract large (and frequently lumpy) amounts of FDI (Figure 60) in 
spite of shortcomings in the investment climate. However, FDI inflows have been largely focused 
on development of single-island resorts, with a very limited proportion reaching sectors of the 
economy that are associated with networks of production. In turn, this has contributed to the 
current enclave model of the tourism industry. Going forward, as the country seeks to foster 
economic diversification through foreign and local investment, its ability to attract FDI into other 
industries or sectors will likely be affected by investment climate challenges.

95 World Bank (2015c)
96 
Anecdotal evidence collected through interviews and consultations with stakeholders undertaken during the preparation of the SCD 
coincide on the view that investment climate shortcomings have had a major negative impact on entrepreneurship in Maldives. 
However, the lack of statistics including recent business surveys significantly limit the ability to substantiate these views. 

83

Recent events have the potential to undermine the confidence of foreign investors on Maldives 
and reduce its competitiveness as a long-term investment destination in favor of jurisdictions that 
can provide a higher degree of certainty to foreign investors. A recent survey of global investors  
identified the main factors that drive selection of investment destinations. After macroeconomic 
stability, the second most important factor for global investors97  when selecting an investment 
destination is political risk98. Recent events in Maldives – including civil disturbances in Malé;,a 
high-profile dispute related to a contract for investment in the international airport, and anecdotal 
evidence reported in international media of radicalization and urban violence – have the potential 
to undermine the attractiveness of Maldives to foreign investments, including PPPs.

aCCess To finanCe ConsTrainTs

Access to finance has been identified as a major constraint for the development of enterprises in 
Maldives. A World Bank survey of enterprises99  in Maldives in 2005 found that 66 percent of firms 
identified access to finance as the most significant constraint to firms’ growth. While these figures 
are admittedly old, other recent statistics and anecdotal evidence suggests that the situation has 
not improved since then. Indeed, a business survey by Ministry of Finance in 2013 found that up to 
70 percent of companies in manufacturing have difficulties accessing finance (Figure 61). Similarly, 
views expressed by private-sector participants during interviews and consultations undertaken 
during the preparation of this diagnostic highlighted significant difficulties in accessing finance, 
which restricts their ability to make long-term capital investments as well as to finance working 
capital requirements for day-to-day business (Figure 62). 

Financing to the private sector has been lower than the pace of economic growth. Credit to the 
private sector as a proportion of GDP decreased from 69 percent in 2008 to 44 percent in 2013, a 
proportion that is much lower than that of economies with similar income level (Figure 63). These 
economy-wide aggregate figures support private-sector stakeholders’ perception of a narrowing 
availability of financing to private enterprises and entrepreneurs beyond tourism.

credit to the 

Private sector

And some sectors of the economy are more affected than others. As discussed above, while 
70 percent of manufacturing firms surveyed reportedly have difficulties accessing bank credit, 
this proportion is much lower for other sectors such as construction (50 percent) and trade (32 
percent). None of the firms in tourism surveyed reported difficulties in accessing finance. This is 
consistent with the breakdown of banks’ credit portfolio, which is highly concentrated in tourism 
and, to a lesser extent, in commerce, while tradable sectors account for a marginal proportion of 
bank loans (4 percent for fisheries, 2 percent for manufacturing and 0.1 percent for agriculture). 
Moreover, credit growth has recently been driven by lending to real estate and commerce, while 
credit to tradable sectors has decreased substantially since 2007 (Figures 64 and 65). A breakdown 
of banks’ portfolios by size of the borrower is not available, but anecdotal evidence suggests that 
large enterprises (both public and private) enjoy easier access to bank credit than SMEs and small 
entrepreneurs.

High collateralization requirements represent major hurdles to borrowers. Companies surveyed in 
2006100  reportedly were required by banks to post collateral amounting to more than 150 percent 
of the value of the loan on average101 . Views collected through interviews and consultations during 
the preparation of this diagnostic confirm that high collateral requirements still represent a 
significant obstacle to credit, especially for SMEs and new entrepreneurs. 

Lack of access to finance has been identified by authorities as a major obstacle for entrepreneurship 
in Maldives, but this challenge will not be resolved through concessional credit. Enhancing access 
to finance for entrepreneurs is one of the priority areas under the Government Manifesto as well 
as in the draft National Development Strategy. The government’s 2009-2013 National Strategic 
Action Plan also recommended that the government provide women with self-help grants for 
small- and medium-sized enterprises and promote microcredit programs. This focus was intended 
to help bridge the disadvantage women face in accessing credit. For instance, in 2011 only one-
third of the Bank of Maldives borrowers for development schemes or loans and advances were 
women.102  In response to the lack of access to finance for entrepreneurs overall in Maldives, the 
government had put in place a program to provide financing to young entrepreneurs. The program 
(GETSET) considered the provision of non-collateralized loans with subsidized interest rates. While 
the ultimate objective of the program (enhancing access to finance for entrepreneurs) is laudable, 
it does not address the shortcomings limiting the adequate functioning of the financial sector 
and thus does not represent a lasting or sustainable solution to the needs of enterprises and 
entrepreneurs. On the contrary, concessional directed lending programs often aggravate access 
to finance deficiencies by helping erode the credit culture in the population, reducing incentives 
for established commercial lenders to innovate, and crowding out the financial sector by creating 
dependence of entrepreneurs on subsidized interest rates.

ability of Maldives 
to maximize the 
benefits from its 
natural resources 
as a foundation for 
shared growth.

Sustainable enhancement of access to finance in Maldives will require the development and 
implementation of a strategy for financial sector development that addresses the shortcomings 
faced by the sector. The factors limiting the willingness and ability of financial intermediaries to 
provide credit on a sustainable and fair basis to the various sectors of the private sector are wide-
ranging. Included in Table 2 is a list of shortcomings that have been identified in the past103  that 
illustrate the range of challenges facing the sector, including deficiencies in the legal framework 
governing credit activities, shortcomings in credit infrastructure and underdeveloped financial 
institutions. However, this list is not exhaustive and additional factors may be at play. Enhanced 
public-private dialogue between all stakeholders (authorities, financial institutions and borrowers) 
will be needed in order to further identify obstacles and opportunities, as well as to prioritize 
actions. These issues are addressed in more detail in Annex 3.

GovernanCe ConsTrainTs 

Maldives is facing important governance challenges that affect the business environment and the 
soundness and sustainability of economic and fiscal management. Overall, an indeterminate but 
significant connection between a few parties and the political system – related to the absence of 
basic legislation in many areas, including procurement – and a lack of legal clarity weigh on the 
economic activity. In particular, a significant amount of procurement in the country is carried out 
by SOEs and the Ministry of Health outside the scope of national rules and central government 
controls, leading to doubts about whether public resources are spent in the most effective and 
efficient manner. In the public sector, limited capacity, a complex institutional framework, and 
inter-institutional conflicts also limit the ability of the state to support social and economic 
progress. Institutional capacity remains much lower than that of an average upper middle-income 
country. 

Governance deficiencies have hampered the ability of Maldives to maximize the benefits from its 
natural resources as a foundation for shared growth. Significant governance constraints appear 
to have undermined the development of the two main industries in the country (tourism and 
fisheries). These shortcomings appear to have translated into sub-optimal investment, unrealized 
potential for job creation and loss revenues for the government (see tourism and fisheries 
sections). Deficiencies include: lack of transparency in allocation of licenses for exploitation of 
natural resources; suboptimal selection of licensees, and: lack of mechanisms to minimize conflict 
of interest (see paragraphs sections on tourism and fisheries). 

Public-sector management suffers from inefficiencies. The public sector plays an important role 
in Maldives’ overall economic model in redistributing some of the rents generated by the resort 
sector to the rest of the population. This is done both through transfers and directly in the form 
of relatively large public employment in both civil administration and state-owned enterprises. 
In both cases there are significant inefficiencies that undermine both the effectiveness of the 

103 World Bank, (2011a)

87

Maldives Systematic Country Diagnostic5. constraints to Growth and sharEd prospErity (contd.)

redistributive model and the fulfillment of public-sector functions in service provision and 
regulation. With civil service skewed towards relatively young workers, its effectiveness is far lower 
than what might be expected of a middle-income country. Public financial management suffers 
from inadequate accounting and poor cost controls.

The unsettled political and institutional framework impairs the state’s effectiveness. Maldives has 
been undergoing a contentious political transition for the past 10 years. The 2008 Constitution 
created an extensive set of governance institutions and confrontational elections characterized 
by interference of state bodies that has undermined credibility. Branches of government and 
independent commissions are frequently in conflict, reflecting the interests of individuals in what 
is a sharply divided polity. The lack of political and institutional settlement diverts the attention 
of the state from carrying out public-sector functions and prompts decision-making driven to an 
unusual degree by short-term political issues. 

This has led in particular to weak rule of law. Maldives’ legal system is based on several foundations, 
including both common law and the sharia, with lack of harmonization evident in much legislation, 
particularly for commercial activity. There are fundamental gaps in law, including: the lack of a civil 
procedure code; seemingly non-functional enforcement mechanisms; a system of appeals that 
generates long delays, and; weak capacity among judges, particularly on commercial matters. 
Uncertainties about the legal framework are amplified by the diverse legal backgrounds of judges 
(all judicial education is obtained outside of Maldives), which leads to inconsistency in adjudication. 
More generally, while the 2008 Constitution provided grounds for strong independence of the 
judiciary, the composition of the judicial service commission has led to strong politicization of 
the courts according to many observers (most notably the UN Special Rapporteur on Judicial 
Independence). The judiciary has been highly proactive in recent political and electoral disputes. 

HUMan CaPiTal ConsTrainTs

Expanding and improving human capital will be of vital importance to promote economic prosperity 
and increase jobs for young people. The country ranked only 103rd in the Human Development 
Index for 2014, which is low for a middle-income country approaching $9,900 GNI per capita. 

Maldives has performed well in providing access to primary and lower secondary education, but 
there is room for improvement. The primary gross enrollment rate is 104 percent and the primary 
net enrollment rate 99 percent. The lower secondary gross enrollment rate is 107 percent (Figure 
66), while the lower secondary net rate is 82 percent. This suggests that, while participation in 
primary and lower secondary education is high, there is considerable grade repetition and early/
late entry, especially in lower secondary education. The country needs to improve the internal 
efficiency of the education system.

There are 
fundamental gaps 
in law, including: 
the lack of a civil 
procedure code; 
non-functional 
enforcement 
mechanisms; a 
system of appeals 
that generates long 
delays, and; weak 
capacity among 
judges, particularly 
on commercial 
matters.

The country lags sharply behind in education attainment at the higher secondary level. The 
gross higher secondary net enrollment rate is about 35 percent (Figure 67). This is very low by 
international standards. The average higher secondary gross enrollment rate for middle-income 
countries is 61 percent, and for upper middle-income countries 76 percent. The main reason for 
the low enrollment in higher secondary education in Maldives is the limited number of schools that 
offered grades 11-12 until recently, although almost each atoll has at least one school providing 
higher secondary education. The government has now expanded this number to 51 schools: three 
schools in Malé and 48 schools in the atolls (Figure 67). Many of these schools are over-crowded 
and congested and require more facilities and equipment. In addition, higher secondary schools 
require greater management and leadership capability, and the professional development of 
teachers. At present, the higher secondary school system relies heavily on human resources from 
overseas.

Higher education participation is extremely low for a middle-income country. The gross higher 
education enrollment rate is only about 6 percent in Maldives, (Figure 67) whereas the gross 
higher education enrollment rate for middle-income countries is around 30 percent. The low 
proportion of Maldivians with higher education qualifications means that the country lacks 
sufficient professionals, managers and technical experts to support economic growth and social 
development. The main reasons for the low enrollment in higher education are: (1) the small 
number of students completing higher secondary education and moving onto higher education; 

89

and (2) limited access to higher education in the country. Higher education is mainly provided 
by Maldives National University (MNU) and about seven private higher education institutions. 
However, over 85 percent of enrollment in these private higher education institutions is actually in 
pre-degree level diploma and certificate programs. A considerable proportion of enrollment in the 
MNU, too, is in pre-degree level qualifications.

The quality of education at all levels is a major challenge facing Maldives, both in terms of inputs 
and outcomes. The teacher-student ratio varies between 6 (Vaavu Atoll) and 16 (Malé), but lower 
teacher-student ratios tend to be associated with a larger share of untrained teachers (Figure 68). 
At the same time, learning outcomes in primary and secondary education are low. The average score 
for English among students at grade 4 is just 32 percent, and the average score for mathematics 
only 39 percent. At grade 7 the average score for English is merely 29 percent, while the average 
score for mathematics is just 30 percent. These very low averages show that learning levels in both 
primary and lower secondary education are weak. There are also substantial regional disparities 
(Figure 69). Learning outcomes are considerably higher in Malé than in the atolls, especially in a 
subject such as English language, which is vitally important for employment in a tourism-based 
economy. The low levels of cognitive skills results in poor performance of students at national 
examinations. For instance, at the General Certificate of Examinations (GCE O/L) only about 40 
percent students pass in five subjects, while just 19 percent students pass in eight subjects.

High youth unemployment is linked with skills deficiencies. The share of the labor force ages 15-
24 without work but available for and seeking employment was 27 percent in 2013. The average 
youth unemployment rate for upper middle-income countries is 14 percent. Due to the lack of 
well-educated Maldivians the country also faces a severe shortage of qualified personnel for 
technical, and middle and senior management, jobs. According to private-sector stakeholders 
consulted during the preparation of this diagnostic (Annex 2), the above-mentioned deficiencies 
in “soft skills” together with shortcomings in technical and vocational education contribute to the 
high level of expatriate workers, especially for up-market tourism and commercial and financial 
activities. 

The quality of existing TVET services needs to be improved so that it becomes both more attractive 
for youth and more relevant for employers. The government has established the Technical and 
Vocational Education Program (TVET) with aim of creating a skilled workforce that meets labor 
market demands. The program has been diversified to offer training in hospitality and tourism, 
construction and building, agriculture, electrical wiring and engineering and handicrafts. There 
are more than 80 training providers in the country. However, the quality of these TVET programs 
is considered limited and youth graduating with technical and vocational qualifications can face 
lengthy job search periods. Another important constraint is that technical and vocational education 
and training is considered an inferior option to academic qualifications by Maldivian youth, so that 
the demand for TVET is limited. The education and training system has not yet developed career 
guidance and counseling to help youth identify their aptitudes and talents, nor a method to stream 
students into knowledge and/or skills-based programs depending on these aptitudes and talents. 
One possible experiment that could be further studied in this regard is the Ministry of Education’s 
UFAA program, which attempts to connect high schools, counselors and employers, and provide 
at-risk youth the technical and soft skills to enhance employability.

The gap between youth aspirations for employment and the actual opportunities for employment 
needs to be addressed. The rapidity of economic growth for Maldives has altered the perceptions of 
the ‘ideal’ desired job for today’s youth. Qualitative data reveal that young educated Maldivian men

Due to the lack 
of well-educated 
Maldivians the 
country also faces a 
severe shortage of 
qualified personnel 
for technical, and 
middle and senior 
management, jobs.

The quality of 
existing TVET 
services needs to be 
improved so that it 
becomes both more 
attractive for youth 
and more relevant 
for employers.

and women – and their households – aspire to white-collar, high-paying jobs and are unwilling to 
settle for the perceived lower-status (if not lower-paying) jobs in fisheries or other non-white-collar 
sectors. Financial pressures on unemployed youth are deemed to be reduced through parental 
support even for unemployed adult children. These factors create a high reservation wage for youth.104  
Parents supporting a large family do not, in turn, feel any financial pressure because of government 
subsidization of daily necessities, such as basic food items, fuel, electricity and education. Thus, 
parents have little motivation to temper their own high aspirations and pressure their children to 
settle for a job that may be less than ideal. In Maldives and elsewhere this phenomenon is referred 
to as ‘voluntary unemployment.’105  The resultant high youth unemployment might inhibit Maldives’ 
future growth trajectory and the ability of its development to be inclusive.

Maldives’ geography and polarized population distribution throughout the archipelago contribute 
to high cost of service delivery. Maldives’ population is scattered over 194 inhabited island over an 
archipelago of more than 800 kilometers in length. Guaranteeing access to services throughout 
this territory is further complicated by a very polarized distribution of the population, characterized 
by high density in the capital area Malé, which is home to two-thirds of the population, and very 
low density in the atolls.106  In 2014, education and health services together accounted for 22 
percent of total government spending. Maldives is the country in South Asia spending the highest 
share of GDP on health and education (Figures 70 and 71). Interestingly, and despite a spending 
on education that is significantly above international average, the Maldivian government has been 
so far unable to improve access to secondary education and address outstanding learning and 
education-quality issues.

Maldives lacks a comprehensive, effective and efficient system of social protection. Maldives’ 
safety net programs have undertaken major changes since the government’s Strategic Action 
Plan 2009-2013 was drawn up.107  While tremendous progress has been made towards adding 
new programs and expanding coverage of existing ones, Maldives is still far from its policy goal 
of transforming fragmented social safety net programs into a comprehensive social protection 
system. Universal subsidies on food and electricity and universal health insurance represent 
the bulk of social expenditure together with social pension (Old Age Basic Pension) and Senior 
Citizens Allowance (Table 3). Smaller safety net programs include disability and single parent 
allowances.108  Poor targeting and weak coordination in administration greatly reduce the potential 
impact of safety net programs and challenge their fiscal sustainability and, ultimately, the quality 
of assistance to those most vulnerable. 

The increase in spending on universal subsidies is a challenge to shared prosperity and poverty 
reduction in Maldives. As discussed in Chapter 2, Maldives’ performance in reducing poverty and 
boosting shared prosperity has been lackluster. While there is no recent poverty data to confirm this 
hypothesis, the increase in public spending during the past few years might not have contributed 
to better poverty and shared prosperity outcomes, especially because most of the increase has 
been driven by spending on universal subsidies.109  In fact, as revealed in the poverty and social 
impact analysis, while the poor spend a significantly higher share of their budget on food and 
utilities, the rich benefit the most from universal subsidies due to their higher levels of consumption 
(Figures 72 and 73). Because of their inherently regressive nature, universal subsidies represent 
an inefficient instrument for guaranteeing affordability of basic needs for the poorest segments 
of the population. Nevertheless, lacking a coherent safety net system explicitly targeting the poor, 
universal subsidies are the only mechanism of “income support” currently available.

incentives that challenge poverty reduction and shared prosperity moving forward. While the 
introduction of universal health insurance (Aasandha) has benefited disproportionally the poorest 
segments of the population,110  poor design and limited implementation capacity have contributed 
to increasing utilization trends and escalating costs that challenge its future fiscal sustainability. 
Similarly, the generosity of the pension system has exacerbated inter-generational equity issues 
and potentially contributed to increase distortions on the labor market. In particular, increasing 
trends for inter-generational transfers within the household and increasing reservation wages 
might challenge direct participation of the youth in the growth process (as noted above) and add 
to fiscal and social sustainability concerns moving forward.111

The Systematic Country Diagnostic aims to identify the most important opportunities and 
obstacles to poverty reduction and shared prosperity in Maldives. Based on evidence presented 
thus far and analysis conducted as part of this Systematic Country Diagnostic, this section creates 
a framework to identify the highest priority areas for reform and lays out a potential path forward 
for shared and sustainable growth and poverty reduction in Maldives. 

The identification of the priorities areas is the result of a three-step process. First, during the 
concept stage, hypotheses on the functioning of Maldives’ development model and on the drivers 
of its vulnerabilities were formulated, and knowledge gaps identified. Second, during the SCD 
development stage, these hypotheses were confirmed by additional analysis and knowledge gaps 
filled whenever feasible under the given timeline. Third, consultations with local stakeholders were 
used to further validate hypotheses and analysis (Annex 2).

Priority area 1: Enhancing opportunities for the local population to benefit from existing industries. 
Enhancing these opportunities would contribute to poverty reduction and shared prosperity. 
However, the impact may not be immediate and indeed relies on improving infrastructure, training 
and regulations, among other things. It also could reduce social risk by improving employment 
opportunities for the most vulnerable segments of the population, notably for youth and women. 
Actions under this pillar appear politically feasible as both the current and the previous government 
have endorsed reforms in both sectors to make them more inclusive.

Priority area 2: Enabling opportunities for creation of new sources of growth. Enabling the local 
population to seize opportunities for entrepreneurship will require addressing a host of factors 
that combined represent the overall enabling environment in the country. These factors include: 
minimizing the regulatory burden and consequent cost to doing business; enhancing the ability 
of creditworthy firms and entrepreneurs to access finance; and enhancing human capital through 
the formation of professionals and technicians with the skills that are in demand and are the key 
to better jobs. These priorities are discussed below. 

Priority area 3: Improving efficiency and efficacy of public resource management and reducing 
macro fiscal risk. Addressing the challenges identified in this priority area would make the economic 
model in Maldives more sustainable and resilient to shocks. More directly, better management of 
public resources would free up space to benefit the poor and increase opportunities for the youth 
through, for example, better education. The impact of reform of subsidies and the public wage bill 
would have an immediate and medium-term impact on fiscal sustainability, but they require both 
careful planning to mitigate the negative impact on the poor and political courage. Improving the 
preparedness for disasters and climate change would have a medium- to long-term impact. 

The analysis identified governance and labor market as a fundamental cross-cutting issues 
constraining growth, poverty reduction and shared prosperity in Maldives. Governance and labor

market issues are at the heart of many of the constraints that challenge the inclusiveness and 
sustainability of Maldives’ socio-economic model of development. A strong public-sector presence 
in key sectors of the economy and a lack of transparency and accountability in SOEs’ management 
negatively impact fiscal sustainability as well as private sector ’s ability to flourish. Moreover, the 
weakness of the overall legal framework together with the poor management of the country’s 
natural assets challenge the sustainability of the economic model moving forward. Similarly, 
labor market distortions and an increasing mismatch between labor demand and supply make it 
harder for the growth process to be inclusive and put the social contract at great risk. Given the 
fundamental role played by governance and labor market constraints, the SCD has identified the 
need to fill existing knowledge gaps in these areas to more effectively identify policy priorities 
moving forward.

oPPortunities and obstacles to enhance inclusiveness of 
tourisM growth

Growth in itself 
will not be enough 
to ensure the 
inclusiveness of the 
tourism industry.

Given the importance of tourism in Maldives, a more inclusive industry represents a major 
opportunity for shared prosperity going forward. Maintaining underlying growth of tourism will 
be a key factor for the sustainability of growth in the economy as a whole. However, growth in 
itself will not be enough to ensure the inclusiveness of the tourism industry and the realization of 
its potential positive spillovers. There are four potential complementary avenues to enhance the 
inclusiveness of tourism: 

Adequate planning 
and transparent 
implementation of 
resorts development 
can help to enhance 
the benefits for the 
economy as a whole.

First: Enhancing the implementation of the current resort model. Adequate planning and 
transparent implementation of resorts development can help to enhance the benefits for the 
economy as a whole and result in positive spillovers for local communities by attracting reputable 
international investors with extensive industry know-how and networks. Realizing this opportunity 
will require, among other things: 

∫ Holistic planning and implementation of integrated destination management components 
(transport, infrastructure, skills training, marketing, economic clustering) to increase the 
viability of new resort projects, particularly in outer atolls where there are higher incidences of 
poverty. 

∫ A more strategic and transparent approach to ensure that leases are awarded to reputable 
investors with demonstrable track record in the tourism industry to enhance the viability of 
new developments and lead to positive spillovers to the local communities.

∫ Transparency in the management of leases to avoid numerous non-performing leases.

The sustainability 
of the growth in 
guesthouses will 
depend on adequate 
planning and 
regulation of tourism 
development in 
inhabited islands.

∫ Strategic planning to reduce the risk of over-supply in key market segments.

Second: Enabling sustainable economic diversification within the tourism sector. Non-resort market 
niches (e.g. guesthouses and safari boats) have demonstrated the viability of business models that 
are more closely integrated with local communities, through local ownership, higher local employment 
(deemed as high as 75 percent of total staff) and reportedly higher ability to mobilize women as part 
of the workforce. These new market niches have also demonstrated the ability to co-exist with the 
higher-end resorts, providing lower-cost options to other demand segments. Realizing this opportunity 
will require, among other things: 

∫ Destination planning and management. The sustainability of the growth in guesthouses will 
depend on adequate planning and regulation of tourism development in inhabited islands. This 
includes sufficient analysis of carrying capacities, consistent management of land-use plans and 
a requirement for Environmental Impact Assessments. The absence of these foundations in the 
most developed case (Maafushi Island) had led to an increasingly overburdened infrastructure 
system (especially waste management), and, anecdotally, to property inflation and displacement 
of local population. 

∫ Better and more cost-effective infrastructure to mitigate the high cost of transport, which limits 
the potential of new market niches to islands clustered close to the capital (as they cater to more 
price-sensitive tourists). This would facilitate the development of new market niches in remote 
islands, where poverty levels are higher.

Tourism generated 
28,000 jobs in 2014, 
only 40 percent of 
which are filled by 
Maldivian staff.

Third: Enabling local employment. Tourism is a large and growing source of jobs. According to the 
census, tourism generated 28,000 jobs in 2014, only 40 percent of which are filled by Maldivian staff. 
By 2015 the industry was deemed to generate 31,000 jobs. The implementation of industry growth 
in line with government plans would imply an additional demand for 3,300 new employees in the 
mainstream resort industry112. Despite a government-imposed quota requiring at least 45 percent 
of staff to be Maldivian, the tourism industry consistently reports significant difficulties finding and 
retaining qualified local staff. Unlocking the access of Maldivian population to more and better jobs in 
tourism will require addressing a number of factors, including:

A closer collaboration 
between the 
technical education 
institutions and the 
private sector may 
help to enhance the 
relevance and quality 
of the technical 
training provided by 
TVET.

∫ Establishing a partnership between the government and the private sector to identify and address 
the obstacles to local employment. The normative approach (government-imposed quotas) to 
enforce localization of employment has not lead to a sustainable inclusiveness in the tourism 
industry. Anecdotal evidence suggests that local employment in the industry is lower than the 
government-imposed quota.113  

∫ 

Improving the alignment between technical training and demand. Market participants interviewed 
consistently highlighted a major gap between the quality and relevance of the technical training 
provided by TVET and the demands of the market. This prompts many resorts to implement their own 
trainee programs for local youth. However, the high cost of these programs and the high turnover 
of trained local staff are incentives to hire experienced foreign staff. A closer collaboration between 
the technical education institutions and the private sector may help to enhance the relevance and 
quality of the technical training provided by TVET. That, in turn, could enhance the employability of 
technical graduates while making it easier for the tourism sector to find qualified local staff.

∫ Addressing social perceptions that appear to limit the desirability of technical jobs within and 
outside the tourism industry to young people. Anecdotal evidence collected through extensive 
consultations with youth and private-sector stakeholders consistently identified social norms that 
appear to prevent the willingness of the youth to get training and seek technical jobs in spite of 
great demand from various industries for qualified technical staff. These norms appear to include 
social conventions, family expectations and social media role models.

∫ Addressing transport limitations that restrict the ability of Maldivians living in inhabited islands to 
commute to work in resorts. While many resorts provide accommodation to employees, anecdotal 
evidence suggests that Maldivians place a high premium on the ability to live on their home 
island and commute to work. Such evidence is supported by a much higher proportion of local 
employment114  in resorts that are close to inhabited islands and with good transport connections. 

∫ Mitigating social and structural barriers that restrict the ability of young women to work in the tourism 
sector. Social norms dictating appropriate employment for young women contribute to making 
families reluctant to allow young women to take tourism-related jobs because they would have 
to travel from home to other islands and because the tourism sector is associated with “immoral 
and unethical” practices.115  Structural barriers that further exacerbate familial unwillingness to 
allow young women to work away from home include the lack of child-care or residential facilities 
for employed women in the tourism sector. Women’s limited control of transportation adds an 
economic hurdle to their ability to travel to resort islands for work.116 

Fourth: Strengthening linkages between tourism and local providers of goods and services. The 
tourism industry is a large and rapidly growing source of demand for goods and services. The 
tourism sector ’s demand for inputs represents a major opportunity for local producers. But at the

present time, given limitation in local supply, most of the goods are imported. The potential for 
creation of supply chains between local producers and tourism industry is hampered by a number 
of obstacles, including: 

∫ Fundamental challenges to local supply due to the small size of the economy, limited 
economies of scale, high dispersion of the population and high transport costs. However, there 
is ample potential for production focused on specific products and crops, signaling the need 
for specialization.

∫ Shortcomings in quality, quantity and consistency of supply affect the development potential 
for many local producers. According to anecdotal evidence, previous attempts by cooperatives 
and grower associations to enhance reliability and professionalism have failed to radically 
improve the reliability of supply. In light of that, many tourism operators prefer to reduce 
uncertainty through imports. A large proportion of agricultural products come from small 
producers. Aggregation and coordination has been attempted by cooperatives and corporate 
sponsors, but it remains challenging.117  

∫ Limited collaboration between supply and demand of agricultural products. While there have 
been some success stories in production in agricultural islands, of the 52 leased islands, only 
eight are actually operating, signaling potential missed opportunities for enhancement of the 
local production. Further analysis of priority crop production, the calculation of supply and 
demand, key constraints including inputs, logistics, knowledge and employment desirability, 
and availability of land may help to enhance the certainty in supply.

∫ The fact that, at present, agricultural production throughout the country is centralized 
in Malé due to lack of market places for fresh produce in other atolls118. This reduces the 
competitiveness of local production by increasing transport costs and reducing the freshness 
of products. 

oPPortunities and obstacles for unleashing the Potential of 
fisheries and ancillary industries.

Maldives has the opportunity to further develop its fisheries sector, and to capitalize on the potential 
benefits to enhance economic growth and sustainable development at a national level. Unlike the 
fisheries sectors in many countries throughout the world, Maldives has a range of factors in its 
favor that provide the opportunity for further development. The fisheries sector can generate a 
range of sustainable benefits for Maldives – direct benefits such as employment, income and food 
for fish-workers and indirect benefits such as contributions to the national exchequer through 
various fiscal mechanisms. Yet, significant challenges lay ahead to undertake sector development 
within an economically efficient and sustainable fisheries management system.

Enhancing the governance of the sector will be necessary to unleash its potential. The development 
of the skipjack tuna (a segment regulated through processing licenses) and yellowfin tuna  

117 While there are various examples of successful cooperatives, notably the Addu Meedhoo cooperative supplying the Shangri-La 
Hotel, the concept is not well suited to the Maldives and is not inherently replicable across Atolls
118 Effectively, a product may be produced in a remote Atoll, brought to Malé at great cost and transport time, bought in Malé and 
returned to the same Atoll by the buyer.

Shortcomings in 
quality, quantity 
and consistency 
of supply affect 
the development 
potential for many 
local producers.

The fisheries sector 
can generate a 
range of sustainable 
benefits for Maldives.

100

Enhancing the 
governance of the 
fisheries sector will 
be necessary to 
unleash its potential.

Many countries that 
once had ample 
fish resources are 
now faced with 
overcapitalized 
fishing fleets, 
overfished stocks 
and unsustainable 
levels of public 
subsidies to their 
fishery sectors.

(a segment that does not have similar licensing in place) highlights two widely varying trends. 
Where the licensed market segment is characterized by plummeting catch, low added-value 
exports and declining employment, the unlicensed segment is characterized by increasing catch 
volumes, high-value exports to prime markets and increasing employment. While other factors 
may contribute to these trends, it is worth reviewing the governance framework in the sector, 
including the rationale for licensing of particular activities and whether such framework has a 
positive contribution to the economy as a whole. If licenses are maintained, a transparent licensing 
process should be put in place with emphasis on ensuring that licenses are granted to the most 
qualified enterprises with demonstrated ability to contribute to the sustainable growth of the 
sector.

The sustainable and inclusive growth of the fisheries sector will likely not be based on increasing 
the volume of catch. Currently, most of Maldives fisheries operate under free and open-access 
conditions. The sector ’s growth is based largely on traditional policy goals of maximizing 
production through increased fish landings, supported by improved technology that can lead to 
increased fishing yields. Global experience shows, however, that this approach usually results in 
low levels of success in generating sustained economic benefits. In some cases, this leads to 
reduced revenues form the fishery, diminishing profitably and, in the worst case, stock collapse 
from overfishing119  and waste120. Many countries that once had ample fish resources are now 
faced with overcapitalized fishing fleets, overfished stocks and unsustainable levels of public 
subsidies to their fishery sectors. 

A transition to a wealth-based fisheries management system may hold promise for the future. 
Rather than pursuing the traditional goal of increasing fish landings, wealth-based fisheries 
management systems focus on maximizing net returns in fishery-sector development within 
an economically efficient fisheries management system. For inshore reef and lagoon fisheries, 
such systems can involve the development of local community-based management systems. For 
coastal and high-seas fisheries, such systems might be based around the design and introduction 
of rights-based fishing within a sound management planning framework. These approaches 
have worked well for other countries. However, it is important to note that a transition process 
requires a careful implementation and a long-term planning horizon. Prudent management of the 
marine environment also underpins the valuable tourism industry and the perception of Maldives 
as a pristine environment. It is essential, therefore, to capitalize on emerging international best 
practice in fisheries and reef management to ensure that Maldives’ fisheries management system 
is economically efficient, sustainable and profitable in the future. 

119 

The classic example is the Canadian Atlantic cod fishery in the 1980s, culminating in the closure of the fishery in 1992, with mas-
sive economic costs to local fishers, processors, and governments. In Maldives, there are some indications of fleet overcapitaliza-
tion in the tuna fisheries.
120 Another systemic issue is the logistical and capacity problems between harvesters and processors during peak fishing periods.

101

6. opportunitiEs and tradE-offs for sustainablE povErty rEduction  
and sharEd prospErity (contd.)

There are a range of targeted options121  for exploiting the opportunities presented to the Maldives’ 
fisheries sector at present, but effective strategies and plans will need to be developed in order to 
identify not only economic potential, but also environmental impact. 

∫ With tuna harvesting and processing, there are possibilities for developing new domestic 
fisheries such as long-lining, and for re-organizing the current system for collecting and 
buying fish to overcome seasonal gluts and enhance the share of returns for the producers 
of (dried) Maldives fish. Onshore, there are possibilities for locating new processing and fish- 
handling facilities on different islands to take advantage of the seasonal changes in fishing 
grounds and fish concentrations and new infrastructure, such as harbors and airports. The 
impact of selecting a particular development option on local communities, on livelihoods and 
on the economies of scale and logistics of the value chain will need careful consideration and 
cooperation between both private and public actors.

∫ There are strong possibilities for developing new products and entering new markets, in 
particular capitalizing on Maldives pole- and line-caught tuna as an individually caught, 
‘ecologically-friendly’ product from one of the world’s cleanest environments. The culture of 
high-value, small-volume products can also capitalize on the environmental image of Maldives. 
But, international seafood markets are highly competitive and demanding, and Maldives will 
need to exploit its comparative advantage for seafood exports by building a careful business 
and investment strategy. 

∫ There are opportunities for addressing infrastructure and logistical constraints that affect 
some fishing islands. The trade in fish products will depend on better facilities and transport 
links to access export markets, but investments will require sound financial and technical 
assessments and close public-private cooperation including PPPs, particularly given the 
government’s current fiscal situation. 

∫ The need to increase stakeholder involvement in decision-making and policy implementation is 
constrained by the overlapping mandates of different ministries. The lack of a clear definition 
of the respective roles of the public and private actors has major implications for the longer-
term functioning and effectiveness of the sector, especially in a transition towards a wealth-
based fisheries management system. Enhanced and more balanced stakeholder involvement 
between fishers, industry and government in decision-making will help chart a steadier course 
at the national level. It is particularly imperative that fishers have a stronger voice in policy 
development at the national level. 

∫ Finally, the issue of international partnerships also presents options for Maldives. The extent to 
which Maldives’ participation in the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission has benefited the country 
over shared stocks, and the options for entering into partnerships with foreign investors for the 
further development of enterprises such as the tuna transshipping trade are the types of major 
issues that need to be considered in the context of sectoral and national development policy.

Enhanced and more 
balanced stakeholder 
involvement between 
fishers, industry 
and government in 
decision-making 
will help chart a 
steadier course at 
the national level.

121 

These options stem from technical background analyses as well as stakeholders’ consultations.

Economic diversification and competitiveness in Maldives are hampered by significant structural 
and spatial constraints, but enhancing the enabling environment will increase the potential for 
entrepreneurship, creation of new firms and growth of existing ones. Maldives faces similar 
structural challenges of other small island states that restrict the extent to which the country 
can attain competitiveness across the board. However, as discussed in previous sections, there 
are visible untapped opportunities where potential (in terms of existing demand and proved 
production capacity) exists, both within value chains of existing industries, as well as potential 
new economic activities. 

Enabling the local population to seize these opportunities will require addressing a host of factors 
that combined restrict the overall enabling environment in the country. These factors include: 
minimizing the regulatory burden and consequent cost of doing business; enhancing the ability of 
creditworthy firms and entrepreneurs to access finance, and; enhancing human capital through 
the formation of professionals and technicians with the skills that are in demand and are the key 
to better jobs. These priorities are discussed below.

enhancing investMent cliMate 

Enhancing the investment climate will be essential to facilitate entrepreneurship and attract 
investment. As discussed in previous sections, the challenges related to the investment climate 
are higher in Maldives than in other small island states and other countries in the region. Global 
research documents extensively the negative link between investment climate challenges and 
growth and competitiveness in the private sector. As the government of strives to enhance 
entrepreneurship and economic diversification in the country, the opportunities for improvement 
of the investment climate are significant, including:

∫ Reducing the cost of regulatory compliance. Global indicators such as Doing Business identify 
a number of regulatory shortcomings that currently create additional transaction costs to 
entrepreneurs at all stages of the business cycle (from firm creation and connection to basic 
utilities, to expansion and resolution of disputes and insolvency). These deficiencies in the 
regulatory framework have the potential to discourage entrepreneurship and to reduce the 
overall competitiveness of enterprises. Minimizing unnecessary regulatory hurdles will be 
essential in order to foster entrepreneurship in Maldives.. 

∫ Addressing shortcomings 
in the 
legal framework governing private-sector activities. 
Deficiencies in basic legal foundations of the system of commercial justice create legal 
uncertainty and diminish incentives for investment. Key elements of the legal framework 
needed in order to ensure a level playing field and fair treatment of investors (competition 
and industrial property laws) are missing, further undermining the confidence of potential new 

103

Maldives Systematic Country Diagnostic6. opportunitiEs and tradE-offs for sustainablE povErty rEduction  
and sharEd prospErity (contd.)

investors. The lack of adequate laws governing secured transactions severely undercuts the 
ability of the financial sector to provide credit to enterprises because it increases the risk of 
losses in case of borrowers’ defaults due to unpredictable, lengthy and costly legal resolution. 
Addressing these shortcomings in the legal framework, together with the capacity of the 
judiciary to implement laws in a consistent and objective way, will be important to increase 
investor confidence and provide entrepreneurs with legal certainty.

∫ Enhancing the participation of the private sector in the reform of the investment climate. While 
global indicators provide a benchmark of some key areas of the investment climate, identifying 
and addressing the key constraints faced by enterprises and entrepreneurs in Maldives will 
require the active and continuous participation of the private sector. Development of a formal 
public-private dialogue platform on investment climate can provide a channel for the private 
sector to inform government policies and define priorities for reform. The close consultation 
with private sector can also help to reduce the risk of disruption in enterprises’ operations from 
sudden changes in laws and regulations. 

∫ Addressing governance issues affecting the development of the private sector. In particular, 
SOEs have the potential to crowd out private enterprises from major economic activities 
through unfair advantages, including wider access to financial services, broader ability to 
attract the limited human capital available in the country, and preferential treatment related 
to business regulations. Rethinking the role of SOEs and the rationale for their participation in 
economic activities that could be undertaken by private enterprises is necessary to ensure that 
SOEs do not become an obstacle to entrepreneurship and private-sector-led growth.

enhancing access to financial services

Improving access to adequate financial services will be essential to enhance the ability of 
creditworthy firms and entrepreneurs to invest and reduce transaction costs. Enterprises and 
entrepreneurs have identified access to finance as a major constraint for their day-to-day 
operations and longer-term growth. The high dependence of banks’ credit decisions on real 
estate collateral, together with the inability of mechanisms for entrepreneurs with viable business 
plans to demonstrate their creditworthiness, has translated into concentration of credit in a 
few segments of the economy, most particularly larger borrowers in tourism-related activities. 
Recognizing these challenges, authorities in Maldives have tried to provide concessional credit 
to foster entrepreneurship. However, sustainably enhancing access to financial services will likely 
require addressing a range of factors that currently undermine the efficient operations of the 
financial sector, including:

∫ 

Improving credit infrastructure. Enhancing the depth and scope of information included in the 
credit registries will be necessary to increase the ability of lenders to identify borrowers with 
good track records. The inception of an electronic collateral registry will improve the ability of 
borrowers in remote atolls to post use their assets as collateral. 

Addressing 
shortcomings in 
the legal framework 
will be important to 
increase investor 
confidence and 
provide entrepreneurs 
with legal certainty.

Public-private 
dialogue platform on 
investment climate 
can provide a channel 
for the private sector 
to inform government 
policies and define 
priorities for reform.

Rethinking the role 
of SOEs and the 
rationale for their 
participation in 
economic activities is 
necessary to ensure 
that SOEs do not 
become an obstacle 
to entrepreneurship.

104

Sustainably 
enhancing access 
to financial services 
will likely require 
addressing a range of 
factors that currently 
undermine the 
efficient operations of 
the financial sector,

Mobile banking will 
help the population 
in remote atolls to 
have access to basic 
financial services and 
reduce transaction 
costs.

Expanding and 
improving human 
capital will be of 
vital importance to 
promote economic 
prosperity and 
increase jobs for 
young people.

∫ Enhancing financial inclusion of population in remote islands. Development of mobile 
banking will help the population in remote atolls to have access to basic financial services 
and reduce the currently very high transaction costs of financial operations.

∫ 

Improving the legal framework governing financial activities. Lack of clarity and certainty on 
application of laws translates into lengthy and costly legal processes. This increases the risk 
aversion of lenders, which, increases the collateralization requirements. Losses stemming 
from these deficiencies are passed on to new clients in the form of higher interest rates. 
More clarity and consistent application of the laws governing foreclosure, together with 
the clarification of the application of Shariah law in financial disputes will be necessary to 
minimize uncertainty and risk aversion.

∫ Enhancing the development of non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs). NBFIs can increase 
accessibility to financial services by reaching out to segments of the market not covered 
by large commercial banks. Important types of NBFIs (including microfinance, leasing and 
factoring) are currently either missing or underdeveloped in Maldives. Previous experience 
in the country demonstrates the potential for some of these NBFIs, but also shows that 
challenges in the legal framework contributed to diminish that potential over time. Creating 
an enabling environment that fosters the orderly and sustainable development of NBFIs, 
including adequate oversight, can enhance supply of financial services to currently under-
served market segments.

addressing huMan caPital constraints

Expanding and improving human capital will be of vital importance to promote economic 
prosperity and increase jobs for young people. From the demand side, enterprises have 
consistently identified the lack of staff with the adequate skills and qualifications as a major 
constraint to growth. Over the last few years, this has led to vast employment of expatriates. 
From the supply side, young people in Maldives aspire to high-paid jobs, but often lack the 
required skills. While there are various factors at play affecting the participation of youth in 
employment, the gap between the skills demanded and those in supply is wide at the present 
time. Reducing this gap presents a significant potential for shared prosperity, and will require, 
among other factors, the following:

∫ Enhancing Maldivian youths’ ‘soft skills’. Soft skills (including workplace ethics and the ability 
to collaborate effectively within an organization and be responsive to clients) are missing 
from academic programs, but are widely identified as priorities for employers in the country. 
Such skills often rank higher than technical skills as decision elements for employment. 
The introduction of these skills in education programs will increase the employability of 
the Maldivian youth and will likely have a positive impact on their contribution to firms’ 
productivity.

∫ 

Improving the quality and relevance of technical and vocational education. While Maldives has 
a Technical and Vocational Education Program (TVET) in place, the quality and relevance of 
the training provided has failed to meet the demands from the private sector. This, together

with the prevailing perception of Maldivian youth that vocational education and training is an 
inferior option to academic qualifications, has contributed to further lower the interest in TVET. 
A closer collaboration between the private sector and TVET will be necessary to increase the 
relevance of programs provided, and participation of industry experts may enhance the quality 
of the degrees. Ensuring responsiveness of TVET and other relevant academic institutions 
to the private sector will be necessary to unleash the potential for technical and vocational 
education.

∫ Enhancing participation and relevance of higher education. Enrollment in higher education 
is much lower in Maldives than in countries of similar income level. The low proportion of 
Maldivians with higher education qualifications means that the country lacks sufficient 
professionals, managers and technical experts to support economic growth and social 
development. Enrollment in higher education in Maldives is affected by the high dispersion in 
population (with tertiary education provided mainly in Male), but other factors – such as low 
completion rates in higher secondary education (which is provided in the atolls) play a role. 
While enrollment in higher education will remain hampered by Maldives spatial constraints, 
enhancing the relevance and quality of the programs will be essential to ensure that they are 
responsive to the needs of the country.

The sustainability of Maldives’ development model is dependent on how well the authorities 
manage the country’s wealth-generating natural resources and its financial assets to redistribute 
this wealth, and how resilient it is to external and domestic shocks. 

Managing natural resources

Maldives’ natural resources are its marine life, coral reefs and its islands. As discussed earlier, there are 
weaknesses in the exploitation of its natural resources and in its preparedness for natural hazards122.

∫ Continued population development will lead to more sewage and solid waste, which impacts tourism 
and fisheries, and growing demand for clean water for island communities, a development that is 
compounded by a growing competition between water for potable and irrigation purposes.

∫ Loss of coral reefs due to the warming of ocean water and pollution may result in the loss of bait 
fish for tuna fisheries.

∫ 

In the tourism sector, de facto high barriers to entry and the lack of transparency in the allocation of 
leases for resort islands makes it difficult to assess if the government maximizes the benefits from 
its main natural resource.

122 Discussed in the section on Environmental vulnerability and sustainability issues and governance constraints.

106

Governance 
problems prevent 
the government from 
managing its natural 
resources well and 
dealing with the 
emerging challenge 
of sustainability.

∫ The government’s plan to increase passenger arrivals from 1.2 million123  in 2014 to 5 million124  
will add more environmental pressure through the construction of new airports and facilities and 
increased flights. 

∫ Much of the population and critical infrastructure reside within 100 meters of the shoreline, 
making them vulnerable to both disaster and sea-level rise, while climate change itself will 
also affect the quality of its coral reefs.

A number of dimensions of governance problems prevent the government from managing its 
natural resources well and dealing with the emerging challenge of sustainability. 

∫ Environment and natural resource management issues are typically complex, often 
uncertain and dynamic, and affect multiple sectors, organizations and individuals. As a 
result, it requires strong leadership, a high degree of coordination, stakeholder involvement, 
expertise and resources to ensure sustainability.

∫ Although there are multiple public institutions mandated to conserve and protect the natural 
resources with backing of legal instruments, their overlapping roles, undefined relationships 
and lack of incentive to coordinate have a negative impact on management effectiveness.

∫ Lack of funds, human resources and expertise are making enforcement weak. Poor 
stakeholder involvement, especially local authorities and communities in management 
efforts, reduces enforcement capability. 

∫ Poor capacity of civil servants is impacting implementation and monitoring of policies, 
strategies and programs. The private sector, which is the biggest beneficiary of natural 
resources and who can play a significant role in bringing resources, monitoring and 
managements, is playing only a limited role due to lack of opportunity and effort to 
mainstream.

Managing Public financial resources 

The main mechanisms to redistribute the wealth generated by tourism are public sector 
employment, social services, subsidies and transfers. The current system of redistribution has 
contributed to achieving important development outcomes.

∫ Public-sector employment, including education, health and social services125  has played an 
important role in Maldives, accounting for 35 percent of employment in 2010.126  Moreover, 
employment in the public sector has contributed to Maldives’ relatively high female labor 
force participation, as well as to poverty reduction127. 

123 
Tourist arrivals in 2014.
124 Manifesto of the Progressive Party of the Maldives.
125 Although health and education are not necessarily government activities, in Maldives about 90 percent of employment in the 
health sector is in the public sector (Maldives Health Statistics 2013). In the education sector, about 70 percent of students are 
enrolled in government schools (Maldives Statistical Yearbook 2013), and it is assumed that a similar percentage of teachers 
are employed in government schools.
126 
This does not include employment at SOEs.
127 See section on Poverty and shared prosperity.

and sharEd prospErity (contd.)

∫ Public services, and in particular the expansion of education and health services provision 
to populations living in the atolls, have contributed to a significant improvement of human 
development outcomes and human capital accumulation.

∫ Electricity and food subsidies have contributed to mitigating the high cost of energy and 
food supply in Maldives, thereby improving living standards of the population. Similarly, the 
introduction of universal social pensions and health insurance have helped extend protections 
against the challenges of old age and the risk of catastrophic health expenditure to the entire 
population. 

Apart from the food and electricity subsidies delivered through SOEs, capital contributions to 
SOEs are another large public expenditure item. Although a few SOEs returned annual average 
dividends equal to 1.8 percent of GDP between 2011 and 2014 to the budget, annual average 
capital contributions to SOEs amounted to 1.3 percent of GDP over the same period. 

However, sustainability of the positive outcomes achieved through the redistribution system 
crucially depends on improving its efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Given the already widening 
fiscal deficits and high public debt, these mechanisms are not fiscally sustainable at current 
trends, and the government will need to carefully weigh the fiscal costs and social benefits of each 
of the expenditure items. 

The public sector employment freeze contributes to managing the wage bills and improve fiscal 
sustainability. A more structural solution, which could include a review of local government pay 
structures and a public-sector-wide pay scale, could be helpful to ensure consistency of wages 
and salaries across public service and drive public service reform.128  It is important that structural 
reform be accompanied by efforts to improve conditions for employment in the private sector, 
especially for women. 

While it is important to continue to provide wide access to health and education services, more 
careful planning based on the demographic distribution of the population could improve efficiency 
of spending and free resources to improve quality. There is growing evidence that the expansion of 
access to services to the atolls has been accompanied by a decline in the overall quality of service 
provision.129  The failure to close the quantity and quality gap in service provision between Malé 
and the atolls contributes to continued population migration toward the capital and exacerbates 
the (per capita) cost of service provision in the atolls (Figure 74). Still, tailoring service provision 
on the demographic profile of the population in the different parts of the country (Figure 75) could 
result in significant cost savings and potentially free up resources to improve quality of service 
provision. 

128

IMF Article IV, January 2015.
The lack of supply of qualified medical and education professionals within the local Maldivian population, forced the central Gov-
ernment to rely on expatriate workforce for expanding service delivery outside Malé (Maldives Health Statistics 2013, Ministry of 
Health; School Statistics 2014, Ministry of Education). However, high turnover and limited integration of these professionals with 
the local population resulted suboptimal quality of service provision. 

Sustainability of the 
positive outcomes 
achieved through the 
redistribution system 
crucially depends 
on improving its 
efficiency and cost-
effectiveness.

There is growing 
evidence that the 
expansion of access 
to services to the 
atolls has been 
accompanied by a 
decline in the overall 
quality of service 
provision.

Targeting reform of electricity and food subsidies could improve efficiency of spending while 
freeing resources to protect the poor. Building on international experience, a cut to explicit 
subsidies would need to be accompanied by interventions to protect the most vulnerable 
segments of the population, and to limit losses of utility providers. Such strategy would aim at: 
(1) enabling consumption efficiency; (2) increasing supply-side efficiency; and (3) substituting 
universal subsidies with a targeted transfers system. The government has already started to 
target electricity subsidies by reassessing who is eligible to receive them.

Operational savings in Aasandha could cut its cost significantly, while preserving the principle of 
universal health insurance. These savings could be achieved mainly through three channels: (1) 
reducing the cost of medicines through the bulk procurement of essential and generic drugs; 
(2) reducing expenditure on overseas treatment through negotiation of close-ended package 
rates with providers; and (3) improving attention to early detection and secondary prevention of 
chronic diseases at the primary care level, which will be helpful in slowing down disease progress 
and delaying the occurrence of complications. Substantial capacity building of the National Social 
Protection Agency would also be needed to plan, implement and monitor these reforms.130  

Improving SOE governance could improve fiscal and environmental sustainability. The key sources 
of fiscal risks include: (1) political interference in the management of the SOEs, in the form of 
uncompensated subsidies, service requirements, and tolerance of soft budget constraints resulting 
in inter-SOE debts; (2) lack of macroeconomic planning capacity, leading to potential losses as 
macroeconomic variables develop differently than expected; and (3) management challenges, 
such as lack of coherence between public sector and SOE investment plans. Procurement by SOEs 
could be made more transparent to assess whether it delivers enough value for money. As SOEs 
play a key role in many utility sectors (e.g., electricity, water and waste management), improvement 
in their performance could also help alleviate some of the environmental constraints on growth. 

130 Systematic costing, adequate autonomy at the facility level, and appropriate incentive mechanisms being put in place at the design 
stage, to encourage high productivity and cost containment, would be pre-requisites for such reform. Improved information sys-
tems making possible continuous analysis of Aasandha’s administrative data would be important for internal controls and informing 
ongoing reforms, as would be regular compilation and analysis of household survey data to periodically check on the scheme’s 
performance and distributional implications.

increasing MacroeconoMic resilience

Better management of its resources may also make Maldives more resilient to external shocks 
and help it mitigate risks. As a small island state Maldives is inherently vulnerable to external 
shocks, and its heavy reliance on tourism adds a channel of exposure. Indeed, besides the 
exposure it shares with other island states to natural disasters and commodity prices, Maldives is 
also vulnerable to recessions in certain key tourism sectors and the indirect impact on tourism of 
events such as the 9/11 attacks, Additionally, recent domestic unrest may lead to negative travel 
advisories.

Maldives will remain exposed to external shocks from tourism under its current development 
model so it needs to decrease its vulnerability to other shocks and increase its resilience. In order 
to analyze the options to reduce vulnerability and increase resilience, vulnerability is decomposed 
into three parts: (1) exposure to shocks; (2) internal conditions that may amplify or attenuate 
shocks domestically; and (3) risk management in the form of ex-ante institutional quality and ex-
post policy space to mitigate the impact of shocks.131  

∫ Exposure: Maldives is mainly exposed to external demand shocks through tourism, external 
supply shocks from commodity prices and natural disasters. 

∫ 

Internal conditions: Fiscal revenue is highly dependent on tourism, while a large part of public 
expenditure is rigid and difficult to adjust. Combined with high public debt, this makes the fiscal 
accounts also vulnerable to shocks. In addition, the country is structurally highly open to trade, 
and any countercyclical fiscal policy would lead to more imports and potentially destabilizing 
the external sector. 

∫ 

Institutional quality: Maldives has low ratings for policies and institutions, in particular for fiscal 
policy and for debt policy and management.132  

∫ Policy space: The country has limited macroeconomic and fiscal space to deal with an external 
shock. It has low usable official foreign exchange reserves,133  and it runs a persistent fiscal 
deficit. 

While it cannot eliminate its vulnerability to shocks, Maldives has opportunities to reduce its 
vulnerability and increase its resilience within limits by:

∫ Diversifying sources of tourism. Maldives can try to diversify its sources of tourism by attracting 
tourists from other parts of the world and by attracting more tourists to its guest houses and 
other offerings outside resorts. Accessing different markets that are not perfectly synchronized 
could reduce the current volatility of tourist arrivals. The added benefit is the guest-house 
tourism is more inclusive for the local population (Priority area 1).

∫ Reducing reliance on imported fuel. Maldives is interested in introducing solar power to replace 
imported diesel. With diesel imports accounting for around 20 percent of total merchandise

channel of exposure.

imports, this could have a significant effect on vulnerability to commodity price fluctuations. 
Installing and maintaining solar panels could have the added benefit of providing local 
employment for engineers. It should be noted that existing suppliers of diesel-based power 
may initially try to hinder efforts to switch to solar energy until they make the switch themselves. 

∫ Reforming in public expenditure. Reforms in the system of wages, subsidies and transfers 
would make the budget more flexible to deal with revenue shocks without continuously 
increasing public debt. Moreover, it could reduce overconsumption of subsidized electricity 
and certain imported goods, which would reduce external exposure as well. However, this type 
of reform may be politically difficult, and will need a social safety net (such as targeted cash 
transfers) to protect the poorest. 

∫ Decreasing risk of debt portfolio. As Maldives becomes richer, concessional external debt 
may become less available. Public domestic debt has a very short maturity, and is subject to 
refinancing and interest risk.134  Extending the maturity profile would reduce the risk but could 
increase the cost of debt. There are natural buyers of longer-term public debt, such as pension 
funds and insurance companies. Establishing a yield curve beyond one year could also help the 
financial market better price risk, and it could deepen the financial market and make it easier 
for local SMEs to obtain credit.

∫ 

∫ 

Improving public sector governance and planning capacity. Improvements in public financial 
management would lead to more credible budgets, expenditure controls, commitment to 
decreasing public debt and better selection and planning of investment projects. Improvement 
in planning capacity is needed to deal with the challenges of natural resource management, 
and to address the dilemma between consolidating the population closer to Malé and improving 
services and connectivity to populations at their current locations, and to plan the associated 
infrastructure needs. 

Increasing policy space. The low level of usable foreign exchange reserves leaves little space 
to manage the exchange rate and import essential goods. Mitigating this lack of space is 
the existence of a parallel market with sufficient quantities of foreign exchange. The country 
appears to have access to ad-hoc support from partners, but more formalized access to a 
credit line would reduce macroeconomic uncertainty. Fiscal space can be built up by reducing 
the budget deficit and reducing the level of public debt. As a dispersed island state with a 
commitment to provide social services to remote atolls, Maldives faces limits to how much 
expenditure savings can be made but, as explained in the previous section, there appears 
to be scope for efficiency gains. On the other side of the balance, there may be scope for 
increased revenue, including income tax revenue or a wealth tax, ideally from sources that are 
less correlated with fluctuations in tourism. 

134 

In the current situation of apparent excess liquidity in the financial market and the absence of good investment opportunities in the 
private sector, this risk seems to be low. Under the “tap” system for Treasury bills, which fixes interest rates, interest rate risk is also 
low.

Maldives Systematic Country DiagnosticannEx 1. povErty mEasurEmEnt in maldivEs

Understanding of poverty issues in Maldives is limited by data quality and comparability constraints and by pitfalls in the 
current poverty measurement framework.

data liMitations

The primary concern relates to data quality and comparability. The first household survey in Maldives (Vulnerability and 
Poverty Analysis - VPA) was conducted in 1998/99, with a panel followup in 2003/04. The VPA survey series was then 
replaced by Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES) – mostly focused on household budget measurement – 
which was implemented in 2003/04 and 2009/10. Differences in instruments and sample design do not permit comparison 
between the results obtained from VPA and HIES surveys. Moreover, differences in survey instruments and possibly in data 
quality within the two HIES rounds further limits the ability to profile the evolution of poverty in Maldives. 

Poverty MeasureMent fraMework

The most widespread poverty indicator is the share of individuals whose per capita consumption falls below the official 
poverty line. This indicator is usually defined in the literature as headcount index and it is a measure of the incidence of 
poverty. Antecedent to computing the headcount index are two steps: defining a welfare aggregate, e.g. the dimension with 
respect to which we define the minimally acceptable standard of living; and establishing a minimum acceptable standard of 
that indicator to separate the poor from the non-poor (the poverty line).

Maldives lacks an official and unique national poverty line. Since the first household survey in 1997/98, poverty measurement 
has relied on the use of several relative poverty lines, defined in terms of median or a fraction of median consumption of the 
population living in the atolls, excluding the capital Malé. No efforts had so far been made to assess which of these poverty 
lines actually corresponds to a reasonable minimum threshold by the standards of living prevailing in Maldives. 

The consumption aggregate is the sum of the consumption expenditures of all food and non-food items of each household. 
Due to data limitations, the consumption aggregate does not include spending in durables and the flow of services from 
the primary dwelling (usually intended as rent for tenants, and imputed rent for home owners). The validity of official 
poverty profiles is severely hindered by the lack of any adjustment of the consumption aggregate for spatial differences 
in living costs. The lack of spatial price adjustment represents a fundamental flaw of the current poverty measurement 
methodology, especially given the unequal distribution of economic opportunities throughout the Maldivian archipelago, 
relevance of transport costs and differential access to goods and services between the capital area Malé and other atolls. 

Poverty Methodology adoPted for the scd

In order to improve the comparability of the two HIES surveys, and to overcome the shortfalls of the official poverty 
methodology, a new consumption aggregate and a new poverty line have been estimated.

The new consumption aggregate is defined as the sum of all food and non-food household expenditures, excluding housing, 
lumpy expenditures (purchase of vehicles, major tools and equipment, household appliances, durables, furniture), and rare 
expenditures ( jewelry, hay, wedding and parties). The consumption aggregate so defined is then divided by the household 
size, defined as the sum of family members and paying guests. To take into account the spatial price differences, the 
consumption aggregate is deflated using regional food poverty lines.

118

Using the Cost of Basic Needs approach and HIES 2009-10 data, the national poverty line has been estimated at MVR 
787.5. This value is equivalent to the minimum necessary to consume 1,826 Kilocalories per capita per day plus a non-
food allowance equal to the average non-food expenditure of households with food expenditure just enough to reach the 
minimum caloric requirement.

The World Bank uses as extreme poverty line $1.25 a day in 2005 PPP terms, which represents the mean of the poverty 
lines found in the poorest 15 countries ranked by per capita consumption among 88 surveyed countries over the period 
1990-2005 (Ravallion, Chen and Sangraula, 2009). Maldives’ national poverty line is about $1.90 a day in 2005 PPP. Other 
commonly used poverty lines for international comparisons across middle-income countries are $2 and $2.50 a day in 2005 
PPP, which correspond, in turn, to MVR 821.3 and MVR 1,034.2 a month in 2010 prices. In addition to the national poverty 
line, the SCD use the international poverty lines for cross-country comparisons.

the dePth and severity of Poverty 

Although the headcount index is the most widespread measure of poverty, it has a serious shortcoming in that it does not 
take into account the intensity of poverty, i.e. how far from the poverty line the poor are. A measure of poverty that overcomes 
this problem is the poverty gap index. The poverty gap index is the average shortfall of the total population from the poverty 
line as a share measured as a percentage of the poverty line itself, and it defines the depth of poverty. The squared poverty 
gap gives a higher weight on households furthest away from the poverty line and it is a measure of the severity of poverty. 
Both of these measures will complement the analysis of headcount poverty in the context of the SCD.

shared ProsPerity

The World Bank has adopted two new targets to make explicit its goal of “A world free of poverty.” The two targets are: 
ending extreme poverty by 2030 and promoting shared prosperity. Sustainability is an overarching priority in the pursuit of 
these goals: achieving them requires promoting environmental, social, and fiscal sustainability. The emphasis on reducing 
extreme poverty is in line with the commitment to halve extreme poverty enshrined in the first target of the Millennium 
Development Goals, which were adopted globally in 2000. Shared prosperity focuses explicitly on the less well off more 
broadly. Promoting shared prosperity is defined as maximizing income (or consumption) growth for the bottom 40 percent 
of the population. In Maldives, the consumption cut-off line for the bottom 40 percent (the threshold below which the 
poorest 40 percent of population falls) in 2010 is 1,266 MVR a month, or $3.06 a day in 2005 PPP.

suMMary of scd consultations in Maldives

APRIL 27 – 30, 2015

overview 

A series of seven consultations involving nearly 100 participants was carried out as part of the preparation of this Systematic 
Country Diagnostic in Malé. Participants were drawn from government agencies, civil society organizations, youth groups, 
non-governmental organizations, student bodies, academia, development partner, and the private sector to ensure that 
diverse perspectives were represented.

The consultations were arranged under four thematic groups: (1) Opportunities for private-sector development and economic 
diversification; (2) Improving government delivery per formance; (3) Addressing social risks; and (4) Tackling environmental 
vulnerability. In all sessions, the WBG highlighted the key messages that were emerging in the preparation of the Systematic 
County Diagnostic for Maldives and presented a broad overview of issues that were considered important to be addressed. 
The consultation process also included two technical meetings in Malé with representatives of the Government of Maldives. 
These meetings were used as a means of further understanding the current government strategy and as an opportunity to 
engage with the government team that was preparing the National Development Strategy. 

Three objectives guided the consultation process:

∫ Obtaining perspectives from stakeholders on key economic, social and environmental challenges facing Maldives.

∫ Presenting an overview of the key findings of the SCD and validating the data used.

∫ Sharpening key messages in the SCD and identifying any new trends that were emerging .

Participants broadly agreed with the key areas identified as priorities facing Maldives and the main thrust of the SCD in 
this context. Tourism and fisheries remain the two main engines of growth. Participants agreed that while tourism has 
remained largely an enclave industry, fisheries has unrealized potential. Key vulnerabilities were also highlighted. They 
included: (1) a weak macro fiscal environment (largely linked to unsustainable cost of service provision to a small and 
dispersed population, coupled with inefficiencies in government expenditures); (2) social trends, (youth unemployment 
especially among women); (3) environmental vulnerabilities, (related to the lack of institutional capacity to adequately 
manage natural resources, deficiencies in waste, sewerage and management leading to pollution, and lower prioritization 
of environmental issues in government policies); and (4) governance issues. The following report presents recurring points 
noted during consultations. 

120

1. oPPortunities for Private-sector develoPMent and econoMic diversification

agriculture
Increasing linkages between agriculture SMEs and high-value sectors such as tourism were described as important 
income-generating activities for island communities. Agriculture was identified as a sector that could have significant 
impact on promoting shared prosperity. Participants explained that although demand for locally sourced produce exists 
in the tourism industry (as its cheaper and involves less wastage), the lack of a single aggregated market and high 
transportation costs make imports more feasible for resorts. On the supply side, the lack of extension services and 
limited willingness of Maldivians famers to cooperate on decisions related to the type of produce to grow on the limited 
land were also cited as key obstacles for the growth of agricultural SMEs.

The establishment of cooperative societies on islands have seen mixed results. Participants highlighted several 
instances where the establishment of cooperatives has led to significant income generation for farmers with value-
added agricultural produce being sold resorts. However, there have also been several instances where cooperatives 
failed due to the inability of farmers to reach consensus on the type of crops to be grown and the manner in which scarce 
resources (water and land) were to be utilized. Some participants expressed concern that the lessons learned from 
previous failed attempts were not being analyzed and used in the implementation of new schemes. Participants further 
explained that the lack of quality extension services and access to finance were further obstacles to the development 
of agriculture in Maldives. 

fisheries 
While investment in the fisheries sector is lucrative, low budget allocations, low reliance on technology and the lack of 
data sharing has impeded growth in this subsector. Participants highlighted the fact that the fisheries sector has been 
a source of steady income (with earnings in excess of $1,000/month per fisherman). However, declining revenues in 
the last five years was cited as a cause for concern. Participants pointed out that increased national budget allocations 
for the development of the sector would promote opportunities for substantially scaling up the fisheries industry. Low 
cooperation among fishermen to identify prime fishing sites, limited knowledge of and low use of technology, and 
unreliable data (specifically on harvesting trends) were identified as other issues impeding growth in the sector. The 
creation of better linkages with resorts was also cited as a possible step towards increasing revenues and expanding 
the fisheries industry. Labor regulations that prevented the use of migrant workers for harvesting of fish was cited as a 
possible factor in allowing all income generated by the industry to benefit Maldivians directly.

121

Maldives Systematic Country Diagnosticaccess to finance
A conservative lending culture is impeding SME growth. Participants explained that access to finance was severely 
constrained for SMEs. Most SMEs (especially new ventures) do not have sufficient collateral to obtain loans and the lack 
of tailored financial products and instruments impede capital requirements for their expansion.. Loans for agriculture, in 
comparison, were cited as more easily obtained. However, as sufficient monitoring and evaluation was not being carried 
out in the sector, some loans were being used for private consumption and not for agricultural expansion. Participants 
also explained that conducting a needs assessment to identify the specific financial instruments required for SME 
development is an important first step to increase access to finance and also reduce the cost of finance. 

2. iMProving governMent delivery PerforMance

Issues concerning weak governance and the lack of strong public institutions were cited as key concerns for Maldivians 
at present. While participants were satisfied with overall government service provision, improving both the standard 
of education (from early childhood education to tertiary and vocational education) and health facilities was cited as 
important. Participants explained that the absence of sufficient checks and balances between the key arms of state, the 
perceived limited independence of the Judiciary, and low levels of transparency and accountability in the administration 
resulted in a weak institutional framework. This undermined public trust in the institutional framework and also led to 
the erosion of investor confidence. Participants cited examples such as bringing the Environment Protection Agency 
under the purview of the Ministry of Tourism (thus limiting the autonomy of the agency), the reversal of policies, and 
the lack of transparency in the granting of students loans and SME development loans as key instances where the 
governance mechanism had failed. Participants also described political instability as a major impediment in tackling 
key issues involving solid and liquid waste management, urban development and climate change resilience. Additionally 
participants indicated that the absence of a transparent, open and safe space for dialogue between public- and 
private-sector stakeholders and the lack of a participatory approach to policy making as key obstacles to improving the 
governance framework within Maldives. 

3. addressing social risks

youth unemployment
Resolving issues related to youth, such as unemployment and skills development, was consistently cited as a key priority 
by participants at all four sessions. Employers and employees provided contradictory viewpoints as to why unemployment 
continued to a significant issue. Youth unemployment was attributed several factors by employers. Perceptions of poor 
work ethic among Maldivian youth, the inability to obtain the required skill sets (instances of difficulties in finding 
Maldivians with an adequate command of English were highlighted) and practical difficulties (such as the provision of 
transport to island communities to work in resorts) were key reasons cited by employers. Employees highlighted the bias 
against the hiring of Maldivians by Maldivians (specifically in the tourism sector for positions beyond a supervisor role and 
in the health sector for nurses), the lack of vocational training opportunities for employment as electricians, plumbers 
and carpenters (where significant labor demand exists), and the lax implementation of labor regulations (specifying 

122

that half of employees should be Maldivians) in the tourism sector. Beyond skills, the consultations highlighted that 
youth unemployment stems from a disconnect between the aspirations of an ‘ideal’ job among the current generation 
of youth and their parents on the one hand, and the reality of the kinds of jobs that are available in a small island 
country with limited human capacity. Youth unemployment was cited as the key reason for increased drug abuse and 
the participation of young people in gangs. Current policy initiatives were also cited as being insufficient to address key 
youth issues and required the adoption of a holistic and contextual approach for increased success. 

Intergenerational relations were highlighted as another driver exacerbating youth unemployment. Social norms that 
favor young people continuing to live at home relieve the young of the financial and social pressures to search for jobs. 
Even as affordable housing remains elusive and the size of homes shrinks, multigenerational homes continue to be the 
norm, and continue to provide a financial buffer for unemployed youth. The lack of space and house overcrowding had 
also encouraged many young people to look for a space outside the home in search of an identity. This helped lead to 
the proliferation of gangs and drug use. 

gender roles
While the civil law structure in Maldives promotes gender egalitarianism, the consultations revealed that gender norms 
in Maldives are strongly influenced by social dynamics. Participants explained that in the recent years Maldivian society 
has been shifting towards a form of conservatism that has strengthened taboos and social stigmas. This was described 
as having a negative impact on women’s choices to enroll in education and search for jobs. Participants highlighted the 
need for focused policy initiatives to combat the decrease in the number of women seeking employment and disengaging 
from playing an active role in Maldivian society.

4. tackling environMental vulnerability

Efficient usage of land requires the analysis of the efficiency of allocation together with strengthened monitoring and 
evaluation frameworks within institutions. Participants explained that key decisions such as the allocation of islands 
for tourism should be juxtaposed in the context of using such land for the expansion of agriculture. With the inability 
to analyze the extent to which agricultural livelihoods have been lost due to the construction of resorts (especially for 
resorts where construction was not totally completed) owing to the lack of data, due consideration must be given to 
determining what effect future allocations will have in this regard. Although monitoring and evaluation is carried out on 
islands that have been leased out for agriculture, further cost benefit analysis will ensure allocative efficiencies. 

Strong monitoring and evaluation frameworks are required to ensure the sustainable use of natural resources. Participants 
explained that while tuna fishery is heavily regulated (in line with obligations to the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission) and 
fishing for sharks is banned to prevent over-exploitation, no such protection exists for reef fish. Participants said that 
reef fish such as groupers were possibly over-fished on some reefs, thereby damaging ecosystems. Resource-sharing 
and linked management between the fisheries and tourism sectors (specifically in the sustainable management of the 
reef fish population) were also highlighted as being vital.

123

Maldives Systematic Country Diagnostic5. recoMMendations 

Future government strategies must incorporate integrated planning encompassing all sectors. Participants identified 
the lack of integrated planning (combining different sectors) as being a key obstacle for the successful implementation 
of new initiatives undertaken by the government. Integrated planning was seen as key means of ensuring success in 
high-growth sectors, such as tourism, which could benefit from increased linkages with the fisheries sector, (where 
the health of coral reefs are directly dependent on sustainable fishing practices). Participants explained that issues 
concerning the disposal of waste and sewerage, access to fresh water and the use of renewable energy sources could 
have been more easily resolved if integrated urban planning was consistently incorporated into government policy 
initiatives. 

“The failure to equally address both environmental and fiscal challenges could potentially destroy Maldives in the near 
future.”

While public infrastructure investments remain a priority for government, market-based solutions are required to 
induce behavior change. Public investments, specifically in port and airport infrastructure, were cited as priority to 
combat constraints to international trade. However, increasing social welfare, while ensuring fiscal consolidation, would 
require market-based solutions. 

improving statistics 
Improving the reliability and consistency of key statistical data was seen as vital for the development of effective policy 
measures. Participants highlighted that critical discrepancies in statistics considerably distorted the policy planning 
process. Vital statistical data, such as income and employment generation in the fisheries and agriculture sectors, 
was described as severely under represented. Data was also described as sparse for various aspects of consumption, 
such as the quantum of public services being consumed by expatriates. Even critical analysis on issues such as youth 
unemployment was hindered by the lack of accurate data on the proportion of unemployed youth. Enacting legislation 
to ensure quality control of statistics was cited as one measure that could lead to accurate statistical data.

creation of a consistent consultative process
The consultative process with both the private sector and civil society should be improved to ensure inclusive and 
sustainable development. Participants explained that private-sector involvement in policy discussions has been 
initiated several times but the outcomes were consistently undermined by political changes that led to the initiation of 
unfeasible plans based on election pledges. Participants also highlighted significant gaps between decisions reached 
by policymakers and technocrats. This led to government manifestos not being aligned with technical plans, resulting in 
changes to existing policy structure when governments changed. The creation of a central focal point for carrying out 
consultations and initiating central planning was also cited as key reform measures that would promote transparency 
in policy decisions and ensure successful collaboration with the private sector.  

124

Box A.1

A snap poll (in the form of a written questionnaire) was also conducted among participants. The questionnaire consisted 
of five questions – two on the top three challenges for Maldives (immediately and in the medium-term), one on 
possible solutions to these challenges and two on potential steps to be taken immediately and in medium-term on the 
government reform agenda. Although the questionnaire drew a 95 percent response rate, the small sample size was 
a key drawback for obtaining conclusive results on the overall trend of responses. The exercise provided the means 
for obtaining information on issues that participants were reluctant to discuss (such as corruption). It also provided 
further assessment of the key thematic areas, verification of response patterns, and enabled the further prioritization 
of proposed reform actions to be initiated.

Maldives Systematic Country DiagnosticannEx 3. challEnGEs in thE financial sEctor

shortcomings

impact

Legal framework

Legal framework reduces the ability of banks to foreclose 
collateral on defaulted loans1. 

Lack of standard rules for application of Shariah [aw brings 
additional complexities in resolution of defaulted loans.

Current rules on filing of cases of mortgage and property-
backed loan defaults and property rights have made borrowing 
from banks more onerous.

Lack of clarity and certainty on application of laws translates into 
lengthy and costly legal processes. This enhances the risk aversion 
of lenders, which, increases the collateralization requirements. 
Losses stemming from these deficiencies are passed on new clients 
in the form of higher interest rate.

Credit 
infrastructure

The credit registry in the country has a very limited coverage 
(17.3 percent of adult population). Important data stemming 
from retailers or utility companies is not included in the registry.

The limited coverage of credit registries severely limits the ability of 
banks to identify borrowers with good and bad credit record, which 
leads to higher risk aversion, lower credit and higher interest rates.

Banks are required to produce the collateral in the location where 
the case is heard. There are no electronic collateral registries 
where the existence of the collaterals can be verified or offered 
as proof.

Many remote islands remain cut off from financial services due 
to the economic unviability of establishing bank branches in all 
populated islands. The wide telecoms coverage has not been 
exploited as conduit for other delivery mechanisms such as 
mobile banking.

The lack of electronic collateral registries together with the need to 
produce collateral on the location where the case is heard reduce the 
willingness of banks to lend outside of Malé.

Financial inclusion of population in remote islands can be quite 
limited, resulting in high transaction costs, highly limited financing 
opportunities, and lack of security in safekeeping of people’s savings.

Non-bank financial 
institutions

The 
legal framework protecting the property of 
leasing 
companies has been undermined by recent court rulings2.

Tax advantages3 on leasing commonly present in other countries 
are missing in Maldives. 

Factoring is underdeveloped as a financial service even though 
anecdotal evidence suggests that SMEs sale a vast amount 
of products and services on credit and face long lead times to 
receive payment.

Even though there is basic infrastructure in place for capital 
markets, their volume of operations remain very limited. 

The role of the judiciary in the leasing sector has created a loss of 
confidence on the viability of leasing, thereby drastically reducing the 
pace of growth in this financial service4.

The lack of reasonable tax advantages reduces the attractiveness of 
leasing for enterprises. 

SMEs in Maldives reportedly struggle to obtain working capital 
financing while having vast large stocks of accounts receivable. Lack 
of an active factoring reduces SMEs’ ability to make productive use 
of those assets as collateral.

The lack of a liquid capital market may reduce the local financing for 
larger investments. However the lack of a critical mass of potentially 
qualifying issuers and institutional investors pose major challenges 
on the potential viability of capital markets in Maldives. Political 
risk considerations may undermine the ability of capital markets to 
attract foreign investors.

(Footnotes)

1 According to banks interviewed, loans backed by properties take up to 10 years for settlement in case of default.

2 Courts ruled in two cases against MFLC, the largest leasing company denying access to enforce claims on the leased assets, against the basic principle 
of leasing, which is based on the ownership of the asset by the leasing company and usually provides for an expedite repossession of the asset in case of 
default.

3 

Leasing has potential favorable tax treatment over a purchase of equipment. In a true lease, many jurisdictions allow the deduction of the entire amount 
of the monthly payment as an operating expense. This often result into a more favorable tax treatment for investment over the common depreciation of 
equipment in purchases.

4 Operations of MFLC, the largest leasing company in Maldives reduced sharply following the negative ruling on their ability to enforce claims on leased assets. 
It is estimated that following the ruling the company’s leasing portfolio decreased by 21 percent, its borrowing by 38 percent, and its net worth by 18 percent.  
Management is using its cash to pay off debt and declare dividends rather than for funding new leases. Its management is now limiting new leasing primarily 
to repeat customers with whom it has been able to sign standard contractual end of term asset transfer options that will reduce risks of loss on the lease 
contracts.
