EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

i. 

Azerbaijan i s today one o f the seven lowest income countries o f Europe and 
Central Asia. 
I t has experienced many o f the same challenges as other CIS transition 
states exacerbated b y armed conflict, and a large population o f refugees and IDPs. O n a 
more positive note, however, Azerbaijan’s future holds tremendous promise because o f 
o i l and gas resources which i t i s currently developing. H o w the country manages the 
exp lo i ta t ion of these finite natural resources and the associated revenue boom w i l l 
determine the success o f i t s medium-term poverty reduction goals, s e t out in i t s PRSP. 

.. 11. 

Issues fo r Discussion. The fo l low ing i s s u e s are suggested fo r Board discussion: 
> I s the strategy appropriately selective and aligned w i t h the PRSP? 
> I s policy-based lending through PRSCs warranted to reinforce the po l icy dialogue? 
9 I s the blend o f IBRD and IDA lending and I FC assistance appropriate? 
> Are the risks properly identified and mitigated to the extent possible? 
iii. Macroeconomic and Governance Trends. After hype r in f la t ion and severe 
recession, the economy grew at nearly 9% a year during 1997-2002 while annual 
in f la t ion dropped to 0.1%. Azerbaijan b y n ow has an impressive track record o f 
stabilization w i t h f i s c a l restraint and prudent monetary policy. External indebtedness i s 
modest and sustainable. I f o i l and gas developments remain o n t rack GDP g row th cou ld 
reach double digits beyond 2005. However, o i l production i s expected to peak in 201 1 
and decline rapidly after 2013, absent other major discoveries. The ro le o f the O i l Fund 
w i l l be crucial in managing the boom, and securing more equitable g row th across current 
and future generations. D ive rs i f ied development o f the non -o i l sector i s key fo r 
generating jobs and equity. The j o i n t EBRD and Bank survey, BEEPS, showed 
significant progress on governance and corruption i s s u e s du r ing 1999-2002, although 
much remains to be done to strengthen the business environment. 

i v . Poverty Reduction. D e s p i t e some progress in recen t years, about 50% o f the 
population l ived in poverty in 2001 and 17% l ived in extreme poverty. The inc idence o f 
income poverty i s greatest among households in provincial towns, although ru ra l areas 
have more limited access to services and there are significant regional variations in 
poverty rates. Appropriate management o f o i l resources offers p rom is ing prospects f o r 
meeting the Millennium Development Goals. 

v. 

Azerbaijan’s PRSP, k n ow n as the State Program o n Poverty Reduction and 
Economic Development (SPPRED), i d e n t i f i e s six strategic p i l la rs : (i) an enabling 
environment for income-generating opportunities; (ii) macroeconomic stability; (iii) 
qua l i ty o f and equity in access to health and education; (iv) infrastructure improvements 
(including roads, utility services, and irrigation); (v) social p ro tec t ion reforms t o se rve the 
vulnerable more effectively; and (v i ) better conditions fo r refugees and IDPs. The 
SPPRED and the MDGs serve as the organizing framework fo r the CAS, whose four 
strategic goals are designed to underpin the six SPPRED pillars. Generally, Azerbaijan i s 
o n track to realize most MDGs by 20 15, with the caveat that health indicators are d i f f i c u l t 
to measure due to data uncertainties wh ich need to be addressed.

T h e FY03 -05 CAS s t ra tegy comprises f o u r in te r re la ted strategic goals, a i m i n g to : 
(i) manage the o i l w i n d f a l l and ma in ta in macroeconomic stability; (ii) generate j o b s a n d 
n o n - o i l g r ow t h (iii) im p r o v e access t o services by reve rs ing the decline in soc ia l services 
and in f ras t ruc tu re and (iv) help realize the o i l po ten t ia l t o the extent and in the t ime f rame 
envisaged by Azerbaijan’s pove r ty reduc t ion p rog ram . These w o u l d be supported by a 
ca re fu l ly balanced comb ina t ion o f p o l i c y based assistance (PRSCs) inves tmen t projects, 
i n s t i t u t i o n building and techn ica l assistance, as w e l l as ana ly t ica l support. 

v i i . 

The FY03 -05 CAS P r o g r a m includes eight IDA operations to ta l ing up t o $123 
m i l l i o n and one IBRD operation o f $40 m i l l i o n in the Base Case. 
In a H igh Case 
scenario, IDA financing w o u l d increase t o up t o $158 m i l l i o n and a second $35 m i l l i o n

acco rd ing t o imp lemen ta t ion capacity o f the Government, with the m a i n d i f fe rence 
be tween the Base and High Cases be ing the scope o f re fo rms and pace o f imp lemen ta t ion . 
In the Base Case scenario, the p re requ is i tes f o r a PRSC w o u l d be in place in ea r ly F Y 0 5 .

INTRODUCTION 

1. 
The last Azerbaijan Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) was discussed by the 
Board o n September 14, 1999 (IDA/R99-157/1 [IFC-R99-145/1). The cu r ren t CAS, 
covering FY03-05, was prepared j o i n t l y b y IDA and IFC, taking in to account 
Azerbaijan's new PRSP known as the State Program for Poverty Reduction and 
Economic Development (SPPRED). 
I t was developed in close consultation with 
government authorities, other national stakeholders and international development 
partners. The next few years w i l l be a particularly dynamic period fo r Azerbaijan, ow i n g 
p r ima r i ly t o o i l and gas sector developments. The CAS seeks to assist the country in 
managing the opportunities and challenges posed b y these developments, as i t begins to 

implement i t s SPPRED.

THE COUNTRY CONTEXT 

Initial Conditions and the Challenges Ahead 

2. 
A l though Azerbaijan's development prospects seemed b r igh t at the dawn o f the 
20th century because o f i t s o i l and gas resources, subsequent events inc lud ing tw o W o r l d 
Wars and i t s absorption in to the Soviet sphere were l e s s favorable. Azerbaijan i s today 
one o f the seven lowest income countries o f Europe and Central Asia. Over the last 
decade i t has experienced many o f the same challenges as other CIS transition economies 
- severe economic contraction during the early 1990s, a concomitant deterioration in 
social services and infrastructure and sharp increase in poverty, and a daunting agenda o f 
reforms and institutional challenges needed to rede f ine the role o f the state and create the 
essential underpinnings o f a market economy. 
In Azerbaijan's case, however, these 
challenges we re exacerbated b y armed con f l ic t with Armenia over Nagorno-Karabakh, 
wh ich led t o nearly one m i l l i o n internally displaced people (IDPs) and refugees, loss o f 
control over some 20 percen t o f the land area, and disruption o f key regional trade and 
transport l i n k s . O n a more positive note, however, Azerbaijan's future again holds 
tremendous promise because o f new e f fo r ts to develop i t s significant o i l and gas 
resources. H o w the country manages the exploitation o f these f i n i t e natural resources and 

the associated revenue boom w i l l determine the success o f i t s medium-term pove r ty 

reduction goals, se t out in i t s PRSP. 

3 . 
A l though precise measures o f income and well-being du r ing the Soviet era are 
difficult for a variety o f statistical reasons, i t seems clear that Azerbaijan entered the post- 
independence transition period considerably poorer than many other former Soviet 
republics. Azerbaijan's GDP then dropped by 63 percent during 1989-95, compared with 
an average o f 42 pe rcen t in the CIS. Thus, even with economic recovery beg inn ing in 
1996 and GDP g row th averaging more than 8 percent a year over 1997-2002, GDP i s s t i l l 
40 pe rcen t less than in 1989 and nearly h a l f the population remains be low the national 
poverty l i n e .

T h e s ign ing o f a number o f P roduc t ion Sharing Agreements (PSAs) with o i l 
companies in the m i d - 1 990s and i n i t i a t i o n o f s tab i l iza t ion and standard r e f o rm p r o g r am 
ma rked the beg inn ing o f a tu rna round in Azerbaijan’s development prospects. These 
have opened the way f o r investment in t w o ma jo r pipelines which are scheduled f o r 
c om p l e t i o n by around 2005: the Baku -Tb i l is i -Ceyhan (BTC ) p i p e l i n e w i l l ca r ry o i l

T u r k i s h p o r t o f Ceyhan o n the Med i te r ranean Sea th rough Georgia, and the Shah -Den iz 
p ipe l ine w i l l transport gas to Turkey, also th rough Georgia. M a n a g i n g the expected 
substantial, but w i thou t ma jo r new discoveries, sho r t - l ived revenue w i n d f a l l resu l t ing 
f r o m these investments, in a way that avo ids the risk o f severe mac roeconom ic d is to r t ions 
and encourages d ive rs i f ica t ion and g r ow t h o f the n o n - o i l sector, poses a comp lex set o f 
challenges. T h e FY03 -05 C A S w i l l span a c r i t i c a l period, b o t h in preparing fo r t h i s o i l 
b o o m a n d i n i t i a t i n g imp lemen ta t ion o f Azerbaijan’s SPPRED. T h e Bank G roup ’s 
assistance program, in cooperation with those o f other in te rna t iona l partners, w i l l focus 
o n h e l p i n g Aze rba i jan meet these challenges. 

5 . 

A s in other C IS countries, the tasks o f ove rcom ing the legacy o f i n e f f i c i e n t 
p roduc t ion , outdated technology, monopolies, disregard f o r consumer preferences, 
env i ronmen ta l neglect and the absence o f the ins t i tu t ions o f a m a r k e t economy have 
p r o v e d m o r e d i f f i c u l t in Aze rba i jan t h a n i n i t i a l l y anticipated. T h e r e c o r d o f p o l i c y and 
i n s t i t u t i o n a l r e f o rm has been m ixed , but there c lea r ly has been a g a i n in m om e n t um since 
2001. This did n o t stem f r o m a need t o deal with a debt o r re la ted f i n a n c i n g crisis. 
Rather, the success o f the s tab i l iza t ion program, g r ow i n g f o r e i g n inves to r interest, and 
the p rospec t and risks o f large-scale o i l revenues seem t o have strengthened the 
au tho r i t ies ’ interest in and comm i tmen t t o re fo rms . The advent o f the SPPRED process

T h e last f ew years have also seen some s l ow but s ign i f ican t deve lopmen ts o n the 
domestic p o l i t i c a l development f r o n t in Azerbaijan. A d ive rs i f ied m u l t i - p a r t y structure

population, lived i n extreme poverty.

Gender equality in 
primary education. 

Reducing under five 
mortality by two-thirds. 

Enrollment rates i n basic education 
(grades 1-9) are fa ir ly close to loo%, 
although drop-out rates are higher for the 
poor than for non-poor. Sector concerns 
relate more t o quality, including the need 
to build the skills and knowledge 
necessary to meet the challenges o f an 
increasingly globalized economy. 
Surveys show no significant gender 
differences i n enrollment ra tes for basic 
education (grades 1-9). Concerns relate 
more to girls’ access to upper secondary 
and higher education, particularly in rural 
areas. 
According to o f f ic ia l data, infant mortality 
i s relatively low and falling (13 deaths for 
1,000 live births in 2000, compared to 
about 25 in 1990). However, recent 
surveys estimate that the IM R was as high 
as 79 per 1,000 l ive births in 1996, and the 
under-five mortality rate as high as 105. 

With projected high annual GDP 
growth for 200 1-20 10, the poverty 
rate would drop from 50% to 30%, 
assuming no change i n income 
distribution. Aze rba i jan i s thus on 
track fo r ha lv ing income poverty 
by 2015. W i th better targeted social 
programs and stronger job creation, 
this goal could be met sooner. 
The country inher ited a n 
education system tha t provides 
nearly universal basic education. 
Sector issues relate more to quality, 
than access. 

Although girls drop out o f secondary 
school earlier than boys and fewer 
attend post-secondary education, 
especially in rural areas, there i s no 
evidence o f gender inequa l ity a t 
the p r im a r y level. 
Assessing progress i s complicated 
by data uncertainties. To reduce 
under five mortality by 213, a 4.4% f 
annual reduction i s needed between 
1990-20 15. Azerbaijan’s progress 
has been slower at only about 0.9% 
annually during 1990-2000. Thus

mortality by three 
quarters. 

Survey estimates place maternal mortality 
at 7 9 deaths per 100,000 births in 1990 , 
while administrative statistics report a 
figure as low as 9 deaths per 100,000 
births in that year. In 2000, the 
corresponding administrative figure i s 37 
deaths for 100,000 births. 

Reversing the spread o f 

HLViAlDS 

Reversing the spread o f 
Tuberculosis 

The prevalence rate o f Azerbaijan citizens 
infected with H I V i s believed to be low by 
regional standards, although newly 
reported cases doubled between 1999 and 
2000. The actual extent i s not known 
because o f limited coverage o f sero- 
prevalence surveys and lack o f behavioral 
surveys. 
The current Tuberculosis prevalence rate 
i s 50 cases per 100,000 population with a 
high case fatality rate o f 20%. Case 
detection rate remains at around 30%, 
much lower than the intemational 
standard o f 70%, with only a small 
fraction o f cases detected through DOTS. 

Azerbaijan i s a t r isk for not 
meeting this MDG without a 
concerted effort to strengthen 
p r ima ry health care and make i t 
accessible to the poor. 
If survey data i s taken as baseline, 
Azerbaijan could reduce its maternal 
mortality ratio o f 7 9 per 100,000 l ive 
births by 3/4 by the year 2015 with 
increased public health spending and 
strengthened PHC and matemal and 
child health programs, especially i n 
rural areas. Cu r r en t trends a re 
worrisome as even official data 
show an increase i n MMR. 

Although the prevalence rate i s 
considered to be low, the trend i s 
increasing and more appropriate 
survey work i s important. The re i s a 
clear need for greater attention to 
H I V / A I D S prevention and care for 
Aze rba i jan to meet this challenge. 

According to WHO Global 
Tuberculosis Control Program, 
Azerbaijan i s a DOTS Category 2 
country, defined as pilot phase and 
less than 10% coverage. Po l it ica l 
commitment and additional 
resources a re needed to expand 
coverage f rom the current 4% to 
1OOoh in order to meet the MDG

US$2.4 m i l l ion t o two l o c a l private banks. 
Foreign Investors’ Conference: IFC w i l l be organizing a foreign investor’s conference i n Baku from 
May 7-9,2003. This proposed conference i s a follow up to a diagnostic study on the environment for 
FD I led by FIAS. The conference would help focus on the need for greater non-oil investments in 
Azerbaijan and help catalyze foreign investors’ interest through a cooperative effort w i th the Swiss 
Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO). 
SME L inkage Program: I n connection with the BTC Pipeline investments, IFC i s considering ways 
to have the local businesses (mainly SMEs) benefit from supply chain linkages to the large 
investment expenditures surrounding the BTC project. IFC w i l l first undertake an SME map detailing 
the SME business environment and hurdles to growth at both the f irm and institutional levels. The 
map w i l l also identify potential follow-on initiatives via workshops and seminars w i th the business 
community. These SMEs may be funded through credit lines to the banks or a specialized SME fund, 
which could have participation from private investors involved i n BTC. SMEs i n several o i l and gas 
sub-sectors w i l l receive specific technical assistance to improve their productivity and quality 
assurance i n a programme funded jointly by IFC, BP, Statoil, Unocal, the AIOC Enterprise Center 
and GTZ (German Development Corporation). ‘In addition, some community development programs 
are also expected to ensure that a wider segment o f the population i s able to benefit from the BTC 
investments and training w i l l be provided to local business development service providers which i n 
tum w i l l assist SMEs. 
Pr iva te En terpr ise Partnership (PEP) Program: IFC, through the PEP program i s expected to 
engage in helping on two main fronts: i) Corporate Governance Program for the banks and their 
clients; and ii) Leasing Sector Development project. 
Baku Stock Exchange (BSE)/State Securities Committee (SSC) Ins t i tu t ion Bu i ld ing Technical 
Assistance: Capacity building program includes capital markets training to the staff o f both 
institutions and market participants, simulation o f IPO case, preparation o f IPO guidebook, review o f 
intemal rules and regulations, and public awareness seminar. 
Bank Pr iva t iza t ion Advisory - United Universal Bank (BUS bank): i s planned to be privatized in 
2004. IFC has been requested by Azerbaijan’s Central Bank to ass is t with i t s privatization. The 
project development i s planned for 2003. 
Other General Manu fac tu r ing Opportunities: IFC has been approached with possibilities for a few 
other manufacturing projects, to support the non-oil sector o f the economy. However, i n most cases, 
the local sponsor’s investment needs are too small for direct IFC involvement. 

Other areas o f interest to IFC include support to transparent privatization o f major industrial enterprises; 
agribusiness and agro-processing, utilities infrastructure, and telecommunications. Environmental 
upgrading i s also a sector where IFC would consider playing a role, should the Bank Groups broader work 
i n the area o f preventing environmental degradation result in possible opportunities for private sector 
involvement.

Strateg ic Choices. Several k e y strategic choices unde rp in the CAS . F i rs t , i s the 
ques t ion o f h o w the B a n k G roup shou ld support the management o f the o i l boom . T h e 
p lanned strategy a ims t o do so by a comb ina t ion o f po l icy -based l e n d i n g and AAA, in 
close co l labo ra t ion with the IMF. Aze rba i jan i s in a special tu rna round situation, because 
i t i s unde rgo ing heavy structural adjustment whilst beg inn ing t o rea l ize a tempo ra ry 
resource boom . Policy-based lending in the f o r m o f one o r m o r e PRSCs rema ins a n 
appropriate ins t rumen t because i t b r i n g s d i f fe ren t components in the gove rnmen t together 
a round a time-bound, actionable r e f o r m strategy in support o f the PRSP. T h e p o l i t i c a l 
economy impac t w o u l d be substantial, even though the adjustment amounts are modest. 
T h e Government’s desire f o r po l icy -based lending, also re f lec ts the v i ew s o f those 
leading the r e f o rm e f fo r ts that this w o u l d be ve ry helpful in bo ls te r ing re fo rms . I t also 
represents a desire t o a v o i d easy and frequent recourse t o the O i l Fund, by i n s t i l l i n g

d isc ip l ine and strengthening systems o f p u b l i c expenditure management and 
p r i o r i t i z a t i o n be fo re the O i l Fund i s resorted t o simply as a g row ing source o f finance. 

56. 
Second, with the progress made o n macroeconomic s tab i l iza t ion and s t ruc tu ra l 
re fo rm 
in recent years, Azerbaijan’s creditworthiness has 
imp roved . 
Fu r the r 
imp rovemen ts in creditworthiness are expected i f the triggers f o r the base and high case 
lending p rog rams are met. The lend ing p rog ram proposed f o r this C A S p e r i o d i s 
therefore based o n a blend o f IDA and IBRD resources. 

57. 
Third, i s the question o f h o w t o exercise se lec t iv i ty in the face o f the ex tens ive 
p o l i c y agenda in the PRSP/SPPRED. This invo lves choices o n where the B a n k G r o u p 
can make m a x i m u m impact, and i t necessarily invo lves d i f f i c u l t trade-offs. T h e Bank ’s 
dialogue a n d w o r k i n g relationship with the re levan t agencies i s an im p o r t a n t fac to r in 
these decisions. This, for example, unde r l ies the decision t o support educa t ion and 
pens ion re fo rm , but t o defer mo re s ign i f ican t support fo r the hea l th sector whe re 
experience under a n ongo ing LIL i s m o r e recent and limited, and n o t ye t as encouraging. 

58. 
Ano the r consideration in exe rc is ing se lec t iv i ty concerns wha t o the r dono rs are 
p lann ing t o d o and ongo ing activities. F o r example, given the support t o b e p r o v i d e d t o 
m a i n roads by the A s i a n and Is lam ic Deve lopmen t Banks, and the v e r y recen t IDA 
h i g hw a y p ro jec t f o r w h i c h imp lemen ta t ion i s just starting, fu r the r l e n d i n g i s n o t 
envisaged during the FY03 -05 C A S period, although IDA w o u l d suppo r t r u r a l 
c omm u n i t y infrastructure. With rega rd t o IDPdrefugees, IDA ’S assistance w i l l b e 
p rov ided t h r o u g h accelerated imp lemen ta t ion o f t h e ongoing p ro jec t and be t te r ta rge t ing 
o f soc ia l assistance and selective support unde r sector investment p ro jec ts . I f there i s a 
b reak th rough in the reso lu t ion o f the Nago rno Ka rabakh con f l ic t , the poss ib le need f o r 
new lending w o u l d be revisited. 

59. 
The FY 0 3 - 0 5 time frame i s expected t o b e one o f rap id ly chang ing circumstances 
in Aze rba i jan during w h i c h the precise time-path, f inanc ing and impact o f o i l and gas 
sector developments shou ld become clear. F Y 0 5 i s likely t o be a watershed year. 
P ipe l ines shou ld be c om i n g o n l ine ; o i l revenues shou ld begin t o rise; a r e g i o n a l p o l i t i c a l 
se t t lemen t m a y be closer at hand. B y FY06 , there w i l l be a need t o reassess the Bank ’s 
assistance strategy and instruments, i n c l u d i n g t h e mix and balance o f IBRD and IDA. 
These developments w i l l make i t desirable t o prepare a new assistance strategy f o r F Y 0 6 
and beyond. B road ly , the Bank w o u l d expect t o continue suppo r t ing e f fo r ts t o 
successfully manage the anticipated b igge r o i l boom ; t o im p r o v e governance and t o 
diversify the econom ic base; as w e l l as l e n d f o r the subsequent phases o f the A P L s in 
ag r icu l tu re and education; and possible n e w p ro jec ts in health, soc ia l p r o t e c t i o n and 
de l ive ry o f in f ras t ruc tu re services t o less w e l l - o f f households, and p r o t e c t i o n o f 
b iod ive rs i ty resources o f the Caspian Coastal Reg ion . 

60. 
The FY03 -05 L e n d i n g and AAA P rog ram comprises e igh t IDA operations 
to ta l ing $123 m i l l i o n over FY03 -05 and one IBRD operation o f $40 m i l l i o n in the Base

IMPLEMENTING THE CAS 

Lessons o f The Last CAS 

65. Many, but n o t all, o f the development outcomes o f the las t C A S were achieved. 
The mac roeconom ic p o l i c y agenda and f a c i l i t a t i o n o f p r iva te sector inves tmen t in the 
energy sector were highly successful. Pub l ic sector reform outcomes were m o r e mixed. 
O f the f o u r p i l l a r s o f the pub l ic sector strategy, progress o n internal and ex te rna l aud i t 
systems has been substantial, although the tempo was slow, especially during the ea r ly 
years o f the C A S . Achievements in p u b l i c expenditure management have gone fu r the r 
than anticipated. O n the other hand, there has been o n l y limited p rog ress in 
adm in is t ra t ive and lega l re fo rm . I t i s f a i r t o say tha t r e f o rm measures p roposed in some 
o f these areas we re very ambitious, and the i r p o l i t i c a l reverberations were unde r ra ted by 
B a n k teams, w h o v i ew e d them in a mo re techn ica l light. 

66. 
I t i s n o t ew o r t h y tha t the re fo rm tempo p i c k e d up s ign i f ican t ly during the second 
h a l f o f the C A S period, even though there was n o s ign i f ican t shift in the makeup o f the 
Government. This underlines the impo r tance o f being rea l is t ic about w h a t c a n be 
achieved, and a l l ow i n g time during p ro jec t p repa ra t ion and des ign t o ensure b r o a d 
consensus a n d understanding o f the re fo rms at a l l levels o f government, adm in is t ra t ion 
and c i v i l society. An O E D review o f S A C 1, f o r ins tance , characterized i t s sus ta inab i l i ty 
as “ f rag i le ” due t o weak government ownership. T h i s lesson has been inco rpo ra ted in the 
design o f the cu r ren t CAS , where a b road coun t ry owne rsh ip o n o v e r a l l p o l i c y d i r e c t i o n 
has been ach ieved t h r o u g h the SPPRED, and the pace o f reforms, set by the government, 
w i l l be the m a i n determinant o f the Base Case /H igh Case scenarios. 

67. 
B o t h in the utility sector and the soc ia l sector, i n i t i a l r e f o rm progress was s lowe r 
than anticipated, but the pace o f r e f o rm has p i c k e d up no t iceab ly in the las t t w o years. 
Here , another k e y constraint has been the shortage o f ins t i tu t iona l capacity, p a r t i c u l a r l y in 
the areas o f p o l i c y fo rmu la t ion , data c o l l e c t i o n and analysis. While some poverty 
reduc t ion t o o k p lace during the last C A S period, the re was an inadequate data base t o 
measure and analyze it. This c r i t ica l weakness was addressed in pa r t during the 
fo rmu la t ion o f the PRSP/SPPRED, w h i c h was c lose ly integrated with the p repa ra t ion and 
d issem ina t ion o f a fu l l -sca le pove r ty assessment o n a co l labo ra t ive basis. This w i l l 
continue t o b e a m a j o r area o f focus during the current CAS . (See also Box 3 o n Lessons

Box 3: Lessons Learned F rom The Azerba i jan Client Survey 
The 2003 Client Survey i n Azerbaijan points out a number o f areas o f strength for the Bank, as well as areas 
that require more attention and exploration. Overall, respondents gave a positive assessment o f the Bank’s 
effectiveness. Among different stakeholders, however, ratings varied, with government officials and other 
donors the most favorable, and private sector respondents the least favorable. NGO respondents were in 
the middle, and reported the lowest level o f familiarity with Bank programs, among stakeholder groups. 
Respondents saw the Bank as most effective in helping t o bring about economic growth; ensuring that 
attention i s paid to the environment; helping to strengthen the financial system; and helping to reduce poverty. 
They saw the Bank as less successful in strengthening the judicial system; helping to strengthen the 
regulatory framework; increasing integration o f information technology; and helping to strengthen the health 
sector. Respondents reported a high level o f satisfaction w i th the ir personal dealings w i th B an k staff, 
giving the staff high marks for straightforwardness, consistency, accessibility and treating clients and 
stakeholders w i th respect. Bu t the Bank scored lower on flexibility, both in terms o f adjusting to changing 
project circumstances and i n adjusting to changing country circumstances. Similarly, respondents reported a 
high level o f satisfaction with the Bank’s technical competence and ability to produce “useful” knowledge, 
but less with the Bank’s ability to adapt its knowledge to Azerbaijan’s needs. 
The survey revealed several points that need to be hr ther explored by the Country Team. One area o f 
concern i s the fact that the Bank received higher marks for effectively monitoring and evaluating its projects 
and programs, than f o r safeguarding against corruption i n projects. I t i s also noteworthy that the Bank was 
seen as an effective catalyst for discussion on issues related to poverty, but respondents were less convinced 
that the Bank’s work reflects its own mission o f poverty alleviation.

Issues o f ins t i tu t iona l capacity and ensuring the sustainability o f r e f o rm s w i l l

Portfolio and Fiduciary Issues 

70. 
Assessmen ts o f the Azerbaijan po r t fo l io b y the Bank’s Quality Assessmen t Group 
(QAG) and Operations Evaluation Department (OED) have mostly been satisfactory. 
Four projects were reviewed for Quality at En t ry (Highways, SAC I, P i lo t Reconstruction 
and Ag r icu l tu re Credit and Development), two fo r Quality o f Supervision (Petroleum TA 
and Urgent Environment) and one p i e c e o f ESW was reviewed (CPAR). A l l were rated 
satisfactory. O f the three completed or closed projects reviewed b y OED, the 
Rehabilitation Credit was rated “Satisfactory”; Petroleum TA “Moderately Satisfactory” 
and SAC 1 “Moderately Unsatisfactory.” 

71. 
At the end o f FY02, the IDA po r t fo l io comprised 15 operations with ne t 
commitments o f US$368.3 m i l l i o n and an average age o f 3.2 years, and a l l PSR summary 
ratings were satisfactory although some projects carry seve ra l risk flags, and the pace o f 
disbursement i s be low the EC A regional average and needs to improve. The gap appears 
ma in ly related to slow start-up o f new projects, with time required t o build capacity o f the 
new ly established Project Implementation Units and e f fec t iveness delays. 

72. 
The Bank i s taking several steps t o strengthen po r t fo l io implementation. First, a 
CPAR was carried out in la te FY02 and a C F A A in FY03. Bo th have resu l ted in action 
plans wh ich the government has broadly agreed to implement. Within the Bank, 
responsibility fo r Po r t fo l io Management has been decentralized to the Country Manager, 
supported by the appointment in FY03 o f an internationally recruited s ta f f member in 
Baku to handle f inanc ia l management issues and o f a procurement specialist in the 
Georgia Coun t ry O f f ice who w i l l also cover a part o f the Azerbaijan po r t fo l io . 

CAS Consultations 

73. 
Consultations on the draft F Y 2003-05 CAS were held with representatives o f the 
Government and c i v i l society in Azerbaijan from Ma rch 7-12, 2003. Meetings were held 
w i t h the P r ime Minister and Council o f M i n i s t e r s ; Parliamentarians headed by the Deputy 
Speaker; the PRSP team; NGOs; represen ta t ives o f private sector; and the donor 
community. 

0 The Government emphasized the importance o f continued cooperation with the 
Bank Group in making further progress on structural reforms. W h i l e in full 
agreement w i t h the CAS program, the Government wou ld l i k e to see the IDPs 
given support through confessional assistance programs. 

0 Members o f the Parliament wou ld like closer contacts with the Bank, and 
suggested that rural development be given h i g h p r io r i ty . Several members o f 
Parliament and o f the Government expressed their concern that Azerbaijan’s IDA 
allocation continues to be l o w when compared on a per capita basis with other 
countries f rom the Caucasus.

A l t h o u g h s t i l l a low - income country, Aze rba i jan has strong po ten t ia l t o g r o w

The W o r l d Bank has taken the lead in the po l icy dialogue on structural reforms, 
inc lud ing poverty reduction measures, public expenditures, agricultural policies, 
private sector development, ins t i tu t ion building and governance. A range o f 
instruments i s used to conduct the dialogue. SAC I1 i s supporting a wide-ranging 
structural re fo rm agenda and i t s accompanying institution bu i ld ing and technical 
assistance credit ( I B T A 11) i s assisting institutional capacity building, especially o f 
government budget preparation and execution, privatization and utility reforms. This 
broad-based po l icy reform approach i s combined w i t h sector investments in 
agriculture, 
roads, water, refugees/IDPs, environment, education, health and 
domestic gas. Recen t analytical and advisory assistance has included a pove r ty 
assessment, a PER, a CPAR (procurement assessment), a C F A A (financial 
accountability), pension reforms paper and ongoing exercises o n trade fac i l i ta t ion 
and m i t iga t ion o f the social costs o f u t i l i t y price increases. 

The next section describes the Bank program and the d iv is ion o f responsibility 
between the two institutions. In a number o f areas - social sectors and safety nets, 
environment, governance, infrastructure, and agriculture - the Bank t a k e s the lead in 
the dialogue and the re i s no cross conditionality w i t h the IMF-supported program. 
The Bank i s also leading the dialogue in private sector development and pub l ic 
en te rp r ise re fo rm and Bank analysis se rves as an input in to the Fund program. In 
other areas - energy, financial sector, pub l ic expenditure management, pub l ic sector, 
trade and investment po l icy - bo th institutions wo rk together and share cross 
conditionality. Finally, in areas like monetary policy, tax po l icy and customs, the 
IMF takes the lead with limited Bank involvement. (see Table 1).
