COUNTRY ASSISTANCE STRATEGY 

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

1. 

Today, Nepal stands at the crossroads between a brighter future that promises more sustained 
poverty reduction and the possibility of the country becoming mired in a more protracted internal conflict. 
During the past few years, the insurgency has escalated sharply, involving an open conflict with the army 
since November 200 1. This, combined with external developments, has undermined the economy and 
weakened the country’s fiscal position. Despite the many positive changes Nepal has seen since the 
advent of multi-party democracy in 1990 and the first wave of economic liberalization measures in the 
early-l99Os, the recent developments have highlighted the stark and worsening inequities in Nepal, not 
only in terms of incomes, but also of the fundamental ability of the Nepali citizen to participate in social 
and political decision-making processes. The deepening crisis, however, has also created the space for 
the reform-minded political and technocratic leaders to begin a renewed drive to build an economic and 
social foundation for sustained peace and poverty reduction. 

ii. 
Important reforms have emerged in several areas over the past two years. First, to prevent a 
possible financial sector crisis, a key initial step was taken by putting the two ailing commercial banks 
under external management teams. Second, facing up squarely to the fiscal pressures, His Majesty’s 
Government of Nepal (HMGN) introduced a Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) in FY02/03 
to rationalize the development budget and instill the discipline of a hard budget constraint. Third, 
responding to the urgent need to improve public service delivery, HMGN has started to transfer key 
services to community management in primary education and primary health care. Fourth, to ensure 
implementation of priority reforms, HMGN devised an Immediate Action Plan (IAP) in 2002, which was 
effectively used to hold relevant Ministries and Departments accountable for promised actions. Fifth, a 
highly visible anti-corruption drive has been started by the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of 
Authority (CIAA), thereby giving Nepali citizens a hope that the days of rampant corruption may be 
coming to an end. The recently adopted Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS)-based on the Tenth Plan 
(FY02/03-FYO6/07)-builds on these successes, and gives the reform process much greater strategic 
coherence and clarity. 

. . . 

111. 

Nepal’s PRS breaks from the past, largely ineffective plans in a number of significant ways. For 
the first time, it explicitly identifies social exclusion as one of the fundamental development challenges. 
It also recognizes HMGN’s constrained fiscal situation and weak implementation capacity, and places the 
PRS in a realistic framework of implementation abilities, both fiscal and institutional. Thus, the MTEF 
gives it both a medium term fiscal fi-amework and annual budgetary translation of the strategy, while the 
IAP will be used as an annual implementation plan for high priority reform actions that would receive 
continual attention from the highest levels of HMGN. These two instruments and the track record of 
significant early progress give the PRS considerable credibility. With the aim of reducing poverty and 
improving critical public services, the PRS is built around four pillars: (i) broad-based economic growth; 
(ii) social sector development; (iii) social inclusion; and (iv) good governance. In implementing it, the 
PRS stresses decentralization, rationalization of central government functions and transparency. 

iv. 
Despite the successes and a palpable change in the energy with which the reform leaders are 
pushing the agenda at the center, the benefits of the reforms have not yet been felt widely at the grassroots 
levels. There is clearly a need to accelerate the reform actions embodied in the PRS, including in 
particular greater decentralization. This would be essential not only for rebuilding the people’s 
confidence in the state, but also for making meaningful progress toward poverty reduction and achieving 
the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).

V. 

Given the continuing political turmoil, the Bank no doubt faces a risky environment in which to 
operate in Nepal. The Bank, however, should not lose sight of the most important risk the country faces, 
and hence by extension the Bank also faces-Le., 
the risk of Nepal spiraling into a widespread armed 
conflict and a breakdown of state institutions. In comparison, many of the other risks are modest if not 
trivial. The current wave of reforms is a determined effort by the reform leaders to mitigate this 
fundamental risk. Unlike in typical reform episodes, the leadership for change has come more from a 
growing number of reform-minded technocrats and some enlightened political leaders who stand apart in 
an establishment that has provided largely passive support rather than explicit leadership. Because of 
this, the reform efforts may seem more tenuous and less spectacular. Nevertheless, the basic contents of 
the reform program enjoys strong support from the population at large and at least tacit support from 
mainstream political parties. This is not to minimize the risks that the reform process could be stifled by 
myopic political interests or the implementation capacity is curtailed by hostilities. Implementation of the 
Bank’s strategy will be cognizant of these risks. 

vi. 
Through the lean years of slow reforms, the Bank worked consistently with reform-minded 
leaders and facilitated the beginnings of the current reform process. The firm linking of lending levels to 
actual reform implementation has challenged and inspired the reformers. And, an uncommonly strong 
partnership has developed between these leaders and the Bank, with a strongly shared vision for the 
reforms that Nepal needs. More importantly, the reformers have risen to the occasion and have begun 
implementing the far reaching program articulated in the PRS. Because of the fiscal pressures, 
accelerating its implementation will require increased external resource flows, particularly of a 
programmatic nature. The Bank’s CAS for FY04-FY07 is designed to respond to this situation by 
increasing financial support to facilitate Nepal’s own reform efforts. To align the Bank’s assistance 
program with the PRS, the CAS will be fully outcomes-focused, continuing the outcomes-based approach 
developed by the Nepal Country Team over the last two years. 

vii. 
Given the risks of politics getting in the way of reforms, the Bank will continue to maintain 
sharply differentiated lending levels linked to progress on reform implementation. The base case 
envisions an average annual lending of about US$190 million (consistent with the current IDA resource 
allocation for Nepal), including programmatic support to facilitate accelerated implementation of the core 
PRS priorities. If the reform process stalls (low case), the lending support will be curtailed sharply to a 
range of US$O-50 million. In the high case-which 
is associated with peace and accelerated reforms- 
lending could increase to US$200-250 million annually. With the prevailing uncertainties, however, there 
could be a need to revisit the strategy. As such, a CAS Progress Report (CAS PR) will be prepared in 
approximately eighteen to twenty-four months, or sooner should the situation warrant. 

viii. 

The Executive Directors may wish to discuss:

The appropriateness of the basic strategy of providing strong support to Nepal’s PRS in the 
face of significant political uncertainty; 
The appropriateness of the outcomes-based approach outlined in the CAS; and 
The choice of instruments to deliver the lending program. 
ix. 
In many respects, Nepal is truly at a critical juncture in its development process, and it is difficult 
to predict which path the country will follow. While the on-going reforms offer the best hope for laying 
the foundation for sustained peace and development, the insurgency makes their implementation more 
difficult. Yet, one thing is clear. With strong support of the Bank as outlined in this CAS, the chances 
are much greater that the reform program will succeed, and hence, lead eventually to real improvements 
in the lives of Nepal’s poor and most vulnerable. 

NEPAL 

COUNTRY ASSISTANCE STRATEGY 

INTRODUCTION 

1. 
The last Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Nepa l-cons idered by the Board on December 
13, 1998-identified poor governance as the fundamental constraint restricting Nepal’s development.’ 
Since then, while there have been improvements, governance-broadly 
defined to encompass public 
accountability, transparency and social inclusion-remains 
the country’s central challenge. In part 
reflecting the structure of poor governance, over the last five years Nepal has gone through turbulent 
times. Both growth and poverty reduction have suffered from a number of factors, including: (i) 
successive ineffective Governments and a continuing unstable political environment; (ii) an escalation of 
the insurgency, interspersed with two failed attempts at peace talks (in 2001 and 2003); and (iii) harsh 
repercussions from the global economic slowdown that have severely affected Nepal. 

2. 
As reported in the CAS Progress Report (CAS PR) of November 2002,’ despite this instability 
and uncer ta in ty-a perhaps because of it-ver 
the last two years, Nepal has begun implementing an 
impressive and far-reaching reform program. Notable progress has been made in financial sector reform, 
public expenditures management, changes in public service delivery modalities, the fight against 
corruption and the infrastructure regulatory environment. To give the reform process greater coherence, 
the country has recently formulated a Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS).3 Nonetheless, the impact of the 
reforms have not been felt widely enough to date and Nepal remains one of the world’s poorest countries, 
with an annual per capita income of about US$230 and bleak social indicators. Nepal also needs to 
address fundamental issues related to social exclusion and redress the widespread perception that the state 
has been failing to deliver basic public services. While the on-going reforms offer the best hope for 
laying the foundation for sustained peace and development, the insurgency makes their implementation 
more difficult. 

3. 
Thus, Nepal is at a critical juncture in its development process today. Nepal may tie turning 
toward a brighter future, but the risk of the country becoming mired in a more protracted internal conflict 
cannot be discounted. Despite this unpredictable environment, there are several good reasons for the 
Bank to formulate a new CAS at this time. Most fundamentally, a new CAS will allow the Bank to align 
its assistance program closely to the current reform process embodied in the PRS, hence providing more 
effective support and encouragement to the reform efforts. Moreover, contrary to the political turmoil 
and uncertainties, in the last two years there has been much greater continuity and certainty in the reform 
process, backed by broad support from the general public. As such, there is a solid process of change that 
Bank assistance can and should support. This is not to minimize the risks the reform process faces, but all 
the more reason the Bank should have a clear strategy to deal with the various possibilities.

Nepal’s Current Position 
As of 1995, it was estimated that about 40% of Nepal’s population lived on less 
than US$l/day. There is little evidence that poverty has declined since the 
1980s and the absolute number of poor has llkely increased. 
There is evidence that the net enrolment rate of primary-aged children rose in 
the 1990s reportedly to over 70% and the youth literacy rate increased to 63%. 
There have been significant improvements in the relative access of girls to 
school education during the 1990s (a ratio of girls to boys in primary/secondary 
education of 82%); however, the ratio of young literate females to males is still 
less than 60%, and Nepali women are still largely without voice and influence 
in the public domain. 
Within the last decade, there have been considerable reductions in infant 
mortality (from 100 per 1,000 live births to 66) and child mortality (from 145 
per 1,000 to 91); nevertheless, large regional variations persist. 
Maternal mortality remains h g h (estimated at 830 per 100,000 live births in 
1995) with only about 12% ofbiAhs attended by skilled health staff. 
It is hard to obtain an accurate assessment of the HIV/AIDS situation; however, 
evidence suggests that the HIV rate is rising rapidly-perhaps 
the early stages 
of a concentrated epidemic-in 
several vulnerable groups, notably Nepalis 
worlung abroad and sex workers. 
There are issues-e.g., deletion of soil nutrients and arsenic contamination in 
the Terai-that 
show environmental sustainability remains a problem. 
However, other initiatives-in drinking water and forestry-indicate positive 
progress. A national sustainable development strategy is under preparation. 
Nepal has an overall low level of telephone density and approximately two- 
thirds of telephones are in the Kathmandu valley.

The most recent estimates are based on the 1995/96 Household Survey. A Nepal Living Standards Survey 
(NLSS) was launched in early-2003 to update household level information on consumption, poverty and 
their determinants. A full Poverty Report based on this survey will be finalized in FY05. For more details 
on the poverty situation in Nepal, see the Poverty Reduction Strategy.

5 . 
With approximately 85% of the total population living in rural areas, poverty is largely a rural 
phenomenon in Nepal-a 
rural poverty incidence of 44% compared to about 23% in urban areas.’ Of the 
country’s ecological regions, poverty in the mountains, at about 5 5 % , is significantly above the national 
average, as it is in the more remote mid- and far-western districts (many of which are controlled by the 
insurgents) where poverty is as high as 70%. While there have been noticeable improvements in human 
development indicators in recent years, they are still quite low and show significant urbadrural and 
geographical variations. There has been some progress in reducing gender d ispar i t ies-e .g . , life 
expectancy, literacy levels, and school completion rates-but, great advances are still required for Nepali 
woman to be considered truly empowered. 

6. 
As important, there are significant ethnic and caste-based disparities in what is recognized as a 
largely pluralistic society with diverse ethnic, caste, linguistic and religious communities.6 Broad 
linkages have been identified between caste and poverty, and caste and human development levels, and 
there are some clear messages: (i) most of the Dalit population is disadvantaged; and (ii) there are striking 
caste and ethnicity-based disparities in education. A number of factors-including 
its limited natural 
resource endowment, land-locked and rugged terrain, and series of ineffective and unstable 
Governments-have 
contributed to Nepal’s poverty problems. Adding to these, much of the economic 
growth has been in non-agricultural sectors, leaving behind the majority of Nepalis living in rural areas. 

B. 

Political Context 

7. 
Nepal has seen extraordinary political instability in recent years-Le., 
there have been twelve 
changes in Prime Minister in the past eight years. Peace has also eluded Nepal for more than seven years 
while a violent insurgency has claimed over 8,000 lives and the remit of the state machinery shrunk 
largely to urban and semi-urban areas in many districts (see Box 2). An important breakthrough was 
made on January 29 ,2003 when His Majesty’s Government of Nepal (HMGN) and the insurgent leaders 
agreed to a cease-fire. After three rounds of peace talks, however, the insurgents unilaterally called off 
the cease-fire on August 27 ,2003 , While all sides stress the need for a peaceful resolution of the conflict, 
the path to peace is not obvious. 

8 . 
On the political front, the Parliament was dissolved on May 22, 2002, and Mi-. Sher Bahadur 
Deuba remained as caretaker Prime Minister for about six months. During this time, the terms of locally 
elected bodies-both 
at the village/municipality and district levels-were 
allowed to expire in July 2002. 
With an escalation of insurgency-related violence-in part a campaign to prevent elections-Mr. Deuba 
recommended deferment of elections for over a year. This led the King to dismiss the Government in 
September 2002, and has resulted in two successive interim Governments. 

9. 
The first interim administration-headed 
by Prime Minister Lokendra Bahadur Chand of the 
Rastriya Prajatantra Party (UP)-was 
appointed by the King on October 11, 2002 with a mandate, 
among other things, to restore peace, hold the suspended elections, fight corruption and improve service 
delivery. While public opinion was firmly behind the peace talks and supported the administration, the 
main political parties-most 
notably, the split Nepali Congress (NC ) Party and the United Marxist 
Leninist Party (UML)-con t inua l ly challenged the administration’s legitimacy. On the basis of the

Nepal has over 100 languages and dialects, and more than 60 recorded ethnic groups, some of which are 
further sub-divided into distinct caste rankings. There are many indigenous ethnic (‘Janajati’) groups and

disadvantaged and continue to lag behind.

standoff that developed with the political parties 
agitating for the restoration of Parliament and 
formation of an all-party Government, the 
Chand administration resigned 
in 
late-May 
2003, and 
the King appointed Mr. Surya 
Bahadur Thapa-also 
of the RPP-as 
the new 
Prime Minister on June 4. 

Box 2: The Insurgency 

The insurgency-previously 
a low intensity and 
mainly rural campaign to form a ‘people’s republic’-has 
claimed more than 8,000 lives by official accounts and has 
resulted in Nepal’s longest and bloodiest conflict since the 
mid-1700s. It is clearly a political movement with a fm 
political philosophy, but has gained strength because of 
certain social-economic conditions, including in particular: 
0 Horizontal 
inequality 
and 
social 
exclusion: 
specifically, economic growth has 
largely benefited 
Kathmandu valley residents, with the large impoverished 
and deprived rural population-for 
decades a target of 
social exclusion-witnessing 
little social and economic 
progress; and 
0 Failure of governance, including lack of delivery of 
public services: specifically, weak institutions have failed 
to meet the basic needs of the population and continue to 
be 
linked with corruption, political infighting and 
instability. 
The insurgency has increasingly challenged the 
fragile economy-the costs have been estimated at 8-10% 
of GDP, including: (i) damage to infrastructure-e.g., over 
1/3 of the 3,900 Village Development Committee (VDC) 
buildings have been destroyed; (ii) lost economic activity 
due to bandhs-i.e., 
strikes-that 
have been taking place 
with greater frequency and often lasting 2-3 days; and (iii) 
a generally low level of economic activity caused by 
decreased business confidence and 
low 
tourism. 
Furthermore, there have been large direct impacts on the 
livelihoods of millions of primarily 
rural-based 
individuals, for which killing, extortion, confiscation, 
forced recruitment, and infrastructure destruction have 
created fear and resulted 
in migration, decreased 
agricultural production, and a decline in living standards- 
it is estimated that approximately 300,000 people have 
migrated to the Kathmandu valley in recent years. 

10. 
As head of 
the 
second 
interim 
administration, Prime Minister Thapa has been 
vested with full executive powers to assemble an 
all-party Government, but the five main political 
parties have so far all declined to join, claiming 
that the current administration is no different 
from its predecessor. As such, the cabinet 
contains only six additional members, all from 
the RPP. Mr. Thapa has outlined a ten-point 
agenda 
that 
includes: 
(i) 
resolving 
the 
insurgency problem and establishing lasting 
peace; (ii) creating an environment conducive to 
local and general elections; (iii) establishing the 
foundations 
of 
good 
governance 
and 
strengthening the administrative machinery; (iv) 
effectively 
implementing 
anti-corruption 
measures; (v) accelerating economic reforms 
and facilitating an enabling environment for 
investment; and (vi) building consensus for 
political, economic and social reforms. In this 
context, securing a lasting peace with the 
insurgents, reaching a political settlement with 
the parties and building an environment 
conducive to holding elections all remain high 
on HMGN’s agenda. Strongly related to this, 
HMGN’s recent replacement of public servants 
with political appointments in local bodies (see footnote 11) can be viewed as a precursor to local 
elections. Nevertheless, the political situation remains tense and a speedy return to functioning 
democracy does not appear imminent. 

C. Macroeconomic Performance and Medium Term Prospects 

11. 
Since the last CAS, the Nepali economy has fluctuated. After growing at a rate of 5% per year 
during the 1990s, real GDP fell in FYO1/02 primarily due to declines in manufacturing and tourism (see 
Table 1). A number of factors-including 
sluggish worldwide growth, the insurgency, market saturation, 
and inadequate quality control and standards-contributed 
to the decline, as did irregular rainfall that 
adversely affected agricultural production. More recently, there have been signs of a modest recovery 
underway, with GDP growing by 2 .3% in FY02/03. Economic activity picked up noticeably after the 
January cease-fire with some recovery in tourism, transportation and other services, and certain 
manufactured expo r t s - e sp e c i a l ly garments. Nevertheless, the economy remains weak. 

12. 
As imports have also somewhat rebounded, the current account balance recorded a slight deficit 
(about 1% of GDP) in FY02/03. Remittances from Nepalese working abroad have grown tremendously 

Nepa l Country Assistance Strategy 

Page 5 o f 34 

(estimated at around USS855 million in FY02/03), with this item now larger than the value of 
merchandise exports. Gross official reserves remained high at about US$1.2 billion-about 
six % months 
of import-at 
end-FY02/03. The external debt service ratio is low (about 7.5%) of exports of goods and 
services, because of the highly concessional nature of external borrowing.

13. 
In recent years fiscal management has come under stress, as the worsening insurgency situation 
and fragile economy contributed to weak revenue growth and security-related spending increased. In 
FYO 1/02, revenues were below the budget target (despite serious collection efforts, including imposition 
of special security surtaxes) and security spending was about 1% above the budgeted amount (although 
still well below the level of similar spending in other countries in the region). Anticipating further fiscal 
pressures, HMGN embarked on a bold fiscal consolidation exercise in FY02/03 that has been 
implemented with a considerable degree of success.' Despite low levels of development expenditures in 
FY02/03, pro-poor spending has been protected. Furthermore, with revenues increasing by 13% over the 
previous year, the deficit before grants declined to 4% of GDP in FY02/03 (compared to the 1990s 
average of 6%). Fiscal management will continue to be strengthened during FY03/04 and into the second 
month of the fiscal year, budget implementation is strong. In the past, the deficit has largely been 
financed by concessional foreign financing, however, in FYOO/Ol and FYO1/02 domestic financing rose 
slightly. With successful implementation of the reform program, in the future it is envisioned that foreign 
financing will increase.

14. 
Led by a recovery of manufacturing and exports, stronger agricultural performance and 
productivity, and higher investment, in the medium term growth in Nepal is expected to increase to the 
5% rates experienced during the 1990s.* There are, however, several key pre-conditions for these to 
occur. First and foremost, renewed economic growth will require political stability and peace. Second, 
Nepal will need to implement a range of growth-enhancing structural reforms to stimulate a more pro- 
poor and inclusive growth process, including: (i) enhancing the development impact of public 
expenditures and 
improving tax administration; (ii) improving power, 
transport, banlung and 
telecommunications services; (iii) boosting Nepal’s export competitiveness by addressing some behind 
the border constraints; (iv) addressing sector specific reforms such as rationalizing irrigation subsidies in 
agriculture and improving labor market flexibility for manufacturing and services; and (v) undertaking 
governance reforms that enhance the impact of the structural measures. 

15. 

The macroeconomic framework recently agreed by HMGN with the Bank and International 
Monetary Fund (IMF), as well as assistance from both institutions to implement the reform efforts- 
through Poverty Reduction Support Credits (PRSCs) and a Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility 
(PRGF)-will 
support Nepal’s attempts to achieve more sustainable growth. The key elements of the 
framework are consistent with the PRS and include: (i) a fiscal strategy to improve revenue mobilization, 
prioritize spending-towards 
social and infrastructure sectors to help reduce poverty-and 
contain 
domestic borrowing over the medium term; (ii) a monetary policy geared to supporting the peg to the 
Indian rupee; (iii) continuation of the financial sector reforms; (iv) public sector reforms including civil 
service and public enterprise; and (v) governance reforms to strengthen the fight against corruption and 
accelerate decentralization to local levels to improve accountability and service delivery. 

D. 

Progress Under the Last CAS and Lessons Learnedg 

CAS Implem en tation 

16. 
Because of the limited and slow progress in 
implementing the reform program, for much of the last 
CAS period Nepal remained in a low case lending 
scenario. Given the fungibility of aid resources, 
without substantial improvement in the use of public 
resources, more financial assistance from IDA would 
not have been a solution to Nepal’s problems. HMGN 
clearly began recognizing poor governance-reflected 
most acutely in weak implementation of reforms, poor 
service delivery and corruption-as 
a central obstacle 
to development. Growing recognition of the gravity of 
the financial sector conditions and their direct link to 
the system of poor governance, led the Bank to attach 
special importance to financial sector reform (see Box 
3 ) . As the first major step in reforming the financial 
sector, the introduction of external management teams 
in the two large ailing commercial banks became the 
‘litmus test’ for moving into a base case scenario. By 
the time of the December 2002 CAS PR significant 

Box 3: Gove rnance and the Financial Sector 
Poor management of financial resources at Rastriya 
Banijya Bank (RBB) and Nepal Bank Limited 
(NBL) has been a way through which powerful elite 
have abused public institutions. Poor management 
and oversight of the financial sector-in 
part, 
occasioned by heavy-handed state involvement- 
has 
resulted 
in problems of growing non- 
performing assets and capital adequacy, and an 
increased scope for systemic risk within the sector. 
RBB and NBL-accounting 
for about 50% of total 
banking system assets-are 
estimated to have had 
losses (as of mid-1998) of as much as US$450 
million-equivalent 
to about 46% of the budget or 
8.6% of GDP. 
In late-2000, HMGN adopted a 
strategy that commits to reducing the role of the 
public sector in the sector as a direct owner of 
financial institutions, while strengthening its role as 
a supervisor and regulator of banks and financial 
institutions (see paragraph 32).

Nevertheless, a key concern will be the removal of the Multi-Fibre Arrangement (MFA) based quota 
protected markets that had stimulated the growth of manufacturing and trading over the last decade. 

For a more detailed discussion of the experience with implementing the last CAS, see Appendix 11. 

Nepal Country Assistance Strategy 

Page 7 of 3 4 

progress had been achieved toward implementing the reform program, including in the financial sector, 
and hence the decision was made to move Nepal to the base case. 

17. While in the low case (late-1998 to late-2002), the lending program focused primarily on 
infrastructure development, and four projects-in 
education, rural infrastructure, road maintenance and 
telecommunications-were approved for a total of US$94.6 million. Strong emphasis was placed on 
helping to build the agenda and needed consensus for reform. To a great extent, the introduction of a 
Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) and Immediate Action Plan (IAP-see 
paragraphs 2 1- 
24) have been prompted by the Bank’s 
Analytical and Advisory Activities (AAA). 
In addition to key formal reports (see Table 
2), the Bank’s follow up through technical 
assistance (TA) and intensive dialogue have 
made 
significant contributions 
to 
the 
foundations of many of the on-going and 
envisioned reforms. Internally, the Bank’s 
Nepal team has also moved to an outcomes- 
based work programming approach to 
sharpen its focus on facilitating reforms (see 
paragraph 49). Since the transition to the 
base case 
in December 2002, 
three 
additional projects (in the financial sector, 
power development and education) have 
been approved for a total of US$96.9 million. 

Lessons Learned 

18. 
Today, there is a realization in Nepal that the Bank is truly concerned with the well-being of the 
poor and that it is not possible to simply ‘negotiate’ aid out of IDA. In getting to this point, a number of 
valuable lessons have been learned-both 
from our experiences in Nepal and world-wide, including 
through instruments such as The Global Poll (May 2003). The following have taken into account in 
developing this new CAS: 

In an environment of poor governance, closely linking lending levels to progress in implementing 
reforms and achieving results on the ground-not 
just promises+an provide significant leverage. 
While such an approach by itself might not prompt reforms, when spontaneous reform initiatives 
emerge, it can provide an important and constructive discipline to the process, and can even 
strengthen the hands of reform leaders. In addition, this fosters peer pressure among senior officials 
to look at development more holistically, as they realize that sectoral h n d s could be blocked if the 
overall progress is not made toward larger country goals (Le., governance); 
A work program grounded in an outcomes framework encourages a more holistic and multi- 
sectoral approach for the Bank team. Outcomes need to be realistic and focus on those areas where 
the Bank plays a significant role, with clear linkages to the country’s stated objectives; 
To be most effective, consistent dialogue and investment in a solid relationship with key 
counterparts are essential. In addition to building consensus for change/reform, such an investment 
also builds and encourages ownership of and buy in for reform programs. Proactive outreach helps 
build wider understanding of the development challenges and opportunities; 

Nepal Country Ass is tance S tra tegy

0 

It takes time for reform to catch on; hence, there is a need to simultaneously develop ‘low case 
appropriate’ interventions-typically modest in size and often supporting community-based projects 
or small, sector-specific reform efforts; 
0 The interplay of diverse political economy realities have an important impact on reform 
implementation. These need to be better understood for the Bank to be more effective in identifying 
and supporting emerging reform opportunities. When reforms do happen, they are often spontaneous 
and episodic, and often fall outside conventional frameworks that donors are accustomed to. 
Moreover, Government officials are not generally good at showcasing reform progress, nor are they 
practiced at communicating successes to the public. These are important aspects to stress and take 
into account if the benefits of reforms are to be the best arbiter for deeper reforms in the future; 
0 The linkages between peace and stability, and poverty reduction are strong-possibly 
forming a 
vicious circle. Development/poverty reduction can not be delayed or postponed until there is peace 
and stability, as many of the root causes of conflict-i.e., 
failure of governance, including lack of 
delivery of public services, and horizontal inequality and social exclusion-are often also the major 
challenges of reducing poverty; and 
Donor coordination is essential, but not always easy. 
Ultimately, the Government must be 
encouraged to coordinate donor assistance by setting out its own development strategy and priorities. 
Clearly, donors-including 
the Bank-need 
to respect Government efforts to ‘regulate’ and direct 
foreign assistance.

NEPAL’S POVERTY REDUCTION STRATEGY 

A. 

The Reform Process 

The Context: Nepal at the Edge of Chaos 

19. 
Nepal is struggling to emerge from a period of intense turmoil and its future hangs in balance. 
The acutest form of this turmoil is the insurgency that escalated into a serious armed conflict involving 
the army in November 2001. In the backdrop, however, had been growing disappointment with the 
political and development processes that have failed to meet the aspirations of the people, which had been 
raised after the reinstatement of a multi-party democracy in 1990. With the heightened level of hostilities, 
the economy slowed and fiscal pressures built. When this crisis did not seem to prompt political leaders 
into serious corrective action, the frustration of many turned into a sense of alarm that the nation was 
heading for a catastrophe. From this deep sense of crisis, a new wave of reforms was born. It is being led 
by a growing number of reform-minded technocrats and some enlightened political leaders. 

20. 
An important beginning was made at the Nepal Development Forum (NDF) in March 2000, 
where HMGN announced a comprehensive reform program that focused on improving governance and 
reducing poverty. As the severity of the financial problems of the two largest commercial banks became 
apparent in 2001, reformers became alarmed by the prospect of a financial sector crisis and began to use it 
as a focal point of the reform process. Then, with the fiscal situation deteriorating rapidly in 2002, 
HMGN started to use this as a driver for public expenditure reform. At the same time, to respond to the 
serious challenges caused by the insurgency, reformers began to design radical ways to improve public 
service delivery even under severe fiscal constraints. By the beginning of FY02/03, these somewhat 
disparate initiatives took shape as a more cogent strategy, embodied in the IAP and the financial sector 
reform program that would place the two ailing banks under external management as the first step. An 
integral part of the IAP has been the introduction of the MTEF to substantially rationalize the 
development budget. In parallel, after its legal framework was strengthened in 2002, the Commission for 

Nepal Country Assistance Strategy 

Page 9 of 3 4 

Investigation of Abuse o f Authority (CIAA) started to take some highly visible actions against senior civil 
servants and politicians on corruption charges." This has been met with enthusiastic support from the 
general public. As explained below, the PRS builds on these reform successes and expands the scope of 
reforms, with a more integrated approach within a medium term perspective. 

The Immediate Action Plan 

Box 4: The 2003 IAP 

2 1. 
In June 2002, HMGN adopted the IAP that was designed to expedite reforms in three critical 
areas-prioritizing public expenditures, improving service delivery, and strengthening anti-conuption and 
accountability measures. Recognizing their weak implementation capacity, HMGN took pains to keep 
the plan selective. Main IAP actions included: (i) 
tting a realistic budget ceiling and eliminating a 
number of low priority projects; (ii) assuring 
funding for high priority projects, but tying funds 
release 
to performance; (iii) improving service 
delivery modalities by initiating the transfer of 
public primary schools and primary health facilities 
to community management; (iv) public posting of 
budget information and tracking of expenditures; (v) 
implementing public procurement and financial 
accountability reforms; and (vi) developing and 
starting to implement an anti-corruption strategy. 
With all the Ministries and Departments relevant to 
the IAP galvanized into action, nearly all of the 19 
actions were completed by the end of FY02/03. 
Inspired by this achievement, HMGN decided to 
turn the IAP into an annual process to define and 
monitor a set of critical actions necessary for the 
successful implementation of the PRS. After being 
endorsed by 
the cabinet, 
the 2003 IAP was 
announced in July 2003 and the measures are 
expected to be implemented by the first quarter of 
2004 (see Box 4 and Appendix 111). In this regard, 
reform leaders are keenly aware that these early 
successes have not 
translated 
into significant 
impacts on the lives o f average citizens at the 
grassroots levels, especially in rural areas. To make the reform process meaningful and sustainable, there 
is an urgency to accelerate the implementation, especially of the reforms that bring quick impact to the 
community level. The 2003 IAP is designed with this objective in mind. Lengthy delays in local 
elections, however, present an obstacle, as they have dampened the momentum for decentralization. In 
many Districts, locally elected District Development Committee (DDC) and Village Development 
Committee (VDC) chairs (who had executive power) tended to be strong promoters of change at the 
grassroots level." 

The 2003 IAP contains 24 reform actions directly 
linked to the four PRS pillars. As such, it is more 
ambitious than its predecessor and covers reforms in 
about a dozen areas. In addition to areas previously 
covered-Le., 
public expenditure management, civil 
service reform and anti-corruption-the 
2003 IAP 
covers actions 
in agriculture, private 
sector 
development, public 
enterprise 
rationalization, 
infrastructure development, targeted programs and 
decentralization. The Reform and Development 
G r o u p a joint HMGN/donor task force-has worked 
diligently on developing the 2003 IAP and has 
identified 'lead Ministries' and 'lead donor agencies' 
responsible for carrying out detailed assessments of 
each of the actions. These assessments include an 
explanation of the impacthmportance of the action, a 
preliminary cost estimate and 
timeframe 
for 
implementation, and an outline of the proposed 
arrangements to review implementation progress. 
Past experience has shown that sectoral ownership at 
the highest levels has contributed to achievements 
above and beyond the original targets established in 
the IAP (see Appendix 111).

In FY02 l03 , the CIAA filed 154 cases in various courts. Of these, the Special Court for corruption has 
passed judgment on 55 cases, of which 43 have been in favor of the CIAA. The most prominent cases, 
however, are pending. 

To fill the vacuum at the local level, recently the cabinet appointed numerous DDC and municipality 
officials, including some former DDC chairs, vice chairs and mayors. After experimenting with running 
local bodies through civil servants, HMGN concluded that local bodies were better governed by political 
leaders; hence, the appointments.

Medium Term Expenditure Framework and Fiscal Adjustments 

22. 
Based on the recommendations of the 2000 Public Expenditure Review (PER)I2 and the work of 
the Public Expenditure Review Commission (PERC) in 2001, and prompted by the worsening fiscal 
situation, HMGN decided to introduce an MTEF starting in FY02/03. Overcoming the entrenched 
tendency to seek increased foreign aid to cope with fiscal stress, the reform-minded National Planning 
Commission (NPC) and Ministry of Finance (MOF) used the fiscal pressures to motivate serious 
adjustments in budget allocations. This led to elimination of 160 low priority projects (out of 625 
projects) in the FY02/03 budget. Further cuts in projects would have been desirable, but were politically 
impossible. Instead, HMGN chose to be pragmatic and opted for an unorthodox solution in which 
remaining projects were classified into three priorities-P1, P2, and P3. While funding for the top 
priority ( P l ) projects was assured, funding for lower priority (P2 and P3) projects would be contingent on 
actual availability of funds after all P1 projects are adequately funded.13 While seemingly vulnerable to 
political pressures, NPC and MOF nevertheless managed to use this system effectively to concentrate 
funding to the P1 projects and within a year established a clear understanding among line ministries of the 
seriousness of this prioritization exercise. 

23. 
At the same time revenue growth was slowing during the last two fiscal years, security spending 
was increasing sharply as the level and scale of the insurgency escalated. From a very modest level of Rs. 
7 billion (1.9% of GDP) in FYOO/O 1 to support the police and a small standing army, security spending 
rose to about Rs. 15 billion in FY02/03. While in principle this increase was detrimental to the 
development efforts, NPCMOF turned it to its advantage. As the increase in security spending was an 
absolute imperative, the resulting severe fiscal pressure made it easier to impose a hard budget constraint 
on line ministries and politicians who had been accustomed to much softer budget constraints in the past. 
The majority of the cuts hit low priority, politically motivated projects. Total development spending 
declined from Rs. 37 billion in FYOO/Ol to Rs. 27 billion in FY02/03. The developmental impact of this 
reduction appears to have been relatively modest, as most of the dropped and P3 projects had been ill 
conceived to begin with and receiving only modest annual funding without any realistic hope of 
completion in the foreseeable future. 

24. 
In the meantime, through reforms to decentralize service delivery modalities-not 
only in 
primary education and health care, but also in agricultural services-the quality of recurrent spending has 
started to improve. 
In FY03/04, further measures are anticipated in this regard, including: (i) the 
operationalization of an autonomous Roads Board that is expected to bring more rationality and 
transparency to the allocation of road maintenance budget; (ii) incentive grants to schools that improve 
enrolment of disadvantaged groups; (iii) implementation of the essential health care package approach to 
focus the limited resources on priority health issues; and (iv) greater participation of the private sector in 
infrastructure services--e.g., establishment of the Power Development Fund (PDF) to promote private 
investment, introduction of a rural telecommunications operator and opening the licensing system for 
private cellular operators. In effect, HMGN has been able to turn the fiscal and service quality crises into 
an opportunity to establish a leaner and more efficient public spending program. As Nepal begins to 
implement its PRS in full scale and increase expenditures to support it, far greater impact from additional 
spending can be expected than in the past.

B. 

The Poverty Reduction Strategy 

Background 

25. 
Nepal’s PRS is based on the reform successes and limitations it has seen over the last two years, 
and gives the process a broader, and longer-term vision and strategic coherence. Early on, HMGN 
decided that the Tenth Plan (FY02/03-FYO6/07) would form the basis for its PRS. Many of the past 
plans, however, have suffered from a number of weaknesses, including in general an overly optimistic 
fiscal framework and limited focus on implementation, monitoring and evaluation. Therefore, while 
relying on the planning framework that was familiar to HMGN, the NPC managed to build the recent 
reform experience (in particular IAP and MTEF) into the PRS and make it a far more credible strategy 
than any recent five-year plans. 

26. 
The PRS identifies reducing the overall poverty ratio from about 40% to 30% by the end of the 
Tenth Plan (FY06/07) as its key target. Other targets include: (i) raising the above 15 literacy rate from 
49% to 63%; (ii) reducing the infant mortality rate from 64 to 45 per 1,000 live births; (iii) raising life 
expectancy from 62 to 65 years; and (iv) increasing access to drinking water to 85% of the population 
(from 72%), access to electricity to 55% (from 40%), and providing telephone facilities to every VDC. 
To meet these objectives, the PRS is formulated around four key pillars: 

0 

0 

Achieving sustained high and broad-based economic growth, focusing particularly on the rural 
economy; 
Accelerating human development through a renewed emphasis on effective delivery of basic 
social services and economic infrastructure; 
Ensuring social and economic inclusion of the poor, marginalized groups and less developed 
regions; and 
Vigorously pursuing good governance both as a means of delivering better development results, 
and ensuring social and economic justice. 

0 

0 

27. 
In implementing these pillars, the strategy stresses four cross-cutting themes: (i) re-defining the 
role of the State and limiting public interventions; (ii) promoting private sector development and enlisting 
the involvement of the private sector, Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs), International Non- 
Governmental Organizations (INGOs) and Community Based Organizations (CBOs); (iii) supporting 
greater social diversity in the structure of governance at all levels, and more socially and geographically 
inclusive access to social and economic services; and (iv) accelerating the decentralization process, 
including community participation in and management of activities at the local levels. 

28. 
The PRS recognizes that the four pillars are closely inter-related and address different aspects of 
the same problem. Nevertheless, each pillar is described separately both in the PRS and below. 
Furthermore, as a foundation for broad-based economic growth, the PRS recognizes the need for an 
appropriate enabling environment and macroeconomic stability. Thus, the PRS incorporates a sustainable 
macroeconomic framework, whose objectives include: (i) maintaining fiscal discipline; (ii) ensuring 
efficient use of public resources; and (iii) sustaining monetary and external stability. This is 
complemented by a structural reform agenda that aspires to make the public sector more diverse, efficient 
and effective, remove constraints to private sector competitiveness and improve the conditions of the 
poor. In this regard, key reforms are envisioned in: (i) public finance, including public expenditure 
management-i.e., 
implementation of the MTEF; (ii) financial sector reform; (iii) improving the 
competitiveness of private sector, including trade and labor market reform; (iv) governance, including 
civil service reform and decentralization; and (v) promoting private sector involvement in infrastructure.

Broad-Based Economic Growth 

Paae 12 of 34 

29 . 

The PRS argues that higher growth will be achieved through greater productivity in agriculture 
and non-agriculture, along with recovery in manufacturing, tourism and exports. The agricultural growth 
strategy-the Agricultural Perspective Plan (APP)-aims 
to modernize, diversify and commercialize crop 
and livestock production by expanding the use of technology and increasing the access of farmers to 
modem agricultural inputs and credit. This strategy is closely linked to ground water development (Le,, 
irrigation strategy), increasing rural infrastructure (i.e., rural electrification and rural roads) and 
sustainable development of the forestry sector. 

30. 

In the non-agriculture sector- 
for which manufacturing, trade (see Box 
5 ) , tourism, transport, construction, and 
financial and 
social 
services 
are 
explicitly 
recognized as key 
sub- 
sectors-the 
emphasis is on reducing 
the role of the State in economic 
activities and creating an environment 
more conducive 
to private 
sector 
investment. The strategy includes: (i) 
removing the impediments to private 
sector development; (ii) accelerating 
privatization of state owned enterprises 
(SOEs)I4; (iii) streamlining regulatory 
processes and making 
them more 
transparent; (iv) amending labor laws to 
make 
them more flexible; and (v) 
introducing 
important private-sector 
friendly legislation and judicial reform. 
In parallel, reforms will be implemented 
in corporate and financial governance. 

Box 5: Improving Nepal’s Trade and Competitiveness 

The trade to GDP ratio in Nepal is about 50%. With 
regard to exports, Nepal is dependent on a relatively small 
number of products-ready-made garments and carpets account 
for nearly 60% of exports-with 
exports to North America, 
Europe and India accounting for 95% of the total. Despite this 
narrow basis, trade was a key factor behind the acceleration of 
Nepal’s economic growth in the 1990s. 
Along with Sri Lanka, Nepal has the most liberalized 
trade policy in South Asia. However, there are significant 
constraints-including delays in customs and transshipment, an 
extremely rigid formal 
labor market, infrastructure, and 
ineffective and unpredictable public sector policies and 
institutions-that 
constrain the country’s trade prospects. A 

recently completed study-The Nepal Trade and Competitiveness 

Study led by the Bank under the auspices of the Integrated 
Framework (IF)-provides 
recommendations on key issues, such 
as Nepal’s accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO), 
improving competitiveness and productivity, and facilitating 
trade. Nepal faces significant challenges for realizing its export 
potential in the medium term, including the forthcoming phasing 
out of the MFA, the accession of China into the WTO and a more 
restrictive trade treaty with India. As improving competitiveness 
is an important component of the growth agenda, the Bank will 
continue to work closely with Nepal’s other development 
partners supporting follow up of the key IF recommendations. 

31. 

The PRS places importance on 
infrastructure 
development 
in 
facilitating private sector development, 
and hence gives priority to the strategic 
road network, maintenance of major roads and highways, and expansion of infrastructure in electricity 
and communications. The intention is for the private sector to play a more prominent role in these 
sectors, as well as to clarify the roles and responsibilities of private and public operators. Examples of 
reforms initiated a n d o r envisioned in the near future include: (i) in roads, improving road maintenance 
through establishment of an autonomous Road Fund Board and transferring to DDCs the responsibility 
for development and maintenance of rural roads; (ii) in electricity, internal unbundling of the Nepal 
Electricity Authority (NEA), establishment of a PDF and creation of an independent regulatory agency; 
and (iii) in information and communications, conversion of the Nepal Telecommunications Corporation 
(NTC) into a public company under the Company Act, opening up general and rural telecommunication 
services to the private sector and establishment o f a legal framework creating functional autonomy of the 
postal service. 
Infrastructure development is also critical for agricultural growth and productivity 

14 

While budgetary transfers to SOEs averaged 1.8% of GDP over the last three years, total contingent 
liabilities are unknown. To estimate privatization costs, HMGN has stepped up carrying out audits in 
public enterprises and Bank sector work in this area is planned for FY05 (see Table 4). 

Nepal Country Assistance Strategy 

Page 13 of 34 

improvements, and as such, the strategy emphasizes the infrastructure developments needed to meet these 
objectives. 

32. 
Finally, it is recognized that a strong financial system is of critical importance for private sector 
development. In this respect, the PRS envisions continuing implementation of Financial Sector Strategy 
(FSS), which includes among other things: (i) restructuring and privatizing the two large ailing state 
banks; (ii) strengthening the monitoring and regulatory capacity of the Central Bank; and (iii) 
strengthening the legislative and institutional framework for the sector. 

Social Sector Development 

33. 
The PRS outlines the importance of improving service delivery through a gradual process of 
decentralization and greater empowerment of local communities in the management of social services. In 
education, guided by the goal of ‘education for all,’ the strategy aims at improving the access to and 
quality of primary education. In doing so, a key objective is to expand literacy programs, with special 
emphasis on improving educational attainment and thus, the livelihood opportunities of historically 
excluded groups, especially girls, Dalits and disadvantaged ethnic groups. At higher levels-i.e., 
secondary, vocational/technical and tertiary-the 
objectives are similar, with emphasis on producing 
manpower with higher skill levels. To achieve this, the strategy is to decentralize management of schools 
to local school management committees (SMCs) at the lower levels and to the governing body of the 
individual institutions at the tertiary level, This process at the primary level-a 
fundamental shift from 
the currently centrally-managed system-has begun over the past year with over 250 schools transferred 
by end-September 2003 and an additional 500 applications pending approval. In addition, the strategy 
envisions implementing a program of targeted scholarship programs for girls and children from Dalit and 
disadvantaged ethnic minority families. 

34. 
In health, the objective is to increase and extend essential health care services to all, with special 
emphasis on poor populations living in rural areas. To this end, the sector strategy focuses on 
implementing an essential health care package that is based on preventative care, maternal and child 
health, and family planning. Improvements in service delivery are also expected to occur through a 
process of devolving health facilities-starting with sub-health posts-to 
local communities and working 
increasingly with the private sector and NGOs. Related to this, the PRS elaborates on the importance of 
access to safe water for health outcomes and aims to increase access in rural areas. Key actions focus on 
rehabilitation and maintenance of existing projects, and developing new projects using the demand-driven 
user group participation and empowerment approaches supported by the Rural Water Supply and 
Sanitation Fund Development Board (Le., ‘Fund Board’). In urban areas, the focus will be on improving 
delivery of utility services, and water supply and sanitation management in some major towns is to be 
contracted out to the private sector over the next few years. 

Social Inclusion and Targeted Programs 

35. 
At the core of this pillar is a specific commitment that in the implementation of all PRS pillars, 
efforts to reduce gender and ethnidcaste-related disparities will be mainstreamed, and in new programs 
emphasis will be placed on ensuring equity of access for all, with special attention to the most vulnerable. 
In addition, the PRS proposes targeted programs for women and the most vulnerable poor ethnic 
minorities living in remote areas. The PRS reviews the weaknesses of past efforts and discusses using 
new mechanisms (e.g., the Poverty Alleviation Fund-PAF) 
and analytical tools (e.g., poverty mapping 
data) to improve effectiveness. The PRS also stresses the need for ‘quick results’ in order to gain the 
confidence of those who have thus far been left behind by development efforts. 

Nepal Country Assistance Strategy 

Page 14 of 34 

36. 
The PRS lists a number of areas-including 
agriculture, forestry, wage employment and social 
sectors-where 
special efforts will be made to mainstream and empower women, Dalits and the 
disadvantaged through a variety of means, including targeted programs. Other reforms include: (i) 
revising existing laws to eliminate legal discrimination against women; and (ii) implementing affirmative 
action programs to increase the social diversity of public service. The approach to mainstreaming 
deprived communities and other vulnerable groups will be similar, in that emphasis will be placed on 
ensuring social inclusion in all programs. 

37. 
Recognizing the limited effectiveness of targeted programs in the past, the PRS has adopted some 
new approaches, including, among others: (i) merging programs similar in nature; (ii) establishing PAF as 
an umbrella organization for targeted programs; and (iii) adopting a population and poverty-based 
resource allocation formula for fund transfer to the districts. To achieve its goals the PRS proposes to 
implement an integrated infrastructure development program (drinking water, small irrigation, schools, 
health posts and trails) in remote areas through local government, CBOs and NGOs. 

38. 
In parallel, HMGN has shown serious commitment to addressing the inclusion agenda at the 
political level. In the context of the last round of peace talks, while adhering to constitutional monarchy 
and multi-party democracy, HMGN also proposed far-reaching reforms to the parliamentary system. The 
proposals included, among other things: (i) proportional representation in Parliament (as opposed to the 
‘ first-past-the-post’ system copied from the Westminster model); (ii) reforms to ensure wider 
representation in the Upper House of Parliament; (iii) strengthening of the prime ministerial system (with 
a provision to allow non-elected technocrats to be included in the cabinet); (iv) constitutional reservations 
for under-served and under-represented groups; (v) consolidation of local government structures, and 
wider powers and responsibilities to the local level; and (vi) a constitutional provision for referenda on 
issues of national significance. 

Good Governance 

39. 
The PRS recognizes that improving governance is essential if the reforms are to stimulate pro- 
poor growth, improve service delivery and lay the foundation for lasting peace. HMGN’s strategy to 
improve governance covers: (i) civil service; (ii) financial management and accountability; and (iii) 
decentralization. While HMGN has made some ‘progress in improving human resource management 
practices over the past few years-most 
notably through the creation of a computerized personnel 
information system-the PRS recognizes that additional progress is needed to make the civil service more 
efficient, accountable and transparent. Future actions include: (i) reforming public employment through 
introduction of merit-based recruitment and evaluation systems and a long-term pay policy, as well as 
right-sizing, improving the capacity and skills mix, and introducing an affirmative action program; (ii) 
improving financial management and accountability through among other thmgs, implementing the 
recommendations of the recent Country Financial Accountability Assessment; and (iii) implementing the 
anti-corruption strategy, in part through the enactment of an Anti-Money Laundering Act” and 
strengthening key institutions charged with fighting corruption, including the National Vigilance Center 
and the CIAA. 

15 

Related to this, last year HMGN expressed interest in receiving assistance to begin the process of 
establishing a regime to protect the financial sector from money laundering and the financing of terrorism 
(AML/CFT). If legislation is enacted as envisioned, a number of steps-including 
establishing an action 
plan for issuing regulations and guidelines, and creating the necessary institutional structures-will 
be 
required to implement and enforce the new law. The Bank stands ready to assist in these efforts.

C. 

Assessment of the PRS 

40. 
The Tenth Plan/PRS has been 
developed in the context of the current 
political turmoil 
in Nepal in a relatively 
participatory manner (see Box 6). Although it 
stands on the tradition of the periodic plan 
process, the PRS has been able to break from 
the historical baggage of the established 
process in a number of important ways. While 
the implementation strategy of the PRS is not 
as sharply explained as one might like, the 
PRS relies on several strategic and cross- 
cutting 
instruments 
to achieve 
its basic 
objectives, including: (i) decentralization; (ii) 
re-defining 
the 
role of 
the State and 
reinforcing market functions; (iii) changing 
public 
service delivery modalities; 
(iv) 
strengthening accountability mechanisms; (v) 
maintaining macro/financial discipline and 
improving public expenditure management; 
(vi) targeted programs; and (vii) increasing 
investment in infrastructure and agriculture. 

41. 
Beyond the more thoughtful structure 
of the poverty-focused strategy, there are 
several things that give the Tenth Plan/PRS 
considerable credibility, including: 

Box 6 : The PRS Consultation Process 

The Tenth Plan/PRS adopted a participatory and relatively 
‘bottom up’ approach. An extensive consultation process 
was initiated at various levels to discuss and solicit feedback 
on the ideas and recommendations presented in various 
drafts. Consultations were initiated in August 2000 with 
numerous public meetings held-two 
exclusively with 
women’s groups-in 
eastern, central and western Nepal 
bringing together representatives from all 75 DDCs and all 
facets of civil society (Le., socially excluded, minorities, 
academics, private sector, NGOs/CBOs). Additional regional 
consultations were held in June 2001 to discuss the draft 
Tenth Plan Approach Paper, as well as linkages between 
district plans and the national plan. The Approach Paper was 
then finalized and discussed in the National Development 
Committee (NDC)-composed of all Ministers, Secretaries, 
and representatives of all political parties, private sector, 
academia, ethnic minorities, labor unions, women, NGOs 
and CBOs-in 
January 2002. These efforts were 
complemented by consultations organized fkom time to time 
by various agencies responsible for developing key sectoral 
programs, thematic chapters and background papers. 
Throughout this process, broad consensus and wide support 
have been developed for the PRSheforms. However, the 
conflict likely constrained the consultation process in some 
parts of the country and HMGN intends to address this once 
it is feasible. With support from the development partners 
HMGN 
is developing a comprehensive participatory 
implementation, monitoring and evaluation strategy. The 
exercise will be completed by end-2003, with civil society to 
play a prominent role in monitoring efforts. 

0 Acknowledging 
the difficulty of 
getting away from the tradition of an ‘all 
encompassing plan’ document, NPC 
condensed the voluminous Tenth Plan in the traditional mold into a lean summary-Le., 
the PRS. 
This shows HMGN’s ability to be selective and strategic, indicating the seriousness attached to the 
PRS . 
0 The PRS is backed by the MTEF, giving budget prioritization a serious framework. Also, the 
performance-based cash release system for the high priority projects is forcing a greater focus on 
implementation performance. 
0 Through the IAP, HMGN has succeeded in being selective in reform actions and building an 
internal consensus on the absolute necessity for implementing the relatively few commitments made 
under the IAP. HMGN now intends to use the annual IAP process as the instrument to ensure 
implementation of a small set of key reforms to support the PRS on a priority basis.I6 By recognizing 
its own implementation capacity limitations and by devising a practical instrument to manage this 
problem, HMGN has shown a real seriousness about implementing the PRS. 
0 The reformers are far more serious about poverty reduction, with particular focus on inclusion. 
One thing the insurgency has done is to force the Kathmandu-based power elite to think about Nepal 
as a nation state that will survive only if glaring disparities in living standards, and access to political 

16 

In a sense, IAP is the equivalent of the MTEF with regard to ‘reform implementation resources. 

Nepal Country Assistance Strategy 

Page 16 o f 3 4 

and economic powers are rectified. This seriousness is reflected in a frank admission in the PRS 
about past failures and exclusionary consequences of poor public policies and commitment to 
addressing them; and 
0 The people are demanding the kind of changes that the PRS envisions, thereby giving the PRS the 
political impetus, legitimacy and sustainability. 

42. 
Thus, the PRS, combined with the MTEF and IAP, form a sound basis on which to build the 
Bank’s CAS.17 A Joint Staff Assessment (JSA) of the PRS was carried out by staff of the Bank and the 
IMF in July 2003.18 In addition to highlighting the strengths of the PRSP-many 
of which are listed 
above-the 
JSA suggests a number of shortcomings and challenges on which HMGN will have to focus 
on in the coming year, including the need to: 

0 

0 

Identify the sources of growth, along with the key linkages to poverty reduction; 
Address gaps in costing and prioritization, and link these to the annual budget and MTEF; 
Implement a coherent monitoring and evaluation strategy, including building capacity for poverty 
monitoring within a clear institutional framework; and 
Further elaborate pro-poor rural strategies, especially to ensure social inclusion through changes 
in the way in which public services are delivered in all sectors.

THE COUNTRY ASSISTANCE STRATEGY 

The Context 

The Bank finds itself in a particularly strong partnership with HMGN. More specifically: 

A. 

43. 

0 While many aid agencies maintained high levels of aid to Nepal in recent years, the Bank took a 
firm position on governance and sharply cut back new lending during FY99-FY02. Highlighting 
poor governance as the central obstacle to development, the Bank’s stance strongly resonated with the 
reform-minded in Nepal. It has also convinced HMGN that the Bank is not driven by any ‘lending 
pressure’ and that it is truly concerned with poverty reduction. The Bank can, therefore, engage in 
policy dialogue from a position of considerable credibility; 
0 The Bank has been closely supporting several key reform measures taken over the last few years, 
including the MTEF, the IAP, financial sector and transfer of public schools to community 
management. This has established unusually strong collaboration between the reform leaders and the 
Bank. In many areas, the Bank is relied on as a trusted advisor to the reformers, giving the Bank an 
important role as a ‘facilitator of change’; and 
0 The Bank is the only donor with significant headroom for increasing lending levels just when 
HMGN is in serious need of additional resources, especially programmatic support. This gives the 
Bank not only strong influence, but also a heavy responsibility as the fiscal ability to implement the 
PRS may depend to a large extent on what the Bank decides to do. 

17 

18 

These are also the basis for the IMF PRGF. For more details on the IMF program in Nepal, see footnote 41 
and Appendix IV. 

The complete PRS policy matrix is contained in Annex B1 1. T h s matrix-in which the outcomes and 
milestones supported by this CAS are highlighted-also 
elaborates other donor support to realizing the 
PRS objectives and outcomes. 

Nepal Country Assistance Strategy 

Page 17 of 34 

44. 
Furthermore, in each of the PRS pillar areas, the Bank has already undertaken considerable 
background work, and as such, has a strong base to build on. In broad-based economic growth, the 
Bank’s assistance over the last few years has focused heavily on the quality of public expenditures, the 
soundness of the financial system and the investment climate (see Box 7). The Bank has also supported 
reforms and investments in key infrastructure sectors, like the main road network, inland container 
terminals and customs facilities, rural roads, power generation, and telecommunications.’9 In agriculture, 
the Bank has supported transfer of small irrigation schemes to farmer management, and improvement in 
research and extension services. 

45. 
In human development, the Bank has 
focused on improving the quality of education 
and health care, through a HMGN-led, sector- 
wide approach. Supported by the analytical 
work completed in FYOl (i.e., Priorities a n d 
Strategy in Education Sector Reform) 
there 
has been considerable progress in basic and 
primary education, with a number of donors 
participating in a basket funding approach to a 
common program. The Bank has also played 
a pivotal role in supporting the transfer of 
public schools to community management. In 
health, the Bank is actively supporting an 
important shift to a sector-wide approach, as 
well as the devolution of sub-health posts to 
local communities. Furthermore, the Bank has 
been 
instrumental 
in expanding demand- 
driven, community-based rural water and 
sanitation schemes. 

Box 7: The Business Environment in Nepal 
An investment climate survey-The Business Environment 
and Manufacturing Performance in Nepal-was 

finalized 
in FYO1. Based on a survey of private manufacturing 
enterprises, the report’s key findings are that poor 
implementation of reforms, bureaucratic burdens and 
continued politicaVpolicy uncertainties are the greatest 
obstacles to doing business in Nepal. More specifically, 
although policies are often perceived as well-designed, 
they are often changed and implemented so inconsistently 
that they contribute to an unpredictable and risky business 
environment. In addition, firms suffer considerably from 
excessive bureaucratic red tape, long delays in provision 
of public services and having to deal with corrupt public 
officials. These problems are often facilitated by lack of 
clarity in laws and regulations, and unpredictability and 
inconsistencies in policies. The implementation of the tax 
regime, import regime and labor laws are specific areas 
that significantly affect f m s and need to be urgently 
addressed. Private 
sector 
development-including 
e s t ab l i shg a supportive business environment-will 
an important theme in the Bank’s work under the broad- 
based economic growth pillar. 

be 

46. 
In the area of inclusion, aided by a

note-Towards

Approach 
a n d 
d&entralization-the 
Bank has led the dialogue on the PAF and encouraged HMGN to use this as the 
main instrument to reach out to marginalized groups that tend to be overlooked by existing institutions. 
In specific community-based p r o j e c t s - e . g . , Rural Water and Sanitation-the Bank has begun to address 
social exclusion issues more vigorously. In promoting universal primary education, the Bank has also 
been engaging HMGN to design ways to improve access by disadvantaged groups. 

47. 
In governance, the Bank has taken a very clear and strong stance since the last CAS. The 
reforms in public expenditure management and banking are a s much about governance as efficiency. 
Decentralization has also been a key focus area, both through specific projects that have tried to give local 
governments greater roles--e.g., Rural Infrastructure LL-and 
through analytical work-focusing 
especially on the fiscal decentralization framework. The Bank, in close coordination with committed 
HMGN teams, has conducted a Country Procurement Assessment Review (CPAR, FYO1) and C o u n t y 
F inanc ia l Accountability Assessment (CFAA, FY02), and in each case is following up with Institutional 
Development Fund (IDF) grants to strengthen relevant institutions and implement main policy

recommendations (see Appendix V). Finally, anti-corruption actions have been a continual theme in the 
Bank’s policy dialogue. 

B. 

The Bank’s Strategy for FY04-FY07 

The Strategy: PRS-Based and Outcomes-Focused 

48. 
The Bank’s strategy will build on the achievements under the 1998 CAS-which 
in short were to 
facilitate the beginnings of determined reform efforts-and 
support the Nepali-led reform process in a 
significant span and depth. Thus, in operational terms, it may seem to be simply supporting key elements 
under each of the PRS pillars. It is, however, backed by a successful process of supporting the reform 
dynamics that have been gaining strength. This strategy was presaged in the CAS PR which articulated 
continuation of focus on improving governance-by 
bringing resources to grassroots levels and 
improving development effectiveness-but with increased emphasis on growth and inclusion. The seven 
broad strategic instruments associated with the PRS (see paragraph 40) are equally important in the 
approach the Bank has emphasized. Furthermore, the spirit of focus on selective outcomes embodied in 
the IAP is consistent with the outcomes-based approach that has been pursued in the Bank’s work 
program in Nepal for the last two years. 

49. While it is easy to agree that the focus should be on development outcomes, it is not so easy to 
define the Bank’s accountability for such outcomes, for in the end the Bank’s role is only to facilitate or 
support the changes in a country. Thus, there is a danger that an attempt to hold staff ‘accountable’ for 
outcomes will lead the Bank to select only outcomes that are nearly certain. Clearly, failing to support 
riskier but more important outcomes would be a mistake. To resolve this tension, a structure has been 
developed over the last two years and the same approach is envisioned for the future. Specifically, 

0 An ‘outcome’ is a significant change that would be highly desirable and possible within the four- 
year CAS horizon. For the immediate year ahead, a specific ‘milestone’-Le., key step toward 
achieving the four-year outcome-is defined; 
0 Each outcome is expected to have less than 100% probability of happening, even with best efforts 
on the part of the Bank2’ 
The matrix of outcomes is seen as a ‘portfolio’ in its entirety-i.e., 
consisting of some high- 
probability, but relatively low-impact outcomes and some low-probability, but high-impact outcomes. 
To avoid extremes, the portfolio of outcomes is constructed with an expected overall success rate of 
around 65-70%;21 
The matrix and annual milestones are updated each year, with some outcomes replaced-ither 
through achievement or a change in strategic priorities-and new milestones defined; 
Rather than holding staff accountable for achievement of specific outcomes, the Country Team is 
collectively held accountable for the overall outcome of the portfolio;22 and 

20 

21 

22 

In practice, the probabilities of 20, 40, 60 or 80% are assigned, recognizing the relatively crude nature of 
the probability assessments. 

This does not imply that for outcomes that are not fully achieved, there will be no progress. In many cases, 
it is likely that some progress toward the ultimate outcome will have been made. 

Unless an entirely unforeseen event changes the country setting profoundly, a significant shortfall in 
reaching the expected rate of achievement would mean either: (i) the initial assessment or strategy was 
unrealistic; or (ii) the Bank’s efforts were inadequate. 

Nepa l Country Ass is tance S tra tegy

The same approach is applied to a set of annual milestones as well, so that annual performance 
can be monitored against some expected overall achievement rate. 

50. 
Based on this framework for work programming, this CAS has identified 15 PRS areas-out 
of 
the 34 PRS areas-that 
are central to poverty reduction and are consistent with the Bank’s relative 
strengths vis-a-vis Nepal’s other development partners. They spell out the broad ‘development results’ or 
outcomes that the CAS will focus on. While the importance of these results are obvious, the CAS 
timefi-ame is too short to set direct and measureable targets for them. Therefore, these 15 higher level 
outcomes are translated into 26 intermediate outcomes--corresponding 
to the base case scenario 
described in paragraph 64-that 
are specific and meaningful for the FY04-FY07 period. In a high case 
scenaric-with 
acceleration of reforms-the matrix would likely be updated to include more outcomes. 
These outcomes were selected based on four key criteria: 

In each priority area, the outcome is representative of the broader change envisioned by the PRS. 
Thus, it is not the only change expected. If this particular change is happening, many associated 
changes are likely happening, thereby contributing to the larger PRS goals; 
0 As much as possible, the outcomes should be linked to an action in the IAP to ensure high 
priority accorded by HMGN; 
In general, the outcome is clearly defined, measurable and feasible;23 and 
In applying the selectivity principle, the Bank has a comparative advantage in facilitating the 
outcome and has a well-developed strategy to contribute materially to its realization.

5 1. 
The outcomes matrix is organized around the four PRS pillars and presented in two parts. The 15 
areas and 26 specific outcomes for the CAS period are displayed in Table 3. A more detailed matrix 
(see Annex BlO) describes briefly, for each outcome, the Bank’s strategy for achieving it, annual 
milestones, Bank instruments and key partners. Specific annual milestones for FY04 are provided for 
each outcome with some additional milestones for subsequent years. As noted, these annual milestones 
are updated each year, and as such, milestones for FY05, FY06 and FY07 should be seen more as 
indicative. The more detailed matrix also links the CAS outcomes to specific country outcomes identified 
in the PRS, showing the strong linkage between the Bank’s contributions and the country’s goals as 
established in the PRS.24 

Cross Cutting Themes 

52 . 
Gender and Social Inclusion. For the successful implementation of this CAS, there are a 
number of cross cutting themes-specifically, gender and social inclusion, fiduciary and environmental 
policies, and capacity building-that 
deserve special mention. In rural areas, the women’s critical role as 
economic p rov ide r s -e i the r through unpaid labor on the family farm or as wage workers for others-is 
widely recognized. Indeed, the poorer the family, the greater its reliance on the skills and labor of female 
family members for economic survival. While there is great variation in the gender systems of different 
ethnic and caste groups in Nepal, all of them to some extent discriminate against women in terms of 
access to property, investments in health and especially education, and in the degree to which women’s 
voices are heard in community decision-making or national governance. 

23 

24 

Certain outcomes are stated rather generally for lack of a better definition. In such cases, however, annual 
milestones tend to be quite specific to help clarify the kind of change the CAS hopes to support. 

In the PRS matrix in Annex B11, in addition to linking the CAS outcomes to the PRS outcomes, the 
specific intermediate indicators/activities corresponding to each of the milestones are also highlighted.

53. 
Gender is clearly one important dimension of social exclusion in Nepal, however, more 
recently-especially in the years following the reinstitution of democracy-o ther dimensions of social 
exclusion-namely 
caste and ethnicity-have 
come into greater prominence as indigenous groups 
(Janajati) and formerly ‘low caste’ (Dalit) groups have been able to organize and speak out. In response 
to this-and 
to the insurgents criticism that the Nepali state has largely been in the hands of males from 
the dominant caste and ethnic groups-the PRS has recognized the disparities resulting from gender, 
ethnicity and caste. To better understand the institutional underpinnings of caste, ethnic and gender-based 
social and economic exclusion in Nepal and how these affect poverty outcomes-as well as the options 
for policy and institutional reforms-a Social and Gender Analysis is currently being carried out and will 
be completed in FY04. Furthermore, in all interventions-cspecially 
in the sector-wide approaches to be 
employed in education, rural water supply and hea l th -e f fo r t s will be made to ensure that social and 
gender inclusion issues are explicitly recognized and receive close attention. To ensure that gender and

social aspects are fully integrated at both the project and policy level work of the Nepal program, in the 
last year a Lead Social Scientist was posted in Kathmandu.” 

54. 
Fiduciary and Environmental Policies. Similarly, in implementing the CAS, ensuring 
adherence to sound fiduciary and environmental policies will be crucial. As mentioned, a CPAR was 
finalized in FYOl and a CFAA was completed in FY02 (see Appendix V), with IDF grants supporting 
implementation of the key recommendations.26 While the legal and regulatory framework for ensuring 
public sector financial accountability is impressive, implementation-including 
compliance with the 
framework-is 
generally weak. In the area of procurement, very few countries today still follow the 
system used by Nepal-under which public procurement is governed by a set of financial rules issued by 
the Government-and hence, the major need is to enact a modern, transparent, and competitive publi 
procurement law.

Despite a rather comprehensive 
framework for environmental protection, in 
addition 
to weak capacity and poor 
coordination, 
the main 
environmental 
challenges 
in Nepal pertain 
to 
the 
sustainable use of natural resources and 
adequate 
integration of 
environmental 
planning in development programs and their 
implementation. In response, HMGN has 
incorporated conservation activities 
in 
selected sectoral plans and programs, while 
environment-related provisions have been 
incorporated in various acts (see Box 8). 
Among the accomplishments: (i) the donor- 
supported Community Forest Program has 
been successful 
in helping 
to reverse 
deforestation 
in 
the hill 
regions; 
(ii) 
endangered mammal species have been 
recovered in the Terai; and (iii) careful 
attention to designated conservation areas 
supported by 
eco-tourism have had 
important impacts on poor and remote rural 
communities. 
Beyond 
the 
five key 
environmental issues-forest 
depletion, soil 
degradation, solid waste management, water 
quality and air pollution-a 
number of new 
challenges have emerged, such as rapid but 
uncontrolled and haphazard urbanization 
(resulting partially from 
insecurity and 
violence in rural areas), glacial lake outburst 
floods, 
arsenic 
contamination 
of 
groundwater, indoor air pollution from

Box 8: The Response to Environmental Challenges 
HMGN has 
responded 
to 
the environmental 
challenges by 
incorporating conservation activities 
in 
sectoral plans and programs. Furthermore, environment- 
related provisions have been incorporated in various acts 
such as: (i) the Local Self-Governance Act (1998) that 
specifies the role of DDCs and VDCs in environmental 
planning, forest and biodiversity conservation, land-use 
management, and public sanitation; (ii) the Forest Act 
(1 992), and the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation 
Act (1973 and amended in 1993) that provide for community 
involvement in forest management and species conservation; 
and (iii) the Environment Protection Act (1996) and the 
Environment Protection Rules (1 997) tha t contain provisions 
for institutionalizing environmental impact assessment and 
expanding pollution control activities. In addition, a National 
Environmental Policy and Action Plan was prepared (1993) 
to help implement Agenda 21 of the Rio Earth Summit; an 
Environment Protection Council was constituted as a policy 
advisory body (1992); and a Ministry of Population and 
Environment (MoPE) was established (1995). Nepal is a 
party to 16 environment-related international Conventions 
and Agreements, including CITES and ITTA. 
Despite these efforts to address environmental 
management, weak 
institutional 
capacity 
and poor 
coordination between MoPE and sectoral agencies has 
constrained the implementation of environmental policies 
and programs. There is also a significant gap between the 
content of the international environmental conventions and 
their implementation at the national level. There are many 
donors ( e g , Denmark, Germany, UNDP, UNEP) and 
international (e.g., WWF, IUCN) and national (e.g., King 
Mahendra Trust for Conservation of Nature) NGOs active in 
the environmental arena and funding is not a constraint. 

25 

26 

This has been made possible in part through the generous support of the United Kingdom’s Department for 
International Development (Dff D) . 

It is important to note, however, that the team looks at fiduciary issues in a much broader context than that 
covered by the CFAA. See Box 9 for details. 

Nepal Country Assistance Strategy

biomass burning and food contamination. With the large donor and NGO presence, Bank involvement in 
the environmental agenda will be selective and focus on helping HMGN articulate an effective strategy 
for environmental conservation and management and capacity building. Accordingly, a Country 
Environmental Analysis (CEA) is planned for FY05. Using this as a basis, we would focus on possible 
outcomes for Bank support and then determine appropriate instruments. Given Nepal’s biological 
diversity, however, there are possibilities for use of funds from the Global Environmental Facility 
(GEF)-e.g., 
support to sustainable gathering, processing and marketing of high value plants and herbs, 
micro-hydropower, or remediation of glacial lake outburst floods. There are also good prospects for 
implementation of programs supported by the Prototype Carbon Fund (PCF) and the Community Carbon 
Fund (CCF) 

56. 
Capacity Building. 
As institutional weaknesses and lack of capacity are well-recognized 
constraints, an important cross cutting theme of the CAS is capacity building. According to some 
estimates, over US$lOO million per year is spent by donor agencies and INGOs in Nepal on what can be 
broadly termed ‘capacity building’ activities. The outcome is clearly very disappointing, and both 
HMGN and donors agree that a serious rethinking is in order. There is, however, an entrenched thinking 
to equate provision of consultants and training with capacity building, which in part explains the 
continued attempt to ‘throw money’ at the capacity building challenge. 

57 . 
A strong public sector institution requires: (i) sound institutional set-up; (ii) ‘enabling 
environment’ for the institution-especially a system that shields the institution from undue political 
interference and rewards professional performance; (iii) good people-which 
requires a performance- 
oriented and financially decent incentive system as well as training; and (iv) experience. In Nepal, 
development partners have tended mainly to focus on institutional set-up and training people, without 
paying sufficient attention to the other aspects or finding effective ways to get at them. Improving the 
‘enabling environment’ and creating a performance-oriented incentive system are inherently political 
processes, and donors can only encourage indigenous efforts. Thus, donor support needs to be somewhat 
opportunistic. An important dimension that has tended to be neglected by donors is helping the 
institutions to build experience. If anything, by substituting for HMGN’s own work, development 
partners may have tended to hamper the ability of Nepali institutions to strengthen through experience. 
The Bank’s knowledge in supporting key reform initiatives indicates that capacity building is more about 
creating space for the Nepalis to think for themselves and act on their own, and providing knowledge only 
where it is specifically demanded.27 Money is seldom the real constraint to capacity building in Nepal. 
Based on this perspective, the Bank’s efforts will focus on: 

0 Facilitating country-led changes, as in the end this is what capacity building is about. The 
primary concentration will be on helping HMGN build its own policy formulation and 
implementation capacity at the central level through experience. This effort depends critically on the 
ability of the country-based staff--especially Nepali staff-to 
engage and motivate HMGN 
counterparts in reform thinking, backed by the ability to bring in global knowledge from the rest of 
the Bank and/or internationally as needed. While this concept of decentralization is already working 
well, further efforts will be made, especially to strengthen the capacity of the country-based staff; and 
0 Where there are legitimate needs for more traditional TA and training that arise from the Nepal- 
led and Bank-supported reform efforts, the Bank will continue to be prepared to provide such 
assistance through a variety of means. Since all IDA-funded projects involve important reform 
elements, almost all include TA and/or training components. To maximize their impact, however, the 
Bank relies heavily on identification of needs by the reform leaders themselves. In some areas-such 

21 

Good examples of this are the experience with the introduction of MTEF and development of IAP as noted 
in noted in paragraph 43. 

Nepal Country Assistance Strategy 

Page 23 of 34 

as public expenditure management, monitoring and evaluation in conjunction with PRS 
implementation, and improving financial accountability systems-TA 
and training of central 
importance will be supported by IDF grants and direct TA. 

Instruments to Achieve the CAS Outcomes 

5 8 . 
A critical element for achieving the CAS outcomes is an internal alignment of the work program 
with the outcomes. The formulation of the annual work program is used as an important process to 
develop a consensus on the annual milestones toward achieving the longer term CAS outcomes, and the 
broad strategy and specific instruments to reach those milestones. This has helped to develop organic 
integration of a range of AAA instruments (e.g., formal reports, informal policy notes, TA, seminars, 
policy dialogue, strategic communication) and lending instruments. It has also enabled much more 
effective cross-sectoral efforts directed toward the shared outcomes. This process, combined with regular 
monitoring of progress from the outcomes perspective, is the cornerstone of the outcomes-based 
approach. 

59. 
In relation to many outcomes, AAA will continue to play an important role and will be used more 
consciously to overcome specific obstacles to reforms. During the past four years, while the lending 
program remained in the low case and the work program focused on motivating reforms, the Bank learned 
to use AAA more strategically for engaging Nepali authorities in policy dialogue and has been effective 
in evoking change. The shift by the Bank toward an outcomes-focused approach also changed the nature 
of AAA. From the outset, each AAA piece is conceived as part of a strategy to help facilitate some 
specific development outcome. This has led to two important changes: (i) unlike in the past, 
dissemination of AAA outputs is no longer an afterthought, but is an integral part of the motivation for 
the AAA task itself; and (ii) there is much greater use of small, informal, and targeted reports that are 
designed to help the reform leaders in Nepal 
themselves rather than bulky reports whose target 
audience is often unclear. Under this CAS, these 
trends will continue. In addition to supporting the 
MTEF, IAP and overall structural reform efforts, 
dialogue and TA will continue to be used widely 
to help achieve the CAS outcomes, including in 
power, higher education, fiscal decentralization, 
civil service reform and special interest issues 
such as child labor and traffichng.

Going forward, formal AAA will continue 
to help lay a foundation for building the agenda 
and needed consensus for reform (see Table 4). 
Contributing to 
the completion of all core 
diagnostic pieces2* and helping to prioritize future 
policy reform areas, a Development Policy Review

envisioned for FY05; (ii) a Poverty Assessment was completed in FY99, 
with an update planned for FY05; and (iii) a CEA is planned for FY05.

CAS period, important work will be undertaken analyzing the impacts of the financial sector reforms and 
providing an update of the child labor ~ i tua t ion ,~ ’ as well as continuous public expenditure analysis. 

6 1. 
The In terna t iona l F inance Corpora t ion (IFC) and Mu l t i la tera l Investment Guaran tee 
Agency (MIGA) will both play important-albeit 
relatively limited-roles 
in the implementation of the 
strategy. 
I F C will continue to support export-oriented manufacturing, private investment in 
telecommunications and power generation and distribution, financial market development, and the growth 
of small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Due to the still weak security situation and political 
uncertainties, currently there are few investment opportunities in Nepal large enough for direct financing, 
so IFC does not expect to make many new investments during the CAS period. Instead, IFC will focus on 
technical assistance for SMEs through the South Asia Enterprise Development Facility (SEDF) based in 
Dhaka. This facility-funded by IFC in partnership with Canada, Netherlands, Norway, the UK, Asian 
Development Bank (ADB) and the European Union (EU)-will 
deliver programs in Nepal to increase 
access for SMEs to financing and business development services, improve the business environment for 
SMEs and develop linkages with larger enterprises. SEDF will closely coordinate with the Bank’s efforts 
in the financial sector to provide TA and training to banks, including introducing best practices and new 
products for SME lending. SEDF will also work with selected business associations in the agribusiness 
and tourism sectors. SEDF intends to locate a staff member within the Kathmandu office to manage these 
programs. Over the upcoming CAS period, MIGA will continue to support suitable foreign direct 
investments into Nepal as they present themselves. 

Bank Group Scenarios 

62. 
Given the current rather significant political uncertainties, the CAS must be able to respond 
constructively to a wide range of possible eventualities. Without a doubt, the greatest source of 
uncertainty is the insurgency. If a peace settlement is reached, there will likely be a need for a large scale 
‘nation re-building’ program and the Bank would be expected to be part of ita3’ On the other hand, 
renewed hostilities could turn more intense and severely curtail the ability of HMGN to implement the 
PRS. In either of these extremes or in between, the nature of the reforms envisioned in the PRS will 
remain relevant. Therefore, it is useful to think of the following three scenarios that naturally correspond 
to the standard CAS scenarios: 

0 Base (‘central’) case-in which the hostilities are limited or not severe enough to interfere 
seriously with development work and the current reforms continue to move forward; 
0 Low c a s e i n which renewed hostilities hamper implementation of the PRS-thus, 
reducing the 
external funding n e e d s - o r the reform efforts themselves become stalled-thus, making it difficult to 
justify high levels of IDA funding; and 
0 High case-in which it is assumed that a peace agreement is reached and/or the reforms 
accelerate, thereby creating both a need and environment for larger aid flows. 

29 

30 

This will follow up on Understanding Children’s Work in Nepa l (March 2003 ) . This study-carried out 
jointly with ILO and UNICEF-includes 
a set of recommendations and proposed policy actions that will 
help formulate a more comprehensive framework for handling issues associated with child labor. 

Purposely, the word ‘reconstruction’ is avoided, as the reconstruction needs are llkely to be modest given 
that conflict-affected areas tend to suffer from under-investment. Instead, what is required is a major effort 
to upgrade mfrastructure and social services in these regions that have long been under-served.

A notional base case lending scenario is presented in Table 6 in which the IDA lending program 
would average about US$190 million per year, consistent with Nepal’s current IDA a l l ~ c a t i o n . ~ ’ In each 
year, the lending program would be anchored in a PRSC providing programmatic support to the 
implementation of the PRS/IAP (see Box 9). The first PRSC aims to: (i) support Nepal’s reform 
champions in implementing far-reaching reforms that revive growth, improve service delivery, promote 
social inclusion and improve governance; and (ii) contribute to maintaining a sound macro framework 
and in protecting high priority anti-poverty programs by filling part of Nepal’s financing gap. Future 
PRSCs will focus on key elements that are critical to achieve the CAS outcomes. In the broad-based 
growth pillar, these include: (i) public expenditure management; (ii) labor market; (iii) infrastructure (e.g., 
the main road network and rural roads); and (iv) financial sector reform. In social sector development and 
inclusion, the focus will be on improving service delivery-in 
education, health and waterhanitation-in 
addition to implementing targeted programs for excluded groups. Finally, in governance the focus will be 
on public/civil service reform as well as re-activating and strengthening the decentralization process. 

3 1 

32 

As indicated, the outcomes in Table 3 are those explicitly lmked to the base case scenario and in a high 
case scenario there would likely be more outcomes. 

While the base case envisages an average annual lending program of about US$ l90 million, there is some 
uncertainty associated with the ability of HMGN to implement projects under different security and 
political situations. As such, a realistic range-US$l20-200 million-has been established. 

Nepal Coun t iy Assistance S tra tegy 

Page 26 o f 34 

65. 
In each year, the PRSC would be 
complemented by three or four investment 
or sectoral operations 
to support key 
programs 
in 
the 
focus areas. With 
increasing emphasis on growth, the lending 
program will continue 
to 
focus on 
infrastructure investment. Since the existing 
portfolio already has a strong tilt toward 
infrastructure, 
the base 
case 
lending 
program does not 
show 
large new 
infrastructure projects. 
In part, this also 
recognizes the difficulty of implementing 
large-scale projects during a conflict. 
Nevertheless, if 
the opportunities arise, 
financial support for infrastructure can be 
readily increased through both the PRSC 
and, in case of peace, additional investment 
operations. The necessary technical work 
has been built into the base case program.

Given its low income level, it is 
assumed that Nepal will continue to receive 
a portion of its IDA allocation in the form of 
grants at least for a part of the CAS period.33 HMGN has expressed a preference to use IDA grant 
financing for: (i) key priorities in the social sectors (including for PAF), and (ii) for technical a ~ s i s t a n c e . ~ ~ 
Although the base case lending program represents a significant increase in the level of IDA lending to 
Nepal (the base case was US$70-120 million under the 1998 CAS), this should not pose any debt service 
difficulties. With a highly concessional debt structure, the public debt service to GDP ratio stands at a 
modest 1.6% and external debt servicing is only about 7.5% of exports of goods and non-factor services.35 

67. 
In a low case scenario, the lending volume would be significantly less than in a base case-Le., 
averaging US$O-50 million per year. The nature of IDA assistance in the low case would depend on its 
circumstance. 
If the cause is renewed hostilities-and 
the consequent narrowing of the reach of 
HMGN-then 
it would be appropriate to cut back on investment operations to account for the reduced 
physical scope of reform implementation. On the other hand, if the cause is slow implementation of the 
reforms, then the focus of lending activities would revert back to supporting decentralization and 
community-based projects (which would likely lay the foundation for better governance dynamics in the 
future) and whatever specific reforms that nonetheless managed to proceed at the central level. 

33 

34 

35 

Availability of IDA grants in FY06-FY07 will depend on the outcome of the IDA14 replenishment 
deliberations. 

This is consistent with HMGN’s Foreign Aid Policy (FAP) that states “technical assistance for project 
design, institutional and capacity building, technical backstopping, and project monitoring and review are 
more suitable for grant financing than for concessional loans.” 

Nepal is a ‘less indebted low-income’ country with a ratio of external debt to GDP of 53% and a total 
public debt to GDP ratio of 70% (end FY01/02). IMF simulations suggest that if key variables remained at 
their average value of the last ten years, the total debt to GDP ratio would decline to 53% in FY06107.

accelerating decentralization of basic

the two large commercial banks, and 
deepening implementation of the IAP

FY06 or as the situation warrants. 

Box 9: Financial Management Broadly Defined 

When evaluating whether a country is considered ‘ready’ for 
programmatic support, it is common to evaluate its financial 
management capacity. Financial management, however, should 
not be equated with narrow matters of financial rules and 
regulations. But, it is fundamentally concerned with effective use 
of fmancial resources. First, therefore, fmancial management is 
about good resource allocation. Through the MTEF, HMGN’s 
resource allocations have improved considerably over the last 
two years, eliminating much of the fat, imposing a fm budget 
ceiling and prioritizing development expenditures. Second, 
financial management is about improving service delivery 
modalities. Through many programs initiated during the last two 
years-e.g., 
transferring management of schools and sub-health 
posts 
to 
local communities-HMGN 
has demonstrated 
commitment to improving service delivery. Finally, at the next 
level, financial management is about providing decision-makers 
with sufficient, accurate and timely financial information to 
evaluate: (i) overall public sector financial management 
performance; (ii) stewardship of resources placed under public 
sector control; and (iii) the extent to which resources are used in 
accordance with prescribed budgets and mandates. Although 
admittedly further strengthening is required, there are serious 
programs under way-e.g., 
implementing 
the CFAA 
recommendations, capacity building for accounting and auditing 
staff, and increased monitoring of financial and physical 
progress. Therefore, when looking more broadly at financial 
management, Nepal has come a long way and has fully 
demonstrated its seriousness to tackle the right issues. 

C. 

Portfolio Management 

IDA 

69. 
The operating environment in Nepal has been characterized by weak public management, a low 
skills base, political instability and the aftermath of an armed insurgency that has affected a majority of 
the country’s 75 districts. Despite these heavy odds, project implementation performance and outcomes 
have improved in the last five years. On many accounts-satisfactory outcomes, project sustainability 
and institutional development-performance of the Nepal portfolio substantially improved and compares 
favorably to both the region and Bank (see Table 7 ) . As such, overall the Bank’s contribution to 
development in Nepal in the last five years can no longer be considered as “unsatisfactory in outcomes, 
modest with respect to institutional development impact and highly uncertain in terms of sustainability” 
as summarized in the Country Assistance Evaluation (CAE) by the Operations Evaluation Department 
(OED).36 Furthermore, more recently there has been greater borrower commitment as shown by adequate 
levels of counterpart funding and efforts to improve project staffing and management. While in the past 
project implementation has suffered from political interference-in 
part seen through frequent staff 
transfers-the 
dedication and commitment of reform-minded senior civil servants and project staff have 
helped to achieve the improved outcomes. Perceived or real corruption and lack of accountability in 
public institutions remain a drag on project performance, but recent actions by the public sector to rectify 
these ills should help to improve accountability and strengthen governance.

Following the implementation of Portfolio Implementation Plans (PIPS) in FY99 and FYO037- 
which included actions to improve the performance of individual projects, as well as specific measures to 
address generic issues-there was a remarkable improvement in the status of the Nepal portfolio, with 
projects at risk dropping to 13% of the portfolio. This was not to last, however, as the declaration of a 
national emergency in November 2001 resulted in an escalation of violence and impaired security. This 
affected much of the por tfo l ie-espec ia l ly in the remote and less developed mid- and far-western 
regions-with 
IDA unable to carry out adequate supervision and project activities slowing or even 
coming to a halt in some instances under force majeure. By January 2003, 43% of the projects and over 
70% of IDA commitments were considered at risk, but following the cessation of hostilities, there had 
been a steady improvement and by end-FY03, the portfolio risks have been reduced to more manageable 
levels (see Annex B2). The Bank shares the experience with other donors that truly community-owned 
projects tend to be largely unaffected by the insurgency. 

71. 
The current IDA portfolio in Nepal consists of nine active projects, of which five are due to close 
in the next eighteen months (see Table 8 ) . Active operations as of September 15, 2003 represented an

The FY98 Annual Report on Portfolio Performance identified Nepal as a priority PIP country-i.e., 
a 
country with more than 50% of the portfolio andior more than 33% of commitments at risk, with more than 
eight active projects a n d o r US$250 million in commitments. 

Nepa l C o u n t y Ass is tance Strategy 

Page 29 of 34 

aggregate IDA commitment of about US$298 million (net of cancellations), of which US$167 million 
remains undisbursed. The portfolio declined from fourteen projects in FY98 to eight projects in 
FYOUFY02 as a result of the low lending levels since FY99, closing of aging projects and a deliberate 
policy to ensure adequate quality at entry. With the move to the base case in December 2002, the 
portfolio has increased slightly. 

72. 
Despite the noted improvements, the portfolio remains at risk and could be adversely affected by 
a resumption of insurgent activities or a period of protracted political instability. To mitigate the risks, 
the Bank-primarily 
through the staff in the country office-has 
been proactively supporting and 
monitoring project implementation. In this effort, the Bank, together with HMGN, ADB and the Japan 
Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) have been carrying out joint Nepal Portfolio Performance 
Reviews (NPPRs) since 2000. The main objective of these reviews is to discuss generic issues affecting 
portfolio management-such 
as security, passage of laws and regulations, procurement, financial 
management and safeguards-and 
agree on time-bound action plans to resolve the identified issues. A 
memorandum of understanding is signed by all parties and the actions are closely monitored and reviewed 
semi-annually. The most recent review was conducted in October 2002, with a mid-term review taking 
place in May 2003.38 These joint reviews are complemented by quarterly reviews of the implementation 
progress of IDA projects, along with close supervision and monitoring with frequent site visits. In 
addition to placing emphasis on quality at entry and quality of supervision, Bank staff are active in 
identifying and resolving potential issues before they become problems. 

73. 
A number of initiatives-i.e., 
the preparation of the CPAR, the CFAA and Public Works 
Directives with ADB assistance-have 
provided a sound framework for addressing generic 
implementation issues and improving the general operating environment. Special committees have been 
established to implement the CPAR and CFAA recommendations, and are expected to modernize, as well 
as simplify and streamline, the public procurement and financial accountability regimes, resulting in a 
higher level of transparency in public procurement and enhanced accountability in financial transactions. 
Portfolio Performance is expected to improve further with the implementation of performance-based 
budget allocations and fund releases under the MTEF, and systematic project and program monitoring by 
sector agencies and the NF’C. There is an increasing awareness to strengthen environmental and social 
safeguards in all public investments, but as indicated, implementation remains weak and will require 
continued support. 

IFC 

74. 
IFC’s current held exposure in Nepal is US$79.9 million-US$53.0 million from IFC’s own 
account and US$26.9 million in B loans-in 
four projects, of which two are in private power generation, 
one in tourism and one in leasing. The investment in the tourism sector was restructured as the 
performance of the company suffered due to the political instability and insurgency. The remaining 
portfolio is in good condition, with a loss reserve ratio of only 4% of total exposure. 

MIGA 

75. 
To date, MIGA has facilitated estimated foreign direct investment into Nepal in the amount of 
US$122.4 million. MIGA’s outstanding portfolio in the country consists of four contracts of guarantee 

38 

The mid-term review acknowledged progress and achievements since the NPPR, noting that the reforms 
have had a positive impact on portfolio performance. However, a number of generic issues-including 
effectiveness delays, poor quality of civil works, financial management, and cost and time over-runs-were 
noted as requiring priority action. The 2003 NPPR will be carried out in November.

Box 10: The CAS Consultation Process 
As noted (see Box 6 ) , Nepal’s PRS was prepared 
through a very consultative process. As such, the 
overwhelming focus of the CAS consultations has 
been on aligning donor support around the PRS with 
emphasis on: (i) discussing the Bank’s proposed 
strategy and its relationship to the PRS to ensure that 
in the aggregate, donor support is adequate to cover 
implementation of key PRS programs; and (ii) 
identifying specific areas of collaboration. The Bank 
has worked closely with DfID-which 
is preparing an 
outcomes-focused Country Assistance Plan (CAP)- 
including holding a one-day joint workshop in 
Kathmandu 
to discuss ways 
to support PRS 
implementation effectively. Taking the collaboration 
with DfID to a new level of closeness, DfID and the 
Bank have agreed on a set of PRS-based outcomes as 
the common goals for DfID’s new CAP and the 
Bank’s new CAS. In addition, small focus groups- 
with representatives of HMGN, NGOs and civil 
society-have 
been convened along the way to 
discuss various CAS drafts. To be most effective in 
assisting HMGN implement the PRS, consultation 
with Nepal’s other development partners will be a 
continuous process throughout the CAS lifetime.

In May 2003, the local donor coordination group agreed to break from the tradition of having the United 
Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the Bank as co-chairs and invited HMGN to chair the 
group. 

HMGN has made impressive efforts in the preparation and initial implementation of the FAP that outlines 
objectives, guidelines, strategies and policies aimed at guiding the flow and composition of foreign aid to 
ensure better aid utilization. 

Board presentation of the IMF PRGF is anticipated for mid-November. Overall, IMF-Bank collaboration 
has been excellent. The proposed PRSC I has been prepared in parallel with the PRGF and the two 
institutions are working closely to ensure that the programs relnforce each other. For more information on 
the IMF program in Nepal, see Appendix IV.

In line with the PRS philosophy, various sectoral m in is tr ies-e .g . , education and health-are 
talung a proactive leadership role in the coordination of programs supported by development partners. 
While a shift of this nature takes time, Bank assistance and the deployment of programmatic support 
instruments in particular will provide leverage to Nepali reformers to expand and accelerate this process. 
Where cross-cutting interventions are critical (e.g., in HIV/AIDS) the Bank will work with other 
development partners to improve the framework for inter-agency collaboration and coordination. An 
important part of the coordination effort revolves around selectivity in implementing the PRS and 
ensuring that the key PRS programs can be implemented. The multi-lateral and bi-lateral partnerships for 
implementing the PRS are summarized in Table 9 .

Similar joint support is being developed to assist implementation of the Health Sector Strategy. The 
Ministry of Health has established a Health Sector Reform Committee to lead the reform process, including 
key donors (Germany, IDA, Japan, UNFPA, UNICEF, UK, US and WHO), NGOs, and the private sector. 

Nepa l Country Ass is tance Strategy

78. 
Through two participatory NDFs (2000 and 2002) and the PRS, HMGN has come to engage civil 
society and the private sector more effectively in policy dialogue. Also, in Bank-financed projects, 
HMGN has shown greater willingness to benefit from partnerships with NGOs and CBOs, in particular 
those that involve community mobilization, service delivery and monitoring in remote rural areas. The 
Bank will continue to encouraged these efforts. In addition to policy dialogue, partnerships among 
HMGN, the private sector and the Bank will remain central to the efficient provision and expansion of 
basic infrastructure services, particularly in power and telecommunications. The Bank Group’s capacity 
to work with the private sector will be enhanced with the introduction of the SEDF (see paragraph 61). 
Partnerships in capacity building will also be strengthened with institutions key to development 
effectiveness, such as local bodies and media. As with official partnerships, the Bank’s dialogue and 
coordination with the private sector and civil society will be guided by principles established in the PRS 
with a view towards strengthening national ownership of the development agenda. 

79. 
Helping to reinforce these partnerships, the Bank will continue to communicate its development 
support to Nepal through outreach mechanisms already in place-e.g., 
the Nepal website, and regular 
consultative and dissemination events-as well as partnerships with the media. A Public Information 
Center (PIC)---cun-ently located in the country office-will 
be built up and moved to a publicly 
accessible location and managed in collaboration with an external partner. The Bank will also work 
closely with other donors to support HMGN in the delivery of a strategic communication program built 
around the Tenth P ladPRS . 

B. 

Monitoring Outcomes 

80. 
Given that the CAS supports implementation of the PRS and CAS outcomes are closely aligned 
with PRS outcomes, effective monitoring will only be possible if HMGN’s monitoring and evaluation 
capacity is enhanced. Therefore, much of the Bank’s efforts will be through capacity building to help 
establish an in-country monitoring and evaluation capacity. HMGN’s past efforts have been limited 
largely to expenditure monitoring, with few linkages to outputs and service delivery. Although reviews 
were held every two months within the Ministerial Development Action Committee and quarterly at the 
National Development Committee (NDC-chaired 
by the Prime Minister), a fundamental focus on 
achieving development outcomes was lacking. To redress these weaknesses, since the beginning of 
FY02/03 several initiatives have been started by HMGN to monitor both financial and physical progress, 
including: (i) publishing on the internet detailed work programs with monitorable output indicators for all 
P1 projects; (ii) releasing h n d s based on satisfactory implementation performance, as certified by the line 
m i n i ~ t r i e s ; ~ ~ 
and (iii) regular reporting-through 
the mid-term budget review and other m e a n s - o f 
expenditure performance of P1 projects to the NPC and MOF. Though there have been some delays, the 
system has proven effective, especially in the scarce cash budget management environment. Another new 
initiative has been the monitoring of IAP activities that has led to satisfactory completion of the IAP 
activities and has embedded a culture of joint monitoring/partnership among core ministries. 

8 1. 
Cognizant of the need to align and strengthen HMGN’s integrated financial management system 
with public sector monitoring and evaluation to effectively implement and assess the country’s progress 
in achieving the annual PRS targets towards the MDGs: (i) a Central Monitoring Division has been 
established within the Poverty Monitoring Unit at the NPC; and (ii) the Central Bureau of Statistics has 
been entrusted with gathering survey data for poverty monitoring. HMGN has prepared a poverty- 
monitoring framework, initiated streamlining of the existing surveys to be linked to PRS monitoring and 
identified preliminary indicators under each of the four PRS pillars. Though these indicators are by no 
means complete, efforts are under way to: (i) develop intermediate indicators; (ii) identify appropriate

Performance is assessed every three months. Upon announcement of the cease-fire, this rule was relaxed to 
expedite resource flow to insurgency-affected areas where project activities had been severely affected. 

Nepa l Country Ass is tance Strategy 

Page 33 of 34 

surveys and frequencies to monitor these indicators; (iii) institutionalize IAP reporting; (iv) strengthen the 
link between the fund release mechanism and measurable outcomes; (v) initiate a poverty mapping 
exercise to direct basic social sector infrastructure to the poor and marginalized groups; and (vi) extend 
expenditure tracking and client surveys through participatory monitoring exercises on specific areas and 
sectors. Under the direction of the Vice Chairman of the NPC, the Poverty Monitoring Unit will prepare 
annual poverty reports-the 
country report on progress towards the MDGs-to 
be reviewed by NDC .44 
The Bank is working closely with HMGN to develop this capacity and at the same time, will take 
advantage of these efforts to ensure that all CAS outcomes can be measured and regularly evaluated. 

C. 

Risks 

82. 
The most important risk that Nepal faces today is one of the country spiraling into a widespread 
armed conflict and a breakdown of state institutions. By extension, this is the gravest risk the Bank 
should be concerned with. The current reform process has in fact emerged as an antidote against the risk 
of widespread internal conflict and the breakdown of the development process. Hence, supporting it must 
be at the core of the Bank’s own risk management strategy. Nevertheless, at the next tier of the risk 
structure, it is useful to consider various risks to the reform process itself, so that the Bank is well- 
prepared to support the reform process under different circumstances. The fragile security situation and 
political turmoil present obvious uncertainties. At a deeper level, however, there are two types of 
blockages that may arise: (i) the possibility that the reform process itself is stymied or reversed; and (ii) 
the possibility that capacity to implement the reforms-even 
if commitment is sustained-becomes 
seriously curtailed. 

83. While the major political parties and political leaders have tacitly supported the current reform 
process, the risk of their undermining the reform efforts out of short term political considerations cannot 
be discounted and would be consistent with the politics of Nepal in the past. If the peace process 
advances, there is also a risk that some of the more control-oriented economic policy agenda and 
unrealistic elements of welfare state agenda of the insurgents (e.g., restrictive trade policies, stopping 
privatization of SOEs, ban on private schools, free social services) may influence the reform program. 
When the more technocratic interim Governments make way for an elected Government, there is a risk of 
old-style patronage politics returning and with it tendencies for rent-seeking, slowing of reforms and 
crowding out of the reform-minded senior civil service leaders. 

84. 
The reform leaders are acutely aware of these risks and believe that the best safeguard is the 
broad popular support for the reforms. By giving the people and communities more power and immediate 
benefits, they can expand the political constituency for reforms. This thinking is clearly reflected in the 
2003 IAP which places a strong emphasis on service delivery. In the medium term, as the broader PRS is 
implemented, the Nepali people at large should begin to expect good public service delivery and public 
policies, rather than more personal gains, from the political process. Such a change could eventually 
transform the patronage-based politics of the past into a democracy that focuses on public interests. In 
this regard, the basic strategy of the Bank is to support the reformers to accelerate the reform process. 
Close coordination among the development partners to send consistent messages is a key element of the 
Bank’s strategy. An added risk mitigation measure is the starkly differential lending scenarios-Le., 
the 
difference between the low and the high case is potentially US$250 million per year-that 
continue to 
send a strong message that the Bank’s financial support is linked to continued reform implementation. 

85. 
The second risk is mainly associated with renewed and escalated hostilities that would sharply 
reduce HMGN’s ability to implement the programs envisioned by the PRS. While it would make the 
reform process more difficult in the conflict-affected areas, it may well stiffen the resolve of the reform 

44 

Utilizing available information, the first such report has already been issued. 

Nepal Country Assistance S tra tegy 

Page 3 4 of 34 

leaders to accelerate reform implementation in the rest of the country. In such a situation, continued 
support by the Bank would no doubt give considerable encouragement to HMGN to carry forward the 
reform process. Renewed and severe hostilities would also pose a fiscal challenge. Security spending 
would rise and revenues would suffer fkom further slowing in economic activities. Although the rise in 
security spending would be in part offset by slowing development activities, the net impact on HMGN’s 
fiscal position would likely be significantly negative. HMGN has already positioned itself to cope with 
such a situation in an orderly manner based on its prioritized development program. Aware that this is the 
only way to counter the fiscal problems, the reformers-as 
in the last two years or so--may 
also use the 
fiscal pressure and the need to obtain budget support from the Bank and other development partners as a 
tool to further rationalize spending and accelerate reforms. 

86. 
A political impasse has developed between the major political parties and the interim 
Governments (and by association, the King who appointed them). Although the increasingly belligerent 
attitude of the major political parties has dismayed many Nepalis, there is a risk that this will lead to 
wide-spread civil disorder and distract the administration. In such a situation, even the reform-minded 
technocrats would find it difficult to get cabinet decisions on further reforms and to keep the civil service 
focused on improving public services. The Bank can do little to mitigate such a risk, but it will monitor 
the situation closely. 

87. 
Lastly, an additional risk is that the economic situation will continue to deteriorate and Nepal will 
be even more vulnerable to the external environment. Given Nepal’s dependence on tourism and exports, 
unless there is a recovery in the global and domestic economic situations, Nepal’s medium term prospects 
remain bleak. Again, 
implementing 
the reform agenda-specifically maintaining 
fiscal and 
macroeconomic stability, and increasing economic productivity and competitiveness-provides 
the best 
chances for mitigating this risk. 

88. 
The challenges Nepal faces in taking the reform process forward are formidable. The cost of a 
failure, however, is nothing short of widespread internal conflict, likely resulting in the breakdown of the 
development process. The current reform leaders are very conscious of the risks and the high stakes. In 
essence, implementing reforms with more speed and vigor is their strategy to reduce the risk of reversal, 
and ultimately achieve peace and poverty reduction. Supporting this process is the core of the Bank’s 
own strategy and risk mitigation. This is consistent with the basic strategy that the Bank has followed 
over the last several years-support 
reform actions consistently and forcefully.

Implementing the Previous CAS and Lessons Learned 

A. 

Background 

As indicated, the last CAS for Nepal was discussed by the Board of Directors on December 13, 
1998. Although outcomes to be achieved during the CAS period were not explicitly elaborated, the 
triggers for the base case scenario provide useful insights on the main outcomes the Bank intended to 
influence through the CAS interventions, specifically: 

(i) at the lower end-of 
the base case scenario-stabilization of the situation and no further deterioration 
in economic and administrative management, characterized by: 
Domestic revenues as a share of GDP remaining at or above 11%, domestic borrowing below 
(a) 
2% of GDP, and satisfactory implementation of VAT; and 
Improved management of public expenditures, with no further increase in the number of 
projects in the public investment program, and adequate funding for donor-assisted and other 
priority projects. 

(b) 

(ii) beyond stabilization-Le., within a more solid base case s c e n a r i e w i t h a modest, but clear reform 
effort, as reflected in the following types of steps: 

(d) 

(a) Tangible progress in decentralization and local self-government, with greater local involvement 
in the management of development programs; 
(b) Action on improving central government administrative performance, such as stricter 
enforcement of rotation rules; 
(c) Privatization of three public enterprises, and improvement of the efficiency and transparency of 
privatization procedures and decision-making processes; 
Introduction of a three-year rolling investment program, and full funding of core programs and 
projects; 
(e) Progress in restructuring RBB and preparing its divestiture, completing the privatization of 
NBL, improving banking regulations and improving NRB’s supervisory and regulatory 
capacity; 
Progress in telecommunications reform, including introduction of competition; and 
Introduction of new measures to reduce corruption.

B. 

Achievements during the CAS period 

Background 

For four years-until December 2002-given 
the limited and slow progress in implementing 
reforms, Nepal remained in a low case scenario. Given the fungibility of aid resources, without 
substantial improvements in public expenditure management and public service delivery, more financial 
assistance from IDA would not have been a solution to Nepal’s problems. HMGN clearly began 
recognizing poor governance-reflected most acutely in weak implementation of reforms, poor service 
delivery and corruption-as 
a central obstacle to development (see Box 1). Growing recognition of the 
gravity of the financial sector conditions and the direct link to the system of poor governance- 

Implementing the Previous CAS and Lessons Learned

specifically, the possible risk of a financial sector crisis, the huge drain on public resources and an 
indication of HMGN’s willingness to do away with 
the ‘old way’ of doing business-also 
led the Bank 
to attach special importance to financial sector 
reform. 
As 
the 
first major 
step 
towards 
implementing the financial sector reforms, the 
introduction of external management teams in the 
two large ailing commercial banks became the 
‘litmus test’ for moving into a base case scenario. 
The Bank’s position in this regard was well-known 
and other donors-most notably the IMF and D iD - 
also selected this important reform measure as a key 
milestone for providing additional support to Nepal. 

widely disseminated, including in Nepali. As a result, 
not only did the strategy and the various lending 
scenarios quickly enter the development lexicon, the

Lending. The low case lending program 
focused on community-based projects-to mobilize 
and leverage social capital at the grassroots level- 
and on supporting specific but modest reform efforts. 
Implicitly assuming a quick transition to the base 
case, the Bank continued to prepare a number of 
larger, ‘reform-heavy’ projects and in retrospect may 
have missed an opportunity to develop and deliver a 
few more ‘low case appropriate’ projects. 

. 

benchmarks, it took a while for Government officials 
to understand the implications of this shift with regard 
to the funding of specific sectors. However, gaining 

this understanding has forced some senior officials to 
think more holistically about development. They 

realized that “good performance” in their particular 

sector was not sufficient to warrant Bank support, but 
that such support can only be forthcoming with 

improvements in overall governance; hence, resulting 

in the development of a healthy peer pressure for 
accountability and governance improvements. As it 

has been put “the 1998 CAS eventually shook the 
whole tree to the point that the branches were 

sufficiently threatened.” 

While in the low case scenari+i.e., 
between December 1998 and December 2002-four 
projects were approved for a total of US$94.6 million; specifically: 

The Second Basic and Primary Education Project (BPEP, Cr. 3185-NEP) was approved in 

March 1999 (US$12.5 million). Conceived as an Adaptable Program Loan (APL), the objectives of the 
first phase are to develop institutional capacity for qualitative and quantitative improvements in primary 
education. Through the project, a number of donors-including 
IDA, Denmark, the European Union, 
Finland, Norway, Japan, UNICEF and the ADB-are 
providing joint support to a well-formulated ten- 
year sectoral program; 

The Rural Infrastructure Project (Cr. 3215-NEP) was approved in May 1999 (US$5 million) to 
strengthen the institutional capacity of a decentralized governance system in its planning and managing 
capabilities to improve the quality, efficiency and sustainability of rural roads with active participation of 
project beneficiaries, Given limited Bank experience implementing community-based road projects in 
Nepal, a Learning and Innovation Loan (LIL) was selected as the appropriate vehicle to test this 
fundamental shift in approach. Through this project a number of decentralization options are being 
tested, including working: (i) directly with the DDCs; (ii) with DDCs through contractors; (iii) with 
CBOs; and (iv) through NGOs. The many implementation challenges associated with this project have 
made it a learning experience for all involved. Nevertheless, recent results are promising as confidence 
and experience are being accumulated to work more effectively at grassroots levels; 

The objective of the Road Maintenance and Development Project (Cr. 3293-NEP)-approved 
in November 1999 (US$54.5 million)-is 
to help achieve sustainable maintenance, rehabilitation and 
construction of an economically justifiable strategic road network, while also promoting more sustainable 
funding and efficient public sector management of road maintenance. The project supports key sectoral

policy reforms by establishing a Roads Board and Road Fund to assure a stable source of funding for 
maintenance expenditures, while at the same time providing motorable access to isolated districts in the 
mid- and far-west regions of the country (the heart of the insurgency area); and 

The Telecommunications Sector Reform Project (Cr. 358 1-NEP) was approved in December 
2001 (US$22.6 million) and supports on-going sectoral reforms and increasing rural access to 
telecommunications services through the licensing of a private operator (selected on a competitive basis) 
and establishing public telecommunications centers. 

Following the move to the base case scenario in December 2002, three additional projects have 
been approved for a total of US$96.9 million, specifically: 

The Financial Sector Technical Assistance Project (Cr. 3227-NEP) was approved in December 
2002 (US$16.0 million) and supports the efforts of HMGN to improve the financial sector in order to 
bring macroeconomic stability and promote private sector-led economic growth. The project focuses on 
three major objectives: (i) helping to restructure and re-engineer the Central Bank (Nepal Rastra Bank, 
NRB) so that it can effectively perform its key central banking functions; (ii) initiating commercial 
banlung reform in the two large ailing commercial banks that dominate the sector-Rastriya Banijya 
Bank (RBB) and Nepal Bank Limited (NIL)-by 
introducing stronger bank management that protects 
their financial integrity; and (iii) supporting a better environment for financial sector reforms in areas 
such as enhanced credit information, better financial news reporting, and better training for staff in 
financial institutions; 

The Power Development Project (Cr. 3293-NEP) was approved in May 2003 (US$50.4 million 
IDA Credit and US$25.2 million IDA Grant) to help: (i) develop Nepal’s hydropower potential in an 
environmentally and socially sustainable manner so as to help meet electricity demand; (ii) improve 
access of rural areas to electricity services and (iii) promote private sector participation in the power 
sector as a way to improve sector efficiency and to mobilize financing for the sector’s investment 
requirements. 
In early-FY04, the potential for a parallel Global Environmental Facility (GEF) 
operation-to possibly include contingency financing for pipeline development of small and micro hydro 
projects, and support for institutional development to facilitate private sector delivery of energy efficiency 
services-will be assessed, with a possible operation coming later on; and 

Another LE-the Community School Support Project (Cr. 3808-NEP)-was 
approved in June 
2003 (US$5 million) to support the devolution of the responsibility for management of schools to 
communities. The project provides support for school grants, scholarships, capacity building, and 
monitoring and evaluation. The lessons learned from this project will help IDA (together with HMGN 
and the other education development partners) design further phases of BPEP. 
Analytical and Advisory Activities (AAA). Consistent with the low case scenario, strong 
emphasis was placed on helping to build the agenda and needed consensus for reform. To a large extent, 
the introduction of the Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) and the Immediate Action Plan 
(IAP) have been prompted by the Bank’s dialogue with HMGN. The Public Expenditure Review (PER, 
April 2000) was very influential in this regard. The PER helped to shape the framework for many of the 
public expenditure reforms that are currently under implementation or envisioned. This has been 
followed up with intensive technical assistance and dialogue-in 
collaboration with the UK Department 
for International Development (DfID)-which have helped (and will continue to help) HMGN develop 
and implement the MTEF. As important, the Bank’s continuing dialogue with the authorities on the topic 
of the financial sector reforms-including 
financing the RBB/NBL diagnostic studies and the Nepal: 
Financial Sector Study (October 2002)-have kept the process on track, although admittedly progress has

at times been slow’. Other key pieces have also focused on reform agenda items, including: (i) Priorities 
and Strategies f o r Education Sector Reform (July 2001) which helps to identify and build consensus on a 
comprehensive reform agenda at all levels in this fundamental sector2; (ii) Proposed Power Sector 
Development Strategy (March 200 1) which identifies the key constraints and makes recommendations to 
expand Nepal’s hydropower resource potential to service the electricity needs of the people and to 
generate export potential; (iii) The Business Environment and Manufacturing Performance in Nepal 
(December 2000), the first investment climate survey carried out in the South Asia Region; and (iv) more 
recently, the Nepal: Trade and Competitiveness Study (July 2003), carried out under the Integrated 
Framework (IF). 

Another AAA focus area has been governance, including decentralization and improving service 
delivery. The study Poverty at the Turn of the Twenty-First Century (May 1999) analyzed poverty trends 
and projections, the poverty profile and key elements for a poverty alleviation strategy. Related to service 
delivery, the Terai Options Study (October 2000 ) examined experience with various institutional 
arrangements for delivery of rural services in the Terai and makes recommendations for future 
development of cost-effective service delivery in the context of decentralization. A Country Procurement 
Assessment Report (CPAR) was finalized in FYOl and many of its recommendations are being 
implemented. A Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA)--carried out with an extremely 
committed HMGN partner and other donors-was 
completed in FY02, also with an agreed action plan 
currently under implementation3, In the area of decentralization, three areas-the 
proposed Poverty 
Alleviation Fund (PAF), fiscal decentralization, and local institutions in the delivery of services in rural 
areas-have 
been selected as focal areas for the coming years. The PAF policy note Towards a 
Sustainable Approach f o r Poverty Reduction and Decentralization in Nepal was finalized in November 
2002. 

The majority of the formal reports have been-and 
continue to be-followed 
up by policy 
dialogues, consensus building, and technical assistance, which have resulted in a remarkably high level of 
achievement on many of the original CAS outcomes, especially in the areas of public expenditure 
management, decentralization, financial sector reform, telecommunications, and education reform. 

Among the informal studies, the Bank facilitated and OECDDAC led a Review of Development 
Partnerships. The review-a 
highly consultative exercise+overed 
the whole gamut of donor-recipient 
relationships that have impacted development partnerships in Nepal. The findings complemented 
HMGN’s own formulation of a Foreign Aid Policy (FAP) that was endorsed by the development partners 
during the 2002 Nepal Development Forum. 

Outcomes 

Over the last few years, the South Asia Region has emphasized a results-focused work 
programming. The Nepal Country Team has been in the forefront of these efforts, and has set the

DfID and the IMF have been important partners in these efforts. In addition, IMF has been providing 
technical assistance to the central bank. 

The intense sectoral dialogue that followed this work and has continued through the implementation of 
BPEP has in large part been responsible for triggering the current efforts to transfer school management to 
community-based groups. 

Financing was obtained under two different Institutional Development Fund (IDF) Grants to assist in the 
efforts to implement certain recommendations/action plans of the CPAR (related to public procurement 
reform) and CFAA (related to public audit reform). 

Implementing the Previous CAS and Lessons Learned 

Appendix 11

standard for the countries in the region. Over the last two years, the team has adopted a ‘portfolio 
approach’ to outcomes, in which the entire team-not 
an individual-is held accountable for achieving a 
high proportion of outcomes that have been selected using specific criteria. The approach employed- 
discussed be low -en su re s that risluer, but high importance outcomes will also be attempted. The 
structure used over the last two years is as follows: 

0 Each ‘outcome’ is a significant change that would be highly desirable and possible within the 
four-year CAS horizon. For the immediate year ahead, a specific ‘milestone’-i.e., key step 
toward achieving the three-year outcome-is defined; 

0 Such a milestone is expected to have less than 100% probability of happening-for practical 
purposes probabilities of 20, 40, 60 and 80% are assigned-even with best efforts on the part of 
the Bank; 

0 The set of outcomes is seen as a ‘portfolio’ in its entirety-i.e., 
consisting of some high- 
probability, but relatively low-impact outcomes, and some low-probability, but high-impact 
outcomes. To avoid extremes, the set of outcomes is normally constructed with an expected 
overall annual success rate of around 65 - 70%4. 

0 

The matrix and annual milestones are updated each year, with some outcomes replaced- 
either through achievement or a change in strategic priorities-and new milestones defined; 

0 

Rather than holding staff accountable for achievement of specific outcomes, the Country 
Team is collectively held accountable for the overall outcome of the portfolio5; and 

0 

The same approach is applied to a set of annual milestones as well, so that annual 
performance can be monitored against some expected overall achievement rate. 

Near the end of each FY, the country team evaluates the achievement of the milestones during the 
year. Reflecting on the lessons learned and the experience in general, the team then updates the outcomes 
matrix and annual milestones for the following FY. Such a process has led to a situation in which there is 
real team ownership and awareness of the milestones and outcomes. This has also resulted in a more 
holistic approach to the Bank’s efforts in Nepal, in which sectors and instruments are initially ‘ignored’ as 
the team focuses wholly on outcomes, with the discussion on instruments to achieve those outcomes 
becoming secondary. 

The results of the review exercise for FY03 are presented in Table 1. Of the 15 milestones 
established for FY03, 11 were substantially achieved, resulting in an overall ‘success rate’ of slightly 
higher than 70%, as compared to the original expectation of 60%. It is interesting to note that a number 
of milestones assessed as having a relatively high probability (Le., 80%) of being achieved in the 
beginning of the FY-such 
as developing the design of the decentralization fiscal fkamework, and 
launching a joint review of the experience of community-based rural development programs-were not 
achieved. However, a number of milestones assessed as having a relatively low probability (Le., 20 or 

4 

5 

This does not imply that for outcomes that are not fully achieved, there will be no progress. In many cases, 
it is likely that some progress toward the ultimate outcome will have been made. 

Unless an entirely unforeseen event changes the country setting profoundly, a significant shortfall in 
r e a c h g the expected rate of achievement would mean either: (i) the initial assessment or strategy was 
unrealistic; or (ii) the Bank’s efforts were inadequate.

40%) of being achieved in the beginning of the FY-such 
as piloting the transfer of management of 
primary schools to communities, and establishing a realistic resource ceiling for development 
expenditures-were achieved. 

Many of the outcomes adopted by the country team for the FY03-FY05 period are closely linked 
to the outcomes implicit in the 1998 CAS. These links, as well as an assessment of the CAS outcomes 
and the instruments employed to achieve these outcomes, are provided in Table 2 .

Lessons Learned 

Today, there is a realization within Nepal that the Bank is truly concerned with the well-being of 
the poor and that it is not possible to simply ‘negotiate’ aid out of IDA. However, this realization was not 
necessarily quick or easy in coming, and along the way, a number of important lessons have been 
learned-both 
fi-om our experiences in Nepal and world-wide, including through initiatives such as The 
Global Poll (May 2003). While many of these lessons have been alluded to above, they can be 
summarized as follows: 

0 

In an environment of poor governance, closely linking lending levels to progress in implementing 
reforms and achieving results on the ground-not 
just p rom i se s -can be tremendously effective in a 
country such as Nepal. In doing so, it is important to send a firm and consistent message-and most 
importantly, stick with it-that 
unless the important issues are seriously tackled-improving governance 
and service delivery-additional 
funding will not be forthcoming (at least fi-om the World Bank). While 
such an approach by itself would not prompt reforms, when spontaneous reform initiatives emerge, it can 
provide an important and constructive discipline to the process and can even strengthen the hands of the 
reform leaders. Such a stance can foster peer pressure among senior officials to look at development 
more holistically, as they realize that sectoral funds are held hostage to improvements in larger country 
goals (i.e., governance); 

0 

A work program grounded in an outcomes approach-in which all team members share 
responsibility for achievement of a portfolio of outcomes-acourages a more holistic and multi-sectoral 
approach. Outcomes should be realistic, focused on those areas where the Bank plays a significant role, 
and clearly linked to stated country objectives (such as PRS objectives or MDGs). In addition, it is 
important to be able to measure milestoneshntermediate indicators and periodically monitor and evaluate 
whether these milestones are being achieved; 

0 

The introduction of a number of important reforms-such 
as the MTEF, the financial sector 
reforms, the IAF’, and the transfer of primary schools to community management-have 
resulted from a 
long Bank association and consistent dialogue with HMGN. To be most effective, it is essential to invest 
in a solid relationship built on a strong dialogue with key counterparts. In addition to building consensus 
for changeheform, such an investment also builds and encourages ownership of and buy in for the reform 
programs, while proactive outreach contributes to a wider understanding of development challenges and 
opportunities; 

0 

Implicitly assuming a quick transition to the base case, the Bank continued to prepare a number 
of larger, ‘reform-heavy’ projects during the CAS period. In retrospect, opportunities were likely missed 
to develop and deliver a few more ‘low case appropriate’ projects-typically modest in size, and often 
supporting community-based projects or small, sector specific reform efforts (e.g., telecommunications 
sector); 

0 

The interplay of diverse political economy realities has an important impact on reform 
implementation and hence, needs to be understood better for the Bank to be more opportunistic in its 

Imp lemen t ing the Previous CAS and Lessons Learned 

Append ix 11 
Page 7 of 9 

support. When reforms do happen, they often appear to be spontaneous and episodic, and tend to fall 
outside the conventional frameworks that donors prefer to work in. Finally, Government officials are not 
necessarily good at showcasing reform progress, nor are they practiced at communicating successes to the 
public at large. These are important aspects to stress if the benefits of reforms are to be the best arbiter 
for deeper reforms in the future; 

The linkages between peace and stability, and reducing poverty are strong-i.e., 
a potential 
vicious circle. Developmentlpoverty reduction can not delayedpostponed until there is peace and 
stability, as the root causes of conflict-Le., 
failure of governance, including lack of delivery of public 
services, and horizontal inequality and social exclusion-are 
often the major challenges of reducing 
poverty; and 

0 

Donor coordination is important, but is not always easy as donors often send different and mixed 
messages to the Government--e.g., the Nepali reform efforts of the late-1990s/early-200Os warrant low 
case lending levels vs. these reform efforts warrant base case lending levels. Ultimately, the Government 
must be encouraged to coordinate donor assistance by setting out its own development strategies and 
priorities. Clearly, donors-including 
the Bank-need 
to respect Government efforts to ‘regulate’ foreign 
assistance through vehicles such as a Foreign Aid Policy (FAP). Such an effort, along with a firm 
foundation for donor assistance-such as that contained in a Poverty Reduction Strategy-will 
encourage 
more holistic and coordinated development.

The 2003 Immediate Action Plan 
The development of the 2003 Immediate Action Plan (IAP) marks the second year of HMGN’s 
continuing efforts to bolster the country’s track record for implementing reforms. In June 2002, the 
Council of Ministers adopted the first Immediate Action Plan (IAP) to establish a track record for 
implementing what it promises. The 2002 IAP focused on expediting reforms in three areas-prioritizing 
public expenditures, improving service delivery and fighting corruption, as well as improving 
accountability. The successful implementation of the first IAP established a common understanding on 
the essential need to carry out all the actions included in the IAP. Moreover, their implementation has 
helped to establish credibility for HMGN for undertaking reforms. Building on the success of the 2002 
IAP, HMGN has subsequently decided to formulate an annual IAP to bridge capacity gaps and expedite 
key reforms. 
The 2003 IAP contains a set of measures that are critical for the successful implementation of the 
Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS). This second IAP consists of 24 reform actions-an increase from the 
set of 19 contained in the 2002 version. Not only are the measures directly linked to the four PRS pillars, 
most programs are tied to the Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF). The Cabinet approved the 
IAP in July 2003 and implementation of most actions is expected to begin by September 2003. In 
addition to the three areas covered under the 2002 IAP, the current IAP includes reforms in agriculture, 
private sector development, rationalization of SOEs, infrastructure development, targeted programs, 
decentralization, as well as measures to address human rights. The Reform and Development Group-a 
joint government-donor task force responsible for developing the IAP- 
identified lead Ministries and 
donor agencies (‘Lead Agencies’) responsible for carrying out detailed assessments of the respective 
actions. 

The assessments include an explanation of the impact or importance of the actions, monitoring 
indicators, specific outcomes, preliminary cost estimates, timeframe for implementation and the key 
implementing agencies on both HMGN and donor sides. The 2003 IAP actions and assessments are 
presented in the following matrix.

IMF Concludes 2003 Article IV Consultation with Nepal 
On August 22,2003, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the Article IV 
consultation with Nepal.2 

Background 

Nepal remains among the poorest countries in the world with almost 40 percent of the population living in 
poverty due to insufficient growth and inadequate targeting of the poor. During the 1990s, macroeconomic 
conditions remained broadly stable and the fiscal position was manageable, but growth was constrained by 
financial sector weahe s se s , weak public sector management, and poor governance. In the financial sector, 
Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) oversight is still weak, and intermediation is inadequate largely due to a banking 
environment in which loan default is endemic, especially by well-connected borrowers. Partly as a result of 
this, the two largest commercial banks now have large nonperforming assets. Similar problems exist at two 
large development banks. In the public sector, investment has been spread. thinly over projects and enterprises 
suffer from weak management and accountability. More recently, intensified security problems and adverse 
external developments contributed to lower growth and the fiscal position has deteriorated since 2000/01. 

The ceasefire agreed in January 2003 with the insurgents has renewed hopes for peace and efforts have been 
made to sustain the reform momentum. Progress in achieving lasting peace would facilitate poverty reduction 
and implementation of policies contained in the government's Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP). 
However, political uncertainties persist as major political parties continue to maintain that the appointment of 
governments by the King since the dissolution of parliament is unconstitutional. The parties have also refused 
to join the peace talks.

Note: This Appendix is as of July 25, 2003 and as such, the indicators deviate from the more updated indicators 
provided elsewhere in the document. 

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually 
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with 
officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a 
report, w h c h fonns the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the 
Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary 
is transmitted to the country's authorities. 

Append ix IV 
Page 2 of 5 

GDP growth is estimated to be 2 percent in 2002/03. The ceasefire has helped restore some normality in the 
transport and service sectors and the decline in tourism may have halted. There are also signs that some 
exports and manufacturing production are rebounding. Inflation, which rose to about 7% percent in mid-May 
(1 2-month basis) reflecting price developments in India, administrative price changes, and supply factors, is 
expected to moderate by early 2003/04. 

The 2002/03 budget met revised targets set in a mid-term review. Based on weak revenue performance due to 
lower activity during the first half of the year and external aid shortfalls relative to the initial budget targets, 
the authorities revised the budget at mid-year. Specifically, the tax revenue target and external financing were 
revised down. To compensate for these shortfalls, total expenditure was also revised down and the revised 
budget set a net domestic financing target of 2 percent of GDP. Following the announcement of the ceasefire, 
economic activity picked up and revenue performance improved. However, capital spending was below the 
revised budget, reflecting continued implementation constraints at the local level. As a result, domestic 
financing was around 1% percent of GDP. 

Monetary policy has been accommodative and the real effective exchange rate has depreciated. To help 
economic recovery, the NRB lowered cash reserve requirements by 1 percentage point in August 2002 and 
maintained a refinancing facility for lending to “sick” industries. Aided by the recovery in activity and 
monetary easing, private credit appears to have revived and higher remittances contributed to a rise in banking 
system foreign assets. However, reserve money growth has been curtailed, due largely to lower net credit to 
the government. Lending and deposit rates have declined somewhat. The Nepalese rupee has depreciated in 
real effective terms since early 2002, reflecting the peg to the Indian currency which has appreciated only 
somewhat against the weakening US dollar. 

Balance of payments developments turned favorable in mid-2002/03 and external reserves are adequate. Large 
and increasing remittances helped buoy the current account. Garment exports began recovering in late 2002, 
while recorded exports to India declined, carpets and pashmina exports continued to stagnate, and imports 
increased with the recovery. The current account (excluding official transfers) is expected to move into a 
deficit of about K percent of GDP, but with higher aid and other inflows official foreign exchange reserves are 
expected to rise to US$1 billion (6% months of imports of goods and services). 

In 2002/03, significant progress was made in financial sector reform implementation. The NRB took steps to 
reduce staffing through a voluntary retirement scheme (VRS). Progress was made in restructuring the two 
largest commercial banks, which had external management teams installed. The teams have prepared 
management plans, made progress in assessing the banks’ financial status, and proposed VRSs to reduce 
overstaffing. Some improvements have already taken place with success in loan recovery and branch 
rationalization, although loan recovery from well-connected borrowers continues to be difficult. Prioritization 
of budgetary spending improved, anti-corruption efforts were boosted, and public enterprise reform 
implementation and governance reforms progressed. To improve prioritization, a Medium Term Expenditure 
Framework was introduced with World Bank assistance to help align development spending with national and 
sectoral priorities. Administered price increases for petroleum products were announced in March 2003, 
although some price increases were rolled back under public pressure. Liquidation procedures were initiated 
for four public enterprises; preparations for the privatization of one enterprise were brought to an advanced 
stage. 

Governance reforms progressed and anti-corruption efforts were boosted. The cabinet approved in September 
2002 the elimination of 7,500 vacant civil service positions. To tackle corruption in public life, the 

Appendix IV

Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority and a newly established Judicial Commission initiated 
investigations against politicians and revenue officials perceived to have accumulated unaccountable assets. 
The Anti-Corruption Strategy was adopted. 

Executive Board Assessment 

Executive Directors stressed that to address the pervasive level of poverty in Nepal, growth needs to be raised 
significantly over the medium term through vigorous implementation of structural reforms, particularly in the 
financial and public sectors. In this regard, Directors welcomed the authorities’ Poverty Reduction Strategy 
Paper (PRSP), which is founded on broad-based growth, social sector development, targeted programs for the 
poor and deprived groups, and improved governance. Directors looked forward to considering a Joint Staff 
Assessment of the PRSP in the near future. They encouraged the authorities to reach early agreement on a 
program that could be supported by the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility to help achieve PRSP goals. 

Directors welcomed the ceasefire agreement with the insurgents reached in January 2003. They underlined 
that continued peace was essential to help sustain the economic recovery currently under way. Directors also 
noted that progress in the peace talks and the build up of confidence should help relieve budgetary pressures 
for security spending. 

Directors commended the authorities’ for maintaining broad fiscal stability to create conditions to support 
economic growth. Looking forward, Directors endorsed the authorities’ fiscal strategy based on revenue 
mobilization, expenditure prioritization, and a reduction in domestic borrowing. They welcomed the 2003/04 
budget as the first step in implementing this strategy. However, Directors called for a determined effort to 
meet the revenue targets and to resist spending pressures. To raise revenue over the medium term, Directors 
suggested cuts in exemptions, improvements in tax and customs administration, and increases in the VAT rate. 
Directors welcomed the steps taken to prioritize development spending to help achieve poverty reduction 
goals, including the introduction of a medium-term expenditure framework, and encouraged the extension of 
such efforts to all expenditures. Directors noted that the envisaged reductions in domestic borrowing would 
help maintain fiscal sustainability over the medium term, especially in view of potentially large contingent 
liabilities from financial sector and public enterprise reforms. Continued technical assistance in the fiscal area 
will help address capacity constraints. 

Directors agreed that monetary and exchange rate policies should remain geared to supporting the exchange 
rate peg to the Indian rupee, stressing that the peg had served Nepal well given its close links with India. 
Looking forward, they noted that prospective external developments, such as the phasing out of the Multi- 
Fiber Agreement, would likely have implications for external competitiveness and the appropriate choice and 
level of the peg. Directors pointed to the need for policy measures to ensure that remittances are sustained, as 
well as for efforts to diversify Nepal’s export base. They also noted that external competitiveness could be 
enhanced by measures to raise labor productivity and lower transport costs. 

Directors commended the authorities for progress in financial sector reforms, but noted that much remained to 
be done. They stressed the need for strengthening Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) supervision of the financial 
sector. The NRJ3 should also improve performance incentives for skilled personnel, while encouraging 
separations at lower levels. Directors welcomed the appointment of external managers at the two largest 
insolvent commercial banks, and noted recent steps taken by the new managers to improve the financial 
condition of the banks. To help support these efforts and, more generally, to create a sound banking 
environment, Directors noted the authorities’ intention to phase out priority sector lending requirements, and 

Appendix IV 

Page 4 of 5 

emphasized the effective implementation of recently adopted debt recovery mechanisms, including the Debt 
Recovery Tribunal and blacklisting of loan defaulters. 

Directors welcomed ongoing public sector reforms, including the elimination of vacant positions, the 
introduction of merit-based promotions, the decompression of the wage scale, as well as improvements in the 
public procurement process. Looking forward, Directors recommended the adoption of civil service 
accountability in order to improve policy implementation. They welcomed the public enterprise reform efforts 
that would lower government ownership in the economy and increase the enterprises’ net budgetary 
contribution-through privatization and restructuring of viable enterprises and liquidation of unviable ones. 
Several Directors stressed that due regard should be paid to the pace and sequencing of these reforms. Also, an 
appropriate compensation scheme could help smooth implementation of workforce reductions. 

Directors welcomed recent efforts to combat corruption, but emphasized the need to pursue forcefully those 
responsible for the misuse of public funds. Directors supported the authorities’ plans to increase 
decentralization to enhance service delivery. However, they noted that the implementation of these measures 
should be accompanied by improved public sector governance and capacity building at the local level. 

Directors supported measures to improve the business climate for private sector development through legal 
reforms and streamlining of administrative procedures to facilitate trade. They recommended revisions to labor 
legislation to make labor hiring more flexible and modifications to the Company and Insolvency Acts to allow 
more orderly and timely exit of unviable firms. 

Directors commended Nepal for its open trade regime, and welcomed the authorities’ efforts to gain early 
World Trade Organization (WTO) accession. Directors welcomed the elimination of the exchange restriction 
arising from quantitative limits on payments for personal travel. Directors encouraged the authorities to further 
improve statistics to enhance policy formulation and monitoring. They urged full implementation of Fund 
technical assistance recommendations. 

Public Information Notices (PINS) are issued (i) at the request of a member country, following the conclusion of 
the Article IV consultation for countries seelung to make known the views of the IMF to the public. This action is

The Main Findings of Two Key Fiduciary Assessments: 
The Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) 
and the Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR) 

A. 

The Country Financial Accountability Assessment’ 

Context 

Nepal’s legal and regulatory framework for ensuring public sector financial accountability is 
impressive for a country at its level of economic development. The 1990 Constitution requires the 
Ministry of Finance to submit a detailed comparison of the financial results and budgets of all ministries 
to Parliament at the end of each fiscal year. The Constitution also accords the Auditor General (AG) 
complete legal and professional independence, exempting his emoluments and the budget of the Office of 
the Auditor General (OAG) from parliamentary vote. The Constitution also created a Commission for the 
Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) to investigate and recommend actions against errant and 
corrupt officials and prosecute them, if necessary. 

Furthermore, when the Public Accounts Committee (PAC)-headed 
by a member of the main 
opposition party in Parliament-was 
in session, it was proactive in its undertahngs. It is schedule to 
meet year round discussing public accounts and the AG’s annual report and recommendations, as well as 
all aspects of public sector financial management. All meetings are open to, and receive full coverage in, 
the press, and it intervenes in on-going procurement processes when impropriety is suspected. Its 
collaboration with the AG is exemplary. It sends the AG’s recommendations to the HMGN with a 
directive for the implementation of such recommendations. 

The 1999 Financial Procedures Act and 1999 Financial Administration Regulations (FAR) 
contain detailed and comprehensive provisions for: (i) budget preparation and approval; (ii) accounting 
and reporting on budget implementation every four months; (iii) a detailed report (Schedule 2 of the 
FAR) that includes a statement, not only of expenditures, but also of physical results and goals achieved; 
(iv) elaborate procurement and internal control procedures; (v) annual financial statements at all levels, 
with a consolidated financial statement for the whole public sector at the end of each fiscal year; (vi) 
internal and external audits; (vii) ministerial review of project implementation at regular intervals 
throughout the year, with rewards for good performers and explanations for poor performance. 

The 1999 Local Self-Governance Act (LSGA) presents the structure of local government. The 
roles, responsibilities and relationships of District Development Committees (DDCs), Municipalities, and 
Village Development Committees (VDCs), and the Councils which govern them are explained in the 
LSGA. The regulations for financial accountability at the local level are even more impressive than those 
at the center. They contain provisions and instructions for: (i) budget preparation; (ii) proper accounting

The CFAA was jo in t ly carried ou t by HMGN and the Bank beginning in December 2001, with the 
establishment of a high level National Steering Committee (NSC). The NSC played a pivotal and strong 
leadership role which demonstrated the high level of HMGN ownership, and also was extremely useful in 
guaranteeing a high quality product. Throughout the process, a number of stakeholders meetings were 
held, including with representatives of donors, government agencies, oversight agencies and private sector 
agencies. Following a stakeholder’s workshop in which over 200 people participated, formal discussions 
of the final CFAA report were carried out in June 2002. Subsequently, HMGN adopted the Development 
Action Plan of the CFAA. 

CFAA/CPA R

and reporting; (iii) creation of an Accounts Committee in every local body to oversee financial 
management; (iv) internal and external audits; (v) project monitoring; and (vi) an elaborate system for 
“ex-post” evaluation of projects which assesses, not only the direct costs and benefits of each project, but 
also the impact on employment creation and on the environment. 

Key Findings 

The following are the CFAA’s key findings. 

While the legal framework appears comprehensive, Nepal has been less successful with 
compliance and implementation of the regulations, but commitment to upgrade the public sector’s 
financial management is strong. Compliance with the provisions of the FAR either has not been accorded 
the priority implied by the regulations. Schedule 2 of the FAR which requires reporting on physical and 
goal achievements is inadequately monitored. With adequate monitoring, the linkages between financial 
progress and physical outputs/outcomes could be measured in ways that would fully meet the Bank’s 
financial management requirements for Bank-financed projects. The imposition of penalties and fines 
prescribed by the FAR for non-compliance with reporting or other requirements is not strictly enforced. 
Until recently, 95% of the legal cases brought by the CIAA against errant officials have been 
unsuccessful but the success rate is reported to have improved to as much as 50%. 

At the local level, monitoring has been weak with the lack of adherence to M&E by most 
institutions as required by the LSGA. While accounting staff possess minimum technical qualifications 
required for the job, they have little or no experience in project accounting and financial management. 
Technical staff are known to give low priority to resource allocation and to establishing good financial 
management systems in their respective agencies/projects. Compliance with internal controls and internal 
audits have to be strengthened. While the proactive involvement of the PAC during project 
implementation process has helped to check any malpractices or misdeeds, it can at times cause delays in 
decision-malung with negative implications for development. 

Several explanations have been given for the dichotomy between precept and practice: (i) 
insufficient political commitment or demand for compliance with financial accountability rules and 
regulations; (ii) reluctance to punish or impose sanctions on anyone; (iii) reported corruption in civil 
service appointments, promotions and transfers; (iv) politicization of the civil service and its decision- 
making processes; and (v) some donors and foreign development partners bypassing the requirement for 
establishing financial systems and requirements for the projects they support, thereby contributing to the 
lack of compliance with the country’s laws and regulations. 

Ultimately, the problem with compliance can be attributed to two basic factors. First, Nepal is 
still in the process of fully developing a solid financial management framework for implementing the 
laws and regulations on public accountability. For example, tying expenditures to outputs and outcomes 
requires a budgetary system that specifies outputs or results expected from expenditures as well as funds; 
accounting and reporting systems that recordreport quantitative and qualitative achievements in addition 
to financial data/financial statements; and an auditing system which enables an independent auditor to 
trace expenditures and their results. Second, political instability including frequent government changes 
and more urgent priorities have diminished the attention on financial management needs. 

The present challenge for Nepal is supporting institutional changes to shift away from inadequate 
compliance to earnest and consistent implementation of the country’s existing impressive legal and 
regulatory framework. 
The CFAA’s Development Action Plan (DAP) contains a host of 
recommendations towards improving financial accountability of the public sector and a summary is 
provided below. 

CFAAEPAR 

Budgeting and Accounting 

Appendix V 
Page 3 o f 7 

Transparent criteria must be developed for selecting officials to handle state funds, whether in the 
form of revenue or as spending budget. A key requirement would be the ability of the individual to 
properly account for the funds as stipulated by existing regulations, including reports on physical results 
or measurable goals achieved from previous expenditures and to be achieved from the proposed 
prograddevelopment expenditure. 

No budget should be accepted or approved for any public office, whether at the village, 
municipal, district, department or ministry level, nor should Parliament approve the national budget 
unless the relevant budget contains: (i) a retrospective account of physical or other measurable 
achievements or goals resulting from previous expenditures; and (ii) a prospective forecast of the physical 
results or other measurable goals expected from proposed expenditures. A suitable simplified framework 
should be developed that can be realistically implemented at the local (village, municipal and district) 
level. 

Each disbursement to any office (whether at local or at central level) should be made against a 
report from that office showing: (i) expenditures for the immediately preceding period and their physical 
or other measurable achievements; and (ii) the proposed expenditures and their anticipated physical or 
other measurable achievements. 

Independent Auditing and Parliamentary Oversight 

The following measures would go a long way to improving the chances that the recommendations 
of the OAG and the PAC are implemented. 

The Monitoring Section of the National Planning Commission (NPC) should be strengthened to 
ensure full ownership by NPC for instituting a realistic system of monitoring all development 
projects, in addition to the core projects, in close collaboration with concerned line ministries, and to 
report their progress three times a year. 
The Financial Comptroller General Office (FCGO) and the internal audit services at central and local 
levels ought to be strengthened to be able to: (i) certify offices qualified to receive and properly 
account for funds; (ii) monitor compliance with the new regulations (that is, the above 
recommendations) all through the year; and (iii) take proactive actions to rectify any violations of 
rules and regulations before they are raised by external auditors. 
The OAG should improve its capacity to confirm annually whether or not the new rules are being 
complied with and to provide services in financial auditing and outcomes-based performance 
auditing. 
Capacities of the line ministries have to be built to effectively monitor their programs and prepare 
time-bound action plans to rectify issues or implement recommendations in the OAG's report. MOF 
must monitor the implementation of the action plans of all ministries. 
MOF should establish an effective monitoring system to follow up on reported irregularities and 
periodically report on the actions taken. Such monitoring should include the status of the following: 
(i) audit backlogs and action plan to keep all audits up-to-date; (ii) revenue realization; (iii) clearing 
reimbursable grants and loans; (iv) tax deduction at source; (v) repayment of principal and interest 
made by HMGN on guaranteed loans but not recovered from concerned institutions; (vi) dividends 
receivable, and other receivables, from corporate bodies and boards; (vii) amounts to be paid by 
HMGN to various entities; and (viii) follow-up on the recommendations of the PAC. 

CFAA /CPA R 

Append ix V 
P a g e 4 of 7 

The PAC must be given an unambiguous and enforceable mandate to insist on political demand for 
accountability and transparency and compliance with the new regulations. 

Fiduciary Risk and Programmatic Lending 

For fiduciary risk on programmatic lending to approximate the fiduciary risk now accepted for 
project lending, accountability and internal control standards in the whole civil service must approximate 
those currently existing in Bank-financed projects. The existing legalh-egulatory fiamework meets these 
standards but compliance must be enhanced. The objective for HMGN should be to harmonize the 
reporting system that is acceptable to all donors. There is no reason to not consider some budgetary 
support/programmatic lending, but it should be accompanied by: (i) a pragmatic program of targeted 
assessment and strengthening of sectors and institutions scheduled to benefit from such lending; and (ii) 
implementation of the recommendations made in the DAP for the public sector over the medium term. 

Sectors, ministries and institutions envisaged for budgetary support should be the first to be 
assessed and certified by a panel of independent experts representing the accountability institutions which 
include MOF, FCGO, NPC and OAG (or may also include experts designated by donor partners 
participating in budgetary support) as complying with the accountability standards recommended above. 

Following the full implementation of the proposed integrated financial management improvement 
program, a quick review would be desirable to confirm the effectiveness of the compliance system, before 
generalized programmatic lending benefiting all sectors, ministries, and institutions is launched. All 
levels of government would need to be reviewed for adequate compliance before moving forward. 

A Task Force or a Reform Monitoring Committee should continue to monitor the implementation 
of the recommendations of the CFAA. Implementation status should be periodically reported to the 
Finance Committee of the Parliament, the Finance Secretary, and Nepal’s development partners. 

Capacity Building and Implementation of CFAA Recommendations 

Implementation of the CFAA recommendations in the form of the DAP by the entire public 
sector has been underway since mid-2002. A progress report of the Plan is regularly updated and posted 
on the MOF’s external website. In addition, the Government requested the Bank’s assistance in two 
areas: capacity building of the accounting and auditing staff and upgrading the quality of audits. 
Specifically, the request entailed enhancing the capacity of the OAG towards improving public sector 
financial accountability. In March 2003, the Bank provided an Institutional Development Fund (IDF) 
grant of US$0.5 million. On the basis of the CFAA recommendations and agreement reached with the 
OAG, the grant will finance: (i) the revision of the audit guidelines and reporting methodology to be 
compatible with international standards or best practice; and (ii) the establishment of institutionalized 
training arrangements within OAG to implement the guidelines.

The Country Procurement Assessment Report’ 

Context 

Appendix V 
Page 5 o f 7 

Like most countries, Nepal’s constitution does not address the issue of public procurement, but in 
contrast to most countries, there is no law (in the sense of a generally applicable set of rules enacted by 
the legislature) about public procurement. In this respect, Nepal (like its neighboring countries Pakistan 
and India, and a few others) is different from most other countries in the world. Most countries have 
introduced a public procurement law, enacted by parliament which alone can change it, which law deals 
exclusively with the public procurement of goods, works and services by governmental entities at all 
levels, and most often both for the central authorities as well as those on a provincial and communal level. 

The system used in Nepal is represented by the Financial Administration (Related) Rules of 
1999” (FAR99) was originally introduced by the British but is no longer practiced in the U.K. This 
approach consists of the issuance by government (rather than by the legislature) of a set of financial rules 
which essentially describe the financial powers of various governmental authorities, and in particular the 
procedures they should follow in securing and disbursing the public funds required to discharge their 
functions, including the rules governing the procurement of public contracts. Having been issued by 
government, these rules-i.e., FAR99--can also be changed by government, without any approval by the 
legislature, which it is felt in most countries is not in the public interest. Rules of this nature, which 
govern the use of huge amounts of public funds, should be difficult rather than easy to change, and they 
should be changed only in a public and transparent manner. 

Key Findings 

Procedures and Practices 

FAR99 represents an improvement over its predecessor but the enactment of a Public 
Procurement Law is a necessity. The Bank revised the rules for National Competitive Bidding (NCB) 
under Bank-financed contracts, in order to properly reflect the interests of the public purchaser. In fact, 
the list (noted below) indicates the areas of the public procurement system requiring attention. 

Provision of sufficient time for bid preparation. 
Bidders access to bidding documents by mail or in person. 
Evaluation of bids according to pre-disclosed criteria. 
Bid opening in only one place and immediately after deadline for bid submission. 
No preference to local bidders competing with foreign bidders. 
Contract awarded to lowest evaluated bidder. 
No post-bidding negotiations with the lowest or any other bidder. 
No bid rejection on the basis merely of price estimates. 
No rebidding without IDA’S prior concurrence. 
Requirement for all bidders to provide bid and performance securities.

The CPAR was carried out as jointly between the Bank and HMGN. The work was initiated in November 
1999 and finalized in April 2002.

Issues Related t o Expertise, Audit, Anti-corruption 

In addition to the problems related to the legal and procedural framework in which procurement 
is conducted in Nepal, there are other problems mentioned below: 

0 

0 Like in almost all borrowing countries of the Bank, there is a tremendous need to train public officials 
in the principles and practices of public procurement. 
The Auditor General’s staff has been found, in the case of donor-financed contracts, to insist upon the 
application of local procurement rules instead of the donor’s procurement rules (although the 
applicable Nepalese rules make it clear that the latter should apply). 
Nepalese laws and rules dealing with corruption seem to penalize only passive corruption ( i -e , , the 
soliciting o r accepting of bribes by public officials), but not acts (just as dangerous) of active 
corruption (Le., the offering or giving of bribes to public officials by private parties). 
There is a perception amongst the bidders and business community that corruption is a problem in 
public procurement in Nepal.

Summary of Major Recommendations 

The 2002 CPAR contains the following principal recommendations: 

0 

0 Enacting a modem, transparent and competitive public procurement law, based on the UNCITRAL 
Model Law for Procurement, to apply to public procurement by all public entities in Nepal at all 
levels, as well as to parastatals. 
Creating a small, independent procurement agency, with functions defined by the Public Procurement 
Law (essentially policy, and not oversight or line clearances of procurement decisions). 
Pending the enactment of such a Public Procurement Law, amend FAR’99 in the sense of changing 
the anti-competitive rules and practices listed in this Executive Summary. 
Review and develop as needed standard bidding documents to be used for procurement financed by 
HM own government. 
Develop and accelerate procurement training at all levels of government, including the Auditor 
General’s staff. 

0 

0 

0 

Ins truc t ing the Auditor General’s staff, in the case of donor-financed procurement, to insist on the 
app l ica t ion of the donor’s procurement rules and not of local procurement rules. 
Am end ing the anti-corruption legislation in such a way as to (i) impose harsh penalties (including 
blacklisting) on the acts of active fraud and corruption, particularly the offering/giving of bribes to 
public off ic ia ls , and (ii) specifically allowing/inviting bidders to report acts of corruption by other 
bidders, as well as solicitation of bribes by public officials. 

Capacity Bu i ld ing and Implementation of CPAR Recommendations 

Th e Government is strongly committed to implementing the CPAR recommendations. The 
Government revised provisions of the FAR99 soon after the publication of the CPAR. They include 
ensuring sufficient time for bid preparation, evaluation of bids according to pre-disclosed criteria, 
awarding of bids and prohibiting post-bidding negotiations with bidders. 

The Bank is currently providing technical assistance through a three-year IDF grant of about 
US$0.3 million to implement three areas of the above-mentioned CPAR recommendations. The grant- 
launched in March 2003-will 
finance: (i) the development of a draft modem transparent and competitive 
Public Procurement Law in line with international standards and related rules and procedures; (ii) the 
creation of a comprehensive framework for public procurement training and building a pilot training 
program particularly for trainers and officials responsible for the management of public procurement.
