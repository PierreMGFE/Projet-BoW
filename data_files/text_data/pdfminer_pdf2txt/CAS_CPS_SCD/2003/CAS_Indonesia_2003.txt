EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

i. Coun t ry Context. Indonesia continues i t s trans i t ion f r om an autocratic, centralized state to a 
democratic, decentralized one. I t has successfully regained macroeconomic and po l i t ica l stability, but 
economic g row th remains be low 4 percent, pover ty reduc t ion remains a challenge, and governance 
concerns continue to c loud i t s achievements. Pub l ic debt has dec l ined f r o m 100 percent o f GDP to 72 
percent, in f la t ion i s n o w be low 7 percent, and income pover ty has fa l len f r o m 27 percent in 1999 to 16 
percent today. However , 110 m i l l i o n people s t i l l l i v e on less than $2 a day, and rema in vulnerable to 
fa l l ing back in to severe pover ty . Indonesia continues to under-per form i ts neighbors in access to qua l i ty 
health, education and other basic services, as re f lec ted in the MDG indicators. Weak governance 
ins t i tu t ions are keep ing investors away and underm in ing service prov is ion , especially to the poor. 
Indonesia has undertaken re fonns that cou ld lead to a more e f fec t ive and accountable government, and a 
restoration o f grow th . But sound imp lemen ta t ion i s now needed to turn the prom ise i n t o rea l i ty . 

ii. T h e Government’s R e f o rm P rog ram . Fo l low ing i t s decision n o t to renew the IMF program after 
2003,’ the Government prepared a comprehensive package o f p o l i c y re forms through the end o f 2004. 
This “letter o f in ten t t o the Indonesian people” provides an agenda o f t ime-bound actions, covering 
macroeconomic management, f inanc ia l sector reform, and po l ic ies t o he lp raise investment and reduce 
poverty. The package i s ambitious - especially fo r an e lec t ion year -- but represents an impor tan t e f fo r t to 
spur the momen tum o f reforms, and serves as a mechanism to mon i to r the Government’s progress on the 
basis o f i t s ow n stated benchmarks. With steady progress on t h i s r e f o rm package, and an e f fec t ive PRSP,’ 
g row th over the CAS pe r iod i s expected to reach 5 percent b y 2006, enab l ing pover ty to decline to 11 
percent b y 2007. 

...

T h e Bank G r o u p Strategy. Fur ther progress in reduc ing pove r ty i s prevented b y tw o ma jor 
factors-low 
investment, and weak service provision-which 
in turn are caused p r ima r i ly b y problems o f 
governance. The Bank Group ’s entire e f for ts -- in the f o rm o f ana ly t ica l and advisory services, lending, 
I F C and MIGA activities, and donor coord ina t ion -- w i l l be to he lp address these problems. 

Improving the Climate for H i g h Quality Investment. B a n k G roup support w i l l be directed to 

address f i v e key areas that are essential to raise the rate o f investment f r o m i ts current leve l o f 20 
percent o f GDP: deepening macroeconomic stability, building a stronger f inanc ia l sector, 
fos ter ing a compe t i t ive pr iva te sector, building Indonesia’s infrastructure, and creating income 
opportunities f o r poo r households and farmers. 

Mak ing Service Delivery Responsive to the Needs of 

the Poor, Weak service de l ivery i s 
underm in ing Indonesia’s goa l o f imp rov ing the qua l i ty o f l i f e o f i t s citizens and the attainment o f 
i t s MDGs. Bank Group support w i l l thus be devoted to he lp revamp the management and 
accountability systems fo r service de l ivery to make prov iders more d i rec t ly accountable to their 
clients. Focus w i l l be g iven to implementing the pr inc ip les o f the W o r l d Development Report 
2004, especially in hea l th and education, but also in agr icu l tura l research, extension and 
irr iga t ion , and in pub l ic services in general. 

The Core Issue of Governance. Advances in governance w i l l be needed to address bo th CAS 
objectives. F o u r areas w i l l be g iven p r io r i ty : (i) mak ing development p lann ing more responsive to 

‘The IMF w i l l engage in pos t-program mon i to r ing beg inn ing in 2004. 
2As a b lend country, Indonesia’s PRSP prepara t ion i s not d i rec t ly l i n k e d to IDA access and was therefore no t a pre- 
requisite f o r B a n k C A S preparation. Indonesia’s I-PRSP was c ircu la ted t o the B o a r d in M a r c h 2003, and i t s full 
PRSP i s due to be comp le ted in m id-2004 .

constituents; (ii) imp rov ing pub l ic f inanc ia l management; (iii) strengthening the accountability o f 
loca l governments under a more coherent decentralization framework; and ( iv ) enhancing the 
pub l ic c red ib i l i ty , impa r t ia l i ty and accessibility o f the jus t ice sector. Se lec t iv i ty in the Bank’s 
ac t iv i t ies w i l l be determined l e s s b y sectoral pr ior i t ies than b y the oppor tun i ty to make progress 
in these areas. Corrup t ion poses a special p rob lem in Indonesia, and the coun try team aims to 
integrate governance and corrup t ion issues through the entire Indonesia program, shaping how 
projects are selected, designed, imp lemen ted and monitored.

Business Platforms-How 

v . 
the W o r l d B a n k w i l l De l iver . Indonesia’s massive decentralization 
ca l ls fo r a new approach to the de l ivery o f development assistance. The Bank w i l l leverage the projects i t 
finances w i t h ana ly t ica l work, p o l i c y advice, technical assistance, strategic partnerships and capacity 
building t o systematically increase standards o f governance at each leve l o f government the Bank 
engages. Fou r business p la t forms are envisioned: 
The Commun i ty D r i v e n Development P la t form : about 25 percent o f a l l lend ing (about $200 m i l l i o n 
per year) wou ld be allocated to scale up this successful program. 
The L o c a l Services P la t form : about 4 0 percent o f lend ing wou ld be allocated to he lp create 
accoun tab i l i ty at the d is tr ic t and p rov inc ia l levels. 
The Pub l ic U t i l i t y P la t form : about 15 percent o f lend ing wou ld help support investments in good 
corporate governance and e f f ic iency in water supply and energy. 
The Na t iona l Lend ing P la t form : about 20 percent o f lend ing wou ld be allocated to address central 
problems.

The CAS Framework 

v i . 
Scale o f W o r l d B a n k Activities. Th rough these p la t forms the Bank proposes a Base case w i t h 
lend ing in the range o f $450 - $850 m i l l ion , inc lud ing $230 m i l l i o n in IDA resources. The Base case 
assumes continued, but incremental, progress on the Econom ic Po l icy Package. Ev idence o f decisive 
momen tum in imp lemen t ing the re fo rm package cou ld lead to an “enhanced” Base case, in wh ich the 
B a n k wou ld o f fe r an adjustment loan in late 2004. The actual amount o f Base case lend ing wou ld also 
depend on the number o f districts and u t i l i t ies that qua l i fy through the ir governance re forms f o r Bank 
assistance. The C A S also includes a High case o f up to $1.4 b i l l ion , and a L o w case o f less than $300

m i l l i o n . The High case triggers have a l l been selected f r om the Government’s Econom ic Po l icy Package 
as those most impor tan t to achieving target outcomes in the three CAS areas and pu t t ing the country on a 
pa th t o stronger g row th and better l i v i n g standards. 

v i i . P rog ram Delivery-Portfolio Management , Ana lyt ica l and Adv isory Services (AAA ) , and

co r rup t ion risks, po r t fo l io performance has imp roved w i t h commitments at risk d ow n f r o m 39 percent 
(FY02) to 12 percent (FY03), and disbursements rema in ing above 20 percent. Po r t fo l io r i s k s w i l l be 
managed b y building external mon i to r ing mechanisms in to pro jec t designs, requ i r ing an t i-corrup t ion

The p la t forms w i l l also bring more coherence t o capacity building ac t iv i t ies w i t h the W o r l d Bank I n s t i t u t e

F i s c a l conso l ida t ion has been impressive, as the budget d e f i c i t has been reduced by two - th i rds t o 
an expected 1.9 percent o f GDP in 2003, and 1.3 percent3 in 2004, p r im a r i l y th rough cuts in

reforms, n o t a b l y bank sales and asset recoveries by BR A , the b a n k res t ruc tu r ing agency, have 
supported the macroeconomic gains. (See Annex C o n macroeconomic pe r fo rmance and

The achievements o f the past few years continue to be clouded by widespread 
concerns about governance and corruption across Indonesian society. The high hopes that 

the Refomzasi movemen t w o u l d break the h o l d o f the vested interests and the co r rup t ion , 
collusion, and nepo t ism that characterized the la te r years o f the Soeharto era have n o t been 
realized. F e w have been h e l d t o account f o r the the f t o f p u b l i c resources, and there are signs that 
“money po l i t ics ” i s at w o r k a l l ow i n g o l d elites t o reacquire the i r p rev ious assets, and new elites 
t o consolidate the i r pos i t ions . W h i l e co r rup t ion captures headlines, the issues created b y 
Indonesia’s weak ins t i tu t ions have w ide r imp l ica t ions . T h e “please you r boss”, upwa rd - look ing 
accoun tab i l i ty and r ew a r d system o f Indonesia’s cen t ra l ized N e w O rde r c i v i l service l inge rs o n 
at the expense o f c i t izen pa r t ic ipa t ion and accoun tab i l i ty f o r results. T h e pe rcep t ion that 
co r rup t ion i s s t i l l entrenched in the p o l i t i c a l system has damaged Indonesia’s inves tmen t c l ima te 
and generated popu la r resentment and resignation. T h e uneven bu rden that co r rup t ion and poo r 
governance p lace o n p o o r fam i l ies raises serious issues o f equ i ty and fairness. Indeed, addressing 
governance was i d e n t i f i e d in the Bank ’s 2001 Pove r ty Repo r t as the single-most impo r tan t 
agenda f o r reduc ing pove r ty in a l l i t s dimensions. M a n y senior Indonesians recognize that the 
“crisis o f governance” i s becom ing a “crisis o f development”, and that a who le new mindset i s 
needed, i n c l u d i n g tools, instruments and capabilities o f a modern, responsive government. 

5. 

Un l ike many other countries facing similar governance problems, Indonesia has 
begun to undertake impo r tan t structural reforms tha t could ultimately lead to more 

transparent and accountable government. An amb i t ious p rog ram o f electoral re fo rms has 
been in t roduced that w i l l , ove r the c om i n g f ew years make po l icymake rs at a l l leve ls o f

Bu t these bold reforms-in significant respects as far-reaching as any country in 
transition-have been undermined by weak implementation. As a result, the gap between the 

p rom ise and the rea l i ty o f r e f o rm in Indones ia has been large. Y e t i t i s impo r tan t t o recognize 
that there i s m u c h t o w o r k w i t h in seeking t o support Indonesia’s fu tu re r e f o rm path. The lega l 
f ramewo rk f o r necessary s t ruc tu ra l re fo rms i s in place; the challenge i s m o r e n a r r ow l y focused 
o n strengthening the incen t ives f o r e f fec t ive imp lemen ta t ion . Desp i te a v ib ran t arena o f p o l i t i c a l 
compe t i t ion , the m a j o r parties tend t o agree o n the basic thrust o f r e f o rm p o i n t i n g towards mo re 
d i rec t accountability, greater transparency and mo re responsible f inanc ia l management. This 
suggests that there i s a s t rong founda t ion f o r r e f o rm in the c om i n g years even though there 
remains m u c h w o r k t o be done t o harness the b o l d in i t ia t ives o f the Reformasi pe r iod i n t o 
e f fec t ive ins t i tu t iona l and behav io ra l change. 

7. 

This mixed s t o r y - o f solid progress in economic policy-making, and halting 
progress on governance issues-is 
captured in the Coun t ry Performance Institutional 

Assessment (CP IA ) ratings. F igu re 2 shows that the good progress in macroeconomic p o l i c y 
and reasonable progress in structural po l ic ies i s o n l y beg inn ing t o b e ma tched by progress in 
social ind ica to rs and in ind ica to rs o f governance. W h i l e f o r mos t ind ica to rs Indones ia i s w e l l 
ahead o f the average f o r IDA countries, performance o n p rope r ty rights and governance, 
transparency and accoun tab i l i ty , and ex te rna l debt management are lagg ing . Mo reove r , the fact 
that neither inves tmen t leve ls n o r (broadly) the qua l i ty o f p u b l i c services have re tu rned t o the i r 
pre-crisis levels-in 
spite o f imp ress ive imp rovemen ts in the mac roeconom ic context and 
opportunities p rov ided by decentralization-is 
a re f lec t ion o f the weaknesses o f pub l ic 
institutions, a l a c k o f transparency and accountability, and co r rup t ion . 

8. 
Finally, Indonesia i s no t yet free f rom risks to political and social stability, against 
which democracy, g row th and poverty reduction rema in the best weapons. The recent 

resump t ion o f m i l i t a r y ac t ion in A c e h demonstrates that so far, decen t ra l iza t ion and special 
autonomy, have n o t reso lved separatist tensions. At the same time, ex t rem is t I s l am i c movements 
b o t h w i t h i n Indones ia and across the reg ion , though representing a sma l l m i n o r i t y , continue t o 
pose a heavy bu rden o f te r ro r ism threats. The t w i n threats o f separatism and te r ro r ism raise 
concerns about security a n d unce r ta in ty that impose high costs o n the popu la t ion and dampen the 
response o f investors t o Indonesia’s strong macroeconomic achievements. A t the same time, 
these t w i n threats unde r l ie a con t inued p ow e r f u l p o l i t i c a l r o l e f o r the m i l i t a r y that weakens some 
o f the recent gains in es tab l ish ing greater transparency and accoun tab i l i ty in the p o l i t i c a l system.

D. ECONOMIC OUTLOOK, EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT A N D FINANCING NEEDS 

12. 

A gradual increase in g row th character izes the Base case economic outlook. 

Supported by a recove r ing in te rna t iona l economy, and a s low but steady imp rovemen t in the 
investment climate, Indonesia’s GDP g r ow t h rate i s expected t o reach 5 percent b y 2006, up 
f r o m the 3.5 percent in 2003, and b road ly similar rates ove r the las t C A S pe r iod . I n f l a t i o n i s 
expected t o d rop fu r the r t o some 5 percent pe r annum and domestic interest rates t o d rop in l ine . 
Unde r this scenario, the pove r ty ra te w o u l d f a l l f r o m 16 percent in 2002 t o 11 percent in 2007, 
less than h a l f the 27 percent i t was in 1999. T h e external env i ronmen t i s l i k e l y t o be slightly 
mo re suppo r t ive o f Indones ia ’s g r ow t h than ove r the past years: the mos t recent W o r l d B a n k 

As a b l e n d country, Indonesia’s PRSP prepara t ion i s n o t d i rec t ly l i n k e d to IDA access and was therefore no t a pre- 
requisite fo r B a n k CAS preparation. Indonesia’s I-PRSP was c ircu la ted t o the B o a r d in M a r c h 2003.

projections envision a p ick -up in the rate o f global GDP g row th and o f w o r l d trade.7 Indonesia 
w i l l face increasing competition on traditional markets, particularly f r om China, and that 
competition w i l l intensify after exp i ry o f the MFA agreement in 2005. At the same time, China 
w i l l be a rap id ly g row ing export market fo r Indonesia in the years ahead and, on balance, we 
therefore expect continued export growth. The real exchange rate, wh i le having appreciated in 
recent years, remains below i t s pre-crisis levels. Nevertheless, a competitive exchange rate w i l l 
be necessary to underpin Indonesia’s trade competitiveness.8 Impo r ts w i l l grow faster, as a resu l t 
o f recovering investment, and the current account surplus i s thus expected to gradually decline 
f r om the record $7.5 b i l l ion , o r 4.3 percent o f GDP in 2002. (For more detail on macroeconomic 
performance and prospects, see Annex D.) 

13. Our Base case pro ject ions inc lude gradual increases in investment rates and fac to r 
p roduc t iv i ty , wh ich in turn a r e p red ica ted o n cont inued sound macroeconomic 
pe r fo rmance and a mode ra te imp rovemen t in the investment c l imate . We expect the 

Government to continue fiscal consolidation, although at a more moderate pace than the 
Government i tse l f projects. We assume a balanced budget b y 2007, down f r om 1.9 percent 
projected f o r 2003. Consolidation w i l l no t on ly come f r om further cuts in f u e l subsidies-already 
down f r om over 5 percent o f GDP in 2001 to 1.4 percent o f GDP projected fo r 2003-but also 
f r om an increase in non -o i l tax revenues on the back o f accelerated revenue administration 
reforms. The Government debt to GDP ra t io w i l l continue to f a l l through 2007 f r om 67 percent 
b y the end o f this year to below 50 percent b y 2007 given the debt repayment schedule, exchange 
rate assumptions, and nominal GDP growth. Likewise, the total external debt to GDP ratio, 
wh ich had dropped to 76 percent in 2002 i s projected to continue to decline to about 40 percent 
in 2007. We expect investments as a share o f GDP to gradually r i s e f r om 20 percent n ow to 22 
percent in 2007. 

14. 

Desp i te f u r t h e r fiscal consolidation, f inanc ing needs w i l l b e p a r t i cu l a r l y h igh in the 
first t w o years o f the CAS pe r iod . With the expiration o f the IMF EFF arrangement, Paris C lub 
rescheduling ceases at the end o f 2003, adding some $3 b i l l i o n in additional financing needs. In 
addition, an increasing share o f bank re-capitalization bonds w i l l f a l l due over the com ing years, 
wh i le B R A asset recoveries are ta i l ing off, as are privatization receipts. As a resu l t , higher 
financing i s required to support a pub l ic investment program that complements private 
investment. With respect to domestic financing, the Government w i l l l o o k to the domestic bond 
market and a d raw -down in deposits. However, increased foreign-financed disbursement w i l l 
also be required as one important element in b r ing ing about enhanced investment levels and 
growth. Fo re ign financed disbursements on the order o f U S $ 3 b i l l i o n w i l l be required annually 
over this period, relative to a leve l o f $2.3 b i l l i o n per annum over the last three years, excluding 
Paris Club. 

’ The W o r l d Bank’s G loba l Development Prospects 2004 publication envisages wor ld GDP growth c l imb ing f rom 2 
percent in 2003 to 3 percent in 2004-2005, and regional (East Asia and Pacific) growth rates r is ing to 6.6-6.7 percent 
in 2004-2005. Wo r ld trade volume i s expected to increase f r om 4.6 percent in 2003 to 8 percent in 2004-2005. 
Bank projections anticipate a real exchange depreciation o f about 1.2 percent annually over the CAS period.

THE WORLD BANK I N INDONESIA: LEARNING FROM RECENT 

EXPERIENCE 

A. LESSONS 

FROM THE TRANSITION PER IOD 

15. 

I n the a f te rma th o f the economic crisis, the W o r l d B a n k was seen b y many as p a r t 

o f the problem ra the r than the solution. To many Indonesians the Bank was associated w i t h 
the Soeharto Government, wh ich i t had supported through loans and po l icy advice fo r 32 years. 
The Bank was a contributor to Indonesia’s external debt, perhaps the country’s most visible 
economic p rob lem in the post crisis years, w i thou t being able to contribute to debt rescheduling 
or debt reduction. And the Bank’s reputation was damaged as i t was perceived to have fa i led to 
take a stand against corruption, wh i le lending large sums o f money in support o f the Soeharto 
regime. As o f mid-2000, the Bank had $11.8 b i l l i o n o f IBRD funds outstanding to Indonesia. T o 
many NGOs this was a m i l ls tone around Indonesia’s neck. And to the Bank ’s risk managers, this 
posed one o f the most r isky parts o f the overall po r t fo l io . 

16. 
Ove r the last few years, the B an k has sought to actively confront these issues, 
mak ing progress and learning impo r tan t lessons. First, our debt exposure to Indonesia has 

been lowered. In agreement w i t h the Government, lending was reduced dramatically f r om an 
average o f $ 1.3 b i l l i o n per year before the crisis, to about $450 m i l l i o n over the last three years. 
As a result the Bank’s exposure to Indonesia has dropped b y some $1.5 b i l l ion , and w i l l f a l l b y a 
further $700 m i l l i o n in FY04. Second, as the Bank’s po r t fo l io has shrunk, po r t fo l io performance 
has p icked up. Consolidation, project restructuring and intensive supervision have helped 
po r t fo l io performance recover f r om i t s F Y 0 2 post-decentralization dip. Commitments at risk, 
wh ich reached 39 percent in FY02 , dropped to 12 percent b y end FY03 . Third, the Bank shifted 
i t s focus (and i t s reputation) towards a ma jo r expansion o f our wo rk o n community-driven 
development programs, governance and anti-corruption (see Section B), and engagement w i t h 
c i v i l society. 

17. 

Recent project outcomes have been mixed. Recent OED ratings largely apply to 

projects that began before the crisis, and thus teach lessons about the need t o be f lex ib le at times 
o f stress. O f the 30 projects closed in FY00-02, 60 percent were rated moderately satisfactory or 
above, wh i le 37 percent were rated moderately unsatisfactory or below. Problems iden t i f ied 
understandably inc luded lack o f counterpart funding and more generally a lack o f ownership on 
the part o f Government during the transition period. Lack o f supervision f r om central 
Government and f r om the Bank was identified in several situations, as was more generally the 
break-down o f traditional top-down project design and administration. D u r i n g the past CAS 
period, therefore, an e f fo r t has been made to introduce a new generation o f projects, giving much 
greater emphasis to participatory approaches, being sensitive to the capacities at loca l and central 
levels o f Government, and introducing mechanisms fo r loca l leve l accountability. Some o f the 
lessons f r om the past CAS pe r iod are summarized in B o x 1. 

18. 

Indonesia remained in the Base case throughout the last CAS period, but has now 

broadly achieved the H i g h case. Triggers fo r the H i g h case gave emphasis to the continuation 
o f the post-crisis reforms. Table 2 summarizes progress made over the past three years on bo th

Box 1: Lessons from OED Reviews and the Last CAS 

T h e lessons from the Operations Evaluation Department (OED) review o f the Bank’s role leading up to the c r is is , * which 
informed the last CAS, continue to provide a foundation for the Bank’s program: 
In the area o f structural reforms, the Country Assistance Note recommended: 
Strengthening Bank support to the Government in improving governance by improving f iscmudge t transparency, 
strengthening oversight and voice mechanisms, enhancing transparency in the incentive framework, and reforming 
the c i v i l service. 
Concerted effort, including ESW, to help restore banking sector soundness. 
Updating poverty and distribution data and re-thinking long-term intra-sectoral commitments, with the aim o f 
supporting poverty alleviation more directly. 
T h i s CAS has integrated these lessons: 
I t ca l ls direct attention to Indonesia’s poor governance and corruption and, through the innovation o f operational 
platforms, i s mainstreaming support for improving transparency, oversight and voice w h l e continuing to pursue c iv i l 
service reform. 
Poverty and income distribution data have been updated, and t h i s CAS puts forward an intensive analytical program 
on poverty. (See Annex D). Community Driven Development efforts, which comprised over 50 percent o f new 
commitments under the last CAS and channeled funds directly to grass-roots development projects selected by 
villagers, including the poor, are supporting poverty alleviation more directly. T h i s CAS aims to bu i ld from this 
promising foundation. 
Intensive Bank support, including through ESW, w i l l continue to help strengthen the financial sector. 
A more recent OED Project Performance Assessment** which draws lessons from the Bank’s crisis-response adjustment and 
TA loans, has informed the assumptions which define t h i s CAS: In a country with deeply rooted and widespread governance 
issues, and where authorities are not committed to deep govemance reforms, the ability to affect fundamental reforms with 
adjustment and technical assistance support has been limited: 
Under t h i s CAS the use o f adjustment lending w i l l continue to be very l im i ted and only be employed in support o f 
government-driven reform efforts. 
T h e overall CAS program and the H igh case triggers have been aligned to the Govemment’s program to support 
ownership and effective implementation. 
T h i s CAS also learns from other experience and lessons drawn from the last CAS period: 
Close partnerships with donor partners and c i v i l society, such as through the CG I process and Partnership for 
Govemance Reform, enhances our effectiveness, as does current h igh quality collaboration w i th the Fund. 
Decentralization i s for r e a l and a f fec ts everything we do. I t poses r e a l opportunities and r e a l challenges which, going 
forward, we must address centrally in our strategy. 
More systematic monitoring and evaluation o f the impacts o f our interventions i s essential to an innovative program 
such as ours. T h i s requires priority going forward. 
Strong analytical work continues to be a strength o f the Bank and i s appreciated by the client and our partners. 
Increasing i t s leverage to better inform the design o f operational interventions and affect policy change i s key.

the triggers and related measures in wh ich the Bank Group p rov ided technical support. B y the 
end o f FY03 on ly one High case trigger-the 
issuance o f a new Procurement decree-remained 
unmet. This progress, however, must be tempered b y the fact that much s t i l l remains to be done 
on the re fo rm agenda, and implementation o f policies and laws remains a serious issue.

A central lesson o f the Bank Group’s experience in Indonesia i s tha t our entire 
success w i l l be judged by the contribution that our programs a r e seen to make towards 
greater transparency and accountability, and b y the standards o f integrity w i th which we 

implement these programs. This has consistently been one o f the m a i n messages o f ou r 
enhanced C A S consultations with c i v i l society (see B o x 2) and the Indones ia Coun t ry Team’s 
o w n self-assessment o f the Bank ’s objectives ove r the n e x t several years. Since the crisis, the 
B a n k has responded t o the t r i p l e threat o f co r rup t ion by sca l ing back ou r lend ing , w h i l e seeking 
t o build a capacity t o act as a catalyst f o r an t i -co r rup t ion re fo rms , c u l t i v a t i n g partnerships t o 
p romo te g o o d governance, and strengthening the team’s o w n capac i ty f o r m i t i g a t i n g co r rup t ion 
r isks t o ou r projects. M u c h has been achieved in each o f these areas, p r o v i d i n g a stronger 
founda t ion f o r the B a n k t o respond t o Indonesia’s increased need f o r deve lopmen t assistance. 

Box 2: CAS Consultations Highlight Indonesia’s Development Challenges 

As part o f the preparation o f t h i s CAS, extensive consultations with various c i v i l society representatives, both in Jakarta and 
in the regions, through focus groups, interviews and feedback sessions, highlighted pr ior i ty development issues that 
participants thought the Bank should address. (See Annex E). They closely mirror and validate the key challenges posed 
above. First , participants saw “KKN” (corruption, collusion and nepotism) as the country’s core problem. As i t was put by 
one participant, “corruption i s the r e a l root o f poverty in t h i s country”. Many ca l led for particular attention to legal reform as 
a related development priority. Second, participants s t ressed the need to alleviate poverty, especially through job creation and 
economic growth. Third, consultations raised the need to improve essential services-especially in education and health-as 
a key development priority. W i th regard to service delivery, concerns were ra ised about corruption and quality. Fourth, 
related to both growth and governance, Indonesians f e l t there was a need to pay more attention to improving agriculture and 
environmental management. 

21. 

Going forward, the B a n k G roup w i l l integrate four key an t i -co r rup t ion principles 
across its entire p rog ram in Indonesia: 

0 A clear and consistent voice raising corruption concerns and promoting feasible 
responses across a l l sectors o f our operations. In the past three years the B a n k 

inves ted considerable e f fo r ts in assisting the development o f the Partnership f o r 
Governance Reform-an 
Indonesian-led, mu l t i -dono r supported e f f o r t t o raise awareness 
o f and devise so lu t ions t o governance problems. T h e B a n k i s comp lemen t ing this w o r k

2003 a mu l t i -sec to r B a n k repo r t dissecting “how co r rup t ion wo rks ” in a w i d e range o f

corruption institution, the Bank’s projects described in the pages ahead have been chosen 
to open up mu l t ip le anti-corruption entry points at different levels o f government and 
across different sectors. C D D projects promote participatory planning and mon i to r ing to 
reduce corruption in village leve l governments. D is t r ic t leve l projects w i l l seek to select 
kabupa ten (districts) and ko ta (municipalities) w i t h a demonstrated commitment to 
greater accountability and transparency and wo rk w i t h them to improve their financial 
management and pro-poor planning capacity. Justice sector wo rk w i l l target bo th 
enhancing access to justice fo r the poor as w e l l as p rov id ing technical assistance to the 
new central institutions designed to fight corruption. The Bank w i l l respond in particular 
to partners w i t h a demonstrated track record o f commitment to anti-corruption reforms. 

Mechan isms to m i t iga te co r rup t ion risks f o r all p ro jec ts th rough empowerment , 

pa r t ic ipa t ion and transparency . The lessons o f our successful C D D projects in 
Indonesia demonstrate the impact o f smart project design fo r reducing corruption r i s k s 
and getting more development impact fo r less investment. D i rec t client participation in 
the selection and implementation o f projects engages citizens as monitors w i t h a direct 
incentive to reveal corruption problems. Pub l ic disclosure requirements at key stages o f 
the project make asset diversion more d i f f i c u l t and build pub l ic c red ib i l i ty behind the 
project. Enhanced supervision through project facilitators in the community l inked to 
national networks has been particularly successful in revealing corruption allegations. T o 
ensure smart project designs, a l l projects are required to devise an An t i -Co r rup t ion Plan, 
assessing r i s k s o f corruption inherent in the project and proposing design and 
supervision mechanisms to mitigate those r i s k s . 

P re -emp t ive audits, vigorous

better mechanisms to detect and handle corruption allegations in our projects, the Bank

proactively uncovering the methods and systems that a l low corruption to f lou r ish in each 
sector. Professionals f r om the Department o f Ins t i tu t iona l In teg r i ty (INT) w i l l continue 
to be brought in to investigate corruption allegations, and they w i l l b e supplemented b y 
loca l investigative staff. Where m i s u s e o f funds has been confirmed, the Bank w i l l 
declare mis-procurement, seek return o f affected funds, b lack l is t offending contractors, 
and encourage the pursuit o f appropriate disciplinary and legal action. Where 
satisfactory progress i s not being made in responding to corruption allegations the Bank 
w i l l discontinue further operations in the relevant sector, region, o r government agency. 
Pub l ic disclosure o f corruption cases w i l l be made on the Bank’s Indonesia website,

A. THE WORLD BANK GROUP'S STRATEGIC FOCUS 

23. 

F o r the coming CAS period the Bank G roup w i l l continue to focus i t s p rog ram on 

those areas most crucial to poverty reduction. A t present there are tw o p r ima ry constraints to 
further reductions in poverty. These are: first, inadequate productive employment opportunities, 
wh ich result f r om l o w investment and a weak investment climate; and second, the lack o f quality 
service delivery to poor people. Progress in these two areas, in turn, i s being compromised b y the 
underlying p rob lem o f weak governance. The W o r l d Bank Group's strategy w i l l be to address 
the objectives o f strengthening the investment climate and service delivery including, critically, 
the key issue o f governance. Fou r delivery platforms - corresponding to the community, local, 
public u t i l i ty , and national levels (see next section) - w i l l be used to deliver results in these areas 
(see results ma t r ix in Annex B9).

24. 

A weak investment climate i s undermining Indonesia's future. Indonesia's economy 

has been g row ing over the past three years at a rate o f l e s s than 4 percent per year-lower 
than 
what i s needed to absorb the 2.0-2.5 m i l l i o n new entrants in the labor force every year. 
Unemployment i s rising and wages in the in fo rma l sector are stagnant. At roo t i s the lack o f 
investment that at the t ime o f the crisis declined f r om around 30 percent o f GDP to around 20 
percent, where i t has remained since. W h i l e maintaining the gains o f macroeconomic stability 
w i l l continue to be c r i t ica l through the elections and the next CAS period, deepening the 
financial sector, fostering a regulatory and ins t i tu t iona l environment conducive to private sector 
growth, building the infrastructure fo r growth, and ensuring that g row th benefits the poor w i l l be 
fundamental. The B a n k Group's support w i l l thus be focused in f i v e areas, w i t h improved

Ma in ta in ing macroeconomic stability. 

In addition 
to continuing

macroeconomic mon i to r ing and advice, the Bank w i l l help strengthen the governance o f 
institutions that are c r i t ica l to underpin macroeconomic stability and growth. Under preparation, 
j o i n t l y w i t h the IMF, i s a project to support r e f o rm o f the M i n i s t r y o f Finance, inc lud ing pub l ic 
financial management and tax and customs administration. Public expenditure reviews are

Bu i ld ing a stronger financial sector. Bank G roup activities in the financial sector w i l l 
gradually move f r om past emphasis on crisis response and management towards a medium-term 
focus on overall financial sector development and reform-including 
non-bank financial 
institutions, capital markets, ru ra l and micro-finance, and imp rov ing access o f the poor to 
financial services. 

Strengthening the banking sector. Adv iso ry services fo r w ind -down o f IBRA and post- 
IBRA institutions, re fo rm o f state-owned banks, improvements to regulation and 
supervision, and establishment o f a safety ne t w i l l be supported. Technical assistance to

0 Creating a diversified f inanc ia l sector. The Bank w i l l support non-bank financial 
institutions-including 
capital markets, insurance, and pensions-and 
their regulation 
and supervision through technical assistance, advisory services, and AAA . A lending 
project to support capital market infrastructure in FY05 i s under discussion. A

supported through the ongoing C D D and ru ra l area development projects. A micro- 
finance project as w e l l as analytical wo rk w i l l support increased linkages o f these 
institutions w i t h the fo rma l financial sector and wo rk w i t h commercial banks to increase 
their outreach in ru ra l areas. 

0 Anti-money laundering. The Bank w i l l coordinate w i t h other donors and provide 
advisory services and AAA to support Indonesia in imp lemen t ing i t s recently revised 
anti-money laundering legislation. 

0 Joint ZFC-Bank activities. I F C and the Bank w i l l w o r k together to assist in the 
development o f financial market infrastructure such as credit bureaus, and key market 
segments such as housing finance and securitization.

Fos te r ing a compet it ive p r i v a t e sector. Integrating private sector involvement in to 
Bank projects as w e l l as activities aimed at developing the private sector in a decentralized 
environment w i l l be areas o f k e y focus. Bank Group support w i l l include: 

Building the institutions for a competitive economy. A policy-based loan programmed 
fo r FY05 l i n k e d to significant progress in the Government’s Economic Po l icy Package 
w i l l support improvements in the regulatory environment that w i l l enhance private sector 
competition. Support w i l l also be aligned to improve competition in key industries, 
inc lud ing support fo r the regulatory bodies in electricity, telecommunications, o i l and 
gas. Ongoing power projects, as w e l l as a new domestic gas project w i l l promote 
unbundling and enhanced competition in the power sectors. The Bank w i l l also seek 
greater c la r i ty and p red ic tab i l i ty in the enforcement o f environmental regulations, 
through support to the Government’s Good Environmental Governance (GEG) Program. 

Monitoring the investment climate and promoting dialogue. A program o f national, 
loca l and ru ra l business climate surveys i s currently being set up, and w i l l be supported 
b y diagnostic wo rk o n private sector constraints, inc lud ing a Diagnostic Trade 
Integration Study and a Domestic Trade Study. The national-level Private Sector Fo rum 
w i l l continue to be organized b y the I F C in the context o f the Consultative Group 
meetings to enhance the dialogue between the Government and the private sector. 
Current topics include, fo r example, private investment in the power sector, mining, 
banking, the ro le o f the commercial courts and corporate governance. At the loca l level,

the Bank w i l l support imp rov ing the business climate through dialogue between private 
sector, inc lud ing small-scale entrepreneurs, and the loca l government. 

Strengthening corporate governance and key oversight institutions. Corporate sector

Bu i ld ing Indonesia’s infrastructure. The lack o f investment in infrastructure over the 
past f ive years i s a ma jo r threat to Indonesia’s economic prospects. Competitiveness i s being 
undermined due to congestion costs; the prospect o f power shortages hangs over Java. Over 40 
percent o f households, mos t ly rural, s t i l l do no t have power connections. O n l y 15 percent o f 
households have access to piped d r ink ing water, le t alone to pub l ic sewage systems (1.3 percent 
o f the urban population, the lowest in coverage in Asia). The Bank G roup i s heavily committed 
to help confront these challenges, through analytical and advisory services and financing. 

Supporting a strategic framework for infrastructure. A ma jo r infrastructure strategy, 
prepared b y the Bank in consultation w i t h the Government, w i l l be completed b y end- 
2003, and w i l l guide the Bank’s national-level p o l i c y dialogue and future engagement. A 
key feature o f our support w i l l be the development o f sound implementing regulations 
fo r new ly passed laws, and c la r i ty o f delineation o f agency roles at national and regional 
levels. Implementation o f the on-going Private Participation in Infrastructure TA loan 
w i l l leverage private investment in the infrastructure sector. 

Providing power for growth. Wo rk ing closely w i t h the As ian Development Bank and 
others, the Bank’s focus in energy w i l l be on completing the implementation o f the legal 
and po l icy framework to help attract private investors and to complete the restructuring 
o f the electricity and gas en t i t ies . A Bank project i s supporting the restructuring o f the 
state electricity u t i l i t y (PLN) and the implementation o f an appropriately sustainable 
tariff 
framework. Supported b y a FY05 Domestic Gas Restructuring Project, the 

20 

Indonesia Country Assistance Strategy 

restructuring o f the state gas u t i l i t y (PGN) wou ld be completed and the p r ic ing o f natural 
gas wou ld be rationalized and implemented. The access to electricity outside Java - B a l i 
wou ld be increased through a proposed Ru ra l E lec t r i f ica t ion project that i s under 
discussion fo r FY06. 

Building national transportation and communications infrastructure. In addition to 
several projects that support in fo rma t ion technology systems, the Bank has several 
projects in the current po r t fo l io that support the development o f road infrastructure. The 
Bank w i l l provide further support through the proposed Strategic Roads Infrastructure 
Project wh ich w i l l support capacity expansion in heavily t ra f f icked corridors, p r inc ipa l ly 
in Java. Continued technical support fo r improvements in the ins t i tu t iona l context fo r t o l l 
road development wou ld be provided. 

Building sub-national infrastructure within a decentralized framework. The proposed 
Second Eastern Indonesia Transport Project w i l l finance improvements in roads and 
other transport facilities that w i l l support and promote g row th in l e s s developed regions. 
The East Java Regional Development and Re fo rm Project w i l l build capacity fo r 
decentralized management o f sub-national infrastructure and finance targeted investment 
in p rov inc ia l and mu l t i - ju r isd ic t iona l infrastructure. The U rban Sector Re fo rm and 
Development Program (1 & 2) w i l l support loca l government leve l infrastructure 
development. 

Improving the quality and coverage of water and sanitation. Indonesia’s 300 sem i - 
autonomous water u t i l i t ies (PDAMs) were already struggling in 1997, when they were 
devastated b y the financial crisis. As a resu l t , coverage rates fo r water supply have been 
dropping throughout Indonesia in bo th urban and ru ra l areas during the past six years, 
mak ing the achievement o f the MDG in this area un l ike ly . Bank support, through two 
projects, w i l l be provided b y wo rk ing w i t h progressive P D AM s selected through a 
competitive process. Support fo r ru ra l water supply w i l l build o n advances made b y 
government 
in community based water supply and sanitation 
fo r ru ra l areas. 
Approximately 2000 villages w i l l benefit f r om these programs (WSSL IC 2 & 3).

C r e a t ing income opportun it ies f o r poo re r households and fa rme rs . In addition to the 

constraints posed b y inadequate loca l infrastructure, poorer households also suffer f r om 
uncertain property rights, pressure to move to marginalized land and to resort to unsustainable 
resource management practices (whether i t be forests or coasts). They have l im i ted access to 
capital and l im i t e d access to the justice system. As many o f these i s s u e s h o l d back ru ra l and 
urban poor alike, a number o f Bank programs are active in bo th settings. The L a n d Management 
Program (FY05) w i l l c r i t ica l ly focus on developing a national land po l icy , imp rov ing land tenure 
security, imp rov ing loca l government capacity in land management functions, and enhancing the 
efficiency, transparency and service delivery o f land t i t l i n g and registration. C D D programs seek 
to enhance incomes o f bo th villagers and slum dwellers through participation in decision mak ing 
and access to resources fo r poor men and women. The Bank’s poverty AAA agenda w i l l have a 
particular focus in iden t i fy ing the constraints to g row th in investment and incomes f o r poorer 
households as w e l l as reducing r i s k s to these households. Fo r example, analysis i s being 
undertaken on the scope fo r foreign earnings t o improve the welfare o f female m ig ran t workers,

Box 4: Support fo r Poor R u r a l Households and F a rm e r s 

Getting agriculture moving w i l l be c r i t i c a l to alleviating rural poverty in Indonesia, which despite recent improvements, 
remains at four times the level o f urban poverty. At the same time, the continued structural s h i f t in rural households’ incomes 
out o f agriculture and into non-farm activities, w i l l remain important in the overall poverty reduction strategy. Accordingly, 
th is CAS significantly increases Bank support for agriculture and rural development, as compared to the past five years since 
the c r is is . However, the ea r l ie r foundation for growth o f the agriculture sector has weakened, and new directions are needed 
for revitalizing sector expansion. Growth was bu i l t on rice and on private plantation investment off-Java through the 1990s. 
In the future, gains in agricultural productivity w i l l come from h igh value commodities (smallholder estate crops, 
horticulture, livestock, f ishe r ies ) . Currently, these comprise around 55 percent o f agricultural production, but w i l l likely 
account for 80 percent o f the growth in output. R i c e i s s t i l l important (26 percent o f agricultural production), but w i l l 
unlikely account for much o f t h e incremental output. Accordingly, the CAS i s focused on supporting sector growth in these 
new directions- i t aims to enhance agricultural productivity, increase the role o f producer organizations in marketing and 
commodity value chains, strengthen agriculture’s l i n k s to the rural economy, and focus on the Government’s role in 
supporting the transition. 
Benefits o f on-going projects w i l l be realized during the coming CAS period, and in cases these are expected to be scaled up 
through follow-on projects. An on-going Decentralization o f Agricultural and Forestry Extension Services Project, which 
pilots empowering small shareholders to drive the agricultural services agenda in 16 districts, w i l l be scaled up in the 
proposed FEAT1 project, which w i l l also tighten links to revitalized public agricultural research and commerciaUagribusiness 
sector. IFC’s PENSA program w i l l compliment these efforts by fostering l i n k s between farming communities and agro- 
processing. T h e CDD platform w i l l beef-up i t s focus on the needs o f smallholders and engage w i th and support emerging 
farmer organizations. The enabling environment to support increased diversification in the rural economy, w i l l by supported 
by accelerated land t i t l ing (Land Management Project); better rural infrastructure-both 
in the watedimgation sector 
(WISMP 1 and 2) and for rural accesdroads (through CDD and ILGRP); and strengthen Government capacity (particularly at 
the decentralized level) to better deliver essential services, and rein in the explosion o f local taxes and fees that burden small 
farmers and impede domestic commodity markets (ILGRP). In the coastal areas, the Bank w i l l continue to support a national 
effort to engage communities in collaborative management o f coral r e e f ecosystems (COREMAP 2), and support targeted 
poverty alleviation in poor coastal fishing communities, through the proposed Marginal Fishing Communities Project. 
Finally, the Catchment Protection Project would integrate community forestry w i th possible mobilization o f carbon finance. 
Recent and planned analytical and policy work w i l l continue to underpin these directions in project des ign and investment 
focus. Recent outputs addressed: (i) decentralization o f land administration as well as the broader framework o f land policy; 
( i i ) rural producer organizations and their emerging capacity and roles; (iii) micro/rural finance policy. Planned work on 
D i s t r i c t level governance, on the rural investment climate survey, commodity value chains, and sources o f rural incomes, w i l l 
contribute to pipeline projects and policy dialogue.

Indonesia Country Assistance Strategy 

Box 5: Im p r o v i n g Service D e l i v e r y T h r o u g h G r e a t e r Accoun tab i l i ty 

The Bank Group’s program to improve service delivery draws from the WDR 2004 framework. Central here i s to make t h e 
service providers - schools, c l in ics , extension services, public works departments, license agencies etc - accountable to those 
who are supposed to benefit from these services. T h e chart below shows three “routes o f accountability”: 
T h e “long” route, whereby c i t izens give feedback (very indirectly) through central govemment. 
T h e “medium” route, whereby under Indonesia’s decentralization, local govemments have the responsibility for 
many services, and are thus the channel for citizens’ voice on service quality. 
T h e “short” route, whereby users give direct feedback (and decision-making) to the provider. 
In i t s support for improved services the Bank w i l l be seeking to strengthen each o f these routes o f accountability to improve 
service delivery - and each project proposal w i l l be assessed in the l igh t o f t h i s framework. Particularly important w i l l be a 
systematic emphasis on the “short route”, the bottom arrow below -- making providers more directly accountable to c l ien ts 
and citizens, and supporting community organizations that can articulate their needs and ho ld providers to deliver. 
Interventions w i l l foster the responsiveness o f providers to clients - whether they be parent-teacher associations, water-user 
associations, or farmers associations. Most directly, villagers w i l l be involved in direct decision-making in how public funds 
are spent in a l l CDD projects. 
Accountability l i n k s through local govemment w i l l also be given a much greater emphasis than under ea r l ie r central 
govemment managed projects. T h i s i s the essence o f the Local Govemment Platform, discussed in the next section. Our 
efforts w i l l focus on governance reforms that, for example, enhance participatory processes in planning, transparent budgets, 
and c i t izen monitoring through the development o f watch-dog citizen forums, media training etc. Our projects w i l l also 
support benchmarking and performance ratings o f l o c a l govemments and providers to t h i s end. T h e A A A agenda w i l l 
strengthen the accountability to c l ien ts o f govemment and providers alike, through monitoring surveys such as public 
expenditure tracking surveys and facility level surveys. 
T h e central govemment also has a crucial role to play - and we w i l l continue to provide support to enhance the policy 
framework for service delivery. For example, opening up service delivery to include competition w i l l be important to 
enhanced service responsiveness. T h e Bank w i l l provide support to bu i ld a financial flow database to foster transparency and 
accountability between the center and local govemments.

Poor delivery o f health, nutrition, clean water and sanitation services contributes to 
poor health indicators, which represent a n impo r tan t p a r t o f multi-dimensional poverty in 

Indonesia. Indonesia’s high maternal m o r t a l i t y r a t i o (about 370 deaths pe r 100,000 l i v e births) i s

The Bank’s support w i l l be targeted to help build capacity w i th in the new

Th e Core Issue of Governance-Defining Selectivity 

38. 

Selectivity in the Bank’s activities and the volume o f Base case lending w i l l be 
determined b y opportunities to help improve governance. Investment needs in today’s 

Indonesia are vast, and the choice o f where to allocate Bank activities - and how much - w i l l be 
made on where there i s scope fo r achieving, demonstrating and mu l t ip ly ing governance 
improvements. Rather than proposing a set o f stand-alone governance and anti-corruption 
projects, these issues w i l l be central to a l l aspects o f the program. The entire lending and AAA 
program has been designed to 
foster 
transparency and accountability 
through 
two 
complementary approaches: (i) b y enhancing the demand f o r good governance through greater 
pub l ic participation in policy-malung and po l icy -mon i to r ing processes across different levels o f 
government, and (ii) b y strengthening the institutions that are accountable fo r implementing the 
impressive body o f laws to improve governance already passed during the Re fomas i period. In 
the cases where there i s willingness to reform, the Bank i s com ing in w i t h support. Where 
commitment i s s t i l l lacking, the Bank w i l l wa i t o n lending-thus the large Base case lending 
range (see para. 5 9 ) . The goal o f the program i s to help Indonesia address what m igh t be 
described as an increasing “accountability gap,” i.e. the perception that the tremendous gains in 
transparency and democratic competition since the f a l l o f the N ew Order have no t been matched 
b y genuine government accountability fo r demonstrable resu l ts in restoring in teg r i ty to the pub l ic 
sector and reducing corruption. This i s a very ambitious goal that w i l l on ly be implemented over 
the long term, but the Bank’s program i s designed to expand on ly in areas where support can be 
p rov ided f o r demonstrated momentum in reforms towards this goal. Indicators to be monitored 
are summarized in Table 5 .

C r e a t ing demand fo r good governance at the loca l level. At the loca l level, the Bank’s 

expanding C D D work, wh ich i s planned to reach more than 30,000 villages and urban 
communities across the country b y the end o f the CAS period, i s b u i l t around the principle o f 
le t t ing communities decide the bes t use o f development funds and g i v i n g them the power and 
s k i l l s to mon i to r their investments. Supporting AAA wo rk and extensive mon i to r ing efforts fo r 
such programs as KDP and the U rban Poverty Projects are designed to ensure that the lessons o f 
this participatory approach to investments “spill over” 
in to the broader decision-making 
processes at the community level. In the coming CAS period, the Bank w i l l take this demand- 
side approach up to the next leve l o f the system, through extensive interactions at the district and 
p rov inc ia l levels. B y encouraging pub l ic participation in the process o f choice and 
implementation, Bank projects are designed to foster genuine commun i ty ownership o f programs 
and, hence, stronger incentives fo r citizens to h o l d their district and p rov inc ia l governments 
accountable fo r honest and effective implementation o f those programs. S im i la r participatory 
mechanisms are integrated in to many o f the Bank’s sectoral operations, such as WSSLIC, 
WISMP, COREMAP , Catchment Protection, FEATI, and PHP, where the users o f the relevant 
services are extensively engaged in bo th decision-making and mon i to r ing o f investment 
programs. 

40. 

Suppo r t ing the mom en tum f o r r e f o r m a t the na t iona l level. The Bank w i l l continue to 

contribute to the development o f the Partnership fo r Governance Reform, a unique collaboration 
among c i v i l society, government, and mu l t ip le donors to promote a high p ro f i le “center o f 
excellence” on good governance through research, experimentation, capacity-building and 
advocacy. Beyond the Partnership, the Bank w i l l seek opportunities to collaborate w i t h a new 
range o f organizations w i t h i n c i v i l society that have generally been overlooked in previous 
years-the 
large professional and mass-based associations w i t h the membership and influence to 
build momentum fo r governance reforms. The national Islamic associations Nahd la tu l Ulama 
and Muhammadiyah-with 
nearly 60 m i l l i o n members between them-have 
shown a strong 
interest in using their extensive grass-roots networks, educational establishments, and national 
authority to promote governance reform. Business and trade associations, trade unions, and 
chambers o f commerce are also p rom is ing partners to help advance the governance agenda and 
enhance accountability through mon i to r ing p o l i c y outcomes, especially in the area o f the 
investment climate. A l l these efforts w i l l require the Bank to take a h ighe r p ro f i le in the po l icy 
dialogue on governance, wh ich i s planned through the addition o f focused p o l i c y notes, a 
quarterly publication fo r mon i to r ing development, and communications outreach to enhance the 
Bank’s traditional range o f longer term, in-depth research and diagnostic products.

Deve lop ing the inst itut ions o f good governance: f inanc ia l managemen t and the c iv i l 

service. A high p r io r i ty w i l l continue to be given to imp rov ing f inanc ia l management systems, 
bo th at the national leve l (through ongoing TA and a FY05 project t o support M i n i s t r y o f 
Finance reform) and through v i r tua l ly a l l o f our operations at the loca l level. Recent 
developments in internet technologies w i l l be taken in to account. C i v i l service re fo rm i s less 
advanced and l i k e l y to be delayed further during the upcoming election period. However, the 
Bank w i l l seek to strengthen our operational engagement on this i s s u e through support fo r a 
comprehensive restructuring o f the facu l ty and cu r r icu lum o f one o f the m a i n t ra in ing institutes 
fo r the c i v i l service-STPDN. This capacity-building project, wh ich i s cu r ren t ly under discussion, 
i s intended as an entry-point fo r strengthening the Bank’s wo rk in c i v i l service re fo rm after the

2004 elections. The Bank w i l l also emphasize support fo r loca l leve l experiments in 
implementing c i v i l service reform. 

42. 

Deve lop ing the inst itut ions o f good governance: the lega l system. The Government’s 

Economic Po l icy Package lays out a concrete timeframe fo r a number o f long-delayed 
ins t i tu t iona l reforms in the justice sector, inc lud ing the establishment o f the An t i -Co r rup t ion 
Commission and the Judicial Commission, and revision o f the law o n the Attorney General’s 
Office. The Bank w i l l incorporate these benchmarks i n t o i ts lending triggers and w i l l offer 
technical assistance and support to these institutions. M o r e broadly, the Supreme Court has 
launched the results o f a comprehensive blueprint to re fo rm a l l aspects o f the management o f the 
court system, inc lud ing jud ic ia l education, personnel and financial management o f courts, 
functioning o f the Judicial Commission and creation o f an An t i -Co r rup t ion Court. The ambitious 
blueprint was developed through an unusual collaboration between a c i v i l society organization- 
the Indonesian Ins t i tu te fo r an Independent Judiciary-and the leadership o f the Supreme Court. I t 
w i l l serve as an important mechanism for coordinating potential donor assistance in the justice 
sector. A t the same time, the Bank w i l l push fo rwa rd w i t h a new in i t ia t ive to enhance access to 
the justice system fo r communities and the poor. D raw ing lessons f r om a wide-ranging study o f 
corruption cases in the Bank’s C D D projects, this Justice fo r the Poor program w i l l seek to 
integrate in to the C D D po r t fo l io initiatives to strengthen alternative dispute resolution 
mechanisms, develop a network o f community paralegals and legal assistance, lowe r the 
geographical and f inanc ia l barriers to court access, and promote legal literacy. 

43. 

M e a su r ing and t r a c k ing results. A fundamental component o f imp rov ing accountability 
i s enhancing the capacity to measure resu l ts . The Bank has pioneered efforts to measure 
governance, and Indonesia w i l l continue to be an important country f o r implementing and 
expanding mon i to r ing techniques. The Governance and Decentralization Survey (GDS) f i rs t 
implemented in 2001 w i l l be repeated to compare governance outcomes at bo th the national leve l 
and in ind iv idua l districts w i t h a concentration o f Bank projects. An investment climate survey i s 
currently in the f i e l d and w i l l provide comparative data bo th w i t h i n Indonesia and across East 
Asia on the governance problems faced b y firms. A comprehensive program fo r mon i to r ing 
corruption in our community development program i s currently being implemented. Indonesia 
w i l l also become a focus fo r developing a broader system fo r pub l ic expenditure tracking at the 
loca l leve l to enhance accountability over pub l ic resources. The broad participation o f 
representatives o f c i v i l society in these mon i to r ing efforts w i l l be essential to their effectiveness 
and sustainability. The AAA program w i l l include a ma jo r e f fo r t to bring a l l o f these mon i to r ing 
efforts at the loca l leve l together in a h igh profile, easily accessible format that w i l l allow 
different users to track governance outcomes, inc lud ing impact o n services fo r the poor, across 
Indonesia’s diverse regions.

The key w i l l be to find, fo r each leve l o f government, mechanisms that w i l l ensure transparency 
o f resource use and accountability o f p o l i c y makers and service providers to users ( inc lud ing 
businesses large and small) and to build capacity f o r their use. 

45. 

T h e goa l i s to use W o r l d Bank suppo r ted pro jects , leve raged b y AAA , pa r tne rsh ips 
and capac ity building activities, to systematically increase standards o f governance a t each 
leve l o f gove rnmen t at wh ich w e w o r k so th a t w e h a v e an imp a c t o n pove r ty reduc t ion . This 

w i l l be done through agreeing upon standards-covering 
in fo rma t ion disclosure, participation, 
financial management, procurement, and expenditure planning, etc.-and 
a l low ing loca l 
governments to request participation in the project. This approach has already p roved h igh ly 
successful at the commun i ty level, and i s n ow pa r t icu la r ly important at the d is t r ic t level, where 
most loca l government spending authority n ow lies. lo Unde rp inn ing this approach t o our poverty 
reduction focus are tw o factors: the fact that there are the highest numbers o f poo r in the most 
densely populated areas o f the country (w i th in district inequalities are greater than across district 
inequalities; see Annex D); and the fact that so lv ing problems often requires governance reforms 
at several levels o f government, as illustrated in B o x 6 fo r Forestry. I t w i l l take some years 
before the ma jo r i ty o f the over 400 districts are able to raise their governance standards 
adequately, but the Bank believes that early investment and capacity building in those districts 
showing genuine willingness to change, w i l l help to create a groundswell o f reform. Fo r those 
districts no t included in this “early reformers” category the Bank wou ld continue to provide 
support through the C D D programs and ca re fu l ly supervised sectoral programs. The C D D 
approach w i l l be the instrument b y wh ich we can provide support wh i le further enhancing 
governance at the community leve l in poorer districts that are no t w e l l governed, inc lud ing such 
districts that may be in lagging regions o f the country. Fou r broad “platforms” are envisaged fo r 
the com ing CAS period. 

The Community Driven Development Platform: Scaling Up a Successful Program 

46. 

T h e pas t th ree years have seen a m a j o r advance in the design and successful 
imp lemen ta t ion o f CDD p rog rams in rural (KDP) and u r b a n (UPP) areas. The third KDP 

loadc red i t fo r $250 m i l l i o n was approved b y the Boa rd in June, and the Government has asked 
us to scale up the UPP program to a nationwide program in the current year (UPP3). These 
programs are effectively directing resources t o small-scale investments, iden t i f ied b y poor 
communities, to imp rove their own livelihoods. A l though the first funds under these projects 
were committed as recently as 1998, when Indonesia was s t i l l ree l ing f r om the economic crisis, 
the outputs and outcomes to date are already impressive.” Field surveys and external 
independent evaluations done in connection w i t h one o f the programs, KDP, have a l l pointed to: 
greater community participation in the planning, decision-making and use o f development funds, 
especially fo r women and poorer villagers; high economic rates o f return fo r small-scale 
infrastructure; imp roved access to quality infrastructure and to neighboring villages, loca l 
markets, schools and other pub l ic facilities across every income spectrum f o r villagers; opening

In the com ing CAS pe r iod the B a n k p lans to invest a round $200 m i l l ion p e r year in 

this p rom is ing p rog ram . A deepening o f the program in the com ing three years i s expected to 
see (i) stronger links w i t h the private sector; (ii) establishment o f a stronger legal basis fo r the 
model, to ensure sustainability; (iii) the use o f this approach to address needs o f specific 
communities-such as in con f l ic t affected areas, forests and coastal communities; and (iv) even 
greater emphasis on M&E systems. Moreover, the Government i s most interested in large-scale 
programs wh ich wo rk to reduce poverty. Emphasis w i l l also be g iven to building accountability 
links “upward” t o the district level.

at the District and Provincial Leve l 

48. 

As a resu l t o f the decentra l izat ion o f 2001, the m a i n deve lopment challenges def ined 
in this CAS h a v e become, to a la rge extent, challenges at the d is t r ic t level. Decentralization 

has passed the bulk o f authority, responsibility, and pub l ic funding fo r services to district 
governments. Advancing reforms in these areas, as w e l l as bu i ld ing momentum fo r imp rov ing 
governance, w i l l require substantial engagement w i t h district, and in some cases p rov inc ia l 
governments. B u t w i t h over 400 districts and tremendous variation as to their capacity, their 
commitment to re fo rm and their governance environment, the Bank requires a strategic 
framework f o r assistance at this level. Over the past tw o years the Bank has invested heavily- 
through district-focused sectoral projects, as w e l l as through AAA and Trust Funded TA-in 
analyzing capacity and constraints, and in p i lo t ing appropriate mechanisms fo r service planning 
and financing, as w e l l as, higher standards o f client responsiveness and transparency at the 
district (and p rov inc ia l ) level. In the coming CAS period, we expect to build upon this 
knowledge base as more development assistance i s channeled d i rec t ly to the district level, 
through continued sectoral projects but increasingly through a broader loca l services platform.

T h e loca l services p l a t f o rm i s built a round f o u r k e y pr inc ip les: 

D e f in e selection c r i t e r i a to de te rm ine levels o f B a n k engagement w i t h districts 
based o n c lea r standards o f governance re fo rm . In this CAS period, the Bank w i l l 

launch tw o loca l governance projects ( fo r ru ra l and urban localities, respectively) that are 
designed to eventually set the framework fo r our loca l leve l assistance. These projects- 
ILGRP and USDRP-are structured to select districts w i t h a demonstrated commitment 
to an agenda o f governance reforms and then to assist those districts in reaching 
governance standards along w i t h investments in their ow n development and poverty 
alleviation objectives. D is t r ic ts w i l l compete to gain entry i n t o these projects through 
their o w n programs o f governance reform. These programs w i l l cover in fo rma t ion 
transparency, participation, financial management, procurement, inc lud ing p i lo ts in 
using electronic systems, and pro-poor pub l ic expenditure management. E x i t criteria w i l l 
also be established to encourage sustainable r e f o rm efforts. The projects w i l l eventually 
serve as the Bank’s ma in mechanism fo r selecting districts fo r potential long-term 
relationships.

solutions. The po r t fo l io i s spread geographically across many islands in loca l communities w i t h 
w ide ly different levels o f development and project implementation capacities. Moreover, many 
o f our projects are multi-sectoral, generating additional complexities. Fo r effective supervision in 
this context, each project needs to have clear benchmarks and performance criteria to permit a 
h igh degree o f self-supervision o f input use and outcomes. Our experience w i t h C D D projects 
shows that supervision can be built i n t o projects b y empowering consultants and facilitators to 
iden t i fy implementation problems as they arise and to assist the executing agencies in resolving 
them. The p la t fo rm approach holds out the poss ib i l i ty that Bank teams cou ld supervise broader 
po r t fo l ios o f projects in specific regions. Supervision w i l l engage other donors, NGOs, and loca l 
agencies. The Bank i s also planning to open regional satellite offices ( in i t ia l ly in conjunction

building activities.

around $230 million. (See Annex B3). This leve l i s w e l l below lend ing during the 1990s, 
wh ich averaged $1.3 b i l l ion , but higher than the Base case o f the last CAS, wh ich was set at 
$400 m i l l ion . Under the last CAS, however, Indonesia has now b road ly achieved the H i g h case 
triggers, and wou ld thus be e l ig ib le fo r $ 1 b i l l i o n lending per year. The proposed Base case 
wou ld include a higher FY04 -07 IDA allocation o f SDRSOO m i l l i o n and assumes continued IDA 
access beyond IDA 13. Access to potentially higher bo r row ing in the Base case, inc lud ing more 
IDA, reflects progress in macroeconomic stability and structural reforms, and overty strategy 
preparation, as w e l l as large f inanc ing needs and continued weak credit ratings. Ac tua l lending 
amounts wou ld depend p r ima r i ly on progress in bu i ld ing the loca l services platform, how 
qu ick ly loca l governments are w i l l i n g and able to take up reforms, and the ab i l i ty to prepare h igh 
qua l i ty operations in a t ime ly manner. I f reforms and capacity building move more slowly, 
lending levels wou ld be toward the bo t tom end o f the range. 

60. 
The Base case i s premised on continued but incremental reforms tha t lead to 
gradual improvements in governance and the investment climate. Under this scenario 

Indonesia wou ld remain po l i t ica l ly stable through the elections and the transition to a new 
Government. The country w o u l d make gradual, although no t always linear, progress in key 
areas, preparing Indonesia fo r higher g row th in the fo l low ing CAS period. Greater attention to 
governance programs in select districts, accompanied b y modest improvements at the national 
leve l in l i n e w i t h the Economic Po l icy Package, wou ld be reflected in pockets o f improvement in 
service delivery, a moderately imp roved investment climate, leading to s l igh t ly higher 
investment rates, wh ich in turn wou ld (barring external shocks) cause GDP to grow at 4-5 
percent annually, and enable poverty to f a l l f r om 16 percent in 2002 to 12 percent in 2007. This 
scenario also envisions 
Indonesia maintaining macro-stability, 
increasing development 
expenditures gradually, wh i le meeting fiscal targets l a i d out in the State Finances L aw and 
lowe r ing i ts debt-to-GDP be low 60 percent b y end 2006 (see Table 9 ) . 

61. 
I n the event o f sharply accelerated reform, H i g h case lending o f up to $1.4 billion 
pe r year i s proposed, o f which I D A would account fo r around $365 million. This case wou ld 

require strong measures in the areas o f governance and the investment climate that wou ld result 
in a more immediate resumption o f higher g row th rates and more decisive action and resu l ts in 
reducing poverty. Table 9 presents the framework wh ich w i l l be used t o determine achievement 
o f the H i g h case. The ind ica t ive measures (in parentheses) describe the types o f measures that 
w i l l be used to gauge performance. Quantitative indicators f r om data sources l is ted in the note to 
Table 9 w i l l also be used to assess progress. A l l o f the indicative measures fo r the High case are 
drawn f r om the Government’s new Economic Po l icy Package. Under this case, GDP g row th rate 
i s l i k e l y to r i s e gradually to 6 percent b y the end o f the CAS pe r iod and poverty headcount rates 
cou ld f a l l to 10 percent in 2007 -- lowe r than pre-crisis levels. Annex B 3 presents an indicative 
lending program under the High case. Add i t iona l support wou ld be p rov ided in two broad 
areas -- infrastructure and economic reform. Infrastructure constraints w i l l become even more

Nevertheless, the country’s r a t i n g i s s t i l l several discrete grades be low minimum inves tmen t grade.

I n response to the Government ’s request, a policy-based p r o g r a m l o a n suppo r t ing 
the Government ’s r e f o r m p r o g r am i s proposed f o r the first half o f FY05. Over the next 18

w i l l requ i re a track record o f sustained p o l i c y improvement, wou ld be reached until late FY 0 5 or

Base case situation, requiring systematic implementation o f the Government’s po l icy package 
over the com ing year, particularly in the areas o f imp rov ing the investment climate and 
strengthening pub l ic procurement and financial management. The single tranche operation o f

Bo x 8: F idu c i a r y Env i ronmen t : Progress and N e x t Steps 

Fiduciary core diagnostic reports on procurement (CPAR) and financial management (CFAA) were completed for Indonesia in 
2001. W h i l e these reports highlighted major weaknesses in the public procurement system and overall fiduciary environment, 
progress has been made in several areas. In particular, the CPAR recommended reform o f the legal framework and 
organizational structure for procurement. T h e CFAA called for reform o f the legal framework to anchor future reforms in 
public financial management, greater clarity in the roles and responsibilities o f key players in the budget process, and 
strengthening o f audit functions. Several important actions in these areas have been completed to date: 
A draft Presidential Decree revising the existing Keppres 18/2000 has been prepared and i s now awaiting presidential 
approval. I t w i l l establish a new procurement framework that i s more consistent w i th intemational public procurement 
practices. Establishment o f a National Public Procurement Office, professional certification, and wider competition are 
key features o f this draft decree 
A draft procurement law has been prepared which provides clarity on procurement policies and procedures and strong 
enforcement mechanisms 
Procurement training modules for intemational and national competitive bidding procedures have been prepared by the 
Govemment to develop professional procurement expertise 
A pilot e-procurement system i s being prepared by the Govemment 
Laws on state finances, treasury and audit have been drafted. T h e new state f inance law, which was passed by 
Parliament in March 2003, reforms public accountability mechanisms. Passage o f the remaining two laws and issuance 
o f the implementing regulations for a l l three w i l l consolidate reforms in t h i s area 
T h e mandate o f BPK (Supreme Audit Board) has been strengthened by the new finance law and constitutional 
amendments, and BPK continues to be modemized through an Institutional Development Plan supported by the Bank 
T h e Govemment has formulated a Public Sector Accounting Board to help develop and implement new and modem 
accounting standards. A n initial set o f th ree draft standards and a strategy for introducing these nation-wide have been 
prepared 
Fundamental for further progress on the fiduciary environment w i l l be quick and cumulative reform actions on the legal and 
institutional aspects o f the procurement and financial management systems, supported by capacity building for people involved 
in implementing these reforms. In procurement, operationalizing the NPPO, certification o f staff handling procurement, and 
progress in the procurement law could signify b ig changes in procurement practices i n the near te rm . 

f a l l f r om about 5.1 percent in 2003 to 1.6 percent in 2012 (see Figure 4). Even under the High 
case, net disbursements ( f rom IBRD and IDA combined) w o u l d s t i l l remain negative through 
FY09 and IBRD outstanding loans wou ld decline to around $6.5 b i l l i o n b y FY07. In addition, 
even under modest macroeconomic assumptions that take in to account ove ra l l external financing 
requirements over the l o n g te rm , the total external debt to GDP ra t io i s projected to continue to 
f a l l steadily, assuming present policies (see Figure 4). 

64. 

L ow case lending o f less than $300 m i l l ion pe r year would be appropriate in the 
event that progress on policy r e fo rm stalls, o r if there i s back-tracking on performance. The 

L o w case w o u l d include an FY04-06 I D A allocation o f SDR300 m i l l i o n and also assumes 
continued access beyond IDA13. The L o w case i s one in wh ich the Government fails to make 
progress in imp rov ing governance and the investment climate, resulting in a failure o f 
confidence, deteriorating o r stagnant service delivery, and an increase in poverty. This wou ld 
materialize, fo r example, i f populist pressures resulted in serious back-tracking o n key reforms 
already undertaken, such as in the areas o f fiduciary management. Such pressures, wh ich lead to 
a weakening o f fiscal, monetary, and financial discipline, w o u l d l i k e l y b r ing about 
macroeconomic ins tab i l i ty o r a broader crisis. Back-tracking on policies that w o u l d directly harm 
the poor, such as protectionist trade policies, cou ld also precipitate the L o w case. In a l o w case 
environment the Bank w o u l d ta i lo r i t s response to developments and opportunities. Lend ing 
wou ld focus on CDD programs and other direct poverty reduction and social service 
interventions that show promise.

MACROECONOM IC PERFORMANCE DURING THE LAST C A S 

M o d e r a t e g r o w t h in 2000-2002. Indonesia’s average annual g r ow t h ra te during 2000- 
2002 was 4 percent. A l t h o u g h inves tmen t g rew s t rong ly in 2000, the resump t ion was 
short-lived. Consump t ion was the m a i n engine o f growth, and p r iva te consump t ion was

period, debt outstanding increased b y $6 b i l l i o n , w h i l e n om i n a l GDP increased b y $23 
b i l l i o n . In 2000-2002, the primary balance was w e l l above 3 percent o f GDP o n average,

w h i c h m a y have con t r ibu ted $1.0-1.5 b i l l i o n pe r annum t o balance o f payments. In

POVERTY PROFILE 
AND ANALYTICAL AGENDA 

POVERTY PROFILE 

Indonesia has made rema rkab le progress in reducing expenditure poverty in 
recovering f rom its economic crisis but has not yet brought poverty down to pre- 

c r is is levels. Whereas g r ow t h h a d assisted Indonesia in bringing i t s p o v e r t y headcount 
index d ow n f r o m 6 0 percent in 1970 t o 15.7 percent in 1996, the econom ic c r is is resu l ted 
in expenditure pove r ty rates exp lod ing t o 27 percent b y 1999. Since then, the success in 
macroeconomic s tab i l iza t ion - by bringing i n f l a t i o n and the exchange ra te unde r con t ro l 
- has unde rp inned Indonesia’s success in l ow e r i n g i t s expenditure p o v e r t y rate t o 16 
percent b y 2002. Maintaining macro-stability and generating faster growth through an 
improved investment climate are critical to poverty reduction in Indonesia. 

But poverty i s multidimensional, and looking beyond expenditure poverty shows 
tha t the problems o f poverty a re serious in Indonesia and a re compounded by poor 

service delivery. Indeed i f one considers access t o basic health, education, water, and 
sanitation services (e.g. as measured b y births attended by t rad i t iona l healers, c h i l d 
en ro l lmen t , household access t o sanitation and t o water), imp rovemen ts have been s low . 
These are also re f lec ted in p o o r MDG outcomes, pa r t icu la r ly in hea l th (see Tab le 1 and as 
discussed in the text), re la t ive t o countries w i t h i n the region. W om e n in pa r t icu la r su f fe r 
p rob lems o f access t o qua l i ty services and bear the consequences: Indones ia ’s ma te rna l 
m o r t a l i t y rate i s t w o t imes greater than the Ph i l ipp ines and f i v e t imes greater than 
V ie tnam . Mo reove r , even many expenditure non -poo r households are dep r ived in terms 
o f access t o basic services as de f ined above. I f l a c k o f access t o each o f the above 
services i s seen as a separate d imens ion o f pove r ty , as m a n y as 53 percent o f Indonesians 
w o u l d be de f ined as p o o r o n the basis o f at least one such d imens ion o f pove r ty . In other 
words, p o o r service de l ive ry i s f a i l i n g the expenditure poo r and i s i t s e l f also the cause o f 
pove r ty and dep r iva t ion in Indonesia. T h e p rob lems o f the p o o r are n o t l i m i t e d t o the 
p rob lems o f generating income . T rad i t iona l attempts at targeted i n c om e transfers o r 
r e l y i n g o n l y o n expand ing access t o c red i t w i l l n o t solve these problems. Directed efforts 
to improve the delivery of basic services must thus be a critical facet of any effort to 
reduce multidimensional poverty in Indonesia. 

The national headcount index masks wide disparities and variations in poverty 

incidence rates across the country. W h i l e the pove r ty rates are 15.7 percent and 4 
percent o n Java and B a l i , the Eastern Is lands lag, with pove r ty rates o f 36.8 percent. T h e 
severity o f pove r ty i s s im i l a r l y m o r e serious in the Eastern Is lands in general, w i t h the 
dep th o f pove r ty at 7.8 percent in NTT/NTB re la t ive t o 2.5 percent in Java and B a l i . T h e 
story o n reg iona l disparities and l a g g i n g reg ions i s tempered b y several add i t iona l facts. 
First, the recove ry f r o m the c r is is in terms o f expenditure pove r ty appears t o have 
bene f i ted almost a l l regions: indeed a l l but one p rov ince captured in the 2002 househo ld 
survey saw an imp rovemen t in pove r ty rates, i n c l u d i n g s t rong recoveries f r o m some 
reg ions in the East. Second, despite reg iona l disparities, 7 8 percent o f Indonesia’s 
expenditure poo r l i v e in Java, B a l i , and Sumatra. Third, reg iona l mu l t id imens iona l

mu l t id imens iona l , non-expenditure pove r ty measures. Addressing poverty in Indonesia 
w i l l not only require efforts of bringing along the lagging regions but importantly also 
addressing poverty among the poor in non-lagging regions. 

Th e r e a r e key rural a n d urban dimensions to Indones ia ’s pove r ty . M o s t o f 

Indonesia’s p o o r (78 percent) l i v e in r u r a l areas. He re a no tewo r thy fac t i s that whereas 
65 percent o f p o o r households are agricultural, o n l y 50 percent o f the i r income i s f r o m 
fa rm ing and 8 percent f r o m ag r icu l tu re wage wo rk . Sm a l l landho ld ings and lags in 
p r o d u c t i v i t y increases means that o f f - f a rm r u r a l income sources are inc reas ing ly 
impo r tan t f o r these poo r . W h i l e 22 percent o f the p o o r l i v e in u rban areas, this represents 
7.6 m i l l i o n people. T h e p rob lems o f u rban pove r ty are l a r g e l y shaped by unemp loymen t . 
Ma le , fema le and even you th unemp loymen t rates are indeed m u c h la rge r in u rban areas. 
M a l e unemp loymen t rate among the poo r in u rban areas, at 7.7 percent, i s mo re than 
three times the ra te in r u r a l areas. The female unemp loymen t rate, at 9.4 percent among 
the poo r in u rban areas, i s almost tw ice the r u r a l rate. Poverty reduction efforts must 
necessarily focus on the dual dimensions of urban and ru ra l poverty in Indonesia, with 
an emphasis on creating economic opportunities and jobs, including offifarm 
income 
opportunities in ru ra l areas. 

A n impo r t an t cha rac te r is t ic o f pove r ty in Indones ia i s vu lne rab i l i ty to shock. The 

vu lne rab i l i ty t o f a l l i n g i n t o pove r ty among many Indones ian households i s simply 
re f lec ted in the c lus te r ing o f a la rge share o f households just above the income pove r ty 
l ine . This phenomenon i s re f lec ted by the fac t that 7.4 percent o f Indonesians f a l l under 
the dollar-a-day pove r ty l i n e whereas 53.4 percent f a l l unde r the t w o dollars-a-day 
pove r ty l ine . (The na t iona l pove r ty l i n e i s cu r ren t ly app rox ima te ly 1.5 dollars a day.) 
Ana lys is has shown that the p o o r are vulnerable t o a series o f shocks, mos t impo r tan t o f 
w h i c h are p r i c e shocks t o the i r consump t ion bund le (and pa r t icu la r ly t o rice, the m a i n 
staple o f the poor), catastrophic i l lness o f househo ld members, and c rop failure. In 
addition, ongo ing analysis shows that an impo r tan t source o f vu lne rab i l i ty among 
Indones ian households i s c o n f l i c t and re la ted insecu r i ty - in m a n y reg ions throughout the 
country. Gender vu lne rab i l i ty i s also a k e y issue. Females, even though h a v i n g s i m i l a r 
jobs w i t h s i m i l a r educa t ion levels, o n average earn less and have m o r e d i f f i c u l t y in 
securing good jobs, regardless o f sector and l e v e l o f education. Reducing vulnerability of 
households to poverty w i l l mean lifting more people further above the poverty line 
through growth, mitigating the sources of vulnerability such as conflict and natural 
disasters, and enhancing informal and formal coping mechanisms for households, 
including through well targeted safety net programs.

POVERTY ANALYSIS 

Background 

Indones ia has a w e l l developed system o f surveys t o m o n i t o r pove r ty but these are 
unde ru t i l ized t o address p o l i c y issues. The re i s n o shortage o f data o n poverty.’ T h e data

analysis are eminent, such as: W h a t p o l i c y in te rven t ions w i l l he lp raise the re tu rn t o the 
assets, opportunities, and incomes o f the poo r? In the con tex t o f decentralization, h o w 
can the a b i l i t y o f l o c a l governments be enhanced t o reach the poo r? W h a t measures w i l l 
increase the vo ice o f people so that p u b l i c and p r iva te services are made m o r e

Bank Poverty Assessment dates back to 2001.* This report emphasized tw o themes that 
defined the needs fo r a new kind o f pove r ty strategy. First, poverty definitions need to be 
redeveloped to acknowledge the broader, multidimensional, more dynamic rea l i ty o f 
poverty. Second, Indonesia needs a pove r ty strategy consistent w i t h an empowered 
populace and democratic po l icymak ing mechanism through acknowledging that the 
poverty agenda i s a governance agenda. 

INDOPOV : A Poverty Ana lys is P rog ram to Support t h i s CAS 

Over this CAS period, the W o r l d Bank i s seeking to strengthen the analysis o f poverty in 
Indonesia through the Indonesia Poverty Analysis Program ( INDOPOV ) . This i s a three 
year program o f analytical, p o l i c y and operational wo rk on poverty designed to feed in to 
and support the Government o f Indonesia in the preparation and implementation o f i t s 
Poverty Reduction Strategy, as w e l l as to enhance the poverty focus o f wo rk w i t h i n the 
W o r l d Bank in Indonesia. In partnership w i t h others, this program w i l l seek to address 
key gaps 
in poverty analysis in Indonesia currently. 
I N D O P O V w i l l adopt a 
programmatic approach focusing on fou r key themes, aligned w i t h b o t h the CAS and the 
themes chosen b y the Govenment fo r the preparation o f the PRSP. These themes are: 

Poverty analysis and p o l i c y linkages-which 
w i l l undertake h igh quality 
analytical wo rk on poverty and vulnerability, broaden the p o l i c y debate on 
poverty issues, and imp rove capacity fo r mon i to r ing and evaluation. 

Creating a p ro -poo r investment climate-which w i l l analyze linkages between 
macroeconomic p o l i c y and poverty, quantify the constraints to pro-poor g row th at 
the loca l level, promote a better understanding o f the impac t o f labor market 
regulation on employment creation, and help to develop strategies fo r ou t ly ing 
and lagging regions. 

M a k i n g services wo rk for 
t h e poor-which 
w i l l seek to understand the 
determinants o f poo r development outcomes, strengthen client-provider 
relationships, and explore how pub l ic spending can be made more effective in 
three sectors, education, health and water and sanitation. In add i t ion there w i l l be 
a special program o f w o r k on social protection services. 

Governance and pove r ty - wh ich w i l l focus on l i n k i n g p lann ing and budgeting to 
poverty, understanding the determinants o f pro-poor change, and determining the 
poverty payo f f o f specific governance reforms. 

A m ix tu re o f qualitative and quantitative tools w i l l be used, d raw ing o n the many r i c h 
sources o f data in Indonesia mentioned above. In each area the w o r k w i l l be closely 
integrated w i t h po l icy and operational work. Coalitions o f partners w i l l be built around 
the wo rk program and the results w i l l feed in to the ongoing po l icy dialogue in each area.

ANNEX E: SUMMARY OF CAS CONSULTATIONS 

Several methods were used t o e l i c i t input t o the C A S f r o m about 400 c i v i l society

Ove r the years, r a p i d economic g r ow t h has p a i d r i c h dividends t o Indonesians; howeve r i t

W h i l e there are some s ign i f ican t achievements in p o l l u t i o n management in 
Indonesia, such as the phase-out o f lead in gasoline in Jakarta and the reduc t ion in

widespread con tam ina t ion o f surface and groundwater in u rban ized areas, w h i c h

H igh rates o f deforestation are d r i v e n by excessive capac i ty in the w o o d

thanks t o the Government’s acknow ledgmen t o f the serious na tu re o f the forest 
problems, progress o n the g round has been insu f f ic ien t t o stem the ra te o f forest

Howeve r , i t i s expe r ienc ing a dramatic loss in na tu ra l habitats, and i s doubtless

Mining and m i n e r a l re la ted products account f o r about 13 percent o f Indones ia 
GDP and 19 percent t o t a l exports, w i t h g o l d be ing the largest revenue earner. O f

o f the challenge that Indones ia faces in pursuing sustainable g r ow t h and pove r ty 
alleviation, embedded in a l l three pillars o f i t s assistance strategy. 

P i l l a r 1: Im p r o v i n g the investment climate. Three m a i n issues are re levan t : (i) Support 

t o macroeconomic s tab i l i ty , and trade p o l i c y spec i f ica l ly , w i l l need t o take i n t o account 
the r o l e o f the fo res t ry sector, w h i c h represents 10% o f the coun t ry ’s t o t a l exports. 
Unde r - repo r t ing and ine f fec t ive co l lec t ion o f resource fees in the sector and ine f fec t ive 
management o f the Re fo res ta t ion Fund are fu r the r concerns f r o m a f isca l standpoint; (ii) 
One o f the p re -cond i t ions f o r increasing p r iva te sector inves tmen t a n d p romo t ing 
competitiveness i s c l a r i t y o f regulations and the i r consistent, p red ic tab le enforcement. 
Env i ronmen t i s thus one o f the m a n y dimensions o f the p roposed re fo rms o f the jus t ice 
sector, c i v i l service, and f inanc ia l management ins t i tu t ions ; and (iii) P romo t ion o f 
p roduc t ive inves tmen t in r u r a l areas m a y inc lude c omm u n i t y fo res t ry and watershed

services. T h e above po in ts w i l l be dealt w i t h th rough ma ins t ream ing in AAA, TA and 
lend ing operations. 

P i l l a r 2: Im p r o v i n g services f o r the poor . Env i ronmen ta l concerns w i l l b e dealt w i t h o n 
three fronts: (i) ensu r ing that p ro jec t impacts are m i n im i z e d and that e f fec t ive m i t i g a t i o n 
and compensation measures are built i n t o p ro jec t des ign ( th rough the safeguards 
process); (ii) e x p l o r i n g synergies in p ro jec t design (as in the use o f ca rbon finance o r 
GEF funds associated w i t h ag r icu l tu re and energy p ro jec ts t o reduce greenhouse gas 
emissions o r t o p romo te b iod ive rs i ty protection); and (iii) enhancing ins t i tu t iona l capacity 
in sectors and p rov inces where inves tmen t i s concentrated. T h e use o f strategic 
env i ronmen ta l assessment (either sectoral o r reg iona l ) can g rea t ly fac i l i ta te the p lann ing 
process and reduce transaction costs associated t o p ro jec t preparation. Spec i f ica l ly 
ma ins t ream ing w i l l b e p romo ted through: (i) USDRP, in connec t ion w i th expansion o f 
sewerage systems; (ii) ICGRP , in connection w i t h the p ro tec t ion o f headwaters; and (iii) 
roads and energy projects. 

Pillar 3: Im p r o v i n g governance. T h e Gove rnmen t has p i l o t e d i n f o rm a t i o n disclosure in 
the env i ronmen ta l f i e l d th rough the PROPER Program, focus ing o n wa te r p o l l u t i o n in

decentralization, the Ministry o f Env i ronmen t also faces the challenge o f c l a r i f y i n g

MIGA w i l l support the GO I ’s efforts to reenergize privatization, comb in ing the agency’s 
expertise in investor outreach and targeting and i t s in fo rma t ion services products w i t h i n -

Based o n MIGA’s experience under the M iyazawa Initiative, MIGA intends to provide 
Capacity B u i l d i n g support in the area o f aftercare to B U M , the country’s investment 
p romo t ion agency, to a l low i t to help meet the needs o f existing investors and facilitate 
expansions and reinvestments. This wo rk w i l l be provided in a regional context, 
beginning FY04-05. 

Once suitable partners are 
identified, MIGA i s also proposing to undertake a 
comprehensive focused Benchmarking Study o f Indonesia. The p r ima ry objective o f the 
Benchmarking Study wou ld be to analyze the competitiveness o f several sectors in 
Indonesia in t e rm s o f their ab i l i ty to attract FDI. 

The output cou ld then be used in the short term to see how the various locations compare 
in terms o f costs and conditions and in terms o f industry attractiveness. This wou ld 
enable investment p romo t ion intermediaries to focus their p romo t ion efforts and 
subsequent location recommendations according to the strengths o f a community, help 
them address location weaknesses, 
improve their knowledge o f industry-specific 
investment criteria, help them better understand the concept o f niche opportunities, and 
help determine why some disinvestment i s talung place, the understanding o f a l l o f wh ich 
i s necessary to ensure long-term sustained competitiveness.
