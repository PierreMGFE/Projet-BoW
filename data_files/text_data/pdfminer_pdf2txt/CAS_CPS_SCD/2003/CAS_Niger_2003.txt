Executive Summary

i. 
Background. Niger, one of the world's poorest countries, has made considerable
progress towards macroeconomic stability and growth smce the return of democratic governance
in late 1999. Yet the reform agenda remains vast and poverty widespread. Niger's prospects are
clouded by a lack of natural resources and a highly degraded natural environment, explosive
population growth, extremely low human and institutional capacity, very limited mternational
competitiveness, 
its location m a potentially volatile sub-regional context, uncertain donor
commitment, and years of poor governance. These factors contribute to the extreme vulnerability
of poor Nigeriens, particularly women and children.

ii. 

With improved macroeconomic performance over the past few years, Niger has benefited
from increased flows of donor support, as well as interim debt relief since the Enhanced HIPC
Decision Point of December 2000. In addition, Niger will benefit significantly from grants under
IDA 13 arrangements. Nonetheless, resource flows are limited by contmued donor concerns
about stability and absorptive capacity, as well as by HlPC-related constraints on Niger's ability
to borrow. Thus Niger's central challenge is to achieve the ambitious program of economic and
social transformation set forth in its PRSP by maximizing the effectiveness of development
assistance and public resources.

iii. 
The Government's program. Niger's Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP)
provides a framework for implementing sectoral strategies that seek to achieve significant
progress towards 
the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The PRSP provides an
uncompromising analysis of poverty and its underlying causes, and sets forth a national
development program around four central pillars:

* A macroeconomic framrework ensuring economic and financial stability while promoting
sustainable and robust growth;
* The development of productive sectors, especially .in rural areas, to mitigate vulnerability
and stimulate income generation;
* The improvement in the access of the poor to quality social services, including basic
education, primary health care, reproductive health services, HIV/AIDS prevention,
water and sanitation, and adequate urban habitat; and
* The strengthening of institutional and mdividual capacity within and outside
Govemment, at the central and local level.

iv. 
In addition, three cross-cutting themes are identified as guides to policy formulation m
all sectors:

* The effective inclusion of gender considerations;
* The promotion of good govemance; and
* The redefinition of stakeholders' role in the implementation of policies, startmg with the
state.

v. 
The PRSP proposes several ways of dealing with Niger's difficult external
environment and human vulnerability. To address the vulnerability of Niger's poorest citizens

- ii -

to repeated drought and famine, 
it identifies rural development, and particularly 
irrigated
agriculture as top priorities along with improved development and maintenance of transport
infrastructure that connects the rural poor with markets. To address capacity and governance
issues, the PRSP emphasizes measures to improve capacity for;delivery of basic services, and
notes in particular the importance of building capacity for the decentralizatlon process. To
counter the risk of macroeconomic instability, the PRSP emphasizes disciplmed management of
public finances as well as the search for new sources of growth to reduce the volatility associated
with past reliance on uranium. 
In response to the risk of economic deterioration at the sub-
regional level, the PRSP calls for Niger's full participation m regional organizations, such as the
West African Economic and Monetary Union, and initiatives, such as NEPAD, that underpin
regional economic integration. And with regard to the risk of continued lack of donor resources
and coordination, the PRSP seeks to establish a framework for unifying donors, under Nigerien
leadership, around strategies that constitute the blueprints for action in the prionty sectors
identified in the PRSP.

vi. 
The Bank's program for Niger will be fully aligned with the PRSP. 
In order to
maximize its development impact, the Bank's assistance to Niger will seek to underpin and
enhance national ownership and leadership. A cntical challenge will be to bring about a
progressive shift towards consolidated programmatic lending, requiring significant changes m the
ways both the government and donors, including the Bank, do business. Key steps toward
meeting this challenge will be an emphasis on buildmg the govemment's capacity to plan and
manage development programs (including significantly strengthening the fiduciary framework),
and its coordination of donor activities by building consensus around sectoral strategies and
expenditure programs. The Bank will seek gradually to shift the bulk of its support from retail
investment projects towards consolidated programmatic support, with the Poverty Reduction
Support Credit (PRSC) as the preferred lending instrument.

vii. 
IDA lending and debt sustainability. The FY03-05 base-case scenario provides for a
maximum of US$238 million, Niger's current IDA allocation. Simulations conducted for the
CAS suggest that in the absence of a major external shock this level of lending would not result in
a significant deterioration of debt sustainability indicators. However they also suggest that in the
event of such a shock and resulting detenoration (despite base case performance), the Bank
would need to reduce lending substantially while approaching donors for increased grant funding.
In light of the high sensitivity of the debt sustainability indicators to cyclical changes in export
performance, however, it would not be advisable to rigidly link lending levels to them. Rather
the Bank would plan base case lending up to US$238 million, while monitoring Niger's debt
sustainability indicators annually. Appropriate adjustments to the base case lending program
would be made at the mid-point of the CAS period in the event that the NPV of Niger's debt-to-
exports ratio exceeds 200 percent.

viii. 
Lending program. The base case lending program would consist of 1-2 projects per
year as well as adjustment lending in support of the PRSP. Macroeconomic stability and growth
will be supported via adjustment lending, continued support for pnvatization, agro-pastoral
export promotion, and financial sector reform. The portfolio will emphasize 
reducing the
vulnerability of Niger's poor, promoting rural development, and provision of basic social
services, with particular attention to gender equity. The transition towards use of PRSCs will be
facilitated by Public Expenditure Adjustment Credits (PEACs). that continue building capacity for
fiscal management at both central and decentralized levels of Govemment, and by investment
operations that build capacity within specific sectors, spanning public, private and community
organizations.

- iii -

ix. 
In a low case scenario, resultng from poor policy or implementation performance,
commitments would not exceed US$ 100 million, and program emphasis would focus on social
services. The high case scenario, resulting from a superior level of performance, would be up to
US$260 million. There is thus little difference between the base and high case levels of IDA
commitments; the Bank will therefore also respond to better than expected performance by the
acceleration of programmatic financing via PRSCs (i.e. via a larger share of IDA financing
channeled through PRSCs at a faster pace than under the base case).

x. 
Non-lending program. The Bank's non-lending program will contribute to Niger's
ability to attain the PRSP's objectives, underpinning lending operations and providing Important
policy advice. Recent Bank economic and sector work (ESW) -
in particular the Participatory
Poverty Assessment - directly supported the PRSP and informed the strategic priorities of this
CAS. Further ESW is planned to help the government design policy responses to issues raised in
the Jomt Staff Assessment of the PRSP, for example on gender and population. 
In addition to
formal ESW, some sector studies - mcluding transport and rural development - will be
undertaken in the context of project preparation or implementation. Core 'diagnostic ESW is also
planned, including a Poverty Analysis, a Development Policy Review, a Public Expenditure
Review / CFAA, and a CPAR.

xi. 
CAS risks. CAS implementation faces five main risks- (i) reform slippage; (ii) a return
to poor governance practices; (ill) an inability to mobilize domestic and extemal support; (iv)
poor implementation progress; and (v) drought. The Bank seeks to mitigate these risks with
support for the PRSP reform program, focusing on transparency and accountability, embedding
capacity building in all Bank operations, and using a mix of adjustment and investment
operations (including in education, health, and rural development) both to support reforms and to
build admmistrative and service delivery capacity.

xii. 

The following four issues are suggested for Board discussion:

* Poverty reduction: Does the proposed Bank program adequately support the goals of the

PRSP?

* Debt sustainability:- Do Directors agree that an IDA base case lending program of up to
US$238 million be pursued while being prepared to adjust lending levels downward m
the event of a major deterioration in Niger's debt sustamability indicators ?
* Addressing vulnerability: Is the proposed program of adjustment and investment support
the most effective contribution the Bank can make toward helping Niger overcome the
constraints of its operational context as well as the human vulnerabilities that it creates?
* Transition to programmatic lending: 
Is the proposed phasing towards consolidated
programmatic lending via PRSCs appropnate?

COUNTRY ASSISTANCE STRATEGY

I. 

INTRODUCTION

1. 
This Country Assistance Strategy covers the 3-year period from FY03 to FY05. It
identifies key issues in Niger's economic and social development, reviews performance under the
previous CAS (1997) and CAS Progress Report (2001), and discusses a potential program of
lending and non-lending operations under different scenarios of nsk and performance. Two
major developments since the last CAS have mfluenced the strategic thrusts of this CAS. First,
Niger reached the Decision Pomt of the Enhanced HIPC Initiative in December 2000 and second,
Niger completed its first full PRSP, which was discussed by the Boards of the Bank and the Fund
in February 2002.

HI. POVERTY, RISK AND VULNERABILITY: THIE MACROECONOMIC, SOCIAL
AND POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT

2. 
Niger is one of the poorest countries in the world. 
Per capita GNP stood at
approximately US$180 in 2000 (World Bank Atlas method), and Niger ranks 161 out of 162
countries listed in UNDP's 2001 Human Development Report (HDR).' Available data on mcome
poverty point to a poverty headcount of 63 percent and to an extreme poverty mcidence of 34
percent. 2 Vulnerability to drought has worsened food insecurity and consequently malnutntion,
which affects 40 percent of children under 5 years old. Combmed with poor access to safe water,
poor nutrition contributes to an mfant mortality rate of 114 per 1000 and life expectancy at birth
of about 46 years. Adult illiteracy remains high at 84 percent and gross pnmary enrollment rates
low at 42 percent overall, with female enrolment at only 33 percent of school-age girls for the
school year 2001/2002. 
The burden of poverty and 
low social development 
falls
disproportionately on women, whose access to land, credit, technology, and social services
remains very limited, despite some recent progress.

3. 
Limited prospects for economic growth. As the, Nigeriens responding to 
the
Participatory Poverty Assessment mdicate (see Box 1), Niger's growth prospects are severely
constrained by its limited natural and human resource base. The growth record of Niger's rural-
based and poorly diversified economy is to a large extent determined by factors such as climatic
conditions and the level of external assistance. Niger's primary sector (about 40 percent of GDP

'Countries' ranks in the HDR are determined by the value of the Human Development Index (HDI), which
is composed of life expectancy at birth, adult literacy, combined gross enrollment (primary to tertiary) and
GDP per capita (expressed in US$ adjusted for purchasing power parity).
2 These data are based on the most recent household survey dating back to 1992-93. Work on a new
household survey began in 2002, drawing on the results of the 2001 population census.

Box 1: How Nigeriens define their own condition: The Participatory Poverty Assessment

Niger's vulnerability can best be understood via its direct impact on the lives of the average Nigerien. The
Participatory Poverty Assessment, undertaken as input for the Niger PRSP and which informs the present
CAS, reveals the extent to which Nigenens themselves define their lives in terms of vulnerability. In order of
expressed importance, they view the determinants and causes of this vulnerability to be

* Explosive population growth that is not accompanied by economic growth;
* Recurrent droughts that compromise the efforts of farmers in particular;
* The deterioration of factors of production;
* 
Inadequate investment, which reduces the scope of opportunity,
* 
Physical remoteness;
* 
In addition, factors such as widowhood, divorce, lack of job opportunities, old age, out-mrgration as
well as certain beliefs and socio-cultural attitudes, exacerbate the vulnerability of a substantial
segment of society.

in 2001) is dominated by rain-fed agriculture, while livestock production accounts for about a
third of the value added in the sector. Of the actively employed populaton, 84 percent of men
and 97 percent of women are involved m growing crops or raising livestock. However, population
pressure and environmental degradation have severely limited productive potential. Agro-
pastoral GDP grew at an annual average rate of less than 1.1 percent in real terms m the period
1969-2000, as increased cultivation area was accompanied by declining yields. This has
translated into an annual decline m per capita agricultural GDP of more than 2 percent, and an
increase in the number of households lacking food secunty. Having increased dramatically
during the uranium boom which had ended by the mid-1980s, the share of the secondary sector
(including mming and construction) in total production has stagnated. The economic indicators
summarized in Table I show the recent progress achieved in broadly restoring macroeconomic
stability but confirm that restoration of adequate sustained levels of growth remains a central
challenge for the future.

4. 
Politics and governance. During virtually the entire span of the 1990s, Niger underwent
a great deal of political instability coupled with poor govemance and widespread official
corruption, and these factors have had a strong negative effect on the country's economic
prospects. Following years of military rule, Niger reinstated democratic governance in 1992.
Two military coups d'etat took place successively in 1996 and 1999, but m December 1999 the
military junta handed power to a civilian Government, following presidential and legislative
elections in October-November 1999 that international observers judged to be free and fair. Over
most of the last decade, the political situation was complicated by tense social relations as
recurrent cnses m public finances led to trade union and student unrest (at the end of the
transition period in December 1999, cumulative salary arrears for civil servants had grown to 13
months). The coalition Government headed by President Mamadou Tandja has for the past three
years stabilized and restored a measure of confidence to Govemment, through much improved
political and economic governance, and by restoring sufficient discipline in public finance to
meet basic commitments - beginning with regular payment of public sector salaries. President
Tandja's party and its political allies enjoy a majority in parliament, and this has facilitated debate
and passage of difficult but necessary economic reforms. Though stabilized, the political situation

remains tense. Students, teachers, and other civil servants continue to press their demands for
increased entitlements and settlement of long-overdue arrears. Also contributing to the political
uncertainty of the 1990s were armed rebel mQvements expressing a sense of exclusion among
minority ethnic groups in the North (Touareg) and the East (Toubou). The current Government
has succeeded in commg to terms with these movements; however, it remams to be seen whether
the lynchpin of peace accords-the economic re-integration of ex-combatants-can be fully
achieved. The military, which has repeatedly intervened in politics, has returned to the barracks,
but remams a potential source of destabilization, as witnessed in a short-lived mutiny of soldiers
based in the eastern part of the country in August 2002.

5. 
A key event on the horizon is the completion of Niger's political decentralization, for
which the initial framework was established with a 1996 law establishing local collectivities.
Planning for decentralization has gained momentum under the present govemment, with
implementing legislation passed by the National Assembly, and local elections promised for late
2003. Given Niger's geographic features and the need to bring public service delivery closer to
communities and promote greater accountability, decentralization 
is potentially beneficial,
especially in remote areas. Initially, decentralization will take the form of a transfer of resource
mobilization responsibilities as well as service delivery responsibilities to the level of the
communes (local administrative districts) of which 265 are being created (from the present 36).
This is likely to have a profound impact on both public finance management and political
outcomes. A number of challenges remain for the process to be successfully implemented, such
as fully assessing the costs of decentralization and securing its financing, defining modalities for
the transfer of revenue and spending authority at the decentralized level, and establishing
effective inter-governmental fiscal transfer mechanisms. 
In particular, decentralization may
strain Niger's already sparse implementation capacity, e.g. in the area of fiduciary control,
beyond its current limits.

- 4 -

A Harsh Environment for Overcoming the Challenges of Development
6. 
The context in which Niger must tackle its development challenges is an immensely
difficult one, characterized in particular by:
e A hostile and deteriorating physical environment. Niger's population, the vast majority of
which depends upon rain-fed subsistence agriculture, has endured repeated droughts over the
past thirty years. Encroaching desertification has been exacerbated by high rates of
population growth (see below), deforestation, and overuse of already marginal soils. Since
independence the arable land surface of Niger has shrunk m half, from 25 percent to 12.5

percent.'

* Very rapid population growth. Niger currently has a total fertility rate of between 7.5
and 8 children per woman,-which is the highest in the world. The doubling time of the
population is estimated at 20 years and, under UN population projections, Niger would
become in 2050 the second most populated country of the Western Africa region, after

Nigeria.

* Lack of international competitiveness and vulnerability to external shocks. Niger's
uiamum deposits once gave it substantial leverage in international markets and provided a
steady source of government revenue. No longer. Niger's comparative advantage in several
agricultural products and livestock has not been fully exploited, the result of inappropriate
economic policies of the past, as well as extremely weak development of linkages between
producers (often poor and isolated from market information) and sub-regional or international
markets. Poorly developed and deteriorating roads and telecommunications infrastructure
increase this isolation. Niger is also highly exposed to exogenous shocks, such as oil price
increases, or the recent political turmoil in CMte d'Ivoire which cut it off from an important
market for agricultural production and source of important consumer items, as well as
remittances from the large number of Nigeriens living there. Nor is Niger well-positioned to
take advantage of quickly changing 
international economic conditions; 
for example,
following the CFA devaluation of 1994, Niger's supply response was limited.
* Poorly developed public sector institutions. Average Nigeriens lack access to basic public
goods that well-developed and well-managed public sector institutions can provide. The
judicial system is weak and understaffed. Basic social services, begmnmg with health care
and education, are poorly developed, and the majority of Nigenens still do not have access to
them. Enforcement of legal nghts, including gender equality, is the exception rather than the
rule. As elsewhere, governance and corruption issues are a concern, but in Niger the
problem is exacerbated by low capacity to carry out basic fiduciary and judicial oversight

functions.

* Limited financial intermediation. A weak financial sector does not allow for adequate
mobilization of domestic resources, nor for financing of pnvate sector and rural development,
housing, health care or education.
* Extremely low levels of capacity. Human and institutional capacity is a challenge at all
levels m Niger. 
In the public sector, progress is hindered by low administrative capacity,
itself the result of years of deteriorating conditions in public sector management, political
instability and a tendency for Niger's best educated citizens to seek better opportunities
elsewhere. Competition between the Government, development partners and the private
sector for scarce managerial talent limits the availability of related expertise in the public
sector. Private sector development suffers from a lack of professional and entrepreneurial
skills, or the training facilities that might produce them. The emergent NGOs that often
prove to be important partners in the design and implementation of development programs
also suffer from their fairly recent legalization and lack of experience.

- 5 -

* Uncertain public ownership of government sponsored programs. Following years of
public sector mismanagement and political instability, average Nigeriens - most living in
isolated villages where traditional authority holds sway - have little confidence m their
government's ability to deliver development programs or social services, and are skeptical
when officials request their participation. Exacerbating the disconnect between public
ownership and govemment initiatives are madequate communication between authorities and
ordinary people (an exception 
is the PRSP process, which has received international
recognition for the effectiveness of its communications effort). The national press readership
and distnbution is largely limited to the urban centers, and although radio ownership is
widespread, it is likely that most Nigeriens get news and information via local language
broadcasts emanating from northern Nigeria and elsewhere.
* Uncertain donor support and weak coordination of development efforts. Following the
military, coups d 'etat in the late 1990s, many donors withdrew or reduced their programs in
Niger, and although many have resumed support since the return of democratic government
m 2000, renewed political instability could tip the scales the other way. Perhaps because the
turmoil of the 1990s prevented significant donor 
involvement, 
there has been 
low
coordmation of donor programs, meaning that Niger is left with a diffusion of development
operations 
that dilute their overall 
impact and burden already weak capacity. 
The
government and most donors view the PRSP as an instrument that will help remedy this

situation.

7. 
Human vulnerability. These factors that form the context of development efforts m
Niger translate into a high degree of vulnerability that threaten the average Nigenen in terms of:

* Food insecurity. Hunger and the specter of famine loom large in the lives of the Nigerien
poor, and with continued dependence on rain-fed staple crops, the failure of one season's
rains can lead to widespread malnutrition and, as occurred in the worst droughts in the recent
past, starvation.
* Endemic disease. Widespread malnutrition, particularly among children, 
increases
vulnerability to otherwise preventable diseases. 
In some parts of Niger, as many as 40
percent or more of children die before the age of 5, with malaria, diarrhea and measles the
leading causes. HIV/AIDS constitutes a new risk to human and economic development,
which could substantially increase poverty and compromise or reverse Niger's development
progress.
* Economic exploitation. Lacking legal protections, and in the absence of market information,
infrastructure, or credit, most of Niger's rural poor are highly vulnerable to economic
exploitation. Most small farmers sell their products to mtermediaries who control the means
of transport and storage, and who profit in sub-regional markets, with little of it going back to
poor producers. Box 2 below suggests that although Niger's legal framework incorporates
core 
labor standards, 
the persistence of certain cultural practices and weakness of
Govemment enforcement capacity limit their impact.
* Women: the most vulnerable of all. As Niger's PRSP makes explicit, women are the most
vulnerable. They suffer greater income poverty, have higher rates of disease, lower rates of
schooling, and are highly vulnerable to abuses of legal and basic human rights.

8. 
Aware of these risks and vulnerabilities, and wiling to confront them fuly, Niger's
Government has developed a poverty reduction strategy (discussed in Section m below)
that seeks to address them. Nonetheless, the options for Niger remam constrained by its limited
domestic savings and access to external resources, and in particular to grant resources, for

- 6 -

development. While access to HIPC debt relief, and more recently to IDA grant resources, offer
additional opportunities to combat poverty and implement the PRSP, the work undertaken at the
time of the Enhanced HIPC Decision Point also highlighted the fragility of Niger's extemal
financing situation, even after it will have reached the Completion Pomnt. Niger's very gradual
return to debt sustainability calls for an extemal assistance strategy of limited borrowing, even on
IDA terms. An inherent tension therefore exists between the immensity of development needs
faced by the country and the constraints imposed by debt sustamability, especially when grant
funding from other development partners has been slow to respond to Niger's recent progress.

Box 2: Core Labor Standards in Niger

Collective bargaining. Niger's Labor Code is based on ILO principles, protecting the right to organize and
prohibiting antiunion discrinmination by employers. In private and state-owned enterprises, unions widely use
their right to bargain collectively with management without government interference for wages greater than
the statutory minimum as well as for more favorable work conditions. Collective bargaining also exists in the
public sector.

Slavery. The Labor Code prohibits forced or compulsory labor, except by legally convicted prisoners;
however, although slavery is prohibited by the Constitution, and the National Assembly has passed revisions
to the penal code to include new punishable offenses for crimes against its practice, a traditional form of
slavery still is practiced in some parts of the country, particularly in remote northem regions. In this cultural
context, those bom into the traditional subordinate caste are expected to work without pay for those in higher
castes within the traditional social structure. Most such individuals appear to accept their status, and can leave
their home areas without sanctions.

Child Labor. In 2000 the Government ratified ILO Convention 182 proscribing the worst forms of child
labor. Current laws put the minimum age for basic employment at 14 years, and 18 years for industnal jobs.
All children are required by law to attend school until age 12, although in reality only about 42 percent of
school-age Nigerien children actually attend pnmary school. Niger is currently in the process of improving
upon and harmonizing national legislation with intemational legal standards. A committee for harmonization
within the Ministry of Justice has put forward a proposal to improve legal protections against child labor to be
considered by the National Assembly in 2003. Despite these measures, the Govemment's capacity and
resources for enforcement are minimal. In 2000, UNICEF estimated that roughly 70 percent of children
between the ages of 5 and 14 in Niger were working, primanly in the informial and unregulated sectors of the

economy. A number of development agencies, including UNICEF and the ILO, are working with the
govemment to improve its capacity to protect children from exploitation, along with others, including the
Bank, to achieve the fullest possible enrolment of children in pnmary school.

9. 
Constrained on the one hand by an unusually difficult operating environment, and on the
other by limited resource availability and low capacity, Niger's central challenge is to achieve the
ambitious program of economic and social transformation set forth in its PRSP by maximizing
the effectiveness of development assistance and of its own sparse domestic savings.

III. 

NIGER'S PRSP AND THE BANK'S PROGRAM OF ASSISTANCE

10. 
Niger's PRSP was completed and adopted by the Government in December 2001, and
was subsequently discussed by the Bank and Fund Boards, along with a Joint Staff Assessment
(JSA) in February 2002. The JSA found the PRSP a credible framework for the implementation

- 7 -

of an effective poverty reduction strategy. The Bank and Fund found the document's main
strengths to be an extensive consultation process and strong country ownership (see Box 3), a
thorough poverty diagnosis, and the strategy's comprehensive scope.

Box 3. Extensive Consultations for the Preparation of the PRSP

The Niger PRSP is the result of an extensive consultative process that capitalized on the lessons learned
from previous expenences, such as the preparation in 1997 of a poverty reduction program in
collaboration with the United Nations Development Program (UNDP). 
In line with the commitments
taken in the l-PRSP, the authonties developed a comprehensive participation plan for the preparation of
the full PRSP. The PRSP consultative process was launched with a national workshop in February 2001,
which resulted in an agreement on an institutional framework that the Government established quickly
thereafter. This workshop also led to the constitution of eleven thematic groups, with the responsibility
of producing the building blocks of the PRSP, in terms of diagnosis as well as future strategies. The
participatory process was conducted in conjunction with a communication plan aimed at raising the
awareness within the country about the PRSP's objectives, the process, and the role of the concerned
stakeholders.

Strategy Paper, Joint StaffAssessment (January 16, 2002) (IDA/SecM2002-0012).

11. 
The Government's strategy for economic growth and poverty reduction is based on
four key pillars:
* A macroeconomic framework ensuring economic and financial stability while promoting
sustainable and robust growth;
* The development of productive sectors, especially in rural areas, to mitigate vulnerability and
stimulate income generation;
* The improvement in the access of the poor to quality social services, including basic
education, primary health care, reproductive health services, HIV/AIDS prevention, water
and sanitation, and adequate urban habitat; and
* The strengthening of institutional and mdividual capacity within and outside Government, at
the central and local level.

12. 
In addition, three cross-cutting themes are identified as guides to policy formulation m
all sectors:
* The effective inclusion of gender considerations;
* The promotion of good governance; and
* The redefinition of stakeholders' role in the implementation of policies, starting with the
state.

13. 
The macroeconomic framework for 2002-2005.- As the Joint Staff Assessment
concluded, the macroeconomic framework presented in the PRSP is generally sound, and the
CAS therefore adopts the PRSP framework as its baseline scenario. The average economic

- 8 -

growth rate of 4 percent in real terms over the period 2002-2005 is only slightly higher than the
post-devaluation average of 3.5 percent in 1995-2001 and is therefore considered feasible.
Assuming that the population growth rate remamns constant at 3.3 percent, this would translate
into real growth m annual per capita income below one percent and a reduction of only 2
percentage points in the poverty headcount rate during this period3 . It is expected that the current
crisis in Cote d'Ivoire will have a negative impact on the Nigerien economy in 2002 and 2003.
The Bank is working with the authorities and the IMF on assessing the extent of this potential
impact, which could result from reduced demand for Nigerien exports, lower remittances, as well
as reduced transfers under the WAEMU common external tariff arrangements. For subsequent
years, and barring the occurrence of more external shocks, in particular a severe drought, further
consolidation of political and financial stability should lead to an increase in investment of both
pnvate and public ongin, financed by higher domestic and foreign savings, and contribute to the
attainment of the growth targets over the period.

Sources of growth. The PRSP stresses the importance of identifying sources of growth
and presents some preliminary reflections on this, which will need further examination and
research. Increased private and public investment in the rural sector (irrigation) as well as the
modern sector (infrastructure) are expected to fuel production and growth. A likely channel for
absorbing the additional production, especially of agro-pastoral products is through expanded
trade, mainly (but not only) within the sub-region. Niger has demonstrated a comparative
advantage in certam niche commodities and for livestock. The strategy focuses on improving the
supply response of what is believed to be latent demand for these products. Much demand
originates from the WAEMU area, but most comes from Niger's main sub-regional economic

3 The Niger PRSP assumes the elasticity of the headcount ratio with respect to GDP growth to be below
one. This assumption remains to be confirmed when the household survey is completed.

partner, Nigeria. Trade and investment flows along the 1,600 km long border between the two
countnes are mostly unrecorded. The Govemment believes that regional and global integration
will continue to offer the best opportunities for diversifying and stabilizing economic growth in
Niger. Private investment in infrastructure has received increased attention with the acceleration
of the pnvatization program. Public investment, supported by regular donor programs and HIPC
resources is expected to pick up with the resumption and increase in aid following the political
stabilization and the adoption of the PRSP.

15. Medium-term fmancing requirements. Niger's total extemal financing requirements in
the PRSP base case scenario could surpass one billion dollars for the period 2002-05, resulting m
an estimated total financing gap of US$266 million (after projected debt relief)4 .
In light of the
anticipated negative impact on Niger of the C6te d'Ivoire crisis (including weaker regional
demand for Niger's exports), financing requirements may be even larger. Niger could also suffer
a terms of trade shock stemming from higher oil pnces in the event of intemational events
reducing supply. The Govemment (with Bank and Fund assistance) is therefore updating the
financing requirements in light of these recent developments and nsks to the extemal outlook.
While the prospects for covering Niger's sizeable financing gap are not unfavorable given the
improvement in the policy environment, the Govemment will need to further consolidate its track
record of reforms (including strengthening domestic resource mobilization) and increase its
dialogue with donors, notably around the PRSP, in order to secure such a level of resources.

The PRSP proposes several ways of dealing with Niger's difficult external
environment and human vulnerability. To address the vulnerability of Niger's poorest
citizens to recurrent drought and famine, it identifies rural development, and particularly irrigated
agriculture as top priorities along with improved development and maintenance of transport
mfrastructure that connects the rural poor with markets and sources of food. To address capacity
and governance issues, the PRSP emphasizes measures to improve capacity for delivery of basic
services, and notes in particular the importance of building capacity for the decentralization
process. To counter the risk of macroeconomic instability, the PRSP emphasizes disciplined
management of public finances as well as the search for new sources of growth to reduce the

volatility associated with past reliance on uranium. The PRSP recognizes the cross-cutting role
of the financial sector and the need to strengthen it so that it can provide adequate support for all
sectors of activity. In response to the risk of economic detenoration at the sub-regional level, the
PRSP calls for Niger's full participation m regional organizations, such as the West African
Economic and Monetary Union, and initiatives, such as NEPAD, that underpin regional economic
integration. With regard to the risk of continued lack of donor resources and coordination, the
PRSP seeks to establish a framework for unifying donors, under Nigerien leadership, around
strategies that constitute the blueprints for action in the pnority sectors identified in the PRSP.
The next step in the PRSP process is the organization of a donor forum for purposes of resource
mobilization around the PRSP's sectoral themes and strategies. The meeting is scheduled to take
place in February 2003.

17. 
Several areas of weakness in the PRSP (noted by the JSA) require further development.
In the poverty profile the most important gap is the lack of comprehensive assessment of the
poverty impact of past policies and programs, implying the need for a reliable mechanism for
monitoring and evaluation. The PRSP contains insufficient analysis of sources of growth. The
PRSP does not adequately address gender and population growth rate issues. It lacks a coherent
strategic framework for agricultural development. There is a need to link macroeconomic targets
and poverty reduction objectives, establish a strong link between the poverty reduction strategy
and multisectoral response to HIV/AIDS, and strengthen partnerships with the non-govemmental
and private sector for better delivery of social services. 
In addition, there is a need for the
govemment to assume a more forceful leadership role in mobilizing and coordinating donor
resources to finance the resource gap associated with achieving the PRSP's goals. With support
from the Bank and from UNDP, Niger's PRSP Secretariat is developmng analytical and policy
work in most of these areas of weakness, and these will be presented to Niger's development
partners at the February 2003 donors forum.

Key Objectives and Challenges in Formulating the Bank's Assistance Strategy

18. 
The Bank's thematic and sectoral choices will fully align themselves with the
PRSP's priorities. The main objective of this CAS is to support the implementation and further
refinement of the PRSP,'imcluding by helping Niger mitigate the many risks and vulnerabilities it
faces. The strategic focus of the CAS is directly derived from the PRSP's four strategic pillars, as
well as its three cross-cutting policy principles. 
In addition, areas identified in the JSA as
important yet not sufficiently developed in the PRSP will receive particular attention in the
Bank's program of operations and AAA, as well as in its dialogue with the donor community.

19. 
Selectivity in Bank's Work. Selectivity in the Bank's work will be informed by PRSP
strategic priorities; by the lending constraints imposed by debt sustainability considerations (see
para. 34); and by Bank comparative advantage as well as the leadership expected from other
development partners in specific areas (see Box 4). The Bank's assistance will concentrate on the
key areas covered by the PRSP, yet provide support only to a sub-set of activities specified. In
the spmt of both selectivity and the Bank's desire to facilitate improved development partner
collaboration, a consistent effort will be made to ensure that other donors take the lead in some
activities. For example, Canada is already leading coordination for the education sector, while
the Bank continues to play a lead role in providing funding and technical assistance in a
coordinated donor effort around Niger's 10-year strategic plan for education. Other donors have
taken a lead role 
in multi-donor coalitions of support in other areas mcluding Water
(Switzerland), Food Security (FAO) and HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) - all areas in which the Bank is
playing a major financing role. In some other areas, such as Justice sector reform, the Bank par-

Donor harmonization Niger's major partners participate actively in the ongoing elaboration of sector strategies as well as in thematic groups
in the areas of rural development, pnvate sector development, judicial sector reform, food secunty, and education Coordination of donor
interventions has been weak, largely as a result of the unstable conditions of the 1990s. The Bank has recently initated work at the countiy
level with interested multilateral and bilateral partners to support govemment-led harmonization programs, and Niger has agreed to participate

ticipates in the donor-Government group (headed by Denmark with EU support), but will limit its
direct support to identifying ways its operations can contribute to the strategic objectives
identified by the group. The Bank's assistance for private sector development, beyond its present
support for the privatization process and financial sector restructuring, will be limited to ESW as
other donors (notably, the EU and France) are providing significant capacity building assistance.
The Bank will take the lead in promoting collaboration and harmonization of multi-sectoral,
community-based interventions within the framework of the Community Action Program (CAP).
While the CAP will provide limited support to decentralization, focusmg on capacity for
community-level development, and focused AAA will help further the agenda on fiscal
decentralization, France and the EU are playing the lead role in mobilizing multi-donor support
for decentralization.

Box 5. CAS formulation: a participatory process linked to the PRSP

Consistent with the core pnnciple of linking the new Niger CAS to the PRSP process, the Bank has connected its
CAS consultations with the nation-wide consultations held both pnor and subsequent to the PRSP's formulation,
which the Govemment organized and led. This CAS draws upon a number of documentary sources, including the
Participatory Poverty Assessment (PPA) that the Bank financed and which served as the basis for the PRSP's analysis
of poverty in Niger. The CAS also draws upon a recent client survey (conducted in 2001), OED and QAG reviews,
and project supervision and Implementation Completion reports. In addition, the Bank has carried out consultations
with Government, elected officials, civil society, the private sector, beneficianes and the donor community. This
process was initiated with a full day of the June 2002 Niger CPPR devoted to discussing CAS-related issues with a
representative group of Government officials, project staff, beneficiaries, parliamentanans and development partners.
During October 2002, the Bank conducted extensive consultations, visiting 4 of of Niger's 7 regional capitals in the
company of officials of the PRSP secretariat, the Ministry of Finance and Economy, and the UNDP. In so doing, it
discussed the main points of this CAS and its linkage with the PRSP and other donor planning processes with an
array of Govemment officials, NGO representatives, community representatives, traditional authonties, and business
people The final draft version of this CAS was discussed extensively with the Prime Minister and the Minister of
Finance, and in a half-day workshop (November 13, 2002) with all Ministers whose areas of mandate are affected by
Bank operations. This feedback was highly useful in refining the CAS' strategic objectives as well as operational

activities.

In regional consultations, a number of participants noted the relevance of the PRSP and praised the assistance
provided by Niger's extemal partners, in particular UNDP and the Bank. Participants supported the new approach,
emphasizing the country "in the dnver's seat", and the focus on reaching the poorest. Their comments can be
summarized at three levels.
* 
International: More emphasis needs to be on the coordination of donor programs in the fight against poverty to
avoid the diffusion of aid resources in Niger. Debt relief and budgetary assistance are effective instruments so
long as good govemance and transparency are assured However, so long as there is bias against countnes such
as Niger in international markets, it will be difficult for them to export their way to growth and it is extremely
important that the World Bank serve as their advocate in intemational fora.
* National: The PRSP is a sound basis for organizing future development assistance. Achieving its objectives
will require a programmatic approach 
It also signifies a restructuring of relations between the state, civil society
and the private sector in the implementation of national policies. A number of speakers expressed concem about
the effective roll-out of decentralization and spoke of the need for intemational assistance to make it work
Local: A number of participants stressed the importance of community-driven development as an effective
approach to empowering the poor. Several mentioned the need for assistance in building the capacity of NGOs
and pnvate associations in order to make them more effective in helping the poor.

* 

20. 
Towards consolidated programmatic lending. 
In order to maximize its developrnent
impact, the Bank's assistance to Niger will seek to underpin and enhance national ownership ard
programs, m line with the PRSP. The Government and the Bank share the view that this can best
be achieved through a progressive shift towards consolidated programmatic lending, with the
Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC) as the preferred lending instrument. Presently the
Bank and all other development partners in Niger provide most assistance in the form of stand-

- 13 -

alone projects that are poorly coordinated. Scaling up of durable poverty-reducing effects on a
national scale will not be possible if this approach is pursued. In addition, the proliferation of
retail projects has in some cases helped to undermine rather than build national capacity and
ownership, particularly by recruiting away some of govemment's best-performing personnel mto
numerous project implementation entities. In contrast, a well prepared and properly sequenced
transition to consolidated programmatic lending could mcrease leadership and management of
development processes by the Govemment. At the same time, it would facilitate a coordinated
approach by donors in support of development objectives identified by the Government in
consultation with its own citizens, the essence of the PRSP instrument.

21. 
The challenge of transition. In order for the Bank, and other donors to provide the bulk
of their assistance through consolidated programmatic lending, Niger would need to complete the
"first generation" structural reform agenda, which is currently underway. This will enable Niger
to squarely focus its efforts on the budgetary, sectoral and institutional reforms required for
consolidated program support to unleash its full potential. In addition, two important transitional
challenges present themselves:

* Capacity. The first is the need to establish sufficient capacity for program implementation in
all sectors, fiduciary controls and effective budget management. Particularly m light of
Niger's imminent decentralization, attention will need to be focused on developing both
central and local capacity 
to deliver social services and carry out basic administrative and
developmental functions. Poor fiduciary management, particularly in public procurement,
has been a barrier to effective implementation of projects for the Bank and for other donors,
and is responsible for limited confidence among development partners in Niger's ability to
manage budget support. An important focus of the Bank's lending and non-lending program
is therefore 
to help improve capacity for fiduciary control at both 
the central and
decentralized levels, working closely with other development partners such as the EU.
* Sectoral and multi-sectoral strategies. The second transitional challenge is to prepare sector
programs based on comprehensive strategies, ultimately leading to the preparation of a full
Medium-Term Expenditure Framework as the budgetary expression of PRSP prionties. A
strategic goal of the CAS will therefore be to reinforce Niger's capacity in preparing such
sectoral strategies, 
through processes 
that encompass 
rigorous analysis and broad
consultations. 
In some instances, multi-sectoral strategies are required, such as is the case
with the fight against HIV/AIDS, as well as for gender, population, and govemance.

22. 
A shift to consolidated programmatic lending will not preclude preparation of new stand-
alone IDA operations, and in the transition period the share of IDA resources channeled through
these would likely surpass that of PRSCs. The Bank would continue traditional self-standing
operations where the benefits of separate implementation and financial arrangements appear to
outweigh the advantages of a more integrated approach to public financial resource transfers.
Separate operations may be justified by these special circumstances, in particular where:

* Govemment projects mvolve a great deal of international competitive bidding, so that the
Bank can certify that procurement is handled transparently and fairly.
* There is need to offset the specific fiscal costs related to policy reforms, or where there are
unforeseen fiscal shocks (revenue or expenditure) that could not be foreseen at the time of
budget formulation and that require an urgent response.
* There is an urgent need for more intensive support in achieving the health and education
Millennium Development Goals.

- 14-

* An autonomous implementation mechanism has been established by the Government and is
necessary to support highly visible emergency activities (e.g. HIV/AIDS).

23. 
Such self-standing operations are expected however to become the exception over time,
and it will be an objective of all such operations to help develop the national capacity (public and
private, central and decentralized) to plan, implement, monitor and evaluate under budget support
operations m the near future. Most stand-alone projects would also increasingly reflect a
programmatic approach by supporting sector-wide programs and coordinated interventions by
donors.

IV. 

THE BANK'S TRACK RECORD IN NIGER

24. 
The Bank has regularly reviewed its Niger portfolio since the introduction of the 1997
CAS, via annual CPPRs, supervision and mid-term reviews, OED evaluations, a Participatory
Poverty Assessment prepared as input for the PRSP, results from the 2001 Client Survey, as well
as Project Status Reports (PSRs), and Implementation Completion Reports (ICRs). Because
Niger's PRSP process was underway at the time a new CAS would normally have been prepared,
a CAS Progress Report was presented to and discussed by the Board in November 2001. It found
that progress towards the 1997 CAS objectives was generally on track, but had been hampered by
political instability and consequent high turnover 
in key Government positions, by weak
implementation capacity, and by low degrees of ownership. Although these factors had not
changed the overall direction of reform, they had affected its pace.

The Country Portfolio and Non-Lending Program

25. 
The Niger country portfolio has improved dramatically during the period since the
1997 CAS. As successive CPPRs and project supervision have found, the CAS itself had a
positive effect by simplifying the Bank's objectives and by limiting intervention to areas of
comparative advantage. 
In addition, a number of Improvements to project supervision and
fiduciary controls have contributed substantially to portfolio perfornance. 
Perhaps most
importantly, the Bank's more participatory approach in project design, implementation and
evaluation, has considerably enhanced local ownership. As of the latest project supervision data,
all 7 projects in the Bank's portfolio are rated "satisfactory" in terms of development objectives,
and 6 of the 7 projects were rated "satisfactory" in terms of implementation progress (see Table

4).5

26. 
Past administrative budget constraints limited the Bank's non-lending services, and thus
the availability of "core diagnostic" ESW to inform this CAS (see Table 5). In the last two years
however, these have focused on helping the Government complete 
the PRSP, both in its
analytical and participatory elements. In this context, the Bank has introduced to Niger poverty
analysis techniques that have broken ground in other African countries, notably the Participatory
Poverty Assessment (PPA) and Poverty Mapping exercises (undertaken in preparation of the
Community Action Program and the PRSP). In terms of financial management and fiduciary
controls, the Bank's CPAR of 1999 has served as critical background for the Government's over-

5 In FY02, QAG assessed the supervision of the Natural Resources Management Project (para. 29) as

highly satisfactory.

haul of its public procurement laws and their implementation (supported by an IDF grant).
Significant work on extemal debt and related sustainability analysis has also been carried out in
the context of the HIPC initiative. A financial sector review was conducted in FY00. In FY02 the
Bank also assisted four ministries to develop a rural development strategy, which is being further
refined in FY03. Indications are that the non-lending program has had an impact on the design of
lending operations and the policy dialogue. But, as the Bank expands its non-lending services, it
will need to develop more robust means of measuring their performance and impact as has
progressively been achieved for the lending portfolio (e.g. by systematically assessing the extent
to which the analysis and key recommendations from the Bank's core diagnostic ESW influence
the design of subsequent PRSPs and PRSP annual progress reports).

i Macroeconomic stability and fiscal management. As the CAS Progress Report notes,

a significant number of key economic reforms have been completed with IDA support. In
particular, public finance management has improved since the present Government took power in
January 2000. The Government has adopted a plan to reduce the stock of domestic arrears,
including civil service salaries, and made initial payments on past salary arrears in 2001 and
2002. Budgetary revenue collection has also improved in response to a series of administrative
reforms. Building upon achievements since 1996, the Government has adopted a program to

- 16 -

establish 
transparency and accountability 
in budgetary management while mamtaining
macroeconomic stability. On the revenue side, achievements mclude better management of the
corporate income tax, especially for large taxpayers, taxpayer monitoring, fight against customs
fraud, reform of the petroleum products excise, and improved monitoring of taxpayer compliance.
With respect to public expenditure management, initial progress has been achieved throughout
the budget cycle, starting with the linking of the macroeconomic framework and medium term
expenditure program in the PRSP. 
Important progress was also achieved with respect to the
restoration of fiscal accountability with the orderly closing of accounts for FY 1997 to 2001, and
the launch of an ex post external control by the legislative and judiciary branches of the state.

28. 
Human development. While Bank-specific attribution is mherently problematic, the
CAS Progress Report also found considerable development impact resulting from Government
reforms and development partners' (including Bank) investments across priority sectors. For
example, m the education sector, the gross primary enrollment rate (GER) has increased from
around 27 percent m 1995/96 to 42 percent at the end of the 2001/2002 school year. In the health
sector, service quality has improved as a result of investments in training, essential drugs and
medical consumables, rehabilitation works, maintenance and the fine-tuning and implementation
of a quality assurance program. Access to basic health care (defined as population living within 5
kilometers of a health center) has increased from 32 percent of the population in 1997 to 47.6
percent in 2000 (most recent data available). Application of Niger's cost recovery law and
capacity building of its drug procurement agency have resulted in modestly improved availability
of essential drug stocks in health facilities. Likewise, considerable progress has been achieved in
organizing the national fight against HIV/AIDS; and following a lengthy process of national
strategy building and organization, a multi-sectoral mechanism for the national effort is now in
place.

29. 
Rural development and infrastructure. Considerable progress has been made in rural
development, particularly where projects have been implemented via communities: (i) the Natural
Resources Management Project established decentralized and community-driven 
financing
mechanisms in several areas to support a multi-sectoral range of micro-investments; and (ii) the
Private Pilot Irrigation Promotion Project, working through water users' organizations, has
disseminated low-cost and locally manufactured pumping systems to many farmers to support
increased incomes through gardening. In the infrastructure sector road maintenance is improving
now that the Government has implemented key sector reforms, including creating an autonomous
road maintenance fund.

30. 
Privatization. Necessary structural reforms have also progressed with the Government's
renewed commitment to its privatization agenda, and the passage of enabling legislation. The
telecommunication sector has been liberalized (two cellular licenses were granted) and the fixed-
line telecommunications company (SONITEL) as well as the water company (SNE) were
successfully privatized in 2001. The Government has recently committed to a revised calendar
by which the remainig parastatal utilities 
including the petroleum distribution company
(SONIDEP) and the electricity supply company (NIGELEC) will be privatized by the mid-2003.
Also slated for privatization in 2003 is OFEDES, an entity specialized in deep well-drilling for
subterranean water resources.

Box 6. Progress against 1997 CAS Base Case Indicators

Niger's progress against the base case indicators of the 1997 CAS has been generally positive. While the
Government remains committed to the reform agenda included in the base case and has recently taken action to
accelerate 
implementation, Niger has undergone 2 major changes of Government since that time, and
conditions have changed more generally, rendering some 
indicators less relevant than at the time of
formulation. Progress against the key indicators has been as follows:

* Access to primary education has climbed steadily over the past decade, from 27.8 percent overall in
1992/93 to 41.7 percent in 2001/02. The primary school enrolment rate for girls has also nsen from 21
percent in 1992/93 to 33 percent in 2001/02, but is still far from satisfactory.
* Both the quality and the coverage of basic health care improved with considerable investment in
rehabilitation works, training and essential generic drugs and with the construction of 157 integrated health
centers (primary health care facilities) around the country. The population living within 5 kilometers of a
health center has increased from 32 percent in 1996 to 47 6 percent in 2000 and improved quality is
reflected in modestly increased utilization rates (from 18percent in 1996 to 28percent in 2001)
* Access to safe drinking water remains largely unchanged over the penod; however, this should improve
once the Water Sector Development project approved by the Board in May 2001 -begins having an impact
* Reforms contnbuting to the attainment of minimum quality standards on the priority road network
were delayed due to repeated Government turnovers; however, these have recently been enacted and Niger
is on its way to improving the pace and quality of road construction and maintenance
Performance againsi annual budgetary targets was globally satisfactory from 1996 to 1998 While actual
budgetary revenue undershot targets each year, it also showed a steady increase over the period. Public
expenditure was adjusted each year so that the deficit targets could be reached in 1996 and 1997
* Portfolio performance improved significantly over the CAS penod.

* 

31. 
Despite these positive advances, overali progress toward some key development
objectives remains limited. For example, although basic education has been made more
accessible to many of Niger's most destitute rural populations, demand for education remains
weak, as recently confirmed by results from the Participatory Poverty Assessment (many
Nigenen parents do not see any benefit to education where there are few employment
opportuxiities for. those with basic- education). And notwithstanding notable progress m health
service coverage and quality since 1997, still less than half of Nigenens live within 5 kilometers
of a health facility, and many are unable to pay for essential drugs and services. A particular
problem involves staffing health facilities (particularly outside of major cities) with qualified
personnel. The lack of progress in reducing rapid population growth is also of major concern. 6
Despite some progress on gender issues - for example in increasing girls' enrolment rates and in
recent legislation promoting public sector female employment - women continue to suffer from
discrimmation in the labor market and lack legal protection.

32. 
Implementation issues continue to slow progress toward development goals across
sectors. The June 2002 CPPR noted that inconsistent application of procurement laws and
procedures leads to numerous slowdowns m programs funded by donor agencies. Failure to
disburse counterpart funding on a timely basis remains a significant implementation problem.
Public finance management still shows weaknesses with respect to the preparation of the budget,
the execution of some expenditure items and the timely recording of transactions. Lack of
capacity in key Governmental institutions, but also in local implementing NGOs, and in the key
service mdustries (for example, construction) also slows implementation.

6 The data show that the annual population growth rate of 3.3 percent and the total fertility rate between 7.5
and 8 percent have not changed over the past several years.

LENDING AND NON-LENDING PROGRAM, 2003-2005

IDA Lending and Debt Sustainabiity

33. 
Fragile external financing situation. Debt sustainability concerns have played a major
role in the determmation of the CAS lending scenarios, as Niger is one of the most fragile
countries among the group having acceded to the Enhanced HIPC Initiative. 7 At end-i999,
Niger's outstanding and disbursed debt was estimated at US$1.6 billion in nominal terms or about
80 percent of that year's GDP. The net present value (NPV) of this debt stock was equivalent to
322 percent of exports, well above the sustainability threshold of 150 percent determined in the
framework of the Enhanced HIPC Initiative. Niger reached the Decision Point in December 2000
and has since been receiving interim debt relief under the HIPC mitiative from several
multilateral and bilateral creditors. Niger's Completion Point, originally planned for 2002, is now
scheduled for mid-2003. By participating m the initiative, Niger will receive an estimated
US$890 million in nominal terms (out of which US$302 million from IDA) over 20 years. The
provision of HIPC assistance has an important positive effect on the sustainability of Niger's
external debt. However, even after full HIPC assistance delivery at the Completion Point,
Niger's external financing situation will remain fragile. According to latest projections, enhanced
HIPC assistance and bilateral assistance beyond HIPC would reduce the NPV of the debt-to-
export ratios (NPVRs) significantly, to 167 percent in 2003, down from 344 percent for the same
year after traditional debt relief mechanisms. While this constitutes a significant reduction, the
ratio would only fall below 150 percent by 2015, which confirns that Niger's extemal financing
situation will remain extremely fragile, even after full HIPC delivery.

34. 
Updated debt sustainability scenario. Better than expected export performance in 2000
and 2001 and the granting of additional bilateral debt relief beyond HIPC have resulted In a
reduction of Niger's NPVRs in the short term relative to the original Decision Point scenario,
while revised export projections have induced a slight deterioration from 2010 onwards (see
figure 1 in Annex 13). These updated projections leave limited room for new borrowing from
IDA, which in the recent past has been the main source of extemal financing. 8 A simulation
conducted for the CAS shows that retuming to the NPVRs of the updated Decision Point scenario
by the end of the CAS period would require limiting IDA commitments to US$124 million
between 2003 and 2005, in contrast to Niger's current IDA allocation of US$238 million
equivalent. 
In light of the actual lending pipeline and the Bank's current engagements to the
Govemment, restricting lendmg in such a way would mean stopping financial commitments to
Niger after FY04, an overly harsh stance for the Bank's relationship with one of its poorest
clients and one that is making satisfactory overall progress on key reforms. 
In addition, the
sensitivity of the NPVR to short-term changes in export performance suggest that it would not be
appropriate 
to rigidly link the base case lending volumes to the updated Decision Point
projections. 
Indeed the fact that the updated NPVRs have improved relative to those in the
original Decision Point scenarios underscores the importance of allowing some flexibility in
response to cyclical changes in export performance. 
In light of these considerations, the Bank
would plan to make base case lending commitments to Niger up to a maximum of US$238

million as long as NPVRs remain below 200 percent.9 Nonetheless, NPVRs would be expected
to evolve in a downward direction by the end of the CAS period in the absence of a major
external shock.

35. 
Impact of base and high case 1DA commitments. Figure 1 shows the impact of IDA
lending on debt sustainability in the base case and in a high case of US$260 million relative to the
updated Decision Point scenario. It suggests that committing the full IDA allocation in the CAS
period would result in NPVRs that are higher than those in the updated Decision Point scenario,
yet result in an average NPVR of 166 percent for the period 2003 - 2018, only slightly higher
than the corresponding 157 percent average from the updated Decision Point scenario. Most
importantly, the NPVRs associated with both the base and high case lending commitments stay
significantly below 200 percent during the entire period.

36. 
Measures to improve debt sustainability. Niger's debt sustamability is highly sensitive
to export shocks. - To minimize the impact of such shocks in the future, Niger needs to strengthen
and diversify its export base, which is now predominantly composed of agricultural and livestock
products, and the stagnant uranium sector. However, due to important capacity and resource
constraints, the stronger growth and export performance that the Government aims to achieve
through implementing the PRSP is likely to materialize only in the medium term.

37. 
Ensuring debt sustainability in the medium and long term will require mobilizing more
domestic resources and attracting larger amounts of grant financing. Through its ongoing efforts
to strengthen the fiduciary framework and to enhance transparency and effectiveness of public
finance, the Government has begun improving conditions for more effective use of external
assistance. 
In addition, the completion of the PRSP has equipped the Govemment with a
comprehensive strategy to improve the provision of social services and promote economic
growth. Niger will nonetheless require sustained high levels of external financmg, mostly on
grant terms, if it is to successfully implement the PRSP and make substantial progress towards
meeting the Millennium Development Goals.

9 The original Decision Point scenario projected a trajectory of the NPVR that peaked at 190 in 2003, and
the 200 percent threshold would therefore ensure that new IDA lending during CAS penod would not result

in a deterioration relative to the early period in that scenario.

- 20 -

Lending and Non-Lending Program

38. 
IDA allocation and instruments. 
In the high case, commitments of up to US$260
would be only about 9 percent higher than the base case, reflecting debt sustainability
considerations. The Bank will therefore also respond to better than expected performance by the
acceleration of the transition to programmatic financmg via PRSCs (i.e. via a larger share of IDA
financing channeled through PRSCs at an accelerated pace than under the base case). Under the
high case scenario, assuming basic capacity has been built withm a relatively short time span, and
also assuming adequate preparation of a Medium Term Expenditure Framework, PRSC lending
could commence m FY04 with a focus on social sector (education and health) service deliveryl0 ,
and possibly components of rural development, including rural transport. Under the base case
scenarno, which assumes that putting in place the minimum necessary capacity will require more
time, PRSC lending would commence in FY05, with intensive capacity building efforts put in
place via a PEAC II in late FY03 and a PEAC III in FY04, coupled with investment lendmg and
grant-financed operations. Under a low case scenano, commitments of up to US$100 million
would be around 42 percent of the base case level.

39. 
IDA grant allocation. In accordance with the IDA 13 guidelines for allocation of grants,
Niger will receive a significant proportion of future fundmg (including 100 percent of the
HIV/AIDS operation under the MAP program) in the form of IDA grants. Beyond the MAP
program, the remainder of the grant allocation for operations under preparation will be allocated
taking into account the IDA grant allocation guidelines; e.g., a focus on reducing poverty among
the poorest of the poor, and the fight agamst endemic diseases including HIV/AIDS. The balance
of the FY03 IDA grant allocation after the MAP (about US$35 million) will be used to fund the
CAP. In FY04 and FY05 we expect both the Basic Education and Health In projects to receive
substantial amounts of grant financmg.

40. 
Non-lending services. The Bank's non-lending program will contribute to Niger's
ability to attain the PRSP's objectives, will underpm lending operations, and will provide policy
advice on issues that were not well-developed in the PRSP. Recent-Bank financed analytical and
advisory activities (AAA) - in particular the PPA and support to the Rural Development Strategy
- directly supported the PRSP. Other ESW underpins the assistance program's focus on
interventions to increase food secunty and community-driven development, as well as the agenda
to contain population growth. Further AAA are planned to help the government design policy
responses to issues raised m the Joint Staff Assessment, for example on gender, with the view to
helping the Government make progress on the gender and population agenda under the proposed
PRSC.

41. 
Planned AAA under the base case is summarized in Annex 4. 
In addition to formal
ESW, some sector studies/strategies -
including transport and rural development- will be
undertaken in the context of project preparation or implementation so as to inform the design of
support to these sectors under the planned PRSC. As summarized m Table 5, core diagnostic
economic and sector work is also planned, includmg a Public Expenditure Review/CFAA
(FY04), a Poverty Analysis (FY04), a CPAR (FY04) and a Development Policy Review (FY05).
This work, which will be done in consultation or partnership with the Government and key
development partners, will provide the basis for identifying where the most intensive support will

be needed, particularly with regard to reinforcing public sector capacity in pursuit of the PRSP's
objectives and in readying Niger for the transition to consolidated programmatic lending. It will
also help to define the policy agenda for the FY05 PRSC. The Poverty Analysis will be based on
updated census and survey data on income poverty to supplement the qualitative analysis from
the FY02 PPA and will contribute to the design of the PRSC.

Lending Scenarios

42. 
The planned 
lending program will build on the existing portfolio to support the
implementation of the PRSP. The Bank has selected the operations in the proposed lending
program in consultation with the Government, taking into consideration the programs of other
development partners. Despite debt sustainability concerns, 
the high case is essential as a
performance incentive for Niger and a signal to other development partners for enhanced
assistance if perfornance is exceptional.

43. 
Base case scenario. The base case assistance program would support the priorities of
the PRSP. In managing the lending program, the Bank and the Govemment will closely monitor
the evolution of debt sustainability indicators, including seeking additional grant funding from
donors that is essential to longer-term debt sustainability.

45. 
High case scenario. The high case differs from the base case mainly regarding the pace
of reform implementation. While maintaining strict fiscal discipline, the authorities would
succeed in accelerating fiduciary (especially procurement) and budget reforms as well as
achieving better than expected results in resource mobilization. Another feature of the high case
scenario would be accelerated progress in capacity building efforts, fnancial sector reform,
privatization and regulatory reform. 
Implementation of comprehensive strategies to address
population growth and gender inequities, and of the education and health strategies would begin
to lay the basis for sustamable human capital development and higher per capita income growth.
As a result, Niger would make faster progress towards the MDGs, in a context of higher pnvate
sector - led growth. Triggers for moving to the high case are specified in Table 7.

46. 
Implicationsfor Bank program. The main response of the Bank in the high case would
be an accelerated transition to consolidated programmatic lendmg by increasing the amount of its
overall support channeled through PRSCs. Under this scenario, a first PRSC would be presented
to the Board in FY04 and the first 3-year PRSC cycle would be completed in FY06.

47. 
Low case scenario. The low case scenario would result from a halt in reform efforts and
deterioration of fiscal discipline. Political problems, for example, weakened resistance to vested
interests with political clout, a return to power of the military, or general political destabilization,
could be sources of such a scenario. A setback in reform efforts would lead to falling behind
PRSP targets, loss of fiscal control resulting in accumulation of arrears, deterioration in fiduciary
standards, reduced poverty focus in budget execution, and general macroeconomic instability
(including the unraveling of the PRGF support program). Triggers for moving to the low case
are discussed in para. 49.

48. 
Implications for Bank program. Under such a scenario, IDA lending over the next years
would have to be reduced substantially. The Bank's assistance strategy would have to be adapted
by ceasmg adjustment lending and postponing the shift towards consolidated programmatic
lending. The Bank would concentrate its efforts on strengthening capacity and building support
for reform in close coordination with other development partners, with the aim of bringing Niger
back into the base case as soon as possible. The Bank would also finance selective interventions
in basic social services with appropriate fiduciary standards being assured through expanded use
of autonomous agencies, and ESW would be limited to studies in support of social service
delivery.

Lending Triggers

49. 
The specific triggers for the base and high cases, covering some key actions in the
implementation of the PRSP, are shown below in Table 7. These triggers also build on prior
actions for the HIPC Completion Point. The Bank would move to a low case scenario if the basic
triggers for remaining in the base case were not met, in particular if: (i) execution of the budget
for PRSP priority sectors is deemed unsatisfactory; (ii) the macroeconomic framework goes off
track, with a significant deterioration in debt sustainability ratios; (iii) the Government fails to put
in place implementation decrees for the new public procurement code; (iv) the prvatization
program for the remaining parastatals in the electricity and energy distribution sectors is stalled;
and (v) the Government fails to formulate a satisfactory population and reproductive health
strategy.

50. 
The evolution of the debt sustainability indicators and their possible deterioration are
captured through a component of the trigger on maintenance of a satisfactory macroeconomic

- 23 -

framework. This signals the need to reduce IDA commitments below base case levels if long-
term projections (2003-2018) show NPVRs in excess of 200 percent in any given year. Such a
provision is different from a trigger in the traditional sense, as it could be either policy-induced
(e.g. by uncontrolled borrowing by the Government) or reflect exogenous shocks beyond the
Government's control (e.g. by a major terms of trade shock), A significant deterioration in debt
sustainability. should elicit a reduction of IDA lending, independent of the cause: However, the
response of the Bank to a debt sustamability crisis would be different depending on whether the
crisis was caused by exogenous or policy induced factors: in the case of a exogenous shock, the
Bank would make a strong effort to convince other donors to increase grant financing to Niger,
while a policy-induced detenoration of debt sustainability would warrant a more cautious
approach to Bank financing in general, and thus a low case lendmg scenario. While the Bank
would monitor debt sustainability indicators on an annual basis, the lead-time required for project
preparation make yearly adjustments of the lending program in response to the evolution of
NPVRs impractical. Instead such an adjustment would be made at the mid-point CAS review in
late FY04 (see para. 68).

The Bank's program supports the four pillars of the PRSP.' It seeks in particular to
address both the constraints of Niger's operational context and consequent human vulnerabilities
that loom large as the central challenges of development on which the success of the PRSP lies.
Under each pillar, the Bank will selectively provide assistance to reforms and expenditure
programs in different sectors. At the same time the Bank will support reforms in the three key
cross-cutting policy themes highlighted in the PRSP, i.e. gender, governance and stakeholder
participation.

Pillar 1: A macroeconomic framework ensuring economic
and financial stability while promoting sustainable and robust growth

52. 
Financial and fiduciary management will be a key focus of the Bank's program m
support of the PRSP. PEACs planned for FY03-FY04 will address capacity shortages in plannmng
and implementation of Government programs as well as in strengthening fiduciary control, both
at central and decentralized'levels, and this work will be continued under the FY05 PRSC. The
CAP will build financial capacity at the level of communities and communes (the key locus of
administration under the pending decentralization program). An IDF grant is financing the
implementation of a national procurement code and capacity building -for more effective and
transparent procurement administration at both the central and decentralized levels. Effectiveness
of this program will be reviewed via a CPAR to be conducted in FY04. A combined CFAA and
PER (undertaken in collaboration with the European Union) will look closely both at the
procedural and substantive usage issues connected with management of public funds for
development, and will provide the analytical bases for further capacity building support and the
public expenditure reform agenda in Bank-financed operations.

53. 
Supporting the privatization of state-owned enterprises and promoting an improved
environment for private sector investment. Niger's pnvatization program will continue with
emphasis on the remainmg large utilities in electricity generation and energy distribution, plus a
number of smaller state-owned operations in both the service and production sectors. A Private
Sector Assessment (including a review of the legal and judicial impediments 
to private
investment) will be carried out in FY05. Although IFC does not presently have on-going or
planned activities for Niger, it intends to field a mission later in FY03 with a view to exploring
opportunities for future operations in support of private sector development. Niger will need to

- 25 -

satisfy remaining requirements 
for full MIGA membership before MIGA guarantees can
contnbute to improving the prospects for increased foreign investment."

54. 
Reform and development of the financial sector. The financial sector reform project
will support far-reachmg reform of the banking and insurance sectors, re-establish the postal
savings system on a solvent footmg separate from the standard postal operation, and restructure
the currently semi-functioning national social secunty system. 
In achieving these goals, the
project will seek to improve the legal and institutional operating environment, re-structure state-
owned banks, build capacity for financial institution management, and will launch studies of
improved financing arrangements for SMEs, as well as of micro-credit institutions.

Pillar 2: The development of productive sectors, especially in rural areas,
to mitigate vulnerability and stimulate income generation

55. 
The Bank's support in this area will address Niger's high vulnerability to climatic
shocks and food insecurity as well as economic marginalization and exploitation with an
emphasis on irrigated agriculture focused on smallholders, non-farm income-generating activities
and cereal bank construction (via the CAP). The Private Irrgation Project follows upon a
successful pilot that introduced highly affordable irrigation technology for small-scale farmers,
along with technical and financial assistance targeting the poorest. The CAP will build capacity
in rural communities throughout Niger - m partnership with UTNDP, the French Development
Agency (AFD), the European Union, and various local and international NGOs - emphasizing
communities' capacity to plan, implement and monitor micro-development projects that focus on
social and productive infrastructure. Future support for agricultural services will aim to reduce
vulnerability and 
increase growth of smallholder agricultural production 
through targeted
research and extension on drought-resistant varieties, diversification into alternative crops, and
value-added post-harvest production.

56. 
Addressing environmental degradation. Bank support addresses rapid environmental
degradation via integration of the best practices developed 
in the recently closed Natural
Resources Management Project into the CAP, as well as mclusion of a substantial GEF-financed
environmental component. The CAP is also co-financed with a US$4 million GEF grant to
support local-level approaches to combat land and water degradation. The GEF will support two
sub-regional environmental management projects with major implications for Niger: the Niger
River Basm project, and the Lake Chad Basin project.

57. 
Increasing rural production and income-generating activity. The Agro-Pastoral
Export Promotion Project is helping producers of exportable crops and animal products
collectively invest in production and marketing so as to allow them to increase sales by putting
tools of transport, market information, storage and credit in their hands. With the PRSP as the
starting point, and a multi-donor approach including Bank support, refinement of a Rural
Development Strategy is underway. The Bank will take this strategy as its reference point for
additional focused AAA in FY04 that will identify further opportunities for selective Bank
intervention to improve conditions for the poorest rural producers, possibly in the FY05 PRSC.
Given the high prnority of rural roads, the Bank will undertake AAA with the goal of supporting

for its initial subscription to the capital stock of MIGA before becoming a full member.

- 26 -

Niger's formulation of a national roads infrastructure strategy, with the likelihood of at least
partial financing (most probably for rural roads construction and mamtenance) through the FY05
PRSC.

Pillar 3: Improvement in the access of the poor to quality social services,
including basic education, primary health care, reproductive health,
EIIV/AIDS prevention, water and sanitation, and adequate urban habitat

58. 
The Bank's support in this area directly targets Niger's human development
deficiencies and the vulnerabilities that result from them. It seeks to improve the delivery of
basic education and health, with particular emphasis on women and girls in both grant and lending
operations as well through AAA. And it directly tackles the ever-present threat of endemic
disease, both via support for national health strategies and for clean water and urban sanitation.
Both the FY04 PER/CFAA and FY04 Poverty AAA will help strengthen the poverty analysis
necessary for more poverty-focused design of Government policies and programs by: (i)
undertaking incidence analysis of public spending; (ii) assessmg the poverty / social impact of the
privatization and regulatory reform program; (iii) reviewing the gender dimensions of poverty;
and (iv) analyzing the key determinants of poverty for different groups. The Bank will also
undertake analytical work in FY05 to review household risk coping strategies and help the
government design a social protection strategy to help poor Nigeriens weather the shocks that are
a constant in the country's operating environment.

59. 
Primary education for all. Under the recently closed Primary Education Project, the
Bank financed the construction and staffing of primary schools across the country. Financial
support for the training and salaries of "volunteer" (non-civil service) teachers begun through this
project is continumg under the current PEAC. As Niger's proposal for the Education for All
Initiative (EFA-FTI) has been endorsed by donors, the Bank has taken stock of the financial,
administrative and human resource needs to help Niger achieve the education MDG, and this is
now a factor in multi-donor planning in support of its 10-year Plan for Education. Bank support
for education will combine a Basic Education Project (FY04) that will provide the intensive
support necessary to help Niger achieve the highly ambitious goals of the EFA-FTI, and program
support via the social services delivery component of the FY05 PRSC. The Project will be
designed to support expanded access to primary education, capacity building and improvements
in accountability, with the objective of shifting fully from project to programmatic support by the
end of the project. Support through the PRSC could provide for necessary recurrent costs such as
volunteer teacher salaries, as well as supporting the policy agenda; for example, in addressing
sector-wide reform issues identified in ESW on higher education (FY04).

60. Making health care accessible to the poor. The Bank's ongoing support for Niger's
health sector will be based upon its 10-year strategic plan, and designed in collaboration with the
multi-donor support group led by the WHO. As with education, the need to help Niger achieve
the MDG goals for health will require mtensive project assistance, combined with program
support through PRSCs. Program support (PEAC or PRSC) is expected to help finance priority
recurrent costs, such as salaries and training of health personnel m rural zones recruited under
Health II, following that project's closing. The Health III project (FY05) will focus on
performance-based management systems for decentralized health care administration, as well as
on increasing access and affordability for the poorest m line with MDG goals.

- 27 -

61. 
Population issues. Reproductive health and family planning remain extremely difficult
topics to address m the Nigerien cultural, socio-economic and religious context. The govemment
is nonetheless aware that continued unchecked population growth will preclude the achievement
of its poverty reduction objectives. To support the Government in developing an appropriate
strategy, sector work on population will be completed in FY03. It will also serve as the basis for
determining Bank support in this area via the planned health project and the FY05 PRSC.

62. 
Improving gender equity. One of the cross-cutting issues in the PRSP, the Bank
promotes gender equity in a number of its operations, including, via a focus on girl's education,
and in both the CAP and the MAP. The Bank is presently financmg via an IDF grant a project in
support of women's legal status, which generated legal texts and built the capacity of the Ministry
of Social Development to enforce women's nghts. Beginnig in FY04, the Bank will launch
AAA on gender issues to, inter alia, take stock of women's legal status and explore the best ways
of supporting gender-related reforms going forward, including via PRSC support for improved
social services. Through its support to the development of sectoral program budgets and an
MTEF, the Bank will also assist the Govemment m mcluding gender considerations in the design
and choice of public investments and expenditure programs.

63. 
Intensifying the fight against EIIV/AIDS. 
Following an intensive period of re-
structurmg and planning for a multi-sectoral approach to HIV/AIDS, and m close collaboration
with the multi-donor coalition centered in UNAIDS, the Bank will finalize a MAP operation later
in FY03. The Niger MAP builds upon a national HIV/AIDS strategy that provides for sectoral
plans which the Bank will selectively finance in collaboration with other donors. 
It will also
support ongoing capacity building, particularly withm the Ministry of Health, 
to deliver
preventive and post-diagnosis counseling and services; and will also support a comprehensive
national communications strategy emphasizing prevention.

64. 
Making water infrastructure accessible to the poor. The Water Sector Project will
continue supporting the delivery of water services and various regulatory and institutional
changes associated with water sector reform. The project will extend water mfrastructure to the
poorest urban and peri-urban areas where the poor presently pay significantly more for water than
the better-off areas served by the water network, and also contams a substantial component
addressing the needs of rural communities.

Pillar 4: Strengthening institutional and individual capacity within
and outside Government, at the central and local level

65. 
Improving capacity as a central operational imperative. Addressing Niger's capacity
gap is a central priority in all the Bank's work. At the level of general budget support, PEAC II
will both continue PEAC I's support for improving public finance and fiduciary capacity at the
central Government 
level, with 
the view to subsequently providing support for Niger's
administrative and fiscal decentralization. The CAP is primarily focused on building community-
level capacity for managing development processes, and also contams a sub-component for
building administrative and financial capacity at the commune level. Current and planned
sectoral operations all contain components m support of improved ministerial capacity; for
example the operations in support of health, education, infrastructure (urban, transport and water)
and the fight against HIV/AIDS provide substantial resources for staffing, training, statutory
reform, administrative restructuring and other aspects of capacity buildmg. The Bank provides

- 28 -

increasing support for buildmg capacity in the pnvate sector, for example via the Agro-pastoral
export promotion project, which reinforces capacity for private and collective non-governmental
initiatives in improved export production; or via the Private Irrigation Project, in which irrigation
technology is manufactured by local entrepreneurs with Bank-supported training and seed money.

66. 
The Bank's ESW program, including the PER/CFAA and CPAR scheduled duiing this
CAS period will be carried out in collaboration with Nigerien counterparts, and is intended to
serve as the underpinning for future capacity building support via PRSCs. The Niger Country
office administers a very active Small Grants Program that has as a major goal capacity building
in civil society organizations 
(women's organizations have been particularly 
important
In addition, WBI has provided a number of training opportunities, notably via
recipients). 
distance learning in recent years; the Bank will continue to make this available to Niger during
the CAS penod. Finally, the proposed shift to consolidated programmatic lending holds the
promise of creatmg sustamable capacity by using Niger's own institutions (budgetary, financial,
procurement) to channel the bulk of donor fundmg for development and poverty reduction.

Monitoring of Outcomes

67. 
Effective monitoring was discussed at length in Niger's PRSP, and is an absolute
necessity in any transition to consolidated programmatic 
lending. Analytical work under
preparation for the PRSP donors' forum will identify Niger's needs and recommend actions
which the Bank will consider supporting within the context of selectivity in overall donor
coordination. A broad range of performance indicators and targets are shown in the Country
Partnership Strategy Matrix (Annex 9), which is based on Niger's PRSP matrix. As shown in
Table 8, these are broadly consistent with the MDGs. The Bank, with other donors, will align its
operations in support of these indicators in order to ensure progress toward the MDG targets. The
fact that the numerical targets are generally below the MDGs for 2015 is in line with the MDG
concept, which recognizes that MDGs need to be adapted to country specific circumstances.
These discrepancies reflect Niger's low starting point and realistic outlook rather than a lack of
commitment or ambition.

68. 
Under the CAS, monitoring the Bank's effectiveness will take place at two levels: (i)
at the project level, the Bank will continue to strengthen project M&E frameworks to better
evaluate the effectiveness of specific operations in achieving desired outcomes; (ii) at the level of
the overall assistance program, the Bank will monitor how successfully the CAS supports PRSP
objectives, using the Country Partnership Strategy Matrix, and especially the core CAS
benchmarks shown in Table 9. At the mid-point of the CAS penod - in late FY04 - the Bank
will review the indicators and targets to assess progress in implementing the assistance program
and adjust the Bank's strategy as necessary. As explained in para. 50, this mid-point CAS review
will also be the occasion for a reassessment of the debt sustainability situation, with a view to
adjusting lendmg commitments if necessary in the remainder of the CAS period.

MANAGING RISKS

69. 
As described above, Niger presents an operating environment laden with risks. Working
towards the over-arching objective of sustainable poverty reduction, the Bank will assist the
country manage these risks via areas of intervention identified in the PRSP. With regard to the

- 31'-

Bank's program of lending, grants and AAA, there are several sets of risks that it needs to monitor
and seek to manage:

* Reform Slippage. The first risk is that Niger will backslide in the ongoing effort to develop
adequate management of public finances, and in structural reforms that include privatization,
procurement reform, and financial sector reform. 
The Bank presently does not foresee
significant slippage in these respects, but given the continued fragility of the political
situation, there remains the possibility of back-tracking as a purely political calculation or in
response to pressure from vested interests. Significant loss of momentum or reversal of
reforms would move the assistance program into a low case scenario.
* Governance Issues. A second area of risk is the possibility that poor govemance, including
corruption, political nepotism and poor policy implementation, would stand in the way of the
overall reform agenda as well as achievement of poverty-reducing sectoral goals from the
PRSP. A major area of attention within the broader development community is that of
fiduciary controls, and the Bank along with other donors -has made building capacity to
address problems m this area a high prionty. Significant deterioration of governance would
also be consistent with a low case scenario.
* Mobilization of internal and external support. A third- area of risk concems the
govemment's ability to maintain (in the case of Niger's population) and build (in the case of
some donors) ownership and support for the PRSP agenda. 
If the govemment cannot
mobilize adequate local ownership nor coordinated donor support for its general and sectoral
objectives, there will be little the Bank can achieve on its own.
Implementation 
issues. A fourth area of risk concems 
the govemment's limited
implementation capacity which may affect staying power in pursuing the PRSP agenda.
* Recurrent drought. The final major nsk is that of recurrent drought which could derail the
reform program and divert Niger's energies away from the longer-term poverty reduction
agenda. Through support for irrigated agriculture, the Bank is helping to mitigate this risk.

* 

VII. 

CONCLUDING REMARKS

70. 
A great deal is at stake for Niger over the next few years. The country has made
significant steps 
towards overcoming 
its past history of poor govemance and economic
mismanagement, and is beginnig to improve the economy's ability to weather the extemal
shocks to which it is so vulnerable. A great deal remains to be accomplished under the PRSP,
however, in order to make a significant impact on poverty and well-being. The Bank will fully
support Niger's strategy for poverty reduction and growth, and will strive to catalyze the support
of the broader donor community. A long-term and productive Bank relationship with Niger can
help restore hope to Niger's poor and confirm the Bank's commitment to fighting even the deepest
poverty in the harshest of.environments.

IMF Concludes 2001 Article IV Consultation with Niger

On February 8, 2002, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Niger.'

Background
With a per capita income of about US$200, Niger is one of the poorest countries in Africa and
is ranked very 
low on all social 
indicators. 
It is highly vulnerable 
to external and
weather-related shocks. Its main economic activities, agriculture and 
livestock, account
approximately for 40 percent of output, while the export base is limited to uranium, cattle and a
few agricultural products. Furthermore, Niger has suffered a series of social and political
upheavals over the last decade that hinrdered the implementation of reforms and economic
recovery measures. Since their election at end-1999, the authorities have been able to
reestablish economic, social, and political stability in the country. From negative 1.4 percent in
2000, the real GDP growth is estimated to reach 5.1 percent in 2001 as a result of good
climatic conditions. Inflation slowed to under 4 percent on average, and the external current
account deficit (excluding official transfers) is estimated to have widened slightly to around

' Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the

from 4.8 percent in 1999 to 2.9 percent in 2000, and is expected to have improved slightly in
2001 because of a better control of budgetary spending and an improved revenue collection.

Niger also made progress in implementing structural reforms. Progress in the reform of the
budgetary expenditure process, 
including 
the strengthening of budget execution and
monitoring, was supported by a new public expenditure credit of the World Bank. Concurrently
with the budgetary reforms, the authorities implemented in August 2001 a new pricing system
for petroleum products that is transparent, automatic, and flexible, and privatized in November
2001 the communications company, SONITEL. The authorities are committed to strengthening
external debt management and to keeping the momentum of the privatization program, in
particular, through divestiture from the energy and petroleum companies.

Niger is eligible for assistance under the enhanced HIPC Initiative and reached the decision
point in December 2000. Although the bulk of the debt relief will be delivered after reaching the
completion point under the Initiative, creditors (including Paris Club creditors, the World Bank,
and the International Monetary Fund, and the African Development Bank) provided interim
assistance under the HIPC 
lnitiative- of CFAF 8.8 billion in 2001 (SDR 9.5 million, or
0.6 percent of GDP). The resources freed under the HIPC Initiative were fully used for the
financing of a poverty reduction program that was launched at the initiative of the President of
Niger in 2001. The government has also prepared, through a large participatory process, a full
poverty reduction strategy paper (PRSP) approved-by a national workshop held in Niamey on
November 26-27, 2001.

Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed the satisfactory macroeconomic outcome for 2001, including a
rebound of economic growth to about 5 percent, and a reduction of year-on-year inflation to
less than 4 percent. Program slippages identified in early 2001 had been rectified and the
program had been brought back on track at end-September 2001. Directors were encouraged
by the additional measures taken to ensure the achievement of the program objectives at end-
2001, despite delays in budgetary assistance disbursements.

Directors 
regretted 
the 
temporary 
resurgence of external payment arrears 
at
end-September 2001 and the suspension of the petroleum product pricing system in October
2001. They welcomed the authorities' commitments to reinforce debt management and ensure
the continuous implementation of the petroleum product pricing system, which resumed in
November 2001. They urged the authorities to avoid stop-and-go policies, stay the course on
structural reforms, and strengthen Niger's institutional capacity.

Directors endorsed the authorities's economic and financial program for 2002, which aims to
consolidate further the fiscal stance through higher revenue, while stepping up implementation
of the poverty reduction strategy. They urged the authorities to reduce domestic payments
arrears in 2002 with a view to revitalizing the private sector and strengthening confidence in
the public sector. They welcomed the authorities' intention to strengthen treasury management
further and to establish an appropriate level of precautionary cash balances, in order to limit
the vulnerability of government spending to the timing of foreign aid disbursements. At the

Annex 1 1
Page 3 of 4

same time, Directors urged Niger's development partners to make timely, better coordinated,
and full delivery of external project and budgetary assistance pledges, to avoid treasury
cash-flow problems and program curtailments.

Directors observed, that Niger's balance of payments should remain sustainable over the
rnedium term if adequate international support were provided.-They urged the authorities to
implement a prudent external debt management policy and 
to' continue seeking the
participation and contribution of non-Paris Club bilateral creditors under the enhanced HIPC
Initiative.

Directors noted that Niger's competitiveness has been maintained in the context of the
institutional arrangement of the Franc zone. They welcomed the prudent monetary policy
conducted at the regional level by the Central Bank of the West African States. Directors
encouraged the authorities to continue their efforts to comply with the convergence criteria set
under the pact of the West African Economic and Monetary Union.

Directors urged the authorities to maintain their structural- reform agenda, particularly the
privatization program, and to implement without delay the reforms to strengthen the financial
system, 
in collaboration with the World Bank. The ongoing reforms - of the budgetary
expenditure process and the treasury operations should be deepened to improve governance
and strengthen management of.- public finances, and to ensure satisfactory expenditure
monitoring and tracking in the context of the poverty reduction strategy. The authorities are
encouraged to enhance their efforts to combat money laundering and 
the financing of
terrorism.

Directors welcomed the finalization of the PRSP, which has been based on an intensive
participatory process, and agreed -with the thrust of-the joint staff assessment of the PRSP.
The strategy provided a credible framework for poverty reduction.

Directors stressed the need to address the serious weaknesses in Niger's statistical database,
notably with respect to national accounts, balance of payments and external debt statistics.
They welcomed the authorities' decision to follow the guidance provided for compiling and
disseminating macroeconomic and socio-demographic data under the Fund's General Data
Dissemination Standard.

Directors commended the authorities for the vigorous measures taken to bring the Poverty
Reduction and Growth Facility-supported program back on track during the second half of
2001. All of the program targets were met at end-September 2001, except for a small
accumulation of external payments arrears that was corrected by end-2001. Directors also
welcomed 
the measures 
taken by 
the authorities 
to ensure satisfactory program
implementation at end-2001, despite delays in budgetary aid disbursements.

Directors endorsed the economic and financial program for 2002, and noted that the 2002
budget is consistent with the newly established poverty reduction strategy. They encouraged
the authorities 
to 
focus on 
improving 
the business enVironment and private sector
development. Progress in these areas, as well as the reform of the financial sector, would

Annex 11

complement sound financial and external debt policies, and help to create the necessary
conditions for achieving higher levels of economic growth and an effective reduction of poverty
in Niger.

Public /nfonnation Notices (PINs) are issued, (i) at the request of a member country, following the

Niger: IDA Lending and Debt Sustainability

1. Niger's fragile external financing situation
In terms of debt sustainability, Niger is one of the most fragile countries among the group having
acceded to the Enhanced HIPC Initiative. At end-1999, Niger's outstanding and disbursed debt
was estimated at US$1.6 billion in nominal terms or about 80 percent of that year's GDP. The
net present value (NPV) of this debt stock was equivalent to 322 percent of exports (after
traditional debt relief), well above the sustainability threshold of 150 percent determined in the
framework of the Enhanced HIPC Initiative.

The provision of HIPC assistance has an important effect on the sustainability of Niger's external
debt. Niger reached the Decision Point in December 2000 and has since been receiving interim
debt relief under the HIPC initiative from several multilateral and bilateral creditors. By
participating in the initiative, Niger will receive US$521 million of debt relief in NPV terms, or
about US$890 million in nominal terms. 
IDA's contribution to HIPC debt relief is US$302
million in nominal terms over 20 years. Niger's Completion Point is scheduled for mid-2003,
slightly later than originally envisaged in the Decision Point document (2002). According to the
latest projections, enhanced HIPC assistance and bilateral assistance beyond HIPC would reduce
the NPV of the debt-to-export ratio (NPVR) significantly, to 167 percent in 2003, down from 344
percent for the same year after traditional debt relief mechanisms. While this constitutes a
significant reduction, the ratio would still increase until 2007 (168 percent) and only fall below
150 percent in 2015. This means that even after full HIPC assistance delivery at the Completion
Point, Niger's external financing situation will remain fragile.

The Decision Point baseline scenario has recently been updated with revised projections for
exports. The revision took into account actual export performance in 1999, 2000 and 2001 and
revised export projections in the period 2002-2007, based on new information on the evolution of
prices and volumes of Niger's main export products. Parallel to the relatively strong economic
performance after 2000, exports have recovered faster than expected at Decision Point from their
low point in 1999. This resulted in export projections that are higher than the ones presented in
the Decision Point document for 2000 to 2005, but lower than Decision Point projections from
2006 onwards. The update of the Decision Point scenario also took into account additional
bilateral debt relief beyond HIPC, which has a significant effect on the NPVRs. The net effect of
updating the Decision Point scenario is as follows: 
the NPVR in 2002 is reduced to 167 percent
as compared to 190 percent in the original scenario, stays below its trajectory until 2009, after
which it rises slightly above it. As can be seen from the scenario in figure 1 that assumes a lower
growth rate from 2008 onwards, these projections are very sensitive to assumptions about changes
in export growth.

2. Financing PRSP implementation vs. debt sustainability

Niger's fragile external financing position imposes important limitations on borrowing in the
future, even if all new borrowing is contracted on highly concessional terms 2 . This stands in
strong contrast 
to Niger's very 
large external 
financing 
requirements associated with
implementing its economic and social reforms. In the absence of a fully developed MTEF, it is
not yet possible to assess in detail the medium term financing requirements for implementing the
PRSP. However, there is no doubt that Niger will have to mobilize large amounts of additional
resources if it is to successfully implement its poverty reduction strategy and make significant
progress towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals. Given its limited potential for
raising these resources domestically, Niger will require sustained high levels of external financing
in the foreseeable future.
The political instability and widespread mismanagement of public resources in the 1990s had
practically disconnected Niger from most sources of external financing. Although the current
Government has managed to establish a respectable reform track record since taking office in
2000, donors have been returning to Niger only gradually. Financing since then has been limited
and unpredictable. As a result, IDA has been the principal source of adjustment support since
2000. Prospects for increased levels of financial support have however improved since the

' The updated Decision Point scenario and all simulations presented in this CAS do not take into account
revised figures on new borrowing other than IDA, nor the evolution of exchange rates and discount rates.
Given the sensitivity of the NPVR to these factors, the results of the full DSA that will be conducted for the
HIPC Completion Point document may be significantly different.
2 The PRGF program has set a concessionality requirement that limits new borrowing to loans with a grant
element of at least 50 percent.

Annex 13
Page 3 of 5

completion of the PRSP. Together with ongoing efforts to improve fiduciary controls and public
finance management, the existence of a comprehensive poverty reduction strategy increases the
potential effectiveness of external support. The Government intends to use the PRSP to mobilize
additional resources and plans for this purpose to convene a donors' forum on PRSP
implementation in February 2003. As discussed below, it will be crucial that the bulk of external
financing mobilized through these efforts take the form of grants, in order not to jeopardize
Niger's long-term debt sustainability.

3. 
Impact of new IDA lending
In light of the limited support from other donors and of the relatively high levels of IDA lending
in the past three years, the provision of new IDA financing under the CAS lending program could
have a significant impact on debt sustainability. Although the proposed lending commitment in
the base case is in line with IDA's performance based allocation process, debt sustainability
concerns have been central in the determination of the CAS lending scenarios. For this purpose, a
simulation was conducted to compare the proposed lending commitments with the updated
Decision Point scenario. The results show that in order to return to NPVR levels similar to those
in the updated Decision Point scenario by the end of the CAS period, IDA lending commitments

would have to be reduced to around US$124 million in the period 2003 - 20053. However,
restricting base case lending in such a radical way would (in light of the current pipeline) mean

stopping financial commitments to Niger after FY04, an overly harsh stance for the Bank's
relationship with one of the poorest countries on earth that has been making overall satisfactory

progress on its reform program. In addition, the sensitivity of the NPVR to short-term changes in

export performance suggests that it would not be appropriate to rigidly link the base case lending

volumes to the updated Decision Point projections. Indeed the fact that the updated NPVRs have
improved relative to those in the original Decision Point scenario underscores the importance of
allowing some flexibility in response to cyclical changes in export performance. In light of these

considerations, the Bank would plan to make base case lending commitments to Niger up to a
maximum of US$238 million as long as NPVRs remain below 200 percent. The original

Decision Point scenario projected a trajectory of the NPVR that peaked at 190 in 2003, and the
200 percent threshold would therefore ensure that new IDA lending during the CAS period would
not result in a deterioration relative to the early period in that scenario. Nonetheless, NPVRs
would be expected to evolve in a downward direction by the end of the CAS period in the
absence of a major external shock.

3 This is based on the following assumptions: a) a disbursement rate of 33.8 percent (corresponds to
average rate in 2000-02), b) all CAS lending/grant commitments disbursed over 5 years, c) US$25 million
as grants for HIV/AIDS project, plus 29 percent of remaining commitments as grants over the CAS period.

NB: All lending scenarios take into account IDA 13 grant allocations.

A simulation was conducted to examine the impact of a full commitment of base (US$238
million) and high case (US$260 million) lending envelopes on debt sustainability in comparison
to the updated Decision Point scenario. As Figure 2 shows, at no point do the NPVR trajectories
resulting from base and high case lending approach the 200 percent ceiling, even though
committing the full base case lending volume in the CAS period would result in NPVRs higher
than those in the updated Decision Point scenario. The projected increases are nonetheless,
moderate: with base case lending, attainment of the 150 percent threshold would be postponed by
4 years (2018) relative to the updated Decision Point scenario (2014) and the average NPVR of
166 percent for the period 2003 - 2018 would be only slightly higher than the corresponding 157
percent average from the updated Decision Point scenario.

4. Impact of grant financing on Debt Sustainability
The prospect of converting a part of IDA financing into grants in the IDA 13 period has a
potentially positive effect on the sustainability of Niger's external finance situation. According to
the IDA grants guidelines, Niger can receive up to 40 percent of its IDA allocation for the IDA 13
period (FY03-05) in grants, due to its status as a debt vulnerable country4 . However, only the
grant share for IDA commitments in FY03 has been determined at this stage. It is equivalent to
100 percent of the financing for the HIV/AIDS operation (US$25 million), plus an additional
US$17 million (approximately) for the remaining program. Figure 3 shows the impact of
providing a portion of IDA financing through grants on debt sustainability 5 .
If no IDA grants
were available, the average NPV over the period 2002-2018 would increase from 166 percent to
173 percent in the base case scenario and the 150 percent threshold would not be reached even in
2018.

4 "IDA grants: Implementation Guidelines and Allocation (FY03)", FRM/OPCS, September 17,2002
5 It is assumed here that the 29 percent grant component in the IDA allocation as determined in FY03
would be maintained over the IDA 13 period.

5. Managing debt sustainability

The Government of Niger is committed to long-term debt sustainability and to progressively
reducing its dependence on external financing. For this purpose, it needs to mobilize more
domestic resources and attract larger amounts of grant financing. Despite recent efforts to
enhance the internal resource base, Government revenue still remains at around 10 percent of
GDP. Through 
its ongoing efforts 
to strengthen 
the fiduciary framework and enhance
transparency and the effectiveness of public spending, Niger has started to improve conditions for
more effective use of external assistance. In addition, the completion of the PRSP has equipped
the Government with a comprehensive strategy to improve the provision of social services and
promote economic growth. Successful implementation of the PRSP can help Niger make
progress towards the Millennium Development Goals, although further refinement of the strategy
is necessary. The Government is working to translate the PRSP into fully costed sectoral
strategies and to develop a comprehensive Medium Term Expenditure Framework based on these
strategies. This would create a framework that is conducive to attracting additional external
financing. The assistance of the donor community in the implementation of the PRSP is
indispensable, both in the form of financial resources as well as technical assistance. 
It is
essential that this assistance takes the form of substantial and predictable grant financing, in order
not to jeopardize Niger's long-term external financing position.
As demonstrated above, Niger's debt sustainability is highly sensitive to export shocks. To avoid
such shocks in the future or smoothen their impact, Niger needs to strengthen and diversify its
export base, which is now predominantly composed of agricultural and livestock products, and
the stagnating uranium sector. However, due to important capacity and resource constraints, the
stronger growth and export performance that Government aims to achieve through implementing
the PRSP might materialize only 
in the medium term. Nevertheless, the Government is
committed to exploring ways of boosting export growth and will assess the export potential of
different sectors in its forthcoming study on sources of growth.
