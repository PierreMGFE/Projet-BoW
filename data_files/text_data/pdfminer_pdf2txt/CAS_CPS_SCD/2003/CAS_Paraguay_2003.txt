Country Assistance Strategy f o r the Republic o f Paraguay 

Execu t ive S umm a r y 

Paraguay i s emerging f r om a prolonged pe r iod o f economic stagnation that has 
l e f t i t s popu la t ion impoverished. D u r i n g this period, Bank lend ing was l o w due to poor 
po r t fo l io performance, economic management and governance. The Adm in is t ra t ion o f 
President N icano r Duarte Frutos, w h i c h took o f f ice in August o f 2003, i s determined to 
reverse this negative trend and i s bu i ld ing a coa l i t ion o f p o l i t i c a l parties t o f igh t 
corruption and introduce significant economic reforms. The Government has reques ted 
active support f r om the international community, inc lud ing the W o r l d Bank . This CAS 
presen ts the Bank’s strategy fo r re-engagement w i t h Paraguay. 

Paraguay’s economy stagnated du r ing the past f i v e years, with per capita incomes 
fa l l ing by 15 percent in l o c a l currency te rms , and f r om U S $ l 8 10 t o U S $ 1 170 as 
measured by the W o r l d B a n k Atlas methodology. Poverty stood at 34 pe rcen t o f the 
popu la t ion in 2001 and i s n o w likely to be higher. M u c h o f the decline in per capita 
income i s due t o economic t u rm o i l in the southern cone, w h i c h resu l ted in significant 
devaluations f o r a l l countries in the region. But pove r ty increased in Paraguay also as a 
resu l t o f p o l i t i c a l ins tab i l i ty , drift in economic po l ic ies and the ine f f ic ienc ies o f a h igh ly 
in fo rma l and corrupt system. D u r i n g this period, pub l ic finances weakened s ign i f ican t ly 
and, until lately, the Government has been unable to stay current with salaries, pensions 
and debt service. 

The p o l i t i c a l s i tua t ion stabilized du r ing 2003 with the e lec t ion o f President Duarte 
Frutos o n a campaign t o fight co r rup t ion and imp rove economic management, with an 
emphasis o n social and f isca l responsibility. The Government’s development strategy 
aims at (i) a recovery o f confidence in state institutions th rough a sustained f igh t against 
corruption and the mode rn iza t ion o f pub l ic administration; (ii) sustainable g row th 
through a change in the economic mode l f r om triangular trade and p u b l i c employment 
towards agro-industry and export diversification; and (iii) an increase in human capital 
through higher investment in health and education and po l ic ies that enhance equity and 
increase access t o these services. 

A l though the p o l i t i c a l opposition controls one house o f Congress, a l l parties agree 
that the economy has reached a breaking po in t and that fundamental changes are needed. 
The President has capitalized o n this situation by s t r ik ing an agreement with a l l po l i t ica l 
parties to approve a package o f core economic re fo rms o n a p r i o r i t y basis. These include 
a fundamental tax reform, ra t iona l iza t ion o f the government pension system, and 
financial sector re fo rms t o strengthen the banking system. These laws have been 
prepared by a qua l i ty economic team and sen t to Congress. Assum ing approval o f these 
reforms, economic g r ow t h cou ld reach 3 .5 pe rcen t per annum (about one pe rcen t per 
capita) b y 2007. 

V 

O n the strength o f these reforms, the Adm in is t ra t ion approached mu l t i la te ra l and 
domestic creditors f o r support. I t has already reached h is to r ic agreements with domestic 
bond holders to reschedule the Treasury b i l l stock and with the IMF o n a Standby 
Arrangement, the f i r s t in 46 years, w h i c h i s scheduled to be considered by the IMF Boa rd 
o n December 15,2003. 

The proposed Bank assistance strategy i s c lose ly aligned with the Government’s 
development objectives. Overall, the strategy aims t o restore confidence in the economy 
and l a y the basis fo r sustainable g r ow t h and pove r ty reduction. T o this end, the C A S 
supports (i) the f isca l and f inanc ia l reforms the Adm in is t ra t ion has sen t to Congress; (ii) 
imp roved governance and transparency in pub l ic administration; (iii) sustained growth, 
pa r t icu la r ly in the r u r a l areas where pove r ty i s concentrated and deepest; and (iv) social 
inclusion, t o imp rove the coverage and e f f ic iency o f basic social services to help 
Paraguay m e e t the millennium development goals. 

The proposed base case lending p rog ram f o r FY04-07 i s f o r US$325 m i l l ion , o f 
w h i c h US$SO m i l l i o n , o r about 25 percent, a re envisaged fo r tw o adjustment operations, 
the proposed economic recovery loan to support s tab i l iza t ion o f p u b l i c finances and he lp 
finance the Government’s immediate f inanc ing needs, and a subsequent f inanc ia l sector 
loan to strengthen the bank ing system. The re fo rms t o be supported by b o t h operations 
are essential fo r sustaining recently regained macroeconomic s tab i l i ty . An appropriate 
macroeconomic f ramewo rk i s cu r ren t ly in place fo r these loans. In addition, the base 
case p rog ram includes investment projects that contribute t o ach iev ing the Government’s 
development objectives in the areas o f governance and pub l ic administration, economic 
g r ow t h and social inc lus ion . 

The proposed Bank strategy recognizes the actions the new Adm in is t ra t ion has 
taken to con f ron t corruption, tighten con t ro l over i t s finances and build a p o l i t i c a l 
consensus f o r impo r tan t economic reforms. The strategy i s neve r the less mindful o f the 
l o n g h is to ry o f p o l i t i c a l d i f f icu l t ies and the lack o f ins t i tu t iona l capacity that has hindered 
r e f o rm e f fo r ts in the past. In this high-risk / h igh - rewa rd situation, the Bank’s r e - 
engagement strategy i s based o n clear performance criteria, and new commitments w i l l 
be proposed o n l y in l i n e with the Adm in is t ra t ion ’s progress in building a credible track 
reco rd o f economic management and re fo rm . 

Paraguay’s con t inua t ion in the base case scenario w i l l be subject to satisfactory 
progress o n a se t o f key triggers fo r p u b l i c administration, f isca l and f inanc ia l sector 
reforms, and p o r t f o l i o implementation. In the event these triggers are n o t met, the 
lending p rog ram w o u l d r e v e r t to a se t o f core investments aimed t o support the 
millennium development goals. L o w case lending w o u l d be limited t o US$120 m i l l i o n , 
about one - th i rd o f the base case amount. High case lend ing cou ld be possible in the 
second h a l f o f the C A S period, after the Adm in is t ra t ions builds a sustained track reco rd 
and has taken inc remen ta l actions that w o u l d ind ica te the p robab i l i ty o f faster economic 
g row th . 

v i 

The p r inc ipa l risk o f the proposed strategy i s that the r e f o rm p rog ram cou ld go o f f 
track soon after an increase in Bank exposure has occurred. This risk i s m i t iga ted by the 
strength o f the p o l i t i c a l consensus the new Adm in is t ra t ion has fo rmed and the fact that i t 
i s w i l l i n g to u s e i t s p o l i t i c a l capital at the beginning o f i t s t e r m when i t i s strongest. The 
Bank’s strategy aims to manage the risk o f p o l i t i c a l backtracking th rough up f ron t p o l i c y 
actions t o the adjustment operations, fo r example, the approval o f a bank ing reso lu t ion / 
savings deposit l a w w h i c h i s scheduled f o r approval by Congress p r i o r t o B o a r d 
consideration o f this CAS . 

Other risks fac ing the p rog ram inc lude attempts by vested i n t e r e s t s t o b l o c k the 
Adm in is t ra t ion ’s so-far p roduc t ive campaign against tax evasion and corruption. The 
best strategy against such threats i s firm support t o an Adm in is t ra t ion that recognizes the 
need to rega in international c red ib i l i ty and that can use such support as a evidence o f the 
pos i t ive resu l ts i t s an t i -co r rup t ion e f fo r ts can b r i n g t o Paraguay. In addition, there are 
imp lemen ta t ion r i s k s o f manag ing a larger po r t fo l io o f projects w h i c h w i l l need t o be 
managed ca re fu l ly th roughou t the C A S period. The Adm in is t ra t ion ’s dec is ion to se t up a 
central unit f o r manag ing a l l external assistance i s a welcome step towards im p r o v i n g 
imp lemen ta t ion capacity, as are the p r inc ip les fo r p o r t f o l i o management that were agreed 
during the last CPPR and a re presented in Annex 2. F ina l ly , paymen t risk t o the B a n k i s 
also noteworthy, in view o f the th ree m o n t h suspension o f disbursements earlier this year 
du r ing the p rev ious administration. This risk w i l l diminish t o the ex ten t the proposed tax 
and pension r e f o rm laws are approved and implemented. 

The p lanned assistance program, i f implemented in support o f strong policies, 
together with support f r om other external partners, w o u l d help se t the coun t ry o n a new 
development path. Ind ica t ive outcomes are presented in the C A S P rog ram M a t r i x . Some 
o f the highlights o f these indicators are: 

0 A sounder f inanc ia l sector that w o u l d lowe r the cost o f po ten t ia l bank failures and 
p rov ide a sounder basis fo r the mob i l iza t ion o f domestic savings; 

0 

Im p r o v e d transparency and governance in pub l ic administration, especially in the 
Ministry o f Finance w h i c h cou ld act as a mode l f o r other ministries t o f o l l ow ; 

Imp roved p r o d u c t i v i t y in the r u r a l sector, as evidenced by the scaling up t o the 
na t iona l l e v e l o f an imp roved extension mode l based o n commun i ty pa r t ic ipa t ion 
and imp roved so i l management techniques by 2007; and 

0 Gradual imp rovemen t in social indicators, as evidenced by an increase in the 
secondary school enrolment rate f r om 3 3 percent t o 42 percent by 2007, inc lud ing 
a na r row ing o f the u rban - ru ra l divide, and decreases in the i n f a n t and maternal- 
m o r t a l i t y rates by 10 percent by 2007.

MEMORANDUM OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE IBRD 
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A 
COUNTRY ASSISTANCE STRATEGY 
OF THE WORLD BANK 
FOR THE 
REPUBLIC OF PARAGUAY 

Introduction 

1 . 

The last CAS f o r Paraguay was discussed in April 1997. I t s m a i n objectives were 
pove r ty reduc t ion and state re fo rm . I t recommended a p rog ram o f 1-2 projects per year 
up to about US$50 m i l l i o n per annum, p rov ided that Paraguay ma in ta ined an acceptable 
l e v e l o f p ro jec t performance ( less than 25 percent p rob lem projects) and a budget de f ic i t 
under 2 percent o f GDP. The 1997 CAS built o n a steadily increasing p o r t f o l i o o f 
projects during the p reced ing five years, during w h i c h nine investment operations were 
approved f o r a to ta l o f US$350 m i l l i o n and w h i c h f o l l ow e d an eight year hiatus in 
lend ing ( f r om 1984-1 9 9 2 ) during the f i n a l years o f the Stroessner dictatorship. ' 

2 . 

In the event, coun t ry -Bank relations deteriorated considerably subsequent t o the 
last CAS . In early-1998, the Government fa i led t o complete negotiations fo r an urban 
project due t o p o l i t i c a l in-fighting. La te r that year, the Reg ion suspended preparation o f 
new projects due t o the Government 's non-compliance with i t s soc ia l obligations 
associated with the Yacy re ta Hyd roe lec t r ic Project.2 P rob lem projects increased to 50 
percent o f the po r t fo l io , and in 1999 the Government f l ip - f lopped in i t s pos i t ion regarding 
the conversion o f a fa i led sewage p ro jec t in to a veh ic le fo r p r i v a t i z i n g the water and 
telephone companies. As a resu l t , the Reg ion downscaled the resident m iss ion that had 
been established in 1998 t o a l ia ison o f f ice . Po r t fo l io performance nevertheless began to 
imp rove in 2000 , and spec i f ic sector conditions permitted the app rova l o f t w o new loans 
fo r commun i ty development and education during the past year and a ha l f . A turn- 
around in coun t ry re la t ions n o w appears t o be occu r r ing with the recent change o f 
government in August 2003.

dec l ine , a new Adm in is t ra t ion took o f f ice in August 2003 that seems t o have strong 
leg i t imacy and willingness t o se t the country o n a different development path. 

4. 

President N icano r Duarte Frutos i s the f i r s t President o f the post-Stroessner era to 
be elected w i thou t questions o f leg i t imacy . A lso f o r the f i r s t time, the President was able 
to p i c k a V i c e President o f his o w n choosing, rather than hav ing t o accept a r i v a l f r om 
within the long - ru l ing Colorado Party. This comb ina t ion i s p r o v i n g t o be a mo re 
cohesive Executive, especially in i t s relations with Congress, and should imp rove the 
effectiveness o f pub l ic administration. 

5 . 

President Duarte ran o n a p la t fo rm o f f igh t ing co r rup t ion and imp rov ing the 
e f f ic iency o f the pub l ic sector. H e i s perceived b y the pub l ic t o be personally comm i t ted 
to these goals and has made a credible s t a r t by m a k i n g a pub l ic disclosure o f his personal 
assets, along with requ i r ing the same o f a l l o f his cabinet. In addition, President Duarte 
has made widely-respected appointments o f several non-Colorado Party members t o 
important positions in the Cabinet, inc lud ing the Ministers o f Finance and Industry. 
These moves have earned i n i t i a l g o o dw i l l among the popu la t ion as well as with the 
opposition parties. 

6. 

The p o l i t i c a l balance o f powe r also changed as a result o f the 2003 elections. Fo r 
the f i r s t time, oppos i t ion parties w o n a clear m a j o r i t y in the Senate, and the Colorado 
Party no longer has an absolute h o l d o n power. M a k i n g virtue o f necessity, President 
Duarte has fo rmed a w o r k i n g alliance with the oppos i t ion that culminated in early 
October with the s ign ing o f a p o l i t i c a l accord (Acuerdo Po l i t ico ) in w h i c h a l l parties in 
Congress agreed t o pass six ma jo r pieces o f legislation, inc lud ing a f isca l ly responsible 
budget, r e f o rm o f the tax code and o f government pensions, a mode rn customs code, 
financial sector reforms, inc lud ing the pub l ic banks, and an eventual restructuring o f 
pub l ic en te rp r ises and the central administration. These proposed laws, mos t o f which 
have already been sen t t o the Congress, are discussed further in Section 11. 

7. 

In general, the oppos i t ion has pledged i t s willingness to cooperate in p a d i n g these 
laws that a re widely acknowledged as needed to restore fiscal v i a b i l i t y and to restart the 
economy. Indeed, the mos t challenging opposition t o these re fo rms i s likely to come 
f r om within the Colorado Party, whose members have benefited du r ing tw o generations 
f r om the ex is t ing economic structures. 

8. 

The President and the oppos i t ion have also comm i t ted t o change a large pa r t o f 
the Supreme Court, w h i c h i s widely viewed as a source o f co r rup t ion and impunity. As

against another t h r e e have been introduced by a coa l i t ion o f a l l p o l i t i c a l pa r t ies in the 
Congress. The outcome o f this process i s no t yet certain. Yet, the “cleansing o f the 
Court” i s widely supported by the popu la t ion and i s viewed as a necessary cond i t ion fo r

Over the past f i v e years, c i v i l society has become increasingly active and has been 
clamoring fo r better govemance and public administration. The press , in particular, has 
been a ma jo r c r i t ic exposing co r rup t ion in government and the jud ic ia ry . Experiments in 
pub l ic pa r t ic ipa t ion in the fo rmu la t ion o f laws have occurred, such as those fostered by 
the Na t iona l In teg r i ty Counc i l (anticorruption commission) that was established with 
WB I assistance (see Part 111). There i s a constant and g row ing demand f o r 
decentralization o f government services and decision-making. In general, the pub l ic i s 
awakening after a l o n g pe r iod o f submission and non -c r i t ica l behavior that was 
characteristic o f the 3 5 years o f the Stroessner dictatorship, du r ing w h i c h education and 
economic freedoms were la rge ly ignored, i f no t s t i f led . 

10. 

Yet, the ve ry disappointing economic performance o f the past decade has taken i t s 
t o l l o n the c red ib i l i ty o f Government and public institutions overall. As reported in the 
f o l l ow i n g box, there i s an increased long ing fo r a retum to authoritarian rule under which 
corruption was perceived t o be no t so widespread and poverty was l e s s overt with a large 
ma jo r i ty o f the popu la t ion s t i l l l i v i n g in the ru ra l areas. As a resu l t , the emerging 
vibrancy o f c i v i l society i s vulnerable to domestic po l i t ica l even ts that are n o t predictable 
and that present a threat t o the continuation o f democratic ins t i tu t ions i f there i s no t an 
improvement in economic and social conditions, as well as governance.

The present thus rep resen ts a p o i n t o f in f lec t ion f o r Paraguay, when sound 
economic po l ic ies and honest leadership can pull the country ou t o f i t s p ro longed 
economic stagnation and f o r t i f y democratic tendencies, o r where fa i lu re o n this f ron t 
cou ld lead Paraguay back to mo re undemocratic structures. The i n i t i a l s teps taken by the 
Duarte Adm in is t ra t ion constitute a clear break with the p o l i t i c a l practices o f the past. 
There are clear signs f o r op t im ism in t e r m s o f the a b i l i t y o f the Adm in is t ra t ion t o restore 
the trust and credibility o f the p u b l i c in the in teg r i ty and effectiveness o f government.

The continuation o f these efforts w i l l determine whether Paraguay has entered in to a 
virtuous cycle that w i l l enhance i t s capacity to overcome the serious governance 
shortcomings that have plagued previous Administrations and that have s t i f l e d i t s 
development efforts. 

Governance and Institutional Weaknesses 

12. 

Paraguay i s renowned fo r corruption and contraband. Perceptions o f co r rup t ion 
have increased du r ing the past decade, such that the “controlled” co r rup t ion o f the 
Stroessner dictatorship has been “democratized” with many sharing the spoils, no t just 
the top. Transparency International consistently ranks Paraguay among the t e n most 
corrupt  nation^.^ The IMF has estimated tax evasion, in particular customs and VAT, at 
60 percent o f taxes due. A W o r l d Bank Institute survey o f pub l ic op in ion identified 
Customs and the Judiciary among the most corrupt institutions in the country. 

13. 

As discussed in the 1996 Bank report, “Role o f the State,”4 Paraguayan 
institutions have h i g h l y developed the art o f rent seeking. The base o f the system i s the 
patronage po l i t ics o f the Colorado Party, w h i c h “nominates” pa r ty f a i t h f u l t o pub l ic 
institutions. This system contributes s ign i f ican t ly t o ma in ta in ing a w o r k i n g ma jo r i ty o f 
votes fo r the Party among the general popu la t ion and creates a strong incentive against 
“reform o f the state,” in particular, the p r iva t iza t ion o f public en te rp r ises . 5 

14. While pub l ic entities do no t dominate the economy, they neve r the less occupy 
important segments, inc lud ing the electricity, telephone, water, cement and o i l impo r t 
companies, as well as the social security (pension and health) system and the national 
university. Aside f r om employment (about one - th i rd o f the to ta l public sector), these 
en t i t ies p rov ide the oppo r tun i ty fo r corruption th rough the widespread abuse o f pub l ic 
procurement, false b i l l i n g and poo r internal controls. A large number o f pub l ic banks 
existed until 1998 -99 , but mos t o f these f e l l in to bankruptcy as the r e s u l t o f the under- 
collateralization o f loans la rge ly financed with public funds, especially f r om the social 
security system. At present, the re remains on ly one pub l ic bank, the Banco Nacional de 
Fomento, w h i c h i s techn ica l ly insolvent but su rv iv ing f r om day to day. 

15. 

A beg inn ing has been made t o attack the pervasiveness o f a corrupt culture in 
pub l ic administration. In 1999 , an anti-corruption comm iss ion was formed with the 
technical support o f the W o r l d Bank Institute. The commission comprised an equal 
number o f government and c i v i l society representatives. Based o n the r e s u l t s o f the WB I 
survey o f pub l ic opinion, the Commission decided t o concentrate o n t h r e e areas -- 
customs, the j u d i c i a r y and public procurement. The Comm iss ion developed a program o f 
ins t i tu t iona l reforms f o r each area du r ing 2000 and, f o l l ow i n g a pe r iod o f pub l ic 
consultation, has b e e n ac t ive ly p romo t ing the adop t ion o f these re fo rms since then. The 
m a i n achievement o f the Comm iss ion to date has been shepherding the approval o f a new 
procurement l a w th rough Congress and ra is ing awareness within Government and the

pub l ic at large that concrete steps can be taken to reduce the ins t i tu t iona l opportunities fo r 
corruption. The Commission, w h i c h i s n o w k n ow n as the Na t iona l In teg r i ty Council, has 
thus become an impo r tan t agent fo r change that i s mon i to r ing and pressing f o r imp roved 
pub l ic po l ic ies and practices to reduce corruption. 

16. 

Co r rup t ion i s n o t the on ly ins t i tu t iona l weakness in Paraguay, however. The basic 
management systems o f government are also weak. Fo r example, the social security 
system has been run as an autonomous agency w i thou t transparency and o n l y recently 
has begun to p rov ide in fo rma t ion o n i t s financial accounts to the Ministry o f Finance. 
Within the central administration, the personnel management system i s at an embryonic 
stage and i s on ly n o w p u l l i n g together a master roster o f a l l pub l ic servants. A much 
larger task i s to embark o n the professionalization o f the c i v i l service, inc lud ing 
competitive entrance exams, career streaming and training. Also, while improvements 
are be ing made in f inanc ia l management systems, until this year the budgeting system has 
been organized o n a l i n e item basis that obscured the linkages between expenditures and 
resu l ts . 

17. 

Governance has also been hampered by the emergence o f a mu l t i tude o f special 
in te res t groups that have been successful in pressuring the Government t o accommodate 
their in te res ts , many o f w h i c h have contributed t o a breakdown o f l a w and order. Fo r 
example, groups o f “landless” campesinos invade ru ra l properties demanding land. The 
Government responds by buy ing the land, but the campesinos o f ten abandon the land 
after cu t t ing the trees . Campesinos b l o c k the highways demanding f ree seed, o r 
forgiveness o f credits, a long-standing practice that has created a bad credit culture and i s 
responsible in part f o r the lack o f p r iva te credit to small farmers. Farmers’ organizations 
b lock the highways until the Government reduces d iese l p r ices . Fishermen b l o c k the 
river ob jec t ing t o the ban o n fishing du r ing the spawning season, until the Government 
gives them a m o n t h o f f o o d supplies. These practices o f ten lead t o v io len t confrontations 
and deaths. In a less v io len t way, industrialists and businessmen have p layed the same 
game by demanding guaranteed re-financings f r om the Government, or by simply no t 
repaying their debts t o the pub l ic bank. 

18. 

Above all, the decline in the r u l e o f l aw i s seen b y many observers and the pub l ic 
at large as the greatest impediment t o economic development in Paraguay. C i v i l court 
procedures fo r the enforcement o f p r iva te property rights and contracts a re s low at best 
and corrupt at worst. Pub l ic prosecutors are inexperienced, understaffed and func t ion 
w i thou t basic equipment such as telephones and faxes. The Na t iona l Po l ice similarly 
func t ion with an untrained and under-equipped force. Acco rd ing t o a recent U N D P 
report, one-third o f the po l ice are untrained conscripts; sub-officials a re required t o 
purchase their o w n arms; and the orientation o f po l ice services i s mo re along the l i n e s o f 
m i l i t a r y command and con t ro l instead o f p rov id ing phys ica l secu r i ty t o the community. 
As a resu l t , and in comb ina t ion with economic stagnation du r ing the past five years, the re 
i s a g row ing incidence o f v io len t c r ime and lawlessness. Even mo re than education and 
health, the Government has been increasingly unable t o p rov ide i t s most basic pub l ic 
service--physical and j u d i c i a l security - to i t s citizens and bus inesses .

Paraguay i s a sma l l open economy, heav i ly dependent o n ag r icu l tu ra l 
commodities and o n reg iona l conditions, particularly those o f i t s large neighbors, B r a z i l 
and Argentina. This has l e f t the Paraguayan economy vulnerable t o even ts over which i t 
has l i t t l e control, inc lud ing international commodity p r ices and p o l i t i c a l and economic 
events in i t s neighbors. While economic management was gradualist and f a i r l y prudent 
in the years f o l l ow i n g the end o f the m i l i t a r y dictatorship in 1989, with balanced fiscal 
accounts, sma l l current account d e f i c i t s and dec l in ing in f la t ion , g row th performance was 
disappointing. The protracted s low g row th since the m i d - 1 990s i s a re f lec t ion o f s low 
progress with structural reform, widespread co r rup t ion and a decline in to ta l factor 
p roduc t iv i ty associated with a sh r ink ing investment ratio. Rather than pu rsu ing reforms 
that cou ld assist the economy in weathering external shocks, consecutive Administrations 
were generally u nw i l l i n g t o unde r take the measures required t o impa r t the needed 
resiliency to manage shocks, t o modernize the country’s p roduc t ive structure, or to 
address the ma jo r governance problems that h o l d back investment and p r iva te in i t ia t ive . 

20 . 

In recent years, this comb ina t ion o f factors was exacerbated by a series o f external 
and domestic shocks. M a j o r bank ing crises in 1995 and in 1997-98 led t o the closure o f a 
number o f domestic banks, the reduc t ion o f credit to the p r iva te sector, and a sharp drop 
in private investment. O n another front, Paraguay’s t e rm s o f trade deteriorated 
s ign i f ican t ly over the last 5 years; the p r ice o f soybeans and co t ton (the latter i s 
Paraguay’s m a i n labor-intensive agricultural product) declined by 50 percent between 
1995 and 200 1 , while o i l prices rose. To a lesse r extent, agriculture suffered f r om 
droughts in 1999, 2000, and mos t recently in 2002. The economy has also been battered 
by adverse developments in i t s m a i n trading partners, inc lud ing the B r a z i l i a n devaluation 
in 1999 and recession and f inanc ia l tu rmo i l in Argentina in 200 1-2002. B o t h these 
events had a s ign i f ican t negative impact on Paraguay’s trade with i t s reg iona l partners 
and led to significant devaluations o f the Guarani to regain competitiveness. 

2 1 . M o r e fundamentally, structural weaknesses suggest a n exhaustion o f Paraguay’s 
p reva i l ing economic mode l that was based o n impo r t -expo r t trade t o ne ighbo r ing 
countries (so ca l led “triangular trade”), cotton monoculture f o r sma l l farmers and pub l ic 
sector employment. Triangular trade, w h i c h used to rep resen t up t o 20 percent o f GDP, 
has fa l len s ign i f ican t ly as a r e s u l t o f Mercosur ta r i f fs and greater border controls on 
smuggling. Paraguay has n o t yet developed a p l a n t o replace this segment o f GDP or t o 
reactivate the m a i n triangular trade zone o f Ciudad del Es te . Other parts o f the exhausted 
economic mode l inc lude the continued u s e o f government t o p rov ide patronage jobs, 
continued government support f o r low - re tu rn co t ton production, and in general the 
c rowd ing out o f p roduc t ive expenditure f r om the Government budget (w h i c h i s n o w 
mos t ly salaries and pensions, with l i t t l e o n operations and investment). P r iva t iza t ion o f 
the telephone and water companies was attempted in 200 1-02, but was stopped by 
Congress f o l l ow i n g accusations o f co r rup t ion and protests by campesinos who objected 
to selling o f the na t iona l pa t r imony . 

6 

22. 
D e s p i t e the ove ra l l flatness o f the economy, there a re neve r the less a few sectors 
that have experienced vigorous g row th du r ing recent years. These inc lude parts o f 
agriculture that r em a i n in te rna t iona l ly competitive (in particular, soybeans and meat 
exports) as well as ce l lu la r telecommunications, in w h i c h fo re ign investment has been 
significant. Ag ro - indus t ry fo r export has also g rown significantly, but transport costs fo r 
Paraguay are the highest in the reg ion (c i f / fob ra t io o f 13 percent vs. 7 percent fo r the r e s t 
o f the region) and a deterrent o n growth. Due to the v ib rancy o f these sectors, Paraguay’s 
economic s i tua t ion appears t o be imp rov ing somewhat in 2003. The recent increase in 
soy and co t ton prices i s lead ing t o considerably h ighe r expo r t revenues and an expected 
current account s u r p l u s this year. Increased exports and imp roved domestic confidence 
since the April elections are also p rov id ing a boost to the general economy, and GDP i s 
expected t o g r ow by 1.5 percent in 2003. 

23. 
The comb ina t ion o f external vu lne rab i l i ty and a p o o r p o l i c y and ins t i tu t iona l 
environment has resu l ted in an exceptionally poo r g r ow t h performance since the mid- 
1 9 9 0 ~ ~ with GDP g r ow t h averaging 1 percent per year, w h i l e annual popu la t ion g row th 
rates stand at 2.6 percent. The outcome has been a secular decline in per capita GDP t o 
pre- 1990 l e v e l s with increasing pove r ty exacerbated by po la r ized income and land 
distribution.6 See Pove r ty P ro f i le in B o x 2.

since the poo r benefit mos t f r om increases in basic pub l ic services that r i s e as a

social services that occurred du r ing the past decade w o u l d continue.

with support f r om the U N D P and inputs f r om the IDB, the W o r l d Bank and others. While 
Paraguay i s no t a coun t ry that i s required t o do a PRSP, the previous Adm in is t ra t ion 
elected t o design a pove r ty strategy as a means o f focusing i t s development strategy. 
This strategy was discussed widely with c i v i l society and with the various p o l i t i c a l

Paraguay’s pove r ty ind ica to rs and l o w prospects f o r a t ta in ing the MDGs reflect a 
host o f long - te rm development challenges that w i l l require a sustained e f f o r t t o 
overcome. C h i e f among these i s that a large part o f w o r k force i s func t iona l ly i l l i te ra te

B o t h the l o w l e v e l and limited effectiveness o f spending o n social services in

rose considerably du r ing the 1990s , especially o n education, but s t i l l amounts t o on ly 6 
percent o f GDP (exc lud ing pensions). Spending o n health and social assistance 
programs, in particular, are under-funded when compared with other countries at s im i la r 
l e v e l s o f development. Basic p u b l i c hea l th services are concentrated in u rban areas and 
tend to p rov ide h ighe r comp lex i ty services fo r the 20 percent o f the popu la t ion covered 
by some sort o f hea l th insurance. 

2 9 . 

Reo r ien t ing services towards basic and preventive hea l th w i l l r e q u i r e e i the r 
additional resources, o r a ma jo r increase in the e f f ic iency o f de l ive ry w h i c h w o u l d 
include re fo rm ing the hea l th p r o v i s i o n o f the social security system. A similar pattern 
can be observed in education, where ove ra l l enrolment rates in p r im a r y education are 
high but in secondary education v e r y l o w (3 1 percent), with s t r ik ing differences between 

9 

urban (83 percent) and ru ra l (1 7 percent) areas. M a n y small social assistance programs 
exist which, combined, do no t p rov ide a social safety ne t f o r the poorest and vulnerable 
population. Las t ly , pension coverage o f the poo r i s absent, while today’s considerable 
spending o n pensions (3.5 percent o f GDP) insu res on ly about 10 percent o f the 
popu la t ion w o r k i n g in the fo rma l sector. P rov id ing access t o basic social services to the 
g row ing indigenous popu la t ion i s a further challenge that requ i res special attention. 

30. 
In t e r m s o f infrastructure, the population’s access t o basic infrastructure services 
i s probably the wo rs t in the region. On ly 23 percent o f a l l roads are paved and l e s s than 
43 percent o f these paved roads are in good condition. O n l y 70 percent and 37 percent o f 
the popu la t ion in urban and ru ra l areas, respectively, are se rved by water supply. The 
coverage o f sanitation networks i s much less . There are l e s s than 5 fixed telephone l i n e s 
fo r every 100 inhabitants mak ing i t the lowest coverage ra t io in comparative te rms . L e s s 
than 1 percent o f t h e popu la t ion has access t o i n t e r n e t connections. 

3 1, 

A challenge fo r the country i s h o w to ma in ta in the ex is t ing assets and expand the 
coverage o f basic infrastructure. The yearly f inanc ing requirements o f a modest 
infrastructure p rog ram fo r roads, water, sanitation and basic telephone services wou ld 
require some US$150-200 m i l l i o n (compared to yearly investments o f US$40 m i l l i o n at 
present) w h i c h i s far beyond the poss ib i l i ty o f p resen t pub l ic finances. The non-existence 
o f waste management fac i l i t ies outside o f a few ma jo r cities i s an additional factor that 
needs t o be u rgen t ly addressed. 

32. 
In the ag r icu l tu ra l sector, the frontier has basically vanished in the eastern reg ion 
as the push t o expand soy p roduc t ion has resulted in nearly to ta l deforestation o f the 
native forests ( l e s s than f i v e percent remain). Yet the expansion o f mode rn agriculture 
has l e f t the 300,000 sma l l (and mos t ly poor) farmers behind, who continue with 
subsistence fa rm ing based p r inc ipa l ly o n cotton. The challenge he re i s t o increase their 
p roduc t iv i ty as well. Also, as a r e s u l t o f deforestation, Paraguay has reached the 
unthinkable p o i n t o f becom ing a n e t importer o f wood, creating an unneeded d ra in o n the 
balance o f payments, n o t t o men t ion the loss o f employment in the p rev ious ly strong 
forestry sector. 

33 . 

Paraguay’s capacity f o r domestic savings mob i l iza t ion i s severely limited b y l o w 
confidence in the f inanc ia l system f o l l ow i n g eight years o f successive bank failures that, 
to date, have cost about 11 percent o f GDP. Bank ing regulations and supervision are 
weak and, as a resu l t , f inanc ia l intermediation i s l o w and interest costs and spreads are 
very h igh . The l a c k o f sound long - te rm savings mechanisms also limits the population’s 
ab i l i ty to save f o r o l d age and p rov ide some self-insurance against o l d age poverty. The 
ma jo r rema in ing p u b l i c bank (BNF) i s unviable in i t s current structure and insolvent with 
bad loans accounting fo r about 50 percent o f i t s po r t fo l io . 

34. Within the p u b l i c sector, the most entrenched feature o f pub l ic finances i s the 
structural d e f i c i t o f the Government pension system (Caja F isca l) , w h i c h i s currently 
generating a de f ic i t o f 2 percent o f GDP. A l though the tax re fo rms that are be ing 

10 

proposed w i l l l ike ly close the ove ra l l f isca l gap, the de f ic i t o n government pensions w i l l 
take time to balance the government pension accounts. 

3 5 , 

Another structural constraint o n pub l ic finances i s the g row ing burden o f external 
pub l ic debt, w h i c h has r i s e n considerably to 45 percent o f GD P due t o large bo r row ings 
in 1999 and t o the large devaluations o f the past few years. The cost o f se rv ic ing this 
debt n o w consumes about 20 percent o f government revenues and limits the 
Government’s a b i l i t y t o increase pub l ic investment v i a bo r row ing . Also, various pub l ic 
u t i l i t i e s have problems o f solvency or over-indebtedness and cannot m o b i l i z e the 
required investments to expand the coverage and qua l i ty o f service. 

36 . 

A large i n f o rm a l economy, pa r t ly contraband trade but also a s ign i f ican t share o f 
no rma l bus iness activity, continues t o operate outside the reg is te red framework, ma in ly 
to avo id taxes and high con t r ibu t ions t o the ine f f ic ien t social security system, but also t o 
avo id a complex and bureaucratic string o f administrative regulations. 

37. 

O n the plus side, i t shou ld be no ted that Paraguay possesses a number o f 
development assets w h i c h can be used in i t s favor, inc lud ing a re la t ive ly young 
popu la t ion w h i c h p rov ides a possible so lu t ion t o g row out o f the bind o n the social 
security system i f new en t ran ts can be enticed t o j o i n the fo rma l economy. Second, 
Paraguay’s membership in Me rcosu r provides access to a large reg iona l market. Third, 
v ib ran t comme rc ia l fa rm ing and l ives tock sectors are oriented t o export and rema in 
v iab le th rough a l l the t u rm o i l o f recent years. And, fourth, abundant e lec t r ic i ty supply i s 
available, a l though transmission and d is t r ibu t ion costs are high due t o a monopo l is t ic 
state energy system. 

Government’s Development Strategy 

38 . 

President Dua r te Frutos and his t e am began w o r k i n g o n the Adm in is t ra t ion ’s 
development strategy well before the e lec t ion in April 2003. By the time they took o f f ice 
in August, the objectives o f the i r strategy were well developed. These consist of: 

i) A recove ry o f confidence in state institutions th rough a sustained fight against 
co r rup t ion and the mode rn iza t ion o f p u b l i c administration. By putting emphasis 
o n imp roved governance, the Adm in is t ra t ion hopes t o achieve greater fo rma l i ty in 
the economy and t o increase the international leg i t imacy o f Paraguay. Equally, i t 
aims to fac i l i ta te greater pa r t ic ipa t ion o f c i v i l society in the fo rmu la t ion o f pub l ic 
p o l i c y and the con t ro l o f pub l ic expenditure. 

ii) Sustainable growth th rough a change in the economic m o d e l f r om triangular 
trade and p u b l i c emp loymen t towards agro-industry and expo r t d ive rs i f ica t ion . 
While imp roved e f f ic iency o f pub l ic sector services and p u b l i c investment can 
p lay a supporting ro le in achieving this objective, the Adm in is t ra t ion recognizes 
that clear and predictable ru les , j u d i c i a l security and equa l i ty o f opportunities are 
essential fo r increasing p r iva te sector competitiveness. 

11 

iii) An increase i n human capital th rough higher investment in hea l th and 
education, po l ic ies that enhance equity and increased access to these services, and 
well targeted pove r ty reduc t ion programs to inc lude the mos t vulnerable groups. 

39. While keeping the above objectives in view, the Adm in is t ra t ion also faced the 
p r imo rd ia l need t o rega in con t ro l o f pub l ic finances and t o put them o n a long - te rm 
sustainable basis. This immed ia te p r i o r i t y was based o n the recogn i t ion that expenses 
have been rising faster than revenues, that the re i s an abno rma l ly h i g h sha re o f r i g i d 
expenses (salaries and pensions, w h i c h represen t 90 percent o f recurrent expenditure), 
that the de f ic i t in government pensions (2 percent GDP) i s c rowd ing ou t needed 
development investments, that debt service i s consuming an unsustainable share o f to ta l 
expenditure (20 percent), and that the tax system s u f f e r s f r om a ma jo r de f ic iency in the 
f o rm o f multiple tax exemptions (42 separate laws) w h i c h are n o t o n l y a cause fo r 
revenue loss, but also create u n t o l d opportunities fo r tax evasion and corruption. 

40. 
The short-term severity o f the situation was b rough t home when the new 
Adm in is t ra t ion t o o k o f f i c e and found i t s e l f fac ing a short-term f inanc ing gap o f US$175 
m i l l i o n (3.5 percent o f GDP) in the f o rm o f arrears and end-of-year debt service. O f this 
amount, US$65 m i l l i o n represented arrears o n existing debt service and US$115 m i l l i o n 
o f debt service ob l iga t ions f a l l i n g due in the fou r th quarter. A b o u t US $ 9 0 m i l l i o n o f 
these amounts are domestic bonds in arrears o r with bunched ma tu r i t ies in December. 

4 1. 
To address this situation, the Adm in is t ra t ion took a number o f measures to con t ro l 
expenditure and increase revenues. O n the expenditure side, i t withdrew US$30 m i l l i o n 
o f reques ts f o r budget increases that the previous Adm in is t ra t ion had sen t t o Congress, 
and put o n h o l d any discussion o f an increase in pub l ic sector salaries. I t also started a 
census o f p u b l i c employees and pensioners, in part to co l lec t relevant data o n personnel 
capacity, but also t o identify those rece iv ing double salaries, o f w h i c h 1650 have been 
identified to date and e l im ina ted f r om the pay ro l l . 

42. 
O n the revenue side, t h e Adm in is t ra t ion took a se r ies o f measures t o verify tax 
registration and the proper use o f tax accounting books, t o encourage delinquent 
taxpayers to bring their payments up to date th rough the wa ive r o f f ines , t o eliminate 300 
controllers fo r la rge taxpayers (w h i c h served m a i n l y as a source o f corruption), and to 
remove a l l non-customs employees f r om Customs entry po in ts (another source o f 
corruption). These simple moves t o imp rove tax adm in is t ra t ion have already yielded 
significant bene f i ts , with tax revenues rising by 4 1 percent f o r the mon ths o f August 
th rough October, compared with the same pe r iod in 2002. 

43. 
In t e r m s o f the budget f o r 2004, the Adm in is t ra t ion sen t a p roposa l t o Congress 
that was recast in p rog ramma t ic t e rm s with iden t i f iab le objectives and r e s u l t s fo r each 
program. Expend i tu re allocations were increased on ly fo r education and health, and 
somewhat fo r agriculture. Overall, the budget aims fo r an “equilibrated” outcome o f 1 
percent de f ic i t with zero f inanc ing gap. 

12 

44. 
T h e A dm i n i s t r a t i o n also unde r took some in te rna l res t ruc tu r ing t o in teg ra te the 
pe rsonne l a n d planning func t ions i n t o M i n i s t r y o f F inance ( they we re p r e v i o u s l y separate

(finance, cen t ra l bank, ag r icu l tu re , p u b l i c w o r k s a n d indus t ry ) . 

45. 
In add i t ion , the M i n i s t e r o f F inance requested the B a n k t o p repa re a “ministry o f 
excellence” p r o j e c t t o f inance techn ica l assistance f o r reeng inee r ing the ministry, 
i m p r o v i n g i n t e r n a l con t ro ls and audit, and t o p ro fess iona l ize the c i v i l service. 

46. 
R e g a r d i n g the l o n g - t e rm sus ta inab i l i ty o f p u b l i c finances, the A dm i n i s t r a t i o n 
reached a p o l i t i c a l agreement with a l l the p o l i t i c a l pa r t ies o n the need f o r k e y econom ic

47. 
F i v e o f t h e above l aw s have a l ready been sent t o Congress (budget, tax, pensions, 
customs and p u b l i c debt). T h e b i l l o n p u b l i c banks i s expec ted t o be sent shortly, a n d the 
one o n p u b l i c a dm i n i s t r a t i o n and p u b l i c enterprises during 2004 . 

13 

48. 

I t should also be no ted that apart f r om the Acuerdo Po l i t ico , the Congress i s 
scheduled t o approve p r i o r t o Boa rd consideration o f this CAS an impo r tan t f inanc ia l 
sector l a w that establishes a p r iva te sector funded deposit insurance scheme and a modern

o f future bank ing crises t o p ro tec t depositors and t o limit the costs o f bank failures, w h i c h 
in the past have cost over 10 percent o f GDP. This l a w w i l l need t o be complemented 
with imp roved p rov is ion ing standards and bank ing supervision, preparations fo r w h i c h

l a w w h i c h w i l l p l a y an impo r tan t ro le in strengthening the governance o f the bank ing 
sector. 

49. 

Based o n the above actions, the Government has negotiated a 15 -mon th Standby 
Arrangement with the IMF, w h i c h i s expected t o be considered by the IMF Boa rd o n 
December 15,2003. 

Bank Assessment 

50. 

In fo rmu la t ing the above leg is la t ive proposals, the Adm in is t ra t ion has gone far 
beyond many o f the mo re general recommendations that the B a n k p resen ted t o the new 
Adm in is t ra t ion in June.' In this regard, the proposed p o l i c y re fo rms have fa r exceeded 
the Bank 's expectations. I f approved in their current form, the leg is la t ion w o u l d 
constitute the mos t impo r tan t r e f o rm agenda that Paraguay has prepared in mode rn times. 
I f approved, they should be su f f ic ien t t o a l l ow b o t h an increase in development 
expenditures, as well as attainment o f f isca l sustainability over the next few years. 

5 1. 
The above proposals focus o n f isca l and f inanc ia l sector reforms, w h i c h are 
urgent fo r s tab i l iza t ion o f the economy. Paraguay neve r the less faces a m u c h broader 
development agenda. Based o n the exchanges o n the P o l i c y Options Report, the Bank 
be l ieves that there i s a general coincidence o f views with the new Adm in is t ra t ion o n this 
agenda. Some o f the add i t iona l o r deeper p o l i c y areas where the B a n k has advised the 
Adm in is t ra t ion to turn i t s a t ten t ion after i t has achieved the f isca l and f inanc ia l re fo rms i t 
has s e t in m o t i o n include: 
. E l im i n a t i o n o f the untargeted subsidy o n d i e s e l fue l , w h i c h has cost the coun t ry 
an average o f US$25 m i l l i o n per annum (0.5 percent o f GDP) ove r the past fou r 
years. C lose ly re la ted w o u l d be an imp roved regu la to ry f ramewo rk f o r pe t ro leum

Medium Term Outlook 

52. 
Paraguay’s immed ia te economic future depends heav i ly o n t h e Government’s 
ab i l i ty to close i t s end-of-year f inanc ing gap and avo id f a l l i n g i n t o a protracted arrears 
scenario. G i v e n i t s agreement with i t s domestic bond holders and the prospects o f 
support f r om the in te rna t iona l f inanc ia l institutions, and assuming con t inued tight 
management o f p u b l i c finances and passage o f the proposed leg is la t ion as ou t l ined above, 
Paraguay c o u l d en te r a p e r i o d o f renewed growth. 

53 . 
Under this scenario, g r ow t h i s l ike ly t o be pos i t ive in 2003 and 2004, due t o 
favorable ha rves ts and high commod i ty prices fo r soybean and cotton. F o r 2003, g row th 
i s projected at about 1.5 percent, rising t o 2-2.5 percent in 2004. P rov ided the reforms 

15 

supported by the Acuerdo Po l i t ico are approved, and the Government maintains 
c red ib i l i ty o n b o t h the mac ro and p o l i t i c a l front, g r ow t h cou ld reach 3 percent by 2005. 
O n this basis, i t i s believed that s ign i f ican t investor confidence w i l l return t o Paraguay 
and that p r iva te investment w i l l increase su f f ic ien t ly to spur g r ow t h t o 3 .5 percent in the 
medium t e rm .

The scenario ou t l ined above assumes that the Government w i l l a t ta in f isca l 
sustainability within t w o years as a r e s u l t o f the proposed reforms, in pa r t icu la r the tax 
r e f o rm w h i c h i s estimated t o increase revenues by 1.5 percent o f GD P as i t s measures 
come i n t o effect, aided by continued imp rovemen t in tax and customs administration. 
The proposed pension r e f o rm w i l l also contribute t o f isca l sustainability th rough an 
increase in contributions amoun t ing t o an add i t iona l 0.2 percent o f GD P and th rough 
reduced outlays over the medium t e rm . Even a l l ow i n g f o r some increase in capital 
expenditures, p r ima ry su rp luses should be possible o n the order o f 2-2.5 percent o f GDP, 
a l l ow i n g the gradual reduc t ion o f the debt burden. Increased e f f ic iency in p u b l i c 
en te rp r ises w o u l d also contribute to a decrease in to ta l pub l ic debt. As the debt-to-GDP 
ra t io declines, the p r im a r y su rp lus cou ld be eased t o accommodate greater investment, 
w i thou t jeopa rd iz ing debt sustainability. Further details a r e p rov ided in Annex table B6.

Ano the r key assumption i s the s tab i l i ty o f the exchange rate. While m u c h o f 
Paraguay’s debt i s o n concessional t e r m s (30 percent), i t i s almost en t i re ly denominated 
in fo re ign currency and i s highly sens i t ive t o variations in the exchange rate. M i t i g a t i n g 
this sensitivity i s the fac t that Paraguay enjoys s ign i f ican t dollar-denominated roya l t ies 
f r om the I t a i p u hyd roe lec t r ic plant that are somewhat higher than the Government’s ha rd 
currency debt service.

56. 
Paraguay will, o f course, remain vulnerable to regional events in Argentina and 
B raz i l , but g iven the ma jo r devaluations o f their currencies du r ing the past few years, and 
the tighter macro economic management currently in place, i t i s likely that there w i l l be 
greater regional stability and g row th over the medium term than du r ing the past five 
years. In addition, the bank ing sector reforms currently be ing put in place, together with 
a clearly focused monetary p o l i c y and sma l l fiscal d e f i c i t s w i l l a l l ow the economy t o 
withstand external shocks mo re easily than in the past. 

57. Given the more favorable regional and external environment, the m a i n 
determinant t o renewed g r ow t h w o u l d appear to be the passage and imp lemen ta t ion o f 
the Administration’s r e f o rm package. W i thou t these policies, however, pub l ic finances 
w i l l remain very weak and the Government w i l l face further renewed f inanc ing problems, 
leading to continued l o w investment and probable stagnation o f the economy. App rova l 
o f the Acuerdo Po l i t ico i s thus c ruc ia l f o r tu rn ing the corner and restarting growth. 

58. 
Neve r the less , while the above adjustment scenario implies a return t o pos i t ive per 
capita GDP growth, i t i s n o t su f f ic ien t to raise the income o f the average Paraguayan 
back to the l e v e l s o f the early 1990s. For this t o happen, g row th o f 6 percent per annum 
wou ld be required th rough 20 10. Hence, more than the proposed re fo rms w i l l be needed 
t o make a significant difference t o per capita income. In particular, the Government w i l l 
need t o find ways o f attracting higher l e v e l s o f private investment and im p r o v i n g the 
e f f i c i e n c y o f pub l ic expenditure. Improvements in governance conditions, pa r t icu la r ly o n 
the p r imacy o f the rule o f l a w and sustained anticorruption measures w o u l d be c ruc ia l in 
imp rov ing the investment c l ima te and p u b l i c sector performance. The Bank’s assistance 
strategy has been designed with this b road agenda o f change in mind, b u i l d i n g o n many 
o f the deeper reforms men t ioned in the preceding section o n Bank Assessmen t . 

111. - World Bank Assistance Strategy 

59. 
The Bank’s assistance strategy in Paraguay i s essentially one o f re-engagement 
f o l l ow i n g a l o n g pe r iod o f l o w ac t iv i ty and l i t t l e lending. The C A S o f April 1997 
became s t i l lbo rn f o l l ow i n g the Bank’s decision in 1998 t o ha l t preparation o f new 
projects due t o the Government’s non-compliance with i t s social obligations under the 
Yacyreta hydroelectric p ro jec t . Poor p o r t f o l i o performance and a lack o f i n t e r e s t by the 
Government t o continue b o r r ow i n g f r om the Bank also contributed t o this hiatus in 
lend ing until FY02 , when the f i r s t o f tw o new loans was a p p r ~ v e d . ~ A l though no lend ing 
occurred during f i v e years, the Bank made sustained efforts t o imp rove p o r t f o l i o 
performance du r ing this pe r iod and carried out a minimum o f core economic and sector 
wo rk . I t also in i t ia ted an an t i -co r rup t ion p rog ram that continues t o thrive, and i t 
contributed substantially t o the preparation o f a pove r ty reduc t ion strategy that the new

Feedback from Consultations with Civil Soc ie ty 

6 1. 

In preparation f o r this CAS, a se r ies o f consultations were h e l d with a wide range 
o f Paraguay’s c i v i l society and p r iva te sector, b o t h in Asuncion, the capital, and in the 
in te r io r o f the country. The views o f c i v i l society about the Bank’s operations and 
Paraguay’s development p r io r i t ies are presented in Annex 3, as well as o n the Bank’s 
regional o f f i c e website. These consultations revealed that the pub l ic , especially in the 
in te r io r o f the country, has l i t t l e in fo rma t ion about B a n k operations and, as a resu l t , o f ten 
m is in fo rmed views. F o r example, a recurrent theme was that the B a n k should invo lve 
loca l organizations in the design and imp lemen ta t ion o f Bank projects, even though most 
active o r recen t ly active B a n k projects in Paraguay already w o r k p r i n c i p a l l y with or 
through l o c a l organizations, such as the ru ra l wa te r jun tas , farmers’ groups and school-

consultations also c lamo red fo r support t o strengthen their organizations and fo r B a n k

62. 
In sp i te o f the i n f o rm a t i o n gap that was revealed by the consultations, c i v i l society 
o f fe red several good suggestions fo r im p r o v i n g Bank operations, i n c l u d i n g engaging

CAS Objectives 

64. 

The objectives o f the CAS are aligned closely with the new Administration’s 
development p r io r i t ies . They bo th assign i n i t i a l p r i o r i t y t o the need f o r fiscal and 
financial stabilization as the s ine qua non fo r regaining confidence in the economy and 
getting back t o a sustainable g row th path. As discussed in the previous sections, until the 
Government regains con t ro l over i t s finances, i t w i l l no t be able t o spend e f f ic ien t ly and 
obtain a g r ow t h d iv idend f r om i t s limited resources. S im i la r ly , w i thou t strengthening, the 
banking sector w i l l rema in a source o f risk, and any recovery o f g row th w i l l rema in 
vulnerable t o new f inanc ia l crises, just as du r ing the past eight years when a se r ies o f 
financial crises took a heavy t o l l o n Paraguay’s growth. 

65. 

The second p r i o r i t y i s t o support the Government’s efforts t o restore confidence in 
state ins t i tu t ions b y im p r o v i n g governance and transparency in pub l ic administration. 
Imp roved governance i s another c r i t ica l ingredient f o r g row th in t e r m s o f ra is ing the 
confidence o f the p r iva te sector t o increase investment in Paraguay. Third, the Bank’s 
assistance strategy aims t o support the Administration’s goals o f achieving sustainable 
g row th th rough imp roved infrastructure and increasing the p roduc t iv i ty o f the ru ra l 
sector, in particular that o f small f a rm e r s among w h om poverty i s highest. And, fourth, 
the strategy w o u l d support the Government’s efforts t o expand the coverage and 
e f f ic iency o f basic social services (education, pub l ic hea l th and watedsanitation), in order 
to help Paraguay mee t i t s millennium development goals. This objective w o u l d include, 
inter alia, improvements in the targeting o f social p ro tec t ion programs, inc lud ing 
pensions i f possible. In sum, the CAS objectives are: 

0 F isca l and f inanc ia l sector stabilization; 

0 

Imp roved governance and transparency in pub l ic administration; 

0 Enhanced and sustained growth, in particular in ru ra l areas where pove r ty i s most 
concentrated and deepest; and 

0 Social Inc lus ion - imp roved coverage and e f f ic iency o f basic social services t o 

help m e e t the MDGs. 

Bank Strategy 

66. 

The proposed Bank strategy recognizes the n e w economic and p o l i t i c a l situation 
in Paraguay, in particular, the actions the new Adm in is t ra t ion has t a k e n t o con f ron t 
corruption, t igh ten con t ro l over i t s finances and build a p o l i t i c a l consensus f o r impo r tan t 
economic re fo rms . The proposed strategy i s nevertheless also mindful o f the l o n g h is to ry 

19 

o f p o l i t i c a l d i f f icu l t ies and the lack o f ins t i tu t iona l capacity that has hindered re fo rm 
efforts in the past. In this high-risk / high-reward situation, i t i s proposed to proceed with 
a re-engagement strategy that i s based o n clear performance c r i te r ia and t o approve new 
commitments in l i n e with the Adm in is t ra t ion ’s progress in building a credible t rack 
record o f economic management and re fo rm . 

67. 
Within the above risk management framework, and in view o f the bulge in the 
Government’s f inanc ia l ob l iga t ions towards the end o f this year, the Bank’s p rog ram 
includes the proposed Econom ic Recovery adjustment loan (ERL) as an i n i t i a l element o f 
the ove ra l l assistance strategy. This loan w o u l d support the Government’s actions to date 
and the s ign i f ican t economic reforms that i t has already sen t t o Congress, i n c l u d i n g the 
re fo rm o f the Government pension system, the Customs Code and the tax leg is la t ion that 
were described in the p rev ious section. In view o f the actions t o date, the ERL w o u l d be 
a one-tranche operation, in order to p rov ide qu ick disbursing resources t o help close the 
Government’s end-of-year f inanc ing gap o f approximately US$175 m i l l i o n . The ERL 
(US$30 m i l l i o n ) w o u l d be part o f a concerted e f fo r t among other mu l t i la te ra l and private 
creditors t o close this gap. This bu rden sharing e f f o r t includes a US $ 3 0 m i l l i o n social 
sector loan f r om the IDB and US$90 m i l l i o n f r om domestic creditors in the f o rm o f 
rescheduled domestic Treasury b i l ls that are either in arrears o r f a l l i n g due in December. 
This package o f creditor support w o u l d be accompanied by an IMF standby arrangement. 

68. 
As part o f a concerted package o f support f r om mu l t i la te ra l and domestic 
creditors, the ERL w o u l d enhance the chances o f a successful outcome o f the 
Administration’s e f fo r ts t o stabilize pub l ic finances and win leg is la t ive app rova l fo r i t s 
economic r e f o rm proposals. This e lemen t o f the Bank’s strategy w o u l d thus contribute to 
the Government’s immed ia te p r i o r i t y objective o f f isca l stabilization. 

69. 
P rov ided substantial progress i s made towards approval o f the tax and pension 
re fo rm leg is la t ion supported by the ERL, the Bank’s strategy i s t o proceed with the 
second e lemen t o f i t s base case lending program, namely a f inanc ia l sector l o a n (FSAL) 
that w o u l d support an underlying r e f o rm o f the bank ing system. This loan, w h i c h has 
been prepared in close coo rd ina t ion with the IDB and the IMF, together with a 
companion f inanc ia l sector technical assistance loan (FTAL), w o u l d reduce the risk (and 
cost) o f future banking crises by supporting an imp roved banking reso lu t ion mechanism, 
the establishment o f a p r iva te sector funded deposit insurance scheme, imp lemen ta t ion o f 
international bes t practice bank ing regulations, enhanced banking supe rv is ion and 
imp lemen ta t ion o f a rev ised an t i -money laundering l a w that i s cu r ren t ly under 
preparation. I t should be no ted that the leg is la t ion creating the bank ing reso lu t ion and 
deposit insurance scheme i s scheduled t o be approved p r i o r to B o a r d consideration o f this 
CAS . The FSAL (US$50 m i l l i o n ) w o u l d be a t rad i t iona l two-tranche adjustment loan 
that w o u l d disburse in s tep with imp lemen ta t ion o f these reforms. The F S A L / F T A L 
package w o u l d also proceed in tandem with a s im i la r adjustment l o a n f r om the IDB that 
w o u l d support r e f o rm o f the p u b l i c bank ing sector in Paraguay. 

70. 
In sum, the f i r s t p i l l a r o f the proposed Bank strategy i s t o support key structural 
reforms needed to stabilize p u b l i c finances and strengthen the f inanc ia l sector, b o t h 

20 

necessary ingredients f o r macro stability. These operations w i l l p rov ide financial 
resources commensurate with the ambitious program o f reforms that the new 
Adm in is t ra t ion has submitted t o Congress and which has been approved in part. In turn, 
the stabilization o f p u b l i c finances and the strengthening o f the bank ing system w i l l 
provide the confidence necessary f o r private investors to increase their activities and w i l l 
thus lay the g roundwo rk fo r a sustained recovery o f the economy. 

71. 
The second pillar o f the Bank’s strategy fo r FY04 -07 i s t o assist the Government 
in imp rov ing governance and transparency in pub l ic administration. Support wou ld be 
p rov ided th rough a se r ies o f technical assistance loans and grants. The first o f these 
loans, already under preparation, aims to transform the Ministry o f Finance in to a 
“ministry o f excellence” v i a overhaul o f i t s internal controls, procedures, service 
orientation towards the public, and a program fo r professionalization o f the c i v i l se rv ice . 
The ministry o f excellence project w o u l d seek to integrate imp roved management 
practices with one o r t w o key l i n e ministries, e.g., Education, w h i c h i s also attempting to 
imp rove i t s management practices th rough the Education R e f o rm loan; as such, the 
ministry o f excellence p ro jec t cou ld serve as a starting p o i n t f o r a deeper process o f 
pub l ic sector re fo rm . This project w o u l d be complemented by a p ro jec t t o imp rove 
financial management capacity at the mun ic ipa l leve l , in particular, better application o f 
the land tax (impuesto i nm o b i l i a r i o ) wh ich i s the m a i n (but vastly underutilized) source 
o f mun ic ipa l revenue. Imp roved management capacity at the mun ic ipa l l e v e l i s a 
necessary p re requ is i te f o r eventual decentralization o f pub l ic services, one o f the central 
des ires o f the Paraguayan public. 

72. 
The third p i l l a r o f the proposed strategy i s t o support sustainable growth, in 
particular, in the ru ra l areas where the ma jo r i ty o f the poo r live, but also through private 
sector development ac t iv i t ies that w o u l d imp rove the general bus iness environment. 
Investment projects in support o f the ru ra l areas w o u l d inc lude a scaling up o f a 
comprehensive ag r icu l tu ra l extension and natural resource management model, support 
fo r sustainable forest management t o spur Paraguay’s huge po ten t ia l in forest p roduc t ion 
and export, an innova t ive p rog ram fo r maintenance o f secondary and ru ra l roads, and 
support f o r continued expansion o f water supply and sanitation in the ru ra l areas. In the 
latter tw o projects, innova t ive techn iques wou ld be used t o harness p r iva te sector 
invo lvemen t with the a im o f reducing costs and im p r o v i n g e f f ic iency . These operations 
w i l l be supported by diagnostic w o r k o n the ru ra l sector and the c l ima te fo r p r iva te sector 
investment. 

73. 
Social inc lus ion i s the fou r th p i l l a r o f our engagement over the com ing years and 
w i l l be closely a l igned with the implementation o f the Government’s pove r ty reduction 
strategy. This w o u l d build - and also be dependent - o n a successful rural-based g row th 
strategy as ou t l ined above. Ou r activities wou ld focus o n supporting systemic reforms in 
the social sectors that w o u l d increase effective delivery o f services bene f i t ing in large 
part the r u r a l poo r . Necessary cross-sectoral reforms w o u l d inc lude (i) imp rov ing 
expenditure d is t r ibu t ion t o favor p rov is ion o f basic services and assistance programs in 
the poorest areas; (ii) ra t iona l iz ing human resource planning, especially in the education 
and health sectors; (iii) ensuring that u s e r costs f o r services contribute t o the effective 

21 

delivery o f services at the l e v e l at w h i c h they a re collected while in t roduc ing exemption 
po l ic ies fo r the poor; and ( iv ) in t roduc ing specific outreach activities to reach the 
indigenous popu la t ion in Paraguay. Ou r p o l i c y dialogue and lend ing activities wou ld 
concentrate o n (i) in t roduc ing a maternal-child health insurance scheme, (ii) assisting the 
Government to rationalize (and expand) the many existing social assistance programs and 
prepare the re fo rm o f the pension system; and (iii) supporting the ongoing secondary 
education re fo rm (which introduces b o t h supply s ide incentives as well as demand side 
support) through the second phase o f an adjustable lending p rog ram that began with the 
recen t education r e f o rm loan. 

74. 
The relationship o f these projects and the associated diagnostic w o r k with the 
Government’s and the CAS ’ objectives i s shown in the CAS Program M a t r i x at the end 
o f the m a i n text. The attachment t o the CAS Program M a t r i x provides a detailed 
description o f each investment p ro jec t and study inc luded in the proposed program. 

Base Case Lending 

75. 
The base case lend ing p rog ram aims t o p rov ide measured support t o the 
Adm in is t ra t ion fo r a l l fou r CAS objectives (stabilization, governance, g row th and social 
inclusion). I t consists o f the ERL and FSAL adjustment loans mentioned above, together 
with 11 p ro jec t loans ( inc lud ing the FTAL and t h r e e other TA loans to boost ins t i tu t iona l 
capacity), fo r to ta l commitments o f US$325 m i l l i o n over the t h r e e and one -ha l f year 
period, m id -FY04 -07 . Adjustment lend ing w o u l d rep resen t 25 percent o f the base case 
lend ing program. The specific p ro jec t proposals r e f l e c t the p r io r i t ies o f the Government 
as expressed in a C A S consultation meeting with h igh - leve l Adm in is t ra t ion o f f ic ia ls in 
early October. Base case lend ing assumes that the re i s continued improvement in project 
implementation, pa r t icu la r ly with regards to the appointment and evaluation o f p ro j ect

76. Given the considerable uncertainties and r i s k s that the B a n k faces in Paraguay, 
inc lud ing the po ten t ia l f o r a h i g h rewa rd outcome, i t i s proposed that the high and l o w 
cases p rov ide a m u c h greater range o f commitment alternatives than usual. 

H igh Case 

77. 

In the event that the Government complies with the high case conditions (see 
lend ing triggers below), the Bank w o u l d proceed with add i t iona l investment projects 
and/or adjustment operations in amounts up to an additional U S $ l 00 m i l l i o n , fo r a to ta l 
o f US$425 m i l l i o n f o r the C A S pe r iod . Given the nature o f the h i g h case lend ing triggers 
and the need t o build a sustained t rack reco rd o f macro management and p ro jec t 
implementation, i t i s unlikely that Paraguay w o u l d en ter the high case until the latter 
years o f the C A S pe r iod . Neve r the less , some o f the possible operations in the high case 
w o u l d be h i g h l y complementary t o the base case ( fo r example, a pens ion r e f o rm or 
cond i t iona l t rans fe r soc ia l p ro tec t ion adjustment loan to build o n the social p ro tec t ion T A 
p ro jec t o f the base case, o r the bus iness development adjustment l o a n t o build o n the 
p r iva te sector development TA p ro jec t o f the base case). Such high case operations cou ld 
therefore have very high ma rg ina l returns in supporting one o r mo re o f the C A S 
objectives. The B a n k w i l l therefore w o r k with the Government towards meeting the h i g h 
case conditions, with the a im o f boos t ing Paraguay’s g row th beyond the 3 .5 percent 
envisaged in the base case macro scenario. 

L o w Case 

7 8 . 

In the event that the Government n o longer mee ts the base case conditions, the 
lending p rog ram w o u l d reve r t t o a core s e t o f projects that focus o n the Millennium 
Development Goals. These projects comprise the aforementioned operations in health, 
small fa rme r r u r a l development, education and water. In a l l cases, these projects 
represen t con t inua t ion o f ac t iv i ty in areas where the Bank i s cu r ren t ly i n v o l v e d and 
be l ieves that i t s interventions are effective. The l o w case w o u l d thus assure con t inu i ty in 
dialogue and w o r k i n g relationships with the ministries i n v o l v e d in these MDG areas. 
Moreover, these p ro jec ts w o u l d be phased equally over the C A S period, bas ica l ly one per 
year, thus m i n im i z i n g the pace o f further Bank exposure. The o n l y non - t rad i t iona l 
p ro jec t proposed f o r the l o w case i s the “ministry o f excellence” p ro jec t f o r Finance, 
since this project w o u l d strengthen the f inanc ia l management capacity o f this core 
ministry. In the l o w case scenario, lend ing w o u l d be capped at US$120 m i l l i o n , or one- 
third o f the base case amount, fo r these projects.

As mentioned, Paraguay i s cu r ren t ly considered to be in the base case, in view o f 
the strong actions the Adm in is t ra t ion has taken at the beg inn ing o f i t s t e r m t o deal with 
the d i f f i c u l t f inanc ing s i tua t ion i t inherited as well as t o l a y the base f o r long - te rm 
growth. Paraguay nonetheless needs time to build a track reco rd o f good economic 
management and p o l i c y re fo rm . The base case lend ing triggers, w h i c h focus o n a limited 

23 

number o f factors mos t ly related to fiscal and financial stability, have thus been 
constructed as a se t o f con t inu ing conditions that cou ld apply throughout the CAS period. 
This w o u l d a l l ow an assessment t o be made at different po in ts o f time o f whether 
Paraguay i s m a k i n g reasonable progress towards these goals. 

80. 
Fo r example, t o rema in in the base case, Paraguay should ma in ta in a satisfactory 
macroeconomic f ramewo rk throughout the CAS period. Similarly, i t i s expected that the 
Adm in is t ra t ion w i l l make continuous progress in imp lemen t ing the procurement and 
financial management ac t ion plans that have recently been agreed f o l l ow i n g the CPAR 
and C F A A evaluations. These plans have a tw o year timeframe and p rov ide a roadmap 
fo r assessment du r ing this period. Special emphasis has been placed on the tax and 
pension re fo rm leg is la t ion that the Adm in is t ra t ion has sen t t o Congress and i s being 
supported by the ERL. I t i s expected that these laws, w h i c h are essential f o r stabilization 
o f public finances, w i l l be approved du r ing the f i r s t h a l f o f 2004. Their implementation 
w i l l nevertheless occur over time. Similarly, the financial sector reforms that are equally 
important f o r macro s tab i l i ty w i l l requ i re a number o f years t o be fully implemented. A 
road map fo r assessing their implementation w i l l be p rov ided by the FSAL and FTAL 
operations that w i l l support these reforms. Maintenance o f satisfactory p o r t f o l i o 
implementation throughout the CAS pe r iod has already been mentioned. 

8 1, 

One specific base case trigger that requ i res early ac t ion by the Adm in is t ra t ion i s 
to avo id further declines in the n e t assets o f Petropar, the na t iona l o i l im p o r t company. 
Essentially this implies e l im ina t ion o f the untargeted subsidy o n d iese l fue l , which wou ld 
be appropriate in light o f the considerable amount o f qu ick disbursing funds that the Bank 
strategy includes in the base case. Ma in ta in ing this minimum n e t asset pos i t ion wou ld 
also be required throughout the C A S pe r iod as evidence that the Government does no t 
revert to los ing money through the operations o f Petropar. One other specific base case 
trigger calls fo r the adoption o f a national pove r ty reduc t ion program, w h i c h i s expected 
du r ing 2004. These base case conditions are shown in the table o n the f o l l ow i n g page. 

82. 
As mentioned, m o v i n g to the h i g h case w i l l take time (perhaps tw o years), no t 
on ly in t e r m s o f b u i l d i n g a track record on basic economic management, but also in t e rm s 
o f meeting the specific h i g h case triggers. In general, the high case triggers are designed 
to recognize actions that w i l l accelerate attainment o f long - te rm g row th and equity goals 
and move Paraguay t o a higher g row th pa th than envisaged in the base case scenario. T o 
keep this poss ib i l i ty within reach, the base case program, i f implemented, w i l l directly 
support the Adm in is t ra t ion in meeting most o f the h i g h case triggers. 

83 . 
Fo r example, the social p ro tec t ion TA p ro jec t w i l l assist the Government in 
establishing a pove r ty mon i to r ing and evaluation system. The l a n d tax study w o u l d assist 
in restructuring the l a n d tax and imp rov ing equity in land d is t r ibu t ion . The ministry o f 
excellence TA p ro jec t w o u l d support the design o f changes t o the c i v i l service l aw and 
the in t roduc t ion o f merit-based h i r ing . The road maintenance p ro jec t w o u l d support 
innovative contracts f o r associating the private sector in infrastructure maintenance. 
H i g h case adjustment lend ing would, never the less , also depend o n the advancement o f 
specific reforms t o be supported by such operations.

contributed to the adequacy o f this law, as well as to the ensuing regulatory decree. As a 
resu l t o f this law, the Government established the Directorate o f Pub l ic Procurement 
w h i c h i s in the process o f creating new norms and procedures t o govern a l l state 
procurement. Based o n the CPAR , a procurement action p l a n has been agreed with the 
Government that calls f o r full operation o f the Directorate o f Pub l ic Procurement and the 
agency procurement u n i t s that w i l l be established in other parts o f the Government, a 
well defined ins t i tu t iona l and operational framework, development o f human resources,

85. 
A j o i n t Coun t ry F inanc ia l Accoun tab i l i ty Assessmen t (CFAA ) i s be ing conducted

The WB I p layed a significant ro le in launching a comprehensive p rog ram against 
co r rup t ion directed by a coa l i t ion o f Government and c i v i l society stakeholders in 
Paraguay. F o l l ow i n g a 1999 WB I survey o f the pub l ic perceptions o f corruption, the 
Government invited representatives o f c i v i l society and the p o l i t i c a l parties t o f o rm an 
An t i -co r rup t ion Comm iss ion that rece ived WB I orientation and t ra in ing in h o w other 
countries had approached the co r rup t ion issue . This Comm iss ion subsequently devised 
an an t i -co r rup t ion plan that focused o n the areas o f procurement, customs and the 
Judiciary. F o l l ow i n g consultations with c i v i l society, the p l a n was adopted as the 
Na t iona l In teg r i ty P lan in December 2000 and was instrumental in b u i l d i n g the 
momentum f o r the passage o f a new procurement l aw in 2002. The Commission, n o w 
called the Na t iona l In teg r i ty Commission, continues to func t ion as a credible entity that 
m e e t s regu la r ly and plays an active ro le in the na t iona l p u b l i c debate o n co r rup t ion and 
governance. 

13 

89 . 

D u r i n g the current C A S period, WB I intends t o reactivate i t s p rog ram o f support 
to the Na t iona l In teg r i ty Comm iss ion by supporting the Commission’s w o r k in one o f i t s 
th ree p r i o r i t y areas, namely, the Judiciary. In particular, WB I w o u l d inc lude Paraguay in 
a mu l t i -coun t ry Lea rn ing Program that w o u l d analyze the m a i n problems in the Judiciary 
and a im to examine fundamental areas fo r j u d i c i a l reform. I t w o u l d feature discussions 
across different types o f stakeholders/participants within Paraguay, as well as across 

l3 The Commission’s work i s currently being supported by a grant from the IDB. 

27 

other countries in L a t i n America, regarding legal performance in their countries and areas 
and in i t ia t ives fo r improvement. One objective in undertaking this p rog ram w o u l d be to 
integrate Bank s ta f f more closely in to client-focused learning programs, as well as t o 
support a possible (h igh case) Judicial Re fo rm Program fo r Paraguay. I f such a p ro jec t 
materializes, WB I w o u l d w o r k o n the anticorruption component o f the project, analyzing 
i s s u e s on independence and accountability fo r greater transparency and better 
performance in the Judiciary. 

Outreach 

90 . 

Paraguay i s s t i l l very m u c h a verbal society in w h i c h personal contact i s essential 
f o r the advancement o f programs and new ideas. The Bank w i l l address this situation by 
wo rk ing closely with the Execu t ive to increase the awareness o f Bank programs, projects 
and development i s s u e s among other branches o f government. An example o f such 
outreach was a recent presentation by the Regional C h i e f Economist t o the Congress o n 
the Bank’s views o n the development challenges facing L a t i n Ame r ica in general, with 
emphasis o n the circumstances o f Paraguay. Similarly, the Bank w i l l t a k e advantage o f 
visits by technical missions t o make presentations o n other topics o f interest. 

91, W i t h regards t o c i v i l society, the Bank i s in the process o f rec ru i t ing a c i v i l 
society / social development specialist fo r the Paraguay country office. This person w i l l 
have as a prime objective to extend Bank relations with c i v i l society organizations, 
contribute to the inco rpo ra t ion o f participatory mechanisms in the design and 
implementation o f Bank projects, and, in general, to help get the Bank’s messages heard 
and understood among a w ide r segment o f the population. 

Aid Coordination 

92. 

Paraguay i s one o f the few lowe r -m idd le income countries that has n o 
consultative group or fo rma l a i d coo rd ina t ion mechanism. The Government has m a i n l y 
engaged with donors o n a one-on-one basis, and, until recently, the a i d coo rd ina t ion and 
management func t ion has been split between the Ministry o f Finance and the Secretariat 
o f Planning and lacked a close coordination between the two . As a resu l t , a i d 
coordination has been very weak in the past. The areas o f donor activities and in te res t 
are shown in the partnership m a t r i x attached to Annex 4. 

9 3 . 

Desp i te shortcomings in the ove ra l l management o f donor assistance and the lack 
o f a fo rma l a id coo rd ina t ion mechanism, coordination between the B a n k and some o f the 
ma jo r donors has been good. Coo rd ina t ion with the IDB, by far the largest donor, has 
been e f f e c t i v e and several Bank - funded projects have been complementary t o IDB 
operations, f o r example, in maternal health, Bank and IDB financed s im i la r programs but 
with a different geographical coverage. In education, the IDB p rov ided assistance at the 
p r ima ry level, while Bank’s operations have been aimed at the secondary l e v e l . In 
addition, the B a n k and the IDB have collaborated e f fec t ive ly in the recent preparation o f 
the fiduciary reports o n procurement and f inanc ia l management. Coo rd ina t ion between 
the Bank and the U N D P has also been good, with the U N D P administering the f inanc ia l 

28 

management aspects o f several Bank-funded loans and grants. F ina l ly , coordination with 
the IMF has also been constructive. A l though Paraguay up t o n o w lacked an IMF 
program, co l labo ra t ion and dialogue between the tw o ins t i tu t ions has been close and 
constructive, pa r t icu la r ly o n the assessment o f the f inanc ia l sector adjustment loan and in 
the preparation o f the economic recovery loan. 

94. 
The new Adm in is t ra t ion has recognized the importance o f im p r o v i n g the 
management o f external assistance and has taken a number o f measures, inc lud ing the 
creation within the Ministry o f Finance o f a unit dedicated t o the management o f external 
assistance (the Central Unit f o r Pub l ic Investment) and the decision t o incorporate the 
Planning Secretariat in the M i n i s t r y o f Finance (for w h i c h leg is la t ion has been sen t t o 
Congress). Im p r o v i n g coo rd ina t ion among donors w i l l be pa r t icu la r ly important i f the 
Government wishes t o m o b i l i z e additional external support t o fund new poverty 
reduction interventions as pa r t o f i t s poverty reduction strategy. 

IFC 

95. 
At present, I F C has n o po r t fo l io balance in Paraguay. Due t o economic and 
po l i t ica l uncertainties, and ins t i tu t iona l and governance issues , the c l ima te fo r private 
investment has been poo r . I F C reviewed a number o f projects du r ing the last CAS 
period; however, none has thus far materialized due t o the p ro jec t structure o r r isk iness . 
IFC’s on ly current invo lvemen t in Paraguay has been th rough i t s reg iona l investment. A 
US$25 m i l l i o n loan and equity investment was comm i t ted in FY03 t o UABL fo r an 
expansion o f i t s river barge and terminal operations o n the Parana and Paraguay Rivers 
(the H i d r o v i a System). US$5 m i l l i o n o f this investment has been committed, but no t yet 
disbursed, to UABL Paraguay t o (i) acquire additional barges and tugs t o expand i t s 
operation, and (ii) construct t o expand barge and te rm ina l operations. 

96. 
Due t o the past experience, I FC w i l l remain ve ry selective in i t s ac t iv i ty in 
Paraguay and continue t o explore investment opportunities th rough reg iona l projects. 
I F C w i l l also l o o k at opportunities fo r i t s direct invo lvemen t in Paraguay, as the 
investment c l ima te imp roves and may p rov ide some advisory w o r k th rough FIAS. The 
new Government’s e f fo r ts t o imp rove macroeconomic management, p u b l i c governance 
and regulatory f ramewo rk are an encouraging trend towards an imp roved investment 
climate. 

M IGA 

97. 
Paraguay has been a member o f M IGA s ince 1992. To date, MIGA has facilitated 
an estimated U S $ lO m i l l i o n in fo re ign direct investment i n t o Paraguay. In 1997, MIGA 
issued a U S $ l 0 m i l l i o n guarantee against expropriation, transfer restriction, and war and 
c i v i l disturbance r i s k s t o L l o y d s Bank, P lc . o f the United K i n g d om f o r a loan to expand 
the lending operations o f i t s subsidiary. The additional funding was t o enable L loyds 
Paraguay t o increase i t s medium-term U .S . dollar lending, m a i n l y t o companies in the 
automotive and tex t i le industry. This guarantee has since been cancelled. MIGA 
remains ready t o underwrite suitable fo re ign investments in Paraguay over the upcom ing 

29 

CAS period. MIGA’s on - l ine investment p romo t ion se rv ices currently feature 80 
documents o n investment opportunities and the related legal and regulatory environment 
in Paraguay. 

9 8 . 

In November o f 2003, at the reques t o f the M i n i s t r i e s o f Finance and Industry & 
Commerce, MIGA conducted a diagnostic mission t o evaluate the ins t i tu t iona l and 
strategic environment f o r fo re ign direct investment (FDI) p romo t ion in Paraguay. MIGA 
met with over 50 members o f the private sector, pub l ic administration, and fo re ign 
bus iness communities to analyze the potential fo r proactive p romo t ion o f FD I in to the 
country. The resulting report, which w i l l be presented t o the Government in early 2004, 
w i l l analyze and make recommendations o n h o w the country can imp rove f lows o f FDI. 
The focus w i l l be on ins t i tu t iona l improvements, pa r t icu la r ly in ProParaguay, strategic 
organization within the Government t o prepare fo r and support the p romo t ion process, 
and a p re l im ina ry iden t i f ica t ion o f target markets and sub-sectors f r om where investment

I V . - IBRD Exposure and Risk Management 
Debt and IBRD Exposure Indicators 

99 . 

Paraguay i s a l o w t o moderately indebted country, with to ta l debt service about 12 
percent o f exports and to ta l debt-to-GDP o f about 48 percent. The apparent difference 
between these tw o measures o f indebtedness reflects the fact that the great ma jo r i ty o f 
Paraguay’s external debt i s o n long maturities with reasonably l o w i n t e r e s t rates. Debt 
se rv ice i s thus re la t ive ly l ow . The debt-to-GDP ra t io rose somewhat du r ing the past few 
years due t o devaluation o f the Guarani, while the ove ra l l external debt stock remained 
constant at about $2.7 b i l l i o n . 

100. W i t h regard to IBRD exposure, Paraguay exceeds one o f the indicators, namely 
the mu l t i la te ra l share o f p u b l i c debt service, w h i c h i s about 60 percent o f the total. This 
h i g h share i s due t o Paraguay’s heavy reliance o n mu l t i la te ra l lenders, in particular, the 
IDB, w h i c h ho lds about one - th i rd o f to ta l pub l ic debt. The reverse s ide o f this c o i n i s 
that the high share o f mu l t i la te ra l exposure accounts f o r m u c h o f the long -ma tu r i ty and 
low-interest rate structure o f Paraguay’s pub l ic debt. Paraguay i s b e l ow the other IBRD 
exposure indicators with debt service t o the W o r l d B a n k accounting f o r o n l y 2 percent o f 
exports and 17 percent o f pub l ic debt service. 

10 1. 
The rea l constraint o n Paraguay’s creditworthiness i s no t external, but rather the 
fragile state o f public finances, in w h i c h the re i s a constant struggle t o pay salaries, 
pensions and debt service, with l i t t l e l e f t over fo r operating expenses and investment. 
The severity o f this pos i t ion was h igh l igh ted late last year when the Government was 

3 0 

unable to stay current with payments t o the W o r l d Bank, and disbursements were 
suspended fo r t h r e e months f r om January through mid-April. The new Adm in is t ra t ion i s 
keenly aware o f the structural weaknesses in public f inances , w h i c h i s why i t has 
assigned f i r s t p r i o r i t y t o r e f o rm government pensions and the tax regime in order to put 
public finances o n a mo re sustainable basis f r om the beginning o f i t s t e r m o f o f f ice . 

Key Risks and Strategy f o r Manag ing Them 

102. 

The overall r i s k s o f re-engaging with Paraguay o n a mean ing fu l l e v e l are h igh . 
To start, the re are a number o f risks that are l e s s present in countries where the Bank has 
maintained a more continuous operational presence. The f i r s t such risk i s that in the 
absence o f a long-standing dialogue o n po l icy re fo rm and in l i g h t o f past p o l i c y reversals 
(e.g., suspension o f the p r iva t iza t ion p rog ram in 2002), the p rog ram may go o f f track 
early on. This w o u l d be the case i f the Congress does no t complete i t s s ide o f the 
“Acuerdo Politico” and approve the proposed tax and pension r e f o rm laws soon after 
disbursement o f the E m . The exposure risk wou ld be even greater i f this p o l i t i c a l 
backtracking occurs after disbursement o f the f i r s t tranche o f the FSAL. The lack o f 
experience in this type o f arrangements may entail some increased risk in comparison 
with other countries fam i l ia r with adjustment type lending. O n the other hand, the good 
record the authorities have demonstrated in managing the process provides the Bank team 
with reasonable assurances o f success in be ing able t o deliver in this ambitious endeavor. 

103. 

M i t i g a t i n g this risk o f p o l i t i c a l backtracking i s the fact that the Adm in is t ra t ion i s 
advancing i t s re fo rm agenda at the beg inn ing o f i t s t e r m when i t s p o l i t i c a l capital and 
public standing i s high, n o t in the middle or end o f i t s t e r m as was t h e case with the 
p r iva t iza t ion program. A lso , the Adm in is t ra t ion has succeeded in ga in ing the support o f 
some o f the m a i n groups affected by i t s proposals, such as the business organizations 
with regard to tax r e f o rm and the teachers unions with regard t o pension re fo rm . Across 
the po l i t ica l spectrum, a l l parties acknowledge the need fo r fundamental changes in the 
management o f the economy. 

104. While these factors p rov ide some comfort, the proposed strategy also attempts to 
manage this risk th rough up f ron t p r i o r actions required fo r the ERL and the selection o f

banking reso lu t ion and deposit insurance l aw that i s currently scheduled f o r approval by 
Congress p r i o r to consideration o f this C A S by the B a n k Board. While approval o f the 
tax and pension re fo rm laws i s no t a p r i o r cond i t ion f o r consideration o f the FSAL, the 
proposed Bank strategy does expect that Congress w i l l make considerable progress in i t s 
treatment o f these laws be fo re the FSAL w i l l be ready fo r Boa rd consideration. And 
passage o f these laws i s ce r ta in ly expected p r io r to release o f a second tranche o f the

subject to continued progress o n the lend ing triggers, and the Adm in is t ra t ion i s keenly 
aware o f the negative image that w o u l d r e s u l t i f a Bank p rog ram o f re-engagement were 
t o go o f f track early on. The comb ina t ion o f these factors should thus p rov ide sufficient 
comfort to warrant tak ing the risk o f ma tch ing an ambitious r e f o rm p rog ram with an 
ambitious p rog ram o f f inanc ia l support.

105. 

A second risk o f re-engagement concerns the a b i l i t y o f the Government to 
manage a considerably larger W o r l d Bank po r t fo l io , while ma in ta in ing an acceptable 
l e v e l o f p ro jec t implementation. Th is w i l l requ i re a ma jo r imp rovemen t in 
imp lemen ta t ion capacity vis-a-vis previous years . T o manage this risk, the Bank w i l l 
f o l l ow closely the measures the Ministry o f Finance has already taken t o imp rove the 
management o f external assistance (namely, the creation o f a central unit fo r investment 
and the proposed inco rpo ra t ion o f p lann ing in to the Ministry). Second, by f inanc ing 
technical assistance t o the Ministry o f Finance as part o f the “ministry o f excellence” 
project, the B a n k w i l l d i rec t ly support improvements in imp lemen ta t ion capacity and 
f o l l ow this process c lose ly th rough supervision o f the “ministry o f excellence” project. 
Third, the recent p o r t f o l i o review agreement o n generic p o r t f o l i o issues , such as 
appointment o f s ta f f based o n merit and access to counterpart fund ing (see Annex 3 fo r 
the full se t o f agreements), should p rov ide fo r a mo re fluid imp lemen ta t ion o f the base 
case lend ing program. 

106. 

F iduc ia ry risks are also noteworthy. In the area o f f inanc ia l management, there are 
tw o m a i n risk areas - tha t pe r ta in ing t o the ove ra l l management o f pub l ic expenditure, 
w h i c h has a d i rec t impac t o n Bank-funded adjustment operations, and that pe r ta in ing to 
the management o f the Bank - funded p o r t f o l i o o f investment operations. The Coun t ry 
F inanc ia l Accoun tab i l i ty Assessmen t that i s nearing comp le t ion has resulted in an agreed 
p re l im ina ry ac t ion p l a n that addressed the former. In addition, a number o f reforms 
supported by IDB-funded technical assistance projects are tak ing place in several key 
areas i n c l u d i n g budgeting, an t i -co r rup t ion and government auditing. The Bank w i l l 
continue t o m o n i t o r the imp lemen ta t ion o f these re fo rms during the C A S pe r iod and w i l l 
complement IDB support th rough future interventions. 

107. F inanc ia l management risks t o the Bank’s investment p o r t f o l i o have been 
evidenced by past p rob lems with misappropriations o f funds and weakness in the aud i t ing 
arrangements in a numbe r o f projects. However, past problems have been detected early 
o n th rough active supervision, w h i c h w i l l continue in the future. D e s p i t e these 
shortcomings, Paraguay’s reco rd o f compliance with aud i t requirements has been 
adequate. 

108. 

Procurement under Bank projects has been re la t ive ly f r e e o f ma jo r problems, 
although the re have been allegations o f corrupt procurement practices that have required 
Bank and Government action. Imp lemen ta t ion o f the n e w procurement l a w and 
mode rn iza t ion p l a n supported by the IDB i s expected t o bring about improvements, 
although procurement risk w i l l continue, at least in the medium-term, until the reforms 
a re fully implemented. To m i n im i z e the risk the B a n k w i l l continue p r o v i d i n g technical 
advice f o r the creation and imp lemen ta t ion o f agency procurement units as called fo r by 
the new l a w and w i l l con t inue to p rov ide close support and supervision. The Bank w i l l 
further ensu re that the p r inc ip les o f the procurement l a w are adhered t o in B a n k projects, 
as long as they a re consistent with the Bank’s guidelines. 

32 

109. Other risks to the p rog ram a re more o f a general macroeconomic nature. 
Paraguay, as a small open economy that trades considerably with i t s Mercosur partners, 
w i l l rema in vulnerable to regional shocks as occurred over the past fou r years when the 
respective devaluations o f the B raz i l ian Real and Argentine Peso upset t rad ing balances 
and led t o a compensating devaluation o f the Guarani, as well as the f inanc ia l crisis in 
Uruguay w h i c h led d i rec t ly t o the closing o f some financial institutions in Paraguay. 
Paraguay i s also vulnerable t o fluctuations in commod i ty prices, especially soy, cotton 
and meat, that can impac t economic ac t iv i ty and hence government revenues. 

1 10. The best strategy f o r managing such r i s k s i s fo r Paraguay t o regain a strong fiscal 
pos i t ion that w i l l a l l ow the Government to build up some precautionary balances, as well 
as strengthening the f inanc ia l system t o withstand a possible further deterioration in the 
qua l i ty o f commercial bank po r t fo l ios . The proposed CAS strategy o f p rov id ing early 
adjustment lend ing support to a new Adm in is t ra t ion that i s w i l l i n g t o spend i t s po l i t ica l 
capital in seeking the approval o f key reforms that w i l l strengthen the f isca l and financial 
situation i s thus the bes t risk management strategy against the impact o f future regional 
vo la t i l i ty o n Paraguay. Supporting po l ic ies that lead t o a stronger f isca l pos i t ion i s also 
the bes t strategy fo r managing payment risk t o the Bank, w h i c h i s s t i l l significant in l i g h t 
o f the i n a b i l i t y t o stay current with IBRD debt service earlier this year du r ing the last 
months o f the previous administration. 

1 1 1. F ina l ly , the B a n k should no t underestimate the forces o f the i n f o rm a l economy 
and other vested in te res ts that w i l l a im t o b lock the current crack d ow n o n co r rup t ion and 
the improvements in governance that the Government i s proposing. Such forces cou ld 
force the resignation o f current economic team and a reversion t o p o l i c y drift. I t i s 
d i f f i c u l t f o r the Bank i t s e l f t o manage such domestic risks, other than by p rov id ing 
support, in concert with other mu l t i la te ra l institutions, t o the reformers in government as 
a signal o f international commitment t o the reforms they are championing. 

1 12. 
In the current Paraguay case, i t i s the President himself who i s at the p o l i t i c a l 
forefront o f the r e f o rm and anti-corruption e f fo r t and, due t o the leg i t imacy o f h i s 
election, i s no t l i k e l y t o be forced f r om o f f ice o r replaced du r ing the current five-year 
t e r m (until August 2008). I t i s in the President’s o w n in te res t t o keep a strong economic 
team in place and to ob ta in approval o f the proposed reforms o n an expedited schedule. 
T o a limited extent, the Bank cou ld support this in i t ia t ive though mo re active outreach to 
other branches o f government and the public, stressing the importance o f sound economic 
policies and the po ten t ia l bene f i ts o f re fo rms that address key constraints t o Paraguay’s 
economic, social and ins t i tu t iona l development. 

Expected Results o f the CAS 

1 13. The proposed p rog ram by n o means addresses a l l o f the development agenda in 
Paraguay, f o r example, the base case p rog ram does no t include the restructuring o f pub l ic 
en te rp r ises , the opening o f infrastructure t o p r iva te sector investment, o r the creation o f 
conditional cash transfer social p ro tec t ion programs, a l l o f w h i c h w o u l d on ly be 
supported in the h i g h case. Also, Paraguay’s development outcomes w i l l depend o n a 

3 3 

host o f factors other than the Bank ’s program, in particular, the po l ic ies that the 
Adm in is t ra t ion chooses t o f o l l o w and the assistance programs o f other external partners, 
several o f w h i c h p rov ide mo re assistance than the Bank. Yet, t h e proposed p rog ram i s 
ambitious given Paraguay’s current context, and the outcomes cou ld be h i g h l y rewarding 
and help se t the coun t ry o n a new development path. 

114. 

Ind ica t ive outcomes and intermediate resu l ts indicators a re presented in the CAS 
Program M a t r i x o n the f o l l ow i n g pages. Some o f the highlights o f these indicators are 
listed be low : 

S tab i l iza t ion o f p u b l i c finances and the increased l i k e l i h o o d o f f isca l 
sustainability over the medium term , as indicated by an increase in tax revenues 
by 1 .5 percent o f GDP by the end o f 2005; 

0 A sounder f inanc ia l sector that w o u l d lowe r the cost o f po ten t ia l bank failures and 
p rov ide a sounder basis f o r the mob i l iza t ion o f domestic savings, as ind ica ted by 
the existence o f a func t ion ing p r iva te ly - f inanced deposit insurance scheme by 
2005 and the increase o f commercial bank capital to Base l standards by 2007; 

Imp roved transparency and governance in pub l ic administration, especially in the 
Ministry o f Finance w h i c h cou ld act as a mode l fo r other ministries t o fo l low , as 
evidenced by the inco rpo ra t ion o f pub l ic en te rp r ises and decentralized agencies 
i n t o the central f inanc ia l management system by the end o f 2004 and the ma jo r i ty 
o f pub l ic procurement tak ing place v i a i n t e r n e t by the end o f 2005; 

0 

Imp roved p r o d u c t i v i t y in the ru ra l sector, especially among sma l l farmers where 
pove r ty i s concentrated and deepest, as evidence by the scaling up t o the na t iona l 
l e v e l o f an im p r o v e d extension mode l based o n commun i ty pa r t ic ipa t ion and 
imp roved s o i l management techniques by 2007; and 

0 Gradual imp rovemen t in social indicators, as evidenced by an increase in the 
secondary school enrolment rate f r om 3 3 percent t o 42 percent by 2007, inc lud ing 
a na r row ing o f the u rban - ru ra l divide, and decreases in the i n f a n t and maternal- 
mo r ta l i ty rates by 10 percent by 2007. 

1 15 . 

I t i s proposed that the p rog ram be reviewed in a mid-term progress repo r t to the

CAS Objective 3. Sustainable Growth 

6. 

Paraguay i s one o f the mos t ru ra l and poorest o f South Ame r ican countries, with 
44% o f i t s popu la t ion and 56% o f i t s poo r in ru ra l areas. The Bank strategy to address 
this broad i s s u e includes projects in the ru ra l sector and infrastructure (especially in ru ra l 
water supply, sanitation, and roads), as well as l i n k s with human development (education, 
health, and social protection) lending. 

7 . 

Supporting small farmers. The Sustainable R u r a l Investment P ro jec t (FY0.5) 
w i l l focus on scaling up the already p rom is ing r e s u l t s o f the Na tu ra l Resources 
Management Project through sma l l farmer assistance in most o f the eastern pa r t o f the 
country. The p ro jec t w i l l promote decentralized watershed management planning, crop 
diversification, risk m i t iga t ion , and commun i ty participation, la rge ly th rough CDD - type 
f inanc ing and cost-sharing combined with the r e f o rm o f agricultural extension services. 

8. 

Promoting sustainable forestry and growth. Paraguay has l o n g been a 
t rad i t iona l wood exporter, but uncon t ro l led deforestation fo r agriculture and l ives tock has 
resulted in severe environmental degradation and in Paraguay becom ing a n e t wood 
impo r te r and los ing i t s g row th po ten t ia l in this sector. The Fo res t ry Development P ro jec t

9 . 

Improving property rights. The i s s u e o f land ownership i s a foca l point, albeit a 
d i f f i c u l t one, fo r achieving ru ra l development in Paraguay. L a n d ownership i s among the 
mos t skewed in South America, with 10% o f the popu la t ion ow n i n g tw o thirds o f the land 
and one third o f the popu la t ion ow n i n g no land at a l l . F r om a social perspective, this 
i s s u e l i e s at the core o f the country 's income inequality; f r om an ag r icu l tu ra l perspective, 
i t lowe rs overall ag r icu l tu ra l p roduc t iv i ty , and f r om an environmental perspective, i t 
drives the poor onto ma rg ina l lands, fue l ing deforestation and l a n d degradation. To 
address this issue , s tud ies o n land ownership and u s e (as pa r t o f the proposed Ru ra l 
Sector Strategy) and l a n d taxes (to better address b o t h f isca l and land use objectives) w i l l

10. 

Regarding infrastructure and business development, the CAS strategies are: 

0 Significant improvements in public infrastructure spending. Considering the 

infrastructure bottlenecks and the d e f i c i t in investment and maintenance fo r basic 
infrastructure in Paraguay, the interventions proposed in infrastructure w i l l focus 
o n expanding coverage o f basic services and reducing log is t ic costs, with a focus 
o n imp roved qua l i ty and composition o f expenditures. The proposed projects w i l l 
imp rove the cond i t ion and sustainability o f the road network, expand coverage o f 
water supply and sanitation, and assist mun ic ipa l i t ies in developing p r i o r i t y 
mun ic ipa l leve l infrastructure. 

0 

Innovative Private Public Partnerships. Given the large f inanc ing 

requirements o f infrastructure, there needs t o be an e f fo r t to mob i l ize private- 
pub l ic partnerships to imp rove the coverage, qua l i ty and a f fo rdab i l i ty o f 
infrastructure se rv ices . Innova t ive contracts are be ing developed in ru ra l water 
supply w h i c h w o u l d continue to be supported under the water supply and 
sanitation projects. The minimum subsidy concession (MSC) p rog ram c a n be 
expanded t o extend water and sewerage systems in areas where the public water 
en t i t ies do n o t operate. Under MSCs, the Government pays an agreed 
compe t i t ive ly -b id subsidy to the p r iva te operator who offers t o build and operate 
the system f o r the lowest price. This approach has already been successfully 
p i lo ted in Paraguay with r e s u l t s that reduced investment costs by ha l f . The 
Government has also expressed interest in imp lemen t ing performance-based road 
maintenance contracts which cou ld replace force account (administracion directa) 
o r t rad i t iona l unit p r ice contracts to ma in ta in the core national road ne two rk and 
some ru ra l roads w h i c h can be supported under the road project. Substantial 
savings o n a per k i lome te r basis have been achieved in ne ighbo r ing countries with 
this system. Private sector concessions cou ld be awarded f o r the maintenance o f 
selected high t ra f f ic vo lume corridors (“Plan Triangulo”), and eventually fo r some 
new road construction and other infrastructure investments. 

0 Support f o r Public Utility Companies. The Cons t i tu t ion supports the imp roved 
e f f ic iency o f public utility companies and also o f a market-opening strategy in 
areas where public en te rp r ises continue t o operate in a monopo ly position. In the 
current f isca l t igh t environment, the Government i s in te res ted in obtaining 
technical assistance support with the re fo rm o f basic telephone serv ice , the 
impo r ta t ion and d is t r ibu t ion o f d iese l fue l , and eventually e lec t r ic i ty distribution. 

0 Business Environment Improvement. A key ob jec t ive o f a l l interventions 

du r ing the C A S pe r iod w i l l be to imp rove the business environment, simplify 
procedures, imp rove the qua l i ty o f Paraguayan products and adoption o f bes t 
practice technical norms, increase access to f inanc ing and fac i l i ta te and promote

CAS Objective 4. Soc ia l Sectors and Inclusion 

18 . 

The proposed w o r k p rog ram in education, health, social p ro tec t ion and 
community development constitutes the fou r th p i l la r o f this CAS, social inclusion. The 
proposed activities w o u l d be closely aligned with the imp lemen ta t ion o f the Paraguay 
Poverty Reduc t ion Strategy (PRS) w h i c h i s currently in the f i n a l stages o f validation. 
Obviously, pove r ty reduc t ion and social inc lus ion cannot n o t be carried by social policies 
alone and a successful implementation o f the Paraguay’s PRS hinges c ruc ia l ly on 
rev i ta l iz ing growth, especially in the ru ra l areas. But im p r o v i n g p ro tec t ion o f the poorest 
as well as assisting them in education and imp rov ing their hea l th w i l l be necessary fo r 
today’s poo r t o be able t o benefit and participate in a rev i ta l ized economy. 

19. 

For social services t o reach the poo r in Paraguay, a number o f re fo rms are 
necessary w h i c h go beyond sector investments and sector po l ic ies and w h i c h are central 
t o this CAS . Such necessary cross-sectoral reforms w o u l d inc lude (i) imp rov ing the 
overall expenditure d is t r ibu t ion t o favor p rov is ion o f basic services and assistance 
programs in the poorest areas; (ii) imp rov ing budget p lann ing and execution; (iii) 
ra t iona l iz ing human resource p lann ing and in t roduc ing incentives f o r s ta f f t o delivery 
qua l i ty services; (iv) ensuring that use r costs fo r services contribute t o the effective 
delivery o f services at the l e v e l at which they are collected while in t roduc ing exemption 
policies fo r the poor; and (v) in t roduc ing specific outreach activities t o reach the 
indigenous popu la t ion in Paraguay. 

20. 

Over the C A S period, the Bank w o u l d be w o r k i n g with Government in four areas: 

(i) Improving the quality o f education and increasing enrolment rates in 

secondary school i s at the heart o f the Government’s r e f o rm agenda in the 
education sector. Ove ra l l enrolment rates in p r im a r y education are h i g h but in 
secondary education very l o w (3 1 percent), with s t r ik ing d i f fe rences between 
urban (83 percent) and ru ra l (17 percent) areas. The reform, w h i c h the Bank 
i s already accompanying through an approved F i r s t Educa t ion Reform P ro jec t 
(FY04), includes the (i) development o f a comprehensive and cu l tu ra l ly 
appropriate p rog ram t o imp rove access t o education by t h e ru ra l and 
indigenous population, especially at the secondary level; (ii) improvement o f 
sector e f f ic iency and management capacity, inc lud ing p lann ing and 
management o f human resource, information, evaluation, and supervision 
sys tems at the central, state and loca l leve ls ; (iii) imp rovemen t o f teacher and 
leadership capacity th rough improvements in teacher t ra in ing nationwide and 
preparation o f a core group o f education leaders; and (iv) p rov is ion o f

opportunities fo r extremely poor children (scholarships) and alternatives fo r

The proposed w o r k program du r ing this CAS pe r iod w o u l d support the 
ongo ing reforms through an Eva lua t ion of Secondary Educa t ion ESW as well 
as through the second phase o f the adjustable program lend ing Second 
Educa t ion Reform P ro jec t (FY07). 

(ii) Increasing efficiency and equity in the health sector i s central to our health 
dialogue w h i c h w o u l d be guided by the r e s u l t s o f a Hea l th Sector Review 
(FY05). W h i l e health outcomes in Paraguay a r e poor, especially in ru ra l 
areas, basic pub l ic health services are concentrated in u rban areas and tend to 
p rov ide higher comp lex i ty services fo r the 20 percent o f the popu la t ion 
covered by some sort o f health insurance. Hea l th service p roduc t iv i ty i s l o w 
and unequal across regions. Reorienting services towards basic and 
preventive hea l th w i l l require additional resources and/or a ma jo r increase in 
the e f f ic iency o f delivery w h i c h w o u l d inc lude re fo rm ing hea l th p rov is ion o f 
the pub l ic insurance scheme. A proposed Second Hea l th P ro jec t (FY05) 
w o u l d assist Government in imp lemen t ing a ma te rna l -ch i ld hea l th insurance 
scheme fo r today’s poor and uninsured, especially in ru ra l areas, by 
strengthening hea l th p rov is ion o f loca l health councils. Such a shift towards 
p r im a r y care w o u l d necessitate key changes in health sector financing, 
inc lud ing a r e f o rm o f the current use r cost system and human resource 
management, comp r is ing the in t roduc t ion o f i n c e n t i v e s f o r qua l i ty delivery o f 
services. 

(iii) Introducing fundamental reforms to the pension system and creating a 
basic safety net for the poorest w o u l d be gu id ing our w o r k p rog ram with 
respect t o social protection. A Soc ia l P ro tec t ion Study (FY04) w i l l include a 
detailed analysis o f Paraguay’s social security and assistance system. Social 
assistance spending i s very l o w compared with countries at s im i la r levels o f 
income per capita, be ing spread over a large number o f sma l l programs and 
hence reaching o n l y a small f rac t ion o f the poo r . In parallel, social security 
expenditures are ve ry h i g h (3.5 percent) but they are absorbed almost entirely 
f o r spending o n pensions w h i c h benefit few and do no t reach the poor. A 
Soc ia l P ro tec t ion Technical Assistance P ro jec t (FY05) w o u l d assist 
Government t o rationalize (and expand) the many ex is t ing social assistance 
programs and prepare a comprehensive r e f o rm o f the pension system. In the 
h i g h case lend ing scenario, such technical assistance w o u l d support a Soc ia l 
P ro tec t ion Adjustment Loan w h i c h wou ld support a fundamental overhaul o f 
the pension and social assistance system, inc lud ing the creation o f a safety n e t 
fo r the poorest, inc lud ing those elderly poo r w i thou t pension coverage today. 

(iv)

and marginal communities i s an impo r tan t e lemen t fo r im p r o v i n g social

Annex 1. Progress Towards Reaching the MDGs in Paraguay 

Background 

1. 

The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) were agreed t o by the leaders o f a l l 
United Na t ions member countries in September 2000 in the Millennium Declaration, as 
modifications o f the International Development Goals (IDGs) o r ig ina l ly established b y 
the OECD Development Assistance Committee in 1996. Seven o f the goals focus o n 
spec i f ic aspects o f the multiple dimensions o f poverty and the e igh th focuses o n 
strengthening the support o f the international commun i ty t o achieve these goals. M a n y o f 
the goals specify quantitative targets and indicators t o measure progress towa rd reaching 
the goals. 

2. 

This note summarizes the progress and challenges faced by Paraguay t o achieve 
the MDGs. The United Na t ions has committed to repo r t ing the progress o f reaching the 
MDGs in co l labo ra t ion with other institutions, inc lud ing the W o r l d Bank, the IMF, 
OECD and other reg iona l agencies.' This report relies o n Government statistics and 
recen t assessments made by UNDP , the W o r l d Bank and EC L AC . 2 

3 . 

In the last decade, the stability and sustainability o f economic progress in 
Paraguay has been threatened by weak governance and institutions, increasing poverty, 
and a deterioration o f the environment. In 2002, a Na t iona l Poverty and Inequa l i ty 
Reduction Strategy was developed with the objective t o reduce poverty, especially in 
ru ra l areas, o n the basis o f sustained economic growth, improvements in human capital, 
attention t o vulnerable groups, environmental sustainability and strengthening o f the 
social fabric with greater gender equality and c iv ic participation. The strategy pledges fo r 
greater in te r - ins t i tu t iona l and inter-sectoral coordination o f pub l ic agencies and calls fo r 
support f r om the in te rna t iona l community. I t i s exp l ic i t ly linked t o the MDGs, us ing the 
same timeline and targets. H e n c e mon i to r ing o f progress towards the MDGs i s key to 
i n f o rm the pub l ic po l ic ies ou t l ined in the strategy. 

4. 

While Paraguay has made important progress towards reaching some o f the 
MDGs, the re are several areas in w h i c h the country i s o f f - t rack o r e v e n f a l l i n g behind. 
The f o l l ow i n g describes the situation o f the country in each o f the goals, h igh l igh t ing key 
challenges t o accelerate progress.

Goa l 1: E rad ica te Ex t reme Poverty and Hunge r 
Target: Cut in half from1 990 to 2015 the fraction of the population in extreme poverty 

5 . 

One o f the indicators to measure this goal i s the f rac t ion o f the popu la t ion l i v i n g 
on incomes be low $ l / d a y PPP. Data fo r this indicator are no t available fo r Paraguay. 
However, since an income o f $ l / d a y i s no t s u f f i c i e n t t o buy the basic na t iona l food 
basket, the national indigence l i n e ' i s a more appropriate indicator to mon i to r this goal. 
Consistent pove r ty figures with national coverage have become available on ly in recent 
years p rec lud ing the u s e o f a base l i n e f r om the early 1990s. Poverty rates have increased 
s ince 1995. In 1995, 13.9 pe rcen t o f the popu la t ion had incomes be low the national 
indigence l i n e and by 2001 this f rac t ion had increased to15.6 percent, while to ta l poverty 
increased f r om 30 pe rcen t to 34 pe rcen t du r ing this period. P re l im ina ry r e s u l t s f r om the 
2002 household survey suggest that the re m i g h t have been an increase in poverty. 
Chronic ma lnu t r i t ion in ch i ld ren under age 5 , the indicator used t o mon i to r hunger, has 
also increased. By 2001 4.6 pe rcen t o f ch i ld ren under age 5 had l o w we igh t fo r their age 
up f r om 3.7 percent in 1990. 

6. 
Thus, the country has been m o v i n g o f f - t rack t o m e e t this key goal. The SimSIP 
simulations find that o n the basis o f a projected 2.6 pe rcen t annual GDP g row th through 
2015 and n o ma jo r new efforts Paraguay i s unlikely t o reduce pove r ty and extreme 
poverty by 50 pe rcen t by 2015. A recent U N D P assessment also deems unlikely fo r the 
country t o m e e t the goal. However, expectations are s t i l l favorable t o the country 
reaching the hunger reduc t ion target. B o t h U N D P and WB SimSIP assessments find that 
the country i s s t i l l likely t o halve the under 5 ma lnu t r i t ion rate despite the increase seen 
recently. 

7. 
H o w much longer Paraguay takes t o achieve this goal w i l l depend o n whether 
sustained g r ow t h and considerable improvements in social p o l i c y are realized. This w i l l 
require ma in ta in ing macroeconomic and p o l i t i c a l stability, strengthening governance and 
institutions, an increase in investment, g row th in agriculture and exports th rough ru ra l 
development that improves p roduc t iv i ty o f the poor, support to loca l development 
projects and increased c i v i c pa r t ic ipa t ion f r om vulnerable groups. Strengthening the 
institutions and programs w h i c h p rov ide services t o the poo r th rough decentralization and 
greater transparency and accountability and imp roved coordination between the many 
government agencies and actors in these programs w i l l be necessary t o ensure that 
resources are used e f fec t ive ly .

Goal 2: Universal Primary Education Completion 
Target: Ensu re tha t all ch i ld ren complete the cycle of basic education by 2015 

8 . 

Re fo rms t o the p u b l i c education system in Paraguay began in 1994 . These 
reforms inc luded a change in the starting age fo r p r ima ry education f r om 7 t o 6 and an 
extension in the length o f primary education f r om 6 to 9 years. Howeve r , en ro l lmen t in 
the f i r s t and second cycles (grades 1-6) f e l l f r om 93 percent in 1990 t o 90 percent in 
2001 . The en ro l lmen t in the third cyc le (grades 7 - 9 ) , however, did increase s ign i f ican t ly 
f r om 27 percent in 1990 t o 5 3 percent in 2001 . The UNDP and WB assessments find that 
achieving a 100 percent en ro l lmen t in primary education by 20 15 i s s t i l l likely. 
Comp le t ion th rough grade 5 seems also o n track t o reaching the goal, hav ing increased 
f r om 7 0 percent in 1990 t o 7 8 percent in 2000 . 

9 . 

Am o n g the key challenges t o achieve this goal are reduc ing high repe t i t ion rates, 
socio and geographic differences in education qua l i ty and expanding equal access to 
education by im p r o v i n g educational infrastructure. Po l icy p r io r i t ies inc lude evaluation o f 
current programs in order t o replicate successful strategies and p r om o t i n g programs that 
reduce repe t i t ion and drop-out rates. Strengthening t ra in ing programs fo r teachers, 
extending the number o f hours in classes and developing commun i ty pa r t ic ipa t ion are 
also key e lemen ts o f the required educational p o l i c y package.

Goal 3: Gender Equality and Empowerment o f Women 
Target: Ensure gender equality in access to a l l levels of education by 201 5 

10. 
The targets f o r this goal points to equality fo r g i r ls and boys in access t o p r ima ry 
and secondary education, and greater economic and c iv ic pa r t ic ipa t ion o f women. 
Equa l i ty in education has basically been achieved in Paraguay, with near equal 
enrollment in p r ima ry and secondary education o f g i r ls and boys, as well as near equal 
literacy rates. A l t h o u g h data i s fragmentary l e s s equality exists in the economic sphere 
and even l e s s in p o l i t i c a l participation. Just over 40 pe rcen t o f w o r k i n g age women 
participate in the non -ag r icu l tu ra l labor sector compared to 75 pe rcen t o f men. Also, 
female p o l i t i c a l pa r t ic ipa t ion has almost doubled since 1989. Women 's seats in Congress 
have r i s e n t o 13 seats in 2003, but s t i l l on ly 8 percent o f the seats are filled by women. 

1 1. 
Ac t ions t o fac i l i ta te the equal participation o f women in the labor market and in 
po l i t ica l ins t i tu t ions a re needed. Further development o f the o f f ice o f the Secretary o f 
Women th rough greater coordination with other departments and programs can favor 
improvements in the status o f women. Labor ma rke t interventions that imp rove j o b 
opportunities fo r women are also important, as well as c h i l d care programs that can a l low 
more women t o wo rk . Add i t iona l ly , p romo t ing better access o f women to the bene f i ts o f

Goal 4: Reduce Mortality o f Children under 5 
Target: Cut in two thirds from1990 to 2015 the under 5 mortality rates 

12. 
The Millennium Development Goal calls f o r a 2/3 reduc t ion o f the mo r ta l i ty rates 
o f children under 5 years old. The indicators fo r this goal inc lude in fan t mo r ta l i ty (deaths 
per 1,000 births) and under 5 c h i l d mo r ta l i ty (deaths per 1,000 births). While the recent 
UND P assessment deems likely that the country can m e e t this goal, the W o r l d Bank 

49 

CAS Annex I 
Page 5 of9 

SimSIP analysis indicates that Paraguay i s far behind and unlikely t o achieve this goal by 
2015. 

13. 

Adm in is t ra t ive records o f the Ministry o f Pub l ic Hea l th and Social We l l -Be ing 
indicate that the registered in fan t mo r ta l i ty rate has fa l len f r om 30.4 per 1,000 births in 
1990 t o 19.7 in 2001. Also, the registered under 5 mo r ta l i ty rate has dropped f r om 40 to 
25 in the same period. However, while the re have been improvements in o f f i c i a l 
registers, these figures may be affected by significant underreporting. The General 
Statistics O f f ice o f Surveys and Census (DGEEC) estimates that the in fan t mo r ta l i ty i s 
much higher than registered. The registered rates are about h a l f o f DGEEC adjusted rates. 
In any case, bo th sources indicate that the country i s o f f - t rack t o m e e t the 2/3 reduction 
by 2015. 

14. 
New data and analysis i s needed to clearly ascertain the trends and m a i n causes o f 
in fan t mo r ta l i ty so as to be t te r i n f o rm the pub l ic po l ic ies needed t o accelerate progress 
towards this MDG. One central challenge to further reducing c h i l d mo r ta l i ty i s 
strengthening the emphasis o n preventive rather that curative care with scaled up cost- 
effective interventions inc lud ing imp roved education and health o f mothers. Paraguay has 
a multitude o f programs r a n by b o t h the Government and NGO s aimed at reducing infant 
mo r ta l i ty . Decentralization cou ld imp rove de l ive ry o f serv ices , and increased 
pa r t ic ipa t ion o f the NGO s i s desired. A recent careful impact evaluation o f a pa r t icu la r ly 
innovative one, the Cuban doctors intervention, suggest that integrated p r ima ry health 
care interventions with active loca l pa r t ic ipa t ion can indeed constitute a cost-effective 
strategy (Molinas and Galiani, 2003). Im p r o v i n g the mon i to r ing system and registered 
data i s a top p r io r i ty , as well as increasing the demand fo r services th rough commun i ty 
development programs. The A IEP I ' , a p rog ram o f integrated attention o f prevalent in fan t

Goal 5: Reduce M a t e r n a l Mo r t a l i t y 

Target: Cut in three fourths from1990 to 2015 the maternal mortality rate 

15. 
Da ta l im i ta t ions again preclude to clearly ascertain whether maternal mo r ta l i ty 
rates have declined o r increased since 1990. Acco rd ing to administrative hea l th records, 
the country seems t o be o f f - t rack t o mee t this goal. D u r i n g 1990-1 997 the registered rate 
f e l l f r om 150 t o 102 (a 67 percent decline) and increased to 160 in 2001, A lso , the 
p ropo r t ion o f births attended by a med ica l professional f e l l f r om 66 percent in 1990 to 61 
percent in 1998. Howeve r , as with in fan t mo r ta l i ty , many maternal deaths rema in 
unregistered. The D G E E C estimates that maternal mo r ta l i ty f e l l f r om 34 1 per 100,000 
l ive births in 1990 t o 187 in 1997 (a 54.8 percent decline). There are n o t recent estimates 
o f the adjusted rates. In any case, these figures indicate that the target fo r maternal 
mo r ta l i ty i s unlikely t o be reach. The country's challenges l i e in n o t o n l y reduc ing the 
ove ra l l mo r ta l i ty rate, but reduc ing the gap in mo r ta l i ty rates that e x i s t between areas. 
Fo r example, in Asunc ion in 200 1 , the maternal mo r ta l i ty rate was 2 1 per 100,000 l ive 
births, while in the mos t ly r u r a l Caazapa the rate was 214 per 100,000 l i v e births. 

16. 
The m a i n causes o f ma te rna l deaths are preventable, such as hemorrhages du r ing 
birth and pregnancy, w h i c h cou ld be greatly reduced by im p r o v i n g o n the l o w rate o f 
births attended by hea l th professionals, especially in ru ra l areas. As with c h i l d mortality, 
programs that expand services p r o v i s i o n as well as increase the demand f o r pre-birth 
preventive services are v i t a l t o reduc ing maternal mo r ta l i ty in the country. M a n y 
programs have been established t o target maternal mo r ta l i ty , as pa r t o f the Na t iona l 
Reproductive H e a l t h P l a n o f 1997-200 1 , however limited funds and coo rd ina t ion 
problems continue t o limit effectiveness.

1999 increased the number o f infected cases f r om 23 to 412 per 100,000, i t has no t 
caused any deaths since 1989. A network o f vigilance has been established in

The incidence o f tuberculosis has been s low ly f a l l i n g f r om 5 1 per 100,000 people 
in 1990 to 3 5 in 2000, but i t i s believed there this may mask an increase in the number o f 
unregistered cases. M o r t a l i t y rates f r om tuberculosis have r i s e n s l igh t ly f r om 3 to 4 per 
100,000 people between 1990 and 2000, but the re has been increasing success with 
DO T S treatments'. There are important differences in incidence and mo r ta l i ty rates 
between geographical areas and socio-economic status. The Na t iona l Program t o Con t ro l 
Tuberculosis has b e e n w o r k i n g to increase treatment by D O T S through pub l ic and private

This goal includes in teg ra t ing sustainable development practices i n t o policies, and 
increasing access t o safe drinking water and sanitation to imp rove the l i v e s o f slum 
dwellers. The p ropo r t ion o f l a n d covered by dense forest has declined reaching an 
estimated 7 percent in 1997. Paraguay has made considerable improvements in the 
p ropo r t ion o f the popu la t ion with access to safe d r ink ing water. Between 1992 and 2001 
the p ropo r t ion has increased f r om 25.4 percent to 52.5 percent so the coun t ry i s well o n 
the way to reach one o f the targets f o r this goal. However, there rema in challenges to 
imp rove access in ru ra l areas, w h i c h was o n l y 2 1 percent in 2001 compared with 80 
percent in u rban areas. These figures are among the lowest in L a t i n Ame r ica . A strategy 
i s underway fo r reaching poo r and r u r a l communities, inc lud ing innova t ive interventions 
fo r pe r i -u rban areas and larger r u r a l communities. Sustained f inanc ia l support i s needed 
to achieve mean ing fu l progress towards this MDG. 

22. 
The targets calls fo r reduc ing by h a l f the p ropo r t ion o f popu la t ion w i thou t access 
to safe drinking water or sanitation. The country appears o f f - t rack t o reaching a 50 
percent reduc t ion in the p ropo r t ion o f the popu la t ion w i thou t access t o sanitation. 
Between 1992 and 200 1, the percentage o f the to ta l popu la t ion with access t o the 
adequate qua l i ty sanitation ne two rk increased o n l y 2 percentage points, f r om 7.2 percent 
t o 9.2 percent, while the urban popu la t ion with access f e l l f r om 18.3 percent t o 16.9 
percent during the s am e period.' 

23. 
Am o n g the m a i n challenges to imp rove access t o safe water and sanitation are 
limited f inanc ia l resources fo r expansion o f service networks and d i f f icu l t ies in 
coordinating the adm in is t ra t ion and maintenance o f current infrastructure. There i s also a 
need to reve rse the loss o f environmental resources w h i c h requ i res strengthening the

Summary 

24. 
While Paraguay has made some important progress towards the MDGs, there a re 
s t i l l many areas in w h i c h the coun t ry i s o f f - t rack or f a l l i n g behind. Comp le t ion rates in 
primary education have been increasing and are currently o n t rack to reach universal 
completion. Gender equa l i ty in education has been achieved, a l though t h e country i s far 
behind f r om gender equa l i ty in the economic and p o l i t i c a l pa r t ic ipa t ion spheres. Da ta are 
lack ing o n the H I V / A I D S situation, but tuberculosis has been decreasing and country 
programs seem t o be successful at con t inua l ly reducing incidence per 100,000 people. 
While under reg is t ra t ion o f c h i l d and maternal mo r ta l i ty makes i t d i f f i c u l t t o completely 
assess recent and prospective progress, the country seems unlikely t o reach the c h i l d 
mo r ta l i ty reduc t ion target by t h e 20 15 w i thou t ma jo r add i t iona l e f fo r ts o n this front. 
Poverty has been increasing recen t ly pu t t ing the country o f f - t rack to reach the pove r ty 
reduc t ion target. A l t h o u g h the target o f ha lv ing the popu la t ion with hunger by 20 15 i s 
s t i l l possible, c h i l d m a l n u t r i t i o n rates have r i s e n recently. F ina l ly , i t appears that the 
country i s o n t rack o r l ike ly t o reduce the p ropo r t ion o f the popu la t ion w i thou t access t o 
safe water, but i s far behind reaching the access to sanitation target. 

25. 

Strengthening o f decentralization, scaling up successful in i t ia t ives and better 
coo rd ina t ion o f the various Government and p r iva te programs with incidence in the 
MDGs i s v i t a l t o accelerate the country’s progress towa rd ach iev ing these goals. The 
country faces f inanc ia l and technical constraints to expanding successful programs so the 
comm i tmen t and support f r om the international commun i ty i s also necessary.

Annex 2. Evaluation o f Bank Assistance and Portfolio Implementation 

Previous Bank Assistance and Overall Evaluation 

1 . 

The Bank has no t played a ma jo r ro le in Paraguay, where i t i s on ly the fou r th 
largest o f f i c i a l lender, after the IDB (by far the largest lender), Japan Bank fo r 
International Cooperation and Taiwan. Since lend ing began in 1952 , IBRD/IDA lending 
has typ ica l ly i n v o l v e d one o r tw o operations per year. IDA lend ing ended in 1977 . 
Overall, the Bank’s operational experience has been mixed. D u r i n g the pe r iod f r om 1952 
t o 1984 , lend ing centered o n regional agricultural developments, transport, education, 
water supply and sanitation, and indus t r ia l credit. A l though the projects’ physical 
objectives were la rge ly achieved, the pace o f implementation was s low and ins t i tu t ion 
b u i l d i n g efforts were generally l e s s successful. T w o notable exceptions were in the water 
supply and education sectors, where projects built successfully o n Paraguay’s strong 
t rad i t ion o f commun i ty participation. 

2 . 

This was fo l lowed by a hiatus in Bank lend ing between 1984 and 1992 . In 1984 
the Bank suspended lend ing to Paraguay due t o disagreements o n macroeconomic issues . 
In 1989 , at the end o f the Stroessner regime, the Bank resumed preparation o f new 
projects and launched an intensive program o f economic and sector w o r k (ESW) t o 
update i t s know ledge base. A l though the ESW was well focused, many o f the Bank’s 
recommendations were no t adopted by Government, f o r example the need t o imp rove 
f inanc ia l regu la t ion and supervision and imp rove management o f pub l ic en terpr ises , 
inc lud ing p r iva t iza t ion . M o s t o f these recommendations were no t translated in to action. 
Similarly t h e impac t o f the 1998 Green Cover Po l icy No tes prepared fo r the new 
Adm in is t ra t ion o f President Cubas was limited, as Cubas resigned six months after the 
report was issued . 

3 . 

Bank lend ing resumed in 1992 with the approval o f tw o operations. A new 
Coun t ry Assistance Strategy (CAS) fo l lowed in 1993 , p ropos ing a US $ 2 7 0 m i l l i o n 
p rog ram fo r F Y 9 4 - 9 7 , focusing m a i n l y o n p r iva te sector development, agricultural 
development and pove r ty a l lev ia t iodhuman resources development. A to ta l o f nine loans 
focusing on basic needs were approved between 1992 and 1997 , the m a j o r i t y o f w h i c h 
experienced imp lemen ta t ion d i f f i c u l t i e s m a i n l y due t o weak pub l ic sector capacity, lack 
o f fam i l ia r i ty with Bank procedures and the ins t i tu t iona l comp lex i ty o f the projects. 

4 . 

A transitional CAS was prepared in 1997 , focusing m a i n l y o n short-term 
objectives that were attainable within the country’s p o l i c y and ins t i tu t iona l constraints. 
The 1997 C A S recommended a cautious base-case scenario strategy, with a m a x im um o f 
one or tw o loans per year, m a i n l y fo r poverty-oriented projects with an emphasis o n 
p i lo t ing . The 1997 CAS, however, become rap id ly inoperative as the Bank decided in 
1998 to ha l t preparation o f new projects due to the Government’s non-compliance with 
Yacycreta social obligations and poo r p o r t f o l i o performance. The Bank’s Resident 
M i s s i o n in Asuncion, w h i c h was established in 1998 , was downsized t o a L ia ison O f f ice 
in 2000. In F Y 0 2 / 0 3 , the p rog ram was reactivated with the approval o f tw o operations 
(Commun i ty Deve lopmen t Project and Educa t ion R e f o rm Project). 

55 

CAS Annex 2 
Page 2 of 5 

5 . 

The Operations Eva lua t ion Department (OED) prepared a Coun t ry Assistance 
Eva lua t ion (CAE ) in 2001, w h i c h viewed the ove ra l l outcome o f Bank assistance to 
Paraguay in the past decade unsatisfactory, due to i t s modest relevance and neg l ig ib le 
efficacy. In reality, the projects approved and implemented during this period, m a i n l y 
focusing o n basic needs, were appropriate fo r the country’s realities and relevant t o i t s 
development agenda. Un fo r tuna te ly , the imp lemen ta t ion reco rd was spotty, thereby 
l im i t i n g the e f f icacy and impac t o f the operations. The serious imp lemen ta t ion problems 
that Bank funded operations have faced since 1992 are la rge ly attributable t o unde r ly ing 
governance problems, poo r ins t i tu t iona l capacity and insu f f ic ien t social and p o l i t i c a l 
ownership fo r the administrative and economic reforms the B a n k supported. B o t h the 
efficacy and e f f ic iency o f the Bank ’s assistance are rated as l o w in the O E D report. 

6. 

The report also po in ts ou t that imp lemen ta t ion has been s low across the boa rd and 
that, because o f the l o n g in te rva ls in w h i c h the re was n o new lending t o the country, 
Paraguay has started t o exhibit many o f the characteristics o f new borrowers, including, 
inter alia, the lack o f qua l i f ied professionals who are fam i l ia r with B a n k po l ic ies and 
procedures. Further, in view o f the Bank’s past d i f f icu l t ies in ach iev ing ownership and 
ins t i tu t iona l development objectives, lack o f progress in key structural re fo rms and the 
limited impac t o f ESW, the OED report rates the ins t i tu t iona l development impac t o f 
Bank assistance as negligible and sustainability as unlikely. The repo r t nevertheless 
admits the pos i t ive experiences in education and ru ra l water supply, where projects built 
successfully o n Paraguay’s strong t rad i t ion o f commun i ty pa r t ic ipa t ion . 

Lessons Learned 

7 . While the Bank’s dec is ion n o t to invest heav i ly in Paraguay limited i t s exposure, 
i t also reduced i t s influence. As a resu l t , ove ra l l Bank effectiveness in Paraguay was 
constrained n o t o n l y by the adverse p o l i c y environment and systemic problems, but also 
by the Bank’s limited ro le as a donor and by tw o l o n g periods o f hiatus in lending. 

8 . 

Further, experience f r om the past indicates that B a n k lending h a d limited impac t 
in the absence o f a minimum p rog ram o f re fo rms b y the authorities t o get o n the pa th o f 
sustained g r ow t h and pove r ty reduction. In addition, p rog ram reversals are t o be expected 
when the re i s l o w p o l i t i c a l comm i tmen t t o reforms. This was the case with the fa i lu re o f 
the p r iva t iza t ion p rog ram in 2002, w h i c h was n o t a pa r t o f the 1997 C A S strategy, but 
evo lved f r om the res t ruc tu r ing o f the Asunc ion Water and Sanitation Project. The 
restructured p ro jec t intended t o support the p r iva t iza t ion o f the water and 
telecommunication companies, f o l l ow i n g the enactment o f p r iva t iza t ion legislation. 
U l t ima te ly , l o w p o l i t i c a l comm i tmen t t o the p r iva t iza t ion process was the m a i n cause fo r 
p rog ram reversal. 

9 . 

A c t i v e f o l l ow - u p by the coun t ry o f f i c e i s o f ten c r i t ica l f o r p ro jec t imp lemen ta t ion 
in countries fac ing the same imp lemen ta t ion d i f f icu l t ies as Paraguay. Since i t s 
establishment, the l o c a l o f f i c e has been substantially i n v o l v e d in p o r t f o l i o management in 
order to imp rove p o r t f o l i o performance. Responsible p o r t f o l i o management, inc lud ing 
semi-annual p o r t f o l i o reviews (CPPRs) and the restructuring o f t w o projects during the 

56 

CAS Annex 2

1998-200 1 period, coupled with active supervision, imp roved p o r t f o l i o performance f r om 
“one o f the t e n worst” in 2000, to acceptable during the past t h r e e years ( l e s s than 25 
pe rcen t o f active projects rated as p rob lem projects), in l i n e with the 1997 CAS 
performance trigger. 

10. 
In retrospect, the decision to ma in ta in a minimum presence in the country despite 
the absence o f new lend ing p roved to be the r igh t one.2 Minimum f i e l d presence was in 
fact essential f o r ma in ta in ing a dialogue with the previous Government and the new 
administration, b u i l d i n g contacts with c i v i l society and the p r iva te sector, as well as fo r 
p rov id ing a basis f o r reactivating the program under the p resen t CAS . 

1 1. 

The engagement by the W o r l d Bank Institute (WBI), w h i c h inter a l ia led t o the 
establishment o f the Anti Co r rup t ion Commission, has generated impo r tan t benefits, 
inc lud ing the recent passage o f a new procurement l aw and a constructive dialogue with 
c i v i l society. 

12. 
F ina l ly , the lack o f a common donor pos i t ion o n key re fo rms and governance 
i s s u e s has limited the impac t and e f fec t iveness o f past Bank assistance. Dono r 
coordination efforts need t o be substantially increased in the future i f external resources 
are to be e f fec t ive ly u t i l i z e d by Government (see Annex 4). 

Current Portfolio and Implementation Issues 

13. 
Paraguay has a sma l l ongoing po r t fo l io , comp r is ing s ix active projects fo r a to ta l 
value o f US$176 m i l l i o n , o f w h i c h U S $ 8 5 m i l l i o n were undisbursed as o f 30 September 
2003. O f the s ix active projects, four are rated as satisfactory, one i s rated unsatisfactory 
on implementation progress (Asuncion Sewerage Project), and one has yet t o become 
e f f e c t i v e (Education R e f o rm Project). A l though several imp lemen ta t ion bottlenecks 
remain to be addressed, as described in detail below, the general hea l th o f the po r t fo l io 
has imp roved with respect t o previous fiscal years. The general good standing o f the 
current p o r t f o l i o therefore provides com fo r t t o move ahead with n ew lend ing under the 
upcoming C A S period. 

14. 
The p o r t f o l i o r e v i ew carried out o n October 2, 2003 identified a number o f 
systemic i s s u e s a f fec t ing the po r t fo l io , and singled out measures t o address these 
problems and imp rove ove ra l l po r t fo l io performance. The m a i n generic i s s u e s a f fec t ing

qualifications, and they tend t o be replaced whenever a new Minister i s appointed 
(this was pa r t icu la r ly problematic du r ing the past Presidential period, e.g. seven 
M i n i s t e r s o f Ag r icu l tu re were appointed in f i v e years). The h i g h turnover o f 
p ro jec t s ta f f considerably slows d ow n the pace o f implementation and inhibits 
capacity b u i l d i n g in project management and administration; 

Lack of Timely and Adequate Availability of Counterpart Funds. This has been 

the source o f considerable delays in p ro jec t implementation in the past, due to 
increasing f isca l constraints. 

Cumbersome Procedures for the F low of Funds to the Projects. The m a i n i s s u e 

i s that the Special Accounts are hosted in the Banco Central de Paraguay (BCP) 
and i t takes the P IUs about 20 t o 30 days to access the funds. This negatively 
impac t the projects’ ab i l i ty t o disburse and implement qu ick ly . 

Delays in Effectiveness and Project S ta r t -up . The delays s tem la rge ly f r om the 

current legislative practices, requ i r ing a l l projects t o be approved o n an ind iv idua l 
basis by Congress before they can become effective. B o t h IDB and the B a n k have 
flagged this as a ma jo r hindrance t o p ro jec t execution. 

L im i ted Disbursement Capacity and Limited Knowledge of Bank Procedures. 

The general weakness in p ro jec t administration i s pa r t icu la r ly noticeable in the 
disbursement area. Close supervision o f procurement has also been necessary. 

15. 

T o address these constraints, the Bank has agreed with the new Adm in is t ra t ion o n 
a se r ies o f measures that w i l l imp rove the administrative climate f o r future Bank 
operations in the country. T o address the i s s u e o f h i g h s ta f f turnover at the PIUs, the 
Government proposes that the new Central Unit fo r Pub l ic Investments (Unidad Central 
de Inversidn Pziblica), m a i n l y charged with a id management and donor coordination 
functions, i s s u e norms o n the selection, appointment and performance o f s ta f f f o r 
externally financed projects. This w o u l d ensure that p ro jec t s ta f f w i l l be hired o n the 
basis o f competitive processes and i t s performance assessed o n a yearly basis. 
Concerning counterpart, the Government has comm i t ted t o p rov ide 100 pe rcen t o f 
counterpart fund ing fo r externally financed projects starting in 2004. T o address the i s s u e 
posed by t h e cumbersome procedures f o r the f l o w o f funds t o the projects, Government i s 
preparing a revised manual o f Treasury procedures and the Bank w i l l be g iven the 
opportunity t o comment o n the draft manual, comp le t ion o f w h i c h i s expected in the 
medium-term. 

16. 

The Government also recognized the d i f f i c u l t i e s posed by the current legislative 
requirements o n the t ime l iness o f p ro jec t effectiveness and start-up, and i s iden t i fy ing 
options to resolve the issue , inc lud ing i n f o rm i n g early and more extensively members o f

In September and October o f 2003, the Bank held t h r e e consultative meetings

candid discussion about the ro le o f the Bank, the qua l i ty o f i t s assistance. In add i t ion the 
Bank sought t o receive p rac t ica l suggestions that can help i t t o imp rove i t s effectiveness. 

3 . 

The f i r s t mee t ing was held in the capital, Asuncion, and the tw o others in the 
interior, in the cities o f V i l l a r i c a and B e l l a V is ta Su r . A diverse va r ie ty o f organizations 
participated in the discussions, inc lud ing fa i th groups, trade unions, farmer cooperatives, 
small and medium en te rp r ises federations, academic community, women organizations 
and you th alliances, l o c a l and international NGOs, the press , and groups representing 
indigenous people, the unemployed, students, teachers and other professionals. Loca l 
and regional (departmental) government o f f ic ia ls were also p resen t . 

4. 

Desp i te the number o f organizations and variety o f in te res ts represented, a 
number o f common themes emerged. First, the re was remarkable convergence around 
the p ropos i t ion that the Bank’s assistance cou ld have greater impac t o n pove r ty with 
increased pa r t ic ipa t ion o f c i v i l society. Second, in t e rm s o f where the Bank should focus 
i t s support, CSOs in each o f the consultations identified governance as the m a i n target, 
with issues o f agriculture and land t i t les , access to a good qua l i ty o f hea l th and education, 
access to adequate infrastructure in ru ra l and urban areas, access t o mechanisms o f credit 
fo r the poorest, especial environmental compensations and social m o n i t o r o f the pub l ic 
expenditures as the key areas where an imp roved and mo re open public sector cou ld most 
e f fec t ive ly support the development process.

In add i t ion t o specific i s s u e s about imp rov ing and m a k i n g mo re p roduc t ive the 
partnership between the B a n k and c i v i l society in Paraguay, the re was a great deal o f 
valuable discussion about t h r e e key p o l i c y areas t o be pursued in coo rd ina t ion by 
Government, c i v i l society and the international commun i ty : (i) governance; (ii) economic 
growth, and (iii) social inc lus ion . 

60 

CAS Annex 3

6. 

There was broad recogn i t ion that these p o l i c y goals can n o t be pursued in 
isolation, and that latter t w o o f these p r io r i t ies - economic g r ow t h and social inc lus ion - 
a re impossible w i thou t clear and determined efforts o n the f i r s t , good governance. H e r e 
also there was a great deal o f discussion about reducing co r rup t ion and even the basic 
ethic and c i v i c values o n w h i c h pub l ic p o l i c y r e s t s . 

7 . 

Co r rup t ion was identified as one o f the mos t challenging problems o f the country. 
I t i s perceived as a ma jo r hindrance to achieve sustainable development, and as l im i t i n g 
the full effectiveness o f projects financed by the W o r l d Bank. In particular, inadequate 
transparency in bidding documents and deep p o l i t i c a l c l ien te l ism were recurrent themes. 
Wider and mo re consistent pub l ica t ion o f b idd ing documents was one common suggested 
response. F i x i n g the ove r lapp ing administrative ju r isd ic t ions and d i f f u s i o n o f 
responsibilities w h i c h many f e l t characterize ins t i tu t iona l system was another. He re , 
many suggested administrative decentralization and increased autonomy to loca l 
Governments in the design o f their development strategies as a p rac t ica l p o l i c y step. This 
i s fully consistent with a broader feeling by participants that mo re decentralization t o the 
loca l l e v e l - and t o commun i ty groups and NGO s w o u l d contribute t o be t te r and mo re 
e f f ic ien t po l icymak ing , i n c l u d i n g W o r l d Bank supported projects. F ina l ly , i t was 
emphasized that the e f f ic ien t decentralization o f ju r isd ic t ions should be pe r fo rmed 
together with the corresponding decentralization o f resources. 

8 . 

The fo rma t ion o f ethic and c i v i c values that encourage the exercise o f a 
comm i t ted and responsible citizenship and foster industriousness as the irreplaceable 
source o f economic g r ow t h are perceived as indispensable requisites fo r the sustainable 
development o f Paraguay. Educa t ion w o u l d p l a y a substantive r o l e in this, by inc lud ing 
the f am i l y in fo rma l education and in the development o f a cu r r icu la that w o u l d help 
prepare students t o meet the particular needs o f their communities. This, i t was thought, 
w o u l d p romo te a greater sense o f be long ing t o the who le o f society, and o f shared 
responsibilities o n the development o f the country. 

9 . 

Rega rd ing economic growth, substantial attention was p laced o n supporting 
agriculture, i n c l u d i n g th rough direct assistance to sma l l farmers and l a n d t i t l e s . Specific 
ideas inc luded increasing access to c red i t and crop insurance, im p r o v i n g technical 
capacity and in fo rma t ion , and re fo rm ing the system o f land and p rope r ty t i t les , especially 
with the indigenous people. 

10. 

There was also m u c h discussion about strengthening ag r icu l tu ra l infrastructure. 
One example i s the need t o imp rove communications between different regions o f the 
country, as i n f o rm a l contact among sma l l producers throughout the coun t ry i s d i f f i c u l t 
due t o the precarious infrastructure o f the ex is t ing r u r a l roads. A second i s the lack o f 
coo rd ina t ion o f ag r icu l tu ra l p roduc t ion that w o u l d a l l ow fo r producers t o benefit f r om 
comparative advantages. I t i s estimated that the imp lemen ta t ion o f po l ic ies fo r fostering 
geographical in teg ra t ion among sma l l producers w o u l d increase the volumes produced 
based o n c rop complementary planning, reduce p roduc t ion costs, socialize technical 
expertise, and design j o i n t strategies t o access markets.

The consultations were pa r t icu la r ly u s e f u l in p rov id ing space t o address h o w 
vulnerable segments o f the population, such as indigenous people, women, ch i ld ren and 
you th more generally, are affected by the lack o f jobs and economic opportunities. 

12. 

Poor, or v i r tua l ly nonexistent, access to basic social services such as health care 
and education was a consistent theme. In health, the situation was essentially 
characterized as “inequitable, exclusionary and discriminatory”. And while the 
educational system i s perceived to be in be t te r condition, i t was f e l t that coverage and 
quality i s s t i l l far f r om satisfactory. I t was also raised the lack o f b i l i n g u a l education in a 
Country where the poorest are m a i n l y guarani speakers. 

13. 

Paraguay i s rece iv ing a l o t o f money f r om the international organizations (donors 
and mu l t i la te ra l f inanc ia l institutions) but the CSOs has no t con t ro l over it, p roduc ing a 
lack o f balance o f powe r among the c i v i l society depending o f the their relationships with 
governmental leaders. 

14. 

The CSOs during the consultations recognized their co-responsibility in the 
country m a i n problems, e.g., the passive attitude o f the CSOs fac ing co r rup t ion and lack 
o f participation. The CSOs s e l f assessment concluded that they need t o imp rove the 
quality o f social inc lus ion by reve r t ing the inadequate in fo rma t ion about the programs, 
the lack o f pa r t ic ipa t ion in decision making, the unsuitable focalisation o f social 
programs and the cu l tu ra l obstacles fo r accessing pub l ic services. 

The R o l e o f the Bank 

15 . 

With respect t o i d e n t i f y i n g an increased ro le fo r c i v i l society in he lp ing the Bank 
in i t s support to Paraguay, participants focused on: i) design and imp lemen ta t ion o f 
projects, ii) supervision o f projects, and iii) capacity b u i l d i n g among CSOs. 

16. 

First, the design o f investment projects w o u l d require a mo re in-depth evaluation 
o f i t s po ten t ia l social and environmental impact, and a more accurate know ledge o f 
Paraguayan p o l i t i c a l culture and reg iona l particularities. The N a t u r a l Resources 
Management Project (PARN ) and the P i l o t Commun i ty Development Project 
(PRODECO) projects were c i ted as examples o f designs w h i c h su f fe red f r om inadequate 
understanding of, and sens i t iv i ty to, loca l concerns. 

17. 

Second, many participants expressed concern about the capab i l i ty o f the 
supervision mechanisms employed by the Bank to prevent irregularities in the 
management o f the disbursed funds. The lack o f pe r iod ic i ty , scarce know ledge o f loca l 
usage, and insu f f ic ien t depth o f supervision missions r e s u l t in unrealistic evaluations. 
M a n y participants o f fe red that increased pa r t ic ipa t ion o f loca l CSOs, inc lud ing through 
the establishment o f f o rm a l mon i to r ing committees, cou ld imp rove the qua l i ty and 
transparency o f the supervision process. 

18. 

M a n y believed that the Bank cou ld do more to welcome the contributions o f the 
skilled and comm i t ted Paraguayan c i v i l society. Experience has amp ly demonstrated that 

62 

CAS Annex 3 
Page 4 of 6 

the pa r t ic ipa t ion o f c i v i l society in the design, imp lemen ta t ion and mon i to r ing o f the 
projects increases e f f ic iency , while saving resources in administrative expenses. In this 
context, participants reques ted : (i) better access to in fo rma t ion ; (ii) mo re t ra in ing 
opportunities; and (iii) direct management o f disbursed funds. 

19. 

Third, CSOs representatives asked that the Bank p rov ide more, and mo re timely, 
in fo rma t ion to enable their adequate pa r t ic ipa t ion in Bank projects f r om incep t ion 
through imp lemen ta t ion , Towa rd this end, participants reminded s ta f f that i t i s necessary 
to diversify the dissemination channels as computers and other technological equipment 
are no t o f common ly available in Paraguay. 

20. 
Related t o the above, participants also s tressed that the need f o r t ra in ing and other 
forms o f capacity b u i l d i n g to ensure their most e f fec t ive pa r t ic ipa t ion in WB projects. 
A l though this was a common request, i t came mo re frequently f r om organizations f r om 
within the in te r io r o f the country and ru ra l areas, where the re i s a lack o f technical 
knowledge w h i c h compromises the ab i l i ty to compete o n pub l ic biddings, access 
government programs and/or take part o n in i t ia t ives undertaken by the W o r l d Bank. 

2 1. Mo reove r , m a n y CSOs’ representatives ind ica ted that rea l pa r t ic ipa t ion requ i res 
adequate financing. In their perception, the lack o f f inanc ing sources i s the bigger 
obstacle that c i v i l society faces fo r achieving a true impac t o n p u b l i c po l ic ies and in the 
development process o f the country. In this context, and in light o f the g row ing attention 
p a i d to increasing sc ru t iny in the use o f pub l ic funds, they have reques ted the Bank to 
consider a p ro jec t design that w o u l d a l l ow direct disbursement o f resources t o c i v i l 
society. 

22. 
There was a we lcome recogn i t ion by c i v i l society rep resen ted in the consultations 
that the Government’s stated comm i tmen t t o the fight against co r rup t ion and fo r widely 
shared economic g r ow t h provides po ten t ia l opportunities f o r a mo re active pa r t ic ipa t ion 
o f c i v i l society in the change process. Neve r the less , the re was v e r y c lea r ly a wait-and- 
see attitude among m a n y t o de te rm ine whether these comm i tmen ts w i l l materialize in to 
real improvements in access t o and influence o n decision-makers. 

W o r l d Bank’s c o m m e n t s o n t h e v i e w s o f c i v i l soc ie ty 

23. 
The qua l i ty o f the interventions and the comm i tmen t o f the participants in the 
consultations have made clear that c i v i l society in Paraguay can make a ma jo r 
con t r ibu t ion t o the development process in their country. 

24. 
The B a n k i s already w o r k i n g in cooperation with i t s CSOs partners t o strengthen 
coordination and i n f o rm a t i o n sharing between the Bank, the Government and c i v i l 
society, and i s cons ide r ing approaches t o support capacity building in the N G O s and 
other groups w h i c h c o u l d participate in the preparation and imp lemen ta t ion o f Bank - 
supported projects. M o r e fo rma l ly , the Bank i s w o r k i n g t ow a r d the creation o f a 
coordinated “M o n i t o r i n g Committee” made up o f Bank staff, international, organisations 

63

(UNDP, GTZ) CSOs and loca l Government to p rov ide additional supervision and control 
o f projects. 

25. 

Indeed, as u s e f u l as the consultations were in generating new ideas and proposals 
fo r cooperation, they were equally important in demonstrating the extent to w h i c h even 
sophisticated representatives o f c i v i l society are unaware o f h o w the Bank provides 
support, pa r t icu la r ly with respec t . In this regard, in th ink ing together about new 
approaches to intensify communication between the Bank and c i v i l society, i t was helpful 
to identify areas where collaborative w o r k i s already underway, and this cou ld be built 
on. 

26. 

Fo r example, loca l communities are already wo rk ing with the Bank towards 
execution o f a number o f Bank supported projects. A Ru ra l Water Supply and Sanitation 
Project i s administered by loca l “Sanitation Boards”; PARN , w h i c h wo rks d i rec t ly with 
associations o f farmers in the p lann ing o f m ic ro river basins and with sma l l l ow - 
resources groups o f r u r a l producers; and PRODECO, w h i c h i s j o i n t l y administered c i v i l 
society organizations and the loca l Government. 

27. 

Even in p ro jec t design, there are interesting examples about w h i c h many 
participants were unaware. Fo r instance, a dynamic consultation i n v o l v i n g teachers 
unions, parents and other c ruc ia l stakeholders contributed substantially t o the 
development o f the last Secondary Education R e f o rm project. 

Actions proposed by the Bank to strengthen its relationship with CSOs 

28. 

With the goal o f con t r ibu t ing t o the consolidation o f a mature c i v i l society, able t o 
actively participate in the activities o f the Bank and t o p rov ide suggestions f o r the 
sustainable development o f the country, the Bank recognizes the need to : (i) increase the 
in i t ia t ives o f in fo rma t ion transmission t o c i v i l society; (ii) develop t ra in ing programs fo r 
CSOs; and (iii) deepen the dialogue between CSOs and the Bank. 

2 9 . 

To secure these objectives, the Bank intends t o

Annex 4. Aid Coordination 

1. 

Paraguay i s one o f the few Bank clients that has n o consultative group or fo rma l 
a id coordination mechanism. The Government has never reques ted any particular donor 
to take the leadership in a id coordination, and no donor has taken up this challenge, 
although the loca l donor representatives do mee t o n an ad hoc basis o n topics such as 
health and decentralization. The Government has m a i n l y engaged with donors o n a one- 
on-one basis. In addition, the a id coordination and management func t ion within 
Government has been split between the Ministry o f Finance and the Secretariat o f 
Planning in the Presidency and lacked a close coordination between the two . As a resu l t , 
aid coordination has been very weak in the past. 

2. 

In designing i t s projects, the Bank has coordinated with the IDB, by far the largest 
donor, and several B a n k operations have been complementary t o IDB-funded projects. 
For example, Bank projects have financed secondary education, while IDB projects have 
financed p r ima ry education; in maternal and c h i l d health, the B a n k has been active in six 
departments and the IDB in others. In addition, the re has been good collaboration 
between the Bank and the IDB in the preparation o f tw o j o i n t f iduc ia ry assessments, the 
Country Procurement Assessmen t Report and the Coun t ry F inanc ia l Accoun tab i l i ty 
Assessmen t . Coo rd ina t ion between the two institutions o n macro-conditionalities has 
been limited, however. Coo rd ina t ion between the Bank and the U N D P has been good, 
with the U N D P administering the f inanc ia l management aspects o f several Bank-funded 
loans and grants. The relationship has been fac i l i ta ted by the loca t ion o f the Paraguay 
country o f f ice in the UN House. 

3 . 

A l though Paraguay lacked up t o n ow an agreement with the IMF, collaboration 
between the Bank and the Fund has been close and constructive, and has taken place in 
the f o rm o f frequent dialogue and consultations b o t h at headquarters and in the field. 
Such close co l labo ra t ion has been pa r t icu la r ly evident in the ongo ing preparation o f the 
F inanc ia l Sector Adjustment L o a n as well as in the preparation o f the Economic 
Recovery Structural Adjustment Loan. 

4. 

The limited impac t o f past donor assistance i s pa r t ia l ly attributable t o the lack o f 
efforts o n the part o f b o t h Government and donors t o be t te r harmonize and coordinate 
their programs and t o reach common positions o n structural and sectoral reforms. I t i s 
therefore impe ra t ive that donor coordination be imp roved in the future i f the country i s t o 
u t i l ize donor f inanc ing mo re e f fec t ive ly and to attract higher l e v e l s o f external support. 
This w i l l be pa r t icu la r ly important i f the Government wishes t o mob i l ize additional 
external support t o fund new pove r ty reduction interventions as pa r t o f the recently 
prepared Poverty Reduc t ion Strategy Paper (PRSP), once i t i s fo rma l ly adopted b y the 
Government. 

5 . 

Op t ima l ly , the Government should take a leadership pos i t ion in the coordination 
and management o f fo re ign aid. The new administration has recognized the importance 
o f increasing donor coo rd ina t ion efforts and has taken a number o f administrative 
measures, inc lud ing the creation within the Ministry o f Finance o f a unit dedicated t o the 

66 

CAS Annex 4 
Page 2 of 3 

management o f external assistance (the Central Unit fo r Pub l ic Investment) and the 
decision t o incorporate the P lann ing Secretariat in the Ministry o f Finance ( fo r wh ich 
leg is la t ion has been s e n t t o Congress). 

6. 

The attached Partnership M a t r i x provides an ind ica t ion o f the d is t r ibu t ion o f 
external assistance and in te res ts by donor.
