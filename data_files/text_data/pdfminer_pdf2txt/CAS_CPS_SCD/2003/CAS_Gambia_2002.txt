EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

i. 
Background. The Gambia has a population of 1.3 million people and is the
smallest country in Africa with 11,295 square kilometers. It has succeeded in reversing the
economic deterioration which began after it fell into a severe crisis in the 1980s, followed
by a coup d'etat in 1994. Since 1997, the country has shown consistent growth, but as yet,
this has not translated into reduced poverty. It ranks 160th out of 173 countries in the U.N.
Human Development Index and because of its size, remains very vulnerable to external
shocks. As such, The Gambia continues to face serious challenges for its future growth
and poverty reduction.
ii. 
The Gambia completed its PRSP in July 2002. The country is close to being on
track to meet the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs'), though it will need a
concentrated effort in health and education to remain so. It reached its HIPC Decision
Point in December 2000 and has benefited from interim debt relief under the enhanced
HIPC Initiative's export window. The Gambia also has the potential to reach its HIPC
Completion Point in the second half of 2003.
iii. 
The following issues are suggested for Board discussion:
a. Poverty reduction: Does the Bank program adequately support the PRSP?
b. Strategic direction: Given the context in The Gambia, is the focus of the CAS
correct?
c. Risks: Does the CAS identify sufficient mitigating measures to address the
risks acknowledged?
iv. 
Recent Performance. Macroeconomic performance under the last Country
Assistance Strategy (CAS) was quite good with large increases in the average annual
growth rates of GDP, exports and imports. There were also decreases in the average
annual growth rates of inflation, the fiscal deficit, and the external deficit. However, in the
past six months, macroeconomic indicators have worsened, showing that The Gambia is
still too vulnerable to poor rains. The fiscal deficit and inflation rose and the growth
estimates for 2002 fell slightly to 4.7 percent. Social outcomes during the same period
were mixed with encouraging reductions in infant and child mortality and improved
literacy, but the maternal mortality rate remained very high and there were limited
improvements in school enrollment at basic levels. During this time, the performance of
the Bank's portfolio faltered, though there has been recent encouraging improvement.
v. 
The Gambia's PRSP. The PRSP analysis concludes that urban poverty is on the
rise, but poverty has increased most in rural areas, with 61percent of the rural population
falling below the overall poverty line in 1998 as opposed to 41percent in 1992. In
response to this daunting poverty profile, the Gambians have completed a PRSP based on
five pillars: (1) Create an enabling policy environment to promote economic growth and
poverty reduction; (2) Enhance the productive capacity and social protection of the poor
and vulnerable; (3) Improve coverage of the basic social service needs of the poor and
vulnerable; (4) Build the capacity of local communities and civil society organizations to
play an active role in the development process; and (5) Mainstream gender equity,
environmental issues, nutrition, governance and HIV/AIDS awareness into all
development programs.

- iv -

vi. 
CAS Objectives. While the CAS was prepared within the framework of the PRSP,
its strategic vision was further focused as the result of an ongoing DPR, a recent portfolio
review, consultations with the Government, civil society and other partners. As a result,
the CAS focuses on the first, third and fourth pillars of the PRSP, with specific objectives
under these pillars to: improve public expenditure management; enhance the equity and
quality of service delivery; and, promote private sector-led growth.
vii. 
Analytical Work. The analytical work planned in the CAS focuses in particular
on improving public expenditure management. In addition to the DPR, the Country
Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA), Country Procurement Assessment Report
(CPAR) and Public Expenditure Review (PER) will all look more closely at specific
aspects of public expenditure management and together will develop a detailed agenda for
its improvement. The Civil Service Reform Study will examine how to move forward on
decentralization in a way that will improve staffing, and hence services, in rural facilities.
The Private Sector Assessment will explore the prospects for private sector-led growth in
key sectors. Finally, the Poverty Assessment will provide an update to the poverty profile
and allow progress on the PRSP to be monitored.
viii. Lending Program and Debt Sustainability. Under the base case (US$25
million), the Bank plans financing for health, education and rural development, which
corresponds to the priority sectors established in the PRSP. It also corresponds to the CAS
objectives of improving service delivery and promoting private sector-led growth. The
Gambia's IDA Grant allocation of $2.5 million will be used to finance one component of
the next education operation. If the Government shows its commitment to reform and
policy performance improves, the Bank would move to the high case lending scenario
(US$37 million) that support investments in energy and water as well as providing
program support. The low case (US$10 million) would finance only the planned project in
education since the Bank considers this to be an essential and well-performing sector. The
current Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) shows that compared to the HIPC Decision
Point, debt projections have deteriorated due to forecasted declines in the growth rate of
exports in the near term, but the projected debt to export ratios are still within an
acceptable range.
ix. 
Triggers for Base and High Cases. The Gambia is currently in the base case, and
the triggers for remaining there focus on good portfolio and macroeconomic management
as well as filling in some of the gaps in the PRSP, taking the initial steps towards better
expenditure management and pursuing the reform agenda. The triggers for moving to the
high case scenario envisage a strong improvement in policy performance, particularly in
the areas of public expenditure management and infrastructure reforms.
x. 
Risks and Mitigation. The principal risk for the implementation of the CAS is the
Government's willingness to pursue reform in a sustainable and consistent manner. This is
mitigated by making progress on reforms a trigger for moving to the high case. Another
risk stems from the Government's ability to maintain a stable macroeconomic environment
and focus expenditures on the priority sectors. The Bank and others are providing
assistance to improve expenditure management. Finally, there are risks associated with
capacity and governance. The Bank is supporting capacity building and judicial reform
and will continue to highlight the importance of good governance for attracting private
investment.

MEMORANDUM OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
COUNTRY ASSISTANCE STRATEGY OF THE WORLD BANK GROUP
FOR THE REPUBLIC OF THE GAMBIA

I. INTRODUCTION

1. 
The Gambia completed its Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) in May
2002 and the Boards of the World Bank and the IMF discussed it in July 2002. The
PRSP and its comprehensive poverty analysis provide the framework for this Country
Assistance Strategy (CAS).1 The CAS has also been informed by an ongoing
Development Policy Review (DPR), a recent Country Portfolio Performance Review
(CPPR) and extensive consultations on the World Bank's role in The Gambia.

Background

2. 
The Gambia is the smallest country on the African continent with 11,295 square
kilometers and ranks 160th out of 173 countries in the United Nations Human
Development Index. The country consists of the two banks of the Gambia River, densely
populated by about 1.3 million people. 2

3. 
Presidential elections were held in October 2001, and saw the reelection of the
incumbent, Yahya Jammeh, for a second term. President Jammeh has been in power
since taking over in a coup d'6tat in 1994. These presidential elections, which were
largely endorsed by the international community, were followed by National Assembly
elections in January 2002. The legislative elections, like the subsequent local elections in
April 2002, were boycotted by the main opposition United Democratic Party (UDP). As
a result, the ruling Alliance for Patriotic Reorientation and Construction (APRC) ran
largely unopposed and won all but three seats in the National Assembly. The results of
these elections at different levels are that President Jammeh enjoys a new mandate with
little opposition, which could enable him to undertake significant reforms, but also mean
that there is a very weak system of checks and balances on the executive. President
Jammeh has taken advantage of this mandate by keeping a tight grip on the state and
public administration, and he has recently absorbed under the Presidency both the
Departments of State for Energy and for Agriculture.

4. 
The macroeconomic situation in The Gambia is characterized by positive but
variable results:

* Real per capita incomes declined slightly during the 1990s with a real
GDP that grew by an average of 3.3 percent per year and population
growth of 3.5 percent per year.

'The Gambia Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper and JSA, Report No. 24366.
2 The last census in The Gambia was in 1993. This figure is a UN estimate as of mid-2001.

- 2 -

* 

* However, real GDP growth jumped to an average of 5.3 percent per
year from 1998 to 2001, exceeding population growth which remained
high at approximately 3 percent per year. The PRSP projects
continued growth at 6 percent per year through 2005, increasing
thereafter.
Inflation has remained moderate during this period of growth (4 to 8
percent per year); however, the Government has run up its stock of
domestic debt. Interest rates on T-Bills have climbed steadily in recent
years and this has increased the amount of government resources going
to service this debt and has crowded the private sector out of the
financial markets.
* Fiscal control slipped in 2002 with expenditures much higher than
programmed. This led to the IMF being unable to conclude its Poverty
Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) review in October 2002.

5. 
Social outcomes have been encouraging in certain areas, especially in reducing
infant and child mortality. Indicators for maternal mortality are still quite high and child
malnutrition rates are lagging behind as well. As presented in Table 8, The Gambia is in
a position to meet the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) in health, but only with a
very concentrated effort from this point forward. In education, literacy is improving and
gender disparity declining; however, gross enrollment rates for both males and females at
lower basic level have improved little over the last five years. Moreover, at higher levels
of education, there is still a significant gap between the participation of males and
females. Like those in the health sector, policy makers in education must really focus if
they are to meet the MDGs, but this is within reach.

6. 
The Gambia reached its HIPC Decision Point in December 2000 and has
benefited from interim debt relief under the enhanced HIPC Initiative's export window.
At the end of 2001, the Government had made good progress toward fulfilling many of
its HIPC conditions. The country could reach HIPC completion point before the end of
2003, if it maintains satisfactory macroeconomic performance and continues to show
adequate performance in health and education.

II. MACROECONOMIC ANALYSIS AND SOURCES OF GROWTH

Results of the Development Policy Review

7. 
Given the framework developed in the PRSP, the World Bank is conducting a
Development Policy Review (DPR) to identify past strengths and weaknesses in policy
implementation which might hinder successful implementation of the PRSP. The
objective of taking this longer term perspective was to look at trends which might pose
risks for meeting the six percent growth rate sought in the PRSP. The DPR identifies the
following challenges:

(i) 
Improving development outcomes in The Gambia will require
addressing a "stop go" commitment to reform. External shocks such as

- 3 -

regional instability, drought and deteriorating terms of trade only make it more
. pressing that domestic policy be consistent and effective. The scorecard in this
respect shows that periods of successful adjustment have been mixed with poor
macroeconomic policies and heavy-handed intervention by the Government.
Incomplete structural reforms have failed to create an attractive investment
climate or to develop cost-effective infrastructure services.

(ii) Growth and poverty reduction require stability and good governance.
Events such as the 1994 military coup, the seizure of groundnut assets, the
noncompetitive award of contracts, and the unexplained discharge of key public
officials in 2000 and 2001, all had a negative impact on the country's image. The
awareness of the importance of good governance for growth promotion led to
identification of governance as one of the priorities in the PRSP adopted in May
2002. Authorities must embrace this aspect of the PRSP convincingly if they
wish to attract investors.

(iii) The expansion of domestic debt is threatening macroeconomic stability.
The issuance of T-Bills has been a major source of financing for the fiscal deficits
and of absorption of excess liquidity in the banking system. As a result, the share
of interest payments on domestic debt in recurrent expenditures averaged about
20 percent in the period 1997-2001. Coincidentally, in the latter period,
expenditures in the education and health sectors fell by about the same proportion
of GDP that domestic interest payment increased. In addition, capital
expenditures were crowded out. In order to contain the growth of its domestic
debt, The Gambia must reduce its fiscal deficits and find more concessional
financing for deficits that cannot be eliminated.

(iv) Limited resources for the social sectors are further hampered by
inadequate effectiveness and efficiency in their spending. In 2002, Public
Expenditure Reviews (PERs) in education, health and agriculture highlighted
problems with tracking expenditures. This has hampered achievements in health
care and education and, if not addressed, might put improvements in these sectors
at risk. In the long term, this will lead to a failure to develop the human resource
base needed to exploit The Gambia's comparative advantages.

8. 
Looking at The Gambia's development since independence, the DPR notes that
the country has succeeded in reversing the economy's deteriorating path, which was the
consequence of poorly designed policies adopted after the mid- 1970s. After falling into a
severe crisis in the mid-80s and early-90s, progress has been achieved since 1997 in
laying the foundation for sustainable growth. Despite these improvements, exogenous
risks such as erratic rainfall, declines in the terms of trade, regional instability are not
negligible. Nonetheless, thus far, the track record reveals that the key risk is the
Government's commitment to addressing the country's structural weaknesses in a
sustained manner.

9. 
The analysis in the DPR presents three scenarios for the future of The Gambia's
development: the status quo, pro-poor reforms, or deteriorating policy-making. The

assumptions made in the pro-poor scenario are consistent with the recommendations of
the PRSP. In the pro-poor scenario, there is a substantial decline in poverty by 2008, but
this assumes no external shocks, which may be optimistic.

10. 
Like the PRSP, the DPR concludes that to achieve the growth and poverty
reduction desired, the Government must focus on: (i) containing deficits and a growing
domestic debt that has crowded out the Government's priority spending; (ii) improving
the investment climate in order to encourage private sector-led growth and economic
diversification; (iii) investing in people by expanding access to and the quality of social
services; and (iv) strengthening public expenditure management by strengthening
systems and clarifying the role of the state.

Economic Developments Since the Previous CAS

11. 
Since 1998, real GDP has grown steadily, by an average of 5.3 percent per year.
This significant growth followed a long period of stagnation, and it reflects progress on
policy reform, but also reflects four years of favorable weather. As such, it is sustainable
only if policy reforms keep pace and even accelerate to protect the country from external
shocks.

12. Most of the other economic indicators also progressed on average during the
period of the last CAS as reflected in Table 2 below. The Gambia succeeded in reducing
its external current account deficit from 1998 through 2000, but it grew slightly again in
2001 to -14.8 percent of GDP, due in part to the unprogrammed importation of electricity
generators. Exports, primarily groundnuts and re-exported goods, grew steadily
throughout the period.

13. 
From 1998 to 2000, the fiscal situation stabilized. The overall budget deficit had
been contained at an average level of 4.3 percent of GDP during this period, but

increased to 8.7 percent of GDP in 2001 due to a one-time repayment to Alimenta for the
groundnut processing plant and increased expenditures related to elections. Domestic
revenues also faltered from 19.6 percent of GDP in 2000 to 17.3 percent in 2001. This
reflected weak tax administration, falling revenues from transit trade, and arrears to the
Government from some public enterprises.
14. 
Although fiscal balances improved prior to 2001, the composition of expenditures
did not improve. Education expenditures have fallen as a share of total expenditures
from 13.1 percent in 1999 to 12.3 percent in 2001. Similarly, overall expenditures in the
priority sectors (health, education and agriculture) have also fallen slightly as a share of
total expenditures during this period. This was in spite of the HIPC resources which were
available to the social sectors in 2001.
Since 1993, the composition of expenditures has been affected by the increasing
15. 
share servicing the domestic debt, which is unaffected by HIPC relief. In 2000, domestic
debt servicing absorbed approximately 19 percent of domestic revenues and this grew to
Figure 1: Impact of Domestic Debt Ser vicing 
23 percent in 2001. As shown in
Figure 1, the servicing of this debt is
squeezing out expenditures on social
services and capital investments. The
stock of domestic debt held in T-Bills
reached 31 percent of GDP by end-2001.
As the stock of debt has grown, so has
the interest rate on these T-Bills, which
rose from 12 percent in 2000 to 15
percent in 2001 and 18 percent in 2002.
These higher rates are also harming the
private sector, which must compete with
the Government for access to credit and
finds these rates prohibitive for most

16. 
The recent slippage of fiscal control is linked in part to the elections. However,
there is also a need to systematically strengthen both the volume and the quality of public
expenditures. The fiduciary issues surrounding the budget and the reforms which are
under way or planned are described below:
* Budget Formulation: Budgets are planned centrally, with little participation. Not
all expenditures are included in the government budget. The Gambia has embarked
on PERs in selected sectors and is expected to introduce program-based budgeting.
These actions will enhance budgeting capacity in the medium term.
* Budget Execution: Commitments are not clearly recorded and data reconciliation is
not undertaken regularly. The authorities have recognized the significance of
regular fiscal and monetary data reconciliation and have also planned for the
computerization of the existing internal audit function and tracking surveys.

- 6 -

* Budget Reporting: Reporting is the most problematic area. There are delays in
reporting from line ministries and some project-financed expenditures run their own
accounting cycle. The Government has failed to submit audited accounts to the
legislature for many years. Steps are being taken to speed up the process and
eliminate or substantially reduce the number of accounts. In the medium term, the
introduction of an Integrated Financial Management Information System (IFMIS) in
the accountant-general's office with electronic links to spending agencies should
assist greatly with expenditure control and reporting.
The reforms related to improving public expenditure management which are under way are
supported by the Bank-financed Capacity Building for Economic Management Project
(CBEMP) and by the IMF, DFID and UNDP. While there is enough support for all the
technical assistance required, the Government is working closely with donors to ensure that
the effort is well coordinated.
17. 
In addition to addressing the issue of public expenditure management, authorities
have tackled other reforms related to improving the investment climate. The
Privatization Act introduced in 2000 established The Gambian Divestiture Agency
(GDA). The privatization of 10 public enterprises, including three groundnut processing
plants, has been approved by Cabinet as a result. The Gambia Public Procurement Act
2001 was gazetted on February 1, 2002. The Act establishes The Gambia Public
Procurement Authority (GPPA). The IDA-financed CBEMP will provide for its
establishment and first eight months of operations, after which it should be funded
through the Government's own budget.

18. 
However, the privatization program has many challenges ahead. The Government
needs to complete the privatization of Track II companies, which are the smaller ones,
and show greater progress toward the privatization of Track I companies, 3 which include
groundnuts, water and energy, and telecommunications. Having repaid Alimenta, the
Government has yet to tackle the final sale of the groundnut assets. In addition, the
Govemment's strategies for privatizing the energy and water utility (NAWEC),
telecommunications, transportation and the port are not yet clear.

19. 
In November 2002, The Gambia became the third African country to receive a
sovereign credit rating by Fitch under a U.S. supported initiative. The report stressed that
the rating (B minus) would depend upon fulfilling the completion point triggers under the
enhanced HIPC Initiative, and that failure to do so would lead to downgrading.

Anti-Money Laundering

20. 
The Gambians have drafted an anti-money laundering bill which should be
adopted in the coming months. In addition, The Gambia has ratified nine of twelve
intemational anti-terrorism conventions and has issued the necessary blocking orders.

3 Track I companies are those that are of key importance to the economy and require legislative support to
facilitate transactions. Track 11 are those that represent other government equity investments that can be
sold without needing legislative or regulatory support.

-7-

Respecting Core Labor Standards

21. 
The Gambia has ratified all eight fundamental conventions of International
Labour Organisation (ILO) related to the Core Labor Standards: (i) freedom of
association and the right to collective bargaining; (ii) equal opportunity and non-
discrimination in employment; (iii) elimination of all forms of forced or compulsory
labor; and (iv) effective abolition of child labor, with priority to the worst forms.
Implementation of these standards has not been reviewed comprehensively, but 1LO
reports indicate that the elimination of child labor is progressing in The Gambia. One
exception to the implementation of the principle is the Almudu phenomenon. Almudu are
teenagers who adopt a person with knowledge of Islam and the Qur'an as their master
teacher. In return, the children do light work for the upkeep of the informal school and
the master teacher. This phenomenon has strong cultural underpinnings and debates on
its elimination have touched upon religious and cultural sensitivities.

Sources of Growth
22. 
In the last four years, the economy has expanded at a relatively high pace, albeit
in a context of high population growth. The principal sources of growth remain
agriculture, tourism and transit trade. Agriculture has benefited from good rains over
the past three seasons and some degree of diversification away from traditional crop of
groundnuts. Nonetheless, the production of groundnuts - the main cash crop in The
Gambia - has increased substantially, as well as the amounts processed and exported
through official channels (Figure 2). Other crops have also fared well in recent years,
and fishing grew by an estimated 18 percent in 2001. Despite this good performance, the
Government's diversification strategy needs to be clearer, as do the institutional
arrangements for the sector. The Department of State for Agriculture was absorbed under
the Presidency in November 2002, which hinders transparency in the sector and may
discourage investors.

23. 
The tourism sector has fared less well, with a falling level of tourist arrivals (at
about 78,000 per year in 2000, down from about 90,000 in 1999). However, the sector
withstood the drop in tourism worldwide in 2001 fairly well and is now rebounding.
Moreover, the Govbrnment is introducing measures to help the sector, including
reclassifying and upgrading hotels, promoting the sector to prospective investors and
tourists, and marketing The Gambia's impressive bird life to eco-tourists. The Government
has also tried to stem the trend toward charter tourism, which has a lower local value-added
content, though it is likely that this will remain an important niche market for The Gambia.
In fact, in 2002, tourist charters increased and this growth is expected to continue.

24. 
Globalization and regional integration are both having an impact on The
Gambia's future. Transit trade has historically accounted for a large share of The
Gambia's revenues because the country liberalized trade earlier than neighboring countries,
benefited from being the only English-speaking country in the area and developed a
relatively efficient port. Transit trade of products such as textiles, vehicles, rice, tea, and
sugar still provides about 15 percent of GDP, 20 percent of fiscal revenues, and 85 percent
of all exports. However, the country's re-export trade has been affected by WAEMU's
common external tariff refofrms and the increased competitiveness of the CFA zone
following the 1994 devaluation. In 2001, the volume of re-exports increased significantly,
but the revenues fell slightly as a result of lower tariffs. Policy reforms have enhanced the
short-term prospects for the volume of transit trade, with a streamlining of the number of
Gambian tariff bands to four, and a reduction in the highest rate to 18 percent. Banjul
harbor remains one of the comparatively efficient container ports in Western Africa (it
takes about two weeks to clear a container through customs in Banjul, as opposed to four
weeks in Dakar). However, regular border closings with Senegal and the introduction and
abandonment of a pre-shipment inspection scheme have hindered growth in re-export trade.
25. 
Though The Gambia maintains some advantages in transit trade, the country must
now focus on developing new sources of overseas trade. The Gateway Project, which was
approved by the Board in February 2002, is supporting The Gambia's diversification from
re-export trade. The strategy behind the Gateway presented a clear vision for export-based
growth in which The Gambia focused on its key traditional strengths: the tourism industry;
a trade and services economy; and the growing development of agribusiness. Tourism and
processed agricultural exports could also develop the critical air links which might allow
The Gambia to become more competitive in exporting such products as fish, fresh
vegetables and flowers. The Gateway Project also foresees the development of The
Gambia as a teleport, where information could be processed and transmitted efficiently.
26. 
The Gambia must also take advantage of the benefits of regional integration,
which given the country's small size and location within Senegal's borders are likely to be
extensive. This process is well under way as The Gambia is a member of no less than 16
regional organizations related to economic and monetary integration, agriculture, natural
resources, health, and transport. The most important of these is ECOWAS. The Gambia is
not a member of WAEMU, as it has its own currency and central bank. However, five
West African non-WAEMU countries (Ghana, Nigeria, The Gambia, Guinea and Sierra
Leone) declared their intention to proceed with a monetary union among the non-CFA
Franc countries of the Region by July 2005. To that end, they have committed themselves

- 9 -

to achieving a 5 percent inflation rate by 2003; reducing budget deficits to 4 percent of
GDP and central bank financing of budget deficits to 10 percent of the previous year's
government revenues; maintaining foreign exchange reserves to six months of imports;
creating a Convergence Council to help coordinate macroeconomic policies; and setting up
a common central bank. With regard to these targets, recent economic performance would
indicate that The Gambia can meet all of them, though fiscal discipline would need to
improve over that of the last two years (preliminary data place deficits at 8.7 percent of
GDP for 2001 and around 7.6 percent of GDP for 2002).

27. 
In addition to progressing towards the standards of ECOWAS, in January 2003 The
Gambia became eligible to export to the United States under the African Growth and
Opportunity Act. The Gambia also has reciprocal trade agreements with the U.K. and
Senegal. Like its ECOWAS membership, these agreements are providing an important
impetus to The Gambia to pursue needed policy reforms, but the country will need to go
further to take advantage of the trading opportunities presented. In addition, the Gambia
should identify sectors where cross-border coordination or investment will yield results.
The Private Sector Development Forum in November 2002 identified the potential for
common approaches in agribusiness and tourism, for example, as a way of designing joint
training and marketing strategies.

28. 
Taking full advantage of regional cooperation remains critical because the
Gambians' focus on trade places them in close competition with their neighboring
countries. Senegal has plans to invest in a new port for bulk shipments as well as a new
international airport. President Wade has clearly articulated his vision for Senegal to
become the gateway to West Africa. In parallel, Cape Verde has efficiently pursued the
upgrade of its airport on the island of Sal, so that it is now the only airport in the region
with a top certification from the Federal Aviation Authority in the United States, which the
Cape Verdeans hope will allow it to become a gateway for tourism and aerial transport. In
order to succeed in increasing trade in The Gambia, enterprises will require investment
from the private sector and investment in infrastructure. The Government's role in
advancing The Gambia's bid for its share of regional trade should be to improve the
investment climate, thereby attracting the necessary investments in infrastructure and the
private sector.

29. 
The PRSP acknowledges that the energy and water sectors in The Gambia are two
of the largest constraints to the country's growth. NAWEC is the state-owned company in
energy and water, and its future is critical if the private sector led growth envisaged in the
PRSP is to occur. In 2000 and 2001, NAWEC faced a net loss of US$2.5 million and
US$1.4 million, respectively. Electricity and water tariffs are low and there are no guiding
principles for their regulation. In water, the coverage ratio in urban areas is low. Only
Banjul and the Tourist Development Area have central sewage systems, but sewage is not
treated in Banjul prior to pumping it into the sea.

30. 
NAWEC has been granted a monopoly to generate, transport and distribute
electricity, and it currently covers the Greater Banjul Area and six other centers. In 2001,
the energy sector was placed under the Presidency, and NAWEC reports directly to that
office. As of 2001, access to electricity was only 23 percent nationally and 35 percent in

- 10-

Banjul. Peak load is limited to about 26 MW due to generation constraints and suppressed
demand is estimated at about 5 MW. In the next five years, an additional generation of
about 15 MW will be needed. Beyond these five years, regional interconnections with
Guinea and Senegal and the West Africa power grid should provide for additional
generation. In addition to generation, NAWEC requires significant investment in
transmission and distribution equipment, as well as improved management. Currently,
NAWEC is suffering from high losses and relatively low collection rates. It also faces
environmental problems at its plants and a lack of storage for fuel. There is currently no
rural electrification strategy. In order to achieve the growth objectives of the PRSP, which
are presented below, The Gambia will need to remove the constraints posed by a lack of
adequate water and energy infrastructure.

III. THE GAMBIA'S DEVELOPMENT AGENDA

Poverty Analysis in the PRSP

31. 
The Gambian PRSP presented a sound poverty analysis based on data from
household surveys in 1989, 1992 and 1998. This data was complemented by a recent
series of Participatory Poverty Assessments. The results show a dramatic increase in
poverty between 1992 and 1998. The reasons for this increase are most likely linked to
declining incomes and ineffective and poorly targeted public expenditures during this
period. Box 1 below summarizes the poverty profile of The Gambia.

32. 
The poverty analysis done in the PRSP is impressive, but some of the data sources
are becoming dated. A new Household Survey (HHS) has recently been launched and a
new census is scheduled for 2003. The resulting data will greatly enhance The Gambia's
ability to monitor progress since 1998.

Policy Framework Developed in The Gambia's PRSP

33. 
Given the poverty profile described above, The Gambia has focused its PRSP on
reducing poverty through increasing equity. The PRSP acknowledges the need for
continued growth, but less emphasis is given to the strategy behind this growth. The
country identifies five pillars for its policy framework. These pillars are as follows:

1) Create an enabling policy environment to promote economic growth and
poverty reduction;
2) Enhance the productive capacity and social protection of the poor and
vulnerable;
3) Improve coverage of the basic social service needs of the poor and
vulnerable;
4) Build the capacity of local communities and civil society organizations to
play an active role in the development process; and
5) Mainstream gender equity, environmental issues, nutrition, governance
and HIV/AIDS awareness into all development programs.

34. 
The PRSP also presents a macroeconomic framework for 2003 to 2005 which is
largely consistent with the above pillars. In this framework, The Gambia identifies

macroeconomic stability as its key objective, and specifies that this stability should be
created through market-based incentives conducive to private sector growth and poverty
alleviation. The macroeconomic framework focuses on:

a) Strengthening public finances to lower the budget deficit and the levels of
domestic debt;
b) Deepening structural reforms to foster growth;
c) Developing the human resource capacity of the public sector;
d) Implementing a social sector agenda focusing on health, education and
agriculture; and
Improving the macro and social databases to facilitate better policy
formulation focused on poverty reduction.

As indicated in Table 2 below, real GDP is projected to grow at six percent per
year in the PRSP, while the fiscal deficit as a percent of GDP would decline. Exports
would also continue to grow, though at a declining rate. The growth strategy presented
focuses on increasing exports in agriculture, tourism and transit trade, but details are very
limited. The development of these sectoral growth strategies is a key objective for the
first year of implementation of the PRSP. The CAS projections, which are presented in
Annex 1, show slightly different rates of GDP growth and inflation which are based on
more recent information.

The sectors given priority in The Gambia's PRSP are health, education and
agriculture. The PRSP presents expenditure programs for the priority sectors and for
some infrastructure sectors, though there was no distinction between capital and recurrent
expenditures, and downstream recurrent expenditures resulting from capital investments
were not included. Moreover, since the strategy for infrastructure did not cover all
priorities, it is likely that the costs will increase.

37. 
The Joint Staff Assessment (JSA) of the World Bank and IMF concluded that the
PRSP represented a credible poverty reduction strategy, which had been prepared in a
participatory manner and included a good analysis of poverty. Staffs concluded that the
PRSP provided a clear set of indicators for monitoring the implementation of the
strategies in health and education, but not for agriculture. In addition, the JSA concluded
that the macroeconomic targets set in the PRSP are achievable if prudent macroeconomic
policies and key structural reforms are undertaken. The need to develop a full Medium
Term Economic Framework was flagged, as was the need to present a clear strategy for

infrastructure development, including for such key sectors as energy and water. In

addition, the JSA identified five risks for the successful implementation of the PRSP,
which were: regional security tensions; the possible persistence of governance issues;
limited institutional capacity; inability to finance the PRSP with external resources; and
adverse external shocks.

- 13 -

External Financing Requirements

38. 
In its PRSP, The Gambia has presented an indicative funding gap of US$67 million
for the three-year period of the CAS. However, since the PRSP was completed, the
Government has updated its costing scenarios and has held a Round Table in September
2002. In the latest costings presented by the Government, the total cost of PRSP-related
expenditures from FY03-05 was projected to be US$186 million, of which the Government
budget would finance US$58.5 million and donors would finance US$69 million, which
leaves a financing gap of approximately US$58.5 million. However, the first year of PRSP
expenditures have been adequately covered by the Government and the donors.

Consultation Process

39. 
In addition to the very participative process followed in the preparation of the
PRSP, the Bank pursued further consultations about the specific role of IDA in The
Gambia's development. In April 2002, a Bank team held consultations on the Country
Assistance Strategy for 2003-2005. The team met with the Secretaries of State, Permanent
Secretaries and/or senior staff in each of the development-related Departments of State.

40. 
In the Department of State for Finance and Economic Affairs, concerns focused on
the need for better human and technical capacity to monitor the budget process. In
Agriculture, concerns were to continue the work on research started under a previous
World Bank project and to expand extension. In Tourism, authorities were keen to share
the elements of their new strategy and said the focus would be on diversifying and
upgrading The Gambia's tourist attraction. They expressed a strong desire for investment,
possibly from the IFC, in the high-end of the hotel industry. In Local Government, the
Bank presented the challenges inherent in the newly adopted Local Government Act and
stressed the need for capacity building at the local government level. Both the Health and
Education, representatives stressed the need for sustained investment in their sectors, while
conceding that measures to improve the effectiveness of these expenditures were essential.
The officials from Trade stressed the importance of implementing the ongoing Gateway
Project successfully and ensuring an improved investment climate along with investments
supporting infrastructure, particularly electricity.

41. 
In addition to meeting with government representatives, the team held meetings
with civil society in three towns and villages. Specifically, nine meetings were held with
the following groups: the NGO umbrella organization, TANGO; a group of press and
radio journalists; a group of parliamentarians from the National Assembly; The Gambia
Teachers' Union; a group of entrepreneurs and private sector operators; a women's group
from Banjul called WISDOM; the District Development Committee from Mansa Konko;
the producers association from the village of YBK Fula; and the women's producer
association from the village of Madina Nfally.

42. 
In each meeting, the team sought feedback on the way the Bank does business in
The Gambia and on priorities for IDA financing. The most pressing concerns - based on
the number of times the subject was raised by different groups - and the Bank's planned
response are presented in Box 2 below.

- 14-

3 

Box 2: What the Bank Heard and Planned Response
I. Poor communication by the World Bank: This concern, which was raised 17 times, was the
only topic raised by every group. Plans to address this: The Bank is in the process of
recruiting a liaison officer for the World Bank who would be based in Banjul. The principal
responsibilities of this liaison officer would include improving communications and
increasing the Bank's response time on procurement-and disbursement issues (see No. 4
below). The country team has also subsequently agreed to prepare press releases with
Government at the- end of all major missions.
2. Need-access to credit: The Bank team heard this from the private sector in Banjul, the village
associations and the women's group. Their concerns were not only access to credit but also access
at affordable interest rates. Plans to address this: The Gambia's high interest rates need to be
addressed through continued reduction of public borrowing domestically. In addition, the
Bank plan's to address some issues in rural finance through the planned Community Driven
Development (CDD) operation.
Improve teacher traininn and retention: The high ranking of this concern is affected-by the
fact that the Bank team met with the teachers' union, where the concern was repeated many times. - -
Plans to address this: This would be addressed through analysis of civil service reform and
through the planned second phase of the education APL.-
4. World Bank processes are slow: Procurement bottlenecks were probably the obstacle raised
most often; however, many felt that the Bank's lack of presence in Banjul and the need to refer
back to Washington for most decisions were also reasons for slow implementation. Plans to
address this: This will be addressed through the creation of a liaison office in Banjul, staffed
by someone with knowledge of procurement and by the decentralization of task managers to
Dakar.
5. Need access to equipment: This concern is clearly linked to credit. If the two were considered
jointly, they would be overwhelmingly the number one concern. Plans to address this: This
should also be addressed through improving access to credit and through the CDD
operation. The Private Sector Assessment (PSA) should also examine the private sector's-
ability to grow in this area.
Improve public financial management and accountability: This concern was raised by the
press, the parliamentarians and the NGOs. Plans to-address this: This issue, which is-also at
the core of the PRSP, will be addressed through core diagnostic work (CFAA, CPAR and
PER) as well as through continued assistance from the Bank-financed Capacity Building for
Economic Management Project (CBEMP).
7. Need access to storage: This was the other major concern of the agricultural producers and the
private sector. Plans to address this: PSA will look at the issue of agricultural storage and it
could be addressed through the CDD.
8. Re-intecrate the PlUs back into,the line Departments: This was a-topic raised with a lot of
feeling by the National Assembly but, for the most part, it was not supported by the Departments-
involved.. Plans to address this: The Bank sent a mission in May 2002 to examine-this issue
more closely and is following it up within the context of the CPPR dialog.
9. -The World Bank is too top-down: Linked to their concern on the slow operations of the World -
Bank, several participants noted that the Bank requires that too many decisions be made-at -
headquarters. Plans to address this: This will be addressed through the opening of the
Bank's liaison office in Banjul as well as the ongoing decentralization to Dakar.
10. Finance community vroiects directly: There were many participants who suggested that the
Bank should finance communities directly rather than through the Central Government. Plans to
address this: The CAS not only foresees the.inclusion of a CDD Project but also adopts
more direct approaches with the communities in the sectoral projects included.

6. 

- 15 -

43. 
In addition to these ten most prevalent concerns, other concerns raised included:
the need to stop political interference in project management and in public financial
management; the need to develop linkages between the private sector operators and rural
producers; and the need to abandon the policies of double shifts and multigrade teaching
in basic education. This last issue will be reviewed in the context of preparing the second
phase of the Education APL.

IV. BANK'S PERFORMANCE AND EXPERIENCE UNDER PREVIOUS CAS

Performance Under the Previous CAS

44. 
In the 1998 CAS, the strategy adopted for reducing poverty envisaged a
combination of lending and advisory services focused on: economic management and
capacity building; private sector development; rural development; and social
development. Five projects totaling US$81 million have been approved since the
presentation of the CAS.

45. 
Table 3 below looks at the activities planned and achieved in the last CAS. A
retrospective look at the Bank's lending shows very clearly how important it is to have
the commitment of the borrower before pursuing a strategy. The Bank was unable to
launch planned lending or sector work in rural development, energy or economic reform
because the Government was not prepared to go forward with these reforms. The
planned LIL in population proved unnecessary given the population activities
incorporated into the Participatory Health, Population and Nutrition Project (PHPNP).

46. 
In the case of rural development, the decision not to lend reflected in part the
limited success of the Bank's previous program. A 1998 an Implementation Completion
Report (ICR) on the Agricultural Services Project judged this intervention as unsatisfactory
- the Bank's performance on appraisal and supervision as well as the Borrower's
performance on implementation were all judged deficient. The Government agreed in its
assessment that any future operations should focus on community organizations,
specifically on women's groups, and should be decentralized. In the case of infrastructure,
the LIL for electricity was not pursued by the Government but the Bank provided limited
support to the sector through a Project Preparation Facility (PPF) for this project.

47. 
Regarding the Economic Reform Credit, the Bank was unable to pursue an active
dialogue with the Government on reforms of key public enterprises because of the
expropriation of the groundnut processing plants and a limited response from
Government on plans for the future of NAWEC.

48. 
The most fruitful dialogue with the Bank on privatization was in the context of the
Gateway Project which does support the Gambian Divestiture Agency (GDA) and led to
the Divestiture Act of 2001 in which the Government agreed to the goal of divesting
fifteen public enterprises. Gateway will also provide technical assistance for the
privatization of the telecommunications and transport sectors.

49. 
The CBEMP is helping to address the other major area for economic policy
reform which has been improving public expenditure management, notably in increasing
transparency around budgetary processes. The Financial Sector Study, which was
completed, also highlighted the need for some reforms in the banking and insurance
systems and for a deepening of the T-bill market.

50. 
Health and education were a core part of the last CAS. The PHPNP struggled
initially but has now been upgraded to satisfactory, and indicators show promising results
on the Integrated Childhood Illness component. The health sector has also led the way on
the multisectoral HIV/AIDS Rapid Response Project, the need for which was not foreseen
in the last CAS, but which has gotten off to a slow but steady start. The education sector
continues to be the strongest performer in The Gambia. The project planned in the last
CAS became an APL and the implementation of the first phase has gone smoothly.

51. 
The Global Environment Facility gave a grant of US$25,000 to The Gambia in
September 1999 for the preparation of an Integrated Marine and Coastal Biodiversity
Management Project. In June 2002, another grant of US$985,104 was approved for the
project, which will finance improved conservation management, including of protected
areas and of breeding and nursery grounds for critical fish species.

52. 
In 1999, The Gambia received an Institutional Development Fund (IDF) grant for
$445,000 for building the capacity of the National Council for Arts and Culture. The grant
financed the development of a strategic plan for the agency, staff training, a computerized
accounting system, strengthened publishing capacity and a review of the legal and fiscal
framework for the cultural sector. Another IDF grant ($482,000) is under implementation
for strengthening the capacity of the accountancy profession in The Gambia.

- 17 -

53. 
Portfolio performance and outcome. For the period FY96-02, out of seven
projects evaluated by the Bank's Operations Evaluation Department (OED), four were
rated satisfactory in terms of outcome (57 percent), two made a substantial contribution
to institutional development (29 percent), while the sustainability of two operations was
considered as likely. Bank performance at entry was rated satisfactory in four out of
those 7 projects (57 percent), and Bank performance in terms of supervision was
satisfactory in 5 projects (71 percent).

The Existing Portfolio

54. 
Size and Composition. As of end-December 2002, the Bank's portfolio for The
Gambia included six projects for a committed amount of US$99 million and a disbursed
amount of US$35.5 million. The portfolio is relatively young, with three projects having
been approved within the last two years (representing $46 million or 46 percent of total
commitments).

Performance. The last CAS reported a strong improvement in the Bank's portfolio.
In FY96, problem projects represented 17 percent of the number of projects at risk, 25
percent in FY99, 0 percent in FY00. Unfortunately, that percentage climbed back up to 25
percent in FY01 and 33 percent in FY02. As of July 2002, however, with the upgrade of the
PHPNP, the percentage was back down to 17 percent of projects or 15 percent of total
commitments (US$15 million of US$99 million total commitments). The Poverty
Alleviation and Capacity Building Project is the only one currently rated unsatisfactory for
implementation progress and development objective. Factors affecting performance have
included political interference, poor financial management and reporting delays.

56. 
Consultations with the Government on portfolio performance were strengthened in
the last twelve months. A Country Portfolio Performance Review (CPPR) was carried out
in April 2002 and showed the need to improve the country's capacity for resource utilization
on investments (para. 57). A follow-up CPPR seminar was organized in November 2002
which showed encouraging results, but also the need to sustain efforts in the areas of
financial management and procurement The Bank plans to continue frequent portfolio
reviews, and the upcoming opening of a liaison office in Banjul will greatly facilitate
portfolio management.

Utilization of Resources. The disbursement ratio4 rose steadily from about 26
percent in FY95 to about 52 percent in FY98 (Figure 3). Most operations of the previous
generation closed by 1998, which
partially explains the dip in
disbursements in FY99, as new
operations were gradually added to
the pipeline. The disbursement
ratio hovered around 15 percent in
FY00 and 01. Following the April
2002 CPPR, the disbursement ratio
' 
picked up in FY02 to 24 percent
(the average disbursement ratio for
~the Africa Region is 22 percent).

Fiduciary Compliance. Development Credit Agreements for IDA-financed
projects normally establish the time period for submission of audit reports as six months
after the year's end. Special accounts, project account SOEs and executing agency accounts
are audited. As of January 2003, three out of ten audit reports were considered overdue
because they did not include financial statements of the executing agency. The Bank is
following up with the Govemment to obtain these financial statements.

IFC and MIGA

59. 
The IFC currently has three projects under implementation in The Gambia. The first
is a loan guarantee for Kerr Kande Farm, which will enable this company to modernize its
production of eggs and chicken products in Banjul. The second is a loan guarantee for
NDOW Middle and High School, which will enable the school's owner to complete work
on the Middle and High School. The third loan is for Lyefish development.

4Disbursement ratio is the ratio of disbursements during the year to the undisbursed balance of the Bank's

60. 
The Gambians expressed an interest in further involvement of the IFC in their
country during CAS consultations. In particular, the group of entrepreneurs with whom the
Bank met was keen to have contact with the IFC, as were the women's groups. They were
particularly interested in securing financing for agribusiness enterprises. The Government
expressed interest in the IFC investing in the tourism sector, particularly in helping them
expand their tourist hotels. However, the IFC has had several non-performing loans in The
Gambia and has at least one ongoing litigation with a Gambian company, so it is unlikely
that there will be new investments until this situation improves.

61. 
Although The Gambia is a member of MIGA, it has no guarantees or other activities
with MIGA at this time.

Role of Other Partners

62. 
The Gambia is highly dependent on external development assistance. The country
received US$49 million in net official development assistance in 2000, which amounts to
US$38 per capita and 11.8 percent of GN1.5 Most of this assistance comes through
multilaterals (US$24.9 million),6 which accounted for 51 percent of total development
assistance in 2000. Bilateral assistance (US$14.6 million) accounted for 30 percent of total
assistance in 2000. See Table 5 for a breakdown of donor activities by sector.

63. 
The Government has prepared a comprehensive technical assistance program to
support the PRSP, which was presented at the September 2002 Round Table. The Bank
works closely with the IMM, EU, UNDP and DFID on programs to strengthen public
expenditure management and statistics. Consistent with the ongoing SWAPs in health and
education, the Bank will continue to cooperate closely with U.N. agencies, DFID and other
donorsin-the social sectors. The EU's main focus areas are rural development and
transport, and the Bank will work closely with AfDB and the EU in the preparation of the
planned CDD operation.

64. 
The IMF approved a new three-year Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility
(PRGF) for SDR 20.2 million on July 10, 2002. The first review of the PRGF should have
been completed in December, but because of fiscal slippages, the review could not be
completed and has been extended to February 2003.

65. 
The European Union (EU) is in the process of finalizing its Country Support
Strategy (CSS) for the period 2002-2007. The CSS is anchored in the PRSP and the
strategy proposes aid in two focal sectors - rural development and transport - capacity
building being a non-focal theme. The indicative envelope of US$37 million covers
programs in reform of local government and decentralization (US$10 million), rural private
sector development (US$3 million), food security and income generation (US$2 million),
transport (US$15 million). Finally, US$6 million is allocated for capacity building and
US$1 million for contribution to regional projects.

development. Cross-cutting issues will include gender equity, advocacy, resource
mobilization, partnerships, aid coordination, HIV/AIDS and the environment.

67. 
Support provided by the African Development Bank, the Islamic Development
Bank, and OPEC is mainly in the social sectors and infrastructure programs.

68. 
DFID is also preparing a country strategy anchored on a program to provide
budgetary support to the PRSP, possibly in the education sector, linked with support to
public expenditure management and wider governance reform (including support to civil
society and the justice sector). DFID anticipates that the existing level of their support
will rise steadily between now and 2005-06, but budgetary support depends on
satisfactory implementation of public financial management reform.

Strategic Selectivity

V. The FY03-05 CAS

69. 
There are a number of inputs into this CAS which were summarized in previous
sections: the overarching framework of the PRSP, the analytic inputs of the DPR, the Bank's
past experience in The Gambia, the performance of the current portfolio, what the Bank
heard in consultations with Government and civil society, and the role of other partners.

70. 
Taking all of these into account, the challenge is to respond within the constraints
of The Gambia's IDA allocation, absorptive capacity and debt sustainability. In so doing,
the Bank is planning activities which support three of the five pillars of The Gambia's
PRSP (the breakdown of activity by pillar is given in Annex 12). The Bank's efforts are
focused on the first, third and fourth pillars, and specifically on three selective objectives
under these pillars. These objectives are: improving public expenditure management;
enhancing the equity and quality of social service delivery; and, promoting private sector-
led growth. The rationale for this selection is, first, that these objectives reflect the three
priorities for policy reform highlighted in the PRSP, and second, that these are also the
priorities which both emerged from the Bank's analysis and dialogue with the
Government and other donors and played to the strengths of the Bank's experience.

Non-Lending Services

71. 
The analytical work outlined below focuses on these three objectives, but
particularly on public expenditure management. The ongoing Development Policy
Review, which is discussed in paras. 7-10, has helped to shape the vision of this CAS.

72. With regard to public expenditure management, the CAS also places a Country
Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) in FY03, a Public Expenditure Review
(PER) in FY04 and a Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR) in FY05. Each of
these diagnoses will further clarify capacity shortfalls and needed reforms in public
financial management. The PER, which was initiated in 2002 by the Government, the
Bank and DFID, will focus on five sectors: health, education, agriculture, public works

- 22 -

and local government. It will help to refine a program of priority expenditures consistent
with the PRSP in each sector and tie these priorities into the budgeting process.

Poverty Assessment

73. With regard to improving social service delivery, the Government has asked the
Bank to examine the issues of decentralization and civil service reform from a perspective of
improving service delivery in the rural areas. In April 2002, The Gambia passed a new
Local Government Act. This Act sketches the future of decentralization, but it is clear that
capacity building and civil service reform must accompany it. Staffing health and education
facilities in rural areas has become a major hurdle prohibiting effective service delivery.

74. 
In 2002, The Gambia received a Public/Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility
(PPIAF) grant to fine-tune the divestiture program already under way and to undertake a
study on the Regulatory Framework. This study will prepare the groundwork for the
establishment of the Multisectoral Regulatory Agency, the establishment of which is
financed under the Gateway Project. The Private Sector Assessment (PSA) programmed for
FY05 will complement the regulatory study by looking at areas which need improvement in
order to attract foreign investment, including administrative barriers and needed reforms and
investment in infrastructure. In addition, the PSA will look at potential sources of growth,
focusing on rural growth through agribusiness or rural financial markets.

75. 
The Gambians have presented a solid poverty assessment in their PRSP, as well as
a plan for monitoring key outcome indicators. A new Household Survey (HHS) should be
completed by early 2003 and a new census is planned for 2003. This data, plus that from
smaller surveys in the sectors, should provide an excellent opportunity for updating the
poverty analysis. IDA will plan to work with the Government and other partners to ensure
that an updated Poverty Assessment is prepared by FY05. Using the analysis presented in
the PRSP as a baseline, it will be possible to measure the initial impact of reform efforts
and re-establish a solid baseline for future reforms. As part of this Poverty Assessment, the
Bank plans to do a Poverty and Social Impact Analysis (PSIA) for reforms in energy and
groundnuts because these reforms are the most likely to have a social impact.

Lending Amounts, Scenarios and Triggers

76. 
Three operations are planned in the base case lending scenario, which correspond
to the priority sectors: health, education, and agriculture. In the high case scenario, IDA

- 23 -

proposes two additional operations - one which supports investment in the energy sector
and one which would provide support for policy reform. In order for these operations to
succeed, and, more importantly, in order for The Gambia to achieve its objective of six
percent annual growth in GDP, the Government will need to commit itself to aggressively
pursuing transparency in the energy sector and improved public financial management.
Thus, the triggers which would allow IDA to move to the high case lending scenario are
closely linked with these reforms. If policy performance deteriorated, and The Gambia
were to fall into the low case scenario, the IDA program would only include the
education operation because this is a sector in which implementation and results have
been very good. Because of the sector's impact, the Bank could continue to support the
sector even if the policy dialogue were strained in other areas.

*$2.5 million of this $10 million would be in the form of an IDA grant.

77. 

The Gambia has an IDA allocation of SDR 19 million or approximately US$25

million. This is the amount programmed in the base case scenario (Table 7 above). Of
this US$25 million, US$10 million is programmed for the second phase of the education
APL. This second phase will focus on expanding the pilot components tested under the
first phase and on strengthening pre-university training. The pilots which have been

successful under the first phase included a girls' scholarship fund, a local languages
component and a decentralization component.

78. 

Of this US$10 million, US$2.5 million would be an IDA grant, which will likely

absorb all of The Gambia's grant allocation for FY04. The education project was
selected for use of the IDA grant allocation because it is key to building capacity. The
grant funds will be directed toward pedagogic inputs such as teacher training and
textbooks. As such, the impact of these funds will be monitorable since the project plans

to support learning assessments at the end of each school year.

79. 
The base-case scenario would also include a follow-up project to the ongoing
PHPNP credit which closes in December 2003. As result of a slow start, the project may
need to be extended. As such, the new project is scheduled as a deliverable for FY05.
The principal goal of the new credit would be to assist the Government to meet the

- 24 -

Millennium Development Goals in health and nutrition. This project would also respond
to the high priority given in the PRSP to reproductive health and nutrition. The new
Health Project will continue to be separate from the ongoing HIV/AIDS Project because
the latter is a multi-sectoral effort with very different institutional and implementation
arrangements. Attempting to merge the two would hinder the implementation of the
critical HIV/AIDS interventions.

80. 
The third project in the base case is a Community Driven Development Project.
One of the reasons that a CDD is needed in The Gambia is that the small size of the
country makes it inefficient to prepare a separate project or program in every sector.
Thus, by working through communities and local governments, the CDD provides a
single mechanism for working across sectors.

81. 
The challenge of the CDD will be to tackle some of the principal concerns
reiterated by the people consulted in PRSP and CAS discussions, namely how to
diversify from groundnuts, improve access to storage, credit and markets and launch
small-scale food processing enterprises. In their PRSP, the Gambians have made
reference to a Social Fund which would act as a single platform for interventions at the
community level. This CDD could be an input into such a Fund if its scope and
institutional arrangements were clarified. The CDD Project would also support capacity
building at the local government level.

82. 
The Bank is considering support to the energy sector. However, this support is
included in the high case because the risks associated in the current environment are
judged to be large, unless the Govermuent can signal its willingness to implement serious
reform in this sector. If the triggers articulated for the high case below are met, this
would be an acceptable harbinger of change.

83. 
The PRSP flags the importance of improvements in the delivery of water and
electricity for private sector-led growth to succeed and the Bank concurs. However, in
the energy and water sectors, a number of elements would need to be addressed for
investments to be fruitful. First, as noted in the JSA, the strategy for the water sector
needs to be clearly articulated. The Government has prepared a draft energy sector
strategy, but energy and water are so closely interlinked that it is difficult to consider a
strategy for one sector without the other. Second, the regulatory framework in place is
inadequate and the role which the new Multisectoral Regulatory Agency would play in
setting and monitoring tariffs should be clarified. In addition, the placement of the
Department of Energy directly under control of the Presidency has led to a lack of
transparency in the sector. Finally, the low level of tariffs and substandard technical and
commercial performance of NAWEC should be addressed.

84. 
The high case scenario also includes a structural adjustment credit which would
provide support for further reforms in telecommunications, transport and groundnuts.
Each of these sectors has parastatals slated for divestiture under the Track I Divestiture
Program, and the Government may require budgetary assistance to implement the
program. At this time, however, the Government's vision for divestiture in these sectors
is not clear. Current public expenditure management in The Gambia does not warrant a

- 25 -

Poverty Reduction Strategy Credit (PRSC), given that there are serious problems with
budget execution and monitoring; however, as noted above, IDA and other donors are
supporting diagnostic work and technical assistance for improving public financial
management. If this work improves capacity and the Government commits to
undertaking the necessary reforms, a PRSC for The Gambia could be considered in the
next CAS.

Base Case Scenario

85. 
The triggers reflect policy performance that is consistent with the PRSP and that
should be met in the course of its implementation. The Gambia is in the base case at this
time.

86. 
The base case scenario assumes that the Government continues with satisfactory
implementation of the PRSP, including sufficient budget allocations to the priority
sectors. It also assumes that macroeconomic performance and performance of the IDA
portfolio remain satisfactory. With regard to governance, it implies annual public
expenditure reviews and progress on legal and judicial reform which is highlighted in the
PRSP and is consistent with the policy agenda discussed for and financed under the
CBEMP. In rural development, the trigger is that the Government adopts a strategy and
performance indicators for rural development by 2003. As indicated in the JSA, these
indicators had been developed for the PRSP, but in the absence of full agreement on them
within the Government, they were not included. The development of such indicators is
an objective of the first progress report on the JSA.

High Case Scenario

87. 
The high case assumes more ambitious progress on PRSP implementation and
that the Government fully integrates the PRSP expenditures into the budget. This is an
important step towards the development of a Medium Term Expenditure Framework.
With regard to public expenditure management, the high case scenario focuses on
improving public financial accountability by implementing the recommendations of the
upcoming CFAA and improving the management of public debt.

88. 
In infrastructure, the Government is expected to complete a strategy for the water
sector and adjust electricity tariffs. The strategy for the water sector must complement
that for the energy sector. In addition, the Government is expected to ensure that the
Multi-sector Regulatory Agency is staffed and operational by 2004. Finally, in moving
to the high case scenario, IDA would like to ensure that the Government remains on track
to meet the education enrollment MDG.

Other Options Considered

89. 
The major alternative considered to the lending program proposed in this CAS
was the exclusion of an energy sector credit in the high case scenario. Because of the
limited IDA allocation, the inclusion of both the energy and the economic reform credit
constrain the amount of resources available for each operation. However, in recent
months the Government has made progress in the energy sector, including the preparation

- 26 -

of a draft strategy articulating their desire to pursue reform. Since the Bank views this
reform as essential for the growth of The Gambia's economy, IDA would want to support
it under this CAS. Although at some point, these two high case projects may be merged
into a single operation, at this time the Bank intends to maintain the economic reform
credit as an independent operation which could support reform in energy as well as in
other sectors such as telecommunications or transport.

90. 
Another alternative considered was to do a follow-on to the Agricultural Services
Project, but given the conclusions of the ICR on the last Agricultural Services Project, the
Bank concluded that a CDD operation would be more appropriate.

91. 
Finally, a number of additional pieces of sector work were considered, looking at
issues ranging from fisheries to groundnut diversification; however, given the constraints
of the budget, the strategy focused on the core diagnostic work plus the Private Sector
Assessment and an informal piece on civil service reform, which was specifically
requested by the Government. Both of these studies are key to the principal objectives
under this CAS, which are to improve public expenditure management and service
delivery and to promote private sector-led growth.

VI. Monitoring Outcomes

92. 
A selection of measurable outcomes will be used to monitor The Gambia's
progress in implementing its PRSP (Annex 12). As shown in Table 9, the PRSP's targets
are broadly consistent with the MDGs. The Bank, with other donors, will align its
operations in support of these indicators in order to ensure progress toward the MDG
targets.

93. 
To assess its own performance, the Bank will closely monitor portfolio
performance indicators for all IDA-financed operations in order to evaluate the
effectiveness of specific operations in achieving desired outcomes. In terms of its overall
assistance program, the Bank will monitor the CAS support to PRSP objectives, using the
Country Partnership Strategy Matrix (Annex 12), and specifically the core CAS
benchmarks shown in Table 10. In addition, the Bank will carry out independent client
surveys and will continue to have regular consultations with the Government, civil
society, donors and NGOs to get feedback and monitor implementation of CAS priorities.

Bank Exposure and Debt Sustainability

94. 
Under the Enhanced HIPC Decision Point in (DP) December 2000, The Gambia
was to receive debt relief amounting to US$90 million in nominal terms, and US$67
million in NPV terms. The debt burden of The Gambia was found unsustainable
according to the export criterion. At that point, analysis showed that even with debt relief
and the continued pursuit of appropriate policies and prudent debt management, the NPV
of debt-to-export ratio was only expected to reach a sustainable level of 148 percent in
2007. The volume of exports was projected to grow at 5.75 percent beyond 2004.

* High case

95. 
The Decision Point scenario has been updated with revised projections for
exports. The revision took into account actual export performance in 2000 and 2001 and
revised export projections in 2002 and beyond, based on new information on the
evolution of prices and volumes of The Gambia's main export products. In 2000 and
2001, exports grew by 9.0 and 10.1 percent, respectively, as a result of sound policies and

- 30 -

record agricultural production. On the other hand, longer term prospects for exports are
lower than originally projected due to the expected decline in world market prices
resulting from the global economic slowdown.

96. 
Figure 4 shows the impact of IDA lending on debt sustainability for low, base,
and high scenarios, as well as for the base scenario from the DP DSA. The current
exercise indicates that compared to the DP DSA projections, the NPV of debt-to-exports
ratio for The Gambia will deteriorate somewhat in the long term due to a decrease in
export projections and an increase in projected lending. The fact that the NPV debt to
exports ratio is projected to reach 176 percent in 2010 suggests that Bank lending can
remain in the base case without having a substantial impact on the debt profile- but that
the debt situation needs to be watched carefully.

Risks and Mitigation

97. 
The Gambia faces continual risk from external shocks as a small economy based
on primary products and subject to irregular rains. This risk can only be addressed by
tryfing to make the economy as robust and diversified as possible, which requires good
governance, an attractive investment climate and good management of public resources.
These are the objectives of the CAS, but there are internal risks which could affect its
success.

98. 
The principal risk for the implementation and effectiveness of this CAS is the
Government's willingness to pursue reform in a sustainable and consistent manner. This
could affect the Government's ability to maintain a stable macro environLment and focus
expenditures on the priority sectors identified in the PRSP. As explained above, there are
significant weaknesses in the process of budget formulation, execution and reporting.
Fiscal deficits grew again in 2002, yet despite increased expenditures, the funding of

- 31 -

priority sectors has not been as strong in recent years as projected. The Government must
thus keep fiscal control in an environment of falling trade revenues and increasing
expenditure demands stemming from the PRSP. IDA will be providing technical
assistance to strengthen expenditure controls and monitoring along with the IMF and
DFID. The Bank will prepare with DFID a CFAA (FY03), which will further define the
agenda for reform in these areas. The CFAA will be followed by a PER (FY04) and a
CPAR (FY05).

99. 
The Government's hesitancy to pursue an open and frank dialogue on divestiture
and infrastructure development is also a risk. The Gambia needs to clarify its objectives
in water, energy, groundnuts, telecommunications and transport, and to indicate that the
Government is willing to conduct the development of these sectors transparently. The
PRSP projects a rate of six percent growth in the coming years. This estimate is realistic
in the context of good policy and normal rains. However, the extent to which the
Government is unable to address growing concerns on key sectors could affect the
country's growth potential. To mitigate this risk, the Bank has included triggers for the
base case which would clarify the Government's vision for the future of its energy and
agricultural sectors. High case triggers that capture a higher level of policy performance
are also included, signaling that the Government was launching important reforms.

100. There are also risks associated with capacity and the governance environment in
The Gambia. Improvements in the investment climate will clearly require judicial reform
which has gotten off to a slow start under the CBEMP; however, there is an
implementation plan in place which should accelerate this work. Other governance
issues have surfaced which may have discouraged foreign investment concessional aid.
The Bank will continue to pursue an open dialogue with the Government about the
importance of addressing these issues in order to increase investment and foreign aid.

Annex 14: IMF-World Bank Relations

(As of December 2002)

PARTNERSHIP IN THE GAMBIA'S DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY

1. 
In April 2002 the Government of The Gambia outlined its development strategy
in a Second Strategy for Poverty Alleviation document (SPA II), also called the Poverty
Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP). The Bank and the Fund Boards endorsed this strategy
in July 2002. The Government intends to fully update the PRSP in 2003. The PRSP sets
out the following five pillars of the Government's strategy: (i) create an enabling policy
environment to promote economic growth and poverty reduction; (ii) enhance the
productive capacity and social protection of the poor and vulnerable; (iii) improve
coverage of the basic social service needs of the poor and vulnerable; (iv) build the
capacity of local communities and civil society organizations to play an active role in the
development process; and (v) mainstream gender equity, environmental issues, nutrition,
governance and HIV/AIDS awareness into all development programs.

2. 
The Fund has supported The Gambia under an arrangement under the Poverty
Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) between June 1998 and December 2001. In July
2002, the IMF Board endorsed the full PRSP and approved a new three-year PRGF
arrangement as well as the use of HIPC interim assistance. The Fund takes the lead in the
policy dialogue on macroeconomic policies and monitors macroeconomic performance
by way of quantitative performance criteria. On the structural side, the program is
focused on tax, budgetary, and financial sector reform and improvements in the
compilation and provision of, household, national accounts and external data. Structural
conditionality under the PRGF arrangement covers areas such as regular publication of
reports on poverty reducing expenditure, elimination of government-public enterprise
cross arrears, conduct of a household and enterprise survey and strengthening of the
customs data system.

3. 
The PRSP and its comprehensive poverty analysis will provide the framework for
the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy planned for Board presentation in early-March
2003. The Bank is currently supporting the implementation of the PRSP in the areas of
health, education, HIV/AIDS, economic management, private sector development
through the implementation of a portfolio of specific projects, as outlined more fully
below.

BANK GROUP STRATEGY AND BANK PORTFOLIO

4. 
The objective of the CAS for the Bank is to support the Government's efforts
through a combination of core diagnostic work and lending.

Assessment of Country Policies
5. 
The core diagnostic work will provide an analytical underpinning and framework
for the reforms proposed in the PRSP, in the following areas: (i) strengthening public
finance management (planned are a Public Expenditure Review (FY04), a Country

- 49 -

Financial Accountability Assessment (FY03) and a Country Procurement Assessment
Report (FY05); (ii) deepening structural reforms, including privatization and regulation
of utilities such as electricity, water, telecommunications and transport (a Development
Policy Review is planned for FY03 and a Private Sector Assessment for FY05); and
(iii) redirecting public investment toward the promotion of human and institutional
capacity and poverty reduction (a study is planned for FY04 to examine issues of
decentralization and civil service reform from a perspective of improving service delivery
in rural areas). In addition, the Bank will support the preparation of a new Household
Survey and Census in 2003, and will work with Government to ensure that an updated
poverty analysis is prepared by FY05.

Lending
6. 
Over the years, the World Bank, through IDA, has assisted the Government in
pursuing four main objectives: (a) establishment of a macroeconomic and sectoral
environment conducive to economic growth; (b) rehabilitation and development of
infrastructure; (c) development of human capital by providing more efficient social
services; and (d) capacity building in departments that have a key role for economic
management. Instruments used in supporting these objectives have been adjustment
lending (first and second structural adjustment credits (SAL I and SAL II), buttressed by
sector-based rehabilitation and investment projects. As of December 31, 2002, IDA had
approved 30 credits for a total amount of about US$271 million, with an undisbursed
amount of about US$65 million.

7. 
The current portfolio consists of six projects in health, education, poverty
alleviation, capacity building for economic management, and private sector, totaling
US$99 million, with an undisbursed amount of about US$65 million (66 percent).

8. 
In health, the Participatory Health/Population/Nutrition operation was approved
in March 1998. It aims at improving the quality of services related to reproductive
health, infant and child health, and nutrition for women of reproductive age, infants, and
children. It also aims at improving the quality of management and implementation of a
family health program. An HIV/AIDS Rapid Response operation was approved in
January 2001. The project aims at (a) containing the HIV/AIDS pandemic; (b) reducing
the spread of the epidemic and mitigating its effects; and (c) increasing access to
prevention services, as well as treatment, care, and support for those infected and affected
by HIV/AIDS.

9. 
In education, the Third Education Sector Project was approved in September 1998
to support the implementation of the second half of the Government's Education Sector
Policy Framework, 1988-2005, and its accompanying investment program.

10. 
A Poverty Alleviation and Municipal Development operation was approved in
March 1999, with the following objectives: (a) to reduce the backlog in public
infrastructure development, and improve the maintenance of public assets; (b) to alleviate
poverty through the creation of temporary jobs and improvements to the selection of
small- and medium-sized investments, which should aim at upgrading the living
environment of the poor; and (c) to strengthen the technical and managerial capacity of

- 50 -

local authorities (with an emphasis on their financial situation), local private firms
(namely, consultants and contractors), and Gamworks (procurement agency).

11. 
A Capacity Buildingfor Economic Management Project was approved in July
2001 to help (a) build government capacity for economic planning, policy formulation,
and execution, and (b) build the capacity of the judicial and financial systems to facilitate
private sector development.

12. 
A Gateway Project was approved in February 2002 to help the country establish
itself as a globally competitive export and processing center by laying the foundation for
expanded private investment export-oriented production and employment, through the
establishment of a Free Zone and an improved institutional environment.

13. 
The IDA lending program for the period FY03-05 will correspond closely to the
priorities established in the PRSP, with operations proposed in education, health and
agriculture for a base case scenario of US$25 million. A second phase of the education
adaptable lending program (APL) will focus on expanding the pilot components tested
under the first phase and on strengthening pre-university training. The follow-up health
project will assist the Government to meet the millennium development goals in health
and nutrition. The new community-driven development project will address rural
development issues such as decentralization, agriculture and possibly credit.

14. 
As of November 30, 2002, the IFC's portfolio has three ongoing operations
totaling US$0.7 million. These are investments under the African Enterprise Facility
(AEF) for a medical clinic (Ndebaan), a poultry producer (KKF) and for commercial
fishery (Lyefish). No new investments have been made since 1997.

15. 
IDA, MIGA, and the IFC will continue to coordinate their respective roles to
support development activities in The Gambia.

Sector Issues
16. 
Evidence of the effectiveness of expenditures in education is encouraging:
teachers are being trained, retention rates for girls have improved thanks to the girls'
education trust fund, and transition rates from primary to secondary education are also
up. Evidence of effective spending in health is anecdotal and comparatively less
promising. Four out of five hospitals are running, but with limited equipment.
Vaccination coverage has decreased, and is supported by HIPC resources. Plans have
been made to implement a management information system to improve monitoring, in the
context of the Participatory Health Population and Nutrition Project (PHPNP).

17. 
Education sector issues include the training of teachers, the containment of
personnel costs, and the improvement in girls' enrollment ratios in primary and
secondary education. In health, child health is key, with an emphasis on preventive
interventions, such as vaccination and adequate nutrition, specifically in the most
vulnerable (rural) areas. However, the health sector is facing difficulties in implementing
certain components of the PHPNP, such as the management information system to
monitor progress. Intrasectoral budget allocations are also an issue, since the

- 51 -

construction of two additional hospitals (bringing the total to five) limit the availability of
resources for primary and secondary health care.

BANK-FUND COLLABORATION IN SPECIC AREAS

18. 
The IMF and the World Bank staff maintain a close working relationship,
especially with respect to (i) implementation of the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper,
(ii) implementation of measures toward the HIPC Completion Point, (iii) analyses and
reforms in public finance management, other governance issues including customs.

19. 
The new PRGF arrangement does not include structural conditionality on (a) the
restructuring and privatization of public enterprises, (b) the procurement code, (c) the
investment code, and (d) the Public Investment Program (PIP), all of which were covered
by structural benchmarks in the earlier PRGF annual arrangements. The Bank has the
lead role in all these areas, and except for item (a), they have been addressed through
legislation, interim codes, and an initial review of the PIP (the current PRGF-supported
program has incorporated quarterly budget targets to eliminate government-public
enterprise cross-arrears). More generally, the new three-year PRGF arrangement has
been refocused to include structural conditionality that is more in the areas where the
Fund takes a lead role and that has a more direct bearing on macroeconomic issues.

20. 
All existing and prospective Bank lending is in investment projects, of which
those in education and health have conditionality that is reflected also in the HIPC
Initiative floating completion triggers.

Annex 16: Debt Sustainability Analysis Update

Summary
Under the Enhanced HIPC Decision Point (DP) in December 2000, The Gambia was to
receive debt relief amounting to US$90 million in nominal terms, and US$67 million in
NPV terms. The relief was expected to come from IDA (US$22.3 million in NPV terms),
IMF (US$2.3 million), AfDB (US$20.6 million) and other creditors. It is currently
receiving assistance from IDA, IMF, AfDB, the EU and the Paris Club. The HIPC
Completion Point is expected to be reached in the second half of 2003.
The current exercise indicates that compared to the DP DSA projections, the NPV of
debt-to-exports ratio for The Gambia will deteriorate somewhat in the long term due to a
decrease in export projections and an increase in projected lending. The fact that the
NPV debt to exports ratio is projected to reach 176 percent in 2010 suggests that Bank
lending can remain in the base case - but that the debt situation needs to be watched
carefully.
This Annex examines the developments in debt sustainability indicators since the
Decision Point.
Main results of the 2000 DP DSA
The DSA showed that at the end of 1999, the total external public debt stock amounted to
about US$452 million. In NPV terms, total debt was estimated at about US$258 million,
equivalent to 59 percent of 1999 GDP, 217 percent of exports of goods and non-factor
services, and 332 percent of government revenue. The Gambia's main creditors were
multilateral, accounting for 70 percent of debt in NPV terms, with 32 percent owed to
IDA, 22 percent to the AfDB and 3 percent to the IMF. Bilateral creditors accounted for
the remaining 30 percent of its debt, of which one third was due to Paris Club and two
thirds to non-Paris Club creditors. 8
The debt burden of The Gambia was found unsustainable according to the export
criterion and it qualified to seek enhanced HIPC assistance through the export window.
After the full use of traditional debt relief mechanisms, The Gambia's NPV of debt-to-
exports ratio was 206 percent in 1999 and 207 percent in 2000, exceeding the enhanced
HIPC target for the net present value of debt-to-exports ratio of 150 percent. HIPC
assistance was to be US$66.6 million in NPV terms (not including traditional debt relief),
where US$49.2 million would come from multilateral creditors and US$17.4 million
from bilateral creditors, with IDA providing one-third of total relief
The baseline scenario of the DSA for the balance of payments and debt outlook assumed
the continuation of sound economic and financial policies. Given the implementation of
structural reforms in the agricultural and external sectors, the volume of exports was
projected to grow at 5% percent and import volumes at about 51/2 percent beyond 2004.

8 Under the enhanced HIPC Initiative, the DSA was to be based on the country's stock of debt after the full
application of traditional debt relief mechanisms at the Decision Point. In the case of The Gambia, this
implies adjusting the 1999 NPV debt stock by (i) a stock-of-debt operation under Naples terms (67 percent
NPV reduction on eligible debt) and a topping up of all previously rescheduled loans; and (ii) a comparable
treatment from non-Paris Club creditors. Under these assumptions, the NPV of the external debt as of end
1999 would be reduced by about 5 percent to US$245 million.

- 54 -

Developments during 2000-02
During 2000 to 2002, The Gambia received interim debt relief from IDA, IMF, AfDB,
EU and Paris Club. The HIPC Completion Point is expected to be reached in the second
half of 2003.
The Decision Point scenario has been updated with revised projections for new lending
and exports. With regards in exports, the revision took into account actual export
performance in 2000 and 2001 and revised export projection in 2002 and beyond, based
on new information on the evolution of prices and volume of The Gambia's main export
products. In 2000 and 2001, exports grew by 9.0 and 10.1 percent respectively, and it is
estimated to have grown by 8.4 percent in 2002. These numbers are higher than the
projections in the DP DSA. High export growth was the result of sound economic
policies combined with record agricultural production benefiting from favorable weather
conditions. On the other hand, longer term prospects for exports are lower than originally
projected due to the expected decline in world market prices resulting from the global
economic slowdown. The debt projections are highly sensitive to assumptions about
export growth.
As a result of the update, projected NPV debt-to-exports ratio is higher than originally
estimated in the DP DSA for most of the projection period from 2003 to 2019, reaching a
peak of 176.0 percent versus 128.2 percent in the DP DSA for 2011 (see Table below),
and staying above 150 percent during the period 2003 to 2014. For that period, the
difference between the original DSA and the update is attributed to the combination of
lower export projections and higher projection for IDA and AfDB disbursements, as well
as significant borrowing from Taiwan, China (more than US$30 million during 200 1-
2003). The NPV of new lending accumulated during 2000 to 2005 is projected at
US$113.7 million or about 69 percent more than US$67.4 million in the DP DSA. The
increase in lending partly reflects greater confidence among donors that the country is
pursuing sound economic policies as a result of the PRSP process. At the same time,
export projections are adjusted downward from US$181.9 million to US$176.7 million,
bringing the NPV of debt-to-exports ratio up from 140.8 percent to 171.6 percent in
2005.
The difference between the projections of the original DP DSA and the present update
becomes smaller towards the end of the projection period. In 2019, the revised estimate
of the new debt stands at US$312.3 million, or only 13 percent more than the original
US$276.6 million, which, together with the lower exports, brings the NPV of debt-to-
exports ratio up from 108 percent to 122 percent. Details of the base scenario are
presented in the table below alongside with the DP original projections.
The current update projects a "hump" in NPV of debt-to-exports ratio, where for a
number of years the ratio exceeds 150 percent. The fact that the NPV debt to exports
ratio is projected to reach 176 percent in 2010 suggests that Bank lending can remain in
the base case - but that the debt situation needs to be watched carefully: the average
NPV of debt-to-exports ratio stands at 167.2 percent during 2000 to 2009, and then
decreases to 151.7 percent during 2010 to 2019.
Sensitivity analysis
The three CAS scenarios of IDA disbursements were simulated: base, high and low. The
Gambia has an IDA allocation of SDR 19 million or approximately US$25 million over
the CAS period, and this is the amount programmned in the base case scenario. In

- 55 -

addition, the CAS proposes a low case of US$10 million and a high case of US$37
million. Triggers for the base and high cases encompass satisfactory IDA portfolio
management, implementation of the PRSP, and progress in governance, infrastructure,
rural development, and the health and education sectors. Projected IDA disbursements
during the period 2003 to 2005 are the following:

The resulting differences in the NPV of the debt-to-exports ratio amnong the three
scenarios were within a relatively small range. In particular, for 2005 the NPV of debt-
to-exports ratio was projected to be within the range of 170.9 to 172.2 percent for low
and high scenarios, with the range somewhat increasing to 173.9 to 178.0 percent in
2010, and to 112.6 to 123.9 percent in 2019.
Figure 1 shows the impact of IDA lending on debt sustainability for low, base, and high
scenarios, as well as for the base scenario from the DP DSA. Starting from 2002
onwards all three scenarios assume higher NPV of debt-to-exports ratios than the base
scenario from the DP DSA.
