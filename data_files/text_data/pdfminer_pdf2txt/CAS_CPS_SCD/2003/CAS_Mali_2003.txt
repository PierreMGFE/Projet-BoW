EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

1. 
M a l i i s one o f the poorest countries in the w o r l d due t o i t s limited resource base, land- 
l o c k e d status, vu lne rab i l i ty t o external shocks, p o o r infrastructure, l o w leve ls o f human 
development and weak adm in is t ra t ive capacity. D e s p i t e these constraints, M a l i has made 
commendable progress o n the economic, p o l i t i c a l and soc ia l f ron ts ove r the past decade. 
A n n u a l rea l g r ow t h rates f o r 1994-2002 averaged about 5 percent. The p r iva te sector i s 
inc reas ing ly playing a m u c h larger ro le in the economy, and c i v i l society and stakeholders 
are strengthening partnerships with Government with greater respons ib i l i ty f o r development 
ac t iv i t ies . M a l i has also recorded impo r tan t imp rovemen ts in ce r ta in soc ia l ind ica to rs since 
the mid- 1990s w h i c h indicates that i t shou ld make progress towa rds mee t ing some o f the 
M i l l e n n i u m Deve lopmen t Goals (MDGs). 

2. 
In pa ra l le l with this progress, M a l i achieved a rema rkab le p o l i t i c a l t rans fo rma t ion 
with an inc reas ing ly strong democratic process t a k i n g r o o t th roughou t the 1990s, cu lm ina t ing 
in the peace fu l transfer o f p ow e r between t w o democ ra t ica l ly elected leaders in 2002. This 
has p laced M a l i in the fo re f ron t o f A f r i c a n countries m o v i n g t o a truly democratic and 
p lu ra l is t ic p o l i t i c a l system and p rov ides a strong p l a t f o rm f o r pushing f o rw a r d o n further 
economic and ins t i tu t iona l re fo rms under the leadership o f a comm i t ted Government. While 
governance, capac i ty and ins t i tu t ions s t i l l need strengthening, the ove ra l l f ramewo rk f o r a 
more effective, transparent and decentralized adm in is t ra t ion i s g radua l ly t a k i n g shape.

Board Discussion. The f o l l ow i n g i s s u e s are suggested f o r B o a r d discussion: 
I s the p roposed p rog ram an appropriate support t o the imp lemen ta t ion o f M a l i ’ s 
PRSP? 
I s the p roposed approach t o p rog ramma t ic l e n d i n g and PRSCs suitable? 
Are the triggers app l ied t o the C A S f o r the base, high and l o w cases appropriate? 
Does the C A S identify su f f ic ien t m i t i g a t i n g measures t o address the risks, 
i n c l u d i n g the risk posed by the impac ts o f the c r is is in C6 te d ’ Ivo i re?

PRSP. M a l i recen t ly f ina l ized i t s Pove r ty Reduc t ion Strategy Paper (PRSP) w h i c h 
lays ou t a comprehensive strategy f o r fighting pove r ty and p rov ides a cohesive f ramewo rk 
f o r a l l donors and deve lopmen t partners. The i s s u e o f sustained and equitable g r ow t h i s the 
cornerstone o f the PRSP. D e s p i t e ach iev ing s t rong average g r ow t h rates since 1994, the re i s 
a considerable degree o f f luc tua t ion in the annual g r ow t h rates, e.g. the g r ow t h rate i s 
estimated t o d rop f r o m 9.7 percent in 2002 t o -1.1 percent in 2003. This i s a r e s u l t o f the 
economy’s v u l n e r a b i l i t y t o external factors such as un favo rab le c l ima t ic conditions, t e r m s o f 
trade shocks and reco rd l o w p r ices in the co t ton sector due t o co t ton subsidies in the US and 
Europe. In a d d i t i o n t o these t rad i t iona l vulnerabilities, M a l i ’ s economy in 2002-3 was 
severely a f fec ted by the c r is is in ne ighbo r ing CGte d ’ Ivo i re w h i c h disrupted transport, trade, 
investment and p r iva te sector ac t iv i ty in the western A f r i c a reg ion . Con t inued strong support 
f r om the in te rna t iona l c omm u n i t y i s needed t o help M a l i manage these external shocks, 
sustain robus t g r ow t h and make progress o n ach iev ing the PRSP goals and the M D G s . 

5 . 

The implementation o f the Bank’s FY99-01 CAS has been satisfactory as M a l i 
fulfilled nea r ly a l l o f the triggers in the base case scenario and mos t o f the triggers in the high 
case scenario. T h e C A S focused o n supporting stable economic g r ow t h and sustainable 
human development. The B a n k supported M a l i ’ s macroeconomic stabilization, economic 

- i v - 

l ibe ra l iza t ion and structural re fo rms and invested in economic d ive rs i f ica t ion and 
infrastructure, pa r t icu la r ly in the r u r a l sector. These in te rven t ions con t r ibu ted t o the strong 
economic g r ow t h ra tes since 1998. At t h e same time, the B a n k provided f inanc ia l and 
techn ica l support t o the hea l th and educa t ion programs in M a l i w h i c h fac i l i ta ted the 
imp rovemen t in some social indicators. Mo reove r , during the p rev ious C A S period, M a l i 
reached the Comp le t ion Po in ts o f the O r i g i n a l and Enhanced H I P C In i t ia t ives in September 
2002 and M a r c h 2003, respectively. The debt r e l i e f p r o v i d e d under the Enhanced H I P C 
I n i t i a t i v e was su f f ic ien t t o a l l ow the debt sus ta inab i l i ty r a t i o t o d rop t o a n acceptable l e v e l . 

6. 
Objectives. The progress achieved t o date and the con t inued r e f o rm p rog ram 
ou t l ined in the PRSP p rov ide an exce l len t starting p o i n t f o r the Bank ’s C A S f o r FY04 -06 . 
The C A S i s fully a l igned with the PRSP and selectively focuses o n t h r e e m a i n themes w h i c h 
d i rec t ly support the PRSP p i l la rs : (i) p r om o t i n g growth; (ii) deve lop ing h um a n resources; 
and (iii) p u b l i c finance management and governance. The C A S combines a mix o f B a n k 
instruments inc lud ing : (i) p rog ramma t ic support ( th rough S W A P s and PRSCs); 
(ii) commun i ty driven development operations; (iii) specific lending operations tha t target 
the g r ow t h ob jec t ive and support necessary infrastructure; and (iv) a w ide - rang ing AAA 
p rog ram w h i c h i s focused o n building the know ledge base f o r the three m a i n themes. In 
particular, the C A S concentrates o n capacity building and strengthening the f ramewo rk f o r 
p rog ramma t ic support t o M a l i : firstly, t o strengthen the sector-wide approaches in the social 
sectors and, m o v i n g o n f r o m there, t o f ina l ize the necessary core diagnostic w o r k and 
establish the appropriate f ramewo rk f o r a full m o v e t o PRSCs. 

7. 

Lending Scenarios. M a l i i s cu r ren t ly in the base case. The base-case scenario 
allocates up t o US$390 m i l l i o n , o f w h i c h up t o 29 percent c o u l d be in the f o r m o f IDA grants 
during IDA- 13. This scenario i s predicated o n con t inued good mac roeconom ic performance, 
satisfactory imp lemen ta t ion o f the PRSP , progress o n strengthening governance and strong 
p o r t f o l i o performance. Lending c o u l d increase t o US$462 m i l l i o n under the high-case 
scenario i f the re i s accelerated progress o n these criteria. I t i s possible f o r M a l i t o reach the 
high case given: (i) i t s strong t rack reco rd in implementing macroeconomic and s t ruc tu ra l 
reforms; (ii) tha t the PRSP p rov ides a m o r e comprehensive and cohesive f ramewo rk than in 
the past, focus ing o n outcomes and the MDGs; and (iii) that progress o n key sectors - such 
as hea l th and education - has been strong since 1998 , p r o v i d i n g a so l id p l a t f o rm f o r 
con t inued good performance and achievement o f PRSP targets, pa r t icu la r ly with stronger 
p rog ramma t ic support f r o m donors in the years ahead. 

8 . 
Risks. The imp lemen ta t ion o f the C A S faces several risks: (i) na tu ra l r i s k s f r o m 
adverse c l ima t ic cond i t ions w h i c h in f luence ag r icu l tu ra l output; (ii) v o l a t i l i t y o f c omm o d i t y 
prices, exacerbated by ag r icu l tu ra l subsidies in the indus t r ia l ized countries; (iii) unce r ta in 
ex te rna l assistance; (iv) con t inued negative impac ts o f the CBte d ’ Ivo i re crisis; and (v) weak 
capacity. The B a n k w i l l take a l l necessary s teps described in the C A S t o help m i t iga te these 
r i s k s . 

9 . 
Measuring Results. The C A S focuses o n defining and measuring r e s u l t s in the 
framework o f t h e ove ra l l m o n i t o r i n g and eva lua t ion o f the PRSP. The C A S measurable 
ind ica to rs are the PRSP targets f o r 2006 w h i c h focus o n making progress towa rds the MDGs. 
In pa ra l le l with the annual PRSP Progress Reports and re la ted JSAs, the B a n k w i l l assess the 
achievements o f the CAS . 

I. 

INTRODUCT ION 

1. 
The last t e n years have witnessed s ign i f ican t economic and p o l i t i c a l change in M a l i . 
Since 1994, economic g r ow t h rates have averaged mo re than 5 percent. This strong 
performance was the r e s u l t o f a se r ies o f macroeconomic stabilization, economic 
l ibe ra l iza t ion and structural re fo rms that were supported by the W o r l d Bank, IMF and other 
donors. The comprehensive r e f o rm p rog ram has t rans fo rmed M a l i ’ s economy i n t o a ma rke t - 
o r ien ted one where the p r iva te sector i s p l a y i n g an inc reas ing ly impo r tan t role, thus l a y i n g a 
mo re so l id founda t ion f o r accelerated g row th . 

2. 
In pa ra l le l with the pos i t ive economic developments, the p o l i t i c a l landscape in M a l i 
has also been transformed. In 1991, the 23-year d ic ta to rsh ip o f General Moussa TraorC was 
ove r th rown and President Kona re was democ ra t ica l ly elected a year later. Since then, M a l i 
has been characterized by a n inc reas ing ly stable democracy, cu lm ina t ing in the 2002 
elections w o n by President TourC. This peaceful transfer o f p ow e r between t w o 
democ ra t ica l ly elected leaders was a f i r s t in M a l i ’ s h is to ry and places M a l i in the fo re f ron t o f 
A f r i c a n countries m o v i n g t o a truly democratic and p lu ra l is t ic p o l i t i c a l system. 

3. 
No tw i ths tand ing this progress, M a l i remains one o f the poorest countries in the w o r l d 
and i s ranked 164 ou t o f 173 countries in the 2002 U N D P H u m a n Deve lopmen t Index . The 
country’s limited resource base, land - locked status, vulnerability t o ex te rna l shocks, under- 
developed infrastructure, l o w l e v e l s o f human development and weak adm in is t ra t ive capacity 
combine t o create d i f f i c u l t soc ia l and economic conditions. In 2001,63.8 percent o f the 
popu la t ion was estimated t o be l iv ing in pove r ty . Between 75 and 80 percent o f M a l i ’ s 
popu la t ion o f 1 1.3 m i l l i o n l i v e s in r u r a l areas and i s dependent o n ag r icu l tu re . The economy 
i s vulnerable t o recurrent drought, p o o r env i ronmen ta l cond i t ions and large f luc tua t ions in 
in te rna t iona l c omm o d i t y prices. Howeve r , while M a l i ’ s soc ia l ind ica to rs r em a i n among the 
poorest in the wo r ld , some are show ing progress, pa r t icu la r ly since 1998 (see Tab le 1). 
Building on and strengthening this progress w i l l be c r i t i c a l f o r M a l i as i t faces m a j o r 
challenges in ach iev ing the Millennium Deve lopmen t Goals (see A t tachmen t 1 f o r details). 

4. 
M a l i reached the C om p l e t i o n Po in ts o f the O r i g i n a l and Enhanced H I P C In i t ia t ives in 
September 2000 and M a r c h 2003, respectively. The debt r e l i e f p r o v i d e d t o M a l i under the 
Enhanced H I P C I n i t i a t i v e was su f f ic ien t t o a l l ow the debt sus ta inab i l i ty r a t i o t o d rop t o an 
acceptable l e v e l . In M a y 2002, the Gove rnmen t adopted the Pove r ty R e d u c t i o n Strategy 
Paper (PRSP) w h i c h lays ou t a comprehensive strategy f o r fighting pove r ty and p rov ides a 
strong and cohesive f ramewo rk f o r a l l donors and development partners. The Bank ’s F Y 0 4 - 
06 Coun t ry Assistance Strategy (CAS ) i s designed t o support the PRSP. The Bank’s strategy 
builds o n the lessons lea rn t from implementing the previous C A S and i s based o n the 
outcome o f a one-year consu l ta t ive process with representatives from cen t ra l and l o c a l 
Government, c i v i l society, private sector, non -gove rnmen ta l organizations (NGOs) and other 
development partners. The PRSP, with the support o f the Bank ’s CAS , p rov ides a so l id 
f ramewo rk f o r m o v i n g towa rds ach iev ing the MDGs.

COUNTRY DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM AND PROSPECTS 

A. 

The Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) 

5 . 

The PRSP was adopted by the p rev ious Gove rnmen t in M a y 2002 and then 
recon f i rmed by the new Government (GoM ) in October 2002. The ove ra l l macroeconomic 
f ramewo rk was then updated t o take i n t o account the impac ts o f the C8te d ’ Ivo i re crisis and 
was endorsed by the B r e t t o n Woods ins t i tu t ions in M a r c h 2003. The strategic axes o f the 
PRSP are as fo l lows : 

e 

e 

e 

e 

Pre-Requisite Pillar: Accelerated and Re-Distributive Growth. The g r ow t h ob jec t ive 

i s the cornerstone o f the PRSP and must be su f f ic ien t ly robus t t o ensure successful 
imp lemen ta t ion o f the PRSP. T o achieve growth, the G o M a ims t o continue 
macroeconomic and structural re fo rms and t o fac i l i ta te the d ive rs i f ica t ion o f p roduc t ion 
and exports th rough strengthening the suppo r t ing f ramewo rk f o r development o f the 
p r iva te sector as the prime engine o f economic g row th . 

Pillar 1: Promote institutional development while improving governance and 

participation. Within a con tex t o f decentralization, the G o M a ims t o re in fo rce 
ins t i tu t iona l capabilities, imp rove p u b l i c sector management th rough mode rn iza t ion and 
re fo rm , comba t co r rup t ion , strengthen the r u l e o f l a w and the j u d i c i a r y system, and 
re in fo rce c i v i l society. 

Pillar 2: Develop human resources and improve access to quality basic services. 

The strategy concentrates n o t o n l y o n improved, decentralized hea l th ( inc lud ing 
popu la t ion and nu t r i t ion ) and education service de l ive ry , but also o n complementary

The G o M translated the ambitious p rog ram l a i d o u t in the PRSP i n t o t h e 2003-2005

effects o f p o v e r t y o n hea l th and education. G r ow t h i s the under-pinning o f the PRSP and the

Assessment of the PRSP. The PRSP p rov ides an ove ra l l credible pove r ty reduc t ion 
strategy. A c c o r d i n g t o the Jo in t S ta f f Assessmen t (JSA), the f o l l ow i n g are the strongest 
areas o f the PRSP: (i) the consultative and pa r t ic ipa to ry process, no tw i ths tand ing the large 
size o f the coun t ry and i t s thinly spread popu la t ion (see B o x 1); (ii) the pove r ty analysis,

despite the limited ava i lab i l i ty o f data; (iii) the comprehensiveness o f the strategy and i t s 
focus o n macroeconomic stability, high and sustainable growth, human development, the 
strengthening o f access t o basic social services, private sector development and good 
governance; (iv) the e f fo r ts t o d r aw up a long - te rm strategic v i s i o n consistent with sectoral 
strategies; and (v) the attempt t o cost the strategy. The PRSP also makes a no tab le 
assessment o f the risks associated with the imp lemen ta t ion o f the strategy, i n c l u d i n g M a l i ’ s 
vulnerability t o exogenous shocks. 

Box 1: The Participatory Process Dur ing the Preparation o f the PRSP 

The PRSP clearly lays out the process followed in its preparation, which has drawn from and built upon a 
tradition o f implementing consensus-based policies and debating major issues and strategies. Consultation 
activities for the formulation o f the PRSP included two notable elements. First, eleven thematic discussion 
and working groups were established under an overall National Technical Committee. Second, consultations 
on the draft PRSP were held at the national level, in each o f the eight regions, and in the district o f Bamako. 
This approach resulted in the identification and inclusion in the PRSP o f the major development constraints 
and strengths o f each region, the consideration o f certain specific regional issues in PRSP projects and 
programs, the buy-in to the PRSP process by regional and l o c a l actors, and the establishment o f regional and 
l o c a l committees to steer and implement the PRSP. However, hrther work i s required to mainstream 
participation and consensus building in the management o f public affairs and to strengthen and sustain the 
dialogue with the poor during the consultation process. Development partners also played a key role in this 
process, notably the UNDP, the European Commission, the Netherlands, Canada, USAID, Sweden, and

Belgium.

The JSA no ted a number o f areas where the PRSP c o u l d be imp roved . First, the re i s 
a need t o deepen the p o l i c y analysis once the expenditure data f r om the 2001 househo ld 
survey becomes available in 2003 (see B o x 2). Second, while the re i s a comprehensive 
coverage o f the development challenges, the re i s a l a c k o f p r i o r i t i z a t i o n in o u t l i n i n g them. 
The G o M i s beginning t o p r io r i t ize , as exemplified by the f ramewo rk l e t t e r in t roduced by the 
President t o the G o M in October 2002, where employment, health, education, and inc reas ing 
pu rchas ing p ow e r were ind ica ted as M a l i ’ s t o p fou r p r io r i t ies . Third, the G o M needs t o 
ensu re that components o f a l l existing sector strategies are adequately re f lec ted in the PRSP 
(no tab ly those f o r transport, drinking water supply and sanitation, u rban development, and 
so i l fertility). Fourth, the re i s a need t o re in fo rce and build u p o n existing mechanisms t o 
m o n i t o r and evaluate strategy imp lemen ta t ion and outcomes. Finally, the PRSP proposes a 
widening o f the economic base t o better w i ths tand external shocks (climate, reg iona l 
ins tab i l i ty , in te rna t iona l commod i ty prices) and emphasizes that g r ow t h shou ld be driven by 
the p r iva te sector with a strong fo re ign investment focus. I t i s c r i t ica l f o r M a l i t o develop

Box 2: Poverty, Social Indicators and the MDGs 
W h i l e the income indicator data o f the 2001 survey have no t been h l l y aggregated and analyzed, it i s expected 
:hat thepoverty level on an income basis w i l l be less than the 70 percent recorded in 1996: this reduction i s 
:xpected as a result o f the strong average real GDP growth rate o f 5% since the 1994 devaluation. According 
:o an access-to-services index constructed from the 2001 household survey data, 63.8% o f the population were 
:stimated to be living in poverty in 2001. On this basis, poverty affects 75.9% o f the rural population, versus 
m l y 30.1% o f the urban population. Poverty levels are the lowest in Bamako with only 28.6% o f the 
population considered poor, while the highest levels are in Kidal with 92.8% o f the residents being poor. I n 
terms o f poverty depth, the region o f Mopti has the highest rate o f 53.1% while Bamako has the lowest o f 
14.8%. 
Gender Issues and Poverty. Gender analysis o f poverty reveals a strong interconnection o f the status and 
Dpportunities available to women and overall poverty. For example, maternal and child mortality rates 
significantly drop with the rise in the level o f the mother’s education; the more educated mother i s also more 
aware o f contraception possibilities. According t o a 1997 survey led by the Observatory for Employment and 
rraining, women make up 65% o f the informal sector but only 32.75% o f the formal sector. While a full 
gender analysis does not yet exist fo r employment, according t o the 2001 Demographic and Health Survey, 
40% o f women (aged 15 to 49) work i n agriculture, o f whom only 58% are paid fo r their work. For the 
remaining 60% who do not work in agriculture, only 8% are not paid for their work. 
Health and education indicators in Ma l i , despite improvements, are among the lowest i n the world with a 
significant disparity between rural and urban areas as demonstrated by the access-to-services index described 
above. Fewer rural children attend school, notably fewer girls, and rural infant and child mortality rates are 
significantly higher than in urban areas. The poor are l e s s likely to use health services, particularly the rural 
poor, and tend t o spend proportionately l e s s on health care. The 2001 Demographic and Health Survey 
confirms that health behaviors are influenced by the mother’s education level and access to basic services and 
information. 
Mali i s expected to face a major challenge in achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) as there 
i s (i) weak capacity in delivering basic services; ( i i) poor cross-sectoral integration o f activities; and (iii) long 
delays in carrying out policy reforms. As shown in Attachment 1, there i s a lack o f baseline data for many 
goals. Achievement o f the goals, however, i s further complicated by the lack o f an integrated strategy to do 
so, reflecting the multisectoral aspect o f reaching MDGs. For example, the 2001 Demographic and Health 
Survey revealed that health conditions are tightly related to factors outside o f the health sector, such as 
monetary income. However, the PRSP treats such issues as child mortality as a health issue. Despite these 
constraints, there has been an important positive trend since 1997/98 in improving certain health and education 
indicators as shown in Table 1.

Box 2: Poverty, Soc ia l Indicators and the MDGs (cont’d) 

The 2002 PRSP concentrates on developing basic soc ia l services (Le. primary school education, basic health 
infrastructure) which would set the foundations for a solid development framework. At the same time, the 
Ministry o f Health staff acknowledged the need for the multi-sectoral approach and e f f o r t s are intensifying 
toward articulating such an approach and the accompanying institutional mechanisms to support it. I t i s 
expected that once more o f the framework i s in place, progress w i l l accelerate. Therefore, while M a l i i s unlikely 
to reach many o f the MDGs by 201 5 , i t still may achieve several, notably education enrollment rates, 
particularly as M a l i i s eligible for the Education-For-All (EFA ) initiative. With resource constraints being 
lifted as a result o f additional external support under EFA, the challenge w i l l be to reinforce the capacity and 
enabling administrative environment to successfully implement the GoM’s strategy and use available resources 
to reach the MDGs. 
The environmental and sanitation MDGs also w i l l need considerable attention from the GoM to make progress. 
Increasing population pressures and urbanization w i l l lead t o large additional investment needs for water supply 
facilities and require increased attention to environmental issues t o ensure that M a l i ’ s development remains 
sustainable. 
Mali needs to produce reliable, robust and current statistics in order to monitor progress towards the MDGs. The 
establishment o f an effective Monitoring & Evaluation framework i s a core focus o f the Bank’s and donors’ 
work in the context o f their support to the PRSP.

The PRSP was prepared after a decade-long pe r iod o f g row th and good macro- 
economic performance. Despite a number o f adverse shocks, real GDP g row th has averaged 
about 5 pe rcen t per annum between 1994-2002, enabling real per capita GDP to r i s e b y 2.5 
percent per year. The G o M has been successful at limiting in f la t ion to single-digit figures 
and re in ing in the fiscal de f ic i t in line with the convergence obligations under the West 
A f r ican Economic and Monetary U n i o n (WAEMU) regional integration agreement. M a l i 
also made good progress o n revenue generation with revenues reaching more than 17% o f 
GDP (well above the Sub-Saharan A f r i c a average).

M a l i ’ s economic performance remains fragile in view o f the economy’s vu lne rab i l i ty

The share o f manu fac tu r ing in GDP and exports has been limited, due to l o w p roduc t iv i ty ,

M a l i ’ s macroeconomic pe r fo rmance can be a t t r ibu ted t o the e f fec t ive imp lemen ta t ion 
o f macroeconomic s tab i l iza t ion and economic l ibe ra l iza t ion po l ic ies since the 1994 
deva lua t ion o f the C F A franc w h i c h created the foundations o f a ma rke t - led economy and 
encouraged p r iva te sector development. Recent economic developments have been 
influenced, however, by weak performance o f the country’s co t ton sector (see B o x 3). The 
sector, w h i c h achieved impressive g r ow t h and s ign i f ican t gains in the w o r l d expo r t ma rke t 
share f o l l ow i n g the 1994 devaluation, experienced a severe f inanc ia l and s t ruc tu ra l c r is is in

emergence o f g o l d as M a l i ’ s lead ing expo r t p roduc t since 1999 has fo r tuna te ly helped 
m i t iga te some o f the negative impac t o f the co t ton sector crisis.

S ign i f ican t ma rke t re fo rms have been achieved during the 1990s, beg inn ing with the

comprehensive tax r e f o rm p rog ram with Canadian assistance, i n c l u d i n g in t roduc t ion o f the

these changes w h i c h re in fo rced the s ign i f ican t pos i t ive g r ow t h trend emanating f r o m the 
1994 devaluation. The comb ined e f fec t o f these po l ic ies has created the foundations o f a 
ma rke t - led economy and encouraged p r iva te sector development. 

Go ld and cotton together comprise over 80 percent o f export earnings, while livestock - exported pr imar i ly to West A f r ica 
regional markets - accounts for about 8 percent o f export earnings. Cotton has historically been the number one export 
earner ahead o f gold, although go ld has only recently surpassed cotton export revenues and today accounts for about 5 5

Bo x 3: The Cotton Sector and the Reform Program 

Cotton production in M a l i has expanded remarkably in the years fo l low ing the devaluation o f the CFA Franc 
in 1994, from 293,021 tons o f seed cotton in 1994/95 t o 522,903 tons in 199811999 and 459,123 tons in 
1999/2000. In the 1990s, M a l i became the first exporter o f cotton lint in Sub-Saharan A fr ica . However, from 
1999 to 2001, the sector experienced a severe financial c r is is , due in part to the f a l l in wo r ld cotton prices and 
also to weak management o f CMDT , the cotton parastatal company. The c r i s i s took a dramatic turn in June 
2000 w i t h the decision o f a large number o f farmers to boycott cotton cu l t iva t ion for the 2000/2001 cropping 
season due to the fact that CM D T was offering a relatively l ow price for seed cotton because o f i t s financial 
difficulties. As a result, production for 2000/2001 decreased to 241,000 tons o f seed cotton, i .e . barely more 
than h a l f the production o f the previous year. 

W i th the support o f the Wo r ld Bank, the G oM prepared and adopted a comprehensive restructuring plan for 
the cotton sector. This plan was approved in October 2001 and spells out the long-term v is ion f o r a 
competitive model for the sector and the structural changes needed to make the transition f rom the monopsony 
organization and restore the sector’s profitability, sustainability and competitiveness. I t includes: (i) the 
downsizing o f CMDT , as we l l as structural reforms to change the sector’s organization; (ii) disengaging the 
state and invo lv ing the private sector and farmers associations; (iii) breaking up the monopoly into regional 
e n t i t i e s through the sale o f agro-industrial assets to private operators; and (iv) liberalizing seed and o i l trade 
through, in ter a l i a , privatization o f the o i l seed company. The G oM established a unit, the M i s s i o n de 
Res t ruc tu ra t ion du Secteur Co ton (MRSC), reporting directly to the Prime Minister, to manage the 
implementation o f the restructuring plan. The reform program i s supported b y the Bank’s Th ird Structural 
Adjusfment Credit (SAC-3): the latest supervision o f the SAC-3 indicated that the cotton sector reforms are 
broadly on track. 

As far as the next stages o f the reform process are concerned, the MRSC and the G oM indicated that it i s 
preparing a comprehensive p lan to lead t o the full pr iva t iza t iod l ibera l iza t ion o f the sector b y 2005/2006, as 
foreseen in the letter o f sector po l icy development. This plan would comprise: (i) the f u l l privatization o f 
CMDT i n the next 12 to 1 8 months (ii) the f u l l liberalization o f the sector over a 3-4 year transition period, 
allowing for several key functions to be progressively and s a f e l y transferred to the private sector and farmers 
organizations; and (iii) continued and increased support to institutional and capacity-building activities. 

A t the same time as M a l i has been making commendable progress on cotton sector reform, the world cotton 
industry i s suffering through one o f its most pa in fu l periods for producers in developing countries. Average 
international cotton prices l a s t season were the lowest since 1972-73 and, when adjusted for inflation, rank as 
the lowest in history, ha lv ing the incomes o f many developing country cotton producers. Subsidies to 
agricultural producers in the Un i ted States and the European Union are the single biggest force dr iv ing down 
world prices and Sub-Saharan A fr ica i s most deeply affected. The cotton farmers o f western and cen tra l 
Africa are among the lowest cost producers in the world. Yet, despite this comparative advantage, the cotton 
industry i n A f r ica i s losing wor ld market share and cotton farmers are fa l l ing further into poverty. 

- 8 - 

Box 3: The Cotton Sec to r and the Reform Program (cont’d) 

According to analysis conducted jointly by the World Bank, the IMF and the International Cotton Advisory 
Committee, cotton producers in developing countries face annual losses o f about US$9.5 b i l l ion as a result o f 
subsidies benefiting rich countries. Total losses to developing country producers have amounted to US$23 
b i l l ion over the past four years. Removal o f direct subsidies worldwide would have a net positive effect o f 3 1 
cents per pound on average international co t ton prices. Despite the successful efforts o f the cotton industry to 
expand the demand for cotton, which w i l l reach a record in 2002-2003, and despite an expected reduction o f 
supply and higher economic growth in major economies, excess production w i l l continue to affect prices in 
international markets and cotton prices are expected to remain well below the long-run average for the next 
several years.

B a s e - L i n e Scena r io . The macroeconomic f ramewo rk presented in t h e PRSP was 
revised by the authorities late in 2002 and the medium-term p ro jec t ions were adjusted 
acco rd ing ly . The 2003 g r ow t h rate has been revised downwa rd t o -1.1 percent. G r ow t h i s 
expected t o rebound in 2004 (see A n n e x l), and t o average 3.5 percent a year ove r the 
p e r i o d 2003-05 as against 5.0 percent a year over the p e r i o d 1994-2002. Po ten t ia l sources o f

Underpinning the p ro jec t ions f o r g r ow t h i s the assumption that M a l i w i l l be able t o 
attract fo re ign savings, i n c l u d i n g p r iva te capital, t o supplement domestic saving. Gross 
domestic saving w o u l d r em a i n at a h is to r ica l ly high l e v e l over the next few years, p a r t l y as a

This p o l i c y aims at inc reas ing pove r ty - reduc ing expenditures while l ow e r i n g the basic f isca l

2003, with tax revenue rising by 1.6 percentage po in ts o f GDP t o 15.8%. A b o u t one - th i rd o f

the tax system, simplifying i t f o r smaller en te rp r ises , and increasing the e f f ic iency o f the tax 
administration. T o reduce shortfalls in the m o b i l i z a t i o n o f domestic resources, the G o M w i l l 
ensure the strict app l ica t ion o f laws and regulations gove rn ing t h e g ran t ing o f tax exemptions

PRSP P i l la r 1: Promote Institutional Development While Imp rov ing 
Governance and Participation 

2 1. 
The 2002 elections s o l i d i f i e d the democratic process in M a l i , and the fo rma t ion o f a 
mu l t i -pa r ty Gove rnmen t in October 2002 p rov ided a strong p l a t f o rm t o push fo rwa rd o n 
further ins t i tu t iona l r e f o rm under the leadership o f President TourC. During the G oM ’ s f i r s t 
C o u n c i l o f Ministers meeting, President TourC challenged a l l M i n i s t e r s t o implement a 
results-oriented deve lopmen t p o l i c y based on the PRSP and he emphasized that 
strengthening governance w o u l d be his top p r i o r i t y . This c o n f i rm e d recogn i t ion tha t M a l i 
had been m a k i n g impo r tan t s tr ides in im p r o v i n g governance and r e f o rm i n g ins t i tu t ions in the 
past and, with the adop t ion o f the PRSP, this was again p laced at center-stage. 

22. 
The challenge l a i d d o w n by the President i s amb i t ious as the M a l i a n adm in is t ra t ion 
has been characterized t o date by: (i) s low decision-making; (ii) i n s u f f i c i e n t l y qualified 
human resources with a l a c k o f appropriate ma te r ia l resources; and (iii) a p o o r l y adapted 
development and ins t i tu t iona l management f ramewo rk , w h i c h has hampered the G oM ’ s 
a b i l i t y t o elaborate e f fec t ive development p o l i c y and m o b i l i z e the necessary resources. 
Furthermore, p l a n n i n g and development structures are dispersed within different ministries 
with inadequate coo rd ina t ion mechanisms between them. The j u d i c i a l system i t s e l f i s 
characterized by: (i) comp l ica ted and cos t ly procedures; (ii) inadequate access, concentrated 
in Bamako; (iii) i r re levan t leg is la t ion and regu la t ion unable t o keep up with social, po l i t ica l , 
economic, cultural, and env i ronmen ta l changes; (iv) lack o f t ra ined personnel comb ined with 

- 11 - 

a l a c k o f judicial inspection and accountability; and (v) unclear division between political 
and administrative affairs within the judiciary system. 

23. 
Governance. In 1999, the GoM launched the Na t iona l Policy to Fight Corruption. 
S i n c e then, implementation has been progressing, albeit at a slow pace due to the sheer 
complexity o f the i s s u e s coupled with the weak judicial system. In July 2002, the GoM 
formed an a d hoc committee on corruption as part o f the Prime M i n i s t e r ’ s office, which led 
to the Council o f Ministers’ adoption o f several committee recommendations to create and 
strengthen in te rna l inspections and limit procurement abuses. The committee’s work 
benefited from the Bank-prepared “Recommendations to Reinforce the Anti-Corruption 
Program” published in April 2002 at the GoM’s request. Efforts need to be enhanced to 
implement further recommendations from the Report. 

24. 
Public Expenditure Management. The GoM has made some strides in improving 
public finance management. Efficiency and efficacy in the budget preparation procedures 
have improved s ince the introduction o f program-budgets in 1998 and the increase in the 
number o f Inspectors and Magistrates. The L o i s de Re‘glement 1997 to 2001 have been 
produced, adopted by the Cabinet and submitted to Parliament for approval. In addition, 
improved inspections and a newly adopted nomenclature have increased transparency and 
monitoring o f budget implementation. The GoM i s committed to strengthening these reforms 
and to implementing the recommendations o f the World Bank-led 2002-3 Country Financial 
Accountability Assessment (CFAA). As part o f the HIPC Expenditure Tracking Assessment, 
t h e GoM has made very strong progress on implementing measures outlined in the related 
ac t ion plan to improve public expenditure management, and has just created a ve‘rzjkateur 
inde‘pendunt, similar to a general accounting o f f ice . Furthermore, the GoM i s preparing a 
referendum to separate the section des comptes from the Supreme Court to create an 
independent Cour des Comptes (a judicial court). 

25. 
With the 2003 Budget, the authorities have introduced a three-year medium-term 
expenditure framework. A procedures manual fo r budget execution has been prepared and 
in te rna l audit functions have been strengthened. Also, the capabilities o f the Court o f 
Accounts have been strengthened with additional s ta f f and new f a c i l i t i e s to enable clearing 
the backlog o f work and ensuring timely completion o f responsibilities in the future. With a 
view toward strengthening the budget information system, mechanisms to integrate the 
computer systems o f the treasury, budget, and f inanc ia l control departments are being 
developed, and w i l l be tested and installed in the coming year. Additional measures w i l l be 
pursued to ensure continued improvements in public expenditure management. 

26. 
Procurement. In 1995, the GoM implemented a public procurement code and 
procurement regulations. While private sector procurement functions relatively well, 
Government procurement su f fe rs from inefficiency due to weak capacity in human and 
administrative resources, and a lack o f decentralization o f procurement procedures. 
Corrective measures are being taken to improve transparency by reducing leeway for 
subjective decision-making in public procurement procedures, and by filling in regulatory 
and administrative gaps that could leave room for corruption. The GoM has also indicated 
that i t intends to strengthen monitoring s t ruc tu res to e n s u r e that adopted codes and laws are 
applied, as well as develop an e th ics code. Improvement in human resource management and 
an increased focus on the responsibility o f the public procurement body, combined with 
greater vigilance among a l l stakeholders, w i l l help fill this gap.

opening i t up t o compe t i t ion and creating the necessary lega l and regu la to ry f ramewo rk f o r

BDM-SA t o create the largest bank in M a l i and the twelfth largest bank in the U E M O A , 
thereby increasing M a l i ’ s presence in the reg iona l f inanc ia l ma rke t . The BIM-SA bank i s

T r a n s p o r t Sector . The p rog ram o f re fo rms and investments in the transport sector in

(ii) imp rove and m a i n t a i n infrastructure, especially f o r roads and ra i l ; and (iii) open access t o

E n v i r o nm e n t . In 1999 with the adop t ion o f the N a t i o n a l Env i ronmen ta l A c t i o n P l a n 
(NEAP), the G o M strengthened i t s p o l i c y f o r the env i ronmen t with seven strategic axes, f o u r

A f r i c a n States (ECOWAS ) and the West A f r i c a n Econom ic and Mone ta ry U n i o n (UEMOA ) . 
The E C O W A S Heads o f State endorsed the New Partnership f o r A f r i c a n Deve lopmen t 
(NEPAD ) and con f i rmed the ro le o f the E C O W A S Secretariat as lead agency f o r

M a l i plays a key ro le in regional harmonization o f sectoral policies in power, 
transport, telecommunications, and agriculture. Potential markets in t h e reg ion for M a l i ’ s 
products include livestock products, f r u i t s (mangoes) and even r ice in the medium run. But 
success w i l l depend on improvement o f bus iness practices in the region, development o f 
market in fo rma t ion systems (to be aware o f bus iness opportunities) as well as the e l im ina t ion 
o f non - ta r i f f barriers (including i l lega l payments at checkpoints) wh ich dramatically slow the 
speed and ease o f goods across the region. As a landlocked country lack ing a viable 
transportation system, whose economy i s based o n the p r ima ry sector and r aw materials, i t i s 
extremely important that M a l i be well integrated in the western A f r i c a region. The context i s 
a l l the more urgent considering the recen t impact o f the CGte d’Ivoire crisis, wh ich clearly 
displays the need for further diversification o f trade routes within the region. 

44. 
In M a y 2002, M a l i signed the Water Charter with Senegal and Mauritania, the other 
members o f the Organization fo r the Development o f the Senegal River (O rgan isa t ion pou r

The last CAS was prepared in a context o f strong g row th achieved since the 1994 
CFA franc devaluation and was based o n the 1997 Government strategy - Propositions Pour 
Bank’s CAS was structured around two ma in axes: (i) stable economic growth; and 
(ii) sustainable human development. 

46. 
Regarding the first axis - supporting stable economic g row th - good progress was 
made on g row th and macroeconomic stability (see Para. 9) with the support o f the Bank’s 
structural adjustment lending and the IMF ’ s PRGF fac i l i ty . The Bank also p rov ided support 
to broad-based g row th by supporting the ru ra l sector through the Grass Roots Hunger and 
Poverty Project (PAIB)4 and the Ag r icu l tu ra l S e r v i c e s and Farmers Organization Project 
(PASAOP), and b y expansion o f irrigated areas and bu i ld ing feede r roads through the Rural 
Infrastructure Project (PNIR). A Financial Sector Operation was also prepared t o support the 
goal o f creating an enabling financial environment to a l low for private sector-led g row th (see 
Table 5 for Bank operations approved since the last CAS). The combination o f the SAC, 
Financial Sector Project and the Bank’s Ana ly t ica l and Advisory Ac t iv i t ies (AAA) program, 

The Grassroots Hunger and Pover ty pro jec t (PA IB ) had already surpassed expectations by reach ing 186

Overall, M a l i has pe r fo rmed well o n the imp lemen ta t ion o f t h e C A S . As shown in 
Table 6, M a l i fulfilled nea r ly a l l o f the triggers in the base case scenario and fulfilled mos t o f

Client Survey. The April 2002 C l ien t Survey, comp lemen ted by a feedback session 
in Novembe r 2002, conc luded the f o l l ow i n g : 

a) 

the Bank should strengthen its own decentralization and deconcentration process to 

be closer to M a l i a n realities. The B a n k was already taking, and w i l l continue t o take, 
concrete actions t o strengthen the skills-base o f the Bamako o f f ice . I t i s also t a k i n g 
advantage o f the ava i lab i l i ty o f expert s t a f f based in the western A f r i c a region; 

b) the Bank needs to he lp the G o M to strengthen itsJiduciary management in order to

OED Results. OED ’s evaluations o f projects c losed since F Y 9 9 revealed mixed

were ra ted satisfactory f o r outcome while the other fou r we re ra ted m a r g i n a l l y satisfactory. 
O n l y 62.5% were likely t o be sustainable. Those n o t deemed t o be sustainable were e i the r 
unable t o create a v iab le lega l and regu la to ry f ramewo rk f o r sus ta inab i l i ty (Mining Capacity 
Project), unable t o strengthen the f ramewo rk put in p lace (Second Powe r Project), o r unable

A tho rough analysis o f the imp lemen ta t ion o f the Bank ’s p rev ious CAS , i n c l u d i n g 
OED’s evaluations o f closed projects, indicates impo r tan t lessons w h i c h have been taken i n t o 
account in the selection and design o f future B a n k ac t iv i t ies in M a l i . 

59 . 
An efficient institutional framework increases sustainability and accelerates 
se rv ice delivery. Ins t i tu t iona l weaknesses, no ted f o r nine active projects (PNIR, PASAOP , 
PPIP, Manan ta l i , FSDP, P A A A , PRODESS , PRODEC , and TSP), p r im a r i l y stem f r om : 
(i) frequent G o M reshu f f les - since 1992, the GoM has changed twelve times; (ii) p o o r 
dono r coo rd ina t ion f o r meetings and procedures, w h i c h leads t o m u l t i p l i c i t y o f tasks f o r c i v i l 
servants; (iii) comp lex procedures, pa r t icu la r ly f o r p rocu remen t and disbursement, 
comp l ica ted by an absence o f m o t i v a t i o n and sanction, absence o f fo l low -up , and weak 
h um a n resources; and (iv) insu f f ic ien t pos t -p ro jec t p lann ing f r o m the onset, putting 
sus ta inab i l i ty at risk. 

60. 
T ra ined and motivated human resou rces are vital. Key s t ruc tu res need t o be 
con t inua l ly re in fo rced : (i) cen t ra l administration, pa r t icu la r ly in the va r ious ministry o f f ices 
o f adm in is t ra t ion and finance (D i rec t ions administratives etfinanci&es), where l a c k o f 
training, mo t iva t ion , and accoun tab i l i ty contributes t o s l ow procurement, p o o r f inanc ia l 
management, and s l ow disbursement; (ii) decentralized and deconcentrated adm in is t ra t ive 
structures, pa r t icu la r ly f o r the hea l th and educa t ion sectors, where personnel i s o f t e n l a c k i n g 
o r p o o r l y mo t iva ted because o f l o w salaries; and (iii) c i v i l society and the p r iva te sector, 
where there are la rge deficiencies in planning, management, procedures, and m o n i t o r i n g and 
evaluation. 

6 1. 
Decentralization o f s e r v i c e delivery and community-driven development 
increase grassroots participation and help adapt development programs to local 
realities. By supporting commun i ty -d r iven development, the B a n k was able to con t r ibu te t o 
im p r o v e d service accoun tab i l i ty and increased l o c a l pa r t ic ipa t ion in the p repa ra t ion and

seven on -go ing Bank - f inanced operations f r om the last C A S (PRODEC , PRODESS, PAAA, 
FSDP, PASAOP , PN IR , and P A I B ) . 

62. Monitoring and evaluation (M&E) needs to be conceived from the beginning by 
all stakeholders. The 2003 CPPR revealed five active p ro jec ts (ongo ing : PASAOP , PPIP, 
PRODESS , PROD EC , and TSP) where insu f f ic ien t M&E affects p rog ram qua l i ty . Adequate 
M&E resources w h i c h inc lude necessary funds f o r t ra in ing need t o be allocated f r om the 
onset. Stakeholder invo lvemen t t o de te rm ine ind ica to rs w i l l better p i n p o i n t n o t o n l y h o w t o 
measure progress, but also the capacity limits o f do ing so. 

63. 
The right combination o f instruments can create good results. A striking e lemen t 
o f M a l i ’ s economic performance ove r the last decade i s tha t remarkable strides have been 
made in r u r a l development by an adequate comb ina t ion o f p o l i c y re fo rm , investment, 
techno logy imp rovemen ts and strong donor coordination. This has been the case f o r co t ton 
development, i r r iga ted r i c e cu l t iva t ion and, t o a l e s s e r extent, m ic ro - f inance and integrated 
r u r a l development in southern M a l i . This lesson has been taken i n t o account and guides the 
Bank ’s assistance p o l i c y by p r i o r i t i z i n g the Bank ’s a b i l i t y t o m o b i l i z e and package structural

France supports institutional capacity building and development, including for the judiciary branch, decentralization, health 
and education, urban and rural infrastructure, including the Manantali Dam, and the transport sector. 

Belgium supports decentralization, health and education, and rural development, mainly in livestock and water (for drinking 
and energy). I t also funds various initiatives through trust funds, for example, the FY03 poverty assessment. 

Canada i s very active in institutional development, notably i n budgets and the judiciary system. I t also supports health and 
education, rural infrastructure, including the Manantali Dam and the para-public AGET IPE , urban infrastructure, the 
environment and micro finance. 

Switzerland intervenes very locally, usually i n partnership with large, government programs, i n rural development and the 
environment, governance and decentralization, supporting artisan industries, and small health programs. 

The United States through USA ID does not give direct government support, but channels funds through American NGOs 
in four areas: health, democracy (large decentralization and c iv i l society program including capacity building), education, 
economic growth, including trade promotion, financial sector development (notably micro finance), and agricultural 
promotion (highlighting the animal feed industry). 

Germany i s active in supporting the decentralization process and institutional development, health, education, professional 
training, child trafficking, rural development including natural resource management, rural infrastructure, rural finance, and 
food security, communications, transport, and mines. 

Sweden began intervening i n M a l i only s ince 2000, and currently provides budget support with technical assistance and i s 
active i n education, private sector development in partnership with the IFC/WBG SME department, human rights and

In the con tex t o f i t s p ro jec t po r t fo l io , the B a n k wo rks in partnership with a number o f 
m a j o r donors in M a l i (see A t tachmen t 5). W i th rega rd t o the hea l th program, coo rd ina t ion 
has im p r o v e d considerably since the G o M instituted j o i n t missions and the donor commun i ty

elected a “lead coordinator” (chefde J i l e ) . The education p rog ram also bene f i ts f r o m j o i n t 
missions a l though donor coo rd ina t ion i s weaker and i s one o f the m a i n causes f o r s low 
imp lemen ta t ion o f the p rog ram . Across a l l the donor-financed programs and projects, the 
G o M i s tak ing ac t ion t o ensu re that j o i n t m iss ions are mo re comprehensive in their coverage 
in order t o discourage donors f r o m conduc t ing additional, separate missions. Overall, while 
these mechanisms p rov ide a f ramewo rk f o r mo re e f fec t ive dono r coordination, the 
m u l t i p l i c i t y o f donor procedures impedes e f f ic ien t p ro jec t implementation, as no ted during

Strengthening the p rog ramma t ic approach t o the social sectors i s regarded as a so l id 
building b l o c k f o r b o t h the dono r c omm u n i t y and the G o M t o m o v e towards full budgetary

donors w o r k together t o ensure p rope r sequencing o f the p rog ramma t ic approach so that they 
are on boa rd at the same time and tha t owne rsh ip i s fu l ly with the G o M . In order t o achieve 
the ob jec t ive o f e f fec t ive budgetary support, t w o impo r tan t areas o f capacity building are 
essential: (i) t o build capacity f o r the G o M t o use i t s o w n f iduc ia ry and disbursement

a comprehensive and e f fec t ive M&E f ramewo rk f o r the PRSP, against w h i c h budgetary 
support programs can be measured. Building this capacity i s a core element o f dono r 
programs, i n c l u d i n g the Bank . While these capacity building e f fo r ts are being pursued, the 
G oM , donors and the B a n k are w o r k i n g in pa ra l le l t o ensure greater ha rmon iza t ion o f

Mopt i Retreat, May 31- June 4, 2002. Over sixty participants - representing the State, collectivities, c iv i l society, 
private sector, and donors - brainstormed on CAS possibilities, basing their reflections on the PRSP, the MDGs, 
and field visits to Bank-financed projects. 

Ru ra l Development Strategy Discussions, October 29-31, 2002. Bank staff, primarily from the RD sector, held 

internal discussions for two days, then invited counterparts to j o i n them in a discussion o f the Bank’s work, past &

76. 
T o ensu re selective and adequate coverage o f the r u r a l sec to r in the CAS , the B a n k 
conducted extensive ana ly t ica l w o r k w h i c h identified eight key i s s u e s and challenges t o r u r a l

decentralization, un favo rab le bus iness c l ima te f o r p r iva te sector, limited d ive rs i f ica t ion o f 
income, weak expo r t competitiveness and unfinished p r iva t iza t ions , an inadequate risk 
management strategy, na tu ra l resources constraints and cap i ta l depletion. The key 
conc lus ion o f this analysis i s that pove r ty i s synonymous t o subsistence agriculture. 
Therefore, a key p r i o r i t y i s t o a l l ow farmers t o get access t o markets, generate cash income, 
increase p r o d u c t i v i t y th rough input, equipment and techno logy and get ou t o f the v ic ious 
c i rc le o f subsistence agriculture, l o w p roduc t iv i ty and pove r ty . 

’ The mining component w i l l seek to respond to three key GoM concerns: (i) to ensure that M a l i offers the optimal package 
to both attract incoming investors and increase revenues to the budget and the economy; ( i i) to strengthen its capacity to 
track and analyze what mining companies are doing, both in general operations and with respect to environmental concerns; 
and (iii) to help artisanal and small-scale miners to operate in a more efficient and environmentally friendlier manner. The 
Bank has a comparative advantage in this area as a result o f significant recent mining work in other countries.

Box 6: Bank Activities on Regional Integration 

As already mentioned in Paragraphs 42-44, Mali i s a member o f UEMOA and ECOWAS and plays a key 
role in several regional integration activities. The Bank’s 2001 Regional Integration Assistance Strategy 
(RIAS) seeks t o support the objective o f deeper regional integration chosen by the countries o f WAEMU 
and ECOWAS by promoting an Open, Unified Regional Economic Space (OURES), and a conducive 
environment to facilitate the growth o f a more efficient and competitive private sector. I t also seeks to 
support the Region’s own goals o f accelerating growth and alleviating poverty, while recognizing that 
assistance to individual countries - with a heightened focus o n cross-border constraints and opportunities 
facing a country - w i l l remain the primary vehicle for support from the Bank. 

The following regional activities a l l play a core role in the Bank’s overall support to Ma l i : 
The West African Power Project (WAPP) aims to build and reinforce regional electricity transmission 
l i n e s through financing a line between CBte d’Ivoire and Mali and t o ass is t in developing the regulatory 
framework for regional power trade within ECOWAS (see para. 82). 
The harmonization o f telecommunications policy and the establishment o f a regional regulatory 
framework i s likely t o feature as a component o f the Sources o f Growth Project (FY05). 
The Bank i s providing support to regional water management issues through AAA work and a regional 
IDF to the Organization for the Development o f the Senegal River (OMVS). 
The proposed transport operations are being designed within an overall regional framework fo r 
strengthening and diversifying the transport corridors in western Africa. 
The Bank’s AAA w i l l focus on fast-tracking integration between Ma l i , Senegal and Guinea 
A Regional Payments System Credit to the BCEAO i s under implementation that seeks to establish 
payment systems adapted to the market needs o f WAEMU and that are internationally acceptable. 
Support to the implementation o f the WAEMU Agricultural Policy (adopted in December 2001).

Lending Scenarios

The IDA FY 0 4 - 0 6 a l loca t ion f o r M a l i i s s e t at US$390 m i l l i o n in the base-case 
scenario, US$462 m i l l i o n in the high-case scenario and US$237 m i l l i o n in the low-case 
scenario (Table 8). The p lanned operations f o r M a l i are re la t ive ly large (with the excep t ion 
o f the GDLN project) so as t o a l l ow f o r conso l ida t ion o f the p ro jec t p o r t f o l i o a round fewer 
operations. These projects are, t o the extent possible, mu l t i -sec to ra l operations and i n v o l v e 
partnerships with donors, NGOs , the p r iva te sector and c i v i l society. There i s a degree o f 
f ron t - load ing o f the lending operations p r im a r i l y because p lanned F Y 0 3 operations were 
pushed t o F Y 0 4 as their p repa ra t ion suffered delays resulting f r o m the 2002 Presidential and 
leg is la t ive elections and the fo rma t ion o f a new Government. 

100. 
Base-case scenario. M a l i i s cu r ren t ly in the base case. Under the base-case scenario, 
lending f o r M a l i w i l l amount t o up t o US$390 m i l l i o n . This scenario i s predicated o n

High-case scenario. Lending c o u l d increase t o up t o US$462 m i l l i o n under the high- 
case scenario, with the PRSCs in t roduced in FY05 ($35 m i l l i o n ) and the a l loca t ion t o the 
Second Transport P ro jec t increased t o $90 m i l l i o n . This scenario i s p red ica ted o n

M a l i cou ld m e e t the triggers f o r the high case due t o the f o l l ow i n g factors: (i) i t has a strong 
track reco rd in implementing macroeconomic and structural reforms, and this good 
performance i s expected t o be maintained; (ii) the G o M and development partners are fully

key sectors - such as hea l th and education - has been strong since 1998 , thus p r o v i d i n g a 

- 3 8 - 

solid platform fo r continued good performance and achievement o f PRSP targets, particularly 
with a more programmatic support from donors. 

102. Low-case scenario. The low-case scenario i s determined on M a l i not being able to 
meet the base-case criteria. In this case, lending would only be up to US$237 million as the 
Bank would not do any further adjustment lending and would reduce or delay other lending 
operations. The PRSCs would be postponed until FY07 (or beyond). I f necessary, an 
investment operation would be prepared t o support the health and education sectors, in the 
absence o f budgetary support from the PRSC. The focus o f the Bank’s work would shift to 
supporting capacity building to enable M a l i t o move back t o the base case. 

103. 
U s e o f I D A Grants. M a l i qualifies for IDA grants as a debt-vulnerable IDA-only 
country as per the guidelines which se t the criteria as part o f the IDA-1 3 replenishment 
framework. On this basis, IDA grants can account for 29% o f the lending program although 
the actual percentage o f the lending program which may be financed by IDA grants i s 
established on an annual basis. The strategy fo r the u s e o f these grants in the M a l i program 
i s t o apply them t o those Bank activities which support the priorities o f the PRSP. In FY04, 
the Global D is tance Learning Network Project, the proposed HIV/AIDS MAP operation, and 
the proposed SAC-3 Supplemental Credit would be financed through IDA grants. The 
Interim Transport Project in FY04 and the Rural Community-Based Project in FY05 would 
be partially funded through IDA grants.

Ma l i: I D A Lending and Debt Sustainability 

Introduction 

The enhanced H IPC I n i t i a t i v e reduced M a l i ’ s external deb t burden considerably. At i t s 
recent comp le t ion p o i n t in M a r c h 2003, M a l i ’ s creditors c omm i t t e d themselves i r revocab ly 
t o reduc ing M a l i ’ s ex te rna l debt by $417 m i l l i o n in NPV terms as o f end-1998, bringing the 
NPV o f debt d o w n f r o m 184 percent t o 126 percent o f exports as o f end-2002. This i s in 
add i t ion t o the $121 m i l l i o n comm i t ted under the o r i g i n a l HIPC I n i t i a t i v e . The Boards o f the 
B a n k and Fund conc luded in M a r c h 2003 tha t in the absence o f m a j o r exogenous shocks, this 
r e l i e f reduced M a l i ’ s debts t o a sustainable l e v e l . At the same time i t i s widely recogn ized 
tha t ach iev ing long - te rm debt sustainability requ i res prudent debt management o n the pa r t o f 
the authorities a long with the p r o v i s i o n o f f inanc ing o n suitably concessional t e rm s by the 
in te rna t iona l commun i ty . 

Given tha t the comp le t ion p o i n t document was presented t o the B o a r d in M a r c h 2003, the 
macroeconomic p ro jec t ions unde r ly ing the comp le t ion p o i n t debt sus ta inab i l i ty analysis have 
been re ta ined in this annex. The baseline scenario, predicated o n base case IDA lend ing and 
a successful d ive rs i f ica t ion o f the expo r t base, indicates tha t M a l i ’ s debt t o expo r t ra t io m a y 
increase g radua l ly ove r the next decade, but i s expected t o r em a i n under 150 percent, peak ing 
a t 142 percent in 2014 and g radua l ly dec l in ing thereafter. Ex te rna l debt service i s expected 
t o rema in b e l ow 7 percent and 10 percent o f exports and revenues respec t ive ly over t h e 
p ro jec t ion pe r iod . Sensitivity analysis, however, indicates tha t the NPV debt burden 
ind ica to rs c o u l d r i s e sharply i f M a l i ’ s exports g r ow mo re s l ow l y than p ro jec ted o r i f M a l i i s 
hit by exogenous shocks (such as declines in the p r ice o f g o l d and co t ton o r a recurrence o f 
drought). 

Sensitivity Analysis 

The baseline scenario i s predicated o n con t inued f isca l consolidation, a gradual 
d ive rs i f ica t ion o f the expo r t base, and the absence o f m a j o r external shocks. Re fo rms are 
expected t o increase p r o d u c t i v i t y in the co t ton sector and t o stimulate greater value-added in 
ag r icu l tu ra l p r o d u c t i o n and processing. Re fo rms t o the lega l system and regu la to ry 
env i ronmen t are expected t o stimulate the p r iva te sector and attract f o r e i g n investment. The 
base case scenario also assumes IDA grants at 29 percent under I D A - 1 3 , Until the successful 
d ive rs i f ica t ion o f the expo r t base i s achieved, however, M a l i ’ s expo r t earnings rema in 
exposed t o p r ice vo la t i l i ty , d is rup t ion o f transport l i n k s , and c l ima t ic conditions. The speed 
with which the p r iva te sector w i l l respond t o the re fo rms undertaken by the G o M i s n o t yet 
clear. 

An alternative scenario i s therefore p rov ided t o ind ica te the e f fec t o n the NPV debt-to-export 
ra t io o f n om i n a l annual expo r t g r ow t h at 5.1 percent (the average g r ow t h rate 1998-2002) 
f r om 2004 onwards (as compared with 6.6 percent average growth f r o m 2004 onwards in the 
baseline scenario). New b o r r ow i n g i s kept t o the l e v e l s p ro jec ted in the baseline scenario, 
and IDA lending i s assumed t o be at the l e v e l o f the base case. 

- 47 - 

The e v o l u t i o n o f M a l i ’ s debt-to-export r a t i o i s also very sens i t ive t o the terms o f new 
f inanc ing . A second alternative scenario therefore assumes a decreased p r o v i s i o n o f cap i ta l 
grants equ iva len t t o h a l f a percentage p o i n t o f GDP f r o m 2004 onwards, and an equivalent 
increase in the l e v e l o f concessional bo r row ing . 

Figure 1 i l lus t ra tes the impac t o f these scenarios. In the case o f the l ow e r exports scenario, in 
the absence o f any moves t o cons t ra in new bo r row ing , the debt-to-exports ra t io w o u l d 
increase g radua l ly and inexo rab ly f o r the foreseeable future, passing the 150 ra t io in 2014. 
In the case o f the l e s s concessional f inanc ing scenario, the debt-to-export ra t io w o u l d peak at 
151 percent in 2017. The debt-to-export r a t i o w o u l d stand 12 percentage po in ts above the 
baseline scenario at the end o f the p r o j e c t i o n p e r i o d in 2021.

Given tha t debt service over the next f i v e years i s expected t o average $64 m i l l i o n pe r year 
while 2002 exports stood at just under $ 1 b i l l i o n , debt se rv ic ing ratios in the medium t e r m 
are n o t expected t o present ma jo r d i f f icu l t ies . Howeve r , the r e s u l t s highlight tha t given the 
comb ina t ion o f high leve ls o f pove r ty reduc ing spending p lanned in M a l i and the narrowness 
o f the country’s expo r t base, an increase in bo r row ing , even o n highly concessional t e rm s , 
c o u l d lead t o debt sustainability p rob lems in the l o n g t e rm . I t i s therefore v i t a l tha t in the 
event the key ra t ios begin t o show a clear u pw a r d trend, the authorities respond with a p o l i c y 
o f cu r ta i l ing new bo r row ing , rep lac ing loans with grants, and appropriate measures t o 
encourage g row th .

IDA i s the single largest c red i to r t o M a l i , accounting f o r 42 percent o f the coun t ry ’s 
b o r r ow i n g in 1999-2002. In assessing the size o f the program, therefore, debt sustainability 
must be a m a j o r consideration. The estimates suggest tha t assuming 2 9 percent o f the IDA - 
13 a l loca t ion comes in the f o r m o f grants, the NPV o f debt as o f end-2007 w o u l d be $79 
m i l l i o n higher in the high case than in the l o w case lending scenario, and around $25 m i l l i o n 
higher in the high case than in the base case. The difference between the high and l o w case 
lending scenarios w o u l d be equivalent t o slightly over 5 percent o f the debt stock in NPV 
t e rm s . Howeve r , i f the fa i lu re t o ma in ta in a good mac roeconom ic env i ronmen t such as 
w o u l d trigger the l o w case lending scenario were t o reduce the rate o f expo r t g r ow t h by a 
third, then despite the l ow e r rate o f disbursements the debt-to-export r a t i o w o u l d be 5 po in ts 
higher in the l o w case than in the base case by 2007, and by 201 5 the debt-to-exports ra t io 
w o u l d stand at 170 percent as compared with 142 percent in the base case scenario. 
Furthermore, as ind ica ted in the C A S theme o n p r om o t i n g growth, the Bank ’s p rog ram i t s e l f 
i s a imed at assisting the d ive rs i f ica t ion o f the M a l i a n economy and s t imu la t ing further 
sources o f g row th . 

The sensitivity analysis w o u l d suggest tha t the e v o l u t i o n o f M a l i ’ s k e y debt ra t ios shou ld be 
watched carefully, t o ensure tha t i f the g r ow t h p ro jec t ions turn ou t t o be op t im is t ic , they do 
n o t encourage ove r - lend ing by IDA o r ove r -bo r row ing by the coun t ry . In the event tha t 
exports do n o t increase at the l e v e l p ro jec ted in the baseline scenario fo r reasons outside the 
con t ro l o f the country, i t i s essential tha t the in te rna t iona l c omm u n i t y respond with a greater 
l e v e l o f concessional finance in order t o avo id the reemergence o f a n unsustainable debt 
burden.

Attachment 4 

Core Labor Standards in M a l i 

M a l i has ratified a l l 27 I L O conventions (two denounced in 2000, see below) which 
include the five core labor standards: 

1. Prohibition o f forced labor 
2. 
The elimination o f discrimination in employment 
3 . Freedom o f association 
Right to organize and bargain collectively 
The elimination o f exploitive use o f child labor 

4. 
5 . 

I n 2000, GoM denounced tw o conventions referring to the minimum working age in both 
industrial and non-industrial activities. However, attention in 200 1/2002 given to a child 
trafficking ring from Mali to the Ivory Coast prompted GoM to launch an impressive 
marketing campaign to raise awareness against child labor during the 2002 African 
Nations Cup.

M a l i : IMF - W o r l d B an k Relations 

Partnership in Mali’s Development Strategy 

M a l i ’ s development objectives place increased emphasis o n p o v e r t y reduc t ion and growth, as 
re f lec ted in i t s Pove r ty Reduc t ion Strategy Paper (PRSP) app roved by the Government in 
M a y 2002. T h e j o i n t assessment o f the PRSF by the s t a f f o f t h e W o r l d bank and IMF was 
presented and app roved by the respective Boa rds o f D i rec to rs in M a r c h 2003. The PRSP 
process enabled the coun t ry t o articulate an integrated g r ow t h and pove r ty strategy 
f ramewo rk f o r medium and l o n g t e r m development, building u p o n the na t iona l pove r ty 
strategy fo rmu la ted in 1998 with U N D P assistance and s i tua t ing M a l i ’ s m a i n pove r ty 
reduc t ion challenges e x p l i c i t l y within a sound macro-economic f ramewo rk . M a l i also 
reached i t s H I P C comp le t ion p o i n t in M a r c h 2003, supported by the j o i n t debt sustainability 
analysis. 

The IMF continues t o take the lead in assisting M a l i in ma in ta in ing macroeconomic s tab i l i ty 
and f inanc ia l sus ta inab i l i ty th rough setting quantitative targets within the f ramewo rk o f the 
Pove r ty Reduc t ion G r o w t h F a c i l i t y (PRGF), w h i c h has been in p lace since August 1999 and 
w i l l expire in August 2003. Structural measures in the p rog ram are coo rd ina ted with the 
W o r l d B a n k and s t ruc tu ra l cond i t iona l i ty limited t o areas with s ign i f ican t macroeconomic, 
t y p i c a l l y fiscal, imp l ica t ions . Thus the IMF’s structural pe r fo rmance c r i te r ia focus o n co t ton 
sector re fo rms (measures impac t ing o n the government’s transfers t o the sector), and 
structural benchmarks inc lude measures related t o p u b l i c expenditure management (e f f ic ien t 
use o f H I P C and other resources) as well as c i v i l service r e f o rm (p r ima r i ly i s s u e s impac t ing 
o n the wage bill). 

The W o r l d B a n k continues t o lead the p o l i c y dialogue o n structural, soc ia l and ins t i tu t iona l 
re fo rms in a number o f sectors. A U S 7 0 m i l l i o n Structural Adjustment C red i t was approved 
by the W o r l d B a n k B o a r d in December 2001 , comp r is ing co t ton sector r e f o rm and p u b l i c 
expenditure management r e f o rm measures. Other B a n k operations tha t address, respectively, 
p r iva te sector development, f inanc ia l sector development, education sector re fo rms and 
investment program, and hea l th sector re fo rms and investment program, have been under 
imp lemen ta t ion f o r v a r y i n g lengths o f time. Progress i s being made in a l l these operations, 
a lbe i t slower than an t ic ipa ted in some sectors. 

The W o r l d B a n k i s also lead ing the diagnostic trade study under the In teg ra ted F ramewo rk 
f o r Trade (IF), an i n i t i a t i v e supported by the W o r l d Bank, IMF, W o r l d Trade Organization, 
the UN Conference o n Trade and Development, UND P , and the In te rna t iona l Trade

enhance M a l i ’ s in teg ra t ion i n t o the w o r l d economy and in te rna t iona l trade p o l i c y

(namely mus ic and handicrafts). The diagnostic repo r t w i l l be discussed at the next UN

The current Coun t ry Assistance Strategy (CAS ) f o r M a l i was approved by t h e B o a r d in April 
1998. I t s focus i s o n stable economic growth, and sustainable human development. The next
