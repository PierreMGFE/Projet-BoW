Country Assistance Strategy 
Executive Summary 

i. 
The last Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Sri Lanka-discussed at the Board on June 13, 
1996-was 
prepared at a time of great uncertainty with regard to the prospects for peace, political 
stability and economic reform. For a number of years the uncertainties continued: Sri Lanka went 
through frequent elections that slowed the momentum for structural reform and the domestic security 
situation-most notably, an escalation of the nearly two decade-long civil conflict waged between the Sri 
Lankan army and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE)-took 
a tremendous toll on development 
of this unique island nation. 

ii. 
Since late-2001, however, the situation in Sri Lanka has shown noticeable improvements. On the 
peace front, 'a Memorandum of Understanding signed between the Government and LTTE in February 
2002 has resulted in a permanent cease-fire. Five successful rounds of peace discussions-facilitated by 
Norway-have 
taken place and with significant advances being made, there is great optimism that the 
long-standing conflict can be resolved. On the political front, in December 2001, a private sector-oriented 
Government-headed 
by Prime Minister Mr. Rani1 Wickremasinghe-assumed control and has moved 
forward decisively in starting to implement a comprehensive reform program. Finally, on the economic 
front, S r i Lanka has begun to experience a gradual recovery and the economy is currently growing at an 
annual rate of more than 5 percent. With these developments, today Sri Lanka faces a rare window of 
opportunity. 

iii. 

The Executive Directors may wish to discuss: 
The planned significant increase in IDA activity in response to the peace process and poverty 
reduction strategy (PRS); 
The balance between the lending and non-lending programs; 
The choice of instruments to deliver the lending program; and 
The appropriateness of the CAS outcomes given the PRS. 

iv. 
The Government has articulated an economic program and poverty reduction strategy: Regaining 
Sri Lanka: Vision and Strategy f o r Accelerated Development (RSL) . This is an ambitious proposal to 
eliminate factors which inhibit the restraints on private sector activity and to change the role of the state, 
while addressing the key elements of poverty. The principal objectives of RSL include: (i) building a 
supportive macroeconomic environment; (ii) reducing conflict-related poverty; (iii) creating opportunities 
for pro-poor growth; (iv) investing in people; (v ) empowering the poor and strengthening governance; and 
(vi) implementing an effective monitoring and evaluation system. 

V. 

The CAS program supports the Poverty Reduction Strategy and is organized around three central 
themes: Peace, Growth and Equity. First, a return to peace and restoration of domestic security are 
critical to create a framework for sustainable poverty reduction and growth and ensure that the fiscal 
burden remains tolerable. It is also important towards ensuring that the most vulnerable poor groups- 
i.e., the displaced and those in conflict-affected areas-are 
reached. Secondly, economic growth is the 
main instrument for achieving prosperity and creating more resources for distribution. Finally, ensuring a 
balance/equity within the society is essential, especially with deep pockets of poverty existing in the 
South and North East. Sri Lanka's ability to attain the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) will be 
influenced by equitable progress towards improving social and human development indicators. The 
assistance strategy is a comprehensive one in which the International Development Association (IDA), 
the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) 

all play significant roles. Capacity building is an integral element of the strategy and the World Bank 
Institute (WBI) plays a central role in implementing this cross-cutting theme. 

vi. 
The CAS is “results-focused,” In the thematic area of peace, key outcomes that the CAS is 
designed to support include: (i) restored infrastructure in health, education and irrigation; and (ii) 
technical capacity built to implement the reconstruction and poverty reduction efforts. In the area of 
growth, key CAS outcomes include: (i) legal frameworks established to increase flexibility in the labor 
and land markets; (ii) regulatory environment conducive to private sector participation established; (iii) 
the time and formal cost of business start-up reduced; and (iv) agricultural producers receiving more 
consistent price signals and clearer land title. Finally, in equity, key CAS outcomes include: (i) improved 
access to and quality of public services in education, health and water supply; and (ii) expanded degree of 
empowerment of communities to address their own development needs. 

v i i . 

The base case lending program consists of an average of four operations per year for a total of 
US$SOO million of IDA resources during FY03-FY06. In each year, the lending program would be 
anchored in a Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC) providing program support to the 
implementation of the PRS. This would be complemented by two to four investmentlsectoral operations 
per year to support key programs in the focus areas. Given the intensity of the conflict, Sri Lanka 
qualifies for a limited amount of IDA grants during FY03 and FY04. Key operations in the equity 
theme-i.e., 
in rural water, health and rural poverty-would 
be financed by IDA grants. Lending 
activities would be accompanied by a strong non-lending program, with a particular focus on public 
expenditure and poverty issues. In the base case, it is assumed that progress would continue towards 
achieving a lasting peace. To remain in the base case, specific triggers must be met including: (i) 
maintaining satisfactory macroeconomic performance; (ii) successful implementation of the economic 
reform program; (iii) progress in addressing equity concerns; and ( iv ) satisfactory portfolio management. 

viii. 
The high case scenario would have a lending volume approximately 25 percent above the base 
case. In addition to maintaining performance as envisioned under the base case, additional improvements 
would be expected in the areas of fiscal management, private participation in infrastructure, public sector 
management and decentralization. The strategy also describes two types of low case scenarios: (i) a 
situation triggered by a breakdown of the peace process and the resumption of hostilities or the serious 
lagging behind of structural reforms; and (ii) a deeper low case scenario-i.e., 
an exit strategy-if 
the 
peace process were to break down entirely and hostilities were to break out on a national scale. 

ix. 
A CAS Completion Report--evaluating performance under the previous CAS-has 
been 
prepared and the lessons learned have been subsequently incorporated. Furthermore, the CAS contains a 
comprehensive country program results framework that links together the different levels of results-Le., 
the country’s longer-term development agenda (based on the PRS/RSL) and the shorter-term goals to be 
achieved during the CAS period and supported by the Bank’s interventions. During initial 
implementation of the CAS, special focus will be placed on refining the results framework by 
establishing: (i) baseline information and benchmarks for the various indicators to be monitored during 
implementation; and (ii) a solid monitoring and evaluation capacity. 

X. 

Because of the historic moment at which S r i Lanka finds itself, the strategy is inherently risky. 
The Government and indeed the LTTE are themselves being very bold and taking enormous risks with 
respect to their own political futures for the sake of a better future for the people of Sri Lanka. The Bank 
should be prepared to accept the risks of this strategy so long as the two parties remain committed to 
achieving peace and laying the foundation for a renewed attack on poverty. Therefore, while the strategy 
has very high risks, i t has potentially very high rewards in a country that for too long has been performing 
below its potential. The Bank is adopting appropriate strategies to mitigate the risks.

xi. 
Sri Lanka now has the opportunity to break out of the conflict and follow a path of sustained 
development and progress for all its people. This CAS presents a coherent strategy for how the World 
Bank Group should support S r i Lanka to help this opportunity be realized.

COUNTRY ASSISTANCE STRATEGY 

INTRODUCTION 

1. 
The last Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Sri Lanka was considered by the Board on June 
13, 1996 and a Progress Report was discussed on January 19, 1999. Since that time, Sri Lanka has been 
through numerous elections that slowed the momentum for structural reform. At the same time, the 
domestic security situation worsened as a result of the intensification of the nearly two decade-long civil 
conflict between the Sri Lankan army and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). This period of 
uncertainty has been costly to the development of this unique island nation. 

2. 
In the last year, however, the country has experienced encouraging developments in many 
respects. First and foremost, there has been progress towards peace and improved domestic security. The 
Government and LTTE signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on February 23, 2002 that 
resulted in a permanent cease-fire. Both sides have demonstrated their commitment to finding a lasting 
solution to the conflict and five successful rounds of negotiations-facilitated by Norway-have 
taken 
place. 
Second, a more optimistic political environment has emerged. 
The private sector-oriented 
Government-headed 
by Prime Minister Mr. Rani1 Wickremasinghe-which 
took office in December 
2001 has taken earnest and decisive steps in implementing a far-reaching economic reform program. 
Finally, an economy recovery is underway with growth currently at an annual rate of more than 5 percent. 
Today, Sri Lanka is poised to capitalize on these promising developments. 

3 . 
This CAS has been drawn up on the basis of the post-conflict situation in which Sri Lanka finds 
itself. As such, the lessons from other post-conflict situations have been incorporated, but it has been 
decided not to apply the IDA post-conflict framework to this case. Although many features of post- 
conflict countries apply to S r i Lanka, the state did not break down during this conflict, even within the 
conflict-affected areas of the country. Therefore, a number of the challenges that other post-conflict 
countries have faced are not present.

SOCIAL, POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC CONTEXT

Social Context 

4. 

Sri Lanka-long 
an outlier among developing nations-holds 
a unique position in South Asia. It 
was one of the first developing countries to provide universal health and education coverage and promote 
gender equality and social mobilization. As a result, Sri Lanka achieved human development outcomes 
comparable to those of high income countries and surpassed some of the Millennium Development Goals 
(MDGs) at an early stage of its development process (see Box 1 and Appendix VI). Sri Lanka has largely 
eradicated destitution and its long-standing commitment to human development has ensured that even the 
poor have relatively good health and education. For the most part, economic growth has been reasonable, 
and despite the acceleration of the conflict in the 1990s, the country’s per capita income (US$830) 
remains the second highest in South Asia (behind Maldives).

A poverty assessment-Cri Lanku: Poverty Assessment'-was 
finalized in FY02. Based on 
is 
and other analysis, i t is estimated that 25 percent of Sri Lankans remain below the national poverty line; 
there are large disparities in poverty incidence among regions; and the rural population remains especially 
vulnerable to income fluctuations2. Whereas the Western province--containing the capital city and most 
of the country's manufacturing and services-has 
a relatively low incidence of poverty, the North, East 
and other areas affected by the conflict have high levels of material deprivation and human suffering. 
While i t has not been possible to carry out surveys in the North and East in recent years due to the 
conflict, it is likely that the poverty conditions in these regions are far more severe than in other parts of 
the country and compounded by massive destruction of economic and social infrastructure. 

6. 
Over 90 percent of Sri Lanka's identified poor live in rural areas of the South and on tedrubber 
estates in the Central region where the depth and severity of poverty are almost twice as high as in urban 
areas. Small-scale subsistence agriculture-especially paddy farming-and wage labor (in farms or 
plantations) are the main sources of income for most of the poor. Incidence of poverty varies only 
slightly across ethnic groups, although plantation estate workers (who represent about 4 percent of the 
poor and are mostly Indian Tamils) are among the poorest, often deprived of basic infrastructure and

This is based on a Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES) carried ou t in 1995196 and does not include the 
North East. A new survey will be completed in mid-2003 and together with an FY03 Social Assessment of the Conflict- 
Affected Areas will allow for a more complete up-to-date picture of poverty in Sri Lanka.

other public services, and face severe difficulty integrating into the economy and society due to the 
remote location of estates, language barriers, and for some, lack of citizenship cards. 

7 . 
The poor in Sri Lanka are relatively well-protected due to free and universal access to health and 
education services, large income transfer programs-such 
as Samurdhi-and 
substantial subsidy 
schemes. The early successes in human development outcomes undoubtedly result from these long- 
standing policies. But there are weaknesses. While access to health and education services is well- 
distributed, quality--especially in poor areas-remains 
inadequate. Poor households also face shortfalls 
in access to other basic services+.g., 
among the poorest households, only 38 percent have electricity, 55 
percent safe sanitation and 61 percent safe drinking water. Access to English language and technical 
education-both 
in great demand-is 
also low in poor regions. Moreover, social protection programs 
have become highly politicized and Samurdhi is presently available to 60 percent of the population. 

B. 

Political Developments 

8 . 
Sri Lanka has had numerous elections since the last CAS-including Provincial Councils (April 
1999), Presidential (December 1999), Parliamentary (October 2000 and December 2001) and local 
(March 2002). The United National Front (UNF)-traditionally 
supportive of economic liberalization- 
won a near majority in the 225-member legislature in the December 2001 parliamentary elections. With 
the support of allied parties, the UNF formed a Government with a two seat majority, returning to power 
after seven years in the opposition. Mr. Rani1 Wickremasinghe-Prime Minister from 1993-1994 and a 
cabinet minister from 1977-1993-was sworn in as Prime Minister on December 9, 2001. Following this, 
in the March 2002 local elections the UNF won a sizeable majority of the seats, strengthening its mandate 
to pursue a peace and economic reform agenda. 

9. 
Mrs. Chandrika Kumaratunge, leader of the People’s Alliance (PA), first became President in 
1994. After being re-elected in 1999, her term expires in December 2005. Under the constitution, the 
President is Chief Executive, while Parliament retains financial and legislative control. The party that 
controls the legislature nominates the Cabinet of Ministers. Except for a brief interlude in 1994, this is 
the first time in Sri Lankan history there is a President from one party and a legislature controlled by 
another. Both sides are pursuing a strategy of “cohabitation”, with the Prime Minister making key policy 
recommendations to Cabinet, which is chaired by the President. However, the President retains the power 
to dismiss the Government after one year in office. 

10. 
A top priority of the new administration is 
to end the nearly two decade-old civil conflict that 
has placed severe stress on Sri Lanka (see Box 2)3. 
Early on in his administration, the Prime Minister 
revived 
internationally-supported initiatives to 
undertake peace talks with the LTTE. The 
Government and the LTTE announced a cessation 
of hostilities in December 2001 and signed a 
permanent cease-fire in February 2002 under a 
Norwegian-brokered 
Memorandum 
of 
Understanding (MOU). To date, this is the longest 
cease-fire to hold. The Government has removed 
the economic embargo imposed on rebel-held 
areas, lifted restrictions on the movement of 
civilians, rescinded restrictions on fishing and 

Box 2: The Humanitarian Effects of the Conflict 

The conflict in Sri Lanka has led to loss of life, the 
displacement of persons belonging to all ethnic groups and 
the destruction of infrastructure, health care facilities and 
schools. Approximately 2.5 million persons lived in areas 
of direct military a c t i v i t y - 6 5 , 0 0 0 people have been killed, 
800,000 are intemally displaced, including 172,000 living in 
refugee camps and another 700,000 left the country. There 
are 30,000 war widows and an estimated 300,000 displaced 
children in the North East where the school drop out rate is 
double the national average. The infant mortality rate in the 
North East is twice the national average, the matemal 
mortality rate is thrice the national average and 92% of 
malaria deaths are reported from the region. There are an 
estimated 1.8 million landmines in the North-a 
per capita 
incidence comparable to Angola.

accelerated its de-mining program. The military has vacated schools and public buildings in the North 
East and most paramilitary groups have been disarmed. The LTTE has re-opened roads in areas under its 
control for vehicular traffic after a gap of 12 years. It has also opened political offices in military- 
controlled areas in an effort to participate in the political process and has expressed willingness to give up 
its demand for a separate state under certain conditions. An international team monitors the truce and 
approximately 260,000 internally displaced persons (IDPs) have spontaneously returned to their original 
homes since the cease-fire, with more returning daily. 

11. 
The Government de-proscribed the LTTE in September 2002 and Norwegian-facilitated peace 
discussions commenced in Thailand on September 16, 2002. Further discussions were held in October 
2002, December 2002, January 2003 and February 2003. Both sides have agreed to set up mechanisms to 
oversee humanitarian and reconstruction activities in the North East-lead 
by the Sub-committee on 
Immediate Relief and Humanitarian Needs (SIRHN)-and 
on the broad outlines of a future federal 
structure of governance for Sri Lanka. Following the January 2003 discussions, the Bank was invited to 
act as administrator for the North East Reconstruction Fund (NEW) through which humanitarian and 
rehabilitation programs will be implemented (see paragraph 40) in the conflict-affected areas. 

C. Macroeconomic Performance 

12. 
Despite the prolonged civil conflict and several external shocks, Sri Lanka has sustained 
reasonable economic growth of around 5 percent from 1996-2000 (see Table 1). Inflation generally 
declined over this period and through 1998 the current account deficit declined significantly in line with 
strong growth in exports and remittances. This, combined with labor migration (mainly to the Middle 
East and accounting for over 12 percent of the labor force by 2000) reduced unemployment to 7.6 percent 
from rates exceeding 14 percent in the early-1990s.

Sri Lanka has many strengths, including leading developing countries in recognizing the 
importance of education, health and gender equality for development. These, together with one of the 
most open trade and foreign direct investment (FDI) regimes in South Asia, have fostered healthy 
manufacturing production and export performance, especially in tea and textiles. With the successful 
privatization of the plantation sector, Sri Lanka has recaptured its position as the world’s largest tea 
exporter. Benefiting from the liberalization of banking and telecommunications and, until 2001, the 
expansion of tourism and container traffic, the service sector has g rown steadily. Nevertheless, slow 
progress in key structural areas-including 
civil service reform, restructuring state-owned enterprises 
(SOEs), and financial, land and labor market reform-have 
undermined potential growth and slowed 
progress towards reducing poverty. 

14. 
The fiscal situation was an increasing concern throughout the 1990s, with the deficit (before 
grants) remaining between 7-11 percent of GDP and revenue performance weakening by about 4 
percentage points of GDP since 1995. The escalation of the conflict in the late-1990s and the continuing 
expansion of public sector employment compromised expenditure adjustments. Heavy reliance on 
domestic deficit financing-averaging 75 percent of financing needs since 1996-have made interest 
payments one of the largest budget expenditure items, amounting to 6.7 percent of GDP and over 40 
percent of tax revenue in 2001. Hence, important expenditure categories-such as physical and social 
infrastructure-have been crowded out and public debt climbed to over 100 percent of GDP in 2001. 

15. 
Sri Lanka suffered significant economic setbacks in 2001. The change to a floating exchange rate 
regime on January 23 was an important step to stem the loss of external reserves that had started in 2000. 
However, given import demand pressures and high oil prices, by March 31 gross official reserves fell to 
under 2 months of import financing needs. To improve fiscal balances, stabilize the exchange rate and 
reverse reserve losses, the Government entered into a Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) with the 
International Monetary Fund (IMF) on April 204. However, adverse political and economic 
developments in the second half of 2001-including 
the July 24’h attack by the LTTE on the Colombo 
international airport, sluggish external demand, the prolonged drought and the general political 
uncertainty-contributed to derailing the program5. With these shocks, output declined by 1.4 percent in 
2001-the 
first contraction since independence in 1948. In addition, defense spending over-runs and 
fiscal laxity intensified in the run up to the December 2001 elections. 

16. 
In 2002, Sri Lanka began to experience a gradual recovery. The Government presented a strong 
budget in March demonstrating their commitment to growth, fiscal consolidation and structural reform. 
To this end, the goods and services tax (GST) and national security levy (NSL) were transformed into a 
value added tax (VAT), selective expenditure cuts were introduced (including a credible public sector 
hiring freeze), restrictions on FDI were further relaxed and the deficit target was set at 8.5 percent of 
GDP6. The measures have fostered investor confidence, boosted the stock market and doubled capital 
inflows on a cumulative basis. With the return of normal rains and the cessation of hostilities, GDP 
growth turned positive in the first quarter of 2002 and is estimated at about 3 percent for the year, largely 
reflecting a pick-up in domestic-oriented activity since global demand remains sluggish. The 2003 
budget presented on November 6, 2002 maintains continuity of the earlier initiatives.

For more information on the IMF program in Sri Lanka, see the “Fund Relations Note” in Appendix 11. 
The program was subsequently brought back on track and the IMF released the last tranche under the SBA in 
September 2002. 
The estimated 2002 budget deficit of 9 percent is primarily due to less than expected GDP growth and VAT 
exemptions intended to contain upward pressures on the cost of living.

Medium-Term Macroeconomic Prospects 

17. 
Looking ahead, Sri Lanka has a good opportunity to restore macroeconomic stability and achieve 
economic performance commensurate with its human and natural resources. Its medium-term prospects 
for increased GDP growth and sustained fiscal and external sustainability have recently improved due to: 
(i) the positive developments in the peace process; and (ii) the continued implementation of a credible 
program of macroeconomic stabilization and structural reforms. A growth-focused program is being 
implemented to liberalize factor markets, increase agriculture productivity, restructure SOEs, strengthen 
the commercial legal foundations, implement a stable import tariff regime and increase private sector 
participation in infrastructure. Furthermore, steps are being taken to strengthen tax administration and 
fiscal discipline, as well as to refocus the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) to its primary task of price 
stability. A healthy economic revival should result from these developments, along with improving 
investor sentiments, expected reconstruction activities in the North East, improvements in the power 
supply and recovery in agriculture and services. 

18. 
If peace holds and the stabilizatiodstructural reform program stays on track, Sri Lanka can 
achieve 5-7 percent GDP growth with single-digit inflation in the medium-term (see Table 2)'. Regarding 
the fiscal outlook, sustained implementation of the reform program, together with higher GDP growth, 
should lead to gradual reduction of the budget deficit and public debt. This would also create increasingly 
more fiscal space for high priority poverty programs. In an environment of price and political stability, 
business and household formal savings would be encouraged; hence, leading to an increase in the national 
savings rate.

REGAINING SRI LANKA AND CONNECTING TO GROWTH: 
SRI LANKA’S POVERTY REDUCTION STRATEGY 

A . 

Background 

19. 
During the past four years, the administration has engaged in broad stakeholder consultations to 
reach consensus on a medium- to long-term strategy for faster and sustained economic development and 
poverty reduction. The incidence and depth of poverty were widely discussed, along with the country’s 
approach to the problem. The island-wide consultative process also mobilized views of key stakeholders 
on how to work together on relief and rehabilitation in the conflict-affected areas through the Framework 
f o r RelieJ Rehabilitation, and Reconciliation (RRR). The results of these consensus-building 
consultations together with background assessments resulted in a well-developed draft of Sri Lanka’s 
Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS), which development partners strongly endorsed at the June 2002 
Development Forum. 

20. 
After its election, the new Government set about the task of defining its own economic and 
poverty reduction program-Regaining 
Sri Lanka: Vision and Strategy f o r Accelerated Development 
(RSL)-more precisely’. This is an aggressive proposal to eliminate factors which inhibit the restraints 
on private sector activity and change the role of the state, while addressing the key elements of poverty. 
The main objective of the PRS is to “regain Sri Lanka” by accelerating growth and eliminating poverty 
through private sector-led development. This marks a fundamental departure from the previous 
unsustainable policies of “redistribution and transfer’’ to alleviate poverty. To meet its objectives, the 
PRS outlines six core areas: 

Building a supportive macroeconomic environment; 
Reducing conflict-related poverty; 
Creating opportunities for pro-poor growth; 
Investing in people; 
Empowering the poor and strengthening governance; and 
Implementing an effective monitoring and evaluation system. 

0 

21. 
The PRS identifies halving the number of poor by 2015 as its key target. Other targets include: 
(i) raising GDP growth to around 7 percent within three to four years and to 10 percent in the second half 
of the decade; and (ii) creating a minimum of two million new jobs during the next few years. For each 
of the key PRS elements, recently implemented actionsheforms are identified and specific actions to be 
implemented over the medium-term are outlined and prioritized (see Annex B 10). 

B. 

Building a Supportive Macroeconomic Environment 

22. 
Creating the conditions for accelerating economic growth with macroeconomic stability is a top 
priority of the PRS. Sri Lanka has not been able to achieve economic growth consistent with its human 
and natural resource endowments. In part, this below potential performance has been due to the conflict, 
however, there is also a need to remove distortions in the economy and reform the enabling environment 
to foster private sector development. The PRS identifies highly inflexible labor laws, constraints on land 
transfers and sizes, inadequate infrastructure, a largehnefficient SOE sector, bureaucracy and a serious 
bottleneck in tertiary education as key factors contributing to a high cost of doing business. Further, it 
proposes to address a variety of legal, institutional and regulatory impediments which hamper private 
sector activity.

Page 8 of 31 

23. 
Recognizing that macroeconomic stability is a sine qua non for sustained high economic growth, 
strong emphasis has also been placed on fiscal sustainability and strengthening the macroeconomic 
framework. Significant reductions in the budget deficit and public debt are planned to restore fiscal 
sustainability and strengthen macroeconomic stability. Currently, interest payments, the salary/wage bill, 
defense spending and subsidies/transfers account for most of the budgetary expenditures, leaving small 
amounts for capital expenditures-less 
than 5 percent of GDP-and 
negligible amounts for non-wage 
repairshnaintenance. The medium-term objective is to reduce the budget deficit to 5 percent of GDP by 
2005 and public debt to below 90 percent of GDP. Aside from the fiscal measures, some of the structural 
reforms initiated under the program-Le., 
those pertaining to SOEs and administered prices-will 
contribute to the fiscal consolidation and deficivdebt reduction effort. To ensure that fiscal discipline is 
maintained and fiscal consolidation continues, the Government recently enacted the Fiscal Management 
Responsibility Act, which requires regular reporting on the budget and also mandates a “Pre-election 
Budgetary Position’’ report to discourage pre-election hand-outs. The Act also sets strict limits on 
borrowing from the Central Bank and fixes the 2006 budget deficit target at below 5 percent of GDP. 

24. 
In 
the 
PRS, 
domestic 
economic 
liberalization 
and 
strengthening 
the 
enabling 
environment are seen as key 
to 
fostering private sector-led growth. 
Emphasis has been placed on 
reforming 
factor markets; most 
notably, labor, land and financial (see 
Box 3 ) . Recently amendments were 
passed to increase flexibility in the 
labor market, thereby enhancing labor 
mobility, 
productivity 
and 
employment generation’. For a more 
efficiently functioning land market, 
preparations are underway to clarify 
property rights and modernize the 
institutional framework. Efforts are 
being made 
to establish a 
legal 
framework 
to 
remove 
restrictions 
related to the sale, leasing, transfer 
and mortgaging of 
rural 
lands 
previously distributed to farmers. It is 
&o likel; that state-owned urban land will be divested to raise resources and promote more efficient use 
of urban land. 

Box 3: Constraints in the Labor and Land Markets 
Well-functioning labor and land markets are pre-requisites for 
economic growth, but currently in Sri Lanka there are constraints in both 
which inhibit development. 
In labor, formal workers are protected by laws such as the 
Termination of Employment of Workmen Act (TEWA, 1971) and the 
Industrial Disputes Act (1950). Under TEWA (applying to private sector 
firms with 15 or more employees), the termination of any worker is only 
possible with the prior written consent of the Commissioner of Labor or the 
employee concerned. The Commissioner has the discretion to accept or 
reject a firm’s application and has the prerogative to determine the exact 
compensation to be paid. As such, smaller firms have no incentive to 
graduate and larger firms are reluctant to hire additional workers. 
The majority of land in Sri Lanka is state-owned and controlled, 
but farmed by private farmers under varying tenure arrangements most of 
which permit private use and inheritance, but restrict lease and sale. The 
Land Reform Act (1970) nationalized private land holdings in excess of 50 
acres and redistributed them to small-holder tenants in perpetuity, placing a 
ceiling on tenant farms of five acres. Furthermore, the deeds registration 
system places cumbersome burdens on private land owners in the rural 
sector and private lands are also affected by land use restrictions*.g., 
the 
Paddy Lands Act does not allow paddy land to be used for non-paddy 
cultivation without Govemment permission. All these factors together 
impede the efficient use of land. 

25. 
The PRS aims to improve financial intermediation by restructuring the state-owned banks-the 
Bank of Ceylon (BOC) and People’s Bank (PB) account for over 50 percent of banking sector assets- 
increasing private sector participation in the insurance and pension fund industry and strengthening the 
regulatory and supervisory framework in financial markets. To improve the enabling environment for 
private activity, steps will be taken to: (i) move towards a uniform/lower and transparent corporate tax 

9 

These amendments-not yet effective-require 
the Labor Commissioner to apply a new compensation formula for job 
termination cases and expedite redundancyflabor dispute-related hearings and determinations according to a time- 
bound labor dispute settlement rule. 

SRI L AN K 4 Country Assistance Strategy 

Page 9 of 31 

structure; (ii) modernize the legalhegulatory environment for market entry and exit; (iii) establish a 
modem, unified tax administration; and (iv) reduce and rationalize tariff protection. 

26 . 
Sri Lanka has a significant number of large SOEs involved in commercial activities, including 
utilities, transport, banking, petroleum and the wholesale of basic commodities. The PRS concludes that 
these SOEs have been a drag on the economy and burden on the budget”, and have failed to deliver 
reliable and affordable goods and services. Consequently, the PRS proposes to continue the privatization 
program in most commercial activities, while undertaking restructuring of some of the large SOEs and 
encouraging private sector participation in infrastructure. For example, in petroleum some of the Ceylon 
Petroleum Corporation’s (CPC) assets are being divested and steps are being taken to open importation, 
distribution and retail activities to the private sector. In power, legislation is proposed to: (i) unbundle 
generation, transmission and distribution; (ii) break-up Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB); and (iii) establish 
an independent regulatory body with responsibility for implementing economically sound tariff policy, 
regulating the sector and issuing licenses. 

27. 
About 80 percent of Sri Lanka’s population and 90 percent of the country’s poor live in rural 
areas. Despite its declining contribution to GDP (20 percent in 2000), the agricultural sector (including 
livestock and fisheries) remains vital for employment and income generation. Thus, fostering rapid rural 
development-particularly 
raising productivity and competitiveness in agriculture and the non-farm rural 
sector-is critical for achieving faster overall economic growth and poverty reduction. As such, the PRS 
gives high priority to rural development and measures are being taken to remove policy/institutional 
constraints, including the on-going reforms in labor and land administration and policy. Other key 
elements of the rural development strategy include: (i) rationalizing the trade regime for agricultural 
outputs, inputs and technology; (ii) gradually reducing state involvement in agricultural marketing; and 
( i i i ) supporting improvements in rural infrastructure-Le., 
roads, electricity, communications and water 
and sanitation-to 
facilitate connectivity and integration. 

C. 

Reducing Conflict-Reluted Poverty 

28. 
As indicated, Sri Lanka’s protracted 
conflict has 
resulted 
in a significant 
humanitarian problem. Establishing lasting 
peace is viewed as the key to reducing 
conflict-related poverty and as such, a 
critical element of Sri Lanka’s PRS. To this 
end, the Government is pursuing a three- 
pronged 
approach 
consisting of: 
negotiating a political settlement; 
(ii) 
enacting constitutional reforms to fulfill the 
aspirations of all citizens; and 
(iii) 
expediting development in the conflict- 
affected areas (see Box 4). The RRR 
Framework will help to address the basic 
needs of the people affected by the conflict, 
improve conditions for the resumption of 
economic activities and facilitate ethnic 
reconciliation. The Government has been 
actively engaged with donors to mobilize 

( i ) 

Box 4: T h e Bank’s Activities in t h e North East 
Since 1999, the Bank has been a leader in assisting development of 
to the North East (NE). The NE Irrigated Agriculture Project 
(NEIAP; 1999) has been active in conflict-affected areas supporting 
community-driven efforts to rebuild economic activity and the 2001 
Land Mine Action Project (a US$1 million Post Conflict Fund 
Grant administered by UNDP) has been supporting de-mining 
activities. In mid-2002, the Bank developed a three-phase strategy 
for comprehensive reconstruction support to the NE. In the first 
phase, we are redirecting, expediting, and scaling-up activities in 
the NE in those projects which focus on the entire country, but 
activities could not be carried ou t in the NE because of the conflict. 
Approximately US$15 million was identified through four projects. 
In the second phase, certain projects-with 
significant savings 
and/or where 
project components will not meet development 
objectives by closing-have been restructured to provide additional 
urgently needed support to the reconstruction efforts. US$3 1 
million was identified in three operations and a restructuring 
package was approved by the Board on November 14, 2002. In the 
third phase, a longer-term program to meet the development needs 
of the NE is being addressed in the context of this CAS. 
In 
addition, the Bank will administer the North East Reconstruction 
Fund (NERF)-the main vehicle for implementing humanitarian 
and rehabilitation programs in the NE.

SOE losses equaled 1.5 percent of GDP in 2000 and budgetary (recurrent and capital) transfers to SOEs amounted to 3 
percent of GDP in 2001.

financial support for immediate humanitarian and rehabilitation needs in the North East. A donor 
conference was held in Oslo on November 25, 2002 and will be followed by an international donor 
meeting in Tokyo on June 9-10,2003. 

D. 

Creating Opportunities f o r Pro-Poor Growth 

29. 
Another priority of the PRS is to effectively connect poor regions to rapidly growing domestic 
and international markets. The strategy focuses on six main pro-poor transport and communications 
initiatives, specifically: ( i ) upgrading the port network; (ii) building a national highway system and 
integrated road network; (iii) enhancing performance of the bus system; (iv) modernizing the railways; (v) 
improving access to telecommunications facilities; and (vi) bringing internet into the countryside. The 
strategy in this area is to introduce public-private partnerships to expand the scope for investment and 
provide a wider range of services-especially in areas such as energy, ports, water supply and transport- 
to the public. 

E . 

Investing in People 

30. 
Improving access to quality education and basic health services is central to the PRS and the 
strategy promotes a growing private sector role in their provision. In education, the focus will be on: ( i ) 
addressing regional inequities in the provision of quality basic education; (ii) improving the curricula in 
secondary education; and ( i i i ) enhancing the relevance of tertiary education in line with market needs, 
including increasing capacity by opening up to the private sector. In healthhutrition, the goals are to: ( i) 
improve the nutritional status of infants, children and pregnant women; (ii) maintain a low incidence of 
non-communicable diseases; (iii) reduce the burden of vector-borne diseases, including malaria; and ( iv ) 
fight AIDS. The overall objective is to improve the equity, efficiency and effectiveness of health 
expenditures and the main focus will be on preventive health care programs and encouraging the private 
sector to develop secondary and tertiary care private hospitals. Capitalizing on Sri Lanka’s long-standing 
strengths in social mobilization, there will be reliance on community-based organizations (CBOs) to 
expand the provision of safe drinking water and sanitation services in rural areas under a sustainable 
system of tariff setting and maintenance. In urban areas, the private sector will be encouraged to play an 
increasing role in these activities. 

F . 

Empowering the Poor and Strengthening Governance 

3 1. 
Another thrust of the PRS is to change the role of the state from being a “provider” of goods and 
services to being a “facilitator” of private sector activity. As such, there is commitment to reducing state 
involvement in commercial activities and focus on primary activities and responsibilities in providing 
public gooddservices and using public resources more effectively for poverty reduction. To this end, 
there is a need to: (i) reform public administration; (ii) improve transparency and accountability; and (iii) 
continue decentralization. As mentioned, public expenditure management needs to be strengthened, 
including expenditure planninghudgeting, execution, monitoringhontrol and oversight. At the same 
time, to empower the poor, the intention is to shift the focus of authority from the central to local 
Governments. Efforts will be placed on strengthening the management capacities of local Governments 
to ensure that they play a more effective role in meeting locally-defined initiatives and discharging 
devolved responsibilities. 

G . 

Assessment of the PRS 

32. 
As indicated in the B a n W Joint Staff Assessment (JSA), Sri Lanka’s Poverty Reduction 
Strategy is broadly appropriate for addressing the country’s current economic development and poverty 
reduction challenges and provides a sound foundation for the Bank’s assistance. The PRS candidly lists 

SRI L A N K A Country Assistance Strategy 

Page I 1 of 31 

the causes of poverty. Aside from the civil conflict, it correctly identifies the highly restrictive 
controls/regulations that have inhibited the functioning of the domestic factor markets and rural economy 
as principal causes of Sri Lanka’s below potential performance. 
It acknowledges that the heavy 
involvement of the state in commercial activities has constrained private sector development and 
economic growth. Particularly important is the recognition that the policy of redistributiodtransfers 
pursued so far to reduce poverty has been ineffective. As mentioned, the PRS envisions a role for the 
state as that of: ( i ) facilitator of an enabling environment for private sector-led growth; and (ii) creating 
opportunities for the poor to participate in the growth process. The latter is to be achieved through greater 
public expenditure devoted to human resource development and infrastructure. The PRS also calls for 
smaller and better targeted safety net programs. Given the large public debt and the tight fiscal situation, 
the PRS correctly indicates that the pace at which the reform agenda can be implemented depends on the 
fiscal space that can be created by economic growth, the restoration of peace, macroeconomic stability 
and concessional assistance. 

33. 
This said, the JSA points out a number of areas in which the PRS could be strengthened; 
specifically: 

0 

There is nothing with regard to institutionalizing a public sector tracking system; 
Although there is a comprehensive picture of the patterns and determinants of poverty, further 
work is warranted to monitor and assess the impact of current and future fiscal policies on the poor; 
The poverty diagnostics for the North East is inadequate and needs to be improved; and 
There is a need to enhance institutional arrangements to coordinate monitoring and evaluation 
and promote incentives for its use in policy and budgetary decision-making. 

0 

0 

34. 
These all underscore the tremendous capacity building needs in the country, especially as they 
relate to measuring, analyzing, monitoring and evaluating poverty reduction outcomes. 
It is 
recommended that the first annual progress report of the PRS include: (i) an update of the macroeconomic 
framework and prioritization of policies aligned to a detailed costing of the PRS agenda; (ii) addressing 
critical issues in the governance agenda, especially in civil service reform, transparency and 
decentralization; (iii) a selection of indicators and baselines to monitor PRS implementation and setting 
up an expenditure tracking system; ( iv ) a preliminary assessment of the impact of policies on the poor and 
disadvantaged groups; and (v ) completing the poverty assessment and reconstruction needs of the North 
and East.

THE BANK GROUP’S COUNTRY ASSISTANCE STRATEGY 

A . 

The Bank Group’s Country Assistance Strategy f o r FY03-FY06 

35. 
The CAS program is built on the Poverty Reduction Strategy contained in Regaining Sri Lunku: 
Vision and Strategy for Accelerated Development. Within this, the Bank will focus on three core themes: 
Peace, Growth and Equity. Without peace, there is no prospect for development. This derives not only 
from the difficulty of creating a framework for sustainable poverty reduction and growth in such a 
situation, but also that the fiscal burden would likely become increasingly intolerable, and the most 
vulnerable of the poor in today’s society-the 
conflict-affected and displaced populations-would not be 
reached. Growth is the key to prosperity and to creating more resources for distribution. The Regaining 
Sri Lanka strategy is the Government’s response to the poor recent growth performance, and answers one 
of the Bank’s key concerns over the earlier drafts of the PRS. Equity concerns will remain high in Sri 
Lanka, not only to permit the expected attainment of the MDGs, but more to ensure balance within the 
society. Education and health have made great strides, but access varies sharply across the country and 

SRI L AN K 4 C o u n t r y A s s i s tance S t ra tegy 

P a g e 12 of 31 

quality is a major concern. Furthermore, the South faces many natural disadvantages and growth has 
lagged behind other parts of the country. The explicit links between the PRS core areas and the CAS 
priority outcomes by theme are contained in Table 3.

36. 
In designing the CAS program, wide consultations have been undertaken both within and outside 
the Bank (see Appendix IV). The CAS is explicitly drawn on the fact that Sri Lanka is a post-conflict 
country, and thus incorporates three key conclusions from the experience of such countries: 

SRI L AN K A Country Assistance Strategy 

Page 13 of 31 

There is a strong case for increased assistance in the period following the end of hostilities, 
although the maximum impact is likely to be felt two to four years after such a cessation; 
There are good prospects for addressing key economic and social reforms in such a situation, 
even those that have proven difficult in the past; and 
The highest returns may be found in social aspects of development. 

37. 
The CAS has been drawn up as a Bank Group strategy with the full participation of IFC. As will 
be seen below, there could be substantial synergies between the different arms of the Bank Group. In 
addition, an important cross-cutting theme of the CAS is capacity building. First of all, for the conflict- 
affected areas to “catch up” with the rest of the country, strengthening capacity in the region is as 
important as the physical reconstruction efforts. Furthermore, given the finalization of the PRS and 
results-orientation of the CAS, there is a critical need to focus on building capacity both for successful 
program implementation, as well as for effective monitoring and evaluation. While the World Bank 
Institute (WBI) will play a leading role in these efforts, strengthening institutional capacity is an 
important element in many IDA lending and non-lending activities. 

Peace 

38. 
As mentioned, peace is the very basis for the future of the Sri Lankan economy and for balanced 
poverty reduction. The key outcomes that the CAS is designed to support (see Table 3) include: ( i) 
restored infrastructure in health, education and irrigation; and (ii) technical capacity built to implement 
the reconstruction and poverty reduction efforts. 

39. 
There is a huge need for reconstruction and capacity building and to address the fiscal support 
needs generated by the peace process. It is important that the population begins to see the gains from 
peace at an early stage and that resources are in place to permit resettlement to occur. The Bank has 
already begun this process with the restructuring of the por tfo l io , which was approved by the Board on 
November 14, 2002. This restructuring affected seven on-going projects and mobilized US$46 million in 
extra resources for the North and East, some 17 percent of our undisbursed portfolio. 
In total 
approximately US$62 m i l l ion -o r over 25 percent of the existing undisbursed portfolio-will 
be 
available for this region of the country. The restructuring provides resources for health, water supply, 
capacity building, connectivity, and payments to returning IDPs, in what is referred to as the North East 
Emergency Reconstruction Program. This supplements the on-going work in community development 
and irrigated agriculture (through NEIAP), education, the legal system and environment. Furthermore, 
the Bank will contribute to the reconciliation effort in particular through the on-going education projects 
by assisting the Government in its strategy to: (i) develop English as a way to eliminate language-based 
segregation, while encouraging Sinhalese and Tamil as “second” languages-Le., 
native Sinhalese 
speakers to learn Tamil and native Tamil speakers to learn Sinhalese; and (ii) formulate curricula, 
textbooks and pedagogic approaches that foster pluralism, tolerance and social cohesion. 

40. 
In addition, the North and East have been starved of investment for the past 20 years. Poverty 
levels are unknown, but appear to be among the highest in the country. After the immediate 
reconstruction, there is 20 years of deferred maintenance and postponed investment that will need to be 
addressed. It is likely that many development partners will be willing to participate in these efforts. The 
Bank will work with these partners, both on the planned needs assessment in FY03”, and also in the 
design and implementation of further support programs for infrastructure and for capacity building. 
Many donors are willing to increase their assistance to Sri Lanka in the short-term to support 

I 1

The Bank is leading the efforts in preparing the housing needs assessment and is working closely with UNICEF on 
education, as well as co-financing the team leader with UNDP. The needs assessments will provide background for the 
June 2003 Tokyo Financing Conference for Sri Lanka. 

SRI L A N K A Country Ass is tance Strategy

reconstruction and rehabilitation. For this purpose, the North East Reconstruction Fund (NERF) has 
been created and the Bank will act as its administrator. In the Bank’s lending program, a Credit for 

Znfrastructure Rehabilitation and Capacity Building in the N E is proposed for early-FYO5, but its size 

and timing would be determined to a significant degree by absorptive capacity issues and by the level and 
timing of commitments from other development partners. This operation would be flexible, and thus able 
to respond to a variety of needs in infrastructure, capacity and perhaps in land management, with the 
Bank acting as the “lender of last resort”. A key feature would be to utilize such an operation to 
encourage the local private sector, especially in the area of contracting. 

41. 

An issue that has not yet been addressed is that of disarmament, demobilization and reintegration 
(DDR) of combatants. The two sides are not yet ready to discuss demobilization, and thus it is difficult to 
assess whether it will be necessary for the Bank to consider a role in this regard. Initial discussions in 
partnership with the International Labor Organization ( L O ) have taken place and this will be kept under 
close review. 

Growth 

42. 

At the core of RSLJPRS is the desire to raise the rate of growth and to rejuvenate the private 
sector by removing the policy constraints that are inhibiting the achievement of these objectives. The 
CAS strongly supports the Government’s view that it is imperative that the peace process be accompanied 
by an equally determined economic reform process to unleash the strong potential of the economy. As 
such, the key CAS outcomes (see Table 3) to be achieved include: ( i ) legal frameworks established to 
increase flexibility in the labor and land markets; (ii) a regulatory environment conducive to private sector 
participation established; (iii) the time and formal cost of business start-up reduced; and ( iv ) agricultural 
producers receiving more consistent price signals and clearer land title. 

43. 
A key component of any poverty reduction and growth scenario for Sri Lanka must be a sound 
macroeconomic environment. As mentioned, the conflict has resulted in high fiscal deficits, leading to an 
accumulation of over 100 percent of GDP in public debt and domestic debt of 58 percent of GDP. 
Restoration of fiscal stability is at the center of the macroeconomic program to be supported by the IMF 
Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF)-an 
important basis for the Bank-supported program. 

44. 
In FY03, the Bank’s initial support to this process will come through the Economic Reform 
Technical Assistance Project which was presented to the Board on December 10, 2002. This will 
provide the technical support that is needed to implement the ambitious program. It is designed to be 
flexible, in order to be able to respond to reform opportunities as they emerge. An initial group of reform 
areas-including 
financial sector, utilities and regulatory capacity building-have been identified, but the 
allocation of the majority of funds will be determined over the next three to four years and will likely 
include assistance to prepare a public sector reform program. As mentioned below (see paragraph 65), 
this project will also support capacity building efforts to strengthen the country’s poverty monitoring and 
evaluation ability. This project accompanies the on-going Legal and Judicial Reform which is 
supporting the modernization of the legal system, especially as it impacts on the private sector, and with a 
special emphasis on improving the quality of judicial services. A particular focus is access to justice for 
women and for the citizens of the North East through a Japan Social Development Fund (JSDF) grant. 

45. 

The completed PRS provides the basis to proceed with Poverty Reduction Support Credits 
(PRSCs) in Sri Lanka. Annual PRSCs would provide budgetary support to assist in the implementation 
of the PRS, not least to permit government to provide public services in previously unserved areas. At 
the heart of the PRS is a program to release the private sector from its constraints, and to reorient public 
expenditure away from a welfare and control mentality towards an empowerment and service provision 
approach. While the PRSCs would review the overall progress in the implementation of the PRS 

SR I L A N K A Country Assistance Strategy 

Page 15 of 31 

program, there would also be an annual focus on particular areas of the strategy where deeper progress 
would be targeted. In the first of these-planned 
for FY03-the 
focus would be on factors of production: 
finance, labor, land and utilities; the elements of the PRS described in paragraphs 24-26 above”. 

46. 
The financial sector has received a lot of past Bank attention, with an on-going operation to 
support the strengthening of the Central Bank and a recently-completed Financial Sector Assessment 
Program (FSAP). Following up on vulnerabilities revealed in the FSAP with regard to anti-money 
laundering and counter-terrorism financing, in the coming years the Bank will provide technical 
assistance for capacity building and formulatiodimplementation of an appropriate legal framework. 
Nevertheless, the primary obstacle to the healthy development of the financial sector remains the 
dominance of the state banking system, whose reform would be central to this program. Labor markets 
have long been identified as a major constraint to investment, and the program would focus on improving 
certainty for employers in such areas as the costs and timing of redundancy, while improving the 
functioning of the market itself through better information centers. Land markets are to be improved 
through converting restricted land grants to freehold so that farmers can more readily sell, lease or use 
their land as collateral. The reform of the power and telecommunications sectors calls for greater 
regulatory capacity and a change in the role of the state, and this too would form a part of the early 
program to be supported. Last and by no means least, the first year of implementation of the PRS would 
see a strong emphasis of monitoring and evaluation mechanisms for the PRS itself through various 
capacity building efforts. In this regard, lack of a medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF) has 
made the costing of PRS initiatives difficult. The development of a MTEF-aided by public expenditure 
analysis-which 
the Government plans to have in place by mid-2003, is key to a more in-depth costing of 
the PRS, thereby helping to undertake pro-poor budget allocations over time, and the Bank will provide 
any necessary support for this effort. 

47. 
The second PRSC would be in FY04 and might focus on two key areas for the poverty agenda- 
the reform o f t h e welfare system into one which is much more tightly focused on those in need, and 
reform of the rural economy, in particular to raise the productivity of farmers, who remain the poorest 
sector of the economy. The greatest challenge in this regard is to de-politicize and improve the targeting 
of Samurdhi-largely 
a cash transfer program-based 
on the recently enacted Welfare Reform Act that 
sets objective criteria for selection of beneficiaries through means-testing and tracking. These reforms are 
expected to engender better targeting with lower exclusion of deserving beneficiaries. In the third 
PRSC-in FYOS-attention would turn to the public sector itself, with a focus on the reform of public 
sector employment systems and structures, and the related structure of public expenditure, including the 
issues of decentralization of decision-making and revenue-sharing. It is likely that the implementation of 
this public sector reform would need to be accompanied by a Technical Assistance Credit to support the 
complex technical work associated with public sector restructuring (including retraining re-deployed 
staff) and developing a comprehensive program for strengthening public sector capacity. If this reform 
program is ready sooner it could be incorporated into the second PRSC. The specific theme of the fourth 
PRSC in FY06 would be determined on the basis of the outcome of the Development Policy Review 
(DPR), but could well focus on the management and efficiency of public expenditure. 

48. 
To accompany this work, a continuous program of Public Expenditure Review (PER) work is 
planned, again with annual themes. Rather than producing a large report, this work would result in 

12 

Obviously, the reforms receiving “focus” in each of the PRSCs will not be completed in a single year, but will take 
time for complete imp lemen ta t ion-e .g . , the land and labor reforms highlighted in the first PRSC. When a reform is a 
“focus” area in one PRSC, it is likely that additional milestones to “cement” the reform will be featured in subsequent 
PRSCs-Le., 
as discussed in paragraph 47, labor and land issues also figure prominently in reforming the rural 
economy, and therefore, follow up actions in these areas will likely figure prominently in the second PRSC. 

SUI L A N K A Country Assistance Strategy 

Page 16 of 31 

complement and build on the work of the Country Financicrl Accountability Assessment (CFAA) and the 
Country Procurement Assessment Review (OAR)-both 

smaller outputs that can be incorporated into the living PRS as implementation  proceed^'^. This would 
to be completed in FY03 14-and would form 
the basis for a future program of technical support to reform the fiduciary framework. These would be 
summarized in a Safeguards Assessment Paper that would also incorporate the current state of 
knowledge on Sri Lanka’s management of environmental and social safeguards, and would accompany 
the first PRSC to the Board. 

49. While addressing the policy issues through budgetary and technical support can remove many of 
the constraints inhibiting the private sector, it is also important to contemplate the sources of growth. 
This will be addressed in part by two proposed non-lending pieces. The first of these would be an 
assessment of the Investment Climate carried out during 2003 and 2004 in cooperation with the Asian 
Development Bank (ADB) and the United Nations Development Program (UNDP). In addition to the 
standard work on the climate for “urban” investment, given the importance of encouraging off-farm 
employment opportunities in rural areas, this would incorporate a “rural investment climate” component. 
In addition, after the initial reform process has had a chance to eliminate the most obvious constraints, the 
Bank would conduct a Development Polzky Review, with a particular focus on future sources of growth. 
It is clear that the economy will be going through major changes in the corning years, both because of the 
potential for new areas of growth and the likely decline of the garment industry after the end of the 
current Multi-Fibre Arrangement (MFA) in 2005. The PRS makes a start in this direction by outlining 
detailed action plans for raising productivity in priority sectors-i.e., 
agriculture, fisheries, tourism, 
apparel and the tea industry. However, the PRS does not analyze the links between these sectors and 
poverty-related outcomes, which is critical for prioritizing policies that promote pro-poor growth. It is 
also important to increase the availability of financing to support the growth of the private sector. IFC 
will take the lead role here, making direct investments in medium and large-scale companies and building 
the capacity of the financial sector to finance private enterprises-especially for small and medium 
enterprises (SMEs)-through 
investments and technical assistance. 

50. 
One area that is considered by many to have significant potential for fostering growth both on its 
own and by raising productivity in other sectors is the Znformation Communications Technology (ICT) 
sector. This is an important focus of the Government’s development policy and the Bank would provide 
support to this effort in FYO4-through E-Lanka-emphas iz ing the policy and regulatory environment, 
the development of e-government, rural connectivity and societal applications. There seems to be great 
potential for Sri Lanka to follow India as a major player in this market and this operation would be 
designed to help “jump start” this activity. A related operation would be the proposed Improving 

Relevance and Quality of Undergraduate Education Project (ZRQUE), which would both increase the 

supply of in-demand skills-such as those in Information Technology (IT)-while 
also equipping recent 
graduates with basic employment requirements, including English language skills. IFC will also consider 
investments in ICT companies. 

51. 
Another issue that impacts on growth and also on the durability of the peace process and the 
achievement of equality of opportunity is Land Administration and Po l icy . It will be important to absorb 
the lessons of the L a m i n g and Innovation Loan ( L a ) currently under implementation and decide 
whether the experience justifies a “scaling up” into a major operation, that might include key aspects of 

13 

14 

One particularly pressing issue to be covered by the PER work relates to the increased IDA lending volumes provided 
through program support and Sri Lanka’s potential near-term graduation from IDA concessional lending (see paragraph 
88 below). Specifically, given the already high levels o f debt servicing, in the near future this work will focus on 
helping Sri Lanka start to prepare-i.e., with regard to formulating a sustainable debt strategy-for 
the phasing out o f 
large volumes of concessional financing. 

See Appendix V for a summary of the findings of these reports. 

SRI LA N K A Country Ass is tance Strategy 

Page I 7 of 31 

land policy, not the least of which is the massive holdings of land by the Government in both urban and 
rural areas. This analysis would be done in FY05, and if a positive evaluation of the learning experience 
emerges, it could be followed by a scaled up project in FY06. 

52. Without rural growth, the prospects for sustained poverty reduction are unclear. However, while 
land policy is a clear case, it is less clear how the Government proposes to address more general issues 
related to agriculture and rural development. For instance, while the PRS advocates private sector-driven 
productivity improvements, the action plan appears to advocate continued state interventions. The 
strategy would also benefit from refinements to address important systemic issues such as improving 
linkages between federal and provincial-level agencies and making lead institutions-such 
as the 
Department of Agriculture-more 
responsive to sector demands. Policy issues would be addressed 
through the PRSC framework, and the on-going Mahaweli project will continue to implement important 
pilot programs in areas such as bulk water and river basin management. The Government has asked that 
the Bank support the agricultural sector through lending. Based on recently completed work-Sri Lanka: 
Promoting Agricultural and Rural Non-Farm Sector Growth, Report No. 25387-CE, February 2003-and 
work contemplated for the future, should a reasonable proposal emerge, the program would be adjusted 
accordingly. Nevertheless, while there is a land management problem in the wet zone, there is a water 
management problem in the dry zone. If the pilots progress well and the on-going irrigation management 
reforms are completed, this could be followed by lending support later in the CAS period. 

53. 
In the base case, IDA would not finance infrastructure. The two largest external providers of 
financing-the 
Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) and ADB-are willing to continue to 
finance the key programs in roads, energy and water supply. In the spirit of selectivity, IDA will 
participate only with respect to supporting key reforms and potentially private participation in 
infrastructure. If the Government does proceed with advanced reforms in areas such as urban water, 
railways, roads financing and ports, and succeeds in attracting private participation, in a high case 
scenario-in which these reforms are explicit triggers-IDA would consider participating through 
lending and/or guarantees. While generally limited to supporting cases where private financing would be 
attracted, one possible exception would be the highways sub-sector. Should the Government develop a 
viable Road Fund, the Bank would investigate participating through a sector-wide operation. Support for 
private infrastructure will be a top priority for IFC and is a primary area of potential synergy between 
IDA, IFC and MIGA, with scope for a creative combination of the instruments available to the three 
institutions if the policy environment is right. In the meantime, IFC will continue to look for investment 
opportunities 
in 
this area, beyond 
its existing 
investments 
in power, ports and mobile 
telecommunications. 

Equity 

54 . While Sri Lanka has made remarkable strides in the area of human development over the last 
decades, serious equity issues remain-Le., 
equality of opportunity and access to services. Access to and 
the quality of services in Sri Lanka differ greatly from one area to another. As such, equity issues are 
very important in a country where the resource base is not evenly distributed and where groups of citizens 
have been mired in poverty for a long time. Key CAS outcomes (see Table 3) focus on: (i) improved 
access to and quality of public services in education, health and water supply; and (ii) increased degree of 
empowerment of communities to address their own development needs. 

55. 
As noted, a new household income and expenditure survey (HIES) is under way, which will 
include the North and East where many citizens suffer from conflict-related poverty. Once this new 
information is available, the Bank will work with the authorities to draw up a poverty map of Sri Lanka 
and collaboratively produce an Updated Poverty Assessment. This would start in FY04 and be finalized 
in FY05. While many policy reforms have been outlined in the PRS, a mechanism to monitor and assess 

SRI L A N K A Country Assistance Strategy 

Page 18 of 31 

their impact is largely lacking. It is difficult to judge a priori whether these reforms will reduce poverty 
or have their intended impact. In this context, using the new national household data and other sources to 
analyze the poverty and social impact of reforms, as well as building similar capacity within Sri Lanka, 
remains a critical exercise for the future. This would be a focus of the Bank’s contribution to the joint 
poverty work. Other early sector work would stress the MDGs and what is needed to attain these-and 
beyond-in Sri Lanka. 

56. While the North and East suffer from conflict-related poverty, the South-notably Uva and 
Southern Province-suffers 
from structural poverty. The resource endowment of these areas is limited, 
water is scarce, distances are great and the human resource endowment is the lowest of those that are 
known. Under the on-going Mahaweli project, the Government has carried out community-driven 
development (CDD) pilots that have worked very well. NEIAP operates very successfully under similar 
principles and there are numerous other examples of this type of approach in Sri Lanka. Thus, the 
Ministry of Rural Economy has proposed that IDA undertake a Rural Poverty Reduction Initiative, under 
which poor communities in the South would be mobilized to analyze their key constraints-Le., 
rural 
roads, water supply, income-generating activities, etc.-and 
resources provided directly to these 
communities to address those constraints. This process is one that would be scaled up gradually and 
would need support over a long period of time. An Adaptable Program Lending approach will be 
utilized, under which IDA would commit support in phases for 10-12 years, and the scope of the coverage 
would be gradually expanded from the South to include all the poorest parts of the country, including the 
estate/plantation sector. The results of the rural investment climate study will be useful for this operation. 
Nevertheless, one important service many rural communities place great emphasis on is water supply and 
a Second Community Water project has recently been n eg~ t i a t ed ’~ . It is envisaged that this operation 
will make a transition into a CDD approach over its lifetime, developing the locally-based expertise to 
support village level managed investments. 

57. 
One of the key questions facing Sri Lanka with respect to access to services is the growth of 
urbanization and the related issue of Servicesfor the Urban Poor. It is one of the key issues within the 
more general issue of decentralization, but with a set of rather specific features of its own. The 
Government has begun working to address urban policy issues and obviously the eventual outcome of the 
peace process-which will define more accurately the concept of “asymmetrical devolution”-will 
shape 
future policy in this regard in key ways. In preparation for a possible lending operation in FY06, a 
strategic options study, including fiscal decentralization issues, would be conducted in FY04. 
It is 
possible that CDD approaches would be adapted to the urban framework for an operation in this area. 

58. 
In the sub-sectors related to equity concerns, it is very important that investment interventions be 
based on sound analytical frameworks. A Health Sector Strategy and program formulation exercise is 
under way, using a Policy and Human Resource Development (PHRD) grant. This would lead to the first 
proposed sector-wide operation for Sri Lanka in the Health Sector in FY04. This would supplement the 
National HIV/AIDs Prevention operation that was approved on December 17, 2002 and aims to build 
awareness of the risks of the pandemic, while improving capacity to address its most frequent 
manifestation in Sri Lanka, in tuberculosis’6. The comprehensiveness of this sector-wide approach is 
expected to deepen over time, and one key area that is not being addressed with the current health sector 

15 

16 

Given the severity of the poverty in the South and the CDD approach to be used, as well as the emphasis placed on 
water supply by rural communities, the Rural Poverty Reduction Initiative and the Second Community Water Project 
will be entirely financed by IDA grants. 

Although mention of HIV/AIDs is made with regard to the health context, it is well-recognized that this issue is more 
appropriately an overall development issue. As such, an important aspect of the recently approved operation is to 
strengthen multi-sectoral involvement-i.e., 
the Ministries of Health, Defense, Labor, Education, Child Protection and 
Interior-and 
capacity on the fundamentals of HIV prevention. 

SRI L A N K A Country Assistance Strategy

work is that of Nutrition. Joint analytical work would be carried out, for later incorporation to the health 
sector program. Furthermore, IFC has already invested in a private hospital in Colombo and would 
continue to look for opportunities to support the private provision of health services. 

59. 

Similarly, i t has been agreed with the Ministry of Education that there would be a Strategic 

Framework Exercise f o r the Education Sector launched in 2004 and followed by a possible Education 

Sector Operation in FY05. Under this and the health sector operation, the Bank would provide financial 
support to the overall sector programs-essentially on a budgetary support basis-while 
ensuring 
appropriate expenditure frameworks to address key sectoral issues and constraints, with procurement and 
financial management arrangements that reassure all financiers-including most importantly the s t a t e - o f 
sound resource use. In both sectors, it is especially important to use this opportunity to create capacity in 
the Ministries so that they can more strategically direct recourses in the future, as well as more effectively 
monitor human resource development progress. Close work with the authorities would be undertaken to 
develop concrete action plans in areas such as decentralizing school management, promoting public- 
private partnerships and seeking private investment in training and technical education. Effective 
delivery of education services will also require defining the role of the provinces and devolved 
institutions in school administration and teacher deployment, in the context of the overall decentralization 
program. The previously mentioned IRQUE will focus on raising access to quality education at the 
tertiary level and making it more accessible to deserving students, thus supporting both growth and equity 
concerns. 

Gender 

60. While there is no freestanding program for gender activities proposed in this CAS, some 
operations do include a specific gender focus, such as the JSDF-supported program to encourage and 
expand women’s rural financial institutions and networks. Rather, the approach is to ensure that in 
everything done by the Bank, the potential contribution of women is maximized in this country where 
women’s roles are often discounted. For example, within CDD operations, efforts will be made to 
mobilize women’s rural development societies-an 
approach that is already transforming villages in the 
North. In the HIV/AIDS program, women’s groups will be empowered and sex workers-both women 
and boys-will 
be targeted for support. In the health sector, women’s health issues and knowledge will 
be a major target of the program, not least in the area of nutrition. Finally, in terms of the program for the 
North East, there are many war widows who will receive particular support during the reconstruction and 
reconciliation process. In summary, the CAS does not propose a gender program; but instead proposes a 
program that will ensure that women’s contributions to development are realized, since it is clear in Sri 
Lanka that whenever this happens the overall impact is significantly greater. 

Safeguards 

61. 
Similarly, in implementing the CAS, ensuring the Bank’s safeguard policies will be crucial. 
Major work has recently been undertaken to review financial and procurement issues, with the completion 
of the CFAA and the CPAR (see Appendix V). Overall, financial management in Sri Lanka is quite 
good, but a major effort is needed with regard to the oversight aspects. Thus, the CFAA calls for 
particular attention to internal and external audit and to the role of Parliamentary Committees. In 
procurement, the issue is not adequate controls, but rather overlapping control systems that end up with a 
diffusion of responsibilities and with major delays to the procurement process. The CPAR calls for a 
simplification of the regulatory framework for procurement, possibly through a new procurement law. 

6 2 . 
A successful six-year program of support to environmental capacity-building is drawing to a 
close. Capability in the sector is quite high and awareness exceptionally so. Continued strengthening is 
needed--especially in the area of natural resources management-and will be primarily supported by a 

SRI LANKA Country Assistance Strategy 

Page 20 of 31 

new ADB-financed program. The high degree of collaboration between the Bank and ADB will continue 
in implementing this program, with the Bank serving on the project steering committee and Bank staff 
participating in ADB implementation efforts. 

63. 
Finally, social development issues have come to the forefront, with significant resettlement of 
IDPs with Bank support and a major reconciliation program. As part of the IDP process, the resettlement 
regulations have been revised to a standard that meets the Bank’s guidelines. Furthermore, the Bank 
plans to post a Post-Conflict Adviser for the South Asia Region in Colombo and a social development 
adviser is also being recruited. As mentioned, a note summarizing safeguard issues and assessing 
capacity will be submitted to the Board along with the first PRSC in FY03. 

Summary of Outcomes 
In preparing the CAS, the Bank’s country team for Sri Lanka has developed a comprehensive 
64. 
country program results framework that links together the different levels of results-Le., 
the country’s 
longer-term development agenda based on the PRSRSL and the shorter-term goals to be achieved durin 
the CAS period and which are supported by the Bank‘s interventions (in partnership with other donors) . 
The key priority base case “CAS Outcomes’’ have been summarized in Table 3 above. 

18 

65. 
Both the Government and the Bank realize that an effective monitoring and evaluation system is 
critical for tracking implementation of the PRS and hence, the CAS outcomes. There is much work ahead 
in data collection, analysis and its linkages with policy and the monitoring of inputs, outputs and 
outcomes. Particularly weak are the current institutional arrangements in Sri Lanka to coordinate the 
monitoring and evaluation efforts. An immediate challenge is to enhance the capacity of the Department 
of Census and Statistics to be able to conduct the key surveys-Le., 
the HlES and the Consumer Finance 
and Socioeconomic Survey (CFSS)-required 
to deepen poverty diagnostics and monitoring at 
appropriate intervals. An integral part of poverty monitoring and impact is also the participatory 
component to assess access and consumer satisfaction with service delivery. During the initial phases of 
CAS implementation, the Bank will place specific emphasis on addressing these capacity constraints. As 
one example of how this w i l l be done, the capacity of the Department of Census and Statistics will be 
enhanced in the context of the on-going Economic Reform Technical Assistance Project. Furthermore, 
the program of the WBI (see paragraphs 66-69 below) will also help to build monitoring and evaluation 
capacity. These and other efforts will clearly facilitate the monitoring of the CAS outcomes. At the time 
of the CAS Progress Report-Le., 
two years from now-this 
particular aspect will receive special 
attention. It may be the case that CAS outcomes will need to be adapted in the light of experiences. 

B. 

Bank Group Scenarios 

Capacity Building 

66. 
As mentioned, an important cross-cutting theme of the CAS is capacity building. To be able to 
achieve the CAS and PRSP outcomes and, more fundamental, to be able to monitor and evaluate progress 
toward achieving these outcomes, there is an urgent need to build capacity in Sri Lanka. Throughout the 
IDA lending program, there are numerous sectoral operations (e.g., health and education) and technical 
assistance operations (e.g., economic and public sector reform) which provide support in this regard. In 
addition, key pieces of the non-lending p rog ram -e .g . , public expenditure, poverty and reviewing 
implementation of social policies/programs-will be carried out jointly with local counterparts, both 
public and private/academic, to strengthen in-country capacity for this essential analytical work. These 

17 

See the Thematic Matrices in Annex B11 for a complete elaboration of the results framework. 

SRI L A N K A Country Ass is tance Strategy 

Page 2 1 of 31 

activities will be fully coordinated with and reinforced by the World Bank Institute (WB1)-for which Sri 
Lanka is a focus country-which will also play a leading role in the capacity building efforts. 

6 7 . WBI will support the CAS peace, growth and equity themes through a variety of face-to-face and 
distance learning programs (see Appendix VII). With the formal launching of the Sr i Lanka Distance 
Learning Center in February 2003, WBI will be increasingly making use of this facility to reach clients in 
Sri Lanka. The WBI program will be continuously assessed and adapted to ensure that it is responsive to 
key institutional capacity weaknesses and bottlenecks in the country. The main priorities for capacity 
enhancement are in the areas of PRS implementation, governance and the media. In addition, other 
priorities are in health, nutrition and population, education and rural development. 

6 8 . 
Related to cementing and strengthening the PRS process, WBI will develop programs to: (i) 
support the establishment of an on-going process of consultation in Sri Lanka; (ii) help Government 
develop firm linkages and appropriate mechanisms between PRS objectives and budgetinghesource 
planning, including inter-governmental public finances at both the central and decentralized levels, and 
(iii) build capacity in designing and implementing a “citizen’s scorecard.” In the area of governance, to 
assist in the implementation of CFAA recommendations, WBI will engage in programs to strengthen the 
public accounts and parliamentary committees, focusing on the role of Parliament in the budget and PRS 
process. Finally, related to the media, programs to enhance the reporting skills of journalists-in English, 
Sinhalese and Tamil-will be developed and implemented. 

69. 
The PRS learning program is expected to support the achievement of the CAS growth and equity 
outcomes by strengthening capacity to implement growth-oriented and pro-poor budgets. Strengthening 
of Parliament under the governance program also contributes to the achievement of the growth and equity 
outcomes. The development of parliamentary capacity would ensure that: (i) public resource allocation is 
consistent with constituent demands, as well as with the country’s development objectives; (ii) funds are 
not misappropriated; (iii) fiscal transparency is maintained; and (iv) PRS expenditures result in improved 
service delivery. The media program is cross-cutting in nature and is expected to contribute to the 
achievement of outcomes in all three thematic areas. Generally, it will help to increase transparency of 
the public decision-making process, which in turn will improve accountability. This process will 
eventually increase the overall governance and efficiency of development activities. The media will 
receive training on covering the development needs of a diverse, multi-ethnic society--crucial to the 
country’s efforts to sustain the peace process. Finally, programs to support other CAS objectives will 
contribute to achieving the equity outcomes through improving public sector service delivery capability in 
health (HIV/AIDs communications), education (developing and implementing national education 
assessments) and rural development (integrated water resources planning). 

IDA Non-Lending Program 

70. 
The IDA program is founded on a significantly augmented program of Analytical and Advisory 
Activities (AAA; see Table 4). Given the strong analytical capabilities existing in Sri Lanka, AAA will 
all be carried out in conjunction with Sri Lankan agencies, both within Government and the network of 
research institutions and universities. The AAA program falls into three broad types of activity: 

First, there are major knowledge gaps that need to be filled. These include areas such as poverty 
mapping and poverty in the North East, the investment climate, sources of growth and progress 
towards achieving the MDGs.

Second, 
there are areas of 
analysis specifically requested by 
the Government. These include 
topics such as urbanization and the 
role of local government and the 
reform of the welfare system, It is 
anticipated that further requests of 
this type-both 
through Bank staff 
and technical assistance (TA)-will 
be forthcoming and as such, the 
ability of the Bank to respond to 
such requests will be retained. 

Third, there is AAA that is 
necessary as the basis for future 
lending, especially 
for sectoral 
programs. 
Work 
in health, 
education and 
land are specific 
examples of this, to help define the 
priorities 
for 
future 
public 
expenditure and reform. 

71. 
One of 
the early programs 
proposed 
for support-the 
e-Lanka 
program-is 
itself about the generation 
and management of knowledge for 
development. In terms of allocation of 
the administrative budget, the AAA 
program w i l l receive an allocation similar to that of the lending program. All core diagnostic economic 
and sector work will have been completed by the end of FY03, with the exception of the DPWCEM that 
will be carried out in FYM1*. 

re as 

IDA Lending Scenarios 

72. 
The FY03-FY06 base case lending program consists of about four projects per year for a total of 
US$SOO million of IDA resources (see Table 5 ) . While this lending amount is significantly higher than 
the amount approved during the last CAS period, such an increase is based on a dramatic change both in 
the peace prospects and the economic policy framework and is merely a restoration of a “normal” lending 
program for S r i Lanka in line with its IDA allocations. 

73. 
As mentioned, in each year the lending program would be anchored in a PRSC providing 
program support to the implementation of the PRS. It is envisaged that the four PRSCs might account for 
close to half of the total four-year lending program. This would be complemented by two to four 
investmenthectoral operations per year to support key programs in the focus areas. Given the intensity of 
the conflict, Sri Lanka qualifies for IDA grants for a limited period of time-Le., FY03 and FY04. In 
FY03, the IDA grant amount-ver 
and above that approved in December 2002 for the National 

18 

In summary: (i) the CPAR and CFAA are on-going and will be finalized in FY03; (ii) a Poverty Assessment was 
finalized in FYOl and will be updated in FY05; (iii) a Public Expenditure Review was completed in FY97 and 
continuous public expenditure analysis is a key part of the CAS program; and (iv) the last CEM was can ied ou t in 
FYOO and the DPWCEM emphasizing growth will be undertaken in FY04.

the PRS. Assuming that the IDA grant 
allocation in FY04 is of a similar magnitude, 
i t would most likely be used to finance the: 
( i ) Rural Poverty Reduction Initiative 
(US$40 million); and (ii) Health Sector 
Operation (US$15 million).

74. 
An assumption for S r i Lanka to 
remain 
in 
the base case is continued 
progress in implementing the peace process. 
In addition, S r i Lanka must meet the triggers 
shown in Table 6 that cover: (i) maintaining 
macroeconomic performance, with special 
emphasis on fiscal issues; (ii) successful 
implementation of the economic reform 
program as contained in the PRS; (iii) progress in addressing equity concerns; and (iv) portfolio 
management. These are broad policy and performance indicators. The “intermediate indicators” in 
column four of the “Thematic Matrices” in Annex B l l will be used to measure the status of these 
indicators. Thus, for example, improvements in the quality of education would be measured inter alia by 
the national learning assessments; factor market deepening by the extent of commercialization of the 
People’s Bank and labor market legislation and fiscal reform by the size of the public sector domestic 
borrowing requirement. There are thus a series of specific measures and indicators that will be used to 
assess performance against these broader categories. 

50.0 
170.0

15.0 

75. 
The high case would have a lending volume approximately 25 percent above the level of the base 
case. In addition to maintaining performance as envisioned under the base case, the expectation would be 
for high performance in the following areas: 

0 

0 

Accelerated structural reform, especially in financial sector and public expenditure management; 
Progress in private participation in infrastructure; and 
Deepening of public sector management reforms in the areas of staffing and decentralization 
beyond that currently envisaged. 

0 

76. 
For the first case, i t is proposed that the high case would be reflected in larger PRSCs. In the 
second, this would trigger specific operations to support those reforms, notably possible investments 
supporting private participation in water, railway concessioning, landlord port arrangements or IDA 
guarantees for private power generation investments or toll roads. For the third case, this would trigger 
additional resources for the public sector management technical assistance programs to cover the costs of 
re-deployment. Given the triggers, it is unlikely that a high case scenario would be reached for about a 
year.

77. 
The CAS envisions two types of low case scenarios. The first would see lending fall to levels 
similar to those of the last five y e a r s - o n the order of US$250 million over the four year period-with 
the 
elimination of the PRSCs, the e-Lanka Project and the technical assistance operations for economic and 
public sector reform. This low case would be triggered by either: (i) the breakdown of the peace process 
and the resumption of hostilities, but essentially limited to the North East; or (ii) the lagging behind of 
structural reforms and a failure to maintain satisfactory macroeconomic performance as evaluated by IMF 
PRGF program. The deeper low case scenario would be an exit strategy. If the peace process were to 
break down entirely and hostilities were to break out on a national scale, there would be no new lending 
and in all probability, it would be necessary to suspend all operations. Nevertheless, it should be 
emphasized that such a scenario has never been seen in Sri Lanka during the 20 years of conflict and is 
thus considered highly unlikely. 

IFC Program 

78 . 
As discussed above, the International Finance Corporation (IFC) will support the growth agenda 
through investments that contribute to the CAS outcomes related to establishing and fostering private 
sector participation. IFC will focus on investments which: 

Develop financial markets, increase the availability of financing for SMEs, expand housing 
finance, add value to the on-going consolidation of financial services, or support the growth of 
pri vatel y-managed contractual savings institutions; 
Expand the private provision of infrastructure services, especially in power, ports, water and 
telecommunications; 

SRI L A N K A Country Assistance Strategy 

Page 25 of 31 

Support the growth of export-oriented manufacturing and service companies, including IT 
companies; and 
Support privatization. 

In addition, IFC will explore new opportunities to support the growth of SMEs in conjunction with multi- 
lateral and bi-lateral partners. 

MIGA Program 

79. 
During the CAS period, the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) will explore the 
possibility of working with Sri Lanka’s investment promotion intermediaries to improve their investor 
outreach capabilities through the use of the FDZ Xchange. This e-mail based technology developed by 
MIGA allows promotion agencies to send customized information to international investors that matches 
their specified interest in a region, country or sector. With funding provided by the Gateway Foundation, 
MIGA is prepared to offer hands-on support to appropriate content partners in S r i Lanka who would make 
use of the FDZ Xchange. As foreign investor interest in Sri Lanka grows in a post-conflict environment, 
MIGA would also be ready to help reduce non-commercial risks for foreign direct investors through the 
provision of guarantees to qualified investments against currency inconvertibility and transfer restrictions, 
war and civil disturbance, expropriation and breach of contract. 

Progress under the Last CAS and Lessons Learned 

80. When the previous CAS was presented to the Board, due to the prevailing uncertainties- 
including the conflict-the 
low case was considered the most likely scenario. By the time of the Progress 
Report, Sri Lanka had moved to the mid-base case following the initiation of policy reforms in early- 
1997. However, the country slipped back into the low case in mid-1999 as the Government became 
preoccupied with elections, the conflict escalated and reform efforts weakened. As a result, lending to Sri 
Lanka was relatively modest, with just twelve IDA credits for a total of approximately US$370 million- 
or an average of two credits per year for an annual amount of US$62 million-approved during the period 
FY 97-FY 02. 

81 . 
As part of the CAS process, a CAS 
Completion Report for the 1996 CAS has been 
prepared (see Appendix 111). This analysis 
identifies the major factors-Le., 
political 
instability and the lack of ownership, which 
often resulted 
in complex projects 
that 
suffered from weak 
implementation-that 
contributed to a lack of significant progress 
towards implementing the CAS program. 
Similar lessons were highlighted 
in 
the 
Country Assistance Note (CAN) carried out 
by 
the Operations Evaluation Department 
(OED) in December 1998 (see Box 5). These 
lessons are being taken forward in the design 
of this CAS in a number of ways, including: 

Box 5: Lessons of the Country Assistance Note (CAN) 

The main lessons from the December 1998 OED CAN were: 
The physical components of projects-while 
implemented 
well-were 
subject to increasing implementation delays, 
due primarily to procurement problems; 
Policy changes and institutional reforms were difficult to 
achieve; therefore, the Bank’s assistance should have been 
more sensitive to 
the political cycle and substantial 
preparation and consultation with stakeholders; 
The Bank d id not give adequate attention to the possible 
divisive 
impact of 
its p rog ram s -e .g . , 
several 
large 
education projects could have had greater value if they had 
fostered the role of education in promoting social inclusion 
in a more prominent manner; and 
Although the Bank’s analysis and advice were sound and its 
strategic objectives were well-aligned with Government’s, 
only limited institutional framework changes were made. 

Adopting a more realistic approach to the issues of political instability and ownership, 
specifically by focusing more on: (i) AAA and policy dialogue before jumping prematurely into 
project preparation; (ii) supporting specific, opportunistic reforms put forward by serious 
champions with demonstrated implementation ability; and (iii) capacity building; 

SRI U N k A Country Ass is tance Strategy 

Page 26 of 31 

* Placing greater emphasis on project implementation. In the past, project preparation has often 
taken more than three years and consumed a substantial share of the administrative budget, 
thereby leaving limited resources for implementation efforts. In the future, project preparation 
will be shortened and greater resources will be allocated for implementation; 

Developing simpler, yet larger projects supporting either CDD approaches or comprehensive 
sectoraUmulti-sectoral efforts; and 

Being more selective and focused in areas of engagement, in addition to shifting towards more 
use of programmatic/adjustment lending instruments. 

IDA Portfolio Management 

82. 
After a steady decline during the 199Os, since FYOO the IDA portfolio for Sri Lanka has shown a 
slight increase in the number of projects, annual lending levels and overall disbursements (see Table 7). 
Currently, the portfolio consists of thirteen IDA projects and one Global Environmental Facility (GEF) 
operation with total commitments of about US$470 million, net of cancellations and an undisbursed IDA 
balance of about US$250 m i l l i ~ n ’ ~ .

Although the portfolio has experienced some deterioration since the last CAS, since FY02 there 
have been improvements as a result of the pro-active measures (discussed below) taken by both the 
Government and IDA2’. The most important systemic issues affecting portfolio implementation include: 
(i) lack of accountability and commitment; (ii) lack of continuity in carrying out reform initiatives; (iii)

Recently approved projects not yet effective-Le., Economic Reform Technical Assistance and National HIV/AIDs 
Prevention-are 
included in these totals. The portfolio restructuring-in which US$31 million was reallocated to 
provide support to the North East Emergency Reconstruction Program-is no t counted as a stand-alone project. 
Going into FY02, four projects were identified as “projects-at-risk” and four were on the “watch list” (Le., potential 
projects-at-risk). By mid-FY03-through 
restructurings and/or cancellations-there were only two projects-at-risk and 
one on the watch list.

poor governance, including weak fiduciary controls; (iv) irregular flow of counterpart funds; and (v) 
overly ambitious project design.

level and establishing measures to assign 
direct ownership and accountability to the 
respective line ministries (see Box 6). In 
addition, monthly reviews of all donor- 
funded assistance are conducted by the 
Ministry of Policy Development and 
Implementation and chaired by the Prime 
Minister’s portfolio advisor, and monthly 
meetings 
are he ld -cha i red 
by 
the 
Department of External Resources with the 
State Accounts Division 
and 
line 
ministries-to 
ensure adequate allocation 
and 
timely flow of counterpart funds. 
Specifically related to the IDA portfolio, 
other on-going activities 
include: 
(i) 
establishment of 
a Project Directors’ 
Forum-cons is t ing of project directors of all IDA- funded projects-that meets quarterly to address and 
resolve common issues, share best practices and streamline monitoring and reporting; and (ii) bi-annual 
portfolio review meetings between IDA, the Ministry of Finance, line ministries and other stakeholders to 
discuss implementation issues. 

Box 6: Improving Accountability in Project Implementation 
In September 2002, the Ministry of Finance issued a circular 
outlining amendments to procedures to deal with issues that “inhibit 
expeditious project implementation.” Each line ministry Secretary 
was made fully responsible for coordinating and ensuring timely 
implementation of projects under h i s h e r purview. As such, 
financial authority limits have been increased and Secretaries are 
required to delegate authority to Project Directors to make them 
more accountable. 
Furthermore, rigorous procedures for the 
selection and performance monitoring of Project Directors have 
been established. 
In procurement-in which there have been serious delays in 
the past-a Cabinet Sub-comm i t tee on Budget and Tenders has 
been established to oversee all tender decisions and monitor 
procurement plans. The role of the Procurement Support Bureau as 
a key advisor 
in procurement has also been established. 
Furthermore, revised procurement gu ide l ine s -de lega t ing more 
financial and decision-making authority to Project Directors and 
Secretaries of line ministries-have been issued. 

85. 
IDA’S portfolio management plan focuses on enhancing quality, with special attention paid to 
sociaYenvironmenta1 safeguards and fiduciary controls. For example, quality enhancement reviews are 
being taken to achieve high quality at entry and emphasis is being placed on establishing procurement 
planshystems before project effectiveness. Compliance with social and environmental safeguards will be 
strengthened through systematic sector reviews, particularly for the energy, infrastructure and irrigation 
sectors and by building local ownership and capacity to address social and environmental concerns. 
Greater emphasis will be placed on CDD activities and multi-sectoral approaches, both in rural and urban 
settings. 

86. 
To ensure more effective portfolio implementation, specific supervision strategies for each sector 
are being developed. Regional sector specialists will provide quality oversight, while staff in the 
Colombo Office-supported by the New Delhi procurement hub-will 
interact with project staff and 
other stakeholders on day-today implementation issues. The underlying principle will be on pre-emptive 
action to resolve issues before they become full-fledged problems. In addition, more interaction will be 
undertaken with the media, as this is an essential part of promoting understanding and awareness of the 
portfolio objectives and for engaging civil society in an open and transparent manner. 

IFC Portfolio 

87. 
As of January 31, 2003, IFC had outstanding committed investments in 14 companies in Sri 
Lanka with a total exposure of US$74 million, consisting of US$68 million from its own account (net 
exposure) and US$6 million from participating banks. This includes projects in the financial sector, 
infrastructure, general manufacturing, health care and tourism. 
In the infrastructure sector, IFC 

SRI L A N K 4 Country Assistance Strategy 

Page 28 of 31 

participated in the South Asia Gateway Terminal project together with ADB, Commonwealth 
Development Corporation (CDC) and the Private Sector Investment Development Corporation (PSIDC) 
to develop a quay of the Colombo port as a private container terminal on a 30-year build, operate and 
transfer (BOT) basis. 
It also invested in Asia Power-Sri Lanka’s first private power generation 
project-and Sun t e l -on e of Sri Lanka’s two mobile operators. In the financial sector, IFC activities 
have included investments in venture capital funds, housing finance companies, commercial banks, the 
country’s first credit rating agency and support of capital markets through credit lines to leasing 
companies and other non-bank financial institutions. Portfolio performance is excellent, with no loan 
arrears. 

C. 

IDA E l i g i b i l e and IBRD Creditworthiness 

88 . While Sri Lanka’s per capita income level is approaching the IDA operational cut-off (US$875), 
the country is currently not considered creditworthy for IBRD lending because of political risks and its 
precarious fiscal position. Previous reviews have concluded that Sri Lanka’s creditworthiness was not 
strong enough to justify access to IBRD resources because of: ( i ) the civil conflict; (ii) high total public 
debt and inadequate fiscal performance; and (iii) vulnerability to external shocks. 

89. 
Nevertheless, given the policy performance envisioned in the base case scenario and the strong 
prospects for peace, it is possible that Sri Lanka might be deemed eligible for IBRD lending by the time 
of the next CAS, or even before-Le., 
possibly in a high case scenario. With regard to potential IBRD 
lending in the coming years, the following possibilities exist: 

In a base case scenario, Sri Lanka would remain an IDA-only country during the entire CAS 
period (Le., FY03-FY06). A creditworthiness analysis would be carried out in mid-FY06-i.e., 
to 
coincide with the preparation of the next CAS-to 
determine Sri Lanka’ s readiness for transitioning 
to an a IDNIBRD blend-country during the next CAS period; and 

If the triggers for the high case scenario are met and economic performance is in line with the 
medium-term economic framework set out in Table 2, a review of IBRD creditworthiness could be 
carried out earlier-Le., 
early-FY0621. If under this review, Sri Lanka is deemed creditworthy, then 
the high case scenario could include a limited amount of IBRD lending-primarily 
for private 
participation in infrastructure projects. Otherwise, the high case would be an IDA-only scenario. 

IV. 

IMPLEMENTING THE CAS 

A . 

Partnerships 

90. 
There are three types of partnership that are important for this CAS. First, there are official 
partnerships. Of these, the most important are with JBIC and ADB, the two largest providers of finance 
to Sri Lanka. The two institutions are currently preparing their assistance strategies and clear efforts have 
been made to ensure congruence. In February 2003, the Bank and JBIC co-hosted a workshop of the 
three institutions in Tokyo to discuss their respective strategies and fine-tune coordination. The workshop 
was extremely successful and permitted the agencies to ensure complementarity between their strategies, 

21 

~ 

In moving towards a scenario in which Sri Lanka is considered IBRD creditworthy, first and foremost, there is a need 
for the country to develop a track record in a number of areas, including solidifying the peace process and macro 
stability, most importantly in regaining strong growth and fiscal paths. Such a track record could only be established 
based on the observation of economic and financial performance indicators through 2005, including public debt and 
fiscal debt levels reached by end-2005. The economic targets as set ou t in Table 2 thereby provide useful benchmarks 
against which to assess economic performance and progress. 

SR l LANKA Country Ass is tance S tra tegy 

Page 29 of 31 

especially in terms of support to the North East, support to implementation of the PRS, financing of 
infrastructure and balancing lending. There is a very reassuring degree of complementarity between the 
strategies-Le., 
the Bank is addressing macro constraints on business, while the ADB is focusing on PSD 
institutions and JBIC is providing support to financial institutions. ADB’s focus on sector policy in roads 
and power has facilitated JBIC financing in these sectors. In education, the Bank is focusing on primary 
and tertiary education, while ADB interventions are focused on secondary and vocational skills. The 
Bank is also working closely with the Japanese authorities to ensure the success of the Tokyo Financing 
Conference for Sri Lanka, scheduled for June 9-10,2003. 
The relationship with the UN system is also strong, and ADB, LO, UNDP, UNHCR, UNICEF 
91. 
and the Bank have been working especially closely together with respect to assessing the needs of the 
North and East. In addition, coordination with the IMF has been consistently excellent. Currently, the 
Bank’s PRSC is being prepared in parallel with the IMF PRGF and the two institutions are working 
closely to ensure that the programs are consistent and reinforce each other. As another example of the 
close coordination, the assessment of the PRS was carried out by a joint Bank/IMF team. 

92. 
An important part of the coordination efforts revolves around selectivity in implementing the 
PRS-Le., 
development partners are working together to ensure that duplication is minimized, while at 
the same time, all essential components of the PRS are receiving adequate support. The multi-lateral and 
bi-lateral partnerships for implementing the PRS are summarized in Table 8.

93. 
This being said, nevertheless, Government leadership of the coordination of development partners 
leaves much to be desired. This is an area that the Bank is working with ADB in trying to improve, 
especially to ensure continuity between meetings of the Development Forum. 

94. 
The second type of partnership is with the private sector--especially, 
the Chambers of 
Commerce. These are exceptionally well-organized in Sri Lanka and routinely prepare inputs to policy 
formulation, such as comments on the draft PRS and suggestions for the budget. The Ceylon Chamber of 
Comme rce -one the oldest in the world-is 
collaborating with the Bank to prepare the Development 
Gateway for Sri Lanka and will be an important partner in carrying out the investment climate work and 
other initiatives affecting the private sector. 

95. 
Partnership with civil society is mixed. On the development implementation front, it is going 
well in such projects as the NEIAP, in which Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) are performing 
strongly in their role as social mobilizers. NGOs are also playing a significant part in the North East 
Emergency Reconstruction Program. However, there is not a very well-organized framework for policy 
consultation, and no structured framework exists for exchange of views between the Govemment, the 
Bank and civil society. Thus, there are those who felt fully consulted on the PRS and others who never 
saw it. This will receive increased attention during this CAS period, especially through the efforts of 
WBI. Priority will also be placed on building better partnerships with the media and improving the 
Bank’s external communications efforts with regard to both lending and non-lending activities. 

B. 

Monitoring of Outcomes 

96. 
As mentioned above (see paragraph 65), effective monitoring and evaluation is critical for 
tracking implementation of the PRS, and hence, the CAS outcomes. The Thematic Ma t r ice s4on ta ined 
in Annex B 1 I-identify 
clear, specific indicators that will be used to measure progress toward achieving 
the CAS outcomes. In the coming months, as emphasis is placed on monitoring and evaluation systems, 
for each of the indicators, annual targets for the CAS period will be established and agreed with the 
Government. Preliminary indications are that sufficient information is available to carry out this exercise 
as envisioned. However, there is still the need to determine whether or not valid and verifiable data 
exist-including 
baseline information-to measure real progress towards achieving all of the CAS 
outcomes. 

C. 

Risks 

97. 
There are five types of risk associated with this CAS. In Box 7 these risks are listed in order of 
importance, with the first two-peace 
and politics-being 
the most critical. This is therefore a relatively 
risky strategy. It is intentionally so, because of the historic moment at which Sri Lanka finds itself. The 
Government and indeed the LTTE are themselves being very bold and taking enormous risks with respect 
to their own political futures, for the sake of a better future for the people of Sri Lanka. It seems only 
reasonable that the Bank should also be prepared to accept the risks of this strategy so long as the two 
parties remain committed to achieving peace and laying the foundation for a renewed attack on poverty. 
It is therefore a strategy that has high risks, but potentially very high rewards in a country that for too long 
has been performing below its fu l l potential. Sri Lanka now has the opportunity finally to break out of 
the conflict and follow a path of sustained progress for all its people. The World Bank Group can make a 
substantial contribution to this process. 

SRI LA N K A Country Assistance Strategy 

Page 31 of 31 

98. 
To handle these risks, several mitigation 
strategies are being adopted. First, with Bank 
support, a major communications program is being 
developed to present and explain the reform 
program to the population. This should reduce 
resistance to the reforms. 
In addition, a major 
program of technical assistance for the reform 
process has been approved-Le., 
the Economic 
Reform Technical Assistance Project-which 
should boost implementation capacity. Both the 
IMF and the Bank will also provide support to 
strengthen the monitoring and evaluation capacity 
building effort. 

99. 
The political risks are harder to mitigate, 
but should be tractable so long as the Government 
retains 
the confidence of Parliament. 
The 
successful implementation of the reform program 
and successful negotiation of the peace process are 
the best guarantees of this. With regard to the 
peace process, there is every indication of strong 
commitment from both sides and the best prospect 
to supporting this is an early demonstration of the 
benefits of peace. Thus, the Bank-along with 
other development partners-will 
provide early 
support for reconstruction efforts as part of the 
strategy. Finally, the external shocks require that 
foreign reserves be built up as quickly as possible. 
This would require appealing for this type of for 
external assistance during 
the 
forthcoming 
Financing Conference for Sri Lanka planned for 
June in Tokyo. 

a 

Box 7 : CAS Risks 
Peace: the biggest uncertainty is whether peace will indeed 
be achieved this time. I t has been noted that the process is 
going 
remarkably well and 
that both sides appear 
determined. But after 20 years and several failed attempts, 
claiming certainty would be foolish. The Bank is ensuring 
resources are available for reconstruction and has a strategy 
in the event hostilities were to resume. 
Politics: Sri Lanka is going through “cohabitation”-i.e., 
President from one party and a Government from another- 
for the first time. The President has the constitutional power 
to dismiss the Government and call elections. Such an event 
would obviously disrupt both 
the peace process and 
economic reform. The President has stated that she will not 
call elections as long 
the Government continues 
to 
command the confidence of Parliament. But, a political 
crisis remains a risk for this strategy. 
Economic reform: the Government is committed to reform, 
but could face serious opposition to some of its policies, 
such as in the financial sector. 
In addition, if economic 
reform were to threaten the peace process Government 
might slow down. Thus, the level of support is linked to 
both the pace and quality of reform. 
External: Sri Lanka remains a country with heavy external 
dependence. 
If the situation in the Middle East were to 
deteriorate, intemational tourism and remittances might 
decline significantly ju s t as the Sri Lankan economy is 
recovering. 
Implementation: the CAS proposes a major increase in 
lending at a time when Sr i Lanka’s own resources are 
heavily stretched, raising 
the question of absorptive 
capacity. Significant resources will be transferred in the 
form of program assistance. Th is is easily absorbed and in 
and of itself makes it easier for project assistance to be 
absorbed. 

100. Sri Lanka now has the opportunity to break out of the conflict and follow a path of sustained 
development and progress for all its people. This CAS presents a coherent strategy for how the World 
Bank Group should support Sri Lanka to help this opportunity be realized.

The Root Causes of the Ethnic Conflict in S r i Lanka’ 

Background 

The ethnic conflict in S r i Lanka has many root causes and consequences that are closely inter- 
linked. However, given its complexities, it should not be assumed that these causes are part of linear 
historical processes where one event led to another. Often many of the issues that may be regarded as 
root causes arose within a single but extended context and equally as often, simultaneously. It is 
primarily within the context of ethnic politics that language and education policy can be located. 
However, for discussion purposes it is necessary to separate these issues as clearly identifiable themes 
that would emerge in any analysis of the S r i Lankan conflict. In general, these themes can be broadly 
identified as: 

Ethnic politics and the interpretation of the past; 
Politics of language; 
Politics of education; and 
Other factors, including employment and land. 

Demographic Patterns 

Y 

Sri Lankan societ is an ethno-religious mosaic2 and within the ethnic groups, there are clear 
religious divisions as well . To a certain extent, ethnicity and religion also have a regional basis, which 
is a significant reason why the Tamil militancy has a strong geographical dimension, which extended to 
the demand of a separate independent state. Of the ethnic and religious groups, Tamil Hindus 
predominate in the Northern Province and maintain a significant presence in the Eastern Province. The 
Eastern Province is an ethnically mixed area where Tamils, Muslims and Sinhalese are found in sizeable 
numbers even though Tamils have a slightly higher statistical edge. Indian Tamils-the descendants of 
laborers brought from Southern India by the British in the 19” century to work on tea and coffee 
estates-are 
concentrated in parts of the Central, Uwa and Sabaragamuwa Provinces. Sinhalese 
Buddhists predominate in all parts of the country except the Northern and Eastern Provinces. Muslims 
have a significant concentration in the Eastern Province, but generally are scattered throughout the 
country. Christians maintain a significant presence in the coastal areas as a result of over 500 years of 
constant European colonial presence and the consequent Christianization of significant numbers of the 
population in these areas. However, Christians are found in all parts of the country in small numbers. 
Malays are mostly concentrated in and around the city of Colombo and the Western Province. 

By the time S r i Lanka achieved independence in 1948 from the UK, there were expectations that 
the country would become a model democracy. Universal adult franchise had been introduced in the

This draws heavily from “The Ethnic Conflict in Sri Lanka: A Historical and Sociopolitical Outline”, by Dr. Sasanka 
Perera, of the Department of Sociology, the University of Colombo, December 1999. At the time this paper was 
written, Dr. Perera was a full-time staff member of the World Bank. The views and opinions expressed here are those 
of the CAS team and d o not necessarily represent those of the World Bank or the Government of Sr i Lanka. 
Based on 1981 statistics, the population is as follows: Sinhalese: 74.0%; Sri Lankan Tamils: 12.7%; Indian Tamils: 
5 . 5 % ; Muslims: 7 .1% ; Burghers: 0.3%; Malays (followers of Islam): 0.3%; and numerous other small groups: 0.2%. 

Buddhists make up 69.3% of the population; Hindus, account for 15.5%; Muslims-who 
constitute the only ethnic 
group who have a single term to denote ethnicity and religion-along with Malays (also Muslims) account for 7.6%. 
Christians account for 7.4%.

1931, democratic institutions and traditions had been in place and political violence was not an issue. 
Moreover, by the 1950s literacy in Sri Lanka was on the rise and there were no serious indicators of 
economic or social catastrophes of the years to come. However, even before independence, there were 
clear indications of ethnic politics that were to emerge later. 

The Emergence of Ethnic Politics 

Relations between Tamils and Sinhalese have not always or consistently been antagonistic. This 
happened only in times of external threats from South India after the formulation of clear Sinhalese and 
Tamil ethnic or cultural identities in the 9* (or 12*) century. These wars were wars of dominance fought 
between regional rulers and were not ‘race’ wars as defined later. Historical chronicles compiled by 
Sinhalese Buddhist monks defined these wars as campaigns undertaken to protect Buddhism and the 
Sinhalese nation. Mainly reinforced by formal education, many Sinhalese accept these problematic 
interpretations as fact today. In the eyes of many Sri Lankans, these interpretations seem to suggest a 
long and bloody tradition in which hope for reconciliation is minimal. Significantly, these 
interpretations-with 
their potent and emotional contents-have 
also found their way into school 
textbooks, which is an important aspect of social and political socialization in contemporary S r i Lanka. 

Forces of Sinhalese nationalism perpetuating notions of eternal conflict with Tamils had been 
gathering strength since before independence. Many of them were Sinhalese-educated rural people 
whose nationalist aspirations for cultural transformation, power and status did not automatically 
materialize with independence. Soon after independence it was clear that a conflict was emerging 
between Sinhalese-educated rural elite and the English-educated urban ruling elite. 

Meanwhile, one million Indian Tamils were disenfranchised in 1948 under the Ceylon 
Citizenship Act. Of this, approximately 350,000 were repatriated to India under the Indo-Ceylon 
Agreement of 1964. Over the years, subsequent governments conferred citizenship rights to the rest. 
The Ceylon Citizenship Act served to reinforce ethnic politics and reduced the electoral leverage of the 
Indian Tamils who remain an impoverished community today. 

Ethnic Conflict and Language 

In addition to the barriers imposed by the continued use of the English language as the official 
language after independence, the emerging nationalist forces perceived that Sri Lankan Tamils had 
access to a disproportionate share of power as a consequence of educational opportunities in the colonial 
period and were also disproportionately represented in the civil administration. Moreover, considerable 
mercantile interests were also controlled by non-Sinhalese groups. These fears and concerns were a 
basis for the politics of language that was to emerge. 

As early as 1944, politicians proposed resolutions in Parliament to declare Sinhalese the official 
language, while other amendments proposed both Sinhalese and Tamil as official languages4. A 1944 
resolution specified that Sinhalese and Tamil would become the languages of instruction in schools, 
examinations for public services and legislative proceedings. The resolution was approved by 27 to 2 in 
the Sinhalese-dominated legislature. Committees were established to advise on how these changes were 
to be implemented, however, there was little progress in implementing the policy. In 1956, S.W.R.D 
Bandaranaike was elected Prime Minister with a main election promise of establishing Sinhalese as the 
official language of the country, replacing English. The new government fulfilled this promise-through 

4 

In the colonial period, both Tamil and Sinhalese politicians espoused the idea of swabasha, which, literally translates 
into ‘native languages’. By this, they meant that in the post independent period primacy of place should be given to 
local languages, namely Sinhalese and Tamil. 

the passage of the so-called “Sinhalese Only Bill” (Official Language Act, No. 33 of 1956)-soon 
the election giving no status of parity to the Tamil language.

after 

The language issue in many ways brought the Sinhalese-Tamil conflict into the forefront of S r i 
Lankan politics. In terms of the dominant strands of Sinhalese nationalism, the Sinhalese language along 
with the Buddhist religion necessarily had to occupy the pre-eminent position in society. This was 
perceived to be the only way the glory of ancient Sinhalese civilization could be revitalized. Even 
though Tamil has been decreed an official language along with Sinhalese in terms of the 13* 
Amendment to the Constitution (in 1987), the damage caused by the politics of language generally 
remain unaddressed. Moreover, the vast gap between the official recognition of Tamil as an official 
language and the practical implementation of the provisions and conditions it entails, is yet to be 
bridged. 

Ethnic Conflict and Education 

Since the 1970s, access to education-particularly 
access to higher education-has 
been 
ethnicized. In addition, many other aspects of education-including 
the structural organization of 
schools and universities, contents of textbooks and training of teachers-have 
impacted directly on 
ethnic conflict. Compared to other ethnic and religious groups in the country, Tamils have had strong 
cultural norms which valued education. Many Tamils attended English Ianguage schools which were the 
passport to higher education and better employment in the colonial period. As a consequence of well- 
funded American missionary activities, the Tamil-dominated Northern Province had comparatively 
better facilities for English language and pre-university education. 

There was also a limit beyond which Tamils could not be absorbed within the traditional land- 
based occupations in the arid areas where they predominated. This further encouraged many to seek 
employment through education. The net result was the relative over-representation of Tamils in higher 
education, professions and the administration in comparison to their status in the general population’. 

In this context, post independence Sinhalese nationalism sought to curb the Tamil presence in 
education and thus also in the professions and civil administration. While the passing of the “Sinhalese 
Only Bill” was one attempt in this process, more direct hurdles were placed on the path of Tamils’ 
realization of educational goals since the 1970s. The constitutional provisions in the 1972 Constitution 
favoring the Sinhalese language and Buddhist religion, along with their educational policies, convinced 
many Tamils that they had been perceived as a marginal community. 

From 1971 onwards, a new “standardization” policy was adopted, which ensured that the 
number of students qualifying for university entrance from each language was Froportionate to the 
number of students who sat for university entrance examination in that language . In real terms this 
meant that Tamil speaking students had to score much higher than Sinhalese speaking students to gain 
admission to universities. This also meant that for the first time, the integrity of university admissions 
policy was tampered with by using ethnicity as a basis. In 1972, a district quota system was introduced 

5 

6 

By independence, Tamils accounted for over 30% of govemment services admissions, a share larger than their 
proportion in the general population-i.e., Sri Lankan and Indian Tamils have never totaled more than 25% . By 1956, 
it is estimated that Tamils constituted 50% of the clerical personnel of the railway, postal and customs services, 60% of 
all doctors, engineers and lawyers, and 40% of other labor forces. 

Prior to this, individuals entered universities on the basis of national competitive examinations marked on a uniform 
basis. Those who scored highest, gained access to different faculties in universities irrespective of their ethnicity or 
districts from which they came. While there was no inherent bias, Tamils from Jaffna and Colombo did particularly 
w e l l - e . g . , in the 1969-1970 intake to science and engineering courses, Tamils constituted 35% and over 45% of the 
intake in medical faculties. 

Append ix 1 
Pag e 4 of 6 

in order to benefit those not having adequate access to educational facilities within each language. These 
changes had a serious impact on the demographic patterns of university entry’. 

In general, these policies seriously impacted upon not only the chances of Tamils to gain access 
to higher education, but also on the overall process of ethnic relations as well. In 1977, the language- 
based admission policy was abolished and since that time various adjustments have been introduced on 
the basis of merit, district quotas, disadvantaged area quotas, etc. While the obvious ethno-linguistic 
discrimination of the 1971 policy has long been dismantled, many Tamil youth still feel that they are 
discriminated against in access to higher education. 

Furthermore, the ethnic divisions in Sri Lanka tend to manifest within the education structure in 
a number of other ways-Le., 
the organizational structure of educational institutions, the training of 
teachers and the content of textbooks and syllabi-which 
are much more long lasting and far more 
insidious than the more visible ethno-linguistic policies of the 1970s. 

Related to the organizational structure of educational institutions, it is clear that language-based 
segregation takes place. This does not apply to privately-owned institutions in which instruction is in 
English, but applies to institutions with more than one language of instruction (such as some universities, 
mixed media schools and technical institutes) where a system of internal segregation takes place. In real 
terms Sinhalese students are segregated into Sinhalese-language schools and Tamil and Tamil-speaking 
Muslim students are segregated into Tamil-language schools. If they enter universities or technical 
institutes, this segregation is likely to continue unless they o t to, and have the money to receive, a non- 
segregated further education in English in private institutions . t 
The training of teachers poses similar problems, as most teachers in the system today are 
products of the segregated education system they are teaching in. Moreover, they are also trained in 
institutions that are internally segregated except in the training of teachers specializing in subjects such 
as English. Few teacher training institutions in operation today, have seriously taken into account the 
need to train teachers who can teach in a context keeping in mind the challenges of a multicultural 
society. There is a clear disjuncture between current state policy towards ethnic relations and the manner 
in which teachers are trained. 

Since the early-l98Os, many have stressed the role school texts play in shaping ethnic relations 
in the country. Ideally, school texts (e.g., texts used for teaching religion, language, social studies, etc.) 
should portray the multi-cultural reality of Sri Lankan society and address issues that are important in 
this context while approaching the prescribed subject matter. School texts have been written, supervised, 
produced and distributed by agencies of the state, meaning that their contents reflect state policy or 
thinking. Furthermore, ethnic politics have also been played out in the process of text production. In 
recent times some of the more problematic contents in these texts have been removed in the process of 
revision and re-writing’. Ironically however, sometimes this has gone to the opposite extreme--e.g., in 
some texts all references to ethnicity and related issues have been removed.

Tamil representation in the science-based disciplines fell from 35% in 1970 to 19% in 1975, while Sinhalese 
representation in all disciplines increased quite dramatically. 

Some state institutions (e.g., university departments where instruction is given in all three languages such as the 
Department of Law at the University of Colombo) are exceptions to this as students can opt for the medium of 
instruction of their choice. But given the legacy of segregated school education and the general poor state of English 
language education, very few have the required background or make the choice to educate themselves in a non- 
segregated environment even when given the choice. 

Support for development of new textbooks, along with teacher training is being provided under two on-going IDA 
projects: Second General Education (Cr. 3014-CE) and Teacher Education and Teacher Deployment (Cr. 288 1-CE).

Ethnic Conflict and Employment 

As mentioned above, both language and education policies have placed barriers on employment, 
especially in the administrative and professional ranks in which Tamils were at one point “over- 
represented.” In the private sector-which 
for the most part continued to work in English-employment 
opportunities for Tamils and other minorities remained relatively open. As a result, today some of the 
leading business ventures in the country are Tamil-owned. However, as a result of the discrimination 
that has occurred in state sector employment practices over time, there is a tendency among many Tamils 
to perceive of themselves as generally discriminated against in employment. According to the census of 
public sector and corporate sector employment in 1990, Sri Lankan Tamils accounted for 5.9% of those 
employed in the state services. This represents a significant drop from earlier years. 

Ethnic Conflict and the Issue of Land 

The issue of ownership over and access to land has also been a consistent area in which ethnic 
politics in Sri Lanka have manifested, and have sustained themselves over the years. As noted, one of 
the peculiarities in the demographic patterns in Sri Lanka is the relative concentration of certain ethnic 
groups in certain geographical regions. The clearest site of politics of land and ethnicity has been in the 
sparsely populated areas of the dry zone in the North Central Province and the Eastern Province”. When 
post independence governments decided to settle poor Sinhalese farmers from the densely populated wet 
zone areas of the country, many Sinhalese politicians and people in general viewed the process as a 
“reclamation and recreation in the present of the glorious Sinhalese Buddhist past.” The so-called 
“colonization schemes’’ became an integral aspect of Sinhalese Buddhist ‘nation-building.’ 

Not surprisingly, the Tamils had a completely different perception of the colonization of the dry 
zone. The notion of the ‘traditional Tamil homeland’ became a potent component of popular Tamil 
political imagination. Since Sinhalese irrigation settlements in the North Central and Eastern Provinces 
occurred under direct state sponsorship, it appeared to many Tamils as a deliberate attempt of the 
Sinhalese-dominated state to marginalize them further by decreasing their numbers in the area. The 
colonization schemes did alter the demographic patterns, particularly in the Eastern Province in a 
significant way”. 

A decision was made in the late-1970s to accelerate the development of the dry zone through the 
“Accelerated Mahaweli Program,” that provided for the opening up of dry zone areas further for 
agriculture and resettlement of people. Only in 1986, as a result of continuing Tamil agitations, did the 
government agree to allocate the remaining land under the Mahaweli Program on the basis of the ethnic 
distribution of each ethnic group in the total population. 

Meanwhile, the Muslim community tended to reject the countervailing notion of a traditional 
Tamil homeland in the North East region. Growing cooperation between the security forces and Muslim 
home guards led to LTTE attacks on Muslim villages in the East, armed counter attacks on Tamil 
communities in the South East and to the eviction of 55,000 Muslims from the North in 1990 most of 
whom remain displaced today.

The dry zone areas of the North Central Province had special socio-cultural significance for Sinhalese in term of their 
popular imagination of the past-Le., 
it was area where a number of ancient Sinhalese capitals were located in a time 
considered as the “golden era of Sinhalese civilization.” It was also where many of the ruins of these ancient cities and 
citadels continued to be a source of pride to many Sinhalese. 

According to census data, the Sinhalese population-which 
constituted 3% of the population in the Trincomalee 
District in the east in 1921-was 30% in 1981. Similarly, Amparai District which used to be a largely Tamil and 
Muslim-majority area is now a Sinhalese-majority area.

Loss of Confidence in Non-violent and Democratic Politics 

Ethnic politics and fears of discrimination led Tamil politicians in the Federal direction from a 
very early stage of recent Sri Lankan politics. Since the 1930s, and much more clearly since the 1950s, 
Tamil political parties have been asking for greater political autonomy for the areas in which they 
predominate. Such a devolution of power has been recognized at different times as a means to diffuse 
tensions between the two groups. A number of pacts had been formulated to define the modalities for 
devolution of power, including the Bandaranaike-Chelvanayagam Pact in July 1957 that offered a 
framework for regional devolution. But due to various political pressures, the provisions of the pact 
were never implemented. In 1965, the Dudley-Chelvanayagam Pact was formulated and agreed upon. 
But, yet again the provisions of this p a c t -qu i t e similar to the earlier one-were annulled. 

The failure to implement these proposals led to Tamil demands for separation, instead of 
Federalism that they had been mostly seeking up to that point. On the part of many Tamils-particularly 
Tamil youth from the north-the 
failure of these pacts also marked a disintegration of confidence in 
parliamentary politics in general. In 1977, the Tamil United Liberation Front won an overwhelming 
electoral victory on a highly charged political platform of separatism. In 1980, the District Development 
Council Act was passed in Parliament and elections to the councils were held in July 1981. But given 
the lack of government commitment to decentralization of power, this attempt also proved to be a 
failure. After this point, there were clear indications that the politics of Tamil society were shifting from 
the commitment to parliamentary democracy (held by its conservative leaders) to a commitment to 
armed struggle (held by considerable sections of Tamil youth). In 1979, the government enacted the 
draconian Prevention of Terrorism Act as a an interim measure, but in 1982 it was amended to be part of 
the permanent law. 

The Emergence of Armed Conflict 

Until the early-l980s, ethnic conflict was primarily limited to the political arena where 
destruction to property and life was minimal. However, violence had occurred on number of occasions, 
such as in the passing of the “Sinhalese Only Bill” in 1956. Similar ethnic riots involving Tamils and 
Sinhalese occurred in 1958, 1977 and 1981, with the most violent and destructive taking place in July 
1983. Many observers see the violence of July 1983 as a turning point in the conflict. 

After the early- 1980s, such sporadic cases of violence gradually gave way to institutionalized 
political violence which became a main feature of the conflict. At this stage, organized or 
institutionalized political violence was widely utilized by both the political parties in power and Tamil 
youth who organized themselves into armed guerrilla outfits. This development marked the 
militarization and the steady brutalization of the Sri Lankan ethnic conflict. 

The failure of parliamentary politics and the entrenchment of ethnic politics which led to 
frustration among Tamil youth, eventually made some of these youth organize themselves into armed 
groups for the ostensible purpose of seeking independence from Sinhalese domination. The first of these 
groups was the Tamil Tigers which later came to be known as the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Elam or 
LTTE. In 1978, the Tamil Tigers carried out a series of bank robberies and also assassinated a number 
of police officers, many of whom were Tamil. Bank robberies and selected assassination of individuals 
within the Tamil community (who were considered traitors) later led to massacres of Sinhalese and 
Muslim civilians in the border villages and contested areas. By the 1980s, this phase in the evolution of 
political violence expanded to include indiscriminate bomb attacks in the Sinhalese-dominated south, 
particularly in Colombo. Subsequently, the conflict reached civil war proportions and Indian peace- 
keeping forces were sent to Sri Lanka in 1987. The Indian forces left in 1990 and the civil conflict 
between the Government and LTTE resumed three months later. The conflict escalated in the late-1990s 
with conventional battles being fought to capture territory.

International Monetary Fund 
700 19" Street, N W 
Washington, D. C. 2043, USA 
Sri Lanka: Public Information Notice 
On September 3, 2002, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the 
Article IV consultation with Sri Lanka'. 

Background 

Sri Lanka's economy grew steadily during the last two decades, despite the civil conflict, which has 
been going on for over 9 years. During this period, financial markets were liberalized, the outward 
orientation of the economy was significantly increased, and a more diversified export base 
established. However, large fiscal imbalances (which averaged more than 9 percent of GDP during 
this period) led to prolonged periods of public dissaving. Slow progress in key structural areas, 
including civil service reform, restructuring of state-owned enterprises, financial and labor market 
reforms, undermined the economy's growth potential. 

Faced with low reserves, large import bills, and an exchange rate level and regime (a crawling band) 
that was no longer credible, the authorities initiated a program of economic stabilization. The Central 
Bank of S r i Lanka (CBSL) floated the exchange rate on January 23, 2001 and committed to an 
ambitious stabilization program, supported by a Stand-By Arrangement, which was approved by the 
Board on April 20, 2001. As envisaged, the current account deficit narrowed, and the CBSL 
succeeded in building up net international reserves with a broadly stable exchange rate. At end-June 
2001, the program had met all its key objectives. However, political developments complicated 
economic policymaking during the second half of 2001. During this time, the government was not 
able to take corrective policies to keep the program on track in the face of worsening circumstances. 

GDP contracted by about 1% percent in 2001-the 
first contraction since independence in 1948. The 
global recession led to stagnant demand overseas for garments and textiles-which 
account for half 
of exports. Due to the drought, agricultural output declined more than 3 percent and low water 
reservoir levels led to widespread power cuts. The attack on Colombo airport and the events of 
September 11 also exacerbated the slowdown. While underlying inflation was close to the program 
target of 8 percent (end-year basis) for 2001, drought-affected food prices drove up the headline rate. 
The official Colombo Consumer Price Index (food items account for 65 percent of the CCPI basket) 
increased 10% percent in the 12 months to December 2001. 

I 

Under Article IV of the IM F s Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every 
year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the 
country's economic developments and policies. On retum to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the 
basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion o f the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman 
of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's 
authorities. The PIN summarizes the views of the Executive Board as expressed dur ing the September 3d Executive 
Board discussion on the staff report.

Although, the external reserve losses of 2000 were partly reversed, balance of payments 
developments in 2001 were weaker than programmed due to the external and domestic shocks and 
delays in external financing. Private capital flows (including privatization receipts) fell below 
expectations a s structural reforms were delayed and investor confidence was undermined. 

After a good start, the envisioned fiscal stabilization in 2001 did not materialize. In the second half of 
the year, the slowing economy and a lack of resolve weakened the budget performance considerably. 
Instead of declining as planned, the fiscal deficit rose in 2001 by 1 percentage point to almost 11 
percent of GDP. Revenue suffered from slower growth, election-related tax cuts, and a lack of 
progress on tax administration reform. On the expenditure side, despite tight controls on nonwage 
recurrent spending, the authorities failed to tackle the politically sensitive spending on Samurdhi and 
subsidies. Fiscal laxity intensified in the run-up to the December 2001 elections, with the granting of 
large wage and pension increases. There was also an overrun in defense spending. The program 
target on borrowing by public corporations was exceeded due to large losses by the Ceylon 
Electricity Board (CEB). 

Monetary policy was constrained by the fiscal situation, requiring high real interest rates to counter 
exchange rate and inflationary pressures during most of 2000 and the early part of 2001. However, 
the CBSL progressively reduced rates during the last three quarters of 2001 because of the weak 
economy. By end-2001, the reverse rep0 rate was 900 basis points lower than its rate in January 
2001. Despite the weak economy and the concomitant compression of credit to the private sector, 
broad money growth slightly exceeded the 2001 target (13% percent) reflecting the increased public 
sector borrowing requirement. 

Following victory in the December elections, the United National Front (UNF) government 
committed to deal with the major economic challenges it faced and move ahead with the program. 
The new government presented a strong budget in March 2002, which demonstrated their 
commitment to fiscal consolidation and structural reforms to lay the foundations for private sector 
led growth in the medium-term. 

Substantial progress was made on the macroeconomic stabilization front during the first half of 2002. 
Inflation showed a trend decline-headline 
inflation was in the range 8-9 percent for the 12 months 
to August, consistent with the year end target. GDP growth bottomed out in the first quarter GDP. 
The external position has stabilized and the rupee remained broadly stable, The CBSL continued to 
maintain a broadly prudent monetary stance. Fiscal consolidation has began which is a key program 
objective. The financial position of the public corporations also stabilized over January-June 2002. 

In addition, major initiatives have been taken to resolve the civil conflict-a 
permanent ceasefire is 
in operation and peace talks are expected to commence in Thailand in September. 

Economic Prospects2 

Modest growth of 3%-4 percent is expected in 2002, reflecting in part the gradual pace of recovery in 
external demand. With improved rainfall, early indications are that agricultural output will rebound 
during the second half of 2002. Although some recovery is expected in both the garment and tea 
sectors, which should boost manufacturing activity, significant turnaround in exports is not expected

until the latter part of 2002. Headline inflation through August indicates that the annual inflation 
target of 7-8 percent is achievable. The CBSL continued to maintain a prudent monetary stance and 
fiscal data through June suggest that the 8% percent deficit target i s achievable. Nominal interest 
rates are expected to decline during the second half of 2002 as inflation comes down and fiscal 
consolidation takes hold and confidence begins to strengthen. The rupee, which is freely floating, has 
remained stable in recent months. The trade deficit narrowed significantly during the first four 
months of 2002 before increasing in May, and official reserves continued to rise steadily through 
August. Preliminary data suggest that recent progress on the peace front has improved the outlook for 
both portfolio and FDI flows. Thus, the external position is expected to strengthen, and gross official 
reserves are projected to rise to $1% billion, about 2% months of imports of goods and services. 

Executive Board Assessment 

Executive Directors noted that Sri Lanka is at a critical jun c tu r e -d e sp i t e recent improvements, the 
macroeconomic situation remains fragile, and achieving sustainable high growth requires major 
adjustments. Directors also noted that resolution of the civil conflict and the scope for generating 
growth opportunities are closely intertwined. 

Directors welcomed the fact that the cease-fire is already providing an economic boost to the country 
through lower security spending and renewed economic activity in the country’s conflict-affected 
North and East. Sustained peace would allow budgetary resources to be reallocated to social 
programs and building or rehabilitating infrastructure, especially in the war-tom parts of the country. 

Directors welcomed that the government’s key macroeconomic objectives under the Stand-By 
Arrangement had been achieved, with reserves being rebuilt and fiscal consolidation and several 
structural reforms initiated, especially in the public sector. Nevertheless, Directors observed that the 
government’s adjustment program has significant downside risks. In particular, there remain risks of 
drought, and the long-term electricity shortages are still a major concern. Directors were also 
concerned that any resumption of political uncertainties could slow down the peace momentum, and 
undermine the fiscal position. 

Directors welcomed the authorities’ intention to press ahead with fiscal consolidation, which is 
essential to ensuring fiscal and external sustainability over the medium term. They welcomed the 
introduction of the new VAT, but stressed that the government should press on with other measures 
to reform the tax system and administration. To contain current spending, the government should 
also stand firm on its disciplined approach to wage and recruitment policies and defense spending. In 
that connection, Directors welcomed the newly formed Defense Spending Monitoring Committee. In 
addition, they urged the authorities to avoid having subsidies and transfers exceed the budget 
provisions, and they should resist any further broad cost-of-living relief measures, including tax cuts 
and administered price adjustments, that would undermine the financial viability of the budget or the 
public corporations. If needed, the authorities should stand ready to take additional measures to 
ensure that the broad fiscal goals are achieved. 

Directors stressed that the 2003 budget will need to continue the path of fiscal consolidation, with the 
focus on controlling current expenditures. They urged the authorities to extend the VAT to the retail 
level and remove exemptions. The proposed unified revenue authority would likely soon contribute 
to enhancing tax administration. 

Appendix I1 
Page 4 of 4 

Directors considered that firm fiscal consolidation would enable the CBSL to maintain a prudent 
monetary stance, while balancing the need to provide sufficient and affordable bank credit to the 
private sector. While welcoming the gradual decline in policy interest rates this year, in line with the 
path of inflation, Directors urged the CBSL to avoid further significant easing until it is clear that 
fiscal consolidation has taken hold. 

Directors endorsed the authorities’ current exchange rate policy and their commitment to improve the 
functioning of the interbank foreign exchange market by implementing the Financial System 
Stability Assessment (FSSA) recommendations. They agreed that CBSL’s intervention should 
continue to aim primarily at realizing the net foreign asset path of the monetary program, with only 
limited smoothing of short-term exchange rate volatility. 

Directors emphasized the need to strengthen the banking system, which, together with a stable 
macroeconomic environment, would provide a stronger basis for a gradual and sequenced form of 
capital account liberalization. They called for further strengthening of the CBSL’s supervisory 
function. They welcomed the authorities’ decision to tackle the problems of Peoples Bank and to 
improve the performance of the Bank of Ceylon, with the help of technical assistance from the Fund 
and the World Bank. The authorities were encouraged to finalize the draft law on anti-money 
laundering, in 
the 
light of 
the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) mission’s 
recommendations. 

Looking ahead, Directors noted that a major challenge for the authorities is to press ahead with 
deeper structural r e f om measures to promote growth and reduce poverty. They endorsed the 
authorities’ structural reform agenda, and were encouraged by the initial steps taken on the structural 
front. The measures to restructure the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) and the Ceylon 
Electricity Board (CEB), and to invite private participation in those companies under an appropriate 
regulatory framework, were welcomed. More ambitious privatization was recommended, which 
could provide resources for government debt reduction, and contribute to long-term economic growth 
and private sector development. Over the medium term, further reform of public expenditure and the 
financial sector, restructuring of public sector institutions, strengthening the tax collection agencies, 
and labor market reforms would serve to improve public sector effectiveness and promote private 
sector growth. 

Directors noted that data quality and timeliness are satisfactory for surveillance. They looked forward 
to S r i Lanka soon subscribing to the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS).

CAS Completion Report 

Country: Sri Lanka 

Date of CAS: May 21, 1996 Date of Progress Report: December 23, 1998 

Period covered by the CAS Completion Report: July 1996-December 2002 

CAS Completion Report completed by: Deborah Bateman, Country Coordinator for Sri Lanka 

Date: December 6, 2002 

A. 

Country Development Results 

At the time the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) was written in 1996, the most important 
country development results which the CAS were aligned with included: (i) reducing poverty, especially 
in rural areas; (ii) improving the quality of education and health services; (iii) obtaining higher and steady 
growth rates; and ( iv ) reducing unemployment (see Table 1). Although the Millennium Development 
Goals (MDGs) are a much more recent concept, a number of the development results with which the CAS 
was aligned-specifically, 
reducing poverty, improving the quality of education and health services and 
reducing unemployment-are directly related to the MDGs. However, it is important to note that at the 
time the CAS was written, S r i Lanka’s impressive social achievements-i.e., 
low infant mortality; 
virtually universal primary school enrollment, with enrollment rates for girls comparable to those for boys 
throughout the system; and gender disparities in wage levels among the lowest in the world-set 
it apart 
from most low and middle income economies. 

While i t appears that some progress has been made in achieving the country development results, 
in many areas it is difficult to measure progress given a lack of data and clear indicators. Initially growth 
rates improved slightly, but due to the sharp downturn in 2001-in which negative GDP growth was 
recorded for the first time since Independence-Sri Lanka is far from achieving the higher, steady growth 
rate that it desires. Furthermore, while unemployment has also declined during the period, it still remains 
high and identifying new sources of employment remains a chief concern. 

B. 

CAS Outcomes the Bank Expected to Influence through its Interventions 

The specific CAS outcomes focused on key areas required to help Sri Lanka realize its dream of 
economic growth and poverty reduction comparable to that of its more prosperous East Asian neighbors. 
CAS benchmarks were established in the areas of: (i) improving fiscal discipline/ensuring sustainable 
macroeconomic balances; (ii) developing/promoting the private sector; (iii) enhancing social protection/ 
building human capital; and (v ) improving portfolio performance. There are a number of direct links 
between these and the country development results+.g., 
improving/promoting the private sector is 
directly related to obtaining higher and steady growth rates and reducing unemployment. However, many 
of the linkages are more indirect--e.g., improving fiscal discipline and enhancing social protection are 
indirectly linked with improving the quality of education and health. 

There has been considerable progress on meeting many of the CAS outcomes (see Table l ) , 
although much of the progress has been quite recent and as a result, the remaining agenda is substantial. 
Specifically: 

Append ix 111 
Page 2 of 15 

Improv ing fiscal discipline/ensuring sustainable macroeconomic b a l a n c e n t h e r e have 
been periods of weak fiscal discipline during the period-in 
part associated with the almost 
annual pre-election “hand-outs.” Nevertheless, the previous administration did make some 
notable progress-including entering into a Stand-by Arrangement (SBA) with the IMF in April 
200 1-and 
the current administration (elected in December 200 1) is continuing with serious steps 
towards fiscal consolidation. With regard to specific targets, initially the overall budget deficit 
declined, but starting in 2000, weakening revenue performance and increasing expenditures 
(many related to the security situation and the large debt burden) have resulted in relatively high 
deficits. The current commitment to ensuring macroeconomic stability and institutionalizing 
fiscal discipline is strong, but in a peace scenario with large reconstruction needs, there is a 
possibility that high deficits could remain in the coming years. On the issue of subsidies, there 
has been good progress-even prior to 2002-with many large subsidies removed and the few 
that remain are more limited and closely monitored. With regard to the tax system, there have 
been impressive gains with the introduction of a goods and services tax (GST), which more 
recently (August 2002) has been replaced by a VAT. 

DeveIoping/promoting the private sector-there 
has been significant progress over the 
period on number of fronts. With regard to privatization, there was progress early on with the 
successful privatization of the plantations (1996) and the national telecommunications company 
(SLT). Following this, there was little action for a number of years, due in part to frequent 
elections that slowed the momentum for structural reforms. Nevertheless, 2002 has seen a burst 
of activity, including the privatization of two sugar companies and Lanka Marine, along with 
progress toward unbundling the electricity company (CEB) and plans to place additional shares of 
SLT on the stock exchange. With regard to People’s Bank, the Government is exploring a 
number of options (developed with lMFA3ank assistance) and will announce its plans in mid- 
2003. Furthermore, early in the period there were some reductions in Government interference in 
the domestic agricultural market-including closing the Paddy Marketing Board. More recently, 
there has been an acceleration of implementation of the pilot land titling program, but, as 
identified in a recent Bank Report (“Sri Lanka: Promoting Agricultural and Rural Non-farm 
Sector Growth”), improvements in agricultural productivity growth are still restricted by 
extensive Government interventions in agricultural commodity and factor markets. 

Enhancing social pro tec t ionhu i ld ing human capital-Progress was fairly limited during 
the initial years of the CAS period, with a lot of talk about reforming Samurdhi, but little action, 
with the exception of annual real reductions in budget allocations to Samurdhi since 2001. In 
recent months, the Government has passed a new Welfare Benefits Act that provides a legal 
framework for all welfare relief benefits financed by the Treasury. This act sets out transparent 
processes and guidelines dictating how all social transfer programs will be carried out, along with 
giving the Ministry of Finance a key role in the implementation of all schemes. Hence, targeting, 
efficiency and effectiveness of such programs will likely improve. Over the last two years, there 
have been positive outcomes in the area of teacher re-deployment with evidence now that all 
provinces are continuing to make steady progress on deploying teachers to difficult areas. 
Nevertheless, it is difficult to assess whether or not there has been real progress in building 
human capital. 

Pro jec t implementation-while 
the disbursement ratio declined for the most part during the 
period, it improved slightly in FYOl and substantially (to 25%) in FY02. In part, this is due to 
the strong commitment that 
the new Government has shown to 
improving project 
implementation, including the establishment of a cabinet subcommittee to focus on this area. 

Append ix I I I 

P a g e 3 of 15 

Nevertheless, a number of important generic issues-including weak project management, slow 
procurement decisions and frequent changes in project personnel-persist 
and need to be tackled. 

As mentioned above and shown in Table 1, many of the CAS outcomes can be quantified and 
provided a general basis for measuring progress. However, it has been difficult to measure whether or not 
there has been progress with regard to the human capital development efforts. 

A number of factors-including 
the prolonged internal ethnic crisis, continuing political 
instability and the external environment (e.g., the repercussions of September 1 l*)-have 
contributed to 
the limited achievement of the CAS outcomes. Specifically, all these factors had considerable impacts on 
economic growth, both directly through declines in important activities such as tourism and exports, and 
indirectly on development of the private sector due to uncertainty and lack of demand. Furthermore, 
despite some successes in structural reforms, on more than one occasion during the period, increases in 
political instability were directly linked with slowdowns/stalls in the pace of reform implementation, as 
Government became preoccupied with politics and ownership of reform efforts weakened. 

There have not been any unintended negative impacts-such 
as unintended social costs or 
environmental damage, etc.-as 
a result of the implementation of the CAS. 

C. 

Measuring Bank Performance' 

Throughout the period, the assessment of quality at entry has been impressive with ratings of 
100% being maintained (see Table 1). The quality of supervision has been rated as relatively high, 
although declined slightly in recent years. The assessment of quality of ESW has been very limited with 
two of the three pieces-the Urban Transport Strategy Note and the Poverty and Social Development 
work-eva lua ted as marginal'. Similarly, evaluations of achievement of development objectives and 
sustainability of results have been fairly poor and not improving through the period. 

With regard to program delivery, under the CAS base case scenario i t was anticipated that lending 
volumes would be in the range of US$70-140 milliodyear. Alternatively, the low case scenari- 
envisioned in the event of a failure to stem the current fiscal deterioration or if the structural reforms 
entirely stalled or reversed--carried with i t a lending program of about one or two operations a year, for 
an average annual total of about US$50 million. During the period FY97-FY02, twelve IDA credits were 
approved for a total of approximately U S 3 7 0 million (see Table 2-r 
an annual average of two 
projects per year for US$62 million. As such, while performance supported a base case lending program 
for a short sub-period (Le., in 1997 and 1998 following the initiation of policy reforms), for the remainder 
of the period-as 
the Government became preoccupied with the elections, the conflict escalated and 
reform efforts weakened-performance was judged to be less than that required to operate under the base 
case scenario. This was appropriately borne out in the Bank's lending volumes. Nevertheless, throughout 

I 

2 

A serious lack of availability of reliable data for the purposes of the evaluations in th i s section should be noted. As 
many of the Bank's systems-including SAP and Business Warehouse-were 
only being developed during the CAS 
implementation period, consistent historical da ta series are lacking for most variables. Furthermore, routine tracking of 
quality and performance-by QAG and OED -w e r e only being developed during the period and the small samples for 
these indicators may be very misleading. While this discussion is based on the best available data, the scope for 
inaccuracy and drawing of wrong conclusions should be noted. 
In the case of the Urban Transport Strategy Note, the major faults cited included a lack of clarity of the task and limited 
dialogue and dissemination. It should be noted that this was always intended to be a small piece of work (Le., less than 
US$50,000) and for an internal Bank audience-both 
of which the QAG team d id not accept. In the case of the 
Poverty and Social Development work, again the clarity of the task objectives were questioned, as were its cost and 
audience. 

Appendix III 
P a g e 4 of 1.5 

the period, a strong AAA (Analytical and Advisory Activities) program was carried out, with an average 
of 4-5 activities per year (see Table 3). Key reports included Annual Economic Updates, a Poverty 
Assessment, assistance in carrying out the “RRR Framework3, an Agricultural Policy Review and a 
Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP). 

With regard to portfolio performance, the number of (IDA) projects declined steadily from 19 in 
FY96 to 10 in FY99, before increasing to 12 in FYOO where it has since remained. This decline was 
accompanied by a decline in the average implementation period-from 4.4 years in FY96 to 2.4 years in 
FY99-and 
at the same time, a decline in the disbursement ratio-from 24% in FY96 to 15% in FYOO. 
Since then, there has been a substantial increase in the disbursement ratio-to 
25% in FY02-as 
the 
portfolio matured. Prior to the CAS, portfolio performance experienced a sharp turn around in FY95, 
following a major restructuring effort after successive years of decline. Throughout the period, both the 
percent of projects at risk by number and the percent of problem projects by number stayed below 20%, 
with the exception of FY99 when it increased to 30%. The two current problem projects-Mahaweli 
and 
PSIDC-are 
experiencing many of 
the generic issues previously 
identified, including weak 
regulatory/policy environment, lack of ownership and political will to implement reform measures and 
weak project management. Nevertheless, in November 2002, a portfolio restructuring-primarily 
of 
these two projects-was undertaken to provide urgently needed support to the conflict-affected North 
East. 

D. 

Consultation and Coordination 

During the period, aid coordination has been an important component of the Bank’s strategy and 
efforts have been quite successful. Until assumed by the Government in June 2002, the Bank had chaired 
the aid coordination meetings-Le., Development Forums-held 
approximately every 18 months. At the 
same time, an active donor coordination forum in Colombo has been developed and meets regularly under 
the leadership of a chairman that has rotated between the Bank, ADB and UNDP. As Japan (JBIC), the 
ADB and IDA account for about 90 percent of concessional assistance, the Bank has also made efforts to 
coordinate at the country strategy and sector level with these large donors. While this has resulted in 
some successes-such as the joint CAS consultations carried out in FYOl and the more recent rapid needs 
assessments in the North East-there 
is still considerable room for progress, especially with convergence 
on the need to link lending decisions to outcomes and implementation of programdresults. This is a 
process that will need to be further strengthened and the efforts towards reconstruction in the North East 
pose a tremendous opportunity for further improvements and solidifying a “best practice” donor 
coordination model. Furthermore, Government leadership of the coordination of development partners 
leaves much to be desired. The Bank, along with the ADB, is working on trying to improve this. 

PHRD and GEF have been the major sources of trust fundgrant resources mobilized in support of 
the CAS implementation. Disbursements from these sources ranged between US$2 million and US$4 
million during the period FY99 to FY02 with a shift taking place from Bank to country execution. GEF 
funding for 
two projects-Energy 
Services Delivery and Medicinal P lan t sAom ina te 
these 
disbursements, complemented by PHRD grants for project preparation and an IDF grant to support 
improvements in urban air and fuel quality. 

When the CAS was developed in 1996, there were broad consultations with various stakeholders, 
including the Government. However, compared to today’s standards, the consultations were relatively 

3 

The Relief, Rehabilitation, and Reconciliation (RRR) Framework was an important consultative process that brought 
together Govemment, civil society, individuals and communities to identify ways to work together to improve relief, 
rehabilitation and reconciliation efforts in the context of the civil conflict. The Bank assisted the Government in 
launching this process and provided strong support until the Government completely took over in early-2002.

limited. In FYO1, a substantial CAS consultation process was carried out4-by 
the Bank and joined by 
ADB and JBIC-to gain a better understanding of the development challenges and priorities facing Sri 
Lanka. The team consulted with a wide range of civil society groups, including teachers, students, 
religious leaders, trade unions, political party leaders, members of the international donor community, 
journalists, professionals, young entrepreneurs, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), national and 
provincial chambers of commerce, fishermen, villagers, plantation workers, and national and local 
Government officials. Although the views of stakeholder groups diverged, there was strong consensus on 
several key priorities. The cross-cutting concerns raised during the consultations include: (i) the 
deterioration of governance in the country; (ii) the effects of the civil conflict; (iii) the absence of 
empowerment and opportunities for the poor; (iv) the need for reforms in education, notably the provision 
of education in English; and ( iv ) the role of donors. Prior to this, the Bank had assisted ando r 
participated in other important consultation processes carried out by the Government for the development 
of the RRR Framework and the Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS). 

E. 

Lessons Learned for Subsequent CAS Design 

While the country development results supported by the Bank during the CAS period were quite 
broad and generic, they were likely the correct ones. In that the CAS was undertaken before MDGs when 
many of the Bank’s clients had yet to define clear and specific development results, the lack of 
clarity/specificity in the country development results have made evaluation of the country and the CAS 
performance somewhat more difficult. Nevertheless, as previously mentioned Sri Lanka is in a fairly 
unique position, having achieved human development outcomes as great as those of high-income 
countries and surpassing almost all of the MDGs at an early stage of its development process. 

Overall, the CAS outcomes achieved during the period are sustainable. While in many cases 
progress was relatively modest and prolonged in being achieved, there appears to be a clear and 
irreversible reform process set in motion. For example, the need for fiscal consolidation is clearly 
accepted today and an important part of the country’s strategy. Furthermore, there is well-recognized 
need to remove the distortions hindering private sector development and reform the enabling business 
environment. Prior to the CAS, recognition of the need for these types of reforms-at 
least across the 
political spectrum-were not so widespread. Nevertheless, considerable public awarenesddissemination 
is still required to education the general population on the justification and benefits of such reforms. 

An important factor that contributed towards achievement of the CAS program was strengthening 
of the Colombo office, including moving the Country Director to Colombo in 1997 and building a local 
capacity to support the economic/policy dialogues and project implementation. In addition, the strong 
presence in Colombo allowed the Bank to: ( i) work successfully in fosteringlfacilitating the early conflict- 
the RRR framework; (ii) gain experience in implementing community-driven 
related activities-Le., 
demand (CDD) approaches in both conflict-affected and other areas through the North East Irrigated 
Agriculture Project (NEIAP) and the Village Self Help Initiative; and (iii) react quickly-through 
portfolio restructuring to support an emergency program for the North East-when 
the conditions for 
peace turned favorable. Bank support to the Central Bank (through the Central Bank Strengthening 
Credit) also worked well by demonstrating that quick reaction to a reform-minded champion can foster 
reform efforts and begin to chip away at governance issues. 

Major factors contributing to a lack of real progress toward implementing the CAS program were 
political instability and lack of ownership, which often resulted in complex projects that suffered from 

4 

It was intended that a CAS for Sri Lanka be presented to the Board in late-FYOl/early-FY02. Due to heightened 
political instability at that time, along with a severe worsening in the domestic security situation, it was assessed that it 
was an inappropriate time to present a new CAS. 

Append ix Ill 
Pag e 6 of 15 

weak implementation. These are being taken forward in the design of the next CAS in a number of ways, 
including: 

adopting a more realistic approach to the issues of political instability and ownership, 
specifically by focusing more on: (i) AAA and policy dialogue before jumping prematurely into 
project preparation; (ii) supporting specific, opportunistic reforms put forward by serious 
champions with demonstrated implementation ability; and (iii) capacity building; 
placing greater emphasis on project implementation. In the past, project preparation has 
often taken more than three years and consumed a substantial share of the administrative budget, 
thereby leaving limited resources for implementation efforts. In the future, project preparation 
will be shortened, and greater resources will be allocated for implementation efforts; 
developing simpler, yet larger projects supporting either CDD approaches or comprehensive 
sectoral/multi-sectoral efforts; and 
being more selective and focused on areas in which we choose to engage, in addition to 
shifting towards greater use of programmatic/adjustment lending. 

There are a number of analytical gaps which need to be addressed in the next CAS, specifically: 

given the current continuing fragile fiscal situation-including 
the effects of the large public 
debt burden-public 
expenditure analysis will need to become a permanent core activity and 
work has already been initiated in this regard; 
as governance remains a fundamental challenge, completing the Country Procurement 
Assessment Report (CPAR) and Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) will be 
essential for setting a strong foundation for the shift toward a more programmatic lending 
approach and uncovering other important issues for potential future AAA; 
given the “opening-up” of 
the North East-in 
which currently all (including the 
Government) have a substantial knowledge void-key 
pieces of ESW are needed, comprising a 
Poverty Assessment (including updating the situation for the entire country) and a Social 
Assessment of Conflict-Affected Areas; 
to better understand the reform challenges, i t will be important to carry out a Development 
Policy Review (DPR), with a particular focus on future sources of growth; 
given that the private sector will need to play an enhanced role in generating future 
economic growth, an Investment Climate Survey-for both urban and rural areas-will need to 
be undertaken; 
given the urgent need to show real improvements in the quality of human development, it 
will be important to analyze carefully the issues in both the health and education sectors and 
assist the Government in developing appropriate strategies; and 
an effective monitoring and evaluation system is critical for tracking implementation of the 
country development results and CAS outcomes. Given the current institutional weaknesses in 
this area, there is much to be done with regard to strengthening data collection, analysis and its 
linkages with policy and the monitoring of inputs, outputs and outcomes.

In recent years, between specific consultations carried out by the Bank-including 
for the CAS- 
and consultations carried out by the Government with Bank involvement-such 
as for the RRR 
Framework and the PRS-there 
is a bit of “consultation fatigue” within Sri Lanka. Therefore, it will be 

A p p e n d i x I l l 
P a g e 7 of 15 

important to be more selective in carrying out further consultations and Bank efforts in this area need to 
take a backseat to Government efforts. Nevertheless, in developing more projects that use community- 
driven demand approaches, strong emphasis will be placed on consultations during project preparation 
and implementation. With regard to a related issue-i.e., 
a relatively poor image of the Bank within Sri 
Lanka-we will be more proactive in our external relations efforts, including focusing on disseminating 
information about the Bank’s activities in all native languages and supporting the Government in its 
public awareness campaigns surrounding the reform efforts. It is envisioned that important lessons will 
be learned from these activities to fine-tune the CAS during the implementation period. 

Similar lessons were highlighted in the Country Assistance Note (C AN ) carried out by the 
Operations Evaluation Department (OED) in December 1998; specifically: 

0 

The physical components of projects-while 
implemented well-were 
implementation delays, due primarily to procurement problems; 

subject to increasing 

Policy changes and institutional reforms were difficult to achieve; therefore, the Bank’s 
assistance should have been more sensitive to the political cycle and substantial preparation and 
consultation with stakeholders; 

0 

The Bank did not give adequate attention to the possible divisive impact of its programs- 
e.g., several large education projects could have had greater value if they had fostered the role of 
education in promoting social inclusion in a more prominent manner; and 

0 

Although the Bank’s analysis and advice were sound and its strategic objectives were well- 
aligned with Government’s, only limited institutional framework changes were made.

Summary of CAS Consultations I 

Consultation Process 

The Bank carried out extensive consultations for the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) during 
June-November, 2000 in order to benefit from various stakeholder groups’ knowledge and ideas, as well 
as gain a better understanding of the development challenges and priorities facing the people of Sri 
Lanka’. Given the strong presence of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the Japanese Bank for 
International Cooperation (JBIC) in Sri Lanka, these two organizations ’were invited to participate in the 
consultation process. The Bank/ADB/JBIC team consulted with a wide range of civil society groups, 
including teachers, students, religious leaders, trade unions, political party leaders, members of the 
international donor community, journalists, professionals, young entrepreneurs, non-governmental 
organizations (NGOs), chambers of commerce at both the national and provincial levels, fishermen, 
villagers, plantation workers, and government officials at both the national and local levels. Detailed 
summaries of individual consultation meetings were prepared and sent to the participants for their 
comments and subsequent endorsement for wider distribution. Tw o documents containing these 
summaries of the meetings (“Summaries of the First Round Consultations for the Country Assistance 
Strategy (CAS) of the World Bank, Colombo Sri Lanka June-July 2000” and “Summaries of the Second 
Round Consultations for the CAS of the World Bank, Sri Lanka November 2000”) were prepared and 
widely disseminated within the country and the Bank. More recently, small meetings have been held with 
various stakeholder groups-primarily 
in Government, the international donor community, professionals, 
chambers of commerce and with various groups in the North East-to 
validate the observations of the 
previous consultations. For the most part the earlier observations remain valid, however, given the 
current prospects for peace and the poor economic performance during 2001, in the more recent 
consultations substantially more emphasis has been placed on the need for finding a lasting solution to the 
conflict and improving opportunities for the population, especially for the poor 

Main Messages 

The insights provided by the consultations have been valuable in formulating the Bank’s future 
role and assistance strategy for Sri Lanka. While there were often diverging views among and between 
stakeholder groups, there was also strong consensus on several key priorities issues. The cross-cutting 
priority concerns raised during the consultations include the: (i) deterioration of governance in the 
country; (ii) impacts of the civil conflict; (iii) lack of empowerment and opportunities for the poor; (iv) 
need for reforms in education, most notably provision of education in English; and (iv) role of donors. 
Some illustrative quotations and highlights from the consultations are presented below. 
It should be 
stressed that the views and comments expressed in this Annex are not those of the World Bank, but have 
been expressed by various stakeholders during the consultation process. 
* Deterioration in governance 
“We always talk to the World Bank, JBIC, ADB, and others and keep repeating the same things, but 
donors are not in a position to help with the biggest problem in Sri Lanka-the 
absence of good 
governance. The rule of law and due process must prevail. ’’ 

I 

It was intended that a CAS for Sri Lanka be presented to the Board in late-FYOl/early-FY02. Due to heightened 
political instability at that time, along with a worsening in the domestic security situation, it was decided that it was 
inappropriate to present a new CAS at that time. 

Appendix IV 

Page 2 of 4 

L6Governance is the biggest issue. There is no participatory democracy in Sri Lanka. Politicians are not 
answerable to people after they are elected.” 

“National development has to be government-owned and an inclusive process. It may not be the best, but 
is better than other strategies since it is government-driven. A n example is the Poverty Framework 
prepared by the Government of Sri Lanka.” 

The deterioration of governance in Sri Lanka was overwhelmingly identified in the consultations 
as one of the highest concerns. In general, there is the feeling that policy and political debates center not 
around poverty reduction or the problems facing the poor, but on vested interests. Stakeholders expressed 
the view that Government decision-making has been driven by short-term political considerations, and 
there is little evidence of long term planning. Furthermore, it is felt that there is a lack of accountability 
in the public sector. For instance, the Public Accounts Commission of the Western Provincial Council is 
still reviewing the financial statements and audit queries for 1995. Statements for subsequent years have 
not yet been prepared, and no one has been held accountable for this lapse. There is the view that while 
high standards were maintained in the civil service in the 1960s, there has been a gradual erosion over 
time. The abolishment of the Public Service Commission in 1972 was identified by many as the 
beginning of pervasive politicization of government recruitment and the deterioration in governance. It 
was felt that an independent Public Service Commission, Police Commission and Election Commission, 
if established with proper guidelines and incentives, would help improve accountability in the public 
sector. 

* Poverty, conflict and social divisions 

“ l f a small fraction of what is being spent on the war would have been spent on the development of Sri 
Lanka, we would have seen a much greater reduction of poverty.” 

“Despite several constraints, the country has managed to continue a reform process. I f not f o r the war, 
the benefits of the reform process would be great.” 

“Development should not only be in Colombo!” 

There is consensus that the quality of life in Sri Lanka is higher than in other South Asian 
developing countries. Nevertheless, the war has prevented the country from fully capitalizing on its high 
social indicators, and generous levels of foreign assistance. The detrimental effects of the conflict are far 
more widespread than jus t the North East. For example, the livelihood of fishermen is constrained by 
curfews imposed due to security concerns; foreign investment has been restrained by the pervasive 
uncertainty and insecurity; and inflation has been rising with the government having to increase 
administrative prices and taxes to finance military expenditures. 

People see the end to the civil conflict as a political solution. A commonly shared opinion is that 
the conflict has become a business in Sri Lanka with widespread allegations of corruption in the “war 
business.” As one child in the consultations put i t , successive governments have utilized the war to their 
advantage as a kind of “wound on a beggar’s leg” to justify soliciting foreign aid-Le., many felt that the 
war has been used as an excuse for poor governance in the country. The view was also expressed that the 
conflict is a convenient justification to delay reforms and development. Many attribute the origins of the 
conflict to divisive policies/politics. The country has been divided along ethnicity, religion, politics and 
geography. Disparities among these divided groups have caused frustration. For instance, the division of 
the country between Colombo and the rest of the island in terms of level of public expenditures, 
employment and economic growth with industries concentrated in the Western Province (because of good 

Appe tzdrx I V 
Page 3 of 4 

infrastructure) was mentioned repeatedly as a concern by government officials and the segments of civil 
society consulted outside Colombo. 
* Lack of empowerment and opportunities for the poor 
“Give them ( th e poo r ) opportunities.. . . not handouts. ” 
“We are not a poor country, but there are many poor people.” 

The view that development needs to be “people-centered” was often voiced. It was felt that 
people must be empowered in making decisions that affect their lives. Often the beneficiaries were not 
even consulted as to what they need and what they feel is needed to improve their lives. However, many 
did comment on the successes in public programs/policies based on inclusion and consultations (e .g . , 
privatization of plantations) and the fact that voter turnout during elections is high. There was a sense of 
frustration regarding inadequate social debate on important issues in Sri Lanka, despite the country’s long 
legacy of literacy. 

Another commonly expressed sentiment was that the country’s development is leaving the poor 
behind. A number of important facets were noted; specifically that: (i) the poor need access to markets 
and information; (ii) there is a lack of good roads and the transport networks restrict the mobility and 
access of people from remote villages. This in turn results in middle men exploiting poorer farmers and 
depressing producer prices, which keep families in these remote villages in poverty; ( i i i ) young women 
from remote villages are at times left with no other option but to work in estates outside their villages or 
as domestic workers in the Middle East, because there are no jobs available in their own localities; ( i v ) 
there are few, if any, training opportunities for the poor; and ( v ) Sri Lankans have a lot of potential, bu t 
there are often very limited avenues available to utilize their capacities. 

A view was expressed that the poorest of the poor are often difficult to target. For instance, when 
midwives visit a community, the poor are generally not present since t h e y are often away trying to make 
ends meet. Furthermore, i t was felt that: ( i ) children of poor families are unlikely to be immunized since 
they frequently d o not have birth certificates; ( i i ) social security programs are usually so complex that the 
poor are unable to participate in them; (iii) very few services are provided to abused and institutionalized 
children (including orphans and abandoned children) w i t h psychologistlpsychiatrists in short supply i n the 
country; and (iv) mainstreaming these children into society is a major issue when they leave institutions at 
age 18 without adequate life skills. 
* Reforming education 
“Sri Lanka created human capital, but a stifling environment.’’ 

“There is literacy, but there is very little education.” 

“There is a mismatch between education and market needs. The education system has failed to improve 
despite ad hoc changes. Education i s insulated f rom the market. ’’ 

The need for education reforms was another cross-cutting challenge identified. The key themes 
included: (i) the lack of English and computer science education in most rural areas which handicap the 
poor; (ii) a disconnect between the education system and the needs of the economy; ( i i i ) English and 
computer skills-while vital for the j o b market-are 
often not effectively taught in schools; and ( i v ) over 
90 percent of the population is said to be literate, but much of this is either in Sinhalese o r Tamil. 

A p p e n d i x 1V 
P a g e 4 of 4 

Many expressed the view that the medium of instruction in schools should be English, as 
proficiency in English will widen the economic opportunities for young graduates and can also be used as 
a link language to promote social harmony in the country. For example, all students in one meeting in 
Galle unanimously raised their hands when asked who wanted to learn in English. The students clearly 
understood that they were at a disadvantage if they are not conversant in English. Th e education system 
is currently segregated by medium of instruction (Sinhalese o r Tamil), which makes i t difficult to foster 
social harmony. * Donors share part of the blame, but they can also be part of the solution 
“One has to ask i fgovemmen t has made the best use o f funds f rom donors.” 

“They (Government) know donor money will continue to come in, so they don’t need to change. ” 

“There had never been consultations with NGOs (non-governmental organizations) f o r the CAS process 
before.” 

Foreign donors have played an important role in Sri Lanka in the past, but it is felt that foreign 
agencies may have also compounded Sri Lanka’ s problems by continuing to provide assistance without 
questioning the adequacy of policies and rationale for projects. Some groups expressed concerns about 
the fungibility of aid to a country in conflict. It was also felt that monitoring and evaluation of donor 
programs must improve to maximize the developmental impact of aid and that many donor projects need 
to do better to reach the grassroots level. 

Some of the advice offered by the stakeholders on how the Bank can improve the effectiveness of 
aid to Sri Lanka included: (i) the need for better public dissemination of information regarding Bank 
projects and activities in the country; (ii) inclusion of people at the grassroots level in monitoring and 
evaluating Bank-funded projects; and (iii) the need for the Bank to continue policy dialogue with the 
government and make an effort to influence the government to end the war.

The Main Findings of Two Key Fiduciary Assessments: 
The Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) 
and the Country Procurement Assessment Review (CPAR) 

A . 

The Country Financial Accountability Assessment’ 

Context 

The framework for public financial accountability in Sri Lanka is founded in the principles of 
governance associated with the Westminster model inherited from the British. This framework is widely 
accepted as appropriate for the country. The primary accountability institutions and organizations for 
financial management, control, audit and legislative scrutiny have, however, not evolved in line with the 
changes in the more advanced democracies of a similar background. This lapse has reduced the 
effectiveness of the system of public financial accountability in Sri Lanka, resulting in less than adequate 
assurance that public funds are used for the purposes intended w i th due consideration to economy and 
efficiency. 

Financial accountability at the sub-national level is less well-developed than at the center. The 
reasons for this are similar to those concerning the central government, but more acute and pronounced. 
For example, control over funds is subject to less public scrutiny and financial reporting is less regular. In 
addition, provincial and local governments’ dependency on the central government for funds and 
confusion over the role of the center v i s - h i s that of the provinces, result in excessive duplication of 
effort and resources. As regards public corporations, there are over 180 state-owned enterprises (SOEs) 
which combine commercial and regulatory activities in Sri Lanka. The majority of these are 
characterized by excessive staff; weak management; inefficiencies; heavy losses; dependency on budget 
transfers; and delayed publication of audited accounts, thus, further eroding public financial 
accountability. 

Key Findings 

The will to reform is evident at both the political and bureaucratic levels. Confirming the 
willingness to move ahead with much needed reforms are several recent initiatives jointly taken by the 
government, legislators, and the Auditor General (AG) for improving accountability of key SOEs, 
including: ( i ) strengthening the reporting requirements of government agencies; ( i i ) drafting of new 
legislations, setting up organizational arrangements for improved oversight by the Treasury of state 
owned enterprises; and (iii) the ‘e-Sri lanka’ initiative for implementing the e-governance concept. 

Discussions with stakeholders on reforms centered around the urgent need to arrest further 
deterioration in public financial accountability. Five priority areas of concern were identified: 

Parliamentary control of the public purse has become ineffective and does not currently meet the 
expectations set in the Constitution. This can be restored by strengthening the oversight function 
provided by the public accounts and public enterprises committees (COPA and COPE) and 

I 

The CFAA was undertaken from February to October 2002 by a team comprised of Bank staff, govemment 
counterparts and consultants. The work was carried out through a combination of field studies in specific areas, 
reviews of existing studies and self-assessments. In addition, there was extensive d iscuss iodd ia logue with concemed 
stakeholders in the govemment, private sector, legislature, media, civil society and donors. 

A p p e n d i x V

establishing a standing committee to focus on the annual budget. The recent initiative taken by 
the COPE to probe into the performance of the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) is noteworthy in 
this regard. 
The accountability of the executive at present is too focused on ‘spending to budget’, rather than 
on ‘managing for results’. This shift in focus, widely considered to be important, can be 
accomplished by introducing, on a progressive basis, a performance-based culture w i th incentives 
that reward achievement of outputs and outcomes, and holding the secretaries of government to 
account for meeting departmental objectives and performance standards. In this context, recent 
efforts taken to base the year 2003 budget on a Medium Term Budget Framework (MTBF) is 
notable. It will be equally important to reduce the emphasis on concern with administrative 
processes and mere compliance with detailed rules and regulations. The government’s move 
towards establishing a separate revenue agency is a good example of re-thinking on these lines. 
At the same time, it will be necessary to clarify the accountability relationship of the secretary of 
each department to h isher minister. The government has received advice on the issue of 
ministerial accountability from the Netherlands Court of Audit. 
The public audit function does not currently meet the standards implied in Article 153 of the 
Constitution and those expected of the auditing profession, and consequently, its impact on 
financial accountability is below its potential. This can be strengthened by making the Auditor 
General more independent of the executive and by building capacity to provide more relevant 
audit information to parliament. A preliminary study carried out by the Netherlands Court of 
Audit has endorsed the need for strengthening this institution. Recent initiatives of the Auditor 
General to improve the timeliness of audit reports is a significant step in this direction. 
The culture of governance that derives from colonial times is not appropriate to the present needs 
and the government has expressed its intention to move towards a more open, participative form 
of governance and decision-making. This can be accomplished by removing obstacles, such as 
the Official Secrets Act, and re-visiting the Establishment Codes to bring government in line with 
evolving good practices in other parts of the world. 
The lack of clarity over the accountability relationships of the central, provincial and local 
governments and financial reporting arrangements not being well-aligned to the needs of a more 
devolved system of governance, weaken accountability at the sub-national levels. The efforts 
underway to address this issue should include greater specificity on financial accounting, 
reporting, auditing, and public scrutiny arrangements and capacity building at the sub-national 
levels. 

To address the above concerns, the government intends to move forward on two broad fronts: ( i ) 
enacting new legislation and rules to address institutional issues; and (ii) carry out capacity 
buildindtraining, for improving organizational efficiency and effectiveness. Specifically: 

Institutional Reforms 

Amend the standing orders and the Parliamentary Powers and Privileges Act, which govern the 
rules of procedures of parliament, to allow for greater public access to the hearings of the COPA 
and COPE and for opportunities for these committees to further explore ways to enhance 
government productivity, over and above scrutiny based on audit information. 
Enact the proposed Public Finance draft legislation after due consultation with stakeholders and 
review of recent similar legislations enacted in other countries, for financial management of the 
government of Sri Lanka, the establishment and maintenance of the accounts of the State, and the 
control of public sector enterprises. Such legislation would have greater authority than the 

Append ix V 
P a g e 3 of 10 

existing financial regulations promulgated by the government, and consequently provide a firmer 
basis for more effective enforcement. At the same time, this should clarify the financial 
accountability of the minister as distinct from the secretary of the ministry. 
Enact dedicated audit legislation that specifies the duties, powers and responsibilities of the AG 
and provides safeguards for his financial and administrative independence from the executive. 
The Act should also provide for unrestricted access by the AG to information, property and 
personnel associated with management of all significant public resources. 
Pass the proposed Freedom of Information bill, after due consultation with stakeholders, to allow 
for greater public access to information in line with the principles of more accountable and open 
system of governance. 
Develop the form and content of the financial accounts of the various levels of government, and 
common reporting standards consistent with international public sector accounting standards. 

Capacity Building

Build awareness, information sharing, and research capacity of the two oversight committees and 
the proposed new standing committee on the budget in the legislature. 
Strengthen the management control practices associated with revenue, expenditure, assets and 
liabilities of the government. This work would complement initiatives currently being covered by 
the Public Expenditure Management Systems Project (funded by ADB) would include 
simplification of Financial Regulations (FRs), modernization of accounting and financial 
reporting in conformity with international public sector professional standards, and performance 
reporting in line with the evolution in more advanced democracies. 
Formulate an Institutional Development Plan for strengthening the AG’s Department. This 
would entail changes to the audit work program, methodology and the organizational structure, 
and, most importantly, a human resources strategy, including recruitment policy, compensation 
packages, training, and career development opportunities. 
Implement the proposed legislation on Freedom of Information through the development of 
policies, procedures, and training of personnel involved with the provision of timely and 
appropriate information to the public. 
Set accounting and financial reporting standards in line with international public sector 
accounting standards, and develop policies and practices for the preparation and dissemination of 
financial information, including by means of information technology under the e-governance 
initiative. 

The assessment concluded that there are substantial opportunities for introducing institutional 
reforms for strengthening public financial accountability in S r i Lanka. There is every indication that the 
political will for reforms will be sustained. The government seeks a time-bound action plan for moving 
forward on each of the areas of reform and capacity building as outlined above. The Bank, in partnership 
with other development agencies, will support initiatives aimed at developing the action plan and provide 
technical assistance for implementing the recommendations of this assessment.

The Country Procurement Assessment Review2 

Context 

Per capita employment in the public sector in Sri Lanka is the largest in Asia and provides 
employment for more than 850,000 people. In addition to ministries and departments, Sri Lanka has 
over 150 Statutory Boards, Public Corporations and Public Enterprises, which combine commercial and 
regulatory activities. Public sector contribution to GDP is 12.3%; the fiscal situation is dominated by 
defense and interest payments (56%) and public debt is 97.1% of GDP (2000). Furthermore, public 
accountability systems, processes and institutions are weak, outdated and not sufficiently independent. 
The volume of public procurement in Sri Lanka is about Rs.70 billion, with about 65 billion in US$. 
The Sri Lankan legal system is well-established and based on British Common Law, with some 
influence of Roman Dutch Law and customary practices. 

Key Findings 

The following are the key findings: 

Legal and Regulatory Framework 

The Constitution has no specific provisions regarding award of contracts. Under Article 44 (1) 
(a), the President may assign any subjectlfunction to a MinisterMinistry. As such, the President has 
assigned to the Minister of Finance the subject of the “Government Financial regulations, Interpretation 
and Amendments, etc.” Chapter XI11 laid down the rules to be followed for procurement of works, goods 
and services. In addition, there is no central law or provincial law regulating public procurement and the 
basic contract law has no specific provisions having direct bearing on public procurement. 

In order to keep the procurement process fully transparent, “timely” and to obtain the financially 
most advantageous and qualitatively best services/supplies, on September 30, 1996 the Ministry of 
Finance (MOF) issued “Guidelines on Government Tender Procedure.” The introduction of the 
Guidelines was an epoch-making step and ushered in procurement reform. Revised Guidelines- 
containing procedures both for projects financed from Consolidated Fund and Foreign Financing 
Agencies-were 
issued on September 25, 1997 to be implemented with effect from November 1, 1997 by 
all Government institutions-including Ministries, Departments, Public Corporations, Public Statutory 
Bodies, fully-owned Government Companies, Provincial Councils (PC)s and Local Authorities including 
Pradeshika Sabhas (PSs-for 
the procurement of works, services and supplies and disposal of 
government assets. The Guidelines are approved only by the MOF/Cabinet and not by Parliament3. 

To enhance public confidence in the system, rules of this nature which govern the use of large 
amounts of public funds-although having the force of law- 
should be: ( i ) difficult to change; and (ii) 

2 

3 

In association with the govemment, the Bank carried ou t a comprehensive assessment of the public procurement 
system during the period April to November 2002. Twelve public sector organizations participated in the CPAR and 
other contributors included ADB, JBIC and National Construction Contractors Association of Sri Lanka (NCCASL). 

Most countries have public procurement laws enacted by Parliament dealing with the public procurement of goods, 
works and services by governmental entities at all levels. Very few countries still follow the approach-as used in Sri 
Lanka-using Financial Regulations and Guidelines. 

Append ix V 
Page 5 of IO 

changed only in a public and transparent manner. Therefore, i t is suggested that a Public Procurement 
Law be enacted4. The law should be complemented by detailed Guidelines for implementation. 

Entity to Oversight Policy Responsibility f o r Procurement Functions 

There is no independent entity to provide oversight to the policy-related responsibilities of public 
procurement functions, including policy formulation. 
In practice, the MOF has been taking this 
responsibility through the Procurement Support Bureau (PSB). PSB was created in 1999 to provide 
procurement implementation support, including advice on evaluation of tenders and assessment of tender 
proposals. It has also tender monitoring functions. Presently the policy-making responsibility-Le., 
functions of a regulatory nature that should be carried out by an independent organization-are also being 
carried out by PSB. As such, there is a need to create a small high-powered, professionally-staffed, 
independent Procurement Regulatory Agency (PRA) to develop the procurement legal framework. The 
functions of this agency should be confined to policy-making, documentation, development of rules, etc. 
and not include line clearance functions for awarding and execution of contracts as presently done by 
PSB . 

Framework f o r Audit, Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Measures 

The Constitution provides for the appointment of the AG-who 
shall audit the accounts of all 
public expenditure-and 
details the duties and functions of the office. The AG reports the findings on 
unauthorized expenditures, waste of public funds, and abuse of procedures resulting in loss to the 
Treasury. In general, the institution is seen as a watchdog and feared; however, procurement audits, 
technical audits and performance audits are not conducted. 

The Bribery Act (1954) and the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption 
Act (1994) provide a legal framework for anti-bribery and anti-corruption measures. The bribery 
provisions are adequate, but reportedly implementation is poor and few have been punished. As such, 
there is a need to strengthen the Bribery Commission and make it more pro-active in seeking support of 
non-governmental agencies such as Transparency International (TI) in making the public aware of the 
seriousness of the problem and prompt them to fight against bribery and corruption5. 

Procurement Procedures and Practices 

The Guidelines on government tender procedures-which 
are broadly based on donor 
procurement guidelines-have provided a much needed procedural framework. However, the Guidelines 
have some provisions, which are not conducive for transparency and fairness. The important ones are 
discussed briefly below, as well as some of the provisions which need to be clarified, supplemented, 
enlarged and strengthened. 

4 

5 

The law should be based on United Nations Commission on Intemational Trade Law (UNCITRAL) model on 
Procurement of Works, Goods and Services with established Intemational practices, an appeakha l lenge mechanism, 
debriefing to unsuccessful tenderers, dispute resolution mechanism, suspension and blacklisting of firms and 
publication of awards. 

In its latest report, TI has given Sri Lanka a “Corruption Index” of 3.7. This can be compared to 3.5 for China; 2 .7 for 
India; 2 .6 for Pakistan; and 1.2 for Bangladesh. 

Append ix V 
P a g e 6 of 10 

a. 

Standard tender documents f o r goods, works, and services 

Except for procurement of works, there are no standard tender documents for goods, design, 
supply and erect contracts, or consulting services. The quality of the tender documents-which 
includes 
contract format and cond i t ion s4 e c id e the level of competition, the transparency of the process, the risks 
imposed on the tenderer and consequently the price. As such, the tender documents need to be 
standardized and mandated for use by all procuring entities. 

b. 

Registration o f j r m s and contractors 
Since pre-qualificatiodpost-qualification is required for works of more than R s .5 M, the need for 
registration and grading by the Institute for Construction Training and Development (ICTAD) for this 
category of contracts, appears not relevant and serves no purpose. For works of value less than R s .5 M- 
which may be large in number-going 
through the process of verification to meet the specified 
qualification criteria in each case may turn out to be cumbersome and lead to delays. Hence, determining 
the eligibility on the basis of simplified method of registration would be preferable. Also, membership in 
the National Construction Contractors Association of India (NCCASL) should not be compulsory. 

c. 
Evaluation of tenders, evaluatiodpurchase committee, preparation of evaluation reports, approval 
f o r award of Contracts and contract award 

The procedures for the constitution of Tender Boards (TBs) and Tender Evaluation Committees 
(TECs) need to be streamlined to reduce the time periods. If need be, the number of standing TBs and 
TECs may be increased. The “multi-layered review approval process”-particularly 
for large value 
contracts-needs 
to be simplified to expedite the process and minimize opportunities for mal-practices 
and corruption. TBs need to be empowered to take award decisions on the recommendations of TECs. 
While a TB may seek clarification from the TEC or reject the recommendations giving its reasons for the 
TEC to reevaluate, i t should not itself re-evaluate the tenders. The tenders need to be awarded within the 
initial validity period. 

d. 

Negotiations 

To improve outcome and benefits (including cost reduction and reduce uncertainties, presumably 
with all tenderers), the provisions in the Guidelines are ambiguous and permit-in 
fact encourage- 
negotiations before selection of the successful tenderer. Negotiations should not be held merely to push 
down the competitively quoted price of the lowest (selected) tenderer. Negotiations should be 
permissible only in very exceptional circumstances (single, substantially high tender, evident/obvious 
collusion, etc.) with prior government approval and that too by a high level committee. 

e. 

Standard f inc t iona l specijcations f o r goods 

To bring consistency and increase transparency, there is a need to develop standard functional 
specifications, particularly for goods that are usually procured by various implementing agencies. Placing 
of these specifications on the PSB website inviting comments from manufacturers, suppliers and users 
w i l l lead to refinement of specifications. 

J 

‘Tender Capacity ’ as a criteria f o r award of contracts 

“Tender Capacity” should be made a mandatory criteria for award of contracts. Specific 
requirements in this respect should be pre-disclosed in the tender documents. The contracts on hand need 
to be assessed to determine the available capacity net of current commitments and ability of the tenderer 

A p p e n d i x V 
P a g e 7 o f 10 

to perform the new contract satisfactorily, if awarded. In addition, where the tenderer is lowest in more 
than one tender or slice of a package, the qualification requirements to be satisfied by the lowest tenderer 
need to be the aggregate of the individual tenders or slices of a package. 

g. 

Electronic tendering 

One of the major steps towards e-governance is e-tendering. Systems are available to introduce 
electronic tendering in public agencies. This will substantially increase transparency, efficiency and 
reduce scope for mal-practice and corruption. The Procurement Law should also cover e-tendering 
aspects. 

h. 

Areas f o r improvement in the guidelines 

Some of the other procurement aspectdareas covered in the Guidelines which need to be 
clarified, supplemented, enlarged or strengthened are: 

e 

e 

e 

e 

e 

e 

e

Provisions for incorporating minimum functional specifications in accordance with national/ 
international standards for goods; ICTAD detailed specifications or other Sri Lankan standards 
for works; 
Specify the various methods of procurement including their applicability for contracts financed 
by the Government’s consolidated fund at a single place for easy usage by all executive agencies; 
Wide gap between the thresholds for optional and mandatory pre-qualification requirements; 
Adequate guidance to the implementing agencies on the incorporation of the price adjustment 
provision; 
Unusual provisions empowering the Secretary to waive liquidated damages for special reasons, if 
provided for in the tender documents; 
Restrictive provisions for sale of tender documents to only those who are registered contractors 
and members of NCCSAL; 
Stipulations on the date of start and close of issue (sale) of tender documents; 
Different tendering periods for tenders financed by internal and external sources; 
Different procedures for correction of errors and establishing the tender price for donor and 
Consolidated Fund financed tenders; 
Price and/or purchase preferences provision, and exemptions for submission of tender security 
deposit to a group of organizations (such as approved societies and parastatals); 
With regard to types of insurances to be taken out and coverage, removal of the stipulation that all 
insurance should be from government-owned insurance companies; 
Cumbersome procedures for evaluation of unbalanced tenders and different procedures for 
tenders financed from donor agencies and consolidated fund; and 
Procedures for hiring of consultants, methods of selection and types of contracts. 

Though a commendable effort has gone into the drafting of the Guidelines, they need revision to 
include provisions as discussed above and exclude those provisions which should be covered by the 
Standard Tender Documents. 

Append ix V 
P a g e 8 of I O 

Organization and Resources 

Procurement functions are mostly decentralized. The concerned Ministries and Provincial 
Councils are responsible for procurement within their organizations and the Guidelines govern public 
procurement in all organizations. The Guidelines are available for sale and all the procurement entities 
are aware of the Guidelines and the thresholds prescribed therein. However, the delegation of contracting 
authority is inadequate. Since tenders beyond a certain value have to be referred to the Cabinet for 
decision, the possibility of political interference in decision-making is a distinct possibility. 

Furthermore, there is no separate procurement cadre or procurement core group in the country 
and most of staff carrying out procurement functions are from general engineering or accounting 
backgrounds and are inexperienced and are not specially trained in procurement. Furthermore, contract 
administration is weak, resulting in cost and time over-runs. 

PSB was established to improve public procurement performance in Sri Lanka and improve the 
efficiency of procurement processes to expedite the economic and social development of the country for 
the betterment of the Sri Lankan people. However, the PSB has a lot of independent responsibilities- 
e.g., it also acts as a support office for MOF for preparation of briefs for the Cabinet Appointed Tender 
Board (CATB) sub-committee, as well as CATB and Cabinet; i t is involved in the appointment of 
members for TB and TECs. Therefore, PSB needs to be strengthened and manned by competent officers 
and technical experts, and should deal with planning, setting of standards and monitoring of outcomes and 
capacity building, including training. PSB should also be entrusted with the responsibility for 
implementation of the CPAR Action Plan. 

Procurement Capacity Building System and Institutions 

PSB contains a training unit. Due to the large number of officers requiring training in public 
procurement procedures, a “Train the Trainer” type approach has been adopted by PSB with selected 
senior officers in the key sector agencies being trained and supported to conduct training within their 
respective agencies. A training master plan has been prepared and PSB’s Training Unit has been 
conducting some programs. Nevertheless, the training effort is inadequate and has to be increased 
substantially to cover all staff involved in procurement functions. Courses should be developed for 
various levels and types of staff on a number of topics, including public procurement policies; rules; good 
practices; standard tender documents; evaluation of tenders; contract management, etc. The training 
master plan needs to be reviewed, updated and effectively implemented. Further, efforts are required to 
be made to include public procurement and contract administration’ courses in the curricula of 
engineering, commerce, law and business management courses at the Graduate and Post Graduate levels. 

Public Sector Management P e ~ o r m a n c e 

Contract administration and monitoring is neglected, reflecting poor implementation capability in 
general. Clear contract provisions and “right-sizing” of contracts play a vital role in efficient 
implementation. Similarly, clear and complete specifications and well-defined performance standards can 
reduce disputes and ensure satisfactory works contract performance. With respect to goods contracts, 
contract administration is also weak, particularly w i th respect to inspection and taking over. Even for 
consultancy contracts, the monitoring of the completion of all the stipulated tasks as per the “description 
of services’’ and the timing and contents of the reports to be submitted, is rather poor. 

A p p e n d i x V 
P a g e 9 of IO 

Performance on World Bank and ADB-financed Projects 

The most serious shortfalls in contract awards are due to: (i) delays in contract awards resulting 
from delays in carrying out procurement actions according to Guidelines, lack of authority given by 
executing agencies to project directors, delays in approval procedure of TEC and CATB and unfamiliarity 
with ADB Procurement Guidelines; (ii) delays in establishing project units and appointing project staff; 
(iii) time consuming procedures for land acquisition and resettlement; and (iv) delays in preparation of 
documents and TOR finalization; and (v ) inadequate counterpart funds and budget allocations. 

General Risk Assessment 

Donor agencies finance a substantial portion of public sector procurement in Sri Lanka. The 
government follows the procurement procedures as stipulated by the donor agencies in the Loadcred i t 
Agreements. Also, the government has issued the “Guidelines for Government Tender Procedure” which 
establish the procedures and are generally being followed for contracts financed from Government’s own 
Consolidated Fund. Implementation of contracts lacks efficiency and needs improving. However, there 
are inadequacies in the Guidelines and Standard Bidding Documents (SBDs). Public procurement would 
improve vastly if the recommendations made in this report are fully implemented. This may take some 
time, but with the introduction of SBDs, marginal improvements in the Guidelines, better implementation 
monitoring by PSB and intensified capacity building effort, S r i Lanka’s risk rating for procurement 
purposes could improve substantially. 

Competitiveness and Participation of Private Sector in Public Procurement: 

The private sector needs to be equally more efficient, competent, healthy, honest and vigilant if 
public procurement is to function effectively. The construction industry is in an infant stage in Sri Lanka 
and until recently, all big contracts have been awarded to foreign contractors. To develop the 
construction industry, ICTAD has been conducting training courses. With this, domestic contractors are 
participating in the tenders and also winning them. The consultant services profession has not developed 
in Sri Lanka and consultants are usually from outside the country. However, local consulting firms ando r 
individuals are becoming associated with foreign firms in the form of sub-consultants or individual 
experts. 

Performance on Public Procurement Contracts: Quality, Timeliness, Disputes 

Public procurement performance is not encouraging. Since technical auditing mechanisms are 
not in place, the quality of construction-particularly 
for small value contracts supervised by the 
employer-has 
scope for improvement. Contracts are generally not completed in time, thereby causing 
cost and time over-runs. Disputes may arise, but they are generally settled amicably without going to 
litigation. Mediation and arbitration are not very common. With a small manufacturing industry in the 
country, most of the finished goods and supplies are from outside the country and their quality is 
reported to be satisfactory. 

Summary of Recommendations 

In summary, the principal recommendations are the needs to: 

Enact a Public Procurement Law; 
Revise the Guidelines; 
Create an entity to provide oversight to public procurement policy; 

e
