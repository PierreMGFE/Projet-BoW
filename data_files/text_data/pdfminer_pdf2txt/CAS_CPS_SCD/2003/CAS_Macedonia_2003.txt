1. 
This i s the first I B R D only Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for the former Yugoslav 
Republic of Macedonia ( F YR Macedonia). This CAS , c o v e r i n g FY04 -06 , 
f o l l ow s a 
T rans i t iona l Support Strategy (TSS) that was discussed by the B o a r d o n September 13, 2001. 
The TSS ou t l ined a p r o g r am o f B a n k assistance t o support the pos t c o n f l i c t p r io r i t ies o f the 
coun t ry as i t emerged f r o m an in te rna l c o n f l i c t in 2001. T h e TSS p r o g r am cove red FY 0 2 , but 
was extended t o cove r F Y 0 3 when mac roeconom ic pe r fo rmance and progress on structural

IBRD p rog ram o f support for the p e r i o d FY04 -06 , w h i c h seeks t o build o n the ma rked ly 
imp roved mac roeconom ic management and structural r e f o rm progress since the elections.

Key issues for discussion by the Board. T h e IBRD support p r o g r am w o u l d scale up the 
Bank ’s support and aims t o take advantage o f the s tab i l i ty in FYR Macedon ia and the reg ion 
w h i c h now exists. K e y issues w h i c h the Execu t ive D i rec to rs m a y w i s h t o consider inc lude : 
I s the timing app rop r ia te f o r the B a n k t o m o v e f o rw a r d w i t h a n ew p r o g r am o f IBRD 
f inanc ia l support cons ide r ing FYR Macedonia’s recent h i s t o r y o f c o n f l i c t and the 
ongo ing challenges o f m a i n t a i n i n g social cohesion? 
D o the p r io r i t ies o u t l i n e d f o r support b y the B a n k p rom ise the most e f fec t ive use o f the 
Bank ’s resources, in cons ide ra t ion o f the broader set o f deve lopmen t challenges 
iden t i f ied and lessons lea rned b y the B a n k since 1998? 
I s the proposed f r am ew o r k f o r m o n i t o r i n g the results o f the C A S appropriate and 
feasible, cons ide r ing tha t e f fo r ts t o develop a f o rm a l na t iona l deve lopmen t strategy are at 
an ea r ly stage? 

3. 
A new mu l t i -e thn ic c o a l i t i o n gove rnmen t came t o p ow e r in N o v em b e r 2002 w i t h a 
mandate to imp lemen t the peace agreement that ended the 2001 c o n f l i c t ( k n ow n as the O h r i d 
Agreement), and t o tack le co r rup t ion , create jobs and address pove r ty . F o l l o w i n g concerted 
action b y the Gove rnmen t the mac roeconom ic ou t look has imp roved , and agreement has been 
reached w i t h the In te rna t iona l M o n e t a r y Fund (IMF) o n a r e f o r m p r o g r am supported b y a Stand 
B y Arrangement (app roved April 30, 2003). The B a n k p o r t f o l i o , w h i c h h a d deteriorated during 
the 2001 crisis, has n o w re tu rned t o health, and imp lemen ta t ion i s p roceed ing w e l l . 

4. 
Internal and regional peace offers a window of opportunity. F o r the first t im e since 
FYR Macedonia’s independence in 1991 b o t h the reg iona l and in te rna l env i ronmen ts are calm, 
o f f e r i n g an oppo r tun i ty t o ach ieve sustainable g row th . While FYR Macedon ia does n o t have a 
Pove r ty Reduc t ion Strategy Paper (PRSP) o r a N a t i o n a l Deve lopmen t Strategy, the O h r i d 
Agreement o f August 2001 and the S tab i l iza t ion and Assoc ia t ion Ag reemen t (SAA) w i t h the 
European U n i o n (EU), w h i c h was signed in April 2001, together f o r m a s t rong coun t ry -owned 
f ramewo rk f o r the deve lopmen t agenda. T h e Ohrid Ag reemen t p rov ides the p o l i t i c a l f ramewo rk 
th rough w h i c h the d iv is ions in Macedon ian society can be addressed and soc ia l cohesion

improved. Howeve r , the agreement i s complex, and imp lemen ta t ion w i l l requ i re ove rcom ing 
s ign i f ican t economic and p o l i t i c a l challenges. EU membe rsh ip rema ins an ove ra rch ing l o n g - 
term goal, and the SAA p rov ides strong incentives t o ove rcom ing p o l i t i c a l differences that have 
s tym ied economic r e f o r m in the past. T h e SAA ca l ls f o r the gradual ha rmon iza t ion o f 
Macedon ian l aw s and ins t i tu t ions w i t h those o f the Eu ropean U n i o n , as w e l l as setting spec i f ic 
timetables f o r the reduc t ion o f trade barriers be tween FYR Macedon ia , the EU, and other S A A 
countries. 

Increased regional economic integration can spur growth and reduce poverty. Ove r 

5. 
the last half-decade, econom ic g r ow t h in FRY Macedon ia has been incons is ten t . S ign i f ican t 
foreign inves tmen t f l ow s have n o t materialized, and unemp loymen t has rema ined h igh . An 
imp roved reg iona l env i ronmen t and FYR Macedon ia ’s strategic geographic loca t ion o f f e r an 
oppo r tun i ty f o r increased econom ic in teg ra t ion w i t h i n the r e g i o n and w i t h the EU, w h i c h w o u l d 
he lp spur investment, im p r o v e the competitiveness o f the p r iva te sector, and d r i v e g row th . To 
better understand and address the challenge o f t rans fo rm ing g r ow t h i n t o pove r ty reduction, there 
i s a need t o build an accurate, agreed baseline unde rs tand ing o f pove r ty , the capacity t o 
ob jec t ive ly m o n i t o r pove r ty ove r time, and develop the mechanisms b y w h i c h pove r ty analysis 
can i n f o r m p o l i c y . 

6. 
Desp i te the recent crises that h inde red development, i n c l u d i n g the 1999 K o s o v o c r is is 
and the 2001 in te rna l c o n f l i c t , progress has been made o n the econom ic r e f o rm agenda. This 
includes imp rovemen ts in the hea l th o f the f inanc ia l sector, and, t o a lesser extent, 
management o f p u b l i c resources. K e y economic challenges are t o fu r the r im p r o v e p u b l i c sector

The program i s selective and results can be monitored. T h e IBRD p r o g r am o f support

has been coo rd ina ted w i t h other development partners, w i t h w h o m the B a n k w i l l be w o r k i n g 
closely during imp lemen ta t ion . Case triggers have been ca re fu l ly chosen to ensure a graduated 
p rog ram o f support consistent w i t h the lessons lea rned ove r recen t years. A p r i o r i t y set o f 
measurable outcomes has been selected, based o n the Bank ’s compa ra t ive advantage and past 
and p lanned invo lvemen t , tha t can b e used t o t rack the effectiveness o f the C A S p rog ram . 

8. 
Risks. N o t a l l o f the risks t o the success o f the C A S p r o g r am can b e m i t iga ted b y the 
Bank. The threat o f renewed p o l i t i c a l t u rm o i l and e thn ic v io lence , though modest and 
diminishing, w i l l remain, especially cons ide r ing the d i f f i c u l t i e s that m a y b e encountered in 
imp lemen t ing the Ohrid Ag reemen t and con t inu ing unce r ta in ty as t o the future o f ne ighbo r ing 
Kosovo . The difficult econom ic r e f o rm agenda that l ies ahead m a y also create soc ia l stresses 
that c o u l d translate i n t o w a n i n g p o l i t i c a l c omm i tm e n t o n the pa r t o f the Gove rnmen t . T h e

This i s the f i rs t IBRD o n l y C A S f o r FYR Macedon ia , d e f i n i n g a p rog ram o f B a n k 
assistance f o r the p e r i o d FY 0 4 - 0 6 . The last full C A S was prepared in 1998, w h i c h ou t l ined a 
support p rog ram f o r FY99 -01 , based o n a b l e n d o f IDA and IBRD resources. A progress 
report was prepared in 1999 when an emergency scenario was t r igge red b y the K o s o v o crisis 
(see be low ) . W h i l e FYR Macedon ia graduated f r o m IDA o n J u l y 1, 2001, the B a n k prepared 
a TSS in August o f that year in response t o the outbreak o f an in te rna l con f l ic t . The TSS, 
wh ich cove red FY02 , ou t l ined excep t iona l access t o a further IDA a l loca t ion o f US$35 
m i l l i o n o n hardened terms. T h e coverage o f the TSS was extended th rough F Y 0 3 because o f 
delays in imp lemen ta t ion due t o con t inu ing p o l i t i c a l i n s t a b i l i t y w h i c h s lowed r e f o rm progress 
in the lead up t o the pa r l iamen ta ry e lec t ion in September 2002. 

2. 
Desp i te the recent crises, FYR Macedon ia n o w has an oppo r tun i ty t o rega in the 
economic m om e n t um that i t h a d established in the la t te r pa r t o f the las t decade. An im p r o v e d 
reg iona l c l ima te and increased impe tus f o r in teg ra t ion w i t h the EU can comb ine t o build on 
the substantial, a lbe i t inconsistent, progress that has been made towa rds t rans fo rm ing the 
Macedon ian economy since independence in 199 1. FYR Macedon ia can establish a v i r tuous 
cyc le in w h i c h ongo ing e thn ic reconc i l ia t ion and g r ow i n g soc ia l s tab i l i ty lays the basis f o r 
stronger econom ic g row th , reduced unemp loymen t , and fewe r households l i v i n g in pove r ty . 
Im p r o v i n g the qua l i ty and accoun tab i l i ty o f public ins t i tu t ions w i l l be a fundamental 
challenge, necessary b o t h t o unde rp in reconc i l ia t ion and also t o attract b a d l y needed domestic 
and fo re ign investment. FYR Macedon ia needs t o grasp the oppo r tun i ty a f fo rded b y i t s 
strategic loca t ion in Sou th Eas t Eu rope and i t s considerable progress towards economic 
t rans fo rma t ion t o date, and aggressively pursue the in teg ra t ion o f i t s economy w i t h those o f 
i t s neighbors and w i t h the EU. FYR Macedon ia w i l l need t o foster a compe t i t ive and 
dynam ic p r iva te sector to take advantage o f im p r o v e d access to r e g i o n a l ma rke ts .

The regional environment has improved, but risks remain. F o r the first time since 
independence in 1991, FYR Macedon ia faces b o t h reg iona l and domes t ic env i ronmen ts o f 
re la t ive p o l i t i c a l s tab i l i ty . The b reakup o f the fo rme r Soc ia l is t Fede ra l Repub l ic o f 
Yugos lav ia (SFRY), w h i c h began when S loven ia declared independence in 1991, resu l ted in a 
SFRY .' A l t h o u g h FYR Macedon ia escaped hos t i l i t ies w i t h i n i t s borders until 2001, tensions

were o f ten high th roughou t the 1990s due t o sp i l love r effects o f nea rby con f l ic ts . The coun t ry 
was under pa r t icu la r pressure because o f i t s mu l t i -e thn ic makeup, and U n i t e d N a t i o n (UN)

The SFRY consisted o f present day S loven ia , Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, FYR Macedon ia , and Serbia and 
' Acco rd ing to the 1994 census, the popu la t ion consists o f ethnic Macedonians (66.6 percent), ethnic A lban ians

c rackdown b y forces o f the Fede ra l Republic o f Yugos lav ia (FRY)4 o n an armed ethnic 
A lban ian insurgency in the Serbian p rov ince o f K o s o v o pushed about 350,000 refugees across 
the border i n t o FYR Macedon ia (the equivalent o f 17 percent o f the coun t ry ’s population). 
The K o s o v o crisis severely strained in te rna l s tab i l i ty and econom ic management in FYR 
Macedonia, severing k e y trade and transport links t o the north and p resen t ing a considerable 
human i ta r ian cha l lenge in manag ing and ca r ing f o r Kosova r refugees. With the m i l i t a r y 
in te rven t ion and f i n a n c i a l assistance o f the in te rna t iona l c omm u n i t y there was an ea r ly end to 
hostilities, mos t refugees q u i c k l y returned home, and the Macedon ian economy r a p i d l y 
recovered. 

Domestic peace has been re-established.

In ea r ly 2001, fighting erupted between 
Macedon ian gove rnmen t forces and ethnic A lban ian rebels in the no r thwes t r e g i o n o f FYR 
Macedonia. As fighting spread t o the outskirts o f the capital, a f u l l - b l o w n c i v i l war was 
feared. Howeve r , in August 2001, an in te rna t iona l ly med ia ted ceasefire l e d t o the d isa rm ing

p o l i t i c a l parties. This General F ramewo rk Ag reemen t f o r Peace (also k n o w n as the O h r i d

oppo r tun i ty that the im p r o v e d reg iona l security env i ronmen t o f fe rs . T h e elections were 
conducted peace fu l ly and we re endorsed b y in te rna t iona l m o n i t o r s as f ree and fa i r . The 
Together f o r Macedon ia coa l i t ion , headed b y the Soc ia l Democ ra t ic A l l i a n c e o f Macedon ia 
(SDSM), w o n 60 o f the 120 seats in Parliament. As has been the case w i th a l l governments 
since independence, the w i n n i n g e thn ic Macedon ian pa r ty op ted t o i n c l u d e in the Gove rnmen t 
one o f the ethnic A l b a n i a n parties. I n this case a coa l i t ion was f o rm e d w i t h the Democ ra t ic

The SDSM/DUI v i c t o r y represented a popu la r back lash against c o r r u p t i o n and i r regu la r 
pub l ic spending w h i c h h a d ba l looned in the p u b l i c sector in 2 0 0 1 and 2002 . T h e coa l i t ion

unemployment, and a l lev ia te pove r ty . 

Disagreement with neighboring Greece over the use o f the name “Republic o f Macedonia” led to a trade 
blockade during 1994-1995 , and international sanctions against the Federal Republic o f Yugoslavia (now Serbia 
and Montenegro) imposed i n 1992 (and a ban on transshipment o f products through the country in 1993 ) were 
not lifted until 2001. 
FRY adopted a new constitution in 2003 and changed i t s name to ‘Serbia and Montenegro’.

Box 1. The Ohrid Agreement 

The General Framework Agreement for Peace (the Ohrid Agreement) was signed on August 13, 2001 by the 
leaders o f the four main political parties i n FYR Macedonia at the time, representing ethnic Macedonians and 
ethnic Albanians. I t set out specific reforms and protections aimed at strengthening the rights o f minority 
communities, especially ethnic Albanians. The Ohrid Agreement institutes a minority veto over certain categories 
o f legislation, including laws that directly a f f e c t culture, use o f language, education, local government and 
personal documentation, and provides for affirmative action i n public employment, The agreement also mandates 
the increased use o f the Albanian language i n public affairs and decentralization o f the responsibility for many 
government functions to the municipalities. 
The amendments to the Constitution required by the Ohrid Agreement were adopted by the Parliament on 
November 16, 2001 (almost two months l a t e r than anticipated). After considerable debate and delay the new L a w 
on Local Self-Government was adopted by the Assembly on January 24, 2002. The Law assigns l o c a l 
governments responsibility for establishing and financing primary schools, providing social care for the disabled, 
and other soc ia l categories, and providing primary health care and health protection for persons without health 
insurance. The transitional provisions o f the law anticipate an implementation period of two years, specifying that 
existing sector-specific laws should be harmonized by the end o f 2003. 
An important aspect o f the Ohrid Agreement from an economic perspective i s that i t includes a commitment to 
create ‘equitable’ representation o f minorities i n the public administration, addressing present imbalances. This 
w i l l require the employment o f under represented minorities, which w i l l be difficult to fu l f i l l while containing 
wage spending. This challenge w i l l be amplified by the need to decompress wage structures i n public 
employment. Improving the representation o f minorities w i l l also compound difficulties i n implementing 
regulations intended to create a professional, merit-based c iv i l service. The achievement o f c iv i l se rv ice reform 
objectives w i l l be further complicated by the reduction i n central government employment and increase in l o c a l 
government employment implied by decentralization.

Macroeconomic stability has been maintained since the mid 1990s. FYR Macedon ia 
was the least deve loped o f the repub l ics o f the SFRY, and i t s economy h a d been con t rac t ing 
f o r mo re than s ix years at the t im e o f independence in 199 1 . Mac roeconom ic i n s t a b i l i t y in the 
ea r ly years, w h i c h saw ou tpu t collapse b y about 2 0 percent and the f isca l d e f i c i t b a l l o o n t o 13 
percent o f GDP, was countered by a s tab i l iza t ion p rog ram b e g i n n i n g in 1994 . This p rog ram 
succeeded in bringing i n f l a t i o n d o w n to s ing le digit leve ls and reduc ing the f isca l d e f i c i t t o 
1.4 percent o f GDP by 1996 , la rge ly th rough sharp cuts in transfers and subsidies and 
rescheduling o f ex te rna l debt. Ove r the n e x t coup le o f years the pace o f econom ic g r ow t h 
p icked up, p r ice s tab i l i ty was preserved, and f i s c a l balance was la rge ly ach ieved b y 1997 . 
Impo r tan t ly , gove rnmen t expend i tu re was slashed by nea r ly 10 percent o f GDP be tween 1994 
and 1998, a l though this achievement was subsequently unde rm ined b y the expend i tu re 
demands o f the 2 0 0 1 c o n f l i c t . (Tab le 1 .)

Recent crises have disrupted growth. T h e 1999 K o s o v o c r is is resu l ted in a doub le -

and consump t ion resu l t ing in GDP g r ow t h o f 4.3 percent in 1999, and dono r a i d h e l p i n g close 
the f isca l gap. T h e cu r ren t account d e f i c i t f e l l t o just b e l ow 1 percent o f GDP as o f f i c i a l and 
p r iva te transfers surged. B y 2000 exports h a d recovered t o the i r 1998 leve l , and the economy 
registered i t s h ighes t g r ow t h rate since independence (4.5 percent). 
In addition, 
the 
authorities returned t o the i r p r o g r am o f s t ruc tu ra l re fo rms that h a d s ta l led during the crisis. 
As a resu l t o f this q u i c k turnaround, ove ra l l performance f o r 1995 -2000 rema ined qu i te

A l t h o u g h FYR Macedon ia does n o t have a f o rm a l na t iona l deve lopmen t strategy, the

Agreement, and the SAA w i t h the Eu ropean U n i o n ( B o x 2). 
Political and social stability. T h e gove rn ing c o a l i t i o n has stressed the need to m o v e 
ahead r a p i d l y w i t h imp lemen ta t ion o f the Ohrid Ag reemen t as a means t o ma in ta in

requirements o f the Ohrid Agreement, such as inc reas ing the use o f the A lban ian language 
in p u b l i c affairs, have p r o v e n re la t ive ly easy t o imp lemen t . Howeve r , other elements, 
such as the decen t ra l iza t ion o f m a n y func t ions and services and inc reas ing m i n o r i t y 
emp loymen t in the p u b l i c administration, present impo r tan t challenges. M a i n t a i n i n g

f lou r ished , pa r t icu la r ly in areas where p u b l i c order b r o k e d o w n during the 2001 con f l ic t . 
Creating jobs . T h e p o o r pe r fo rmance o f the f o rm a l labo r ma rke t and high rates o f

Tackling corruption. A l t h o u g h o f f i c i a l co r rup t ion has been a feature o f Macedon ian

pe r iod between the signing o f the Ohrid Ag reemen t and the 2002 elections. P o l i t i c a l 
patronage and in te r fe rence in the ope ra t ion o f the p r iva te sector also appear as serious 
imped imen ts t o the deve lopmen t o f an e f f ic ien t ma rke t system and serve as deterrents t o 
investment. T a c k l i n g co r rup t ion was a k e y p l a n k in the e lec to ra l p l a t f o rm o f the

Box 2. The Stabilization and Association Agreement (SAA) w i th the EU 

FYR Macedonia, a long w i t h f o u r other countries in the reg ion (Bosn ia and Herzegov ina , Croatia, Serbia and 
Mon tenegro and Albania), receives substantial EU support a imed at advancing the r e f o rm process in the coun try 
in order to enable i t to draw closer to the EU and to integrate i n t o i t s structures. T o th is end, the EU designed a 
regional concept f o r these countries, the "s tab i l iza t ion and association process", and i t developed a new, ta i lo r - 
made category o f agreements f o r the re levan t group o f countries, the S A A . 

FYR Macedon ia i s a pioneer coun try f o r the S A A . T h e General A f f a i r s C o u n c i l o f the EU issued the required 
nego t ia t ing mandate o n 2 4 January 2000, and negotiations were successfully conc luded on 24 November 2000 
w i t h the i n i t i a l i n g o f the Agreement. The S A A was signed in Luxembou rg on 9 Apr i l 2001 but remains to be 
ra t i f ied b y the na t iona l parliaments o f a l l the EU member states. 

The trade section o f the Agreemen t entered i n t o force separately as an i n t e r im agreement e f fec t ive f r om June, 
2001. This confers upon F Y R Macedon ia asymmetric pre feren t ia l trade access to the EU, representing a cruc ia l 
step fo rwa rd g iven that the EU i s i t s mos t impo r tan t trad ing partner w i t h a 42 percent share o f the coun try 's 
~ overa l l trade vo lume . 

The i n t e r im agreement envisages the step-by-step establishment o f a f r e e trade area w i t h i n ten years after entry 
in to force o f the agreement, i.e. b y June 201 1 at the latest. Sensitive products, in pa r t icu la r in agr icu l ture and 
fisheries, are subject to special trans i t iona l ru les du r ing the first few years, to be l i f t e d o r adapted as the 
imp lemen ta t ion o f the agreement continues. 

W i t h the S A A , FYR Macedon ia w i l l have a t i t s disposal an ins trumen t enab l ing the coun try t o achieve the 
gradual a l ignmen t o f laws, ins t i tu t ions , and po l ic ies w i t h the "acquis communau ta ire" . Such a l ignmen t should 
enable h igher FDI f lows , better access to markets, and h igher grow th . The S A A i s in many ways s im i la r to the 
Europe Agreements, w h i c h have been conc luded w i t h today's candidate countries f r o m Cen tra l and Eastern 
Europe. Mo reove r , i t earmarks funds f o r FYR Macedon ia w i t h i n the f ramewo rk o f the EU Commun i ty 
Assistance f o r Reconstruction, Deve lopmen t and S tab i l iza t ion Program (CARDS) , w h i c h i s designed to support 
the s tab i l iza t ion and association process.

Public expenditure management has improved, but much remains to be done. A

spending, operate ou ts ide o f the cen t ra l government budget and the treasury and w i t h weak 
oversight and f i n a n c i a l con t ro ls . O f these, the Pension and D i s a b i l i t y Fund and the Hea l th

The formulation o f the CAS has benefited significantly from a Country Economic Memorandum which i s

and budgeting process. 

V I I . Risks to t h e Success o f t h e Bank’s program 

7 7 . 
Political risks are substantial. The Ohrid Agreement i s t o some extent unw ie ldy and 
complex, but i t s imp lemen ta t ion i s p o l i t i c a l l y essential for the preservation o f peace between 
ethnic groups in FYR Macedon ia . Peace and stability, in turn, are absolute prerequisites fo r the 
achievement o f the C A S objectives, and the broader goa l o f pove r ty reduction. Renewed ethnic 
d iv is ion and ins tab i l i ty c o u l d resu l t i f the imp lemen ta t ion o f the Ohrid Agreement appears to 
stall. The unresolved status o f Kosovo also remains a source o f po ten t ia l con f l ic t in the region. 
The Bank i s n o t w e l l p laced t o m i t iga te such r i s k s . Howeve r , ongo ing assistance t o overcome 
the technical d i f f icu l t ies o f imp lemen ta t ion o f the Agreement i s p r o v i n g he lp fu l . 

7 8 . 
There are also p o l i t i c a l risks associated w i t h the imp lemen ta t ion o f the proposed 
r e f o rm p rog ram . G i v e n already high unemployment, i t w i l l be pa r t icu la r ly difficult to sustain 
po l i t ica l support f o r unpopu la r reforms, inc lud ing re fo rms o f the p u b l i c administration and 
parastatals, pens ion and labo r ma rke t reforms, and enterprise restructuring. 
Ins tab i l i ty in the 
government coa l i t ion c o u l d resu l t in r e f o rm delays. G i v e n recent h is to ry , fo re ign investors are 
l i k e l y t o rema in pa r t icu la r ly sensitive to even temporary setbacks, and a negative shift in 
sentiment c o u l d unde rm ine needed FDI in f lows , donor support, and g row th . The B a n k can 
m i t iga te such r i s k s , b y w o r k i n g closely w i t h the government t o ensure that complementary 
supporting programs are in place t o m i n im i z e adverse sho r t - te rm social impacts o f the r e f o rm 
program supported b y the C A S . Such considerations w i l l be especially impo r tan t f o r the 
proposed res t ruc tu r ing o f SOEs and the reforms to the social p ro tec t ion system and labo r 
markets. 

7 9 . 
Macroeconomic vulnerabilities also exist. 
En te r ing the C A S period, the g loba l 
economic ou t look has m a j o r uncertainties. S lowe r than expected g r ow t h in FYR Macedonia’s 
m a i n t rad ing partners o r h ighe r than expected w o r l d o i l p r ices w o u l d unde rcu t domestic 
g row th . F isca l revenues w o u l d b e affected, as w o u l d the sus ta inab i l i ty o f the country’s 
expenditure p o l i c y ove r the m e d i um term, m a k i n g o n g o i n g re fo rms m o r e d i f f i c u l t t o a f fo rd . 
Dec l ines in in te rna t iona l business confidence, pa r t icu la r ly due to fu r the r i n s t a b i l i t y in the 
region, c o u l d limit f l ow s o f in te rna t iona l capital, again unde rcu t t ing the country’s g r ow t h 
scenario. S lowe r than expected r e f o rm progress c o u l d also resu l t in poo re r g r ow t h outcomes 
than forecast. In the even t o f a downs ide scenario, the structure o f p u b l i c debt c o u l d leave 
FYR Macedon ia vu lne rab le . 

80 . 
The selective Bank program will rely on sustained donor coordination. A selective 
approach b y the B a n k necessarily entails risks that other partners m a y n o t p e r f o rm as expected, 
wh ich may leave B a n k in te rven t ions isolated and ine f fec t ive . The Bank p rog ram w i l l be closely 
coordinated w i t h those o f other donors, o n a component basis, in the areas o f p u b l i c sector 
management re fo rm , education, infrastructure, f inanc ia l sector deve lopmen t and regu la to ry and 
jud ic ia l reform. Mo reove r , the B a n k w i l l r e l y o n i t s dono r partners t o take the lead in k e y 
sectors such as S M E development. ru ra l development, and democracy and r u l e o f l aw . The 
effectiveness o f the Bank ’s programs in ach iev ing the C A S outcomes w i l l be re l ian t o n the 

32 

e f fec t ive de l ive ry o f support p rog rammed b y other donors, and v ice versa. The strengthening 
o f the r o l e o f the Bank ’s C o u n t r y O f f i c e and con t inued close d ia logue w i t h partners w i l l 
m i t iga te this risk. Close contact in the f i e l d w i l l endeavor t o ensure the B a n k w i l l have 
su f f ic ien t wa rn ing and f l e x i b i l i t y t o adapt i t s in te rven t ions shou ld the programs o f donor 
partners change o r be constrained. 

V I I I . Concluding Remarks 

8 1. 
The p lanned p rog ram of IBRD assistance t o FYR Macedon ia ove r the nex t three years 
presents an impo r tan t oppo r tun i ty f o r the coun t ry t o bene f i t f r o m scaled-up B a n k assistance at 
a c r i t i c a l t ime . FYR Macedon ia faces s ign i f ican t challenges t o ove rcome the in te rna l 
d iv is ions and c o n f l i c t that have p reven ted pove r ty reduc t ion in recent years, as w e l l as to 
complete the t rans fo rma t ion o f i t s economy that began over ten years ago. T h e S A A process 
and the prospects o f even tua l EU membe rsh ip p r o v i d e a p ow e r f u l f ramewo rk t o guide i t s 
efforts, and the B a n k i s w e l l p laced t o support this agenda in coo rd ina t ion w i t h other donors. 
Th rough imp lemen ta t ion o f the S A A and the Ohrid Agreement, as w e l l as broader structural 
re fo rms o f the economy, the Gove rnmen t can make s ign i f ican t progress towards putting in 
place the po l ic ies and p r o g r am that w i l l reduce pove r ty ove r the m e d i um term, and the IBRD
