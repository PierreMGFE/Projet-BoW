EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

i. 

Backg round . This i s the f i r s t full Coun try Assistance Strategy (CAS) f o r Ecuador since 1993 . 
F o l l ow i n g the 1993 C A S (R93 -85 ) , discussed by the Boa rd o n June 1, 1993 , a Progress Repor t was 
prepared in 1996-97 due to vo la t i le po l i t ica l circumstances, and was discussed by the Boa rd o n M a r c h 25 , 
1997 , while a second Progress Repor t (R2000-102) was prepared f o l l ow i n g the change in Adm in is t ra t ion 
in January 2000 , and was discussed by the Boa rd o n June 15, 2000 . This C A S fo r 2003-07 i s grounded 
in coun try-w ide C A S consultations undertaken in JanuaryFebruary 2003 , and p rog ramm ing discussions

ii. C o u n t r y Con tex t a n d the Government ’s P rog r am . Ecuador has impor tan t na tura l resources 

and unique b iod ivers i ty , bu t i t has n o t f u l f i l l e d i ts potential. Rea l income pe r person has remained 
unchanged du r ing the past tw o decades and the vast ma jo r i ty o f the popu la t ion has rema ined poor . In 
1999 Ecuador experienced i ts wors t economic cr is is in a century. Rea l income pe r capita s h r a d s 9 
percent, as a resu l t o f severe external shocks and in terna l factors. The external shocks inc luded con tag ion 
f r om crises in As ian and other emerging markets, E l N i f io - re la ted flooding, a sharp f a l l o i l and banana 
prices, and a collapse in shrimp p roduc t ion due t o diseases. 
In te rna l factors inc luded pers is ten t ly poo r 
f isca l management that led to a de fau l t on pub l ic external debt in August 1999 , and a severe bank ing 
cr is is that entailed the closure of almost ha l f the banks in the system. The na t iona l currency ( fo rme r ly the 
suc re ) was also repeatedly devalued before the Government decided to do l lar ize in January 2000. A f t e r 
2000 , the economy experienced a fragile recovery as a new Adm in is t ra t ion began t o imp lemen t economic 
reforms, but lack o f po l i t ica l support le f t the re fo rm agenda large ly incomplete. 
iii. The November 2002 elections produced a sh i f t in power towards poorer Ecuadorians. Mr. L u c i o 
Gutierrez was elected President with support from a coa l i t ion o f indigenous, peasant and labor 
organizations. His first steps in office were to launch a Na t iona l D ia logue and t o take austerity measures 
to stabilize the fiscal accounts. W h i l e consensus s t i l l has to be developed around a na t iona l long- term 
development agenda, the new Adm in is t ra t ion has announced a med ium- term development strategy that 
focuses o n p romo t ing economic g row th through competitiveness, reduc ing pove r ty and exclusion, and 
f igh t ing corruption. Immed ia te steps invo lve re form ing customs, taxes and labo r laws to consolidate the 
Government’s f isca l pos i t ion and t o begin t o increase the f l e x i b i l i t y o f the economy in response to 
external shocks. In addition, the Government i s developing proposals to strengthen the coverage and 
qua l i ty o f education and hea l th services, and to imp rove the targeting o f i t s soc ia l assistance programs. 
iv. 
T h e B a n k G roup ’s P r o g r a m a n d Risks. The W o r l d B a n k G roup has developed a Coun try 
Assistance Strategy (CAS) for the pe r iod 2003-07 w i t h the ob jec t ive o f he lp ing the Government to 
achieve i ts medium te rm development strategy. The t h r e e key goals o f the C A S are to (a) consolidate the 
macroeconomic framework and l a y the foundations fo r d ive rs i f ied and sustainable economic g row th and 
pove r ty reduction; (b) increase opportunities and broaden access to economic resources, and make the 

1 

needed structural re forms soc ia l ly sustainable by m i t iga t ing the impacts o n the poor; and (c) strengthen 
governance by helping the Au thor i t ies build an accountable and e f f ic ien t government whose services are 
accessible fo r a l l Ecuadorians. 
v. 
T o achieve these goals, the C A S wou ld combine f inanc ia l and technical assistance f r om the Bank , 
including the W o r l d Bank Institute, w i t h demand-driven support f r om the In tema t iona l F inance 
Corpora t ion (IFC) and the Mu l t i la te ra l Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA). The B a n k envisions up t o 
$1,050 m i l l i o n in new loan commitments over the nex t fou r years in the base case scenario, with o n 
average fou r operations pe r year. Unde r a high case scenario, w i th imp roved macroeconomic 
management and pro jec t implementation, the ce i l ing fo r new B a n k lend ing cou ld b e up t o $50 m i l l i o n 
h igher per year. Unde r a l o w case scenario o f limited reforms o r weak imp lemen ta t ion o f Bank-supported 
projects, the Bank does no t env is ion any adjustment lending, and the number and value o f investment 
loans wou ld be reduced to less than h a l f the base case envelope, and focused o n d irec t pove r ty a l lev ia t ion . 
vi, 
Non - lend ing ac t iv i t ies wou ld inc lude analytical and adv isory ac t iv i t ies related t o hea l th insurance, 
education, ru ra l development, nu tr i t ion , the environment, the f inanc ia l sector, constraints t o g row th and 
pove r ty assessments, among other areas, as w e l l as diagnostic and capacity building assistance through 
the W o r l d Bank Ins t i tu te and support fo r environmental pro tec t ion through the G loba l Env ironmen ta l 
Fac i l i ty . These ana ly t ica l and advisory ac t iv i t ies wou ld pave the w a y f o r re la ted lending ac t iv i t ies . On 
the lend ing side, the Bank has iden t i f ied education, ru ra l production, u rban pove r ty reduction, f inanc ia l 
services fo r the poor, r u r a l roads, competitiveness, and na tura l resources management as possible new 
areas fo r support that d i rec t ly respond to needs iden t i f ied by c i v i l society, together w i th j u d i c i a l r e f o rm 
and ins t i tu t iona l re fo rm in order to promo te increased transparency and e f f ic iency in the pub l ic sector. 
Add i t iona l support w o u l d also be p rov ided fo r indigenous and A fro-Ecuador ian people’s development 
and fo r ru ra l water supply and sanitation. These areas w o u l d be complemented by assistance with 
re forms a imed at conso l ida t ing the f isca l pos i t ion and p romo t ing g row th through competitiveness, and fo r 
imp rov ing the quan t i ty and qua l i ty o f social sector expenditures to be t ter serve the poor . 
vii. 
IFC ’s p r io r i t ies during the CAS pe r iod w i l l inc lude techn ica l assistance fo r p romo t ing fo re ign

Given the cha l leng ing investment climate, IFC ’s ab i l i ty to invest in the export, f inanc ia l and in fras truc ture 
sectors w i l l continue t o depend o n progress w i t h economic reform, improvemen t in the regu la tory 
framework, and macroeconomic and f inanc ia l sector s tab i l i ty . MIGA i s cons ider ing expanded support 
through investment advice and guarantees, although i t w i l l c lear ly b e marke t driven. 
v i i i . 
Ecuador continues to face impor tan t ex tema l r i s k s , pa r t icu la r ly re la ted t o terms-of-trade shocks 
and compe t i t ive pressures from trad ing partners, wh ich can be pa r t icu la r ly des tab i l iz ing in a do l la r ized 
economy. In te rna l r i s k s inc lude po ten t ia l resistance t o f isca l and structural re forms by social movements, 
and lack o f Congressional support for reforms. W h i l e measures w i l l be taken to m i t iga te these risks-for 
example by p romo t ing competitiveness and market f lex ib i l i ty , insu la t ing the budget more f r om sharp 
swings in o i l prices, imp rov ing the quan t i ty and qua l i ty o f soc ia l expenditures, and consensus building 
through the Na t iona l D ia logue and other processes-these 
r i s k s cannot be e l im ina ted entirely, and 
significant po l i t ica l , economic and social risks w i l l remain. O n the other hand, Ecuador also faces a 
unique oppor tun i ty t o re fo rm the structure o f i ts po l i t ica l economy towa rd a more par t ic ipa tory and 
transparent society, together w i t h an economy characterized by increased s tab i l i ty and greater g row th and

to reduc ing pover ty ; the strong indigenous presence in the Government w i t h the i r trad i t ions o f 
par t ic ipa tory processes t o ensure consensus building and o f pub l ic oversight to strengthen transparency; 
and the benefits of greater economic s tab i l iza t ion that have thus fa r come w i t h dollarization, a l l represent 
a s ign i f ican t break f rom the past that warrants greater B a n k co l labora t ion w i t h and support fo r Ecuador.

MEMORANDUM OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE 
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT 
AND THE INTERNATIONAL FINANCE CORPORATION 
AND THE MULTILATERAL INVESTMENT GUARANTEE AGENCY 
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A 
COUNTRY ASSISTANCE STRATEGY 
FOR THE REPUBLIC OF ECUADOR 

I. INTRODUCTION 

1. 

2. 

Ecuador has unique natural and culttlral resources, but has not fulfilled i t s potential. In spite 
of the country’s richness, real income per person has not grown during the past 20 years, and the vast 
majority of the population has remained poor. The macroeconomic difficulties faced by Ecuador over the 
past 20 years are largely explained by i t s po l i t ica l and socioeconomic context (Section 1I.A). A culture o f 
state paternalism toward both wealthy and poorer Ecuadorians, reinforced b y large growth in public 
sector resources after Ecuador began exporting o i l in the early 1970s, was complemented by one o f the 
lowest tax-to-GDP ratios in the region (along w i t h Guatemala, Ecuador had tax-to-GDP ratios under 10 
percent until 2000). This in turn resulted in persistent fiscal deficits, which were financed by borrowing 
against o i l revenues or printing local currency (formerly the sucre). Thus the national debt quadrupled 
between 1980 and 2000, while real GDP per capita remained unchanged, and price in f la t ion averaged 30 
percent in the late 1990s. The high rates o f in f la t ion in turn led to pressures t o devalue the sucre, which 
between mid-1998 and January 2000 lost threequarters o f i t s value (moving f r om S.6,OOO to S.28,OOO per 
U . S . dollar) before the government decided t o dollarize in January 2000. 
The late 1990s witnessed Ecuador’s worst economic c r is is in more than a century, as a resu l t o f 
a combination o f internal and external factors. The internal factors included persistently poor fiscal 
management that eventually led to a default on external debt in August 1999, and a collapse in the 
banking sector that same year, resulting in the freezing o f bank deposits and the closure o f almost ha l f the 
banks in the system, at a cost o f at least 15 percent o f GDP. The external factors included a sharp capital 
outflow from the region as a resu l t o f contagion fo l low ing crises in Asian and other emerging markets; 
the simultaneous decline in Ecuador’s three ma in exports as o i l and banana prices collapsed and diseases 
ravaged shrimp production; and close to $3 b i l l i o n in damages due t o E l Niiio-related flooding in coastal 
regions. B y January 2000, the economy was devastated by a severe economic crisis, rising poverty, 
default on public debt, frozen bank deposits and a collapsing banking system, production systems in 
disarray, and a major indigenous uprising supported by members o f the military. 
The decision of 
the new Administration that assumed power in January 2000 to maintain 
dolhrization made it clear that Ecuador could no longer look back. With or without dollarization, a 
series o f structural reforms became essential in Ecuador to increase economic growth, share the benefits 
o f growth more evenly, and to improve governance, making government services accessible to all. The 
government o f former President Noboa took several steps t o implement reforms, including the so-called 
Trole Z and Trole ZZ laws o f 2000, that established t h e basis fo r dollarization and began to increase 
flexibility in labor markets and increase the scope fo r private participation in services long provided by 
public enterprises. In addition, the Fiscal Responsibility L aw approved in 2002 set clear l i m i t s on 
expenditure growth and indebtedness, as dollarization imposes a new discipline on t h e country (Section 
II.C). The improved fiscal position relative t o the pre-dollarization period, the progressive unfreezing o f 
deposits, and improved o i l prices, together w i t h a more stable environment under dollarization, led to a 
recovery in economic growth that s t i l l needs to be consolidated over the next few years.

The November 2002 elections resulted in a major shi@ in power toward poorer Ecuadorbns. 
Mr. L u c i o Gu t ierrez was elected President w i t h support f r o m a coa l i t ion o f indigenous, peasant, and labor 
organizations o n a mandate t o fight corruption, promote economic recovery, and reduce pover ty b y 
imp rov ing econom ic justice. President Gutierrez’ s election re f lec ts widespread re jec t ion o f the po l i t ics - 
as-usual that had produced t w o decades o f weak economic performance and rising poverty. H i s f i r s t steps 
in o f f ice were t o launch a Na t iona l D ia logue and to take austerity measures t o stabilize the f isca l accounts 
(Section V). In addition, the Adm in is t ra t ion has developed plans t o in troduce several key reforms in 
leg is la t ion t o Congress, as pa r t o f i t s economic re fo rm program, that are designed t o strengthen and 
stabilize the f isca l accounts, promo te re forms in f inanc ia l and labo r markets, increase the e f f ic iency o f 
pub l ic enterprises, and increase access to and the qua l i ty o f education, health, and other pub l ic services 
(Section V). The Government’s med ium- term economic r e f o rm p rog ram has received IMF support 
through the approva l o f a new 13-month Stand-By Arrangement. 
The current environment presents r i s k s but also an important opportunity for Ecuador. There 
are several r i s k s t o the success of t h i s program, due t o con t inued macroeconomic vu lnerab i l i ty , resistance

11. THE COUNTRY CONTEXT 

A. Political, Socioeconomic, and H is to r ica l Context 

6. 
Ecuador is a country with unique advantages. I t i s strategically loca ted at a prom inen t pa r t o f 
Sou th Ame r ica o n the Pac i f ic Ocean, and has s ign i f ican t o i l reserves in b o t h the coastal reg ion and the 
in ter ior . A l though Ecuador i s one o f the smallest countries in South America, i t s ma in land combines a 
t rop ica l coastal reg ion (the Costa), a fe r t i le highland va l ley in the Andes (referred t o b y Humbo ld t as the 
“Avenue o f the Volcanoes”), and a large ly unspo i led Amazon in ter ior , w h i c h together w i t h the un ique 
Galapagos Is lands 600 m i les offshore, make Ecuador one o f the mos t b iod iverse countries in the wor ld , 
w i t h an estimated 9.2 species pe r square k i lome ter . This na tu ra l richness has enabled Ecuador t o compete 
successfully over t ime in the produc t ion and expor t o f cocoa, bananas, coffee, shrimp, tuna, and more 
recen t ly ornamental ho r t icu l tu re and p a lm o i l , and t o produce such staples as maize, beans, and rice, as 
w e l l as livestock, ma in ly f o r the domestic market. 
In add i t ion t o this r i c h na tura l d ivers i ty , Ecuador enjoys a s ign i f ican t cu l tu ra l d ivers i ty . 
popu la t ion o f 12 m i l l i o n combines a predom inan t mestizo popu la t ion w i t h indigenous nations and peoples 
based primarily in the h igh land reg ion (the S ie r ra ) and the Amazon (estimated at 15 t o 25 percent o f the 
population), and an impor tan t A f ro -Ecuado r ian popu la t ion (estimated at 5 percent o f Ecuadorians), 
ma in ly in nor thern provinces and in the t w o largest cities, Guayaqu i l and Quito. The ethnic d ivers i ty 
brings w i t h i t a richness o f languages, cultures, and traditions. 
8. 
I n spite of its natural and cultural wealth, Ecuador has long had a turbulent and fragmented 
political history. This i s ev inced b y 19 Cons t i tu t ions since independence in 1830-the most recent o f 
wh ich was ra t i f ied in 1998. M a n y o f the issues con t r ibu t ing t o the turbulence rema in unsolved, inc lud ing 
reg iona l tensions between the Costa, centered around the p o r t c i ty o f Guayaquil, and the Sierra, centered 
in the cap i ta l c i ty , Qu i to . One consequence o f the reg iona l r iva l ry , w h i c h dates back t o co lon ia l times, i s 

7 . 

I t s

that the central Government has had limited effective power, and Congress has been characterized by an 
unusually large number o f po l i t ica l parties fo r a country o f Ecuador's size, making effective governance a 
challenge. This r iva l ry has also made i t harder t o agree on acceptable mechanisms fo r decentralization. 
9. 
Another important legacy o f the colonial period i s a history o f exclusion o f the majority o f the 
population. Ecuador has among the highest Gini coefficients o f income inequality and o f inequality in 
land distribution in the world. The wealthiest 10 percent o f the population, w i t h 42 percent o f GDP, ea rn 
70 times more than the poorest 10 percent, w i th only 0.6 percent o f GDP. The history o f exclusion and 
serfdom based on large haciendas or landholdings as recently as the last century eventually gave rise t o 
major indigenous uprisings in the 1990s. In addition, a significant incidence o f entrepreneurial rent- 
seeking through trade preferences and tax avoidance or evasion, often coupled w i th cost containment v ia 
lowering real wages, have constrained productivity-based economic growth and resulted in disaffected 
labor movements in the private sector. On the other hand, public sector employees have acquired 
privileged positions and significant political clout, which in a context o f l im i ted accountability and public 
disclosure has in certain cases led to allegations o f rent-seeking and corruption. Mo re generally, Ecuador 
has in recent years consistently ranked among the countries w i t h the highest perceived incidence o f 
corruption in L a t i n America. 
10. 
I n this context, there have been increasing demands among indigenous movements and social 
classes for greater participation in political strategy setting and decisionmaking. The current 
environment presents an opportunity fo r strengthening participatory planning, budgeting, and consensus- 
building processes that have flourished at the local level in several municipalities and in at least one 
province, up t o the national leve l in the f o rm o f a National Dialogue. This process w i l l take time t o 
establish roots at the national leve l and to have a clear impact on the budget; however, a successful, open, 
and participatory National Dialogue process promises the beginnings o f a comprehensive development 
framework fo r Ecuador, and the possibility o f making a sustainable impact on reducing poverty. 

B. Poverty and Social Cond it ions 

11. 
Poverty and inequality have increased in the past two decades. Real economic growth per 
capita in Ecuador was negative during 1980-89 (-0.6 percent), and was zero during 1990-99. On the 
other hand, the Gini coefficient has increased steadily over the past two decades, reaching 0.62 fo r urban 
areas as o f 2001. That year the richest quintile o f the population earned 64 percent o f incomes, wh i le the 
poorest quintile earned 1.7 percent. W i t h n o growth in rea l income per capita and increasing inequality, 
Ecuador had experienced rapidly growing poverty over the past two decades even before going through 
i t s worst economic crisis o f the last century in 1999, when real income per capita fe l l 9 percent. 
12. 
Poverty, as measured b y consumption indicators (that i s , the proportion o f the population that 
cannot afford the basic consumption basket), rose f rom 34 percent t o 56 percent o f the population 
between 1995 and 1999, reaching 77 percent among ru ra l inhabitants and over 90 percent among 
indigenous ru ra l communities. One-third o f the rural population in Ecuador in 1999 was characterized b y 
extreme poverty, that is , they were unable to afford the c r i t ica l i t e m o f the consumption basket.' In 
terms o f income indicators fo r poverty, most o f the gains in urban poverty reduction during 1990-97 were 
lost in the subsequent crisis (Figure l), although poverty in terms o f income has declined again since 
dollarization in 2000. One-third o f urban dwellers and 60 percent o f ru ra l inhabitants in Ecuador l ived on 
less than $2 per person per day in 2001. This represents a decline f r om 40 percent o f urban and 7 0 
percent o f ru ra l inhabitants in 2000. There is , therefore, an important share o f the poor who are no t 
chronically poor, but rather who slip back in to poverty during economic downturns, and who do not have 
access t o an adequate countercyclical safety net to protect them.

consumption measures o f poverty. In addition, a Bank Poverty study i s planned for 2003.

13. 
Although the economy has grown and poverty has declined since 2000, the benefits o f economic 
growth since dollarization have accrued t o a greater extent to wealthier Ecuadorians, and inequality has 
continued to r ise . Between 1999 and 2001, the G in i coefficient rose f r om 0.57 t o 0.62, as new 
employment opportunities fo r workers lagged behind the recovery in economic growth, and a large one- 
time adjustment in prices led t o an in i t ia l decline in real wages, since the latter necessarily need t o be 
related to increases in productivity. 
14. 
Who are the poor in Ecuador? In addition to being more prevalent in ru ra l than in urban areas, 
poverty i s more prevalent among indigenous and Afro-Ecuadorian populations than among white mestizo 
populations, higher among female-headed than male-headed households, and more prevalent in the 
Amazon, central highland regions (such as Chimborazo and Cotopaxi), or certain coastal regions (such as 
Esmeraldas, Los Rios, Manabi) than in the provinces that surround Quito and Guayaquil (see Annex Map 
o f Ecuador). 
15. 
Since wages are the primary source o f income fo r poor households, poverty i s higher among the 
unemployed and underemployed who, respectively, account for 8 percent and 55 percent o f the 
economically active population, than among households headed b y workers employed in the formal 
sector. In urban areas, l ow human capital and productivity and lack o f employment opportunities are the 
underlying drivers o f poverty. In ru ra l areas, poverty i s t ied t o l ow on-farm and o f f - fa rm productivity, 
which i s the resu l t o f inadequate technology and infrastructure, together w i t h lack o f access to land and 
credit, and inadequate human capital development-according 
t o agricultural census data, only 1 in 14 
farmers has completed primary school. 
16. 
The poor are also l ike ly t o have significant unmet basic needs, especially in ru ra l areas. On ly 25 
percent o f the population i s covered by public health insurance, and about 30 percent have no access t o 
basic health care services. Net primary enrollments are unchanged at 90 percent since 1990, while ne t 
secondary enrollments increased only 1 percent during t h e 1990s to 44 percent. At the primary level, one 
in f ive children in the poorest quintile i s not enrolled, wh i le school participation by the richest decile i s 
100 percent. On average, Ecuadorians have 7.5 years o f education, but only 5 years in rural areas, and 2.5 
years among indigenous Ecuadorians. One-third o f rural households do not have access t o safe water or 
electricity, and only 3 percent o f ru ra l homes (and only 15 percent o f a l l homes in Ecuador) have access 
to telephones. Poverty also correlates w i t h low-quality lands and environmental degradation in ru ra l 

4 

areas, and exposure to unsafe water, precarious housing, and deficient waste disposal services in urban 
areas. 
17. 
Women and children are particularly vulnerable. Women have lower educational completion 
rates than men (64 percent compared to 69 percent at the primary level), and higher illiteracy rates (12 
percent compared to 8 percent fo r men, w i th a substantially larger gender literacy gap in the indigenous 
population). Consequently, women have fewer employment opportunities, especially in urban areas in 
the Coast, where unemployment rates are significantly higher fo r women than fo r men (20 percent 
compared to 8 percent), and earn salaries that are one-third lower than fo r men. Despite passage o f the 
F ree Motherhood Law, one-quarter o f Ecuadorian women do no t receive any prenatal care, and the 
maternal mortality rate, at 159 per 100,000 l ive births, i s high. Gender i s also an important variable in 
household coping strategies, w i t h more women jo in ing the labor force during downturns, but taking on 
poorly paid and precarious wo rk in the informal sector. Similarly, children are withdrawn f rom schools 
during economic downturns bo th to contribute to family income and to avoid education-related expenses. 
At present, one in eight children aged 5 to 17 i s employed, w i t h employment rates fo r children rising 
particularly sharply between ages 13 (34 percent) and 16 (58 percent). The labor force participation rate 
o f 16-year-olds in Ecuador i s significantly higher than in other Andean countries such as Bo l iv ia (39 
percent) or Colombia and Peru (around 30 percent). Moreover, there i s a high rate o f chronic 
malnutrition among children, affecting 44 percent o f children in the poorest quintile, and one-third o f 
Ecuadorian children are stunted in terms o f anthropomorphic (size/weight) measures. 
18. 
Zncreasingpoverty has led to worsening social conditions. Crime rates have r i s e n sharply in the 
major urban areas since 1995, as a resu l t o f rural-urban migration, lack o f employment, poverty, and 
inadequate enforcement. In addition, the prevalence o f h i g h rates o f alcoholism and domestic violence 
(again w i th inadequate enforcement or support fo r women) have been documented in various studies. 
Lack o f employment has led t o an estimated ha l f -m i l l ion Ecuadorians migrating abroad to No r th America 
and Europe since 1997, leaving 1 in 12 children w i th at least one parent abroad. Wh i le the out-migration 
has resulted in $1.5 b i l l i o n in annual remittances, (or $140 per person, the highest rate per capita in L a t i n 
America after E l Salvador and the Dominican Republic), the migration has also had a severe impact on 
the social fabric, particularly o f rural communities. 
19. 
To address chronic poverty and worsening social conditions, i t w i l l be essential to ensure greater 
equity and inclusion o f the poor in Ecuadorian society, because their voices have gone largely unheard in 
the determination o f economic policies (Section 1I.D and Annex D). The policy bias against the poor i s 
reflected in the disproportionate tax burden borne by lower-middle-income compared t o higher-income 
Ecuadorians, subsidies that disproportionately bene f i t the richer ha l f o f the population, the l ow level o f 
social expenditures compared t o other La t in American countries, and the l ow quality o f those social 
expenditures, whether in terms o f the efficiency o f public services, or the degree t o which they are 
targeted to the poor, or the degree to which they provide an anticyclical support to the poor (Sections 1II.C 
and N .C ) . 

C. Recent Economic Developments and Performance 

20. 
The Bank has prepared a comprehensive set o f Policy Notes covering economic growth and 
competitiveness issues, poverty, social sector and governance themes, as a proposal fo r economic and 
social recovery.’ These Policy Notes underpin the macroeconomic and sectoral analysis throughout this 
CAS, and key findings are highlighted in t h i s Section and in Section IV .C on the Bank Group’s program. 

~~ 

2. T h e Policy Notes were started in November and presented to the President and h i s Cabinet on January 11, 2003. They cover 
the macroeconomy and competitiveness, tax reform, trade reform, labor markets, and the c i v i l service, decentralization, 
govemance and anticorruption, jud ic ia l reform, hydrocarbons, f inanc ia l sector development, urban development, rural 
development, environmental protection, basic infrastructure (energy, telecommunications, transport, and water), education, 
health, social security, and social protection. The Notes w i l l be published in M a y 2003 and disseminated thereafter.

Ecuador’s macroeconomic conditions are stabilizing. 
Benefiting from a positive extemal 
environment characterized by high petroleum prices, low intemational interest rates, and significant flows o f 
family remittances, GDP grew 2.8 percent in 2000, 5.1 percent in 2001, and an estimated 3.0 percent in 2002. 
Average annual inflation f e l l to 38 percent in 2001, and reached single d i g i t s by late 2002 (Figure 2), while 
unemployment fe l l from 14.4 percent in 1999 to 8.5 percent by 2002. In many ways, the economy has 
performed much better than projected at the time o f the last CAS P rog ress Report in June 2000 (Table l), with 
some key exceptions, including inflation, export growth, and the debt servicdexports and reservedimports ratios.

22. 
The economic recovery since 1999 i s explained by the increase in domestic demand (particularly private 
demand), stimulated in turn by high pemleum prices, growing remittances, an (unsustainable) increase in public 
expenditures, and a gradual reactivation o f private credit, consistent with the continuing recovery o f the banking 
system Construction o f a new pipeline for heavy crude oils (OCP) was the main factor that attracted significant 
inflows o f foreign investment after 2001 (Annex Table B6). 
23. 
For its part, the in i t ia l inflationary impulse, followed by a gradual decline in inflation, f i ts into the pattem 
observed in most dollarized economies: in the medium term, the domestic inflation rate tends to be determined by 
intemational inflation, but in the short term, lags occur in relative price adjustment due to the control o f certain 

6 

managed prices belonging to the basic basket, and to the postcrisis reactivation o f domestic demand. Moreover, 
Ecuador began i t s dollarization with an undervalued real effective exchange rate, which had to appreciate 
somewhat. However, the continued increase in the price o f nontradables relative to tradable goods i s affecting 
Ecuador’s competitiveness. Thus significant efforts are required to boost productivity and competition in 
domestic markets so as to contain the rise in prices o f nontradables and maintain Ecuador’s competitive position.

Despite improvement, the recovery &j?a&le. The key sources o f vulnerability are the fragile fiscal 
position, Ecuador’s worsening competitiveness, and the lack o f flexibility in domestic markets to respond to 
shocks, which i s an even greater concem under dollarization. W h i l e national government revenues have 
increased significantly since 2000, revenues f rom o i l (which account for around 40 percent o f a l l revenues) 
have been volatile, and instead o f building up savings in good times, the Executive and the Legislature have 
allowed revenue increases to be outpaced by expansionary spending policies, thereby complicating medium- 
te rm fiscal sustainability. In particular, primary surpluses o f the Non-Financial Public Sector (N F P S ) , which 
are fairly high b y La t in American standards, have decreased f rom 7.7 percent o f GDP in 2000 to 4.5 percent 
o f GDP in 2002. Moreover, after covering interest on public debt, overall fiscal balances have been marginally 
positive to negative during the last two years. The primary surpluses could certainly have been maintained at 
higher levels, were i t not for the expansionary trend in current primary spending. The overall budget increased 
f rom $4.9 b i l l ion (23.3 percent o f GDP) in 2001 to $6.7 b i l l ion (an estimated 25 percent o f GDP) in 2003. 
Spending on public sector wages has doubled since 1999 to around $2 billion, rising 55 percent in just the last 
year, while public goods expenditures have increased by 80 percent to $900 m i l l ion over the same period. 
Finally, public expenditures have been extremely inflexible, w i th 95 percent o f the budget pre-assigned to debt 
service, public salaries or legally mandated expenditures, leaving only 5 percent to adjust more readily 
according to changing circumstances (Figure 3). 
25. 
Fo l low ing E l N i i i o and the strong capital outflows f rom La t in America in 1999, there was some 
improvement in Ecuador’s external position in 2000. This improvement followed the successful 
negotiation o f an IMF Stand-By Arrangement, w i th in an overall package o f $2 b i l l i o n f r om multilaterals, 
in March 2000; the repurchase o f $6.4 b i l l i o n in o ld Brady Bonds and Eurobonds at a 40 percent discount 
in August 2000; t h e rescheduling o f debt owed to the Paris Club in September that year, and a recovery in

o i l prices. As a result, “excess free ly disposable in tema t iona l reserves” wen t f r om nega t ive-US254

The productive sector is losing competitiveness. Abou t 80 percent o f the current account 
imbalance corresponds t o a rising de f ic i t in the trade balance. This i s in turn large ly explained b y

exports in the key banana and shrimp industries due t o marke t access prob lems in Europe and t o pest 
problems, respectively; loss o f competitiveness re la t ive t o ne ighbor ing countries Co lomb ia and Peru, the 
currencies o f w h i c h depreciated sharply against the dollar; g row th in impo r ts o f consumer goods as 
remittances increased and ove ra l l GDP recovered; and increased impo r ts o f intermediate and cap i ta l 
goods (in part f o r the OCP p ipe l ine) as Ecuador’s produc t ive sector began t o p l a n f o r longer- term g row th 
under do l lar iza t ion . The la t ter includes a ma jo r but temporary surge in impo r ts accompanying 
construction o f the OCP, w h i c h i s f u l l y f inanced b y fo re ign investment i n f l ow s in the cap i ta l account f o r 
about 3 percent o f the 2002 GDP. The sharp sw ing in the trade balance was o n the other hand 
accompanied b y a rap id dec l ine in ne t interest payments o n external debt (nearly US$500 m i l l ion ) and 
g row th in remittances, wh ich became the second-most-important source o f fo re ign currency, representing 
about 6.5 percent o f GDP in 2002. 
27. 
Ecuador has been unable to take fu l l advantage of 
recent high o i l prices due to 
underinvestment i n hydrocarbons. Ecuador has proven reserves o f close t o 5 b i l l i o n barrels, o r 30-years 
equivalent o f production, i s expanding i t s p ipe l ine capacity through the OCP, has a p o o l o f po ten t ia l 
p r iva te investors, and has qua l i f ied technicians in the industry. There are f ew industries in wh ich Ecuador

flattened o r declined, wh i le p roduc t ion b y Petroecuador has fa l len b y one-quarter over the past fou r years 
alone. Ecuador has n o t been able to take advantage o f the recent excep t iona l ly high o i l prices, has n o t 
managed the o i l revenues that i t has generated as e f f ic ien t ly as i t could, and, impor tan t ly , has fa l len short 
o f best practices in ensuring adequate preven t ion and management o f po ten t ia l env ironmen ta l and social 
impacts. The reasons are an inadequate legal, regulatory, and ins t i tu t iona l framework ; uncer ta in and 
inappropriate taxa t ion and p r i c i n g po l ic ies ; insu f f ic ien t transparency in o i l revenue co l lec t ion and 
management mechanisms; ins t i tu t iona l l im i ta t ions related t o env ironmen ta l and social protection; and 
inadequate attention o f key po l icymakers t o the sector in light o f other macroeconomic pr ior i t ies . In light

development, i t w i l l be important fo r the Government to develop and implement a strategy that addresses 
each o f these shortcomings. 
28. 
The financial sector has recovered significantly, but is still not deep or robust enough to be an 
engine for growth. One important reason that the economy was not able to respond to the sharp in i t ia l 
devaluation in the real effective exchange rate was the collapse o f the financial sector in 1999, which 
resulted in relatively limited access to credit in subsequent years. Bank deposits have now almost 
recovered t o precrisis levels, growing b y $2 b i l l i o n since 1999 (which i s fairly rapid fo r a post-crisis 
economy); however, the absence o f a credible lender o f last resort coupled w i th a run on deposits in July 
2001 has led banks to se l f- insure v ia h igh l iqu id i ty ratios, and to maintain excess reserves outside o f the 
country. In addition, the financial system’s lack o f access t o long-term funding and caution regarding 
t e rm transformation risk has inevitably limited long-term credit fo r the private sector. Moreover, banks 
have been prudently building loan-loss reserves and capital in the run-up to meeting Bade capital- 
adequacy standards by December 2003. Credit growth has therefore not kept up w i t h growth in deposits, 
w i t h banking sector loans at only 13 percent o f GDP as o f 2002. Moreover, while deposit interest rates at 
around 5 percent are negative in real terms, the domestic on-lending rates faced by Ecuadorian producers 
and traders are h igh compared to those o f foreign competitors, as they range f rom 12 t o 18 percent 
(relative t o a 9 percent domestic in f la t ion rate and a 2 percent international inflation rate in dollars). 
Banks have also tended toward financing consumer credit as producers have become less competitive, 
and have yet to expand significantly in to lending to micro-and small-scale enterprises or in to providing 
investment capital for manufacturing and agriculture or medium-term mortgage financing. 
29. 
The labor market is still insufficiently flexible to absorb external shocks through price rather 
than real adjustments. The Economic Transformation L aw o f August 2000 permitted the hiring o f 
workers on a per-hour basis fo r the f i r s t time, thereby alleviating some o f the rigidities o f the labor 
market. However, these measures have been insufficient to ensure that adjustments in response to 
external shocks occur through prices rather than through production and employment. Critical challenges 
remain in reducing the costs o f hiring workers (including a 15 percent profit-sharing law) and releasing 
workers (including h igh severance entitlements, especially in the public sector). Moreover, the law s t i l l 
mandates an annual increase in wages, which i f not agreed between workers and employers, i s required 
by law t o be equal to the rate o f inflation. 
30. 
Overall, Ecuador i s at an important stage in the dollarization process in which further fiscal 
consolidation i s essential, together w i th improvement o f the legal and institutional framework t o promote 
competitiveness and growth, enhanced banking supervision and financial sector strengthening, and more 
flexible input markets, especially fo r labor, in order to be in a be t ter position to absorb external shocks 
under a rigid monetary and exchange rate regime through prices rather than real domestic adjustments. 

D. Perspectives of Civil Society 

3 1. 

The Bank has maintained a continuous dialogue with Ecuadorian civil society in recent years. 
Ecuador i s one o f six countries participating in the Structural Adjustment Participatory Review In i t ia t ive 
(SAPRI), wh ich has provided an important fo rum fo r a tripartite c i v i l society-government-World Bank 
review o f adjustment policies on poverty reduction since 1996 (Annex D). In addition, w i t h assistance 
f r om an Ecuadorian nongovernmental organization (NGO), the Center fo r Planning and Social Studies 
(CEPLAES), the Bank undertook and disseminated the resu l ts o f a national study o f “Voices o f the Poor” 
(Box 1). Finally, fo r the purposes o f the CAS, the Bank has participated in the National Dialogue process 
(Section 111, B o x 2), and undertook a two-week consultation in nine different cities across the country in 
early 2003 t o elicit views on the country situation and national priorities, and recommended areas fo r 
Bank support (Annex E). 
32. 
These major avenues fo r listening t o c i v i l society are complemented by a continuous dialogue 
between the Bank‘s Resident Mission in Ecuador and a wide range of c i v i l society representatives on bo th 

9 

broader socioeconomic issues and specific Bank assistance to Ecuador. This dialogue has been facilitated 
by c i v i l society staff and by gender and indigenous consultants located in the Resident Mission in Quito, 
who have also taken the lead on a number o f important nonlending activities w i t h c i v i l society. For 
example, the Bank has promoted social accountability through nonlending support to develop guidelines 
on consultations fo r mining and hydrocarbons investments and community oversight o f m in ing activities. 
With support f rom the Japanese government, the Bank has built greater gender consciousness in to i t s 
portfolio o f investment projects, particularly Prodepine, which i s designed t o support rural indigenous and 
Afro-Ecuadorian communities. In addition, w i t h support f r om the Norwegian government, the Bank has 
hired an indigenous consultant in the Resident Mission to work on gender and intercultural issues, 
including analysis o f indigenous social capital, particularly as i t relates t o indigenous women’ s productive 
activities. Moreover, to improve outreach to important but frequently marginalized segments o f the 
population, the Bank and the key indigenous and Afro-Ecuadorian organizations in Ecuador established 
an Indigenous and Afro-Ecuadorian People’s Advisory Council fo r the Bank in 2001. The Council 
reviews the Bank‘s portfolio in Ecuador as part o f the Country Portfolio Performance Review (CPPR) 
process, and provides upstream advice on the design o f new  operation^,^ and i t s members participated in 
the CAS consultations. 

Box 1. “Voices o f the Poor” Id en t i f y P r o b l e m and Solutions for Pove r ty 

“In order to be free o f poverty, I imagine there must be a l i t t l e o f everything, electricity, water, land, animals, 
livestock.. .the needs o f the home.. .” -Consultations w i th the Poor, Ecuador, July 1999. 
Ecuador participated together w i t h 22 other countries in a global consultation e f fo r t to hear the voices o f the poor, as 
an input in to the World Development Report 2000/01. M o r e than 500 men and women, o f different ages and ethnic 
origins, l i v i n g in urban and ru ra l areas o f h a l f o f Ecuador’s 22 provinces, were interviewed in a process l e d b y the 
Center for Planning and Social Studies (CEPLAES), an Ecuadorian NGO. Topics ranged f r om the de f in i t ion o f 
well-being to problems and priorities, “spaces o f poverty” related to access to basic services, gender relations, 
institutionality, and challenges fo r an agenda for change. K e y findings o f the voices o f the poor echo those o f the 
SAPRI process and o f the Bank’s CAS consultations: 
Poverty affects not on ly material well-being but also psychological well-being, and i s reflected in the 
constrained capacity to decide and act, and in feelings o f depression and loss o f hope. 
Employment and self-improvement are very important; the poor want opportunities in the f o rm o f stable 
employment in urban areas and access to credit and training in ru ra l areas, rather than handouts. 
The ru ra l poor feel isolated, wh i le the urban poor feel trapped, subject to insecure l i v i n g conditions w i t h high 
rates o f contamination, unemployment, and crime. 
Gender roles have been transformed due to unemployment and migration o f men, and due to women j o i n i n g the 
labor force; women are more empowered wh i le men’s self-esteem has plummeted; w i t h support f r om women’s 
NGOs, people are more conscious o f domestic violence and o f gender disparities. 
The poor feel alienated no t on ly f r om traditional politicians, but also distanced f r om mun ic ipa l governments and 
NGOs w i th their own agendas; thus they re ly ma in ly on their ow n organizations. 
An agenda fo r re form must include overcoming isolation, prov is ion o f basic infrastructure, guaranteeing access 
to health and education, and creating capacities and opportunities. 
In 2001, Bank staff jo ined CEPLAES in a process o f dissemination o f the “Voices o f the Poor” survey results to 
communities that had been consulted. The fo l low-up round was appreciated b y the communities as evidence o f a 
genuine exchange o f ideas, and served to recon f irm the findings o f the or ig ina l surveys. 

33. 
The SAPRI process has permitted a series of diulogues since 1996. As an input to the SAPR I 
dialogue, two national universities prepared economic studies on structural adjustment, which clearly 
documented increases in poverty during the past two decades, together w i t h the presence o f a series o f 
IMF- and Bank-supported adjustment programs. This has led to two opposing views arising on the issue 
o f structural adjustment in the dialogue. The f i r s t view i s that over the past 20 years there has been a 

3. The valuable inputs provided through t h i s process are reflected in Section V . 

10 

continuous process o f orthodox, neo l ibera l economic measures across a range o f sectors, wh ich a l though 
n o t deep, have been su f f ic ien t t o deal a ma jo r economic b l o w to and fur ther impove r ish the weakest 
sectors o f society, pa r t icu la r ly through p r ice adjustments that have e l im ina ted subsidies and fue l led 
broader in f la t ion . The second v iew i s that wh i le there have been a series o f structural r e f o rm programs 
over the past 20 years, in prac t ice the r e f o rm measures taken b y the Government p r i o r t o do l lar iza t ion 
have been l im i t e d at best, and have fa i led t o resolve glaring ine f f ic ienc ies in pub l ic enterprises, pub l ic 
service prov is ion , and in the management o f f isca l and mone tary po l ic ies . The lack o f deep structural 
reforms, under this view-which 
i s shared b y Bank Management-has 
resulted in the need f o r a series o f 
stabilization measures that have added t o adverse economic cond i t ions f o r the poor. 
34. 
What is clear under either view i s that very limited application of structural reforms as 
conducted in the past has not yielded the hoped-for results. On the other hand, there i s a strong demand 
among c i v i l society fo r a range o f re forms in the way the Ecuador ian economy operates. This i s 
con f irmed b o t h in the S A PR I process and in the CAS consultations. In particular, b o t h processes have 
h igh l igh ted the increasing pove r ty and inequa l i ty ; rising unemp loymen t and m igra t ion ; high prices; 
deteriorating competitiveness; an a larm ing lack o f ins t i tu t iona l capacity in pub l ic institutions; l im i t e d 
coverage and poo r qua l i ty o f pub l ic services rang ing f r o m hea l th and education t o water, electricity, and 
telecommunications; l im i t e d and nontransparent attempts at p r iva t iza t ion in l i e u o f genuine solutions t o 
improve the operations o f pub l ic enterprises; increasing env ironmen ta l degradation; rising cr ime rates; 
corruption; lack o f genuine pa r t ic ipa t ion in po l i t ica l processes; and the gradual loss o f soc ia l cap i ta l and 
social values. 
35. 
The Ecuadorian civil society has proposed several measures to remedy these problems. These 
inc lude measures t o p r io r i t ize re forms that increase access t o and the qua l i ty o f education and health; 
p rov ide incentives t o boost p roduc t ion and p roduc t iv i ty by r u r a l producers and microenterprises; imp rove 
access t o cred i t and techn ica l training; strengthen par t ic ipa tory p lann ing processes t o develop a long - te rm 
v is ion f o r the country; fight co r rup t ion b y increasing transparency and accoun tab i l i ty in the pub l ic sector 
t o c i v i l society; reduce bureaucracy and promo te decentralization t o ensure that more resources reach the 
commun i ty level; recognize and promo te mu l t icu l tu ra l values and human values; and pro tec t the 
environment through greater loca l par t ic ipa t ion . These recommendations have been shared w i t h the 
Government and have been taken i n t o account in the des ign o f the lend ing and Ana ly t ica l and Adv iso ry 
Ac t iv i t ies (AAA) p rog ram developed in this CAS . 

111. ECUADOR’S STRATEGY AND PROSPECTS FOR GROWTH AND POVERTY REDUCT ION 

A. T h e Government ’s O v e r a l l Deve lopmen t Ob ject ives 

36. 
The new Administration that came to offie 
in January 2003 inherited a severe liquidity 
problem that called for immediate corrective measures. In particular, the sharp increase in the pub l ic 
sector wage b i l l and in unbudgeted transfers to loca l government during the f i r s t h a l f o f the 2002 e lec t ion 
year (before the passage o f the F isca l Respons ib i l i ty Ac t ) were approved w i thou t iden t i fy ing sources o f 
f inanc ing fo r these l iab i l i t ies . Consequently, the prev ious Adm in is t ra t ion accumulated arrears o f an 
estimated $700 m i l l ion , o r around 3 percent o f GDP, inc lud ing arrears o n Paris Club debt and o n pub l ic 
employee salaries. 
37. 
The Government immediately adopted a two-pronged approach involving stabilization 
measures and longer-term reforms. First, the President signed an austerity decree that increased state 
revenues b y ra is ing o i l pr ices and con ta in ing expenditures o n pub l ic sector wages. Second, the 
Government announced a f ive-po in t , med ium- term development strategy t o fight corruption; p romo te 
economic g row th through competitiveness; reduce pover ty and exclusion; adopt a proac t ive and sovereign 
international po l icy ; and b road ly strengthen security, in terms o f fighting crime, imp rov ing food security 
and environmental security, and ensuring the pred ic tab i l i ty o f j u d i c i a l proceedings (or “ jud ic ia l security”). 
This longer- term p rog ram was in fo rmed b y the Na t iona l D ia logue process (Box 2). The Government’s 

11 

economic program has also received support f rom the IM J ? s Board o f Directors, which approved a $205 
million-equivalent Stand-By Arrangement on Ma rch 21,2003. 

I Box 2. The New Government Has Launched a Nat iona l Dialogue Process 

The National Dialogue was launched around f i v e key topics: corruption, economic growth, poverty and exclusion, 
international policy, and security. The process brings together a broad range o f government, private sector, and c i v i l 
society actors who would normally not have the inc l ina t ion or opportunity to communicate w i th each other. I t began 
w i th work ing groups o f c i v i l society representatives in November 2002, who debated a range o f political, economic, 
and social issues, and concluded i t s first phase o f activities in a National Dialogue in Quito in January 2003. A 
second Dialogue was held in Guayaquil in Ma rch and plans are under way for further conventions in different cities. 
The process builds o n similar initiatives at the loca l government level, and has resulted in considerable demand that 
the President keep the process open and make i t increasingly inclusive and increasingly binding o n the national 
government. The Dialogue process clearly serves as a vehicle fo r bu i ld ing consensus for reforms, iden t i fy ing areas 
o f disagreement, and for beginning to establish mechanisms fo r mon i tor ing the implementation o f agreed policies 
and actions. The new Administration's appointment o f a Secretary o f Planning and Dialogue w i th in the Presidency 
to institutionalize the dialogue process evinces a serious government commitment to the process. 

I 

38. 
The overall objective of 
the Government's medium-term program is to bring Ecuadorian 
citizens together to launch a concerted f igh t against poverty, through coordinated advances on 
economic and social fronts. The Government has announced an ambitious set o f specific monitoring 
indicators to evaluate i t s program. In particular, during 2003-07, the Government's main stretch target i s 
to reduce consumption poverty f rom 5 1 percent to 38 percent through sustained, high economic growth. 
A summary o f the key goals i s presented in Table 2. In September 2000, Ecuador joined other U.N. 
members in the pursuit o f Millennium Development Goals; however, i t i s l ike ly to face tremendous 
challenges in achieving them all.

4 1. 

39. 
The Government’s policies to promote economic growth are anchored around fiscal 
consolidation, accompanied by a series of sectoral reforms. These re forms are designed t o re l ieve 
microconstraints t o g row th in p roduc t ion and commerce, infrastructure, labor markets, and f inanc ia l 
sector development. 
40. 
The f irst priority for growth is fiscal consolid&’on. Unde r do l lar iza t ion , the Government can n o 
longer ac t ive ly app ly monetary and exchange rate policies, and a sound f isca l p o l i c y becomes even more 
essential. T o t h i s end i t i s under tak ing a short-term s tab i l iza t ion p rog ram i n v o l v i n g austerity measures, 
accompanied b y longer- term measures t o strengthen pub l ic finances. The austerity package approved in 
January 2003 includes a 20-percent reduc t ion in the salary o f the President and o f senior pub l ic sector 
o f f ic ia ls earning more than $1,000 pe r month; a freez ing o f a l l pub l ic sector salary increases in 2003; 
filling on ly 9 0 percent o f government vacancies and ensuring a gradual downs iz ing o f the pub l ic sector; 
increasing f u e l prices; and the sale o f unused pub l ic assets. 
The longer- term measures invo lve re fo rm ing the Ecuadorian Customs Corporation, p romo t ing tax 
reforms, u n i f y i n g pub l ic salaries, strengthening the Government’s SIGEF, and ensuring e f fec t ive 
func t ion ing o f the f isca l s tab i l iza t ion fund. The Government’s leg is la t ive agenda o f urgent economic 
leg is la t ion began w i t h the submission o f a d ra f t l a w in February t o Congress t o r e f o rm the Ecuadorian 
Customs Corporation, where i t i s estimated that the equivalent o f a f ew percentage po in ts o f GDP are los t 
t o fraud, corruption, ine f f ic iency and l a c k o f coord ina t ion w i t h the In te rna l Revenue Service (SRI). 
The austerity package, together w i th longer- term measures in customs and tax reform, c i v i l 
service re form , reso lu t ion o f fa i led banks, and re forms in pub l ic enterprises, pe rm i t ted the signing o f a 13- 
mon th Stand-By Arrangement fo r $205 m i l l i o n w i t h the IMF. K e y macroeconomic assumptions under 
the Arrangement are economic g row th o f 3.5 t o 4 percent in 2003, annual i n f l a t i o n o f 6 to 8 percent b y 
December 2003, and a p r ima ry budget surplus target o f 5.2 percent, w i t h agreement o n key o i l revenue 
assumptions fo r the budget o f o i l exports o f 105 m i l l i o n barrels at an average p r ice o f $18 per barrel. 
43. 
The Government’s priorities i n production, commerce, and infrastructure are increased 
competitiveness and efficiency. With regard t o production, especially in r u r a l and microenterprise 
production, the Government intends t o strengthen access t o credit, education, and capacity building t o 
increase p roduc t iv i ty . These measures are par t o f an ove ra l l Na t iona l Competitiveness Agenda that also 
calls f o r aggressive p romo t ion o f non trad i t iona l non -o i l exports, increasing measures against smuggling 
o f contraband, s tream l in ing bureaucratic requirements fo r producers and exporters, and imp rov ing 
Ecuador’s basic supporting 
infrastructure, pa r t icu la r ly in e lec tr ic i ty generation and d is tr ibu t ion , 
telecommunications, roads and highways, por ts and airports, and water and sanitation, generally through 
pr iva te par t ic ipa t ion in the f o rm o f management contracts, concessions, o r in some cases ( fo r example, 
e lec tr ic i ty generation and telephony), d irec t investment and ownership. In addition, Ecuador i s seeking 
pr iva te investment in hydrocarbons and mining. 
The Government intends to complement these reforms with measures to promote a more 
flexible and dynamic labor market. The Government i s deve lop ing a p rog ram for comprehensive r e f o rm 
o f labor markets, inc lud ing salary un i f ica t ion and salary adjustment mechanisms, labo r hiring and f ~ n g 
processes, social security re form , and human cap i ta l development. As part o f i t s tax r e f o rm leg is la t ion fo r 
this year, the Government w i l l also propose the e l im ina t ion o f the 15 percent p ro f i t -sha r ing requirement 
in pub l ic enterprises owned exc lus ive ly by the State. T o build consensus o n broader labor market 
reforms, the M i n i s t r y o f Labo r has launched a stakeholder dialogue o n issues inc lud ing pro f i t-shar ing 
rules, co l lec t ive bargaining, labor p roduc t iv i ty and competitiveness, enforcement o f labo r laws, and the 
widespread use o f outsourcing v ia temp agencies t o avo id labor code requirements. The Government 
aims t o build consensus on r e f o rm proposals t o be inc luded in a new Labo r Code, t o be presented t o 
Congress nex t year.

W ith in the f inanc ia l sector, Government intends to strengthen the banking system, improve 
access to credit, and resolve banking problems related to the recent crisis. 
The Government i s 
concerned about l im i t e d outreach and high interest rates in the bank ing system. I t has adopted a strategy 
designed in the f i r s t instance to strengthen the banking system, v i a measures t o bolster bank ing 
supervision, raise bank ing standards t o in terna t iona l levels, and strengthen the interbank payments 
system, c lear ing and settlement mechanisms, l iqu id i ty mechanisms, and deposit insurance. In addition, i t 
intends t o e l im ina te the poo r ly pe r fo rm ing Depos i t Guarantee Agency (AGD), l iqu ida te the banks under 
i t s purv iew , and bring in in terna t iona l expertise t o ensure transparent asset management and d ispos i t ion 
and pay o f f rema in ing depositor claims f r o m closed banks. I t also intends t o reengineer pub l ic banks, the 
adm in is tra t ion o f wh ich has been disappointing, in order t o refocus the i r e f for ts towa rd s m a l l farmers, 
artisans, and microenterprises (especially in the case o f the Na t iona l Finance Corpora t ion and the 
Na t iona l Deve lopmen t Bank). F ina l ly , i t intends t o amend and imp lemen t the Soc ia l Security L a w to 
strengthen the pension system and to elaborate po l ic ies f o r deve lop ing Ecuador’s nascent cap i ta l markets. 

C. Reduc ing Pove r ty and P romo t ing Soc ia l Inc lus ion 

46. 
The Government’s target i s t o reduce pover ty f r o m 5 1 percent t o 38 percent and extreme pover ty 
f r om 25 percent t o 10 percent b y 2007. These large reductions in pove r ty are t o be achieved n o t on ly b y 
p romo t ing economic growth, but also v i a re forms t o address inequa l i ty and imp rove access to social 
assistance, education, health, and social security, and t o promo te soc ia l inc lus ion b y ensuring that social 
expenditures reach the poo r t o a greater extent and b y ensuring broader pa r t ic ipa t ion in po l icy fo rmu la t ion 
through the na t iona l dialogue. 
47. 
K e y aspects o f the r e f o rm p rog ram in social assistance w i l l inc lude imp rov ing the coverage and 
targeting o f the p r inc ipa l soc ia l assistance program, the bono solidurio, and increasing the mon th ly 
amount f r o m $11.50 t o $15 pe r poor female head o f household. T o this end, the Govemmen t i s curren t ly 
strengthening i t s Bene f ic iary Targe t ing Database (Se lecc ih de Beneficiaries, SELBEN ) and pover ty 
mapping. The Government also intends t o imp rove the targe t ing o f subsidies in such areas as electricity, 
gas, and telecommunications t o favo r the poorest and mos t vulnerable. Moreover , the M i n i s t r y o f 
Finance w i l l be incorpora ted i n t o the “Soc ia l Fron t” that curren t ly comprises the M in is t r ies o f Soc ia l 
Welfare, Education, Health, Labor , and Hous ing and U r b a n Development, t o ensure better coord ina t ion 
w i t h and f inanc ing o f soc ia l sector pr ior i t ies .

In the area o f education, the Government i s deve lop ing an in tegra ted v is ion f o r re fo rm ing the

50. 
The Government was elected w i t h a mandate to f igh t corruption and increase the transparency o f 
public services. I t proposes to extend the SIGEF and i t s web-based disclosure system, Sistema de Gestidn 
pa ra l a Gobemabizidad (SIGOB), and to implement a web-based public contracting system. I t has also 
proposed reforms to increase the coordination among key oversight agencies, including the Offices o f the 
Government Auditor, Attorney General, and Prosecutor, and the Anti-Corruption Commission. Indicators 
o f service quality and productivity w i l l be introduced throughout institutions that manage public funds. 
Moreover, the Government intends t o promote greater accountability and participation through the 
National Dialogue process. And in the area o f jud ic ia l security, i t w i l l develop proposals together w i th 
the jud ic ia l system and c i v i l society w i t h a view to strengthening contract enforcement and overall 
jud ic ia l security. Finally, w i th respect t o environmental security, Governmentthe government intends to 
strengthen financing and management o f the National System o f Protected Areas, which w i l l receive legal 
support through a Biodiversity L aw that i s currently being considered b y Congress. Ecuador i s also 
exploring ways t o improve environmental management and to address climate change r i s k by availing 
i tse l f o f carbon-rights funding in accordance w i th the Kyo to Protocol. 

E. Prospects and Challenges for G r o w t h and Poverty Reduct ion 

5 1. 

Ecuador needs to generate employment to reduce poverty. Du r ing the consultations processes, 
c i v i l society representatives clearly indicated that Ecuador’s poor do no t want t o depend on handouts, 
such as the bono solidario, but rather want meaningful opportunities fo r employment. This i s consistent 
w i t h the fact that the most important asset, and therefore source o f income, o f poorer households i s their 
human capital. Ecuador’s population i s growing at 1.9 percent per year, and because i t i s a young 
population that has not yet gone through the demographic transition, the economically active population 
i s growing at around 3 percent per year. Therefore, even more rapid growth in GDP i s required just t o 
absorb new entrants 
in to the 
labor 
force, and 
thereby avoid 
increases 
in unemployment, 
underemployment, or migration. Given these demographics, the Bank‘s analysis suggests that a 4 percent 
economic growth rate would reduce consumption poverty by 1 percentage point per year. In addition, 
during the 199Os, 80 percent o f the change in poverty in Ecuador was driven by changes in growth rather 
than distribution, however efforts t o improve equality could conservatively add a further 0.25 percentage 
points per year, making a 5 percentage po in t reduction in consumption poverty an achievable target 
during the CAS period. The Government’s poverty target i s therefore clearly ambitious and w i l l depend 
on high economic growth rates (we l l above historical trends over the past two decades). T o achieve t h i s 
and generate sufficient remunerative employment, the Government’s program focuses on creating a 
favorable environment fo r investment b y (a) ensuring a stable macroeconomic environment anchored on a 
prudent fiscal framework and consolidated fiscal accounts, while simultaneously taking measures t o boost 
competitiveness; and (b) developing human capital. The Government w i l l also need t o prevent the 
deterioration o f l iv ing conditions during a d i f f icu l t adjustment period and take decisive measures to 
reverse the long-term trend toward greater inequality t o ensure success in the fight against poverty. 
Dollarization has contributed to economic stabilization but also to heightened risks. As a result 
o f dollarization, inflation in tradables prices has declined towards international levels fo r the f i r s t time in 
several years. However, nontradables prices have continued to r i s e more rapidly than in international 
markets. This i s a major concern, since adverse external shocks-such as a sharp f a l l in o i l and other 
commodity prices, real depreciation by non-US trade partners, or a significant decline in remittances or 
other capital inflows-would be especially destabilizing in a dollarized economy l i k e Ecuador, as they

wou ld en ta i l the need f o r an adjustment in the rea l e f fec t ive exchange ra te that cou ld happen on ly through 
de f la t ion o f domestic prices in nontradables, wh ich cou ld in turn resu l t in a pro trac ted recession and debt 
servicing problems f o r the pub l ic and nontradables sectors, w i t h po ten t ia l consequences f o r the f inanc ia l 
sector. These r i s k s en ta i l the need f o r m u c h stricter f isca l po l icy in Ecuador than wou ld be requ ired in 
non-do l lar ized but otherwise s i m i l a r economies; the design and r igo rous app l ica t ion o f mechanisms- 
such as the o i l s tab i l iza t ion fund-that 
promo te savings in good t imes so as t o be able t o apply 
coun tercyc l ica l f isca l po l ic ies in adverse times; as w e l l as h igher liquid reserves f o r banks, and pruden t ia l 
regu la t ion that takes i n t o account the r i s k s o f s ign i f ican t lend ing t o the nontradables sector. 
53. 
Ecuador’s prospects of achieving sustained economic growth in the medium term depend on 
the successful implementation of the economic program and on sustained dollurization. In a base case 
scenario, there wou ld be n o ma jo r exogenous shocks t o the currency reg ime and n o catastrophic na tura l 
disasters, and the Government w o u l d (a) take e f fec t ive steps t o s low d ow n expansionary spending and 
increase non -o i l tax revenues, t o ob ta in sizable p r ima ry surpluses, repay i t s debt, and lowe r domestic 
in f la t ion ; (b) induce a reduc t ion in interest rates t o s low ly imp rove ex terna l competitiveness t o foster 
private-foreign 
and domestic-investment 
and exports as the m a i n sources o f economic growth; (c) 
conclude the construction o f the new o i l p ipe l ine by end-2003, so i t can gradua l ly increase o i l exports 
f r o m 2004; (d) generate ma rg ina l g row th in o i l p roduc t ion in 2003-barely 2 m i l l i o n barrels ( lowe r than 
the o f f i c i a l forecast o f 10 m i l l i o n barrels)-as 
a result o f the l o w investment b y state-run 
PetroProducci6n; (e) proceed w i t h a s low but steady res truc tur ing o f the bank ing system; (f) clear a l l i t s 
arrears in 2003 and prevent any fur ther de fau l t over the nex t three years; and (g) p rov ide full f inanc ing o f 
the social expenditure t o bring adequate pro tec t ion t o the poorest, wh i le m i n im i z i n g the po ten t ia l ly 
negative short-term impac t o f adjustment measures, thus ach iev ing minimum soc ia l and po l i t ica l 
consensus over the d i f f i c u l t measures t o be adopted. 
54. 
M o r e specifically, the base case scenario assumes moderate g row th w i t h l o w in f la t ion (see Tab le 
3). During 2003-05, specific assumptions are (a) g row th averaging 4 percent, w i t h s ing le-d ig i t i n f l a t i o n 
rates s low ly converg ing t o in terna t iona l levels; (b) a s low recovery o f the U.S. economy after the second 
semester o f 2003; and (c) a short-lived, pr ice-dr iven b o om in o i l revenues in 2003, w i t h a la ter dec l ine in 
o i l prices at least pa r t ly o f fse t until 2005 b y increases in o i l exports through the new OCP p ipe l ine as the 
Government strengthens the regu la tory and tax f ramewo rk t o encourage p r iva te investment. As a result, 
the p r ima ry s u r p l u s o f the NFPS shou ld average 5 percent o f GDP, f o r an N F P S ove ra l l balance s u r p l u s 
o f 1 t o 2 percent o f GDP after serv ic ing interest o n pub l ic debt. This s u r p l u s w o u l d be attained v i a the 
approva l o f several tax measures in 2003, temporar i ly h igher o i l revenues, and dec l in ing pub l ic 
expenditures in rea l terms. The base case scenario also envisions comp l iance w i t h a l l f isca l rules 
contained in the F isca l Transparency, S tab i l iza t ion and Respons ib i l i ty L a w (LOREFIT), approved in June 
2002 (Box 3). The pe r iod ends w i t h a gradual dec l ine o f the pub l ic deb t- to-GDP r a t i o t o the minimum 
sustainable ra t io o f 40 percent o f GDP in 2005, the benchmark set up in the f isca l rule, as a resu l t o f the 
active repayment o f expensive domestic debt w i t h the p r ima ry surpluses. Such ra t io shou ld continue 
dec l in ing over subsequent years. 
On the external balances, the curren t account de f ic i t wou ld dec l ine t o about 2 t o 3 percent o f GDP 
in the base case scenario, as substantial impo r ts re la ted t o the cons truc t ion o f the OCP disappear in 2004 
and o i l exports beg in t o increase. Moreover , i t i s expected that g row th in remittances f r o m Ecuadorians 
wo rk ing abroad may lose dynam ism but rema in pos i t ive . O n the other hand, fo re ign d irec t investment 
(FDI) i s projected t o rema in even o r dec l ine slightly a f ter comp le t ion o f the OCP p ipe l ine . F ina l ly , i t i s 
expected that the economic p rog ram w i l l lead to lowe r domestic i n f l a t i o n and a gradua l increase in to ta l 
fac tor p roduc t iv i ty as investment grows, and that the Ame r ican Free Trade A rea w i l l n o t have a no tab le

Box 3. Ecuador’s Congress Approved a Fiscal Responsibility Law in 2002 

0 

The Organic L aw for F isca l Responsibility, Stabilization and Transparency (Law 2002-72-Registro Oficial No 589, 
June 4 2002), was approved in June 2002 and regulated in February 2003 (Presidential Decree 96-Registro O fc ia l , 
February 10,2003), w i t h a v iew to addressing persistent f isca l problems. Four key areas were targeted in particular: 
0 Planning and budgeting processes: this involves un i f ied and multiannual budgeting and fiscal goals. 
Macrofiscal rules: in particular, real primary expenditure increases shall not exceed 3.5 percent per year, and the 
debt-to-GDP ra t io shall be reduced b y 20 percent over f i v e years, and municipalities shall not run deficits, or 
exceed a 40 percent ra t io o f debt to current savings. 
Stabilization o f expenditures: via a Fund for Stabilization, Social and Productive Investment and Pub l ic Deb t 
Reduction (FEIREP), to be used fo r anticyclical expenditures (20 percent) and for re t ir ing debt (70 percent) 
w i t h incremental o i l revenues f r om the OCP and unusually h igh o i l revenues f r om a l l sources, a po r t ion o f 
which (10 percent) i s also to support basic social expenditures. 
Transparency and accountability: v ia mandatory pub l ica t ion o f regular fiscal reports, pub l ic access to a l l f isca l 
information, and integrated pub l ic financial management. 
These norms should bring a medium-term strategic approach in to budgeting; increase predictability about the future 
behavior o f some c r i t ica l fiscal variables; design a long-due comprehensive debt management strategy that 
guarantees external solvency in the medium term; make sure that o i l revenues saved in the o i l fund are effectively 
used for debt reduction, to b r ing down the country risk spread and facilitate investment in the non-o i l economy; and 
comply w i th , the government’s ma in goal o f eradicating corruption b y increased disclosure and c i v i l society 
empowerment in social auditing o f fiscal accounts.

There are important external and internal r i s k s associated with the base case projections. 

Ecuador remains vulnerable t o in tema l and external shocks that, shou ld they materialize, cou ld de ra i l the 
economic program. First, the economy i s vulnerable t o terms-of-trade shocks, especially o n i t s t w o 
lead ing exports, o i l and bananas. Second, remittance flows might f a l l faster i f m ig ra t ion po l ic ies in labo r - 
rec ip ien t countries l i k e I ta ly , Spain, and the Un i ted States t igh ten s ign i f ican t ly . Third, g loba l economic 
recovery cou ld take longe r than projected, o r a s ign i f ican t r ise in de f ic i t spending in the U n i t e d States

could put upward pressure on interest rates. Fourth, neighboring countries could devalue their currencies 
significantly, placing pressure on Ecuador’s producers in the short term . Fifth, Ecuador i s vulnerable to 
natural disasters, such as the El N i i io phenomenon, and to earthquakes or volcanic eruptions that could 
damage the country’s production and infrastructure, including o i l pipelines. 
Turning t o intemal r i s k s , the projected increase in the volume o f o i l production and exports might 
not materialize due to inefficiencies or underinvestment b y Petroecuador and continued tax-related or 
regulatory impediments to private investment in hydrocarbons. Second, the fiscal and structural re fo rm 
program assumed in the base case could be delayed o r derailed by political resistance, which would in 
turn put the IMF Stand-By Arrangement and other multilateral assistance at risk. Finally, if entrepreneurs 
f a i l to boost productivity or to reduce p ro f i t margin expectations toward international norms, they may 
consider foreign competition unbearable under dollarization and place po l i t ica l pressure on the 
Government to increase effective rates o f protection, cut taxes, or in the end even de-dollarize. On the 
other hand, the overwhelming majority o f Ecuadorians surveyed indicate they would not w i l l ing ly give up 
their U.S. dollars fo r a new domestic currency, and there i s broad awareness that the structural reforms 
needed in the economy to ensure growth are essential even i f the country were to consider de-dollarizing, 
and that de-dollarization i s not an option that wou ld provide re l ie f to the poor. The experience o f the past 
two decades has shown that fiscal and monetary indiscipline w i th the sucre resulted in increased poverty. 
The Government has therefore f i rm ly ruled out the possibility o f de-dollarization. 
The presence of an Administration f i rm ly committed to poverty reduction also offers a 
plausible high case scenario. Under t h i s scenario, the close participation o f indigenous, labor, and social 
movements in the administration offers a unique opportunity t o build bridges between the Government 
and the broader population, including a greater understanding o f the need fo r structural reforms t o ensure 
long-term growth and well-being, and a better appreciation o f the measures taken to mitigate the impact 
o f the re fo rm process on the poor. Similarly, the greater opening to participatory planning processes and 
c i v i l society oversight o f the public sector may substantially increase transparency and reduce corruption. 
Third, t h e Government may take more decisive steps t o reduce inequality through i t s tax and expenditure 
policies. Under this scenario, policy reforms have broader support, (or meet w i th less resistance), and are 
implemented more quickly, placing the economy more quickly on a sustainable growth track. 
On the other hand, continued political risk could place Ecuador in a low case scenario. The 
principal sources o f risk are a possible reluctance on the part o f all members o f the ruling coalition to 
support reforms that may be perceived as externally imposed structural adjustments. The reforms, such as 
improving the efficiency o f public services, f lex ib i l iz ing domestic labor markets, improving the targeting 
o f subsidies toward the poor, strengthening tax collections, and eliminating trade protections that favor a 
limited few, i f undertaken, are expected t o benefit a large share o f the population but hurt entrenched 
interests that could put up significant resistance either in Congress or in public demonstrations. T o t h i s 
social inclusion dimension must be added the long-standing regional dimension. I f po l i t ica l w i l l to carry 
through reforms falters, Ecuador i s l ike ly t o continue t o face fiscal problems, concentration o f resources, 
poverty-enhancing inequality and po l i t ica l gridlock, which have a l l held up progress fo r the past 20 years. 
60. 
Ecuador i s at a turning point. I t s prospects fo r stability and economic recovery are promising, i f 
the economic re fo rm program i s implemented. However, i t s fiscal and external positions remain 
vulnerable due to rigidities in the economy in response to potential shocks. The economy remains h igh ly 
dependent on volatile o i l and commodity export revenues, s t i l l maintains a heavy debt burden, and has yet 
to ensure that efforts to contain public expenditures and make them more flexible have become f i rm ly 
rooted. In addition, Ecuadorians s t i l l need to improve the investment climate and encourage more FDI, 
strengthen the financial system, and create more f lex ib le labor markets t o better absorb shocks, reduce 
volatility, and ensure sustained growth. These reforms w i l l require substantial commitment f rom 
Ecuador’s population, together w i th international support.

IV . Tm BANK GROUP’S COUNTRY ASSISTANCE STRATEGY 

A. Progress Since the 2000 CAS Progress Report and Lessons f rom Past Bank Group Activities 

61. 
The objectives o f the last C A S Progress Repor t f o r Ecuador, (R2000-102, presented to the Boa rd 
on June 22, 2000), were t o he lp the Government t o (a) protect the poor, limit human cap i ta l deterioration, 
and set the basis f o r human development and pover ty reduc t ion in the m e d i um and l o n g term; (b) restore 
macro f inanc ia l stability, rehabilitate the bank ing system, and promo te recovery in economic growth; and 
(c) address key structural reforms necessary t o support sustainable development and pover ty reduc t ion 
over the med ium and l o n g term. The Progress Repor t ind ica ted that the effectiveness o f the Bank’s 
assistance should be judged in terms o f i t s ab i l i ty t o (a) imp rove p ro tec t ion o f the mos t vulnerable groups 
and limit human cap i ta l deterioration; and (b) imp rove macroeconomic management and restore the 
bank ing system to operab i l i ty . 
62. 
Ecuador has recovered on several performance measures since 2000, but has not advanced as 
rapidly as was hoped in certain areas. A comparison o f actual outcomes o n macroeconomic, human 
development, and governance benchmarks established in the 2000 C A S Progress Repor t indicates more 
rap id progress than expected on mos t macroeconomic measures, but delays in ach iev ing the hoped-for 
human development and improved governance outcomes (see the C A S Results Framework in Annex 
B l l ) , due t o a s low s t a r t in imp lemen t ing the r e f o rm program a t tr ibu tab le t o turnover among key 
Government o f f ic ia ls , especially in the Ministry o f Finance. Moreover , the Government has struggled t o 
ma in ta in t ime ly serv ic ing o f i t s debts t o a l l i t s creditors and suppliers and has ye t t o recover access t o 
pr iva te cap i ta l markets. However, i t i s impor tan t t o recognize that in almost a l l instances, the country i s 
better o f f than t w o years ago. F o r examples among the benchmarks tha t were n o t met, in f la t ion has 
dropped f r o m 9 1 percent in 2000 t o 9.3 percent in 2002 (compared t o the benchmark o f 5 percent); pub l ic 
expenditure on b o t h hea l th and education has doub led in the last t w o years, rising t o a comb ined 4.4 
percent o f GDP, (compared to a comb ined 6.5 percent target); and cap i ta l adequacy o f p r iva te banks i s 
be ing raised t o Basle standards b y December 2003, compared t o a December 2002 target. 
63. 
Progress was slower than hoped due to difficulties in achieving a consensus on reforms. The 
prev ious Adm in is t ra t ion had l im i t e d support in a d iv ided Congress and after t w o decades o f “structural 
adjustment” and a severe cr is is that drove up pove r ty rates sharply in the la te 199Os, there was l i t t l e pub l ic 
support f o r fur ther adjustment. This in turn made i t easier f o r special interests to b l o c k essential re forms 
(such as increasing the e f f ic iency o f pub l ic enterprises and the f l e x i b i l i t y o f pub l ic expenditures), lead ing 
in some cases t o backs l id ing on  commitment^.^ Moreover , Ecuador has had six presidents over the past 
seven years, together w i t h countless changes in Government M in is ters , making i t d i f f i c u l t t o establish a 
dialogue and reach consensus on a med ium - te rm development strategy. These r i s k s can s t i l l n o t be 
discounted f u l l y in the future. 
64. 
The challenging environment affected the Bank Group’s assistance program. Compared t o a 
base case scenario o f n ine loans f o r up t o $425 m i l l ion , the f ina l lend ing scenario was a l o w one, w i t h 
$280 m i l l i o n in e igh t operations. The experience with the $151 m i l l i o n s truc tura l adjustment operation 
was disappointing, w i t h effectiveness delayed by one year due t o d i f f icu l t ies in ensuring a sound 
macroeconomic framework after Boa rd approval, and the cance l la t ion o f t w o f loa t ing tranches that 
supported impor tan t lega l and tax re forms . On the other hand, the new Adm in is t ra t ion was able t o 
complete the commitments fo r the release o f the $30 m i l l i o n second tranche o n M a r c h 27, 2003. The 
qua l i ty o f the po r t fo l io o f investment pro jec ts has been affected b y persistent shortages o f counterpart 
funding due t o the country’s f isca l problems, but the reduc t ion o f po l i t ica l in f luence in the selection

such as on decentralization, anticorruption, and procurement, although AAA on gender, SAPRI, and

building through the Wo r ld Bank Institute (WBI) and environmental protection supported by Global 
Environmental Facility (GEF) and Montreal Protocol (MP) projects. In particular, the W B I provided a 
six-month capacity-building course in 200 1 w i th broad participation across six La t in American countries, 
including Ecuador, to promote national anticorruption strategies. I t also collaborated w i th an Ecuadorian 
enterprise and local university that brought the Global Development Learning Network (GDLN) to 
Ecuador in 2001. Training was also provided to indigenous representatives on the Development 
Gateway. The activities supported under Japanese and Norwegian grants fo r gender and indigenous 
activities were discussed ear l ier . Finally, a range o f GEF Medium Sized Projects totaling $3.5 m i l l i o n 
were implemented successfully during the period, supporting such activities as wetlands conservation, 
conservation o f fragile ecosystems in the Choco Andean region, the establishment o f a socio- 
environmental monitoring system in the Galapagos Islands, and recovering ancestral knowledge on water 
and biodiversity conservation in semi-arid coastal areas. In November 2002, an $8 m i l l ion GEF grant 
was approved to strengthen protection o f the National System o f Protected Areas, and a $3.4 m i l l i o n MP 
grant i s currently helping to reduce the industrial use o f ozone-depleting substances (ODs). Further work 
w i l l be required t o mainstream GEF support, as has been done w i t h an energy conservation GEF grant 
related t o an energy loan, Promec (Annex C).

o f the IFC, the priorities envisioned fo r FY00-02 were to (a) support existing clients; (b) support export- 
oriented projects, particularly in natural resources and agribusiness; (c) enhance the capabilities o f 
financial institutions in improving access to t e rm financing; and (d) stimulate private sector investment in 
infrastructure. The 2000 CAS Progress Report anticipated that IFC’s ability to invest in the financial and 
infrastructure sectors would depend on progress in reforms and improvements in the regulatory 
environment. During t h i s period, po l i t ica l uncertainties and macroeconomic weakness continued, while 
the closure o f failed banks resu l ted in consolidation o f the private banking sector. These factors 
discouraged new private investment in Ecuador. Coupled w i t h l i t t le progress in the regulatory 
environment, these conditions presented the IFC w i t h very l im i ted investment opportunities. During the 
period, the I FC continued to support i t s existing clients w i th good standing and export-orientation in 
agribusiness. 
In February 2003, the IFC made a $15 m i l l i o n investment in support o f the banana 
exporting company, Favorita Fruit (Box 4). The IFC’s current held po r t fo l io stands at $68 m i l l i o n 
(including the recent $15 m i l l i o n investment), consisting o f financings fo r seven companies in 
agribusiness, manufacturing, infrastructure, and the financial sector.

MIGA’s outstanding guarantees portfolio in Ecuador consists o f four contracts o f guarantee, w i th 
a US$37.1 m i l l i o n gross exposure, o f which MIGA’s ne t exposure i s US$35.9 m i l l ion . The total 
estimated amount o f FDI facilitated t o date by MIGA in Ecuador i s US$352.1 m i l l ion . I t s activities in the 
country were fairly limited during the last CAS period, although MIGA currently has various active 
applications for Ecuador in the infrastructure and power sectors. MIGA has also assisted Ecuador in i t s 
FDI attraction activities. 
In June 2000, for example, the United Nations Conference on Trade and 
Development (UNCTAD ) and MIGA jo in t ly held a regional workshop on investment promotion for 
representatives f rom the Andean Community member countries. Ecuador sent representatives f r om i t s 
investment promotion agency to participate and discuss regional trends in FDI, and new initiatives in 
investment promotion, and to begin discussions on cooperative regional arrangements for promotion.

Box 4. I F C Case Study-Support f o r Favorita Fruit Company 

The Favorita F ru i t Company (‘Favorita” o r the Group) i s one o f the leading banana producers and exporters in 
Ecuador. The IFC has supported Favorita not on ly w i t h cr i t ica l long-term financing, but also w i th environmental 
and social sustainability and corporate social responsibility (or CSR). 
O n the financing front, the I FC has prov ided Favorita w i t h total financing o f US$45 m i l l i o n on three occasions since 
1993. This consists o f a US$15 m i l l i o n loan (including a US$5 m i l l i o n syndicated loan) financed for Reybanpac 
(the Group’s banana plantation company) in 1993, a U S 1 5 m i l l i o n financing package (including a US$10 m i l l i o n 
loan and a US$5 m i l l i o n equity investment) provided to the Group in 1998, and a US$15 m i l l i o n loan approved t h i s 
year. W i t h these financings, the I FC helped Favorita expand to create a f u l l y integrated production, packing, and 
transport system, inc lud ing development o f por t facilities at Guayaquil, modernization and expansion o f i t s 
cardboard box manufacturing plant, and acquisition and refurbishment o f banana plantations. 
I FC also supported Favorita in achieving higher international standards in environmental and social measures 
( inc lud ing labor practices) and corporate governance, and extending such applicable standards to i t s independent 
banana suppliers. Favorita has had a longstanding commitment in these areas. W i t h IFC ’s support, Favorita has 
recognized that strengthening i t s practices in these areas has a positive impact no t on ly o n the society and the 
economy but also o n the firm’s market access, and thus an important element for long-term business success. In 
coordination w i th the IFC, Favorita i s in i t ia t ing a program to have i t s suppliers ECO -OK certified. The ECO -OK 
cer t i f ica t ion i s an international qualification granted b y the Sustainable Agriculture Ne two rk ( S A N ) , a coa l i t ion o f 
NGOs that includes the Rainforest Alliance. Such certification wou ld enable Favorita to broaden i ts export market, 
wh ich i s increasingly sustainability-conscious. The activities on Favorita’s ind iv idua l supplier farms to achieve 
certification would range f rom e l im ina t ion o f ch i ld labor practices and reforestation programs to construction o f 
so l id waste and wastewater systems and pest management programs. Favorita i s committed to leading these efforts. 
The IFC-administered Corporate Citizenship Fac i l i ty has approved funding fo r t h i s program. 

The last CAS period presents several lessons for this CAS. 

68. 
Experience w i th regard t o 
adjustment operations in Ecuador since the mid-1990s has shown that multi-tranche loans have run in to 
difficulties in later stages o f execution, largely due to changing po l i t ica l circumstances that have quickly 
eroded support for reforms. The lack o f success w i th multi-tranche operations was also pointed out in a 
Quality Assurance Group (QAG) review o f the recently concluded S A L , which recommended single- 
tranche lending in Ecuador’s case. To increase success in new policy-based lending, the Bank w i l l fo l low 
this recommendation and develop a ser ies o f single-tranche operations w i t h a l l commitments met p r io r to 
Board presentation. The investment po r t fo l io benefited f rom j o i n t Wo r ld Bank-Ministry o f Finance- 
Presidency follow-up on project issues under the previous Administration, and f r om independent 
prequalification processes fo r appointing technical staff o f project coordination units. These modalities 
w i l l be continued over the next CAS period. In l igh t o f the difficulties in project execution caused b y late 
or inadequate transfers o f counterpart funds, i t w i l l also be essential to reach agreement w i t h Ecuadorian 
officials during the budget planning process, and v ia quarterly reviews o f transfers, on adequate 
counterpart funding o f projects. The experience f rom the previous CAS period suggests that future AAA 
w i l l benefit f rom securing, at an early stage, a broader support base t o ensure in teres t as we l l as ownership 
and support for any follow-up actions that could a r ise f rom the AAA. Finally, the Bank should continue 
to build on positive experiences w i th an active dialogue w i t h c i v i l society. 
69. 
Evaluation for Ecuador. The last Country Assistance Evaluation fo r Ecuador (Report No. 21825) was 
prepared in 1999 and was presented t o the Board by the Operations Evaluation Department (OED) in 
January 2001. I t concluded that poverty reduction remains Ecuador’s main development challenge and 
underscored the d i f f icu l t external environment and lack o f commitment t o re fo rm at different levels o f 
Ecuadorian society. I t therefore cautioned the Bank against moving too quickly in to a high lending 
scenario on the basis o f poorly defined or reversible triggers (Box 5). 

The new CAS also takes into account recommendations from the last OED Country Assistance 

2 1 

Box 5. OED’s Country Assistance Evaluation o f 2001 Recommended a New Approach to Assisting Ecuador 

The 2001 OED Country Assistance Evaluation reviewed the Bank’s assistance program fo r the per iod FY94 -98 and 
concluded, among other things, that: 
“The reduction o f poverty remains Ecuador’s ma in development challenge. Mee t ing i t w i l l require faster, labor- 
intensive output growth, inc lus ion o f the poor (especially women) in the development process and more effective 
targeting o f social services.” 
“Historically, adjustment lending has not been a successful instrument in Ecuador. This suggests that, at a 
minimum, further quick-disbursing lending should be extended on ly when major reforms have reached the “sticky”, 
hard-to-reverse stage.” 
“The experience o f the past 16 years suggests the need fo r a new approach. A revised strategy m igh t incorporate: 
continued restructuring o f the existing portfolio; t ime ly and high-quality nonlending services designed to build 
wider societal support fo r reform; diminished reliance o n quick-disbursing assistance to solve long-term institutional 
and po l icy problems; small-scale, f lex ib le lending targeted at grass-roots poverty and gender-oriented initiatives; 
Adaptable Program Lend ing Loans (APLs) for poverty-oriented and sectoral reforms where strong borrower 
commitment has been demonstrated; strengthened coordination w i t h the IDB and the CAF; and reduced turnover 
among Bank managers and staff to enhance project continuity.”

70. 

This CAS takes in to account OED’s recommendations in that the CAS was developed w i th 
extensive consultations-as w i l l be the case for projects under the CAS; nonlending AAA i s an integral 
part o f the assistance p rog ram beginning w i t h a comprehensive set o f Policy Notes, and the lending 
program i s back-loaded in the CAS period. This CAS concurs w i t h OED findings that the results o f 
earlier Structural Adjustment Loans ( S A L S ) have been disappointing-although 
the most recent S A L 
achieved more than previous re fo rm programs. The disappointments are attributable at least in part t o the 
use o f a relatively in f lex ib le multi-tranche instrument in a changing po l i t ica l environment. Therefore, 
unlike in the past, and in l ine w i t h Q AG recommendations, adjustment lending in t h i s CAS w i l l only be 
v ia single-tranche loans based on p r io r actions, the in i t ia l S L s are small, and the S A L relationship i s 
built up prudently over time i f clear, nonreversible reforms are undertaken. These loans are accompanied 
b y a range o f AAA activities, WB I activities and investment projects that support institutional and policy 
reforms. The Bank has also approved i t s f i r s t Adaptable Program Loans (AF’Ls) fo r Ecuador-for 
rural 
water. Finally, base and high case lending are contingent on meeting a firm set o f triggers (Section IV.D). 

B. Objectives of the 2003 Coun t ry Assistance Strategy 

71. 

The Government’s strategy i s t o b r ing Ecuadorian citizens together t o launch a concerted fight 
against poverty, through coordinated advances on the economic and social fronts. On the economic front, 
the Government’s strategy i s anchored around fiscal consolidation and comprises reforms to promote 
competitiveness, improve basic infrastructure, strengthen financial markets, and create more flexible labor 
markets. On the social front, the Government’s strategy i s t o re fo rm social assistance, education, health, 
and social security t o better fight poverty. This i s complemented b y a sovereign and proactive 
international policy and by a commitment to f igh t corruption and increase overall security, which i s 
broadly defined to include jud ic ia l and environmental security. 
The Bank Group’s objective for t h i s CAS i s to help the Government achieve these major results 
b y providing technical and financial assistance t o (a) consolidate the macroeconomic framework and lay 
the foundations fo r diversified and sustainable economic growth and poverty reduction; (b) increase 
opportunities and broaden access t o economic resources, and make the needed structural reforms socially 
sustainable by mitigating the impacts on the poor and vulnerable; and (c) strengthen governance by 
helping the Ecuadorian officials build an accountable and efficient government, the services o f which are 
accessible to a l l Ecuadorians.

73. 

This C A S takes a four-year, med ium- term perspective o f Ecuador’s development, cover ing the 
full te rm o f the present government through the change in Adm in is t ra t ion in 2007. During this period, a 
CAS Progress Repor t w i l l be presented to the Boa rd t o update the strategy presented here. The Bank 
Group’s technical and f inanc ia l assistance in t h i s pe r iod w i l l focus o n p romo t ing economic g row th w i t h 
greater equ i ty and imp roved governance (Tables 4 and 5). The effectiveness o f the Bank’s assistance 
should be evaluated against these objectives. Annex B 9 sets ou t benchmarks agreed w i t h the Government 
t o he lp mon i to r and evaluate the imp lemen ta t ion o f the B a n k Group’s assistance, many o f them a l igned 
w i t h the M i l l e n n i um Deve lopmen t Goals. These key objectives co inc ide w i t h those o f other key

Fiscal discipline and consolidation are essential under dollarization, since the Government 
cannot use monetary or exchange rate policy to influence economic behavior. Ecuador has had a 
h is to ry o f f isca l ind isc ip l ine that can be ascribed to a legacy o f po l i t ica l exclusion. F o r example, w i t h 
regard t o tax po l icy , a number o f “nuisance taxes” (cos t ing more t o co l lec t than they e f fec t ive ly y ie lded t o 
Government) were created in response t o par t icu lar needs, and exemptions were s im i la r ly granted t o 
par t icu lar groups. The l im i t e d tax co l lec t ions a f ter exemptions (on ly 6.3 percent o f GDP in 1996) were in 
turn preassigned t o specific groups, leav ing l im i t e d resources fo r pub l ic goods p rov is ion and basic 
infrastructure, wh ich cou ld indeed have bene f i ted the en t ire population. Tax revenues are regressive, w i t h 
the m a i n revenues com ing f r o m the value added tax and re la t ive ly l im i t e d co l lec t ions com ing f r o m 
income, property, and luxu ry taxes. On the spending side, soc ia l expenditures are also regressive, due t o 
generalized subsidies f o r products and services consumed more by wealthier fam i l ies ( fo r example, h ighe r 
education, fuel, cook ing gas, water supply, telephony). Moreover , there has been considerable ine r t ia in 
budgeting, expenditures have n o t been su f f ic ien t ly transparent, and they have ra re ly adjusted in a 
s ign i f ican t way (and cer ta in ly n o t p rocyc l ica l ly ) in response t o h igh ly vo la t i le , oil-based revenues, 
resu l t ing in seignorage o r in the accumu la t ion o f debt ac t ing as the adjustment variables. Thus, Ecuador’s 
pub l ic sector debt has quadrupled since 1980, even as rea l GDP pe r capita has rema ined unchanged, and 
in f la t ion (wh ich taxes the poor and m idd le class mo re than wea l th ier ind iv idua ls w h o can better shelter

their incomes in hard currency) averaged close to 30 percent in the late 1990s. Finally, there has been 
l i t t l e incentive fo r local governments t o collect taxes because they have received central government 
transfers without corresponding spending or disclosure responsibilities. 
The Bank has prepared Policy Notes on the macrofiscal situation, debt administration, and tax 
policy fo r the new Administration, and w i l l be preparing a Public Expenditure Review jo in t ly w i th the 
IDB, as we l l as a Fiscal Decentralization and Debt Management Study. The FY02 Public Financial 
Management Loan w i l l build on earlier support under a State Modernization Project (MOSTA, Loan 
3822-EC) to support increased transparency and accountability by consolidating and extending the 
SIGEF. In l igh t o f the importance o f fiscal consolidation for the success o f the Government’s program, 
the Bank w i l l support fiscal and debt management, tax reform, improved expenditure management, 
revenue stabilization, reform in basic infrastructure services, and preservation o f fiscal equilibrium 
throughout the decentralization process under a three-part ser ies o f single-tranche, policy-based Fiscal 
and Competitiveness Loans between now and FYO7.’ 
These loans w i l l draw heavily on the 
aforementioned AAA in their design. 
The Bank w i l l also continue to support Ecuador’s efforts to increase competitiveness. Over the 
past f ive years, a Bank-financed International Trade and Integration Project (Annex C) has supported 
Ecuador’s efforts t o shape a National Competitiveness Agenda, introduce a culture o f quality (including 
I S 0 ratings) among exporters, improve the country’s institutional framework fo r metrology, norm-setting, 
and accreditation, and reduce impediments t o industry and commerce in the f o rm o f bureaucratic delays 
in business registrations, phytosanitary clearances, and technical barriers t o trade. Still, Ecuador earns 
l ow rankings in international ratings o f competitiveness, due to impediments ranging f r om jud ic ia l 
insecurity t o bureaucracy to financial sector weakness and l ow adoption o f technology. Indeed, Ecuador 
has low patent applications and invests far less in research and development than the average fo r the 
region (this i s an area in which the Bank and the IDB have tried to support progress in agricultural 
research and in science and technology, respectively). I t also has important barriers t o imports, lacks 
antimonopoly legislation (last year a competition law drawn up w i th Bank project support and approved 
by Congress was vetoed by the President), and faces severe constraints in domestic distribution networks 
that prejudice small-scale entrepreneurs and consumers, in particular. I t has only recently begun to 
address important information technology constraints through a National Connectivity Agenda t o bridge 
the digital divide. And the costs o f doing business remain h igh compared to other countries (Table 6).

The Bank w i l l provide analytical support t o Government w i t h a study o f Constraints to Growth, 
an Investment Climate Assessment, and the Ru ra l Development Strategy. In addition, the Bank w i l l 
support a Competitiveness project and a Rural Production project to address several o f the above 
constraints, together w i th the series o f Fiscal and Competitiveness Adjustment Loans, which w i l l help 
strengthen the legal, regulatory, and institutional framework fo r competition. This work w i l l be 
coordinated closely w i t h the Andean Development Corporation (CAF), and w i l l be complemented, 
wherever feasible, by direct assistance to the private sector provided by the I FC and MIGA. 

5 . These loans constitute a program o f support in fiscal and competitiveness areas. However, since the government has yet t o 
formulate detailed policies in certain key areas, such as decentralization or hydrocarbons, t h e Bank i s eschewing a 
programmatic loan approach in these areas to be able to adjust the content o f later loans in t h e series to support key reforms. 
In the social areas, the government has already determined a clear program o f reforms that the Bank intends to support w i t h 
th ree Programmatic Structural Adjustment L o a n s (PSALs) fo r social sector reform.

Ecuador depends heavily on oil, but has not availed itself of this resource to its fu l l potential, 
nor has it put in place best practice safeguards against environmental damage or social consequences. 
The Bank has played a limited role in the hydrocarbons sector in recent years. On the other hand, i t s 
assistance has been strategic. Through an Energy Sector Management Assistance Program (ESMAP) 
Grant, the Bank has provided support fo r training indigenous communities to negotiate on an informed 
basis w i t h prospective o i l investors, while a Bank-supported Institutional Development Fund (IDF) grant 
has facilitated a two-year participatory process to develop regulations in l ine w i th legal and constitutional 
requirements-and w i th international commitments w i t h the International Labour O f f ice (LO)-to 
ensure adequate consultation processes in the case o f investments in ancestral indigenous lands and 
environmentally sensitive areas. These regulations were promulgated v ia Presidential Decree in 
December 2002. Most recently, a Bank Policy Note on hydrocarbons has pointed out important sources 
o f inefficiency in o i l refinement that could be resulting in enormous economic losses t o the State. 
Look ing ahead, i t w i l l be important fo r the Govemment t o consider a five-point program o f re fo rm to 
promote the sector in an environmentally and socially sustainable way b y (a) redefining the role o f 
Petroecuador, ending i t s monopoly; (b) creating opportunities fo r best practice private investment in the 
sector, both upstream and downstream; (c) reviewing taxation and p r ic ing policies; (d) improving the 
management o f environmental and social impacts, ensuring that Ecuador does not lag behind other o i l - 
producing countries in t h i s regard, but rather consistently applies international best practices in the 
industry; and (e) improving management, administration, and pansparency related t o o i l rents. The Bank 
i s currently providing jo in t technical assistance w i th the IDB and C A F to help the Government redress the 
immediate problem o f significant economic losses in Petroecuador’ s refineries. 
82. 
The new Administration i s s t i l l formulating i t s policies fo r the broader hydrocarbons sector, 
although i t has repeatedly emphasized the importance o f attracting private investment in to the sector. 
Once the Government has conducted i t s review and determined i t s policies fo r the sector, i t s leve l o f 
commitment t o an o i l sector re fo rm that embraces the above areas-notably best practice environmental 
safeguards and social participation-will be a critical trigger fo r determining the scope fo r Bank technical 
assistance to help re fo rm the sector. In a s i m i l a r manner, potential IFC investment in hydrocarbons w i l l 
depend critically on the legal and regulatory framework, and on the sector’s (particularly PetroEcuador’s) 
application o f international best practice environmental and social safeguards, and assistance b y the Bank 
or other institutions in these areas. In the interim, the Bank i s planning to develop a second ESMAP grant 
t o strengthen training for indigenous communities on the newly approved consultation regulations, and i s 
working w i th the Govemment to support the implementation o f the new consultation guidelines as part o f 
the series o f Fiscal Consolidation and Competitive Growth Loans. 
83. 
The electricity sector has gone through an incomplete reform process since 1996. Wh i le 
previous Bank and IDB assistance has helped to separate electricity generation, transmission, and 
distribution functions and put in place a wholesale energy market regulated by the National Electricity 
Council (CONELEC) and efficiently managed by the National Center fo r Energy Control (CENACE), the 
reforms have been incomplete. The national Solidarity Fund and loca l government owners o f distribution 
companies have failed to upgrade their management, permitting average losses o f one-third o f energy 
generated, due to a combination o f distribution losses and insufficient b i l l collection. This has created 
persistent deficits in payments to generators, which resulted in the nonpayment o f debt t o the national 
government and insufficient investment in operations and maintenance by generators, and has in turn 
discouraged private participation in generation. Despite this problematic environment, there have been 

21

p r iva te sector gas-fired plant and a transmission l i n e capacity upgrade t o increase impo r ts o f e lec tr ic i ty

the light o f a fa i led attempt t o p r iva t ize e lec tr ic i ty d is t r ibu t ion over the past t w o years and the continued 
oppos i t ion t o p r iva t iza t ion o f state assets, the new Adm in is t ra t ion i s ad jus t ing t a r i f f s t o economic costs

investment and achieve sustainable e f f ic iency

commitment. 
84. 
The Government has developed a strategy t o reduce the f inanc ia l de f ic i t and imp rove the 
e f f ic iency o f the e lec tr ic i ty sector, wh ich wou ld en ta i l the f o l l ow i n g key elements: t r u s t fund m e c h a n i sm 
t o ensure t ime ly payment t o generators (as p roved essential f o r the new p r iva te sector players); reso lu t ion 
o f the challenges fac ing Emelec, the Guayaqu i l d is t r ibu t ion u t i l i ty ; debt res truc tur ing f o r a l l government- 
owned companies in the sector; and a med ium- term strategy f o r sustainable e f f ic iency improvements in 
d is t r ibu t ion and p r iva te investment in the sector. The Bank, in turn, approved a pro jec t in 2001 t o 
modernize e lec tr ic i ty and telecommunications services in rural areas (Promec), w h i c h i s assisting w i t h the 
regu la tory framework, pa r t icu la r ly in the wholesale market, and with e lec t r i f ica t ion f o r poo r ru ra l and 
infra-urban households, as w e l l as complementary GEF support f o r energy conservation and sma l l powe r 
generation projects using sma l l renewable energy sources-although 
the B a n k w i l l n o t engage in ma jo r 
infrastructure investments in t h i s area. The Promec pro jec t has a ma jo r soc ia l outreach component t o 
build understanding and support f o r deeper reforms. 
85. 
The telecommunications sector also requires further private investment to improve quality and 
coverage. F ixed - l ine telephony i s presently monopo l ized b y three state-owned enterprises that have 
p rov ided poor-qua l i ty service (48 breakdowns pe r 100 l ines in 2000) at subsidized rates (about h a l f the 
cost per m inu te o f ne ighbo r ing countries) t o a select few (coverage i s l im i t e d t o under 15 l ines per 100 
inhabitants). The government has attracted p r iva te investors i n t o wireless loca l l o o p and ce l lu lar phone 
services in recent years, but compe t i t ion i s s t i l l weak in these areas, a f fec t ing pr ices and qua l i ty o f

consolidation o f the fou r regu la tory agencies, and fur ther p r iva te investment i s requ ired t o ensure 
su f f ic ien t compe t i t ion and imp rove qua l i ty and coverage. The Promec p ro jec t together with the series o f 
F isca l and Competitiveness Loans w i l l he lp strengthen the regu la tory f ramewo rk over the nex t several 
years, and subsidize extension o f coverage t o r u r a l and poo r in fra-urban households. 
86. 
Maintenance of national highways has improved over the past four years, but secondary and 
feeder roads need substantial upgrading. Progress on imp rov ing the qua l i ty o f h ighways has been 
greatest in the case o f concessions t o pr iva te operators, wh ich supports the v iew tha t the Pub l ic Wo rks 
M i n i s t r y should steadily trans form i tse l f i n t o a mo re regu la tory Ministry o f Transport. The CAF has 
taken the lead in suppor t ing h ighway construction-the B a n k w i l l n o t p rov ide support in this area, o r in 
the area o f ports and airports. On the other hand, the IDB and the B a n k are j o i n t l y prepar ing a Ru ra l 
Roads pro jec t focused in the poorest provinces and based o n p rov inc ia l - leve l p lann ing processes. The 
p ro jec t should encourage jobs in microenterprise and cooperative road maintenance and transport 
companies, and open up marg ina l ized areas t o the na t iona l marke t and imp rove access t o soc ia l services. 
87. 
The water and sanitation sector is characterized by low levels of coverage, particularly in rura l 
areas, by poor service quality, and by the inefficiency of urban service providers. In addition, l o w cost 
recovery through t a r i f f s has made water and sanitation service prov iders h i g h l y dependent o n transfers 
f r o m na t iona l and mun ic ipa l governments and has depr ived them o f the operational revenues needed t o

per dollar o f GDP in purchasing power parity terms, compared to 0.4 kilograms on average for the La t in America region).

extend coverage t o the unserved poor. In peri-urban areas, poor populations not connected t o the water 
supply network o f ten spend 20 t imes as much buying water f rom tanker trucks as their neighbors who are 
connected t o the formal network. In rural areas, poor, unserved households spend hours each day 
collecting water o f dubious quality f rom streams and ponds. The Bank has supported extension o f water 
supply services through the f i r s t phase o f i t s Rural and Small Towns Water Supply and Sanitation 
Adaptable Program Loan (APL), Praguas, designed to reach 360,000 rural inhabitants, and through i t s 
Indigenous and Afro-Ecuadorian Development Project, Prodepine. A second APL fo r Praguas i s planned 
to begin late in the CAS period, and w i l l be supported by commitments under adjustment loans, w i th a 
view to deepening policy reforms; developing performance-based transfer mechanisms fo r allocating 
central government transfers; preparing a new Water, Sanitation and Solid Waste Sector L aw to clarify 
the regulatory framework; and supporting new and rehabilitated water and/or sanitation services for about 
980,000 people in ru ra l areas. This w i l l be complemented b y IDB support fo r water and sanitation in 
larger and medium-sized cities, and by an urban poverty-reduction project scheduled fo r FY05, which 
w i l l among other things address urban drainage and f lood control issues o f critical importance t o the poor. 

Broaden ing Access to Resources and Ensuring Re fo rms A r e Socially Sustainable 

88. 
A key underlying reason for the widespread poverty in Ecuador today is the lack of adequate 
social inclusion. There are s t i l l wide gaps in income levels and in unmet basic needs between the white- 
mestizo population and the indigenous or A f r o population. Indeed, while indigenous organizations have 
carved out a growing po l i t ica l role over the past decade, the A f r o population continues t o be poorly 
organized and largely invisible (Box 6). There are also large gaps in access to resources between urban 
and rural populations and between men and women. Therefore, ethnic, spatial, and gender considerations 
need to be built in to policy and project designs in a consistent way to ensure access fo r the poorest, and in 
the particular case o f indigenous populations, i t i s essential t o take in to account cultural values tied to 
ancestral traditions that may d i f fe r f rom those o f the majority population. Together w i th the International 
Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) and the European Union, the Bank has attempted t o promote 
improved access t o financial capital and to productive and social capital in poorer ru ra l communities 
through the Prolocal and Prodepine projects. A second Prodepine project, specifically targeted at and 
designed by and fo r indigenous and Afro-Ecuadorian communities, i s planned fo r the CAS. This would 
be complemented b y a capacity-building program fo r indigenous leaders in a l l f ive Andean countries, 
w i t h support f r om the WB I and the Development Gateway Foundation, to promote strategic participatory 
planning and access to information technology, and WB I assistance to enhance negotiation s k i l l s fo r 
indigenous peoples. Moreover, bo th to increase social inclusion and to build broader support fo r reforms, 
WB I i s also considering capacity-enhancement programs in the areas o f consensus building, strategic 
planning w i th communities, governance and community empowerment, the role o f parliament and c i v i l 
society in pro-growth policy design, access to information, and monitoring and evaluation o f governance 
and public services. Finally, the Bank i s considering AAA support fo r out-of-school youth to promote 
youth development and social inclusion. 
89. 
Improved education i s widely considered in Ecuador to be the country’s top development 
priority. No t only are Ecuador’s education expenditures relative to GDP below average fo r the region, 
but they are also distributed p r ima r i ly to salaries (86 percent), w i th virtually n o resources fo r didactic 
materials, school maintenance, or investment in new infrastructure. There are underused resources in the 
sector, insofar as studendteacher ratios are l ow b y regional standards and repeater rates are high. Also, 
absenteeism i s notorious in ru ra l single-teacher schools and greater accountability and local autonomy are 
important challenges s t i l l to be addressed. In response t o the priorities expressed by c i v i l society (Annex 
E), the Bank has included support for this important sector in the CAS via both AAA and lending, 
building on earlier AAA completed in 2003. Education reforms w i l l also be supported through a series o f 
three, single-tranche Programmatic Social Adjustment Loans designed to promote reforms in the social 
sectors (education, health, social assistance, and pensions), wh ich complements the series o f three Fiscal 
and Competitiveness Loans. The Bank‘s objective i s to support expanded coverage o f basic education

1 Box 6. Ecuadorians o f African Descent A re Large ly Invisible in Society 
There are between 500,000 and 1 m i l l i o n Ecuadorians o f A fr ican descent, and they are concentrated in the coastal 
provinces o f Guayas and Esmeraldas and in the Chota-Mira Va l ley north o f Quito. 
In urban settings, A f ro - 
Ecuadorians l i v e in extremely poor neighborhoods w i t h deficient public services, l im i ted employment opportunities, 
and restricted possibilities for developing small business. 
In rura l and coastal settings, they frequently share 
communities w i t h other ethnic groups and depend on forest-, agriculture-, and marine-based subsistence activities 
fo r their livelihoods. 
In a society characterized b y ethnic and cultural diversity, Ecuadorians o f A f r ican descent are largely 
invisible. O f f i c i a l disaggregated data about the popu la t ion and their l i v i n g conditions are scarce; pub l ic investment 
in their geographical areas o f concentration i s very low . Their national and community organizations lack po l i t ica l 
c lou t or even broad recognition. Their contributions to the economic, social, and cultural identity o f the country are 
underestimated and seldom recognized, and the barrier o f prejudice has yet to be f u l l y overcome. As a result, A f ro - 
Ecuadorians have no t been able to reap the benefits o f the development processes o f the country, nor has Ecuador 
benefited f u l l y f r om the knowledge, s k i l l s , and imagination o f t h i s community. 
Breaking this vicious c irc le o f poverty, exclusion, and isolation involves assertive actions to create o f f i c i a l 
and loca l spaces where the community can voice their concerns and be heard, and where their loca l development 
activities gain legitimacy and acknowledgement. This w i l l require making Afro-Ecuadorians v is ib le in population 
information-gathering instruments; supporting loca l ly based participatory models o f development planning, 
management, and evaluation; directing more resources to urban and ru ra l communities w i t h high concentrations o f 
Afro-Ecuadorians (as do, for example, the Bank-supported projects Prodepine and Prolocal-see Annex C), and 
~ strengthening o f f i c i a l institutions mandated to represent and safeguard the well-being o f the community, notably the 
recently established Afro-Ecuadorian Development Corporation (CODAEi).

Ecuador’s pension system has been strengthened by an Intervention Commission since 1998. 
Whereas the Ecuadorian Social Security Institute ( IESS) , which provides bo th pension and medical 
benefits, had been close to bankruptcy and had operated fo r several years without published financial 
accounts, the Commission strengthened management o f the IESS , brought accounts up to date, reduced 
cross-subsidies across benefit schemes, and presented a Social Security re fo rm law t o Congress that 
would have set up a three-p i l lar pension system. On the other hand, the law has no t been applied due to 
questions on key items raised by the Constitutional Tribunal, and bene f i ts are no t coordinated w i th the 
bono solidario social assistance program, which in fact covers more senior citizens than the social 
security system. Accounting and investment policies need to be strengthened further, as do actuarial 
valuations and oversight o f the I E S S . The Bank has begun to study these areas through i t s Policy Notes. 
The planned Programmatic Social Adjustment Loans and Health and Social Security project would 
support further reforms to strengthen and deepen social security coverage. 
93. 
Ecuador has a range of social assistance programs but these are not w e l l coordinated to ensure 
comprehensive, well-targeted coverage of the most vulnerable groups. Ecuador has close to 20 social 
assistance programs; however, their coverage, targeting, and impact have no t been adequately monitored. 
The most important program, the bono solidario, i s among the best-targeted social p r o g r am fo r the poor 
in Ecuador, and reaches about 1.2 m i l l ion female heads o f household. Currently, the SELBEN database 
set up t o ensure means-testing o f beneficiaries i s being reviewed w i t h IDB support t o improve targeting, 
and the Bank w i l l assist this process w i th poverty mapping through i t s ongoing Poverty Assessment 
AAA, paying particular attention to marginalized groups, including indigenous and Afro-Ecuadorian 
communities. The Bank recommends increasing the f lex ib i l i ty o f the social assistance programs b y 
developing an anticyclical program l ike public workfare, or designing an anticyclical component in the 
safety net, such as a mechanism t o increase t h e beneficiaries o f some programs during times o f crisis, or 
automatic increases in social assistance programs during such times. In addition, the Bank has proposed 
that the bono solidario be transformed in to a conditional cash transfer program t o protect the health o f 
children and pregnant women, improving i t s targeting mechanism, and evaluating i t s impact. Again, 
these issues w i l l be taken up through the programmatic lending. 
Poverty, wh i le deeper in rura l areas, increased significantly in urban areas with the crisis. Six 
out o f 10 Ecuadorians now l ive in urban areas. This i s below the average fo r L a t i n America but i s rising 
rapidly. Moreover, whereas before the 1999 crisis, one-third o f the poor l i v e d in urban areas, after the 
crisis t h i s number had r i s e n to 48 percent, bo th because o f rural-urban migration and because o f the lack 
o f coping mechanisms and greater vulnerability t o downswings in income w i t h the loss o f employment. 
Urban property rights are frequently poorly defined, and l i v i n g conditions and overcrowding in slum 
areas are particularly worrisome fo r Guayaquil and certain secondary cities. The solutions for urban 
compared to ru ra l poverty w i l l need to be different, because income and consumption poverty are 
relatively greater concerns in urban areas, while unme t basic needs are more pressing in ru ra l areas. A f te r 
focusing predominantly on rural poverty during the previous CAS, the Bank w i l l begin to take up urban 
poverty issues in an urban poverty reduction project under the new CAS. 
95. 
The depth of rural poverty will continue to motivate intensive Bank support for rural poverty 
alleviation. Agriculture accounts fo r 11 percent o f GDP, continues to be one o f the key export earners fo r 
Ecuador, and i s the primary source o f income fo r Ecuador’s (40 percent) ru ra l population.’ Yet i t i s 
characterized by challenges a l l along the production chain, f rom fragmented land, irregular land titling, 
and frustrated land reform, workers w i th limited opportunities fo r developing their s k i l l s or education, 
l im i ted irrigation and poor watershed management, distorted input markets, l ow productivity, limited 
diversification, high vulnerability t o natural disasters, insufficient quality control, weak postharvest 
conservation practices, severe limitations in marketing and market access, and volatile commodity prices. 
There has also been l i t t le attention to rural nonfarm production. The Bank i s recommending a “rural

space” development approach in i t s ongoing ru ra l development study, which i s a precursor to a future 
ru ra l productivity and sustainable development operation t o address constraints along the entire chain. 
This assistance addresses a key p r io r i ty identified in the CAS consultations (Annex E) and builds on the 
positive results achieved in the Agricultural Research and Agricultural Census projects to promote 
increased knowledge in the agricultural sector. The new loan would be complemented by assistance to 
ru ra l indigenous and A f ro communities via the proposed follow-on t o Prodepine and the ongoing rural 
poverty-alleviation project, Prolocal, both o f which w i l l also continue to provide support for rural finance 
through components that are cofinanced respectively by IFAD and the European Union. 
I n broadening access to resources, it w i l l be important to ensure that natural resources are also 
96. 
conserved for future generations. There are important linkages between poverty and environmental 
degradation. First, rural poverty can lead to exploitation o f increasingly unsuitable lands, leading t o 
accelerated deforestation or conversion o f highland pcirumo, which act as catchment areas fo r water. 
Similarly, inadequate attention to brown and green environmental issues can cause increased infectious 
respiratory diseases, water-borne illnesses, and vector-borne diseases. The Bank w i l l continue to play an 
important role in overseeing GEF-funded projects, particularly when the large Biodiversity I1 Grant fo r 
the National Protected Areas System becomes effective this year, and to t h i s end i t w i l l prepare a GEF 
country strategy w i t h the Government. The strategy could include future GEF support fo r planning 
related t o climate change. In addition, the Bank proposes t o undertake an environmental review as a 
precursor to a Natural Resources Management operation in the later stages o f the CAS program. 

Strengthen ing Governance t o Ensure Accountable, E f f ic ien t , and Accessible Pub l ic Services

A just and efficient economic and social program needs to be founded on good governance. 
Detailed surveys indicate that the issue o f corruption i s o f considerable concern t o Ecuadorian citizens 
and affects their daily lives. Corruption i s shown in cross-country studies t o be associated w i th worse 
rather than better service, to impact the poor disproportionately in the allocation o f public resources, and 
t o increase public disaffection w i t h the polity. As Ecuador went through i t s severe crises between 
1997/98 and 2000/01, the trend o f most measures o f governance was toward worsening performance, 
including o f such indicators as accountability, po l i t ica l stability, government efficacy, regulatory 
capacity, rule o f law, and control o f corruption. Wh i le i t i s l ike ly that new evidence w i l l point to a halt in 
the downward trend since 2000, the Government has made improving governance and reducing 
corruption one o f i t s key priorities. 
98. 
T o achieve these goals, i t i s essential that the Government take the lead in improving governance. 
T o do so, the Government w i l l need to identify the institutional strengths and weaknesses o f the public 
sector. This w i l l allow i t t o isolate the underlying causes fo r inadequacies in public services and the 
prevalence o f corruption, and enable i t to develop a program w i t h monitorable indicators t o address these 
issues. This w i l l require considerable political leadership and long-term commitment t o mobilize broad 
support fo r specific reforms, such as introducing performance standards fo r public services, reforming 
public procurement and financial management practices, increasing accountability and transparency in 
public resource allocations, pursuing c i v i l service reforms, and on one hand improving legal protection 
for public officials who attempt t o enforce laws and regulations while on the other hand pursuing cases o f 
gross negligence or bad faith in public service. 
99. 
Improvements in governance are a key area for Bank Group support, because they are 
fundamental to achieving sustainable growth and poverty reduction. The Bank Group w i l l bring a 
series o f ins trumen ts to bear in t h i s area in a coordinated manner. These include a Public Expenditure 
Review, which w i l l be conducted jo in t ly w i th the IDB; the Bank’s f i r s t Institutional and Governance 
Review (IGR) fo r Ecuador; an investment climate assessment; a procurement review (CPAR) and a 
financial assessment (CFAA), wh ich the Bank’s financial management team plans to launch as early as 
FY04, in collaboration w i th the IDB and IMF. In order t o ensure synergies, these AAA instruments w i l l 

32 

be carefully sequenced, and w i l l be coordinated w i th WB I capacity-building and diagnostic wo rk 
designed t o help Government assess the institutional strengths and weaknesses, and improve the quality 
of public services. In addition, the Bank w i l l promote increased transparency and accountability through 
a range o f proposed loan operations, whether sector-specific such as ru ra l water supply (Praguas) or 
electricity and telecommunications (Promec), or overarching loans, such as the Public Financial 
Management Loan approved by the Board in 2002 to consolidate and extend SIGEF, and a proposed 
Institutional Re fo rm Loan, which would be designed using AAA and W B I inputs described above, and 
the program o f adjustment loans and proposed support fo r jud ic ia l reform. These planned activities also 
build on earlier work by the Bank, including diagnostic and capacity-building work on corruption b y the 
WB I during 1999-2001, and the State Modernization Project (MOSTA, L.3822-EC, closed Ma rch 2001), 
which among other activities helped Government begin to develop and r o l l out SIGEF. 
100. Awareness has grown in the legal and jud ic ia l community about the need for an effective, 
efficient, and transparent legal and jud ic ia l system. There i s also greater demand fo r such a system 
f r om the general public, and the Government continues to make legal and jud ic ia l re fo rm a priority. 
Some o f the ma in challenges include access t o justice fo r the poor, delays in dispute resolution, and the 
perception o f a lack o f transparency. The Chief Justice, through the Supreme Court and the Judicial 
Council, i s leading an effort to develop a comprehensive plan reflecting specific priorities and sequencing 
w i t h stakeholders and a program t o scale up successful p i lo t projects. In this context, efforts should be 
made t o (a) strengthen the legal framework supporting jud ic ia l independence; (b) develop a 
comprehensive plan to improve legal and jud ic ia l training o f judges, lawyers, and court clerks; (c) 
introduce legal, regulatory, and institutional reforms to combat corruption; (d) improve access to justice, 
notably fo r women and for poorer Ecuadorians, through further institutional and legal reform; and (e) 
encourage public participation in future re fo rm efforts. The process o f legal and jud ic ia l re fo rm i s long 
term. The Bank began i t s support fo r t h i s area in Ecuador in 1996 w i t h a f i r s t Judicial Reform Loan that 
computerized, restructured and greatly increased the efficiency o f one-fifth o f Ecuador’s c i v i l and penal 
courts o f f i r s t instance, as we l l as promoting mediation as an alternative t o jud ic ia l settlements, and access 
t o justice fo r the poor and fo r women. The 2003 jud ic ia l sector review and planned second jud ic ia l 
re fo rm loan build on the earlier wo rk t o address the issues indicated above. 
Finally, the Bank undertook a decentralization study in F Y O O that formed the basis for dialogue 
w i t h the previous Administration on t h i s topic. Decentralization i s a po l i t ica l ly sensitive i s s u e and 
progress i s difficult, because Ecuador has multiple layers o f government and has yet to establish transfer 
principles embodying clear responsibilities and appropriate incentives. The new Administration i s 
evaluating po l icy options, and the Bank w i l l take up the dialogue again, updating i t s AAA in this CAS 
period through a fiscal decentralization and debt management study, which w i l l in fo rm bo th the proposed 
adjustment loans and the dialogue w i t h the Government and the general public, in coordination w i t h other 
donors such as the German Technical Cooperation (GTZ) and the USAID.

D. Lend ing Scenarios and Tr iggers 

102. 
The base case scenario o f the CAS w i l l have an envelope o f up to $1,050 m i l l i o n during FY04- 
07 w i t h an average o f four operations per year (Table 7), as we l l as $100 m i l l i o n t h i s fiscal year t o 
provide immediate support to the new Administration’s stabilization and re fo rm program. The higher 
base case envelope relative t o past lending responds to improved performance by Ecuador, which has 
improved i t s fiscal balance wh i le increasing social expenditures, adopted fiscal responsibility legislation, 
and reduced debt-to-GDP ratios t o below 60 percent, w i th a further decline t o 40 percent projected over 
the next five years in the base case. Ecuador’s new Government has also demonstrated early on i t s 
readiness to implement unpopular measures i f needed to stabilize the economy and promote fiscal 
consolidation, which i t recognizes as essen t ia l fo r sustainable long-term growth. The planned CAS 
program enables the Bank to seize the current window o f opportunity, but carefully hedges against the 
important r i s k s by building up the relationship over time, and only i f CAS performance triggers are met.

Note *: Amounts associated w i th adjustment lending become available only i f prior actions 
to the programmed operations are met. 

103. Under the base case, adjustment lending would be limited to $100 m i l l i o n per year, a l l through 
single-tranche loans based on fulfillment o f actions p r io r to Board presentation. The Bank envisions a 
self-regulating mechanism fo r adjustment loans, insofar as the lending envelope i s reduced i f the p r io r 
actions for the loans are not met. The adjustment loans would support re fo rm programs designed t o 
ensure fiscal consolidation, promote competitiveness, and improve the quality and efficacy o f social 
expenditures. Investment lending would be 50 percent or more o f new Bank lending, and would increase 
f rom a base o f $100 m i l l i o n by $50 m i l l i o n per year until FY06, and remain constant in FY07, which 
coincides w i th the next general election. 
104. Under a h igh case scenario, the ceiling fo r new Bank lending could increase by up to $50 m i l l i o n 
per year. The Bank envisions two circumstances in which Ecuador might move t o a h igh case scenario, 
involving heightened performance in structural programs in bo th cases, but different states o f the world. 
In the f i r s t case, severe adverse external shocks coupled w i t h strong efforts to implement reforms could 
justify expanded Bank support fo r Ecuador, in light o f the country’s l im i ted access to private capital 
markets. In the second case, w i t h a more benign external environment and accelerated structural reforms, 
including improvements in governance and financial management, the lending envelope could be 
increased and a greater share could be provided through adjustment loans t o support the general budget, 
although t h i s share would never exceed 50 percent o f the envelope. B o t h o f these circumstances are more 
l ike ly to ar ise in the later rather than the earlier years o f the CAS period. 
105. Under a low case scenario, there would be no new adjustment lending and the number and value 
o f investment loans would be reduced and focused on direct poverty alleviation, so that lending would no t 
exceed 50 percent o f the base case lending scenario in the l ow case. In the event o f a l ow case scenario 
brought on by major and severe exogenous shocks in wh ich the economic re fo rm program becomes 
clearly unviable, irrespective o f the Government’s w i l l to enact reforms, Bank Management would seek 
the Board’s guidance through a CAS Progress Report. The triggers fo r the various lending scenarios are 
presented in Table 8.

E. Partnersh ips and Selectivity 

106. 
The Bank’s assistance program i s designed to address essential reforms required under 
dollarization and to respond to priorities expressed by Government and civil society. The Bank‘s 

p rog ram envisions t w o complementary sets o f adjustment loans. The f isca l and competitiveness series 
addresses the fundamental issue o f conso l ida t ing Ecuador’s f isca l pos i t ion and remov ing imped imen ts t o 
ensure that Ecuador can compete e f fec t ive ly under do l la r iza t ion and in the context o f a fo r thcom ing 
Ame r ican Free Trade Area. The programmatic soc ia l series addresses the fundamental issues o f ensur ing 
that the essential structural reforms are soc ia l ly sustainable, b y suppor t ing improvemen ts in the 
effectiveness and coverage o f key social programs. The investment lend ing po r t fo l io responds t o key 
p r io r i t ies repeatedly expressed in consultation processes, thereby increasing loca l ownersh ip o f pro jec ts 
considerably, f o r example, suppor t ing education, health, competitiveness, p roduc t iv i ty o f agriculture, and 
v iab le non fa rm r u r a l activities, and f inanc ia l services f o r the poor . The design o f Bank pro jec ts has also 
changed in response t o c i v i l society recommendations, w i t h considerably greater loca l pa r t ic ipa t ion in the 
design and a l loca t ion o f subproject resources (as in the Prodepine, Prolocal, Praguas, and Promec 
projects-see Annex C-and 
the fo r thcom ing r u r a l roads project). The AAA p ipe l ine i s ca re fu l ly 
sequenced and closely t ied t o the lend ing program, cove r ing core Bank studies, sectoral rev iews that pave 

35 

Implementation of 

the Bank’s program requires close coordination with strategic partners, 

the way fo r better-designed lending (for example, education, rural development, environment, and 
financial services), and studies that address specific constraints and needs identified by Government and 
that are expected to have a major impact, such as hydrocarbons, labor markets, health insurance, and an 
institutional and governance review. The planned W B I program supports the Bank’s efforts to build 
capacity in key governance and social areas. The I FC and MIGA support w i l l strengthen the 
competitiveness o f private sector partners. The overall Bank Group assistance program i s focused on 
areas in which the Bank Group has historically counted on considerable in-house expertise. 
107. 
In the event o f a significant deterioration in economic conditions, the Bank would restructure i t s 
investment po r t fo l io toward poverty reduction by, fo r example, refocusing and bringing forward the 
proposed health project and the proposed ru ra l production project, while emphasizing the urban poverty- 
reduction project. Similarly, on the AAA side, the Bank would l ike ly advance the nu t r i t ion review and 
ensure that timely poverty monitoring information i s available. 
108. 
including the CAF, IDB, IMF, the Un i ted Nations system, and bilateral donors. The Government’s 
economic re fo rm program establishes an overall framework o f macroeconomic targets and policy reforms 
that has received IMF support through a $205 million-equivalent, 13-month Stand-B y Arrangement 
approved on Ma rch 21, 2003. Provided performance i s solid under the program, i t i s expected that the 
IMF w i l l continue i t s technical and financial support to Ecuador beyond the current Arrangement. 
109. 
The des ign o f the Bank‘s assistance program builds on the Fund Arrangement and recognizes 
several areas in which other donors have a comparative advantage and/or are providing important ongoing 
assistance. Fo r example, the C A F has a record o f significant investment in major infrastructure in 
Ecuador and, jo in t ly w i th the IDB, i s promoting interconnectivity o f transport, electricity, and other 
networks among Andean nations, and taking the lead on natural disaster management. The IDB has taken 
the lead on the issue o f reforming public banks, ru ra l finance, defining property rights, and the social 
investment fund. The IDB and the Bank are presently developing mutually reinforcing programmatic 
loans in the social areas, in which both institutions have played leading roles. The United Nations 
Children’s Fund (UNICEF) has played a major role in monitoring social expenditures and in working 
toward a fiscal contract w i th in c i v i l society (pacto social y f i s c a l ) . The G T Z and USAID are playing key 
roles in advancing municipal development in the context o f decentralization. Similarly, while there are 
important issues related to border development, particularly on the northern border w i t h Colombia, 
bilateral donors are providing community-level grant funding to address needs in these areas. On the 
other hand, the Bank i s l ike ly to continue p lay ing a leading role in financial sector development (w i th a 
focus on strengthening the banking sector), institutional reforms in the public sector, human development 
(in particular at t h i s time in the health sector), and ru ra l poverty reduction. I t i s no t expected to finance 
large-scale infrastructure operations. 
1 10. 
The Ecuadorian Ins t i tu te fo r International 
Cooperation (INECI), in the M in is t ry o f External A f fa i rs has joined the M in is t ry o f Finance in playing an 
important role in promoting coordination among donors. The Bank O f f ice in Ecuador has actively 
supported these initiatives by, fo r example, chairing the donor coordination group on reducing extreme 
poverty and promoting the interchange o f information structured along CDF lines on planned donor 
assistance fo r the next four years (see Annex G fo r areas o f emphasis o f each donor). Moreover, there i s 
strong collaboration among the multilateral agencies (CAF, IDB, W, and t h e W o r l d Bank) at the local 
level to present a coordinated position on several policy issues . The Bank, CAF, the IDB, and UNDP are 
also coordinating to improve multilateral responses and prevention activities related t o natural disasters. 
The IDB, which i s historically Ecuador’s largest creditor, and the Bank have identified very similar 
priorities fo r the next four years as part o f their respective country strategies, and are coordinating closely 
across a range o f issues , beginning w i th a j o i n t Public Expenditure Review. The IDB program i s 
highlighted in Box 7.

t ry ing t o secure these conditions, the previous and current Administrations decided to cancel the two 
floating tranches. 
The introduction o f a competitive process fo r filling key positions in project implementation units 
(PIUS)--involving an independent entity in prescreening candidates-has 
strengthened the quality and 
continuity o f staffing in the PIUs, insulated them f rom the consequences o f frequent changes at the 
ministerial level in different M i n i s t r i e s , and avoided s t o p g o cycles in project implementation that were 
affecting performance. Wh i le the process met occasional resistance f rom new political appointees, i t 
enjoyed strong support f rom the Office o f the President during the previous Administration. The Bank 
has shared this experience w i t h the new Administration and built i t in to the CAS triggers, and have 
received expressions o f support fo r this process f rom the O f f ice o f the President and f rom the M in is t ry o f 
Economy and Finance. 
Availability of counterpart funds has been an important recurrent issue with several projects. 
The Bank has proposed an agreement w i th the new Administration to monitor the availability o f 
counterpart funding on a quarterly basis. This i s being built in to the CAS triggers fo r the base case 
scenario, as adequate counterpart funding gains particular importance to the extent that the new Fiscal 
Responsibility L aw precludes state borrowing fo r noninvestment expenditures, which would include PIU 
operating expenditures. 
115. 
Finally, the CPPR process has strengthened with the inclusion of 
insights from the Bank’s 
Indigenous and Afro-Ecuadorian People’s Advisory Council in portfolio reviews. Representatives f rom 
the indigenous movement provided valuable suggestions to project coordinators on how to ensure greater 
outreach, bridge language and cultural barriers, and build on loca l social capital. A clear example o f this 
was the inclusion o f indigenous enumerators in the Agricultural Census project. Moreover, the Wo r ld 
Bank O f f ice in Quito has encouraged greater coordination among project units responsible fo r different 
projects in the po r t fo l io to achieve synergies across sectors. 

B. Fiduciary Responsibilities: Procurement and Financial Management 

116. 

The Bank conducted a procurement review (CPAR) in April 2000, which identified various 
risks in public procurement. K e y factors identified as possibly affecting project performance were the 
lack o f effective tools fo r procurement planning and monitoring during project implementation, the lack 
o f sk i l led and capable agency staff for management o f procurement functions, and the lack o f national 
standard bidding documents fo r the procurement o f goods and works and the selection o f consultants. As 
a result, the overall procurement risk assessment o f the Ecuador po r t fo l io was rated high in the April 2000 
CPAR. The Bank attempted t o mitigate t h i s risk fo r Bank projects b y organizing procurement training 
sessions fo r a l l project procurement staff, the most recent o f which was held in June 2002. In practice, 
procurement procedures under Bank projects have been closely supervised and generally found to be 
satisfactory. Nevertheless, the Government and the Bank have discussed improving procurement 
implementation as we l l as the possible preparation o f a new procurement law, to be followed by sound 
implementing r u l e s and regulations, w i th a view to (a) streamlining current procedures fo r the 
procurement o f goods and works; (b) incorporating revised consultancy standards; (c) adopting national 
standardized bidding documents fo r procurement by a l l public agencies; (d) introducing electronic 
technologies in public procurement; and (e) establishing a national regulatory body t o strengthen 
oversight, ensure proper enforcement o f the procurement law, and increase transparency and efficiency in 
the public contracting system. The Government has demonstrated i t s interest in advancing in t h i s area, 
particularly w i th Internet-based procurement and disclosures as part o f an e-government system. 
The Bank has implemented a risk-based approach to monitoring and evaluation of f inanc ia l 
management capacity at the project level. This involves assessment o f new projects; reviews o f audit 
reports, statements o f expenditure, and f l ow o f funds; assistance w i t h the implementation o f new 
Financial Mon i to r ing Reports; and general ongoing financial management supervision. The presence o f a 

117.

financial management consultant in the F ie ld Office has contributed to closer follow-up o f corrective 
actions where needed, and technical advice fo r P I U staff. In addition, the Bank has supported generalized 
training on disbursements and financial management fo r P I U finance directors and related staff. Overall 
findings are that most PIUs are adequately staffed by experienced professionals and that financial 
management arrangements meet minimum Bank requirements, including Accounting and Financial 
Reporting arrangements. The ro l lou t o f the Government's SIGEF w i l l need to be closely monitored, 
since only two projects are currently integrated into the system, and i t w i l l be important t o ensure that the 
project internal control environment i s not compromised in the transition t o SIGEF. On the other hand, 
once i t i s ro l led out, the integrated system, supported by a new Public Finances Control L aw approved in 
2001, 
i s l ike ly to increase transparency in accounting, treasury, and budgeting throughout the 
government. 
118. 
There has been particularly close follow-up over the past year on project audits. During FY02, 
most projects submitted delayed audit reports, w i th delays attributed to lack o f coordination between the 
projects and the Controller General o f the State (CGE), procedural delays in contracting auditors, and in 
the review o f f ina l audit reports by the CGE (prior to delivery t o the Bank). Corrective measures have 
been taken v ia a general meeting o f a l l P I U Directors and the CGE as part o f a po r t fo l io review w i t h the 
incoming Administration, to begin the contracting o f auditors in a timely manner. Moreover, early this 
year the Bank conducted a P i lo t Capacity Assessment o f Private Audit Firms in Ecuador. The assessment 
revealed that the institutional capacity, audit methodology, and engagement practices o f fm are uneven, 
when benchmarked against international auditing standards. As a resu l t o f the assessment, 
recommendations were made t o the CGE prior t o the launching o f the annual audits on criteria fo r 
accepting firms to audit Bank-financed projects. I t i s therefore expected that the risk t o Bank funds posed 
by uneven quality o f audits w i l l be reduced. In practice, 80 percent o f projects received unqualified 
opinions on the financial statements and 86 percent on the Special Account. Qualifications were due t o 
use o f funds to cover local taxes and counterpart funds, or to inadequate supporting documentation. 
Statement o f Expenditure (SOE) reviews (performed by external auditors and by Bank staff during SOE 
processing and supervision missions) revealed modest ineligible expenses in three projects. This i s , 
however, not considered a systemic risk. 

C. Country Program Mon itor ing and Evaluation 

119. 
The Bank will monitor the country program in this CAS through a set of benchmark 
indicators. The benchmark indicators fo r this CAS include the outcome indicators identified b y 
govemment fo r i t s economic program (Section 111, Table 2) together w i t h intermediary benchmark 
indicators that the Bank intends t o monitor in relation to specific Bank assistance. Annex B 9 provides a 
complete l i s t o f the output and intermediate indicators, and Table 10 highlights the c r i t ica l indicators fo r 
assessing the performance o f the program. In addition, the Bank w i l l monitor input indicators related to 
i t s portfolio on a regular basis, and w i t h Government as part o f the CPPR process. These input indicators 
are included in Annex B2, and key performance indicators fo r Bank inputs are highlighted in Table 10. 
120. 
The monitoring and evaluation o f progress under the CAS w i l l encompass a review o f the status 
o f outcome and intermediate benchmark indicators on a regular basis w i t h the country team as part o f 
po r t fo l io management, and on an annual basis w i th the Government and w i th strategic partners and 
stakeholders in c i v i l society. The annual reviews o f the outcome and intermediate benchmark indicators 
w i t h the Government w i l l be closely l inked to the larger o f two annual Country Po r t fo l io Performance 
Reviews, which the Bank's Ecuador team conducts w i th Government and w i t h the Indigenous and A f ro - 
Ecuadorian People's Advisory Council. In addition, the Bank w i l l review the CAS strategy and the status 
o f the CAS triggers as an integral part o f i t s annual programming missions w i th govemment. Annual 
reviews o f benchmark indicators w i th strategic partners and w i th stakeholders w i l l be built in to the 
Bank's regular consultation processes w i t h these partners and w i th c i v i l society.

D. Exposure and R i s k s 

121. Despite the expanded lending program, it i s expected that both debt service to the Bank and 
overall public debt service w i l l decrease during the next four years. The 2002 F isca l Respons ib i l i ty L a w 
establishes a ce i l ing o f 3.5 percent in rea l g row th in pub l ic expenditures, and a requirement that the ra t io 
o f pub l ic debt t o GDP be reduced b y fou r percentage po in ts per year until i t reaches 4 0 percent. 
Ecuador’s to ta l pub l ic debt t o GDP f e l l sharply f r o m 98 percent t o 58 percent be tween 1999 and 2002, 
and i s pro jec ted t o reach 40 percent o r be low over the nex t fou r years, wh i le ex terna l pub l ic debt t o GDP 
f e l l f r om 83 percent t o 46 percent between 1999 and 2002, and i s pro jec ted t o dec l ine t o 3 0 percent over 
this CAS pe r iod (Annex B7). Within pub l ic external debt, the p ropo r t ion that i s pre ferred cred i tor debt 
increased in August 2000 f r o m 3 0 percent t o 38 percent as Ecuador successfully negotiated a 40-percent 
reduc t ion in the p r inc ipa l outstanding o n i t s pr iva te cred i tor debt. I t i s expected that Ecuador’s access t o 
pr iva te cap i ta l markets w i l l rema in constrained over the C A S period, and that the p ropo r t ion o f pre ferred 
cred i tor debt service t o to ta l pub l ic debt service cou ld increase f r o m around one- th ird t o close t o one-half 
before Ecuador resumes p r inc ipa l repayments in 2006 o n the G loba l Bonds issued in the 2000 p r iva te 
debt reduction. Ecuador’s large share o f mu l t i la te ra l (38 percent) and b i la te ra l creditors (20 percent) 
makes i t less vulnerable t o a short-term, debt-led crisis. Nevertheless, Ecuador’s debt s i tua t ion ca l ls f o r 
continuous mon i tor ing . 
122. 
The W o r l d B a n k accounted f o r 2 1 percent o f pre ferred cred i tor debt as o f December 2002, and 
this p ropo r t ion i s expected t o rema in more o r less constant as the CAF (26 percent) implements a $ 2 
b i l l i o n p rog ram over the nex t fou r years, wh i le the IDB (50 percent) cur ta i ls i t s g row th in lend ing t o $600 
m i l l i o n over the same per iod . Deb t service t o the Bank as a p ropo r t ion o f to ta l pub l ic debt service has 
decreased f r o m 10.8 percent t o 8.6 percent since 2000, as the Government has made ne t payments t o the 
Bank exceeding $250 m i l l i o n over the past f i v e years, serv ic ing i t s debt t o the Bank no tw i ths tand ing i t s 
cha l leng ing f inanc ia l circumstances and d i f f icu l t ies ma in ta in ing t ime ly payments t o a number o f other 
creditors. 
123. Even w i t h an expanded pipeline, debt service t o the B a n k as a p ropo r t ion o f to ta l pub l ic debt 
service i s pro jec ted t o con t inue decreasing over the C A S pe r iod t o around 7 percent, w h i l e debt service t o 
the Bank as a share o f exports o f goods and services i s expected t o ha lve f r o m 2.2 percent in 2000 t o 1.1 
percent b y the end o f t h i s C A S pe r iod in 2007. The Bank ’s assistance p rog ram aims at p romo t ing 
conditions f o r sustained high grow th , wh ich in turn shou ld y i e l d an imp roved debt situation. As noted, 
w i t h successful imp lemen ta t ion o f the economic p rog ram and sustained do l lar iza t ion , the B a n k expects 

40 

real economic growth averaging 4 percent, w i th single-digit inflation rates slowly converging to 
international levels over the CAS period. O n the other hand, t h i s scenario i s subject t o bo th external and 
internal r i s k s . 
124. Ecuador i s vulnerable to significant external shocks. The country i s subject t o major r i s k s o f 
adverse terms-of-trade shocks-especially fo r o i l and bananas-and 
o f competitive pressures f rom 
neighboring countries that can depreciate their currencies. These r i s k s are particularly destabilizing in a 
dollarized economy such as Ecuador’s because they wou ld require a real effective exchange rate 
adjustment that could only happen through deflation o f domestic prices in nontradables, which in turn 
could imp ly a protracted recession, possible problems w i t h debt service in the public and nontradables 
sectors and potential impacts on the financial sector. Other r i s k s that are less l ike ly but could also have 
significant impacts include a substantial decline in remittance flows, which are currently the second- 
largest source o f external finance after oil; a sharp rise in global in teres t rates, which could increase the 
cost o f debt service; depressed exports due to a global economic downturn; or major natural disasters. 
125. Ecuador also faces important internal r isks . The major source o f internal r i s k s are po l i t ica l 
resistance to the fiscal and structural re fo rm program f r om indigenous, labor, and social movements, 
including f rom public servan ts , that could translate in to unsustainably h igh budget expenditures and wage 
concessions; and lack o f Congressional support fo r the Administration’s re fo rm p rog ram -spec ia l ly in 
l igh t o f the perennial problem o f regional differences on policy issues-resulting 
in blockage o f key 
legislative reforms. Other important internal r i s k s are potential pressures f rom the entrepreneurial sector 
fo r an “easy way out” through protectionism or even abandonment o f the U .S . dollar; diminished state 
revenues and limited debt reduction due t o continued underinvestment in hydrocarbons; or conversely, 
higher o i l revenues that encourage Ecuadorians t o postpone efforts to contain public expenditures and 
make them more flexible; public frustration over the debt burden, leading t o unilateral postponements o f 
repayments t o pay the “social debt” o f historically underfunded social expenditures; continued inab i l i ty to 
address governance challenges; and constraints in public sector implementation capacity. 
These risks w i l l be mitigated but cannot be fully eliminated. However, they w i l l be addressed 
through a ser ies o f actions: political and social risks w i l l be mitigated through the National Dialogue 
process, together w i th active engagement and dialogue w i t h a broad range o f Ecuadorian society by the 
Bank jo in t ly w i th other multilateral and bilateral donor agencies. I t w i l l be especially important to raise 
broad awareness o f the difference between short-term stabilization measures which frequently impact the 
poor through price increases, and structural reforms, wh ich are essential to meet the clear demands o f 
Ecuadorian citizens fo r better access to services, and wh ich i f postponed resu l t in worsening economic 
conditions and the need fo r stabilization measures. Moreover, governance and capacity w i l l be 
strengthened through a range o f lending and non-lending assistance designed to promote increased public 
sector efficiency, transparency and accountability. T o mitigate economic and f inanc ia l risks, the Bank 
w i l l assist the Government in encouraging competitiveness and diversification o f exports, improving the 
environment fo r FDI, promoting more efficient labor and financial markets, monitoring o f financial sector 
l iqu id i ty and exposures, maintaining a fiscal program that reduces the debt burden, increasing the share o f 
non-oil fiscal revenues in the budget, ensuring that higher o i l revenues are managed effectively through 
the fiscal stabilization fund, and developing more responsive and better-targeted safety nets fo r those 
most affected by shocks and economic downturns. Finally, to mitigate debt overburdening and Bank 
exposure risks, the Bank would closely coordinate i t s lending program w i t h other multilaterals t o trigger 
important increases in international assistance w i t h the successful implementation o f the Government’s 
economic program, but also prompt adjustments in overall support i f the political w i l l fo r re fo rm falters. 
Even i f the l ow case scenario materializes, the Bank wou ld remain engaged in a dialogue and maintain 
selected operations to protect the most vulnerable groups, promote sustainable development, and reduce 
poverty.

VI. CONCLUDING REMARKS 

127. 

Three years after dollarization, Ecuador i s at an impor tan t junc tu re in wh ich i t can reap the 
benefits o f a monetary system tha t entails l o w rates o f in f la t ion and considerable p red ic tab i l i ty f o r longer- 
te rm p lann ing and investment, but wh ich at the same t ime requires even more urgen t ly the structural 
re forms that were needed but n o t imp lemen ted before do l la r iza t ion t o compensate f o r los t nom ina l 
exchange rate f lex ib i l i ty in responding t o adverse external shocks. Ecuador’ s prospects f o r s tab i l i ty and 
economic recovery are p rom is ing i f the economic re fo rm p rog ram i s implemented. However, i t s f isca l 
and external positions rema in vulnerable because o f r ig id i t ies in the economy in response t o po ten t ia l 
shocks. Moreover , Ecuadorians s t i l l need t o build the necessary consensus t o encourage more fo re ign 
d irec t investment, strengthen the f inanc ia l system, and create more f lex ib le labo r markets to better absorb 
shocks, reduce vo la t i l i ty , and ensure sustained growth. Therefore, wh i le the r i s k s re la ted t o the Ecuador 
p rog ram rema in s ign i f ican t even after measures are taken t o m i t iga te them, there are ma jo r bene f i ts 
associated w i t h Bank assistance t o Ecuador in the current s i tua t ion as the coun try endeavors t o imp lemen t 
economic reforms. Successful imp lemen ta t ion o f the r e f o rm p rog ram i s essential t o prevent deterioration 
o f social conditions and worsen ing poverty, and the Bank’s assistance in partnership w i t h other donors 
can p lay a c r i t ica l ro le in correc t ing macroeconomic imbalances, advancing o n structural re forms t o 
promo te more equitable and sustainable growth, and reor ien t ing social po l ic ies t o pro tec t and assist the 
poor. Thus, the economic r e f o rm p rog ram w i l l requ ire substantial comm i tmen t f r o m Ecuador’s 
population, together w i t h in terna t iona l support.

Annex D. The SAPR I Process 

The Structural Adjustment Participatory Review Initiative (SAPRI) i s a j o i n t project o f the Wo r ld Bank, 
governments, and a global network o f NGOs and c i v i l society organizations. Launched in 1996 and 
covering six countries (Bangladesh, Ecuador, Ghana, Hungary, Ma l i , and Uganda), the goals o f SAPRI 
are to improve the understanding o f the impact o f adjustment policies and t o seek ways o f incorporating 
the participation o f c i v i l society in policy formulation related to Bank operations.‘ 
In the case o f Ecuador, the Institute o f Ecology and Development o f Andean Communities 
(IEDECA) led the process o f coordinating c i v i l society representation and participation. The process 
began w i th a preparatory phase in 1996197 in which different sectors o f c i v i l society were invited to 
participate in seven regional and national fora across Ecuador, in which a total o f 330 delegates reviewed 
and debated experience w i t h structural adjustment in Ecuador. Fo rum participants systematized 
information on the impact o f adjustment policies, proposed alternatives, suggested themes for further 
research, and elected 40 delegates fo r a f i r s t National Fo rum in January 1999 that consolidated the 
regional proposals and elected members to a SAPRI National Steering Committee. Tw o national 
universities were selected to conduct research on themes related t o the impact o f financial liberalization 
on production and households consumption, the impact o f trade liberalization and labor deregulation on 
production and employment, and the social impact o f policies on subsidies. These studies were 
concluded in October 1999, ra t i f ied by SAPRI, and discussed in a Second National Fo rum in December 
2000. Finally, experiences f r om the s i x countries were brought together in a jo in t meeting w i t h President 
Wolfensohn in July 2002, where i t was decided that consultation w i t h SAPRI networks and w i th other 
c i v i l society representatives should continue at the country level, particularly in the formulation o f 
Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSPs) or Country Assistance Strategies, w i t h the agreement and 
participation o f the respective Governments. 
The process in Ecuador’s case has led to recommendations on substantive issues such as national 
development planning, fiscal management, incentives fo r production and employment generation, 
education, health, gender, culture and environment, c i v i l society participation, and f igh t ing corruption that 
are highly consonant w i th those described in Section 1I.D o f this CAS. On the other hand, and taking in to 
account that the consultations began in 1999, when the national debt exceeded GDP, there was a strong 
repudiation in Ecuador’s SAPR I dialogues o f the national debt and o f the need to service it. Moreover, 
there was a strong reaction against further development o f hydrocarbons, which was seen as damaging t o 
the environment fo r everyone, while the benefits o f o i l favored only a l im i ted segment o f society due t o 
corruption. The current thinking i s believed to have shifted more in favor o f cleaning up the 
hydrocarbons industry, bo th environmentally and in terms o f governance, and dedicating these resources 
to paying the social debt rather than the national debt. Important recommendations were also developed 
b y SAPR I w i th regard to process in addition to policy content, including: 
Establishing an efficient and effective methodology, including training and information, fo r ensuring 
community participation aimed at reaching appropriate consensus w i t h the participation o f 
representatives f rom a l l segments o f society. 
Proposing, approving, and implementing a “Law fo r C i v i l Dialogue, Participation and Control” that 
applies the above proposed methodologies, and that enforces i t s application on the part o f every 
single stratum o f public administration. This should be accompanied b y a Fiscal Accountability L a w 
to help control public finances, both at t h e national and regional levels. 
Establishing effective mechanisms envisioning regular submittal o f accountability reports t o be issued 
by a l l main officers o f the State and a l l publicly elected officials. 
Improving transparency f o r a l l information on matters o f public administration. 
Engaging potential “beneficiaries” in extended discussions before incurring public debt.

0 Asking multilateral en t i t ies to include “positive conditioning” requirements as part o f the credit 
agreements. 
Iden t i fy ing effective monitoring and social control mechanisms, educating the public on their 
coresponsibility in public actions and by acknowledging the interaction that should exist w i th the 
private sector. 
SAPRI’s achievements in Ecuador include the inclusion o f a far broader c i v i l society 
representation than i s common to most processes, where well-established foundations and organizations 
based in the capital city tend to have the biggest voice in participatory processes. SAPRI has reached out 
geographically and sectorally, including important representation f rom women, rural and indigenous 
groups, and the A f r o minority. The recognition and legitimacy brought to new social actors can clearly 
serve to strengthen national democratic processes. Key members o f the SAPRI network at the national 
level have included the Federation o f Chambers o f Small Industry, the Women’s Network o f Azuay 
province, the Organization o f Free Workers’ Unions, Northern Border Communities (representing Afro- 
Ecuadorians), the Confederation o f Indigenous Organizations o f the Ecuadorian Amazon ( C O N F E N M ) , 
Rural Social Security (Seguro Socia2 Cumps ino ) , Women’s Political Coordinator, the Federation o f 
Barrios (neighborhoods) o f Guayaquil, the Human Rights Commission, the Chamber o f A r t i s a n s , and 
professors o f faculties o f economics o f various universities. 
SAPR I has proposed that i t s members be partners in a policymaking dialogue rather than simply 
claimants under Bank- and Government-defined operations. In addition t o creating a space fo r dialogue 
on adjustment themes in a context in which economic literacy has at t imes been a constraint, SAPR I has 
encouraged research and analytical studies b y academic and c i v i l society organizations. The 
decentralized dialogues i t has undertaken and proposed could contribute importantly to strengthening 
ownership and governance in public reforms and modernization. 
The shortcomings o f the process have included limited participation b y the Government, 
especially b y high-ranking public officials, indicating shortcomings in Government commitment to the 
SAPRI exercise, although not necessarily to consultation processes. Greater participation by the private 
sector, including larger chambers, could strengthen the inclusiveness o f the process. Methodological 
weaknesses in the research reduced the value o f the academic studies as an input in to policy formulation 
(for example, the overall increase in poverty over the past two decades coincided w i th Fund-led re fo rm 
programs and was therefore largely attributed to them, without highlighting that there were important 
limitations in Ecuador’s implementation o f t h e Fund’s recommendations). Moreover, while the Bank i s 
highly committed t o working w i th c i v i l society to ensure successful design and implementation o f i t s 
projects, implementation o f the key recommendations b y SAPR I ultimately depends on the Government’s 
commitment. Nevertheless the Bank-together w i th Government officials-has maintained a regular 
dialogue w i t h S A P R I and other c i v i l society representatives in order to improve the quality and ownership 
o f Bank-supported projects, and ensure that the projects reach the intended beneficiaries.

Annex E. CA S Consultations w i th C i v i l Society and O th e r Stakeholders 

In order to root i t s new Country Assistance Strategy in the priorities expressed b y Ecuadorian c i v i l society 
and those o f the Government, the Wo r ld Bank undertook a consultation process fo r the CAS in nine cities 
across Ecuador between January 27 and February 7, 2003. The Bank team, supported by a moderator 
f rom the La t in American Faculty fo r Social Sciences (FLACSO), visited the Amazon, and the highland 
and coastal regions o f Ecuador in a 1,400-mile road trip to Puyo, Ambato, Guayaquil, Cuenca, Loja, 
Portoviejo, Esmeraldas, and Ibarra before returning to Quito (Figure E. 1). 

Figure E.l. The Bank Undertook CAS Consultations in Nine Cities Across Ecuador 

World Bank Map No. 32432. 

Approximately 300 people were 
invited t o participate in the consultations, 
including 
representatives o f national government ministries, the mayor o f the city and the p rov inc ia l prefect; local 
government leaders and mayors o f smaller neighboring towns; representatives o f chambers o f production, 
commerce, agriculture, small industry, fishery, tourism, and artisans; labor movements and unions; 
indigenous and Afro-Ecuadorian organizations; community organizations representing ru ra l inhabitants 
and low-income urban neighborhoods; academic and research institutions; women’s organizations and 
environmental organizations; local and international developmental NGOs; project beneficiaries; and the 
Catholic and Evangelical churches (Figure E.2). To extend the coverage o f the consultations, invitations 
were extended in each city not only to people f rom that c i ty but also t o people f r om neighboring towns 
and provinces. For example, in the central highlands c i ty o f Ambato in the province o f Tungurahua, 
invitations were also extended to people in neighboring Cotopaxi and Chimborazo provinces. Similarly, 
people f rom Nap0 and Morona Santiago were invited to Puyo in the Amazon province o f Pastaza. 
In each o f the meetings, the Bank team sought to establish a dialogue around three key questions: 
What i s the perception o f the economic and social situation in the country? 
What should Ecuador’s priorities be in l igh t o f this situation? 
How should the Wo r ld Bank help t o achieve these priorities?

A consistent methodology was followed to ensure comparability o f findings across cities. In 
particular, meetings began b y presenting a l l people present; establishing rules, objectives, and principles 
fo r the meetings; a presentation on the Wo r ld Bank and i t s work in Ecuador; questions and answers 
regarding the presentation; dialogue around the f i r s t question on the situation o f the country; dialogue 
around the second question o f national priorities; establishment o f a hierarchy among the priorities 
identified; recommendations for the Wo r ld Bank; and a follow-up discussion. In particular, the Bank 
committed itself to sending a resu l t of the findings to each and every person invited, to sharing the 
findings w i th the National Government, and t o using the findings o f the CAS consultation in the process 
o f designing the CAS. A l l the dialogues were recorded on tape, flip chart results were recorded, and 
notes were taken by the moderator and by the members o f the Bank team. Moreover, each member 
present was invited to share h i s or her views v ia any o f three modalities w i t h which he or she would feel 
most comfortable: in the general forum, in writing, or privately in a one-on-one side meeting w i th an 
identified member of the Wo r ld Bank. In designing the methodology, deciding on appropriate locations 
fo r the meetings, and identifying potential invitees, the Bank drew on the suggestions o f a group o f 15 
members o f c i v i l society who were inv i ted to a "consultation on the consultation process" in mid-January. 

Perceptions Regard ing the Econom ic and Social S ituat ion in Ecuado r 

I n response to the question of how the participants perceived the economic and social situation o f 
the country, and other (noneconomic or social) issues, the respondents noted the d i f f icu l ty o f isolating 
economic f rom social issues, and t h e same themes arose across the groupings o f issues. The top dozen 
results o f the consultation in each category are tabulated in Table E. 1. 

78 

The key economic issue was unemployment o r underemployment. This issue was c lose ly re la ted 
t o inadequate support f o r produc t ion b y microenterprises and r u r a l producers. Respondents underscored

Perceptions Rega rd ing P r io r i t ies fo r Ecuador 

As stated, improving education was by far the most impo r tan t p r i o r i t y f o r par t ic ipan ts in the 
consultations (Figure E.3). Educa t ion came f i r s t in seven o f the n ine cities, and was iden t i f ied as a 
p r i o r i t y in a l l nine. Moreover , education was seen as impor tan t in b o t h rural and urban areas as a way o f 
enab l ing the poo r t o earn a better l iv ing , and the on ly way t o enable Ecuador t o compete with other 
countries in an increasingly g loba l economy. Issues ra ised around education inc luded n o t on ly access t o 
education, but also imp rov ing the poo r qua l i ty o f education, and ensuring that teachers rece ive adequate 
pay and are proper ly trained. Second t o education was the need t o promote employment th rough 
microenterprises, and t h i s was complemented b y the need t o strengthen w o r k through strengthened 
commun i ty organizations and t o ensure adequate access t o resources, especially techn ica l t ra in ing and 
cred i t t o increase p roduc t iv i ty . Ano ther key p r i o r i t y was t o ensure that investments were undertaken in 
l i n e w i t h a v is ion expressed in a long - te rm development plan, developed f r o m the grassroots upwa rd and 
i n v o l v i n g considerable consensus building and par t ic ipa t ion . 
Improving health was also seen as 
fundamental f o r increasing well-being, and re la ted t o this was the need t o imp rove access to and the 
qua l i ty o f basic infrastructure, such as safe water, sanitation, and e lec tr ic i ty . Moreover , relieving the 
burden of 
the national debt through renegotiations o r debt-for-nature swaps o r deb t- for-soc ia l- 
expenditures swaps was w ide ly v iewed as impor tan t . F ina l ly , Jighting corruption, especially at the 
na t iona l level, was important, as was ensuring that more resources reach the grassroots th rough an 
equitable decentralization process and do no t go j u s t t o the big cities.

Figure E.3. The Top National Pr ior ity i s Improved Education 

Source: Alexandra Martinez: Resultados de la consulta del Banco Mundial 
sobre la nueva Estrategia de Asistencia a1 Ecuador, 27-01 a1 7-02 de 2003. 

In terms o f the coincidence o f priorities across the country, education and health were highlighted 
as key priorities in a l l nine cities, promotion o f microenterprises and o f access to ru ra l and micro credit 
were common to seven cities, as was the issue o f environmental protection, while participatory long-term 
development planning, capacity bu i ld ing fo r microenterprises, and strengthening o f loca l community 
organizations were common to six o f the nine cities. There were also issues that were more important in 
certain cities and areas than in others. For example, Esmeraldas (in the northwest, w i t h a h igh A f ro - 
Ecuadorian population) placed particular s tress on unemployment; Ibarra, Esmeraldas, and Puyo a l l 
included discussions o f concerns related to Plan Colombia and the security situation on the northern 
border; Ambato in the central highlands placed particular stress on participatory planning fo l low ing 
successful experiences at the local level; while Cuenca and Puyo, based on their comparative advantage, 
placed emphasis on developing tourism. Finally, wh i le bo th environmental and women’s organizations 
were invited, and a significant proportion o f the participants were women, interestingly there was a 
greater awareness o f environmental issues than o f gender issues, and the former received greater attention 
and discussion in the dialogues. Issues o f racism were more l ike ly to be expressed in terms o f the need to 
promote awareness o f cultural diversity. Such sensitive issues as domestic violence and prostitution did 
arise on occasion, but were not developed in detail in these forums. 

Perceptions Regarding Wo r ld Bank Support 

The recommendations regarding the W o r l d Bank f a l l in to three categories: areas in which i t 
should provide support; how i t should do so; and things i t should not do. The areas wh ich the W o r l d 
Bank should support clearly coincided w i th national priorities, including education; support fo r micro- 
and rural production and microfinance; fighting conuption; financing basic infrastructure; generating 
jobs; and protecting the environment through, fo r example, community projects fo r reforestation and 
training in natural resource management. The Bank was also invited to be a mediator w i t h the IMF, 
which was seen as insensitive in the formulation o f i t s conditionality. 
In terms o f i t s working procedures and approaches, the Bank was to ld that i t should ensure that 
resources reach the community leve l and are administered at that level, instead o f being lost t o central 
bureaucracy; should take a longer-term program approach and no t just a quick project approach; develop 

80 

better procedures fo r evaluating the impact o f i t s assistance; build i t s assistance on prior local 
experiences; and forgive loans or provide more nonreimbursable assistance. The Bank's policies on 
adjustment were criticized and associated w i th those o f the IME;, although two divergent positions 
developed on Bank involvement in national policies, w i th one view suggesting noninterference and 
another recommending that the Bank encourage national officials to re fo rm the way the economy 
operates. 
I t was recommended that the Bank not (a) support governments or bankers perceived as corrupt, 
(b) impose conditionality f rom outside, (c) develop projects f r om a desk in the city, (d) support the 
wealthy who oppress a large part o f the population, (e) lend without consideration fo r the capacity to 
repay, (0 get involved in what Ecuadorians themselves are supposed t o do, and (8) be slow in handing 
over resources. 

Conclusions 

The CAS consultation builds on a process o f engagement in dialogues w i t h c i v i l society, and i t s 
findings are being incorporated in to Bank operations and in Bank AA4, an increasing proportion o f 
which i s intended fo r knowledge sharing and public debate. On the lending side, the Bank has identified 
education, rural production, urban poverty reduction, financial services fo r the poor, and natural resources 
management as possible new projects that directly respond to needs identified by c i v i l society, together 
w i th jud ic ia l reform and institutional reform in order to promote increased transparency and efficiency in 
the public sector. In terms o f methodology, decentralized, community -level design and implementation i s 
being promoted through projects such as Prodepine, Prolocal, Praguas, and in the proposed rural roads 
project, and the Bank has taken note o f the need to ensure greater transparency regarding the application 
and impact o f i t s loans. Finally, on policy-based lending, the Bank took note o f the need to ensure that 
commitments under rapidly disbursing loans to the extent possible enjoy broad ownership and support 
among Ecuadorians, rather than be imposed f rom outside. 
The Bank team greatly valued the opportunity to hear opinions f rom various parts o f c i v i l society 
across the country, and participants in turn congratulated the Bank on t h i s initiative, expressed 
appreciation to the t e am fo r listening to their concerns and committing to reflect them in the development 
o f the CAS, and expressed the hope that i t would not be a one-time exchange o f views. See B o x E . l fo r 
the views o f c i v i l society in their own words.

Annex F. C l ien t S u r v e y - S umm a r y o f Findings 

A local polling company, CEDATOS, associated w i th the intemational po l l ing f i r m GALLUP, is 
conducting a client survey fo r the World Bank. The following interim report, based on one-quarter of the 
planned qualitative surveys, is transcribed verbatim. A f u l l report w i th qualitative and quantitative 
findings w i l l be prepared before the end of f isca l 2003 and w i l l be used to guide Bank lending and 
analytical assistance, outreach activities, and extemal relations activities in Ecuador. 

W i t h eleven interviews t o top-level executives in client and public opinion leading organizations 
in Quito and Guayaquil, completed until the release o f this report, some o f the ma in research findings are 
presented. 

THE STATE OF THE COUNTRY 

Fo r almost a l l the respondents the actual country economic situation i s critical, w i th many 
macroeconomic indicators that are o f concern no t only to the local authorities but also fo r the companies 
and international economic assistance organizations l ike the Wo r ld Bank. Poverty i s one o f the main 
issues that the country must attend, considering i t affects over 70 percent o f the total population. W i th in 
this important population group there i s a dramatic stratum o f homeless and extremely poor people who 
could be an important participant fo r po l i t ica l and social turmoil. Almost a l l the participants indicate that 
previous and actual social actions taken by the governments do not have a great outreach and are 
frequently focused on large urban populations where po l i t ica l and electoral resu l ts can be achieved by 
certain interested groups while small efforts are focused to smaller populations in ru ra l areas; huge 
concerns are also given in the same issue w i th regards to the northern border population, where poverty, 
lack o f assistance and security in very small sectors could be triggering factors fo r an i n i t i a l surge o f the 
Colombian subversive groups. 
I t i s also important t o note that many state-sponsored efforts, wh i le focused toward production 
and technical education areas, no t always achieve good results fo r the lack o f funding and the country’s 
economic restricted growth. Mos t important obstacles mentioned by the respondents and which account 
fo r the actual economic Ecuadorian crisis are lack o f low-cost financing fo r small productive activities, an 
inefficient banking system which i s the ma in channel fo r this fund allocation, the l ow performance o f the 
commercial sector, the difficulties inherent t o the U.S.-dollar-based monetary system, and the po l i t ica l 
issues which affect the country’s stability and the investment climate. 

SECTORS W H I C H NEED TO BE ATENDED 

In order to obtain an adequate economic change most o f the respondents consider important t o 
improve the production sectors, mainly those related to agroindustrial production. I t i s important fo r the 
country to improve the aggregate value o f i t s exports, which could be achieved b y implementing 
production systems that could process the loca l primary production (raw production) instead o f exporting 
i t directly to processing and production centers in developed countries. This wou ld mean establishing 
processing centers in the geographic areas where raw production i s concentrated; t h i s could in turn allow 
an increase in labor demand, which allows consumption to grow. The subsidies could s t i l l be needed in 
some cases, but should be considered as temporary investments dedicated to production areas that need 
economic resources in order t o achieve a higher production status. When these areas reach higher 
production and a good income generation, subsidies can be lowered until they are no longer needed. Fo r 
many respondents i t i s more a matter o f a good State administration and transparent economic po l icy 
des ign and implementation, rather than only allocating external funding fo r certain production areas. I t i s 
also a matter o f correctly allocating subsidies which nowadays are directed t o privileged sectors that 
bene f i t f rom them and obtain higher turnovers which are not reinvested in the country but instead go t o 
international private banking accounts fo r lack o f confidence in the local banking system.

Some interviewees think Ecuador i s a sma l l country w h i c h needs t o start wo rk ing o n imp rov ing 
i t s ex terna l sector b y means o f generating transparent and dependable fo re ign investment po l ic ies wh ich 
w i l l p rov ide investors f r om developed countries an adequate loca l economic c l ima te f o r the i r activities. 
They instead see Ecuador as a coun try where external f inanc ia l a id i s a lways directed t o attend a huge 
bureaucracy and pub l ic debt, w h i l e a sma l l part i s actually focused in development and produc t ion . 

POLITICAL ISSUES OF SLOW ECONOMIC GROWTH AND THE WORLD BANK 

Ecuador lacks a p o l i t i c a l ideology, which, in the end, means tha t every fou r years, after every 
pres iden t ia l election, the coun try changes i t s economic p lann ing directives, according t o the w inn ing 
candidate o r po l i t ica l group’s coun try adm in is tra t ion concepts and ideas. Thus there i s n o t an interest in a 
long - te rm p lann ing and pub l ic sector administrative conceptualization, issues f o r wh ich there i s l i t t l e 
ex terna l assistance f r o m fo re ign organizations. 
There i s a lack o f agreements between the produc t ion sectors and the government, there are n o 
shor t- term projects, there i s n o in te rna l savings cu l ture in the population, and the country’s image i s n o t 
w e l l promo ted abroad. 
M a i n issues in w h i c h the W o r l d Bank should assist Ecuador are those re la ted t o roads and 
communications, health, education, sanitation, tourism, and p roduc t ive household funding. 
M a n y respondents c i te the W o r l d Bank as an impor tan t ins t i tu t ion that focuses i t s e f for ts in 
assisting the governments t o attend the i r huge economic problems. The Bank‘s m a i n asset i s i t s funding 
capab i l i ty , capital, and nego t ia t ion capabilities. I t i s an ins t i tu t ion that has the f inanc ia l and technical 
means necessary t o acquire top- leve l professional personnel w i th w h i c h i t attends the countries’ 
necessities. In the op in ion o f some participants however, the Bank lacks good in fo rma t ion channels to le t 
the people know more about i t s ac t iv i t ies in the country, and i s perce ived b y many as a coun try debt- 
generating organization. I t i s , however, an impor tan t fac tor in the fight against pover ty in our country; f o r 
some i t i s a key actor f o r the coun try ’s development b y means o f p roduc t ive investment.

Annex H. Bank-IMF Relations, and Structural Reforms 
in the Letter of Intent with the IMF, 2003-04 

In Ma rch 2000, the IMF, Wo r ld Bank, the IDB, and the C A F developed a $2 b i l l i o n j o i n t program o f 
support fo r the Ecuadorian government. The I M F ’ s Stand-By Arrangement provided the overall 
macroeconomic framework, w i th coordinated support via policy-based and investment lending b y the 
IDB, the CAF, and the Wo r ld Bank. Coordination was close and productive. F o r example, in the 
financial sector a j o i n t policy matrix was developed fo r the four International Financial Institutions ( IF Is ) . 
In addition, coordination at the field level by the respective Resident Representatives has been strong. 
Mo re recently, in addition to regular exchanges, the Bank has invited IMF staff t o attend Ecuador Day, 
CAS consultations, Initiating Memorandum and Regional Operational Committee (ROC) Reviews o f 
Adjustment Loans, and Bankwide and ROC reviews o f the CAS. Bank staff have been invited to attend 
IMF Board discussions o f the Stand-By Arrangement. The Bank supports the direction o f the IMF Letter 
o f Intent, the Prior Actions, Structural Performance Criteria, and Benchmarks o f wh ich are presented 
below. The Bank w i l l be providing technical assistance to the government to address specific 
commitments w i t h the IMF, such as those related t o hydrocarbons and labor marke t reform. The agenda 
agreed in the Letter o f In ten t i s ambitious and l ike ly to encounter some slippage in time, but i s important 
fo r fiscal consolidation.

In i t s M a r c h 13, 2003 Supplemental Le t te r that the GOE subm i t ted t o the Fund, i t proposed the f o l l ow i n g 
three key changes t o i t s February 10th Le t te r o f In ten t (LOI). First, the 2003 budget, w h i l e respecting the 
p r ima ry and ove ra l l balances, was adjusted upward t o $42 mln, o r less than 1% o f to ta l revenues. 
Congress had also approved that education spending cou ld increase b y $165 mln, but on ly p rov ided the 
leve l o f non-interest spending in the budget rema in consistent w i t h the limit o f the F isca l L aw . Second, 
payment o f a l l non-reschedulable arrears t o the Paris Club, in agreement w i t h the Paris Club, was deferred 
by t w o weeks and therefore comp le ted f i v e wo rk ing days p r i o r t o the IMF B o a r d meeting, ra ther than the 
t w o weeks agreed in the LOI. Hence, the GOE requested that despite the delay, t h i s cond i t ion be 
considered met. And f ina l ly , the government requested an extension o f the t ime pe r iod t o a) complete the 
signing o f contracts w i t h companies t o manage the F i lanbanco l iqu ida t ion t r u s t funds and b) t o aud i t o f at 
least 8 closed banks in the Depos i t Guarantee Agency . In former case, delays were caused because the 
f i r m s interested in the trust funds needed mo re t ime t o conduct the ir o w n due d i l igence . In latter, the 
government had recently appointed new management t o the AGD and this had l e d t o delays in 
progressing as schedule.
