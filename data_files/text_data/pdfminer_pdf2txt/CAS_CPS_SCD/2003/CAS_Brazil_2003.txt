i 

Executive Summary 

i. B r a z i l has an unpara l le led po ten t ia l and a un ique oppor tun i ty today t o increase the we l l-be ing o f 
i t s people. This oppor tun i ty i s guided b y the country’s vision for a more equitable, sustainable, and 
competitive Brazil, as l a i d out in the recently published Mu l t iyea r P lan (PPA). At the same time, the 
coun try faces macroeconomic r i s k s , constraints to growth, social challenges, and env ironmen ta l vu lner- 
ab i l i t ies . I t i s in this context o f opportunities and risks that this four-year (FY2004-2007), j o i n t W o r l d 
Bank- In terna t iona l Finance Corpora t ion Coun try Assistance Strategy i s be ing presented.’ 

Opportunities, Risks, and the World Bank Group’s Role 

ii. B raz i l ’s new government i s comm i t ted to rea l iz ing the large po ten t ia l f o r we l fare improvements. 
B raz i l ’s vast income disparities ( i t s Gini coe f f ic ien t o f 0.59 i s among the wor ld ’s highest) and high debt 
burden (pub l ic debt to GDP ra t io o f 57 percent) ca l l fo r simultaneous actions on the economic and so- 
cial fronts. Examples o f the government’s first steps are a start to social security re form , un i f ica t ion and 
better targeting o f social programs, and con t inu ing f isca l adjustment. These re forms have the po ten t ia l to 
imp rove pub l ic finances and soc ia l inc lus ion simultaneously, establishing a v ir tuous c irc le . 

... 

111. 

Economic growth i s crucial for development but has been elusive. In v iew o f the economic and 
social context, growth must be generated with equity and sustainability-based on greater saving (na- 
t iona l savings are on ly 17 percent o f GDP) and h igher p roduc t iv i ty in resource use. Full savings come no t 
on ly f r om f isca l adjustment, but also f r om regulatory and m icroeconom ic reforms, expansion o f human 
capacity, and sustainable u s e and conservation o f na tura l wealth-including 
the wor ld ’s largest ra in fores t 
b iome and freshwater reservoir. With a stronger ro le fo r the excluded in human development and fo r 
sma l l and medium-size companies in the g row th process, p roduc t iv i ty gains can be strong and equitable. 

iv . 

The r o l e of the World Bank Group in this process wou ld be t o support v i t a l p o l i c y re forms and 
innovative, we l l -pe r fo rm ing investments, he lp ing to l i f t the we l fare o f Braz i l ians , pa r t icu la r ly the poorest. 
With a GDP o f around US$500 b i l l ion , B r a z i l i s the 9* largest economy in the wor ld ; the Banks lending 
i s on ly about 0.4 percent o f B raz i l ’s GDP and less than 4 percent o f ex terna l f inanc ing . Yet, the po ten t ia l 
impac t o f this support at this t ime can be disproportionately large. This impac t depends c ruc ia l ly how 
w e l l the approach i s focused, and how w e l l i t leverages other e f for ts fo r greater scale. 

v. 
W i t h this impac t in v iew , the new CAS in i t ia tes a results-based approach. The coun try ’s goals 
and p r io r i t ies are set out in the PPA and l inked to the M i l l e n n i um Deve lopmen t Goals (MDGs). The 
benchmarks fo r 2007 and 2015 relate to human welfare gains, social, cu l tu ra l and env ironmen ta l sustain- 
ab i l i ty , competitiveness, and macroeconomic performance, inc lud ing grow th . Spec i f ic Bank ac t iv i t ies 
wou ld contribute to ach iev ing these targets. There i s an accompanying f ramewo rk f o r mon i to r ing p ro - 
gress and results. 

vi. 

The ove r r id ing oppor tun i ty relates to the efforts to maintain economic stability with growth, 
equity, and sustainability. F o r example, pay ing a h igher p r ice fo r a gradual reduc t ion in indexed debt 
can help reduce risks and promo te investment f inanc ing and broad-based grow th . In teg ra t ing mu l t ip le 
cash transfers in to one u n i f i e d bene f i t can lead to a more e f f ic ien t , we l l- targe ted safety ne t w i t h lowe r 
f isca l cost and greater equ i ty . The CAS builds on a g row ing sense at the na t iona l and subnational leve l 
that development solutions requ ire integrated responses. 

T h e FY2004-07 CAS, following the federal and state electoral cycles, has been prepared in consultation with federal and state 
govemments, c iv i l society, the private sector, and the international community. I t i s based on the federal govemment’s Multiyear 
Plan (PPA), September 2003; the recently published “Policy Notes” by the Wor ld Bank; the Completion Report for the FY00-03 
CAS (Annex 2 ) ; the Operation Evaluations Department’s Country Assistance Evaluation (CAE); and Operations Evaluation 
Group’s Country Implementation Review (CIR).

A M o r e Equitable, Sustainable, and Compe t i t ive B r a z i l - Coun try Assistance Strategy FY2003-2007 

v i i . 

C o n f r o n t i n g risks to effective Bank assistance i s essential. W h i l e the Bank f u l l y supports 
B raz i l ’s amb i t ious f isca l adjustment program, the tight management o f pub l ic expenditures presents ma jo r 
operational challenges. Imp lemen ta t ion and disbursements o f investment loans have slowed, and the 
space f o r new investments i s extremely limited. B lend ing the need f o r greater impact, and wo rk ing w i t h i n 
the f isca l space, the proposed program reflects innova t ions in several respects. 

M a i n Dimensions o f the CAS 

v i i i . 

B raz i l ’s unique opportunities and risks challenge the Bank Group to pursue a more ambitious re- 
la t ionsh ip a imed at greater impact. The p rog ram has a systemic approach w i t h synergistic links to other 
programs-rather 
than a project-by-project, sectoral approach. Spec i f ica l ly this translates in to : 

0 Con t inued key ro le f o r policy-based lend ing and technical assistance (up to 50 percent o f the 
lending ceiling), to support systemic reforms. Examples f o r FY2004-2005 inc lude human devel- 
opment, g row th and competitiveness, sustainable development, and social secur i ty / f isca l re forms . 

0 Sectorwide approaches (SWAps) as an investment lend ing p la t fo rm to increase the systemic 
bene f i ts o f Bank support and m i t iga te the operational impacts o f f isca l austerity. Emerg ing exam- 
ples are in social assistance, you th employment, and housing. Correspondingly, freestanding, one- 
o f f investment pro jec ts wou ld be reduced o r phased out. 

0 An in tegra ted approach in support o f multisectoral, ru ra l and urban development strategies at the 
subnational level-respecting 
the constraints requ ired b y f isca l adjustment, inc lud ing : 

o Trans forma t ion o f the cooperation w i t h state governments in to integrated state strate- 
gies and projects, inc lud ing pub l ic expenditure and po l icy analysis. Examples f r o m 
FY2004 are integrated programs fo r Tocantins, Pernambuco, Maranhgo, and AmapB, 
cover ing b o t h the ru ra l space and urban centers. 

o A new emphasis on mun ic ipa l governments as key partners. Under consideration in the 
near term are operations f o r R i o de Janeiro and Be t im . 

0 A con t inued strong p rog ram in ana lyt ic and advisory activities (AAA) f o r a ca ta ly t ic ro le in re- 
f o rm and program design, wh i le focus ing on a more e f fec t ive exchange o f lessons (based on con- 
clusions o f the Coun t ry Assistance Eva lua t ion) and on the development o f know ledge networks, 
in close concert w i t h the W o r l d Bank Ins t i tu te and the G loba l Distance Lea rn ing Ne two rk . 

0 Reinforcement o f the comm itment to the Northeast and bu i ld ing a focus on the North-areas 
w i t h h igher levels o f poverty-with a concerted e f fo r t to strengthen ins t i tu t iona l capacity. 

0 Together w i t h IFC, strong, selective, and leveraged support to the p r iva te sector, cutt ing across 
sectors and regions. 
i x . 
There wou ld also be areas o f increasing and o f declining focus, o f entry and ex i t , as w e l l as 
d i f feren t ia ted support, show ing se lec t iv i ty f r om a larger l i s t o f impor tan t but no t p r io r i t ized areas. F o r 
example, there wou ld be a stronger emphasis on inc lus ive growth, focused on p roduc t iv i ty gains and 
sma l l and medium-size enterprises. W o r k on the qua l i ty o f pub l ic expenditures and governance w o u l d 
replace the p r ima ry focus o n the f isca l balance. You th in tegra t ion and culture, emphasized in consu l ta t ion 
w i t h c i v i l society, wou ld be areas fo r a ca ta ly t ic Bank presence, even i f w i thou t s ign i f ican t lend ing .

Ranges and Cases f o r Assistance 

x i . 
Desp i te the c la r i ty o f the government’s goals and the firmness o f i t s commitment, socioeconomic 
and po l i t i c a l uncerta int ies remain. The risks to stability, growth, and social progress are in terwoven . 
With a large pub l ic debt stock and ex terna l f inanc ing requirements, external shocks can be des tab i l iz ing . 
On the domestic side, po l i t ica l support f o r re forms cou ld weaken. Other risks range f r o m slower growth, 
wh ich w o u l d a f fec t debt sustainability, and imp lemen ta t ion weaknesses in some areas, to droughts, 
floods, rising deforestation, crime and violence, and you th unemployment.

This C A S proposes a graduated p rog ram o f support depending on po l icy progress and imp lemen- 
ta t ion o f the Bank program. Curren t ly , h igh e r a n d l ow e r ranges o f a base case scenario f o r B a n k sup- 
p o r t a r e b o t h p laus ib le , wh i le a low-case scenario i s possible but less l ike ly . Unde r a higher range base 
case, Bank support to B r a z i l cou ld be about US$2.2 b i l l i o n a year in the nex t t w o yea rs -cons ide rab ly 
larger than in the past-and 
then dec l in ing to keep w i t h i n exposure l i m i t s . F isca l constraints o f the gov- 
ernment are a key factor in whether a Bank p rog ram wou ld reach this h igher range. Unde r a lowe r range 
base case o f up to US$1.5 b i l l i o n a year, Bank exposure wou ld increase modestly. The absence o f adjust- 
ment lending to B r a z i l in a low-case scenario wou ld im p l y fa l l ing exposure. 

x i i i . 
The ind ica to rs descr ib ing th e l ow e r and h igh e r r ang e base case scenarios invo lve progress 
a long a l l three thematic areas-quity, 
sustainability, and competitiveness-as w e l l as o n the economic 
foundations. G iven the strong links across these areas, progress in one area alone, however strong, w o u l d 
no t be su f f ic ien t . To calibrate these cases in practice, a semi-annual rev iew between the government and 
Bank management wou ld assess progress in po l icy re forms across the fou r areas, as w e l l as development 
outcomes and po r t fo l io performance. These rev iews wou ld fac i l i ta te ma tch ing the p rog ram to pe r fo rm -

B r a z i l today has enormous po ten t ia l . I t also faces hug e challenges. After the “B raz i l ian m ira-

agenda, inc lud ing remarkable achievements in key social ind ica tors and in p r ice s tab i l iza t ion and f isca l 
strengthening since the 1994 Rea l Plan. Econom ic advances were consolidated f r om 1998 onward-in a 
pe r iod that inc luded the 1999 currency cr is is and other ex terna l and domestic shocks-through

The r e f o r m progress o f th e last e ight years i s a strong basis on wh ich to build. Within a short

B r a z i l i s n o w close to ach iev ing universal basic education.* In add i t ion to a massive expansion 
in basic enro l lmen t ( f rom 80 percent in 1980 to over 97 percent in 2002), there have been increases in 
school grade p romo t ion rates and in education expenditure and a reduc t ion in reg iona l differences in ac- 
cess and qua l i ty . M o r e ch i ldren are in school, parents and communities have more in f luence in the educa-

BOK 1. Brazil’s Poverty Prof i le I s Increasingly U r b a n and Young 

The evolution of poverty in B raz i l over the last decade can be d iv ided i n t o three phases: a peak pover ty rate of 
36 percent o f the popu la t ion in 1992-93, associated w i t h h i g h i n f l a t i o n and macroeconomic vo la t i l i ty ; a sharp 
dec l ine to 30 percent b y 1996 i n the context o f the Rea l P lan wh ich brough t an end t o h i g h i n f l a t i o n and the re - 
sumption o f grow th ; and a re la t ive ly stable pover ty rate o f 28-30 percent over the last f i v e years, despite a se- 
quence o f adverse external shocks and the s lowdown of’ GDP growth. 

W i t h i n the stable recent overa l l level, however, the profile ofpoverty has chunged significantly. The effects of 
the recent economic s lowdown have been f e l t p r im a r i l y i n me tropo l i tan areas i n the Southeast-expressed 
i n 
h i g h unemployment rates and lowe r labor income i n these areas. As a result, pove r ty leve ls in me tropo l i tan areas 
increased sharply, w i t h the Southeast share o f pover ty increasing f r om I 7 to 26 percen t f r om 1998 t o 2001. As 
ru ra l areas were l e s s affected b y s low ing growth, the poorest popu la t ions were somewhat sheltered. Moreover , 
improvements in social p o l i c y and p rog ram de l ivery (better access o f the poor t o p u b l i c goods and services) 
helped pro tec t the poorest. Re f lec t ing this, the Northeast share o f pove r ty decreased over the same per iod . 

O ther changes are also evident between 1998 and 2001. Poverty incidence among youths increased (the poo r 
be low 1 4 years o f age increased f r om 36 t o 39 percent o f total); the re la t ionsh ip between pove r ty and education 
weakened somewhat (pover ty f e l l among peop le w i t h no or l i t t l e education and increased in a l l other education 
groups); arid the link between unemploynient and pover ty strengthened. S t i l l , pove r ty rates continue t o be espe- 
c i a l l y h i g h for those w i t h l o w levels o f education, as w e l l as fo r indigenous and afro-descendent populations. 

10. 
The poverty rate has fa l len sharply since economic s tab i l iza t ion in 1994, hove r ing around 28-30 
percent ( f rom 36 percent in 1992) since then.3 But wh i le the pover ty rate i s stable, the pove r ty p ro f i le has

changed (Box 1). Pover ty continues to be deeper in ru ra l areas (53 percent) than in large me tropo l i tan 
areas (20 percent) and smaller urban areas (26 percent). But the r u r a l pover ty rate has fallen, as has the 
share o f the popu la t ion that i s rural, wh i le me tropo l i tan and urban pover ty rates have increased. As a re- 
sult, the share o f r u r a l poor among a l l poor f e l l to 36 percent in 2001. W h i l e B raz i l ’s pover ty continues to 
be concentrated in the Northeast reg ion (52 percent o f the poor), there has been a marked increase in pov - 
er ty in the me t ropo l i tan areas o f the Southeast, wh ich were hardest hit b y the economic crises o f 1998- 
1999 and 2001-2002. The related worsening o f cr ime and v io lence in urban areas threatens the qua l i ty o f 
l i f e and undermines confidence in government and pub l ic ins t i tu t ions . These factors c a l l f o r a g row ing 
focus on reduc ing urban pover ty .

B r a z i l has undertaken f a r - r e a ch ing econom ic r e f o rm s over the last decade, including trade 
opening, e l im ina t ion o f chron ic in f la t ion w i t h the Rea l P lan in 1994, pr iva t iza t ions , and f inanc ia l sector 
 reform^.^ At the same time, however, ne t pub l ic debt increased f r om 27 percent o f GD P at the end o f 
1995 to 45 percent at the end o f 1999. This increase was pa r t ly related to successful s tab i l iza t ion and in- 
creased f isca l transparency. I t was due to a comb ina t ion o f several factors, inc lud ing , among others, high 
rea l interest rates, the devaluation in 1999, recogn i t ion o f past l iab i l i t ies , but also f isca l de f ic i ts . In Oc to- 
be r 1998, the government launched a f isca l s tab i l i ty p rog ram that comb ined stringent targets f o r the pri- 
mary f isca l surplus w i t h robust subnational f isca l adjustment. K e y to ach iev ing subnational adjustment 
were new state deb t re f inanc ing agreements and the landmark F isca l Respons ib i l i ty L a w o f M a y 2000. 
The sw i tch t o a f lex ib le exchange rate and in f la t ion targe t ing in ear ly 1999 was e f fec t ive and created an 
op t im is t ic ou t look b y 2000. During the year, the economy grew b y 4.5 percent, in f la t ion remained low , 
and the debt ra t io stabilized. 

12. 
However, events in 2001 i l lus tra ted that B raz i l ’s pub l ic debt level, i t s reliance on fo re ign ex- 
change-linked domestic debt to reduce f inanc ing costs, and i t s high ex terna l f inanc ing requirements had 
le f t the economy vu ln e r ab l e t o shocks. M u l t i p l e shocks have comb ined to limit B raz i l ’s economic 
g row th t o 1.5 percent o r less since 2001. On the external side, these were the economic cr is is in Argen- 
tina, g loba l risk aversion away f r om emerging markets, h igher o i l pr ices a f ter September 11, 2001, and 
l o w g row th in the Un i ted States and Europe. On the domestic side, shocks inc luded B raz i l ’s energy cr is is 
in 2001 and inves tor uncer ta in ty during the 2002 pres iden t ia l election. The value o f the rea l s l ipped f r o m 
about 2 to the do l la r at the end o f 2000 to almost 4 in the f a l l o f 2002. The p r iva te sector los t access to a l l 
but short-term ex terna l finance, wh ich i tse l f was limited. Pub l ic debt, mos t ly domestic but in a large pa r t 
indexed to the exchange rate and short-term interest rates, rose temporar i ly above 60 percent o f GDP, 
ma in ly because o f the depreciation and h igh interest rates. 

13. 
Amid these d i f f i c u l t circumstances, the government (bo th prev ious and current) redoub led f isca l 
d isc ip l ine to con t ro l the pub l ic debt ra t io and bo ls ter B raz i l ’s economic c red ib i l i ty . The ou tgo ing gov- 
ernment entered i n t o a US$30 b i l l i o n Stand-by Arrangement w i t h the In terna t iona l Mone ta ry Fund (IMF) 
in September 2002. This was based on a 3.75 percent o f GDP p r ima ry surplus target f o r 2003 (or h ighe r i f 
requ ired to stabilize the pub l ic debt to GDP ra t io) and con t inua t ion o f the in f la t ion - ta rge t ing regime. 

14. 
The new ly elected government then sent strong signals o f i t s c omm i tm e n t t o con t inu ing f isca l 
respons ib i l i ty and r e f o rm s . In February 2003, the government announced a p r ima ry surplus target f o r 
2003 o f 4.25 percent o f GDP, h igher than any prev ious p r ima ry surplus. Subsequent rev iews under the 
IMF Stand-by Arrangement have been successful. Tight f isca l p o l i c y has been fo rma l ized in the d ra f t

11. Brazil’s Development Challenges 

A. Long-Term Vision, Multiyear Plan, and Results Framework 
25. 
B raz i l ’s long-term vision calls fo r greater equity, sustainability, and competitiveness. These 
goals are based on the country’s vast progress and promise. B r a z i l ranks among the largest countries in 
the w o r l d in population, landmass, and economy. I t i s endowed w i t h h i g h l y entrepreneurial people, a r i c h 
cu l tu ra l heritage, precious na tura l resources, well-developed soc iopo l i t ica l ins t i tu t ions , and a soph is t i-

cated economy. Based on tremendous progress in the last decades, in par t icu lar in soc ia l ind ica tors and 
economic ins t i tu t ions , B r a z i l has l a i d the foundations fo r a decade o f far-reaching improvements in peo- 
p le ’s welfare. 

26. 
This v is ion i s expressed in a set o f longer term development goals that build on B raz i l ’s eco- 
nom ic development strategy and inc lude the M i l l e n n i um Development Goals. F o r example, fewer peop le 
in extreme pove r ty and lowe r in fan t mo r ta l i ty rates lead to a more equitable Braz i l , more equitable water 
supply coverage brings a more sustainable B raz i l , and higher trade volumes and fewer days to start a 
business con tr ibu te to a more compe t i t ive B raz i l . These goals are also relevant at the subnational leve l . 
Some o f the more s ign i f ican t longer t e r m development goals are shown in Tab le 4. 

27. 
B raz i l ’s development strategy i s de f ined in the federal government’s Multiyear P lan (Plano 
Pluriannual, or PPA ) . Requ ired b y B raz i l ’s 1988 Cons t i tu t ion , the PPA i s an ins trumen t b o t h o f strate- 
g ic or ien ta t ion f o r economic development and o f med ium- term resource allocation. The PPA organizes a l l 
federal government spending fo r a four-year pe r iod (prepared in the first year o f a new government) b y 
programs. A r o l l i n g three-year budget p lan and ind iv idua l annual budgets are in teg ra l parts o f the PPA 
framework .

The 2004-2007 PPA, entitled “A B raz i l f o r All,” aims at progress along five dimensions: 

28. 
economic, social, regional, environmental, and democratic (Figure 1). These in terre la ted strategic p r i o r i - 
ties are re f lec ted in the PPA’s three core “macro” objectives: enhanced soc ia l inc lus ion and equality; eco- 
nom ic g row th (5 percent target f o r 2007) that i s env ironmen ta l ly sustainable and reduces reg iona l ine - 
qualities; and empowerment and par t ic ipa t ion , con t r ibu t ing to better governance and pub l ic sector man- 
agement. Subm i t ted to Congress in September 2003 and expected t o be approved b y November , the new 
PPA lays ou t a program o f approximately US$150 b i l l i o n annually over fou r years. E x p l i c i t l y recogn iz ing 
B raz i l ’s budget rigidities and lack o f f isca l space, the PPA i s framed in f inanc ia l terms consistent w i t h the 
coun try ’s revenue projections. I t seeks t o max im ize p r iva te sector financing, pa r t icu la r ly in the in fras truc- 
ture investments that are key to grow th . The strong p r i o r i t y assigned to the soc ia l inc lus ion agenda i s re- 
f lec ted in funding plans: soc ia l programs dominate p lanned PPA spending (57 percent), fo l lowed b y 
grow th-or ien ted programs (33 percent), and pa r t ic ipa t ion (10 percent). (Mo re de ta i l on the 2004-2007

The new PPA deepened the results-focus o f government expenditure p lann ing . Each o f the 

29. 
three macro objectives has 10 or so “challenges,” and each o f the 30 challenges has a group o f target indi- 
cators-to be achieved b y 2007-that are the key dr ivers o f the PPA. Each o f the PPA’s 374 ind iv idua l 
programs i s a l igned towa rd meeting one or more o f the 30 challenges and the ir target indicators. 

30. 
Features o f th is PPA are a reg iona l focus and a strong element o f consultation w i t h c iv i l 
society, inc lud ing “par t ic ipa t ion fora” in each o f the 27 states. In this context, NGOs and CSOs have 
ca l led a t ten t ion t o possible negative environmental impacts o f cer ta in in fras truc ture investments (such as 
dams, waterways, and roads) that have been inc luded in the PPA. F o l l ow i n g B raz i l ian leg is la t ion , these 
investment pro jec ts are subject to environmental l icens ing and env ironmen ta l impac t assessments. In th is 
context, the M i n i s t r y o f Env ironmen t i s wo rk ing w i t h other m i n i s t r i e s such as Energy and Na t iona l 
In tegra t ion to prepare environmental assessments o f key PPA in fras truc ture investments. The expectation 
i s that investments wou ld be mod i f ied as needed through the inc lus ion o f m i t iga t ion measures. 
Appropr ia te responses wou ld include the development o f integrated strategies to complement new 
in fras truc ture investments w i t h m i t iga t ion measures such as the establishment o f pro tec ted areas 
corridors, imp roved fron t ier governance, and integrated reg iona l development planning, among others. 
C i v i l society organizations have fo rma l ly o f fered to par t ic ipa te in the rev iew o f PPA imp lemen ta t ion to 
assess the effectiveness o f this process. 

3 1. 
Consistent w i t h na t iona l legislation, state gove rnmen ts -e lec ted in October 2002-are 
also 
completing P PA - l i k e mu l t iyea r plans fo r 2004-2007. Several common themes re f lec t the clear na t iona l 

objectives and challenges, inc lud ing greater equ i ty (improvements in the Human Deve lopmen t Index 
(HDI) i s a p r ima ry goa l in nearly a l l states); imp roved economic p roduc t iv i ty and competitiveness (such 
as e f fo r ts to reduce bureaucratic “red-tape’’ in Cearfi); an integrated v iew o f development actions (such as 
the impor tance o f pub l ic expenditure management to imp rove soc ia l sector e f f ic iency in Pemambuco); 
sustained f isca l adjustment and pub l ic spending re fo rm (such as ambitious adm in is tra t ive re forms in Mi- 
nas Gerais); and a results focus, starting w i t h goals and desired outcomes and systematically measuring 
and mon i to r ing progress, that i s evident in v i r tua l ly every state. 

32. 

T h e themes o f a mo re equitable, sustainable, and competitive Braz i l- in 
the context o f mac- 
roeconomic stability-are 
thus a t the hea r t o f the vision set out in the new na t iona l and state PPAs . 

These themes are mu tua l ly re in forc ing . Be t ter education outcomes w i l l bring greater oppor tun i ty , reduc- 
i n g income inequa l i t ies and creating jobs and g row th over time. Imp roved water supply w i l l lead to 
hea l th ier ch i ld ren and a more produc t ive work force . Sustainable use o f na tura l resources w i l l attract in- 
vestment and stimulate grow th . Thus wh i le each theme i s treated separately be low , the greatest impac t 
w i l l come f r o m a ho l is t ic approach that recognizes and exp l ic i t ly builds the linkages among themes.

Desp i te recent progress (and w i t h incomp le te measurement o f the effects o f transfer programs) 
B r a z i l i s s t i l l one o f the wor ld ’s more unequal societies: the richest 1 percent o f the popu la t ion receives 10 
percent o f to ta l monetary income-the same share as the poorest 50 percent. Ana lys is shows that income 
inequa l i ty in B r a z i l stems p r ima r i ly f r om unequal access to education and a high s k i l l p rem ium f o r labor, 
a long w i t h a h igh ly regressive pension system. A more equitable B r a z i l w i l l inves t in and empower peo- 
ple, especially the poorest. H ighe r qua l i ty and more equitable access to education ( inc lud ing secondary 
and ter t iary education) a re key to reduc ing pover ty and inequa l i ty . However, the pos i t ive impacts o f edu- 
ca t ion r e f o rm take time to materialize. Reforms to social assistance cash transfer programs and a more 
equitable pension system can achieve complementary r e s u l t s sooner and substantially reduce inequality.’ 

35.

goals w i l l he lp B r a z i l imp rove i t s standing in the w ide ly used Un i ted Na t ions Human Deve lopmen t Index

73 on the HDI, even though i t s rank ing b y per cap i ta GDP was 60. Some o f the key outcomes targeted 
over the nex t fou r years and the strategies to achieve them are discussed be low (see also Tab le 9, on page

c r i t ica l con t r ibu t ion to a more equitable B raz i l . 

36. 
B r a z i l has made g rea t strides in educa t ion since the early 1990s. Over 97 percent o f ch i ld ren 
ages 7-14 attend school (MDG 2), w i t h education ind ica tors f o r g i r ls exceeding those f o r boys (MDG 3; 
see Tab le 4). These gains, rather than be ing a co ro l la ry o f economic growth-which was very modest 
during the period-arose

programs guaranteeing funding per ch i ld , such as Fundescola and FUNDEF, comb ined w i t h e f fec t ive de-

The most equitable way fo rwa rd wou ld be to he lp more o f the poorest ch i ld ren comp le te grade 8. But fo r 
the wo rk fo rce to be g loba l ly competitive, B r a z i l needs more secondary school graduates. The government

s k i l l s and pedagogical re forms to imp rove classroom teaching; measurement o f schoo l qua l i ty against 
standards to help mon i to r and imp rove equ i ty across schools, d i rec t ing cap i ta l spending and teacher tra in-

and imp roved access fo r ru ra l students and f o r urban students in grades 9 through 11.

Few other countries have equaled this progress. Aga in , good pub l i c policies and im p l em e n t a t i o n have 
made the difference. M o s t impor tan t have been the un iversa l p rov is ion o f services (the U n i f i e d Hea l th

Box 2. Flagship Social Programs o f Brazil’s N e w Administration 
The Forne Zero Progrant seeks to e l i in i r ia te hunger and to guarantee food security to a l l Brazilians. As a multi- 
dimensional program, i t includes a Food Card Program (Programa Cartilo Alinientagilo), which transfers cash to 
targeted poor families; emergency interventions fo r specific groups (landless, indigenous, and qu i lombo las ; di- 
r e c t food purchases to stimulate family agriculture; school feeding and mother and infant nutrition sche.mes; and 
creation o f a food bank. I t also includes more structural interventions such as literacy courses, construction o f 
water tanks and small-scale irrigation, support to family agriculture, and assistance w i t h needed documentation. 
Pome Zero i s innovative i n i t s participatory approach and i t s promotion o f public-private partnerships (through 
widespread food collection, donation sites, and private sector participation at the municipal level), including 
with IFC. 

The Primeiro Emprego program tackles youth unemployment through t h e insertion o f youths into the labor 
market, by providing incentives for firms to hire youths, and incentives for entrepreneurship and s e l f - 
employment; job readiness, including actions to promote apprenticeships, internships, and community work ; and 
soc ia l participation. including the promotion o f partnerships between government and the private sector and be- 
tween government and c iv i l society. 

The government i s also working to integrate the multiplicity o f federal cash transfer program-Bolsa Escola, 
Bolsa Alimenta@o, Cartilo Aliinenta@o, and the Auxilio Gas-into a single unified benefit ( the Bolsa Fant i l ia 
program). This would correct coverage gaps, duplication. and inequities among existing programs; increase 
transparency and consistency i n beneficiary selection; build greater institutional resilience; and reduce adminis- 
trative inefficiencies. The unified program aims to reduce the incidence and intensity o f extreme poverty i n Bra- 
z i l through a direct monetary transfer to the most needy families and to reduce future poverty through incentives 
for beneficiary fanu l ies to invest i n human and soc ia l capital and rationalization o f the safety net. 

39 . 

B u t disparities remain large in health care funding across regions and in u t i l iza t ion rates 

across social groups. M a n y o f the poorest s t i l l lack access to basic services. And poo r qua l i ty and i n e f f i -

C r im e and v io lence have increased drama t ica l ly in B r a z i l i n recent decades. 
pa r t icu la r ly i n large urban areas, and are now recognized as serious eco-

Some o f these you th are also

Experience in L a t i n Amer ica and elsewhere suggests that the mun ic ipa l leve l

also shows that p r ima ry respons ib i l i ty l ies no t jus t w i t h the police, bu t that 
governments, commnunities, and partnerships at a l l levels need to be ac t ive ly

based on comprehensive “safety audits” or c r ime and violence diagnostics.

46. 

B raz i l ’s long - te rm goals to achieve greater sustainability inc lude enhanced and more equitable 

access to urban and ru ra l basic services such as water supply and sanitation, better water qua l i ty and water 
resource management, more sustainable land management, pro tec t ion o f forests and b iod ivers i ty , and 
greater social inc lus ion . H igh l igh ts o f targeted outcomes over the CAS pe r iod and strategies f o r ach iev ing 
those outcomes are discussed be low (see also Tab le 10 on page 43). 

47. 

The g row ing number o f urban poor depend more than other groups on pub l ic services to pro tec t 
and enhance their assets. M a n y urban poor a re no t served b y water and sanitation sources; many spend 
hours on pub l ic transportation to get to and f r om work . Water and a i r po l lu t ion , a long w i t h the ir hea l th 
consequences, are predom inan t ly urban problems, and they a f fec t the poo r most. And in per iphera l u rban 
areas many poo r people do n o t have secure proper ty r igh ts to the ir land and housing, severely cu r ta i l ing 
the ir ab i l i ty to par t ic ipa te in cred i t markets and even some labor markets. U rban hous ing and land markets 
do no t func t ion equitably, large ly because o f lack o f adequate land and the in fras truc ture to serve that 
land. L a w and order i s a fundamental pub l ic good o f obvious relevance in u rban areas. A l l o f these con- 
cerns interact w i t h the con t inued g row th o f in fo rma l settlements (some 350,000 newcomers arr ive in Si50 
Pau l0 alone each year), wh ich strains loca l governments’ capacity. 

48. 

W i t h urban g row th comes demand f o r housing, water supply, sanitation, drainage, wastewater 
po l lu t ion control, so l id waste management, and urban transport. The government has demonstrated i t s 
focus on urban policy through the creation o f a new M i n i s t r y o f C i t ies . Among the pr ior i t ies , re fo rm ing 
loca l master planning, subd iv is ion regulations, building codes, and zon ing ordinances wou ld imp rove 
land u s e and increase the supply o f land f o r low- income hous ing to arrest the g row th o f in fo rma l settle- 
ments. L o c a l upgrad ing programs wou ld put more emphasis on tenure and reg is tra t ion (MDG 7). Federa l 
hous ing programs m igh t become ma tch ing grant schemes f o r states and mun ic ipa l i t ies and inc lude non - 
governmental organizations (NGOs) fo r urban upgrading. Pub l ic transport systems, another asset impo r - 
tant to the poor, con tr ibu te to the value o f land and hous ing assets when markets are func t ion ing we l l . 

49. 

W a t e r supply and sanitation services are the respons ib i l i ty o f states and mun ic ipa l i t ies , though 
several federal programs support the subnational governments. Access i s uneven. The poo r are least l i k e l y 
to have adequate service, w i t h a large par t o f the unserved popu la t ion l i v i n g in sma l l mun ic ipa l i t ies , pe r i - 
urban areas, and favelas. Ve ry l i t t l e co l lec ted wastewater i s treated, add ing to hea l th hazards and env i - 
ronmen ta l degradation, especially in urban areas. A l though u t i l i t y ta r i f fs are genera l ly adequate, h a l f the 
state u t i l i t ies requ ire f isca l support to meet operational de f ic i ts . I f u t i l i t y managers had the incen t ives and 
autonomy to imp rove e f f ic iency , the gains cou ld be allocated to better service coverage and qua l i ty f o r 
the poor. Services cou ld also be imp roved w i t h a clearer lega l and regu la tory framework , and t a r i f f and 
bulk water pricing reforms to promo te conservation and e f f ic iency . G r ow i n g u rban iza t ion i s s tra in ing the 
capacity o f the sector to expand services: during the 1990s the number o f new connections bare ly ex- 
ceeded the number o f new urban households. 

50. 

An integrated approach to wa te r po l lut ion contro l and urban upg rad ing can enhance the 

benefits o f a w ide range o f interventions. Poor households are more w i l l i n g to con tr ibu te to the costs o f 
sewerage and other urban services i f they have some security o f tenure. The hea l th bene f i ts o f e f fec t ive

to urban water po l lu t ion con tro l . In tegra ted approaches to water po l lu t ion and u rban upg rad ing depend o n 
cooperation among a var ie ty o f actors and rev i ta l iza t ion o f e f fec t ive me t ropo l i tan governance. Successful

land ownersh ip and securing proper ty rights f o r poo r landowners, and the new government emphasizes 
this issue s trong ly . Comp lemen t ing the acceleration o f i t s t rad i t iona l land re fo rm program, the govern- 
ment has developed community-based approaches to imp rove access to land and increase p roduc t iv i ty . 
This approach builds on ru ra l pover ty reduc t ion programs, p r ima r i ly in the Northeast, that p rov ide l o w

urgent new issues in water resource management present challenges w i t h strong pover ty imp l ica t ions . 

55. 

H is to r ica l ly , water resource management in B r a z i l has been fragmented, has p r io r i t ized new

In contrast w i t h some other L a t i n Amer ican economies, B r a z i l has many large firms. They o f fe r

The g row th o f sma l l companies i s c r i t ica l f o r p roduc t iv i ty : new entrants typ ica l ly show h igher

A l though B raz i l ’s f inanc ia l sector i s sophisticated and systemic risk i s low , i t lacks depth, 
and in te rmed ia t ion spreads a re among the highest in the wo r ld . F inanc ia l sector e f f ic iency i s an im-

framework and imp lemen ted the corresponding ins truc t ions in the banking system. 

68. 

B raz i l ’s pub l ic banks h o l d more than 40 percent o f f inanc ia l sector assets. They have access t o 
special funding sources and undertake a large share o f d irec ted lend ing . Fo r t i f ied b y recent recap i ta l iza-

69 . 

Even w i t h the strong ro le o f pub l ic banks, access to f inanc ia l services i s uneven ly distributed 
away f r o m the poorest. Sma l l entrepreneurs have l i t t l e access to finance. The expansion o f f inanc ia l ser-

and economic inclusion, and the sustainable expansion o f m icro f inance and nonbank f inanc ia l services

sector management reforms, transparent and inc lus ive decision-making processes, and an e f fec t ive jus t ice

73 , Within the macroeconomic framework, f isca l d isc ip l ine continues t o b e c r i t ica l . With the con- 
so l ida t ion o f f isca l responsibility, the focus has sh i f ted f r om just ensuring f isca l balance to im p r o v i n g the

ment, inc lud ing the most recent reduc t ion in the share o f exchange rate-indexed pub l ic debt, has been 
substantial. Conso l ida t ing and ins t i tu t iona l iz ing this progress wou ld further reduce f isca l risks. 

75. 
Responsible macroeconomic management i s essential, but i t i s no t enough f o r B r a z i l to ma in ta in 
i t s c red ib i l i ty wh i le also attending to the many social demands and expectations. E f f e c t i v e f isca l disci- 
f r om the extensive earmark ing o f reve-

nues and high mandated expenditures-has c ircumscr ibed the government’s a b i l i t y to allocate, o r rea l lo- 
cate, budget resources to i t s pr ior i t ies . Addressing the structural r i g i d i t y o f the government budget, im- 
p rov ing the qua l i ty o f pub l ic spending, and upgrad ing pub l ic expenditure management are necessary 
complementary objectives f o r f isca l sustainability . 
76. 
Until recently, f isca l e f for ts were concentrated on the revenue side. They have increased pub l ic 
sector revenues to above 35% o f GDP, wh ich i s very high in comparison to o ther m idd le - income coun- 
t r i e s and leaves no r o om f o r add i t iona l taxation. Therefore, to increase the government’s capacity to re- 
spond to society’s demands wh i le ma in ta in ing f isca l discipline, f isca l expenditures need to be rea l loca ted 
to we l l-cra f ted pub l ic interventions. Such reallocations wou ld increase the qua l i ty o f pub l ic spending, 
concentrating scarce resources on e f fec t ive reduc t ion o f pover ty and inequa l i ty and p romo t ion o f eco- 
nom ic grow th . In this context, the government i s pursuing essential s t r u c t u r a l f isca l r e f o rm s . M o s t im-

a revenue de-earmarking arrangement (DRU), wh ich wou ld increase the federa l government’s spending 
f lex ib i l i ty ; changes in the pub l ic employment law ; and other measures to reduce budge t r i g i d i t y .

government, and ove ra l l public administrations are no t geared towa rd e f f ic iency and r e s u l t s . Cumbersome 
bureaucracies are obstacles to e f f ic ien t social service de l ive ry and a business-friendly investment climate. 
As a result, the qua l i ty o f governance in B r a z i l i s s t i l l perceived to l a g beh ind that o f O ECD countries and

tended to streamline cumbersome bureaucratic processes and make pub l ic adm in is tra t ion more ag i le and

Weak economic grow th in the region and

Slippages on macro reforms cou ld lead to

the cost o f debt and worsening the r i s k s 
related to pub l ic debt stocks. 

Table 5. Brazil Faces Both Major Opportunities and R i s k s 
Opportunities 
Strong economic growth globally cou ld en- 
able B raz i l to leverage i t s comparative advan- 
tages to attract more foreign direct investment 
(and tourism). 
Greater economic stability and less vulnerabil- 
i t y to extemal shocks could mean investment 
grade status for Brazil’s govemment bonds, 
reducing the cost o f servicing t h e debt. 
Integration o f social programs, better targeting 
o f the poor, and greater efficiency in pub l ic 
spending could lead to increased equity. 
Focus on interactive measures to maintain 
fiscal and macro stability along w i t h reforms 
in social programs and spending cou ld lead to 
a virtuous cycle o f growth w i t h equity. 
Microeconomic reforms that reduce logistics 
costs and strengthen the regulatory framework 
could accelerate growth, stimulating economic 
expansion. 

D is jo in ted and uncoordinated assistance 
programs, assistencialismo, and poor 
management o f limited pub l ic resources 
could prejudice sustained reductions in 
poverty and inequality. 
Lack o f consensus on po l icy reforms, 
stalled po l icy implementation, or passage 
o f only weakened versions o f reforms 
could jeopardize sustained macroeco- 
nomic stability and growth. 
Lack o f microeconomic reforms could 
impede faster economic growth. 

W i thou t greater capacity fo r management 
and implementation o f environmental 
policies, current environmental trends 
could worsen, resulting in more environ- 
mental degradation. 
W i thou t social consensus, reforms may 
not be passed and wou ld l i k e l y no t be as 
effective; social progress, crime, and v io - 
lence could worsen. 
W i thou t region-specific strategies that 
leverage regional comparative advan- 
tages, regional economic and social dis- 
parities could widen. 

Greater capacity fo r management and imp le- 
mentation o f environmental policies cou ld 
stimulate more sustainable use o f natural re- 
sources. 
A common vision o f development, w i t h 
strong community and c i v i l society participa-

fectiveness o f public policies, inc lud ing those 
fo r reducing crime and violence. 
Leveraging the comparative advantages o f

The comb ina t ion o f macroeconomic d isc ip l ine , s truc tura l reforms, and e f fec t ive soc ia l po l ic ies

85. 
Government comm i tmen t to economic s tab i l i ty and the re fo rm agenda i s strong. But there rema in 
considerable risks to the pos i t ive scenario described above. Some r i s k s are re la ted to pub l ic debt stocks 
and external f inanc ing requirements that can be reduced on ly over t ime and that im p l y con t inu ing vu lner- 
ab i l i ty to external shocks. Domes t ic factors inc lude the risks o f weakening po l i t ica l support fo r re forms 
and o f weak po l icy implementation. Risks to economic s tab i l i ty are in te rwoven w i t h r i s k s to social p ro - 
gress and grow th . I f g row th and social progress rema in slow, po l i t ica l support f o r sound economic p o l i - 
cies and reforms cou ld diminish and undermine market confidence. 

86. 

The l ike l ihood o f debt sustainability under the current po l icy stance i s reasonably high,14 and 
there i s now a track record that decisive government ac t ion can arrest worsen ing debt t o GD P ra t ios in 
cases o f negative shock. Yet, despite strong f isca l efforts, pub l ic debt has r isen in recent years, unde r l in - 
ing the c r i t ica l importance o f d isc ip l ined f isca l po l ic ies and persistent e f for ts to imp rove the compos i t ion 
o f the pub l ic debt. Nega t ive ex terna l shocks, lowe r than expected growth, o r the discovery o f fur ther f i s - 
ca l l iab i l i t ies cou ld interact and wou ld in f luence the current assessment o f pub l ic debt sustainability. In 
such a situation, the government wou ld have to restore confidence through appropriate f isca l and mone- 
tary policies, as i t has done in the past. 

87. 

M icroeconom ic po l ic ies to improve the investment climate and p roduc t iv i ty are another key 
factor. The government sees imp rov ing log is t ics and infrastructure, the regu la tory environment, and the 
f inanc ia l sector as a pa th to h igher grow th . However, the lack o f f isca l space f o r c r i t ica l pub l ic inves t- 
ments i n infrastructure-a consequence o f the necessary f isca l adjustment-is a constraint. A lso , the large 
number o f entities that need to take ac t ion f o r e f fec t ive improvements in the investment c l ima te consti- 
tu tes a risk. 

88. 

Region-specific factors bring both opportunity and risks. F o r example, B raz i l ’s predom i- 

nan t ly urban coastal areas represent opportunities fo r development and techno log ica l progress. But wors- 
en ing cr ime and violence, among other factors, cou ld scare o f f investment and, w i t h increas ing urban 
pover ty rates, con tr ibu te to a deepening urban crisis. D rough t in the Northeast and the f loods t o wh ich the 
Southeast i s prone can ha rm programs and po l ic ies there. The already high rates o f deforestation and en- 
v ironmen ta l degradation in the N o r t h a re pro jec ted to worsen under current trends, unless there i s greater 
po l icy commitment. An t ic ipa t ing , planning, and ac t ing on these fron ts w o u l d be key t o success. 

89 . 

F ina l ly , capacity to implement policies and investments-by government o r i ts partners-is an 

added risk. M a n y m i n i s t r i e s o f the new adm in is tra t ion are staffed w i t h re la t ive newcomers to government

91. 
This C A S was developed on the basis o f lessons f r om imp lementat ion o f Bank G roup assis- 
tance over the last decade. I t draws heav i ly f r om the Operations Eva lua t ion Department’s (OED’s) recent 
Coun try Assistance Eva lua t ion (CAE) and the Operation Eva lua t ion Group’s (OEG’ s ) Coun try Impac t 
Rev iew (CIR), bo th cover ing 1990-2002, and a Comp le t ion Repor t on the FY2000-2003 C A S (Annex 2). 
I t also incorporates valuable suggestions f r om the Comm i t tee on Deve lopmen t Effectiveness (CODE ) 
discussions o f the CAE and the C IR . 
The recent B r a z i l C A E rates B a n k support overa l l as satisfactory (Box 3 , wh i le recogn iz ing 
92. 
that during this pe r iod the Bank became less impor tan t as a source o f f inance to B raz i l . The Bank’s strat- 
egy became more selective, focus ing on the poo r Northeast and on ac t iv i t ies to address the roots o f pov - 
erty. Educa t ion and hea l th were elevated as p r io r i ty sectors, as was the p rov is ion o f basic services and 
assets to the poor . The g row th element o f the strategy invo lved support to government’s decen tra l iza t ion 
and p r iva t iza t ion o f in fras truc ture through techn ica l assistance in regu la t ion and selective lend ing . F ina l ly , 
assistance to the environment expanded s ign i f ican t ly in the 1990s, focus ing on green issues. F r o m 1999, 
adjustment lend ing constituted a large share o f Bank f inanc ia l support t o B raz i l . The CAE concludes tha t 
adjustment lend ing p layed an impor tan t ro le in suppor t ing c r i t ica l reforms, but that soc ia l security and 
f inanc ia l sector re forms have n o t yet gone far e n o u g h 4 l e a r l y ind ica t ing challenges f o r this CAS .

The C A E also h igh l ighted valuable lessons. Among them: The c r i t ica l ro le o f macroeconomic

The need to con t inue invo lvemen t in the social sectors, where Bank support has been shown to con tr ibu te

2002 

The m a i n component o f Bank support, compr is ing rough ly h a l f o f to ta l lending, was designed to address the 
roots of poverty through liuntan resource development and access to basic services. The C A E endorsed the 
Bank ’s decision fo r a strong focus on the social sectors, and i n par t icu lar on the Northeast. The Bank ’s p rog ram 
con tr ibu ted to pos i t ive development outcomes i n education (infrastructure, materials, strengthening o f state sec- 
retariats o f education, m i n im um operational standards i n a l l schools), health (communicable diseases and health 
infrastructure). and the expansion o f basic infrastructure to the poor (rura l pover ty a l lev ia t ion pro jec ts and p ro - 
jects i n water and sanitation and urban transportation). Fur ther focus on education, and i n par t icu lar secondary 
education, wou ld be impor tan t in the new CAS . 

A second component o f Bank support was designed to stirnulute investnient, economic ejFciency, und growth. 
This component produced m ixed resu l ts . B raz i l ’s g row th rates have surpassed the L a t i n Ame r ican average in 
recent years, but rema in generally disappointing. The Bank ’s program strengthened the capacity o f B r a z i l i a n 
states t o manage their own infrastructure, bu t d i d no t succeed in remov ing c r i t i c a l bottlenecks that continue to 
cons tra in pub l ic and pr iva te investment and affect economic performance. Greater attention t o g row th po l ic ies 
was c i ted as a key challenge fo r the for thcom ing CAS . 

A th i rd component o f the Bank program, support to the environntent, was found to have produced satisfactory 
resu l ts . The Bank p layed a ro le i n the build-up o f ins t i tu t iona l capacity i n the environment area. f r om re la t ive ly 
l o w leve ls in the early 1 9 9 0 ~ he lp ing the B r a z i l i a n government address many c r i t ica l challenges i n t h e decade. 
The CAE endorsed a continued strong ro le f o r the Bank. 

(b) con t inued use o f programmatic adjustment lending as an appropriate ins trumen t f o r B raz i l ; (c) better 
in tegra t ion o f Bank strategies across regions and states as w e l l as across sectors to achieve greater devel- 
opment impact; (d) increased mon i to r ing and eva lua t ion o f results and impacts; and (e) more e f fec t ive 
dissemination o f ana ly t ica l work, wh ich ove ra l l was seen as p rov id ing a strong pos i t ive con t r ibu t ion to 
B raz i l ’s development agenda. These lessons have been w ide ly discussed w i t h government counterparts 
and w i t h i n the B r a z i l country team and have been incorpora ted in to this new CAS, as described fur ther 
be low . 

94. 

The CAS Completion Report (Annex 2) cover ing FY2000-2003 draws heav i ly on the CAE and 
builds o n i ts findings. I t concludes that the CAS structure and content were consistent w i t h the govern- 
men t p rog ram and the country’s long - te rm goals, a l though the government p laced greater emphasis on 
in fras truc ture than the Bank did during th is per iod . I t further concludes that the Bank p rog ram ove ra l l 
made a satisfactory con t r ibu t ion to B raz i l ’s development, despite the fac t that coun try progress during the 
pe r iod f e l l be low i n i t i a l expectations in some key areas, no tab ly economic grow th . 

95 . 

Areas o f success were the p r io r i t ies selected b y the CAS, name ly programs f o r d irec t pove r ty 
reduc t ion and support fo r f isca l reforms. In pover ty reduction, the Bank’s impac t was greatest in hea l th 
and education, and less pronounced in soc ia l pro tec t ion . In f isca l re form , the Bank ’s impac t was greatest 
in macroeconomic management and less pronounced in imp rov ing the qua l i ty o f pub l ic expenditures. 
Taking i n t o account these lessons, social pro tec t ion and the qua l i ty o f spending are t w o areas tha t n ow 
deserve greater emphasis. 

96. 

Econom ic and f isca l s tab i l i ty has imp roved the environment f o r grow th . But despite a w i d e array 
o f investment lending, adjustment lend ing ( f inanc ia l and energy sectors), and ana ly t ica l and adv isory ac- 
t iv i t ies (AAA) pursuing the g row th agenda, the Bank ’s program had insufficient direct impact on 
growth in the period. In particular, v i t a l re forms in the regu la tory env ironmen t did n o t progress. This 
conc lus ion has helped or ien t this CAS, wh ich makes the g row th agenda a key p r io r i ty .

the overa l l p o r t f o l i o , due essentially to lowe r returns on equity investments. 

The ma in recommendations, many already translated in to action, include: 

Strive for better equity decisions, target yields, and focus onf irst-t ier sponsors. W i t h a new ly assigned task 
team, I F C w i l l continue to imp rove returns on i t s equity po r t fo l io , wh ich was substantially affected b y v o l a t i l i t y

97. 
In the rema in ing two pillars o f the FY2000-2003 CAS, governance and en v i ronm en t a l m a n - 
agement, progress has been m o r e m i x ed . On governance, the Bank p rog ram has been re la t ive ly cau- 
tious and selective, and the Bank ’s con t r ibu t ion slight. On env ironmen ta l management, coun try progress 
has been modest, but the Bank has had a catalytic role, ma in ly in donor- funded in i t ia t ives l i k e the P i l o t 
Program to Conserve the Ra in Forest ( W P ) and the G loba l Env i ronmen t F a c i l i t y (GEF), wh ich have 
generated successes. These demonstration e f for ts cou ld be scaled up. 

98. 
Increased strateg ic focus o n the No r theas t and on re la t ionsh ips w i t h the states has pa id divi- 
dends, as has con t inued acknowledgement o f the cen tra l ro le o f f isca l management in B r a z i l today. Im- 
p rov ing analysis o f pub l ic spending, strengthening the m icroeconom ic env ironmen t fo r growth, and 
building ins t i tu t ions to tack le exclusion, violence, and env ironmen ta l p ro tec t ion are some o f the key cha l-

OEG’s r e v i ew o f IFC’s operat ions in B r a z i l during FY 1990-2002 no ted tha t B r a z i l was consis- 
ten t ly among IFC ’s largest coun try po r t fo l ios and that approvals expanded 15 - fo ld during the rev iew pe-

out these years, requ i r ing that IFC adjust f lex ib ly to the rap id ly evo lv ing environment, coun try needs, and 
opportunities (Box 6).

v i r tua l ly every state in B raz i l . The po r t fo l io i s broad ly matched to the government’s development p r io r i -

L a c k o f budget (and in some cases counterpart funds) i s due p r ima r i ly to the effects o f B raz i l ’s 
amb i t ious f isca l adjustment program. F isca l measures since the late 1990s, wh i le necessary and pos i t ive 
overall, have resu l ted in substantially r edu c ed f isca l space f o r pub l i c investments . Recent budget cuts

loans f r o m in terna t iona l f inanc ia l institutions, prev ious ly considered add i t iona l to the budget, have effec- 
t ive ly been treated as regular budget expenditure items, subject to ove ra l l f isca l targets and constraints. 
These necessary and healthy measures have led to reduced budgets fo r investment pro jec ts funded b y in-

been a s low ing o f the rate o f investment lend ing disbursements, wh ich f e l l b y more than h a l f f r om

In addition, devaluations over the last several years have translated i n t o larger do l lar-denom ina ted

these issues, inc lud ing through a recent Coun try Po r t fo l io Performance Rev iew (CPPR) h e l d j o i n t l y w i t h 
the In te r -Ame r ican Development Bank (IDB), wh ich faces the same set o f imp lemen ta t ion challenges. 
Among the avenues proposed are a plan f o r pa r t ia l cancellations o f loan balances, w i t h agreement in prin- 
c ip le on cance l ing a s ign i f ican t share o f the undisbursed amount; close cooperation w i t h P lann ing and

103. 
F o r the same f isca l reasons, new conven t iona l inves tmen t l end ing has become in c r e a s ing l y

104. Recent Bank and partner diagnostic wo rk indicates that B r a z i l has a strong inst itut iona l f rame - 
w o r k f o r imp lementat ion at the nat iona l level. The 2002 C F A A rated the country’s f inanc ia l account- 
ab i l i ty systems and ins t i tu t ions as well-designed and re l iab le in track ing budget expenditures, w i t h a high 
degree o f transparency. While e f fec t ive in ensuring aggregate f isca l control, more w o r k i s needed in mod-

The Bank has also recen t ly discussed and agreed w i t h the federal government on the Coun t ry

inc luded commitments f r om in terna t iona l lenders that did no t have c red i t ex- 
posures to these banks. These transactions helped address in terna t iona l banks’ 
concerns fo r their B r a z i l short-term exposure and complemented the authori-

C. Consultations and Outreach 

110. With the new government’s focus on par t ic ipa t ion , the Bank has substantially expanded i t s out- 
reach with c i v i l society groups (Box 8). Thus, in add i t ion to consultations w i t h federal government min- 
i s t r i e s and representatives o f v i r tua l ly a l l state governments, the coun try team has consulted w i t h you th 
groups, env ironmen ta l and other NGOs, trade unions, the media, and p r iva te sector and re l ig ious groups. 
Special consultations were he ld w i t h the Soc ia l and Econom ic Deve lopmen t Counc i l (CDES), an adv i -

sory counc i l established b y the government t o g ive greater vo ice t o a l l groups in society in discussions o f 
key r e f o rm p r io r i t ies . The Bank sponsored an Innova t ion D a y and i s seeking ou t the voices o f less we l l - 
represented groups, such as the qu i lombo las (Afro-descendants l i v i n g in remote commun i t ies) and in- 
digenous groups. The feedback f r om consultations has been shared w i t h the government (whose represen- 
tatives par t ic ipa ted in some o f the events) and throughout the coun try team, and has been re f lec ted in the 
design o f the program. 

11 1. Curren t pro jec ts are also a source o f ongo ing consu l ta t ion a n d feedback . An impo r tan t share o f 
the Bank ’s p o r t f o l i o o f active projects i s carr ied out in close partnership w i t h c i v i l society organizations. 
F o r example, the nine ongo ing Northeast state Ru ra l Pover ty Reduc t ion Projects (PCPRs) use a commu- 
n i ty -d r iven approach in wh ich loca l associations decide on the most pressing inves tmen t needs, f inance 
the investments, and contract fo r the ir execution. These associations ensure s imp le and measurable pov - 
er ty targeting, transparency, and dissemination o f best prac t ice among commun i ty members. Ac t ive par- 
t ic ipa t ion o f l o c a l communities i s a key element in the selection and design o f pro tec ted areas in the Ama - 
zon Reg ion Protected Areas (ARPA) pro jec t . This pa r t ic ipa to ry approach, wh ich also inc ludes coopera- 
t i o n w i t h B raz i l ian NGOs and sc ien t i f ic and academic ins t i tu t ions , i s con t r ibu t ing t o decen tra l iza t ion o f

also brough t to light a number o f new ideas, a l l ow i n g the p rog ram to be much more re f lec t ive o f B raz i l ’s 
p r io r i t ies . One emphasis was on tak ing advantage o f oppor tun i t ies re la t ing to Braz i l ’s true wea l th through 
greater a t ten t ion t o education, entrepreneurship, culture, and na tu ra l resources. In l i n e w i t h the PPA v is ion 
f o r a more sustainable B raz i l , concerns were ra ised re la ted t o the sustainability imp l ica t ions o f some PPA 
in fras truc ture investments. Consultations also emphasized emerg ing issues-including 
culture, c r ime and 
violence, you th as w e l l as stronger imp lemen ta t ion o f the sustainability agenda-issues 
on wh ich the 
coun try team m igh t no t otherwise have focused as much. 

113. The enthusiastic response to consultations made i t clear that an ongoing p a r t i c i p a t o r y process of 
consu ltat ion , inc lud ing the eventual development o f a lea rn ing fo rum o r development ne twork , was n o t 
on ly in demand w i t h i n c i v i l society bu t w o u l d also s t reng then the p r o g r am and i t s responsiveness to 
B raz i l ’s needs. The Bank i s building this ongo ing consu l ta t ive process in coord ina t ion w i t h the CDES, 
key c i v i l society networks, and w i t h other interested in te rna t iona l and domestic partners, inc lud ing you th 
movements, and expects to take advantage o f GDLN and web-based networks. 

D. Deve lopmen t P a r tn e r s

agreed soon. The Bank and the IMF are coord ina t ing closely and are in agreement on the basic parameters 
o f B raz i l ’s macroeconomic p rog ram and performance. Bank adjustment lend ing and the l inked technical 
assistance have helped to deepen progress in areas that are also central t o the IMF program, such as debt 
and expenditure management. The recen t ly completed F inanc ia l Sector Assessment P rog ram (FSAP) was 
a highlight o f Bank - IMF collaboration. 

116. 
The Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) has a large program in Brazil, w i t h annual 
commitments s im i lar in vo lume to the Bank’s, at about US$1.5 b i l l i o n . Since mos t o f these comm i tmen ts

are in inves tmen t loans, wh ich are s low ly disbursing because o f f isca l factors discussed above (paragraph 
113), IDB’s p o r t f o l i o o f US$10 b i l l i o n in ongoing commitments i s substantially larger than the Bank ’s 
investment lend ing po r t fo l io , wh ich faces s i m i l a r issues. The tw o programs are h igh ly matched in terms 
o f objectives, w i t h a focus on social development, environment, g row th and infrastructure, and good gov- 
ernance. But w i t h i n broad ly aligned programs, there are d i f fe ren t areas o f strength and emphasis. Exam - 
ples are the Bank ’s re la t ive focus on basic education compared w i t h IDB’s focus on secondary and h igher 
education, and the Banks emphasis on ru ra l areas compared w i t h the IDB’s stronger urban po r t fo l io . 

117. 
Because IDB i s an impor tan t partner fo r bo th B r a z i l and the Bank, the coun try team has recen t ly 
built a more formal collaborative relationship. Several wo rk ing groups w i l l be exam in ing ways f o r the 
tw o development banks, building on the ir comparative advantages, to share know ledge and experience 
and better serve B raz i l ’s in te res ts . Among the areas to be examined are ana ly t ica l wo rk on the f isca l situa- 
t i o n o f B raz i l ’s states; j o i n t development o f a mun ic ipa l strategy to guide lending to B raz i l ’s loca l gov- 
ernments; harmon iza t ion o f f inanc ia l management, procurement, and other po l ic ies ; and ana ly t ica l w o r k 
on a t trac t ing p r iva te sector investment in infrastructure. At the state leve l , the Bank i s coord ina t ing w i t h 
IDB and o ther partners through state assistance strategies, wh ich dove ta i l w i t h IDB’ s amb i t ious p rog ram 
o f capacity building at the l o c a l leve l . The two ins t i tu t ions may also exp lore co l labora t ion on sectorwide 
approaches (SWAPS). 

118. Partnerships w i t h UNDP, other UN agencies, and numerous bilateral agencies are fruitful. 
Among other areas, UNDP’s program focuses on mon i to r ing and measurement o f the Human Deve lop - 
ment Index, and on t rack ing and mon i to r ing the M i l l e n n i um Development Goals, fo r wh ich UNDP i s the 
lead agency. The Bank i s wo rk ing closely w i t h b i la te ra l agencies, inc lud ing G-7 governments, on the Pi- 
l o t Program to Conserve the Ra in Forest. I t i s also wo rk ing w i t h the C i t ies A l l iance , a g loba l partnership, 
and w i t h the Japan Po l icy and Human Resources Deve lopmen t (PHRD) t r u s t fund. Some b i la te ra l agen- 
cies adopted exp l ic i t strategies o f complementarity w i t h the Bank . Several thematic wo rk ing groups have 
also been fo rmed among B raz i l ’s external partners, such as that on the M i l l e n n i um Deve lopmen t Goals. 

E. World Bank Group Comparative Advantage and Focus 

119. 
The Bank has specific areas of focus o r comparative advantage re la t ive to i t s in terna t iona l 
partners. The first i s i t s know ledge contributions, based o n i t s g loba l experience, and the link to p o l i c y 
dialogue. The second i s i t s ab i l i ty to strengthen ins t i tu t iona l capacity, inc lud ing through WB I ac t iv i t ies . 
The third i s compe t i t ive f inanc ing and innova t ive lend ing products. The fou r th i s the ab i l i ty to catalyze 
through i t s pro jec ts the e f f ic ien t spending o f others, inc lud ing the government. 

120. 
The Bank ’s f inanc ing remains relevant as a low-cos t source f o r meeting a part of Brazil’s gross 
external financing requirements o f US$40-50 b i l l i o n annually. However , the true value o f Bank lend- 
ing comes to bear when i t s resources support policies, programs, o r pro jec ts that im p l y a better qua l i ty o f 
pub l ic spending, inc lud ing po l icy improvements and re forms that reach w e l l beyond the spec i f ic inves t- 
ments f inanced w i t h Bank loans. Even more impor tan t i s h o w Bank lend ing can leverage other f inanc ia l 
sources. To fulfill these roles, the Bank needs to con t inue a broad range o f ana ly t ica l and adv isory ac t iv i - 
ties (AAA) and to select projects fo r support that can achieve leverage and systemic impac t beyond the i r 
pos i t ive d irec t results. 

121. 
IFC , IDB, and Brazil’s public banks are the on ly significant sources of medium and long- 
term finance f o r the private sector in B raz i l . Acco rd ing t o the O E G repor t and consultations w i t h the 
p r iva te sector, IFC’s add i t iona l i ty has been greater than f inanc ing amounts wou ld indicate, rang ing f r o m 
sharing techn ica l and f inanc ia l s truc tur ing expertise to encouraging good social and env ironmen ta l prac- 
tices. I FC ’ s add i t iona l i ty was also strong through i t s B - loan mob i l iza t ion and advisory assistance. With

more than 40 years o f experience in B r a z i l and a h igh ly d ive rs i f ied po r t fo l io demonstrating mu l t isec tora l 
expertise ( inc lud ing such d i f f i c u l t sectors as pr iva te infrastructure, cap i ta l market development, p r iva te 
hea l th care, and education), the I F C i s a long- term partner o f the B raz i l ian p r iva te sector. IFC ’s actions 
and presence during the crises o f the past fou r years strongly demonstrated the add i t iona l i ty o f I F C p rod - 
ucts and expertise in m idd le- income income countries such as B raz i l . The ab i l i ty to react qu ick ly in coun- 
te rcyc l ica l fash ion in t imes o f crisis has been valued b y bo th IFC clients and the B raz i l ian authorities. 

122. 
The p r iva te sector consultation con f i rmed that IFC’s serv ice i s valued n o t on ly f o r long-term 
financing but also f o r dissemination o f best practices in environmental, social, and corporate govem- 
ance practices; corporate and f inanc ia l restructuring; and pr iva t iza t ion advice, no tab ly in in fras truc ture . 
The O E G repor t found IFC to be re la t ive ly more responsive and w i t h more g loba l expertise than com- 
parator ins t i tu t ions . IFC ’s cred i t l ines have had impor tan t catalytic effects on in te rna t iona l f inanc ia l mar- 
kets, wh ich f o l l ow IFC ’ s interventions in emerging markets, as demonstrated b y the recent trade f inance 
fac i l i t ies in B r a z i l (Box 7). 

123. 
S im i la r ly , MIGA’s comparative advantage i s i t s ab i l i ty to enhance and scale up p r iva te sector 
investment through i t s po l i t ica l risk guarantees, thereby fac i l i ta t ing add i t iona l fo re ign investment and 
lend ing in B raz i l . 

124. 
The Bank ’s focus in this CAS i s on areas o f high likely impact on development results and on 
potential f o r scaling up. Because o f large needs and the strong re la t ionsh ip w i t h the government, de- 
mand f o r Bank technical, ins t i tu t iona l , and know ledge support far exceeds the capacity to de l iver . De - 
mand fo r f inanc ia l support i s affected b y l im i t e d f isca l space, but i s s t i l l po ten t ia l ly large compared w i t h 
the Bank ’s f inanc ing capacity. P r io r i ty w i l l go to ac t iv i t ies that most d i rec t ly and e f f ic ien t ly support B ra - 
z i l ’s development goals in key thematic areas and to ac t iv i t ies that have a scale impac t (because they are 
rep l icab le o r because they lead to the scaling up o f e f fec t ive activities). Fo r d irec t in te rven t ion in the pri- 
vate sector, through f inanc ia l support and know ledge transfer, the Bank Group’s p r ima ry cho ice o f in- 
struments remains IFC’s investment and noninvestment ac t iv i t ies and MIGA’s p o l i t i c a l risk guarantees 
f o r fo re ign investors. 

125. 

In selecting activities f o r Bank support, therefore, the f o l l ow i n g p r inc ip les app ly : 

0 The Bank w i l l support ac t iv i t ies w i t h c r i t ica l importance fo r ach iev ing development results and 
addressing the po l icy challenges iden t i f ied in this CAS. 

0 Ac t iv i t ies supported b y the Bank w i l l either con tr ibu te d i rec t ly to p o l i c y re fo rms needed to 
achieve the desired results (mos t ly at the na t iona l level), or he lp t o imp lemen t pro jec ts that bring 
d irec t development results, have ca ta ly t ic impacts, and are replicable and scalable (mos t ly at the 
subnational level). They w i l l thus have a strategic impac t that reaches w e l l beyond d irec t p ro jec t 
benefits. 

0 Bank-supported ac t iv i t ies w i l l demonstrate ownership and commitment o f the implementing 
government, as expressed, fo r example, in the budget and p r io r i t iza t ion o f the PPA at the federa l 
leve l o r equivalent p lann ing exercise at the state o r loca l leve l . 

0 The Bank Group w i l l support ac t iv i t ies that draw on i t s comparative advantage and add value to 
the work of other development partners. I t w i l l choose the most appropriate comb ina t ion o f in- 
struments to achieve the desired development result, including IBRD lend ing , AAA, capacity 
building, learn ing and know ledge dissemination, and I F C and MIGA support.

126. 
F o r the Bank, the CAS proposes programmatic selectivity, de f ined b y an in terven t ion ’s re le- 
vance to the country’s longer term goals rather than to more l im i t e d sectoral objectives. Rather than iso- 
la ted one-o f f interventions, programmatic selectivity aims at suppor t ing a group o f actions across sectors 
that con tr ibu te to a core development ob jec t ive over the med ium term. The approach i s systemic, r e l y i n g 
on p r io r i ty government programs and ins t i tu t ions and mov ing away f r o m the u s e o f Bank-dr iven agen- 
cies, procedures, and repo r t ing requirements. I t i s integrated, accoun t ing f o r in tersec tora l linkages and 
mov ing away f r om free-standing, single-sector projects. I t i s leveraged, seeking to catalyze e f f ic ien t use 
o f other ( inc lud ing government) resources and mov ing away f r om pro jec ts that do n o t mob i l ize other ac- 
tors. F ina l ly , i t i s results-oriented, focus ing on projects that can demonstrate a measurable con t r ibu t ion 
t o de f ined development outcomes and mov ing away f r om projects that cannot. 

127. W h i l e this means that the C A S encompasses ac t iv i t ies in a large number o f areas and sectors, 
these areas are in te r l inked and iden t i f ied as c r i t ica l fo r achieving the desired development outcomes. And 
many pub l ic p o l i c y areas in wh ich the Bank has no par t icu lar comparative advantage are l e f t out. In addi- 
tion, the areas selected f o r Bank support are prioritized according to the Bank’s comparative ad- 
vantage, so that in some cases the perceived urgency d i f fe rs f r om that o f the country, as i l lus t ra ted in Ta-

F. The CAS Results Framework 
128. 
The emerging results framework f o r the Bank Group’s CAS i s discussed in the f o l l ow sec- 
t ions (see also the attached ma t r ix in Annex 9 , and r e s u l t s mon i to r ing f ramewo rk in Annex 10). The ap- 
proach, to be imp lemen ted and re f ined over time, was constructed on the basis o f the longer te rm v is ion 
and goals (see Tab le 4) and the more near-term development plans, ou t l ined above. The results frame- 
wo rk defines med ium- term coun try outcomes towa rd these goals and the CAS-suppor ted actions to

achieve them. Progress toward the med ium- term outcomes-to wh ich the government and a l l i t s partners, 
inc lud ing the Bank Group, contribute-should be achievable w i t h i n the CAS pe r iod and capable o f be ing 
mon i to red using intermediate indicators. The r e s u l t s framework fur ther de f ines p lanned Bank ac t iv i t ies to 
con tr ibu te towards specific intermediate outcomes du r ing the CAS imp lemen ta t ion per iod . Tables 9-12 
summarize the m a i n elements o f the results framework f o r each CAS area. F ina l ly , performance ind ica - 
tors f o r the C A S lend ing cases are der ived f r om this results framework (Table 14). Progress within the 
f ramewo rk w o u l d be rev iewed during the proposed semi-annual j o i n t po l icy rev iews between the gov- 
ernment and the Bank ’s country team. 

129. As par t o f this effort, the Bank wou ld assist governments at the federal and subnational leve ls to 
strengthen their frameworks for better results-based management and budgeting and performance 
accoun tab i l i ty b y deve lop ing new f inanc ing incentives, in fo rma t ion systems, and human capacity. This 
w i l l im p l y greater use o f results-based contracts, de f in i t ion o f performance measures, and establishment 
o f robus t mon i to r ing and evaluation systems and capacities. The Bank wou ld support these e f for ts 
through targeted techn ica l assistance, p i l o t i n g use o f per formance- l inked f inanc ing ( through SWAps and 
other instruments), and j o i n t ana ly t ica l work . K e y Bank instruments to support results mon i to r ing inc lude

and AAA to states to strengthen the ir ab i l i ty to achieve specific development objectives. These are amb i- 
t ious pub l ic sector management reforms, and though they w i l l take some t ime to implement, they w i l l 
make possible a deepening o f the results-based framework in i t ia ted in this CAS . 

G. Instruments of the Bank Group Program 

130. 
The Bank Group’s a im i s to max im ize the value i t br ings to i t s c l ien t ins t i tu t ions-Braz i l ian gov- 
ernments and companies-through 
lending and advice. One o f the most critical operational barrier to 
financial support i s the reduced budget space for new and existing investments because of Brazil’s 
necessary pursuit of fiscal discipline and its budget rigidity. At the same time, despite recent im- 
provements in the current account, Braz i l ’s ex terna l f inanc ing needs are s t i l l pressing. With B raz i l ’s re- 
sponsible macro management and f isca l performance and sound ins t i tu t iona l and f iduc ia ry framework , 
there i s substantial scope f o r Bank support. The key challenge i s t o choose the right instruments f o r mak- 
ing funding available. This means d raw ing on emerging thinking on the spectrum o f Bank lend ing p rod - 
ucts (expanded use o f SWAps, poo l ing and performance-focused approaches) to ensure the greatest re- 
sponsiveness o f Bank programs to B raz i l ’s current constraints. I t also means wo rk ing closely with the 
government through po l icy dialogue to m in im ize the impac t o f these constraints, where that i s possible 
( fo r example, b y reduc ing budget execution r ig id i t ies ) . 

13 1. 
In close consu l ta t ion w i t h the federal and state governments, the Bank has re-or ien ted i t s support 
to focus on four core groups of activities. First, t o meet the need f o r balance o f payments f inanc ing and 
support f o r reforms, the Bank expects to continue policy-based programmatic adjustment lending 
(Box 9). Programmatic adjustment lending at the federa l level, complemented b y techn ica l assistance 
loans, w o u l d support the po l icy framework in the thematic and founda t ion areas o f the CAS . Some p ro - 
grammatic loans wou ld be broad in scope ( fo r example, cove r ing f isca l re forms rang ing f r o m macro- 
f isca l balance and structural reforms to pub l ic expenditure and pub l ic sector management issues). Rea l is- 
t ica l ly , progress w i l l no t be even across the entire program. Ind iv idua l loans, therefore, wou ld o f ten sup- 
po r t a c r i t ica l mass o f re fo rm actions achieved in on ly some o f the areas covered b y the program . Semi- 
annual j o i n t rev iews b y the country team and government w o u l d assess po l icy progress in key areas and 
p lan the nex t phases o f the support program. The Bank aims to keep policy-based lend ing at an upper 
bound o f 50 percent o f the CAS lend ing ce i l ing over the C A S per iod .

Box 9 . Enhanc ing the Use o f Innova t ive Lend ing Instrunients 

Policy-based (o r adjustment) lending aims to ga lvanke and support p o l i c y reforms. Exper ience shows that p ro - 
grammatic adjustment lending, wh ich shifts the emphasis to lend ing in response t o re form5 already enacted 
rather than cond i t ion ing loan disbursements on predefined government actions, increases countries’ comm i tmen t 
t o re forms . B raz i l ‘s external vu lnerab i l i ty makes the f l e x i b i l i t y o f programmatic lend ing especially advanta- 
geous. G i v e n the Bank ’s sma l l f inanc ia l role, such programs requ ire a strong lead f r o m the government. B r a z i l 
has so far established three progranmiatic policy-based lend ing programs supported b y the Bank : f isca l re form , 
financial-sector reform. and human development. T w o loans have been made under each o f the f i rs t tw o p r o - 
grams and one under the third. A new proposed program to support g row th and competitiveness po l ic ies w o u l d 
inc lude f inanc ia l sector po l ic ies . A new program to support sustainable development and na tura l resource man- 
agement i s also proposed. T h i s approach wou ld lead to one broad program o f p o l i c y based lend ing in each o f the 
C A S thematic areas and the foundations area. 

Like programmatic adjustment lending, poo led sectorwide approach (SWAP ) investment lend ing aims to in- 
crease commitment, impact, and f l e x i b i l i t y . T rad i t iona l investment loans disburse against spec i f ic spending 
categories and impose Bank procurement arid repor t ing requirements. In countries such as B raz i l , w i t h re la t ive ly 
strong f inanc ia l management and procurement ins t i tu t ions and capabilities at the federal leve l , poo led fund ing 
gives more f l e x i b i l i t y to investment lending. Bank resources are poo led w i th government funds and disbursed 
f r om the same account. Poo l ing opens the poss ib i l i ty of ty ing f inanc ing to results, so th is approach i s mos t e f fec- 
t ive i f l i n k e d to a robust results framework. Increasingly, acute spending restrictions have made this op t ion more 
a t trac t ive to B r a z i l and the Bank, as a way o f ensuring the smooth func t ion ing o f pro jec ts through f inanc ia l ly 
d i f t i c u l t periods. 

I n the con tex t o f the B r a z i l CAS ’s greater focus on programmatic approaches and leverag ing 0 ex is t ing country 
systems, Bank loan disbursement arrangements that take borrower performance into account are be ing ex- 
p lo red and cou ld be p i lo ted . Several models are be ing considered, among them, B a n k f inanc ing l i n k e d t o outputs 
(e.g., number of diplomas o r number o f e lec tr ic i ty connections), B a n k f inanc ing l i n k e d to m i d t e rm measures of 
benchmarked performance, and variable B a n k f inanc ing depending on targeting and m o n i t o r i n g systems im- 
provements. The models build upon and exceed the performance arrangements incorpora ted i n t o the B r a z i l 
F am i l y Hea l th Ex tens ion Project, b u t w o u l d u l t ima te ly recognize the need to base investment lend ing disburse- 
ments on actual expenditures so as to meet B a n k A r t ic les requirements. 

Th rough f inanc ia l guarantees the W o r l d B a n k G roup insures pr iva te sector investments against ceztain events. 
Par t ia l r isk guarantees are suitable fo r large-scale operations i n wh ich government performance o r regu la t ion i s a 
s ign i f ican t factor i n the pro jec t ’s attractiveness to the p r iva te sector. Par t ia l risk guarantees seem to b e we l l - 
suited to B raz i l ’s needs since i n certain sectors (water, energy, roads) investors have c i ted perce ived ins tab i l i t ies 
in the regulatory, legal, and j u d i c i a l environments as a reason for ho ld ing back. The B a n k G roup intends to ex- 
p lo re the possible use o f guarantees t o foster pub l ic -p r iva te partnerships, i n particulax f o r in fras truc ture p r o v i s i o n

132. 
Second, to increase the systemic benefits o f Bank support, sectorw ide approaches (SWAp s ) 
wou ld become a key investment lending moda l i ty , especially at the na t iona l leve l . SWAps r e l y on minis- 
tries and other government ins t i tu t ions that are already in place rather than on special-purpose p ro jec t im- 
p lemen ta t ion units, and they use ex is t ing coun try f iduc ia ry rules assessed as sound through diagnostic 
w o r k at the na t iona l leve l (paragraph 105). They also a l low the Bank to support ex is t ing government p ro - 
grams o f high p r io r i ty rather than ind iv idua l pro jec ts o r transactions. Cons ider ing B raz i l ’s l im i t e d f isca l 
space, this la t ter feature makes SWAps a po ten t ia l ly more e f fec t ive lend ing ins trumen t than t rad i t iona l 
investment lend ing in many cases. Through b o t h SWAps and t rad i t iona l investment lend ing the Bank 
wou ld seek t o p i l o t output-based and per formance- l inked approaches (Box 9 ) .

133. A j o i n t government-Bank wo rk ing group has rev iewed the government expenditure p rog ram as 
set out in the fede ra l Mu l t iyea r P lan (PPA) and defined a first group o f p r i o r i t y programs f o r Bank 
support th rough SWA p s f o r FY2004-05. The Bank i s also wo rk ing w i t h the govemmen t to iden t i fy fur- 
ther SWAP poss ib i l i t ies through the planned j o i n t Public Expend i ture Rev iew at the federal leve l . S im i la r 
exercises are p lanned at the state level, and state-level SWAps are also under consideration. The systemic 
benefits of SW A p s wou ld be bolstered through technical assistance components and we l l- in tegra ted p ro - 
grams o f learning, capacity building, and knowledge dissemination, inc lud ing by the WBI. 

134. With a stronger emphasis on SWAps, a strategy fo r strengthening B raz i l ’s a lready strong 
country p rocu remen t and f inanc ia l management systems assumes greater p r i o r i t y . Elements o f such a 
strategy for this CAS pe r iod wou ld include: (i) fur ther diagnostic wo rk at the subnational level, through 
add i t iona l procuremen t and f inanc ia l accountability assessments in a group o f states and selected mun ic i - 
pa l i t ies (consistent w i t h our evo lv ing strategies fo r support to these clients); (ii) p i l o t i n g the F inanc ia l 
Management Strategy instrument as a means to develop and agree on an ac t ion p l a n based on the conc lu- 
sions o f the recent C F A A ; and (iii) sector wo rk in procurement; as a veh ic le f o r d ia logue on con t inued 
reforms recommended in the CPAR . In addition, f iduc ia ry strengthening w o u l d b e mainstreamed i n t o the 
pub l ic sector management po l icy dialogue, through the Pub l ic Expend i ture Rev iew and perhaps through 
techn ica l assistance and adjustment support as we l l , in the con tex t o f pub l ic expend i ture management re- 
form. Deve lopmen t o f a new safeguards assessment t o o l cou ld he lp bring know ledge o f the safeguard 
systems to the same leve l as f iduc ia ry know ledge and p rov ide a p l a t f o rm f o r capacity and ins t i tu t ion 
building. Con t inued progress on p rog ram harmonization w i t h the IDB wou ld also be impor tan t f o r fur ther 
strengthening B raz i l ’s systems. 

135. As in the f iduc ia ry area, the Bank intends to wo rk increas ing ly w i t h na t iona l institutions and 
policy f ramewo rks f o r env ironmenta l assessment, management, and conservation and fo r social 
assessment ( inc lud ing po l ic ies on indigenous people, Afro-descendants, and resettlement). The legisla- 
t i o n in many o f these areas i s comparatively robust, and the ins t i tu t ions have sound techn ica l capacity and 
in fo rma t ion databases. The Bank wou ld undertake a rev iew o f the federa l and (as needed) state soc ia l and 
env ironmen ta l assessment frameworks (through a proposed “Safeguards Assessment”), to suggest areas 
for further strengthening. In the case o f discrepancies between B raz i l ian and B a n k policies, Bank po l ic ies 
wou ld apply. In the interim, the Bank wou ld consider p i l o t approaches using the country’s env ironmen ta l 
and soc ia l assessment framework, wh ich cou ld p lay a key ro le in mee t ing the env ironmen ta l and social 
assessment needs o f Bank operations. 

136. Third, building on progress over the last year, the Bank w i l l con t inue i t s ongo ing re lat ionsh ip 
w i t h subnational governments, wo rk ing in a more coordinated and in tegra ted fash ion in the states and 
mun ic ipa l i t ies where i t i s already active. Go ing forward, the Bank w i l l se lec t ive ly lend to c red i two r thy 
states, using t rad i t iona l investment lending, SWAps, and other instruments as appropriate. In the past 
year, the forma t ion o f Bank “state teams” led b y a state team coord ina tor (usua l ly a task manager w i t h a 
pro jec t in the state) and the development o f state assistance strategies have he lped to integrate ac t iv i t ies 
and thus to enhance the impac t in ind iv idua l states (Box 10). State strategies, based on in tens ive d ia logue 
w i t h the state’s economic team on development p r io r i t ies and goals, focus on the full array o f challenges 
and inc lude po l icy reviews, pub l ic expenditure and other economic analysis, and f iduc ia ry rev iews and 
related capacity building, as w e l l as other partners’ ac t iv i t ies in the state. 

137. 
The operational support to states wou ld build in cross-sectoral interconnect iv ity in a var ie ty o f 
ways, depending on the state. In smaller states the Bank w o u l d l i k e l y support one integrated p ro jec t to 
address a number o f state development pr ior i t ies . In larger states, the Bank c o u l d continue w i t h one o r 
more predominantly sectorally based operations, wh i le coo rd ina t ing the ir impac ts through the state strat- 
egy and the state team.

Box 11. T o w a r d a M o r e Equ itab le , Sustainable, and Competitive Northeast 
T h e Northeast i s home to 29 percent o f Brazil‘s population and 53 percent o f i t s poor (25 n l i l l i o n people below 
the poverty line). Through continuous rural-to-urban migration. the Northeast’s predominantly ru ra l poverty also 
reinforces t h e number o f poor in such urban areas outside the Northeast as Silo Paulo, R i a and Brasilia. Social 
indicators are also l e s s favorable i n the Northeast than elsewhere: per capita income i s barely ha l f o f Brxzil‘s; the 
average worker has 4.5 years o f schooling compared with 6.3 for Braz i l : infant mor ta l i ty rates are over 53 deaths 
per 1,000 l ive births compared w i th 30 for Braz i l . Tntraregional inequality i s an even more serious challenge, 
with great variation among states and c i t ies . Finally, while agriculture accounts for only 9 percent o f regional 
GDP i t employs 36 percent o f the workforce. The large numbers o f low-productivity rura l workers and sinall 
farmers contribute greatly to the poverty count i n the region and in B raz i l overall. 

The strategy fo r the Northeast envisions a more equitable, sustainable, and competitive future that requires ad- 
dressing the pernianence o f deep poverty and social and economic inequality w i th in the Northeast and compared 
w i th the rest o f Braz i l . 

Social sustainability (a more equitable Brazil). From a long-term perspective, development depends on educa- 
tion. Lack o f education i s closely associated w i th poverty and inequality. Priorities include early childhood edu- 
cation, universal provision o f high-quality priniary and secondary education, and capacity bu i ld ing at various 
levels. Also important are universal access to health services, water and sanitation, public safety, justice, and 
social safety ne ts (particularly important to protect the poor from drought i n the semi-arid Northeast). 

Enviroiiniental sustainability (a more sustainable Brazil). Traditionally, development plans in the Northeast 
have neglected the environment. Priorities are water resource management for more efficient use o f this scarce 
resource, land use planning in both rural and urban areas, prevention o f desertification, protection o f biodiver- 
sity, and institutional strengthening.

linked to p o l i c y and knowledge networks in B r a z i l w i t h the he lp o f WB I and the G loba l Distance Lea rn -

por ts on key economic and sectoral issues, o f ten developed in partnership w i t h l o c a l research ins t i tu t ions 
o r other partners. The CAS Comp le t ion Repor t concludes that selected ana ly t ica l pieces (on pensions and 
education, among others) have been among the most successful ac t iv i t ies over the las t several years, he lp- 
ing to build consensus on po l icy and p rog ram design. A strong AAA p rog ram w i l l con t inue to be a c r i t i - 
ca l complement to the Bank’s lending and techn ica l assistance. The AAA program i s designed to p lay a 
ca ta ly t ic ro le in assessing po l icy options and tradeoffs f o r the government (at federal and subnational lev - 
els) and setting the framework fo r p rog ram design. The Bank i s increas ing ly deve lop ing programma t ic

selected B r a z i l as one o f i t s foca l countries and has established arrangements w i t h l o c a l learn ing partners. 
The Bank has in i t ia ted a strong GDLN capacity in Braz i l , focused on outreach and imp rov ing the

phasizes a number o f cross-cutting issues, taking account o f reg iona l endowments and the importance o f 
strengthening ins t i tu t iona l capacity and par t ic ipa t ion to enhance accountability, transparency, and owner- 
ship. S im i la r ly , the Pr iva te Sector Strategy (Annex 5) takes a mu l t isec tora l approach--cutting across key 
sectoral issues relevant to pr iva te sector development. 

145. 
The thematic areas o f focus are over la id w i t h a spatial dimension and explicit regional strate- 
gies to guide Bank activities. Consistent w i t h the C A E finding that the Bank’s targe t ing o f support to the 
poorer Northeast has had an impor tan t impact, the Bank w i l l continue i t s strategic focus there. A No r th - 
east strategy lays ou t the specific approach (Box 11). In response to g row ing interest f r o m the federal and 
state governments, the Bank wou ld increasingly focus on the N o r t h and i s wo rk ing with the government 
through i t s AmazBnia Sus ten t ive l strategy (Box 12). These reg iona l strategies w i l l build on and in f luence 
state strategies. 

146. G iven the depth and scale o f Bank support to Brazil, the need t o adjust to the evo lv ing p r io r i - 
t i e s o f the government, and the evo lv ing f isca l situation in different states and mun ic ipa l i t ies , i t i s neither 
feasible no r desirable to present in this CAS a f ina l l i s t o f tasks fo r the nex t fou r years. Instead, this sec- 
t i o n lays out the areas that are envisaged as pr ior i t ies fo r Bank support. I l lus t ra t ive lend ing and AAA p ro - 
grams are described be low (see also the ind ica t ive program tables in Annexes B 3 and B4 ) . 

A M o r e Equitable Brazil: Investing in People 
147. 
The Bank’s strategy fo r support fo r a more equitable B raz i l , highlights o f wh ich are shown in Ta- 
ble 9 and discussed in greater de ta i l below, closely m i r ro rs the p r io r i t ies o f the federal government, wh ich 
has made social progress w i t h economic s tab i l i ty the cornerstone o f i t s program and the PPA. At the 
subnational level, imp rov ing welfare and empower ing people are also at the heart o f state and loca l de- 
velopment strategies. Support in the social sectors wou ld be focused on reaching the poorest and achiev- 
ing h igher levels o f qua l i ty and e f f ic iency in social services. 

148. 
The Human Development Programmatic Sector Reform Loan series wou ld be the Bank ’s 
flagship vehicle fo r supporting improvements in health, education, and social p ro tec t ion po l icy frame- 
works at the na t iona l leve l . This p rog ram (first loan in FY2003) w o u l d be complemented b y investment 
loans at federal, state, and loca l leve ls (see below). Depend ing on r e f o rm progress, several add i t iona l 
loans w i t h i n this series cou ld be made during the CAS period, w i t h d i f fe ren t areas o f emphasis w i t h i n a 
broad and ambitious re fo rm agenda. Planned technical assistance loans wou ld support reforms, focus ing 
especially on mon i to r ing and evaluation o f key social programs and on ins t i tu t iona l capacity building. 

149. Building on the recommendations o f the CAE , support to education w i l l be a key p r io r i ty . Im- 
p rov ing education qua l i ty and outcomes wou ld continue to focus on basic education, w i t h increasing in- 
volvement in secondary education, early c h i l d development, and h ighe r education. The Bank ’s ana ly t ic 
wo rk i s l i k e l y to be increasingly programmatic; a key focus cou ld be a rev iew o f education po l ic ies over 
the last decade. The Bank wou ld support a mode l f o r ear ly c h i l d education at the l o c a l leve l through a 
p i l o t in R i o de Janeiro Mun ic ipa l i ty . I f successful, this cou ld be scaled up to other c i t ies and perhaps a 
na t iona l program. The Bank may support a fo l low -up to the successful Fundescola series. A h igher educa- 
t i o n student loan pro jec t and a science and technology pro jec t are poss ib i l i t ies to build s k i l l s fo r a modern 
economy, f o l l ow i n g AAA on s k i l l s and know ledge issues. In higher education, there i s scope f o r synergy 
w i t h I F C through i t s possible support o f broadened access to pr iva te un ive rs i ty and voca t iona l tra in ing . 
These projects wou ld also contribute to the objective o f a more compe t i t ive B raz i l . 

150. 
In health, the Bank wou ld continue to support imp roved qua l i ty and equ i ty o f na t iona l disease 
surveillance through the Disease Surveillance and Con t ro l pro jec t (V IG ISUS II), an adaptable p rog ram

Med ium-s ize cities are among the fastest g row ing in B r a z i l . Like a l l cities, they lack access t o adequate domestic 
f inanc ing f o r l o c a l investments. The strategy w i l l l i k e l y emphasize a wholesale approach rather than d i rec t lend-

strategic secondary c i t ies in these, states: reg iona l on lend ing through reg iona l f inanc ia l intermediaries; na t iona l 
on lend ing through national f inanc ia l intermediaries; and lend ing t o consortia o f mun ic ipa l i t ies through cred i t 
un ion arrangement. 

SnraZZ cities and towns generally lack f inanc ia l capacity. With the excep t ion o f some specific investment p r o -

Box 15. P i lo t P r o g r am to Conserve the R a in Forest 

The , B a n k i s the coord ina tor o f the P i l o t Program to Conserve the B raz i l ian Ra in Forest (RFPP), created in 1992 
at the in i t ia t ive o f the G-7 , and trustee o f i t s trust fund (WT ) . In ip lemen ta t ion began in 1995, and the program i s 
on the thresho ld o f a second phase. W i t h comm i t ted and pledged resources o f US$350 m i l l i o n , the RFPP acts 

through large ly experimental projects meant to show the way toward larger initiatives that cou ld be ma in- 

streamed. 

The RFPP has he lped to strengthen e,nvironinental agencies and management i n mos t o f t h e Lega l Amazon states 
and demarcated some 45 m i l l i o n hectares of’ indigenous lands (I 0 percent o f the Amazon). I t has supported more 
than 200 (mos t ly commun i ty) in i t ia t ives related to new forms o f land use and conservation, inc lud ing manage- 
ment o f forest and aquatic resources; strengthened extractive reserves; helped create eco log ica l corr idors i n the 
Amazon and A t lan t ic Forests; helped rehabilitate science centers and support d irec ted research; and supported 
NGO networks. L o c a l ownership o f the’ program has also increased, w i t h the government assuming program 
leadership b y the end o f the f i rs t phase. 

The second phase should be an integral part of the government’s AmazSn ia Siistentrivel program supported b y 

B raz i l ’s in terna t iona l partners. The B a n k believes that this can he done mos t e f fec t ive ly through:

The Bank wou ld con t inue to support states’ e f for ts t o imp rove land use and management in ru-

community-based approach to imp rove access to land in the r u r a l Northeast (CrCdito Fund iar io) has had 
substantial results and cou ld be continued o r expanded under a program o f broader support f o r fam i ly ag-

P ro t e c t ing forests a n d b iod ive rs i ty has been a key element in the Bank ’s strategy f o r more than 
a decade, through par t ic ipa t ion in the P i l o t Program to Conserve the B raz i l ian R a i n Fores t (RFPP). The 
Bank wou ld con t inue to manage the RFF’P t r u s t fund as the program moves in to a second phase (see B o x 
15). The Bank has prepared a con t r ibu t ion t o the government’s Amazon Strategy (described above), 
wh ich w i l l generally guide the Bank’s wo rk in the Amazon region. The government has also requested 
Bank assistance to support a new Na t iona l Forest Program. A forest loan ( l ike ly an APL) w o u l d a im at

In addition, GEF-supported projects fo r the Cerrado and Caatinga are possible, as w e l l as a p i l o t in i t ia t ive 
on b iod ive rs i ty pro tec t ion in areas w i t h indigenous populations. The Bank can support the conservation

I Box 16. IFC Exposure Constraint 
The d i f f icu l t ies faced by Brazilian f i rm in accessing capital have led to a 
h igh sustained demand for IFC financing since the, m id- 1990s. Responding 
to this demand, while turning down large numbers o f proposals, IFC kept i t s 
B raz i l disbursed por t fo l io close to the single country exposure guideline o f 
12 percent o f total portfolio, but remained we l l w i th in the 25 percent o f net 
worth single-country exposure prudential limit. As a t June 30, 2003, IFC‘s 
disbursed exposure (net o f specific reserves) stood at $1.1 b i l l ion . repre,sent- 
i t i g 11 percent o f IFC’s total disbursed por t fo l io (net o f spe,cific reserves) 
and 15.5 percent o f 1FC’s net worth (plus general reserves).

189. With the s lowdown in commitments and disbursements f r om inves tmen t loans, Bank exposure to 
B r a z i l increased only modestly during the last CAS period, f r om US$7 .6 b i l l i o n in June 2000 to US$8.6 
b i l l i o n in June 2003. W i t h large p r inc ipa l repayments due in FY2004 and FY2005 , there i s r o om to sub- 
stantially increase lending to B r a z i l du r ing this CAS per iod . Lend ing w o u l d have to support the imp le -

The scale o f f inanc ia l support during the C A S pe r iod wou ld be de term ined p r ima r i ly b y govem-

the basis fo r f inanc ia l support in the h igher range o f the base case o f US$6-7.5 b i l l i o n . Po l ic ies 
wou ld p rov ide a high l ike l ihood o f economic sus ta inab i l i ty and rap id progress towa rd the desired

good po l icy and imp lemen ta t ion performance c o u l d be front-loaded, with up to US$2.2 b i l l i o n 
during each o f tw o years and lowe r thereafter. This lend ing range c o u l d be adjusted upwa rd 
through good po r t fo l io performance and cance l la t ion o f undisbursed commitments, observ ing the 
Bank’s concentration limit o f US$13.5 b i l l ion . Ad jus tmen t lend ing ove r the CAS pe r iod cou ld

wou ld be managed between US$8 and US$10 b i l l i o n . Ad jus tmen t lend ing over the C A S pe r iod

ANNEX 1: “A Brazil fo r All” - Brazil’s 2004-2007 Multi-Year Plan (PPA) 

BACKGROUND 

B raz i l ’s 1988 Cons t i tu t ion requires the use o f three ma in instruments to gu ide f isca l and pub l ic 
expenditure management: (a) the Mu l t i -Yea r Plan, o r P lano P lu r ianua l (PPA); (b) the L a w o f Budge t Di- 
rectives (LDO) ; and (c) annual budget laws (LOA ) . The PPA i s a four-year p lan to be produced b y each 
new ly elected government at the beg inn ing o f i t s four-year mandate. The PPA i s approved b y the na- 
t iona l Congress. The nature and scope o f the PPA have changed since first in i t ia ted in the la te 1980s, but 
the current government proposal modeled in a s im i lar fash ion to the previous PPA. 

OBJECTIVES AND SCOPE OF THE 2004-2007 PPA 

The Executive’s proposal fo r the 2004-2007 P P A has just been f ina l ized and sent t o Congress. 
Entitled “A B r a z i l fo r A l l” (“P lano Brasil Para Todos”), the PPA aims at progress a long f i v e “dimen- 
sions:” economic, social, regional, environmental and democratic. These in ter-re la ted strategic p r io r i t ies 
a re re f lec ted in the PPA’s three core “macro” objectives: 

(a) enhanced social inclusion and reduction of inequality; 
(b) economic growth ( 5 percent target f o r 2007) tha t i s environmentally sustainable and reduces 
regional inequalities; and 

(c) p romo t ion citizenship and participation, con t r ibu t ing to better governance and pub l ic sector 
management. 

Subm i t ted to Congress in September and expected to be approved b y November 2003, the new 
PPA lays out a program o f approximately US $ l 5 0 b i l l i o n annua l ly over fou r years. E x p l i c i t l y recogniz- 
ing Braz i l ’s budget r ig id i t ies and lack o f f isca l space, i t i s framed in f inanc ia l terms consistent w i t h the 
country’s revenue projections. I t also re l ies on pruden t ex terna l bo r row ing and seeks t o max im ize p r iva te 
sector financing, in par t icu lar in the area o f in fras truc ture investments key to grow th . N e w elements in 
this PPA are the reg iona l focus, and a strong element consu l ta t ion w i t h c i v i l society, inc lud ing “participa- 
t i o n forums” in each o f the country’s 27 states (below). 

Ano ther innovation, the new PPA i s results-focused. Each o f the three “macro” objectives i s b ro - 
ken down i n t o ten o r so “challenges.” Each o f these 3 0 challenges has a group o f target ind ica tors - 
achievable b y 2007 - wh ich become the key dr ivers o f the PPA (Tables 1 and 2). Eve ry one o f the PPA’s 
374 ind iv idua l “programs” i s a l igned towa rd mee t ing one o r the 30 challenges and the i r spec i f ic target 
ind ica tors . The strong p r io r i ty allocated t o the soc ia l inc lus ion agenda i s re f lec ted in funding plans: soc ia l 
programs dominate planned PPA spending (57 percent), fo l lowed b y g row th or ien ted programs (33 per- 
cent), and pa r t ic ipa t ion (10 percent). 

MAIN FEATURES OF THE 2004-2007 ‘‘PLAN0 BRASIL PARA TODOS” PPA 

The PPA i s p r ima r i ly an instrument f o r the strategic a l loca t ion o f the federa l government’s budg- 
etary resources. I t shares some characteristics o f the med ium - te rm expenditure f ramewo rk (or budge t ing 
in a mu l t i-year framework) used b y many O ECD countries. However, i t has features tha t make i t d i f fe r - 
ent and unique. The f o l l ow i n g are the ma in characteristics o f the 2004-2007 PPA a long w i t h selected 

60

comparisons o f the features o f the new PPA and i t s predecessor, the “Advance B raz i l ” ( “ A v a n p B ras i l ” ) 
PPA o f 2000-2003, produced in 1999: 

0 The en t ire Federal budget fo r the fou r years covered i s broken d ow n i n t o several hundred d i f fe r - 
en t “programs” (374 fo r the proposed 2004-2007 PPA compared w i t h 388 f o r the 2000-2003 
PPA). Examples o f programs f o r the 2004-2007 PPA a re “Cond i t iona l Income Transfers” (ad- 
dressing the government’s e f for ts to p rov ide income transfers to a l l poo r households using a uni- 
fied income transfer scheme) and “Maintenance o f the Federal Road Ne two rk . ” Each p rog ram 
has one o r more specific goals, and ind ica t ive funding i s specified ( fo r each p rog ram ra ther than 
fo r each organizational unit or government body). The r e s u l t p r inc ip le dr ives this: resource a l lo - 
ca t ion shou ld be based on the pursuit o f objectives rather than on the no t ion tha t each government 
body shou ld receive some specified share o f the to ta l resources. 

0 The monetary amounts allocated to the PPA programs are consistent w i t h macroeconom ic and 
revenue pro jec t ions f o r the fou r years covered b y the PPA, wh ich take i n t o account the govern- 
ment’s f isca l commitments over the pe r iod (i.e. in the case o f the 2004-2007 PPA, ma in ta in ing a 
p r ima ry pub l ic sector surplus o f 4.25 percent o f GDP every year). The a i m here i s to avo id lack o f 
f isca l realism. 

0 

In add i t ion to the consistency o f the PPA w i t h macroeconomic pro jec t ions and the government’s 
f isca l commitments, annual budge t ing du r ing each PPA pe r iod i s done using the f ramewo rk o f 
programs and c lass i f ica t ion established b y the PPA. In this and other ways, there i s an e x p l i c i t at- 
tempt to br idge the ins t i tu t iona l gap - common wo r ldw ide - between p lann ing and budge t ing . 

0 F o r some programs, e.g. those dea l ing w i t h infrastructure, the PPA also states expected amounts 
o f funding f r om sources other than the Federal government, e.g. f r o m state governments o r the 
pr iva te sector. Thus, the PPA attempts no t on ly to better use budgetary resources, but to mob i l ize 
p r iva te sector and ex terna l f inanc ing . 

0 

In each PPA, the programs are embedded in a framework that lays ou t a set o f ove ra l l “mega- 
objectives” and “macro-objectives”. The framework i s h ierarch ica l ; under each mega-ob jec t ive i s 
a set o f macro-objectives, and under each macro-objective i s a set o f programs. In the case o f the 
2004-2007 PPA, merged i n t o the framework i s the concept o f “dimensions.” The use o f this type 
o f framework underlines the fac t that the PPA i s no t just a t o o l f o r budge t ing o r f o r resource a l lo - 
cations; i t i s also a strategic device used to guide the country’s ove ra l l development. I t i s also 
used b y the government to build support fo r key proposals, and to commun ica te these to society. 

0 Each program has a set o f clear goals, with performance ind ica tors o r targets specified, so as to 
foster a cu l ture o f performance-orientation. Fo r example, fo r the p rog ram “Cond i t iona l Income 
Transfers,’’ the target i s to ensure that 12.7 m i l l i o n poor fam i l ies rece ive income transfers in 2007, 
inc lud ing a l l fam i l ies w i t h per-capita mon th ly incomes l e s s than R$lOO. F o r the p rog ram “Ma in - 
tenance o f the Federal Road Ne twork ,” the targets are that 43,000 km o f roads shou ld be ma in - 
tained annually, and that in add i t ion 23,000 km o f road leng th shou ld be restored. 

0 Each program has a manager, who i s in charge o f ensuring that the per formance ind ica tors are at- 
tained. This builds on the 2000-2003 PPA’s e f fo r ts to foster clear accoun tab i l i ty . An e x p l i c i t ob- 
jec t ive o f the prev ious PPA was a more integrated approach and move away f r o m the t rad i t iona l 
v iew o f government respons ib i l i t ies d iv ided a long organ iza t iona l unit lines. Thus managers o f ten 

A M o r e Equitable, Sustainable, and Compe t i t ive B r a z i l - Coun try Assistance Strategy 2003-2007 

61 

needed t o seek the cooperation o f other program managers in other agencies. I t i s l i k e l y that the 
new PPA w i l l also stress this integrated approach in implementation. 

0 There i s a strong emphasis on the u s e o f in fo rma t ion systems in the imp lemen ta t ion o f the PPA. 
A computer ne twork interlinks a l l program managers and partners, to a l l ow immed ia te access to 
in fo rma t ion concerning a l l projects. The a im i s t o enable these lead actors to share in fo rma t ion , 
promo te partnerships and iden t i fy impediments to ach iev ing goals. 

0 

In l i n e w i t h the emphasis on performance, the PPA has an annual process whereby each p rog ram 
manager has to evaluate progress and discuss the evo lu t ion o f the program’s performance ind ica - 
tors. The ensuing reports are made available, f o r each program, on the Internet. These self- 
assessments enhance transparency and force the p rog ram manager to discuss the progress o r l a c k 
thereof regard ing the performance indicators, as w e l l as the prob lems faced in p rog ram imp le - 
mentation. 

0 A l though the PPA i t s e l f does no t p r io r i t ize among the d i f fe ren t programs, the L a w o f Budge t Di- 
rectives (LDO) specifies a number o f “strategic programs” each year. In pr inc ip le , these p ro - 
grams g ive an idea o f the re la t ive importance p laced b y the government o n d i f fe ren t programs. 

0 Am o n g the key pr inc ip les o f the PPA are the fos ter ing o f transparency and inc lus ion o f c i v i l soci- 
ety. The la t ter i s especially emphasized b y the curren t government, w h i c h wen t to great lengths t o 
inc lude d i f fe ren t members o f c i v i l society in the discussions that l e d t o the fo rmu la t ion o f the 
2004-2007 PPA. Du r ing the process o f fo rmu la t ing the 2004-2007 PPA, great emphasis was 
p laced on ob ta in ing par t ic ipa tory input f r om d i f fe ren t members o f society, much more so than f o r 
the prev ious PPA . This was ma in ly done through 27 “Forums o f Soc ia l Par t ic ipa t ion” - one in 
each state (and the Federal D is tr ic t) . The forums invo lved 4738 par t ic ipan ts in total, represent- 
ing 2170 organizations including urban and ru ra l labor unions, business groups, churches, soc ia l 
bodies and non-governmental organizations. Var ious themes were covered, such as health, educa- 
tion, the environment and culture, among others. The discussions had a s ign i f ican t impac t o n the 
choice o f macro-objectives in the PPA, as w e l l as o n the selection o f programs, actions and p ro - 
gram performance targets. 

COMPARISON OF THE 2000-2003 AND 2004-2007 PPAS 

Compar ing the tw o PPAs (see Tab le 3), i t i s clear that there i s a l o t o f s im i la r i ty between the sets 
o f macro-objectives fo r the 2000-2003 and 2004-2007. There are a few differences, however, that stand 
out. One o f these i s the ob jec t ive “Expand and imp rove income transfer schemes f o r poo r fam i l ies” in the 
2004-2007 PPA wh ich i s new; there i s no th ing s im i la r in the prev ious PPA. This re f lec ts the emphasis 
placed b y the new government on a u n i f i e d and expanded income transfer scheme as a key component o f 
i t s social pro tec t ion strategy, and illustrates the use o f the PPA to highlight and promo te key goals o f a 
new government. 

Ano ther nove l ty o f the new PPA’s macro-objectives i s the emphasis p laced on social issues such 
as land reform, gender and rac ia l equality, and soc ia l inc lus ion o f ind igenous people (see macro- 
objectives 9, 10, 14 and 23). Soc ia l inc lus ion i s also reflected, in a d i f fe ren t way, in the new macro- 
ob jec t ive o f a id ing sma l l and med ium enterprises (see macro-ob jec t ive 21). In addition, the new PPA in- 
cludes macro-objectives re la ted to governance and fighting co r rup t ion (see macro-objectives 28 and 29). 
A l l o f this re f lec ts some o f the stated p r io r i t ies o f the new government. In accordance w i t h these p r i o r i - 
ties, the new government has also emphasized soc ia l inc lus ion in the fo rmu la t ion o f the PPA i tse l f , as dis- 
cussed in the nex t section.

A More Equitable, Sustainable, and Competitive B r a z i l - Country Assistance Strategy FY2003-2007 

In terms o f the macro-objectives related to economic growth, there i s one new ob jec t ive that 
stands out in the 2004-2007 PPA, wh ich i s the desire to expand and imp rove domestic cap i ta l markets 
(see ob jec t ive 12). In v iew o f the current constraints to domestic bo r row ing - in par t icu lar , the high 
spreads between lend ing and bo r row ing rates -this represents an impor tan t inc lus ion in the new PPA. 

U l t ima te ly , o f course, i t i s no t enough to l i s t macro-objectives; su f f ic ien t funds must also be a l lo - 
cated to each. A limited analysis o f the 2004-2007 PPA shows that - at least in some cases - new pro- 
grams have indeed been created to address some o f the new macro-objectives that were no t in the p rev i - 
ous PPA. One o f these i s the program “Cond i t iona l Income Transfers”, fo r wh ich R$3 1.94 b i l l i o n i s a l lo - 
cated (over fou r years) in the new PPA; this i s a larger amoun t than fo r most programs. Other new p ro - 
grams, w i t h no equivalent in the previous PPA and wh ich address the new macro-objectives in the new 
PPA, inc lude “Correc t ion W i t h i n the Federal Execu t ive” (w h i c h tackles government corruption); “Promo- 
t i o n o f Pub l ic E th ics” (wh ich addresses governance issues) ; “Gender Po l icy” , “Gender Equa l i ty in W o r k 
Relations”; and “Policy fo r the Promo t ion o f Rac ia l Equa l i ty” . 

F ina l ly , a few aspects are wo r th no t ing regard ing the treatment o f in fras truc ture in the new PPA. 
First, in l i n e w i t h the government’s stated desire to increase public investment w h i c h has been l o w re- 
cen t ly (2.6 percent o f GDP in 1999), the new PPA allocates R$297 b i l l i o n over the four-year pe r iod - 
f r om a l l sources, inc lud ing pub l ic banks, sub-national governments and the p r iva te sector - fo r in fras truc- 
ture. As a rough guide, us ing the PPA ’s targets fo r i n f l a t i o n and economic growth,” the amount o f in f ra - 
structure spending allocated wou ld amount to about 4 percent o f the to ta l GDP f o r the pe r iod . In add i t ion , 
the new PPA allocates R$5.5 b i l l i o n f o r the program “Maintenance o f the Federa l Road Ne two rk ” ; this 
same p rog ram (w i t h the same purpose) was inc luded in the prev ious PPA, and was a l loca ted R$3.7 b i l l i o n 
(in 2003 dollars). The increase i s meant to address the urgen t need po in ted ou t b y many to reverse signifi- 
cant decay that has occurred in the coun try ’s h ighway road ne twork . 

l7 For years 2004,2005,206 and 2007, these are respectively 7.5%, 5%, 4.5% and 4% fo r in f la t ion using the IGP-D I 
index; and 3.5%, 4%, 4.5% and 5% fo r economic growth.

Summary 

This document contains the Reg iona l Department’s evaluation o f the con t r ibu t ion o f the Bank ’s p rog ram in B r a z i l 
du r ing the prev ious CAS pe r iod (2000-2003). I t concludes that the CAS structure and con ten t were consistent w i t h 
the government p rog ram and the country’s l o n g term goals, a l though the government p laced greater emphasis on 
infrastructure than the Bank du r ing this period. I t further concludes that the B a n k p r o g r am ove ra l l made a satisfac- 
to ry con t r ibu t ion to Braz i l ’s development, despite the fact that coun try progress during the p e r i o d f e l l be low i n i t i a l 
expectations in some areas, no tab ly economic growth. 

Areas o f success were the p r i o r i t y pillars selected b y the CAS , namely programs o f d i rec t pove r ty reduc t ion 
(par t icu lar ly hea l th and education) and support to f isca l reforms. On the first o f these tw o pillars, B a n k impac t was 
highest on hea l th and education, less pronounced on social pro tec t ion . I n health, the p o o l e d sector-wide lend ing 
approach was a successful innovation. On the second pillar, Bank impac t was h ighes t on macroeconomic 
management, less pronounced on the qua l i ty o f pub l ic expenditures. Programmatic lend ing i s a useful new 
instrument that has strengthened the Bank ’s dialogue on macro management, and c o u l d b e app l ied more w ide ly . 
Soc ia l p ro tec t ion and the qua l i ty o f spending are b o t h areas that n ow deserve greater emphasis. 

Despite a w ide array o f investment lending, adjustment lend ing ( f inanc ia l and energy sectors), and AAA pu rsu ing 
the g row th agenda, the Bank ’s program had insu f f ic ien t impac t on g row th in the pe r iod (beyond the pos i t ive effects 
o f stabilization). I n par t icu lar , v i t a l re forms to the regu la tory environment did no t progress. 

In the tw o rema in ing pillars o f the 2000 CAS , governance and env ironmen ta l management, progress has been 
m ixed . On governance, the Bank p rog ram has been deliberately cautious and selective, and the Bank ’s con t r ibu t ion 
has been slight. On environmental management, although coun try progress has been o n l y moderate, the B a n k has a 
large p rog ram inc lud ing i t s executive r o l e in donor- funded in i t ia t ives , and impor tan t successes have occurred in 
those areas the B a n k has focused on. 

Ove ra l l the repo r t judges that the B a n k made a s ign i f ican t con t r ibu t ion to B r a z i l i a n deve lopmen t in 2000-2003, par- 
t icu la r ly in the f i rs t tw o pillars, where the CAS prom ised t o focus the Bank’s e f for ts and resources. This conc lus ion 
i s consonant w i t h the f ind ings o f the recent Coun try Assistance Eva lua t ion (CAE ) and - a l though the C A E assesses 
t h e longer p e r i o d o f 1990-2002 - the Comp le t ion Repor t draws on the C A E approach and findings. Increased strate- 
g ic focus on the Northeast and on the re la t ionsh ip w i t h the states has p a i d dividends, as has con t inued acknow l- 
edgement o f the cen tra l r o l e o f f isca l management in B r a z i l today. The harder issues o f de ta i led p u b l i c spending 
analysis, im p r o v i n g the m icroeconom ic environment fo r grow th , b u i l d i n g ins t i tu t ions t o tack le exc lus ion and v i o - 
lence, and the execu t ion on the ground o f environmental p ro tec t ion are some o f the key challenges f o r the nex t C A S 
per iod . 

This repor t represents a self-assessment o f the W o r l d Bank’s con t r ibu t ion in B r a z i l during the las t 
C A S pe r iod (2000-2003). Part A discusses to what extent the CAS was a l igned with coun try p r io r i t ies and 
long - te rm goals. Part B looks at coun try performance over the CAS period, and tr ies to the extent poss ib le

PART A - LONG-TERM STRATEGIC GOALS 

B raz i l ’s Mu l t iyea r P lan (PPA) lays out the Federa l Government’s na t iona l development strategy 
every 4 years. The 2000-2003 PPA ” d i f fe red f r om i t s predecessor in that i t accounted f o r a l l federal 
spending, rather than on ly core investments. I t i s therefore a good representation o f federa l government 
strategy, although i t should be no ted that many investments, incentives, and recurren t expenditures are 
undertaken b y states and mun ic ipa l i t ies . Desp i te the existence o f state PPAs, i t i s hard t o evaluate the co l - 
lec t ive e f fec t o f these strategies fo r the coun try as a whole. Moreover, the no t ion o f a development strat- 
egy encompasses po l ic ies as w e l l as spending, and here i t i s perhaps easier to base ou r analysis on actions 
rather than government documents. 

The 2000 PPA was based on a techn ica l “Axes Study” o f B raz i l ’s geographic bottlenecks (in 
many cases log is t ica l) imped ing economic grow th , lg wh ich de f ined p r io r i ty (pub l ic and private) inves t- 
ments o f 3 17 b i l l i o n r e d s over e igh t years, inc lud ing in fras truc ture (186 b i l l ion ) , soc ia l development (1 13 
b i l l ion ) , environment (16 b i l l ion ) and in fo rma t ion and know ledge (2 b i l l ion ) . Federa l spending i s grouped 
in to 365 programs, each w i t h an objective, a set o f actions, and performance ind ica tors . 

The 2000 PPA de f ined s ix long- term strategic goals: 

1. The conso l ida t ion o f economic s tab i l i ty w i t h sustained growth; 

2. The p romo t ion o f sustainable development f o r emp loymen t and income; 

3. The f igh t against pover ty and p romo t ion o f c i t izensh ip and social inc lus ion ; 

4. The conso l ida t ion o f democracy and human rights; 

5. The reduc t ion o f in ter-reg iona l inequalities; and 

6. The p romo t ion o f the rights o f m ino r i t ies and v ic t ims o f d iscr im ina t ion . 

B y comparison, the Bank’s 2000 CAS2’ was based on a f ive-pronged f ramewo rk that was consis- 
tent w i t h the PPA goals, though no t iden t ica l in structure: 

“AvanGa Bras i l , ” 2000, Ministry o f Planning, Budget, and Management, Federal Government o f Brazil. 

“Estudo dos Eixos Nacionais de IntegraGiio e Desenvolvimento, ” 1999, Ministry o f Planning, Budget, and Man-

1. D i rec t pover ty reduc t ion and social development; 

2. F isca l s tab i l i ty ; 

3. Econom ic development and growth; 

4. Development effectiveness (the performance o f pub l ic institutions); and 

5. Env ironmen t and na tura l resource management. 

Within these f i v e themes, the first two were g iven p r io r i ty . Pover ty reduc t ion i s the ove r r id ing ob- 
jec t ive o f Bank assistance, wh i le f isca l s tab i l i ty was deemed to be o f such immed ia te urgency tha t i t war- 
ranted special treatment: a loss o f f isca l d isc ip l ine wou ld have had an immed ia te and long - las t ing impac t 
on pover ty rates. 

I t can be seen that the Bank’s assistance strategy was in l i n e w i t h the Governmen t ’s long - te rm 
strategy, w i t h certain differences o f emphasis. The ma in common elements c o u l d b e summarized as f o l - 
lows : 

0 B o t h the 2000 C A S and the PPA accepted the fundamental importance o f pove r ty reduc t ion as a 
p r ima ry goa l o f economic development. 

0 B o t h made exp l ic i t the reg iona l dimension o f poverty, c i t i n g the worse soc ia l performance o f the 
N o r t h and Northeast regions, and adopted region-specific responses to suppo r t lagg ing regions. 

0 B o t h emphasized the importance o f a sustainable approach to na tura l resources and the env iron- 
ment, although in this area the Bank ’s re la t ive ly cautious approach was in l i n e w i t h government 
po l icy . 

0 B o t h emphasized the importance o f social inc lus ion and empowerment as impo r tan t goals o f pub- 
l i c po l icy . 

The ma in differences between the Bank ’s strategy and the Government’s c o u l d be summarized as 
fo l lows : 

Econom ic g row th was g iven greater d irec t importance b y the government p rog ram (as was there- 
fore, imp l ic i t ly , the in ter- l inkage between g row th and stability), espec ia l ly in fras truc ture inves t- 
ment, as evidenced b y the geo-economic approach to the “removal o f l o g i s t i c a l barriers” in the 
Axes Study. The Bank recognized the in terac t ion between growth, pover ty , and s tab i l i ty in B r a z i l 
in the 2000 CAS, but made a strategic decision to g ive precedence t o f i s c a l management. 

The CAS did no t discuss democracy and human rights (in do ing so i t f o l l o w e d Bank prac t ice in 
many other countries). 

The CAS made exp l ic i t the cross-cutting theme o f the effectiveness o f pub l ic ins t i tu t ions , 
whereas this ob jec t ive was im p l i c i t in the government’s o w n program, woven throughout the 
PPA. 

72 

A More Equitable, Sustainable, and Competitive Brazil - Country Assistance Strategy FY2003-2007 

0 The C A S took a more cautious approach to the themes o f m ino r i ty rights and d iscr im ina t ion . This 
need n o t im p l y c r i t ic ism o f the Bank : arguably the approach was appropr ia te ly cautious, since the 
emphasis placed b y B raz i l ian governments on these questions was re la t ive ly recent. 

O f these differences, the w i thdrawa l f r om large-scale in fras truc ture lend ing represented the most 
s ign i f ican t divergence f r om government pr ior i t ies . I t was large ly d r iven b y the expec ta t ion tha t p r iva te 
investment wou ld meet infrastructure needs, and b y the recogn i t ion that conce ivab le lend ing volumes 
f r om the Bank wou ld no t have made much difference. A l though the expectations o f p r iva te investments 
have no t been met, i t remains the case that larger investments b y the Bank w o u l d n o t have made a sub- 
stantial d i f ference to Braz i l ’s stock o f infrastructure. This leaves unanswered the question o f whether 
greater lending t o infrastructure cou ld have hastened progress on regulatory reforms, a coun ter fac tua l that 
i s imposs ib le to judge . 

F ina l ly , the differences in framework between the tw o strategies shou ld n o t be oversold, recog- 
n iz ing the inter-dependency among outcomes w i t h i n the f i v e C A S p i l la rs : f isca l d isc ip l ine promotes long - 
te rm sustained growth, e f fec t ive ins t i tu t ions promo te soc ia l development, and env ironmen ta l management 
protects the assets o f the poor, to men t ion but three linkages. The conc lus ion that the Bank’s p rog ram sat- 
is fac to r i ly re f lec ted country pr ior i t ies was also a finding o f the Coun try Assistance Eva lua t ion recen t ly 
discussed b y the Committee on Development Effectiveness. 

PART B - CAS OUTCOMES 

BACKGROUND TO THE 2000 CAS 

The 2000 CAS was prepared in the pe r iod f o l l ow i n g the collapse o f B raz i l ’s quas i- f ixed exchange 
rate reg ime in January 1999. This was a pe r iod o f re l ie f and op t im ism in B raz i l . The consequences o f the 
devaluation on B raz i l ian economic ind ica tors in 1999 had been less severe than feared, and in 2000 the 
economy grew b y a healthy 4.5 percent. Soc ia l progress p r i o r to the 2000 CAS , despite the eventual mac- 
roeconomic crisis, had also been s ign i f ican t . W h i l e income pover ty had fa l len mos t ly around 1995-1996, 
education and hea l th indicators had improved throughout the decade. 

However, increasing debt ratios (most no tab ly to ta l pub l ic debt to GDP as w e l l as to ta l pub l ic and 
p r iva te ex terna l debt to exports) had jeopard ized con t inu ing progress, a danger mos t c lear ly i l lus t ra ted b y 
the 1998 crisis. The healthy g row th o f 2000 opened up a current account de f ic i t o f near ly 5 percent o f 
GDP, p romp t ing fears that, w i thou t fur ther macroeconomic reforms, either g r ow t h and soc ia l progress 
wou ld be weakened o r another cr is is wou ld ensue. 

These factors exp la in the strategic dec is ion o f the 2000 CAS to focus on f isca l balance and d i rec t 
pover ty reduc t ion po l ic ies - where despite progress, spending was i l l - focused and there was r o om f o r 
budget-neutral (e f f ic iency driven) improvements in impac t . 

The 2000 CAS also built on strategic dec is ion taken earlier, most c lea r ly ou t l ined in the 1997 
CAS . Common threads running throughout bo th the 1997 and the 2000 strategies were the overarch ing 
p r i o r i t y g iven to pover ty reduc t ion (re f lec t ing the Bank’s ove ra l l strategic shift under President Wo l fen - 
sohn) and the importance a t tr ibu ted to B raz i l ’s f isca l underpinnings. T w o new and impo r tan t elements o f 
the 1997 C A S had been the number one p r i o r i t y among p o l i c y sectors g iven to educa t ion as the long - run 
d r ive r beh ind B raz i l ian pover ty and inequa l i ty , and the in tens i f ica t ion o f the d i rec t relationships, th rough 
lend ing and non- lend ing services, w i t h the B raz i l ian states. T o these elements the 2000 C A S added a 
more exp l ic i t focus on the Northeast region, and a move (in light o f the k e y r o l e p layed b y macroeco-

OUTCOMES BY PILLAR 

This section assesses coun try progress and Bank con t r ibu t ion in the f i v e p i l la rs o f the 2000 CAS. 
In do ing so, i t i s at times necessary to expand the pe r iod under analysis fur ther back than 2000-2003. Da ta 
f o r the CAS pe r iod are as yet scarce ( fo r example we cannot repor t pover ty rates f o r 2002 and 2003) and 
- even when they are available - three years i s too short a pe r iod fo r many outcome ind ica tors t o change 
s ign i f ican t ly . Moreover, the 1995, 1997, and 2000 assistance strategies essentially represented con t inu i ty , 
since they were prepared under the same government leadership and re f lec ted s im i la r l o n g te rm goals. 

I t should also be acknowledged that the 2000 C A S was no t fo rma l ly a “results-based C A S ” so 
that in some areas i t lacked clear quan t i f iab le targets fo r coun try and Bank performance. Nonetheless, in 
each o f the f ive p i l lars , i t i s possible to iden t i fy the ma in c r i te r ia b y wh ich the Bank meant to judge coun- 
t r y progress, as should be apparent f r om the discussion be low . 

The Bank ’s own in terna l performance measures are considered la ter in pa r t C. In this part, the 
correspondence o f Bank e f for ts (whether lend ing o r other) w i t h areas o f progress by B r a z i l i s discussed as 
evidence o f the Bank’s effectiveness in supporting the government’s agenda where, in the Bank ’s estima- 
t ion , i t contributes to pover ty reduc t ion and social progress. 

Pillar 1: D i r e c t P o v e r t y R e d u c t i o n Po l ic ies 

a) 

C o u n t r y P rog ress 

Five ma in areas w i t h i n this p i l l a r deserve the most de ta i led a t ten t ion since they rece ived emphasis 
in the CAS and were p rov ided w i t h clear ind ica tors o f progress: 

1. Education, f r om early ch i ldhood development (ECD), through p r ima ry and secondary education, 
to adult literacy; 

2. Health, emphasizing the development o f rep l icab le models o f good practice; 

3. Ru ra l development in i t ia t ives , inc lud ing increas ing the ir income-generating impact, and re in fo rc - 
ing the market-based land re fo rm e f for ts o f recent years; 

4. Water and sanitation, inc lud ing good prac t ice mode ls o f p rov is ion and management; and 

5. Strengthening the soc ia l safety net, inc lud ing be t ter targeting o f programs, and the expans ion o f 
cond i t iona l cash transfers such as the then state- and mun ic ipa l - led Bolsa Escola. 

I n education, the 2000 C A S emphasized the need to increase qua l i ty in p r ima ry educa t ion and 
thereby he lp increase secondary enrollments, but also ca l led f o r rising adu l t l i te racy and pa r t ic ipa t ion in 
E C D centers. On ECD , there has indeed been increas ing pa r t ic ipa t ion - the Government’s targe t i s o f 
un iversa l ava i lab i l i ty b y 2007. O f the previous government’s other targets f o r 2007 - 98 percent en ro l l - 
ment age 6-14, 7 0 percent age 15-17, imp rov ing test scores, and 349,000 new schoo l places - those re- 
la ted to enro l lmen t are on target, wh i le those re la ted to qua l i ty are not. The tes t ing system (SAEB) was 
strengthened in 2000-2003, but 2001 scores in Portuguese and mathematics were s im i la r to o r s l igh t ly 
worse than those o f 1999. One exp lana t ion i s tha t many n ew students a re n o w en ter ing the sys tem f r om 
disadvantaged backgrounds.

In health, fa l l ing disease-specific mo r ta l i ty rates were a central indicator, and he re progress has 
been excellent. Incidence o f AIDS peaked in 1998 at 15.9 per 100,000, dec l in ing t o 12.0 b y 2001; mo r ta l - 
i t y rates f r om AIDS have also declined s ign i f ican t ly . These trends are in par t a r e s u l t o f free un iversa l 
access to an t i-re trov ira l therapy mandated b y the Federal Government since Decembe r 1996, and in par t a 
result o f the government's strong HIV/AIDS prevention program. The incidence o f ma la r ia decreased b y 
50 percent between 1999 and 2002, wh i le Tuberculosis registered a 26 percent dec l ine between 2000 and 
2002. The government also achieved targets o f 30 percent coverage fo r ages 1-19 with Hepa t i t is B vacci- 
nation, wh i le coverage o f in fan ts less than one year increased to 82 percent, f r om 7 1 percent in 2000. The 
incidence o f dengue and leishmaniasis increased, the former due to a na t ion-w ide ou tb reak in 2002, wh i le 
the la t ter may be related to improved surveillance. A fur ther po l icy goal was 50 pe rcen t coverage o f fam- 
i l y hea l th agents: na t iona l coverage reached about 35 percent in 2002, although this i s n o w increasing. 

In ru ra l pover ty reduction, the ma in indicators o f coun try progress were (s low ly ) f a l l i n g ru ra l 
poverty, increased land resettlements, and improved targe t ing o f ru ra l in f ras t ruc tu re (water, e lec tr ic i ty , 
roads). Progress has been m ixed . Ru ra l coverage o f water and e lec tr ic i ty has increased, and in do ing so 
has reached fur ther down the income d is tr ibu t ion . Pover ty has fa l len in r u r a l areas, a l though no t at the 
rates desired, and the fa l ls in pover ty observed (about 3.5 percentage po in ts be tween 1995 and 2001: see 
the Pover ty Annex to this CAS) may pa r t ly owe themselves to ou t-m igra t ion t o u r b a n or me tropo l i tan 
areas (where pover ty has r isen) . The expansion o f road access and o f income genera t ing ac t iv i t ies in r u r a l 
areas has been disappointing. L a n d re fo rm (in par t ow ing t o the new commun i ty-based model) increased 
s ign i f ican t ly in pace du r ing the CAS period. 

Water and sanitation, a key to improved l i v i n g standards pa r t icu la r ly in u r b a n areas, has been a 
p rob lem area f o r B raz i l . Abou t 2 m i l l i o n households in Northeast B r a z i l l i v e w i t h o u t adequate water sup- 
p ly , wh i le almost a l l r ivers crossing urban areas are h igh ly po l lu ted . The ma in obstacles have been regula- 
tory : the solutions l i e in decentralized management, c lear ly defined roles o f fede ra l and state agencies, 
r ive r bas in authorities, and water user associations. Clear water rights and bulk p r i c i n g wou ld encourage 
sustainability, but in general have been s low in coming. 

F ina l ly , progress on social pro tec t ion re la t ive to the CAS ind ica tors has been satisfactory, i f on ly 
pa r t ia l re la t ive to B raz i l 's needs. In 2000-2003 B r a z i l t r ied new models o f soc ia l trans fers (at the federal 
leve l the Program to Eradicate C h i l d Labor, Bolsa Escolu, Bolsa A l i m e n t q Z o , a n d mo re recen t ly Fome 
Zero, no t to men t ion a host o f state and mun ic ipa l programs). These programs d i f f e r in the ir design and 
l i k e l y success, and in fac t the lack o f ob jec t ive evaluations i s an issue in the sector, but there i s l i t t l e doub t 
that n ow more resources are reach ing the poo r than at the beg inn ing o f the past CAS per iod . The Gov - 
ernment n ow plans a ra t iona l iza t ion o f many o f these programs to further increase the resources reach ing 
the poor . 

Overa l l , B r a z i l has made notable progress on d irec t pover ty reduc t ion and soc ia l programs. One 
ove ra l l measure i s that during a pe r iod o f l o w growth, income pover ty measures have rema ined approx i- 
mately constant, and many other soc ia l ind ica tors (related to health, education, a n d basic service cover- 
age) have con t inued t o improve . Impor tan t challenges rema in in the qua l i ty o f education, imp rov ing water 
and sanitation, ra t iona l iz ing soc ia l assistance income transfers, generating income in r u r a l activities, and 
tack l ing unemployment. But on a pos i t ive note, in most cases these are the focus o f the new in i t ia t ives o f 
the present government.

Bank Contribution 

As already outlined, educational expansion has been a notable B raz i l ian success o f recent years. 
Expans ion o f basic education has been supported b y state-level Bank in i t ia t ives in M i n a s Gerais, Par& 
Bahia, and Cearh, as w e l l as collaborative analytic wo rk on Fundef, wh ich he lped expand i t t o secondary 
and pre-school education. Fundescola, a federal fund fo r imp rov ing basic education qua l i ty , has received 
impor tan t f inanc ia l and technical support f r o m the Bank. The na t iona l educational tes t ing system (SAEB) 
was strengthened and ins t i tu t iona l ized during the CAS pe r iod w i t h Bank f inanc ia l and techn ica l assis- 
tance. Qua l i ty remains a serious concern: a l l Bank projects, especially at the state level, are targe t ing age- 
grade d is tor t ion . 

O n health, as the Fam i ly Hea l th Program reached about a third o f the popu la t ion b y 2002, i t had 
no t yet the object o f Bank lend ing support. The Bank F am i l y Hea l th Ex tens ion p ro jec t was launched in 
2002. The sector-wide poo led lending approach (SWAP) p ioneered under this p ro jec t i s p rov ing e f fec t ive 
at trans ferr ing Bank management resources towards substantive po l icy impac t and away f r o m day-to-day 
operational management, as w e l l as easing loan disbursement in the con tex t o f a c l ien t w i th satisfactory 
procurement practices: this experience suggests the w ider app l icab i l i ty o f the SWAP ins trumen t in B raz i l .

ber o f subprojects increasing f r om 132 in 1999 to 276 in 2002. In addition, the p ro jec t has f inanced con- 
doms and doub led the number o f vo lun tary counseling and testing sites. Treatment and care services and 
the labora tory ne twork to f o l l ow up patients rece iv ing treatment were also strengthened. On other dis- 
eases, the V ig isus pro jec t focused on malaria, TB, leishmaniasis, hepatitis B, leprosy and dengue in the 
n ine states cons t i tu t ing the Lega l Amazon, where cure rates fo r TB (75 percent) surpassed the na t iona l 
average (about 50 percent). Imp rov ing surveillance i s also an impor tan t ob jec t ive f o r V ig isus . 

On ru ra l pover ty reduction, the Bank has con tr ibu ted w i t h commun i ty-dr iven development p ro - 
jec ts in a l l Northeastern states (w i th new pro jec ts imm inen t in M inas Gerais, Alagoas, MaranhBo, and 
Sergipe). This i s one o f the largest areas o f lend ing in the B r a z i l po r t fo l io , w i t h $665m in outstanding 
loans. A recent evaluation o f this fam i ly o f projects gave a pos i t ive ove ra l l assessment: in par t icu lar the 
program's u s e o f commun i ty councils has he lped build up soc ia l cap i ta l that may n ow f o r m the basis o f a 
w ide r range o f activities. But as no ted above, despite these widespread in i t ia t ives ru ra l pove r ty statistics 
have proven stubbornly slow-moving; newer pro jec t are thus a t temp t ing no t on ly t o increase impac t on 
revenue-generating activities, but also to integrate the commun i ty-dr iven components more c lose ly w i t h 
other government ac t iv i t ies in the same communities. 

Ru ra l pover ty has also been targeted b y the Bank 's community-based land r e f o rm pro jec ts in the 
Northeast. These projects have been con trovers ia l domes t ica l ly since they adopt a d i f fe ren t mode l o f land 
r e f o rm f r om that o f land occupation that i s also prac t iced w ide ly in B raz i l . The f i rs t L a n d R e f o rm p ro jec t 
had been the object o f tw o reviews b y the Inspec t ion Panel. B o t h rev iews praised the p ro jec t approach, 
however, and w i t h i n the last CAS pe r iod these operations have con tr ibu ted to an increase in the number 
o f fam i l ies resettled on the ir ow n land in ru ra l areas (over 100,000 people have been settled t o date under 
the Bank supported crkd i to fund ia 'r io projects). 

U rban development has been an area o f weaker performance na t iona l ly , and the Bank's presence 
has been l im i ted . Bank support through spec i f ic urban pro jec ts has focused on water through support t o 
sector-wide reforms (Prosanear ZZ) and in Cearfi through support to reg iona l development using u rban 
poles (P rou rb ) . The recen t ly signed integrated Rec i fe me t ropo l i tan p ro jec t (Prome tropo le) represents an

mun ic ipa l i t ies , a l though i t i s too early to repor t on progress. 

On soc ia l protection, the Bank’s support has been l im i t e d to techn ica l assessment and advice. The 
Bank produced reports on the Program to Eradicate C h i l d Labo r (PETI) and Bolsa Escola, and techn ica l 
inputs in the preparation o f the Fome Ze ro program. The Bank i s increasing i t s ac t iv i t ies rap id ly on social 
protection, w i t h programmatic AAA ( inc lud ing wo rk on the new P r ime i ro Emp rego program) and l i k e l y 
sector-wide support. Support fo r labor market reforms has been l im i ted to ESW.21 AAA ac t iv i t ies that had 
a broader focus o n poverty and inequa l i ty have raised awareness o f social p o l i c y issues such as ill- 
targeted soc ia l spending, unbalanced social security transfers, and the key ro le o f educa t ion in pover ty 
and inequa l i ty , a l l important against a backdrop o f res tr ic ted spending during the f isca l adjustment. 
Broader social inc lus ion and empowerment have been supported by smaller but we l l-regarded Bank ini- 
tiatives, such as the annual B r a z i l Innova t ion Day, wh ich has awarded grant funding t o innova t ive c i v i l 
society ac t iv i t ies such as the D iadema commun i ty project, wh ich has reduced c r im e in one area o f Silo

Overa l l , the Bank f u l f i l l e d i ts 2000 commitment to focus most resources in d i rec t pover ty reduc- 
t i o n strategies, and there i s evidence, bo th in terms o f qua l i ty assessment and in terms o f coun try progress, 
that Bank support has made a con tr ibu t ion to this CAS p i l la r . 

Pillar 2: Fiscal Stability 

a) 

Country Progress 

B raz i l ’s f isca l management over the last CAS pe r iod has in many ways been exemplary. Indeed, 
economic analysis conducted fo r the recent B r a z i l Coun try Econom ic Memo randum suggests that spec i f i- 
ca l ly B raz i l ’s ab i l i ty to ad jus t i t s f isca l po l icy in response to va ry ing ex terna l circumstances i s wha t has 
guaranteed re la t ive s tab i l i ty during a pe r iod o f challenges.22 The ma in ind ica tor o f f i s c a l d isc ip l ine scruti- 
n ized b y the bond markets i s the p r ima ry budget surplus generated to pay debt service. In 2000 B r a z i l ran 
a p r ima ry surplus o f 3.5 percent; in 2003 th is i s expected t o be about 4.3 percent. 

I t i s nonetheless s t r ik ing that B raz i l ’s pub l ic debt t o GDP ra t io i s s l igh t ly h ighe r than i t was at the 
beginning o f the last CAS pe r iod (55.4 percent net debt to va lor ized GDP at end June 2003 compared to 
48.7 percent at end 1999, see f i g u r e l).23 
To ta l external debt ( inc lud ing b o t h p u b l i c and pr iva te) has 
stayed about constant as a f rac t ion o f GDP over the C A S period, mov ing f r om 44.8 percen t at end 1999 t o 
a pro jec ted 43 percent at end 2003.24

T w o p r inc ipa l (related) explanations reconc i le rising debt stocks w i t h rising p r ima ry surpluses: 
rising debt service costs and currency depreciation. In B raz i l 's case, debt costs have been d r iven up b y a 
fam i l ia r l i s t o f challenges, external and internal, that the country has had to dea l w i t h in this C A S per iod . 
These have been l i s t e d many times, but i t i s wo r th rehearsing the most impor tan t here: 

0 B raz i l 's ow n energy crisis, wh ich came to light in the spring o f 2001, and was ow i n g to l o w ra in - 
f a l l in the context o f a long h is to ry o f under-investment in generation capacity; 

0 The market reverberations o f September 11, 2001; 

0 The Argen t ine debt crisis o f late 2001 onward; 

0 Ma rke t uncertainty in 2002 about B raz i l 's con t inued f isca l performance a f ter the general election; 

0 L ow e r than forecast economic g row th in the OECD f r om 2001 throughou t the per iod . 

These factors have con tr ibu ted to increase spreads on B raz i l ian sovereign bonds and to depreciate 
the currency. 

0 Spreads increased f r om levels in the 600s (measured in basis points) in la te 1999 to over 2,400 
during B raz i l 's most worr isome moments o f the last CAS pe r iod in mid-2002. They are n o w back 
at levels (in the 600s) no t seen since ear ly 2000. 

0 S im i lar ly , the IMF estimates that the rea l e f fec t ive exchange rate, a f ter rising b y 6.7 percent in 
2000, f e l l b y 17.0 percent in 2001 and b y a fu r the r 13.3 percent in 2002. This has raised the rea l 
value o f pub l ic and pr iva te sector l iab i l i t ies denominated in o r linked t o fo re ign currencies. 

0 F ina l ly , nom ina l depreciation drove up in f la t ion , and the Cen tra l Bank was fo rced to raise interest 
rates in the la t ter h a l f o f the CAS pe r iod t o con ta in in f la t iona ry expectations (the preservation o f 
the in f la t ion targe t ing regime being a no tab le achievement during the CAS period). Since about 
h a l f o f public-sector debt i s indexed t o the overn igh t interest rate that the Bank u s e s fo r mone tary 
po l icy , this also has the side-effect o f ra is ing debt service costs. 

The ne t result o f these effects has been that despite rising p r ima ry surpluses, the nom ina l budge t 
de f ic i t (i.e., the pub l ic sector bo r row ing requirement) has risen, f r o m 3.6 percent o f GDP in 2000 and 
2001, to 4.7 percent in 2002 - w i t h a s i m i l a r p ro jec t ion f o r 2003.

Measu r ing against possible.counterfactuals, one reason fo r the weak per formance o f these risk in- 
dicators has been the path taken on deeper public-sector re forms du r ing the per iod . The 2000 C A S l is ted 
three objectives under the heading o f F isca l Adjustment: 

0 Soc ia l security reform, measured b y the ne t present value o f the re forms passed during the per iod ; 

0 Adm in is t ra t ive re fo rm (par t icu lar ly at the state leve l) , permitting reduced p u b l i c sector consump- 
t i o n (par t icu lar ly payro l l) and greater creditworthiness; 

0 F isca l management, including improved pub l ic deb t management ( to reduce debt service costs), 
con t inued surpluses, and imp roved qua l i ty o f the adjustment (m in im iz ing i t s impac t on g row th 
and equity). 

In light o f these objectives, i t i s possible to g ive an assessment o f this area during the C A S per iod . 

O n social security, po l i t ics rendered progress imposs ib le in 2000-2002. B r a z i l had passed re fo rms 
to the pr iva te system ( INSS ) in 1997. The new government has now proposed t o Congress a r e f o rm to the 
pub l ic system (RJU), wh ich the Bank estimates w i l l save amounts o f the order o f one-ha l f a percent o f 
GDP per year f o r the nex t 10 years. There w i l l rema in the need fo r fur ther r e f o rm in order f o r B raz i l ’s 
f isca l sustainability to be assured over the longer run. But over a reasonable t ime hor izon , and g iven the 
po l i t ica l d i f f icu l t ies o f passing these reforms, these recent developments are h i g h l y pos i t ive . 

On state administrative reform, progress has been marked in cer ta in states (e.g., Bahia) w h i l e dis- 
appo in t ing in many. Meanwh i le , adherence to the 2001 F isca l Respons ib i l i ty L a w (LRF) has been far- 
reaching, im p l y i n g that many states have seen the ir budgets squeezed and have found i t d i f f i c u l t to make 
investments. The State Governors’ attempts to ensure tha t the tax re fo rm cu r ren t ly be ing debated b y the 
tw o houses does no t further cu t in to state revenues re f lec ts this h is tory . But apart f r o m trying to pro tec t 
revenues, many states are recogn iz ing the need fo r fur ther improvements to the structure o f spending, and 
some are ar t icu la t ing reques ts to the Bank f o r support in this area. The assessment f o r the C A S pe r iod 
shou ld therefore be that progress on adm in is tra t ive r e f o rm has been d isappo in t ing f o r the coun try as a 
whole. 

On f isca l management, we must distinguish be tween “quantity” and “qua l i ty .” On quan t i ta t ive 
measures, the Federal Government has made striking progress on three levels: 

0

P r ima ry surpluses have been increased in f lex ib le response to requirements; 
The LRF was passed in 2000 and moreover has become more than a l a w “on paper” - i t has been 
translated in to a cred ib le code o f ac t ion in practice; 
0 Pub l ic debt management improved . 

Qua l i ta t ive measures are b y the ir nature harder t o assess, but dec l in ing investment in in f ras t ruc - 
ture, a dec l in ing p ropo r t ion o f the budget devoted to “discretionary” spending, and increas ing budgetary 
r ig id i t ies (earmarking, etc.) a l l po in t to a lack o f progress in budgetary qua l i ty . This i s n ow a top p r i o r i t y 
f o r action.

Bank Contribution 

As related above, progress in f isca l management has been marked o n quan t i ta t ive ind ica tors , 
wh i le the “qua l i ty o f adjustment” remains an issue. Since Bank support targeted the b road area o f f isca l

adjustment ma in ly through programmatic policy-based lending, assessment o f Bank per formance neces- 
sar i ly re f lec ts this state o f affairs. 

Soc ia l security re fo rm came later and in smaller doses than the 2000 C A S might have hoped for , 
but nonetheless (along w i t h the LRF) represents one o f the most impor tan t single r e f o rm s since the e l im i - 
na t ion o f in f la t ion b y the Rea l Plan. This i s a good example o f a cyc le o f p rog ramma t ic Bank support 
making a s ign i f ican t con tr ibu t ion to a key re fo rm agenda. A program o f research a n d i n f o rm a l advice l e d 
to the pub l ica t ion o f an impor tan t piece o f ESW in 2000.25 A single-tranche loan ope ra t ion supported the 
re fo rm o f the pr iva te sector pension system in 1999. Subsequently, small-scale TA loans have had high 
impac t at state and federal levels. U l t ima te ly , further progress may f o rm the basis o f fu tu re programmatic 
lending. 

Re forms to imp rove the qua l i ty o f government expenditures - f o r examp le through increased 
spending f l e x i b i l i t y (reduced earmarking), administrative reforms, and more ca re fu l eva lua t ion o f impac t 
- have been an area o f re la t ive ly s low progress, and until recen t ly the Bank has f a i l e d t o make much im- 
pression here in the absence o f a strongly articulated request f r om government f o r techn ica l wo rk . This 
has n ow changed, w i t h a new e f fo r t be ing coordinated in B ras i l ia to reduce budge t r i g i d i t y and increase 
spending impac t at the federal level, a long w i t h the Bank’s response to a series o f states’ requests f o r sup- 
po r t fo r pub l ic sector management. 

Programmatic policy-based lend ing has g iven strong support to bo th the in t roduc t ion and the im- 
p lemen ta t ion o f the LRF, a key re fo rm fo r B raz i l . The government has expressed apprec ia t ion f o r the 
f l e x i b i l i t y o f fe red b y programmatic policy-based lending. Ano ther area o f progress, p u b l i c debt manage- 
ment, has been supported through ESW, TA, and also the programmatic f isca l r e f o r m loans. F ina l ly , dur- 
ing the government trans i t ion in 2002/2003, the Coun try Econom ic Memo randum p r o v i d e d the incom ing 
adm in is tra t ion w i t h guidance on re la t ive pr ior i t ies .26 Fu ture ESW and lend ing w i l l targe t the qua l i ty o f 
spending as B raz i l ’s p r io r i ty cross-cutting i s s u e in the f isca l area. 

Overa l l , despite the rema in ing challenges, B r a z i l has per formed w e l l on f i s c a l reforms, and the 
Bank has supported this performance through a strong comb ina t ion o f ESW, i n f o r m a l advice, TA, and 
programmatic policy-based lend ing . 

Pillar 3: Economic Growth 

a) 

Country Progress 

Econom ic g row th has seen perhaps the greatest divergence between the o p t im i sm o f 2000 and 
subsequent coun try performance. A f t e r an encouraging rebound f r om the 1999 deva lua t ion , unforeseen 
factors prevented the attainment o f almost a l l analysts’ g row th forecasts fo r B r a z i l in the pe r iod 2001- 
2003. 

Despite this disappointment, i t i s impor tan t to put B raz i l ’s economic g r ow t h in to reg iona l per- 
spective. F o r the pe r iod 1999-2001, B r a z i l grew at 2.3 percent pe r annum, wh i le L a t i n Ame r ica and the 
Caribbean ( L AC ) outside A rgen t ina and B r a z i l grew at 2.1 percent. In 2002, B r a z i l grew 1.5 percent; 
L A C minus B r a z i l and Argen t ina grew at 0.8 p e r ~ e n t . ~ ’ To some extent, what a i led B r a z i l a i led the reg ion 
at least as much.

26 “Brazil: Stability fo r Grow th and Poverty Reduction,” 2003, Report No . 25278-BR. 
27 Obviously including Argentina during these periods makes the L A C performance worse: in 1999-2001 L A C out- 
side B raz i l grew annually at 0.8 percent, and in 2002 at -2.7 percent.

A More Equitable, Sustainable, and Competitive Brazil - Country Assistance Strategy FY2003-2007 

Nonetheless, the first unforeseen factor to arise - t h e 2001 energy cr is is - was B raz i l -spec i f ic and 
i s in fo rma t ive fo r po l icy . Against a background o f s low p r iva t iza t ion (less than 30 percent o f generating 
capacity i s today private), public generation and transmission companies had cu t investments (anticipat- 
ing p r iva t iza t ion and subject to f isca l constraints). Rules p roh ib i t ing generators f r o m passing costs on to 
d is tr ibu tors and pr ice controls on d is tr ibu t ion also served t o deter p r iva te investment. Unpred ic tab le 
regu la t ion and the presence ,o f a ver t ica l ly integrated state monopo ly in generation discouraged new 
private-sector entry. In sum, the regulations govern ing pr ic ing , contracting, and indus t ry structure did no t 
p rov ide the right incentives fo r re l iab le energy supply. A f t e r more than a decade o f demand ou ts tr ipp ing 
supply and fa l l ing spare capacity, l o w ra in fa l l in 2000-2001 was mere ly the straw tha t b roke the camel’s 
back. 

The mo ra l i s that the regulatory framework (not on ly in energy, but in other key sectors such as 
transport, water, telecom, and banking) has become a g row th bo t t leneck fo r B raz i l . The 2000 C A S recog- 
n ized the importance o f regu la t ion f o r growth, but a finding o f the recent C A E was tha t insu f f ic ien t atten- 
t i o n has been pa id b y the Government and by the Bank to this area. 

The 2000 CAS l is ted g row th i s s u e s under seven headings: 

1. 

Reg iona l (multi-modal) transport, measured b y successful concessions and f a l l i n g log is t ics costs; 

2. 

3. 

4. 

5 . 

6. 

7 . 

Urban transport, measured ma in ly b y the popu la t ion served; 

Energy, no tab ly the establishment o f more compe t i t ion in the sector and a re l iab le energy supply; 

F inanc ia l sector development, inc lud ing increased private-sector in termed ia t ion , a stronger bank- 
ing safety net, and possible fur ther p r iva t iza t ion o f state banks; 

Pr iva te sector development, inc lud ing the adop t ion o f corporate governance laws to pro tec t mi- 
no r i ty shareholders, a new bankruptcy law , enhanced compe t i t ion po l icy , laws govern ing pub l ic - 
pr iva te partnerships, and taxa t ion reforms; 

Ru ra l growth, ma in ly through expansion in large-scale agriculture; 

H ighe r education and technology, inc lud ing more e f f ic ien t f inanc ing o f h igher educa t ion and 
greater links between higher education and private-sector innova t ion . 

There i s l i t t l e reason to doubt the diagnosis im p l i e d b y the above l i s t , but i t i s striking tha t l i t t l e 
progress ove ra l l has been made on this re fo rm p rog ram i f i t i s taken as a who le . Some successes have oc- 
curred ( i ) in the transport sector, where independent regulators have been established, wh ich i t i s hoped 
w i l l create the basis fo r greater pr iva te investment, ( i i ) in the f inanc ia l sector, where spreads have de- 
creased somewhat (although they rema in extremely high b y in terna t iona l standards) and where the f inan - 
c i a l safety net and supervisory ro le o f the Cen tra l Bank have been strengthened, ( i i i ) in corporate govern- 
ance, where a new corporate l aw was passed in 2001 and new leg is la t ion f o r the stock market was passed 
in 1999, ( i v ) in large-scale agriculture, wh ich has expanded on the back o f innova t ions p rov ided b y the 
na t iona l agr icu l tura l research institute (Embrapa), and ( v ) in science and technology, where some grant 
funding has been made compe t i t ive (supported b y a Bank loan). But such progress pales in compar ison 
w i t h the agenda needed to return B r a z i l to a high g row th path. 

Meanwh i le , several key areas have shown patchy progress:

The move towards a ra t iona l ized mu l t i -moda l reg iona l transport ne two rk has been s lower than 
hoped (reflected in non-dec l in ing log is t ics costs) and few additions have been made to u rban 
transport systems; 

Energy re fo rm has stalled after an e f fec t ive ra t ion ing response to the 2001 cr is is (supported b y 
the 2001 Energy Re fo rm Loan , since wh ich progress has waned); 

Compe t i t ion po l icy and i t s app l ica t ion did no t a l ter appreciably during the CAS pe r iod (a l though 
there are n ow new in i t ia t ives here); 

F inanc ia l sector compe t i t ion has no t increased and c red i t i s s t i l l dom ina ted b y the pub l ic sector (a 
factor wh ich in terna t iona l research associates w i t h l o w growth);28 

Access to higher education has remained very limited, despite spending o n the sector tha t i s ex- 
tremely high b y any in terna t iona l standards. 

b) 

Bank Contribution 

While the 2000 CAS iden t i f ied g row th as a p r i o r i t y and recognized the in ter- l inkage be tween 
g row th and stability, the program during the CAS pe r iod has been re la t ive ly light in this area o w i n g to a 
comb ina t ion o f other p r io r i t ies and f isca l and ins t i tu t iona l impediments. 

One exception has been a successful pa i r o f programma t ic adjustment loans, based on a d ia logue 
w i t h the government focus ing on f inanc ia l sector supervision, the strengthening o f i n f l a t i o n ta rge t ing and 
other func t ions o f the Cen tra l Bank, and the p r iva t iza t ion o f some rema in ing state banks. The B a n k also 
responded to a government request f o r advice on growth-generating po l ic ies w i t h E S W disseminated in 
2001, wh ich was w e l l r e ~ e i v e d . ~ ’ 

In addition, the Bank responded to the 2001 energy cr is is w i t h in tens ive advice, TA, and a s ing le - 
tranche energy-sector adjustment loan . This loan was successful in suppor t ing the immed ia te response to 
the 2001 crisis, and although the subsequent lack o f r e f o rm progress in the sector has been d isappo in t ing 
(and may yet prove a constraint t o g row th again), i t does n o t im p l y that the ra t iona le o f encourag ing and 
imp rov ing possible subsequent re forms was w rong ex ante. 

Lend ing and TA have con t inued through the Bank ’s ex is t ing ac t iv i t ies in the transport sector, al- 
though here new lend ing has been l im i t e d b y f isca l constraints. N e w pro jec ts in the CAS pe r iod were 
GoiBs H ighways and SFio Paulo M e t r o Line 4.30 With regard to the second o f these, a large componen t o f 
the Bank’s outstanding investment po r t fo l io - $859m at the time o f w r i t i n g - resides in urban transpor t . 
One o f the goals o f th is set o f loans was to encourage the decentralization o f the regu la t ion o f this sector, 
wh ich has happened on ly selectively. 

M u c h o f th is wo rk may n ow f l o w in to a new programma t ic series o f p o l i c y r e f o rm loans f o r the 
g row th agenda, wh ich w i l l p rog ram amalgamate the r e f o rm agenda in several k e y areas: log is t ics costs, 
in fras truc ture regulation, adm in is tra t ive barriers to investment and innovation, trade and increased com- 
pe t i t ion , and financial-sector deepening.

Re f lec t ing the conclusions o f the CAE , the p rob lem that the Bank p r o g r a m has faced has been 
less the correct iden t i f ica t ion o f p r io r i t ies than the ab i l i ty t o in f luence per formance s ign i f ican t ly through 
the Bank’s array o f instruments. The Bank did t r y repeatedly to lend greater suppor t t o regu la tory re forms 
and succeeded in some instances (e.g., the transport and water sectors), but has n e v e r gained the trac t ion 
hoped fo r across the board. In the infrastructure sectors, l im i t e d federal and state investment has cur ta i led 
the po ten t ia l f o r Bank investment operations to prov ide finance-based support t o key regu la tory reforms. 
In energy, where some federal investment has continued, the Government has been re luc tan t to use Bank 
f inanc ing . I t shou ld be noted that g iven B raz i l ’s strong system o f f isca l management, Bank f inanc ing to 
sectors i s no t “additional” - i t s value therefore comes ma in ly f r om pro tec t ing gove rnmen t p r i o r i t y p ro - 
j e c t s over t ime and b y p rov id ing technical support. These advantages must ou twe igh o the r “costs o f do ing 
business” w i t h the Bank that the government may perceive as disincentives in a g i v e n sector. 

Relevant also fo r judging the Bank’s con tr ibu t ion , B raz i l ’s g row th pe r fo rmance shou ld be put 
in to perspective. There i s no doubt that regu la tory barriers are significant, no r a b o u t the impac t o f f inan- 
c i a l and macroeconomic imbalances, but B raz i l ian g row th rates have no t been l o w e r in recent years than

Pillar 4: Deve lopmen t Effectiveness 

a) 

C o u n t r y Progress 

P i l la r 4 o f the 2000 CAS emphasized the need to strengthen pub l ic sector management: j u d i c i a l 
re form , economic decision-making in the states, and ins t i tu t iona l capacity in the m u n i c i p a l i t i e s (B raz i l ’s 
more than 5500 mun ic ipa l i t ies are responsible f o r de l ive r ing many basic services i n c l u d i n g p r ima ry edu- 
cation, some hea l th services, basic sanitation, and many transfers such as Fome Z e r o and Bolsa Escola). 

As men t ioned earlier, the 2000 C A S d i f fe red f r o m the 2000 PPA in making this theme exp l ic i t , 
and the discussion in the CAS po in ted out that B r a z i l was an intermediate p e r f o r m e r b y in te rna t iona l 
comparison on mos t measures o f governance, such as pub l ic participation, p o l i t i c a l ins tab i l i ty and v io - 
lence, government effectiveness, and regu la tory burden. Moreover , impor tan t imp rovemen ts in institu- 
t iona l capacity at the federal leve l and in transparency throughout government w e r e at the t ime e i ther re-

L a w was at the t ime s t i l l on ly a proposal). The imp lemen ta t ion and conso l ida t ion o f these re forms repre- 
sents rea l progress.

An area h igh l igh ted in the 2000 CAS , where much-needed progress has been absent, i s j u d i c i a l 
re form . Con trac t enforceability, consistency o f j u d i c i a l decisions, and time delays rema in serious obsta- 
cles bo th to economic ac t iv i ty and to fairness o f outcomes in B raz i l . 

In connec t ion w i t h this observation, i t wou ld be w rong to place much o f the b lame fo r recent in- 
creases in c r ime and violence in B raz i l at the door o f the jud ic ia ry , a l though impun i ty through leng thy 
cour t delays and byzantine procedures i s probab ly a con t r ibu t ing factor. Increases in u rban v io len t c r ime 
in par t icu lar have been alarming. In 1999, B raz i l ’s hom ic ide rate was 26 per 100,000 inhabitants, com- 
pared w i t h 12 in 1980, and more recently this rate has no t decreased. V io lence i s highest in the Southeast 
region, pa r t icu la r ly the states o f R i o de Janeiro (w i th a hom ic ide rate o f 53 in 1999) and S2io Paulo (44), 
and hom ic ide rates are above 60 in the c i t ies o f Recife, R i o de Janeiro, S2io Paulo, and V i t6 r ia . Residents 
o f smaller per iphera l slums are exposed to the highest hom ic ide rates. M u c h o f this c r ime i s re la ted to the 
drug trade, pa r t icu la r ly in urban slums, where the authorities have in places v i r tua l ly re l inqu ished con t ro l 
to organized gangs. The solutions are complex, and invo lve coordinated improvemen ts in commun i ty po - 
l ic ing , prisons, and j u d i c i a l processes, a long w i t h commun i ty leve l in i t ia t ives focus ing on a t-r isk young 
males. 

Overall, B raz i l ian ins t i tu t iona l strengthening has been s low ly conso l ida ted over the 2000-2003 
CAS period. With the exception o f j u d i c i a l and cr ime-re la ted policies, progress has been most no t iceab le 
at the federal leve l and in certain states - mun ic ipa l strengthening i s s t i l l recogn ized by the Government 
as a key challenge to improve service de l ivery . 

b) 

Bank Contribution 

Desp i te the separation o f governance as a separate theme in i t s conceptual framework , the 2000 
C A S did no t lead to a heavy concentration o f Bank ac t iv i t ies in this area. This was an t ic ipa ted in the 
CAS, wh ich emphasized an emerging but demand-driven approach w i t h a lean ing towards ESW, grant 
funded activities, and other non- lend ing services. Components o f state lending in Cear6 and Bah ia f o - 
cused on mun ic ipa l and state capacity, and state economic memoranda in s ix northeastern states31 gave 
broad po l icy advice to state governments, but the lending operations hinted at in the 2000 CAS (e&, an 
urban re fo rm APL supporting mun ic ipa l management) did n o t t a k e place (and indeed had been w i thd rawn 
b y the 2001 progress report). At the federal leve l the B a n k completed ESW on the government’s multi- 
year p lann ing process3’ and gave technical advice in the j u d i c i a l area, starting w i t h workshops and p ro - 
gressing to ESW - wo rk on jus t ice continues, an impo r tan t investment in know ledge f o r the new C A S 
per iod . At the mun ic ipa l level, the WB I p rov ided adv ice to the mun ic ipa l i ty o f S2io Pau lo o n an t i- 
co r rup t ion measures. 

Despite these activities, i t i s apparent that the Bank‘s program did no t rea l ly o f fe r in tens ive sup- 
po r t in pub l ic governance, beyond the effects im p l i c i t in ongo ing Bank operations (transparency in p ro - 
curement, f iduc ia ry oversight, etc.). This i s no t inconsistent w i t h the cautious approach adopted, to p i l o t a 
few sma l l activities, but the choice to treat this d imens ion separately in the 2000 C A S may have p laced an 
emphasis out o f p ropo r t ion w i t h the ensuing Bank support.

1. Na tu ra l resource management, inc lud ing water, forests, and land; 

2. Env ironmen ta l pro tec t ion and management, inc lud ing increasing pro tec ted areas, mainstreaming 
a ir and water qua l i ty in other sector decisions, the creation o f stronger l icens ing , mon i tor ing , and 
enforcement mechanisms, and building stakeholder coa l i t ions around env i ronmen ta l assets; 

3. G loba l environmental externalities, including carbon sequestration and b iod ive rs i ty . 

Progress on a l l three areas has been most marked in terms o f building laws and ins t i tu t ions . Con- 
versely, the greatest rema in ing challenges are in imp lemen t ing these s truc tura l re fo rms o n the ground. 

On na tura l resource management, key steps were the new water law , the c rea t ion o f the water 
regulator (ANA), and the execution o f micro-basin leve l systems o f so i l management in southern B raz i l . 
Imp lemen ta t ion o f the water l aw has been slow, however. 

S im i lar ly , on environmental protection, an impor tan t l aw was passed in 2002 de f in ing na t iona l 
units o f c o n ~ e r v a t i o n , ~ ~ 
85 percent o f indigenous lands were demarcated, and env i ronmen ta l ly pro tec ted 
land increased. The 1999 environmental crimes l aw was app l ied to f ine Petrobras $25 m i l l i o n a f ter an o i l 
spill, and this l aw has improved enforcement o f forest-clearing rules (the states o f A c r e and M a t o Grosso 
have used GPS and satellite imagery fo r this). The Na t iona l Forest Program aims t o set aside 14 percent 
o f the Amazon as designated Na t iona l Forests, where logg ing companies wou ld bid f o r concessions to 
produce under pub l ic supervision, wh i le the Amazon Ra in fores t Pro tec t ion A c t (ARPA), signed b y the 
President at the Johannesburg summit, protects 10 percent o f the Lega l Amazon. On g loba l pub l ic goods, 
the Plantar charcoal produc t ion site in the state o f M inas Gerais became the f i rs t purchase made under the 
pro to type carbon fund, and the donor-funded P i lo t Program f o r the P ro tec t ion o f the Ra in fores t was 
strengthened. 

Despite these achievements, however, deforestation rates in the las t tw o years have increased sig- 
n i f ican t ly , unde r l in ing the challenge o f mon i to r ing and enforcement o f the new ru les . Ins t i tu t iona l capac- 
i t y remains weak in env ironmen ta l protection, and many ac t iv i t ies s t i l l re ly on dono r leadership. 

b) 

Bank Contribution 

In this p i l l a r the 2000 C A S emphasized water resource management (pa r t icu la r ly in the Nor theas t 
region), good practice in so i l conservation and land management through m ic ro -bas in management p ro - 
jects, grant-funded ecosystem pro tec t ion through partnership in the G loba l Env i ronmen t F a c i l i t y (GEF, 
pa r t icu la r ly in Amazonia), and - where possible - in terna t iona l resource transfers t o pro tec t in te rna t iona l 
environmental pub l ic goods. As mentioned above, in mos t areas progress was faster on se t t ing up laws 
and ins t i tu t ions than on imp lemen ta t ion . Nonetheless, i t i s striking that the B a n k has been i n v o l v e d in 
nearly a l l o f the present in i t ia t ives to build institutions, and continues to be i n v o l v e d on the g round in t ry - 
ing to improve execution. 

On water resource management, P roAgua has con tr ibu ted to deve lop ing a new management ap- 
proach in Northeast B raz i l , wh i le the Bank he lped in the design o f the Guaran i aqu i fe r p ro jec t (coord ina t- 
ing B raz i l , Paraguay, Uruguay , and Argen t ina in mapp ing the aquifer and de f in ing user rights). State-level 
water resource management projects are underway in Bah ia (already ongo ing in 2000) and Cear6 (new 
during the CAS period). Sector wo rk has also supported the development o f B raz i l ’s new mode l o f water

resource management. The Bank has supported m icro-bas in leve l so i l management w i t h ex is t ing pro jec ts 
in ParanA (under the GEF) and R i o Grande do Sul, and new projects in Santa Ca ta r ina and Sslo Paulo. A 
new forestry loan i s under preparation after lengthy consultations and sector 

Th rough partnership in donor-funded ecosystem pro tec t ion the Bank he lped advance env iron- 
men ta l management in Braz i l ’s threatened biomes. Incorpora t ing 50 m i l l i o n hectares o f p r ima ry Amazon 
forest i n t o s t r ic t ly protected and sustainable use reserves i s the goa l o f the Amazon Protected Areas P ro - 
jec t (ARPA), funded b y the GEF. The second Na t iona l Env ironmen ta l P ro jec t supports ins t i tu t iona l 
strengthening o f B raz i l ’s environmental pro tec t ion agencies. 

The Bank closed two projects towards the end o f the CAS pe r iod - Prodeagro in M a t o Grosso 
and PlanafZoro in RondGnia - that i l lus tra te the in tr icacy o f sustainable ins t i tu t iona l solutions in env iron- 
men ta l management and the Bank’s correspondingly m i x e d track record on this in B raz i l . I t i s impor tan t 
to men t ion these projects no t on ly because they were s t i l l ac t ive in the CAS per iod , but more impo r tan t ly 
because the ir lessons strongly in f luence the Bank’s present cautious approach. The pro jec ts aimed t o he lp 
“manage the development and pro tec t ion o f the Amazon bas in in RondGnia” and “ imp lemen t an imp roved 
strategy f o r na tura l resource management, conservation, env ironmen ta l protection, and sustainable devel- 
opment o f the state o f M a t o Grosso” b y developing land-use zon ing in the two states (where the Bank had 
received c r i t ic ism f o r previous lend ing fo r road construction). Recent Imp lemen ta t ion Comp le t ion Re- 
ports fo r the tw o projects found that the ir zon ing laws fa i led to take in to account su f f ic ien t ly the interests 
o f many stakeholders in the Amazonian frontier, and that the zon ing was la rge ly igno red b y p r iva te 
agents.35 The pro jec ts serve as a warn ing against ove r ly technical, top-down attempts t o con t ro l na tu ra l 
resource use. While acknow ledg ing the ir d isappo in t ing results, i t should be no ted tha t these pro jec ts were 
in the ta i l-end o f execution in the last CAS period, and have therefore no t been g i v e n much we igh t ing in 
assessing the Bank ’s 2000-2003 environmental ac t iv i t ies . 

Overall, although B raz i l ’s progress on env ironmen ta l and na tura l resource management has been 
gradual re la t ive to the importance o f the area and the to the challenges present, the Bank has been ac t ive 
in many o f the areas where the country has made s ign i f ican t ins t i tu t iona l changes. This suggests b o t h a 
v ind ica t ion o f the Bank ’s approach in the last CAS pe r iod and a care fu l bu t s ign i f ican t scaling up o f the 
Bank ’s ac t iv i t ies in these areas - in par t through the ir in tegra t ion w i t h other areas o f Bank support - w i t h 
the focus o n building the ins t i tu t iona l capacity to execute new ly fo rmed po l ic ies a n d to enforce new laws 
and regulations. 

PART C - BANK PERFORMANCE 

This section reports on Bank performance measured b y the Bank’s ow n internal pe$ormance in - 
dicators at the leve l o f the lend ing pro jec t or the sector study, produced bo th b y the Qua l i ty Assessment 
Group (QAG) , wh ich assesses the qua l i ty o f economic and sector w o r k and the “qua l i ty at en try” and 
“qua l i ty o f supervision’’ o f ongo ing lend ing operations, and the Operations Eva lua t ion Depar tmen t 
(OED), wh ich assesses closed lend ing operations (in add i t ion to conduc t ing the CAE over a longer t ime 
horizon). 

LENDING OPERATIONS 

C losed Bank lending operations to B r a z i l fo r the pe r iod 1995-2002 have rece ived generally fa- 
vorable ra t ings f r om OED, w i t h 9 1 percent assessed as satisfactory versus 78 percen t f o r the L A C reg ion 
and 72 percent f o r the Bank . O E D also breaks down i ts ra t ings in to components o n the sus ta inab i l i ty o f

impac t and impac t on ins t i tu t iona l development. O n these aspects B r a z i l also compares favorab ly w i t h the 
Bank more broad ly . O f projects that closed in 1995-2002, 81 percent had the ir sus ta inab i l i ty ra ted as 
l ike ly , compared w i t h 64 percent fo r L A C and 55 percent fo r the Bank . O f the same group, 67 percent 
were ra ted w i t h substantial impact on institutions, versus 45 percent fo r L A C and 39 percent fo r the Bank . 

Q A G ratings are consistent w i t h O ED assessments. A l l B r a z i l projects assessed fo r 1996-2002 
were ra ted satisfactory at entry (versus 98 percent fo r LAC and 87 percent fo r the Bank ) wh i le 86 percent 
were ra ted as satisfactorily supervised (versus 78 percent f o r L A C and 77 percent f o r the Bank). F o r the 
o r ig ina l CAS pe r iod 2000-2002, the p ropo r t ion o f Bank pro jec ts at risk has been about the same as the 
reg ion and the Bank.36 

Economic and Sector Work (ESW) 

B y the Bank’s own measures, the B raz i l p rog ram o f ESW has also fared we l l . The C A E reports 
that a l l ESW that was rated b y Q A G in the pe r iod 1996-2002 was rated as satisfactory (although one re - 
po r t has since received a marg ina l ly satisfactory rating), versus 82 percent fo r the reg ion and 8 1 percent 
Bank wide. The C A E echoed the Q A G finding on qua l i ty , but found that insu f f ic ien t d issem ina t ion had 
l im i t e d the impac t o f the studies. 

This last finding was pa r t ly based on consu l ta t ion w i t h the last Federal Governmen t (1998-2002) 
and i s being taken most seriously b y the country team in the design o f present and fu tu re ESW. OED also 
reported that government o f f ic ia ls no ted that some ESW responded to in fo rma l requests f r o m sector min- 
istries, who sometimes showed l im i t e d in te res t in f i n a l rev iew , diminishing p o l i c y impac t . These observa- 
tions have already led to procedural changes agreed be tween the Bank and the Government re la t ing to 
sponsorship and wo rk mon i tor ing . O n the pos i t ive side, o f f ic ia ls have ind ica ted tha t the Bank has been 
government’s favored mu l t i la te ra l partner fo r technical advice, and has an impo r tan t r o l e i n f o rm i n g soci- 
ety about long- term structural issues, solutions, and tradeo f fs . F ina l ly , d issem ina t ion e f fo r ts did increase 
during the past CAS period, w i t h Development Forums in B r a z i l in 2000 and 2001, and an in tens ive e f- 
fo r t to share the findings o f the Po l icy Notes w i t h government and society in la te 2002 and ear ly 2003. 
The Bank also increased i t s AAA partnerships in the las t C A S pe r iod and translated more reports i n t o 
Portuguese. There i s probab ly s t i l l r o om fo r fur ther improvemen t in these dimensions. 

PAR T D - OVERALL CONCLUS ION AND LESSONS 

Coun try performance has been strongest in the soc ia l sectors, w i t h progress o n education, health, 
and soc ia l protection. Bank support here has been most e f fec t ive in hea l th ( inc lud ing V ig isus and the new 
Fam i ly Hea l th Ex tens ion Project) and education ( inc lud ing state leve l projects and Fundescola). Coun t ry 
performance has also been strong on f isca l management, where Bank support th rough programma t ic p o l - 
icy-based lend ing and technical assistance has also been e f fec t ive , although here there has been less p ro - 
gress on imp rov ing the impac t o f government spending though e f f ic iency improvemen ts . 
B raz i l ’s weak growth, no tw i ths tand ing external shocks, i s traceable to lack o f progress and c la r i ty in the 
regu la tory environment, to l o w pub l ic and p r iva te inves tmen t in infrastructure, and t o an ine f f ic ien t , pub- 
lic-sector dominated f inanc ia l system. Bank performance has been good in places: adjustment lend ing and 
TA in the f inanc ia l sector and the energy sector were notable, and lend ing and AAA has been judged o f 
good qua l i ty . But ove ra l l the p rog ram has fa i led to mob i l ize growth-generating re fo rms at an adequate 
pace. 

36 The fraction o f projects “at r i s k ” i s a double-edged sword. A zero percent at-risk ra t io cou ld arguably be inter- 
preted as a sign o f an overly cautious management approach.

Pub l ic ins t i tu t iona l capacity remains a constraint, and in the 2000-2003 CAS pe r iod the Bank 
made l i t t l e headway in bu i ld ing i t s activities to a s u f f i c i e n t scale to see impact. J u d i c i a l re fo rm i s an area 
where the Bank’s program may be lay ing the groundwork fo r fu ture improvements, a l though i t i s too 
early to make t h i s judgmen t . In the next CAS period, qua l i ty o f spending and p u b l i c sector management 
reforms w i l l take a place closer to center stage. I t should be no ted that the last CAS t o o k a cautious ap- 
proach to d e f i n i n g the Bank’s ro le in governance and d i d n o t prom ise a large array o f ac t iv i t ies : nonethe- 
less, the emphasis o f this pillar in the CAS suggests that the Bank hoped to p lay a g rea te r ro le . 

S im i la r ly , coun try progress on environmental management has been d i rec ted mo re at ins t i tu t ion 
building than at execu t ion on the ground, and the Bank’s impact, although measurable in the areas where 
i t has focused, rema ins sma l l in re la t ion to the order o f the challenges. The Bank ’s app roach has also been 
cautious in this area, pa r t ly in the absence o f stronger demand f r om government. Howeve r , demand has 
begun to increase, wh ich wou ld prov ide v ind ica t ion fo r the Bank’s approach o f cons t i tuency building and 
selective p i l o t i n g in the last CAS period. Moreover, the Bank ’s con t r ibu t ion has been s ign i f ican t in those 
spheres where coun t ry progress on na tura l resources and the environment has been fas tes t . 

A no tab le feature o f the 2000-2003 CAS pe r iod has been the in t roduc t ion in B r a z i l o f program- 
ma t ic po l icy-based lending. These loans have proven e f fec t ive in ma in ta in ing in tens ive dialogues on f i s - 
cal, financial, and g row th po l ic ies . Government has ind ica ted satisfaction w i t h the f l e x i b i l i t y of the in- 
strument. One conc lus ion f r om the experience since 2001 i s the importance o f c om b i n i n g a b road de f in i - 
t i o n o f the r e f o rm p rog ram w i t h single-tranching w i t h i n each program. This p rov ides f l e x i b i l i t y but there- 
fore heightens the ro le o f Bank management in judg ing l i k e l y r e f o rm significance and effectiveness. B ra - 
z i l i s mov ing on to a complex, wide-ranging, second-generation r e f o rm agenda w i t h i n a decentralized fed- 
eration. This w i l l c a l l fo r the Bank’s assessment o f a correspondingly broad range o f measures f o r soc ia l 
progress and pove r ty reduction. Leg is la t ive progress w i l l be harder to define ex ante than in the case o f a 
narrower de f in i t ion o f a few structural measures that may have characterized past lend ing . This increases 
the gains f rom a f lex ib le approach and w ide program de f in i t ion . 

The past CAS pe r iod was also a pe r iod o f increas ing W o r l d Bank G roup phys ica l presence in 
B raz i l , w i t h expansion in Brasflia, a new o f f ice in Fortaleza, a con t inued IBRD presence in Rec i fe , and 
IFC offices in R i o de Janeiro and S8o Paulo. Government feedback has ind ica ted a s t rong pos i t ive e f fec t 
on the Bank’s responsiveness, a sentiment that corroborates the impressions already h e l d b y Bank s ta f f , 
Ove ra l l this repor t judges that the Bank made a s ign i f ican t con t r ibu t ion to B raz i l ian deve lopmen t in 2000- 
2003, pa r t icu la r ly in the f i r s t tw o p i l lars , where the CAS prom ised to focus the Bank ’s efforts and re- 
sources. This conc lus ion i s consonant w i t h the findings o f the recent CAE (1990-2002). Increased strate- 
g ic focus on the Northeast and on the re la t ionsh ip w i t h the states have pa id d iv idends , as has con t inued

Po r t fo l io performance imp roved substantially during second h a l f o f the 1990s (early to m id-1990s 
performance was poor), in the con tex t o f macroeconomic adjustment and a spec i f ic p o r t f o l i o “clean-up”

in the h igher category o f performers Bank-w ide , as measured b y OED impac t eva lua t ions , and o n the ba- 
s i s o f ongo ing performance mon i to r ing through the PSR system. F o r example, the percentage o f p rob lem

PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION CHALLENGES AND STRATEGIES 

There are three in ter- l inked sets o f imp lemen ta t ion challenges the coun try team faces in pursuing 
the program ou t l ined in the present CAS . 

0 First, con f ron t ing the operational challenges o f extremely limited fiscal space, at federal, state 
and loca l levels, wh ich have imp l ica t ions f o r b o t h the ongo ing po r t fo l io and the new lend ing pro- 
gram and leads towards greater programmatic approach to lend ing . 

Second, wo rk ing w i t h our clients to further strengthen government implementation systems, at 
bo th federal and sub-national level, in the con tex t o f more programmatic, systemic lend ing sup- 
po r t wh ich i s l e s s ind iv idua l transaction-oriented. 

Third, in the context o f greater results-focus and the programmatic lend ing strategy, p lac ing 
greater emphasis on better monitoring and evaluation. This includes b o t h he lp ing c l ien ts build 
better mon i to r ing and evaluation systems and management capacity but also establishing w i t h i n 
the Bank country team a mon i to r ing and eva lua t ion cu l ture that brings p ro jec t and p rog ram spe- 
c i f i c achievements in the context o f reaching B raz i l ’s broader development goals. 

1. The Operational Challenges of Limited Fiscal Space 

The pace o f loan disbursements has slowed marked ly over the course o f the last t w o t o three 
years - due to chron ica l ly inadequate budgetary resources fo r t ime ly imp lemen ta t ion at bo th federa l and 
state leve l - h igh l igh t ing a c ruc ia l unde r ly ing risk fac tor in the po r t fo l io . The disbursement ra t io at end 
F Y 0 3 reach just 12 percent (amount disbursed during the year d iv ided b y balance outstanding at the start 
o f the year), substantially be low h is tor ic performance leve ls (Table 2) and be low reg iona l and Bank aver- 
ages. Twe lve projects (23 percent) have triggered the s low-d isburs ing flag; and 7 (13 percent) carry the 
f inanc ia l performance flag. In l i g h t o f this issue, the B r a z i l management team has p laced 20 pro jec ts 
(nearly h a l f the po r t fo l io ) on a fo rma l “watch l i s t ” re f lec t ing the enhanced leve l o f risk re la ted to f inanc ia l 
performance. In the absence o f improvement, the number o f p rob lem pro jec ts c o u l d increase signifi- 
cant 1 y .

comb ined w i t h s ign i f ican t Constitutionally-mandated earmark ing o f expenditures leave l i t t l e r o o m f o r 
d iscre t ionary investment spending. Moreover, IF1 lending has since 1999 been e f fec t ive ly treated as a 
regu lar budget expenditure item, subject to overa l l f isca l targets and constraints. Prev ious ly , IF1 funding 
had de-facto been considered add i t iona l to the budget. These necessary and hea l thy measures have l e d to 
reduced budgetary space (a f fec t ing both the budget l i n e i t em fo r Bank f inanc ing as w e l l as the l i n e i t em 
f o r counterpart funding - a broader p rob lem than t rad i t iona l ly h igh l igh ted in the f inanc ia l per formance 
f l a g as “lack o f counterpart funds”). Budget execution r ig id i t ies iden t i f ied in the recen t (2002) Coun t ry 
F inanc ia l Assessment, wh ich inc lude per iod ic budget, freezes and a fragmented system, wh ich makes dif- 
f i c u l t adjustment to changes in p r io r i ty d i f f icu l t , compound the problem. At the state leve l , e f fec t ive im- 
p lemen ta t ion o f f isca l d isc ip l ine through the rules consolidated in the F isca l Respons ib i l i ty L a w have had 
a s im i la r effect. F ina l ly , devaluation over the last several years has translated i n t o larger do l la r - 
denominated loan balances than po ten t ia l ly needed to cover costs determined at appraisal. This i s re- 
f lec ted in a rather large undisbursed amount o f $2.7 b i l l i o n (wh ich magnifies the e f fec t o f s low disburse- 
men t s). 

The Bank has been wo rk ing closely w i t h the government, inc lud ing th rough a recent CPPR h e l d 
j o i n t l y w i t h the IDB - wh ich faces the same set o f imp lemen ta t ion challenges - t o address these issues. 
Among avenues are: 

a p lan f o r part ia l cancellations of loan balances where fund are no t needed o r cannot be used in 
the rema in ing pro jec t per iod . Agreement in p r inc ip le has been reached to cancel an impo r tan t 
share o f the undisbursed amount; 

close cooperation w i t h P lann ing and Finance m in is tr ies to improve a l ignment of projects with 
development and budgetary priorities in the con tex t o f the PPA, and be t ter forecast spec i f ic p ro - 
jec t ’s budget needs and ensure coord ina t ion w i t h the budget p lann ing and rev is ion processes; and 

expanded po l icy dialogue towa rd modernizing federal government budget execution rigidities 
iden t i f ied in the CFAA , and to be fur ther addressed in the F inanc ia l Managemen t Strategy (FMS), 
through our pub l ic sector management po l icy d ia logue as par t o f the broader f isca l programma t ic 
loan series and accompanying technical assistance. 

L a c k o f budget resources has also a f fec ted substantially the Bank ’s ab i l i ty t o comm i t new l e n d i n g 
commensurate w i t h B raz i l ’s f inanc ia l needs. This i s re f lec ted in longer lead - t ime f r o m App ra isa l to 
Board, in par t icu lar fo r sub-national borrowers. I t i s also re f lec ted in s low ing inves tmen t lend ing com - 
m i tmen ts in the 2000-2003 C A S per iod . The Bank and the government have j o i n t l y been exp lo r ing ways 
to address the lack o f f isca l space. A seminar in Ju ly 2003 on “New Instruments” sought innova t ions that 
wou ld he lp address the challenge o f supporting B r a z i l w i t h strategic f inanc ia l and techn ica l assistance in 
the con tex t o f f isca l constraints to bo r row ing and spending. 

While the seminar presented a var ie ty o f possible alternatives, sector wide approaches (S WAps ) 
were seen as p rom is ing f r om the government’s po in t o f v i ew as they wo rk w i t h ex is t ing government pri- 
o r i ty programs, use ex is t ing ins t i tu t ions and systems w h i l e helping strengthen them, and p rov ide a r e l i - 
able and re la t ive ly qu ick ly-d isburs ing source o f funding. SWAps thus address f i s c a l constraints b o t h b y 
t y i n g fund ing to highest p r i o r i t y programs and m i n im i z i n g the r i s k s o f budget cuts, w h i l e at the same t ime 
safeguarding a dependable f l o w o f funds. Selective lending at sub-national level to c red i two r thy mu- 
n ic ipa l o r state governments, p rov ided the p rog ram f inanced i s w i t h i n the state government’s budge t and 
that this budget i s prepared consistent w i t h f isca l targets agreed w i t h the federa l government, were also 
considered promising, and the federa l government and the Bank have agreed to deve lop c r i te r ia f o r poss i- 
b l e lend ing to sub-national governments, and regu lar ly discuss the program t o ensure i t i s consistent w i t h 
ove ra l l f isca l management. Pa r t ia l risk guarantees to attract the p r iva te sector we re also seen as a pos i -

sets out a l e n d i n g strategy that combines programmatic adjustment lending in suppo r t o f key po l icy re- 
forms w i t h enhanced use o f SWAps, in par t icu lar at federal level, as a key inves tmen t lend ing “platform,” 
as w e l l as a care fu l ly-se lec ted program o f sub-national lending. 

2. The Operat iona l Challenges of Programmatic, Systemic Lending 

Recent Bank and partner diagnostic wo rk indicates B r a z i l has a strong i n s t i t u t i o n a l framework fo r 
imp lemen ta t ion at the na t iona l level. At the sub-national, p re l im ina ry diagnostic w o r k suggest frame- 
works are l i k e l y sound but that ins t i tu t iona l capacity varies greatly and i s generally in need o f strengthen- 
ing. B raz i l ’s o v e r a l l sound f iduc iary framework, in par t icu lar at na t iona l level, forms a firm founda t ion 
for mov ing f o rw a r d w i t h a program o f sector w ide approach projects (SWAps). As pa r t o f the focus on 
these sector-wide approaches i t w i l l be important to wo rk w i t h the government, at federa l , state and mu- 
n ic ipa l level, to con t inue to strengthen these already strong imp lemen ta t ion systems. Am o n g the elements 
o f a strategy building and strengthening clients systems in this context during the CAS pe r iod are the f o l - 
low ing , fur ther discussed be low :

evaluations. While the diagnostic wo rk i s already p lanned and budgeted in the reg iona l bus iness 
plan, fur ther budgetary support fo r ex-post rev iews i s needed. 

Mainstreaming of the fiduciary strengthening agenda - including bo th systems modernization,

Development of a “safeguards assessment’’ t o o l t o he lp bring know ledge o f env ironmen ta l and

wou ld p rov ide a p la t fo rm fo r capacity and ins t i tu t ion building, as w e l l as a b i l i t y to gauge wh ich

two banks. 

The Bank has undertaken a recent (2002) Country F inanc ia l Accountability Assessment 
(CFAA ) , wh ich rated the country’s f inanc ia l accoun tab i l i ty systems and ins t i tu t ions as we l l-des igned and 
re l iab le in track ing budget expenditures w i t h a high degree o f transparency. T h e CFAA evaluated the 
systems as presenting l o w risk in terms o f use o f funds. S I A F I , the government’s f i n a n c i a l adm in is tra t ion 
system, provides a strong framework, wh ich the government i s comm i t ted t o fu r the r upgrading. How -

At the sub-national level, an ongoing State Financial Accountability Assessment (cover ing the 
states o f Bahia, Cear6 and Pernambuco) w i l l be comp le ted in FY04 . P re l im ina ry findings suggest a

3. The Operational Challenges of a Results-Based CAS 

This CAS has established the i n i t i a l framework f o r a results-based approach t o the Bank ’s p ro - 
gram o f support, closely l inked t o the government’s Mu l t i -yea r P lan (PPA) and the M i l l e n n i um Deve l - 
opment Goals (MDGs). The CAS establishes a regular semi-annual rev iew be tween the government and 

l o o 

A More Equitable, Sustainable, and Competitive Brazil - Country Assistance Strategy FY2003-2007 

Bank management that w i l l prov ide the basis fo r mon i to r ing and evaluating per formance and imp rov ing 
the r e s u l t s framework . 

To be successful, the results-based approach w i l l need to establish a clear link between country 
performance and Bank operational support. This translates in to the need fo r be t te r baseline data and 
mon i to r ing systems in our c l ien t agencies ( fo r wh ich operational support i s p lanned in this CAS). I t also 
translates in to better mon i to r ing o f outcomes in the con tex t o f imp lemen ta t ion o f Bank projects, and more 
frequent taking o f stock on the impac t o f specific programs and groups o f programs. As the Bank moves 
towards more programmatic and systemic lending support ( inc lud ing SWAps) f o r B r a z i l w i t h this CAS , 
there i s a par t icu lar oppor tun i ty to build e f fec t ive mon i to r ing and evaluation systems that help better 
evaluate outcomes wh i le also better quan t i fy ing the Bank’s par t icu lar con tr ibu t ion . 

A results based CAS w i l l need to place more focus on evaluation cu l ture during imp lemen ta t ion 
o f Bank operations, impac t assessments, strengthening o f c l ien t mon i to r ing systems and more systematic 
mon i to r ing o f resu l ts during implementation. Elements o f strategy to develop a c lose r link between p ro - 
jec t results measurement and the results-based CAS framework : 

Assist clients in establishing performance monitoring and evaluation systems. This wou ld in- 
c lude the federal government, through the PPA process and the Bank’s PER support, to states 
through “horizontal” components, and to ind iv idua l m i n i s t r i e s through techn ica l assistance and 
other activities, grant or loan financed. 

0 Development o f performance-linked disbursement pilots. Am o n g those be ing considered in- 
clude: Bank f inanc ing linked to “production,” e.g., number o f students graduated; f inanc ing 
l inked to midterm measures o f benchmarked performance; and var iab le f inanc ing ( f r om a “base” 
to a “high” rate) depending on targe t ing and mon i to r ing systems improvemen ts . 

Systematic attention to results framework and monitoring in the context of project preparation 
(Dec is ion Mee t ings to rev iew in par t icu lar link o f pro jec t log frame and m o n i t o r i n g system to re- 
sults-framework in CAS ) 

Regular reporting during implementation on results monitoring through superv is ion reports, in 
the context o f relevance to broader C A S objectives spelled ou t in the resu l ts matrices and the 
longer- term goals table. 

0 Portfolio performance indicators to be broadened to inc lude progress towa rds ach iev ing devel- 
opment objectives in the context o f B raz i l ’s med ium- term outcomes and longe r - te rm goals as es- 
tablished in the C A S and through semi-annual rev iew w i t h government. 

Joint government and Bank learning in results measurement and mon itor ing , e.g., inc lud ing a 
t ra in ing event and a seminar to share in terna t iona l experiences f o r early ca lendar 2004.

ANNEX 4: Poverty Trends in the 1990s 

Since 1997, poverty levels have remained re la t ive ly stable but the pove r ty p r o f i l e has changed 
s ign i f ican t ly . Desp i te the ser ies o f adverse macroeconomic shocks that reduced t h e g row th rate o f the 
B raz i l ian economy over this period, the overa l l pover ty ra te did no t rise, hove r ing at the 28 - 29 percent 
leve l . The s tab i l i ty o f the poverty rate resulted f r om the comb ina t ion o f a f a l l in rural pover ty and a r ise in 
urban pover ty . S im i la r ly , there was a f a l l in poverty rates in the N o r t h and Northeast, and a r ise in pover ty 
rates in the Southeast and Center West. 

The e f fec t o f the economic down turn was concentrated in me tropo l i tan areas; i t resulted in high 
unemployment and a permanent f a l l in labor income in the indus t r ia l sectors that c o u l d be associated w i t h 
the increase in urban pover ty . Also, exchange rate deva lua t ion negatively a f fec ted service sector prices, 
ha rm ing the poo r and urban workers the most. As a result, pover ty levels in me t ropo l i tan areas, espe- 
c ia l ly the me t ropo l i tan periphery o f the Southeast region, rose substantially. 

Conversely, ru ra l areas were less affected b y s low ing g row th and the macroeconom ic vo la t i l i ty , 
w i t h the poorest populations somewhat sheltered. Add i t iona l ly , improvements in B r a z i l i a n soc ia l p o l i c y 
led to a w ide r and more e f f ic ien t social safety net, and broader access o f the poo r t o p u b l i c goods and ser- 
vices a l lev ia ted the impac t o f the cr is is on the poorest. 

The comb ina t ion o f the urban nature o f the impac t o f the economic cr is is and the ab i l i ty o f gov- 
ernment po l ic ies t o protect the poor in the ru ra l Northeast l e d to a s ign i f ican t change in the B raz i l ian pov - 
erty p ro f i le . I t i s clear that the incidence o f pover ty in r u r a l areas and in the No r theas t reg ion continues to 
be high; however the increasing pover ty trends in me t ropo l i tan areas are more worrying and c a l l f o r a 
change in the pover ty reduc t ion strategy. The broader repercussion o f the p rob lems associated w i t h the 
increasing me tropo l i tan poverty, expressed in the recent sp ike in urban v io lence a n d in h igher unemp loy - 
ment, suggest that a stronger focus on me tropo l i tan pove r ty reduc t ion i s needed. 

This annex contents f i v e parts. The first describes the trend o f pover ty leve ls in the nineties, f o - 
cusing on the pe r iod 1997-2001. The second analyses the change in the pover ty p r o f i l e du r ing the pe r iod 
1998 to 2001. The third par t describes the ro le o f social p o l i c y in the a l lev ia t ion o f t h e effects o f the cr is is 
in recent years. The fou r th par t reports the resu l ts o f the inc idence analysis o f education, sanitation and 
pub l ic goods p rov ided b y the government, c lear ly show ing that the access o f the p o o r to pub l ic services 
was broadened. F ina l ly , the last section summarizes the m a i n findings and suggests p o l i c y options. 

POVERTY TRENDS I N THE NINETIES AND THE METROPOLITAN 
CRISIS OF 1997-2001 

The evo lu t ion o f pover ty in B r a z i l in the last decade can be d iv ided i n t o three phases: i) the peak- 
ing o f pover ty levels in the early nineties reaching 36 percent in 1992/93, due t o the high i n f l a t i o n and 
macroeconomic vo la t i l i ty ; ii) the strong reduc t ion in pove r ty leve ls f r o m 1994, a t ta in ing 29.8 percent 
in1996, resu l t ing f r om the end o f the in f la t iona ry pe r iod and the resump t ion o f g r ow t h p romo ted b y the 
p r ice and general macroeconomic s tab i l i ty ; and iii) a re la t ive ly stable pover ty ra te o f 29-30 percent over 

102

the last f i v e years in a very d i f f icu l t macroeconomic s i tua t ion characterized b y a series o f adverse shocks 
that caused a s lowdown in GDP g row th and high vo la t i l i ty (see f igu re u3'. 
The re la t ive s tab i l i ty o f pover ty in a context o f high economic vo la t i l i ty and l o w g row th during 
the 1997-2002 pe r iod contrasts w i t h the s ign i f ican t change in the pover ty p r o f i l e tha t occurred in these 
years. The stronger impac t o f the economic crisis in me t ropo l i tan areas produced a change in the pove r ty 
pro f i le , and the improvement in social po l icy prevented the worsening o f pover ty . 
Since 1997 the B raz i l ian economy has suffered macroeconomic shocks tha t resulted in a sharp 
s lowdown in GDP g row th and in terrup ted the pover ty reduc t ion trend caused b y the economic stabiliza- 
t i o n in 1994. T h e e f fec t o f this economic down turn has been concentrated in me t ropo l i tan areas and was 
expressed in high unemployment and the permanent f a l l o f labor income in these areas. The unemp loy- 
ment rate rose f r o m 6.9 percent in 1996 to 9.6 percent in 2001. Per cap i ta income f e l l b y 1.8 percent in 
me tropo l i tan areas du r ing the pe r iod 1996-2001. As a resu l t , f igu re 1 shows tha t me t ropo l i tan pove r ty 
grew f r om 17 percent in 1998 to 20 percent in 2001, and u rban pover ty rose f r om 24 percent to 26 percent 
between 1996 and 2001.39 
Da ta f r o m PME that covers on ly the biggest s ix me tropo l i tan areas, and inc ludes on ly labo r in- 
come, shows a more dramatic p ic ture : pover ty levels in the me tropo l i tan areas experienced a sharp in- 
crease f r om 26 percent in 1998 to 29 percent in 2001. The me tropo l i tan areas o f the Southeast, especially 
in the me t ropo l i tan periphery, were the most affected areas. R i o de Janeiro me t ropo l i tan pover ty g rew 
f r om 26 percent t o 3 1 percent wh i le SZo Paul0 me t ropo l i tan poverty increased f r o m 2 1 percent to 25 per- 
cent between 1998 and 2001. 
As a consequence, poverty in the Southeast reg ions rose f r om 15 percent in 1998 to 17 percent in 
2001, wh i le pover ty f e l l f r om 54 percent to 53 percent in the Northeast and f r om 39 percent to 37 percent 
in the N o r t h between 1998 and 2001. 
Due to i t s stronger impac t in urban areas, the nega t ive effects o f the GDP s lowdown ma in ly a f - 
fected the groups pos i t ioned in the m idd le o f the B raz i l ian income d is tr ibu t ion . Be tween 1997 and 2001, 
the income o f the r i c h e s t 10 percent o f the popu la t ion decreased b y 0.7 percent pe r year, and the income 
of the poorest 50 percent experienced an increase o f 0.8 percent. The rest o f the popu la t ion experienced 
an annual income decrease o f 1.1 percent. 

Since ru ra l areas were no t as a f fec ted b y the high macroeconomic vo la t i l i ty and the l o w grow th , 
the pover ty rate in ru ra l areas f e l l f r o m 57 in 1996/97 t o 54 percent in 2001. Add i t iona l ly , a series o f 
measures implemented b y the federal government, that w i l l be described below, smoothed the e f fec t o f 
the macroeconomic cr is is on the ru ra l populations, espec ia l ly in the Northeast and N o r t h regions. In this 
sense, the economic down turn o f the las t years did no t hurt the poorest groups o f popu la t ion .

38 Braz i l does not have an o f f i c i a l poverty l i n e and research institutions use different poverty l i n e s that lead to d i f - 
feren t numbers on poverty. The poverty l i n e used in the study was established at around R$80 in SBo Paulo (metro- 

po l i tan area) p r ices o f July 2001, and adjusted fo r each region using a regional p r ice index based on the consumption 
pro f i le o f the population group with incomes between the lowes t quintile and the median o f the income distribution. 

This value i s close to that selected by the Fome Zero program and to the eligibility poverty l e v e l for the Alvorada 

project, making this analysis useful for p rac t ica l purposes. I t i s based on the c r i te r ion that each person must consume 
at leas t 2288 ca lor ies per day (the minimum l e v e l required fo r adequate nutrition, according to WHO). I n the p rev i - 
ous CAS, the poverty rate was lower, because housing imputed ren t was included in the ca lcu la t ion for income; in 

the present CAS, housing imputed rent i s not included. 

3 9 The structural reform agenda also adversely affected some groups in metropolitan areas. For example, the open- 

ness o f the economy affected blue co l la r worker from SBo Paulo, the privatization o f state enterprises affected public 

workers from Rio de Janeiro, etc.

The re la t ive s tab i l i ty o f poverty in a context o f high economic vo la t i l i ty a n d l o w g row th during 
the 1997-2002 p e r i o d contrasts w i t h the s ign i f ican t change in the pover ty p ro f i le tha t occurred in these 
years. The stronger impact o f the economic crisis in me tropo l i tan areas produced a change in the pove r ty 
p ro f i le , and the improvemen t in social po l icy prevented the worsening o f pover ty . 
Since 1997 the B raz i l ian economy has suffered macroeconomic shocks that resulted in a sharp 
s lowdown in GDP g row th and interrupted the pover ty reduc t ion trend caused by the economic s tab i l iza- 
t i o n in 1994. T h e e f fec t o f this economic down turn has been concentrated in me t ropo l i tan areas and was 
expressed in high unemployment and the permanent f a l l o f labor income in these areas. The unemp loy- 
ment rate rose f r o m 6.9 percen t in 1996 to 9.6 percent in 2001. Per capita income f e l l b y 1.8 percent in 
me tropo l i tan areas during the per iod 1996-2001. As a result, figure 1 shows that me t ropo l i tan pove r ty 
grew f r om 17 percen t in 1998 to 20 percent in 2001, and u rban pover ty rose f r om 2 4 percent to 26 percent 
between 1996 and 2001.4' 
Da ta f r o m PME that covers on ly the biggest s ix me tropo l i tan areas, and inc ludes on ly labo r in- 
come, shows a mo re dramatic picture: poverty levels in the me tropo l i tan areas experienced a sharp in- 
crease f r om 26 percent in 1998 to 29 percent in 2001. The me tropo l i tan areas o f the Southeast, espec ia l ly 
in the me t ropo l i tan periphery, were the most affected areas. R i o de Janeiro me t ropo l i tan pover ty grew 
f r o m 26 percent t o 3 1 percent wh i le SBo Paulo me t ropo l i tan pover ty increased f r o m 2 1 percent t o 25 per- 
cent between 1998 and 2001. 
As a consequence, poverty in the Southeast reg ions rose f r om 15 percent in 1998 to 17 percent in 
2001, wh i le pove r ty f e l l f r om 54 percent to 53 percent in the Northeast and f r om 3 9 percent t o 37 percent 
in the N o r t h between 1998 and 2001. 
Due to i t s stronger impac t in urban areas, the negative effects o f the GDP s lowdown ma in ly a f - 
fected the groups pos i t ioned in the m idd le o f the B raz i l ian income d is tr ibu t ion . Be tween 1997 and 2001, 
the income o f the richest 10 percent o f the popu la t ion decreased b y 0.7 percent pe r year, and the income 
o f the poorest 50 percent experienced an increase o f 0.8 percent. The r e s t o f the popu la t ion experienced 
an annual income decrease o f 1.1 percent. 
Since ru ra l areas were no t as affected b y the high macroeconomic vo la t i l i ty and the l o w grow th , the 
pover ty rate in ru ra l areas f e l l f r om 57 in 1996/97 to 54 percent in 2001. Add i t iona l ly , a series o f meas- 
ures imp lemen ted b y the federal government, that w i l l b e described be low , smoothed the e f fec t o f the 
macroeconomic cr is is on the ru ra l populations, especially in the Northeast and N o r t h regions. I n this 
sense, the economic down turn o f the last years did no t hurt the poorest groups o f popu la t ion . 

THE CHANGE IN THE POVERTY PROF ILE 

As mentioned above, the urban nature o f the economic cr is is o f the last f e w years l e d to a signifi- 
cant change in the pover ty p ro f i le . The incidence o f pove r ty continues to be greater in ru ra l areas, but the 
evo lu t ion o f pover ty in me tropo l i tan areas increased the share o f the to ta l poo r in u rban areas in ove ra l l 
pover ty . Table 1 shows that in 1998, me tropo l i tan and u rban poor represented, respec t ive ly , 18 percent 
and 43 percent o f the B raz i l ian poor . In 2001, me t ropo l i tan and urban poo r respec t ive ly represented 22 
percent and 48 percent o f ove ra l l poor . The ru ra l poor reduced their share o f the to ta l poor f r o m 39 pe r - 
cent in 1998 to 36 percent in 2001. 

40 The structural reform agenda also adversely affected some groups in metropolitan areas. For example, the open- 
ness o f the economy affected blue co l lar worker from SBo Paulo, the privatization o f state enterprises affected public 
workers from R io de Janeiro, etc.

Compar ing the poverty pro f i les o f 1998 and 2001, one observes other impo r tan t changes. First, 
there i s a reg iona l change in the pover ty pro f i le , w i t h the share o f the Northeast (of to ta l poor) reduced 
f r om 55 percent in 1998 to 52 percent in 2001, and w i t h the share in the Southeast rising f r om 24 percent 
in 1998 to 26 percent in 200141. 

Pover ty incidence increased among you th w i t h the increased con t r ibu t ion o f young peop le to 
ove ra l l pover ty . Pover ty in people under 25 increased f r o m 36 percent in 1998 to 3 9 percent in 2001. F o r 
people between 25 and 44 years o f age, poverty increased f r om 3 1 percent in 1998 t o 33 percent in 2001, 
wh i le pover ty among people older than 65 f e l l f r om 19 percent in 1998 to 16 percen t in 2001. Thus, the 
face o f the average poor person i s younger in 2001 than in 1998, as the share o f peop le under 45 years o f 
age in ove ra l l pove r ty grew f r om 58 percent to 62 percent. 

The pove r ty rate among people w i thou t education o r w i t h 1 year o f educa t ion f e l l f r om 53 percen t 
t o 5 1 percent, wh i le i t grew in a l l the other educational subgroups. The con t r ibu t ion o f people w i t h 1 year 
o r less o f education in to ta l pover ty f e l l f r om 38 percent t o 33 percent between 1998 and 2001. The great- 
est worsening in pover ty occurred in the intermediary educa t iona l groups w i t h 1 to 8 years o f educa t ion 
whose pover ty rates increased b y 4 percentage po in ts over the 1998-2001 per iod . As a consequence, the 
re la t ionsh ip between education and pover ty was weakened. 

Regard ing labor status, the s ign i f ican t increase in pover ty among unemp loyed people rose f r o m 
58 in 1998 percent to 64 percent in 2001, re f lec t ing another urban c r i s i s . A lso , in 2001, in forma l-sec tor 
employees were poorer (45 percent) than in 1998 (42 percent). As a resu l t , the share o f unemp loyed and 
in fo rma l workers’ pover ty in ove ra l l pover ty increased f r o m 6 percent to 8 percent and f r om 19 percen t to 
2 1 percent, respectively. 

The pover ty p ro f i le , when v iewed b y type o f economic ac t iv i ty , also shows a greater degree o f 
pover ty worsening in sectors concentrated in urban areas. C i v i l cons truc t ion and services were the sectors 
where pover ty increased, wh i le pover ty in agr icu l ture ac t iv i t ies was reduced. Be tween 1998 and 2001, 
pover ty incidence in the cons truc t ion sector grew f r om 29 percent to 3 1 percent, and in services f r o m 18 
percent to 20 percent. In agriculture, the pover ty rate f e l l f r o m 56 percent to 54 percen t wh i le pove r ty in 
the indus t r ia l sector was stable at 21 percent. As a consequence, the con t r ibu t ion o f agr icu l ture to ove ra l l 
pover ty f e l l f r om 36 percent to 3 1 percent. 

4 1 Another evidence o f the metropolitan c r is is comes f rom the migratory f lows which tend to reac t when faced w i th 
economic and social changes, becoming a good measurement o f the re la t ive attraction o f several locations. H is to r i - 
cally, the non-immigrant status in Brazil tends to increase as we move f r om large c i t i e s towards l e s s densely popu- 
lated areas. For example, in 2001 the percentage o f the na t ive population was 75.1% in metropolitan areas and 
84.9% i n rural areas. This migration f l ow was mostly directed from the Northeast region to the Southeast region. 
However, the comparison o f more recen t migration f lows occurring show that in the south-east 0.39% migrated less 
than one year before 2001 while the same s ta t is t ics for the northeast reached 1.06%.

L e t us l o o k at a few scenarios useful in the eva lua t ion o f pover ty a l lev ia t ion targets, app ly ing 
standard Rava l l ion- type techniques o f decomposition o f pover ty , between g row th and inequa l i ty compo- 
nents, at a Na t iona l leve l . 
The p ropo r t ion o f poor in B r a z i l wou ld drop f r o m the current 28.7 percen t observed in 2001 to 
23.6 percent, i f per capita na t iona l income grew 5 percent per annum, f o r fou r consecu t ive years. Tha t 
means that nearly nine m i l l i o n Braz i l ians wou ld cross the pover ty l i n e in the nex t f e w years. But the t rue 
social m irac le wou ld happen i f a l l this g row th came concurren t ly w i t h a reduc t ion in inequa l i ty . I f the 
assumed accumulated economic expansion o f 21.6 percent were to be comb ined with a drop o f 8.5 per- 
cent in the Gini coefficient4*, the pover ty rate in B r a z i l w o u l d decrease to near ly h a l f o f i t s i n i t i a l va lue 
(39.7 percent), reaching a value o f 17.3 percent. This w o u l d r e s u l t in the o r ig ina l l e v e l o f 48,824 m i l l i o n 
poo r people be ing reduced in number to 29,427 m i l l ion . 
In reality, pover ty cou ld experience a substantial decrease, even i f the coun t ry does no t g row over 
the course o f the nex t f i v e years. The 8.5 percent reduc t ion in the Gini index alone w o u l d reduce the p ro - 
po r t ion o f indigents b y 8.3 percentage points, as compared t o 5.1 percentage po in ts tha t cou ld be achieved 
in the prev ious ly men t ioned 21.6 percent pure g row th scenario. Unbalanced income d is t r ibu t ion i s re - 
sponsible fo r B raz i l ian pover ty , and w i t h i n i t resides the m a i n short-term so lu t ion . T o reduce inequa l i ty in 
an economic boom con tex t seems more feasible than in recessive times, when losses are be ing shared 
across popu la t ion subgroups. 

42 I t i s worth mentioning that this decrease would bring the Brazilian inequality-as measured by the Gini index- 

from 0.60 to 0.55, already found in the state o f ,520 Paulo.

BRAZILIAN POLICY REGARDING POVERTY REDUCTION 

The improvement o f B raz i l ian social po l icy and t h e broader access o f the poo r to pub l ic goods 
and services also a l lev ia ted the impac t o f the crisis on the poorest. The government’s soc ia l p ro tec t ion 
ne two rk a l lev ia ted the negative e f f e c t o f the cr is is on the poorest, especially in r u r a l areas o f the Northeast 
region. Cer ta in ly , du r ing the last f i v e years, there was a focus on imp lemen t ing ins t i tu t iona l changes in 
federal soc ia l po l icy that resulted in the improvement o f soc ia l programs. F r o m iso la ted and emergency 
measures to more in-depth programs based on cond i t iona l income transfers, the government was able to 
protect the poorest and avo id the r ise o f pover ty levels that cou ld have resulted f r o m the economic crisis. 
Among the iso la ted measures, the first was the imp lemen ta t ion o f L O A S transfers (BPC) d irec ted

1998, wo rk fa re programs were adopted that employed around one m i l l i o n ind iv idua ls in the ru ra l area o f 
the Northeast43. F ina l ly , starting in 1998, the federal government began to progress ive ly index soc ia l se- 
cu r i ty payments to the minimum wage, wh ich rose faster than in f la t ion , p romo t ing rea l increases in the

cost-benefit ra t io o f g iv ing a 10 percent increase on ly t o those earning the cons t i tu t iona l f loo r o f one

Regard ing integrated pover ty reduc t ion policies, in 2000 the government in tegra ted 15 separate

CONCLUSIONS AND PO L IC Y IMPL ICAT IONS 

The pover ty rate f e l l after the economic s tab i l iza t ion o f 1994 f r om 36 percen t t o 29 percent, and 
has hovered around 28-29 percent since then. But wh i le the pover ty rate has been stable, the pove r ty p ro - 
f i l e has changed. B raz i l ’s pover ty continues to be la rge ly rural, and extreme pove r ty i s concentrated in 
the large ly semi-arid Northeast reg ion o f the country. 

However, since the macroeconomic cr is is o f the las t few years nega t ive ly a f fec ted labor income 
and unemployment in indus t r ia l sectors, and since the exchange rate deva lua t ion reduced the income o f 
service sector workers, there has been a marked increase in pover ty in the me t ropo l i tan areas, espec ia l ly 
in the Southeast region. Thus, i t must be recognized that the emphasis o f pove r ty reduc t ion strategy has 
sh i f ted at the margin towards urban pover ty . 

F ina l ly , the comparison o f the impacts o f g row th and income red is t r ibu t ion on pover ty high- 
l igh ted the high po ten t ia l impac t o f income red is tr ibu t ion po l ic ies o n pover ty reduc t ion .

ANNEX 5: P r iva te Sector Strategy 

I - INTRODUCTION 

The B r a z i l Pr iva te Sector Strategy (PSS) forms an in teg ra l part o f the W o r l d Bank Group 's Coun - 

t ry Assistance S tra tegy (CAS), wh ich i s guided b y the vision for a more equitable, sustainable, and com- 

petitive Brazil. To this end, B raz i l needs higher and more e f f ic ien t investment f o r h ighe r growth, l e d b y 
the p r iva te sector. In order to stimulate pr iva te sector investment, improvements are needed in terms o f 
access to financing, f inanc ing costs, logistics, infrastructure, the business environment, and human cap i- 
tal. Concurren t ly , corporate social responsibility, and other various means f o r the p r iva te sector t o con- 
tr ibu te to B raz i l 's soc ia l progress w i l l be a fundamental aspect o f this PSS. The PSS in the f i r s t pa r t p ro - 
vides a diagnosis o f the p r inc ipa l impediments faced b y the pr iva te sector. The second par t de ta i ls the 
WBG's strategy f o r addressing these impediments. 

11 - BACKGROUND - BRAZIL IN THE 1990s 

A more resilient and more competitive private sector 

The B r a z i l i a n pr iva te sector has gone through a series o f external shocks, making i t s pa th towa rds 
development l o o k l i k e a "ro l ler coaster ride," re f lec ted in the w ide f luc tua t ions o f the rea l exchange rate, 
and sovereign risk spreads (see graphs below).

W h i l e B r a z i l has no t enjoyed a smooth ride, i t has come a l o n g way on bo th the economic and the 
soc ia l fronts. The fac t that B r a z i l has ma in ta ined a pos i t ive GD P g row th (1.5 percent in 2002) in the face 
o f high vo la t i l i ty in the f inanc ia l markets and Rea l depreciation i s a testament o f the resilience o f i t s 
economy, and o f the p r iva te sector. Despite exper ienc ing a considerable drop since 2002, FDI levels have 
g rown s ign i f ican t ly since 1995 averaging US$25 b i l l i o n pe r year f o r the las t f i v e years (more than three 
times the annual average attained in the previous f i v e years) making B r a z i l the second-highest rec ip ien t o f 
FDI in the deve lop ing wo r ld . A t the same time, education and hea l th levels have imp roved and more 
people have access to basic services compared to a decade ago. Today B r a z i l has a more res i l ien t econ- 
omy, a more compe t i t ive p r iva te sector, and a better educated and hea l th ier wo rk force than 10 years ago. 

However , the recent g row th performance has been modest - much lowe r than the coun try 's po - 
ten t ia l . GDP per cap i ta g row th in the 1990s averaged on ly 1.2 percent per year and unemp loymen t re- 
mains at a leve l above 10 percent. B r a z i l has the po ten t ia l to g row n o t on ly faster but in an equitable and 
sustainable way. T o g row under the current g loba l environment, B r a z i l w i l l need t o focus in areas where 
pub l ic and p r iva te sector actions help imp rove B raz i l 's competitiveness. 

A growing private sector 

Re forms in the 1990s had a s ign i f ican t impac t o n the development o f the p r iva te sector in B raz i l . 
Since the in t roduc t ion o f the Plano Rea l , B raz i l 's p r iva te sector env ironmen t went through a series o f ma- 
j o r changes, wh ich inc luded among others: the abo l i t ion o f state monopolies, the p r iva t iza t ion o f state 
enterprises, and the res truc tur ing and p r iva t iza t ion o f some state banks. The B raz i l ian p r iva t iza t ion p ro - 
g ram has been a ma jo r under tak ing b y in terna t iona l standards. The share o f employees wo rk ing f o r the 
p r iva te sector has increased s ign i f ican t ly , pa r t icu la r ly in the case o f u t i l i t ies (see F igu re 3). Be tween 
1992-2001, p r iva te pa r t ic ipa t ion rose s ign i f ican t ly in telecom, e lec tr ic i ty , transport, water and sanitation, 
w i t h the sale o f government shares and concession rights generating U S $ 5 8 b i l l i o n in revenue. These sec- 
tors experienced substantial s truc tura l and regu la tory reforms, emphasizing the ro le o f compe t i t ion .

issues as a key obstacle to growth, notably institutional truasitions. K e y state ins t i tu t ions are s t i l l sending

Access to long t e rm financing - During the past tw o years, even large B raz i l ian corporates have 
seen their access to l o n g te rm f inanc ing come d ow n s ign i f ican t ly , especially since September 2002. 
BNDES i s the on ly ma jo r cred i t ins t i tu t ion wh ich has ma in ta ined i t s leve l o f cred i t operations. W h i l e the 
decrease since September 2002 was in par t tr iggered by marke t concerns preceding the pres iden t ia l elec- 
tions, the leve ls o f l o n g te rm cred i t t o B raz i l ian corporates were already quite l o w before, and have n o t 
recovered since. Corporations in B r a z i l are the m a i n dr ivers f o r g row th and employment. The i r leve l o f 
ac t iv i ty has a strong impac t on other smaller companies wh ich are suppliers. I f B raz i l ian corporates are 
unable to access l o n g te rm credit, they cannot f inance the ir cap i ta l expenditure program, inves t in to in- 
creasing p roduc t iv i ty , o r restructure the ir debt (no tab ly in fras truc ture companies). This in turn adversely 
affects smaller companies in B r a z i l because o f the ir business linkages to the b igger companies. 

The B raz i l ian p r iva te sector faces bo th a c rowd ing ou t and an external f inanc ing shortage situa- 
tions. Government bo r row ing continues to displace c red i t to the pr iva te sector. The f inanc ia l sector i s 
in termed ia t ing to government, rather than the p roduc t ive sectors, resu l t ing in l o w access to domestic l o n g 
te rm f inanc ing . With respect to in terna t iona l markets, despite recent improvements, access t o l o n g te rm 
fo re ign f inanc ing remains constrained. 

H i g h leve l o f interest rates and h igh in te rmed ia t ion costs. B raz i l 's burden o f i t s pub l ic debt 

remains a ma jo r fac tor f o r a high leve l o f interest through b o t h f inanc ia l markets perceptions o f B r a z i l 
risk and c rowd ing ou t o f the p r iva te sector in the domestic market. This pressures interest rates upwa rd 
wh i le diminishing the ava i lab i l i ty o f long - te rm lend ing . In add i t ion to these macroeconomic considera- 

 
 
A M o r e Equitable, Sustainable, and Competitive Brazil - Country Assistance Strategy 2003-2007

tions, there are factors at the m ic ro level, such as weak creditors rights and underdevelopment o f the do- 
mestic cap i ta l markets, that also a f fec t the ava i lab i l i ty and in termed ia t ion costs o f f inanc ing . 

Further development of capital markets is needed to increase access to long-term financing. 
The ro le o f securities markets in mob i l iz ing non-bank finance fo r pr iva te business i s very l im i ted . This i s 
essentially due to: (i) the public sector i s the ma in borrower w i t h more than 80 percent o f domestic debt 
securities accounted fo r b y government bonds; (ii) a s ign i f ican t par t o f these securities in fac t mob i l izes 
bank finance (i.e. they are funded b y bank deposits rather than cap i ta l market investors); and (iii) l iqu id i ty 
in equ i ty markets i s l o w f o r vo t ing shares (most vo t ing shares are no t traded), d iscourag ing investors and 
equ i ty issuers on account o f p r ice vo la t i l i ty . 

However, the po ten t ia l f o r the development o f securities markets in B r a z i l appears substantial, 
pa r t icu la r ly considering the size and pace o f g row th o f ins t i tu t iona l inves tor funds. At present, most o f 
these ins t i tu t iona l investor resources are he ld b y pension and mu tua l funds. To ta l assets o f ins t i tu t iona l 
investors are estimated at about US$120 b i l l i o n o r 22 percent o f GDP, the h ighes t among L a t i n Amer ican 
countries excepting Ch i le . With the upcom ing pension reform, accelerated g row th can b e expected. 

A number o f obstacles h inder the development o f securities markets. The overarch ing constraint, 
as discussed above, i s the sizeable government re f inanc ing needs. In addition, there are ma jo r de f ic ien- 
cies in corporate governance, w i t h m ino r i ty shareholders undu ly exposed to r i s k s o f expropr ia t ion b y con- 
t r o l l i n g shareholders, no t least because o f poo r p ropo r t iona l representation on boards, the non-adherence 
t o the one-share-one-vote pr inc ip le , among others. Governance i s also weakened because there are few 
vo t ing shares and even fewer traded. Transaction costs in securities trad ing are high re la t ive to developed 
markets. Regulatory respons ib i l i t ies are scattered across a number o f agencies, crea t ing some overlaps in 
func t ion and differences in the qua l i ty o f supervision. Human resources o f C VM (Com iss l io de Vulores 
Mob i l iu r ios do B rus i l - B raz i l ian Securities and Exchange Commission) are stretched and i t s enforcement 
powers weak, weakening i t s capacity t o investigate and enforce. 

D e f a u l t and ove rhead costs m a k e c r e d i t scarce and expensive. Weak cred i tor rights, poo r bor- 
rowe r screening, and insu f f ic ien t cred i tor protection, a l l factor in to make c red i t scarce and expensive. 
These a re re f lec ted in B raz i l ’s ex traord inar i ly high interest rate spreads and in the high de fau l t and over- 
head costs embedded in these spreads. Acco rd ing to the Central Bank, the large spreads charged b y B ra - 
z i l ian banks in B r a z i l can be d iv ided i n t o adm in is tra t ive expenses (14 percent), taxes (29 percent), p ro f i ts 
(40 percent) and the cost o f de fau l t (17 percent). One par t icu lar p rob lem in the development o f f inanc ia l 
markets i s the inab i l i ty o f lenders to adequately enforce loan contracts because o f the inadequacy o f ex is t- 
ing bankrup tcy laws. Measures addressing these issues, some o f wh ich are already under prepara t ion o r 
have begun to be implemented, cou ld con tr ibu te to reduc ing the cost o f in termed ia t ion . 
M i c r o f i n a n c e - Commerc ia l m icro f inance penetration in B r a z i l remains l o w compared to 
ne ighbo r ing countries such as Peru and Bo l iv ia , o r smaller countries such as N icaragua and E l Salvador. 
The market fo r m icro f inance in B r a z i l i s vast and i t s g row th po ten t ia l i s enormous. M icroen trepreneurs

B. Logistics costs4’ 

High log is t ics costs put B r a z i l on a disadvantageous pos i t ion vis-&-vis competitors, i f B r a z i l wants t o 
compete in terna t iona l ly . A recent W o r l d Bank study estimates log is t ics costs in B r a z i l to be about 20 
percknt o f GDP, s im i lar to 
ne ighbor ing countries but 
almost tw ice the leve l in 
O ECD countries (see Fig- 
u re 7). These high costs 
are c lear ly a concern to 
exporters as 
they erode 
the ir compe t i t ive edge 
against competitors 
in 
other countries.

T r a n s p o r t a n d t ranssh ipmen t costs have been estimated at about 2 percent o f GDP. B raz i l ’s

cargo theft, and evidence o f overcapacity, w i t h a large share o f empty re turn trips. The poo r cond i t ion o f 
road ne tworks (resu l t ing f r om l o w levels o f investment in the past 20 years) further reduces the e f f ic iency 
and re l iab i l i ty o f t ruck ing services, increas ing operating costs b y 10-30 percent and a f fec t ing de l ive ry

Adm in i s t r a t i v e logistics (customs, losses and insurance) - Fo r B raz i l ian firms invo lved in fo r - 
e ign trade, customs represent a ma jo r cost f o r exports, more than 10 percent o f opera t ing costs on aver- 
age. Outdated customs procedures and practices add another burden fo r B raz i l ’s exports. A modest re- 
duc t ion in log is t ics costs of, say, 15 percent cou ld reduce firms’ costs b y about 5 percent on average, 
wh ich cou ld have a substantial impac t on B raz i l ’s economic growth. F ina l ly , improvemen ts in the log is -

The power outage o f 2001 ind ica ted that the benefits o f regu la tory r e f o rm and p r iva t iza t ion have 
no t been as substantial as in the te lecom sector. The energy crisis po in ted to serious weaknesses in the 
sector, wh ich i f no t addressed rap id ly cou ld in the medium te rm evo lve in to a ma jo r constraint t o eco- 
nom ic g row th and p roduc t iv i ty . In light o f the current s i tua t ion some p r iva te sector companies have even 
started to inves t in their o w n generation fac i l i t ies , thereby increasing the i r cost o f do ing business. 

Issues in the powe r sector are the d irec t consequences o f an uncomp le ted r e f o rm program, mag- 
n i f i e d b y the Rea l devaluation, the lack o f access to l o n g te rm credit, and the increase in sovereign r i s k s . 
B r a z i l has yet to have a general powe r sector re fo rm l aw w i t h a c lear ly stated ta r i f f -se t t ing system. This 
sector has suffered f r om the vagueness in tar i f f-se t t ing prov is ions and other regu la tory weaknesses, fo r - 
e ign exchange risk due to the “do l lar costheal-revenue” mismatch, uncer ta in ty in the lega l framework due 
to the lack o f a single na t iona l e lec t r ic i ty law, and weak contract e n f ~ r c em e n t . ~ ’ 

As a resu l t , the e lec t r ic i ty sector i s hampered b y the d i re f inanc ia l s i tua t ion o f b o t h generation and 
d is t r ibu t ion companies: (i) they have been severely a f fec ted b y the deva lua t ion (most o f the ir debt con- 
tracted at the t ime o f acqu is i t ion i s in fo re ign currency wh i le the ir revenues are in l o c a l currency), (ii) en- 
ergy consumption has no t recovered to i t s pre-energy cr is is levels ( load reduc t ion rema ined after the ra-

the costs, and (v) d i f f i c u l t y to re f inance debt. 

Currently, there i s n o immed ia te threat o f e lec tr ic i ty shortage, g iven the l o w growth, and f o l l ow -

Acco rd ing to a recent survey5', B raz i l 's power sector needs US$82.3 b i l l i o n in investments b y

Labor Productivity 

Desp i te the progress made in the last 20 years, much remains t o be done f o r the country to de- 
velop a human cap i ta l able to sustain economic growth. Improvements in human cap i ta l are key to in- 
crease the p roduc t iv i ty o f the pr iva te sector. T o generate h igher and sustainable economic g row th re- 
qu ires a sustained accumulation o f human cap i ta l over time. As the f isca l constraints r e s t r i c t the coun- 
try ’s pub l ic investment program, the pr iva te sector has a ro le to p lay in p rov id ing add i t iona l resources t o 
meet the education and hea l th sector needs o f the country, in coord ina t ion w i t h the pub l ic sector. 
Education - W h i l e B r a z i l i s considered as an example o f good prac t ice in terms o f education re- 
form, B raz i l ian education levels s t i l l lag behind the region’s levels, and many other countries. Today a 
young B raz i l ian enters the labor market w i t h an average 6 years o f schooling, compared to more than 11 
years in O ECD countries, and 8 years in East Asian countries. 

Investment e f for ts need to be maintained to imp rove access to and the qua l i ty o f jun io r secondary 
education as w e l l as un ive rs i ty education. H ighe r education in B r a z i l s t i l l reaches on ly a sma l l po r t ion o f 
the popu la t ion . Abou t 15 percent o f the relevant age cohort i s en ro l led in h igher education, compared w i t h 
36 percent in Argentina, 32 percent in Ch i le , 30 percent in Uruguay, and 52 percent in the O ECD coun- 
tries. Moreover, students f r om the highest income qu in t i le secure two- th irds o f the places in the coun try ’s 
free, e l i te pub l ic institutions, wh ich tend to be o f higher qua l i ty than p r iva te ins t i tu t ions . Firms c i te the 
education o f the wo rk fo rce as an obstacle to investments. L o w worker p roduc t iv i ty and inequa l i ty b o t h 
f o l l ow f r om B raz i l ’s education system, wh ich remains beh ind other countries despite rap id advances. 

The pr iva te sector has increased i t s par t ic ipa t ion in education, pa r t icu la r ly at the secondary and 
tertiary levels. In Sao Pau l0 state, the pr iva te education sector serves approx ima te ly 15 percent o f a l l stu- 
dents - w i t h near ly 20 percent at the high school leve l . M a n y p r iva te schools operate more than one unit, 
frequently ve r t ica l ly in tegra t ing i n t o other levels o f schooling. Pr iva te distance education companies and 
pr iva te tu to r ing are also developing. Na t ionw ide , the p r iva te sector accounts f o r 65 percent o f to ta l en- 
ro l lmen t in ter t iary education ins t i tu t ions , w i t h a response t o the recent g row th in demand fo r h igher edu- 
ca t ion and the inab i l i ty o f the pub l ic sector to accommodate this demand. 
Health - Desp i te i t s improvements, B raz i l ’s hea l th status lags far beh ind that o f other L a t i n 
Amer ican countries w i t h s im i lar incomes. Moreover , disparities in hea l th care funding and u t i l iza t ion 
among regions and social groups rema in large. M a n y o f the poo r lack regular access to basic services 
wh i le higher-income groups en joy access to costly, comp lex care tha t i s pub l ic ly funded. 

Within that con tex t the p r iva te sector has been increas ing i t s ro le . The p r iva te health sector in 
B raz i l i s now accounting f o r two- th irds o f inpa t ien t fac i l i t ies (many o f wh ich contract w i t h the na t iona l 
hea l th system, Sistema Un ive ra l de Saude - SUS ) and 16 percent o f outpatient fac i l i t ies . In addition, about 
28 percent o f Braz i l ians are covered b y pr iva te med ica l insurance o r group hea l th plans. These p r iva te 
plans became regulated in 1998, f o l l ow i n g the passage o f a federa l l a w and the crea t ion o f a federa l r e g u - 
la to ry agency (Agenc ia Nac iona l de Saude Suplementar). The pos i t ive outcome o f this leg is la t ion has 
been to establish accounting standards and reserve requirements, limit exc lus ion provisions, and imp rove 
e f f ic iency to some extent. However , i t has also in troduced l i m i t s on premiums, wh ich most p r iva te hea l th 
plans consider unrea l is t ic and may be limiting the g row th o f the sector. As a resu l t o f pressure f r o m var i- 
ous groups, this leg is la t ion remains under rev is ion . Fo re ign investment in the hea l th sector has also been 
limited b y the p reva i l ing regu la tory system, in that fo re ign investors cannot h o l d equ i ty in en t i t ies that 
prov ide d irec t patient care.

The Bank has also been e f fec t ive in keep ing an on-go ing po l icy dialogue w i t h the B raz i l ian authorities 
through open and constructive discussions.

Acco rd ing to the O EG repor t and consultations w i t h the p r iva te sector, IFC’ s c l ien ts be l ieve that

IBRD , IFC , M I G A collaboration 

In Braz i l , the co l labora t ion between IBRD, IFC , and MIGA has made impor tan t progress. The 
three ins t i tu t ions have worked together increasing the ir coord ina t ion over time. IBRD’ s assistance in en- 
hanc ing the regu la tory and supervisory environment and the strengthening o f the bank ing sector and fi-

the pa r t ic ipa t ion o f fore ign banks. In infrastructure, a number o f sub sectors where IBRD’s assistance has 
he lped imp rove the regulatory framework have p rov ided opportunities fo r IFC’s and MIGA’ s sequential

Together w i t h FIAS they have wo rked to imp rove B raz i l ’s business env ironmen t and regu la tory frame-

sector continues to be supplemented b y the IFC ’s support fo r pr iva te services providers, helping enhance 
pub l ic -p r iva te complementarities. 

The f o l l ow i n g section outlines the focus o f each WBG ins t i tu t ion . 

IBRD Strategic Focus 

IBRD w i l l focus on using i t s instruments to strengthen the investment c l ima te . Policy-based lend-

and e f f ic iency , private-sector innova t ion , and exports. A l l policy-based lending i s supported b y comple- 
mentary techn ica l assistance loans to build ins t i tu t iona l capacity in the regu la tory agencies, key minis- 
tr ies , and the Cen tra l Bank . Techn ica l assistance w i l l also continue in the energy sector. In selected in- 
stances w i t h h i g h demonstration-effect value (e.g., concession design in roads, mu l t imoda l transport p lan- 
ning), the Bank w i l l continue to make strategic investment loans in to in fras truc ture sectors in accordance 
w i t h the government’s p r io r i t ies as manifested in the PPA. F ina l ly , AAA w i l l focus on using the new ly 
completed Investment C l ima te Survey to construct diagnostics and po l icy options, in add i t ion to studies 
o f l o c a l economic development, in fras truc ture regulation, the dynamic effects o f trade, f inanc ia l sector 
competition, and other areas. 

I F C Strategic Focus 

In tandem w i t h the Bank ’s assistance, I F C w i l l continue to p lay a s trong ro le under the competi- 
tiveness theme, and more generally in support o f pr iva te sector development that cuts across the three key 
dimensions o f this CAS . 
IFC ’s con t inued support to the B raz i l ian pr iva te sector w i l l accompany the 
Bank ’s assistance, pa r t icu la r ly in (i) enhancing the prospects f o r competitiveness and growth, and (ii) im- 
p rov ing soc ia l equ i ty through vo lun tary actions b y the pr iva te sector. I F C w i l l con t inue to focus on the 
choice o f instruments f o r investment activities, w i t h the ob jec t ive o f op t im iz ing r iskhe tu rn p ro f i les . 

The first ob jec t ive wou ld en ta i l supporting: g row th generating firms w i t h a w ide ne two rk o f 
stakeholders, export enhancing ac t iv i t ies inc lud ing in fras truc ture and logistics, and ac t iv i t ies imp rov ing 
access to long- term f inanc ing . T igh te r marke t cond i t ions cou ld continue to requ ire I F C to respond to 
coun ter-cyc l ica l needs o f the p r iva te sector under this ob jec t ive . Depend ing on market cond i t ions , I F C 
might be requ ired to rap id ly adjust i t s shor t- term p r io r i t ies w i t h i n the CAS framework , as was t h e case o f 
the rap id deployment o f trade f inance fac i l i t ies du r ing the last CAS per iod . G iven i t s exposure con-

fo r the g row th and p roduc t iv i ty agenda, w i l l continue to be an area o f focus f o r IFC. 

Unde r the second objective, IFC w i l l support the g row ing momen tum towards soc ia l ly responsi-

A - Cata lyze Investment F lows wh ich Strengthen Braz i l ’s Competitiveness and Generate G r o w t h 
and Emp loymen t 

The B raz i l ian pr iva te sector has faced a series o f d i f f i c u l t external and domestic events that have 
hindered i t s no rma l course o f business, le t alone new long- term activities; but has shown a remarkable 
res i l ience to overcome these d i f f icu l t ies . However, this makesh i f t approach, a l though inev i tab le at the 
time, i s neither sustainable in the l o n g run no r conducive to compe t i t ive gains, i f i t i s no t accompanied b y 
investments fo r the future. 

L o n g te rm f inanc ing t o support investments go ing fo rwa rd has been in c r i t ica l shortage f o r the 
past few years. Desp i te the recent improvements in the market, a large number o f B raz i l ian corporates are 
faced w i t h the d i f f i c u l t y in ra is ing long- term debt w i thou t o f f i c i a l support. Within this context, IFC w i l l 
continue to he lp f inance firms that are impor tan t fo r B raz i l ’s growth, employment, and competitiveness. 
These firms tend to have a w ide ne two rk o f SME vendors/suppliers associated w i t h the ir operations, a 
large employment force, and a s ign i f ican t f isca l con tr ibu t ion . Econom ic and soc ia l impac t on a w ide r base 
wou ld result f r om the demonstration e f fec t o f IFC’s support f o r env ironmen ta l ly and soc ia l ly responsible 
business practices b y these firms, and through the ir bus iness linkages to smaller economic ac t iv i t ies . A

inva r iab ly ma in ta in a large ne two rk o f suppliers/vendors l i n k e d t o the ir day-to-day operations. A com-

firms p lays a c r i t ica l ro le . 

The focus under this category o f IFC ac t iv i ty w i l l be on good sponsors, w i t h strong managerial 
capabilities, whose pro jec ts w i l l , w i t h the ir success, p rov ide a strong demonstration e f fec t f o r po ten t ia l

structures, another i s the f inanc ing o f the ir ra t iona l iza t ion and expansion plans - bo th through d irec t fi- 
nanc ing by IFC and through i ts mob i l iza t ion o f commerc ia l finance. Ano ther facet i s the strengthening o f 
the ir corporate governance practices, to eventually enable them to access l o n g te rm f inanc ing o n the ir 
own . IFC w i l l also seek to support expor t companies, some inves t ing in to other emerging marke t econo- 
mies such as Ma rcopo lo (see b o x 2), and companies in agribusiness and manufacturing, as w e l l as other 
expor t ing sectors.

D - Human Capital Development - Health and Education - Broaden Access 
IFC w i l l continue i t s e f for ts t o expand i t s hea l th and education investments in B raz i l , a l though i t 
w i l l proceed cau t ious ly in the near term, depending on re fo rm progress in bo th sectors. B o t h the p r iva te 
hea l th and education sectors have suffered f r om the impac t o f the coun try ’s recent economic tu rmo i l ; the 
cr is is in the pr iva te hea l th sector has also been compounded b y recent regu la tory changes that have put 
pressure on the pr iva te sector. 

G iven these circumstances, IFC w i l l be h i g h l y selective in seeking investments in the soc ia l sec- 
tors. Curren t po r t fo l io pro jec ts inc lude Labo ra to r io F leu ry (a lead ing p rov ide r o f med ica l diagnostic ser-

Salutia, an I T services company wo rk ing in the hea l th sector, and Escola24Horas.com, an educa t iona l 
po r ta l de l ive r ing on- l ine tu to r ing services. 

In the short-to-medium term, IFC w i l l focus o n f i rs t - t ie r hospitals, ambu la tory care fac i l i t ies , and 
diagnostic centers. IFC w i l l also strengthen i t s coord ina t ion w i t h the W o r l d Bank in exp lo r ing inves tmen t 
opportunities related to pub l ic-pr iva te partnerships in the hea l th sector. In the longer term, IFC may l o o k 
at second-tier hospitals and hosp i ta l management companies, as w e l l as companies p r o v i d i n g non -c l in ica l 
support services to prov iders and back -o f f ice services t o the insurance indus try . 

L ikew ise , in the education sector, IFC w i l l focus on top-tier un ivers i t ies in the short term. In the

in number, do no t always meet IFC’s f inanc ia l and governance standards. In add i t ion , IFC w i l l con t inue 
to study and explore possible investments in the student loan market.

ANNEX 6: CAS Consultations 

In agreement w i t h the B raz i l ian Government, the B r a z i l coun try team under took consultations f o r 
the preparation o f this CAS w i t h members o f Congress, the Governors and State Secretaries o f numerous 
states, members o f the Counc i l o f Soc ia l and Econom ic Deve lopmen t (CDES), academics, c i v i l society 
representatives, members o f the in terna t iona l commun i ty (embassies and other mu l t i la te ra l a id organiza- 
tions), members o f you th organizations, un ion representatives, and leaders o f the Ca tho l ic Church 
(CNBB) . These meetings took place f r om June to October 2003. The consultations inc luded several 
dozen meetings w i t h several hundred ind iv idua ls . In addition, during the prepara t ion o f the Pr iva te Sector 
Strategy o f the CAS, I F C and Bank s ta f f consulted w i t h representatives o f the p r iva te sector, the f inanc ia l 
sector, and indus t r ia l associations. 

A key conc lus ion o f these consultations, wh ich were w ide ly appreciated, was that an ongo ing par- 
t ic ipa to ry process o f consultation, including the eventual g row th o f a learn ing f o r um o r development net- 
work , was no t on ly in demand w i t h i n c i v i l society but wou ld also strengthen the p rog ram and i t s respon- 
siveness to B raz i l ’s needs. The Bank i s building this ongo ing consultative process in coord ina t ion w i t h 
CDES and w i t h a number o f interested in terna t iona l and domestic partners, inc lud ing you th movements, 
and expects to take advantage o f GDLN and web-based networks. 

The commona l i t ies o f messages as w e l l as systematic differences are s tr ik ing . On the goals fo r 
B raz i l ’s development, there was a great deal o f convergence and endorsement o f the d irec t ions o f the 
CAS. The differences emerge more when i t comes to the means and actions requ i red to achieve B raz i l ’s 
development goals. Some o f the highlights o f discussion w i t h spec i f ic groups: 

C i v i l society n e tw o r k s and NGO representat ives fe l t that the consu l ta t ive process w o u l d bene- 
fit f r om a j o i n t discussion w i t h the government and the Bank pe r iod ica l ly . CSO and NGO groups seek 
greater invo lvemen t in the de f in i t ion o f economic po l icy , where decisions on B raz i l ’s ro le in wha t i s con- 
sidered the new g loba l w o r l d order are being decided. B raz i l ian c i v i l society i s w e l l prepared and w e l l 
organized and can p lay a key role, moreover, as a “watchdog” in terms o f p o l i c y and p rog ram imp lemen- 
tation, p rov ided i t has access t o t ime ly and transparent in fo rma t ion . The Bank c o u l d also p lay an impo r - 
tant ro le in he lp ing to support mainstreaming o f social, env ironmen ta l and cu l tu ra l concerns i n t o the gov- 
ernment’s development plans and programs. These plans and programs shou ld take more exp l ic i t ly i n t o 
account the social, cu l tu ra l and env ironmen ta l costs o f productive, in fras truc ture and other ac t iv i t ies . 

The Coun c i l o f Soc ia l and Econom ic Deve lopmen t , a group o f counc i l members f r om a l l seg- 
ments o f B raz i l ian leadership, cha ired b y the Minister o f the Counc i l o f Econom ic and Soc ia l Deve lop- 
ment, expressed appreciation f o r the Bank’s desire to incorpora te the op in ions o f c i v i l society and the 
pub l ic sector in to the CAS . Comments included: (i) the need f o r investments in un ive rs i ty education to 
stimulate innova t ion ; (ii) the impor tance o f cu l ture to the effectiveness o f a coun try ’s development mode l 
and resu l ts ; (iii) the desire to h o l d consultations on an on-go ing basis between the pub l ic and p r iva te sec- 
tors and the Bank; and ( iv) the need fo r continued eva lua t ion o f public programs. A fo l low -up consulta- 
t i o n discussed cu l ture and violence, social par t ic ipa t ion , and the mon i to r ing and eva lua t ion o f programs in 
a results context. In response t o the request fo r con t inued consultation, the B a n k w i l l be pa r t ic ipa t ing in 
discussions w i t h the Counc i l in each o f B raz i l ’s f i v e macro-regions during 2003-04 to con t inue this net-

that the new Government was hav ing success w i t h macroeconomic po l ic ies f o r stabilization, but that mi-

Rather than crea t ing new loca l programs, i t was men t ioned that i t wou ld be more e f fec t ive to raise suc-

(CSOs and NGOs, CDES) 
Cu l ture i s a basis fo r employment and income generation (e.g., h is tor ic and eco-tourism, marke t ing o f

Further investments in education cou ld inc lude cu l tu ra l elements, re in fo rc ing mo ra l and e th ica l values

Wha t matters i s no t on ly employment and income, but also education, culture, and leisure. These are 
fundamental aspects o f social we l l-be ing . (CDES) 
E l im ina t ing pover ty requires a mu l t i-sec tora l approach that leverages the d i f fe ren t comparative ad-

Conso l ida t ing income and employment programs cou ld be an impor tan t step, especially in the agri- 
cu l tura l / food sector. Support to the agr icu l turaV food sector cou ld help address tw o challenges simul-

Imp rov ing the capacity o f women, through education and training, c o u l d become an impor tan t sub-

greater share o f their resources inves t ing in ch i ldren and on household necessities. Inco rpo ra t ing fe-

(CDES) 
I Inves t ing in the preven t ion and reduc t ion o f c r ime and violence mer i ts greater attention. 
C r ime and violence are crosscu t t ing issues. Reduc ing c r ime and v io lence requires preven t ion as w e l l 
as enforcement. I t i s no t a matter o f “combating” cr ime and violence, but instead o f inves t ing in pro-

C r ime and violence are among the greatest challenges con f ron t ing the na t ion ’s youth. Commun i ty 
groups, especially in poorer communities, struggle to keep you th away f r o m organized crime, p ros t i - 
tution, and drugs. (You th) 
L ow e r (or lack of) g row th cou ld resu l t in h igher crime, and general unrest and popu lar oppos i t ion to

Reduc ing cr ime and v io lence requires a short and long - te rm v is ion . In the short run, i t i s necessary to 
imp lemen t programs and re forms that create j o b opportunities fo r you th and pull you th away f r o m 
cr ime and violence. In the long-term, measures cou ld focus on early ch i ldhood in terven t ions and cu l - 
tu ra l and after-school ac t iv i t ies to keep kids away f r om the perverse in f luence o f c r ime and drugs. 
(Youth, CDES) 
C r ime reduc t ion also requires jud ic ia ry re forms that re l ieve bottlenecks in the c r im ina l jus t ice system.

CHALLENGES 

T w o main challenges fo r the Northeast a re (1) the permanence o f deep poverty , and (2) social and 
economic inequa l i ty bo th w i th in the Northeast and compared w i th the rest o f B raz i l . 

T h e Northeast i s home to 28 percent o f the B raz i l ian popu lat ion and over h a l f o f B raz i l ’s 
poor. In the Northeast, rough ly h a l f o f the popu la t ion i s poor, wh i le in B r a z i l overall, one - f i f th l i v e in 
pover ty . The r u r a l Northeast i s the largest source o f pover ty in the country, w i t h nearly 12 m i l l i o n peop le 
l iv ing be low a pove r ty l i n e . Through continuous rura l-urban m igra t ion , ru ra l pover ty reinforces the num- 
ber o f poor in u rban areas, inc lud ing sma l l and med ium cities, the ma jo r me tropo l i tan regions, and c i t ies 
outside the Northeast, l i k e S i io Paulo, R i o de Janeiro, and B ras i l ia . 

W h e n compared to other regions, a l l social ind icators a re less favorab le in the Northeast. 
On average, pe r cap i ta income in the Northeast i s bare ly h a l f o f B raz i l ’s . While the average B raz i l ian 
worker has 6.3 years o f schooling, the average worker in the Northeast has on ly 4.5 years o f schooling. 
In fh t mo r ta l i ty rates in the Northeast are over 53 deaths per thousand l i v e births, compared w i t h 35 f o r 
B raz i l . W h i l e 78 percent o f Braz i l ians have access to tap water, on ly 66 percent o f those in Northeast 
have s im i la r access. 

In t ra - reg iona l inequa l ity i s an even mo re serious challenge. Within the Northeast, there i s 
great var ia t ion among states, among cities o f different sizes, and between r u r a l and urban areas. Soc ia l 
in tra-reg iona l inequa l i t ies a re high. Ind ica tors o f education, health, and sanitation are inva r iab ly worse in 
ru ra l as compared to urban areas and in sma l l as compared t o large cities. 

One o f the most s t r ik ing indicators o f poverty and inequa l ity in the Northeast i s re la ted to 
the share o f the labo r force wo rk ing in agr icu lture . Ag r icu l tu re accounts f o r on ly 9 percent o f reg iona l 
GDP but employs 36 percent o f the work force . The large number o f l o w p roduc t iv i ty ru ra l workers and 
sma l l farmers con tr ibu te greatly to the pover ty count in the reg ion and in B r a z i l overa l l . They usua l ly l i v e 
in ru ra l areas o r in sma l l c i t ies whose economic base i s roo ted in rain-fed, l o w p roduc t iv i ty and r isky ag- 
r icu l tu ra l cu l t iva t ion . M o s t o f the income in such c i t ies originates f r om federa l and state government 
transfers and f r o m pension programs fo r o lder ru ra l workers. 

POL ICY RESULTS AND LESSONS 

Poverty and inequa l ity have been persistent challenges in the Northeast . This drough t prone 
reg ion first ra ised the a t ten t ion o f po l icy makers during serious droughts in the 19* century. During the 
las t 5 0 years, the Northeast has been a labora tory f o r a b road range o f experiences on reg iona l develop- 
ment po l ic ies that have insp i red the creation o f new ins t i tu t ions , development programs, in fras truc ture , 
and incentives f o r the p r iva te sector. 

The B a n k has been associated w i t h these experiences since the 1970s, when i t first opened an 
o f f ice in Rec i fe and started suppor t ing the Federa l Government’s in tegra ted r u r a l development strategy. 
Since then, the Bank has been wo rk ing con t inuous ly in the Northeast, suppor t ing ru ra l development p ro - 
jects, commun i ty d r iven projects, irr iga t ion , u rban development, infrastructure, water resource manage- 
ment, m icro-cred i t , education, health, and sanitation, plus a number o f impo r tan t non- lend ing ac t iv i t ies .

T h e resu lts o f Gove rnmen t policies a n d W o r l d B a n k suppo r t h a v e been l a rg e l y positive. The 

reg ion i s n o w less vulnerable to drought, and the economy has sh i f ted increas ing ly to less vulnerable ac- 
t iv i t ies . Ag r icu l tu re accounted fo r 30 percent o f reg iona l GDP in the 1960s and accounts f o r less than 10 
percent today - although i t s t i l l remains a source o f vu lne rab i l i ty in the region. M o r e than 30,000 ru ra l 
commun i t ies have been d irec t ly supported. There has been substantial progress on infrastructure, w i t h 
new ins ta l la t ions f o r transportation, communications, energy, water resources, sanitation, manufacturing, 
med ica l services, and tourism. GDP has increased and soc ia l indicators have improved . During droughts, 
r e l i e f programs have been able to address the needs o f vulnerable populations. N e w i r r iga t ion schemes 
have f i n a l l y p roven successful, and the manu fac tur ing sector i s able to compete on a na t iona l leve l . Hu- 
man cap i ta l has increased, and new social cap i ta l has been formed. O n the env ironmen ta l side, there have 
been ins t i tu t iona l improvements, but the pressure on the na tura l resources has been increasing. M a j o r 
progress has been made, bu t ma jor challenges s t i l l exist. 

Successful pro jects have invo lved s imp l i f ied ins t i tu t iona l a r rangemen ts , b r o a d stakeho lder 
p a r t i c ip a t ion , and have been p r e p a r e d e a r l y d u r i n g gove rnmen t adm in istrat ions . These lessons are 

impor tan t t o gu ide new po l ic ies fo r the region. Some lessons have to do w i t h ownership. F o r instance, the 
early in tegra ted ru ra l development projects were f inanced b y the federal government, coordinated b y 
Sudene and imp lemen ted b y state pro jec t un i ts that wou ld f o l l ow the guidance o f Sudene and the Bank, 
o f ten bypassing state administrations. The resu l t was lack o f state ownership and lack o f p o l i t i c a l support. 
Projects w i t h comp lex ins t i tu t iona l arrangements did no t func t ion we l l . 

On th e o the r hand, pro jects wh e r e th e state gove rnmen t i s the b o r r ow e r and p ro jec ts that 
start at the beg inn ing o f state adm in is t ra t ions have a b e t t e r chance o f success. I f p ro jec t prepara t ion 

takes too long , the elected decision maker may lose interest. And projects w i t h strong stakeholder pa r t ic i - 
pa t ion are more l i k e l y to be successful because they have a larger base o f constituency support. 

Expe r ience also revea ls a need t o im p r o v e the focus and in t eg r a t ion o f pro jects . W i t h regard 

to integration, i n i t i a l strategies fa i led due to ins t i tu t iona l comp lex i ty . The Bank i s n ow in the process o f 
dev is ing new approaches to imp rove inter-sectoral and in te r - ins t i tu t iona l in tegra t ion wh i le keep ing own - 
ership and accoun tab i l i ty we l l-de f ined . An ART j o i n t l y organized b y the Bank and the Government o f 
CearA showed that there i s ample space to imp rove results o n the ground w i t h better in teg ra t ion and foca l - 
iza t ion . 

With scarce resources a n d m a n y p r io r i t ies , th e r e i s a need f o r selectivity. 

STRATEGIC APPROACH 

T h e strategy f o r the No r theas t visualizes a m o r e susta inab le fu tu re , w i t h a m o r e equ i tab le society, a 
m o r e compe t i t ive economy, w i thou t pove r ty , and w i t h less inequa l i ty . A more sustainable Nor theas t 

encompasses sustainability on an environmental, social, economic and p o l i t i c a l leve l . 

Soc ia l Sus ta inab i l i ty 

T h e p r i n c i p a l p r i o r i t y i s t o invest in people, w i t h a heavy focus o n educat ion . F r o m a long - 

te rm perspective, education i s the ma in necessary - though n o t s u f f i c i e n t - fac tor to induce development. 
There are a few nations w i t h high levels o f education tha t s t i l l have high pover ty rates, b u t there are n o 
nations that have l o w levels o f education and l o w pover ty rates. A lso , in the Northeast, lack o f education 
i s c lose ly associated w i t h pover ty and inequa l i ty . Educa t ion takes center stage in the strategy f o r the 
Northeast and includes early ch i ldhood education, un iversa l p rov is ion o f h igh-qua l i ty p r ima ry and secon- 
dary education, and capacity building at var ious levels.

Un ive rsa l access t o hea l th services, water and sanitation, p u b l i c safety, justice, culture, and 
social safety n e t s a re also p r i o r i t y policies f o r social sustainability. In the short run, i t i s very impo r - 
tant to strengthen social safety nets in order to protect the poo r f r om various types o f crises, especially 
droughts. 

Env i ronmen ta l Sustainabilitv 

Env i ronmen ta l sustainability should be a p i l l a r o f t h e new strategy. T rad i t iona l ly , develop- 
ment plans in the Northeast have neglected the environment. P r io r i t ies are: land use planning, na tura l 
resources and env ironmen ta l management, conservation o f b iod ivers i ty , programs to prevent desertifica- 
t i o n in the semi-arid region, and the ins t i tu t iona l development and strengthening o f government agencies 
responsible f o r managing na tura l assets. 

W a t e r resource management i s key t o induce sustainable use o f th is scarcest resource in t h e 
sem i -a r id region. 

Land-use policies, b o t h r u r a l a n d urban, are essential to avo id na tu ra l resource degradation 
and to fac i l i ta te other impor tan t po l ic ies such as land re fo rm and urban development. 

Economic Sustainabilitv 

Economic g r ow t h w i t h qua l i ty i s t h e m a i n force t o combat pove r ty . In the Northeast, eco- 
nom ic g row th i s heav i ly associated w i t h economic performance in the rest o f the coun try . I t i s impor tan t 
that B r a z i l grow in order f o r the Northeast to grow. 

However, t h e r e i s space and t h e r e a re instruments t o induce h ighe r rates o f g r ow t h and es- 
pecially t o imp rove t h e qua l i ty o f g r ow t h a n d create m o r e j o b oppo r tun i t ies w i t h i n a sustainable 
f ramewo rk . 
Instead o f focus ing on “what to promote”, po l ic ies shou ld emphasize the “how” and the 
“what for” . F o r instance, h o w to manage government incentives - at federal, state, and mun ic ipa l levels - 
in a way that decisions b y entrepreneurs t o choose ac t iv i t ies fo r wh ich the reg ion has a comparative ad- 
vantage and choose technologies to max im ize j o b crea t ion wh i le rema in ing compe t i t ive . Know ledge 
management, and know ledge f o r development, must be considered as key components o f the Northeast 
Strategy. 

T h e r e a re some sectors t h a t have already p roven po ten t ia l ly advantageous. Sma l l and me- 
dium enterprises and tou r ism are examples. As fo r agriculture, the po ten t ia l f o r i r r iga t ion i s l im i ted : on ly 
3 percent o f the Northeast can be irrigated, taking in to account so i l and water ava i lab i l i ty . This i s ap- 
prox ima te ly one m i l l i o n hectares, and i f managed proper ly , can have a large impac t o n reg iona l develop- 
ment. The rema in ing 97 percent can focus on ra in- fed cu l t iva t ion , forestry, and b iod ive rs i ty conservation, 
among other activities. This has p ro found imp l ica t ions o n the future o f development in the Northeast, o n 
popu la t ion d is tr ibu t ion , and on land use in the semi-arid region.

in tegra t ion o f d i f fe ren t actions. Fo r instance, the Bank already finances federa l and state water projects. In 
the f ie ld , the Bank can he lp bo th federal and state agencies t o exp lore the complementarities o f the ir p ro -

cross-cutting components aimed at imp rov ing the ove ra l l capacity o f the state to manage i t s resources, to

ANNEX 8: A S t ra teg ic C o n t r i b u t i o n t o a M o r e Sus ta inab le A m a z o n 

T h e Amazon i s large, sparsely popu lated and urban ized . The “Lega l Amazon” covers some 
60 percent (5.1 m i l l i o n km.2) o f the B raz i l ian terr i tory , w i t h some 2 1 m i l l i o n inhab i tan ts (in 2000) o r 
about 12 percent o f Braz i l ’s population. A lmos t 7 0 percent l i v e in c i t ies and towns as de f ined b y IBGE 
( inc lud ing very sma l l mun ic ipa l seats). The ru ra l popu la t ion declined in the 1990s w i t h m ig ra t ion to the 
urban centers. M i g r a t i o n to the reg ion as a whole has subsided, but some in f lux , m a i n l y f r om poo r states 
o f the Northeast and ma in ly in to Pa r i , Amap f i and Roraima, continues. The indigenous popu la t ion (about 
350,000) appears to be recovering. 

T h e reg ion provides biodiversity and env ironmenta l services o f na t iona l and global interest . 
The Amazon i s the largest r a i n forest b iome in the wor ld , con ta in ing b y far the largest po r t ion o f rema in- 
ing r a i n forest and up to one fifth o f the wor ld ’s freshwater. O f the o r ig ina l forest cover, some 640,000 
km.2, o r 17 percent, have been cleared b y 2002, a l though at least a third o f this area i s g row ing back. I t s 
g loba l value i s seen bo th in i t s extremely r i c h b iod ive rs i ty (50,000 k n ow n species o f plants, 3000 o f fish, 
2000 o f birds) and i t s possible impac t o n the g loba l c l ima te i f i t were t o disappear. De fores ta t ion aver- 
aged about 21,000 km.2 per year in the eighties ( f r om 1978 - 88, representing a loss o f about 0.5 percent 
o f the forest stock per year), and dec l ined somewhat in the 1990s to 16,000 km.2 pe r year. The latest es- 
t ima te ( fo r 2002) was 25,000 km.2 o r 56 percent above the annual average f o r the 1990s. 

CHALLENGES 

T h e Amazon i s a diverse reg ion tha t faces a n equally complex set o f challenges. Am o n g 
these, the most impor tan t are: a) a lack o f consensus about the rules o f the game f o r development; b) a set 
o f development trade-offs and uncertainties; c) the sheer phys ica l size o f the region, w i t h special re le- 
vance f o r soc ia l services (health and education), in fras truc ture and transportation; d) unclear proper ty 
rights and ensuing land use con f l ic ts ; e) unmanaged expansion o f cattle ranch ing and agriculture; f) rap id 
urban iza t ion and poor qua l i ty -o f - l i fe in cities; g ) an i n a b i l i t y to con t ro l deforestation and fires; h) a range 
o f serious human hea l th challenges; i) the ro le o f indigenous people in economic development and env i- 
ronmen ta l management; j) loca l ized development questions, especially in the energy and mining sectors; 
and k) the overarching challenge o f l o w ins t i tu t iona l capacity and poo r governance. 

T h e N o r t h i s Braz i l ’s second poorest region. 43 percent o f the reg ion ’s popu la t ion l ives in 
pover ty (this p ropo r t ion i s on ly s l igh t ly lowe r than in the Northeast) and the reg ion accounts f o r 5 percent 
o f B raz i l ’s poor . Per capita income in the Amazon was 57 percent o f the na t iona l f igu re f o r the year 
2000. L i t t l e i s known about the geographic d is t r ibu t ion o f the poo r w i t h i n states, a l though i t i s clear that 
the bulk o f them l i v e in urban areas. M o r e studies are needed to pe rm i t adequate targe t ing o f services. 

Un l ike the Northeast, hunger i s no t the main prob lem . The ma in pover ty challenge, par t icu- 
la r ly in the ru ra l areas, i s access to especially health, education and other services, and economic oppor tu- 
n i t ies . In terms o f education, over h a l f the reg ion ’s popu la t ion has less than fou r years o f fo rma l school- 
ing and the i l l i te racy rate o f the adult popu la t ion (above 15 years o f age) i s 19 percent, compared w i t h a 
na t iona l average o f 13.6 percent. In terms o f househo ld services, 69 percent o f residences in the reg ion 
have piped water, 9 percent are connected to a sewerage system and 24 percent have so l id waste collec-. 
t ion . Ex treme dispersion o f the ru ra l popu la t ion in the fores t areas makes p rov is ion o f such services d i f f i- 
cu l t and costly; the ru ra l poo r spend considerable t ime and money t rave l ing to centers w i t h hea l th and

education fac i l i t ies . Geographic iso la t ion also creates economic prob lems in terms o f access to markets, 
high transpor ta t ion costs and ava i lab i l i ty o f investment capital. 

POL ICY RESULTS AND LESSONS 

T h e Bank has t rave led a b um p y r o a d t o reg iona l deve lopment . W h i l e the Bank does no t have 
a strategy o f i t s own , i t has been active in the reg ion since the ear ly 1980s through loan- funded pro jec ts 
(reg iona l development, health, mining, agriculture, and env ironmen ta l management), since 1992 as t r u s - 
tee o f the P i l o t P rog ram to Conserve the B raz i l ian Ra in Forest (RFPP) and, more recently, as implement- 
ing agency o f the G loba l Env ironmen t Fac i l i ty (GEF). The experience in the 1980s was no t a happy one, 
hav ing a serious impac t on the Bank ’s reputation in a decade o f rap id ly g row ing env ironmen ta l concerns. 
The pos i t ive experience w i t h W P , however, has no t on ly g iven the Bank a new confidence that i t i s 
possible and no t ove r ly r isky to wo rk in the Amazon region, but has also con tr ibu ted to a d i f fe ren t image 
o f the Bank and t o expectations on the par t o f the donor commun i ty that i t w i l l engage more ac t ive ly as 
the Bank (not on ly as trustee) in the region. 

This j o u r n e y has y ie lded va luab le lessons. The Bank has learned the f o l l ow i n g substantive les- 
sons about wo rk ing e f fec t ive ly in the Amazon: 

J Recognize reg iona l i n t e r e s t s and trade-offs; 

J Create o r strengthen ins t i tu t ions but don’t make them dependent on Bank assistance; and 

J M i n im i z e the cost to B r a z i l o f conservation o f nature fo r g loba l benefits. 

In addition, Bank experience has re in forced lessons learned elsewhere such as the value o f a) 
ma in ta in ing a pover ty and par t ic ipa tory focus to i t s interventions; b) suppor t ing and pro tec t ing ethnic and 
cu l tu ra l d ivers i ty ; and creating a capacity to mon i tor , learn, evaluate, disseminate lessons and scale-up 
successes. Procedurally, the Bank has learned that i t i s impor tan t to : a) iden t i fy and w o r k w i t h key actors; 
b) make allowance f o r add i t iona l investments in t ime and techn ica l assistance tha t are necessary f o r wo rk - 
ing in the Amazon; c) be selective, encouraging others to do wha t i t cannot and taking care about h ow to 
phase interventions that invo lve b o t h environmental conservation and development; and d) keep funding 
and techn ica l assistance simple. 

STRATEGIC APPROACH 

Goa l , objectives a n d p r inc ip les f o r w o r k i n g in the Amazon . The ove ra l l goa l o f Bank support 
should be to promo te sustainable development in the Amazon reg ion . This wou ld consist o f the f o l l ow i n g 
objectives: a) reduc ing urban and ru ra l pover ty (equity p i l lar) ; b) crea t ing enab l ing conditions f o r eco-

D r aw i n g on these options, and guided b y the objectives, pr inc ip les and lessons f r o m experience

three l ines o f ac t ion : 

1. Poverty Alleviation (a more equitable Brazil) - pursue po l ic ies and investments in the Amazon to 
increase income and improve l i v i n g conditions fo r the urban and ru ra l poor, especially in the conso l i- 
dated f ron t ie r (RondBnia, M a t o Grosso and Parfi), the poorest mun ic ipa l i t ies o f ind iv idua l states and 
the poorest neighborhoods o f BelCm and Manaus. 

2 . Conditions for Economic Management (a more productive Brazil) - enhance ins t i tu t iona l capac- 
i t y (public, p r iva te and c i v i l society), imp rove land use management and support env ironmen ta l ly- 
sound economic ac t iv i ty and infrastructure, especially in the poorest areas o f the Amazon and in areas 
o f serious o r anticipated land use con f l ic t . 

3. Environmental Conservation (a more sustainable Brazil) - increase support fo r ex is t ing federal 
and state po l ic ies and programs that seek to sustainably manage na tura l resources, conserve b iod ive r - 
s i ty and pro tec t environmental services in the Amazon, w i t h a geographic focus on areas character- 
ized b y c r i t ica l b iod ivers i ty value, c ruc ia l env ironmen ta l services and/or cu l tu ra l heritage. 

Support in these areas wou ld be through a range o f instruments: loans (federal, state, mun ic ipa l) ; sector 
work ; po l icy analysis; know ledge management; and p romo t ion o f partnerships. 

THE BANK AND THE STRATEGY 

Principled selectivity should guide the phasing o f the Bank’s w o r k in the region. The phas- 
ing o f this wo rk shou ld be guided b y a number o f pr inc ip les . First, the Bank shou ld start sma l l and learn 
f r o m i t s i n i t i a l experiences. Fo r example, one o f the first operations in the new CAS pe r iod w i l l be the 
Amap i i Sustainable Communities pro jec t wh ich i s a modest loan in a sma l l state w i t h re la t ive ly f ew con- 
f l ic ts . I t also has a s ign i f ican t investment in mon i to r ing and eva lua t ion in order t o learn lessons. Second, 
the Bank shou ld be geographically selective as opposed to t r y i n g to wo rk throughout the reg ion in a com- 
prehensive way. Each ac t ion area includes suggestions about h ow t o achieve this spa t ia l se lec t iv i ty . This 
also imp l ies f inanc ing select pieces o f a federal Amazbnia Sustentdvel program, perhaps through appro- 
p r ia te state and mun ic ipa l in i t ia t ives . F ina l ly , rea l i ty dictates that the timing o f our in terven t ions w i l l be 
d r iven to a cer ta in extent b y the demand fo r Bank invo lvemen t b y various clients. This demand i t s e l f w i l l 
be cond i t ioned b y the client’s po l i t ica l w i l l , techn ica l capacity, the electoral cycle, and cred i twor th iness 
considerations. The la t ter can be seen as an impor tan t advantage f o r the Bank to pursue more lend ing in 
the Amazon as they a re among the more c red i two r thy B raz i l ian states. 

Timely opportunities exist for the Bank to make a contribution. The ma jo r reg iona l oppor tu- 
n i t y fo r guiding Bank con tr ibu t ions wou ld be the Amazbn ia Sustentdvel program, w i t h i t s l inkages to the 
PPA. W h i l e i t i s un l ike ly that the Bank wou ld f inance a l l aspects o f such a program, i t cou ld p rov ide fi- 
nancial, techn ica l and ana ly t ica l support fo r a federa l in i t ia t ive as w e l l as re la ted state and mun ic ipa l 
components. C r i te r ia cou ld be established to he lp the Bank p r io r i t ize where support wou ld be d irec ted 
accord ing to the objectives o f conservation, pove r ty a l lev ia t ion and sustainable development. A second 
oppor tun i ty w i l l be h ow the Bank responds to g row ing c l ien t demand fo r assistance in the Amazon . A 
third oppor tun i ty wou ld be fo r Bank assistance to the Government in i t s process o f re fo rm ing key f inan - 
c i a l and development mechanisms, i.e. ADA, BASA, FINAM, as w e l l as BNDES and the Ca ixa 
EconBmica Federal ( fo r the ir invo lvemen t in the Amazon). F ina l ly , the Bank c a n p lay a suppor t ing ro le 

A M o r e Equitable, Sustainable, and Compe t i t ive B r a z i l - Coun try Assistance Strategy 2003-2007

through i t s invo lvemen t in the second phase o f the RFPP. In th is regard, some suggestions are o f fered 
be low to assist w i t h fo rmu la t ion o f the second phase. 

Within the donor community, the Bank should exercise leadership through a region-wide 
approach. Ins t i tu t iona l ly , an oppor tun i ty exists f o r the Bank to exercise leadership w i t h i n the donor 
commun i ty . Based on the pos i t ive experience o f donor coord ina t ion w i t h i n the RFPP, a number o f do- 
nors have expressed interest in pursuing a sector-wide approach to aid, though the sector de f in i t ion re- 
mains unclear. A more sensible and comprehensive approach wou ld be to pursue a reg ion -w ide approach 
to a id coord ina t ion in the Amazon. The Bank cou ld take the lead in organ iz ing donors around such a 
concept and cou ld serve as the secretariat to a reg iona l ly- focused a id group, i n c l u d i n g prepara t ion o f the 
group’s assistance strategy. 

The second phase o f the RFPP could complement Bank support. The second phase o f the 
RFPP cou ld be formu la ted in three blocks: 

Think Tank. In order t o support a reg ion-w ide approach, the ma in thrust o f the RFPP in i t s sec- 
ond phase should be to serve as a resource base that wou ld : a) observe and assess trends in the 
Amazon (e.g. deforestation, cattle ranching, soybean production, urban iza t ion , pover ty , etc.); b) 
disseminate successful lessons and models f r om the P i l o t Program projects; c) catalyze the ma in- 
streaming o f pos i t ive experiences; d) analyze and suggest po l ic ies f o r sustainable development in 
the Amazon; e) build capacity that wou ld support these ac t iv i t ies in c i v i l society organizations 
and the pr iva te sector; and f ) ma in ta in a clearinghouse o f wo rk being done throughou t the region. 
This cou ld be done through the creation o f a think tank capacity that w o u l d p e r f o rm these func- 
tions. I t cou ld be a ne two rk o f ins t i tu t ions o r even a new ra in fores t p o l i c y ins t i tu te . In the latter 
case, an institute wou ld be an en t i ty independent o f the B raz i l ian Governmen t but that w o u l d con- 
tr ibu te to enr ich ing Government po l ic ies and programs in the region, such as the ro le that P E A 
plays f o r the M i n i s t r y o f Planning. In e i the r case, i t should full i n v o l v e ex is t ing in i t ia t ives fo r 
learn ing lessons, conduc t ing research and prepar ing po l icy analysis f o r the Amazon, either as 
partners in a ne two rk o r as board members o f an ins t i tu te . 

High-Priority Piloting. The RFPP shou ld continue to p i l o t new experiences but in a l im i t e d and 
focused manner. Spec i f ica l ly , the P rog ram stakeholders at their mos t recent mee t ing (CuiabA, 
June 2001) iden t i f ied a number o f spec i f ic know ledge gaps where the P rog ram cou ld support pi- 
l o t i n g work : low- impac t ca t t le ranch ing and pasture management; land tenure, titling, manage- 
ment, and con f l ic t resolution; ru ra l extension fo r sustainable agr icu l ture and produc t ion ; and sus - 
tainable land settlement. The RFPP’s In terna t iona l Adv iso ry Group, in i t s Ju ly 2003 meeting, 
iden t i f ied other p rom is ing areas such as support to small-scale producers, imp lemen ta t ion o f an 
e f fec t ive forest concession system, payment f o r env ironmen ta l services, management o f genetic 
resources, and preservation and app l ica t ion o f trad i t iona l know ledge . O ther areas inc lude the in- 
tens i f ica t ion o f agr icu l ture in degraded forest areas and the challenges o f na tu ra l resource man- 
agement on indigenous lands. The curren t project-based approach has high transaction costs and 
should be avoided in a second phase, either b y supporting and s t imu la t ing re levan t w o r k b y others 
or through donor-supported pro jec ts tha t address these know ledge gaps v i a b i la te ra l arrange- 
ments. The think tank capacity cou ld be used to iden t i fy other know ledge needs and or ien t donor 
and other resources. 

Continued Learning and Scaling Up. The third b lock o f ac t iv i ty f o r the P rog ram in i t s new 
phase wou ld be to carry ex is t ing pro jec ts t o completion, lea rn ing and documen t ing lessons a long 
the way fo r mainstreaming. A number o f pro jec ts w i l l carry on th rough 2006/2007 such as the 
Na tu ra l Resources Po l icy Pro jec t and the Science II pro jec t . There w i l l be a con t inu ing need t o

supervise the imp lemen ta t ion o f these projects and evaluate them fo r rep l icab le lessons, as w e l l as 
p romo t ing the scaling up o f successful experiences.
