PERU COUNTRY ASSISTANCE STRATEGY

FISCAL YEARS 2003-06

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

i. 
This Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) supports the new government's program of policy and
institutional reforms necessary to renew growth and reduce poverty. While investments in key sectors are
continued from the previous CAS, greater attention is to be given to reform programs supported through a
combination of adaptable program loans and programmatic adjustment lending. This change reflects the
ambitious agenda of governance, 
institutional reforms and poverty reduction articulated by the
government. This CAS also strengthens the emphasis of the previous CAS on working in partnerships
with the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB) and the Andean Development Corporation (CAF) on
reform initiatives in competitiveness, infrastructure and public sector management and decentralization,
and with bilaterals and NGOs on reforms in the social sectors, citizen participation and transparency.
Developing the complementarity of the World Bank Group (WBG) program has been a key element of
the CAS process given the active programs of many other multi-lateral and bi-lateral development
assistance agencies in Peru.

Current Country Context and the Government's Program

ii. 
In 2000-2001 Peru experienced a year-long process of political transition, culminating with the
election of Alejandro Toledo to the presidency in July 2001. The new administration took power on the
heels of a recession, and has articulated a policy of fiscal responsibility combined with targeted economic
stimulus and social programs to address the impact of the economic downturn on the poor. Due in part to
the four year recession, poverty levels have increased in Peru since 1997, with 54.8% of Peruvians living
now in poverty and 24.4% in extreme poverty. At the same time, many social indicators have improved,
a reflection of improvements made during the past ten years in basic infrastructure and social services.

iii. 
Public impatience with lack of growth of employment and economic opportunities has made it
essential that the government bring stakeholders to agree on strategies and programs if it is to be able to
move the country forward. This has been done in part through the strengthening of citizen "roundtables
for the fight against poverty" (Mesas de Concertacidn para la Lucha contra la Pobreza) at the national,
departrnental and municipal levels, and the completion of a national dialogue leading to a 29 point
statement of agreed policies, the National Agreement, signed by, major political parties and civil society
organizations in July 2002. In addition, government has recently re-organized several key ministries and,
in the face of public protest, has reassessed its approach to implementing its remaining privatization
agenda.

iv. 
The government strategy to reduce poverty is organized around 3 central objectives, which form
the framework for this CAS: 
(i) competitiveness and employment generation; (ii) equity and social
justice, including access to health, education, culture and basic services; and (iii) institutionality, creating
an efficient, transparent and decentralized state. Key to these objectives is the presence of an economic
program and institutions ready to buffer the impact of shocks, and thus ensure that poverty reduction
gains are not lost, while addressing structural sources of poverty. In light of the high dollar indebtedness
of the economy, government is working to strengthen fiscal balances through controls on expenditures,
improved debt management, and increased tax collections, as well as initiating a national competitiveness
program for addressing barriers to private sector growth and increasing exports.

ii

The World Bank Group Program and Risks

v. 
This CAS covers four years, FY03-06, in order to coincide with the period of the national
administration. A mid-term progress report will be presented to the Board elaborating on progress made
towards the program goals. In the base case presented by the CAS, the Bank's program includes a mix of
support through programmatic and investment lending averaging $230 million per year, resulting in
approximately $175 million per year in disbursements. Lending may fall to a low case, or increase to a
high case depending on whether policy performance "triggers" are met. These triggers cover the overall
macroeconomic framework, tax revenue collection, the successful launching of reforms in three important
areas (public sector institutions, decentralization, and competitiveness), and portfolio performance. If tax
revenues drop below 11.9% of GDP or there are problems in maintaining reforms or the macro-economic
framework, lending would fall to a low case scenario, averaging no more than $130 million per year,
limited to investment 
in priority social sectors. Achievement of a high case would depend of
improvements in tax revenue and substantial progress in reforms, with lending increasing to a range of
$300-400 million per year, including both programmatic and investment lending.

vi. 
The CAS continues an emphasis on social sector institutional reform and demand-driven poverty
reduction programs, through sector investments and a second and third Programmatic Social Reform
Loans. New emphasis is given to the areas of competitiveness and public sector management through
policy dialogue on decentralization, fighting corruption, and private participation in infrastructure, and a
series of programmatic and technical assistance loans focusing on public sector management and
competitiveness. Macro-economic and structural reform issues are addressed in advisory and analytical
assistance (AAA), and are directly linked to the lending scenarios through the lending triggers. The views
from a recent client survey regarding the Bank will be used to reinforce efforts to improve portfolio
performance, including an increased focus on performance indicators and participation of a newly
established advisory council to provide timely feedback on program issues and performance.

vii. 
Health, education and agricultural research adaptable program loans already in place are
supporting broad sector reforms and future phases will support deepening of reforms. In infrastructure,
an ambitious program is designed to support the decentralization of regional road management, the
implementation of a rapid bus corridor system to connect poor neighborhoods of Lima, and a multi-sector
approach to rural infrastructure, that would build on the experiences of the current rural roads, rural water
supply and rural development projects. 
In addition, support for community development through
decentralized councils is planned through the new Sierra Area Development Project. 
Institutional and
policy reforms in the social sectors are supported through the Programmatic Social Reform Loans
(PSRLs), while a similar programmatic reform program is envisioned to begin in FY05 focusing on
competitiveness and public sector management. These will be complemented by investment loans to
strengthen property rights institutions and modernize the justice system and a technical assistance loan to
support decentralization and local government capacity building. Continued attention will be given to the
issue of inclusion of indigenous peoples and empowerment of the poor, especially with the
implementation of a Japan Social Development Fund project for "Giving Voice to the Poor," the
development of a city poverty strategy for Lima, and continuation of programs with indigenous and
community-based organizations through an active civil society program. An active Global Environment
Facility (GEF) program is in place and will be expanded with the proposed Lima Urban Transport and
Participatory Management of Protected Areas projects.
viii. 
Consistent with the above priorities, the International Finance Corporation (IFC) will continue to
support sectors that provide the greatest benefit to the Peruvian private sector: 
(i) the financial sector,
including exploring facilities with banks or specialized financial institutions to aid in the restructuring of
corporates; (ii) infrastructure, to enhance competitiveness; (iii) direct investment in the real and service

Peru Country Assistance Strateigy

sectors (such as, manufacturing, tourism, agribusiness, and the social sectors) to assist in corporate
restructuring and investment; and (iv) the natural resource sector, especially in the area of sustainable
development.
ix. 
The principal risks identified by this CAS are three: 
(i) that external shocks will have adverse
effects on the financial sector and on growth in Peru, exacerbated by the high current levels of
indebtedness in both public and private sectors; (ii) that the process of decentralization and response to
social demands may in itself lead to fiscal sustainability problems for government, especially if fiscal
revenues do not improve; and (iii) the implementation capacity of the public sector may be overstretched
by the need for significant policy and institutional reforms covering social sectors, infrastructure and
productive poverty reduction programs. Efforts by the Bank to mitigate these risks include: (i) structuring
Bank support for reforms in selected sectors around programs rather than projects, as has already been
successfully initiated in the social sectors via the health and education adaptable program loans and the
Programmatic Social Reform Loans (PRSLs); (ii) addressing issues of fiscal sustainability as part of the
pre-conditions 
for maintaining a base lending case; and (iii) working with the government on
decentralization and improving fiscal and debt management in coordination with other public sector
management improvement efforts being supported by the IADB.

Issues for Board Discussion

x. 

Executive Directors may wish to address the following questions:
* Are the triggers for moving from the base to high and low case lending scenario appropriate?

* Does the mixture of sector investment and programmatic reform loans focusing on social
sectors and competitiveness seem appropriate?

* How can the Bank best balance concern to manage risks given its high exposure in Peru, with
support to the Peruvian government's reform program?

MEMORANDUM OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
AND THE INTERNATIONAL FINANCE CORPORATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
COUNTRY ASSISTANCE STRATEGY
FOR THE REPUBLIC OF PERU

I. 

INTRODUCTION

1. 
This Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) has been prepared with the objective of supporting the
government strategy for poverty reduction. 
In the 90's the WBG was a valuable partner in a time of first
generation reforms and centrally driven expansion of services to the poor. This success was increasingly
undermined in the late nineties through weakened institutions and failing governance. The years ahead
present the WBG with the formidable challenge to accompany Peru in the complex task of rebuilding
institutions across a wide range of areas from revitalizing the economy, to reducing poverty, to solidifying
citizen representation and participation in the development agenda.

II. THE COUNTRY CONTEXT

A. 
Political, Social and Economic Context
2. 
From July 2000 to July 2001, Peruvians witnessed tumultuous but peaceful political events
unprecedented in the country. Shortly after former President Fujimori took office for a third term in July
2000 following a controversial reelection, a corruption scandal broke out which brought down the
government. 
In November 2000, Congress appointed Mr. Valentin Paniagua to replace him as the
president of a transitional government. New elections were held in June 2001, and President Alejandro
Toledo took office in July for a 5 year termL
3. 
President Fujimori's government left an inheritance of a strengthened economic policy and
poverty reduction programs, and significant improvements in security in both rural and urban areas with
the end of the Sendero Luminoso guerrilla activity throughout most of Peru. However, there was a
deterioration in the public institutions, and little development of regional and local governments. The
transition government took on the task of conducting clean elections, and took important steps to
strengthen democracy, including restoring freedom of the press, revamping higher levels of the armed
forces, making changes in the judiciary, and rejoining the Inter-American Human Rights court. These
achievements were met with large popular support.
4. 
The Toledo administration was inaugurated in the midst of an economic recession which began in
1998, largely as a result of external shocks. The economic and social measures announced by the
administration in October 2001 received strong support in the Madrid Consultative Group Meeting. 
In
early February 2002, the government signed a two-year Stand-by Agreement with the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) for US$316 million (Annex H). However, with rising poverty, unemployment and
crime, and continued low levels of private investment, there are strong social and political pressures
throughout the country. These include demands for financing for regional development, subsidies or
special tax exemptions for the private sector, larger social benefits, to reinstate or compensate workers
fired from public entities during the past ten years, and halt further privatization and concession of

Peru Country Assistance Strateyv 

2

infrastructure and public services. 
In June 2002, plans to sell two power plants in southern Peru were
halted in response to popular opposition, and it is expected that the pace of future privatizations will be
slowed down. 
In July 2002 growing criticism led to cabinet level changes, and 9 of the ministers were
changed, including the minister of Finance and the president of the Council of Ministers. However, in
spite of these changes, the basic policy thrusts- established in the first year of the administration remain
constant.

5. 
Following the dramatic political changes of 2000, a process of consultation on reforms and public
policy was initiated by the transitional national government in 2001 with the assistance of the Catholic

Church, NGOs, and local governments. Citizen roundtables, called Mesas de Concertaci6n para la

Lucha contra la Pobreza (roundtables for the fight against poverty) were established at national,
departmental and municipal levels to foster dialogue among stakeholders on development priorities and
policies, increase accountability and transparency of public expenditures, and enhance regional, strategic
planning. 
In addition, an Indigenous Amazon Peoples Multi-sectoral Mesa was formed to provide a
forum for conflict resolution and consultation. A National Commission of Amazon, Andean and Afro-
Peruvian Peoples was then created and is formulating a proposal for an indigenous law through a process
of national consultation. These regional and indigenous Mesas have become the key feature of the
government's program to increase citizen participation.

6. 
To further address the need for consensus on economic and social policies, President Toledo led a
process to reach a National Agreement ("Acuerdo Nacional'), which was completed and signed in July
2002 (see Anmex E). Through a four month consultation process, the Agreement was developed with the
participation of political parties, NGOs, academic institutions, grassroots organizations, labor unions, and
the private sector and provides the framework for government's strategy.

B. 

Poverty: Profile, Trends and Voices of the Poor

7. 
During the last five years poverty' has increased, rising 
7.1% from 1997 to 2001 when it reached a level of 54.8% (Table 
1), mirroring the drop in per capita GDP from 1997-2001 of 
.77% average per year. This rise more than wiped out the gains 
made between 1994 and 1997 when poverty fell 4.5% during a 
period of average per capita GDP growth of 4.3%. The picture is 
not completely negative, however. During 1997-2001 extreme 
poverty grew only slightly, increasing 1.3% to its current rate of 
24.4%. At the same 
time, several key social 
indicators, 

including 

infant and maternal mortality 

rates, 

improved 

significantly. Infant mortality in rural areas dropped from 62 per 
1,000 live births to 45 per 1,000 from 1995 to 2000. Maternal 

mortality overall dropped from 265 per 100,000 to 185 per 

100,000 from 1993 to 2000.

Poverty 

continues 

to 

be 

heavily 

concentrated in rural areas where poverty rates 

are close to double that of urban areas, and the 

rate of extreme poverty is five times as high. 
Within rural areas more than two out of every 
three Peruvians live in poverty; while over half 
of rural Peruvians are considered extremely poor 
the incidence of poverty varies significantly 
across the regions. The sierra (highlands) and 
selva (jungle) have poverty rates of nearly 
double that of the coast (Table 2). More than 
half of the extreme poor population reside in the 
rural sierra, though it has less than a quarter of 
the 
national 
population. The 
sierra 
is 
characterized by subsistence agriculture, scarce

arable land, fractured topography, and high production risks. Labor productivity is one-half that in Peru
as a whole and education levels are low. Average net rural household income is only $1 .30/day compared
to $3.10 in Peru as a whole. On the positive side, growing mining and tourist activity have improved
economic prospects and helped create better jobs in certain areas of the sierra.
9. 
Addressing the problems of indigenous peoples in Peru is one of the most important challenges
in the fight against poverty. When defined as those who speak an indigenous language as their mother
tongue, indigenous people are estimated to account for 15% of Peru's population, and have a poverty rate
of 70%. 
Indigenous households consistently lack the most basic services such as running water and
sewage, with only 21.4% of indigenous dwellings having access to public sewage facilities in comparison
to 71.6% of non-indigenous ones. Non-indigenous males earn 2.3 times the wage of indigenous males.
Only about one half of the labor force is fully employed, about a tenth unemployed and the
10. 
remainder underemployed. Of those who work, more than half receive poverty wages, or less than
$1/hour. Even with a university education earnings are low, about a third of workers with university
degrees also earn less than $1/hour. This in part reflects the poor quality of education and the resulting
low level of productivity, which is one of the region's lowest.
About 80% of the extreme poor work in agriculture and fishing, which makes them particularly
11. 
vulnerable to the economic effects of the El Niflo and other weather phenomena. The last El Nifuo event,
of 1997-1998, heavily affected agriculture and fishing and damaged transportation routes and housing in
northern Peru, while creating drought conditions in the Andean highlands.
12. 
Access to education is widespread, and from 1997 to 2001 there was an important increase in
access to secondary education, increasing to 74% attendance in urban areas (up 3.5%) and to 44% in rural
areas (up 7%). At the primary level, attendance rates for poor and non-poor students are over 90%.
Nevertheless, education quality and outcomes are very poor. This problem is compounded in rural
areas where there are low effective hours of instruction (250 hrs per year compared to nationally
mandated 1050 hrs), inadequate learning materials, and poor teacher quality and motivation. Overall,
children in Peru are performing poorly on standardized tests, with rural indigenous children most
seriously under-performing. Only 22% of 6th graders from Lima and less than 2.2% of students in rural
areas passed the comprehension test.

height for age, or stunting), see Table 3. The rate of chronic malnutrition in Peru is similar to that found
in Bolivia, a country with about one-half its income level, twice the rate of Colombia and four times that
of the Dominican Republic, countries with comparable income levels to Peru. Chronic malnutrition is
largely a problem of rural Peru. As with other dimensions of poverty, infant and maternal mortality
continue to be much higher in rural areas where quality of water is lower, outreach by health workers is
sparse, and access to health facilities is limited due to inadequacy and distance of facilities, and lack of
roads and communications systems.
14. 
During the 90's there have been improvements for Peruvian women, particularly in health.
Within a short period of time, fertility rates fell from 3.5 children in 1996 to 2.9 in 2000, still slightly
above the LAC average of 2.6. In seven years, maternal mortality rates fell from 265 to 185 deaths per
100,000 live births. However, this figure is still higher than Colombia's rate of 120 deaths/100,000,
despite their similar per capita income levels. Geographic, economic and cultural barriers keep the poor
from using health facilities.
15. Women's illiteracy rates are nearly three times those of men's (17% and 6.1%, respectively), and
higher than the LAC average of 13% for women. Poor women are three times more likely to be illiterate
as their non-poor counterparts, and nearly half of poor rural women are illiterate. For school-age
children, however, statistics show little differentiation by gender. Performance and retention levels are
generally the same for boys and girls.
16. 
Results of the Voices of the Poor study. The "Voices of the Poor" participatory poverty
diagnosis was conducted by the United Kingdom Department for International Development (DFID) and
the World Bank to complement what had been learned from the many consultations that have taken place
since the last CAS. Nine poor communities participated in the study, from rural and urban areas from the
coastal, sierra and selva regions.
17. 
Poverty, as experienced and described by poor people themselves has many dimensions,
including:

* Unemployment/sub-employment
* Lack of power over market conditions
* Small farms' dependency and vulnerability
* High cost of falling ill
* Deficient educational services
* Discriminatory and corrupt practices of public institutions
* Limited access to justice
* Difficulties in securing arable land and rights of tenure
* Lack of safety and security
* Family under stress, including violence at home
* Discriminatory gender roles
* 
Insufficient access to formal credit
* Frustrated youth

18. 
The findings of the Voices of the Poor study point to the need for a poverty alleviation strategy to
emphasize: (i) improved governance at local levels including the systems of justice, health and education,
as well as basic services and agricultural development; (ii) addressing the problem of discrimination
experienced by the poor when trying to access services; (iii) providing mechanisms to help individuals
and families in crises for health or other reasons; and (iv) the importance of economic growth that results
in job creation and opportunities for the poor.
19. 
Milennium Development Goals (MDGs). Peru has targeted improvements in 6 of the key
MDG targets, including poverty reduction, infant mortality, chronic malnutrition in children, maternal
mortality, and access to safe water supply (Table 4). Peru's targets for education improvement focus on
achievements scores and attendance in secondary school, as the education MDG target, universal
attendance at the primary level has essentially been achieved. Achievement of these 6 MDG targets for
2015, however, appears unlikely. 
In the area of poverty reduction, Peru is not alone. A recent review
concluded that most countries in the LAC region are not likely to reach the MDG of cutting extreme
poverty in half by 2015.

C. 
Social Sector Expenditures and Poverty Targeting
20. 
In spite of the recession and resulting fiscal retrenchment, the share of social expenditure to GDP
has not declined in the last two years. While total expenditure has decreased from 19 percent of GDP to
17.8 percent of GDP in the period 1999-2002 (Figure 1), significant pro-poor spending reallocation have
taken place (Figure 2). Decreases in the budget for defense and national security have been accompanied
by increases in the budgets for education, health and social assistance. Authorities intend to raise the
budgeted share of social expenditure from an average of 50 percent in 1997-2001 to 56 percent in 2002-
2006.

21. 
Resource transfers from central to local governments in the two largest transfer programs-
Fondo de Compensacion Municipal and the Canon Minero-benefit poor districts, but have been
irregular and subject to delays. These transfers have not been transparent, and there has been little or no
review of how well they are used. Local associations and NGOs have raised questions about these two
fund distribution mechanisms, complaining that neither the distribution nor the use of these resources is
clear.
22. 
Spending on programs designed to reduce extreme poverty increased substantially between 1993
and 2002. However, recent evaluations raise questions of the targeting efficiency of some of these
programs. For example, for every dollar assigned by the Central Government to the "Glass of Milk"
distribution program, direct beneficiaries 
receive only 29 cents, with 
the remainder going to
administrative and other, often unaccounted for, costs. This problem reflects lack of audit controls and
poor transparency of Central Government transfers to local governments and to program committees.
Targeting is also an issue, as 30% to 45% of the recipients of key safety net programs fall outside the
designated target group.

D. 
Recent Economic Developments and Performance
23. 
Peru's macroeconomic conditions have remained stable since the last CAS Progress Report of
2001 but there is uncertainty regarding the medium-term. 2 During the first year of the Toledo
Government international confidence in Peru's economic policies and performance has been high. After
no growth in 2001, economic recovery appears to be underway with the economy growing 3% in the first
quarter of 2002 driven by construction and mining. 
Inflation remains in single-digit (Figure 3),
international reserves are adequate (Table 5), and the Peruvian Sol has appreciated 5 percent in real

terms. 
But there is yet to be recovery in employment and other vulnerabilities remain. Adequate
financing for the government is not certain after the recent privatization suspension, bank credit to the
private sector continues to fall, foreign debt is high, fiscal revenue and exports should be much larger,
fiscal adjustment is lagging, and the mining sector faces important environmental and social challenges.
While revenues are anticipated to rise with a tax reform already underway, delays in the implementation
of both the tax reform and privatization agenda may result in a need to contract public expenditures to
maintain fiscal stability. Two major challenges of the government are to: (i) maintain and build stable
economic policies that will engender investors' confidence for growth, and (ii) build effective public
institutions.

Growth has been volatile in Peru. During the
capital inflow-surge episode of the 1990s, and until the 

emerging market crises of 1997-1998, GDP growth in 

Latin America averaged around 4 percent a year, and
poverty 
levels 
fell significantly. 
Peru was no 
exception. During 1991-1997, Peru's average annual 

real GDP growth rate was over 5 percent, reaching 7

Peru has been meager (Figure 3). The combination of 
external shocks and a political crisis during 2000-2001 explain Peru's faltering growth in the last few
years. Deterioration of terms of trade, the El Nifno weather phenomenon, and the high cost and scarcity of
external financing were the main shocks hitting Peru in the late 1990s.

The large drop of the current account deficit 

to 2.1 percent of GDP in 2001 from 6.4 percent of 
GDP in 1998-and an associated drop in investment 
(Figure 4)-is a reflection of the deep adjustment
that has taken place in recent years in Peru. A 
recession, higher interest rates, and the inability of 
bank customers to service their outstanding debts led 
to a deterioration of banks' portfolios 
in Peru's 
sector. 4

exits and a major consolidation have taken place since 1998. Since then, systemic risk in the banking
system has been reduced.

Peru's fiscal stance is fragile, and vulnerabilities in the financial sector still remain. During
Peru's boom period fiscal revenue increased and so did expenditures in both the Central Goverrnent
(CG) and the General Government (GG). These expenditures were not cut when the shocks hit Peru
(Figure 5). This led to primary and overall fiscal imbalances to suddenly surface (Figure 6). Peru's

primary and overall fiscal deficits have been sustained since, due to pre-electoral over spending in 2000
and poor policy decisions such as new tax exemptions in the transition government and wage increases in
recent years. The non-financial public sector (NFPS) 2001 fiscal deficit has been estimated at 2.5 percent
of GDP. This deficit is 0.7 percentage point lower than last year's, but higher than the 2 percent of GDP
target required by the Fiscal Responsibility Law approved in 2000. The Government financed its deficit
through privatization proceeds and domestic financing, including public entity deposits in the banking
system and pension funds.
27. 
While interest rates on both bank deposit and lending rates have come down substantially,
deposit-lending interest rate spreads remain high.5 This reflects risks in the banking system in view of
slow economic growth, levels of income required to fund provisions6 and inefficiencies in the sector.
Today, non-performing loans stand at 11 percent of total loans (Table 5). However, there has been no
further deterioration in the performance of bank portfolios since mid-2000. Furthermore, loan-loss
provisions in terms of non-performing loans increased to 98.1 percent in 2001 from 78.5 in 2000. Efforts
to strengthen further the banking regulatory framework are underway. Non-performing loans, together
with pension system and local government debt, remain a threat to sustainable budget deficit in Peru.
Although registered municipal debt is small, non-registered debt could be significant for some local-
governments.
28. 
Peru's debt is high. In 2001, Peru's external debt
stock was estimated at 50% of GDP, or 3.2 times exports 
of goods and services. Of this amount, private external 
debt accounts for about 30% ($8.1 billion), of which
nearly 40% is short term and mostly linked to foreign trade
transactions. Public external debt represents around 70 
percent of Peru's total external debt, and virtually all is 
long term. Total public debt, both domestic and external, 
is about $25 billion, or 2.6 times general government 
current revenue. Over three-quarters of the total public 
debt is external, and around 60 percent of the public debt is 
with multilateral and bilateral creditors (Figures 7-8). 
Growing debt service, which increased from 3 percent of 
GDP in 1998 to a projected 3.8 percent of GDP in 2002, 
has contributed to tighten already scarce resources in a
shrinking and rigid budget.
29. 
This debt profile makes Peru less vulnerable 
to changes 
in investor sentiment than other Latin 
America emerging markets. Peru had not borrowed in
international capital markets until February 2002, 
when it placed a US$500 million global ten-year bond 
and, 
to 
reduce debt-servicing 
costs, 
issued an 
additional US$930 million to retire the Brady bonds.
This was a successful operation since the spread
obtained was lower than that of Colombia, which had
placed an international bond only a few months earlier.
Since then, Peru's international bond spreads have 
increased due to increased domestic and regional 
uncertainty. 
In an effort to develop the domestic

capital markets, the government has issued domestic currency debt, but at current stock levels (US$340
million in 2001 and US$570 million targeted for 2002), it does not imply a significant additional
vulnerability risk in Peru.
30. 
Because of its high degree of dollarization, Peru does not have much freedom in monetary and
exchange rate policies. Increased liquidity would quickly translate into inflation or international reserve
losses, if the Central Bank attempts to keep the exchange rate stable. In the context of high debt, these
policy constraints make Peru vulnerable and highlight the need to increase exports to prevent large
adjustments of relative prices if faced with negative shocks. Peru's exports have grown in recent years,
however they are still low, at 16 percent of GDP (2001).
31. 
Medium term prospects for Peru are uncertain and the country faces risks. Peru enjoys
international credibility and recent real GDP data suggest that unless a major shock hits Peru, projected
GDP growth rates in the range of 3 to 4 percent could be achieved during the period covered by this CAS
(Table 5). Also, systemic risk in the financial sector appears to be limited. Peru's major vulnerabilities
are its foreign currency debt and political conflicts that make it difficult to achieve a unified voice
regarding a strategy to restore growth. To mitigate those risks, the Peruvian authorities have been
building a financing plan, combining efforts leading to materialize external donor financing, access
international capital markets by placing sovereign bonds, and proceed with privatization at a smooth pace
(see Section V).
E. 
Private Sector Development
32. 
Frequent policy changes, and high indebtedness in the corporate sector with consequent bank
reluctance to lend are part of the competitiveness problems in Peru, which is reflected in low levels of
exports compared to other LAC countries. In 2001, Peru had an export to GDP ratio of 16%, lower than
neighboring countries such as Chile (35%), Ecuador (34%) and Bolivia (19%). Traditional exports of
mining and fishing, plus natural gas, continue to account for over two-thirds of export revenues in 2001.
Manufacturing grew to only 22% of exports by 2001, compared to the LAC average of 58%. Key non-
financial factors behind Peru's lack of export competitiveness in non-traditional sectors are (i) the high
costs of transport and business logistics; (ii) the low level of "formalization" and standardization in the
export industry which affects both productivity and quality; (iii) shifts in "rules of the game" which deter
investment; and (iv) the fragmentation and lack of coordination of the supply chains, and lack of value
added components.
33. 
High levels of corporate indebtedness. Peru's formal private sector became highly indebted
during the first half of the 1990s. With the abrupt slowdown of the economy after 1997, many
corporations faced- increasing difficulties to service that debt. For the top 100 companies the average debt
to equity ratio increased from about 1:1 in 1995 to 1.3:1 in 2000.7 Debt servicing problems became
particularly acute in firms with dollar debt and sol revenue following the depreciation of the sol. With the
increase in bank customer defaults, the number of corporate insolvencies has also soared. The National
Institute of Competition, 1NDECOPI, 8 provides alternative debtor/creditor dispute resolution mechanisms
to circumvent the judicial bottlenecks tied to the bankruptcy process. Although the process provides for a
de facto Chapter 11-type reorganization of corporate debt, over 70 percent of the cases presented to
INDECOPI have resulted in liquidation of the firm. 
In many other cases, groups of creditors (and
sometimes debtors) appealed to the formal judiciary on decisions unfavorable to them, following the
conclusion of the extra judicial process brokered by INDECOPI, indicating that the mechanism for
corporate debt restructuring is not functioning optimally.

intellectual property rights, consumer protection, and corporate restructuring. INDECOPI does not make decisions, but provides
facilitating services to creditors and debtors through a decentralized organizational structure.

34. 
Constraints to growth in credit services. Peru's banking sector has experienced significant
changes since the last CAS. In response to the deterioration of bank loan portfolio, there was a sharp
increase in provisioning and losses, which in turn prompted the intervention of a number of institutions by
the government. From 25 banks in December 1997, only 15 are still operating. With the failure of
domestic institutions, foreign banks increased their presence 9 on the Peruvian market, with 40 percent of
bank assets now held by foreign banks. The restructuring of the banking sector was accompanied by a
significant drop in lending to the private sector: 
the ratio of private sector credit to GDP fell from 28
percent of GDP in 1998 to 25 percent in 2001, in spite of the increase in the system's liquidity.'0 Several
factors continue to limit credit growth: (i) the current indebtedness problems in the Peruvian corporate
sector and lack of efficient market exit mechanisms for insolvent companies; (ii) the still deficient legal
and judicial framework for executing and realizing of collateral; (iii) low level of formalization among
potential borrowers 
in terms of accounting practices, and management and corporate governance
structures; (iv) continuing and increased demand for low risk central bank bills and more recently treasury
issued debt, resulting in fewer incentives for banks to supply credit as a necessary business line to
maintain earnings; and (v) an increase in government domestic debt issuance resulting in lower demand
for bank credit by public entities.
35. 
Peru has one of the leading micro-finance industries in the world with 53 different entities and
NGOs covering the sector. However, a large under-served market continues to rely heavily upon
informal finance. As of June 2000, loans to micro-enterprises and the rural sector represented about 9
percent of borrowers and 2 percent of the total loan portfolio of regulated banking system. In spite of the
substantial growth of credit to micro-enterprises, only about 12 percent of the estimated 3.1 million
micro-enterprises have access to formal credit. Credit access is hindered by an inadequate institutional
framework, including the traditional mechanisms for issuing and recording titles, and for the pledging,
execution and realization of collateral through the judiciary. Although some improvement has taken
place in recent years many challenges remain in the matter of establishing modem property and credit
markets.
36. 
Mining. Peru's minerals industry is one of the key industries for the country's economic and
social development. The sector generates more than 45% of the country's export earnings, contributing
about 5% of Peru's GDP and nearly 22% of total tax revenues. Mining is particularly relevant in some of
the mountainous areas of the country which are among the poorest regions and could contribute to
reducing regional income disparities. While the mining industry has long been Peru's most prosperous
sector, investors' interest in the sector has dropped dramatically. Current projections are of investments
of US$500 million a year between 2003 and 2005, and only US$200 to US$250 million a year thereafter.
37. 
The drop in investors' interest is linked to both institutional weaknesses and regulatory risks, as
well as the fall in minerals and metals prices. The institutional and regulatory issues are:

* Roles and responsibilities of sector actors are unclear: The mining sector reform of the early
1990's have never been finalized, and the "rules of the game" and the scope and
responsibility of each sector entity remain unclear to investors;

* Government's environmental management is weak. Mining firms find it hard to address the
social or political tensions related large mining projects, especially given the absence of a
governmental 
authority 
independent of sector 
institutions 
that 
is able 
to address
environmental and social compliance issues;

* 

Implementation of mining revenue tax ("canon minero") is still unclear and the subject of
conflict. While the transfer to regions of a percentage of the mining revenue tax was created

Peru Country Assistance Strategy 

12

by a 1992 law, and revised in 1999, there is disagreement on how these laws should be
interpreted and applied, and lack of transparency surrounding the transfers.
38. 
Fisheries. The fisheries industry accounted for 16% of exports in 2001, but it risks falling into
decline due to over-fishing, the impact of the cyclical El Nino phenomenon, growing competition from
soy flour for feed ingredients, and indebtedness of the industry. The sector needs to: (i) adopt a rights-
based resource management system to ensure economic efficiency and biological sustainability; (ii)
develop an appropriate balance of artisanal and industrial fishing; (iii) decentralize selected regulatory
management functions; and (iv) increase diversification and value-added activities.

F. 
Public Sector Management and Decentralization
39. 
Progress in governance and institutional development has not kept pace with other reforms.
During the economic reform programs of the 1990's, a broad state modernization program was designed
but was never initiated. As a result, Peruvian public administration continues to suffer from system-wide
problems, including weak accountability, poor policy coordination, the absence of a coherent public
sector pay and employment policy, and weak institutional mechanisms to check administrative abuses.
While certain public entities have instituted improved financial controls with the help of an integrated
financial management system, the overall quality of public~ expenditure management suffers from overly
centralized decision-making, frequent and nontransparent use of executive decree authority to modify
budgetary allocations, and discretional budget execution by non-accountable, centrally-appointed
Transitory Councils 
for Regional Administration 
(CTARs). 
Overall, organizational confusion,
duplication of programs, lack of coordination and centralization result in poor performance within the
public sector.
40. 
Decentralization. Increased political, administrative and fiscal decentralization is in the process
of being designed and implemented in Peru in response to demands for greater local control and
participation. A well-conceived decentralization policy could make a significant contribution to
improving public sector performance, if accompanied with clear transfers of responsibilities and
development of local management capacity. Decentralization measures, however, have the inherent
danger of: (i) increasing public sector deficits if resources transferred to subnational governments are not
offset by additional revenues or reduced central expenditures; (ii) providing opportunities and incentives
for increased borrowing by subnational governments that may lead to over-indebtedness and to national
government being "forced" to assume responsibility for local government debts in times of crisis; and (iii)
deteriorating the quality of public services, if subnational governments are required to take over
responsibilities for which they are either unprepared or unwilling to manage. Actions to avoid these
common pitfalls in decentralization need to be taken when the policies, guidelines and the sequencing of
decentralization are being designed.
41. 
Justice. Peru's justice sector institutions are at a critical crossroads. Although their level of
independence from political control has improved after 2000 (against a strong tradition of interference for
more than three decades), they retain a negative reputation for not providing responsive services. The
justice sector institutions urgently need to develop services that benefit a wide variety of users including
the poor, consolidate recent innovations and recapture citizen respect. Such increased responsiveness can
be achieved by better service planning and resource management, more coordinated policy-making and
empowerment of decentralized units (i.e. judicial districts and court offices) in order to transform the
justice sector into a modem public service.
42. 
Corruption. Corruption is perceived as a significant issue by Peruvians, according to a recent
survey, supported by the World Bank Institute. The survey reports that the judiciary and the public
security apparatus (the police, the armed forces) are perceived as particularly prone to corruption
associated in many instances to attempts to politicize the institutions or their decisions. At the same time,
some institutions, including INDECOPI (market regulation), Banco de la Naci6n, and the Ombudsman's

Peru Country Assistance Stratev 

13

Office, stand out as low on perceptions of corruption. Respondents reported their perception that bribes
are frequently used to shape key government policies (high level judiciary, legislative and executive) in
addition to obtaining public contracts or services.

HI. 

THE GOVERNMENT STRATEGY

43. 
The National Agreement, signed on July 22, 2002, includes 29 agreed policies organized into four
broad areas: democracy and rule of law; competitiveness of the country; equity and social justice; and an
efficient, transparent and decentralized state. An initial group of success indicators have been identified
and are presented in Table 4. Additional indicators should provide a basis for monitoring all of the
National Agreement policies. Because of the high degree of overlap between the first and fourth areas,
for the purpose of the CAS, these two areas will be addressed together both in the presentation of the
government's and in Section 1V, the WBG strategy. Thus, three strategic areas can be summarized as: (i)
competitiveness; (ii) equity and social justice; and (iii) institutionality. Measures to directly address the
overarching objective of poverty reduction are included mainly in the first two areas, competitiveness and
equity and social justice.
44. 
Competitiveness-bringing about greater competitiveness of Peru's private sector and new
employment opportunities. New strategies are being developed to foster competitiveness, including the
development of a "National Competitiveness Plan" as a joint private/public sector initiative. Key
objectives of the plan are to: (i) generate a favorable investment climate in Peru, and (ii) reduce logistics
and operational costs for business. The recently created National Competitiveness Council is responsible
for developing and overseeing plan implementation. US Congress approval of the Andean Trade
Preference Act (ATPA)-which allows a range of products into the United States at zero tariffs-is an
important complement to this competitiveness objective.
45. 
A key ingredient of a favorable investment climate is having a consistent economic program that
will attract domestic and foreign financing for the expected growth, in particular that of exports. To
stabilize -and increase tax revenue the government has embarked on a program of tax reform, eliminating
tax exemptions and prohibiting new ones, modifying tax rates; and strengthening tax administration. By
additionally cutting non-social expenditure, government's target is to achieve a primary surplus close to I
percent of GDP from 2004-05 onwards required to improve debt sustainability. 1 1 Government's
achievement of this goal would bring NFPS deficits down from 2.5 percent of GDP in 2001 to 1.3 percent
of GDP in 2005. These fiscal measures-together with the revamping of the Law of Fiscal Prudence and
Transparency-are expected to strengthen the credibility of the government's program.
46. 
To reduce the cost of doing businesses, the government is already seeking: (i) the passage of a
new ports law; which would establish the framework for private sector participation and increasing
efficiency of ports, in particular the port of Callao; (ii) decentralization and improvement in the
management of the departmental road network to better integrate economic activity and thus create new
employment opportunities; and (iii) development of regional and product-specific strategies for
promoting competitiveness, with the involvement of private and public stakeholders.
47. 
The goveriiment wants to foster larger private sector participation not only in ports, but also in
remaining areas of electricity generation and distribution, in selected water supply and sanitation systems,
and in the highway sector. The objective of this effort is twofold, to improve the efficiency of
management of these services, and to attract private sector investment to expand services. These efforts
build on an already active program of privatization completed between 1992 and 2002, which covered
mining, hydrocarbons, airports, one seaport, telecommunications, and approximnately two-thirds of all
energy facilities. Plans for future concessions and privatizations, however, are now taking into account
increasingly active opposition and demands for consultation as part of the decision-making process.

48. 
Finally, the government is aware of flaws in its environmental management system, which
hamper private sector development. 
The reform of the early 1990s succeeded 
in developing
environmental management capacity in sector ministries. While necessary, this has not been sufficient to
address the serious social and environmental issues. Conflicts have arisen due to contaminating spills,
resettlement, and problems in the implementation of the canon minero (para 37). While the government
has identified the need to establish an environmental oversight agency that could act independently of the
involved ministries, the strategy has not been agreed yet.
49. 
Equity and Social Justice-providing all Peruvians with access to quality health, education,
culture and basic services. The government's efforts in this area concentrate on re-orienting fiscal
resources towards education, health, water and sanitation services, and increasing the efficiency of the use
of these resources by ensuring that social programs are adequately designed and directed to the needs of
the poor. This includes: 
(i) 
increasing social and productive programs in areas of high poverty
concentration, (ii) gradually reallocating resources away from inefficient social programs; (iii) improving
the targeting mechanisms to ensure that resources reach the poor; and (iv) significant institutional reforms
required to improve service quality.
50. 
In health, the government strategy is to improve health outcomes for the poor through preventive
and primary care in two ways: (i) strengthening and expanding coverage of the Seguro Integral de Salud
(SIS), a new program for poor mothers, infants and school children, and (ii) expanding coverage of the
successful CLAS program, the Comunidad Local de Administraci6n de Salud program, where primary
health centers and posts are co-managed by the public sector and representatives of the community. In
addition, the government is initiating long-needed reformns in the Ministry of Health and ESSALUD, the
government managed health insurance. These include the introduction of accountability mechanisms,
including performance based contracting, and contracting for services between the Ministry and
ESSALUD programs.
51. 
In education, the government's primary objective is to improve education quality and student
achievement, as measured by standardized tests. Central to its strategy to improve education quality are
improvements to teacher career structure and pay, including a program to provide incentive payment to
rural teachers; increased participation and oversight of local communities and parents in school programs;
and improvements in the quality and access to bilingual education for indigenous children.
52. 
In rural development the social fund, FONCODES, is being reformed and strengthened to
increase the participation of municipios and communities to promote public sector decentralization. 
Its
program to finance productive investments in poor areas is being expanded significantly. An agricultural
bank has recently been launched to target credit for agriculture. As a safety net program for the
unemployed, the government initiated in June 2001 the A Trabajar ("to work") program which provides
up to six months of employment in rural areas. The program has been expanded to cover urban areas and
provided an annual budget of approximately US$90 million.
53. 
In the areas of water and sanitation, the government's objective is to increase coverage of
sustainable water and sanitation services and improve the quality of the existing service. It launched a
major program to expand services to neighborhoods of Lima/Callao.
54. 
Institutionality-democracy and rule of law and an efficient, transparent and decentralized
state. A wide range of initiatives are already in place and are significantly affecting the institutional
framework of Peru's public sector. Both the executive and legislative have given top priority to
implementing a new policy of decentralization. During 2002 the departmental level of government is
being redefined with expanded authority and responsibilities, and frst time elections for departmental
officials will occur in November 2002. Congress has modified the 1993 Constitution to formally
recognize elected regional authorities, and passed a new Regional Election Law. A series of additional
laws are being prepared to define the roles, responsibilities, and inter-relationships among the new
regional authorities, municipalities and national government.

Peru Country Assistance Strategy 

15

55. 
In the area of justice and human rights, a Truth and Reconciliation Commission has been
established to provide a forum for uncovering past abuses and atrocities and fostering a healing process
within the society. A new, National Commission on Fight Against Corruption and for Promotion of
Ethics and Transparency (CNLC) was created in 2001 in response to recommendations that the traditional
forms of control, investigation and sanctions were insufficient to deal with the magnitude of corruption in
the 1990s.
Specific actions have also been identified to make social programs more responsive, transparent
56. 
and accountable to citizens. These actions aim to provide citizens with (i) access to information about
government services, programs and budgets, (ii) mechanisms to oversee services and ensure their "voice"
is heard and reflected in government actions, and (iii) an institutional framework and recourse
mechanisms to seek resolution in the case of abuse of public roles or funds. 
In this context, several
initiatives have already been launched including the Mesas de Concertaci6n at national, regional and
municipal levels and the strengthening of the office of the Defensoria del Pueblo, and piloting of
mechanism for citizen oversight (Sistema de Vigilancia Social-SIVISO).
57. 
The government is addressing sources of inefficiencies in public spending by: (i) promoting the
use of participatory budgeting at the municipal level; (ii) instituting better controls, piloting management
contracts, and unifying dispersed social programs; (iii) updating the Peru poverty map to guide targeting
of public resources; and (iv) strengthening 
the integrated financial management systems (SIAF)
throughout government, including the use of SLAF by civil society and Congress for oversight.
Significant progress in strengthening the Peruvian judiciary took place during the last year when
58. 
the Judicial Council designated three Supreme Court Justices and started a selection process for more than
1,800 judicial positions, and the Constitutional Tribunal resumed operations. Policy and institutional
reforms have been designed to modernize justice sector institutions to improve the delivery of justice
services and restore public confidence.

IV. 

BANK GROUP ASSISTANCE STRATEGY

A. 
Objectives of the 2002 CAS
59. 
The government strategy spells out the priorities of the Toledo administration to attack poverty:
competitiveness and employment generation, access to health, education, culture and basic services; and
creating a public administration that serves the people. Key to achieve these goals is to have in place an
economic progran and institutions ready to buffer the impact of shocks--and thus ensure that poverty
reduction gains are not lost--while addressing structural sources of poverty. To achieve this, and in light
of the high dollar indebtedness of the economy, Peru needs to increase fiscal revenue and exports,
eliminate obstacles to private sector development, and strengthen governance and institutions. This CAS
aims at helping the government fulfill these needs by providing support to its fiscal program, National
Competitiveness progran, and social sector program. Assistance will be provided to make safety nets
more efficient and create growth opportunities targeted to the poor and to strengthen governance and
institutions.

B. 
Lessons Learned from Past Bank Group's Activities
60. 
Self Evaluation. A review of lessons learned from the previous CAS period was presented in the
CAS Progress Report, March 30, 2001. As pointed out in'that report, the 1997-2001 CAS foresaw less
WBG 
involvement 
in macroeconomic management, and a greater emphasis on private sector
development. However, as the external environment changed and the slowdown of the economy started
in 1997, assistance in economic management became more important. The FY99 Financial Sector
Adjustment Loan, the only adjustment operation in the second Fujimori administration, addressed reforms
in the banking sector designed to prevent a crisis similar to those that took place in neighboring countries.
OED's review of the FSAL Implementation Completion Report raised two questions: 
(i) whether the

Peru Country Assistance Strate_y 

16

reforms supported were really necessary to protect the vulnerability of Peru's banking sector; and (ii)
whether by this time the substantial deterioration of governance and economic policy management in Peru
shouldn't have argued against policy based lending. The discussion engendered by the second question
has helped to shape the triggers relating to economic and fiscal policy performance and institutional
reforms defined for moving from low to base to high case lending scenarios (see Section V).
61. 
WBG support to private sector development activity in Peru over the previous CAS period has
been consistent with the strategy set out in the previous CAS, to work in a wide range of sectors, in line
with the government's emphasis on a broad based private sector led growth. For IFC, it planned to focus
on the mining and financial sectors as well as supporting growth generating companies in additional areas
such as tourism, hydrocarbons, manufacturing, agribusiness, and infrastructure. IFC's approvals reflected
this strategy, with seven projects approved in the mining and financial sectors. A further eleven projects
were approved, with 9 in agribusiness, and one each in tourism and manufacturing. There were no
projects in infrastructure and petroleum sectors as reforms slowed during the CAS period. However,
there was one project each in education and retail, frontier sectors for IFC. Total project approvals were
over half of a billion dollars (US$615.5 million) including US$315 million in syndications. As reforms
slowed and political and economic uncertainty increased, the investment climate for the private sector
became increasingly difficult, resulting in lower IFC activity during the latter part of the CAS period.
62. 
During the past CAS period, the Bank's support to poverty reduction programs provided
important lessons. While these lessons are detailed in the 2001 CAS Progress Report, they can be
summarized as follows: 
(i) while the 1997 CAS recognized the need to decentralize government
responsibilities, authorities at that time were not receptive to such initiatives; (ii) in some sectors, health
and rural roads, the Bank was nevertheless successful in building effective models for decentralized
management and involving municipal governments; and (iii) in other areas the Bank may have been too
complacent with the over-centralistic approach of the government, as in the case of the two FONCODES
social fund loans done jointly with LADB, where little emphasis was put on the sustainability of projects
once they were completed.
63. 
During the past five years the Bank successfully expanded its work to address the inclusion of
indigenous peoples of Peru in poverty reduction and development. The Bank supported a consultation
process among Andean and Amazonian peoples, training workshops among indigenous women and Afro
Peruvians, and the preparation of the Indigenous and Afro Peruvian Peoples Development Learning and
Innovation Loan (LIL). This LEL has encountered severe management problems, and the recent
resolution of these problems has demonstrated the importance of commitment to such projects not only by
the indigenous groups involved, but also by national government.
64. 
The Bank's civil society program in Peru promoted dialogue between national and local
governments, civil society, and private sector organizations at a time when dialogue with civil society was
hardly present in Peru. During the past five years, the program worked with NGOs, community based
organizations (of youth, women, indigenous communities, and Afro-Peruvians), universities, church
organizations, and labor unions. The main program activities and results over the last five years are
summarized in Box 1. This work has opened up channels of communication with a wide range of groups
providing us with insight and understanding about the development and poverty issues facing Peru. The
Bank has forged new partnerships in supporting institutional reforms, especially in the areas of citizen
participation and transparency. The new program called SIVISO (Sistema de Vigilancia Social - social
vigilance system) is one example of the important outputs of our new collaboration with civil society.
This has been an invaluable experience, demonstrating the positive results that can come from such
efforts.

65. 
Quality Assurance Group (QAG) Assessment A recent QAG assessment of AAA in Peru'2
provides useful insights. First of all, it raises the question of whether AAA effectively addressed all of
the key concerns of economic management. It suggests that the Bank should have expanded its work on
macro-economic issues rather than relying on the IMF, and further points out that that AAA overall was
underfunded within the program. On the positive side, the QAG review notes that a "key success was the
concerted focus in issues of poverty reduction through the social and human development agenda with
analytic work of high quality and strong local participation." The quality of AAA in the social sectors, in
spite of budget restrictions, led to a very strong program of agreed reforms in both education and health,
reflected in the education and health adaptable program loans (APLs) and in the Programmatic Social
Reformn Loans (PSRLs). The strength of this AAA, and the extent to which a wide range of local
professionals and stakeholders were involved, has meant that in spite of two transitions in national
government in 2000 and 2001, the reforms identified have been supported by both of the national
administrations and by key groups involved in these sectors.

has recently been conducted and is to be discussed at the Board in early September 2002. The CAE lauds
the performance of the Bank in supporting economic reforms in the early to mid-1990s, but criticizes its
response to deteriorating conditions after 1997, when governance deteriorated and there were no new
broad reforms. According to the CAE, the Bank should have pushed harder on needed public sector
reforms in the mid 1990's and then should have paid more attention to reversals on the macroeconomic
and structural fronts, and to incipient indications of corruption.

Box 2. Peru Country Assistance Evaluation

A Country Assistance Evaluation (CAE) was prepared by the Operations Evaluation Department of the World
Bank, evaluating Bank assistance to Peru during the 1990's. The evaluation describes the Bank program in terms of several
phases. In the early 1990's, the Bank played an important, positive role which was based on an accurate and timely diagnosis
of the economic situation. Through policy advice and structural reform lending it supported the government's successful
program to stabilize the economy, reintegrate Peru in the world financial community, and carry out structural reforms.
In 1993 and 1994, the Bank's strategy changed, moving from adjustment to investment lending that financed social
sector, infrastructure and poverty reduction programs. The successful structural reforms of the early 1990's were unlikely to
be sustainable, however, unless they were followed by larger public sector reform. The findings of the CAE are that the Bank
should have played a more active role during the mid 1990's in promoting public sector and fiscal reform and that its failure
to do so constituted an important, missed opportunity.
The CAE states that at the time of the 1997 CAS there were clear indications that government was not committed to
public sector reforns identified within that strategy. In addition, a shortage of counterpart funds due to tax exemptions and
reductions, costing the equivalent of 2 percent of GDP, slowed down or stopped investment projects contained in that CAS.
The CAE judges the outcome of the Bank's assistance program during that period as unsatisfactory. 
It argues that the Bank
inappropriately redirected resources from investment to fast-disbursing adjustment loans, especially given the reversals on
macroeconomic and structural fronts and allegations of corruption.

67. 
The CAE finding that the Bank did not push enough for broad public sector reforms in the mid-
1990s may be correct. The Bank team at that time saw greater opportunity in the institutional design of
poverty targeted programs and put its focus there, in addition to work on reforms in the banking sector.
As pointed out by the CAE, following 1997 government support for broad reforms faded. At this point
the Bank program focused on how to get the most poverty impact in ongoing and a limited number of
new projects. Although there was no low case specified in the 1997 CAS, as the governance situation
deteriorated the Bank carried out a three-pronged approach: (i) decreased lending from around 500
million dollars per year in the first half of the nineties, to 255 million per year in FY98-99, to only 95
million in FYOO; (ii) a reduction in the number of active loans from 12 in 1997 to only 8 operations at the
end of the second Fujimori administration, all of which were focused on poverty alleviation; and (iii)
increased work with beneficiaries and NGOs, where the Bank played a leading role on a new way of
working on poverty alleviation.
Client Survey. Finally, a Client Survey 13 conducted for the Bank in Peru in March and April
68. 
2002 provides some rich insight into our role and effectiveness during the past five years (see Annex F).
In brief, it was found that respondents felt: (i) the Bank had led a more open approach to civil society and
become more socially oriented in its work; (ii) that while Bank staff brought important expertise and
international experience to bear on the work in Peru, there was insufficient communication to audiences
in Peru of policies and experiences; and (iii) that the Bank's strength lies in the preparation and design of
new projects, but that it is weak in ensuring that implementation goes well.
69. 
Application of lessons learned to current CAS. The current CAS builds on the results of these
evaluations. The CAS continues an emphasis on sector institutional reform and demand-driven poverty

reduction programs, through both investment and the continuation of the PSRLs. To address gaps in the
previous strategy, new emphasis is given to the areas of competitiveness and public sector management
through policy dialogue on corruption, decentralization and private participation in infrastructure; TALs
focusing on public sector management and competitiveness; and a series of programmatic loans (the
PGRLs). Focus on macro-economic and structural reform issues is built into the AAA, but is also directly
linked to the lending scenarios through the lending triggers. Finally, the results of the client survey will
be used to help reinforce efforts to improve portfolio performance, through the use of more rigorous
feedback mechanisms, including monitoring of project and broader development outcome indicators and
the involvement of client stakeholders such as a newly established indigenous advisory council to assess
portfolio performance.
C. 
Strategic Elements of the CAS
This CAS covers a period of 4 years, coinciding with the period of the Peruvian government
70. 
administration. During this period one progress report will be presented to the Board to update the
strategy presented here. The principal strategic elements of this CAS are:
support to policy and institutional reforms through a combination of AAA and technical
assistance loans (TALs), with programmatic loans in support of a reform program; priority
issues include public sector management and decentralization; addressing barriers to growth
and competitiveness; and continued work on the reform of social sectors;
financing investment programs that have a direct impact on the productive lives of the poor,
through a combination of rural and urban development programs, and financing to support
the institution of reforms in the social sectors;

* 

* 

* 

* 

a renewed focus on environmental issues especially as linked to health, sustainable use of
natural resources, and management of biodiversity; and
continued emphasis on partnerships with civil society, and to addressing inclusion within
Bank operations of specific groups such as youth, women, indigenous peoples, and Afro-
Peruvians.
71. 
This CAS presents a base case of an average of $230 million new investment lending per year,
which is estimated to result in approximately $175 million in annual disbursements (see Table 6 and
Annexes B3 and B9). During the 4 years of the CAS (FY03-06) this would include two sets of
programmatic loans, a range of investment loans focused on poverty alleviation, 4 technical assistance
loans, and a rich program of AAA. Depending on Peru's performance on identified program triggers,
lending may be limited to the investment program of approximately $130 million per year, with no
adjustment lending, in a low case, or the annual commitment might be increased to $300 to $400 million
per year in a high case. The triggers for moving from the base to a low or high case are discussed in
Section V, paras 111 to 114.
D. 
Selectivity and Donor Coordination
72. 
The strategy supported in this CAS has been developed through consultations with government,
external development assistance agencies, and other stakeholders. Workshops held with these groups
were used to select and prioritize the strategic areas and activities to be supported. Selectivity was sought
on the basis of: the relevance and importance of the area, the comparative advantage of WBG assistance
in that specific area, and the other activities already covered by other donors. This led to a decision to
limit the Bank's work to specific issues (public sector management, education, health and infrastructure)
and in certain cases to join in common projects, with the LADB, CAF and bilateral organizations.
73. 
Partnerships have been developed with other external development assistance organizations
active in Peru around specific program priorities. The most important of these have been with IADB
(especially in health, water, transport and the social fund, FONCODES and in the joint conduct of the

Peru Country Assistance Strategv 

20

Country Financial Accountability Assessment and the Public Expenditure Review), with the Andean
Development Corporation (CAF - on competitiveness issues), with UNDP (the Acuerdo Nacional), with
DFID (for civil society participation and govemance studies and programs), with the Government of the
Netherlands and Germany (protected areas), and with the Govermment of Japan (poverty reduction and
natural resources management in the sierra). The information regarding the areas of action of the multi-
lateral and bilateral organizations, and the NGOs, is presented in the Comprehensive Development
Framework matrix (Annex G) which is summarized below in Table 6. The IADB's program in Peru is
summarized in Box 3.
74. 
The Bank has also taken an active role in two well-established, multi-donor and NGO sector
groups for discussing experiences and developing common strategies: one for health and one for water
supply and sanitation. The existence of these groups, and the Bank's participation in them, has been a
key aspect of our work and the success this far in policy and program reforms in these sectors. Efforts
have been initiated recently to strengthen such inter-institutional collaboration in two additional areas,
competitiveness and public sector reform and decentralization, and these are expected to be significant
areas of collaboration during this CAS period.

Box 3. LADB's Program in Peru

During 1999-2001 the LADB approved 14 new projects in the following areas: roads improvement and rehabilitation; rural infrastructure and land
titling; reconstruction after 'El Niflo'; education (preschool, and secondary school); health (mother-child insurance); government financial
administration system (SLAF); credit to small businesses; emergency loan to assist with the 2001 earthquake; and three policy measures operations
to aid with fiscal and financial reforms. Overall the new total loan commitments during the 1998-2001 period were US$1.8 billion. In 2001, LADB
disbursed approximately US$380 million for project and policy lending.
IADB's program for the next five years (2002 through 2006) has three main components: (a) to create conditions to increase economic.
competitiveness and productivity; (b) to improve sodal policy effidency; and (c) to create a modern, decentralized and efficient state, at the
service of the people. IADB's new lending commitments for 2002 would amount to approximately US$724 million, out of which US$300 million
was the Social and Fiscal Institutional Reform Loan approved in June 2002. In 2003, IADB's lending would amount to approximately'USS 435.5
million, which is still above the historic yearly average of US$410 million.

Non-lending Services planned for the next 3 years are presented below in Table 7. The Bank
will monitor closely the Peruvian economy and complete policy notes and updates of Bank core economic
sector work. This includes a Development Policy Review in FY03-04 and follow-up on financial sector
issues from the Financial Sector Assessment (2001), including in conjunction with IFC corporate
restructuring issues which impact companies' access to credit. In response to requests from government,
the Bank will continue work on public debt management focusing on both institutional strengthening and
medium term debt issuance strategies. The Bank will be assisting Peru in getting ready for the expected
commercial integration of the Americas via the proposed Free Trade Agreement of the Americas (FTAA),
and managing the impact of the mining windfall expected in the next 5 years.
76. 
To expand the breadth of Bank focus on competitiveness and rural poverty reduction, a strategy
for the development of rural infrastructure will be completed by FY04, as a follow-up to the Rural
Development Strategy (June 2002). The focus of these two studies is on diagnosing the poverty and

The micro-economic constraints to growth study, already underway in FY02 in collaboration with
the Andean Development Corporation (CAF), includes a firm level survey of growth issues, and case
studies on financing, informality and labor policy. It is expected that results from this multi-year, in-
depth study will contribute to the preparation of the proposed Export Competitiveness and Trade
Facilitation project including related policy reforms. A Bank study, with input from the IFC, will analyze
the issues and options related to the social, fiscal and enviromnental factors affecting sustainable growth
in the mining and hydrocarbon sectors. To help inform and address questions on Peru's experience with
privatization and private sector participation models, a regional study is to be conducted, including
Bolivia, Ecuador and Peru.
78. 
A comprehensive Global Environment Facility (GEF) Investment Strategy for Peru has been
developed. Following that strategy, the Bank will focus on a limited number of new GEF projects for this
CAS period, including the proposed GEF component to the FY03 Lima Urban Transport project and a
FY03 Participatory Management of Protected Areas project. Approaches to streamline support to the
national protected areas system and manage global commons will be developed based on that strategy.
79. 
Lending Services (Table 8). While the Bank's lending program is spread through the three
strategic areas, most operations include support to institution building or decentralization of services.

Peru Country Assistance Stratesv 

23

Lending in the competitiveness area includes a TAL in FY03 as a first step of an Export Competitiveness
and Trade Facilitation lending program. The second step would be an investment loan to finance
infrastructure and support institutional development needed to facilitate export growth. 
In FY04 two
poverty targeted projects are proposed, the Sierra Rural Development Project and Lima Urban Transport
Project, both of which focus on addressing barriers for economic development for the poor, one in the
poorest rural areas and the other in the area of greatest concentration of the urban poor in the peri-urban
neighborhoods of Lima. The Sierra Rural Development Project will support the decentralization
program. The Regional Roads Decentralization Project expands work on the broad competitiveness
agenda, and will be prepared to support the institutional reforms underway in the sector and to provide
financing for the rehabilitation of key road links at the departmental level. In the later years, following
the completion of a multi-sector rural infrastructure strategy, the development and initiation of the next
generation of rural infrastructure investment would occur through a multi-sector rural infrastructure
project. Both the Regional Roads and Rural Infrastructure projects would be co-financed by IADB.
80. 
The Bank will also finance a series of programmatic loans, the Programmatic Reform for Growth
loans beginning in FY05, to support policy measures related to competitiveness and public sector
management. (See description of the PRGLs in the section on "institutionality," paras 89 to 92.)
IFC. Consistent with the above priorities, and as outlined in the WBG's private sector strategy
81. 
(see Annex C), IFC will continue to support sectors that provide the greatest benefit to the Peruvian
private sector: 
(i) the financial sector, with a particular emphasis on the housing sector, and exploring
facilities with banks or specialized financial institutions to aid in the restructuring of corporates; (ii)
infrastructure, to enhance competitiveness; (iii) direct investment in the real and service sectors (such as,
manufacturing, tourism, agribusiness, and the social sectors) to assist in corporate restructuring and
investment; and (iv) the natural resource sector, especially in the area of sustainable development:

Equity and Social Justice-providing all Peruvians with access to quality health, education, culture
and basic services
82. 
Non-lending Services in the "equity" area will focus on environmental health, youth and social
development, indigenous learning and knowledge exchange, major sector studies in health and education,

Peru Countrv Assistance Strategy 

24

and activities in the water and sanitation sector, including an assessment of strategies for private sector
participation. 
The two planned sector studies build on the substantial work already done in Peru:
Improving Health Care for the Poor (1999) and Peruvian Education at a Crossroads (2001) and will
provide the elements for the WBG lending strategy in health, education and social protection The
environmental health study will examine the areas of air and water pollution, solid wastes management,
and environmentally-related diseases in Peru. The analytical work on youth will focus on problems of
social exclusion of youth, related to education drop-out rates, health, crime and violence, and
employment. The AAA technical assistance on indigenous learning and knowledge exchange will
continue work initiated in FY02 in which indigenous organizations are disseminating their knowledge and
practices and learning from experiences in other countries.
83. 
Poverty-related AAA 
includes a- study of chronic malnutrition and a study of poverty
vulnerability of poor households followed by a poverty assessment in FY05. An assessment of pension
system restructuring options would focus on increasing social insurance coverage and making the
distribution of subsidized benefits more equitable. These studies complement sector work in health and
education. During FY03-04 a city poverty strategy (CPS) is being developed by the metropolitan
municipality of Lima, with focus on several of the poorest district municipalities.
84. 
In addition to the assessment of strategies for private sector participation in water and sanitation,
Bank operations, the Bank's Andean Regional Program for Water and Sanitation, and bilateral donors
will continue work on institutional issues in the sector. Activities led by the Andean Regional Program
during the CAS period will include: 
(i) support for the activities of the Peru water and sanitation
coordination group, involving government, NGOs and donors in addressing issues of sector strategy,
including the development of sector regulations and new sector programs; (ii) piloting, studying and
promoting approaches for managing water systems and expansion of water and sanitation services in
small cities and poor, peri-urban communities; and (iii) design of improved strategies for hygiene
promotion.
85. 
Lending Services. Lending in the social sectors is an important element of the Bank's program,
and will focus on developing and implementing needed institutional reforms combined with increasing
investment for poverty-targeted programs. Government is already implementing an arnbitious agenda of
reform in health, education and social protection supported through the Prograrnmatic Social Reform
Loan (PSRL) I, and the ongoing Education project and Health APL. The PSRL I, which was approved in
FY01, included measures to safeguard social expenditures beneficial to the poor during a difficult fiscal
adjustment period in Peru. It also laid the groundwork for strengthening of public sector institutions,
including rationalizing social programs, building of transparent system of resource allocation, and
increasing access of the poor to higher quality basic health and education.
86. 
During the CAS period, support for reform in health and education will be continued through the
PSRL II and IH, the new Rural Education Project APL. In the later years covered by the CAS support to
these sectors would be continued depending on achievement of health and education APL benchmarks.
Overall the strategy being supported in the PSRLs and the sector APLs is to enable the government in the
next four years to:

* 

* 

Improve access of the poor to basic human capital investments and adequate coverage for
shocks, by increasing social spending and reducing the economic and cultural barriers that
hinder effective delivery of these services;

Improve the targeting, efficiency and transparency of public social expenditure in order to
provide better quality basic social services to the poor;

* Minimize the risks of the most vulnerable groups through a definition of adequate social
assistance instruments and modernization of social insurance institutions;

Peru Country Assistance Strategv 

25

* 

In health, design and implement a second generation reform such as the expansion of health
insurance, strengthening of management contracts for health provision, modernization of
ESSALUD (government managed health insurance program), providing incentives for
public-private purchase of health services, and establishing adequate responses to re-
emerging and new public health problems; and

* 

In education, policy reforms regarding teaching career and system management, focused on:
(i) developing a quality teaching force through merit based promotion and ensuring
deployment of quality teachers to rural areas; and (ii) system management improvements,
including increasing school autonomy while strengthening accountability for results, with
investments directed to improving quality for primary and pre-school levels, bilingual
education, and distance education at the secondary level.
87. 
To support this policy agenda, PSRL II & III would support deepening of reforms in the social
sectors, including policies and actions leading to greater decentralization of services, and expansion of
processes of citizen oversight and participation in development planning. The Social Reform technical
assistance loan (TAL) in FY03 will complement PSRL II by assisting the government to define the details
of its medium-term poverty reduction strategy, to re-engineer the unified social programs and to
implement other key social sector policies.
88. 
The Rural Water Supply and Sanitation project will be presented to the Board on August 29,
2002, and would finance rehabilitation and expansion of existing rural systems, using demand-driven
approaches involving co-financing from communities and municipalities, and user participation in all
phases of the preparation and implementation of individual investments.
Institutionality-democracy and rule of law and an efficient, transparent and decentralized state
89. 
Non-lending Services will provide diagnostic work and policy advice regarding institutional
reforms and decentralization. This will be done through the dissemination and discussion of the Public
Expenditure Review completed in FY02, combined with a more detailed study of subnational fiscal
policy and management 
in FY03-04, including follow-up of issues identified in the Institutional
Governance Review and decentralization policy work done in 2001-2002. A study of pension system
restructuring will provide options for increasing returns in the private pension system, reducing the fiscal
burden of the public system, and making the distribution of subsidized benefits more equitable. As part
of these efforts, the Bank will continue to contribute to the public sector reform and institutional
development agenda through outreach activities, including public workshops. Policy notes on public
sector management 
issues are planned as a way to review the progress and outcomes 
in the
decentralization and reform process that is underway at present. Continued work on anti-corruption will
include the participation of the World Bank Institute. Efforts in the "institutionality" area will be done in
coordination and in some cases direct collaboration with the IADB and the IMF, which are engaged in
related areas, including tax and fiscal policy and civil service reform.
90. 
Lending Services. Many of the lending operations described in the "competitiveness" and
"equity" areas contain 
important elements of institutional reform, 
including decentralization and
personnel systems reforms as essential elements of their strategies. In addition to those sector investment
operations and the institutional reform-focused PSRL II and m, public sector reform and decentralization
issues will also be tackled through: 
(i) a series of Programmatic Reform for Growth loans (PRGL),
beginning in FY05, (ii) the Decentralization and Municipal Development Technical Assistance Loan; (iii)
the Justice Services Modernization Project; and (iv) the Second Urban Property Rights Project.
91. 
The Decentralization and Municipal Development Technical Assistance Loan will focus on two
areas of institutional development: 
(i) strengthening the process of decentralization, addressing policy
and administrative issues important to the accountable decentralization of services and the institution of
related fiscal decentralization mechanisms; and (ii) providing assistance to municipalities to strengthen

Peru Country Assistance Strateay 

26

management capacity to undertake their new roles. The Justice Services Modernization Project will
address justice reform, focusing on improving performance and enhancing access of the poor to judicial
services. Among other things, the project will support the establishment of decentralized judicial
districts. The Second Urban Property Rights Project will support adoption of a modern legal framework
for a unified registry and cadaster system at the national level, under the leadership of the National
Superintendency of Public Registries.
92. 
As currently conceived, 
the PRGLs would focus on fostering private sector growth and
development of Peru's exports by institutional reforms in the financial and banking sectors and other
institutional and regulatory areas affecting competitiveness. The PRGL would therefore likely include
actions conducive to (i) strengthen supervision of and eliminate efficiencies in the financial sector aiming
at reducing the cost of credit; (ii) strengthened financial oversight of corporations and debt restructuring;
(iii) increasing productivity of infrastructure, for example, by reducing the cost of transport and
improving ports operations; and (iv) improve inter-governmental fiscal relations and 
local government
public sector management

F. 
Managing the Existing Portfolio
93. 
After significant improvement in performance since the 1997 CAS, Peru's portfolio quality has
remained mostly constant over the last year. 
.At the end of FY00, Peru achieved or surpassed most
portfolio performance indicators included in the 1997 CAS, as summarized in Table 9. Since then, it has
performed relatively well. Peru's portfolio currently comprises 9 projects for a total net commitment of
US$426 million, of which US$147 million is to be disbursed. As of end-FY02, the portfolio had only one
project rated as unsatisfactory, representing only 1.2 percent of total commitments. 
In addition, the
disbursement ratio stood at 23.8 percent, above the Region's average and the 1997 CAS target.
Proactivity and effectiveness delay indicators also improved. While the target for increasing proactivity
was fully met, and the targeted reduction in effectiveness delay was not met; the six month average
effectiveness delay in FY01 was due in part to difficulties created by the several transitions in national
administrations. The realism index was 100% and the proactivity index 100%.
94. 
The improvement in the portfolio since 1997 can be attributed to the concerted effort on the part
of the government and the Bank to assure readiness for implementation, increased priority to project
supervision and more frequent portfolio reviews over the last 3 years to detect both generic and project
specific problems. A review of the portfolio assessed the extent to which each project addresses issues of
beneficiary empowerment and provide recommendations for improvement. As a result of this study
actions have been taken in several projects, most notably the Irrigation Rehabilitation Project where the
participation of water user organization in the project was given greater attention. This allowed a long
standing problem project to turn around and start achieving its development objectives. A portfolio
review focusing on indigenous issues is now being undertaken, with the participation of an Indigenous
Advisory Committee, including membership from all major indigenous peoples, that has been formed
specifically to assist the Bank.

Currently all loans in the Peru portfolio are focused on poverty alleviation, as shown by the
development objectives of the eight investment and one GEF operation under implementation:
* Health Sector Reform: Help increase access of the poor to better quality health program;

* Rural Roads 11: Increase the access and improve the quality of roads in poor rural areas;

* Lima Water Rehabilitation and Management: Expand services, including those to the urban
poor in the shanty towns;

* Urban Property Rights: Provide formal rights to property in predominately poor settlements
in urban areas;

96. 
The overall assessment of risk of the Peru portfolio is average. Although the main negative
factors that affected portfolio performance 
last year, namely the economic slow down and three
government transitions, are now surpassed, the risk of continued fiscal adjustment through expenditure
cuts still persists. Therefore, lack of counterpart funds in the next fiscal year could become a factor that
slows down disbursements and project implementation.
97. 
Overall IFC's portfolio in Peru has performed about the same as the IFC average. Half of EFC's
approvals during the last CAS period were in the agribusiness sector. However, the performance of EFC's
projects in this sector has been mixed. While the agribusiness sector has traditionally been a higher risk
sector, IFC's Peruvian agribusiness projects were adversely affected by several Peru specific factors. At a
macro level, the higher value-added food processing businesses were adversely affected by the slow down
in the economy and subsequent drop in disposable incomes that resulted in declining demand. At the firm
level, the lack of local industry-specific knowledge which had dissipated over a long period of state
control (especially in the sugar industry) and corporate governance issues have resulted in some poorly
performing projects.
G. 
Fiduciary Issues: Procurement and Financial Management
98. 
Procurement. 
In September 2001, the new Government and the Bank agreed on a Country
Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR), which outlined the strengths and weaknesses of the public
contracting system and contained an action plan for improvements. As described in the CPAR, the
current legal code establishes important elements of the institutional framework including a national

Peru Country Assistance Strate=v 

28

regulatory body (CONSUCODE - the General Procurement Council) and a national arbitration system for
resolution of appeals and disputes. However, some provisions of the law and regulations are in conflict
with internationally accepted procurement standards and practices. As a part of the CPAR action plan,
the Bank and the government of Peru have agreed to work together to review these provisions and
regulations and develop needed changes.
99. 
The CPAR assessed the overall risk of the Peru portfolio as average. Main factors identified as
negatively affecting portfolio performance are the lack of effective tools for procurement planning and
monitoring during project implementation; the lack of skilled and capable procurement staff within
projects; and the lack of local standard bidding documents for procurement of goods, works and selection
of consultants. Specific actions to address these issues were agreed with the Government and reflected in
the CPAR action plan. CONSUCODE has been supportive of these initiatives and agreed to carry them
out as part of the implementation of the CPAR's Action Plan for improvement of the national public
contracting system.
100. 
In order to strengthen oversight of public contracting, the Contraloria General de la Repuiblica
(CGR) and CONSUCODE signed an Institutional Agreement for the implementation of control and
supervision of procurement and contracting procedures. Steps are being taken to prepare guidelines and
control procedures, as well as issue an administrative decree to put into effect needed regulations, as
agreed within the CPAR.
101. Government has also initiated the development of an "e-purchase" system for procurement of
minor goods and services in the public sector together with the use of a web page for advertisement of bid
opportunities, bidding documents, contract award and appeal resolutions. Gradual incorporation of a total
of 100 government agencies as users of the e-purchase system and 600 agencies to the official web page
for bid advertisement is planned.
102. 
Financial Management. The fiduciary assessment conducted for the CAS was based on the
diagnostic work done for the Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) conducted in 2001.
It addresses both the financial management arrangements 
for project 
implementation and 
the
government's overall public expenditure management system. 
Investment lending operations in Peru
have a good record in complying with WBG fiduciary requirements. This is attributed to: (i) generally
well qualified staff in the financial management area and relatively low rotation of this staff; (ii)
availability of well qualified private audit firms to perform the annual audit; and (iii) oversight provided
by the CGR.
103. 
The central government's integrated financial management system (SIAF) is being used for the
management of some of the Bank financed projects, and its extension to all projects should bring out
more timely closings and remove the risk of loss of records in the implementing agencies. Overall,
supervision and control of use of project funds is good; findings from external auditors indicate very low
incidence of funds misuse.
104. 
The PSRL is making a significant contribution to strengthening financial accountability generally
in the central government. This would be followed up in the high case in follow-up programmatic
operations. Steps to strengthen the system and initiate an anti-corruption program are included as triggers
of these operations and are contained in an action plan agreed to by government as part of the CFAA.
While the CFAA points to the overall strength of the central government's financial management
framework and institutional capacity, significant risk to the proper and approved use of funds would occur
if: (i) the SIAF system and oversight by the CGR and the legislature were not extended to all ministries;
(ii) use of secret and emergency decrees to by-pass legislative control over the budget continued; (iii)
prosecution remained ineffective for malfeasance; and (iv) an anti-corruption program to address areas of
abuse was not initiated.

Peru Countrv Assistance Strategy 

29

105. While sub-national government fiduciary arrangements were not addressed in the CFAA, there is
evidence from a review of municipal audits, of a general weakness of controls. WBG funding would
share the same risk as all funds disbursed through municipalities.
106. 
The financial accountability assessment concluded that Congressional oversight of the use of
public funds and the effective independence of the National Audit Organization (CGR) are indispensable
elements of the fiduciary framework. Steps to strengthen these roles were built into the policy framework
of the PSRL as well as the steps needed to extend the Central Government's integrated financial
management system.
107. While the installation of SIAF at the municipal level will be supported by an IADB financed
project, training would be needed in the application of the SIAF and in financial management in general.
These activities would be included in the proposed Decentralization and Municipal Development TAL.
In addition to the extension of the SIAF, the WBG will continue to focus on the development of an anti-
corruption program and the improvement of prosecution for malfeasance since these weaknesses
undermine more general attempts to improve governance.

V. PROSPECTS FOR POVERTY REDUCTION

A. 
Macro-economic Scenario
108. 
Economic recovery for Peru is slow and the medium term outlook is uncertain. Peru is one
of the countries with the highest growth potential in the region. Drivers of Peru's recovery include an
increased mining production from the new Antamina project and new investment in other mining projects
and the recent approval by the U.S. Congress of the Andean Trade Preference Act (ATPA) -- which
allows a range of products into the United States at zero tariffs.
109. 
Preserving a sound economic and social program, and promoting consensus on reforms and their
implementation through the National Dialogue are expected to sustain high growth rates and low
inflation. This scenario projects annual GDP growth rates in the 3.0-4.0 percent range and annual
inflation rates in the 1.5-2.5 percent range for 2002 onwards (Table 5, page 7). While the NFPS deficit is
expected to improve from 2.5 percent of GDP in 2001 to 1.3 percent of GDP in 2005, the external current
account deficit is expected to remain inside the 2.3-2.5 percent of GDP range during 2002-05.
110. Domestic or external shocks, however, may bring significant uncertainty to this scenario. Shocks
might include: 
lack of privatization receipts given opposition to the privatization program, limited tax
reform, 
the realization of contingent liabilities, lower than projected intemational commodity prices, a
slow and prolonged global economic recovery, and limited external financing due to potential financial
contagion from a regional crisis. The WBG strategy, focused on creating the conditions for accelerated
growth, employment generation, poverty reduction and improved well being of the poor, is a key element
to support the govemment to address the effects of these risks.

B. 
Lending Program and Program Triggers
111. 
The Bank's program is designed to support the govemment's strategy to achieve competitiveness,
social equity, and strengthen institutions. 
In the base case, presented in Annex B3, Bank support is
undertaken through a lending program of approximately $230 million per year, split between investment
operations and programmatic adjustment loans. Specifically, the Bank would finance: 
(i) a range of
poverty-targeted investment loans, including education and health, urban and rural development, and
infrastructure; (ii) four TALs addressing reform 
in social sector programs and citizen participation,
competitiveness, justice, and decentralization and municipal development; and (iii) programmatic loans
that would support reform of social sector institutions and in citizen participation and transparency
(PRSLs II and III) and a program of reforms to improve competitiveness and strengthen decentralization
and public sector management (the PRGLs). In the base case annual disbursements are estimated to be

Peru Countrv Assistance Strategv 

30

approximately $170 million per year. The base case would require that: (i) the tax revenue to GDP ratio
be maintained at least within the range of 11.9-12.5%; (ii) the macroeconomic framework is acceptable-to
the Bank; and (iii) there is satisfactory portfolio performance (see Tables 10 and 11). This program may
be revised during the CAS period if Peru experiences a very large exogenous shock.
112. 
The Bank program would fall to a low case scenario, in which there would be no programmatic,
adjustment lending, and annual new investment lending would be limited to an average of $130 million
per year, if there were: 
(i) reversals in key fiscal or other key policy reforms; (ii) a reduction of tax
revenues to below 11.9% of GDP; (iii) lack of progress in increasing public sector transparency and use
of non-poverty criteria for targeting programs; or (iv) unsatisfactory portfolio performance as defined as
the disbursement ratio falling below 20% or percentage of total commitments in problem projects
reaching 20%.

113. 
The lending scenario could move to a high case of around $300-400 million annual lending, with
approximately one-half investment and one-half programmatic or adjustment lending, if the following
additional triggers are achieved: (i) a fiscal policy and management strategy is in place that is conducive
to increasing debt sustainability in the medium term and a tax revenue/GDP ratio higher than 12.5 percent
reaching 1998 levels by 2006; and (ii) successful launching of a package of policy and institutional
reforms addressing issues of reform of state institutions, decentralization policies that incorporate fiscal
and debt sustainability, and actions to increase private sector competitiveness. The fiscal policy and
management strategy should include a public debt profile free of maturity, service payment bunching,
and solvency vulnerabilities, and well functioning debt management office.

114. 
Conditions for a high case would be met if progress were shown in the development agenda in
each of the following areas:
* Actions to reform state institutions that would achieve significant progress increasing the
efficiency of state institutions. Expected actions include a single registry of all public
servants; measures 
to streamline and standardize pay and benefits and employment
arrangements; and merging of nutrition and rural infrastructure programs.
* Decentralization policies that incorporate fiscal and debt sustainability. This includes an
institutional framework with clear assignment of functions and resources to regional and
municipal governments, consistent with fiscal and debt sustainability and efficient delivery of
public services. Steps in this direction include decentralization measures that avoid giving
regional governments more resources than they need for the functions they will be given or
conversely too many responsibilities without adequate funding. Other areas that need to be
addressed include: 
(i) the management of subnational debt; (ii) an institutional framework
and capacity development that provide local governments opportunity to raise their own
revenues; and (iii) increased 
transparency, accountability; and citizen participation 
in
governance processes at local levels.
* Action to increase private sector competitiveness. During the next 5 years progress
should be achieved 
in: 
(i) increasing efficiency of the ports via modernization and
investment; (ii) improving the efficiency in processing the import and export of goods
through borders, as measured by reduction of nontrade barriers and reduction of time
required; and (iii) improving the efficiency of procedures used for resolving corporate
indebtedness. Finally during this time it is important that the structure of tariffs and corporate
taxes not be distorted by any additional actions to protect selected industries or provide
selective exonerations.

C. 
Monitoring and Evaluation of the CAS
115. 
The benchmark indicators for this CAS include the indicators identified by government for its
poverty reduction program (see Table 4, page 5) in addition to other, intermediary benchmark indicators
related specific Bank financed operations. See Annex B9 for a complete list of these indicators. The
monitoring and evaluation of progress of the CAS will encompass four main activities:
* 
review of the status of benchmark indicators, both general and specific, on an annual basis
with government and representatives of civil society, as well as other international
development assistance organizations;
* monitoring of the portfolio status through semi-annual CPPRs with government and through
annual CPPRs with the Indigenous Peoples Advisory Council;

Peru Countrv Assistance Strateey 

32

* 

review of the CAS strategy and of the status of the CAS triggers as a central part of the
annual program lending review process with government; and

* 

country team meetings focusing on assessing progress.

D. 
Exposure and Risks
116. 
External debt service to the Bank as a proportion of external public debt service is projected to
start decreasing in 2003 reaching 15.5 percent in 2004 from an estimated 16.2 percent in 2001. Preferred
creditor debt service to external public debt service is projected to rise to 40.9 from 39.4 (Annex B7).
Peru's large share of multilateral and bilateral creditors makes it less vulnerable to a short term debt-led
crisis. Nevertheless, Peru's current debt situation calls for continuous monitoring. The Bank's assistance
program aims at promoting conditions for sustained high growth, that in turn should yield an improved
debt situation. Recent attempts to restructure public debt and strengthen debt management will increase
Peru's capacity to manage its debt.
117. As discussed, medium term prospects for Peru are uncertain. Peru currently enjoys international
credibility and recent real GDP data suggest that unless a major shock hits Peru, projected GDP growth
rates in the range of 3 to 4 percent could be achieved during the duration of the proposed CAS. The fall in
growth rates in the second half of the 1990s reflects the end of the rebound effects that at least in part
drove high economic growth immediately following the end of Sendero Luminoso activities. Therefore,
the mere restoration of political normalcy and the non-occurrence of the exogenous shocks of the late
1 990s might not suffice to achieve growth rates above 5 percent again.
118. 
Systemic risk in the financial sector appears to be limited. Peru's major vulnerabilities are its
foreign currency debt and political conflict that makes it difficult to achieve a unified voice regarding a
strategy to restore growth. Success of the large number, variety and complexity of projected reforms
requires strong 
institutional 
leadership, as well as high coordination and domestic capacity
implementation of social agencies. Uncertainty about the ability of the government to carry out its
strategy and sustain a credible economic program could lead to a wait-and-see attitude from investors
which would, in turn, hinder growth, leaving the economy vulnerable to the vagaries of international
investors and commodity price volatility. The support of civil society institutions and of the international
financial institutions will be instrumental in mitigating these risks, so as to promote a common-shared
vision in the medium-term. The National Agreement signed in July 2002 is an important step towards a
shared vision for growth.
119. 
Regarding Peru's fiscal risk, the potential inability of the government to raise tax revenues or to
complete its projected privatization program would reduce the financing for a sustained social policy. To
mitigate such risk, the government and Congress are working to agree on the implementation of the
necessary policy measures needed for an effective fiscal adjustment and a financially sound state reform
and decentralization process. Central Bank yielding to pressure to inject liquidity and thus stimulate
lending with the expectation of quicker economic recovery is also a risk. This may lead to loss of
international reserves, and hence solvency problems, in the present environment of economic uncertainty.
120. 
If a shock hits Peru, rapid recovery might be delayed by the effects on the financial sector. A
prolonged slowdown of the global economy, adverse regional developments or unexpected shocks in the
international capital markets could lead to a significant fall in external demand for Peruvian exports, or in
mineral prices and/or to private capital outflows. This could reduce exports dynamism and growth,
destabilize the domestic currency, put strong pressure on both the public and the corporate sector which
are heavily indebted in foreign currency, and impose additional stress on the banking sector. A slow
resolution of the region's current financial turmoil may both discourage foreign direct investment and
lead to a credit crunch, if international banks reduced their banking activities in Peru. To mitigate these
risks, Peruvian authorities have been building a contingent financing plan, combining efforts to increase

Peru Country Assistance Strategy 

33

multilateral and bilateral financing, access international capital markets by placing sovereign bonds, and
gradually proceed with plans for privatization and concessions.

VI. Concluding Remarks

121. 
The Bank Group program contains a package of interventions that rely on the Bank's comparative
advantage 
in supporting 
institutional reforms 
in social, infrastructure and productive development
programns 
serving 
the poor combined with policy reform affecting private sector growth and
competitiveness. Annual lending would remain at roughly its current level but with greater emphasis
given to policy content and--institutional reform The Bank is cognizant, however, of the risks associated
with this strategy given the vulierabilities in the government's fiscal situation, and therefore has proposed
clear triggers for moving to a lower lending scenario if fiscal imbalances worsen or if other key elements
of the public sector and competitiveness reform agenda do not advance. Conversely, faster than expected
progress on the fiscal and reform front may lead to increased lending above current level.

conditions stable but 
vulnerabilities exist due 
to high levels of public 
and private sector debt 

Over-indebtedness of 
private sector and 
inefficiency of 
bankruptcy restructuring 
procedures. 

Relatively high logistical 
and administrative costs 
to exporters compared to 
other countries in region. 

Fiscal and financial sector policies 
(i) maintain macro-economic 
stability by improving fiscal 
balances; (ii) increase fiscal 
revenues by eliminating 
exemptions and increasing 
collection efficiency; (iii) 
strengthening of debt management

Peru: Private Sector Strategy

I. Introduction

1. 
Private sector development. This Private Sector Strategy (PSS) forms an integral part
of the WBG's approach to Peru's development and poverty reduction. As noted in the CAS,
growth is an essential (but not sufficient) condition for poverty reduction. The costs of lagged or
negative growth could be substantial to the poor, as can be seen from the increase in poverty over
the past several years in Peru, as the economy slowed. At the beginning of the 1990s poverty was
about 57 percent of the population but had dropped to 47.7 percent by 1997 after several years of
rapid growth; however after 1997, slower growth' allowed the poverty rate to creep back up to
54.8 percent as at end of 2001.

2. 
The first priority for Peru is therefore to achieve and maintain macroeconomic and
political stability as well as improve its recently deteriorating investment environment. These
over-arching macro issues are critical to encourage the reactivation of private investment. The
private sector is the main engine for growth in Peru with gross domestic fixed investment by the
private sector being almost four times that of the public sector in 2000. The rapid growth of the
economy in the 1990s (up to 1997) was due in part to a program of reform that encouraged
private investment. Private investment grew from 12.9 percent of GDP in 1990 to 19.6 percent in
1997 in tandem with GDP growth (averaging 4.6 percent) over the period. However with the
slow down of reforms after 1997 coupled with increasing political uncertainty, private investment
fell to 17 percent of GDP in 2000. Apart from ensuring economic and political stability, Peru is
also faced with a range of micro issues that need to be addressed so as to reactivate and sustain
private investment for broad-based, long-term growth. These issues encompass a number of
critical areas and require a coherent approach by the WBG. This PSS expands on the summary
discussion in the main text of the CAS of these issues and outlines the WBG's strategy to address
them.

3. 
The slowed growth since 1998 has highlighted problems in the real and financial sectors
that were hidden by the previous economic boom. While there were external events (El Nifo, fall
in commodity prices etc.) that affected the economy, internal political instability and a slowdown
of the reform program amplified the effects of the external factors. As a result, Foreign Direct
Investrnent (FDI) fell sharply to US$681 million in 2001 from US$2.0 billion in 2000. There
were bank failures and a contraction in lending. High corporate leverage became unsustainable
requiring on-going restructuring of the corporate balance sheets. There were the occasional
bright spots in the traditional resource industries of mining and hydrocarbons, with the large
copper-zinc Antamina mine coming on stream in 20012 and the recently discovered Camisea gas
field expected to further add to export earnings. However, while these projects will help the
fiscal and foreign exchange positions of the country, they are hardly sufficient to address broad-
based growth, an equitable sharing of growth and hence poverty reduction. To make growth
more broad based and set the stage to manage any future external shocks, Peru will have to
address the following issues:

(i) Access to financing - more evenly distributed access to investment financing;

lGDP per capita grew at an average annual rate of 4.3 percent between 1994 and 1997. However between 1997 and

2001 this had fallen to -0.77 percent.

2 Output from which is estimated at 1.5 percent of GDP and is expected to account for a substantial share of 2002's
growth.

Annex C
Page 2 of 22

(ii) The corporate sector -
supporting corporate restructuring and investment to
enhance competitiveness and broad-based development especially 
in non-
traditional businesses;
Infrastructure for enhancing competitiveness and to promote growth outside the
Lima and its immediate surrounding areas; and
(iv) Ensure that resource based and other industries and services are on a sustainable
growth path.

(iii) 

4. 
This PSS is organized as follows. Section II provides a general overview of the Peruvian
private sector and a diagnosis of the principal private sector development issues. Section III
details the WBG's strategy in response to these issues.

II. Private Sector Development Priorities

FINANCIAL SECTOR

5. 
A well functioning financial sector is an essential element for broad based and sustained
growth of the private sector. 
In Peru the sector is dominated by the commercial banks which
account for over two thirds of all financial system assets indicating the underdevelopment of
other types of institutions, especially credit providing ones. Credit to the private sector has fallen
in the recent past and high corporate leverage (especially in SMEs) is constraining access to
credit. The following is a snapshot of the major components of the sector and areas for
improvement.

6. 
Banking sector. This sector has experienced significant changes over the latter half of
the 1990s. The slow down in the economy and the reduction of external credit lines to Peruvian
banks as a result of a series of emerging market crises, and the subsequent contraction of credit
resulted in the deterioration of banks' loans made during the previous expansion of the economy.
There was more than a doubling of past due, refinanced and restructured loans which currently
stand at about 16 percent of banks' portfolio. Provisioning increased sharply and banks'
profitability fell due to rising provisions and loan losses. These stresses resulted in government
intervention in some banks, bank closures and a consolidation amongst the rest. From the 25
banks that were present as of December 1997 there currently remains 15. Seventy-five percent of
assets are held by the 4 largest banks, possibly indicating the potential for further consolidation.
Along with the consolidation of the banking system has been the increasing presence of foreign
banks3 . From December 1996 to December 2000 there was a four fold increase to 40 percent in
the share of total bank assets held by foreign banks.

7. 
During this time of bank restructuring, credit to the private sector fell from 27 percent of
GDP in 1998 to 24 percent in 2001. Over this period, the system's liquidity4 increased by about
20 percent; there was a drop in local currency lending rates from about 33 percent to 23 percent;
and capital adequacy ratio rose 8.7 percent to an estimated 10 percent (See Figures 1, 2 & 3).
This would normally auger well for a reactivation of credit; however, credit to the private sector
has declined over the period as shown in Figure 4. There are several factors which continue to
limit credit growth: (i) a more cautious approach to lending to less credit worthy clients (in part,
due to high corporate leverage) amongst the banks' traditional corporate clients which account for
78.8 percent of their assets as at June 30, 2001 (down from 87 percent as at end 1997); (ii)
continued concerns regarding the timeliness and reliability of the legal and judicial framework for

8. 
Bond Markets. Peru's bond market is dominated by public debt and is relatively small
with trading volumes of debt instruments being about US$1.7 billion or about 3.1 percent of GDP
in 2001. Given the contraction of the economy, the number of private sector bond issuances fell
from 14 (for a total of US$182 million, an average size of US$13 million) in 1995 to just 3 in
2001 (for a total of US$75 million, an average size of US$25 million); the increase in average
issuance size is an indication that only a handful of larger companies are currently being able to
access the market.

9. 
Nearly all issuances are either in US dollar or in dollar-linked bonds as the high nominal
interest rates on long-term NSoles denominated bonds are unattractive to corporate issuers. Bond
buyers are likely to consider the high-interest NSoles bonds risky because of possible liquidity
problems they may generate for the borrower and uncertain devaluation risk (brought on in part
due to fiscal and political uncertainties) for which they would not be compensated by the interest
rate differential between the NSoles and US dollar issuances. On the other hand, buyers are
likely to be concerned about the risks of dollar bonds issued by sellers without dollar earnings.
All these further restrict the domestic bond market to the few enterprises that can credibly issue
low-risk, dollar bonds.

10. 
As- indicated above, while 2001 trading volume is relatively low, it is up about two and
half times the 2000 figure probably due in part due to the secondary trading of the about US$1.6
billion of public debt issued in 2001 (up from US$1.1 billion issued in 2001). The increase in
public debt issuances is, in part, reflective of the government's plan to build a benchmark local
currency yield curve. If the government is successful in building a NSoles yield curve, it should
greatly assist private sector bond issuers and investors by encouraging a greater comfort level
resulting in reduced spreads between US dollar and NSoles issuances. However, a necessary
precondition for this to occur is macro economic and political stability. Also a balance needs to
be achieved so as to prevent the "crowding out" of the private sector access to funding.

11. 
Equity Markets. Peru's stock market, with a capitalization of about 20 percent of GDP,
is relatively small compared to other countries (see Figure 5). As the economy worsened, trading
volume fell a dramatic 75 percent from US$12 billion in 1997 to US$3.0 billion in 2001. The
number of listed shares also fell from 303 in 1998 to 267 in 2001 and the number of new
issuances from 4 in 1996 to 1 in 2001 (there were no issuances in 1999 and 2000). For the
market to act as a source of capital, additional improvements should be made in market

Annex C

infrastructure and clearance and settlement procedures so as to help reduce trading costs and
increase transparency. However the required investment will not be made until participants/
investors foresee increased trading volume to justify the investment. Given their current high
leverage, methodologies to improve the capitalization of SMEs also need to be explored.

Housing Finance. The government has made it a priority to provide affordable housing.
Increased housing activity will stimulate construction activity, reduce unemployment and provide
a significant boost to the local economy. A study commissioned by the IFC indicates that there is
a large potential demand for affordable housing. The increase in outstanding mortgages is a
reflection of this. From a low base of US$92 million in 1996 there has been a 14-fold increase to
about US$1.3 billion as at end of 2001. However this is still low compared to Latin America as
seen from the following Figure 6.

13. 

The main reasons for the mortgage market's low level of development include:

* The dominant banks target only the high-income population, since these are the very
best credits, the ones easiest to underwrite and service, and the ones with the highest
risk/return tradeoff;
* The internal policies of the banks require an average family net income of about
US$1,300 a month to qualify for a mortgage loan thereby excluding about 82 percent
of Peruvians;
* Almost all mortgage credits outstanding are denominated 
in US dollars, thus
excluding a large portion of the population unable to withstand currency risk;
* Only recently, some banks have increased the term of their mortgage loans to 20-25
years. While this has made mortgages more affordable, the move to longer tenor has
come with reluctance by banks, due to the mismatch between loan and liability
maturities; and
* The lack of a stock of lower income housing.

14. 
Mortgage lenders (mainly the banks), primarily use the issuance of subordinate bonds,
savings deposits and foreign credit lines or direct foreign investment. None of these are in a
sufficient volume to meet existing demand and most do not provide the required tenor suitable for
long term mortgage lending. To facilitate growth in mortgage lending, lenders need access to
easy and cost effective sources of financing so that they can manage their maturity risks. This
can be achieved by the further development of secondary mortgage market mechanisms so that
lenders can sell their mortgages thereby freeing up resources for additional mortgage lending 5 .
However, to encourage greater use of these mechanisms and increase mortgage lending in
general, there needs to be : (i) standardization of mortgage documentation; (ii) harmonization of
the various rules regarding securitization; (iii) a more uniform tax treatment of mortgage backed
securities (vs. other issuances); (iv) better land titling; and (iv) a more flexible and streamlined
judicial process to foreclose on delinquent borrowers. To address the issue of the high degree of
dollarization of the mortgage market, the establishment of a NSoles government yield curve (as
mentioned in paragraph 13) would assist in the pricing of NSoles-denominate mortgage securities
thereby facilitating their origination and trading.

15. 
The government-related Mivivienda Fund, which has been in business for about four
years, has not been very active. This is in part due to the dearth of supply of housing in the
"affordable range" as explained above. Mivivienda now has about US$550 million in
uncommitted funds. A revamped Mivivienda that is focused on providing partial credit
guarantees for mortgage loans to middle-lower income borrowers (and eventually pool guarantees
to enable securitization of these loans) could spur the banking industry to grow down market.
These initiatives on the public sector side, combined with private sector efforts to organize and
coalesce the primary mortgage market, can stimulate construction lending, home building and,
eventually, capital markets activities.

16. 
Institutional investors. There are three main institutional investor groups in Peru, the
private pension system, the insurance companies and the mutual funds. Of these, the private
pension funds are the most substantial at US$3.6 billion or about 70 percent of the investment
portfolio of the institutional investors. However due to fairly restrictive investment limits and
lack of diversified issuances (limited government and corporate issuances), the pension funds and
insurance companies are exposed to the banking sector with about 40 percent of their investments

5 Banks can issue Instrumentos Hipotecarios, Letras Hipotecarias and use Titulo Hipotecario Negociable to securitize

mortgages thereby creating liquidity for additional mortgage lending.

in banking sector related products. This has created some vulnerability in the system and
possibly limited the growth of the bond and equity markets by reducing the impact of these
market players. This can be addressed, in part, by (i) a well defined program of government
issuances (to help build a benchmark yield curve); (ii) removing or lessening some of the
impediments to new issuances especially of mortgage backed securities which can have excellent
ripple effects; and (iii) increasing the limits for offshore investments to permit diversified
portfolios.

17. 
Micro Finance: Peru has one of the leading micro-finance industries in the world with 53
different entities and NGOs covering the sector. However, a large under-served market continues
to rely heavily upon informal finance. As of June 2000, loans to micro-enterprises and the rural
sector represented about 9 percent of borrowers and 2 percent of the total loan portfolio of
regulated banking system (this has risen to about 2.5 percent as at the end of 2001). The largest
lenders in this market segment are the commercial banks and one specialized micro-finance bank,
Mibanco (an IEC client) at about 33 percent market share, the Cajas Municipales de Ahorro y
Credito (CMACs) (27 percent), and the Financieras (16 percent). The CMACs and CRACs
(Cajas Rurales De Ahorro y Credito) have roughly one-half of their portfolios 
in micro-
enterprises. They, Mibanco and the EDPYMES lend heavily to the mostly urban micro-
enterprise sector, and are exposed to the shocks affecting that sector. The CMACs and CRACs
are excluded from Lima, which accounts for more than 50 percent of Peru's GDP. In spite of the
substantial growth of credit to micro-enterprises, only about 12 percent of the estimated 3.1
million micro-enterprises have access to formal credit. Credit access is hindered by an
inadequate 
institutional framework, 
including 
the mechanisms 
for obtaining titles 
(being
addressed by the Bank's Urban Property Rights loan), and for the pledging and execution and
realization of collateral.

CORPORATE SECTOR
18. 
As can be seen from Table 1, small and medium firmns have high leverage compared to
large corporates in Peru. This was, in part, as a result of a rapid and unsustainable credit
expansion during the high growth of the economy in the early- and mid-1990s. The subsequent
external and domestic shocks exposed the weaknesses of the loans made during this previous
boom. Depreciation of the NSol exacerbated the problem by increasing the cost of servicing
dollar loans of the many companies that did not have dollar earnings. The heavy use of dollar

credit continues and has even increased over the period from under three quarters of all loans

being made in dollars as at the end of 1995 to over four fifths as at the end of 2001; an indication
of continued vulnerability in some parts of the Peruvian corporate and banking sectors to external
shocks.

To ease judicial bottlenecks, which result from the increased volume of bank customer
defaults, INDECOPI 6 was given responsibility for providing alternative debtor/ creditor dispute
resolution mechanisms (including mediation, conciliation and arbitration) and a mandatory pre-
trial phase in conflicts. INDECOPI does not make decisions, but provides services to ensure the
transparency and effectiveness of the bankruptcy process, providing facilitating services to
creditors and debtors through a decentralized organizational structure. Although the process
provides for a de facto Chapter II-type process for reorganization of corporate debt, over 70
percent of the cases have resulted in an agreement to liquidate. Figure 7 below shows the
significant increase in demand for INDECOPI's services.

Given bank's high liquidity and improving capital adequacy ratio, the potential for the
reactivation of lending is good. However, while top tier firms have access to local credit, second-
tier firms and SMEs will have a much more difficult time, especially given their high leverage.
The following measures could help promote re-activation of credit:

-

corporate governance and management through regulatory measures, business

Encouraging additional equity participation (possibly through private equity

issues mentioned in the point above; and
Transferring methodologies and credit culture that foster profitable SME lending,
through credit lines from international institutions and through the creation of
specialized non-bank financial institutions.

21. 
Recently diagnostics point to the lack of competitiveness of Peruvian corporate sector by
international standards reflected in continued, comparatively low export levels. According to the

6 INDECOPI - Instituto Nacional de Defensa de la Competencia y de la Protecci6n de la Propiedad Intelectual was
created in 1992 with a mandate for the promotion of fair and open market competition, protection of intellectual
property rights, consumer protection, and corporate restructuring. The law governing INDECOPI was modified in
1996, 1999, and 2000 to strengthen INDECOPI's dispute resolution mechanisms related to debt disputes.

World Trade Organization, the world's average per capita export is US$1,051 while that of Peru
is at US$268. Peru lags behind all other Andean countries and far behind two of the most
important models in trade matters in the region: Mexico and Chile, which exports per capita are
US$ 1,487 and US$ 1,229 respectively (see Figure 8). Peru has currently an export to GDP ratio
of 16.35%, which is much lower than that of neighboring countries such as Chile (36.43%),
Ecuador (34.11%) or Bolivia (18.34%). The structure of its exports remains concentrated in low
value-added primary products and has not changed significantly over the years either by sector or
industry (see Figure 9 for 2001 exports). Surprisingly, Peru is lagging in areas for which it can be
expected to have a natural comparative advantage--given the quality of the soil and the Peruvian
microclimates. As one example, Peru fruit exports are about US$40 million, while Ecuador is
US$800 million and Chile US$1.3 billion. Manufacturing exports represented in 2000 about 21%
of total exports. This represented a modest rise by 3.1% compared to 1991, contrast to an
increase from 17.9% to 58.3% for the whole LAC region.

A new study prepared by the Bank in 2001 indicates that the key factors behind this lack
of competitiveness of Peru are: (i) the high costs of transport and business logistics; (ii) the low
level of "formalization" and the lack of quality and other standards in the export industry which
tend to affect both productivity and quality and limits access to markets; and (iii) the
fragmnentation and lack of coordination of the supply chains, and deficient value added
components. Using a sample of 375 producers, logistic costs in Peru were found to contribute to
about 34.4% of the total operational costs of exporters. The ratio of logistic costs to total
revenues was 30.7%, in contrast to 23% for Argentina, or about 8% in OECD countries.
Similarly, only 141 companies in all of Peru are using the ISO 9000 standards in contrast to 647
for Colombia, and 6,890 for Brazil, according to PROMPEX, a public export promotion agency.

INFRASTRUCTURE

23. 
In the early 1990's, Peru's infrastructure privatization experience ranked as one of the
early success stories of Latin America. 
Privatization took place in telecommunications,
electricity, mining and hydro-carbon sectors and was accompanied by sectorial reform to
establish competitive markets and autonomous regulatory agencies. By 1998, Peru had privatized
more than 150 companies, raising US$8.3 billion in revenues for the Treasury and mobilizing an
additional US$6.8 billion in investments. However, after 1998 the reform agenda slowed as
political uncertainty increased. Privatization sales and concessions were just US$300 million in
1999, US$360 million in 2000, US$327 million in 2001, and so far only $118 million in 2002.

24. 
Efficient infrastructure services, with higher quality and broader coverage, are critical if
the Peruvian private sector is to improve its competitiveness and attain equitable and sustainable
growth. There is an urgent need to continue the reform agenda. This is illustrated by Peru's low
Growth Competitiveness ranking of 48'h out of 59 ranked countries in 2000 (down from 36h in
1999) and the fact that about 50 percent of Peruvian GDP is generated in Lima. Logistical costs
accounts for over 30 percent of the value of commodities (amongst the highest in the region),
Table 2 compares Peru with some other countries in the Latin America regarding the introduction
of private participation in infrastructure. The balance of this section will provide updates on the
main infrastructure sectors and the main issues they face.

a. While this table indicates which countries have introduced private capital/management in at least some enterprises in
the sector indicated, it should not be interpreted to mean that the overall sector in the country has been privatized.
Also, in Mexico, toll roads were once privatized, but are in the public domain at the moment

25. 
Telecommunications. The telecommunications sector in Peru is one of the forerunners
in privatization and sector reform. The 1991 Telecom Law established a competitive sector
framework and in 1994 the state utilities Entel and Peru/CPT were privatized with an initial five -

Annex C
Page 11 of 22

year monopoly on local and long distance services7 which was terminated a year earlier by
mutual consent. Since the opening of the market in August 1998, 17 licenses have been granted.
As result of sector reforms, the penetration rate has increased from 2.6 to 7.9 fixed lines per 100
inhabitants from 1993 to 1999; the average waiting time for a connection has fallen from 118
months to less than 2 months; and the network is now 90% digital. Overall, the sector is working
well and the remaining issues amount largely to fine tuning rather than structural reforms. Such
fine-tuning includes building the institutional capacity of the regulator, OSIPTEL and ensuring its
independence as a regulator.

26. 
Electricity. The government passed the Energy Laws ("LCE") in November 1992 to
foster competition and improve overall operational efficiency in the sector. The LCE established
a regulatory scheme and tariff setting mechanisms, which would provide competitive rates of
return on investments and promote private investment, while ensuring availability and quality of
electricity service.

27. 
With the exception of isolated regions, the LCE required the unbundling of generation,
transmission, and distribution functions with restrictions on cross-ownership across the sector.
There are currently nineteen generation companies, five transmission companies (including ISA
Peru, an IFC client), and eighteen distribution companies operating in the Peruvian electricity
sector. As of July 2001, private companies operate approximately 65% of the generation and
70% of the distribution of electricity. Transmission is mainly in the public sector, but a recently
established concession program has introduced major private investment in this sub-sector where
currently three transmission companies are owned and operated on a private sector basis. A
recently established concession program to further introduce private participation 
in the
generation sub-sector has faced strong public protests for increased transparency in concession
awards, better tariff regulation and employment generation. A May 2002 poll by Apoyo has 72
percent of the population being against the concessioning of two generating companies (EGASA
and EGESUR). However, the majority of those polled were for concessioning if these
conditions 9 are met. The concessioning of these generators were delayed twicel°. 
The
concessions were eventually awarded in June 2002. However, after a week of protests in the
region affected by the privatization, the government suspended the process.

28. 
In this sector, privatization has brought widespread benefits with an increase 
in
electrification from 48 percent in 1992 to 73 percent in 2000; a decrease in distribution losses
from 22 percent in 1993 to 11 percent in 2000; and investment of over US$680 million in the
sector. These have both directly improved standards of living and business competitiveness.
Apart from the unfinished privatization agenda, there is the need to improve the electricity law
and associated regulations to make them more coherent and flexible; and strengthening the
capacity of the regulatory entities and ensure they continue to have political, administrative and
financial autonomy.

29. 
Transport. While the quality and stock of infrastructure has improved during the 1990s
there are significant bottlenecks to broadbased regional and sectorial growth as high logistical

to the region in which the companies operate; tariffs are properly regulated; maintain employment levels for at least 18
months; companies invest so as to increase employment and service coverage is extended.

costs impede growth outside the immediate Lima area. Logistic costs account for over 30 percent
of the value of commodities. All sectors are adversely impacted as was shown in a recent Bank
study of four products- asparagus, textile, gold and fish meal. The study found that inventory
levels are nearly four times higher than in the US as firms in these industries need to hold high
inventories to compensate for uncertainty of getting items delivered or shipped.

30: 
Experience in other countries show that one of the relatively easier transport sub-sectors
to liberalize is ports. Peru has 10 sea ports but the Port of El Callao located near Lima is the
largest, handling about two thirds of all cargo operations. While it is probably the most efficient
port in Peru, inefficient access and cumbersome governmental procedures still add between a 3 to
7 percent cost to the value of commodities in transit. The lack of facilities at regional ports and
inter-modal facilities and sometimes poor road linkages hinder the development of agro and other
industries outside of Lima. The government has indicated an interest in concessioning ports after
the current program of electricity sector liberalization. It wishes to start with some of the smaller
regional ports. Some of these are very small and have low volumes possibly making them
unattractive to the private sector. Bundling of these smaller ports or utilizing performance based
private sector management contracts may be an alternative way to realize efficiency gains for
these ports. Also to ensure effective and orderly competition, the legal and regulatory framework
covering the sector needs to be improved.

31. 
Lack of an effective road network has not only raised logistical costs but also may have
impeded rural growth. Peru has one of the lowest indicators of paved road density in the Latin
American region, with density of 6.7km of asphalt roads per 1000 square kilometers or just over
one-third the density of neighbors such as Chile and Brazil. This is also indicated by the
normalized road index which is calculated as 32 for Peru, compared to 97 for Mexico (a score of
100 would be considered normal). While certain roads and parts of highways may be candidates
for concessioning, given high traffic volatility and the significant initial maintenance required,
some form of govermnent support may be required which raises fiscal issues. Also while such
consessioning will facilitate the upkeep of the higher traffic volume roads, a more comprehensive
mechanism to finance the operations and maintenance expenditures of municipal and rural roads
remains a priority.

THE REAL SECTOR AND SERVICES

32. 
The Mining sector is key for growth and development in Peru. Peru's minerals
industry has emerged as one of the key industries for the country's economic and social
development. The sector generates more than 45% of the country's export earnings, contributing
about 5% of Peru's GDP. Tax revenues from the sector are highly relevant for Peru to keep up its
macroeconomic-financial projections. Over one quarter million people depend on formal mining
for their livelihood, and it is estimated that this could double given the sector's potential. Mining
is particularly relevant in some of the mountainous areas of the country which count amongst the
poorest regions; attracting and sustaining mining investment in these areas will, when done well,
also contribute to reducing the widening inequalities between the coastal areas and the lagging
interior.

33. 
However without sector reforms growth of the sector cannot be sustained, and its
contributions to broad-based and equitably-shared growth will fall short of both potential and
expectations. The mining industry has long been Peru's most prosperous sector, with growth
rates between 6.6% to 15.2%, between 1994 and 1999, attracting a total of US$6.3 billion in
investments between 1992 and 2001, peaking in 2001 at $1.3 billion. However, investors'
interest in the sector has recently dropped dramatically, resulting in investment projections of

Annex C
Page 13 of 22

about US$500 million per annum between 2003 and 2005, and a further drop to US$200 to
US$250 million thereafter. The key question for Peru is whether it can institute reforms that will
return the sector to its role as an engine of growth.

34. 
The dramatic drop in investors' interest is, in part, linked to institutional weaknesses and
associated regulatory risks. Projections for investments in mining have sizably shrunk all across
the world, in line with falling minerals and metals prices triggered by the worldwide economic
slow-down. However, "mining countries" such as Peru stand an excellent chance in positioning
themselves well in the upcoming international competition for new investments. Yet, key
structural and transparency issues have negatively affected the quality of the interaction of the
sector with society, particularly with the local communities, and must be addressed since the
perception of inadequate environmental control and of widespread conflict between mining
companies and local populations is endangering the contribution and the stability of this key
sector of the Peruvian economy. The Peruvian mining sector suffers from three main institutional
weaknesses which create high transaction costs for potential investors, representing a strong
disincentive for engagement in the sector:

* Roles and Responsibilities unclear: Mine Sector Reform which begun in early 1992 by
assigning clear roles and responsibilities to the various actors in the sector, was never
finalized, contributing to confusion and high transaction cost for mining firms as they
struggle to understand the scope and limits of their responsibilities;
* Government's environmental management needs to be strengthened: Privatization
and concession of mining ventures to foreign companies has had a positive effect on
the environment as international companies have tended to comply better with
environmental regulations than the state-owned and medium sized mines. However
environmental 
institutions need to build capacity and there is the need to remove
potential conflict-of-interest situations". The situation complicates mining firms'
operations in that they find it hard to deflect social or political tensions around large
mining projects as no "credible" authority can work with them 
in ensuring
environmental and social compliance;
* Sharing of mining revenue tax income is the cause for heated social and political
concerns. Heated debates have emerged around existing and newly planned mining
operations, typically in the context of criticisms that local communities and regions do
not gain much from mining operations. These criticisms are fostered by high
expectations which are created when those investments are announced, the marginal
employment these mines create for unskilled indigenous workers, the often negative
social consequences on the communities living close to the mines (import of prostitutes
and alcoholism are often mentioned as major social concerns) and the lack of genuine
interest of some mining companies to promote regional development. While a 1992
law provided for the transfer to mining regions of 20 percent of corporate mining taxes
collected and revised in 199912, there is disagreement in how it should be interpreted
and applied, and there is a lack of transparency surrounding the transfers. The
issues regarding revenue sharing are (i) the continuous change of
outstanding 
legislation/regulation, (ii) the discretion in the amount to be transferred and (iii) the
lack of transparency surrounding the transfers.

l For instance, the Ministry of Mines and Energy has a core technical group interested in promoting the sector and an
environmental unit whose mandate it is to prevent environmental damage. 
In another instance, state environmental
inspections are undertaken with the assistance of experts that are contracted by the company being inspected.

35. 
While hydrocarbons has not been traditionally a large sector in Peru (in terms of GDP
impact) the recent discovery of the huge Camisea gas field should significantly change the sector.
The energy sector (electricity and hydrocarbons) were affected by the legal and regulatory
reforms which took place in 1992. As part of these reforms the state-owned monopoly company,
Petroperu, was broken up according to business 
lines (production, refinery/storage and
commercial lines) and partially divested. Two regulatory/supervisory entities were created,
Perupetro in charge of promotion/contract supervision of hydrocarbon exploration and production
and OSINERG for quality of product and service regulations and supervision. After over eight
years since the start of the reform process, there has been some positive progress in the
hydrocarbon sector. Nevertheless, there is only a partially completed privatization program, and a
need to expand exploration and production 13 , a coherent sector strategy and strengthening of the
legal and regulatory framework and institutions will be needed to encourage additional
international investment especially as Peru competes with better known regional hydrocarbon
producers for limited foreign investmnent resources. The environmental and social complexities
of a project such as Camisea are likely to require enhanced capacity within the Government to
properly oversee the development of such projects. This may be particularly so with relatively
small sponsors.

36. 
Agribusiness. Market oriented policies in the 1990s (such as land tenure laws), renewed
private investment, opening of the market, and growth in production and exports, have brought
major changes to the agricultural sector. Reflective of this is the growth in non-traditional
agricultural exports, which grew by 134 percent from 1991 to 2000. However issues remain,
such as (i) the lack of infrastructure resulting in high logistical costs and production losses, with
small farmers losing up to 50 percent of their produce in the process of transportation and storage;
and (ii) the need to attract operational expertise to manage the risks inherent to the sector.
Additionally, Peru's per capita availability of cultivable land is only 0.13 ha, less than one third
the average for South America, due to the poor availability of water. The coastal area has 21
percent of the cultivable area and accounts for 60 percent of agricultural GDP through intensive
agricultural activity. This has led to soil salinization associated with the large irrigation schemes
in the northern Pacific valleys. More than 50 percent of Peruvian soils suffer from erosion; 6.2
percent (8 million ha) are heavily damaged, mostly in the Sierra. To prevent further deterioration,
there is the need to build capacity of the various government agencies to ensure the sustainable
use of land and water resources.

37. 
Tourism has become an important component of the Peruvian economy and offers
significant potential for growth because of Peru's rich historic, cultural and natural assets. As
indicated in Figure 10 below, foreign arrivals have increased significantly over the past few years.
From a low base of just over 200,000 arrivals in 1992, the pattern has been one of overall high
growth, over 10% per annum, to reach just over one million arrivals in 2000. In 2001, arrivals
declined 2 percent due to several factors including uncertainty surrounding the election, economic
problems in Latin America, recession in the US and the events of September 1 1dh. Considering
the significant declines experienced by other destinations worldwide, the 2% decline 
is
considered fairly minor. Early indications for 2002 are that visitor numbers will be similar to
2001: Still the numbers are considered low for the quality, quantity and variety of tourist
attractions in Peru and relative proximity to some major markets (5-hour flight from Miami).
Some of the constraints to increasing the volume is insufficient destination marketing abroad, and
the need to upgrade hotel stock and infrastructure, especially in the southern tourism circuit.
Overall the long-term growth prospects of Peru's tourism industry is good: the discovery of new

Except for Camisea, no discovery of any significance has been found.

ruins near Macchu Picchu as well as the ruins at the north of the country in Kuelap. The
development of tourism in Peru, as in other countries, must take place in an environmentally and
socially sustainable manner. The preservation of natural and cultural assets, and the benefits to
communities surrounding tourism sites, are increasingly recognized as critical for successful and
sustainable tourism ventures.

38. 
Facilitating human capital development will be necessary if Peru is to increase its
competitiveness and diversify its economy. Peru has made steady progress in improving access
to basic health care and education. However, the need to maintain fiscal discipline will constrain
public spending, and therefore it will be necessary to rationalize and optimize the allocations of
the private sector's resources. 
This means utilizing 
the
public resources and utilize 
complementary roles of the public and private sectors to maximize benefits to the public.

39. 
Peru made good strides in the development of its education sector in the second half of
the 20th century. Primary education now reaches nearly all children; secondary and tertiary
education institutions enroll about 80% of 12- to 16-year olds and 30% of 17- to 25-year olds.
Few countries in the same income range (Peru is a lower-middle income country with GDP per
capita of US$2,532 in 1998) achieve coverage of similar scale. Private participation in education
increased rapidly during the 1990s in part due to a new law passed in 1993 encouraging the
establishment of private schools, which led to a rapid growth of private schools, especially at the
tertiary level. The number of private universities more than doubled from 1990 to date from 19 to
43 while the number of public universities increased slightly from 28 to 33. This reflects the
increasing demand for higher education and the flexibility in program offerings by the private
institutions and the fiscal constrains that government faces. Going forward, as the Peruvian
corporate sector move into higher value added chain in its products and services, the need for
higher education will become increasingly important.

40. 
Health care in Peru has improved during the 1990s. Life expectancy increased from 65
years in 1990 to 69 years by 2000 and infant mortality dropped from 54 deaths per 1,000 live
births in 1990 to 32 in 2000. Nevertheless, total health expenditure, as a percentage of GDP, has
dropped from 8.2 percent in 2000 to 6.2 percent in 1998. The sector is almost all in the public
hands with the provision of health services characterized by multiple vertical programs,
fragmentation, and driven by the supply of programs rather than the demand for health services.
In addition, there is limited focus on preventive health care, as the supply of curative health
services predominates. Therefore an important element of sector reform going forward is to

Annex C
Page 16 of 22

encourage a greater degree, than currently exists, of local public-private partnerships so as to
meet the different needs of individual communities in a cost-effective manner.

III. The World Bank Group's Assistance Strategy

41. 
As indicated above, slowed growth since 1998 has highlighted cracks in the real and
financial sectors that were hidden by the previous economic boom. While there were external
events (El Niuo, fall in commodity prices etc.) that affected the economy, internal political
instability and a slowdown of the reform program amplified the effects of the external factors.
Therefore the WBG's core strategy for private sector development in Peru under the CAS period
is to support the re-activation of growth, that leads to reducing poverty. This fits under the
Dignity pillar of the government's own strategy, which emphasizes the fostering of economic
recovery, sustained growth and stable employment and incomes.

42. 
The IBRD and EFC will work in tandem according to each institution's comparative
advantages and mandate. IBRD's comparative advantages lie in its assistance in macro economic
stability, knowledge building and transfer, sectorial policy advice and capacity building. IFC's
comparative advantages lie primarily in specific transactions, catalyzing financing where IFC's
presence adds value. Over the upcoming CAS period IBRD and IFC will explore closer
collaboration in areas such as the financial sector (especially in housing finance), infrastructure
(ports), corporate restructuring and extractive industries.

THE FINANCIAL SECTOR

IBRD

43. 
Banking Sector. Past support by the Bank has included the modernization of the legal
and regulatory framework governing the banking system. This resulted in the application of
improved and more market friendly bank restructuring and exit mechanisms for insolvent
institutions; while minimizing additional costs to the State. However, some problems still remain
in the structure of the banking safety net with regard to the parameters of operation of the deposit
insurance fund and the long term adequacy of its funding and its rules of engagement during
banking resolution exercises. 
In addition, the speed of recapitalization of weak banks and the
ability of the Superintendency of Banks to detect weaknesses early on and strengthen supervision
and enforcement, needs to be further fortified. Following the strengthening of bank resolution
and restructuring tools under bank insolvency situations, developed under the FSAL II loan, the
joint Bank-IMF FSAP review identified remaining weaknesses in banks which were undergoing
recapitalization under improvement plans. To address some of these remaining weaknesses, the
Bank's strategy anticipates the development of sector work during FY04 to provide policy
guidance in the implementation of measures which would (i) simultaneously improve the
efficiency of the out-of-court debt work out process and multi-creditor agreements for resolving
the status of defaulted borrowers so as to restructure their obligations and increase their access to
credit from banks, while (ii) allowing the Banking Superintendency in conjunction with the
Deposit Insurance Fund to use flexible market friendly tools to encourage the sale and/or merger
of weaker banks or portions of their assets to more solid banks with healthy capital reserves
which would engender depositor confidence. Measures supporting the Banking Superintendency
would also include the development of tools to detect money laundering activity and the
implementation of compliance norms, given the potentially destabilizing effects of such money

Annex C
Page 17 of 22

flows on the domestic banking system. All these measures as an integrated set of related reforms
are to be considered as part of a programmatic adjustment operation for FY05.

44. 
Corporate Restructuring. Related to banking health as per above, is the effectiveness
and the speed in restructuring of corporate debts extended by bank creditors. The current process
developed by the government and coordinated by lNDECOPI, requires substantial strengthening
to avoid parties' recourse to judicial mechanisms (which were meant to be avoided under the new
procedures) and increase the possibility of administrative instance rulings by the agency in charge
as well as strengthened financial oversight of corporations and of ongoing negotiations on debt
restructuring. Reform is also required in the Peruvian bankruptcy code to ensure that, if recourse
is needed via the judicial system, the liquidations of assets can be conducted promptly and with
market friendly mechanisms such as multiple auctions to establish fair prices. Resolution in this
area is key to assure future banking solvency and reliability of future repayments from debtors
who have undertaken restructuring exercises, as well as to ensure that both corporate entities and
small and micro enterprises begin gaining improved access to credit from a strengthened financial
system. The agency in charge of debt restructuring, however, should have a stronger supervisory
mandate over corporations, not simply the negotiating and coordination responsibilities, but also
supervisory oversight and administrative 
law powers. The Bank intends to support the
development of such 
institutions 
through analytical sector work 
in FY03-04 providing
recommendations based on best practices, and to move towards implementation of such under the
proposed programmatic adjustment operation in FY05.

45. 
Pension System and Capital Markets. The pension system has undergone a number of
reforms and adjustments since its inception, and new second generation problems requiring
urgent reforms have emerged. The reduction of potential fiscal liabilities in the public system
(SNP) via its downsizing and generation of incentives for affiliates to transfer to the private
system (SPP), needs to be coupled with measures to increase the efficiency and returns of the
private system. Under the private system, completion of the redirection of SPP contributions sent
to the SNP by government agencies needs to be done, to ensure these are collected and booked
under the private system. Since this had been going on for a number of years but was recently
corrected with Bank support. However, there still remains a stock of past pension contribution
debt owed by the government to the AFPs from prior years. Thus, resolution of this pension debt
is also a key fiscal issue and is highly relevant to the financial viability of the private system.
Also in the private system is the resolution of the delinquent contribution payments by employers
to AFPs, the completion of rescheduling arrangements put in place to effect this, and the
correction of erroneously directed contributions collected by private employers.

46. 
In terms of the overall financial sector context, the returns on the private system are also
impacted by the level of Peru's capital market development. Both domestic 
investment
instruments as well as increased investment in overseas securities are key features for improving
the growth of the private pension system and showing more attractive returns to affiliates. The
continued development of a new government domestic debt market should help to promote the
private fixed income market, which can jump start the capital markets and be beneficial to
pension fund investors. For the SNP, rationalization of measures to reduce fiscal costs and
provide incentives for transfer should include approval of a continuous recognition bond program
to allow transfer of accumulated benefits to the SPP. Continuing the SNPs recently established
practice of investing funds overseas to protect their value is imperative in the interim. On the
supervisory side, strengthening of oversight and establishing policy restrictions on benefits
awarded under the SNP, given recent court rulings, is also a priority. Under the Bank's strategy,
the above policy measures would be developed via sector and analytical work in FY03-04 with

Annex C
Page 18 of 22

the objective of implementing the recommended policy and institutional reforms in this areas,
under the above mentioned programmatic adjustment operation in FY05.

THE CORPORATE SECTOR

47. 
The Government of Peru has requested the Bank assistance for the design and
implementation of a National Competitiveness Plan to reactivate the economic activity and
restore growth. The Bank has decided to initiate the preparation of a two phases adaptive
program lending (APL) operation to address this request. While the National Competitiveness
Plan is intended to be an economy wide effort, the Bank's, in conjunction with- IFC's, support
will, however, be selective and will focus on "Export Competitiveness and Trade Facilitation",
especially for the dynamic sectors in non-traditional exports. The emphasis on non-traditional
exports and particularly the agro industry sector, fisheries and textiles is based on the clear
potential of those sectors, the impact on regional development (most of those products are
produced in the North and South of the country, away from Lima) and the impact on small
(rural) producers when integrated into the supply chain, since most of them are involved on these
activities.

48. 
The first phase will consist in a technical assistance loan planned for FY03. This TA-loan
will focus on institution building to address the structural bottlenecks 
to an increased
competitiveness of the Peruvian corporate sector. Possible areas of intervention will include: (i)
the consolidation of the current institutional framework for export promotion to enhance its
effectiveness, visibility and consistency; (ii) devising a system to improve productivity and
product quality, including the introduction of quality standards and metronomy; (iii) the design of
a community-based export promotion scheme with particular focus on medium and small
producers; (iv) selective action to achieve higher level of formalization within the Peruvian
corporate sector, more transparent accounting, improved corporate governance, more efficient
corporate bankruptcy norms and procedures, 
improved mechanism for realization of loan
collaterals by banks etc.; and (v) the improvement of the framework for private participation in
infrastructure (primarily concessions of roads and ports). A FIAS diagnostic work is also being
undertaken in conjunction with that project. In this context, an investment climate survey will
also be conducted to identify the main issues hampering increased foreign direct investments.

49. 
The second phase of the APL is planned for FY05 and will be an investment loan to
support the Governments' efforts to develop the transport infrastructure and reduce the costs of
logistics to exporters. Possible areas of intervention include (i) the improvement of the access to
ports, and (ii) the development of multi-modal infrastructure to be operated privately. For
instance specific actions are required to improve the access from the Panamerican Highway to the
port and airport of Callao, and the development of a multimodal logistic and technology center
(e.g., dry port) at Callao. The close location of the port and airport makes that a salient
consideration to reduce logistic cost and to increase the chance of the Callao developing into a
focal point for products from the Pacific countries.

IFC

50. 
IFC will play a key role in the implementation of the WBG's Private Sector Strategy to
help reactivate growth thereby reducing poverty. IFC's strategy is closely aligned with that of the
Bank, and is centered around the following four themes:
a. Assisting in reactivating private sector growth and enhancing competitiveness; in
part; through corporate restructuring;

Annex C
Page 19 of 22

b. Fostering financial sector development and promote more evenly distributed
access to financing;
c. Supporting the re-activation of the reform program (e.g. in the infrastructure and
social sectors); and
In support of these objectives, also facilitating environmentally and socially
sustainable investments.

d. 

51. 
Strategy implementation under the last CAS. IFC's activity in Peru over the previous
CAS period has been consistent with the strategy set out in the previous CAS. In the last CAS
(which was a non-IFC-Bank joint CAS), IFC's focus was to work in a wide range of sectors, in
line with the then govermnent's emphasis on a broad based private sector led growth.
Specifically, IFC would focus on the mining and financial sectors as well as supporting growth
generating companies with opportunities also being sort in tourism, hydrocarbon, manufacturing,
agribusiness and infrastructure sectors. 
IFC's approvals following this CAS reflect, a good
implementation of strategy, with seven projects approved in the main sectors of focus: mining
and financial. 
There were fifteen projects 
in the four (Agribusiness (10), Tourism (2),
Manufacturing (1) and Infrastructure (2)) of the five other sectors identified as sectors for
possible IFC involvement. There were no projects in the petroleum sector as reforms slowed
during the CAS period. However, there was one project in education, a frontier sector for IFC.
Total project approvals were half of a billion dollars (US$504.5 million) including US$215
million in syndications. As reforms slowed and political and economic uncertainty increased and
the investment climate for the private sector became increasingly difficult, resulting in lower IFC
activity during the latter part of the previous CAS period.

52. 
As of June 30 2002, IFC's disbursed portfolio in Peru stood at US$195 million for its
own account and US$95 million for the account of participants. Overall IFC's portfolio in Peru
has performed about the same as the IFC average. As indicated above, half of IFC's approvals
during the last CAS period were in the agribusiness sector. However, the performance of IFC's
projects in this sector ',as been mixed. While the agribusiness sector has traditionally been a
higher risk sector, IFC's Peruvian agribusiness projects were adversely affected by several Peru
specific factors. At a macro level, the higher value-added food processing businesses have been
negatively affected by the slow down in the economy and subsequent drop in disposable income
that resulted in declining demand. At the firn level, the lack of local industry-specific knowledge
which had dissipated over a long period of state control (especially in the sugar industry) and
corporate governance issues have resulted in some poorly performing projects.

53. 
Balancing profitability and frontier investments. With the combination of declining
capital flows to developing countries, stress on IFC's own portfolio, and the recent economic
slowdown, maintaining the quality of both the existing portfolio and projects at entry is expected
to become increasingly important for the implementation of IFC's strategy. IFC's profitability
continues to be an important signal to private markets that there is good business to be done in
developing countries. There will be the need for ILFC to balance, in Peru, the need to continue to
maintain portfolio quality and the quality of new projects on entry, while continuing to be
engaged in riskier frontier activities. The volume and composition of IFC activities in Peru going
forward will thus be dependent on inter alia (i) the level of macroeconomic and political risks
perceived by investors and consequent fluctuations of private capital; (ii) progress in reform,
including privatization, and improvements in the investment climate; (iii) the maintenance of
stability in the financial sector; and, (iv) progress in the resolution of extractive industry issues
(see paragraphs 32 to 35).

Annex C
Page 20 of 22

54. 
To help firms grow and improve competitiveness, IFC's focus will vary depending of
the sector and size of firms. For instance, there is a strong need for restructuring of the real sector
due to high leverage. IFC may directly work with larger firms to assist in providing financial
expertise and funding for restructuring and investment while, at the same time, introducing
corporate governance and sustainability systems so as to set a strong foundation for future growth
and access to finance. For smaller firms, IFC will utilize financial intermediaries such as banks
and other financial institutions to efficiently support the restructuring exercise and reactivate
investment by these firms. In the case of the traditional export oriented finns in the mining and
hydrocarbon sectors, there may be less of a need for IFC's straight funding support. However,
given the social and environmental complexity of many potential resource development projects
in Peru, IFC is likely to have a strong role in trying to enhance the environmental and social
sustainability of such projects. In this respect, IFC can be a source of expertise and also act as a
neutral partner between the public and private sectors as well as with local communities.

55. 
Within the framework articulated above, IFC will work across a broad range of sectors.
In tourism, IFC will seek to support sustainable tourism projects as it has done already through its
investment in Inka Terra (See Box 1) and may participate in the Bank's Tourism and
Indigenous groups technical assistance 
in FY05. 
IFC will also continue 
its work 
in
manufacturing and services. In agribusiness, IFC will be selective, learning from the lessons of

Box 1. Sustainable Development: Inka Terra

Increasing destruction of tropical moist forest (TMF) over the past 20-30 years is a global concern with
very serious implications for the protection of biodiversity, the stabilization of global climate and the
protection of the livelihoods of forest peoples and other rural communities. There is a critical and
pressing need to address the threats to TMF. The role that the private sector, with its management and
financial resources, can play in protecting TMF is increasingly being recognized as a potentially
significant addition to existing public sector activities.
In FYO 1, IFC approved an US$8.0 million loan to Inka Terra S.A. a Peruvian hotel owner/operator that
specializes in eco-tourism hotels in Peru. It owns and operates two small hotels, one near Macchu
Picchu and the other in the Madre de Dios forest in Amazonia. 
Inka Terra offers a unique vacation
experience which highlights local tropical flora and fauna as well as the cultural heritage of these
distinctly different parts of Peru. Inka Terra has operated in the Amazonfa for more than 25 years and
has established a track record of balancing sustainable tourism with nature conservation. The company
works closely with local communities, providing jobs and creating an interdependence between their
socio-economic well-being and conservation. IFC investment will assist Inka Terra with the expansion
of its existing properties and the construction of additional lodges. This will put the company on a
more economically sustainable growth path. It will also promote sustainable eco-tourism, not only in
Peru but in the region.

its existing portfolio. 
EFC will also explore opportunities, when they arise, in the social sectors
(as it has done through its investment in UPC, a private university, see Box 2) and support
reforms that may arise out of the Bank's Health Outcomes and Environmental Health: Issues
and Options technical assistance in FY04.

Box 2. Private investment in the Social Sector: UPC
In FY01, IFC approved a US$7 million investment in Universidad Peruana de Ciencias Aplicadas, S.A.C.
(UPC), one of Peru's premiere private universities. UPC was founded in 1994 in the wake of the
liberalization of the education sector. This reform was part of the government of Peru's effort to improve
the quality of education in a fiscally sustainable manner. Since the inception, UPC has expanded its
undergraduate student enrollment by 37 percent p.a. to about 3,000 students in 2001. UPC offers
undergraduate and graduate courses in the sciences, business, engineering, architecture and law as well as
degree programs in information technology and computer science through a subsidiary.
IFC's fnancing will help UPC (i) expand, upgrade and rationalize UPC's physical facilities 
to
accommodate new classrooms and laboratories; (ii) upgrade UPC's computer network systems to support its
distance education program and help UPC in its effort to qualify for ISO 9002 Total Quality certification for
administrative processes; and (iii) provide working capital for student loans and scholarships.

of the Bank's technical assistance in the financial sector (namely the FSA Dissemination FY03,

projects as it has done in the past in the electricity transmission and rail (see Box 4) sub-sectors.
However, IFC's involvement in this sector will depend on government's ability to re-activate its
privatization and concessioning program and address institutional issues identified in paragraphs
21 to 29 of this Annex.

Box 4. Supporting Infrastructure for increased competitiveness: PeruRail
In 1999 the GOP privatized ENAFER, the Peruvian State Railway Company. ENAFER's weak
financial position and low investment in maintenance throughout the 1990s had led to the deterioration
of railway services and the diversion of traffic to other transportation modes. The introduction of a
private operator and the expected improvement in infrastructure should increase efficiency and service
levels and lead to, in the medium term, the higher use of rail transportation, lower, and the increased
competitiveness of Peru's exports.
To support the reform process, EFC approved, in FY02, a US$9.5 million investment in the
concessionaire, and associated companies, that won the bid to operate the Southern and Southeastern
rail lines. 
IFC's investment will assist in upgrading the railway network and rolling stock, and
purchasing telecommunication equipment necessary to increase the efficiency of operations. 
IFC's
involvement will also promote increased enviromnental and safety standards.

MIGA

59. 
Guarantees: Peru is the fourth-largest host country in MIGA's guarantees portfolio,
with an outstanding gross exposure of US$251.8 million, and US$146.6 million net of
reinsurance (as of March 31, 2002). This exposure is diversified by sector, with mining (one
project - Antamina) accounting for 52.2% of net exposure, followed by financial services
(18.9%), tourism (13.9%), infrastructure (8.1%), manufacturing (6.3%) and services (0.7%).
While MIGA issued significant amounts of guarantees in fiscal years 1998 to 2000 ($60.3
million, $70.2 million, and $212.6 million, respectively), only $1 million of issuance was
recorded in fiscal 2001, due to the political uncertainty in Peru at the time.

60. 
MIGA is currently underwriting two more guarantees for projects in Peru, one in the
infrastructure sector, another in the financial services sector, for a total of $62 million in potential
new MIGA guarantees. The projects have been approved by MIGA's Board and are likely to be
issued by the end of FY02. MIGA plans to continue diversifying its exposure in Peru away from
the mining sector by supporting Peru's privatization efforts and important infrastructure projects.

61. 
Technical Assistance: In June of 2000, UNCTAD and MIGA held a regional workshop
on 
investment promotion for representatives 
from the member-countries of the Andean
Community. Peru sent representatives from its investment promotion agency to participate and
discuss regional trends in FDI, new initiatives in investtnent promotion and to begin discussions
on cooperative regional arrangements for investment promotion.

Summary of Voices of the Poor Study

1. 
The Voices of the Poor study was conducted by DFID and the World Bank from October to
December 2001 to ^romplement what had been learned from the consultations described in Annex E.
This study was conducted by small teams of facilitators trained in participatory research techniques to
engage directly with poor people in 9 sites characterized by extreme poverty and broadly reflecting its
concentration in the country - 3 rural sierra, 1 rural coast, 1 rural selva, 2 urban sierra, and 2 urban
coast (Lima). Site populations ranged from some 50 families in the smallest rural community to over
20,000 residents in the Lima neighborhoods. Researchers came from Peruvian NGOs and research
institutions, and were familiar with the areas and cultures as well as fluent in languages spoken at the
rural sites (Quechua and Aymara). Between 150 and 250 people from each site participated directly in
the study.
2. 
The approach taken was an extension and adaptation of the work undertaken in the global
Voices of the Poor study. The latter involved participatory poverty diagnoses undertaken in 1999 in 23
countries in all regions of the world (including several in Latin America but not Peru.)' Through the
diversity of experiences two sets of findings came through repeatedly. First, poverty has multiple
dimensions, affecting many aspects of life. Material deprivation 
is certainly central, but so are
inadequate living conditions, congested and unsanitary public spaces, multiple forms of insecurity-
from job loss, illness and physical violence--social exclusion and the experience of powerlessness,
humiliation and shame. Second, institutions matter for the poor. All too often institutions of the state
are perceived to be failing the poor, whether through lack of responsiveness, absence, or abuse (most
markedly so with respect to the police). NGOs have an erratic record-sometimes good, sometimes
bad, while community and religious organizations are typically well-regarded. The Peru study work
both has some striking parallels with these general themes, as well as many specific variations.
3. 
On the basis of a review of the results of the various consultation processes mentioned above,
three broad thematic areas were identified to help structure the study:

* 

* 

Poverty in the family / home

Poverty and the world of work

* 
Poverty and institutions (including community institutions)
4. 
Participatory and qualitative research techniques were selected to gain information about these
areas, including: (i) maps and transect walks to 'break the ice' and identify and discuss the geophysical
features of the site; (ii) seasonal calendars to explore income and expenditure and consumption during
the year; (iii) trend lines to understand how livelihood conditions (types of employment, prices of crops,
availability of credit, etc.) have evolved over the last few years; (iv) Venn diagramming and ranking
and scoring matrices to capture how different groups evaluate the services of institutions (including
community institutions); (v) daily activities diagrams to explore gender roles and other sources of
tension in the home; and (vi) in-depth semi-structured interviews with individuals suffering from
extreme poverty, as well as representatives of local institutions.
5. 
Poverty, as experienced by those interviewed, had many dimensions and causes, including
combinations of the following:

* 

* 

Unemployment/sub-employment

Lack of power over market conditions

Small farms' dependency and vulnerability

High cost of falling ill

Deficient educational services

Discriminatory and corrupt practices/behaviors of public institutions

Limited access to justice

Difficulties in securing arable land and rights of tenure

Lack of safety and security

Family under stress, including violence at home

Discriminatory gender roles

Insufficient access to formal credit

Frustrated youth

Poverty in the Family/Home

6. 
Lack of safety and security, particularly robbery and attacks on women at the urban sites and
livestock thieving in the rural areas, was an important concern for the poor. In general the perception is
that the police does not provide protection or assistance to them. By contrast, the ronda campesina and
the teniente gobernador at the rural sites were identified as relatively effective security institutions.
Domestic violence continues to be a serious problem, although women have reported that with the help
of NGOs 
(particularly 
the 
small national NGOs) and 
the church 
(both Catholic and
protestant/evangelical) this issue is starting to decline at most sites.
7. 
The high cost of public health was regarded as the main source of stress in the family. Poor
working conditions, overcrowded homes, lack of safe and accessible drinking water, and environmental
pollution were identified as the main causes of illness. At all sites, a wide range of natural and
alternative treatments are being used in order to avoid the high cost of modern medications. Food
consumption patterns show an extremely low intake of protein and vitamins at all sites.
8. 
Study participants 
repeatedly described 
the nuclear and extended 
family, 
including
'compadrazgo' ties, as indispensable to manage diverse crises (i.e., loss of work, illness, crop failures,
etc.). Family support systems appeared to be more resilient in the rural sites than urban.

Poverty and the World of Work

9. 
In the rural sites, participants reported that real earnings from agriculture have either stagnated
or dropped. The farmers' main complaints were that: (i) prices were never stable enough to allow them
to take significant risks; (ii) intermediaries take the lion's share; and (iii) there is an enormous challenge
in trying to get the right crops to the right market at the right time.
10. 
Increased 'minifundizaci6n' was identified as a significant cause of livelihood insecurity since
the failure to gain access to arable land was expressed as one of the main reasons for migration. Also,
at the rural sites, livestock production and marketing was consistently rated higher than agriculture as a
source of income, while traditional crops continue to be important for food security.
11. 
Joint rural-urban livelihood strategies were emphasized as a way of softening periods of crisis,
in both rural and urban communities. To maintain strong ties with their rural communities of origin is a
common food security strategy for city dwellers. Supplementary income derived from the temporary

Annex D
Page 3 of 4

urban work, or agricultural labor in other areas, is fundamental to the livelihood security of the rural
poor. Rural youth tended not to return to their communities of origin if they could find sufficient
employment in the cities.
12. 
In the urban sites, people were typically involved in multiple income generating activities,
notably but not entirely in the informal sector. Hours are long and earnings are low and uncertain.
Women expressed greater willingness than men to perform low status jobs, while men spoke more often
of the stress of being unemployed or underemployed. The unpredictability of the labor market is one of
the greatest stresses identified, in addition to problems of health and education. Finally, the participants
identified their lack of access to formal credit as a significant problem.

Poverty and Institutions (including Community Institutions)
13. 
The study participants described discrimination (for being poor and/or of different ethnic
origin) and mistreatment when interacting with officials from public institutions external to the
community (i.e., hospitals, special social programs, local government, and other service deliverers).
The perception that public officials are corrupt is widespread. The participants experience a strong
sense of powerlessness in getting their complaints heard or addressed and they perceive 'below-
standard' services as being equivalent to corruption.
14. 
FONCODES and PRONAA were considered by those interviewed to have had the most
significant impact on their lives. However, the poor's participation 
in the appraisal, planning,
implementation and evaluation phases of FONCODES and PRONAA was judged by study participants
to be inadequate.
15. 
Water and electricity were regarded as priorities at all sites and in many areas the poor
expressed and were demonstrating their willingness to pay for the costs of improving these services.
However, inefficiencies in these services are common and constant sources of concern. Corruption is
suspected and there is the perception that there are no channels for addressing grievance and/or
complaints.
16. 
Formal education is highly rated by the poor in the study sites as the most effective long-term
solution to poverty. However, the poor are also very aware of the public education system's many
deficiencies, and feel powerless to change it. Inadequate infrastructure, incompetent and often absent
teachers, low learning rates and high costs were listed as the main obstacles. Access to health services
is a very sensitive topic concerning the poor. Programs like the Seguro Escolar Gratuito and the
Programa Integral para la Madre Gestante, as well as the special programs to fight tuberculosis and
malaria, where applicable, were welcomed as important government contributions to the poor.
However, main complaints with regards to the health system included: (i) rude and discriminatory
behavior of health staff; (ii) costs of treatment, medicines, surgery, hospital stays; and (iii) resulting loss
of earnings.
17. 
Those interviewed regarded access 
to justice to be most effective through their own
community-based institutions. In the rural areas, the teniente gobernador, as arbitrator and conciliator
over minor offenses, was highly valued. The ronda campesina also got good marks for protecting
livestock from thieves. District and provincial level courts were assessed as distant, unfeeling, and
corrupt. As for the police, in 8 out of the 9 sites under evaluation, they were described as a threat to
people's lives rather than as a protection force.
18. 
With one exception (at a rural Puno site where the woman councilor is from the community
itself), district and provincial-level municipal governments were assessed as unaccountable and
unresponsive to the concerns of the poor. In contrast, NGOs and church organizations, where present,
were perceived to be more accountable and effective. However, coverage seemed to be the main issue:
NGOs and church organizations were totally absent in two sites and only barely present in another two.

19. 
The poor's own community-based organizations were consistently assessed as indispensable in
the fight against poverty. However, community-based organizations were also categorized as lacking
effective management and advocacy capabilities. Two government sponsored programs, the Clubes de
madres (mothers' clubs) and comedores populares (soup kitchens) were claimed by the women
interviewed as belonging directly to them. Food distribution by these organizations, however, has
created conflict and the women complained of favoritism and abuse of privilege.

Civil Society Consultations Related to CAS Preparation and Poverty Reduction

Annex E
Page 1 of 8

1. 
In the last two years, Peru has witnessed a flourishing of consultations and consensus-
building exercises with the participation of civil society and government, which would have been
unthought of at the time of the 1997 CAS. After years of top-down decision making, a vibrant civil
society has emerged in many fora. This annex, based in part on input from a joint paper by DFID
and the World Bank,' provides a synthesis of those consultations that have focused on poverty
alleviation and have provided important inputs for the preparation of this CAS.

L. 

The Poverty Fora - 1998-2002

2. 
A series of four Poverty Fora brought together goverrnent, donors, NGOs, the private
sector and academics, to identify the best options to fight poverty. It was started by the World Bank
and the Office of the Prime Minister in 1998 and since then different donors have taken the lead
every year. The results of the third Forum were presented to all Presidential candidates and later
endorsed by the incoming Toledo administration. Many of the recommendations are reflected in
the design of investment operations, including the rural education and the rural water.

3. 
The First Poverty Forum, in 1998, concluded that effectiveness of anti-poverty programs
was hampered because of: inadequate targeting on the poorest, lack of coordination between
programs, excessive centralization, 
inadequate 
social participation 
in 
the design, poor
implementation and monitoring of the programs, and insufficient evaluation. While this first Forum
did not go into much detailed policy recommendations (this was the focus of the Second Forum in
1999 and 2000), some priority areas were agreed upon:

* 

* 

* 

The need for more co-ordination between social programs, and more effective targeting.
Only FONCODES and PRONAA were identified as successful in reaching the very poor,
though it was agreed that there was still room for improvement in these programs.

The need to maintain macro-economic stability as a basic condition to fight poverty
effectively.

The need to focus on rural poverty, especially in the sierra (highlands), with programs to
improve access to basic infrastructure (rural roads, water, sanitation, electricity, etc.);
education; and marketing of rural produce.

4. 
The Second Poverty Forum, in 1999, focused on 5 priorities in the fight against poverty:
nutrition, health, education, water and sanitation, and access to justice. 
In addition to Lima,
regional fora were conducted in Cuzco, Tarapoto, and Piura. The methodology consisted of
agreeing on problems and strategies for each strategic area.

5. 
The main nutrition problem identified in the regional fora was poor nutrition education.
The poor design of nutrition programs such as PRONAA was criticized. Among the potential
solutions the Forum proposed were: (i) better training of nutrition extension workers; (ii) better

'James Blackburn, "Stock taking of Recent Poverty and Social Development Fora," a background note produced for the
design of the consultation with the poor ("Voices of the Poor: Peru") prepared for DFID and the World Bank in
November, 2001.

Annex E
Page 2 of 8

nutrition education programs; (iii) promotion of local high nutrition crops; (iv) increased use of
mother's milk; and (v) setting up a follow-up system.

6. 
The main health problems identified included: (i) insufficient coverage and limited access
to services; (ii) domestic violence and alcohol abuse; (iii) insufficient emphasis on preventive
measures such as health education; (iv) services poorly equipped; and v) low level of participation
of the population in the design and monitoring of local health plans. Aside from actions which
address these problems, the strategies proposed included more emphasis on health rights promotion,
and improved inter-institutional coordination, for example through health services networks.

7. 
The education problems that contribute to high rates of pupil desertion and low
achievement were identified as: (i) untrained, demotivated, and poorly paid teachers; (ii) inadequate
curriculum design especially for the rural areas; and (iii) administrative and infrastructure
deficiencies. Among the strategies identified to address these problems were the participatory
elaboration of local education programs, the incorporation of productive activities in educational
activities, and provisions of more resources for adult literacy. The government's plans to address
the problems of teachers' incentives and improvements in education quality is to be supported by
the World Bank financed Rural Education APL.

8. 
Water and sanitation services are nominally in the hands of municipal governments. But
lack of financial resources at the local level, confusion over what entity is responsible for what, lack
of sanitation education at the community level, environmental pollution, and limited community
participation in the design and maintenance of water systems - are all ongoing problems identified
at the Forum. Strategies proposed to address these included: training user groups in sanitation and
water systems operation and maintenance, use of appropriate technology, more financial and
technical resources for local governments, public education in sanitation practices, adjustment in the
regulatory framework for the management of water and sanitation systems, and specification of the
roles for the different institutions involved.

9. 
The Forum identified corruption; deficient training for judges and other legal professionals
who work in courts and prisons; and cultural discrimination against those who do not speak
Spanish - as limiting the poor's access to justice. There is great potential in the low cost system of
communal justice which is respected 
in many areas. Specific suggested strategies included:
standardization of communal forms for administering justice; more women in the legal profession;
training in conflict resolution; better training for 'justices of the peace;' and a reduction in the
numbers of those held in prison.

10. 
The focus of the Third Poverty Forum, in 2000-2001, was on employment, widely
recognized to be the most significant variable affecting poverty in Peru. The proposed strategies
included:

* 

* 

* 

* 

Development of a production networks, to allow micro entrepreneurs to access larger
markets.

Export promotion, given the small size of the internal market.

Investment combined with technological 
innovation, for example in new potentially
dynamic sectors such as the software industry and internet services.

Increasing productivity and competitiveness, with more and better financial (e.g. access
to credit from the cajas municipales) and non-financial services for entrepreneurs.

Annex E
Page 3 of 8

* 

Temporary 'emergency' employment in public works programs. A good example is the
rural roads program. It was noted that more could be done on the housing / construction
front in this area.

11. 
The focus of the Fourth Poverty Forum, 2001-2002, was on decentralization. This forum
was completed with a national workshop on April 25, 2002, in Trujillo, with the participation of
representatives from regional workshops. 
The forum focused on political, economic and
administrative aspects of decentralization. Unlike the three earlier fora, this forum did not result in
a set of conclusions but rather provided an opportunity for dialogue.

HI. 

National Conference on Social Development (CONADES)

12. 
CONADES is an umbrella organization. Debate and discussion take place at the local level
and are finalized at a yearly national event. At the annual event citizen organizations and
movements from throughout Peru come together to debate pressing social development problems
and develop proposals for action. Every year, the Conferences focus on a different general theme.
CONADES V (2000) focused on "Rebuilding the Nation on New Ethical, Social, Political and
Economic Foundations" and CONADES VI (2001) focused on "Decentralization and Reform of
the State." 
In addition to the issues identified in the Poverty Fora, CONADES identified a
fragmented social organization and the lack of strong permanent institutions as important variables
to explain the nature of poverty in Peru.

m. 

Roundtables for Attacking Poverty (Mesas De Concertacion para la Lucha Contra La
Pobreza)

13. 
The Mesas were started under the transition government in January 2001. The members
represent government, civil society, NGOs, church, private sector, and grassroots organizations.
The Mesas are an important attempt to reverse the top-down, assistencialist mode of fighting
poverty. They were conceived as institutional spaces through which a range of public and private
social actors meet to (i) agree on a 'diagnostic' of poverty of their department/province/district; (ii)
establish budgetary priorities for public and private investment to combat poverty 
in their
department/province/district; 
(iii) assess the impact of government social programs to combat
poverty; and (iv) set up a monitoring and evaluation system of these same programs.

14. 

Mesas achievements include:

* 

* 

* 

The setting up of 25 departmental Mesas, over 162 provincial Mesas and 580 district-level
Mesas.

The writing of the Carta Social (Social Letter) as a document which sets out the vision,
objectives, and action program for the system of Mesas, including strengthening the
capacity of civil society organizations "to participate and influence in the design, planning,
execution and evaluation of the results and impact of state programs to fight poverty" and
strengthening "local governments as key agents of social development, providing them the
functions, resources and technical support needed to apply participatory methodologies in
the conduct of government."

The elaboration of 'Participatory Strategic Plans for the Fight against Poverty 2002-2006'
for every departament based on consultations with civil society actors who have
participated in the Mesas.

Indigenous and Afro-Peruvian Consultations

15. 
Since 1997, the Bank has conducted a series of consultations with leaders of indigenous
peoples in the Andes and the selva (jungle) region, as well as with leaders of the Afro-Peruvian
community. The consultations focused on eliciting pragmatic proposals for action, including
government and Bank support. The recommendations coming out of those consultations were the
basis for the design of the Indigenous and Afro-Peruvian LIL and the GEF project for management
of protected areas.

16. 
Furthermore, indigenous organizations are being strengthened and mobilized at different
levels in order to coordinate actions, participate in decision making at the national, regional and
local level, and present their demands for the recognition of indigenous rights and a fairer share of
public goods and services. As a consequence, several Indigenous Fora had been conducted by their
own organizations in a practice of needs assessment and strategic planning. There is an initial
movement toward consolidating existing organizations and, since 1998, the latter have formed an
umbrella organization, the Conferencia Permanente de Pueblos Indigenas del Perzi (COPPIP),
which is remarkably similar to the proposals presented during the Bank consultations. This
organization is facilitating the discussion of indigenous issues within the country and is giving
greater force to the voice of Peruvian indigenous peoples at international fora.

17. 
COPPIP's 16 strategic objectives give some idea of the complexity and diversity of the
types of support needed by the various indigenous peoples of Peru and the challenges for any
organization representing all of Peru's indigenous peoples:
* 
Strengthen and promote indigenous leaders;
* 
Promote the participation of women and youth in indigenous organizations;
* 
Campaign against alcoholism and drugs abuse;
* 
Promote the protection of indigenous knowledge concerning plant life;
* 
Reassert the to customary law regarding territorial management;
* 
Participate in the formulation of political, legal, and economic policies;
* 
Promote more equal dialogue between indigenous peoples and the state;
* 
Formulate proposals to combat racist discrimination and cultural imposition;
* 
Use of national and international legal frameworks to promote new norms;
* 
Ensure indigenous communities benefit from the exploitation of oil, gas, timber and
medicinal plant resources;
Achieve food security for indigenous peoples;
Implement health services which include western and indigenous medicine;
Implement bilingual bicultural education;
Recover, strengthen and develop the ancestral knowledge of indigenous people, spirituality
and world-view

V. 

National Dialogue

18. 
On March 5, 2002, the GoP initiated a national dialogue to help consolidate democracy and
to affirm Peru's national identity. The objective of the dialogue is to create a shared country vision
for the next 20 years (2021 which is the 2 00th anniversary from the independence from Spain). In
July 2002, the results of the different forums were consolidated into a set of 29 state policies to
provide a framework for a shared future vision of Peru (the National Agreement). The purpose of
the Agreement was to create a long-term common vision for Peru and to provide consensus on key
policies that would support the governnent's ability to move ahead on critical tasks.

Annex E
Page S of 8

19. 

Three kinds of fora contributed to the development of the National Agreement:

* 

* 

* 

Governmental Forum. This is the main forum and its work consisted of studying
proposals by Government, political parties, and civil society entities. The president of the
Ministry Council led this forum.

Thematic Forum. These fora included representatives from 7 parties and 7 NGOs and
were divided into: (i) institutionality and public ethics; (ii) equity and social justice; and
(iii) competitiveness.

Decentralized Fora. The objective of these forums was to include the voice of each
department. Representatives of these fora included: all state ministers and a maximum of
two representatives from each party and NGO; university delegates; professional college
delegates with departnent responsibilities; chamber of commerce and production delegates
and small and medium enterprises; NGOs and social institutions with departmental
responsibilities; provincial mayors; and CTAR directors.

20. 
29 state policies (see Table 1) were agreed to be implemented by the national, regional, and
local governments over the next 20 years. They are organized in four pillars: (i) governance (nine
policies); (ii) equity and social justice (seven policies); (iii) competitiveness (seven policies); and
(iv) institutionality and public ethics (six policies). By the end of the four month process more than
1,000 organizations participated in the National Agreement including: 86 'Mesas'; 211 district and
provincial mayors; 118 professional associations; 46 universities; 51 NGO's; 32 various
associations; 44 religious representatives; 29 fanning and indigenous communities; 21 national
government entities; 16 labor associations; 24 regional government entities; 12 political parties; 11
union organizations; 7 government ministries; 9 human rights organizations; 15 small and medium
enterprises; 18 agricultural groups and associations; 19 mothers' groups, 'comedores', and 'Vaso de
Leche' organizations.

VI. 

Civil Society Review and Input to Background Analysis for the CAS

21. 
While the activities described in Sections I through V resulted in a very rich source of input
to the design of the new CAS, two additional activities were conducted by the Bank: a "Voices of

the Poor" study and a civil society consultation meeting. Finally, consultations with other external

cooperation agencies are reflected in the CDF matrix (Annex G).

22. 
The "Voices of the Poor" study, conducted jointly with DFID in October through December
2001, used the model developed for the Bank's global study of poverty. This study involved
consultation with 9 poor communities, both rural and urban. Its findings are presented in Annex D.
They closely mirrored the outcomes of the Poverty Fora but provided a richness of detail that had
been missing from those reports.

A meeting with representatives of the "Mesa de Concertacion de Lucha contra la Pobreza"
was held in Lima, Peru. The consultation meeting was in the context of the lVth National Annual
Encounter of the coordinators of the Mesas (provinces and departments). About 300 Mesas'
representatives, from a total of 734 Mesas around the country, attended the meeting. Most of the
departnents' and provinces' coordinators of the Mesas are NGO's representatives. This group was
asked to review and add to earlier diagnostic work done in a workshop with the government, the
main problems and strategies that shall be included in the Bank's CAS given the following criteria:

Annex E
Page 7 of 8

(i) degree of impact on sustainable development; (ii) degree of impact on poverty reduction; and
(iii) comparative advantage of the Bank in this area. The results are summarized below.

Competitiveness
24. 
In the area of competitiveness, the Mesas' representatives prioritized the main problems
identified during the government workshop as follows: (i) lack of a long-term strategic vision for
country development; (ii) lack of infrastructure and basic services; and (iii) high informality in
business and lack of access to credits. From a list of nine strategies for this pillar, they voted for the
following priorities: (i) 
installing mechanisms for consensus building, 
implementation and
monitoring of State policies and programs; (ii) establishing a public infrastructure plan with
favorable impact on competitiveness; and (iii) widening outreach to including different sectors.
Equity and Social Justice
25. 
Among the problems identified in the government workshop, the Mesas' representatives
prioritized the equity and social justice issues as follows: (i) a population without access to basic
services: health, education, water, and sanitation mainly due to economic, geographic, cultural, and
technological barriers; (ii) insufficient public resources, and inefficient use of these, to support
sustainable operations (i.e., health and education services); and (iii) high rate of illiteracy,
specifically among women. From a list of nine strategies to address these issues, those of most
concern were ranked as follows: (i) formulate a long-term national strategic plan in conjunction
with civil society; (ii) assure universal access to basic services to prevent the further loss of human
potential; (iii) strengthen human resources within a modern and decentralized framework; and (iv)
assure sustainable services, including a financial scheme and adequate technologies.
Institutionality and Public Ethics/Governance

26. 
Institutionality and governance 
issues were considered as one group. The Mesas'
representatives prioritized issues as follows: (i) centralism versus regional demands, (ii) obsolete,
weak and inefficient state; (iii) lack of transparency and civil society participatory mechanisms to
promote anticorruption. 
In terms of strategies, from a list of nine priorities for this pillar, the top
four prioritized strategies were: (i) civil society participation in the government plans, activities and
projects at the national, regional, and local level and during the entire public administration cycle
(budgeting, execution, and evaluation); (ii) decentralization, with adequate interaction at the
national, regional, and 
local public administration 
level; (iii) state reform 
(organization,
simplifications, effective management, 
improved control mechanisms and sustainable use of
resources); (iv) control mechanisms for social accountability with access to public information and
in dialogue with the state.
27. 
Finally, additional issues and strategies were suggested by the Mesas' representatives,
under each pillar, and are included below.
a. 
Competitiveness - The additional problems identified were: lack of employment; deficient
capacity building; high infertility of soils; exploitation of unskilled people; and lack of
technical assistance in agriculture. In terms of strategies, the main recommendation was to
decentralize political, economic, and administrative functions to help create dignified and
productive jobs. Other strategies included to: improve mechanisms to access micro-credits;
promote business management training; encourage vision and creativity; exchange external
debt for environment conservation; and promote productive jobs for the poorest families of
native communities and poor urban settlements at the provinces.

b. 

Equity and Social Justice - Lack of access to adequate housing for most of the population
was seen as a major problem. Other additional problems included: lack of a national

Annex E

identity, values and self-esteem among the population; lack of attention and protection of
children and the elderly; racial discrimination; lack of a cultural identity; lack of programs
related to culture using mass media communication; and lack of free quality and
competitive education in poor areas. The additional suggested strategies were to: formulate
local, regional, and national plans to help rescue and promote citizen values; train the labor
force with a special focus on gender (with ongoing re-organization and training); emphasize
culture that integrates both the local knowledge and external culture; create an indigenous
communication system that values and strengthens the traditional knowledge of cultures in
Peru (in search of equity across all social strata); implement preferential rates for housing
loans; 
include culture-related subjects 
in the education curricula; and promote and
encourage values' campaigns.

Institutionality and Public Ethics/Governance -
In general, the lack of formal public
service training was observed to be a major flaw. Also, civil society representatives
identified little participation of civil society in government decision-making processes and
lack of civil vigilance over these. Finally, the fact that the judicial system is not
independent from the executive power was seen as another problem area. Additional issues
were: lack of cultural identity, lack of coordination between the public and the private
sector, and overlapping functions inside the government. The principal proposal was to
strengthen civil vigilance and mechanisms of public administration accountability at the
national, regional, and local level. Other suggested strategies were to: modernize the state;
implement legal mechanisms for citizen participation; fulfill current laws and respect for
land property; create a national institute of planning to define national policies; and
establish more severe penalties for corruption cases.

Peru Client Survey: Summary of Findings

1. 
The World Bank (Bank) requested Apoyo Opini6n y Mercado to conduct qualitative
exploratory research among opinion leaders, Peruvian Bank clients (government, private sector,
academics, NGOs, donor community, beneficiary community and media), to understand their
opinions and attitudes towards the World Bank, their expectations towards the work that it carries
out in the country, and its commitment with poverty alleviation, as well as their evaluation of its
decentralization process, 
its outreach and communication with the clients, and provide a
comparative evaluation against other institutions.
2. 
This annex presents the summary of the main results obtained from an analysis of 37 in-
depth interviews carried out during March and April, 2002.

GENERAL CONCLUSIONS

3. 
Most of the interviewees share a positive opinion of the World Bank, which is considered
as a large, solid and strong institution capable of influencing local politics. It is also believed that
this institution contributes to social policies, even though its long-term perception of efficiency is
not well understood.
4. 
Opinions of the institution's administration are not shared among the respondents, and
they can even be contradictory. This is not surprising given the different experiences of each one
of them, as well as the type of projects in which they have participated. Additionally, most
interviewees have only a general knowledge of how the World Bank operates, its objectives,
activities and administrative procedures. There was a large variety of opinions regarding the
institution:

* The most common and generalized feeling among those interviewed who were
beneficiaries of the World Bank's aid projects is of thankfulness for the support but
also at times resentment of the institution's lack of involvement once the project has
begun operations.
* Many opinions agreed that the World Bank's strength is mainly in the preparation
and design stages of the project rather than in implementation, follow-up and
evaluation stages.
* Similarly, there is consensus that an important weakness of the Bank is poor
communication of policies and experiences, and that it should give higher priority to
work with the private sector and the civil society, and less to that with the
government.

MAIN RESULTS

5. 

The following points were made by respondents regarding the state of the country (Peru):
a. Most interviewees are not optimistic regarding the current situation of the country.
Even 
though 
they recognize democratic efforts, 
there 
is still a sense of
disappointment and doubt regarding the orientation of government's policies.
b. For most respondents, the main problem is the existence of excessive popular
expectations that cannot be met given government's limited fiscal budget. Other
problems identified were: Peru's history and cultural legacy, the current crisis of
values, deficiencies in education and training, weak institutions, and the lack of clear
objectives for the country.

Annex F
Page 2 of 3

c. Peru's most important strengths were identified as being its stable macroeconomic
policy, the return to democracy, initiatives being taken to reach political consensus,
and the country's natural resources and labor force.
d. Most respondents consider poverty alleviation as the top priority. To solve this
problem, most prioritize the creation of jobs, decentralization, strengthening of
democratic institutions, strengthening of moral and ethical values, and investment in
education and training.
General attitudes expressed about the World Bank were:

6. 

a. 

In general, interviewees' attitudes towards the World Bank are positive. Above all, it
is believed to be a strong and solid institution; it is considered also as dynamic,
innovative, interesting; and also as strongly committed and humanitarian. In spite of
this, some underline negative issues such as some bureaucracy, slowness, lack of
flexibility, and some verticality. Others find certain arrogance among its staff
members. Finally, some respondents identify contradictions between the progress
policy of the World Bank that stresses the empowerment of the poor people and the
IMF's economic and financial adjustment policies for the world.
b. Perceived strengths of the Bank's work in Peru would be its highly professional staff
and a cumulative intellectual capital, all of which allows it to influence in the
government decisions. Additionally, respondents perceive some positive changes,
like a greater agility in the Bank / Beneficiary Community relationship, a social-
oriented vision of their work, and an opening to civil society.
c. Perceived weaknesses of the Bank's work are: insufficient knowledge of the
country's problems, verticality 
in the decision making process, 
its privileged
relationship with the government, lack of measurable results, and, lack of interest in
the follow-up process for the projects.
d. Most interviewees have low expectations regarding the World Bank's work because
they consider that its results are affected by the limitations of the government, which
is considered inefficient. However, others demand a greater involvement of the Bank
with civil society, greater supervision of government policies, more efficiency,
greater involvement with the needs of the population, more interest in the follow-up
and results of the projects, and a revision of its economic model, including even
abandonment of neo-liberal economic policies.
e. Most respondents recognize the excellence of the World Bank's work during the
preparation and design stages of the project but consider follow-up and evaluation
stages insufficient.
Observations about the Bank's work and Poverty alleviation included:

a. Most interviewees recognize a certain level of commitment of the World Bank with
poverty alleviation. Many consider this to be an adequate objective; others believe it
is too broad and vague and demand that it should be defined in terms of the
promotion of development or the investment for production. A minority does not
perceive the commitment of the Bank with poverty alleviation, but rather with the
policies of the IMF's economic model.
b. Most interviewees consider that the poverty alleviation programs supported by the
World Bank are of little efficacy, but most of the responsibility is attributed to the
government. Only a minority considers that the Bank applies economic recipes; most
recognize the Bank's efforts to tailor its projects to the needs of the country.

7. 

8. 

With regard to the decentralization of World Bank operations:

Annex F
Page 3 of 3

9. 

10. 

11. 

a. There is no precise knowledge about the decentralization of the Bank and its
consequences, because many respondents started 
their relationship with 
the
institution when the decentralization process already was under way.
b. General opinion about Bank decentralization was that it is a positive measure not
only in symbolic but also operational terms. It was perceived that decentralization
would allow the Bank to have a better knowledge of the country's problems and
priorities, and would facilitate the follow-up and evaluation of projects. Furthermore,
it is perceived as an opening of the Bank towards civil society.
With regard to the World Bank's outreach and communication:

a. 

ln general, most interviewees perceive their relationship with the Bank to be cordial
and of mutual respect. Many are thankful for the recognition of their projects and the
personalized relationship with some of the staff members.
b. On the other hand, most respondents consider insufficient the communication and
outreach of the institution, which makes them think that there is a lack of willingness
to share knowledge. Many are aware of the web site and use it frequently, but still
would like additional written communication.
c. Most interviewees recognize the Bank's efforts in closing the gap in its relationship
with Peruvian institutions and professionals, although some declared that these
contacts are still only sporadic. The hiring of prestigious Peruvian professionals is
positively perceived. This is a significant improvement from the 1997 Client Survey.
With regard to the World Bank functioning as a "Knowledge Bank":

a. The "knowledge Bank" concept is not well known. A majority assumes that the
Bank is a bank of knowledge, but respondents declare that they have received no
tangible evidence that communicates 
this concept. Only a few highlight the
accumulation of experiences, its elite intellectual staff, and the "good practices" as
competitive advantages of the Bank when compared with other development
institutions.
Comparing the Bank with other institutions:

a. The general trend is that the Bank would be perceived as "unique in its class" for the
amount of its resources and the scope of its mandate which gives power to influence
the government. When compared with other development institutions, the Bank is
perceived with more power, mandate, and intellectual value than other multi-laterals,
and with more presence than bi-laterals. NGOs are perceived with lesser resources,
with more segmented mandates, but also as more committed to the social issues of
the country.
b. Opinions about the level of flexibility, efficacy, bureaucracy and closeness to the
local problems are not consensual.
c. Most consider that the Bank has a fluent relationship with the other development
institutions, as shown in the events and programs that they sponsor together.
Nonetheless, some 
interviewees express doubts regarding 
the efficacy of this
coordination, because they perceive duplicity of projects and some non explicit
competition with other multi-laterals.

Introduction of tax reform in 2002 to improve the system's neutrality and equity and put
the fiscal finances on a more sustainable basis over the medium term, while generating the
necessary resources to address the country's pressing social and infrastructure needs. The
Tax collection agency (SUNAT) will be vigorously supported in its efforts to improve tax
administration.
Implementation of a sizable program of privatization and granting of operating concessions
to the private sector. Privatizations will focus in the energy sector, in the generation,
transmission and distribution of electricity. The government will accelerate the transfer to
the private sector of the operation of several state-owned assets, including regional seaports
and airports and highway projects.
The revised law will establish a path for the evolution of the fiscal balance following a
recession and will strengthen compliance 
incentives by requiring 
the 
immediate
implementation of measures (in periods of positive growth) to address revenue shortfalls or
expenditure overruns. The fiscal targets under the program are consistent with the path
specified by the law.
Ceilings are placed on the contracting or guaranteeing of nonconcessional medium- and
long-term external public debt and on the outstanding short-term debt of the nonfinancial
public sector.
In support of the Superintendency of Banks and Insurance (SBS), in the first year of the
program the government will submit legislation to congress to (i) provide the legal
protcction to SBS staff in the discharge of their responsibilities; (ii) strengthen banks'
capital requirements by deducting goodwill items from regulatory capital; and (iii) reduce
banks' single credit exposure limits by lowering the legal limit on leasing operations.
The government has already implemented the first phase in the introduction of legislation
for a phased reform of the public and private pension systems. The second phase, will
focus on lowering the operating costs of private pension administrators and expanding their
investment options.
The government is formulating plans to streamline the trade tax regime that would aim at a
gradual reduction in the level and dispersion of import tariff rates in order to reach an
average rate below 10% over time. The government will not create new free trade zones or
expand existing ones.
The World Bank, IDB, and the CAF are supporting the government's efforts to strengthen
poverty alleviation programs, modernize infrastructure, and improve the efficiency of the
public sector. R:eform programs that airn at poverty alleviation include: strengthening
social protection programs, expanding rural education services and improving rural
infrastructure, and focalizing social services in urban areas. 
Infrastructure programs
concentrate on an overhaul and expansion of the national highway system. To improve the
efficiency of the public sector, the government is undertaking a public sector expenditure
review, developing a fiscal decentralization strategy, and reforming the public education
system.
By end 2002 the temporary consumer-lending program (Multired) to aid low-income
public sector employees and pensioners created by the Banco de la Naci6n (BN) will be
closed given its exceptional program nature. Furthermore, the program's original lending
ceiling, prudent eligibility requirements and lending terms will be maintained, and the BN
will not create any new lending programs to the public.
The government will not use public resources for the establishment of new financial
institutions for direct lending to the public, leaving fnancial intermediation activities to the
private sector.
To address the scarcity of affordable low-income housing, the government will establish an
insurance program for mortgage securities, to be backed by deposits in the banking system
of the MMVIVIENDA program. The ceiling of the stock of guarantees for 2002 will be
I US$150 million.
