INTERIM SUPPORT STRATEGY
FOR
THE FEDERAL DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF ETHIOPIA

1. 

INTRODUCTION

1. 
This document sets out an Interim Support Strategy for Bank assistance to Ethiopia
to address the country's immediate post-war recovery needs during the coming 12-24
months. The combined consequences of severe drought and the two-year war with Eritrea
include a large internally displaced population, the destruction of private and public
infrastructure, and inadequate agricultural production in many of the food-deficit areas of
the country. In pursuit of Ethiopia's social and economic rehabilitation, an emergency
assistance program consisting of four operations and amounting to US$700 million is
proposed, in addition to investment lending for food security, agricultural inputs and two
LILs amounting to approximately US$200 million. A CAS will be prepared in FY02 to
elaborate the Bank's medium-term assistance strategy. During the coming months,
Government will also prepare a Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) outlining its
long-term development strategy, which will serve to underpin the CAS.

2. 
The Board has been informally briefed several times on the Eritrea-Ethiopia
conflict. An additional informal briefing will be held on November i3, 2000. At the July
18, 2000 briefing, the Board was informed that Eritrea and Ethiopia had signed a
Cessation of Hostilities Agreement in June 2000, an important step towards ending the
conflict which erupted in May 1998. It is encouraging to note that the agreement signed in
June 2000 is holding, and that the leaders of both Eritrea and Ethiopia reaffirmed their
commitment to finding a lasting solution to the conflict at the recent UN-sponsored
Millennium Summit in New York. At the July 18 briefing, it was agreed that the Bank
would prepare an Interim Support Strategy for Ethiopia to accompany the Emergency
Recovery Credit to the Board. A strong effort by the international community will support
and reinforce the peace process, particularly with the resumption of peace talks at the end
of October 2000. The UN peacekeeping force has begun to be deployed.

2. 

POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC BACKGROUND

3. 
Since the signing of the Cessation of Hostilities Agreement on June 18, 2000, the
two armies have refrained from significant military action. The agreement calls for the
withdrawal of the Ethiopian army from Eritrean territory and the deployment of a United
Nations peacekeeping force along a 25 kilometer buffer zone inside Eritrea until the UN

demarcates the border. On July 31, 2000 the United Nations Security Council authorized
the establishment of a UN Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea (UTNMEE). Since August, the
UN has deployed liaison officers in each capital city and UN military observers in the
field. On September 15, 2000, the UN Security Council authorized the deployment of a
peacekeeping force of up to 4,200 personnel, which should be fully deployed by mid-
December, 2000. Both countries are currently discussing the components of a formal
Peace Treaty, under the mediation of the OAU.

4. 
Ethiopia's population of 62.8 million is the second largest in sub-Saharan Africa,
and its per capita income of US$100, the second lowest. Social indicators are among the
lowest in the world, with a gross primary enrollment ratio of 43 percent and life
expectancy of 43 years. Forty-five percent of the population live below the national
poverty line. After registering encouraging progress throughout the mid-1990s, the
Ethiopian economy has experienced significant setbacks in the past two years, as a result
of the cumulative impacts of the war and a severe, multi-year drought which reached
major emergency proportions in 2000. These shocks were compounded in 2000 by a
significant reversal in Ethiopia's terms of trade. Underlying these immediate difficulties
are the persistent challenges associated with transforming the economy of one of the
world's poorest agricultural economies, and the added burden of an AIDS epidemic that
has already caused widespread suffering and threatens the integrity of Ethiopia's
economic and social fabric.

5. 
The current regime overthrew the communist Derg government in 1991, inheriting
a country impoverished by years of civil war and misguided policies, with per capita
income lower than in 1960. The new Government adopted an economic model which
gives prominence to the private sector while providing for continued state involvement in
the provision of public goods and selective interventions to counteract market
imperfections in an economy in transition. A central element of the Government's policy
is a direct attack on rural poverty, articulated in its Agricultural Development Led
Industrialization (ADLI) 
strategy. ADLI emphasizes agriculture and 
the
complementarities between agricultural and industrial development as the key to rapid
growth. By the same token, investment directed towards peasant agriculture and rural
service delivery in areas where the bulk of Ethiopia's absolute poor reside is by definition
pro-poor.

6. 
Ethiopia's recovery in the 1990s was fuelled by several key changes. Paramount
among these was peace and stability. Second was a radical improvement in
macroeconomic management. The fiscal deficit declined from 8.5 percent of GDP in
FY91 to 4.3 percent by FY98, spurred by a massive demobilization and drop in military
expenditure from over a quarter of GDP in the late 1980s to some 2 percent by FY97, with
much of this peace dividend diverted to the social sectors and other high priority, pro-poor
expenditures. Third, the Government enacted a major grain and agricultural inputs
marketing liberalization. Fourth, the country was blessed by good weather; and finally,
donor funding increased dramatically, with disbursements from loans and grants achieving
levels of 6 percent of GDP by FY98. As a result of these factors, Ethiopia achieved GDP
growth rates averaging some 6 percent per annum during FY92-99.

2

7. 
These impressive economic trends began to deteriorate by the end of FY99,
because of the war as well as the compounding effects of drought and a reversal in
Ethiopia's terms of trade. For much of FY99, Government efforts to protect development
expenditures used a combination of cuts in non-essential, non-military expenditures,
higher deficits and the utilization of privatization proceeds and public enterprise earnings,
and achieved some success; GDP grew by 6.2 percent in FY99, inflation remained
subdued and social sector spending as a ratio of GDP declined only marginally. By FY00,
however, the Government's focus on the development agenda had been overwhelmed by a
combination of defense expenditures exceeding 13 percent of GDP, drought manifesting
as incipient famine, a sharp deterioration in the terms of trade1 , and a decline in non-food
donor disbursements. Preoccupation with the conflict also meant a diversion of
Government attention, with the result that reforms (particularly those associated with
deregulation and liberalization) either slowed or were delayed. The fiscal deficit rose to
nearly 11.6 percent while international reserves fell to 2 months of import cover by FY00.
As a result, federal development transfers to the regions fell by 24 percent in FY00,
investor confidence fell, and the private sector faced significant shortages of foreign
exchange2 . Inflation has remained low, largely because grain prices were suppressed by
large food aid imports (more than 800,000 tons of which were delivered and distributed),
but also because several years of prudent macroeconomic management had left room for
expansionary policies. Notwithstanding the drought, GDP still grew by 4.6 percent in
FY00, ironically as a result of military outlays as well as from agricultural growth in areas
not affected by the drought. A final element in the tapestry of these two troubled years is
an awakening consciousness of a more fundamental risk to the country - AIDS. Over 9
percent of the adult population are now living with HIV/AIDS; with 3.2 million infected,
Ethiopia has more HIV/AIDS cases than any country in the world except South Africa and
India. There are thought to be more AIDS orphans (650,000) in Ethiopia than anywhere

else -- and the epidemic is by no means yet mature.

8. 
A notable but often overlooked aspect of the war years is a famine that could have
resulted in a tragedy comparable to 1984-85, but was identified early and essentially
averted. The relief effort was well managed by the Government and the donor community
(in particular by the UN system, the US, the EU and various international and national
NGOs). Severe drought has plagued parts of Ethiopia for the last several years, with
successive failures of rains causing significant malnutrition, large livestock losses, a high
incidence of disease and an increase in the overall vulnerability of certain rural
populations. The worst-affected areas over the period have been the eastern Amhara
highlands (the center of the 1984-85 crisis) and the pastoral areas of the south and
southeast (Ogaden, Borana and areas west of Borana). As many as 10 million people have
been at risk of famine in FY00, and many herds have been decimated. Early in the year,
the UN appealed to the international community for 800,000 tons of food. Pledges at first
materialized slowly and took time to arrive, though the Government's local procurement
of 100,000 tons of grain, along with catalytic action by USAID, managed to bridge the

i Coffee volumes and prices declined, while oil prices increased.

2 Data drawn from the Ethiopian Investment Authority indicate that new investments fell from a high of 2.9
billionBirr in FY98 (5.5 percent of GDP) to 1. I billion Birr in FY99 (2.1 percent of GDP), and to 0.5 billion
Birr in the first nine months of FYOO (less than 1 percent of GDP).

3

gap and stave off a fuill-blown famine. In spite of international assistance, responding to
the drought put severe pressure on the Government's resources, and, as of September
2000, more than 5 million people were still considered at risk. In summary, the economic
history of the war period is one of a struggle against successive shocks, and of lost
opportunities in the fight against poverty - what the Prime Minister has described as
Ethiopia's "real war".

3. 

THE GOVERNMENT OF ETHIOPIA'S POST-WAR RECOVERY
PROGRAM AND FINANCING REQUIREMENTS

9. 
The Ethio-Eritrean war has left numerous damaging legacies on both sides of the
border. Tens of thousands of Ethiopian soldiers and civilians have died as a direct
consequence of the fighting. The Government estimates that more than 360,000 civilians
have been displaced from the border areas, losing their homes, businesses and much of
their property in the process. Over 75,000 people are reported to have been deported from
Eritrea. Some US$200 million of public and social infrastructure has been destroyed and
damaged - including schools, clinics, water supply, roads and power facilities.

10. 
In late June, the Government of Ethiopia (GOE) approached the Bank to assist
with a Post-War Recovery Program which would address demobilization, emergency
humanitarian needs and reconstruction, as well as stabilizing the economy and re-starting
the reform agenda.

11. Demobilization and Reintegration. The Government's immediate emergency
response consists of two elements, and the Bank has been working closely with GOE since
early September on their design. The first of these, the Demobilization and Reintegration
Program for Ethio-Eritrean War Veterans (EDRP), proposes the demobilization of
approximately 150,000 military personnel in two phases. The first phase consists of the
demobilization of 17,000 disabled and 42,000 able-bodied veterans, and provides care to
the severely disabled as well as economic reintegration packages (cash, assets, training) to
the able-bodied. Implementation of this is underway and all 59,000 are expected to be off
the military payroll by mid-2001. The second phase would demobilize approximately
90,000 additional personnel, with the timing of this phase dependent upon the progress of
the peace talks. Before being discharged, all veterans will undergo intensive HIV/AIDS
education as well as individual counseling and voluntary testing. The Government has
indicated a wish to use IDA resources to provide against both phases of the program.

12. Rehabilitation and Reconstruction. The second emergency component, the
Rehabilitation Programme for Displaced and Deported Households Due to the Ethio-
Eritrean War under the Emergency Recovery Program (ERP), proposes resettlement and
reintegration packages for 364,000 internally displaced persons (IDPs), 75,000 deportees,
and 56,000 families who lost breadwinners as a result of the war. In addition, the
reconstruction and rehabilitation of social infrastructure in the border areas and of roads
affected by the conflict are included in the package.

4

13. Economic Stabilization and the Resumption of Reform. Following the signing
of the Cessation of Hostilities Agreement, the Government began to take measures to
stabilize the economy and move back on to a sustainable growth path. To guide this effort,
the Government has prepared an Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (I-PRSP). The
I-PRSP is expected to form the basis for the preparation of a poverty reduction strategy,
and for support for economic stabilization and structural reform measures; in addition, a
HIPC Decision Point Document is being prepared with a view to consideration by the
Boards of the Fund and the Bank before the end of 2000.

14. 
The critical first steps in stabilizing the economy are to create fiscal space to
finance key emergency programs; to provide foreign exchange for immediate import
needs, in particular those required by the private sector; and to reduce Government
recourse to domestic borrowing. Meeting these objectives requires a sharp reduction in
military expenditures and access to significant amounts of foreign financing. The
Government has committed itself to cutting military expenditure significantly (the
program agreed with the Fund in early November envisages a reduction from 13.3 percent
of GDP in FY00 to 5 percent of GDP by FY03).

15. The structural reforms elaborated in the I-PRSP include the removal of
bureaucratic impediments to private investment and increased competition in the financial
sector; enhanced competitiveness in agricultural inputs markets; and measures to
streamline the implementation of public sector development programs and projects,
particularly the Education and Health Sector Development Programs. Also noteworthy is
the Government's recent decision to encourage the return of foreign investment to
Ethiopia by requesting the good offices of MIGA to help settle a number of outstanding
expropriation claims dating from the Government expropriations of 1974.

16. Financing Requirements. Preliminary indications from donors suggest that
disbursements from loans are expected to rise from 2.7 percent of GDP in FY00 to 8.4
percent in FY01 and 8.9 percent in FY02. This includes IDA quick-disbursing assistance
amounting to 2.4 percent of GDP in FY01 and 1.5 percent in FY02. In addition, grants are
projected to increase from 2.7 percent of GDP in FY00 to 6 percent in FY01 and 4.6
percent in FY023 . This significant increase in donor financing will permit the Government
to implement the reconstruction and demobilization programs described above, as well as
to restore expenditures in the social sectors, infrastructure and agriculture. The overall
fiscal deficit (including grants) is programmed to fall from 11.6 percent of GDP in FY00
to 8.9 percent in FY01 and 9.2 percent in FY02. Domestic financing of the deficit will be
sharply reduced, and foreign exchange reserves will increase from 2 months of import
cover to 4 months by FY03. This in turn will permit the lifting of current restrictions on
access to foreign exchange for importers, and the repeal of the import surcharge --
emergency measures undertaken to stem the drain on reserves in the latter months of the
conflict.

3This assumes that the ERP financing gap of $300 million will be filled (para. 32).

4. 

THE BANK'S INTERIM SUPPORT STRATEGY

17. The Bank's objective in the immediate post-war period is to help the country deal
as quickly as possible with the human, material and financial destabilization caused by the
war, while simultaneously re-engaging on core development issues. The emergency
component of the Interim Support Strategy will, at one level, help stabilize the economy
and restart economic growth, while also releasing counterpart funds for the country's
reconstruction and rehabilitation needs. The overall strategy consists of a series of
initiatives designed to:

A. Address the immediate human, infrastructure and economic emergency, and to
set the economy back on a path of sustainable economic growth;
B. Tackle weaknesses in the management of the IDA portfolio, which have
accumulated during the war and which require urgent attention if an ambitious
program of new interventions is to succeed, and
C. Engage in longer-term Bank assistance in three areas of critical importance to
the Ethiopian economy - food insecurity, the spread of HIV/AIDS, and systemic
weaknesses in Ethiopia's capacity to produce and deliver essential services.

A) 

The Bank's Response to the Emergency

18. 
Four emergency operations are currently under preparation; these projects would
provide US$700 million in new IDA credits in the coming months to address the impact of
the conflict on individuals directly affected by the conflict (soldiers, internally displaced
civilians, deportees, families which have lost breadwinners); on social and economic
infrastructure destroyed or damaged as a result of the fighting; and in support of an
appropriate macroeconomic framework and important structural reforms proposed in the
I-PRSP. In addition, funds would be provided to assure the continued availability of
fertilizer, which is critical for sustaining food production.

19. Restructuring the Portfolio. In response to the emergency, the Government has
requested a reallocation of credit funds from the current portfolio. Ethiopia's undisbursed
TDA balance is currently US$782 million (Annex 3), of which some US$500 million is
committed. GOE has requested the reallocation of US$30 million for the emergency
program. Of this, US$17.5 million would be reallocated from the Ethiopian Social
Rehabilitation Development Fund, US$9.8 million from Energy II, and US$2.5 million
from the Ethiopian Multi-Sectoral HIV/AIDS Program.

20. 

The Emergency Demobilization and Reintegration Project (EDRP -- total

project cost $174.1 million, proposed IDA US$170 million). The project will finance
demobilization and return of the veterans to their communities of choice; the provision of
reinsertion payments and economic reintegration assistance (to include the financing of
seed capital, skills training, employment subsidies and agricultural tools and inputs);
medical rehabilitation and care for disabled veterans; and an intensive HIV/AIDS
education program aimed initially at those about to be demobilized, and including

6

counseling and voluntary testing4 . The fiscal benefits of demobilization are considerable;
it is estimated that the cost of paying and maintaining the 150,000 soldiers scheduled for
demobilization under the project amounts to some US$90 million per annum. The fiscal
savings from the EDRP thus exceed its costs over the project's implementation period.

21. The Emergency Recovery Program (ERP -- total program cost US$555 million,
proposed IDA US$230 million). The project consists of three core initiatives: the de-
mining of the border areas; resettlement packages for internally displaced persons,
deportees and families who have lost breadwinners (these packages would consist of
different menus of seed capital, inputs and skills-training); and the reconstruction of
private housing and public/social infrastructure (roads, bridges, water supply, schools,
clinics, government offices).

22. The Fertilizer Supplemental Credit (total project cost US$55 million, proposed
IDA US$50 million). Additional fertilizer imports are needed for the 2001 and 2002 crop
seasons. The timely and adequate supply of fertilizer is an essential component of
Ethiopia's emergency recovery program in an economy so dependent on crop production.
It will also help prevent famine, in view of the failed "short" rains over the last three
years. The Bank would therefore process a Supplemental to the current National Fertilizer
Project (CR.2740-ET). The Supplemental will provide bridge financing to maintain
fertilizer stocks while several major policy issues are worked through -- in particular, the
sustainability of the fertilizer credit system, which is currently guaranteed by regional
governments, and the contraction in the network of private traders carrying fertilizer
stocks, which has negatively affected farmers' access to stocks and thus their uptake of
fertilizer.

23. The Emergency Support Credit (ESC -- proposed IDA US$250 million). An
immediate priority is to stabilize the economy and to put Ethiopia back on a sustainable
growth path. A macroeconomic stabilization program has been agreed upon with the
Fund, and would be supported by an IMF Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF)
in the amount of SDR 87 million (US$111 million) and by this credit, as well as the ERP
and EDRP projects. The operation, yet to be prepared, in addition to helping stabilize the
economy, will allow Government to undertake urgent measures such as lifting current
restrictions on access to foreign exchange for importers, repeal of the import surcharge as
well as other policy measures that will facilitate economic recovery, especially in the
private sector. The EU is also likely to provide balance of payments support, and the
African Development Bank has expressed similar interest. The timing of the ESC would
be related to progress in the peace process.

4 HIVIAIDS activities would be supported and financed under EMSAP, which aims to support the efforts of
the various Government ministries to intensify their efforts to prevent -HIV and to care for those affected by
HIV and AIDS. EMSAP has provision for an HIV/AIDS program implemented by the military. The
objective of the military component of EMSAP is, first, to attend to the needs of those about to be
demobilized; and second, to increase HlV/AIDS awareness and condom use in the standing army. Programs
of IEC, condom distribution and skills-training for the commercial sex-workers operating in the vicinity of
Ethiopia's military bases will also form part of EMSAP activities.

7

B) 

Strengthening the IDA Portfolio and Improving Project Implementation
Capacity

24. 
In October 2000, a Country Portfolio Performance Review was carried out. The
CPPR discussed significant weaknesses in portfolio implementation. The IDA
disbursement ratio fell from 15 percent in FY99 (US$148 million disbursed) to only 11
percent in FY00 (US$105 million disbursed). In addition, the audit compliance ratio fell
from 24 percent in FY99 to 11 percent in FY00. In some cases, moreover, the CPPR
identified insufficient progress on policy and institutional objectives.

25. While low disbursements in FY00 relate in some measure to the impact of the war
and to slow international contractor mobilization on several large infrastructure projects,
more fundamental issues of public sector capacity are at the root of current poor
performance - as shown by instances of disappointing overall project management, and
weaknesses in procurement and financial management. Following the CPPR, a Portfolio
Improvement Program (PIP) was prepared and agreed with the Minister for Economic
Development and Cooperation. PIP actions include the closing of a poorly-performing
credit, preparation of a Country Financial Accountability Assessment, tighter supervision
of infrastructure contracts, and actions to streamline planning and procurement under the
Education and Health Sector Development Programs. Implementation of the PIP will be
monitored by a joint IDA/ Government team, and any impediments or delays resolved by
the Minister's intervention. Early signs are encouraging, with first-quarter disbursements
for FY01 up 33 percent on the same period in FY00. Currently, 74 percent of the required
audit reports are up to date.

C) 

The Bank's Re-engagement in Key Structural Areas

26. 
In addition to focussing on immediate emergency needs and on tackling the
institutional underpinnings of IDA portfolio management, the Bank's Interim Support
Strategy in FY01/02 will address three key medium-term issues -
food security and
agricultural inputs, HIV/AIDS and weak institutions/inadequate human capacity.

27. 
Food Security. This year's famine points once again to a familiar Ethiopian
tragedy - while large parts of the country regularly produce grain surpluses, have
increased their fertilizer consumption five-fold in the past 10 years, and have more than
doubled grain production between the mid-1980s and the peak years in the mid-1990s,
other drought-prone areas struggle to provision themselves, exist largely beyond the reach
of the market and depend increasingly on food aid for their survival. The Government has
identified 156 perennially food-deficit districts, containing a population of over 21
million. Although a number of viable dry-land agricultural packages have been developed
for these areas with the assistance of bilateral donors and NGOs, these have not been
widely disseminated; nor have the public delivery systems and infrastructure support
needed to achieve meaningful agricultural growth and off-farm employment been
developed. The Bank's Food Security Project (indicative IDA contribution US$80 million;
estimated Board presentation in FY02) would make available to drought-prone
communities menus of promising technical packages, using participatory planning
techniques to ensure relevance and encourage community involvement. The project is

8

envisaged as the first of a series of such operations, to be conducted in close cooperation
with other donors active in the sector.

28. Agricultural Inputs. The Government has focussed on improving farmer
productivity principally through the promotion of modern fertilizers and improved seeds.
IDA has been involved in fertilizer and seed supply through two projects which will close
in the next twelve months. In response to second generation issues that have surfaced in
the past few years, the Government is developing an integrated land husbandry
management program to ensure more sustainable yields and production in the agriculture
sector. This program, for which Government is seeking IDA support (indicative IDA
contribution US$120 million; estimated Board presentation in FY02) would involve
financing incremental fertilizer imports beyond the 2001 and 2002 crop seasons, support
for improved seed production, and measures to improve competitiveness in input
distribution, credit provision and extension in the context of a still-dormant private sector.

29. 

HIV/AIDS. The Ethiopia Multisectoral HIV/AIDS Project (EMSAP -- IDA

contribution US$60 million) was approved by the Board on September 12, 2000. This
project supports Ethiopia's national AIDS strategy by financing the expansion of multi-
sectoral efforts as well as by creating an Emergency HIV/AIDS Fund (HAF). The HAF
will disburse directly to NGOs active at the national or regional level, as well as provide
block grants for HIV/AIDS prevention and care activities to town-level HIV/AIDS
committees. The project would be followed by others as and when initial IDA financing is
exhausted.

30. 

Institutions, Capacity and Service Delivery. The Ethiopian government has

asked the Bank to give very high priority to helping Ethiopia build public and private
sector capacity. Accordingly, the Bank has launched a program of studies on various
aspects of the country's institutional and capacity-building agenda, with the twin
objectives of utilizing existing capacity better (through institutional reform) and
developing new skills where there are gaps. Studies underway or planned include a case
study of decentralization practices at the district and town levels; a review of service
delivery performance by line agencies; an exercise to convene international investors,
national entrepreneurs and the Government, in order to identify and remove bottlenecks to
investment in promising sectors; and further support for key aspects of the Civil Service
Reform Program, such as improving incentive structures for civil servants. A Bank-
administered/Italian-funded Capacity Building Trust Fund will act as the main vehicle for
financing this work. In time, IDA project financing would be expected to follow this
initial analytical work.

31. 
In addition to the operations and analytical work already described, a number of
LILs have been under preparation since the pre-conflict period. The Womens'
Development Initiatives Project (IDA - US$5 million) was approved earlier this fiscal
year, and two more LILs are slated for approval - Distance Learning, and Medicinal Plants
(IDA contributions in each case US$5 million). During the coming months, MIGA is also
expected to re-extend insurance coverage to Ethiopia, while IFC will be actively seeking
new investment opportunities.

DONOR'S RESPONSE TO THE EMERGENCY

32. 
In the past, the Government has used the Consultative Group process as its main
mechanism for effecting donor coordination in Ethiopia. Due to the war, however, there
has been no CG Meeting since December 1996. In the interim, donor coordination has
been conducted mainly through sector-specific groups in education, health, roads and food
security. Donors have also coordinated among themselves under the Development
Assistance Group, which is co-chaired by the Bank and UNDP. The donor community
has expressed support for the efforts of the Bank and the Fund to help the Government
launch its Post-War Recovery Program, in particular for the EDRP and the ERP. The
various programs and projects described above have been discussed with donors during
the past four months, with a view to burden sharing and future donor participation. The
Government will shortly hold discussions with donors to confirm additional support for
the Emergency Recovery Program, which has an unmet financing gap of over US$300.
Considerable interest has been shown by key donors (Japan, the US, the EU, Italy, the
Nordic countries, and the UIN family). The European Union has also indicated interest in
providing balance of payments support and in contributing to the financing of
demobilization and reconstruction. The IMF Board is scheduled to consider the Poverty
Reduction and Growth Facility in December.

33. 
In support of the Government's request in January 2000 for assistance to the
internally displaced, the UN Country Team issued an appeal and relief action plan
proposing US$27.5 million in food and non-food assistance. Donors had, by June 2000,
pledged US$20 million, mainly in food. An updated appeal was issued in August
requesting additional funds totaling US$30 million for food and non-food items. WFP has
been providing assistance to over 200,000 people displaced by the conflict since April
1999. So far the United States has been the largest donor of relief food for the internally
displaced, with contributions also coming from the European Union, Ireland, Canada,
Japan, the Netherlands and Norway. The UN Country Team has also initiated a series of
studies and actions in the Humanitarian Mine Action (HMA) sector since June 1999,
providing technical support to a landmine and unexploded ordinance awareness project
targeting the displaced populations in the Tigray Region.

6. 

RISKS AND THEIR MITIGATION

34. 
The most obvious risk to a Bank strategy of post-conflict support is that the war
resumes. Generalized instability in the region is also a potential cause for concern. In
view of the signing of the Cessation of Hostilities Agreement and the establishment of a
substantial UN peacekeeping force, scheduled to be fully deployed by mid-December, a
resumption of the war seems unlikely. The unilateral initiation of demobilization under the
EDRP serves as a significant confidence-building measure, as does the Government's
commitment to borrowing IDA funds for a second phase of demobilization and for de-
mining. The Bank's program is designed in the context of, and aims to support, an
ongoing step-by-step peace process, key elements of which are the deployment of the UN
peacekeeping troops along the border, the withdrawal of Ethiopian troops from Eritrean

10

territory, and continued progress in the current peace negotiations. Should war resume, the
Bank would exercise its remedies, as provided for in the legal agreements for the
Emergency Credits.

35. 
The Government has agreed with the IMF on a macroeconomic framework
embodying a phased reduction in military expenditures from 13.3 percent of GDP in FY00
to approximately 5 percent of GDP by FY03. Non-developmental as well as social
expenditures will continue to be monitored under the annual multi-donor Public
Expenditure Review. Additional monitoring will take place under the PRGF, I-PRSP and
HIPC processes.

36. Another risk is the lack of absorptive capacity in the public sector, as evidenced by
serious weaknesses in project implementation capacity. The package of IDA post-conflict
assistance has been designed with close attention to this issue. Some of the components of
this overall package (the Emergency Support Credit, the Fertilizer Supplemental Credit)
will not tax implementation capacity. Other components (in particular, the infrastructure
sub-components of the ERP) will be implemented by agencies with experience under IDA
projects. Lessons learned from the previous Bank-coordinated program for Emergency
Recovery and Reconstruction (ERRC) in 1991 have helped to strengthen design in this
area (the ERRC was rated highly satisfactory by OED). The components of the strategy
which present the greatest challenges are the demobilization and household rehabilitation
sub-components of EDRP and ERP, which involve the administration of many small
payments and verification of their use for specified purposes. The Govemment has,
however, indicated that regular cabinet-level attention will be given to these sub-
components. In addition, the Bank's assessment of capacity in the Tigrayan regional
administration, which will be primarily responsible for implementation, is favorable. Clear
monitoring processes have also been established, and are linked explicitly to the release of
funds under the two projects.

37. 
In addition, if the expected support from other donors does not materialize in a
timely fashion, progress on the components of the ERP not funded by IDA will be slowed.
This will not, however, affect the implementation of the IDA program, though a lack of
substantial donor involvement in the ERP would be seen by some as increasing the risk of
a resumption of conflict.

7. 

TRANSITION TOWARDS A CAS

38. A full CAS for Ethiopia will be prepared in the course of FY02. By then, post-war
economic recovery should be well underway; the CAS would therefore focus on
Ethiopia's medium-term development agenda, and the Bank's response to this. The CAS
will be greatly influenced by the preparation of a full PRSP, which will begin early in
calendar year 2001, as well as by the HIPC process and the consequent availability of
additional resources for financing poverty alleviation and social expenditures. The
Government has indicated that it will seek continued IDA support for major programs of
infrastructure development, particularly in the roads and power sectors, as well as for food

11

security and agricultural development, and for the effort to build national institutions and
human capacity.
