EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

1. 
Sao Tome and Principe is a small archipelago of two islands, which has all the handicaps of a
small island economy but has not begun to turn the few locational advantages into a source of progress
for its people. The United Nations Human Development Report (1999) ranks Sao Tome and Principe
123rd out of 174 countries. Sao Tome and Principe has enjoyed a fully democratic political system
since 1991. It faces three main development challenges at this time: (i) to develop the institutional
capacity needed to meet the demands of a market-oriented economy; (ii) to develop both a dynamic
private sector and a diversified economy so as to reverse the trend of low real GDP growth, declining
per capita income and increasing poverty; and (iii) to develop its human resources.

2. 
Following a decade of economic decline and deteriorating social indicators, the authorities
implemented in 1998-99, a series of reforms within the framnework of an IMF staff-monitored program.
Progress was made in macroeconomic adjustment and several structural policy measures. In the area
of oil exploration, the Government established a unit in the office of the Prime Minister to oversee
policy in the oil sector, prepare the necessary legislation in the wake of oil production-sharing
negotiations with Exxon/Mobil, and ensure transparency in the handling of future oil operations.

3. 
Although the current poverty situation in Sao Tome and Principe is not well known, more than
40 percent of the population is estimated living below the poverty line (with an income of less than
US$ 220 per year), and a large number of people are believed to be living just above the poverty line
and that it would take a relatively small decline in their income to push them into extreme poverty. In
addition, the unemployment rate remained high at about 35 percent in 1998. The Government has
prepared an Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (I-PRSP) that defines a broad set of actions to
improve the living conditions of the most vulnerable segments of the population. A participative
process has been launched with a view to finalizing a full PRSP by end-December 2001.

4. 
IDA's strategy for the period 2000-05 is to support the Government's objectives aiming at: (a)
sustaining strong economic growth to raise incomes and reduce poverty; and (b) broadening access to
social services and improving their quality. Given the limited administrative resources, IDA's future
lending program in Sao Tome and Principe will be limited to one project every two-three years. The
proposed Public Resource Management Credit (PRMC) and its supporting Technical Assistance
Project (PRM TA), which are being presented together with this country strategy, aim at supporting the
Government's goal of improving its economic management capacity. However, opportunities for
further Bank lending may be considered in support of the Govemment's Poverty Reduction Strategy
Paper and on the outcome of oil exploration and production activities, provided the PRMC is
satisfactorily implemented and a satisfactory participative PRSP is prepared. Such opportunities are
possible in areas of human development (health, education and social protection) and support to
development of oil as a new growth source.

ii

5. 
The main risk is that the Government's reform agenda encounters resistance and incites social
unrest, particularly in the period leading up to the 2001 presidential election. Other risks are posed by
low institutional capacity, limited donor commitment and lack of coordination, deteriorating public
infrastructure and a narrow private sector. Declining export earnings, and protracted negotiations with
Nigeria on the delimitation of the maritime border could distract the Government's attention away from
the reform agenda and result in a more difficult economic environment. To manage these risks, the
Government plans to: (i) gain the support of the political parties, the business community, labor unions,
NGOs and the population at large, as it did during the successful preparation of the I-PRSP; (ii)
strengthen donor coordination; and, (iii) develop local institutional capacity.

6. 
Issues for Executive Directors' Discussion: given the above mentioned issues and risks as
well as the limited administrative resources, is the proposed scenario for lending and non-lending
services identified in section V the most appropriate role that the Bank can perform to support
the Government's development effort?

BACKGROUND

1. 
Sao Tome and Principe is a small archipelago of two islands, which has all the handicaps of a
small island economy but has not begun to turn the few locational advantages into a source of progress
for its people' (Box 1). The latest available data (1994) put the proportion of the absolute poor at over
40 percent of the population. This situation grew worse over the remainder of the decade of the 1990s,
when economic and social conditions deteriorated and a sizable external debt was accumulated. The
United Nations Human Development Report (1999) ranks Sao Tome and Principe 123rd out of 174
countries.

1One of those advantages is materializing in the form of prospects of becoming an oil producer. Seismic surveys had
confurmed the existence of deposits in potentially commercial quantities offshore. But there were uncertainties about
ownership of the area. Negotiations with its neighbor, Nigeria concluded in August 2000, allowing for collaboration on future
development of the fields. Nonetheless, it is unclear when Sao Tome and Principe can expect to start producing oil and by
how much.

2 

Sao Tome and Principe CAS

2. 
IDA has had a rather limited involvement in Sao Tome and Principe (para. 36) because of the
country's poor performance after 1986 (eight projects since membership in 1985, two of which are
active). This limited involvement was curtailed further after 1992 when the country's performance
slipped further. One consequence is that there has been little IDA's (or others) analysis of
development issues facing the country (a Public Finance Review in 1997 is the only Economic and
Sector Work in over a decade). The resulting limited knowledge base severely handicaps the
formulation of a Country Assistance Strategy.

3. 
Sao Tome and Principe faces three main development challenges at this time: (i) to develop the
institutional capacity needed to meet the demands of a modem economy, including managing the
development and use of oil resources when this becomes a reality; (ii) to develop both a dynamic
private sector and a diversified economy so as to reverse the trend of low real GDP growth, declining
per capita income and increasing povertv; and (iii) to develop its human resources. To do so and
combat the high incidence of poverty, the Government has prepared and adopted an Interim Poverty
Reduction Strategy Paper (I-PRSP)2 that defines initial poverty reduction measures and actions, and
also lays out a plan for developing a full PRSP. A committee will be established by December 2000 to
oversee implementation of the poverty reduction strategy of the Interim PRSP and to monitor poverty
indicators. A participative process with the civil society has been launched with a view to finalizing the
full PRSP (and hence an enlarged poverty reduction program) by end-December 2001.

II. 

RECENT ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENTS

4. 
From 1987 to 1997, Sao Tome and Principe experienced a profound economic and financial
crisis. An early attempt to staunch the crisis was made in 1990 when Sao Toren and Principe, vith the
support of the donor community, embarked upon an nifamious recovery and econotmic development

2 See Tome and Principe: Interim Poverty Reduction strategy Paper and Joint World BankAW Staff Assessmient of the 1-
PRSP (IDA/SecM2000-167) dated April 12, 2000

3

program. The results were poor owing mainly to weak institutional capacity, the lack of adequately
skilled human resources, adverse external shocks - especially the decline in world cocoa prices - and
heavy reliance on aging cocoa plantations. Real GDP growth rates remained low, macroeconomic
imbalances worsened further, unemployment increased, and living conditions of the population
deteriorated. The annual real GDP growth rate averaged about 1.6 percent over this period and income
per capita decreased from US$350 in 1987 to about US$300 in 1997.

5. 
Following that decade of economic decline and deteriorating social indicators, the authorities in
1998-99 implemented in earnest a series of reforms within the framework of an IMF staff-monitored
program. They made progress in strengthening fiscal performance, stabilizing the exchange rate, and
lowering inflation. In parallel with macroeconomic adjustment, the Government has implemented
several structural policy measures.

6. 
In order to broaden the role of markets in resource allocation, price controls were eliminated;
domestic trade, including the marketing of agricultural products, was completely liberalized; and a
mechanism was introduced to automatically adjust petroleum retail product prices in line with changes
in international prices.

7. 
In the area of institutional development, initial steps were taken towards improving public
sector management capacity with the Government adopting new organizational and staffing plans for
each of its ten ministries; revising civil service regulations; initiating the preparation of an
administrative reform and a downsizing program to implement a full reform of the civil service.

8. 

As part of a public enterprise sector reform and private sector development program, the
bankrupt national savings and loans institution (CNPC) was liquidated and a loan recovery program
established; the petroleum distribution company (ENCO) was partially privatized and two hotels were
placed under private management; a law governing property rights was adopted that clarifies the
exercise of ownership rights; and work was launched to prepare a strategy for privatizing government-
owned agricultural estates and rationalizing the land tenure system.

9. 
In the area of trade and exchange, the export receipts surrender requirement was eliminated;
all non-tariff import barriers were removed and external current account transactions were liberalized;
and a comprehensive reform of the customs tariff structure and a plan to eliminate export taxes were
adopted together with the 2000 budget. This tariff reform simplified the tariff structure to include only
3 rates and also reduced their levels (the highest rate is now 20 percent). With these trade
liberalization reforms, the index of trade policy restrictiveness is estimated to have been reduced to 5 in
1999, compared to 10 in 1997-98.

10. 
In order to prepare for the oil era, the Government established an administrative unit in the
office of the Prime Minister that would oversee government policy in the oil sector; handle legal issues
related to oil production-sharing negotiations with Exxon/Mobil, and ensure transparency in the
handling of future oil operations. The Bank and Norway are assisting this unit.

11. 
Sao Tome and Principe's economic performance improved during 1998 and 1999. Real GDP
growth averaged 2.5 percent, up from 1 percent in 1997 although cocoa output fell by 13 percent as a
result of unfavorable world prices. Nevertheless, as progress in economic reforms began to alleviate
structural rigidities, the impact of the decline in cocoa production was more than offset by a rapid
expansion in trade, construction, and tourism. The inflation rate dropped substantially from over 80

percent in December 1997 to 12.6 percent at end-December 1999. The external current account
deficit (excluding official capital transfers) narrowed from 53.3 percent of GDP in 1997 to 95.7
percent in 1999.

external current account deficit (excluding official transfers) at 66 percent of GDP (or under 41 percent
of GDP including official transfers); (iii) reach a real GDP growth rate of 4 percent by 2002, allowing
per capita income to rise by 1.7 percent a year; and (iv) increase private investment from 14 percent in
1999 to 31 percent of GDP and national savings (including official capital grants) from 14 percent in
1999 to 20 percent of GDP by 2002.

Ill. 

EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT

12. 
Sdo Tom6 and Principe's economy, with its near-exclusive dependence on one activity (cocoa)
is very vulnerable to external factors related to volatility and long-term unfavorable trends in the price
of cocoa; heavy dependence on external aid; and a large external debt burden.

13. 
The country is highly dependent on one export commodity, cocoa, which accounted for about
90 percent of S1 o T8 e and Principe's export earings in 1997. As such, the impact of the sharp
swings in world cocoa prices (e.g. the decline from 167.8c/kg to 99.8c0kg between January 1998 and
August 1999 alone) and of the Thrips infestation can be profound. Transportation costs are high,
limniting access to external markets. The absence of both a deep seaport and regular air transport not
only constitutes a serious impediment to SAo Tom6 and Principe's development but also adds to
transaction costs and limits the potential for exporting agricultural production.

14. 
Public investments depend heavily on external aid, which has typically financed about 95
percent of S5o Torn6 and Principe's public investment program. Since the early 80s, SAo Tom6 and
Principe has been among the top recipients of foreign aid in Sub-Saharan Africa (e.g. during 1975-84
each Sdo Tomean received, in average, US$72 in net disbursements of official development assistance,
while in 1985-89 the amount was US$208, and in 1990-99 the amount was US$447). Indications
from the recent Round Table meeting (Geneva - October 5-6, 2000) are that Siio Tom6 and Principe

Sdo Tome and Principe CAS 

5

will continue to require significant external assistance. But such high dependence on extemal
assistance exacerbates the country's vulnerability.

15. 
Sao Tome and Principe is also highly indebted. Its outstanding public external debt reached
US$296 million at end-1999 or 627 percent of GDP. The proportion of debt owed to multilateral
creditors was 58 percent or US$169.7 million, of which US$65 million were owed to IDA. The stock
of arrears continually increased during 1996-99 because Sao Tome and Principe stopped servicing its
debt to all official bilateral creditors (except France and Cape Verde) in 1996. Sao Tom6 and Principe
debt service ratio in 1999 was equivalent to 49.6 percent of exports of goods and non-factor services.
In 1999, Sao Tome and Principe eliminated its non-reschedulable external arrears and continued to
service its extemal debt to multilateral institutions. The Paris Club granted to Sao Tome and Principe a
rescheduling of its bilateral debt on Naples terms on May 16, 2000. The Government is committed to
strengthen debt management and to establish a good implementation track record of reforms that would
allow Sao Tomr and Principe to request debt relief under the H[PC Initiative. The adoption of a
program in 2000 that is supported by the IMF's Poverty Reduction Growth Facility (PRGF) improves
chances of the country's access to the HIPC Initiative.

16. 
The Government recognizes the above vulnerabilities and is taking measures in the areas of
macroeconomic stabilization and structural reforms so as to improve Sao Tome and Principe's
development prospects. In addition, Sao Tome and Principe's high degree of dependence on external
aid makes the country extremely vulnerable to changes in the external aid climate and also underscores
the importance for the authorities of strengthening domestic resource mobilization and of creating an
environment conducive to private sector development and foreign direct private investment and,
indeed, these are among the major objectives of the economic policy package being supported by the
World Bank, the IMF and other donors.

IV. MAJOR DEVELOPMENT ISSUES AND POLICIES

17. 
Sao Tom6 and Principe displays the economic, environmental, political and social
characteristics that afflict many small states (the small island syndrome), including remoteness and
insularity; susceptibility to natural disasters; limited institutional capacity; a narrow resource base;
vulnerability to external shocks; limited access to external capital; and entrenched poverty3 . Many of
these are conditions that call for collective (public sector) action. Under these conditions, there is great
premium on setting development priorities; creating a policy environment to promote private sector
activities; and efficiently performing the public sector functions of mobilizing and allocating resources
in line with clear poverty reduction objectives. This implies that the Government needs to maintain
macroeconomic stability and eliminate structural rigidities so as to facilitate strong and sustainable
economic growth and employment, led by the private sector; and be efficient in the areas of public
sector action.

3See Small States: Meeting Challenges in the Global Economy (SecM99-693)

6 

Sao Tome and Principe CAS

Institutional Capacity and Economic Management

18. 
Sao Tome and Principe's public sector is characterized by a weak institutional capacity, limited
financial resources, poor working environment, an oversized civil service and high transaction costs,
compounded with a lack of effective donor coordination and a general unreliability of donor flows.
This makes the exercise of public sector function and sound public resource management difficult. To
correct this situation, the Government has adopted new organizational and staffing plans for the
administration and is preparing, with donors' assistance, a full administrative reform, which includes a
civil service retrenchment program. This will be done by realigning the roles and functions of each
ministry, mapping functional responsibilities and introducing new management capacities. An
important aspect of these reforms will be the establishment of effective linkages between development
planning, policy making, resource allocation and staffing deployment.

_

19. Governance issues are drawing
increasing attention from the country's 
development partners and risk reducing
the confidence of donors and investors. 
Many problems could stem from weak
implementation capacity; their solution
will require time and come progressively 
as 
development 
takes 
root.
Improvements 
in 
expenditure 
programming 
and 
monitoring, 
availability of trained personnel at all
administration, _
levels 
in 
the 
establishment of a pay and incentive 
system, and developing a public sector
capable of attracting and retaining the country's best and brightest, are areas where progress will take
time. But in many other areas, progress could be made quickly that would send a powerful signal
about the Government's determination to address these issues.

20. 
The Government is determined to strengthen good governance by increasing the transparency
of all of its financial operations, taking into account current institutional weaknesses and the need to
strengthen administrative capacity, in light of oil production prospects. It will judicially process any
reported acts of fraud or corruption. Measures have already been taken to enhance transparency. The
central bank and public enterprises are now committed to have their books audited every year by an
independent external auditor. Strengthened intemal audit procedures at the central bank will help
increase the level of transparency in the management of public affairs. Furthermore, the streamlining
of the customs tariff and domestic indirect taxation, and the elimination of ad hoc exemptions, together
with the strengthening of intemal audit units at the Directorates of Finance and Customs, will help
prevent and combat fraud and corruption more effectively. As regards to the oil sector activities, the
Government intends to ensure transparency in future operations and in the preparation of the
Govenmment's oil policy.

21. 
In the area of economic management, improvement in the efficiency with which public
resources are mobilized and public services are delivered will be important in raising private sector
responsiveness to an improved incentive structure and in broadening access to social services and

Sao Tome and Principe CAS 

7

improving their quality. Notwithstanding marked improvement in overall economic management over
the last two years, the macroeconomic situation remains fragile and sensitive to regional developments;
and there are often delays or shortfalls in annual aid disbursements, which tend to exacerbate the
effects of any fiscal slippages.

22. Key issues to be tackled in the area of public resource management are: (a) sustained
improvement in revenue mobilization; (b) restructuring of current expenditures; and (c) strengthening
public investment programming.

23. 
Sustained improvement in resource mobilization calls for strengthening the customs
administration (actions are underway with assistance of the IDA, EU, UNCTAD, France and
Portugal), broadening the tax base, and enhancing the transparency of tax policies. Reforms under
implementation are expected to contribute to an increase in current revenue from 23.7 percent of GDP
in 1999 to 26.9 percent by 2002.

24. 
Progress in restructuring current expenditures, notably in changing the pattern and
composition of recurrent expenditure, and in improving their efficiency, has remained modest. The
progress made in reducing overall recurrent expenditures, has yet to be translated into expenditure
patterns that support the Government's stated development objectives: human resource development,
poverty alleviation and economic infrastructure maintenance. Within the social sectors, there has been
some shift in expenditures to operations and materials in education and health, but still too little is
allocated to materials, which teachers and health workers need to perform their jobs properly. It is vital
not only that these increases take place, but that the public expenditure programs emphasize quality,
efficiency and effectiveness in the use of public resources. Indicators for the cost-effective use of
public resources are not available, making it difficult to make intra- and inter-sectoral comparisons.

25. 
The coverage of the rolling public investment program (PIP) needs to be broadened to cover
all sectors by 2000/2001, thus facilitating greater consistency between the PIP and the outlays on
operations and maintenance provided for in the recurrent budget. Moreover, the Government will
continue its policy of not subsidizing the operating costs of public enterprises and containing the civil
service wage bill. Although some progress has been made in estimating and linking the impact of the
investment budget on the recurrent budget, the planned broadening of a public expenditure program
(PEP) to all sectors would help to integrate better the PIP within regular budgetary management
procedures.

Economic Diversification, Private Sector Development and Environmental Protection

26. 
The policy reforms undertaken so far have paved the way toward creating an enabling
environment for the private sector: market determined exchange and interest rates, price liberalization,
absence of restrictions on employment or capital repatriation, low average import duties, abolition of
quantitative restrictions and export taxes, and privatization of several parastatals. While maintenance
of macro-economic stability is important in attracting private sector investment, in particular, in the
tourism sector, its development will continue to be constrained by inadequate financial intermediation,
lack of cost-effective infrastructure, including utilities and transportation, malfunctioning of the court
system, and customs and tax administration. The Governrment recently prepared, with FIAS

8 

Sao Tome and Principe CAS

assistance, a medium-term strategy for private sector development and, the Government will also
implement a divestiture program4 . The promotion of a dynamic private sector, particularly in the
agriculture and tourism sectors, and the acceleration of the implementation of a divestiture program
will be one potential source of revenue enhancement, especially if such revenues could be used to
finance increased social expenditure.

27. 
In a country where 56 percent of the population depends on agriculture and where the annual
population growth rate is relatively high (2.4 percent per annum), developing a sustainable and
diversified agriculture and preserving the environment is of paramount importance for growth and
development. Furthermore, poverty is so pervasive in the rural areas of Sao Tome and Principe that
poverty alleviation must be contingent on a thriving agricultural sector. Growth in agriculture will
require improvements in productivity, diversification of production and improved natural resource
management. Measures taken so far to attain these objectives are: liberalization of prices, government
withdrawal from output marketing and input supply, restructuring of the Ministry of Agriculture to
provide better research and extension of services to farmers. This has created scope for a stronger
private sector role, for which they need financing. For further agricultural growth, it will also be
important to promote farmer participation and self-management in their plots, water management, rural
savings and loans, training of rural entrepreneurs and rural social infrastructure.

28. 
In addition, Sao Tome and Principe are home to the second most important primary forests out
of 75 sites in Africa. Many bird and animal species are endemic to the country, and especially on the
less inhabited Principe Island, there may be as yet undiscovered species. Any loss of biodiversity and
productivity of the environment would further lower living standards. The Government's commitment
to environmental protection is illustrated by its National Strategy for the Protection of the Environment
and Sustainable Development, scheduled to be formally adopted by the end of 2000. Legislation
pertaining to the protection of forests was drafted with the help of the United Nations Environment
Program (UNEP) and adopted by the Parliarnent in 1998. Measures to protect the urban environment
would focus on improved treatment of water supply, sanitation, drainage and adequate garbage
disposal.

29. 
Tourism could also be another key growth sector in Sao Tome and Principe, if critical
administrative and basic infrastructure bottlenecks for private investment in the sector are eliminated.

Human Resource Development

30. 
Sao Tom6 and Principe's social indicators, which several years ago were better than the
average for sub-Saharan Africa, have significantly deteriorated (Box 3). In particular, while SaoTome
and Principe's education indicators were among the best in sub-Saharan Africa through 1990, the
situation of the educational infrastructure has sharply deteriorated in the last decade. The overall
quality of education has declined as a result of the lack of classrooms, sufficient and suitable textbooks,
and a lack of professional and qualified teachers (only 45 percent of teachers are qualified). To

The PE sector comprises 22 PEs, of which eight are in the rural sector. The Government will (i) liquidate two (2) companies,
a meat processing concern (ENCAR) and medicine distribution company (ENAMED); and (ii) privatize a hotel (Pousada Boa
Vista), a palm-oil development company (EMOLVE), a construction material distribution company (Cunha Gomes), the
national airline (Air Sao Tome) and the water and electricity enterprise (EMAE).

respond to the high student demand for a very small number of classes, the Government decided to use
both double and triple shift classrooms. These shifts are conducted by the same teacher and take place
the samne day, meaning that children have only 4 hours of class time per day. Consequently, the
system's effectiveness has declined since 1990. Gross primary enrollment rate decreased from 82.5
percent of school-age population in 1990 to 60 percent in 1996, before increasing to 70 percent in
1999. During 1996-99, total repetition rate stood at 31 percent of total enrollment in primary schools
and more than 30 percent of the school children drop out before reaching the sixth grade. Data also
indicate that the number of girls who drop out of school is higher than boys.

31. Aware of the critical role of education in the mobilization of the country's potential for
economic growth and poverty reduction, the Government will prepare a broad development policy for
the sector which will: (a) promote equal access to the educational system at all levels, without
discrimination; and (b) improve the quality of education, boost the gross primary school enrollment rate
from 70 percent in 1999 to 90 percent in 2002, eventually achieving universal enrollment by 2005. The
Government also intends to raise the adult literacy rate, eliminate double and triple shift classes in
primary schools (thereby increasing the average school day from 4 to 7 hours daily). Primary schooling
will be extended to the fifth and sixth grades, and the quality of secondary education improved.
Development of technical and vocational training will also be necessary to meet the country's economic
and social development needs. For this reason, in addition to general education, the Government will
develop modular vocational training while enhancing apprenticeship training on a broad scale.

32. 
Child labor is an emerging problem with many children on the most remote areas starting work
immediately after fourth grade. Often, even younger children are involved in hazardous labor, such as
breaking stones for construction, metalworking and mechanics. The Bank will work with other donors
to address this issue.

33. 
Sao Tome and Principe's health indicators, which were better than the average for sub-Saharan
Aftica, are currently deteriorating, as witnessed by the recent dramatic rise in infant mortality rate from
50 per thousand of live births in 1996 to 65 per thousand in 1999. Maternal mortality is estimated to
have remained at 122 per thousand of live births in 1996-99 and the total mortality rate increased from
8.3 per thousand in 1996 to 8.5 per thousand in 1997. The leading cause of mortality and morbidity for
all age groups is malaria. A 2000 UNICEF report indicates that malaria accounts for more than 60
percent of patients admitted to hospitals or that have been seen in district health centers.

34. 
The Government will formulate a national policy on health improvement covering 2000-05,
centered around four priority areas of intervention: (i) preventing and combating major illnesses
(malaria, respiratory illnesses, acute diarrhea, tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, and other sexually transmitted
diseases); (ii) improving primary health care by intensifying public information, education, and
communication (lEC) campaigns, developing basic infrastructure and improving the quality of
preventive health care; (iii) improving medical care by upgrading management of the central hospital
(by ensuring administrative and financial autonomy) and providing better facilities and diagnostic
support services; and (iv) strengthening the national health system by adopting a health development
policy, reorganizing the supply and distribution of essential drugs, creating an effective information
system for management and planning, and upgrading health workers' training and career streams. The
Government will also strengthen outpatients' facilities and improve local management at the district
level, particularly in rural areas, with a view to decentralizing services and promoting local
participation in the development of health policies and the management of health units.

10 

Sao Tome and Principe CAS

35. 
Regarding water and sanitation, the Government intends to focus its activities on strategic and
regulatory issues, and thus encourage increased private sector participation. In the area of urban
development and rehabilitation of poor neighborhoods, it will restructure areas of difficult access. It
will also rehabilitate road, drainage and sanitation networks in slum areas and in the plantations and
will provide potable water in the urban centers, under a privatized management system of standpipes.
These investments will contribute to improvements in the environment, and a reduction in the incidence
of diseases, such as malaria and cholera. Through the involvement of local firms, micro-enterprises
and NGOs, employment will be created to execute and maintain these investments.

V. 

THE BANK GROUP ASSISTANCE STRATEGY

36. 
Past Assistance to Sao Tome and Principe. IDA's assistance to Sao Tome and Principe,
which began in 1985, has been limited. It has consisted of eight IDA credits totaling US$ 61.9 million,
eight IDFs and one commercial debt buy back operation totaling US$1.8 million, and a recently
approved PPIAF grant of US$175,000. The eight IDA credits (6 closed, 2 active) include a
modernization line of credit (FY85), two adjustment operations (SAL I, FY87 and SAC IUTA, FY90),
two agricultural projects (cocoa, FY87 and agriculture sector, FY92), two multi-sector projects (FY89
and FY91), and a health and education project (FY92). The agricultural and the health and education
projects are active and scheduled to be closed at end 2000 and June 2001 respectively. Since 1992
there has been no IDA lending. Sao Tome and Principe is not a member of IFC or MIGA.
37. 
Past Performance and Lessons Learned. Out of the six closed projects, three have been
rated as satisfactory by the Bank's Operations Evaluation Department (OED). This high failure rate
points to several lessons. The principal lesson learned is that project design should be kept simple to
accommodate Sao Tome and Principe's limited and weak institutional and administrative capacity.
Other lessons are: (a) while it is important to provide the needed assistance to a country on a timely
basis, it is equally important to ensure that the implementation arrangements and monitoring
mechanisms are in place to ensure that the project will be implemented as planned; (b) IDA should
allow for sufficient implementation support, including through expatriate advisors; (c) political stability
and sustained Government commitment are essential; (d) flexibility in program implementation is
necessary to respond to evolving situations, and the performance criteria should be suited to country-
specific conditions and be monitored closely; and (e) donor coordination is fundamental to improving
the efficiency and efficacy of external assistance.

38. 
Proposed New Assistance Strategy. IDA's strategy for the period 2000-05 is to support the
Government in the pursuit of its objectives as set forth in the I-PRSP: (a) sustaining strong economic
growth to raise incomes and reduce poverty; and (b) broadening access to social services and
improving their quality. Given the high likelihood that IDA lending and administrative budgets
allocated to Sao Tome and Principe will remain limited, the support to the country will have to be
delivered through the existing portfolio of two projects and a multisector approach within the selected
new lending (para. 40).

39. Use of Existing Portfolio. The ongoing Agricultural Privatization and Smallholder
Development Project (US$9.8 million, FY92) aims to increase and diversify agricultural production by
privatizing a major part of the publicly-owned estate sector, and promote smallholder productivity.
Rural poverty alleviation and environmental protection are other objectives of the project. This project
assisted much of the work during 1998-2000 on the privatization of state-owned estates and the

Sdo Tome and Principe CAS 

11

expansion of small holder activity. The remaining undisbursed amount (US$0.7 million) will support
the finalization of work on the land tenure system (para. 8). In the social sectors, the Health and
Education Project (US$ 11.4 million, FY92) aims to reverse the decline in the health and educational
status through, in the health sector, a malaria eradication and control program and the provision of
drugs; and in the education sector, the provision of textbooks and schools supplies and improved
school inspection. Planning capacities would be strengthened in both sectors. During the period 2000-
01, the remaining resources in this Credit (US$3.1 million) will be focussed on increasing access to
schooling (rehabilitation of classrooms and provision of teaching material).

40. 
Proposed New Lending. IDA's future lending program in Sao Tome and Principe will
remain limited as in the past and we expect to prepare or cofinance one project every two-three years.
The proposed Public Resource Management Credit and its supporting Technical Assistance Project
(FY01), seek to tackle the heart of the institutional and economic management capacity problem. The
PRMC is the appropriate instrument to put in place at this time as it makes resources available to: (i)
strengthen the Government's capacity to mobilize and manage public resources; and (ii) finance
selected reforms, as well as fund analytical studies in key areas. Its formulation takes into account
important lessons learned from past operations such as focus, timely assistance (use of quick-
disbursing instrument), and availability of external expertise. Opportunities for further Bank lending
may be considered in the context of the Government's Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP), the
policy paper on strategic options and action plan for the period 2000-05, and on the results of ongoing
and planned activities in oil exploration and production. Such opportunities are possible in areas of
human development (health and education) and support to building the capacity for petroleum policy
and management. They will be conditional on the successful implementation of the PRMC.

41. 
Economic and Sector Work (ESW). Regarding ESW, IDA is supporting, through IDF
grants, the preparation of a full PRSP, PERs in education and health, and sectoral and econoric
analytical work in the areas of civil service reform, planning and budgeting of public expenditure, and
public utilities tarification. Beyond this, no other economic and sector work is envisaged for Sao Tome
and Principe, given the limited administrative resources and the need for selectivity. For
macroeconornic updating, IDA will rely on the IMF. However, the proposed Public Resource
Management Credit will finance a Study Fund to carry out policy reform studies (trade liberalization,
tax system, PERs, fiscal reform); sectoral strategies (diversification of agriculture production, tourism,
fisheries, public utilities, private sector development, banking and financial sector reform, transport,
education and health); and simulation models. In addition, the Study Fund will also finance staff
training and contribute to the operating cost of a Petroleum Authority Unit.

42. 
Policy Dialogue. Bank and IMF staffs have supported the Government's efforts to strengthen
macroeconomic management and future growth prospects. During the period 1999/2000, Bank/lMF
joint missions reviewed economic developments in the recent years and assisted the Govemment in
preparing macro and structural policy reforms needed to enhance Sao Tome and Principe's prospects
for growth and social development. The Government of Sao Tome and Principe agrees with the
recommendations of the WB/AMF missions and has begun to implement measures under the IMF-
PRGF. This form of assistance will continue during 2000-05.

43. Capacity Building. All IDA projects in Sao Tome and Principe have included components of
institutional development. The Bank has also granted Sao Tome and Principe eight IDFs and a PPIAF
aimed at building local institutional capacity in the area of economic management. In addition, the

12 

Sdo Tome and Principe CAS

IMF, AfDB, UNDP, EU, France and Portugal are providing Sao Tome and Principe with technical
assistance aimed at developing local institutional capacity at the macro and sectoral levels.

44. Role of Donors and Aid Coordination. The Government's overall aid coordination in Sao
Tom6 and Principe is weak. IDA has worked closely with UNDP in supporting the Geneva Round
Table Meeting. This took place on October 5-6, 2000. In the meantime, UNDP is planning to
organize local donor meetings on the health sector, population issues and capacity building. IDA is
working closely with other donors in the design and implementation of their assistance programs for
Sao Tome and Principe: with the EU in the areas of structural adjustment, infrastructure and capacity
building; with the AfDB in the area of poverty reduction and poverty analysis; with IFAD in the area of
land reform in the agriculture sector; with France in the area of economic management and rural
services; with Norway in the area of oil policy; and with Portugal in the areas of human resource
development and poverty reduction. Taiwan, China, has emerged, since early 1998, as the largest aid
donor to Sao Tome and Principe. An understanding reached between the two governments provides
for possible annual assistance to Sao Tom6 and Principe of the order of US$10 million equivalent per
year.

45. 
Sao Tome and Principe is on a bi-annual consultation cycle with the IMF; the latest Article IV
Consultation report was discussed by the IMF Board in April 28, 2000. The IMF Board also approved
in April 28, 2000, a three-year arrangement under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF).

46. Risks. The main risk is that the proposed reform agenda encounters resistance and incites
social unrest, particularly in the period leading up to the 2001 presidential election. Other risks are
posed by low insfitutional capacity, limited donors' commitment and lack of coordination and a narrow
private sector. Declining export earnings, and protracted negotiations with Nigeria on the delimitation
of the maritime border could distract the Government's attention away from the reform agenda. That
could lead to partial implementation of the program, or to excessive delays or even policy reversals,
particularly if recovery of the economy is slower than expected. To manage these risks, the
Government plans to: (i) hamess the support of the political parties, the business community, labor
unions, NGOs and the population at large, as it did during the successfil preparation of the I-PRSP; (ii)
strengthen donor coordination including, holding a Donor Round Table meeting in October 2000; and
(iii) develop local institutional capacity.
