SUMMARY

1. Comoros is in the stages of transition to greater political stability and improved economic
management. The country needs foreign financial and technical assistance and has asked the
Bank to help provide, mobilize, and coordinate this assistance. This Interim Support Strategy
(ISS) reports on recent developments and proposes an interim Bank strategy for the next 12
months. During this interim period, Comoros' performance will be monitored closely and
assessed against specific benchmarks. At the end of the period, given satisfactory performance,
this ISS will be replaced by a full-fledged country assistance strategy (CAS).

2. 
The Islamic Federal Republic of Comoros consists of three islands: Grande Comore,
Anjouan and Moheli. The country has faced prolonged political instability and weak governance.
In 1997, Anjouan seceded from the other islands. Building on intensive efforts by the
Organization of African Unity for national reunification, an inter-island conference was held in
April 1999 in Madagascar, resulting in an agreement on a new Union and a large measure of
autonomy to each island. Only Grande Comore and Moheli signed the agreement; Anjouan's
refusal to sign led to unrest and riots culminating in a bloodless army coup in Grand Comore and
Moheli on April 30, 1999. In August 2000, the de facto Government, headed by Colonel Azali,
signed a joint declaration with the Anjouanese separatists calling for reunification. Elections
have been promised for the near future and, even though uncertainties remain, there is ground for
cautious optimism.

3. 
Comoros' economy remains depressed: real GNP per capita has been declining since 1995,
and poverty is increasing. The government continues to face difficulties in fulfilling its basic
public obligations, including paying teachers, health workers and other civil servants in a timely
manner, and servicing debt regularly. Government has attempted to address the most immediate
budgetary problems: payment arrears to civil servants have been reduced and arrears to IDA
have been settled. However, serious cash flow problems remain, preventing the Government
from spending adequately in the social sectors, paying civil wages on time, and undermining
future public expenditures, such as the reintegration of military personnel into civilian life.

4. 
Comoros is currently in a base case scenario, and would remain so as long as: (i) the
socioeconomic environment is suitable for development work, (ii) satisfactory portfolio
performance is maintained, and (iii) progress towards decentralization of the management of
World Bank projects is made. Lending would include a US$10 million Infrastructure and
Decentralization project; non-lending services would involve assistance to the government to
define a development vision for Comoros and preparation of an IDF grant for institutional
capacity building.

i

5. 
Comoros would enter a high case scenario with (i) substantial progress in public
management on all three islands, (ii) agreement on an integrated budget for the three islands, and
(iii) evidence of Government transfers to, and Government expenditures in, Anjouan. This would
require tangible and decisive progress towards national reconciliation. Under this scenario, the
Bank would proceed with a US$5 million Economic Recovery Credit, in addition to the lending
and non-lending services of the base case. A low case scenario would arise from a return to
conflict, making implementation of the current program problematic. In that event, preparation
of the Infrastructure and Decentralization project would be suspended. Conditions permitting, the
Bank would continue to supervise the existing portfolio as long as government continued to meet
its debt service obligations to the Bank.

ii

A. THE POLITICAL SITUATION

Background

1. 
The Islamic Federal Republic of Comoros comprises three islands in the Indian Ocean
(Grande Comore, Anjouan and Moheli). It is a small state with a population of about 540,000: of
which 55% live in Grand Comore, 40% in Anjouan and 5% in Moheli. A fourth island of the
archipelago, Mayotte, has remained under French administration. GNP per capita is estimated at
US$350 in 1999, down from about US$520 in the late 1980s.

2. 
Comorian politics have been characterized by the presence of a large number of political
parties and factions, and a lack of consensus. Even at independence in 1974, the archipelago was
divided when Grande Comore, Anjouan and Moheli voted 96% for independence while Mayotte
voted 64% against. Political instability has haunted Comoros with mercenary-supported
governments and a number of military coups.

3. Dissatisfaction with the management of the country and declining living standards led to
the secession of Anjouan in 1997. An inter-island conference was held under the auspices of the
the Organization of African Unity (OAU) in April 1999 in Antananarivo. Agreement was
reached between Grande Comore and Moheli on a new Union which would grant a large
measure of autonomy to the three islands.

4. Anjouan's refusal to sign the Antananarivo agreement and the country's deteriorating
economy led to riots and unrest in Grand Comore and prompted the army to intervene and take
power in a bloodless coup on April 30, 1999. This coup led to the dissolution of the constitution
and all state institutions. The chief of staff, Colonel Azali Assoumane, proclaimed himself
president, prime minister, and defense minister. On May 6, 1999, a 'Charte Constitutionelle'
(replacing the Constitution) was proclaimed by Colonel Azali.

Hopes for reconciliation

5. As the crisis eased, in December 1999, Colonel Azali named a civilian prime minister and
a civilian Government was named with the support of 22 out of 30 political parties. Also in
December 1999, several governments in the region issued an ultimatum to the Anjouan
separatists to sign the Antananarivo Agreement or face sanctions. The secessionist leaders
responded by organizing a referendum which rejected the agreement. However, this result was
not recognized by any external party, as no one was allowed on the island to explain the
agreement. The OAU and regional neighbors responded by imposing an embargo on Anjouan.

6. After intense negotiations during July/August 2000, the government signed a joint
declaration with the Anjouanese rebels on August 26. The declaration calls for a reunification of
the country with large degree of autonomy for each island. It provides for a transition period
during which detailed agreements will be reached on new institutions and a constitution. The
agreement also calls for elections on the entire national territory.

but uncertainties remain...

7. 
The declaration also asks the OAU to end the embargo. However, the OAU has thus far
not accepted the joint declaration, and the embargo is still in place, although difficult to enforce.
The opposition led by former Prime Minister Abbas Djousouf is very active and is able to
express its views through its newspaper as well as privately-owned television and radio stations.
Although they have demanded Colonel Azali's removal, they do not agree themselves on a
government to replace the present one. Risks of further instability exist, as demonstrated by a
failed coup attempt against Colonel Azali in March 2000.

Signs of improved economic performance and political dynamics provide window of
opportunity

8. 
In spite of these remaining uncertainties, recent events have created a new dynamic which
promises to break the political impasse and provide the basis for a renewed role of the Bretton
Woods institutions. There are tangible signs that Government is improving its economic
management, although the situation is precarious. Arrears to IDA have been paid and civil
servants are being paid on a more regular basis. Poverty reduction is becoming the unifying
theme underlying Government's efforts at improving economic management. Worsening health
and overall social conditions in Anjouan are placing increasing pressure on the secessionist
administration and neighboring countries to compromise on the terrns for national reunification.
Colonel Azali's government is well aware that it has a narrow window of opportunity for
delivering on the political and social expectations of the Comorian population and on its
expressed commitment to a timely return to political normalcy and establishment of democratic
institutions.

9. 
These promising developments are leading key external partners (the UN System, the EU,
France) to start a cautious reactivation of their programs in order to be ready to support the
country's national reconciliation and economic recovery efforts when developments permit. The
IMF and the Bank, are expected to play a leading role in this endeavor.

B. MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND THE GOVERNMENT PROGRAM

10. Comoros is a subsistence economy. Foreign exchange earnings stem from exports of
cloves, vanilla, perfume essence, private transfers from the Comorian community living abroad,
and official transfers. Comoros is part of the French franc zone and the Comorian franc (CF) is
pegged to the French Franc. In 1994, the CF devalued by 30% while the other currencies of the
franc zone devalued by 50% in foreign currency terms. This devaluation was not accompanied
by appropriate macroeconomic and structural policies; as a result, the gains in competitiveness
attained in 1994 were eroded and the economy continues to be plagued by high production costs,
slow growth and chronic fiscal deficits.

The Short-Run: Recession and a Fiscal Crisis

11. 
Following stagnant economic growth in 1998, real GDP is estimated to have decreased by
1.4% in 1999. Tourism was hard hit by political instability and the occupancy rate in major

2

tourist hotels dropped to below 50%. However, as a result of higher clove prices, greater export
earnings from vanilla and increased private transfers, the current account balance (including
official transfers) improved from a deficit of 9.4% of GDP in 1997 to a surplus of 0.1% in 1999.
The rate of inflation stabilized at around 4%.

12. The economy is not expected to improve in 2000. Investment levels are low reflecting
continued political uncertainty. Production costs are very high, partly due to high transport
costs. Shortages of key commodities such as petroleum occur from time to time. A satisfactory
enabling environment for private entrepreneurs does not yet exist. Domestic economic activity is
expected to remain depressed.

13. The fiscal situation reflects a history of chronic problems. Budgetary authorizations for
domestically financed current expenditures largely surpass available resources. Total government
revenue in 1999 was some 10% below 1997 levels mainly due to lagging payments by public
enterprises. As a member of the Franc Zone, Comoros faces rigid fiscal constraints and the
government's ability to borrow from the banking system to finance the deficit is limited. As a
result, Government resorts to the accumulation of arrears to finance its expenditures. At end-
1999, accumulated wage arrears were about twice the annual wage bill and external arrears
reached US$58 million.

14. Social conditions are expected to continue to be poor: life expectancy at birth is 60 years,
infant mortality rate is 63 per thousand, the fertility rate is 4.5; the net primary school enrollment
rate is 50%, and only about 48% of children under the age of one are immunized against
prevalent childhood diseases. Although the budget provides a "safety net" covering primary

3

education and basic health care, required social expenditures were not made due to persistent
public finance difficulties. Successive governments have been unable to deliver social services to
the population. Only 50% of the budgeted amount for education and health was spent, mostly to
pay wages and salaries. The rate of execution of non-wage expenditures in the social sectors was
particularly low at around 25-30%.

15. Since taking office in April 1999, the government has worked hard to restore fiscal
discipline and improve governance. It has taken measures to strengthen revenue collection, cut
non-priority expenditures, and clean-up irregularities in the management of civil service
personnel. With these efforts, payments of civil servant salaries have become more regular. In
January 2000, the government was able to settle all IDA arrears accumulated from mid-1998.
This enabled the Bank to lift the suspension of IDA disbursements and resume project activities
in key social sectors.

16. The FY2000 budget is proving to be a major challenge. Despite an expected increase in
revenue, resulting from recent government efforts to strengthen revenue collection, current
spending plans would result in a financing requirement of about US$10-12 million or 5.5% of
GDP. The main problem in public finance in Comoros is the high share of revenue that is spent
on personnel costs. The civil service now includes 6,200 workers, and the government may need
to consider further staff reductions in order to bring the wage bill to a more manageable level. It
is also considering more cuts in expenditures on goods and services in low-priority sectors.

Government Program: Medium-Term Reconstruction and National Reconciliation

17. The government recognizes the importance of reconstruction and reconciliation. It has
developed an 18-month program with an overarching objective of restoring economic,
institutional, and political stability. The program is built on one of the country's most valuable
assets - strong local community solidarity - by placing emphasis on increased participation of
communities in the reconstruction development efforts. The government hopes that the program
will attract support from all three islands and thus help advance national reconciliation. The
program has three pillars: (i) improvement of social services and living conditions for the poor;
(ii) economic growth; and (iii) improvement in governance and decentralization.

18. 
Improvement of social services and living conditions for the poor. Given widespread
poverty in Comoros and difficult living conditions, the government program focuses on poverty
reduction and the social sectors. Although no reliable data are available to quantify the increases
in poverty, the decline of the economy, shortages of essential commodities and the Anjouan
conflict have all had negative effects on the living standards of Comoros' population. 
In
addition, cholera is reported to have spread rapidly in Anjouan (over 2000 cases were reported in
Anjouan versus 100 in Grand Comore in 1999). Under these difficult circumstances, the
population of Comoros has shown strong community solidarity in providing a traditional social
safety net at the community level, in particular on the island of Grand Comore. Officially
recorded private transfers from the Comorian community living overseas have also increased by
18% from 1997 to 1999. In the framework of its poverty reduction program, the government has
developed priority actions and investments in the areas of water supply, health, education, and
rural and community development. 
Its program also includes efforts to develop traditional

4

activities such as vanilla, cloves and ylang-ylang, expand sources of income for the poor in the
fishing and live-stock sectors, and tackle youth and unemployment issues.

19. Economic growth. Achieving economic growth and expanding opportunities is a key
government objective. Hence, the program includes actions to (i) encourage private sector
investment in productive activities and in export crops diversification; and (ii) rationalize tax and
custom administration. At the same time, the government plans investment in key infrastructure
sectors to remove some of the bottlenecks facing the private sector.

20. 
Improvement in governance and decentralization. The government has undertaken
measures to strengthen fiscal discipline, cut current expenditures, and implement public
enterprise reforms (some progress is being made in the privatization of air transport and port
services). Authorities have consolidated all government revenues collected by various technical
ministries in the exercise of their duties. These revenues are now deposited in Treasury accounts,
and the transparency of their use is being monitored. One of the government's main priorities is
to strengthen judicial capacity to increase the autonomy and enforceability of the legal and
judicial system.

Priorities and Financing of the Government Program

21. The three pillars of the government program are the basis of the country's development
priorities which have been worked out in consultation with civil society and donors. The
objectives are to (i) select only high priority projects in social infrastructure and services and
present them to donors for financing; and (ii) encourage private sector involvement in financing
projects and activities in productive and commercial sectors. The core reconstruction program is
shown in Table 2 and amounts to around US$48 million. The EU has pledged some US$16
million under Lome 8. The balance is to be mobilized from donors, particularly France.

22. The Bank would help finance some projects and activities of the government's core
priority program in the context of the existing portfolio in health, social funds, education,
agriculture services, and small enterprise development. A new Bank project currently under
preparation, Infrastructure and Decentralization, would address the country's needs 
in
infrastructure/water and provide support to the country's decentralization process. The
government is approaching other donors, both bilateral and multilateral, to help finance its
reconstruction and national program. Although some donors have not yet confirmed their
pledges, they have expressed interest in providing grant financing in support of a lean and sound
national program.

C. DONOR COORDINATION AND PARTNERSHIPS

23. Good donor coordination is important to mitigate risks and ensure maximum synergy
among different programs. The Commonwealth-World Bank Task Force on Small States
identified this as a particularly challenging area for small states in its report of April 2000.
Accordingly, the Bank is working very closely with the IMF, EU, UNDP, and Comoros' largest
bilateral partner, France, in support of government efforts to provide basic social services and lay
the basis for sustainable growth and poverty reduction. Together with the Bank, other key donors
have expressed strong interest in resuming their assistance to Comoros. The European Union is
reactivating the remaining funds under Lome 8. EU projects include the Ports of Moheli and
Moheni, sanitation, roads, and election support. France is considering the renewal of its
assistance in various social programs and other key economic sectors. UNDP and other UN
agencies continue their assistance in humanitarian and social activities. After two years of
interruption due to political instability and disruptions in the civil service, the IMF resumed
Article IV consultations in March 2000.

D. MODALITIES OF BANK SUPPORT

Overview: High Risk Callingfor an ISS

24. There are four reasons to support Bank resumption of activities in Comoros despite the
existing political uncertainties and high risk: (1) the government has demonstrated commitment
to improving economic management and governance. Recognizing improved tax collections, the
recent IMF Article IV mission nevertheless recommended fiscal reforms and implementation of
a structural adjustment program once the political environment stabilizes; (2) poverty and
inadequate social services in Comoros are major problems and the Bank is in a position to
support local communities who are mobilizing to improve their standards of living; (3) the
Bank's involvement in Comoros could help support the process of national reconciliation; and
(4) the government has settled IDA arrears despite its cash flow problems.

25. Comoros has a de facto government as defined in OP 7.30. As the government is in
effective control of two of the three islands which constitute the Comoros Republic, existing
operations can be implemented as long as the government meets its debt service obligations to
the Bank. Furthermore, new loans would not expose the Bank to additional political risks as
current conditions permit project implementation on the two islands. Other countries and
international organizations have informally recognized or dealt with the current de facto
government.

26. The volatile political situation and continued conflict do not make it feasible to develop a
three-year Country Assistance Strategy (CAS). Therefore, as an alternative, an exceptional
interim strategy covering the next 12 months is proposed. The Bank's involvement would take
the form of a graduated response to government progress in implementing economic reforms,
improving governance and resolving the political impasse which divides the nation. During this
period, the Bank would focus on:

6

.

portfolio management to support projects in the social sectors (health care, HIV/AIDS,
family planning, and primary education) and community development;
* modification of the infrastructure project already under preparation to emphasize rapid
rehabilitation of social facilities and decentralization;
* capacity building, decentralization, and general improvements in governance; and
* 
in the event of political reconciliation, and improved budgetary management a quick
disbursing Emergency Recovery Credit (ERC) could be considered to finance institutional
development and the budgetary requirements of reconciliation.

Portfolio Implementation: The Bank's Initial Response to Improved Conditions in Comoros

27. The Bank currently has five projects in its portfolio for a total commitment of
US$33.6 million equivalent and undisbursed balances of US$26.4 million, supporting social
sectors, private sector development, and agriculture services. Two of these projects (Pilot
Agricultural Services and Small Enterprise Development) are in their final implementation
stages and are expected to close by end-December 2000 and end-June 2001 respectively. Two of
the remaining three were approved during FY98 and were waiting for the respective conditions
of effectiveness to be fulfilled when a general suspension of disbursements was declared on
August 15, 1998 due to failure by the country to meet its debt service obligations to IDA. One,
Health, was declared effective on June 6, 2000. The Social Fund has been effective since the end
of 1997 and is now expected to be implemented without further delay. Education III was also
declared effective on June 23, 2000.

28. The World Bank suspension of disbursements was lifted effective January 6, 2000
following settlement by the government of payment arrears. Although this two-year suspension
has adversely affected the actual performance and performance ratings of the Comoros portfolio,
it should be noted that the country has shown a good track record of implementation of Bank-
financed projects, with high levels of ownership and contribution by beneficiaries and
communities offsetting chronic problems associated with delayed or insufficient provision of
counterpart funds by the government. The most recent projects were designed taking these
factors into account and have shown a remarkable degree of resilience during this extended
period of disbursement suspension, although some project teams will have to be reconstituted.

7

Reactivating this portfolio and restructuring it to adapt to the realities of a country emerging
from a protracted conflict are key aspects of the Bank's response to Comoros' current needs.
Effective implementation of existing projects is crucial to reach the objective of improving the
economic and social welfare of the Comorian people.

29. To this end, a Country Portfolio Performance Review (CPPR) was held in March 2000,
which also served as a backdrop to initial discussions with the Comorian authorities on their
national reconciliation and reconstruction strategies. The CPPR, which was well prepared and
attended (representatives of the civil society and donor community participated), confirmed that
the objectives of the existing projects are still broadly valid and in line with current priorities.
The need for fine-tuning these objectives, further simplification of programs and implementation
arrangements, and improved coordination among agencies with overlapping responsibilities was
recognized in a number of cases. A detailed plan of action for the next 12 months for each
project was agreed upon and follow up actions were implemented, with Bank concurrence and
support in May and July 2000. These included specific actions to: (i) accelerate disbursement of
operating projects; (ii) restructure projects that are not performing well, re-design activities in
line with the current country situation, and reallocate funds where necessary; (iii) reconstitute
and strengthen project management teams; and (iv) strengthen financial management and overall
fiduciary aspects.

30. The political uncertainties that are likely to prevail in Comoros call for flexible approaches
to project implementation and rapid responses to changing circumstances. Our dialogue with
Comoros over portfolio implementation issues will be guided by these considerations. Enhanced
supervision will be provided over the next 12 months and the Implementation Team in the
Bank's Madagascar office will play a leading role in these stepped-up supervision and
implementation assistance efforts. A supporting training program has been initiated and will be
amplified. The Bank has agreed to extend its cost sharing arrangements agreed under the Social
Fund project to other projects in the portfolio.

31. A sizable share (about 30-40%) of activities provided under the existing portfolio is
intended to support poverty reduction community-based activities in Anjouan. The government
agrees that these community-oriented activities should proceed to the extent possible. NGOs
have been able to keep some high-priority assistance programs running. Steps have been
undertaken in each project to decentralize project management to the three islands with a central
coordinating body to channel project funds down to the regional project implementation units.
Where implementation cannot proceed, the government has proposed, and the Bank has agreed,
that existing provisions for activities in Anjouan be kept and the situation reconsidered as part of
the periodic reviews to be carried out between the government and the Bank under the ISS.

Base Case in the ISS: Meeting Comoros' Highest Priorities

Lending

32. Under the base case, the current scenario in the country, IDA would also support the
government's program through a new investment loan to fund key infrastructure and support
decentralization. This new credit of US$10 million would be a modified version of the

8

infrastructure, water, and environment project that was already under preparation. This project
would be an integral part of a multi donor-financed program in the Comoros, supporting the
development objectives of the larger program. The main program objective is to improve living
conditions and stimulate economic growth, while preserving the environment and public
investments in basic infrastructure. Focusing on three sectors (transport, water, and urban), the
specific objectives of the project are to: (i) maintain road infrastructure and open up isolated
villages; (ii) improve the safety of roads; (iii) establish sustainable water use guidelines and
significantly increase water coverage rates for populations of the three islands by 2002; and (iv)
improve decentralized management of transport, water, and municipal infrastructure through
public awareness campaigns, stakeholder participation, cost-recovery measures, and targeted
support to public sector institutions. The project would seek to decentralize project management
and promote increased community and private sector participation in the implementation of the
various components of the project and in the management of road maintenance and water supply.

33. 
In order to deal with the situation in Anjouan and subject to the outcome of negotiations
with Comoros, the Development Credit Agreement (DCA) of the Infrastructure and
Decentralization Project would include (i) a separate disbursement category for Anjouan in the
disbursement table, (ii) a disbursement condition under which no disbursement would be made
under the Anjouan disbursement category unless the project could be supervised in Anjouan, and
(iii) a provision under which IDA would be able to cancel the amount under the Anjouan
disbursement category if one year after project effectiveness, no project activity has been
initiated in Anjouan.

Non-Lending Services: Helping Develop a Vision for the Future

34. The government has requested Bank collaboration in preparing a Country Economic
Memorandum (CEM) which would help develop a vision for the country's long-term
development, key constraints to achieving this vision, and the necessary policy reforms and
investment. This exercise would provide the analytical underpinnings for future reform programs
in Comoros. It would identify key sources of growth, the constraints to growth and policies to
deal with those constraints. The Bank would also initiate technical assistance in public sector
management at the central government level, the decentralized administrations, and in the key
social sectors.

35. Following consultations with the government on its most pressing needs, the country team
has requested an Institutional Development Fund (IDF) Grant as a mechanism to provide
technical assistance to support the Government in: (i) public expenditure management (including
needs assessment, collecting and analyzing statistical data); (ii) assistance on its national
development strategy; and (iii) coordinating donor aid. Specifically, the IDF Grant would
finance support in strengthening of its national development strategy, improving donor
coordination and designing its public investment program.

High Case in the ISS: Budgetary Support - Emergency Recovery Credit (ERC)

36. During an initial period, reconciliation will imply increased budgetary cost. There will be
costs associated with the demobilization of military personnel and their reinsertion into civilian

9

life. Bringing social services in Anjouan to the standard of the other islands will also entail
additional budgetary costs. Given Comoros' very difficult budgetary situation, a strong case
could be made for flexible IDA resources to permit the recovery and reconciliation effort to be
financed during the interim period. With appropriate burden sharing, an Emergency Recovery
Credit (ERC) of around US$5 million with additional resources from France and the EU could
be put in place to assist the authorities in bringing about reconciliation and financing the
associated costs.

Risks

37. There can be no sustainable growth and poverty reduction in Comoros without a solution
to the separatist crisis and a move to a broadly accepted government. Hence the greatest risk to
the proposed strategy is political. The risk is compounded by the fact that the Bank's engagement
in Comoros at this time could be viewed as a support to the status quo - separatism and lack of a
broadly accepted government. Bank staff has been addressing this problem in two ways. First,
the ISS is being discussed very widely in Comoros including with opposition leaders, private
entrepreneurs, labor leaders and representatives of Anjouan. Second, Bank staff have made it
clear to the government and civil society that a resolution of the present political crisis, including
measures towards better governance and greater participation, are prerequisites for a continued
high level of Bank support beyond the transition period.

38. A second risk is that government will lack the commitment or capacity to sustain the
economic recovery effort. This risk will be mitigated by systematic monitoring by both Bretton
Woods institutions and a careful phasing of assistance to correspond with demonstrated progress
by the government towards economic reform and improved management.

39. Finally, the Infrastructure and Decentralization project would constitute an important
contribution to economic recovery and the provision of vital social services. It provides
substantial incentives for reconciliation as an appropriate share will be allocated to Anjouan
should it rejoin the other two islands. This project is supported by a unified donor community
including France, the EU, the UNDP, and other International Financial Institutions (IFI).

40. The direction, nature, and extent of Bank support during the interim period will depend on
the political and security situation countrywide and on Comoros' economic performance. The
triggers for moving between scenarios are laid out in Table 4. The implementation of the ISS
would be reviewed approximately every six months.

= Retum to conflict or an increase in conflict renders 
implementation of a coherent program problematic. Focus of 
Bank work would be on supervising the existing portfolio with
emphasis on poverty reduction as long as govemment continued
to meet its debt service obligations to the Bank.

Preparation of all new
operations ceases.

41. The proposed strategy addresses the root economic causes of the conflict, namely

inequitable availability of resources, and seeks to prevent a recurrence of the conflict by assuring
greater participatory decision-making and more balanced resource use. Furthermore, the benefits
in terms of improved services and support for economic recovery will increase the prospects for
political stability.
