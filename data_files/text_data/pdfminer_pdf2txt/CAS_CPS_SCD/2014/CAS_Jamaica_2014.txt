EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

1. 
For over two decades prior to the 2008 global economic slowdown, Jamaica’s 
small, open island economy had been stuck in a cycle of low growth and high debt.  
The country’s high level of public debt and associated high debt service obligations 
resulted in costly risk premiums, crowded out and distorted private sector investment and 
left the country highly vulnerable to shifts in market sentiment. Moreover, like many 
other Caribbean countries, Jamaica suffered recurring natural disaster related shocks that 
exacted heavy tolls on Jamaican households and the economy as a whole.  
2. 
Jamaica was hit hard by the 2008 global financial crisis and economic 
slowdown, which exposed large vulnerabilities that had been building up for several 
years. Real GDP declined by 1.6 percent in FY2008/09, with economic conditions 
deteriorating sharply in the second half of the year and contracted further in 2009/10, 
registering a decline of 3 percent just in the latter half of 2009. Bauxite production and 
exports fell by about 60 percent, while remittances—a traditional source of support to 
households and the balance of payments—declined by 33 percent. 
3. 
The poorest Jamaican households were disproportionately affected by the 
economic contraction. Poverty rose sharply to 17.8 percent, eroding previous progress, 
and disparities in the well-being of households and communities across the country 
increased, particularly between rural and urban areas, leading to weakened social 
cohesion. Households in the lowest two quintiles of the income distribution lost income 
share (contributing to the observed rise in inequality) and unemployment soared.  Overall 
unemployment stands at 16.3 percent versus 9.8 percent in 2007, and youth 
unemployment is now about 30 percent—with about 38 percent of young women 
currently unemployed. 
4. 
Government efforts to stabilize the economy in 2009-11 showed initially some 
positive results but were ultimately inadequate; the failure to address persistent 
fiscal and debt issues, coupled with the impact of Hurricane Sandy in October 2012, 
led to a crisis of confidence by early 2013. The Government prepared and entered into a 
Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) with the IMF in 2010, but the program was interrupted just 
a year or so later due to missed fiscal targets.  In turn, the cancellation of the SBA, and 
the consequent cessation of official flows to Jamaica, contributed to a crisis of 
confidence, fuelling an increase in already rising interest rates and a significant 
depreciation of the Jamaican dollar, thus compromising Jamaica’s ability to refinance the 
large public debt.  
5. 
Recognizing that reversing Jamaica’s trajectory requires wide-ranging and 
deep reforms, the Government of Jamaica (GoJ) has embarked on a comprehensive 
and ambitious program of fiscal adjustment and structural changes for which it has 
garnered national and international support. In May 2013, the GoJ and IMF reached 
agreement on an Extended Fund Facility (EFF) for SDR 615.4 million (about US$932.3 
million) covering April 2013 to March 2017. The first and second reviews of the EFF 
program, which supports debt restructuring, fiscal consolidation, and financial sector 
reforms, were successfully completed in September and December 2013 respectively, 
demonstrating the GoJ’s serious commitment to the reform agenda. Complementing the 

i 

 
 
IMF program, the World Bank Group (WBG) and the Inter-American Development Bank 
(IDB) are coordinating their assistance around a range of key structural and institutional 
reforms aimed at laying the foundations for growth and competitiveness, and 
strengthening social protection, public sector management, and resilience. Although the 
fiscal consolidation included in the program will inevitably constrain growth outcomes in 
the short-term, vigorous implementation of the reforms should help build conditions for 
economic recovery, growth and greater shared prosperity in the medium term (especially 
if accompanied by strategic investments).  
6. 
In the above context, the overall aim of this Country Partnership Strategy 
(CPS) for FY14–17 is to support Jamaican efforts to help build the conditions for 
sustained and inclusive growth. The strategy’s design recognizes that Jamaica is 
presently at a juncture where decisive actions to achieve fiscal consolidation and stabilize 
the economy in the short term must be paired with equally critical structural reforms in 
order to move to a path of growth, reduced poverty, and enhanced shared prosperity. The 
CPS program is concentrated in three strategic thematic areas: (i) public sector 
modernization; (ii) enabling environment for private sector growth; and, (iii) social and 
climate resilience. The CPS areas of focus were identified through a selectivity filter 
aimed at maximizing impact. Selectivity criteria focused on areas that: (i) address binding 
constraints to Jamaica’s development agenda and where government demand and 
commitment are strong; (ii) align fully with the WBG’s comparative advantage; and (iii) 
have the highest likely influence on poverty reduction and shared prosperity.  
7. 
The total financing envelope for the program is US$510 million, to cover a 
series of Development Policy Operations (DPOs) and selective new investment 
operations focused on creating conditions for growth and resilience. For quicker results in 
protecting the poor and vulnerable, the CPS scales up successful interventions in social 
protection, early childhood development and community development 
through 
Additional Financing. With an active portfolio of US$262 million, and the authorization 
to leverage up to US$500 million in local capital markets, IFC investments and advisory 
services will target infrastructure, financial sector, small and medium enterprises (SMEs) 
and growth-related sectors. MIGA will continue to facilitate FDI and private sector 
development, offering its traditional political risk insurance products across all sectors, 
with a focus on infrastructure, energy, agribusiness and other growth related sectors. A 
joint business plan (IBRD/IFC/MIGA, government and private sector) will support 
implementation of the CPS’s second thematic area: enabling environment for private 
sector growth. The program will also benefit from strong coordination with other 
development partners. Despite relatively large front-loading, the program provides 
flexibility in the mix of instruments and interventions to allow adaptation to changing 
circumstances. 
8. 
Risks associated with this CPS are high, particularly in light of Jamaica’s 
variable track record on macro and structural reforms. The country is entering a 
demanding transition period, where tough reforms may result in significant adjustment 
costs before they yield results in terms of growth acceleration, improvements in shared 
prosperity, and poverty reduction. However, the potential rewards in terms of accelerated 
poverty reduction and opportunity for growth are also high and the GOJ’s recent actions 
to tackle tough issues and build broad public support bode well for successful 

ii 

 
implementation. The three types of risks that could affect successful implementation of 
the CPS are: (i) macroeconomic, the interruption of reforms also due to new exogenous 
shocks (economic or natural, including lack of FDI for critical projects) could result in a 
still unstable macroeconomic framework; (ii) governance and political, if growth is slow 
to materialize, the political capital of the government to support the heavy reform agenda 
could weaken further; and, (iii) capacity, with the capacity to support the reform agenda 
stretched to its limit, the government may not be able to operationalize fully some of the 
reforms also slowing down the overall reform program.  
9. 
To address capacity deficiencies, the WBG program will be accompanied by 
technical assistance in critical reform areas to build capacity and will include 
vulnerability management as a key area of engagement. Although risks cannot be 
entirely mitigated, they are reduced to some degree by GoJ’s recognition that the country 
is at a turning point and by its actions to date vis a vis upfront implementation of a 
number of difficult reforms, establishment of supervisory arrangements to ensure high-
level attention to the reform agenda, and the unprecedented social compact it has 
established with key stakeholders to maintain broad support for the reform program. 
Most of the reforms that are being undertaken aim at addressing supply side bottlenecks 
to growth in a challenging global environment and uncertain demand response, exposing 
Jamaica to risks of a delayed growth pick-up and underscoring the importance of 
sustaining the reform effort. Notwithstanding these risks, the successful implementation 
of the WBG program could help Jamaica to create conditions to bring the country back 
on the path to growth, reversing the negative trajectory of economic stagnation, rising 
poverty and inequality.

10. 
For 
decades, 
Jamaica 
has 
struggled with low growth, high public 
debt and a number of external shocks 
that further weakened the economy. 
Over the last 30 years real per capita GDP 
increased at an average of just 1 percent 
per year, making Jamaica one of the 
slowest growing developing countries in 
the world. Weak macroeconomic 
discipline and poor policy choices eroded 
competitiveness and resulted in economic 
stagnation. Rising fiscal deficits hampered 
the ability of the Government of Jamaica 
(GoJ) to respond to periodic external 
shocks including natural disasters, creating 
a vicious cycle of high debt and low growth which has persisted over the years. Jamaica 
was hit hard by the global financial crisis, as bauxite revenues plummeted, Foreign 
Direct Investments (FDI) and remittances declined, and the economy contracted by 1.9 
percent on average per annum between 2009 and 2011. This contributed to the debt to 
GDP ratio rising to 146.2 percent by end-March 2013, making Jamaica the most highly 
indebted developing country in the world (Figure 1). The debt service ratio averaged 85 
to 90 percent of revenue in recent years, leaving the GoJ with no option but to refinance 
maturing obligations and with very little fiscal space for productive expenditures. 
12. Macro stabilization efforts 
initiated 
in January 2010, 
including an 
International Monetary Fund (IMF) Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) and a domestic 
debt exchange, were halted in late 2011. A 27-month IMF SBA included an ambitious 
plan for fiscal consolidation and other policy reforms that included the Jamaica Debt 
Exchange (JDX). Complementing IMF and Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) 
financing, the Bank provided a US$300 million DPL for budget support. The 
Government had initial success with divestment efforts and made progress in the area of 
tax administration, but the program was interrupted in 2011 due to missed fiscal targets in 
the IMF agreement, thus halting official flows to Jamaica, just as interest rates were 
turning upwards and rescheduled payments coming due. 
13. 
Persisting macroeconomic weaknesses, coupled with the impact of Hurricane 
Sandy in October 2012, created a crisis of confidence in early 2013. By February 
2013, the Jamaican dollar had depreciated by 15 percent over 12 months and foreign 
exchange reserves barely hit less than half their level in 2010, compromising Jamaica’s 
ability to service its large debt service payments. The current account deficit had declined 
since 2011, when it hit a peak of 14.8 percent, but remained high at 10 percent of GDP, 
keeping the economy vulnerable and exposed to exogenous shocks.

14. 
In April 2013, the International Financial Institutions (IFIs) agreed on a 
comprehensive package of assistance, comprising an IMF Extended Fund Facility 
(EFF), and financial support from the Bank and the IDB. The GoJ signed the EFF for 
SDR 615.4 million (about US$932.3 million) for the period of April 2013 to March 2017, 
which was approved by the IMF Board on May 1, 2013. The Bank and the IDB each 
allocated US$510 million to Jamaica for the same period. 
15. 
Together, the three IFIs are supporting a set of structural reforms designed 
to stabilize the economy, reduce debt and create the conditions for growth and 
resilience (Figure 2). IMF support focuses on reforms expected to have a more short-
term stabilizing impact, such as debt restructuring, fiscal consolidation, and financial 
sector reforms. The Bank and the IDB are supporting, in close coordination, structural 
and institutional reforms in the areas of competitiveness, social protection, public sector 
management, and resilience. 

Figure 2. An Overview of IFIs supported Reforms in Jamaica 

16. 
Early macro and fiscal reforms adopted by the authorities in 2013 have 
worked to start restoring confidence in the Jamaican economy. In the run up to the 
IMF agreement, three important actions were carried out: (i) a second comprehensive 
domestic debt exchange, which restructured 65 percent of GDP worth of debt and 
contributed to a fall in interest payments from 25.5 percent of revenues and grants in 
FY12/13 to 18.5 percent in FY13/14; (ii) a multiyear wage agreement with trade unions; 
and, (iii) an upfront new tax package that significantly curtailed the use of discretionary 
tax waivers. Since then, the economy has begun a slow path to stabilization as reserve 
losses were contained and the exchange rate, while depreciating slightly, stopped its free 
fall. The fiscal stance improved (Figure 3) as the central government primary surplus 
reached 5.4 percent in FY2012/13 (compared to an average of 3.9 percent for the 
previous two years). The financial sector absorbed the second debt restructuring well,

exposure 
to 
government debt, and did not utilize 
the US$850 million support fund put 
in place at the start of the IMF-
supported program. 
17. 
The pace of reforms has been 
sustained and Jamaica successfully 
completed the IMF Program’s first 
two reviews, 
in September and 
December 2013 respectively. The 
reforms include a demanding fiscal 
consolidation effort, 
targeting an 
annual 7.5 percent primary surplus 
over four years and zero balance for 
public entities. Achieving the fiscal 
targets set in the program will require 
implementing proactive measures for expenditure reduction and revenue enhancement.  
At the end of the EFF third review mission in February 2014, the IMF reiterated that 
policy performance under the EFF remains strong. In February 2014, citing this good 
performance, Moody’s revised the outlook on Jamaica’s government bond rating from 
stable to positive and Fitch from “CCC” to “B-“ with a stable outlook. 
18. 
Fiscal consolidation will improve prospects for debt sustainability, but the 
debt overhang will persist. Apart from the strong fiscal consolidation, bringing the debt-
to-GDP ratio to the levels expected in the IMF-supported program will require the 
implementation of debt for asset swaps and debt guarantee reductions, and the 
implementation of additional measures to underpin a further three percent reduction in 
the debt-to-GDP ratio by 2017. However, despite a reduction in debt service payments as 
a result of debt restructuring, gross financing needs will remain high. The large financing 
needs, coupled with reduced access to domestic markets post debt restructuring, 
underscore the need for official creditors to play a critical role in financing Jamaica this 
fiscal year. 
19. Growth has so far remained elusive. In the short term, growth is expected to 
remain subdued (in the range of 0.5 to 1.5 percent for FY13/14), partly due to the initial 
adverse impact of fiscal consolidation. In addition, growth prospects continue to be 
obstructed by structural challenges affecting productivity and competitiveness. The 
Country Economic Memorandum (CEM) highlights that Jamaica’s disappointing 
economic performance is traceable to low productivity. While Total Factor Productivity 
(TFP) in Jamaica was growing above the world and regional averages in the 1960s, since 
the 1970s performance collapsed despite high investment and has been lagging 
significantly behind most other countries in the LAC region. A combination of: (i) 
weaknesses in human capital and entrepreneurship; (ii) an inadequate business 
environment, (iii) weak public sector management and discretionary tax policies; and (iv) 
poor and inefficient infrastructure, are the main causes for the country’s low productivity, 
and have resulted in low competitiveness and an enclave-based development model 
(especially in tourism and mining) with little spill over to the rest of the economy. 

3 

 
 
20. 
The economic outlook for the medium term is heavily dependent on 
continued progress on the reform agenda. The GOJ has taken encouraging steps 
towards structural reforms, including recent progress on privatization, tax policy reforms, 
investment climate reforms, and efforts to build new infrastructure. This is expected to 
gradually restore 
investors’ confidence, contribute 
to restoring macroeconomic 
fundamentals, and create favorable conditions for economic growth (Table 1). On the 
external front, the recent depreciation of the exchange rate, coupled with the on-going 
fiscal consolidation and monetary restraint, can help improve price competitiveness and 
contribute to narrowing the current account deficit and redirecting domestic savings to 
the private sector.

21. However, downside risks are high. Jamaica is entering a demanding transition 
period, where tough reforms may result in significant adjustment costs before they yield 
results in terms of growth acceleration, improvements in shared prosperity, and poverty 
reduction. Furthermore, most of the reforms that are being undertaken aim at addressing 
supply side bottlenecks to growth in a challenging global environment and uncertain 
demand response—there are risks that FDIs flow is reduced and investments may not 
materialize in critical projects—exposing Jamaica to risks of a delayed growth pick-up 
and underscoring the importance of sustaining the reform effort. At the same time, the 
lack of fiscal space rules out public funding for infrastructure and makes it difficult to 
cushion against exogenous shocks (natural disasters, commodity price fluctuations, and 
changes in global demand) which could derail fiscal consolidation and set-back the 
reform program.

22. 
The impact of the global 
economic crisis reversed Jamaica’s 
advances in reducing poverty and 
lowering inequality. In 2007, the GoJ 
estimated poverty at just under 10 
percent and the official Gini co-
efficient was the lowest in the region 
at 0.38.1 Limited ability to deliver 
high growth and build a diversified 
economy has made 
the country 
vulnerable to global shocks with little 
fiscal capability to shelter the poor 
and vulnerable. Although, good 
quality 
information 
on 
poverty 
determinants and shared prosperity in 
Jamaica is lacking, it is clear that the 
global economic crisis, together with increasing food and energy prices, resulted in a 
significant increase in poverty: the official poverty rate soared to 17.6 percent in 2010, 
and mean household income, particularly of the bottom 40 percent, contracted (Figure 4). 
The crisis impacted strongly external sectors (bauxite in particular). After an impressive 
decrease from 2001 to 2005, unemployment rose from 8 to 14.3 percent between 2006 and 
2012 (April). Remittances from the United States and the United Kingdom decreased, 
especially in 2009. Going forward, improved data quality and further analysis will help 
better understand determinants of poverty.

1 All poverty numbers should be treated with caution since the poverty calculation methodology of Jamaica 
is currently under revision and its data quality under scrutiny due to the composition of the consumption 
aggregate used to monitor poverty, as well as the high (and rising) nonresponse rate characterizing the 
Jamaica Survey of Living Conditions (JSLC). In this sense, conducting a shared prosperity analysis may 
have limitations in the short term, since the most important indicators refers to the distribution of 
income/consumption (Sen Welfare Index and Gini) which can only come from living conditions surveys.

23. 
The crisis hit the entire population, but the poor suffered the most, especially 
in rural areas. As international and domestic prices for food and energy increased, the 
bottom 40 percent of the population, for whom food consumption accounts for over 50 
percent of expenditures, was strongly affected. According to official data, most of the 
poor are concentrated in rural areas, where poverty increased the most (from 17 percent 
in 2008 to 23.2 percent in 2010). Today, households in rural areas are bigger, dependency 
ratios higher, unemployment and informal employment more widespread, and education 
levels lower—all characteristics associated with a higher incidence and severity of 
poverty. While lower than in rural areas, poverty rates more than doubled in Kingston 
between 2008 and 2010. 
24. Women have also experienced a particular increase in poverty and 
vulnerability (Annex 5). Female-headed households, which represent 52 percent of 
households in Jamaica, account for 57.6 percent of the poor. Not only is the poverty rate 
higher for female-headed households than for male-headed households but it also rose 
more sharply —to 19.7 in 2010 compared to 13.3 percent in 2008—during the period 
(Figure 5). While the crisis affected both men and women employment strongly, 
unemployment rates have traditionally been higher for women across all age groups (and 
in particular for young women) (Figure 6). In addition, Jamaica’s Gender Inequality 
Index (GII) suggests that women have less access to human development opportunities 
compared to men. The teen pregnancy rate (70 per thousand) is more than twice the 
average for upper middle income countries and gender based violence is prevalent2.

Jamaica’s youth are among the most excluded and vulnerable segments of 
the population. Unemployment is highest among young people aged 15 to 24, where 
almost one in three is unemployed (38 percent of women and 25 percent of men in 
2010).3 Today, it is estimated that 127,000 Jamaican youth are neither in school, nor 
employed, nor on the labor market. As such, these youth are by far the most vulnerable to 
risky and violent behavior. The profile of those directly involved and affected by violent 
crime tends indeed to be young, unskilled, unemployed, and undereducated males aged 
15 to 29 from underserved urban neighborhoods with the highest poverty rates.  

C. CHALLENGES FOR POVERTY REDUCTION AND SHARED PROSPERITY 

26. Weak fiscal management and persisting structural challenges have kept 
Jamaica’s economy trapped in a low-level equilibrium hindering sustainable and 
inclusive growth and poverty reduction. Poor growth performance has occurred in 
spite of political stability since independence in 1962, market-oriented reforms since the 
1980s, and relatively high rates of private investment over the years. As the CEM 
underscored, Jamaica’s growth prospects have indeed been obstructed by structural 
challenges affecting productivity and competitiveness. To make things worse, most 
recently, a series of exogenous shocks has contributed to a decline in private investments 
and a substantive increase in public debt. To rebound, Jamaica needs to address the 
challenges of 
fiscal and debt sustainability, public sector efficiency, weak 
competitiveness, and economic, social and climate vulnerability and pursue policies 
directed at improving poverty reduction efforts.  
Fiscal and Debt Sustainability 
27. 
Trapped in a vicious cycle of low growth, rising public debt, and limited 
fiscal space, Jamaica needs fiscal consolidation and better debt management. In 
general terms, low growth has been a key factor leading to high fiscal deficits in Jamaica. 
The ensuing large borrowing needs have led in turn to financial repression and 
constrained private sector credit, investment and growth. The combination of continuous 
public sector borrowing and low growth has contributed to high and unsustainable debt 
ratios, leading to rising macroeconomic uncertainty. High debt ratios have been 
accompanied by high debt servicing costs which reduce fiscal space and limit the 
authorities’ ability to invest in infrastructure and improve public services that could 
support growth. The ability to invest is curtailed further by a high and inflexible wage 
bill, close to 11 percent of GDP and represents 35 percent of total expenditures, and by 
interest payments that consume another 30 percent of total expenditures. This chain of 
causes and effects creates a vicious cycle that needs to be broken through fiscal 
consolidation and better debt management. 
28. However, fiscal consolidation alone will not eliminate funding needs. The 
program supported by the IFIs is projected to sustain a progressive reduction in the public 
debt to GDP ratio to 122.1 percent of GDP by the end of fiscal year 2016/17 (Figure 7) 
and 99.9 percent of GDP by 2019/20 (Table 1).  However, despite a reduction in debt 
service payments as a result of the debt restructuring, gross financing needs will remain 
high (Figure 8) with about $600 million due in amortization payments in the last quarter 

3 The World Bank Development Data Portal, 2012.

of FY13/14. The large financing needs, coupled with a reduced access to domestic 
markets after debt restructuring, underscore the need for official creditors to play a 
critical role in financing Jamaica in the short term to help address its financing needs and 
to support growth-enhancing investments which are critical to enable Jamaica to move 
out of its current low level equilibrium.

Inefficient Public Sector 
29. Weak tax and custom administrations are an impediment to strengthening 
fiscal management and to private sector investment and growth. In general, the 
private sector and the general public associate public sector operations with excessive 
bureaucracy. Flawed tax and trade policy frameworks and weak institutional capacity in 
tax and customs administration are obstacles to investment in sectors where Jamaica has 
a comparative advantage. The existing tax structure is cumbersome and plagued with 
discretionary waivers which lower tax revenues, create distortions in the allocation of 
capital and decrease the productivity of investment. Addressing these weaknesses will be 
essential to complement ongoing efforts at fiscal consolidation and will contribute to 
create the necessary fiscal space and facilitate increase investments. 
30. 
The operations of public entities, the public pension system, and contingent 
liabilities associated with Jamaica’s high exposure to natural disasters present 
sizable fiscal risks. The budget cycle is a source of inefficiency in Jamaica due to the 
absence of clear alignment between planning and execution, making management of the 
Public Sector Investment Program (PSIP) challenging. The absence of realistic 
measurable indicators for sector programs hampers effective prioritization of public 
current expenditure and investment. Strengthening such functions would foster trust in 
the institutions of the State and provide investors with confidence in a stable and secure 
environment.

Weak Competitiveness 
31. 
Jamaica’s weak investment climate and lack of innovation are hindering 
private sector development and obstructing growth. Jamaica ranks relatively low in 
investment climate related indexes, including the World Bank’s 2014 Doing Business 
Indicators. Key weaknesses include access to affordable energy (Jamaica is ranked 132 of 
189 countries and the average retail tariff is US$0.35/kWh, amongst the highest rates in 
the Caribbean), access to finance (private credit to GDP is 27 percent, well below the 
upper middle-income group average of 48 percent), a distortionary tax regime, and 
ingrained perceptions of corruption (in 2013, Jamaica was ranked 83 out of 177 countries 
in the Transparency International Corruption Perception Index). These constraints, 
combined with low private sector confidence, waning public infrastructure, and lack of 
innovation (Figure 9) are constraining competitiveness and preventing a stronger 
contribution of the private sector to Jamaica’s economy.

32. 
Although Jamaica is a small, open economy that has historically relied on 
trade for a significant share of its GDP, structural obstacles have hindered its export 
performance. Exports, which averaged 35.8 percent of GDP for the period 2003–12, 
have been offset by significantly larger imports, averaging 56.1 percent of GDP over the 
same period. The country has lost competitiveness in traditional products like sugar and 
bananas and has moved to an enclave model implemented through Export Free Zones 
(EFZs) in mining and tourism. The lack of competitiveness is linked to weaknesses in the 
investment climate that enhance the cost of doing business, limited adoption of new 
technologies, low levels of workforce training, and limited availability of specialized 
professional manpower. Furthermore, while EPZs can play a role in attracting FDIs by 
offsetting some aspects of the weak investment climate, spillovers to the rest of the 
economy have been limited thus far.

High Social Vulnerabilities and Risks from Climate Change 
33. 
The Jamaican economy is highly vulnerable to risks, including economic, 
natural disasters, and social risks. Among countries of comparable per capita income, 
Jamaica is one of the countries with 
the 
highest 
percent 
of 
the 
population and GDP at risk (Figure 
10). Economic 
risks 
result, 
in 
addition 
from 
the 
fiscal 
risks 
associated with exchange rate and 
interest rate movements, from the 
costs of: (i) natural hazard risk,4 (ii) 
agricultural production risk; and, 
(iii) import commodity price risk. 
Fiscal expenditure impacts of these 
recurring risks include large policy-
driven contingent liabilities, such as 
the cost of agricultural insurance 
and emergency relief programs, as 
well as implicit liabilities, such as infrastructure rebuilding costs where recovery costs 
have not been explicitly budgeted. Simultaneously, fiscal revenues are negatively 
impacted by shocks through declines in tax revenues related to income, trade, and 
property. In the absence of appropriate buffers, these risks also represent a threat to fiscal 
and debt sustainability. 
34. 
 Natural disasters represent a significant contingent liability for Jamaica, 
with potential high economic and poverty impacts.  More than 96 percent of Jamaica’s 
GDP and population are located in areas at risk to at least two natural hazards, making it 
the third most exposed country in the world to two or more hazards. Over the past 50 
years, Jamaica has gone through a growing number of natural disasters, which have had 
an increasing economic impact on the country, as evidenced by Hurricane Gilbert in 
1988, of which the damages amounted to approximately 65 percent of the GDP. The 
cumulative damage from the last three major storms (Ivan in 2004, Dean in 2007 and 
Gustav in 2008) totaled over US$1 billion. Even the recent Tropical Storm Nicole (2010) 
is estimated to have caused a fiscal cost of 1.9 percent of the GDP. Climate change is 
expected to increase the impact of some of the hazards that already cause significant 
damage. According to the World Bank study, “Sea Level Rise and Storm Surges”5, the 
impact of sea level rise and intensified storm surges in Latin America and the Caribbean 
will be highest in Jamaica with 28.49 percent of the coastal population exposed and 
potential losses of coastal GDP projected to exceed 26.62 percent. In Jamaica as in other 
countries in the region, poor populations are less resilient to natural disasters and they 
suffer larger damages relative to their livelihoods.

35. 
Young people face increasing social risks. The largest segment of the Jamaican 
population is below the age of 25 and the lack of services and opportunities poses a 
serious risk for social and economic development. The limited access to good quality 
basic health and education services for young children from poor households, negatively 
impacts their growth and development opportunities later in life. Lack of investments in 
the early years of childhood can have detrimental effects on growth and productivity later 
in life. Furthermore, high unemployment among youth has created an urgent need for 
skills development, jobs and the development of youth-focused policies and programs. 
Youth marginalization, driven by lack of opportunities and high unemployment, is a 
major social issue with significant links to crime, violence and teenage pregnancy. 
36. 
Despite a strong government effort and a remarkable reduction in homicide, 
violent crime rates remain among the highest in the region. Crime and violence in 
Jamaica6 reflect deep-rooted social and institutional problems, including organized crime, 
general public distrust of the police, incidences of police corruption, and lack of essential 
services and targeted interventions to address underlying risk factors. Crime and violence 
disproportionately impact residents of poor urban communities and crime victims and 
offenders tend to be concentrated among the poorest and among young males (about 90 
percent of murder victims and more than 90 percent of offenders are male). 

II. GOVERNMENT VISION 

37. 
The GoJ has launched a comprehensive program of structural reforms to 
transform the economy. The program aims to ensure macro-economic stability through 
fiscal prudence, address energy sector issues, develop human capital, optimize trade and 
investment, advance justice and national security, resolve environmental and social 
challenges, and implement transformative projects in key areas with growth potential. In 
that context, the GoJ reform plan agreed with the IFIs includes a series of reforms aimed 
at ensuring fiscal sustainability and creating conditions for growth, including through 
investments in energy generation and efficiency, and in a number of sectors driving 
growth and job creation, including logistics, information and communication technology 
(ICT), creative industries, agriculture, and financial services. For GoJ, the development 
of its logistics infrastructure is a national priority which could help Jamaica take 
advantage of its strategic proximity to the Panama Canal whose expansion is expected to 
result in increased trade traffic in the region. Another key initiative is the development of 
ICT and creative industries that could have a significant impact on private sector 
competitiveness while providing jobs for the youth. 
38. 
Reform implementation is supported by a dedicated institutional set up. A 
National Coordination and Implementation Unit charged with monitoring reforms has 
been established. The GoJ also established the Economic Programme Over-sight 
Committee (EPOC) co-chaired by the Bank of Jamaica and the private sector to provide 
oversight and monitoring of the IMF program. A Social Partnership Agreement (SPA)

was signed between the Government and the private sector, trade unions and the civil 
society, and formed a broad coalition around the reform agenda to ensure the 
sustainability of reforms and mitigate against a relapse of political commitment.  
39. 
The Caribbean Growth Forum (CGF) provides a broader platform to engage 
citizens and civil society on reform implementation. Jamaica hosted the launch of the 
CGF in June 2012. Since then, the Government established a CGF National Chapter, and 
engaged more than 200 people from private sector, government and civil society in 
defining 23 key reform priorities in the area of logistics and connectivity, skills and 
productivity and investment climate (Annex 4). The first reporting on implementation 
progress was held in February 2014 in a workshop organized by the Government—
Planning Institute of Jamaica (PIOJ) and Jamaica Promotion Corporation (JAMPRO)— 
in the framework of the Doing Business Roundtable of the National Competitiveness 
Council. 
40. 
The reform program contributes to the implementation of the National 
Development Plan (NDP) “Vision 2030 Jamaica,” which aims to transform Jamaica 
into a developed country by 2030. The Plan, presented at the May 2009 Budget Debate, 
is structured around four national goals: Jamaicans are empowered to achieve their fullest 
potential; the Jamaican society is secure, cohesive and just; Jamaica’s economy is 
prosperous; and Jamaica has a healthy natural environment (Table 2). It seeks to address 
critical development challenges and lay a foundation for inclusive and sustained growth, 
building conditions for increased competitiveness and private sector-led growth. The plan 
also aims to mitigate medium-term social effects of fiscal consolidation, build climate 
resilience, protect social gains while moving toward fiscal and debt sustainability, and 
build social cohesion. Finally, the GoJ recognizes that the failure to implement many 
initiatives in the past was due to a weak institutional structure and is now committed to 
improving the efficiency of the public administration.

III. WORLD BANK GROUP PARTNERSHIP 

A. LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE 2010-2013 CPS 

41. The Jamaica CPS FY2010-2013 Completion Report highlighted a number of 
lessons which were taken into account in the design of the new strategy. Overall, 
the CPS program performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory, as the WBG made 
substantive progress toward key expected outcomes: more than half of the 
quantitative indicators have been reached (or exceeded). 
Lessons from the Completion Report: 
 Stronger focus on helping Jamaica in laying the foundations for economic recovery 
and resumption of growth. While the CPS 2010-2013 areas of engagement remain 
relevant, a sharper focus on increased competitiveness and private sector led growth 
is needed. 
 The WBG contributed noticeably to Jamaica’s human development and social 
cohesion agenda. Building on this and scaling up of successful programs will help 
achieve tangible results in the short term and maximize impact. 
 Program flexibility is critical to provide enough space for adaption and innovation 
in response to Jamaica’s financial and development challenges.  
 The CPS program design needs to be ambitious but realistic about what can be 
accomplished within its time frame in an environment characterized by constrained 
capacity. Integrating more systematically political economy and capacity analysis in 
program design, improving sector and program coordination and realistic timing 
and sequencing of interventions would strengthen achievement of strategic 
outcomes.  
 The combination of IFC and Bank support for reform can achieve significant 
positive long term results. For example, the Air Jamaica privatization is leading to 
fiscal savings equivalent to 1.2 percent of GDP per annum. 
 An efficient monitoring for results system 
is needed 
to support CPS 
implementation.  The CPS result framework should be reviewed systematically as 
part of regular WBG portfolio monitoring in conjunction with the CPPR. Building 
on an improved coordination between WBG, IMF, IDB, EU and bilateral partners, 
further collaborative efforts for joint monitoring of results should be explored. 

B. CONSULTATIONS  

42. 
The CPS capitalizes on a wide-reaching participatory process and close 
coordination with other development partners (Annex 3). The engagement strategy 
supported by the CPS has indeed benefited from the participatory dialogue platform 
provided by the CGF, on which Jamaica embarked in 2012. Furthermore, the CPS has 
benefited from a Country Client Survey (Box 1) and wide consultations and monitoring 
of the on-going stabilization and reform program, including through the SPA and the 
EPOC. The CPS has also benefited from the active involvement of private stakeholders 
through the EPOC, which was established with the objective of introducing greater 
transparency to the Government’s Economic Reform Program while enhancing public 

13 

 
information and confidence. Donor coordination 
has also been strong, especially 
through 
coordination of the international rescue package. 
43. 
A general stakeholder consensus on 
WBG support has been formed in the areas 
of: (i) fiscal management and public sector 
reform; 
(ii) social and climate change 
vulnerabilities; 
and 
(iii) 
growth 
and 
competitiveness. The consultations highlighted 
the need to restore macroeconomic sustainability 
through more effective institutions for fiscal and 
debt management and overall public sector 
modernization, 
and 
to 
support 
growth 
resumption through a stronger private sector and 
more effective investments. Representatives of 
the private sector, civil society, trade unions, 
youth and international development partners 
endorsed the priority areas identified by the 
government and the WBG. Consultations in the 
context of the CGF process (May-August 2013) in partnership with the IDB, the 
Caribbean Development Bank (CDB) and Compete Caribbean presented yet another 
opportunity to reflect on these issues. 

Box 1. Jamaica Country Client Survey 
(2013) 
The 2013 Jamaica Country Client Survey 
(see Annex 6) assessed the relationship 
between the WBG Jamaica Country Team 
and its stakeholders (e.g., private and 
public sectors, academia and civil society). 
With a response rate of 68 percent, the 
most significant finding was the reported 
level of familiarity with the work of the 
WBG in Jamaica: a rating of 8.2 (on a 10 
point scale) marked an upswing from the 
6.6 registered in the last survey (FY10). 
The ratings of relevance, alignment with 
development priorities 
and 
strategic 
realism- 8.2; 7.7; and 7.6 respectively - 
have also increased more than one point. 
The WBG’s 
technical and capacity 
building assistance 
is considered as 
valuable and effective as 
the WBG 
financial support.  

C. PROPOSED WBG STRATEGY FOR FY14-17 

44. 
The overarching goal of the CPS is to support Jamaica in creating conditions 
for sustainable and inclusive growth. In line with the National Development Plan and 
in close cooperation with other development partners operating in Jamaica, the strategy 
will provide selective solution-oriented support in three areas (Figure 11): (i) Public 
Sector Modernization (ii) Enabling Environment for Private Sector Growth and (iii) 
Social and Climate Resilience. The WBG program will help address some of Jamaica’s 
chronic structural challenges, but only consistent government policies and long-term 
engagement with all partners would bring growth acceleration over time.

45. 
The proposed CPS is aligned with the Government’s development priorities 
for Jamaica. The strategy is focused on Jamaica’s third national goal: “Jamaica’s 
Economy is Prosperous”, and is supported by specific outcomes related to the other three 
national goals (National Goal One: “Jamaicans are empowered to achieve their fullest 
potential”; National Goal Two: “The Jamaican Society is safe, cohesive and just”; and 
National Goal Four: “Jamaica has a healthy natural environment”). In alignment with the 
WBG twin goals of reducing poverty and boosting shared prosperity, the strategy scales 
up successful interventions aimed at protecting the poor, creating opportunities for the 
vulnerable, and helping communities to reduce poverty and address crime and violence. 
At the same time, the strategy places an increased emphasis on helping improve the 
enabling environment for private sector development and growth and addressing climate 
change vulnerabilities as conditions for fostering sustained improvements in shared 
prosperity. 
46. 
The CPS areas of engagement were identified through a selectivity filter 
aimed at maximizing impact. Selectivity criteria focused on areas that: (i) are removing 
binding constraints to Jamaica’s development and where government demand and 
commitment are high; (ii) are aligned with the WBG’s comparative advantage7; and (iii) 
have the highest likely influence on poverty reduction and shared prosperity (Figure 12).  
This led to the identification of three areas of engagement and eight targeted development 
outcomes.

7 Comparative advantage was defined as measuring the WBG’s global experience in a given area, its 
analytical understanding of the specific area in Jamaica, and the success of current WBG engagement in the 
area.

Thematic Area 1: Public Sector Modernization 
47. Modernization of the public service is a necessary step in the government’s 
efforts to generate additional fiscal space for strategic investments and facilitate 
private sector development. Some of the problems that have afflicted Jamaica in this 
regard include weaknesses in the budget process that affect the planning and execution of 
public spending, inefficiencies in debt management, a heavy pension system that is 
entirely funded by budgetary outlays, and a public sector investment program unable to 
deliver growth dividends in its present un-prioritized way. Furthermore, Jamaica faces 
challenges associated with tax and customs administration that undermine the investment 
climate, inefficiencies in the operation and management of public entities, and weak 
accountability mechanisms. The Bank will support the GoJ with activities focused on (a) 
strengthening capacity to manage debt, the public pension system, and the public sector 
investment program; and (b) improve the performance of public administration 
institutions that are critical to private sector growth.  
Objective: Improving Fiscal and Debt Management.  
Outcome 1: Strengthened Government Capacity to Manage Debt, the Public 
Pension System, and the Public Sector Investment Program (PSIP). 
48. 
The WBG will support better fiscal and debt management. The Bank will 
continue to support the development of an integrated strategic planning and budgeting 
process, the implementation of a system of financial and nonfinancial performance 
indicators, and the integrated financial information system for budget and cash 
management. IFC will continue providing support on tax simplification. New WBG 
activities will focus on strengthening the strategic debt management capacity of the Debt 
Management Unit and the implementation of a new Debt Law, while addressing broader 
structural issues underlying fiscal and debt sustainability, such as the sustainability of the 
public pension system. In addition, in coordination with the IDB, the Bank technical 
support will be provided to develop a comprehensive risk assessment framework that 
looks at the fiscal impact of exogenous shocks. 
49. 
Strengthening the prioritization and alignment of budget planning with 
execution will remain a key area of focus. To institutionalize the five-year PSIP, the 
Bank will help to unify and harmonize procedures governing public investment projects 
and help strengthen capacity for economic and financial analysis and prioritization of 
public investment projects.  
Objective: Improving Public Administration Performance 
Outcome 2: Improved performance of public administration institutions critical to 
private sector development.  
50. 
Boosting public sector performance and increasing accountability will take 
important place in the GoJ’s reform agenda. The Bank is already assisting Parliament 
in strengthening its public finance oversight capacity by making a more systematic use of 
pre-legislative (including pre-budget) scrutiny. Going forward, the Bank program will 
focus on strengthening capacity and improving performance in areas considered major 
bottlenecks to private sector development, such as Customs and standardization. 
Expected results include a reduction of 35 percent in the number of product certifications 

17 

 
 
and inspections for imports and services; and reduction of release time for imports at 
Kingston port. The Bank and IFC policy advice and capacity building will help 
strengthen PPP management to leverage private investments in a strategic and fiscally 
sustainable manner. The Bank and IFC will also continue to provide support to the 
Development Bank of Jamaica (DBJ)’s privatization program under a broader MOU that 
includes specific PPP projects (energy, transport waste water treatment and education). In 
consultation with the IMF, the WBG will support the authorities with the introduction of 
an institutional framework for PPPs. In addition, IFC will explore strengthening of public 
and private agencies which can support food exports from Jamaica. 
51. 
Demand for good governance at the local level will also be targeted. Building 
on good practices in Jamaica and other countries, the WBG will systematically 
emphasize social accountability and demand for good governance across all areas of 
engagement. Lessons learned and results that emerged from the Inner Cities Basic 
Services for the Poor Project (ICBSP) on strengthening community capacity to monitor 
and demand better services will be replicated across interventions at the local level. Use 
of beneficiary feedbacks will be expanded wherever relevant. A flexible approach will be 
implemented with the introduction of specific accountability components in operations. 
The WBG engagement in this area will build on the public policy monitoring 
mechanisms established under the CGF’s Jamaica Chapter and through the entry of 
Jamaica in the Global Partnership on Social Accountability (GPSA). 
Thematic Area 2: Enabling Environment for Private Sector Growth 
52. 
Jamaica’s weak business environment, limited technological innovation and 
inadequate skills supply impede competitiveness and business expansion. On the DB 
indicators, Jamaica lags behind its regional competitors in indicators such as ease of 
paying taxes, enforcing contracts, registering property, and trading across borders. 
Jamaica’s taxation on profits is particularly high when compared with its neighbors. 
Surveys of Jamaican businesses point to tax rates, electricity, access to finance, practices 
of the informal sector as well as crime, theft and disorder as the most burdensome 
constraints on their operations.8 At the same time, SMEs in Jamaica with potential to 
grow lack knowledge and skills to increase productivity, sell more competitive outputs 
and generate jobs. They lack capabilities to integrate into dynamic value chains, 
precluding them from high potential job growth business opportunities. The absence of 
services for business development and support, standardized production and processing 
capacities limits access to formal and higher value added domestic and international 
markets and the longer term viability of small Jamaican enterprises. The education 
system has failed to impart relevant skills for the private sector labor market. 
53. 
The WBG program will aim to help Jamaica tangibly improve the enabling 
environment for private sector while focusing support in sectors that can be drivers 
of growth through: (i) “horizontal” support to strengthen the general business 
environment; and (ii) help foster the development of specific sectors with high or higher 
potential (“vertical” support). The work will go beyond general DB indicator-based 
reforms and will focus on industry level interventions aimed at removing gaps in the 

8 See World Bank (June 2013), Overcoming the Binding Constraints to Growth in Jamaica, Caribbean 
Knowledge Series. 

18 

 
                                                 
value chain. Analytical work and stakeholder consultations, including through the CGF, 
identified the sectors of tourism, agribusiness, logistics, creative industries, energy and 
ICT, as potential sources of increased competitiveness, jobs, and ultimately growth for 
Jamaica. In these sectors, with the support of a Joint Business Plan (JBP) with the IFC, 
the WBG program will target improvements in the business environment, infrastructure 
gaps (with a focus on energy and transportation, and leveraging local capital markets), 
higher entrepreneurship and innovation, and attraction of private investment. 
Objective: Improving the business environment 
Outcome 3: Improved business conditions and access to credit, in particular for 
MSMEs.  
54. 
The WBG will work with the National Competitiveness Council and other 
stakeholders on improving key areas of the business environment highlighted in the 
2014 DB report. Particular emphasis will continue to be placed on tax regime, enforcing 
contracts, trading across borders, customs regulations, electricity, and logistics services 
and construction permits. To help improve access to credit, IFC will continue advising on 
Credit Bureau legislation, as part of a regional harmonization plan, and will support 
microfinance institutions to better adapt loan products to the local market, opening access 
to finance to previously underserved market segments, such as small business owners. 
The Bank will support financial inclusion work through a Development FSAP, the 
improvement of credit information systems, and support a credit line and a credit 
guarantee facility. Going forward, the WBG will assist the GoJ in developing a Logistics 
Hub Initiative aimed at establishing Jamaica as a major hub in the global trading system. 
This work will include assistance to the development of a Master Plan and the design of 
legal and regulatory reform for economic zones, the development of logistics and the 
removal of trade barriers, with specific attention to ensuring backward linkages to the 
Jamaican economy. IFC will work with food sector SMEs and their public and private 
institutions to help improve their investment climate and access to finance and markets. 
IFC will also pursue its efforts to develop SME credit lines and trade financing lines 
Outcome 4: Modernized and increasingly diversified energy sector and transport 
infrastructure. 
55. 
To support infrastructure upgrade, IFC will mobilize private investment by 
leveraging local capital markets for qualified projects, while the Bank will help 
establish a PPP project preparation facility, to identify and study new investments and 
subsequent attraction of FDI in key sectors. In an environment of fiscal consolidation, 
IFC advisory services on PPPs will complement the Bank efforts. In an environment of 
fiscal consolidation, local capital markets and PPPs offer alternatives to address 
infrastructure needs by tapping the private sector resources. A more efficient energy 
sector is important to alleviate the drain on the country’s fuel import bill, and the burden 
of high electricity rates on businesses and consumers. The WBG will continue to provide 
TA on policy and institutional support to the energy regulator and the energy ministry, in 
particular for the development of policies and to expand clean and renewable energy 
generation. Going forward the WBG will aim at mobilizing private sector investment for 
fuel source diversification, including potential IFC support for natural gas and large-scale 
energy efficiency improvements. IFC will remain active in supporting the upgrading of 
the transport network, especially airports, via investment and advisory services. 

19 

 
Objective: Fostering Entrepreneurship, Skills and Innovation  
Outcome 5: Enhanced technological adoption, improved skills mix, and fostered 
investments in high potential sectors.  
56. WBG support will target technological adoption and innovation, and 
improvement of the supply of skills in growth sectors, namely agriculture/ 
agribusiness and ICT. In collaboration with InfoDev, the WBG will help the GoJ foster 
entrepreneurship, with particular focus on women, through public policies and public-
private funded incubators that stimulate technology-enabled innovation, exchange of 
knowledge, and expand the supply of skilled labor. Building on the successful experience 
of Digital Jam 2.0 and KingsTOON, the WBG, in collaboration with various 
development partners, will provide support to entrepreneurship in ICT and climate 
change mitigation, and the development of creative industries. This work will help 
increase youth employability and create some opportunities for jobs, especially for young 
people, in the virtual global economy and in labor-intensive non-traditional sectors (e.g., 
animation industry). In the agriculture/agribusiness sector, the WBG will continue 
working with the GoJ to enhance productivity, by providing support to groups of small 
producers who represent a large share of the "bottom 40 percent", and by strengthening 
alliances between groups of small producers and larger processors/wholesalers/markets, 
thus creating linkages to domestic and foreign markets. This support will continue to 
cover a range of issues, including sanitary and phytosanitary systems, market and weather 
information, certification and standardization, and post-harvesting/processing to create 
stronger links with the tourism industry and export markets. Going forward, the WBG 
will help to attract large anchor investors with backward linkage potential as a critical 
source of value-added, know-how, finance and linkage to more sophisticated markets. 
With EU support, IFC will assist food sector SMEs (exports, food security). 
57. 
Implementation of activities in this thematic area will be supported by a 
Joint Business Plan leveraging WBG support (Annex 7). The JBP will combine WBG 
support for horizontal policy reforms of the business environment, with IFC investments 
and advisory services and potential MIGA insurance in infrastructure, agribusiness, 
energy and other sectors that have the potential to be future drivers of growth. 
Thematic Area 3:  Social and Climate Resilience 
58. 
Jamaica has embarked on an ambitious fiscal consolidation and structural 
reform agenda, whose success depends on the country’s capacity to protect the poor, 
reduce social vulnerability and enhance climate resilience. Austerity measures in the 
short run could hurt the poor and vulnerable and lead to a potential increase in transient 
poverty. Effective social safety net programs, targeted at the poor with the capacity to 
identify, capture and protect those at risk present a critical social cushion during the 
economic adjustment. Building human capital, starting from early childhood, provides 
the foundations for a more resilient, stronger, and more prosperous society. Improved 
management of climate risks and climate resilience will reduce productive losses in the 
future, as well as the cost of infrastructure rehabilitation. Poor communities are hit harder 
by natural disasters and strengthening disaster management will contribute to poverty 
reduction and improvement of livelihood. 

20 

 
 
Objective: Enhancing resilience and reducing socio-economic vulnerabilities 
Outcome 6:  Strengthened social protection programs and improved institutional 
capacity for their management.  
59. 
The Bank will continue its support to GoJ’s social protection program 
(Program of Advancement Through Health and Education, PATH) by building on the 
successful implementation of the conditional cash transfer flagship. Specifically, 
additional support to the Social Protection Program (PATH2) will: (i) ensure continued 
investment in human capital; (ii) strengthen the PATH institutional capacity and 
programming; and, (iii) invest in opportunities for “graduation” of PATH beneficiaries, 
by improving their skills and employability through the Steps to Work program. IBRD 
will also continue to support the improvement in access to, and quality of, early 
childhood services particularly for vulnerable households with focus on improved 
screening and intervention for at risk children, increasing the number of early childhood 
institutions that meet minimum standards of quality; support to certified parenting 
education programs; and, scaled-up nutritional programs.  
Outcome 7: Increased opportunities for poor and vulnerable. 
60. 
The WBG will continue to support strengthening social protection programs, 
protecting and improving human capital, and fostering a more inclusive and 
sustainable urban and rural development. These programs will help to create 
opportunities for poor and vulnerable groups by improving: (i) quality of early childhood 
education as a critical factor for improved education and labor market performance; (ii) 
access to health, education and employment opportunities for poor and vulnerable 
beneficiaries of the conditional cash transfer program; and (iii) services and community-
based social cohesion through increased access to basic services in selected vulnerable 
communities and strengthened capacity to implement and monitor programs for crime 
prevention. Building on the successes of the Jamaica Social Investment Fund to 
improving quality of life and reducing violence in vulnerable communities, the Bank will 
scale up interventions in support of the GoJ’s program of “Community Renewal”. 
61. 
Support will also continue aimed at improving public safety in targeted 
communities by increasing the ability to design evidence-based policies and programs on 
crime and violence prevention and strengthening the capacity of the National Violence 
Observatory to collect, analyze, and disseminate data and statistics. 
Objective: Increasing resilience to climate change and natural disasters. 
Outcome 8: Improved institutional capacity to plan and respond to climate change 
events and natural disasters.  
62. 
The WBG will support the development of a comprehensive framework for 
disaster and climate risk management and help Jamaica move from policies and 
instruments focused on responding to natural disasters to a comprehensive risk 
management strategy 
integrating 
risk 
reduction and disaster 
risk 
financing. 
Environmental degradation and the impact of natural disasters pose particularly urgent 
challenges to Jamaica’s economic and societal sustainability. Institutional strengthening 
and provision of climate resilient infrastructure are critical to ensure sustainable 
development. In particular, the WBG will contribute to: (i) building institutional 

21 

 
capacities to identify, assess and understand disaster and climate risks in terms of their 
economic and fiscal (expenditure and revenue) impacts; (ii) improving the understanding 
and cost-efficient use of financial protection instruments and mechanisms against 
disaster, supporting Jamaica in building a cost-effective sovereign disaster risk financing 
and insurance strategy; (iii) implementing priority risk reduction investments and disaster 
risk management policies using customized financial solutions; and, (iv) strengthening 
the catastrophe risk insurance framework. In addition, the Entrepreneurship Program for 
Innovation in the Caribbean (EPIC) is establishing a Caribbean Climate Innovation 
Center in Jamaica to fund climate change initiatives of start-up companies. 

IV. WBG FINANCING AND PROGRAM MANAGEMENT  

A. 

FINANCING PROGRAM FOR FY14-17 CPS 

63. 
The financing framework for the CPS FY14-17 period provides for up to 
US$510 million in IBRD resources. In light of the magnitude of the country’s financing 
needs and the WBG commitment to support GOJ fiscal adjustment and reform efforts, 
IBRD has committed to provide US$510 million over the four–year period of the CPS, in 
conjunction with the IMF and IDB program of support. Given Jamaica’s fiscal 
constraints in the short term, delivery of the program will be frontloaded in the first two 
to three years, including though scaling up successful existing operations. 
64. 
About half IBRD’s commitment will be provided as Development Policy 
Loans (DPLs) and the remainder through investment project financing (IPF). A 
series of DPLs will support policy and institutional reforms in the WBG areas of strategic 
engagement. The remainder will be mostly IPF, including three additional financing or 
scale up operations (i.e., 
the

The WBG contribution to results in Jamaica in the early years of the CPS 
implementation will be primarily through the existing portfolio; managing portfolio 
for results is a key priority. The current portfolio, Table 4, consists of five investment 
lending operations with a commitment of $153 million and one development policy loan 
of $130 million. The largest investments are in the sectors of Economic Policy and Social 
protection followed by Education, Agriculture and Energy which aligns well with the 
focus of the CPS in the areas of growth and reducing social vulnerabilities. Portfolio 
performance to date has been satisfactory, despite Jamaica’s fiscal space constraint and 
all projects are expected to achieve their Development Objectives. The disbursement ratio 
for Jamaica maintained a solid 29 percent from FY08-FY14. Currently, the only problem 
project, Rural Economic Development Initiative, is being restructured to ensure 
satisfactory performance. Since 2008, IEG has evaluated 8 projects of which 7 were rated 
“satisfactory” and 1  “moderately satisfactory”.

Bank projects in Jamaica partially use country FM systems.  For example, 
funds flow to projects through normal budget processes, but the country's lack of a 
functioning Integrated Financial Management Information System (IFMIS) means that 
specialized hardware/software is used to manage project accounting, financial reporting 
and related processes. The Office of the Auditor General has audited four IBRD projects, 
and this is expected to increase going forward. Project FM staff (like other PIU staff) are 
often contracted specifically for project implementation; this is an area where greater use 
of normal country processes (civil servants) could increase. GOJ has stated its strong 
interest in greater use of country systems during the CPS period, and the Bank will 
support this through a portfolio-level approach and through analysis during the design of 
new operations. FM performance in the portfolio has generally been satisfactory. Project 
FM staff participate in the Bank's annual fiduciary training, which has helped to fill 
capacity gaps. No significant FM issues were identified during the last CPPR. 
67. With a current portfolio of US$262 million in investments and eight projects 
valued at US$10.7 million in advisory service under implementation, IFC 
engagement in Jamaica is focused on private sector development and shared 
prosperity (Table 5 and Annex B3). Key areas include infrastructure (energy, 
transport), access to finance (MSMEs, trade financing, and local capital markets), growth 
sectors (agribusiness, and ICT), and education. Going forward, a special emphasis will be 
on PPPs in infrastructure and education. With an authorized amount of up to US$500 

23 

 
 
million, the introduction of local currency instruments further leverages IFC resources 
mobilization capacity. IFC’s advisory services are focused on access to finance, 
investment climate, PPPs and value chain support in the food sector.

68. MIGA’s net exposure in Jamaica, as of January 31, 2014, amounts to 
US$56.5 million and enables on-lending by the financial sector to an infrastructure 
project. The continuing support to this transaction signals MIGA’s efforts to continue to 
underwrite projects in Jamaica, facilitate inward FDIs, and contribute to the WBG’s 
strategy of encouraging private sector development.  

69. 
A well-targeted program of AAA and convening services, including at 
regional level, will inform policy dialogue and investment operations, and provide 
support to reforms (Annex B4). Drawing on the inputs from multiple stakeholders—
GoJ, the private sector, and communities—the WBG will support the GoJ with 
customized solutions that integrate global knowledge and expertise with financial 
services including support work on poverty analytics. An important segment of the 
program implementation will continue to be based on Caribbean regional studies and 
collaboration through South-South exchanges. A cross-sector programmatic program of 
NLTA, financed mostly through TF, will support the design, implementation and 
monitoring of the policy and institutional reforms in the areas of debt management, 
public sector reform, public finance and PPPs, social service delivery, poverty 
monitoring, gender, and shared prosperity. 

B. MANAGING PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION 

70. 
Reflecting lessons from the previous CPS, the timing, sequencing and 
composition of IBRD financing will be managed flexibly, allowing for adjustments in 
the choice of instruments and in the program weight across the three main areas of 
engagement in response to evolving global or country conditions and priorities, including 
progress under the IMF EFF. If necessary, in close partnership with other stakeholders, 
the program could be adjusted. Frequent monitoring of portfolio implementation and 
annual CPPRs will take stock of achievement of milestones and progress towards results 
and will inform program implementation and adjustments as needed. To allow for greater 
leveraging of expertise and products across the WBG institutions, the second strategic 
area of the CPS will be based on the JBP. The JBP will be coordinated through a steering 
committee with participation of the GoJ and private sector representatives and its periodic 
reviews will complement the regular IBRD, IFC and MIGA portfolio reviews. 
Beneficiary assessments will be used where feasible. A CPS progress report will be 
prepared within 18 months of CPS implementation.  
24 

 
 
71. 
The CPS program covers a small part of Jamaica’s development needs and 
the WBG will continue building partnerships to leverage resources and enhance 
impact. The WBG’s contribution is targeted at providing catalytic support, sharing 
global development knowledge and expertise. Thus, coordination with, and leverage of, 
other development partner financing will be important elements of success of the WBG 
program. Bank support for policy and institutional reforms in the CPS areas of 
engagement will be closely coordinated with the IMF, the IDB and the EU to maximize 
impact and leverage. Coordination with the IDB will be strengthened further in the social 
sectors, agriculture risk insurance and value chain support to small farmers, support for 
customs reforms, public sector modernization, tax administration, and public investment 
programming. Grant financing from DFATD and DfID will continue to support technical 
assistance in public sector modernization. The WBG will also work jointly with the IDB, 
CDB and DFATD on two on-going initiatives: (i) public-private sector dialogue on 
growth through the CGF; and (ii) youth empowerment through creative, digital (Digital 
Jam 2.0) and animation industries (KingsTOON). With support from DFADT, InfoDev 
will continue supporting entrepreneurship, innovation, and start-ups through the ongoing 
EPIC program. IFC will continue to work with donors including DFATD, SECO and the 
EU that are supporting IFC advisory services (PPPs, Investment Climate, Access to 
Finance, SME and Sustainable Business Advisory). 

V. 

RISKS 

72. 
The overall risk of the CPS program is high and while some risk mitigation 
measures can be taken, not all risks can be mitigated. Jamaica is entering a demanding 
transition period, where major reforms may result in significant adjustment costs before 
they yield results in terms of growth acceleration and shared prosperity. There is a risk 
that political commitment weakens and social tensions increase, and the country is still 
vulnerable to external shocks and natural disasters. Materialization of any of or all of 
these risks which could derail fiscal consolidation and set back the reform program. More 
importantly, while the CPS program might succeed in achieving the objectives of 
building the conditions for growth, growth might take longer to materialize. Demand 
response to the structural, supply side reforms might not materialize if the global 
environments remain constrained and/or demand rebounding may be limited by the lack 
of competitiveness in the exchange rate. However, there is recognition that the country 
could be at a turning point and the GoJ acknowledges the need to demonstrate credibility 
and sustainability of its reform efforts to improve markets’ perception, while sustaining 
social acceptability of the program and protecting vulnerable populations who are the 
most likely to suffer the social and economic costs of adjustment.  
73. 
The CPS program faces three types of risks: macroeconomic, governance and 
political, and capacity risks. 
(i) Macroeconomic risk. The economic situation continues to be fragile, and the 
Jamaican economy remains highly vulnerable to external shocks and natural disasters.  
The combination of a large current account deficit, low foreign exchange reserves, high 
unemployment and tight fiscal space significantly reduces the Government’s flexibility to 

25 

 
 
adapt to unforeseen shocks which would put the fiscal and debt situation under pressure. 
Even in the absence of shocks, meeting the ambitious fiscal targets will require sustained 
effort and continued commitment from the authorities. Growth targets are ambitious, and 
require both good policy and a favorable global economic environment. Going forward, 
resumption of growth will continue to depend on the global economic environment, and 
good progress on structural reforms alone may not translate into growth. Should macro 
fragility cause the economic reform program to go off track, the country would likely 
face substantial balance of payment and budget financing problems, the possibility of 
debt default, sharp exchange rate depreciation and a spike in inflation. This would result 
in a deep contraction of the economy and a rise in unemployment and poverty levels, 
leading to a possible crisis. If this risk were to materialize, the programmatic DPL series 
would be jeopardized and private sector investments be delayed.  
Mitigation: While the Bank is coordinating closely with the IMF program to mitigate 
macro risks, the CPS areas of investment lending and AAA would remain highly relevant 
including by providing monitoring and supervision and providing on-demand technical 
assistance. The program may require adjustment due to exogenous shocks or other factors 
that cannot be anticipated at the outset. In that case, Bank financing would need to be 
adjusted in coordination with the IMF and the IDB. In case of a program failure, the Bank 
could reallocate the resources of the DPL series to social mitigation interventions that 
would be scaled up. The IFC, in this scenario, while limited in its ability to commit new 
investments due to negative private sector confidence, would increase its efforts to 
provide support for the investment climate agenda. With IFC support, leveraging local 
markets may provide some alternative financing options, especially in the absence of 
FDI. The WBG would also explore opportunities for alternative entry points on the policy 
and institutional agenda, as feasible, through convening services, knowledge work,South-
South exchanges, and sector level interventions. 
(ii) Governance and political risks. Jamaica faces a heavy reform agenda which could 
lose steam if negative impacts of reform begin to reduce political and popular support, 
and if vested interests come in the way. The difficult reforms underway under the IMF 
EFF have virtually exhausted the government’s political capital, harmed vested interests, 
reduced spending and solicited heavy debate in Jamaica on the potential benefits of these 
reforms. Reform fatigue and weakened political support may have a negative impact on 
the structural reforms supported by the CPS. Moreover, if growth is slow in materializing 
the political environment will not be conducive to further fiscal adjustment should it 
become necessary.  
Mitigation:  While this risk can only be marginally mitigated, the WBG will work with 
the government to accompany the reform process with policy dialogue and good 
communication, and maintain close relations with the private sector. Efforts will also be 
made to deepen the WBG’s understanding of the political economy in important reform 
areas to inform the nature and scale of its engagement and adjust accordingly. Overall, 
the large multilateral package may help maintain confidence that financial support is 
available should the Government continue on the path of tough reforms.  Under the DPO 
series, the WBG will strive to balance the predictability of its financing with the strength 
of the program implementation. Furthermore, the WBG will aim at supporting the supply 
and demand sides of good governance through the CGF process, the GPSA for 

26 

 
strengthened social accountability, PFM-related activities, South-South exchanges, and 
other interventions under Strategic Objective 3. 
(iii) Capacity risks. The multi-faceted reform agenda raises the risk that government 
capacity is stretched thin and implementation is delayed. Legislative capacity has been 
stretched given the large amount of new legislation that needs to be drafted and approved 
over the next few years. In addition, an ongoing public sector wage freeze has greatly 
hampered the government’s ability to attract and maintain talent and made it difficult to 
create new positions. Several of the reforms require the government to hire personnel 
with scarce skills (e.g., debt managers, PPP transactions specialists). There is a risk that 
the government will not be able to fully operationalize some of the reforms within the 
envisaged timeframe and the limited fiscal resources could hinder the full execution and 
roll out of the CPS agenda and action plans supported by the DPL. This risk also applies 
to GOJ’s capacity to implement the large investment projects envisaged. In the past, 
programs supported by IFIs have sometimes failed to achieve results because of lack of 
capacity.   
Mitigation: For the investment lending operation, the WBG will focus on scaling up 
existing, well performing projects and programs that have demonstrated government 
commitment while continuing its support for strengthening implementation capacity. The 
DPL series will likely include some landmark legislation, in the areas of energy, customs, 
telecommunications and disaster risk management that will set the framework for change. 
To support policy actions underpinning the DPL, the WBG has secured financing for 
training opportunities for existing staff in the MoF as well as for technical assistance, 
including in the form of special advisors focused on design and implementation of key 
reforms so that they might be able to take on some of these tasks without additional 
hiring requirements. On-going TA is being provided in access to finance, doing business, 
PPP, regulations for the debt law, non-communicable diseases and other areas.

INTRODUCTION 

This Country Partnership Strategy Completion Report (CPSCR) assesses the World Bank Group 
CPS for Jamaica (FY2010-FY2013). It reviews the support provided to the country through an 
integrated package of financing, technical assistance, knowledge products and partnerships; and 
evaluates (i) the achievement of CPS program outcomes; (ii) the WBG performance; and (iii) 
draws lessons for the preparation of the forthcoming CPS (2014-2017). A CPS Progress Report 
(CPSPR) took stock of the Bank’s strategy implementation in August 2012. The CPSPR 
validated continued relevance of the CPS objectives; identified emerging risks; and made 
appropriate adjustments to the original CPS program and results framework where warranted. 
This CPSCR uses the updated CPSPR Results matrix as the benchmark for evaluating CPS 
program performance9.  

A. JAMAICA’S ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL CONTEXT  

1. 
During the CPS implementation period, Jamaica was hit hard by the global crisis: 
tourism and bauxite revenues plummeted, Foreign Direct Investments (FDI) and remittances 
declined. The economy contracted by 1.2 percent on average per year between 2009 and 2011, 
and the economic recovery has been subdued. Poverty increased from 9.9 percent in 2007 to 17.5 
percent in 2010. The contraction of economic activity, combined with low productivity led to a 
rise in unemployment and informality, affecting especially women and the youth – 38 percent of 
young women and 25 percent of young men were unemployed in 2013. The adverse economic 
environment led the Government of Jamaica (GoJ) to adopt a more relaxed fiscal policy stance in 
order to maintain key social services and avert further deterioration in living standards. This 
compounded the effect of the crisis on public debt which rose precipitously to 147 percent of 
GDP by December 2012.  

2. 
In order to improve the debt profile, and boost the economy, the GoJ launched an 
ambitious reform program in January 2010 which included a successful domestic debt 
exchange (JDX) backed by a 27-month IMF Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) and support from the 
multilateral partners, including Inter-American Bank (IDB) and the WBG. However, the SBA 
was abandoned in mid-2011 when the GoJ missed targets to adequately address key reforms and 
meet agreed fiscal benchmarks. This resulted in halting official flows to the country and loss of 
investors’ confidence leading to further contraction of the already weak economy.  

9 The changes throughout the program are presented in CPSCR Annexes 1, 2 and 3.

3. 
Early elections were called at end 2011 that led to a change in government. The 
opposition People National Party won the elections with a mandate to restore macroeconomic 
stability and rebuild the conditions for private-sector led growth. By end 2012, however, a 
number of negative economic outcomes created a crisis of confidence. Economic activity 
remained slow and investor confidence eroded further partly due to the delays in negotiating a 
new agreement with the IMF. Continued macroeconomic challenges were compounded by the 
lingering negative effects of Hurricane Sandy (October 2012). To avert a crisis and return to 
macroeconomic stability and growth, an agreement was eventually reached in May 2013 with the 
IMF on an ambitious macroeconomic program also supported by the WBG and the IDB.  

4. 
By early 2013, the GoJ and key multilateral partners reached agreement on a new 
fiscal and growth agenda, supported by a SDR 615 million (about US$932 million) IMF 
Extended Fund Facility (EFF), approved on May 1st, 2013 and commitments by the WBG and 
the IDB to make available US$510 million each in support of the reform effort over a four year 
period. Announcement of these agreements and early success in meeting agreed benchmarks 
have begun to restore confidence in the economy. The EFF program includes critical steps and 
policy reforms to significantly improve the fiscal and debt positions while also supporting 
growth-enhancing reforms. The economy has begun a slow path to stabilization as reserve losses 
have been contained and the rapid devaluation of the exchange rate has been arrested while 
continuing on a slower pace. The fiscal stance has also improved and the central government 
primary surplus reached 5.4 percent in 2012/13, indicating that Jamaica could meet the ambitious 
target of 7.5 percent for the following fiscal year and beyond as part of its commitments under 
the IMF Program.  

B. WORLD BANK GROUP PROGRAM OF SUPPORT 

5. 
The CPS (FY2010-2013) was demand-driven and highly selective. The WBG focused 
on two sets of challenges: addressing Jamaica’s immediate needs to weather the external shocks 
while attending to the needs of most vulnerable populations; and laying the foundations for 
longer term sustainable growth through broad-based and inclusive development. During the CPS 
implementation, IFC increased significantly its role of strategic advisor and investor for GoJ and 
private sector. Coordination between IFC and IBRD around common strategic goals was 
strengthened and expanded. The CPS implementation has benefited from partnering with and 
leveraging other partners’ funds, knowledge and innovation capacity.  

6. 
The CPS was aligned with Jamaica’s Vision 2030 and GoJ priorities articulated in the 
Medium Term Socio Economic Policy (MTSEP).  It was organized around three strategic 
pillars: (i) Supporting Economic Stability, (ii) Promoting Inclusive Growth, and (iii) Promoting 
Sustained Growth. Strengthening Governance was highlighted as a key cross-cutting issue and 
key element of pillar III. The CPS was also based on extensive consultations with the 
Government, other development partners, the private sector, and civil society. The mid-term 
CPSPR validated continued relevance of the CPS objectives, and made specific adjustments to 
the results framework. The conclusions and recommendations of the CPSPR have been reflected 
in improved intra-Bank coordination, and collaboration with development partners. 

33 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
II. 

KEY LESSONS LEARNED AND RECOMMENDATIONS 

7. 
The CPS areas of engagement remain relevant for the new CPS (FY2014-2017). 
However, stronger emphasis should be placed on 
improving Jamaica’s economic 
competitiveness. The WBG made positive strides in the areas of social protection, early 
childhood development, education, agriculture, urban security, and climate resilience. Yet, to 
unlock Jamaica’s growth potential, the strategy needs a sharper focus on private sector-led 
growth and increased competitiveness, while building on the success of its contribution to 
Jamaica’s shared prosperity agenda.  

8. 
The WBG strategy incorporated sufficient flexibility to provide space for adaptation 
and innovation in response to Jamaica’s financial and development challenges. The 
combination of policy-based and investment lending allowed continued financing for critical 
social programs when reforms stalled and foreign investments and official development flows 
decreased. IBRD was able to leverage resources (mainly through TF financing)10, and public-
private partnerships 
to develop 
innovative development 
initiatives addressing youth 
unemployment, crime and violence, education and skills upgrade. Relying on its convening 
power and extensive knowledge base, the WBG was able to introduce groundbreaking solutions, 
such as those in support of creative industries that should be scaled-up in the future.  

9. 
The CPS program design should have been more realistic about what can be 
accomplished in an environment of fiscal and capacity constraints. Integrating political 
economy analysis more systematically in the design of the program and improving intra-Bank 
coordination could strengthen the results framework and the relevance of its outcome indicators. 
Going forward the WBG’s program needs improved sector and program coordination, simplified 
project/program design and realistic timing and sequencing of interventions. In addition, given 
Jamaica’s vulnerability to external shocks and natural disasters, a comprehensive yet flexible 
approach to help tackle short term crises while contributing to long term goals is needed. 

10. 
An efficient WBG monitoring system is needed to support CPS implementation. The 
monitoring and evaluation of the results framework should be based on a joint WBG business 
plan and reviewed systematically as part of the WBG’s portfolio monitoring in conjunction with 
the CPPR. In order to avoid disconnect, the results framework needs to be fully aligned with the 
timing and scope of the WBG program, with activities, indicators and outcomes forming a 
logical results chain, and realistic CPS outcomes. Building on the improved coordination 
between the WBG, IMF, IDB, EU, and some bilateral partners, further collaborative efforts for 
joint results monitoring are warranted to enhance the development impact of all operations.  

III. CPS PROGRAM PERFORMANCE 

11. 
Overall, the CPS program performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory, as the WBG 
made substantive progress toward key expected outcomes: more than half of the quantitative 
indicators have been reached (or exceeded). The overall CPS rating is based on the evaluation of 
the specific outcomes and their contribution to the Pillars ratings (Table 1). Out of 20 objectives, 

10 Due to the precarious debt situation, the GoJ was not in a position to borrow for vital climate adaptation. IBRD leveraged Climate Investment 
Funds (100 percent grant) and Jamaica was the first country in the Caribbean to benefit from TA in the area of agriculture production risks.

A.  Overview and Principles of Engagement 

12. 
The main thrust of the WBG Strategy was to support the GoJ in its efforts to: (i) 
mitigate the medium-term effects of the global economic crisis; (ii) protect social gains while 
moving towards fiscal and debt sustainability; and (iii) lay the foundations for inclusive and 
sustained growth over the medium to long term.  

13. 
The Bank followed three principles of engagement: responsiveness; adaptability; and 
leverage and partnerships. These principles were derived from the experience of implementing 
the last CPS and confirmed through Government and stakeholder consultations for the 
preparation of the CPS 2010-13. Applying these principles, the CPS program built on existing 
operations and relationships, and relied on development partners’ operations to maximize impact 
while minimizing demands on the Government and WBG resources.    

B.  

PROGRESS BY STRATEGIC ENGAGEMENT PILLARS  

PILLAR I. SUPPORTING ECONOMIC STABILITY  

14. 
Overall, the program implementation under this Pillar was moderately satisfactory in 
meeting the stated CPS objectives.11 Of the three CPS outcomes in the Fiscal and Debt 
Sustainability Results Area one outcome was fully achieved; two were mostly achieved. Despite 
the challenging implementation environment, major policy and institutional changes have been 
accomplished. The legal and institutional foundations for structural reforms have been put in 
place and serve as a basis for fiscal and debt sustainability along the lines of what the current 
arrangements with the IMF are supporting. 

11 The CPS outcome of achieving a reduction in Jamaica’s debt-to-GDP ratio from 139.7 percent of GDP in 2010 to 124.2 percent in 2013 was 
dropped from the Results Matrix during the CPSPR, as it was difficult to attribute the result, even if it was realized, to Bank interventions alone.

Results Area 1: Fiscal and Debt Sustainability 

15. 
Improving fiscal and debt sustainability in order to reduce debt overhang and reverse 
the weak growth trajectory was one of the key objectives in Jamaica during the CPS period. 
This objective was supported with a programmatic series of DPLs12 (Table 2), focused on three 
interrelated challenges: (i) fiscal and debt sustainability; (ii) transparency and efficiency of 
public financial management and budget processes; and (iii) efficiency of the tax system. Due to 
the long term nature of the program goals, lags in implementation (especially in FSDPL2), and a 
combination of internal and external events, including change in government, and a court ruling 
reversing the civil service wage freeze, progress was mixed. Of the 21 indicators in the DPLs 
results framework, 10 targets were met, 7 were partially achieved and 4 were not met. 

Table 2. Overview of DPO series – Fiscal and Debt Sustainability DPL (FDSDPL) and 
Programmatic Debt and Fiscal Sustainability DPLs (FSDPL) 

16. 
Key success of the program is the establishment of the Fiscal Responsibility 
Framework (FRF) and associated regulations that allowed for the application of prudent fiscal 
management, and the creation of a sustainable institutional setup for managing debt. Supported 
by a Bank team, the newly created Debt Management Unit is developing a debt management 
strategy using Medium Term Debt Strategy (MTDS) tool designed by the WB and IMF13. The 
2011/12 and 2012/13 budget included for the first time a medium term debt management strategy 
and a borrowing plan. Improved fiscal reporting discipline and accountability, and more strategic 
debt management were introduced successfully and have enhanced the medium term fiscal and 
debt sustainability.  

17. 
The program made significant impact by eliminating deferred financing of public 
bodies. Some public bodies were divested or restructured, including several sugar producers and 
the expected savings materialized. Working together with IBRD under its crisis response 
operation IFC provided advisory services for the privatization of Air Jamaica, relieving the 
Government’s fiscal accounts of a monthly average expense of US$15 million.  

18. 
Efficiency of public financial management and budgeting processes was improved. For 
the first time, the Fiscal Policy Paper submitted to Parliament (FY12/13) included detailed 
accounts of both central government and the public bodies (although not presented in a fully 

12 The program was evaluated by IEG and rated as Moderately Satisfactory. 
13 These capacity development efforts are supported by a DFID US$1.6 million grant to strengthen debt management, improve parliamentary 
oversight of the budget, upgrade the Government’s communication strategy on policy reforms, and advance recent efforts at medium-term 
budgeting and public investment prioritization.   

36 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                 
consolidated manner), and the fiscal responsibility statement specified the level of fiscal balance 
and debt. While progress has been made on prioritizing capital investments, some headway was 
made in introducing Medium Term Expenditure Frameworks (MTEFs) in public sector agencies. 
Six pilot ministries and agencies had produced estimates of their current costs and medium term 
expenditure projections, although not entirely integrated into the budget preparation process. 

PILLAR II: PROMOTING INCLUSIVE GROWTH 

19. 
The results achieved under this pillar are rated Highly Satisfactory. Significant 
progress in promoting inclusive growth was achieved through targeted programs in the areas of 
education, health and social development. New approaches to delivery of social services in most 
vulnerable and poor communities have been pioneered. All outcomes have been achieved or 
exceeded in two of the results areas, while in the third area, in spite of changed Objective by the 
GoJ, the agreed interventions achieved visible progress in supporting micro and small producers.  

Results Area 2: Strengthening Human Capital 

20. 
Quality of social services in Jamaica was put on a sustainable path. This was achieved 
through the introduction of decentralized decision-making, particularly in the area of resource 
management in the school system; establishment and enforcement of minimum service standards 
in early childhood development; provision of conditional cash transfers to poor and vulnerable 
groups to increase access to education and health services, and opportunities for skills 
development. All CPS objectives in this cluster were achieved and the overall rating is Highly 
Satisfactory.  

21. 
IBRD supported the transformation of the education sector by focusing on establishing 
the necessary infrastructure for a more decentralized system, with a view to eliminate the shift 
system and to improve quality and access to secondary education14. New institutions in charge of 
improving quality of education delivery – the National Education Inspectorate (NEI), Jamaica 
Teaching Council (JTC) and National Education Trust (NET), have been set up and 
operationalized. The newly established Department of School Services (DSS) is ensuring the 
execution of the education sector policies and enforcing performance and accountability. About 
65 percent of teachers have met professional standards for licensing; NEI established the 
inspection system; and 100 percent of schools are implementing school improvement plans. All 
new agencies have been allocated resources in the ESTP budget to operate. 

22. 
Under the GoJ National Strategic Plan (NSP), the Bank financed a pilot results-based 
disbursement approach15 to improve early childhood development (ECD). In collaboration with 
other development partners (CDB, IDB, OAS, UNICEF and USAID) implementation and 
coordination across sectors was established. A system for monitoring child development and 
screening for risks has been introduced for all children (0-3 years of age) using a Child Health 
Passport. A management information system has been developed to improve the quality of ECD 
services through registration and inspection of early childhood institutions (ECI) and 

14 The cooperation between IFC and CIDA offered an opportunity for expanded advisory services in this area.  
15 The results-based financing was an appropriate instrument for this sector as disbursements were clearly linked to preset targets and results. 

37 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                 
 
enforcement of minimum service standards. The 20 percent target (2013) for registering and 
issuing operational permits for ECI under the new system has more than doubled – reaching 52 
percent. More importantly, this highly successful pilot in the Caribbean is expected to serve as a 
replicable blueprint in the region.   

23. 
Significant strengthening of social safety nets was accomplished through the IBRD-
financed national Conditional Cash Transfer Program (PATH – Program of Advancement 
through Health and Education). Coverage of targeted beneficiaries increased to more than 
400,000 – higher than the initial target. The ongoing Jamaica Social Protection Project and the 
Japan Social Development Fund (JSDF) Grant “Jamaica Scaling Up the PATH Conditional 
Cash Transfer Program for Poor Elderly and Disabled” contributed to the overall success of the 
program that has encouraged beneficiary households to send their children to school regularly 
and increase the number of their health care visits. Notwithstanding the undeniable success of the 
program, the second phase should focus on improving benefits adequacy, and on increasing 
opportunities for graduation of beneficiaries, in particular by upgrading youth employability.  

24. 
Innovative initiatives to reduce 
youth exclusion from economic activity 
and labor market participation were 
introduced 
during 
the 
CPS 
implementation. The Bank supported the 
design and implementation of policies 
and 
programs 
to 
improve 
youth 
employment by facilitating access to the 
global digital market place and creative 
industries.  The non-lending technical 
assistance “Youth Development through 
ICT Solutions” (also known as 
the 
Digital Jam 2.0) provided direct support 
to the youth through partnerships with 
the Jamaican and 
the 
international 
private sector. Achievements include: (i) 
employment creation for about 4,000 
youth that are working (on part-time and 
full time basis) on micro works through 
global 
online 
platforms; 
(ii) 
establishment of a funding window for 
start-up companies; (iii) introduction of 
internship opportunities 
for young 
Jamaicans at leading international and 
national telecommunication companies; 
and 
(iv) 
growing 
international 
commercial interest in the applications 
developed as part of the Digital Jam 2.0. Another such example is the “KingstOOn” initiative 
(see Box 1) which aimed at supporting the development of the animation industry also as a 
source of employment for the youth. Future Bank interventions focusing on youth employment 

Box 1. KingstOOn – Animating Jamaica Creativity 
Jamaica has a large pool of talented youths, many of whom 
are active in the creative industries albeit in an informal 
manner. KingstOOn is an initiative that serves as a bridge 
between this pool of talent and the international animation 
industry to create opportunities for employment. The 
animation industry is labor intensive and requiring large 
quantities of unskilled but creative talent, making it an ideal 
industry to foster with the objective of increasing youth 
employment opportunities in Jamaica. The ultimate goal is 
to position Jamaica as a Caribbean hub for the animation 
industry.  
KingstOOn was organized jointly by the Ministry of 
Investment, Industry and Commerce (MIIC), the Ministry of 
Science, Technology, Energy and Mining 
(STEM), 
JAMPRO, and the Canadian High Commission of Jamaica. 
It was launched in June 2013 with a conference and 
competition (total of 135 entries) in four categories: Best 
Final 
Product, 
Best 
Character Design, 
Best 
Script/Storyboard Design, Best Experimental Animation 
clip.  
As a follow-up, the first animation training program in 
collaboration with the University of the West Indies and 
ToonBoom, a Canadian animation software company, was 
initiated. Currently, the WBG is supporting the Government 
of Jamaica to draft a “white paper” addressing the 
development of this industry. Collaboration with PREM 
Gender on the realization of an animated series for a 
campaign against gender based violence is under way.

38 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and empowerment could assist Government build a well-targeted and resilient social protection 
system by integrating and coordinating policies and programs focused on improved skills and 
employability. These are two examples of small on-the-ground initiatives that can provide 
substantial impact on reducing poverty and exclusion among younger generations.  

25. 
Key policy decisions in Jamaica were shaped through a number of analytical and 
diagnostic studies in the area of human development. The Country Economic Memorandum 
(CEM, FY11 May 2011) presented recommendations to the GoJ to address economic growth 
with special focus on the deficient human capital. A Bank-led study on Financial Sustainability 
of National HIV/AIDs Program provided policy options to ensure future sustainability of the 
programs. The analytical work on Managing Nurse Migration II and Non-Communicable 
Disease (NCD) provided detailed recommendations to improve NCD and Human Resources for 
Health (HRH) policies and helped Jamaica and other Caribbean countries to determine their 
positions prior to the UN High Level Meeting on NCDs. The Bank’s regional assistance program 
continues a policy dialogue on implementing the recommendations on NCDs.  

26. With the Bank’s support, Jamaica became a champion for the first phase of the HRH 
work which focused on nurse migration. In this context, broad consensus was reached in 
priority policy areas of strengthening workforce monitoring, improving and expanding training 
capacities, managing migration, and the need for a regional Caribbean approach. Jamaica is one 
of the focus countries of a regional HRH study (that the Bank is leading), to examine policies 
and practices that generate incentives and accountability mechanisms for health workers in the 
LACR. The Bank helped the GoJ develop the national NCD strategy and action plan16. 

27. 
In education, health, and community development, the Bank program addressed 
gender as a key driver for fighting poverty, crime and exclusion. Jamaica is part of an 
innovative regional knowledge exchange program―Keeping Boys out of Risk Initiative. It 
addresses boys’ underperformance at school as well as policies and programs to prevent and 
tackle the issue. This initiative was funded by the South-South Trust Fund. Activities included a 
Regional high level conference in May 2009, a good practices contest, and the preparation and 
dissemination of a resource kit. Through the Social Development Trust Fund, the Jamaica 
Country Office organized a call for proposals to improve Monitoring and Evaluation for grass 
roots organizations working on youth at risk, including a gender perspective. In addition, the 
Office organized training sessions via Video-conference on the fundamentals of Monitoring and 
Evaluation for Non-Government Organizations. As complement to KingtOON and in 
collaboration with the animation industry supporting Jamaica’s strategy on creative industries, 
the Bank developed a Next GENDERation initiative designed to promote awareness for young 
women groups on gender based violence. These groups use animation and other social media to 
reach out to young women across the island with targeted messages on prevention and group 
based initiatives for social support.   

16 The report “Jamaica’s Effort in Improving Universal Access with Fiscal Constraints” addressed the issues Jamaica faces in reaching universal 
health coverage.

Results Area 3: Crime and Violence Prevention 

28. 
All three objectives in this cluster have been achieved and the overall rating is highly 
satisfactory. The Bank’s flagship program “Inner Cities Basic Services for the Poor” improved 
quality of life in 12 Jamaican inner-city areas and poor urban informal settlements through 
increased access to basic urban infrastructure, financial services, land tenure regularization, 
enhanced community capacity and improved public safety. The improved infrastructure and 
financial services have reached more than 60,000 residents (above planned target) in the 
respective communities and is an example of a multi-sector initiative that has been successful in 
addressing infrastructure gap, public safety and community capacity building.17  

29. 
The Bank was successful in applying an innovative approach to citizens’ safety. The 
new methodology was evidence-based, and subject to rigorous process monitoring and ex-post 
evaluation. It links the monitoring of crime patterns to programming facilitated by the 
development of a cutting-edge crime and violence information platform and early warning 
system – the National Crime and Violence Observatory.18 The Observatory aims at increasing 
the capacity of the GoJ to collect and analyze data and design successful evidence-based 
policies, and programs. This work is considered best practice in the Latin American Region.  

30. 
An essential element of the success of the program was the linkage between improved 
social services and crime and violence prevention strategies that helped strengthen social 
cohesion and public safety. As a result, public safety in targeted inner city communities has 
improved through diverse interventions: mediation and conflict resolution; training on alternative 
livelihoods; skills development; and linking groups at risk with existing family support 
programs.  

Results Area 4: Promoting Rural Development 

31. 
The specific outcome “medium-sized farms move up the supply chain” was not 
achieved, because it was replaced on the GoJ’s request with “micro and small producers and 
tourism service providers” during the CPS implementation. This made the specific outcome non-
observable, but significant positive outcomes have been accomplished under alternative 
indicators. The second outcome related to capacity training of small-scale producers and service 
providers was achieved. The overall rating for this results area is moderately satisfactory. 

32. 
 To help improve market access for micro and small-scale rural agricultural producers 
and tourism service providers, the Rural Economic Development Initiative (R.E.D.I.) is 
providing matching grants to groups of producers in the tourism and agricultural sectors, to 
introduce new technologies into the value chain. The number of direct jobs created in 
communities receiving technical assistance has almost twice surpassed the expected target. 
About 5,500 small scale farmers have benefited from capacity building initiatives and 5,200 

17 The number of people who participated in education and employment programs or activities reached 29,777, which is 6 times higher than the 
planned target; More than 1000 households above the targeted number received access to water, and more than 100 households above target have 
improved access to sewer networks. More than half of the beneficiaries in these inner-cities have participated in programs or activities for 
community-based crime and violence prevention and reduction. A survey and evaluation of the program impact has been carried out at end 2013 
and will provide credible data about the level of improved security.    
18 A JSDF Crime and Violence prevention grant continues to support the National Crime and Violence Observatory/Integrated Crime and 
Violence Information System of the Ministry of National Security.

farmers are being trained in good agricultural practices. For example, the new practices in 
growing yams resulted in 80 percent of the crop meeting export quality. Currently, R.E.D.I. 
supports more than 1,500 small producers/entrepreneurs, about half of which are women and 19 
percent youth. It is expected that it will increase the earning potential of rural communities 
through the enhancement and development of agricultural supply chain linkages and community-
based tourist initiatives.  

PILLAR III. PROMOTING SUSTAINED GROWTH 

33. 
The Bank’s assistance has focused on promoting sustained growth through 
strengthening non labor competitiveness; improved access to energy; reduced vulnerability and 
climate resilience; and strengthening governance. Of the 9 outcomes under this pillar, 3 have 
been achieved; 1 – mostly achieved; 3 – partially achieved, and 2 – not achieved. However, the 
formal ratings ‘partially achieved’ and ‘not achieved’ do not provide justice to the actual results 
on the ground. Since objectives other than those in the Results Matrix have been pursued (on the 
GoJ request) and achieved, the overall pillar is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory.  

Results Area 5: Strengthening Non-Labor Competitiveness 

34. 
The non-labor competitiveness results area is rated unsatisfactory. The specific 
outcome of reduced electric utility losses cannot be observed and, in reality, does not reflect the 
nature of WBG’s intervention (during the CPS implementation) that focused mostly on 
regulatory reform. The outcome related to ease of paying taxes was partially achieved. 

35. 
Exploiting synergies of respective comparative advantages, IBRD and IFC are helping 
Jamaica improve its competitiveness in the energy sector. The Energy Security and Efficiency 
Enhancement Project (ESEEP)19 is supporting Jamaica’s long-term goal to reduce its reliance on 
high and volatile oil imports. By supporting policy development and institutional capacity 
building in the energy sector, the WBG is helping the GoJ to diversify the supply of electricity 
through import of natural gas and development of domestic renewable energy resources (hydro, 
wind, and solar). The IFC has been investing in generation capacity, while IBRD expects to 
support public sector investments in efficiency and clean energy generation through public-
private partnerships.20 

36. 
The Bank has been successful in supporting the GoJ in developing policy and 
regulatory reforms for the provision of natural gas, energy efficiency and the expansion of 
renewables that could reduce dependence on imported oil.21 Strengthening the regulatory 
framework for private-public partnerships in the energy sector is underway in the Ministry of 
Science, Technology, Energy and Mining and the Office of Utilities Regulation. A Bank-funded 
TA is also supporting pre-feasibility studies for hydropower development; the development of 
natural gas regulations; an evaluation of the capacity of the power grid to accommodate 

19 The Bank does not provide direct investment to increase access or lower energy costs, therefore the specific outcome of increased energy 
security and efficiency through reduced electric company losses cannot be observed, and should not have been included in the Results Matrix.  
20 The CPSPR revised the target indicator for energy losses in the Results Framework downwards to 15.8 percent. However, because of fiscal 
space constraints, the GoJ has further postponed the investment intervention. 
21 Two regional studies that included Jamaica (“Mitigating Vulnerability to High and Volatile Oil Prices, Power sector experience in Latin

Jamaica to develop oil independence strategy.

renewable energy; and an assessment of needed modernizations of the electricity regulatory act. 
To strengthen the financial capabilities of Jamaican financial institutions to invest in clean 
energy, the Bank has established a line of credit/revolving facility through the Development 
Bank of Jamaica (DBJ) to provide retail financing to the private sector for energy efficiency and 
renewable energy investments. 

37. 
IFC has focused on investing in the energy sector to improve generation and 
transmission capacity. Participating with a US$22 million loan and mobilizing additional US$37 
million private investment in West Kingston Power Partners (a 65MW generating plant) IFC 
helped upgrade some of Jamaica’s aging generation capacity. As of June 30, 2013, IFC has two 
additional projects in the energy sector – Jamaica Public Service Company Ltd (US$37.5 
million), which aims at reducing distribution losses and expanding generation via small hydro 
and wind energy plants, and Jamaica Energy Partners (US$42.4 million, including US$25.5 
million via syndication) which is generating additional electricity. With investments in three out 
of the four large IPPs in Jamaica, IFC is playing a significant role in its energy sector by also 
leveraging private sector investment. IFC cumulative investments and syndication in the sector 
have amounted to US$309 million, financing a total of 315 MW out of total grid capacity of 800 
MW. Overall, IFC’s investments have reached 713,600 people via power generation and 
2,040,000 people via power transmission. 

38. 
IFC has contributed to improving Jamaica’s competitiveness by increasing its activities 
in transport, using PPP in coordination with IBRD, and in the financial sector. IFC was the 
transaction advisor to GoJ for the successful Air Jamaica privatization in 2010, and is providing 
advisory services on the privatization of the Norman Manley International Airport (NMIA) in 
Kingston. The NMIA privatization is the first transaction under a Memorandum of 
Understanding signed in early 2011 between IFC and DBJ for joint transaction execution on 
privatization policy, knowledge transfer, and capacity building. IFC has also been active in the 
financial sector via 2 outstanding loan operations to 2 local banks (National Commercial Bank of 
Jamaica, and First Global Bank), and working on Credit Bureau legislation, as part of a regional 
harmonization plan. MIGA also continues to provide guarantee insurance coverage to a foreign 
investor in the financial sector. 

39. 
The outcome related to reducing time for paying taxes has been partially achieved. The 
number of payments was reduced from 72 to 36, while the required time to comply with tax laws 
was reduced from 52 days to 36, which is below the target of 20 days.  

Results Area 6: Climate Resilience and Vulnerability Reduction 

40. 
The climate resilience and vulnerability reduction results cluster is rated moderately 
satisfactory. One outcome related to the policy level has been achieved ahead of target time; the 
second outcome – reduced landslide risks in 4 communities has been mostly achieved; and the 
third one is non-observable (not achieved) because of GoJ decision to delay implementation. 

42 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
41. 
To help integrate climate resilience in development strategies the Bank successfully 
supported the GoJ in developing its Strategic Program for Climate Resilience (SPCR 2030) 
that was presented and approved by the Pilot Program for Climate Resilience (PPCR)22 in 
November 2011. The Strategy is focusing on (i) piloting approaches for integration of climate 
risk and resilience into development policies and planning; (ii) strengthening capacities at the 
national level to integrate climate resilience into development planning; (iii) scaling and 
leveraging climate resilient investments; and (iv) enabling learning-by-doing and sharing of 
lessons23.  

42. 
Responding to a Government request, the Bank channeled EU grant funds towards 
reconstruction efforts after the passage of Tropical Storm Gustav ($1.8M). Seven schools and 5 
health centers were rehabilitated and disaster preparedness and maintenance training was 
provided for 45 people and 9 communities. The Hurricane Dean Economic Recovery Loan 
($9.99M) facilitated: (a) rehabilitation/construction of critical public infrastructure; (b) provided 
disaster response equipment, disaster simulation software, coastal multi-hazard maps and 
vulnerability assessment for three poor communities at risk; and (c) trained community members 
and youth first responders in community maintenance and disaster preparedness. In addition, a 
multi-hazard mapping and vulnerability assessment study was carried out to strengthen disaster 
risk management in three coastal communities. These Multi-Hazard Maps provide key data to 
inform the management of environmental, physical and social infrastructure and thereby 
reducing vulnerability.  

43. 
Important progress was made in reducing landslide risks in selected vulnerable 
communities on a pilot basis. The ongoing Community based Landslide Risk Reduction  (JSDF 
grant of $2.38 million) project is strengthening the capacity of the national disaster management 
agency on risk reduction and landslide risks and piloting a new methodology in four vulnerable 
communities. A key contribution is the provision of MoSSaiC, an evidence-based toolkit,24 for 
vulnerability reduction. The program provided training to 140 community leaders, government 
officials and trainers for Landslide Risk Reduction, including the four pilot communities, where 
the actual physical investments are under way. 

Results Area 7: Strengthened Governance 

44. 
The governance results area is considered by the CPS as a cross-cutting matter that 
seeks to contribute to (i) achieving a more efficient financial management and allocation of 
budget expenditures, and (ii) enhancing the internal and external controls by supporting Auditor-
General work in line with the new FRF. This results cluster is rated Moderately Satisfactory. Out 
of the four outcome indicators, 2 were achieved and 2 were partially achieved. 

22 The PPCR is one of the Climate Investment Funds (CIFs) -- interim funds developed by Multilateral Development Banks, participating 
countries and other stakeholders to bridge the financing gap prior to agreement on the next climate change regime. The PPCR was designed to 
enhance collaboration between MDBs and across Development Partners in assisting countries to address climate change adaptation. Therefore, 
the Jamaica PPCR is jointly implemented with the IDB. 
23 The PPCR will finance the SPCR to a tune of $25 million ($15 million in grants and $10 million in IDA-like concessional loan). This program 
is being jointly implemented with IDB. 
24 The Management of Slope Stability in Communities (MoSSaic) Regional toolkit was published in February 2013 and ODPEM has finalized 
five chapters of the Jamaica-specific toolkit. 

43 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                 
45. 
A medium-term budgeting was introduced and a new prioritization tool for the public 
investment program of six ministries (that account for 91 percent of the central Government 
budget) has been adopted. Progress on multi-year perspective in fiscal planning, expenditure 
policy and budgeting has been confirmed by PEFA repeat assessment (Feb 2013) from C+ rating 
(PEFA indicator 12, 2007) to B in 2013. The indicator on scope, nature and follow up of external 
audits was not rated by this PEFA evaluation, leaving this outcome without rating.  

46. 
The Bank supported the government in the implementation of its Auditor-General’s 
operational plan and the development of internal audit plans within the ministries to enhance 
availability and timeliness of public financial management information, and improved 
accountability in the use of public resources.25 The AG made notable progress in improving the 
quality of audits. The AG is conducting both compliance and performance audits in selected 
areas, and the audit of the consolidated accounts of Government is done in a timely manner.  

47. 
The Bank is also piloting the Use of Country Systems for environmental and social 
safeguards in Jamaica. The Jamaica Social Investment Fund (JSIF) has adopted policies 
equivalent to the Bank’s environmental and involuntary resettlement safeguards. The diagnostic 
work and institutional strengthening measures undertaken with JSIF were essential for JSIF 
becoming the only public entity in the region to receive an ISO 14001 certification for 
environmental management systems in 2009. The government has expressed interest in getting 
additional support to capitalize on the positive experience and scale it up to other agencies. 

IV. BANK GROUP PERFORMANCE 

48. 
The Bank performance is rated as good. The CPS was highly relevant, and aligned with 
the Government’s Vision 2030 and Medium term development strategy. The design and 
implementation of the program successfully contributed to the pursuit of the key CPS objectives 
and was adjusted on a timely basis to changing circumstances and priorities, including specific 
requests from the GoJ. The design and implementation of the program contributed to achieving 
most of the expected CPS outcomes, or set the track for reaching them in the future. The WBG 
accompanied the GoJ in its efforts to operationalize Vision 2030 by supporting the development 
and implementation of strategic policy and institutional changes while addressing the aftermath 
of the global economic crisis. The country team leveraged significant sources of funding and 
partner collaboration to provide consistent support to the GoJ agenda implementation. A sound 
program of tested and successful activities is in place for the next strategy period. 

49. 
The performance was constrained by the political transition and limited capacity on the 
ground for implementation in the expected timeframe. Resubmission to Parliament of several 
previously adopted laws has delayed implementation of some public sector reforms. For 
example, the Debt Management Law that was approved by the former Government had to be 
reconsidered by the new Government. In some instances, timeframes were unrealistic, 
particularly, when promoting innovative and/or complex reforms (taxation, audit, divestiture of 
state owned enterprises). In addition, because of limited fiscal space, some programs experienced 
delays in receiving counterpart funds such as planned investment operations in energy and basic 
services. 

25 The timeliness of annual appropriation accounts submission of selected MDAs to Auditor General has improved from 53 outstanding accounts 
in 2010, to 22, as of March 2011.

A.  DESIGN AND RELEVANCE 

50. 
Extensive consultations and deep understanding of the conditions and development 
challenges of Jamaica have underpinned the CPS design. The strategic areas of engagement 
were carefully selected by the country team to be consistent with key building blocks of the 
Government strategy, while reflecting WBG comparative advantages. The CPS framework and 
results areas were appropriately defined to address two sets of challenges: promoting long term 
growth through broad-based and inclusive institutional reforms for sustainable poverty reduction; 
and addressing the immediate country needs to weather the external shocks and stabilize the 
economy while providing safety nets to most vulnerable populations. Consideration of other 
development partners’ programs and synergies with IFC were part of the CPS design in the areas 
of fiscal and debt sustainability, strengthening non-labor competitiveness, and governance. 

51. 
The design of WBG interventions for achieving the CPS objectives was relevant and 
the mix of instruments appropriate. The nature of the country challenges required a thoughtful 
combination and consistency of instruments and an appropriate balance between budget support, 
investment lending, TA, and advisory services. There was a strong dependability between AAA 
and financing, particularly in the areas of policy reforms. As shown in the Results Matrix, most 
of the WBG activities involved extensive knowledge transfer, policy advice and technical 
assistance that provided choices between different policy alternatives and proposals. The 
adequacy of the program mix is reflected in the design and implementation of a DPL series to 
address the macroeconomic issues, concurrently with several transformational operations like the 
Early Childhood Development Program, Social Protection Project, REDI, and Inner City Basic 
Services Project to address difficult social issues.  

52. While some of the interventions required longer than the CPS time horizon, calculated 
risks were embraced to develop and implement innovative activities that laid the ground for 
longer term development impact. In particular, the program design was flexible to leverage TF 
resources (critical to a financed strapped economy) to finance activities like climate adaptation; 
to test research findings and new approaches in areas like Crime and Violence and Youth 
employment; and to adapt lessons learned from other countries to Jamaica’s social protection 
needs.   

53. 
The design of the results framework was aligned with the WBG’s commitments and 
most of the outcome indicators were relevant for measuring progress towards and achievement 
of CPS objectives. However, some outcome indicators were associated with longer term 
activities than the CPS timeframe, and proved to be too ambitious, particularly with respect to 
the institutional reforms outlined in the DPL series, and the GoJ fiscal constraints that have 
impacted the investments in the energy and rural sectors. Nevertheless, the achieved results are 
in line with initial expectations and targeted outcomes. In hindsight, the design of the results 
framework could have been less ambitious and more attuned to the limited implementation 
capacity on the ground and the constrained fiscal space. Despite these limitations, the WBG 
succeeded in delivering on most of the CPS outcomes.  

45 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
54. 
The CPS design recognized critical risks, identified mitigating measures, and 
incorporated flexibility for innovation. The impact of the global crisis and the vulnerability of 
the economy to external shocks (including natural disasters) were important factors in the 
development of the WBG program. Taking advantage of the full range of instruments and 
products offered by the WBG, the country team made priority adjustments or reallocated 
resources (human, financial and budgetary) to respond to emerging needs (Tropical Storm 
Gustav, Hurricane Dean), introduced innovative programs (“Digital Jam 2.0” and “KingstOOn”) 
to generate youth employment opportunities in times of crises. The adverse impacts were 
successfully mitigated through program financing adjustments in collaboration with other 
development partners. Concerted efforts by the CDB, IDB, IMF and the WBG have contributed 
to protect critical social expenditures, while pursuing the objectives of achieving fiscal 
consolidation and unlocking growth. 

B. IMPLEMENTATION 

55. 
The Bank followed the overall thrust of the CPS, while managing program risks and 
making adjustments in response to the impact of the global crisis and other shocks. The Bank 
responded quickly to the crisis with a series of DPLs helping stabilize the economy and the 
worsening fiscal and debt situation. The success of the Bank’s program implementation was due 
to the fact that the CPS was well aligned with the priorities of the GoJ, and well-coordinated with 
its development partners.  

Bank Lending 
56. 
The investment lending portfolio delivered the intended results: transformational, 
particularly in the areas of social protection, urban development (linked to crime and violence 
prevention), education and rural development. All potential investment projects identified in 
the CPS were carried out, except for the Energy generation project. TFs were used to respond 
quickly to natural disasters (Tropical Storm Gustav, Hurricane Dean and Sandy). Over the CPS 
period the IFC portfolio expanded significantly and MIGA’s portfolio remained at planned levels 
of operations. 

57. 
Delivery of WBG commitments during the CPS period was generally in line with initial 
expectations. The CPS included seven operations, of which four were lending (2 DPOs and 3 
investment lending) and two TF operations. This represented a total commitment of US$315 
million (excluding TF operations); lower than the planned US$425 million for FY10 and FY11.  
This difference is due to: a change in allocation for the Energy Efficiency project from $24 
million to $15 million; and split of the second $200 million DPL into two with $100 million 
disbursed in 2011 and the second dropped when the IMF program went off track in mid-2011. 
The new Government, elected in December 2011, delayed policy decisions and reform 
implementation in a deteriorating macroeconomic environment. During this period, the WBG 
coordinated with the IMF and IDB the design of a new financing package – IMF Extended Fund 
Facility (EFF) and WBG and IDB programs to support the Government agenda. The EFF was 
approved in May 2013.  

58. 
Trust Fund resources served as a vital complement to the Bank’s program of lending 
operations, technical assistance, and analytical work.  During the CPS period a total of 

46 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
US$11.4 million in Bank and Recipient Executed Trust Funds were leveraged. These TFs have 
been effectively used in the areas of debt management, strengthening of parliamentary oversight 
over public finance, climate change, social protection and crime and violence prevention. Trust 
funds also supported analytical and diagnostic work on a number of critical issues: statistical 
capacity and fiscal reform, poverty and social impacts analysis, and youth entrepreneurship. 

IBRD Portfolio 
59. 
The current portfolio is solid, healthy and mature. The portfolio as of February 2014 
consists of five projects with net commitments of $283 million and an average age of 4.5 years 
(See Table 3). All projects are expected to achieve their Development Objectives, and two 
projects have been extended. The latest ISRs rate four out of five active projects as satisfactory 
or moderately satisfactory and only one as moderately unsatisfactory on the likelihood of 
achieving their Development Objectives and Implementation Progress. The disbursement ratio 
has steadily improved from 17 percent (FY09) to 35.1 percent (end of FY13). The two projects 
that closed between FY10 and FY12 were rated as Satisfactory by IEG. During the course of 
CPS implementation, the limited fiscal space has impacted projects implementation with 
shortage of necessary counterpart funds (Education Transformation and Early Childhood 
Development projects). The GoJ has been working with the Bank to fully fund those projects. 
There are no projects or commitments at risk.

Fiduciary risks remain high requiring Team Leaders to pay particular attention to 
institutional capacity during implementation. The recent CPPR identified procurement capacity 
as a key bottleneck for project execution, followed by readiness for implementation of new 
projects. It also highlighted that the high quality of the portfolio was due to the following key 
factors: (i) Coordination between the GoJ, WBG and other development partners; (ii) Monitoring 
and Evaluation, and good data collection; (iii) Monitoring safeguard issues and compliance; and 
(iv) Following-up on Disbursements. 

IFC Portfolio 
61. 
During FY10-FY13, the IFC portfolio increased from US$150 million to nearly 
US$280 million providing significant additionality to the IBRD program. IFC committed a 
total of US$200 million, including US$58 million from syndicating banks. As of June 2013, IFC 
disbursed and committed portfolio totaled US$196 million and US$198 million respectively. 
Syndicated loans outstanding (B loans), for which IFC is a lender, amounted to US$82 million. 

47 

 
 
  
 
 
 
IFC’s investment portfolio consists of eight active operations, and five advisory service projects 
supporting MSMEs, Credit Bureau, Investment Climate and Public Private Partnerships for a 
total of US$3.9 million. Jamaica is currently the IFC’s largest outstanding exposure in the 
Caribbean.  

Analytic and Advisory Activities (AAA) 
62. 
Feedback from Government counterparts suggests that AAA products have been highly 
valued. The Bank’s Economic and Sector Work (ESW) and Technical Assistance (TA) were 
deemed very useful for the country policy dialogue and reform initiatives. The policy-based 
support was complemented with institutional capacity building for the National Statistical 
Institute; the Debt Management Unit; the Public Expenditure Division; and line ministries, 
funded by TFs. A Country Economic Memorandum (CEM)26 and a social impact analysis of tax 
reforms27 provided diagnostic and analytical support to the Government in developing the reform 
policies and strategies.  

63. 
The WBG has improved its knowledge and insights of Jamaica’s constraints and 
challenges through a number of analytical and diagnostic studies that helped strengthening the 
quality of its own work, as well as influenced key policy decisions in Jamaica. The Country 
Economic Memorandum (CEM, FY11) provides deep analysis of the key causes that have stalled 
Jamaica’s economy over the past four decades and presents recommendations to unlock its 
growth potential. While the report’s objective is to identify the main constraints to longer term 
growth in Jamaica, it also serves as a complement to the Planning Institute of Jamaica (PIOJ) 
growth strategy: “Growth Inducement Strategy for Jamaica in the Short and Medium Term.” 
These reports have served as critical diagnostic inputs in the design of the new WBG strategy.  

64. 
Sectoral and specific ESW have helped improve policy discussions in Jamaica on vital 
issues and underpinned important policy decisions. For example, The Poverty and Social 
Impact Analysis (PSIA): “Jamaica: Poverty and Social Impacts of Fiscal Reforms” explores the 
distributional effects of the package of fiscal reforms initiated by the GoJ and supported by the 
Bank under the programmatic fiscal sustainability DPL series with a focus on two reform actions 
likely to have the most significant impacts: (1) tax reform and (2) public sector reform. It 
informed the GoJ on the possible options for mitigating the negative impact of these reforms on 
vulnerable populations. The analytical work on Managing Nurse Migration and Non-
Communicable Disease (NCD) has provided guidance and recommendations for improved health 
sector policies and human resource management in Jamaica and at the regional level. The report 
“Jamaica’s Effort in Improving Universal Access with Fiscal Constraints” addressed the issues 
Jamaica faces in reaching universal health coverage. Two regional studies that included Jamaica 
(energy and implications of the financial crisis on the energy sector) have provided analytical 
underpinning and options for Jamaica to develop oil independence strategy. 
Monitoring and Evaluation 

26 One of the key findings of the study is that Jamaica's disappointing economic performance is traceable to low productivity caused, inter alia by 
distortionary tax incentives combined with 'enclave' development that does not spill over to the rest of the economy. World Bank. 2011. Jamaica -

65. 
Country-level systems for poverty, economic, and human development monitoring are 
being strengthened through government efforts and multilateral development partners’ 
support, including the Bank. The government has set up a national M&E coordinating unit 
within the PIOJ, and is establishing Ministerial Focal Points to monitor the MTEF 
implementation and the expected social outcomes. Building M&E capacity within the Ministries 
remains a key priority. The Bank has provided a Statistics trust fund to help develop the national 
statistics strategy.  

Partnerships 
66. 
The WBG established a successful track record of collaboration with partners in 
Lending and Trust Fund activities and in stimulating a dialogue on growth and 
competitiveness with the GoJ and the civil society. Collaboration among development partners 
on the growth and competitiveness agenda, and on improving fiscal policies and social protection 
programs is an important national priority. The WBG together with CDB, IDB and EU has 
provided budget support and additional programs to mitigate the impact of the global crisis and 
protect social gains, together with operations supported by multilateral and bilateral partners 
(IMF, EU, CDB and IDB). IBRD collaborated closely with the IMF, IDB and the EU in the 
context of structuring the new IMF arrangement with the GoJ. The innovative work on Digital 
Jam 2.0 and KingstOOn was done in collaboration with USAID and CIDA. Technical 
cooperation and knowledge sharing serve as a basis for successful implementation of these 
programs. IFC advisory program and several of the IBRD TA initiatives in the Caribbean are 
also funded by CIDA, DFID and USAID.  

V. MANAGING RISKS 

67. 
The risks originally identified in the CPS were well managed. The CPS anticipated the 
potential impact of the global crisis and the vulnerability of the economy to external shocks. The 
strategy successfully mitigated this impact through program adjustments and coordinated 
financing with other development partners. Concerted efforts by the CDB, IDB, IMF and IBRD 
have contributed to protect critical social expenditure, while pursuing the objectives of achieving 
fiscal consolidation and unlocking growth. In support of this process, policy dialogue and 
technical assistance in the areas of debt management, medium-term budgeting, parliamentary 
oversight of budgeting process, prioritization of public investments, and communication on 
policy reforms have improved the GoJ capacity to manage the economy. Fiduciary and 
institutional capacity risks have been mitigated by having the same fiduciary team cover all Bank 
projects in the country portfolio and provide regular training for implementing agencies on 
financial management and procurement. 

68. 
The Bank also helped Jamaica manage its high vulnerability to multiple natural 
disaster risks--particularly floods and hurricanes. The Government has insurance against 
catastrophic natural disasters: Jamaica participates in the Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance 
Facility (CCRIF), which helps to offset financing costs in the case of a significant, 1-in-15 year 
disaster. The Bank is also assisting Jamaica through: (i) investments in natural disaster risk 
mitigation; (ii) development of a risk atlas; (iii) a community-based risk reduction pilot; and (iv) 
exploration of weather-related risk insurance for agriculture.

Legal aspects of the reform process 
can lead to extensive delays that 
may affect other key activities. 
Some delays in approval of the 
JTC Bill, arising from the need for 
extensive 
consultations with 
teachers 
unions 
and 
other 
stakeholders, 
led 
to delays 
in

Efficiency 

The program focused on regulatory 
policy reform and institutional capacity 
building 
in 
the energy sector with 
medium to long-term results expected in 
terms of reducing utility losses and 
subsequent energy costs. Given 
the 
importance of the energy sector to the 
Jamaican economy, the government has 
requested a 
follow-up project with 
specific investments to improve energy 
efficiency and/or increase clean energy 
supply. The Bank is currently exploring 

53 

The Bank’s intervention has shown 
that training on a wide range of 
technical, operational, legal, and 
marketing issues is in high demand 
and 
is 
critical 
for 
ensuring 
sustainability of the investments. 

High electricity costs are one of the 
primary constraints to growth and 
development in Jamaica. The new

are 
needed to transition Jamaica away 
from heavy and costly reliance on

ANNEX 3: SUMMARY OF CONSULTATIONS IN JAMAICA 

Introduction 
The current CPS was developed through a combination of the participatory consultation 
process, experience of experts in the field, lessons learned from the previous CPS and an 
independent client survey. Discussions and ideas emerging from the youth events of Digital 
Jam 2.0 and KingstOON and the CGF’s Jamaica Chapter were also used to inform the CPS. 
This annex is a summary of the consultations held between January and September 2013. 

Overview of the Consultation Process 
The consultation process was designed using a participatory approach across all spectrums 
of Jamaican society. Among the groups consulted were: (i) senior government officials, (ii) 
academia and think tanks, (iii) international development partners, (iv) parliamentarians, 
(v) private sector, (vi) civil society, (vii) trade unionists, (viii) youth groups, (ix) poor and 
challenged groups living in vulnerable communities and (ix) the opposition. 

The purpose of the consultation with the senior government officials was to discuss the 
Government of Jamaica’s (GOJ) development priorities. Both the Government and the 
WBG made presentations that facilitated discussions on the following: (i) GOJ key 
development challenges and opportunities; (ii) lessons learned from past WBG support; 
(iii) broader debt and growth strategies of the GOJ including the new IMF agreement; and 
(iv) a proposed approach and priority areas for the new CPS. As a result, three development 
objectives were identified: (1) Fiscal Environment and Public Sector Reform; (2) Growth 
and Competitiveness; and (3) Reducing Vulnerabilities and Building Resilience. These 
pillars are consistent with the GOJ’s Medium Term Socio-Economic Policy Framework 
2012-2015 and the WBG’s strategy to end extreme poverty and boost shared prosperity. 

The purpose of the consultations with non-government entities was to present the plan for 
the CPS according to the three development objectives and get the perspective of these 
groups on WBG support and its relevance to the development needs of Jamaica. The 
objectives of the consultations were: (i) to get the perspectives of each group on the main 
challenges faced in Jamaica, and (ii) to receive feedback on the WBG’s present and future 
role to support Jamaica’s development objectives. In particular, the WBG had extensive 
consultations with youth groups and youths living in vulnerable communities.  

The high unemployment rate amongst the youth (38 percent), and crime and violence 
challenges particularly amongst young women, made this group both highly vulnerable to 
negative economic shifts, yet potentially highly productive under the right economic 
growth conditions. Each consultation followed the same format. A presentation was made 
by the WBG on the proposed areas for support and the participants were asked to give 
feedback on how the WBG could support the development objectives of the country.  

Participants’ opinions and recommendations 
The dialogue was open and free-flowing in all consultations. Participants were animated 
and honest in expressing their opinions and gave valuable recommendations. The 

58 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
discussion was opened by the WBG on the purpose of the consultation, current WBG work 
in Jamaica and the three broad areas proposed for support. The challenges faced and 
recommendations were discussed according to each area. 

All participants agreed with the themes of the three pillars and felt that the WBG would be 
able to provide adequate support if the program was structured around these three areas. In 
all consultations the participants expressed concern for the debt and the cost of doing 
business in Jamaica. It was agreed that immediate action needed to be taken to increase 
economic growth, reduce the cost of energy and to reenergize investments.  

Public sector modernization was of great interest to the participants who all agreed that the 
public service needed to be revamped in order to improve government’s efficiency and 
effectiveness. Almost all participants felt that the government efficiency was hindered by 
outdated technology and heavily bureaucratic systems. The youth groups in particular 
mentioned their willingness to support Government’s digitalization as it would create jobs 
for them while increasing institutional efficiency, effectiveness and accountability. 

The majority of participants agreed that investments in the agro-industry would 
significantly help economic diversification. However, they felt that existing agriculture 
industry was not attractive to the youth due to the lack of technology and the weak link 
between investment and returns. Very few of the youth mentioned agriculture as possibility 
for employment and referred to potential opportunities in the ICT industries. It was 
suggested that the WBG could assist by helping to improve technology, marketability of 
produce and adherence to international standards that would increase exports potentials. 

Participants highlighted skills labour mismatch in the market and noted that graduates of 
secondary and tertiary institutions were not adequately equipped for the job market. Many 
felt that education and skills needed to be aligned with the needs of the economy. It was 
suggested that further research be done to determine the skills of the future and that 
universities and vocational institutions needed to be prodded in the right direction to equip 
graduates with the relevant skills for the job market. 

Summary of Consultations by Group 

Senior Government Officials 
The government officials were keen on focusing WBG support to areas that have affected 
economic growth including, (i) bottlenecks such as the high cost of energy; (ii) limited 
room to maneuver on the fiscal side and a narrow tax base which places high rates on those 
sectors and agencies that actually pay tax; and (iii) the lack of resilience of the economy 
and its response to macroeconomic and other shocks including weather related events. 
Additionally the group requested support to (i)public sector modernization including e-
government to consolidate human resource management and providing a single tax 
window; (ii) growth initiatives such as the logistics hub master plan which would be a 
major income earner for the country; (iii) climate change initiatives, reef regulation and 
institutional development; (iv) education and skills training; (v) the improvement and 

59 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
expansion of the National Insurance Scheme program; (vi) legislation to mitigate 
discrimination; (vii) employment insurance; (viii) and migration policy for skills retention. 
Suggestions were made to add crime and public safety to the strategy as risks and reallocate 
funds earmarked for health to education. 

Academia and Think Tanks 
Overall the group approved of the proposed areas for support. They (i) expressed concern 
for government capacity to implement public sector reform, properly manage data and 
maintain software with the introduction of e-government; (ii) suggested that the WBG 
assist businesses to know and adhere to international standards; and (iii) highlighted the 
agro industry as a key area for support and the impact of praedial larceny on the industry. 
Additionally the group briefly discussed pension coverage, risk management, improved 
language skills, WBG portfolio targeting and governance. They commented that the REDI 
project was too limited in its targeting and suggested that it be expanded to incorporate 
more actors and be more focused on knowledge sharing and issues of governance. 

Trade Union Leaders 
The trade union leaders felt that the areas for support were in keeping with their own work 
towards a comprehensive labour market reform. Throughout the discussions they placed 
great emphasis on developing a program for the working poor, as well as the revamping of 
the pension system. They felt that the WBG could (i) provide technical assistance to the 
government to draft a workforce adjustment policy that would better protect the rights of 
workers in a transition particularly with planned changes in the Tax Administration of 
Jamaica and Jamaica Customs; (ii) support education, innovation and skills training which 
needs to be more relevant to the workforce of today and the future and influencing a change 
in educational institutions; and (iii) work with the government to produce a proper national 
identification system. They assured the WBG that they were not opposed to reform. 

International Development Partners 
The consultations with international development partners identified the following priority 
areas: (i) vocational and skills training and preparation for market needs; (ii) tackling youth 
unemployment; (iii) improved donor coordination of activities and strengthening the 
capacity of the Planning Institute of Jamaica; (iv) attention to community based resource 
management and assisting government to improve environmental policies; and (v) creating 
an enabling business environment by reducing the costs of energy, doing business and 
addressing crime and corruption. 

Civil Society Organizations 
The leaders of civil society organizations were in agreement with the three pillars for the 
CPS as presented by the WBG and noted that it was an ‘excellent agenda to build on”. 
While the three themes would cover all areas in need of development assistance, they felt 
that climate change, poverty reduction needed to be worded into the pillars. They also felt 
that the purpose could be reframed towards issues of equity and social inclusion and then 
build out from that. Additionally they: (i) emphasized the need for climate change efforts to 
go beyond infrastructure; (ii) noted that international development partners needed to put 

60 

 
 
 
 
 
 
more pressure on the government to address governance issues; (iii) would like youth 
unemployment to be tackled; (iv) would like to see an improvement in the consultative 
process; and (v) felt that venture capital was critical to growth of innovative businesses. 

Youth Leaders and Groups 
The youth welcomed WBG support in all these areas and outlined the most important 
priorities as (i) improvement of accountability and transparency in the public sector; (ii) the 
importance of e-commerce and the use of technology in the public sector; (iii) improved 
public sector efficiency in service and delivery; (iv) rural development and youth 
employment through agriculture; (v) the cost of energy, its impact on businesses and 
standard of living and the need to use of alternative sources; and (vi) the development of an 
awareness campaign to effectively educate the population of the development agenda.  

Poor and Challenged Groups  
The poor and challenged living in vulnerable communities spoke candidly on the issues of: 
(i) public sector modernization to improve efficiency within the public sector; (ii) 
connectivity especially for the rural poor who could benefit from telecommuting; (iii) 
proper streamlining of the national identification system; (iv) access to finance and 
guidance in business plan development; (v) praedial larceny; and (vi) unemployment.  

Private Sector  
The consultation with private sector (inclusive of membership organizations, business 
leaders in banking, manufacturing, retail and ICT sectors) elicited the following views: (i) 
the cost of electricity, praedial larceny and crime are major hindrances for growth and 
strongly affected MSMEs; (ii) the logistics hub initiative has potentials but would require 
the right business environment; and (iii) the focus for the growth and competitiveness 
should be on the investment climate, skills and logistic connectivity. The group welcomed 
WBG support to: (i) public sector modernization and reducing current public sector 
inefficiencies and bureaucracy which negatively impacted doing business; and (ii) 
improving access to finance for MSMEs and assisting to manage insolvency and 
restructuring loans. A suggestion was made to provide the Scientific Research Council with 
a subsidy so that they could lower the cost of giving support to farmers and agribusiness.  

Parliamentarians 
The parliamentarians suggested WBG support to address the issues of: (i) inclusion and 
consideration of the disabled community in planning, consultations and programs; (ii) 
agriculture as a part of the growth agenda and the associated risks; (iii) solutions and 
innovative approaches to youth unemployment (iv) energy and the cost of doing business; 
(v) functional literacy and its impact on growth; (vi) inflation and its impact on growth; and 
(vii) bureaucracy and inefficiencies in the public sector.  

Opposition 
The opposition: (i) strongly urged the WBG to narrow the focus of its program so as to 
increase impact; (iii) suggested support to the energy sector could be most transformative; 
and (iii) emphasized that an impact could only be made through a demonstration effect.

ANNEX 4: THE CARIBBEAN GROWTH FORUM 
The CGF is a multi-stakeholder platform designed to identify, prioritize and implement a 
set of activities to improve the growth enabling environment in the Caribbean28, while 
promoting participatory public policy making. It has so far engaged more than 2,500 
representatives from business associations, civil society organizations, Government, private 
sector, media, indigenous groups, and international development agencies on themes such 
as Logistics and Connectivity; Investment Climate; and, Skills and Productivity.  
Low growth, high unemployment, especially for youth and women, high debt ratios (eight 
of the top twelve most indebted countries in the world are in Caribbean), high incidence of 
crime, and, growing vulnerability to external shocks characterize the region. In the wake of 
the global financial crisis, the high debt/low growth challenge has become even more acute.  
A number of Caribbean countries reached out to international donors to find an innovative 
approach to the growth challenge in the region. After agreeing to a genuinely participatory 
growth initiative and following consultations and preparatory work, the program started in 
mid-2012 with a regional launch in Jamaica. The CGF is supported and facilitated by the 
Bank, IDB, CDB, Compete Caribbean and the EU. 
Key Outcomes 
One year into the initiative, positive outcomes are already tangible: twelve countries 
formally joined the process by establishing their national CGF chapter and completing the 
first phase of national dialogue. This effort has led to the prioritization of concrete and 
actionable activities and, in seven of the twelve countries, draft action plans are now 
available, with details on each activity’ implementation plan.  
The results of each country’s dialogue were presented at a regional forum in The Bahamas 
in June 2013. This allowed national stakeholders from government, private sector and civil 
society to compare notes on each other’s’ priorities and exchange ideas on solutions to each 
identified challenges with technical specialists and peers. The high-level attendance (e.g., 
nine ministers, several Permanent Secretaries and Directors, over 300 private sector, 
technical level officials and civil society representatives) sent a strong signal in terms of 
both ownership and credibility. The Bahamas Communiqué issued by the Government of 
The Bahamas during the event on behalf of CGF participating countries, attested to the 
commitment of all parties to inclusive and participatory policy-making, accountability and 
transparency in policy implementation as well as the CGF reform process itself. Each 
government also committed to follow-up on implementation of the reform agenda, to report 
back periodically on progress (every 4-5 months) and to enable independent monitoring of 
the reforms by private sector and civil society representatives. The Dominican Republic 
held its first Accountability Workshop in December 3, 2013. It should be followed by 
Jamaica, Saint Lucia, Antigua and Barbuda, and Dominica by the end of January 2014. 
Participation in the process so far has been high, at both national and regional events 
(including national chapters’ kick-off events and subsequent working group meetings). 
Extensive media coverage also confirmed the importance of the initiative.

The structure and format of the CGF has also fostered a culture of transparency and 
accountability: all information pertaining to the CGF process, all minutes and background 
information are available online on the CGF website29. A balanced scorecard system will 
be used by Governments to report periodically on each activity they agreed to implement, 
while independent observatories are being established as a consortium of private sector, 
academia and civil society organizations in each country. This constructive engagement of 
all stakeholders is allowing finding solutions to the growth challenge collaboratively and 
providing feedback on reforms results for citizens. 
The CGF also helped generate and disseminate technical knowledge to inform policy 
making, including 14 thematic technical notes, a report on debt, ten private sector 
assessments, and a quarterly bulletin on Caribbean Economies since the beginning of the 
process, providing useful technical inputs, and entry points for further engagement. This 
will continue for the following year to address existing gaps and stimulate discussion in 
new areas. National and regional dialogues have also helped identify emerging analytical 
gaps above and beyond current areas of interventions, such as energy generation, efficiency 
and distribution, or financial sector. Country ownership is not only ensuring high and broad 
participation of all stakeholders to the process, it is also feeding critical information in the 
national consultations on the development strategies in The Bahamas, Dominica, and Saint 
Vincent and the Grenadines, while at the same time helping align development partners in 
defining their multiannual programming strategies.  
In addition, CGF events have served as important catalyst for WBG, CDB, Compete 
Caribbean and IDB teams’ engagement with each country, as evidenced by increasing 
levels of exchange and dialogue since June 2012. Already a number of new lending and 
non-lending operations are being put in the pipeline, tackling reform priorities identified 
during CGF dialogues. A special CGF facility to fund the implementation of reforms in 
individual countries has been created, and over US$6 million have been allocated for TA. 
Two new lending operations in Antigua and Barbuda and Grenada are now incorporating 
CGF proposals into their plans. As such, the CGF has been an effective mechanism for 
development partner coordination. The continued engagement of the UK DfiD and the 
Canadian DFATD as well as the increased interest of partners such as the EU, which joined 
the CGF in June 2013, is a strong sign of the relevance of the CGF as a vehicle for 
engagement in promoting sustainable growth in the region. 
Finally, the CGF process has helped identify concrete priorities for regional integration30. 
The inclusion of regional organizations in the process, such as CARICOM, the OECS 
Secretariat, the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank or the Caribbean Telecommunication 
Union, aims to engage them in supporting the implementation of those regional proposals. 
Going forward and parallel to the consolidation of progress achieved in each country, the 
coming months should also help identify new reform priorities on which to engage public 
sector, private sector, and civil society at both national and regional levels above and 
beyond the three thematic pillars of the first year.

ANNEX 5: GENDER ISSUES 
In Jamaica, a strong framework for advancing gender equality is in place. The 
Constitution of Jamaica requires equality before the law for men and women and includes a 
non-discrimination clause that explicitly mentions gender. A number of legislative acts 
were adopted to address gender inequality, including the Domestic Violence Act and the 
Equal Pay for Men and Women Act. Jamaica has made commitments for gender equality 
and has an ratified major international conventions aimed at advancing gender equality, 
including the Convention on All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) and 
the Inter-American Convention on the Prevention, Punishment and Eradication of Violence 
Against Women (Convention of Belém do Pará). 
The Government of Jamaica has committed to redressing long-term systemic 
discrimination against women in the National Development Plan. Further, the National 
Policy for Gender Equality (2011-2015) lays out foundations for gender mainstreaming in 
policies and programs, and the Bureau of Women’s Affairs is responsible for promoting 
and supporting the implementation of the Policy. Moreover, there is a Gender Sector Plan 
to address gender both as a result per se and as a crosscutting area of concern in specific 
sectors. There is also a National Strategic Action Plan to Eliminate Gender-Based Violence 
in Jamaica that identifies six priority areas of action. Results towards gender equality over 
the last decade have been mixed: while some indicators have improved, others stalled or 
even changed for the worse (such as maternal mortality ratio). 
As in the Caribbean region in general, in Jamaica gender disadvantage in terms of 
educational outcomes changes depending on education level. In terms of primary 
enrollment rates, girls are at a slight disadvantage; while at secondary levels, boys are less 
likely to be enrolled (female to male enrollment ratios are 95.3 and 103.2, respectively)31. 
Male disadvantage becomes exacerbated at tertiary education, where the ratio of enrollment 
rates reaches 228.8—the highest in the region, and almost twice the size of regional 
average of 126.8. For both genders educational attainment dramatically dropped over the 
last decade: for example, between 2000 and 2010 primary completion rates decreased from 
90 percent to 73 percent for girls and from 86 percent to 74 percent for boys. 
Some reproductive health outcomes are alarmingly high: maternal mortality ratio at 110 
deaths per 100,000 births exceeds the regional average of 80. This is also a significant 
regression: in 2000 maternal mortality ratio of 83 only marginally exceeded the regional 
average. High maternal mortality ratio is especially concerning, given that nearly all 
women (99%) receive prenatal care, and nearly all births (98%) are attended by skilled 
staff, both indicators above the regional averages (90% and 96%, respectively). 
Economic opportunities: Female labor force participation in Jamaica at 56 percent is 
marginally higher than LAC average of 53 percent. Similarly, female to male labor force 
participation rate of 0.82 exceeds the regional and world averages (0.67 and 0.73, 
respectively). Unemployment is an enormous problem in Jamaica, especially among youth. 
In 2011, 38 percent of young (15-24) women and 24 percent of young men were

(2008 - 2011).

unemployed. Unemployment affects women to a larger extent than men: the adult female to 
male unemployment ratio is 1.79 and the ratio for youth is 1.59 (2011). These disparities 
are considerably larger than for LAC region on average (1.66 and 1.52, respectively) and 
the world averages (1.43 and 1.34, respectively). 
Although adolescent fertility in Jamaica reduced since 2000 from 87 births per 1,000 
women aged 15 to 19 to 71 in 2010, it remains higher than the world average of 47.8. 
Domestic violence is also high: according to the RHS from 2008-9, 17.2 percent women 
aged 15 to 49, ever married or in a union reported having been physically assaulted by their 
partners. According to available data32, the most common forms of gender-based violence 
in Jamaica include domestic violence, rape or sexual assault, childhood sexual abuse and 
sexual harassment, and the most vulnerable population group is the youth. 
Violent crime is also high, and affects primarily men: the youth (15-29) homicide rate is 
extremely high for males at 188 per 100,000; to be compared to 14.8 per 100,000 for 
females. The world averages for homicide rates are 19.4 for males and 4.4 for females. 
Also, males account for over 80 percent of hospital admissions for violence related injuries; 
over a third of those are under the age of 30. 
Political representation of women is low: only 13 percent of parliamentary seats were 
held by women in 2011, virtually the same fraction as in 2000.  
A Gender Diagnostic is under preparation. The study will provide gender disaggregated 
basic poverty trends and gender indicators linked to the areas of focus of the National 
Development Plan, as well as analysis of the legal framework for gender equality.

ANNEX 6: SUMMARY OF THE JAMAICA COUNTRY CLIENT SURVEY FY 2013 

The Country Client Survey was conducted between April and May 2013 to assess the 
relationship between the Jamaica Country Office of the World Bank Group (WBG) and its 
stakeholders. The last survey was conducted in 2010. The sample cut across respondents from 
the private and public sectors, academia and civil society. There was a respectable response 
rate of 68 percent (108 of the 160 stakeholders invited to participate). 

Perhaps the most significant finding was the reported level of familiarity with the work of the 
World Bank Group in Jamaica. This year’s familiarity rating of 8.2 (on a 10 point scale) 
marked a significant upswing from the 6.6 registered in the last survey conducted for FY10. 
Additionally the WBG’s ratings for relevance, alignment with development priorities and 
strategic realism (8.2, 7.7 and 7.6 respectively) have shown a marginal increase since FY10 
(7.3, 6.5 and 6.4 respectively). The data indicated four key points of significance in the current 
findings with respect to client perception: 
Development priorities: There was a shift from crime and violence to jobs and education as 
the main areas of concern, with some emphasis as well on equity in terms of shared 
opportunities. In this regard clients mooted that jobs and education were the two areas where 
the WBG could add most value to Jamaica. 
Citizen Participation & Voice: There is a very clear signal that clients crave greater citizen 
participation for more effective development and productive reform. Even where there is a 
perceived failure of WBG programs locally, half the number of respondents attributed this to 
inadequate citizen participation. They also link this to the issue of shared prosperity. In terms 
of a solution, a quarter of the respondents suggested wider outreach as the most effective way 
for the WBG to add value. There is direct reference to private sector and civil society. 
Operations: Ratings on the WBG’s relevance, alignment to local development priorities and 
realism of expectations have all increased significantly since FY10. Relative to other 
development organizations in the region the WBG is also seen as most effective. The quality 
of staff and mutual organizational relationships also received very positive ratings.  Leading 
the commendations were the interventions in public sector governance and reform. On the 
down side, the quality of the WBG’s   work in some high priority areas declined over FY 10. 
This includes education, crime and violence and jobs. 
 Instruments & Knowledge:  Respondents regarded the WBG’s technical assistance to be as 
valuable as its financial support with a majority (55 percent) naming it as the WBG’s most 
effective instrument. Nearly a third of respondents felt that WBG financing should be more 
competitive while more than 25 percent wanted the process of obtaining finance to be less 
complex. While the knowledge services of the WBG are highly rated and 64 percent of 
respondents indicated the web site as the preferred source, there is a solid 50 percent that 
expressed an affinity for publications and other written materials. (They were allowed 2 
responses).  The shift to electronic platforms will therefore have to be managed carefully.
