EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

i. 
This World Bank Group (WBG) Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for the 
Democratic Republic of São Tomé and Príncipe (STP), covering the period FY14 to 
FY18, is designed to support implementation of STP’s Second Poverty Reduction 
Strategy Paper (PRSP II). It builds on the most recent Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), 
which was extended into FY12 through an Interim Strategy Note (ISN) to allow the 
Government to finalize the new PRSP. PRSP II is designed to reduce poverty in STP by 
creating the conditions needed for growth and job creation. Growth prospects have recently 
been affected by the fact that oil production is not likely to commence as expected in 2015. 

ii. 
With per capita Gross National Income (Atlas method, 2012) of about US$1,310, 
but a small population of about 190,000, STP is one of the smallest economies in Africa. 
It covers 1,000 square kilometers in the Gulf of Guinea. A lower middle- income country, it 
is vulnerable to shocks due to a narrow export base, climate change, and environmental 
degradation. A recent seminar in STP on lessons from other small island economies 
underscored 
the 
importance of maintaining macroeconomic 
stability, 
fostering 
competitiveness and diversity, and the role of parliament in forming consensus on the design 
and implementation of critical reform programs to facilitate private sector-led growth.  

iii. 
Although STP is largely peaceful and has been free of political violence since the 
first multiparty elections in 1991, internal political wrangling has led to repeated 
changes in government. The previous minority government was replaced by an all-
opposition government in late 2012 following a vote of no-confidence, and the political 
situation remains fragile. National elections are not expected until August 2014. 

iv. 
For the past decade the country’s GDP growth has been averaging 5.7 percent. 
STP maintained macroeconomic stability despite a series of shocks. Per capita income has 
increased steadily, driven by rising world prices for cocoa, bonus payments for petroleum 
exploration, and foreign direct investments (FDI) in tourism. Although STP has made major 
advances in human development outcomes in health and education, it appears from current 
trends that STP will probably not meet all the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), 
particularly those related to gender, and sanitation. However, it has made notable progress in 
improving the investment climate and the business environment. 

v. 
Unfortunately, robust GDP growth has not significantly reduced poverty. The 
national poverty rate declined from 66.8 percent in 2000 to 61.7 percent in 2010. There are 
differences by region, gender, and the educational attainments of household heads. For 
instance, analysis has identified limited opportunities in urban areas and gains in agricultural 
productivity as possible reasons for a relatively higher urban poverty rate and underscores the 
importance of job creation, particularly for unemployed youth, and addressing skills 
mismatches. 

vi. 
The CPS is directed to the twin goals of poverty reduction and shared prosperity 
by strengthening the conditions for job creation. The intent is to create an environment 
that encourages increased private sector initiative and investment, including FDI, in key 
sectors of tourism (already growing and with excellent potential based on STP’s biodiversity 
and scenic, cultural, and historical assets); fisheries and agribusiness  (especially cocoa, by 

v 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
addressing the investment climate. credit constraints, and land policy); and potentially also 
non-tourism services.1 The strategy is to respond to STP’s current priorities through targeted 
activities and policy reforms to unblock the various constraints with a view to prepare the 
groundwork for increased external earnings while further improving the stability of the 
macroeconomy and moving towards a more coordinated and transformational program. The 
proposed WBG program is nestled within and complementary to the full matrix of donor 
support. The CPS has two broad themes: (a) supporting macroeconomic stability and 
national competitiveness, and (b) reducing vulnerability and strengthening human capacity. 
Gender, partnership, and capacity- building are elements that cut across all the proposed 
engagements. Under these themes, WBG engagement and policy dialogue will support the 
Government to improve areas such as public finance and natural resource management, 
private sector capacity (including tourism and SMEs), business climate and trade regulations, 
jobs, primary education and skills development, and addressing climate change concerns. 
WBG will partner with STP to respond to the needs of the vulnerable and poorest of its 
citizens by providing temporary public works, training, and better targeted social protection. 
The objective is to ensure that by the end of the CPS period STP has progressed significantly 
in preparing the groundwork to increase external non-oil earnings and has built upon its 
strengths and recent gains to harness opportunities for the transformation of the economy. 

vii. 
The expected financial envelope for the FY14–FY18 strategy period will include 
an IDA16/17 allocation equivalent of about US$20 million (excluding new regional IDA 
activities).2 Given the limited size of IDA funding, selectivity and complementarity will be 
required: the WBG will engage in areas where it has comparative advantage and can provide 
support in coordination with other development partners (DPs). IDA resources will be 
complemented by new resources from DPs, trust funds (TFs), and possible IFC investments 
and MIGA guarantees. Since recent assessments have validated the effectiveness of 
Development Policy Operations (DPO) at this stage of STP’s development, this CPS 
continues the DPO series. Specific investments are envisaged to improve the quality of 
primary education, address vulnerability to climate change, and enhance job creation by 
promoting the private sector, with a focus on tourism and agribusiness. These activities will 
be supported by analytical and advisory activities (AAA), technical assistance (TA), and TFs. 

viii. The CPS proposes measures to mitigate the numerous risks to the WBG 
strategy. The main 
risks are political uncertainty, 
inadequate 
institutional and 
implementation capacity, possible macroeconomic instability and external shocks, a weak 
nexus between growth and poverty reduction, and issues of economic governance.

1 For instance, STP can in the long-term build the platform to exploit information and communication 
technology (ICT) potential by developing appropriate skills, and addressing land and promotion policies. 
2 IDA allocations for the years beyond FY14 are indicative. Actual allocations may vary depending on: (i) 
the terms of IDA assistance (grants/credits) and the allocation deductions associated with MDRI annual 
total IDA resources available, (ii) the country’s performance rating, GNI per capita, and population; (iii) 
debt service foregone; (iv) the performance, other allocation parameters, and IDA assistance terms for other 
IDA borrowers; and (v) the number of IDA-eligible countries. Also, IDA allocations are provided in SDR 
(applicable for IDA16) for FY14 and US$1.50718/SDR (applicable for the remaining years). The exchange 
terms, while the US dollar equivalent amount is provided at the exchange rate of US$1.50233/SDR 
rate for each operation depends on the applicable prevailing rate at the time of approval.

FY14-FY18 COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY FOR THE 
DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF SÃO TOMÉ AND PRÍNCIPE 

I. 

INTRODUCTION 

1. 
Covering the period from FY14 to FY18, this World Bank Group (WBG) 
Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for the Democratic Republic of São Tomé and 
Príncipe (STP) is timed to support the implementation of STP’s Second Poverty 
Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP II). The Cabinet approved PRSP II (2012–16) in July 
2012, and the IDA-IMF Joint Staff Advisory Note (JSAN) on the strategy was submitted 
to the two boards on March 18, 2013. PRSP II targets priority areas to create and ensure 
the conditions essential for growth and job creation—and thus poverty reduction—before 
the start of oil production. Since it is now not clear when oil production will begin, PRSP 
II 
incorporates 
two macroeconomic scenarios: a baseline with oil production 
commencing in 2015, and an alternate where oil production does not materialize during 
the period covered by PRSP II. 

2. 
STP is a small and fragile island state. A lower-middle-income country—an 
archipelago of just over 1,000 square kilometers in the Gulf of Guinea—STP is one of the 
smallest economies in Africa. It has just over 190,000 inhabitants and per capita gross 
national income (GNI) of about US$1,310 (2012, Atlas method, current US$). 3 During 
2000–10, STP experienced average growth of 5.7 percent. Meanwhile, however, the 
absolute national poverty rate declined only from 66.8 to 61.7 percent. Limited job 
opportunities and high urban unemployment, particularly among youth, are among the 
root causes why poverty is stagnant. Furthermore, the economy has a narrow export base 
and is highly dependent on external support. It also has a small internal market, faces 
environmental degradation, and frequent turnover in government.  

3. 
To achieve its poverty reduction goals, STP can build on significant recent 
achievements:  
• With a more stable macroeconomic framework—inflation has fallen, domestic 
primary deficit targets have been met, and its international reserves are comfortable 
— STP, with the support of its DPs, essentially is ready to harness its natural-resource 
potential to achieve sustained, broad-based growth, and to avoid the “resource curse.”  
• 
Income distribution is equitable and the Gini coefficient is relatively low. 4  
• The country has significantly improved its Doing Business ranking and tops the list of 
global reformers of business regulation. 5 
Its human development outcomes are promising. For example, its ranking on the 
UNDP Human Development Index (HDI) is higher than the sub-Saharan African 
average, the literacy rate is 90 percent, and health and education indicators are good 
though there are issues regarding the quality of services. 

•

• STP has enhanced transparency in the use of public resources, with higher Public 
Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) scores, and is now a candidate for 
membership in the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI).  

4. 
Now that natural resource prospects for the near future have receded, 
identifying an alternate development dynamic has become urgent. 6 STP is too small 
in area and population to sustain significant internally generated growth. The issue facing 
STP and its DPs now is to ensure that, without immediate oil revenues, alternative 
sources of near-term external earnings for growth and poverty reduction are harnessed so 
as not to squander the gains of the past few years and to move to a higher growth trend-
line. Fiscal consolidation will be necessary to maintain macroeconomic stability in light 
of the oil revenue shortfall. Reforms to improve financial management (including reforms 
to increase tax revenue and improve the targeting of public expenditures) will be critical 
to create fiscal space to finance priority pro-poor spending. STP’s achievements in 
improving competitiveness and the business environment to promote diversification will 
need to be consolidated and continued; the agenda ahead is still sizeable. Public policies 
and action to address the needs and create opportunities for the vulnerable and 
disadvantaged are PRSP II priorities that will need to be moved forward. Environmental 
concerns also require constant attention. These messages were also relayed during a 
seminar on the experience of other successful small island economies (Box 1). 

Box 1: Small Island Economies: South-South Sharing of Experiences 
The leadership in STP has been seeking out lessons and good practices from other small island economies 
that have successfully managed growth and economic diversification while stressing transparency and 
accountability in resource management. A seminar held in STP in September 2013 on “Growth and 
Economic Diversification: Comparative Experiences of Small Island States”, organized by the Government 
in collaboration with the World Bank, was designed to provide the Government with examples of good 
practices to foster the country’s social and economic development, particularly its efforts to promote 
economic diversification, growth, job creation, and poverty reduction. Participants included STP 
government officials and policy makers, the private sector, WBG and IMF officials, development partners, 
and individuals representing small countries with characteristics similar as STP, such as the former Prime-
Minister and Minister of Finance of Barbados, and the Seychelles Minister of Finance.  

The seminar was conceived as South-South sharing of experiences related to macroeconomic resilience and 
economic governance, the potential role of the tourism sector in spurring growth, the role of parliament in 
setting and implementing the reform agenda, and measures to spur private sector growth and 
competitiveness. Particular attention was given to the role of services, financial services, niches for 
agriculture and fisheries, and economic governance of a small oil-producing country.  

Among recommendations relevant for STP were an emphasis on the importance of sound macroeconomic 
fundamentals to achieve sustainable growth; the critical role of structural and cross-cutting reforms to 
promote private sector growth and competitiveness generally; and the large potential of the service sector, 
particularly tourism, to accelerate sustainable and inclusive growth. Undertaking reforms requires, 
however, a shared consensus across economic, social and political actors. For example, in Barbados and 
Seychelles, consensus among the public and private sectors and the trade unions (with regular consultations 
their economic successes. (See Annex 2 for further details.) 
and protocols signed by each party) set the agenda for tax reforms. The role of parliament has been vital in 
6 In September 2013, the French oil company Total announced it had decided to leave the first oil block of 
the Joint Development Zone (JDZ), claiming that the quantity of oil is not commercially viable. Oil 
production is thus not likely to start in 2015 as expected.

5. 
A number of drivers of growth and job creation can accelerate progress 
towards poverty reduction and greater shared prosperity. Regardless of the timing of 
oil production, inclusive growth can be achieved by building upon present potential in 
tourism and related services, and agriculture (including cocoa, fisheries, and 
agribusiness) as well as hydropower. In the longer-term, STP can take advantage of the 
country’s strengths (e.g., high literacy rate, improved internet and regional connectivity) 
to expand in areas such as ICT and related areas. Despite their potential, these strengths 
also have some limitations that need to be addressed while STP responds to the 
vulnerable and poorest of its citizens by providing temporary public works, training, and 
better targeted social protection.  

• Tourism is now the primary source of foreign exchange, having replaced cocoa. 
It represents about 5 percent of GDP and over 40 percent of total export earnings. 
The sector also has considerable potential to generate income and employment 
through backward linkages to the local economy. STP has several major strengths 
for tourism development (See Box 2). Given its natural and cultural assets, STP 
can become a preferred tourism destination in the west and central Africa and 
beyond in Europe. However, the cumbersome visa approval process needs 
simplification, and an open skies policy and better airport facilities 7 would expand 
STP’s currently minimal connectivity. Appropriate skills in demand are also 
scarce. Given tourism’s untapped potential, a speedy adoption of the medium-term 
tourism development strategy that will prioritize public and private investment and 
attract FDI, will be important for STP. A sound marketing plan and work force 
training are therefore needed to build up the sector.  

Box 2: STP's Tourism Potential 
Tourism can serve as the key engine of growth for STP. Unlike many of its neighbors, STP remains 
peaceful with untapped natural resources and cultural assets. STP’s cultural heritage includes remains of 
the colonial Portuguese architecture in the capital city of São Tome, the plantations – roças - on both 
islands with their own rail network, and its history; while its natural endowment includes small nested 
beaches and several eco-systems including rainforests that host one of the most bio diverse areas in the 
world (from large sea turtles and fish, to birdlife and butterflies, as well as orchids and other endemic 
flowers and plants).  One can also find pristine lakes and waterfalls, various types of vegetation and 
animals, making STP ideal as an adventure and trekking destination. STP can easily be branded as an 
“ecotourism” destination—indeed, the limited advertising it has engaged in already uses biodiversity as its 
theme. The geographic location of the island at the “center of the world” has also been used as part of the 
marketing of the destination. Tourism packages that combine: sun and sea, cultural heritage and history, 
biodiversity and science, and sports and adventure may be the winning formula for tourism development.  

7 Frequency of weekly flights from Europe to STP is planned to increase from just once to three times 
beginning in July 2014, and airport facilities are being upgraded with support from Angola. However, the 
new weekly flights will last longer and will transit via Ghana. Ghana and STP however do not share a 
bilateral air transit agreement. Similarly STP does not have commercial agreements with countries that 
possess regional and international hubs; namely, South Africa, Kenya, and Spain.

• Agriculture and fisheries can benefit from recent economic growth and reforms. 
Though the primary sector has declined in importance, it still accounts for about 20 
percent of GDP and a large share of household income. Cocoa’s productivity 
remains low and its production fell with the collapse of the large plantations 
(roças) and lack of support to smallholders, even though at the turn of the 20th 
century, the majority of global cocoa production originated from STP. Cocoa and 
emerging crops such as coffee and palm oil are cash crops with a ready 
international market. A quick way to revive production is by supporting 
cooperatives and attracting agribusiness operators and traders to stimulate 
production and processing focusing on higher-end niches (e.g., high quality and 
organic production). This will gradually boost employment and incomes for the 
population, which would address both poverty and shared prosperity issues. But 
again there is little access to credit or FDI, land rights are unclear and land plots 
dispersed, marketing and branding are not coordinated, and little value is added 
locally. 8 Nevertheless, the tourism-related development of roças, through their 
privatization and less rigid land ownership approach, may gradually re-launch 
niche agricultural production at these plantations. WBG’s proposed approach is to 
start an engagement in the sector given its importance for growth, employment, 
and relevance for the poorest. As an entry point, the WBG proposes to initiate 
sectoral AAA to update the knowledge base. Policy aspects in agriculture may also 
be explored (e.g., land) to help advance the dialogue. Progress in these initiatives 
will be assessed around the CPS midpoint (CPSPR) and consideration will be 
given to ramping up engagement in the sector based on the preliminary findings. 

6. 
The WBG strategy supports 
the Government’s response 
to 
these 
opportunities and challenges by its alignment with PRSP II objectives and its 
coordination with other DPs. The strategy will help create an environment that 
encourages private sector initiative and investment, including FDI, through both targeted 
activities and policy reforms. Because the IDA envelope is limited, selectivity and 
complementarity are necessary. The WBG will engage in areas where it has comparative 
advantage and can coordinate with other DPs. Better donor coordination, at a meaningful 
level of detail and specificity to close gaps and eliminate overlaps, is paramount. The 
UNDP-led exercise in preparing the donor support matrix is the focal point, and the CPS 
is positioned to be an integral part of donor- coordinated support to STP. The strategy is 
responsive to current priorities and the need to prepare the groundwork to generate 
external earnings while building on the macro-economic and structural gains, leading 
ultimately to economic transformation. 

7. 
The CPS proposes engagements to strengthen STP’s competitiveness and the 
business environment within a stable macroeconomic framework, and to promote 
its ability to deliver better services by enhancing human capacity and skills 
development while reducing vulnerabilities. Thus the CPS thematic focus is to support 
STP to (i) maintain macroeconomic stability and improve competitiveness, and (ii) 
reduce vulnerability and build up human capacity. A program of activities supported by

IDA and TFs, with focused AAA to underpin the engagements proposed, will accompany 
the policy dialogue. IFC and MIGA will be close partners in supporting reforms and 
generating deals. Given the small size of STP, even a few of the right type of transactions 
can have a transformational impact on growth, jobs creation, and regional connectivity.  

II. COUNTRY CONTEXT AND DEVELOPMENT AGENDA 

A. Political Context 

8. 
Although STP has been largely free of conflict and political violence since its first 
multiparty elections in 1991, internal political wrangling has caused repeated changes in 
government. Following a political confrontation in December 2012 and a no-confidence 
vote, the minority government led by Prime Minister Patrice Trovoada was replaced by 
an all-opposition government headed by Prime Minister Gabriel da Costa. Although this 
new government holds a narrow majority with 29 of the 55 seats in Parliament, the 
cohesiveness of the coalition is untested; an unsuccessful vote of no-confidence in July 
2013 is testimony to this fragility. Though national legislative elections are not expected 
until August 2014, 9 the political situation remains delicate. The new government’s 
parliamentary backing is fragmented, leading to the possibility of an early election should 
members of the current governing coalition fall out. The fragmented political scene is 
likely to make policy implementation and legislative action difficult, although the policy 
environment has been stable despite the many government changes in the past decade. 

B. Social Context 

9. 
STP’s human development outcomes have significantly improved. It ranks 
144th out of 186 countries in the HDI—higher than the sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) 
average—and its indicators are improving consistently. The country continues to make 
progress in expanding access to education and health services. Its health outcomes are 
good: life expectancy is 66 years, and mortality and morbidity rates are far below the 
SSA averages (see table 1). An increase in the proportion of births attended by skilled 
birth attendants has brought about a steep decline in maternal and child mortality; the 
incidence of malaria has fallen from 1,273 10 (2004) to 62 (2012) per 1,000 children under 
5, and HIV/AIDS prevalence is less than 1.5 percent. STP has also made good progress in 
education, especially at the primary level, and at about 89 percent literacy is high (2010). 
Secondary education has not yet achieved universal coverage, however; supply is limited 
to the main urban areas.  

10. 
STP is not likely to meet all the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). 
Progress has been made in some of the key human development indicators (e.g., primary 
education, albeit with quality issues; maternal and child mortality rates; halting the spread 
of HIV/AIDS; access to safe water). However, significant strides are still necessary in the 
areas of gender, partnering for development (see Annex A2), and sanitation. Appropriate

sanitation facilities are lacking in STP for large parts of the communities in rural and sub-
urban areas 11. 

11. 
The STP constitution and subsequent laws emphasize gender equality. The 
2004 Country Gender Assessment noted a dichotomy between official gender equality 
laws and policies and actual gender-associated socioeconomic status. Although women 
are well-represented at the highest political level, at lower levels their influence on 
political decision-making is limited. Women’s labor force participation is also lower than 
that of men and their unemployment rate higher (see Annex 3: Poverty Profile, which has 
gender-specific data on most indicators). In 2010, of all those older than 15, 84.7 percent 
of women were literate compared to 93.9 percent of men; yet for those aged 15–24, the 
95.9 percent literacy rate of women overtook that of men (94.7 percent)(WDI).

C. Economic Development  

Recent Economic Developments 

12. Growth rates for STP have been high in recent years. In the past decade real 
GDP growth averaged 5.7 percent, compared to just 1.4 percent for the 1990s. Propelled 
by rising world cocoa prices, bonus payments for petroleum exploration, and FDI in 
tourism, 12 growth led to a sustained increase in per capita income for the first time since 
independence. 

13. When in the first nine years of this century fiscal expansion led to double-
digit inflation and a steep depreciation of the dobra, 13 in 2010 the Authorities 

11 DPs such as the European Community, Brazil, and the United Nations are supporting water and 
sanitation projects.

pegged the exchange rate to the euro. Together with falling food and fuel prices the peg 
brought inflation down dramatically, from 32 percent in 2008 to 10.6 percent in 2012. 
International reserves, estimated at US$53.4 million in 2013, represent more than 4.5 
months of non-factor imports, well above the IMF program floor of 3 months. 14  

14. 
STP is on a fiscal consolidation path. As a result of the exchange rate peg, fiscal 
policy has been the main tool for maintaining macroeconomic stability. The country has 
reduced nonessential current expenditures, contained the nominal growth of the wage 
bill, and reduced arrears between the Treasury and parastatals. 

15. 
STP is continuously improving the transparency of its management of public 
resources. In the 2012 Open Budget Index, the STP rank jumped from 94th (the bottom 
position) to 62nd, and it was recognized as one of the top reformers in the world in budget 
transparency. Also, in 2013 STP for the first time prepared a Citizens’ Budget for 
transparent public discussion of the allocation of resources. Although STP still gives 
minimal information to the public in its budget documents, continued reforms are 
expected to further improve the transparency of and accountability for public resources. 

16. 
These efforts have helped STP to maintain macroeconomic stability despite a 
series of shocks. STP’s growth in 2013 is estimated around 4 percent amid the persistent 
economic slowdown among key European partners. Beginning in 2012, STP has been 
experiencing a deceleration of growth, down from 4.9 percent in 2011, because of lower-
than-expected official transfers financing capital expenditures and FDI. Nevertheless, 
fiscal consolidation efforts helped STP to maintain a domestic primary deficit of 3.1 
percent in 2013, in line with the IMF Extended Credit Facility (ECF) target. (Table 2) 

17. 
Yet STP is still highly vulnerable because of its narrow export base. The 
current account deficit excluding official transfers is projected at 34.1 percent of GDP in 
2013. Current account deficits have been covered by private capital inflows and donor 
support. Official net overseas remittances have increased, but still only account for 3 
percent of GDP. After reaching 25 percent of GDP in 2010, FDI has continuously 
declined reaching 8.4 percent of GDP in 2012. 

18. 
Behind-the-border barriers have limited STP’s trade competitiveness. Given 
the fixed exchange rate, the inflation differential with the euro zone resulted in a real 
exchange rate appreciation that negatively affected exports. However, constraints on 
competitiveness are mainly rooted in microeconomic issues. The Diagnostic Trade 
Integration Study (DTIS) Update, while hailing the government efforts in setting up a 
single window for foreign trade transactions, streamlining bureaucracy and creating a 
single point of contact for the entrepreneurs, suggests strengthening transparency and 
reducing costs, removing infrastructure bottlenecks, improving the technical skills of the 
labor force, and strengthening regional integration.

19. 
STP relies heavily on external donor assistance for both recurrent and 
capital expenditures (Table 2). More than 90 percent of the public investment program 
is supported by donors and most pro-poor recurrent expenditures are financed by Official 
Development Assistance (ODA). Sector-wide approaches and direct budget support are 
seldom used, and donor-financed projects often bypass government institutions entirely. 
This undermines fiscal sustainability as recurrent expenditures on donor projects are not 
adequately accounted in budget documents. 15 

20. 
Despite positive results from the Government’s fiscal consolidation reforms 
and recent progress in reforming state-owned enterprises (SOEs), the SOEs are still 
characterized by poor service and weak financial performance. Their shaky financial 
position, particularly that of the national electricity and water utility (EMAE), has 
generated contingent liabilities and necessitated transfers from the Government that 
undermine its own fiscal position. Arrears between EMAE and the now partially 
privatized national oil importer, ENCO, have not yet been settled. In addition to these 
arrears, ENCO is claiming additional payments from the Government to cover losses 
arising from government restrictions on the prices ENCO is allowed to charge. 16  

Economic Prospects  

21. 
Though near-term STP’s economic outlook is clouded, the longer-term 
outlook is positive. In 2014 growth is expected to accelerate, mainly driven by 
investments in construction to support tourism, agriculture, and fisheries. Large private 
investments include requalification of the airport in Príncipe and oil palm projects. 
Donors will continue to finance most public capital spending. 

22. Growth prospects have been undermined by the fact that oil production is no 
longer expected to start in 2015. GDP growth had been expected to jump to about 38 
percent in 2015, but in September 2013, Total, the French oil company, announced its 
decision to leave the first oil block of the Joint Development Zone (JDZ), 17 citing 
findings that exploration based on the given oil quantity is not commercially viable. In its 
first public response, the Ministry of Infrastructure and Energy declared that enough oil is 
available and that medium-size enterprises are currently evaluating the possibility of 
replacing Total. The shortfall in expected government revenue will necessitate fiscal 
adjustments to control debt and will likely affect foreign investment, which had been 
based on expectations for the development of the oil sector. 

15 In July 2013, the Government held a second donor meeting and presented the draft Priority Action Plan 
(PAP) to support the policy areas identified in the PRSP II and the related PAP. Donor meetings are now 
held on a quarterly basis to exchange information about ongoing and planned projects.  
16 ENCO is not allowed to sell petroleum products at “real” prices, since their retail prices, which are set by 
the Government, do not include import costs, taxes, and distribution margins. The Government sets ad hoc 
official retail prices for petroleum products, and there is no system to automatically adjust them to 
international prices. Hence, retail prices are often below the real prices. 
17 In 2001, STP and Nigeria signed the Joint Petroleum Exploration Treaty to manage the joint exploration 
of potential oil resources in the JDZ.

23. 
Reserves are expected to be sufficient to keep the peg credible and keep 
inflation on a downward path. International reserves are projected to remain well above 
the standard metric of three months of imports during 2014. The credibility of the peg has 
been enhanced by a €25 million credit line from Portugal 18 and access to the US$9.9 
million deposit to the National Oil Account (NOA). Inflation is estimated to have been 
8.2 percent in 2013 and projected to fall to about 7 percent in 2014 due to an increase in 
agricultural production and stable international food prices. 

24. 
The Government is committed to accelerate fiscal consolidation in order to 
maintain macroeconomic stability. In recent years STP was able to finance sizable 
domestic primary fiscal deficits from oil-signature bonuses and privatization receipts. 
However, with the privatization account depleted, the Government is likely to have few 
options for domestic financing in 2014–15. The Authorities will concentrate on the fiscal 
adjustment agenda, with continued efforts to raise domestic revenues. They plan to 
broaden the tax base (adding an estimated 3,000 taxpayers by year-end 2014) and better 
manage tax collections (using the ASYCUDA World system to make customs collection 
more efficient). The Authorities, as part of the IMF ECF program, plan to strengthen tax 
administration and with support of the AfDB to set in place a strategy to optimize tax 
revenues. The Government plans to achieve a domestic primary fiscal deficit of 3 percent 
of GDP by 2014 and then gradually reduce it to 2 percent by 2017. 

25. 
The Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA 2013) notes that STP is at high risk of 
debt distress over the medium term, and debt sustainability will require fiscal 
adjustment and borrowing on highly concessional terms. Reaching a debt profile that 
is consistent with manageable (though high-risk) debt dynamics would require the 
additional fiscal adjustment of 1 percent of GDP over 2015–17 as projected; continued 
heavy reliance on grants and highly concessional lending; and intensified efforts over the 
medium term to diversify the economy and expand the export base.  The DSA also 
recommended fiscal prudence, particularly in the run-up to the 2014 elections.  Debt 
service indicators are particularly sensitive to changes in the terms of public borrowing, 
suggesting that STP is highly exposed to changes in loan concessionality, and needs to 
seek out only highly concessional financing.   STP is subject to IDA’s non-concessional 
borrowing policy (NCBP) which requires that the country adopts a prudent external 
borrowing policy reliant on grants and highly concessional loans. STP’s medium- and 
long-term public and publicly guaranteed external debt was estimated at US$221.6 
million (84 percent of GDP) as of December 2012. The debt burden increased from 
US$200.1 million at end-2011 (due to disbursements from Portugal and Nigeria) yet 
remains significantly below the pre-debt relief high of US$359.5 million at end-2006. 
The share of multilateral debt declined from nearly 60 percent before the HIPC 
completion point to 20 percent. Portugal is now the country’s main bilateral creditor, and 
IDA is its main multilateral creditor, although since FY2008, STP’s IDA financing has 
been provided on 100% grant terms in response to STP’s high risk of debt distress. In 
March 2014, however, the authorities signed an agreement with Angola for a loan

amounting to US$40 million to be spent during 2014-2015, which does not meet the 
minimum concessionality element of 50 percent agreed upon under the IMF program and 
required by the NCBP. A new joint WB-IMF DSA is under preparation and is expected 
to be completed by the end of May 2014. The DSA will analyze the impact of this loan 
on debt sustainability indicators. In the meantime, the Bank is deepening its policy 
dialogue with the authorities on this issue, and will assess the borrowing in the context of 
the NCBP. 

Poverty Profile 19  

26. 
STP’s robust GDP growth in recent years has not translated into high level 
of poverty reduction. Indeed, between 2001 and 2010, the growth elasticity of poverty 
(with respect to growth in per capita income) was about 0.5, meaning that for each 1 
percent increase in per capita income, poverty decreased only by 0.5 percent. 20 

27. 
There are also disparities in poverty between regions. The Center region, 
which is predominantly rural, has the lowest poverty rate (57.3 percent), though even 
there rates 21 in urban areas are higher (Figures 1 and 2), with the capital, Água Grande, at 
62 percent. In the poorest southern regions, where many coastal fishing villages are 
located, 74 percent of the population is poor. Finally, the poverty rate on the island of 
Príncipe, very isolated as well as mostly rural, is a high 69 percent. The Center region 
experienced a major fall in poverty (about 7 percentage points) between 2000 and 2010. 
Poverty rates in southern STP are almost invariant. 

28. 
Though still relatively low, STP’s income inequality has increased between 
2000 and 2010, particularly in urban areas. This partly explains the small gains in 
poverty reduction despite an increase in GDP per capita. Despite this increase, STP 
remains among the countries with the most equal income distribution in SSA. The Gini 
index in 2010 was 33.6, well below the median Gini index for SSA (42.7) 22, with urban 
areas recording a Gini index of 34.3 compared to 32.7 in rural areas, and with a faster 
increase in urban areas.  

29. 
Poverty reduction has been larger for households whose head is more 
educated. In 2010, the poverty rate was 73.8 percent when the head of household had no 
formal education, 66 percent when the head had some primary education, 55.1 when the 
head had finished secondary school, and 31.9 percent when the head had tertiary 
education. The poverty rate did not change between 2000 and 2010 when the head of the 
household had no education, but rates went down 9.1 percent for households whose heads   
had primary education and 10.1 percent for those whose heads had tertiary education. 

19 This section draws on the forthcoming World Bank São Tomé and Príncipe Poverty Assessment. 
20 Data for GDP per capita start in 2001 (WDI database). Poverty rates are based on the STP 2000 and 2010 
Household Surveys. To ensure consistency, the change in poverty rate between 2001 and 2010 is

30. 
Female-headed households are poorer, and their poverty rate was reduced less 
than for male-headed households. This probably relates to differences in education: 67 
percent of female heads of household have no formal education versus 33 percent for 
male heads. The poverty rate for female-headed households fell from 71.4 percent in 
2000 to 67 percent in 2010, compared to a drop from 64.7 percent to 58.6 percent for 
male-headed households.  

31. 
Few job opportunities may explain why the poverty rate has stagnated in 
urban areas. Urban poverty rates are mainly driven by the labor market of the capital, 
Água Grande, which accounts for 72.4 percent (2010) of the total urban population. 
According to preliminary census findings, the population of Água Grande increased by 
41 percent between 2001 and 2012. Concurrently there were increases in labor market 
participation (the inactive rate went down 15 percent) and in the unemployment rate (by 7 
percentage points). One reason for the increase in active workers is the emergence of a 
tertiary sector, with hotels, banks, and supermarkets. This has generated new economic 
interactions but is unable to integrate all new workers entering the labor market due to 
problems of both supply (skills mismatch, given a low-skilled labor force) and demand 
(small and weak firms) issues.  

32. 
Productivity gains in agriculture might explain the lower poverty rate in the 
center of the country. The center has benefitted from DP programs to support creation 
of cocoa farmers’ and fishermen’s cooperatives, which have pushed up agricultural 
productivity. These programs began in the mid-1990s with PNAPAF (the National 
Support to Smallholders Program) and continued with PAPAFPA (the Participatory 
Smallholder Agriculture and Artisanal Fisheries Development Project). They offer advice 
on microcredit, extension services, and diversification, and build rural infrastructure. In 
the south-west, by contrast, the agriculture sector, though crucial, is poorly developed and 
infrastructure is lacking, which makes the region highly vulnerable to price variations and 
a deeply inadequate basic food supply.

D. Development Challenges and Opportunities  

• 

33. 
As noted, STP has considerable opportunities to reduce poverty and foster 
shared growth, especially through tourism, niche agriculture, and fisheries. There is also 
hydropower potential and new oil production potential (although viability is not certain). 
• Despite frequent changes in government, STP has been relatively peaceful. This 
bodes well for accelerating poverty reduction and shared growth, since conflict 
retards development. 23 
• Access to education and health services has greatly improved. The 2011 CEM 
indicates that education was a major driver of economic growth in STP. Thus, 
productive sectors can draw more easily on well-developed human resources. 
The country has impressively improved its business climate. It was acknowledged 
as one of the 10 top reformers in the 2012 Doing Business Report (it shot up in 
ranking from 180 out of 183 countries to 160 out of 185 countries), 24 and that 
same year the Heritage Foundation’s Index of Economic Freedom named it the 
top global reformer of business regulations (for instance, in 2011 STP increased 
registered businesses by about 35 percent.) 25 IFC and the Bank have supported an 
initiative to simplify customs clearance procedures. 26 STP has also advanced 
licensing reforms (also with support from IFC and the Bank) and instituted an e-
visa system to encourage tourism. Since the country became a member of the 
Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) in December 2012, potential 
investors can now tap opportunities to insure against political risk. It is expected 
that MIGA will seek out opportunities to work with the WBG team. 27 
• Governance and transparency in the management of public resources are 
continuously improving. STP is currently ranked 72nd out of 176 countries on the 
Transparency International Corruption Perception Index, up from 111th in 2009.28 
There has been an increased public participation in the budget process and in the 
transparency and comprehensiveness of the budget documents. Public financial 
management (PFM) is more professional and recent laws will make it more 
effective. STP has adopted an oil revenue management law (ORML) to establish 
the basis for good management of oil-related institutions and has become a 
candidate for EITI membership. But, as noted below, challenges remain. 
STP is more active in regional cooperation initiatives, as is critical given its 
limited economies of scale and its insularity. It is a member of the Economic 
Community of Central African States (ECCAS) and the Community of 

•

enthusiasm, reflecting perhaps government complacency or a lack of support to implement policy reforms; 
STP’s drop by three places in the 2013 Doing Business Index illustrates this loss of momentum. (EIU

Portuguese Speaking Countries. Angola has extended STP a line of credit and the 
two countries have signed a partnership agreement to improve port and airport 
infrastructure. Brazil is cooperating with STP on a technical training center, and 
STP has a fisheries agreement with the European Union (EU). All these activities 
should help STP to integrate more closely with neighboring countries for trade 
and other forms of economic cooperation. 

34. 
Yet if it is to significantly reduce poverty, the country needs to tackle major 
challenges. Since its recent robust GDP growth has not had much impact on poverty, 
STP needs to put into action a game-changing strategy to meet the ambitious PRSP II 
goal of reducing poverty by another 10 percent by 2016.  
• Unemployment and skills development: The unemployment rate grew from 12 to 14 
percent between 2000 and 2010, and even more in urban areas. Of the working age 
population, 58.3 percent are employed, 19 percent unemployed, and 22.7 percent 
inactive. 29 Though the employment rate for men is 90 percent, for women it is 81.3 
percent. Unemployment is also high among youth: about 23 percent of those aged 
15–24 are unemployed and another 29 percent are inactive. About 25 percent of the 
poor are unemployed, and another 35 percent are inactive. According to the 2011 
CEM, STP needs to create 31,000 new jobs within 10 years—a 70 percent increase 
from the current level. Skills mismatch also contributes to unemployment. 
• Macroeconomic stability: Because a stable macro-economy is a precondition for 
growth, STP needs to commit to tight fiscal discipline. Fiscal consolidation efforts 
will be crucial to provide the space needed to finance vital, especially pro-poor, 
expenditures. They include reforms to step up tax collection, revise the fuel pricing 
mechanism, clear the arrears between EMAE and ENCO, and make public spending 
more efficient—for instance, electricity subsidies are not well targeted 30  
• Governance and 
institutional capacity: Despite significant progress, debt 
management and other PFM reforms are still at an early stage. The credibility of 
budget execution is minimal. Auditing and procurement processes need to be 
tightened. Regulations still need to be drafted to fully operationalize the debt law. 
• Private sector development, competitiveness, and investment flow: Property rights, 
particularly for land, need to be clarified; small and dispersed land plots raise the 
cost of agriculture; and red tape abounds. Limited access to credit is a major 
problem and the majority of the population, especially the poor and those in 
agricultural cooperatives, lack access to financial resources; unclear property rights 
make use of collateral difficult. There is thus an urgent need to couple regulatory 
and macro reforms with catalytic interventions to build capacity, improve the 
competitiveness of the private sector, and promote access to finance in order to take 
advantage of new niche opportunities. 
• Diversification and trade integration: STP’s product concentration is very high 
even when controlling for the size of the domestic market. Tourism has replaced 
cocoa as the primary source of foreign exchange. The CEM recommends a focus on

• 

growing sectors that have the most export potential, such as tourism and related 
services. The Bank’s DTIS Update provides recommendations on high-priority 
areas identified based on STP’s main trade challenges.  
Infrastructure deficits: STP suffers from a shortage of electrification (60 percent) 
and its high cost; frequent blackouts represent economic losses of about 4 percent of 
GDP a year. PRSP-II emphasizes the need to expand the capacity of EMAE, partly 
by exploring options for alternative power generation. Also, the lack of access to 
low-cost, high-quality telecommunications services limits the potential for growth, 
although the new submarine cable, put in place with Bank support 31 and operational 
since early 2013, is expected to ease communication shortcomings and lead to 
possible growth in ICT-based services in the longer term. Finally, there is a need to 
explore sustainable development of ports in STP. 
• Service delivery and quality of human capital: Large numbers of the poor find it 
difficult to access basic services like secondary education, health care, and nutrition 
because of barriers related to both supply (lack of services) and demand (lack of 
household income) constraints. Quality of education is a major concern. Teachers 
are not well-qualified and learning time is limited by a multiple shift regime.32 
Quality indicators based on standardized tests are absent. Repetition rates at all 
levels, though they have been brought down substantially, are still high. Health 
sector issues include limited and imbalanced distribution of qualified human 
resources, a weak health information system, and low-quality local services. STP 
has a high number of fatalities associated with road traffic injuries, and the 
incidence of non-communicable diseases is increasing. 
• Social protection: The population is highly vulnerable to unpredictable shocks, such 
as food shortages and climate change. STP has some social protection programs, 
mostly in social assistance, but their coverage and effectiveness are low. Social 
insurance involves several contributory programs, including elderly pensions, 
disability, medical, and maternity and other subsidies. There is an array of small 
and underfunded social assistance interventions implemented by several agencies as 
well as nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and DPs.  
• Environmental protection: STP is naturally prone to flooding and coastal erosion. 
High rates of erosion, caused both by removal of sand for construction and by storm 
surges, threaten coastal residents, who are among the poorest communities in STP, 
the poor having traditionally settled in marginal lowland areas left vacant by old 
plantations. The vulnerability of coastal settlements is therefore increasing rapidly, 
particularly as floods and sea storms intensify and property loss worsens. High rates 
of youth unemployment have also increased pressures on natural resources, 
particularly fishing and forestry. STP’s vulnerability to climate change can only 
increase: the forecast is for temperatures to climb by an average of 2°C as 

31 The World Bank’s Regional Central African Backbone Project supported financing of the cable. 
32 Almost one-third of the primary schools (grades 1– 4) used to work on a triple-shift system, with average 
class-time of only two or three hours daily. Attrition was also high; only 47 percent of STP children reach 
6th grade. By eliminating triple shifts and constructing new classrooms, teaching time now averages 3.5 
hours per day, and survival rate from grades 1 to 6 has increased (ICR Social Support Project, Report No. 
ICR00002683). 

15  

                                                        
precipitation drops by about 15 percent; that means longer dry seasons and more 
flooding and fogs, which have contributed to an STP fishermen mortality rate that is 
triple the world average. 
• Statistical information: STP’s statistics still need further improvement (see Annex 
4). A household survey was conducted in 2010, and the Bank is supporting 
government preparation of a poverty assessment. The dearth of demographic data 
and the lack of targeted surveys, such as enterprise and labor market surveys, make 
it harder to analyze aspects of the economy and estimate the true scale of poverty. 
Better data are also needed to evaluate critical sectors, such as an agricultural 
census that will be crucial for designing policy that promotes agricultural 
investment (DTIS Update). 

III. WORLD BANK GROUP PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY 

A. Government Priorities and Medium-Term Strategy 

35. 
PRSP II identifies priority areas of intervention for 2012–16. Its goals are to 
create and ensure maintenance of conditions essential for growth and job creation, and 
thus poverty reduction. PRSP II has four pillars: (i) promoting good governance and 
public-sector reform; (ii) supporting sustainable and inclusive economic growth; (iii) 
enhancing human capital and extending basic social services; and (iv) reinforcing social 
cohesion and social protection, particularly for vulnerable groups. 33 PRSP-II prioritizes 
good governance, competitiveness and diversification, and natural resource management, 
especially transparency in the use of oil revenues and capacity in the oil sector. The 
Bank-IMF JSAN observed that the PRSP II presents a coherent analysis and offers 
appropriate policies for long-term poverty reduction and sustainable economic growth. It 
also noted that the primary poverty reduction objective – a 10 percent decrease in the 
poverty rate over the next four years–is ambitious. 

B. Proposed World Bank Group Partnership Strategy 

Lessons from the CAS Completion Report 

36. 
The CAS Completion Report (CASCR, Annex 5) discusses major lessons 
learned from WBG engagement during the last CAS and ISN period. In preparing 
the current CPS, these lessons were taken into account: 

• Broad-based macroeconomic 
support 
is key 
to ensuring 
successful 
implementation of a CPS. Bank support anchored on policy instruments and 
macroeconomic performance, such as DPOs, provided structure and mitigated 
political instability and frequent changes in government priorities. The reforms 
supported by the WBG including the ongoing DPO series are in line with PRSP-II, 
which was developed through an extensive consultative process, including

2016), March 2012.

• 

representatives of the Government, its cooperating partners, STP’s major political 
parties, civil society organizations, and other stakeholders throughout the country.  
• Close coordination between the Bank and the IFC has helped STP to make 
significant progress in making the business environment more attractive. To 
consolidate these gains, that coordination should continue. Now that STP has also 
joined MIGA, this CPS is based on a WBG program that benefits from close 
collaboration among IFC, MIGA, and IDA. 
STP might now be served better by shorter, timely, and more focused policy 
notes in critical areas, since major analytical pieces such as the CEM, Poverty 
Assessment, and DTIS Update, have already been produced. 
Support to the petroleum sector through the EITI should continue. This would 
help to ensure that efforts to build capacity are pursued and that reforms are put in 
place to allow solicitation of new contracts to explore the Exclusive Economic Zone 
(EEZ). The WBG should also support the Government to continue to build on recent 
gains in transparency and accountability in the general public sector as well as the 
petroleum sector. 
• To consolidate recent gains, the CPS should continue its engagements in the 
social sectors. The Social Sector Service Project (SSSP, US$8.6 million) has had 
encouraging results in both health and education, and further support is expected 
through the Global Partnership for Education (GPE). 
• Poor donor coordination has led to ineffective use of funds and other 
inefficiencies. After sporadic inefficient donor coordination efforts, the Government, 
with support from the UNDP, convened donors’ meetings in December 2011 and 
December 2012, and in July 2013 it presented a draft Priority Action Plan (PAP) to 
support the policy areas identified in the PRSP II. Quarterly donor meetings to 
exchange information are now planned. Since the country is highly dependent on 
donor support, the WBG should take on a greater coordinating role in its areas of 
expertise. The capacity of the Authorities to coordinate and integrate donor programs 
should be built up. 
In this spirit, the Bank should continue to promote a multi-stakeholder 
approach to harness the unique contribution of DPs to provide an interconnected 
program of knowledge, projects, and technical assistance (TA). 
• Dedicated staff in STP can move the program forward faster. Given the limited 
program and resource envelope, it is recommended that fiduciary staff representing 
financial management, procurement, and accounting within the Ministry of Planning 
serve as a Project Implementation Unit (PIU), with dedicated project staff added as 
needed, rather than separate PIU for each project.  

• 

• 

Lessons from the Client Survey 

37. 
The CPS also draws on the findings of a June 2012 client survey in which 
about 200 stakeholders were invited to give their opinions on the Bank’s assistance to 
STP. Of these, 40 percent were from ministries and implementation agencies. Among 
lessons from the survey applied in preparing this CPS were that: 

17  

 
 
• Those within government could become more familiar with the WBG. 
Knowledge of the WBG was extremely low—not surprisingly, since there is no 
WBG office in STP and the portfolio is focused on a few sectors. A question 
would be how to strengthen key relationships with government officials. 
• Energy, agricultural development, and foreign direct investment are seen as 
crucial if poverty is to be reduced effectively. 
• Other issues identified as important in the survey were whether the Bank 
supports programs that are realistic for STP; the effectiveness of Bank support; 
and concerns about Bank flexibility and timeliness. Asked what factor is most 
responsible for slowing reforms, a third of the respondents cited inadequate 
citizen participation.  

Lessons from Stakeholder Consultations 

38. 
In preparing the CPS, the WBG team met with a wide range of stakeholders, 
including civil society organizations (CSOs), the media, business associations, NGOs, 
and members of Parliament. Some CSOs, such as FoNG (an NGO umbrella group), 
provide services while others are professional associations with limited scope of action. 
Some enthusiastic youth groups could benefit from training in leadership and demand-
side governance to better impress their footprint on society, and many indicated that 
unemployment and lack of access to finance to start businesses are major problems. 
Members of Parliament consulted explicitly asked for support to set up specialized 
commissions to deal with development challenges related to, e.g., PFM, climate change, 
extractive industries, and fragility. The Bank is identifying programs that could respond 
to that request. 

Overview of the WBG Partnership Strategy 

39. 
The proposed CPS is aligned with the development vision of the Government 
as outlined in PRSP II and the twin WBG goals of poverty reduction and shared 
prosperity. The strategy proposes to partner with the Government to respond to STP’s 
current priorities through targeted activities and policy reforms to unblock the various 
constraints that hinder private sector initiatives and investment flows. This will help 
generate increased external earnings by further improving the stability of the 
macroeconomic framework; enhancing skills and reducing vulnerabilities; and moving 
towards a more coordinated and transformational program. It focuses on two broad 
themes—(i) supporting macroeconomic stability and national competitiveness; and (ii) 
reducing vulnerability and strengthening human capacity. Gender, partnership, and 
capacity building are elements cross-cutting all CPS activities. To support these themes, 
WBG engagements during the CPS period will be directed to reinforcing PFM; 
unblocking major policy constraints to investment flow; developing the right skills mix; 
brokering 
transactions 
to bring 
in 
investments and expertise; and addressing 
vulnerabilities while filling in critical knowledge gaps. The first theme recognizes the 
importance for STP of ensuring macroeconomic stability, making management of public 
and natural resources more transparent, and building up the private sector and trade 
integration. The second theme is directed to more effective social protection, delivering 

18  

 
 
 
 
better-quality services, and supporting skills development. The associated Results 
Framework identifies outcomes linked to both current and proposed WBG activities 
(Annex 1).  

40. 
The CPS is particularly attentive to both the WBG agenda on jobs (WDR 
2013) and the Africa Region’s continuing work on youth employment. These have 
helped focus the CPS on such interventions as enhancing the business environment (e.g., 
access to finance and infrastructure, increased electrification, and ICT), human capital 
(quality of education and skills development), youth employment, diversification, and as 
common for small island nations, connectivity to the global market.  

Engagement Areas and Objectives  

41. Given limited WBG resources, selectivity is crucial. The CPS proposes limited 
engagements that respond to client demands and will contribute most effectively to 
poverty reduction and shared prosperity. Expected outcomes from the proposed activities 
(as outlined in Box 3) will be achieved by leveraging Trust-Funds and partnerships, and 
by undertaking key analytics to complement the limited IDA envelop. Criteria for 
program selection are: 

• Knowledge as the foundation: The WBG will leverage the AAAs already available 
(e.g., PER, CEM, DTIS Update, Poverty Assessment with analysis of gender-
disaggregated data) to prioritize proposed interventions. Certain areas of knowledge 
work are identified, such as the tourism strategy, skills, and social protection, as 
building blocks for future interventions. The CPS proposes to undertake demand-
driven and flexible just-in-time policy advice in areas critically linked to WBG 
activities (e.g., DPO series). AAA can also serve to build knowledge in new areas 
where the WBG would like to be engaged, for instance, agriculture where AAA 
would provide the platform to advance policy issues such as land reforms.  
• Comparative advantage and readiness: Proposed interventions will be assessed 
based on WBG comparative advantage in the area, availability of WBG staff with 
relevant expertise, implementation capacity, realistic assessment of risks, and 
flexibility given capacity constraints. Since STP needs are high, staff will also call 
on trust fund (TF) and other resources to support priority activities. 
• Closer coordination and harmonization with DPs in priority areas will be vital to 
access additional resources and enhance their effectiveness. For example, while 
water and sanitation needs are significant, this CPS does not propose WBG 
engagement given the substantial engagement of the EU, Brazil, and the UN, among 
other DPs. Similarly, the health sector receives considerable support from other 
donors. In recent years, IFAD and the UN have been lead agencies in the agricultural 
sector; the WBG hopes to complement their efforts by focusing on policies and 
institutions (e.g., land policy, agribusiness support, and access to credit), and perhaps 
through IFC transactions. 
• Any proposed activity will leverage all the institutions in the WBG. For instance: 
 IFC will continue to support competitiveness/investment climate-related reforms 
in collaboration with the Poverty Reduction and Economic Management 

19  

 
 
 
(PREM) and the Financial and Private Sector Development (FPD) units. It may 
also seek to operate in transactions that facilitate development of the targeted 
tourism, and agriculture/ agribusiness sectors. 
 MIGA will explore offering political risk insurance (PRI) guarantees across a 
range of products to encourage investment, especially in tourism and possibly 
natural resources. As an IDA country, STP is a strategic priority for MIGA. 

42. 
The CPS will continue the DPO series. Currently, the WBG is the only donor 
providing budget support, and the CASCR confirmed the effectiveness of the DPOs (with 
a focus on governance and competitiveness), which have produced desirable policy 
outcomes. Continuation of the DPO series, informed by related analytical work and 
complementing a TA on improving the business climate, will be used to consolidate these 
outcomes, supplemented by specific instruments to address vulnerability, skills 
development, and private sector development (PSD)/job creation objectives. Within the 
DPO series, the possibility of engaging in the agriculture sector, for example, by looking 
at policies related to land reforms, will be explored provided there is consensus and 
ownership.  

43. 
There are significant synergies among the proposed CPS activities. For 
instance, the DPO-supported policy and institutional reforms will be complemented by 
the private sector operation, TA, AAA, and IFC/MIGA activities in order to ensure that 
the reforms undertaken have the desired impact on private sector led growth. Skills 
development is incorporated into components within the private sector support, social 
protection, and ongoing teacher training projects, along with analytical work on skills 
strategy. Finally, employment generation is enhanced through the private sector 
initiatives, and specific (though small-scale) employment activities are included in the 
private sector, social protection, and adaptation to climate change operations. 

44. 
These proposed activities have particular focus on the identified engines of 
growth. While proposed activities to support the tourism sector are explicit, the WBG 
proposes to undertake an agriculture sector AAA (including assessing the export potential 
of niche products to the region), and to increase the sector’s linkages with the tourism 
sector. For instance, the business plan competition of the proposed PSD project will 
support SMEs/farmers interested in increasing the linkages between the agricultural and 
tourism sectors (e.g., by providing fruits and vegetable to hotels), thus sharing the 
prosperity from the envisioned tourism growth. In addition, although coffee and cocoa 
are covered by donor programs (such as a PAPAFPA) and by the exporters already 
operating in the country, given the climatic conditions of STP, there is potential to export 
other niche products such as tropical flowers and fruits, especially to neighboring 
countries. The envisioned agriculture AAA will assess the regional export markets for 
niche products to neighboring countries like Angola, Equatorial Guinea, and Gabon, and 
will also propose agricultural policy issues that can be addressed as part of the DPO 
series.

45. Maintaining macroeconomic stability is fundamental for robust economic 
growth, diversification, poverty reduction, and shared prosperity. The importance of 
prudent macroeconomic management was underscored at the seminar on small island 
economies (Box 1 and Annex 2). To this end, collecting more tax revenue and using 
public resources more efficiently will be crucial, as will more effective delivery of 
essential public goods and services on which the poor rely most heavily. WBG support 
will again buttress government efforts to move forward with critical reforms in these 
areas. Diversifying STP’s small economy, harnessing PSD-led growth, and enhancing 
trade integration are critical if poverty reduction is to accelerate. The drivers of growth 
such as tourism and agribusiness, have not yet fully benefited from reforms to date due to 
constraints in capacity and access to finance, as well as complex business procedures. 
Attracting more FDI, as well as greater regional integration, could be furthered by using 
TF and other resources while leveraging the DPO series, the PSD project, and possible 
IFC initiatives. Cross-sector interventions range from investing in sea and air transit and 
rural infrastructure to reduce trade costs and improving labor force vocational and 
technical skills to sector-specific and trade-related policy reforms.  

21  

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
46. Outcome 1: Strengthened public 
financial and natural resource 
management: Consolidating macroeconomic gains and dismantling critical barriers to 
harnessing drivers of growth are major objectives (e.g., a more viable energy sector, more 
efficient public spending, and more transparency in petroleum and fisheries operations). 
Proposed AAA on agriculture should also begin to highlight possible areas for policy 
dialogue and future reforms (e.g., land). The new DPO series will support selected policy 
areas working in close coordination with the IMF and other DPs.  

• 

22  

• 

Increasing tax collections and the efficiency of public spending. Enhancing tax 
revenue collection, and reducing cross-arrears between Treasury, EMAE, and 
ENCO, will be vital to create fiscal space and reduce the dependence of the 
budget on external resources. The Authorities, as part of the IMF ECF program, 
are planning to introduce measures to strengthen tax administration and, with the 
support of the AfDB, identifying a plan to optimize tax revenues. Supported by 
DPO2, the Government has committed budget resources to pay utility bills of 
public sector bodies to EMAE. 34 The Authorities, as part of the ECF program, are 
further elaborating a plan to improve the financial sustainability of EMAE and in 
turn, to clear arrears from EMAE to ENCO. The WBG, in close collaboration 
with the IMF and AfDB, will support the government efforts to implement these 
plans and to identify a strategy to revise the fuel price mechanism. These efforts 
will be informed by the forthcoming Poverty and Social Impact Analysis (PSIA) 
on electricity subsidies and a proposed policy note on public spending. 
Improving PFM transparency and accountability. The WBG program will help 
STP to build up financial statement preparation, auditing and public procurement 
systems. This relatively young PFM system faces quantitative as well as 
qualitative capacity constraints. STP has gone through the first steps of legislative 
and institutional public procurement reform, but poor capacity constraints at 
central level institutions as well as in the Procurement Management Units at 
sector level hamper good public procurement system performance. Apart from 
current and planned DPO actions, AAA is proposed to analyze the procurement 
system performance with special attention to quantitative and qualitative capacity 
constraints aimed at increased performance of a small island procurement system 
and Value for Money (VfM) for beneficiaries (see Annex 6). 
• Public debt management. Although with support from the DPO series the 
Government has begun to manage debt better, the pace of reform has been slow. 
The WBG, working with the IMF and other DPs, will support the Government to 
update the 2011 reform plan and elaborate a medium-term debt strategy and 
related legislation. 
• Parliamentary oversight. Parliamentary debate on public policy and oversight by 
specialized committees are inadequate. The critical role of Parliament in 
formulating and overseeing reforms was emphasized in the Seminar on Small 
Island Economies. Based on a specific request from Parliament for help in 
becoming more efficient, the Bank has outlined such possible areas of 

34 This follows the recommendations of the Energy Sector Action Plan prepared by the Bank and IFC, with 
support from an Energy Sector Management Assistance Program (ESMAP) TA grant. 

                                                        
collaboration as South-South knowledge exchanges; formal training and capacity 
building; and the possibility for STP legislators to take part in WBG-sponsored 
parliamentarian network gatherings.  
• Fisheries management. Fisheries have significant potential to generate public 
revenues but need to be transparently managed, with tighter monitoring of fishing 
agreements and licenses. The DPO series is helping to firm up the laws related to 
disclosure of fishing agreements and licenses information. The Bank has 
emphasized the need for further reforms to enhance public revenue collection, 
deter corruption, and curb illegal fishing. Data to monitor fishing activities is 
essential to achieve these goals. Improving safety for small-scale fishermen is 
being addressed by Adaptation to Climate Change project financed by the Global 
Environment Facility (GEF). 
• Oil sector governance. Since STP is now an EITI candidate, building the capacity 
of the National Petroleum Agency (ANP) is a PRSP II objective. The WBG will 
continue to provide TA on implementing EITI principles through an EITI Multi-
Donor Trust Fund (MDTF) to ensure that STP is in compliance by October 2015. 
The WBG will also offer support for building the capacity of ANP staff and help 
the Government to review the laws governing the oil industry with a view to 
making it more competitive and attractive to investors. 

47. Outcome 2: Enhanced statistical system. As part of the DPO series, the WBG 
proposes to help the Government to build up its national statistical system, working in 
close collaboration with bilateral donors providing assistance dedicated to data collection. 
There are also a number of areas (e.g., land, fisheries, and enterprise surveys) where 
improved data will be needed to inform the policy discussions and options. 

48. Outcome 3: Improved private sector capacity with a focus on the tourism 
sector and SMEs. Lack of access to financing and high interest rates, 35 together with 
lack of management capacity and ill-targeted marketing strategies, have depressed private 
sector development and diversification, narrowing the sector’s employment potential. 
Legal and institutional reforms in agriculture and land will also need to be addressed to 
spur agribusiness investment, land productivity, and use of collateral to access financing. 
The support envisaged will build upon IFC TA and DPO reforms.  

• 

Tourism: The WBG, including IFC and possibly MIGA, will support tourism by 
continued support to simplify regulation and visa processes, and by enhancing 
STP capacity to implement a tourism strategy. TA on management will be 
provided to the Directorate of Tourism. The sector may also be supported by TFs, 
such as the CIIP linked to the Private Sector Development Project. The proposed 
agricultural sector AAA would also explore the linkages and supply chains for the 
tourism sector. IFC will work with the Bank to define conditions for increased 
private investment in the STP tourism and hospitality industry through a 
feasibility and market assessment study, and will actively explore new markets 

35 In STP interest rates are high—31 percent on short-term bank loans, compared to 18 percent in Gabon 
and 10.5 percent in Burkina Faso. 

23  

 
                                                        
• 

and partnerships, e.g., with Brazil. MIGA can support this effort by offering 
political risk guarantees, for example, to ensure land concessions for tourism 
development against the risks of breach of contract and expropriation, thus 
eliminating a potential obstacle to FDI. Moreover, MIGA analysis of potential 
engagements may help to identify other obstacles to foreign investment and hence 
feed into WBG private sector development work. Backward linkages with the 
local economy may also be evaluated, which may lead to jobs being created in 
manufacturing, services, and agriculture and also help improve infrastructure. 
These linkages can be supported through the proposed BPC Project, which would 
unfold a continuum of support for promising entrepreneurs with the assistance of 
local partners. All this should lead to more job opportunities and greater 
entrepreneurial skills for young people. 
Support to SMEs: The package of support to SMEs, focusing on tourism as the 
key growth service sector, and niche agribusiness (including cooperatives), will 
center around two pillars: promoting access to finance and building SME 
capacity. The agenda for promoting financial inclusion is broad and covers areas 
of 
legal 
framework and collateral 
registry system; capacity building; 
implementation of a leasing program under IFC’s Africa Leasing Facility to 
enable acquisition of productive assets by local SMEs; promotion of financial 
literacy; and entrepreneurship and SME skills development through a business 
plan competition (BPC) 36. An early intervention would support the Authorities to 
develop a financial sector development strategy that would define, prioritize, and 
cost key measures for promoting financial inclusion and ensure financial sector 
stability. Specific training to SMEs may also be provided by IFC’s Sustainable 
Business Advisory Services through the “Business Edge” product program. The 
proposed IDA Private Sector Development Project will provide direct capacity 
building support to entrepreneurs and employees for SMEs in the priority sectors 
of tourism and related services as well as agribusinesses. Existing Bank and IFC 
TFs will seek to be utilized to advance the microfinance agenda. 37. IFC also plans 
to launch SME toolkit activities with the private sector. This initiative would be 
complemented through parallel financing by TFs such as the Competitive 
Industries and Innovation Program (CIIP) focusing on sectors such as tourism, the 
Financial Sector Reform and Strengthening (FIRST) Initiative advancing financial 
inclusion, and other donor initiatives that aim to promote private sector 
development. To foster small enterprise access to commercial loans, IFC will aim 
to enter into a Risk-Sharing Facility with one of STP’s leading commercial banks 
(IDA MSME Risk Sharing Facility). 

49. Outcome 4: Improved business environment and trade regulations. The STP 
Government has adopted a plan to reform the investment climate and has already moved 
forcefully, with IFC TA. The Authorities now plan to establish an electronic Business 
Registry System, online incorporation and other public services, draft a new Construction 

37 IFC research on feasibility of microfinancing in STP found that there appears to be no current initiatives, 
36 This initiative will link with the Outcome on skills development strategy. 
or appropriate institutional and legal frameworks.  

24  

 
                                                        
Act, introduce insolvency legislation, streamline municipal licensing of microbusinesses, 
and build up commercial courts. The Bank’s support to create an alternative dispute 
mechanism that may be endorsed by IFC may result in an arbitration tribunal being set 
up, which would bypass the current lack of judicial capacities. These efforts would be 
supported by TA from the IFC Investment Climate Reform Program, complemented by 
TFs such as CIIP, with policy reforms supported by the new DPO series. These reforms 
will help existing enterprises to grow, help businesses to move beyond the informal 
sector, and increase their likelihood to access business development services and finance. 
To improve energy supply, the WBG will continue its support to the sector and also draw 
on the findings of on-going analytical work on power sector efficiency improvement; the 
goal is to identify key interventions to reduce electrical losses and to make one of STP’s 
hydropower plants more efficient. The CPS also proposes to support STP’s efforts to 
reduce costs of trading. IFC and the Bank together will support the Government in 
defining a roadmap for sustainable port development on STP islands, taking into account 
competing regional port infrastructure. The WBG may also help the Government identify 
a strategy on regional integration opportunities and reforms to reduce the costs, time, and 
paperwork required to import and export, and establish a single electronic trade window. 

50. Outcome 5: Better targeting of energy subsidies. The energy sector faces many 
challenges, including inability to carry out adequate power utility management. The 
WBG will continue its support to the energy sector and also draw on the findings of the 
ongoing AAA on Power Sector Efficiency Improvement. It will focus on identifying the 
key interventions to reduce electrical losses (technical and commercial). The WBG, in 
close collaboration with the IMF and AfdB, will support the Government to implement 
these plans and to identify a strategy to revise the fuel price mechanism. These efforts 
will be informed by the forthcoming Poverty and Social Impact Analysis (PSIA) on 
electricity subsidies and a planned policy note on public spending. The WBG proposes to 
provide capacity building to improve energy utility management, including a gap analysis 
of the current situation, and developing a methodology to calculate technical losses. It 
will also support the training of local workforce in the application of the methodology. 
Other agencies are currently working in the sector: UNDP is preparing a GEF project to 
promote environmentally sustainable and climate resilient grid-based hydroelectric 
electricity through an integrated approach, to promote investments in renewable energy 
and reduction of pressure on natural resources from competing land uses.  

51. Outcome 6: Improved regional broadband connectivity. While it was 
dependent on satellite communications, STP was ill-placed to compete in the global 
economy, given that countries connected to submarine cables access international 
capacity at a fraction of the cost. 38 This limited its potential to create jobs, expand 
production of goods and services, and trade competitively with the rest of the world. 

38In East Africa in particular, where three submarine cables arrived in the last three years, the volume of 
traffic has increased almost 20-fold, and prices have dropped by a factor of almost 10—from 
US$3,750/Mbps/month before cables arrived in 2007 to US$400/Mbps/month today. Prices are down to 
US$100 in Morocco and Australia, and as low as US$10 in Europe. 

25  

 
 
                                                        
However, a submarine cable (supported by the Bank 39) has been operational since early 
2013 and has eased STP’s communication problems (Annex 5, CASCR). A second 
telecommunication operator has now been selected, which should lead to even more 
affordable communication services and harness the potential of ICT to create jobs and 
opportunities. STP may also request and benefit from follow-up projects, such as the 
Central African Backbone (CAB6) regional program. The Government has expressed its 
wish to connect Princípe Island to the backbone, which may be possible through planned 
projects between Equatorial Guinea and Príncipe, but is not yet confirmed.  

Theme 2: Reducing Vulnerability and Strengthening Human Capacity 

52. 
The poor are highly vulnerable to shocks, both economic and climate-related, 
that affect household income and consumption. Thus, there is a need for a social 
protection strategy to help the extremely poor to better manage risks and cope with 
shocks, while promoting investment in child development by improving access to social 
services and participation in income-generating activities. The Government has made 
modest progress, with support from DPs, in drafting a social protection strategy and 
making a safety net system operational. In 2011, with the support of UNICEF and ILO, 
the Government analyzed the social protection system and is currently drawing up a 
social protection strategy focused on noncontributory interventions. 

53. 
Delivering quality social services and providing an appropriately skilled 
labor force has been a challenge for STP. The quality of education is low: there is no 
learning assessment system, 60 percent of teachers are unqualified, and education 
management is poor. STP, with support from the WBG, has increased access to primary 
education, but even with high youth literacy, there is a large gap in skills development 
since the secondary completion rate is less than 60 percent and achievement in vocational 
and technical education beyond that is even lower. As a result youth unemployment is 
twice the national level and the inactivity period after graduation is very long. 40 

54. Outcome 7: Improved poverty targeting. The Social Protection Policy and 
Strategy being discussed recognizes the need to better target safety net interventions if 
extreme poverty is to be eliminated by 2023; other social indicators also need significant 
improvement. Given how little it has been reduced in the past 10 years, it is necessary to 
understand the dynamics of poverty to identify optimal poverty reduction and shared 
prosperity measures. The WBG is working with the Government on a thorough 
assessment of poverty dynamics so that targeting and policy formulation can be 
improved. The current PSIA on energy will also inform policy makers on how to better 
target the poor. The WBG will provide TA to the Government, in collaboration with 
other DPs (particularly UNICEF), to support design and realization of the social 
protection policy and strategy. Bank support would include the analysis of options to 
minimize targeting errors including geographical identification of areas, community 

39 The Bank Regional Central African Backbone Project supported financing for the cable. 
40 According to the African Development Bank (African Economic Outlook 2012), it takes the average 
graduate five years to get a job.   

26  

 
 
 
                                                        
participation in the identification of the poorest to reach the poorest households, and 
poverty incidence at household level to minimize exclusion errors.

55. 
A key element of the social protection strategy under discussion would be a 
labor-intensive public works program, complemented by a revamped conditional 
cash transfer mechanism (Programa de Apoio as Familias em Extrema Pobreza). 
Based on the outcomes of TA, the WBG would consider supporting the Government in 
the design and launch of a public works “plus” program targeting poor unemployed 
youths with training and TA to enhance their skills and employability. The program, 
which would aim for at least 35 percent women participants, would complement the skills 
development work proposed for Outcome 6. It would also seek to scale up the good 
experiences already tested in community-based road maintenance groups (Grupo de 
Manutenção de Estradas), which consist mainly of women. The program would select 
beneficiaries using the targeting process as described above and in addition to possible 
community participation through the system to select beneficiaries, would also include a 
set of social accountability mechanisms to ensure quality of works and beneficiary 
participation, as well as grievance and redress tools. The WBG has secured funds for TA 
from the Rapid Social Response Multi Donor Trust Fund. 

56. Outcome 8: Increased adaptive capacity of coastal communities and reduced 
potential loss of assets and lives. STP’s high vulnerability to climate change in the form 
of coastal erosion and floods has a direct impact on its coastal and fishing communities, 
among the poorest in STP. The WBG will continue to help STP to reduce this 
vulnerability through the Adaptation to Climate Change Project by helping draft climate-
resilient plans for vulnerable settlements, putting in place adaptation and protection 
measures, and strengthening early warning and safety at sea systems for vulnerable 
fishermen. It will also scale up the pilot labor-intensive community-based adaptation 
activities in the climate change project, and seek to involve women. The Project includes 
community monitoring, which includes monitoring the number of days of flooding per 
season, and will soon expand to a pilot community based early warning systems. 

27  

 
 
 
 
57. Outcome 9: Improved training of teachers in primary education. The WBG 
has been actively supporting STP to deliver better deliver education and health services; 
it also provided technical support to prepare the education Country Status Report 2012, 
and the Education Sector Plan 2011–13. The assistance has helped to build capacity to 
deliver health and education services. The on-going Quality Education for All Project 
(FY14), funded by IDA and a GPE grant, aims to improve in-service teacher training. 
Partnership is being sought with Portugal, which is quite active in the sector.  

58. Outcome 10: Increased access to skills development. Given both high youth 
unemployment and skills mismatches, the CPS proposes to support enhancements of 
technical and vocational training by preparing a comprehensive strategy that outlines 
vision, objectives, and expected medium- and long-term outcomes for the sector. The 
strategy will provide a coherent umbrella policy covering all the currently sparse and 
segmented vocational training interventions offering by various DPs. The WBG will 
work on the strategy with the Government, the private sector, and Brazil, Portugal, and 
the AfDB, among other partners. Design of any engagement will also draw upon the 
Africa Region Flagship Report on Skills Development, and to the extent possible also 
link to the private sector and social protection initiatives that include skills training to 
SMEs and those participating in  labor-intensive employment . 

Box 3: Addressing Poverty Reduction and Shared Prosperity 

The proposed WBG activities will be designed to address the twin WBG goals through clear linkages: 
• The DPO series will help maintain macroeconomic stability and trade related reforms that are essential for 
growth. Transparency-related reforms will help enhance value-for-money in public spending. Reforms to 
increase revenue collection, reduce arrears, and improve efficiency and use of public resources will create fiscal 
space to support priority spending and enhance the delivery of essential public goods and services on which the 
poor rely most heavily. Reforms to simplify business and trade procedures and spur tourism will help to foster 
private sector and employment and attract new investments, extending growth benefits to wider population  
• Social sector protection and vulnerability reduction interventions will (i) help to identify social safety net 
programs and targeting mechanisms that will best support the poorest 40 percent, helping to reduce extreme 
poverty and improve the lives of the lowest two economic quintiles; and (ii) partner with the Government to 
design and pilot a labor-intensive public works program to support the poorest, smooth consumption, and 
provide skills training to directly address one of the main reasons that keep certain groups below the poverty 
line. These activities are intended to support backward linkages, supply chains, and skills development. The 
Adaptation to Climate Change Project is already reducing the vulnerability of very poor coastal communities by 
increasing their capacity to adapt to the harmful effects of climate change.  
• The PSD-related initiatives include a project that will directly support capacity building for SME entrepreneurs 
and employees to foster investment and employment creation, so that these entrepreneurs will be in a much 
better position to access credit and other financial services. It is expected that a growing number of SMEs will 
cater to agriculture, tourism, and services (e.g., ICT, finance and leasing, vocational training, agribusiness, and 
agriculture value chains). IFC advisory service, AAA, and TFs will complement private initiatives. The cable 
regional broad band network project is helping to enhance PSD capacity and connectivity. 
• The education and skills activities include a project to improve the quality of primary education and support the 
transition of better-qualified students to higher education to address the skills shortage and mismatch issues and 
contribute to greater youth employment in growing sectors. A skills strategy will inform the initiatives in social 
protection and the private sector. 

28  

 
 
 
 
 
 
Implementing the FY14–FY18 Country Partnership Strategy 

Financial Envelope 

59. 
The expected financial envelope for FY14–FY18 will include an IDA 
allocation (IDA16/17) equivalent to about US$20 million, 41 excluding possible new 
regional IDA activities. IDA allocations for the years beyond FY14 are indicative. Actual 
allocations may vary depending on: (i) total IDA resources available, (ii) the country’s 
performance rating, GNI per capita, and population; (iii) the terms of IDA assistance 
(grants/credits) and the allocation deductions associated with MDRI annual debt service 
foregone; (iv) the performance, other allocation parameters, and IDA assistance terms for 
other IDA borrowers; and (v) the number of IDA-eligible countries. Also, IDA 
allocations are provided in SDR terms, while the US dollar equivalent amount is provided 
at the exchange rate of US$1.50233/SDR (applicable for IDA16) for FY14 and 
US$1.50718/SDR (applicable for the remaining years). The exchange rate for each 
operation depends on the applicable prevailing rate at the time of approval. .New 
resources will also be leveraged from other DPs, TFs, possible IFC investments, and 
possible MIGA guarantees.  

Managing the Program  

60. 
The performance of the portfolio has been largely satisfactory (see Table B2). 
In its current configuration, the portfolio contains one IDA/GPE Quality Education for all 
Project which was approved in December 2013; one Regional Central African Backbone 
APL2 Project (P117652) for US$14.9 million, which has US$1 million left to disburse; a 
GEF Adaptation to Climate Change Project (P111669) for US$4.37 million, of which 30 
percent is disbursed); and TFs (including GEF) totaling US$68.4 million, of which 
US$64.8 million is disbursed (see Annex 7). 42 Efficient PIUs with stable and seasoned 
staff and experience in managing Bank-financed projects has contributed to the 
satisfactory performance—there are no problem projects.  

61. Management of the program is envisaged to be as follows: Two PIUs are 
currently managing Bank programs and an EITI Secretariat will be established with 
MDTF resources. DPOs are handled by the Ministry of Planning and Finance. The CPS 
proposes a liaison officer to facilitate communication with the Authorities and PIUs, 
renting space in the UN offices to smooth communication. The CPS also proposes an 
enhanced PIU within the Ministry of Planning and Finance with fiduciary staff for 
financial management, procurement, and accounting to support Bank-financed projects, 
with staff dedicated to particular projects working with the PIU as needed. Although 
PFM has improved, more needs to be done (see Outcome 1 and Annex 6). 

41 This assumes the same IDA17 envelope. IDA 16 envelope for STP was SDR8.5 million (about US$12.8 
million—US$4.3 million a year). 
42 This amount consists primarily of HIPC Trust Funds.

Partnerships and Donor Coordination 

62. 
The WBG works closely with partners in STP to ensure harmonization and 
better leverage resources. Active multilateral partners in STP include the AfDB, the 
EU, United Nations agencies (UNDP, UNEP, UNICEF, UNFPA, WFP, WHO, IFAD, 
FAO), the IMF, and the Global Fund (see Annex 8 for areas of development assistance). 
Active bilateral partners are Portuguese Cooperation, Brazil, Spain, the French Agency 
for Development (AFD), the USA, and other countries in the region. In particular:  

 The AfDB is implementing its Results-based Country Strategy Paper (2012–16) to 
improve economic and financial governance and strategic planning and 
programming, and to create a more conducive environment for the private sector. 
Approved in July 2012, the strategy focuses on a single pillar, “capacity building 
and 
institutional strengthening,” 
to prepare STP for oil production by 
strengthening key public institutions.  
 The EU Tenth European Development Fund (2008–13) has projects in transport, 
trade, public finance, and support to economic reform. 
 The IMF approved a new Extended Credit Facility (ECF) program in July 2012. 
This is the third IMF program since 2009. The first review for this new ECF 
arrangement took place in March 2013. The second review and the Article IV 
consultation were concluded on December 16 and 19, 2013, respectively.  
 UNDP, Portuguese Cooperation, and Brazil provide TA for, among other areas, 
budgetary management. UNDP is also helping STP attain the MDGs and 
strengthen governance and environmental management, and supports the energy 
sector. UNDP is the lead agency on donor coordination. 
 The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) has supported STP as it works to 
improve both revenue collection and the business environment. 

63. 
In spite of recent progress, there is scope to improve donor coordination. The 
Authorities met with donors in July 2013 to seek support for the Government’s Priority 
Action Plan and to discuss donor coordination. Participants noted that the Aid 
Coordination Unit within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is inadequate, and most DPs do 
not have resident representatives. Proposed were quarterly informal coordination 
meetings and setting up a transparent information system on donor support. The 
possibility of a multidonor fund to support priority development areas was suggested to 
reduce transaction costs and improve coordination and management of assistance. At the 
September 2013 meeting, UNDP presented a consolidated matrix (a first cut) of donor-
supported projects. Although the matrix is not yet complete, this represents an important 
step toward donor coordination. The Government presented a plan for establishing a 
more effective Aid Coordination Unit, with assistance from UNDP.  

64. Moving forward, The World Bank Group will play a larger role in donor 
coordination. STP is now being overseen by the Gabon Country Office, whose 
proximity and ease of travel will bode well for enhanced participation in donor 
coordination.

Monitoring and Evaluation 

65. 
Progress on the CPS will be mainly monitored using the Results Matrix (see 
Annex 1). The results framework links WBG activities to select STP objectives (as 
articulated in the PRSP II) through chains that clearly identify inputs, outcomes (to be 
monitored against baseline and target indicators and with gender-disaggregated data 
where possible) and intermediate milestones. These linkages offer lines of sight to clarify 
how WBG-supported engagements and partnerships can help STP move toward its 
objectives of poverty reduction and shared prosperity in STP. A CPS Progress Report at 
midpoint will offer an opportunity both to assess progress and to make any necessary 
course corrections. Of particular importance will be what happens in the oil sector. 
Regular consultations will be undertaken with the client, DPs, and other stakeholders to 
receive feedback and assess progress. The experience with the community and local 
feedback mechanisms in the Adaptation to Climate Change Project could be replicated in 
other WBG engagements, in particular, the Social Protection and Vulnerability Pilot. It is 
expected that M&E and data-gathering systems already in place or part of other projects 
in STP will elicit data for measuring results. 

IV. MANAGING RISKS 

66. 
The main risk to realization of the CPS emanates from political uncertainty 
that could slow reform. The current political scene is, as noted, fragmented and fragile; 
disruptions caused by a sudden change of government could delay or encumber policy 
reforms, though the major political parties are committed to structural reform. This risk is 
moderate and is already partially mitigated given that the PRSP-II, which outlines the 
priorities and policy directions for STP, and with which the proposed CPS program 
(including the ongoing DPO series) is aligned, was developed through an extensive 
consultative process and buy-in from wide range of stakeholders including all major 
political parties. This risk can be further mitigated by a carefully timed sequence of DPOs 
to advance reforms even with changes in government, complemented by targeted 
constituency outreach, public information campaigns, stakeholder engagement, and 
capacity building. Other risks and proposed mitigating measures include: 

• 

Inadequate institutional capacity needs to be resolved. To that end, the WBG 
has capacity building as a cross-cutting theme in such areas of intervention as 
economic management, EITI, human development, energy and the business 
environment. 
• Risks to macroeconomic stability are high, also as a result of the high debt 
level and narrow export base, impacting the DPOs. A new joint WB-IMF DSA 
is under preparation and is expected to shed more light on the impact of the 
overall debt on the macro stability. On the Bank’s side, this risk will be mitigated 
through continuing dialogue with the authorities on this issue. If there is 
significant deterioration in macroeconomic stability, the Bank will continue 
providing policy advice but may opt to suspend its DPO program and divert the 
IDA funds to other programs.  

31  

 
 
 
 
• Any global economic slowdown will pose significant risks given STP’s 
dependence on a narrow export base and limited sources of external earnings.  
Though the previous global recession did not impact STP strongly, maintaining 
the focus on prudent macroeconomic management will be key.  
• The fiduciary risk related to use of public funds may prove challenging. This 
risk could be mitigated by tighter internal controls and by the internal and external 
audits embedded in WBG programs. It would also be helpful to improve fiduciary 
capacity by strengthening internal controls, improving the quality of accounting 
records, and producing State financial statements—all of which the CPS proposes.  
• Governance may deteriorate. The WBG will continuously monitor aspects of 
the country situation that might directly affect its programs. The interventions 
proposed have been carefully selected to ensure appropriate governance. 
• Due to compounding risks and challenges all results may not be achieved 
during the CPS period. Given the small IDA envelope and scale of 
engagements, a limited administrative budget, constrained staff resources, 
inadequate STP implementation capacity, and lack of reliable statistical and M&E 
information, there is a significant risk that all CPS results may not be obtained as 
scheduled. However, there is demand for WBG resources and advice, and 
progress achieved in some key areas would substantially unlock the potential for 
poverty-reducing growth and equitable prosperity. 
• The tenuous growth-poverty nexus may continue to be a challenge. Recent 
economic growth has not translated into commensurate or expected reductions in 
poverty. The quality of economic growth matters; recent and continuing AAA 
(CEM, DTIS Update, and Poverty Assessment) will continue to provide the 
analytical underpinnings of strategies for poverty reduction and their realization. 
Given the Government’s concerns in this area, WBG has proposed to support a 
variety of initiatives for poverty reduction and shared prosperity.

Annex 2: São Tomé and Príncipe: Seminar on Small Island Economies 
During September 10-12, 2013 a high level seminar was held in São Tome and 
Príncipe (STP) to discuss the “Growth and Economic Diversification: Small States’ 
Comparative Experiences,” in particular, small island economies. The seminar was 
organized by the Government of the Democratic Republic of São Tome and Principe and 
the World Bank. The main objectives of the seminar were to: (i) assist the Government of 
STP with inputs, ideas, and good practices to foster the country’s social and economic 
development and, particularly, efforts for economic diversification, promotion of growth 
and creation of jobs, and poverty reduction; and (ii) strengthen the WBG’s consultative 
process to gather inputs for the preparation of the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS). 
The seminar also aimed to support STP’s preparation for the third International 
Conference of Small Insular States which will take place in 2014. 

2. 
Contributors 
to 
the deliberations 
included high-level policymakers, STP 
government officials and stakeholders, and a number of different entities and individuals 
representing national and multinational institutions and small countries with similar 
characteristics as STP. Among key participants were: Mr. Alcino de Barros Pinto 
(Speaker of the National Assembly of STP); Mr. Gabriel Arcanjo da Costa (Prime 
Minister and Head of Government of STP); Mr Jose Cassandra (President of the Regional 
Government of STP); Mr. Owen Arthur (former Prime-Minister and Minister of Finance 
of Barbados); Mr. Pierre Laporte (Minister of Finance of Seychelles); Mr. Agapito 
Mendes Dias (Executive Director of the World Bank); Mr. Jean-Philippe Prosper (Vice 
President, IFC); Mr. Julio Revila (acting Country Director of the World Bank for STP), 
and Mr. Ricardo Veloso (head of IMF mission to STP). 

3. 
The seminar was conceived as South-South sharing of experiences, focusing on 
(i) macroeconomic resilience and economic governance, (ii) the potential role of the 
tourism sector to spur growth, (iii) the role of parliament in the reform agenda, and (iv) 
measures to spur private sector growth and competitiveness. Consultations took place 
with members of parliament, central government officials, the regional government of 
Principe, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and the private sector. The objective 
was to foster a dialogue and reflections among the main stakeholders. Seminar sessions 
included: 
• 
Strengthening of the tourism sector in Principe Island 
• Building resilience and improved economic governance in small states 
• The role of the parliament in transforming a small economy 
• 
Fostering private sector growth and competitiveness 

The main conclusion and recommendations that emerged from the seminar were: 

4. 
Sound macroeconomic fundamentals are essential to achieve sustainable 
growth. This has been the basis of the success of both Barbados and Seychelles in 
achieving higher levels of development. STP has undertaken several steps to accelerate 
fiscal consolidation in order to maintain macroeconomic stability and support strong and 
consistent growth: Significant results have been already achieved, including a primary 

38  

 
 
 
 
domestic deficit in line with concessional lending policy and a substantial reduction of 
inflation. The Government of STP should continue with its efforts on strengthening the 
macroeconomic fundamentals with the support of the IMF, the World Bank, the AfDB, 
and other development partners.  

5. 
Structural and cross-cutting reforms are the key to promote private sector 
growth and overall competitiveness. The experiences of successful small island states 
show that, in addition to macroeconomic fundamentals, it is very important to develop a 
clear path of structural reforms aimed at fostering private sector growth. Two 
comprehensive 
issues are overall 
improvement 
in competitiveness and reduce 
vulnerabilities. The reform program should be guided by a lucid development strategy 
with clearly measurable targets, and should be based on the following principles: 
strengthening of economic governance, human resource development, a comprehensive 
tax reform that enables and does not hider private sector growth, leadership initiatives for 
regional integration, institutional reforms, and good governance. STP has undertaken 
steps to improve the investment climate (for example, the Government’s ongoing 
Licensing Reform Program is simplifying business registration). But a more ambitious 
program of reforms needs to be designed and implemented. The development of key 
infrastructure, such as power and ports, need to be led by a clear commitment to develop 
financially sustainable provision of services. Further efforts should be made in creating 
an adequate regulatory, financial and tax framework, beyond only trying to finance these 
projects. The Government also needs to tackle key reforms in the energy sector, such as 
improving the financial position and service delivery of the electricity company (EMAE). 
EMAE has weak finances and provides irregular, low-quality service. Low levels of 
electrification, with frequent blackouts, represent significant economic losses.  

6. 
The service sector, particularly tourism, has a large potential to accelerate 
sustainable and inclusive growth. The cases of Barbados and Seychelles offer good 
guidance on focusing on the service sector, and especially tourism, as a way of fostering 
broad-based growth with significant generation of employment. A set of principles has 
been followed in these countries: avoid monopoly, but guarantee property rights; 
emphasize the niche character of tourism development in the islands combining it with 
the historical heritage; develop appropriate tourism strategies; let the industry lead and 
prosper and do not penalize it with taxes and fees; diversify the markets to reduce 
vulnerability; invest in the maintenance of infrastructure; and balance investments so as 
not to degrade the environment. STP needs to position itself in the appropriate segment of 
the service-related value chain for investments. For example, tourism should be focused 
on high quality and not based on mass tourism. In Príncipe, some of these developments 
are taking place, but the overall STP tourism strategy needs to be revitalized.  

7. 
Undertaking reforms requires, however, a shared consensus across economic, 
social and political actors. The experience of Barbados shows that a tripartite consensus 
- among the public and the private sectors and the trade unions - is key for moving 
forward the reform agenda. Annual consultations were held and protocols signed by the 
representatives of each party setting the reform agenda in key areas, such as on the 
reform of the tax system. The role of parliament has been key in the success of Barbados 

39  

 
 
 
and Seychelles. Development occurs more easily when there is an environment of 
transparency and accountability. Parliament should play a bigger role as the guardian of 
fiscal stability as well as the main actor in dealing with structural reforms. The critical 
roles include creating consensus, managing sectoral transformations, strengthening the 
rule of law, and fostering institutional reforms. Training and strengthening capacity in 
parliament is a constant process (“Parliament is not only a place to talk, but a place to 
think.”).  

40  

Annex 3: São Tomé and Príncipe - Poverty Profile 43  
1. 
Almost two-thirds of the population is poor in STP. The incidence, intensity, 
and severity of poverty are slightly higher in urban areas. In 2010, about 61.7 percent of 
the population consumed less than a basic basket of goods. A slightly larger share of the 
total and poor population lives in urban areas. In urban areas, the poverty headcount 
index was 63.8 percent while in rural areas it was 59.4 percent. The poverty gap, which 
measures the distance of the poor to the poverty line as a percentage of the latter, is 24.7 
percent in urban areas and 21.3 percent in rural areas (Table 1).

2. 
There are also wide disparities across regions in terms of poverty. The lowest 
poverty rate is observed in the Center Region, which is predominantly rural. The poverty 
rate 44 in the (urban) capital, Água Grande, is 62 percent. In the poorest southern regions 
(Caue and Lemba), poverty concerns 74 percent of the population, and urban and rural 
areas display similar poverty levels. The Center (Me-Zochi, Cantagalo and Lobata), 
which is predominantly rural, has the lowest poverty rate (57.3 percent). Finally, the 
poverty rate in the island of Príncipe, which is also mostly rural, is a high 69 percent.

More than half of the population has two or fewer meals a day. Although 
poverty is higher in urban areas, city dwellers suffer less risk of food insecurity. In 2010, 
only 44.1 percent of non-poor households and 30.1 percent of poor households had three 
meals a day. The proportion of households having three or more meals a day is 
considerably larger in urban areas (41.2 percent) than in rural areas (32.6 percent). 

43 This section draws heavily on the ongoing World Bank, Sao Tome and Principe Poverty Assessment. 
44 Unless otherwise stated, poverty rates refer to absolute poverty.

Similarly, 11 percent of urban households reported having only one meal compared to 
14.5 percent of rural households. 

4. 
Electricity covers less than 50 percent of poor households. There are major 
differences in the use of energy sources between urban and rural areas. Electricity is more 
widespread among non-poor families (58.3 percent) compared to poorer families (47.5 
percent). Lighting is instead powered by oil to a larger extent in poor households (42.1 
percent) than in non-poor households (31.8 percent). The use of energy sources varies 
widely, with 73.9 percent of households in rural areas using wood for cooking compared 
to 34.6 percent in urban areas.  

5. 
In the last 10 years, access to water has improved in rural areas helping to 
close the urban-rural gap, while access to sanitation facilities improved at a slow 
pace. According to the World Development Indicators, 89 percent of the population 
living in urban areas, and 88 percent in rural areas, had access to water (2008). These 
figures represent an improvement compared to the beginning of the decade, when only 70 
percent of rural population had access to water. In 2000, only 27 percent of the urban 
population had access to sanitation facilities; in 2010, the figure had improved marginally 
to 30 percent. A similar trend is observed in rural areas where there was a very marginal 
increase (about 4 percent) in the share of the population with access to sanitation facilities 
between 2000 and 2010.  

6. 
Inequality is low compared to other Sub-Saharan countries and slightly 
higher in urban areas. STP is among the countries with the most equal income 
distribution in Sub-Saharan Africa. The Gini index for STP in 2010 was 33.6, well below 
42.7, which is the median Gini index for Sub-Saharan Africa 45. The Gini index in urban 
areas is 34.3 compared to 32.7 in rural areas. STP has become slightly more unequal, 
especially in urban areas. However, the absolute magnitude of these changes is contained: 
the Gini index rose from 31.8 to 33. 

7. 
Between 2000 and 2010, the poverty rate at the national level declined by 5.1 
percentage points from 66.8 to 61.7 percent 46. The decline was larger in rural areas 
compared to urban areas. In urban areas, the poverty rate declined by 4 percentage points 
from 67.8 to 63.8 percent. In rural areas, the poverty rate decreased by 6.2 percentage 
points from 65.6 to 59.4 percent. Over time, the center of the country, experienced a 
major fall in poverty rates (about 7 percentage points) between 2000 and 2010, followed 
by the capital. Poverty rates in southern STP and in Príncipe remained almost invariant 
(Figure 2). 

45 Calculation based on the latest available data in Povcalnet. 
46 Absolute poverty rates for 2000 were calculated by the World Bank team following the imputation 
methodology proposed by Christiaensen, Luc, Peter Lanjouw, Jill Luoto, and David Stifel (2012), "Small 
area estimation-based prediction methods to track poverty: validation and applications," Journal of 
Economic Inequality, 10, issue 2, pp.267-297. This has allowed a comparison of absolute poverty rates 
between the two years for the first time (see São Tomé and Príncipe Poverty Assessment, forthcoming).

8. 
Differences in agriculture productivity might explain the observed variations 
in poverty rates across regional rural areas. Agriculture productivity in the Center is 
higher than the rest of the economy, allowing a higher proportion of its population to 
move above the poverty line or very close to it. The Center has benefitted from programs 
that have been supporting the creation of cocoa farmers’ and fishermen’s cooperatives, 
increasing agriculture productivity. These programs began in the mid-1990s with 
PNAPAF (National Support to Smallholders Program) and later with PAPAFPA 
(Participatory Smallholder Agriculture and Artisanal Fisheries Development Project). 
These programs include advice on microcredit, extension services, diversification, and 
rural infrastructure. In contrast, the South West is highly dependent on a poorly 
developed agriculture sector and weaker infrastructure which make the population in the 
region highly vulnerable to price variations and very poor basic food supply.

and 2010. 

9. 
The level and trend of the national urban poverty rates are driven by the 
labor market developments of the capital. Água Grande accounts for 72.4 percent (in 
2010) of the total urban population. According to census data, the population of Água 
Grande increased by 41 percent between 2001 and 2012, and rose from 51,886 to 73,091. 
Labor market indicators show that Água Grande has experienced a significant decrease 
(15 percentage points) in the inactive rate, and an increase (8.6 percentage points) in the 
rate of employment and unemployment (7 percentage points). Reasons that can explain 
the observed change in the proportion of inactive workers is the emergence of a tertiary 
sector (that includes hotel, banks, and supermarkets) that generates new economic 
interactions but is unable to incorporate all new workers entering into the labor market, 
either for demand problems (small and weak firms) or supply constraints (skill 
mismatches given a low-skilled labor force).  

10. 
Poverty reduction is higher for households with more educated heads. In 
2010, the poverty rate for heads-of-household with no formal education was 73.8 percent, 
66 percent for heads of household who have finished some primary education, and 
declines for those who have finished some lower and higher secondary, or tertiary 

43  

 
 
 
 
 
education (55.1 and 31.9 percent, respectively). Comparing 2000 and 2010 data, the 
poverty rate did not change for households whose heads have no education. By contrast, 
the poverty rates for households whose heads have higher education have decreased 
considerably by 9.1 percent, 1 percent, and 10.1 percent for those households whose 
heads have some primary, some lower secondary, and some higher secondary or tertiary 
education, respectively. 

11. 
School enrollments at all levels of education have improved and STP has 
almost reached universal basic education coverage. According to official figures, the 
enrollment rate for each level of education has increased since 2006. In 2011, the 
enrollment rate in basic education was 94.9 percent. Quality indicators based on 
standardized tests, such as the PISA, are absent.  

12. 
Poverty rates among female-headed households are higher. The rate of 
poverty reduction for female-headed households is smaller than that for male-headed 
households due to differences in education levels. The poverty rate for female-headed 
households declined from 71.4 percent in 2000 to 67 percent in 2010, while it went down 
from 64.7 percent to 58.6 percent for male-headed households. One possible explanation 
is that the education level for female-headed households is lower than male-headed 
households (67 percent of female-headed households have no formal education versus 33 
percent of male-headed households).  

13. 
There is a gender gap in literacy rates although it has been closed for young 
people. According to the World Development Indicators (WDI), 89 percent of adults 
could read and write a short, simple statement in their everyday life in 2010. This figure 
is not as compelling when broken down by gender. Only 84.7 percent of women older 
than 14 years are literate compared to 93.9 percent of men according to the WDI 
definition. Yet in 2010, the literacy rate of young women overcame the literacy rates of 
young men.

Annex 4: São Tomé and Príncipe - Statistical Issues 
The latest household survey was completed in 2010. Nevertheless, the scarcity of reliable 
socioeconomic statistics and weak statistical capacity constrain the design and implementation of 
public policies. 
2. 
Statistics of National Accounts are at an early stage of development and estimates of 
GDP by sector composition are weak.  

3. 
Economic policies are often based on administrative sector information which makes it 
difficult to set priorities and measure progress toward achieving the MDGs or monitor PRSP 
implementation. 

4. 
The ongoing DPO series supports efforts to strengthen statistical capacity, including the 
recently completed census of the population and STP membership to AFRISTAT. The Poverty 
Assessment being analyzed and finalized would also provide related statistics, including gender 
dimensions. In 2014, the Authorities further aim to submit to the National Assembly, for the first 
time, an evaluation report of STP’s system of national statistics to raise awareness and improve 
the management and reporting of statistics.

Annex 5: São Tomé and Príncipe - CAS Completion Report  

I. INTRODUCTION 

1. 
This Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) Completion Report (CASCR) provides an 
evaluation of the World Bank Group assistance to Sao Tome and Principe during the FY06-12 
period supported by the Country Assistance Strategy (Report No. 32078) and Interim Strategy 
Note (ISN, Report No. 59853-ST). The CASCR is prepared using as background information the 
CAS and ISN, the latest Implementation Status Reports (ISR) for projects in the portfolio, and 
Implementation Completion Reports (ICRs) for operations closing during that period. The 
CASCR evaluation follows the “Guidance to Staff on the Country Assistance Strategy 
Completion Report” issued in October 2012. 

Summ a ry o f F ind ing s and Ra t ing s 

2. 
The Country Team rates aggregate progress toward achieving CPS outcomes as 
satisfactory. Across the broad range of engagement areas, the CAS/ISN program achieved 
results in line with expectations, without reversals or deficiencies despite external shocks and 
internal political tensions during the CAS/ISN implementation period. The combination of 
analytical work (AAA), Development Policy Operations (DPOs), and Technical Assistance (TA) 
provided for a stable macroeconomic base where support and enhancement of investment climate 
strategies and the strengthening of governance, public institutions, and human capital could take 
place.  

3. 
The Country Team rates World Bank Group performance as satisfactory. The WBG 
program grew in scope and size, aided by STP’s membership in IFC. The Bank responded 
promptly and effectively by supporting the Government to face external shocks (for example, the 
food and global financial crises) by providing additional resources from the IDA- Crises 
Response Window. Access to additional resources from Regional allocations, Global 
Environment Fund (GEF), and Education for All (EFA) was able to promote private sector 
investments, enhance human capacity, and address climate change adaptation.  

Coun t ry Le ve l Goa l s  

4. 
The first Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP), prepared in 2003, included a 
comprehensive and extensive consultative process amongst the key stakeholders. In 2005, a set 
of annexes to the PRSP main document provided updates on the previous two years’ of 
macroeconomic performance, indicators, and implementation framework, as well as a summary 
of the new petroleum revenue management law, and a summary of the PRSP implementation 
experience during 2003-2004.  

5. 
The IMF and World Bank Boards endorsed the PRSP and the related Joint Staff Advisory 
Note (JSAN). The JSAN noted that the PRSP provided a reliable framework for reducing 
poverty. In addition, it highlighted the areas of weaknesses in the PRSP that could be 
strengthened through, inter alia: (i) prioritizing sectoral strategies and making them fully 

46  

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
consistent with the annual fiscal budget and the overall medium-term poverty alleviation 
strategy; and (ii) launching an in-depth analysis of the impact of potential oil revenues on the 
economy.  

6. 
The CAS (FY06-09) aimed to focus on a few selected areas of intervention to maximize 
the Bank’s impact and to ensure complementarity with other Development Partners (DPs). This 
selectivity was also dictated by the limited IDA financial envelope which was available for STP. 
This would provide an opportunity to build upon ongoing activities and enhance and deepen the 
strategy laid out in the previous strategy. The CAS objectives were (i) to continue the 
implementation of ongoing activities, especially with respect to social sector service delivery 
(Social Sector Support Project, FY04), capacity-building in public finance management 
(Governance Capacity Building Technical Assistance Project, FY05), institutional support to 
managing the oil sector, and follow-up on recommendations of the Bank’s knowledge products, 
and (ii) to gradually move to Development Policy Operations (budget support) starting in FY07 
with the objective of strengthening implementation of the PRSP and maximizing IDA’s impact. 
The DPOs would open the necessary policy space by adopting a demand-driven and flexible 
approach, which is proving to be an effective engagement strategy in a fragile state with serious 
capacity constraints. Additionally, to date, the Bank is the only DP that is providing budget 
support.  

7. 
STP reached the completion point under the enhanced Highly Indebted Poor Countries 
(HIPC) Initiative in March 2007, thus benefiting from debt relief in the amount of US$314 
million from both HIPC the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) 47. Paris Club creditors 
agreed in May 2007 to cancel all their outstanding claims on the country. As a result of MDRI, 
the activity of the relevant government office is quite limited and it follows approximately 20 
multilateral loans. Most bilateral debt has been cancelled. Major outstanding creditors include 
Angola, Portugal, Nigeria, and Taiwan, China. Debt Management Performance Analyses were 
undertaken in 2009 and in 2012.  

8. 
The 2006 JSAN Annual Progress Report 48 stressed the need for maintaining 
macroeconomic stability and strengthening structural reforms in order to achieve the objectives 
of the PRSP. Moreover, improving the business climate and provision of utility services remain 
essential to allow the private sector to thrive and promote growth. The Authorities are aware of 
the need to increase aid absorption capacity (only 68 percent of the 2006 Public Investment Plan 
was actually executed) and to improve the efficiency and transparency in the use of public 
resources, including from HIPC/MDRI debt relief and possible future oil revenues in order to 
achieve the PRSP objectives. The 2008 JSAN Annual Progress Report 49 agreed with the 
importance of debt relief to boost pro-poor spending, the removal of obstacles to economic 
growth, the continued policy of refraining from new external borrowing on non-concessional 
terms, and measures to promote private sector participation and strengthening the regulatory 
framework as important pillars of a strategy to improve public infrastructure under a constrained 
budget.

9. 
Despite high political instability that hampered decision making, changed priorities and 
policies, and caused inconsistencies and delays in the DPs’ programs, the Authorities were able 
to mitigate damage with the support of the IMF and Bank by anchoring the macroeconomy and 
developing priorities around pre-established strategies. The Government has been making 
consistent progress by establishing the legal frameworks and structures that would gradually 
improve transparency and accountability in the public and oil sectors including, inter alia: the 
Organic Law on Public Financial Management, developing the Exclusive Economic Zone 
(2008), reform of the tax legislation, a new Procurement Law, reforms in the Government 
financial management system (Sistema de Administração Financeira do Estado - SAFE) to 
integrate computerized system (e-SAFE) with a harmonized program, rules and procedures, and 
execution control and assessment of public resources. 

10. 
An Interim Strategy Note (FY11-12) 50 extended the CAS period and revised the 
objectives of the CAS to support the Authorities to develop a new development strategy taking 
into consideration the uncertainties about when oil revenues would be likely to materialize. The 
results matrix was also revised: the original CAS outcomes that have been achieved were not 
included in the revised results matrix.  

11. 
The Second Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP-II) was published while the ISN 
was in place 51 and was endorsed by the Boards of the World Bank and IMF (JSAN-II) 52. The 
JSAN-II praised the Government for its focus on (i) immediate policy actions and on the 
achievement of medium-term goals for good governance and public-sector reform, (ii) 
continuing to build upon economic performance through implementation of structural reforms 
and barring a serious deterioration of external conditions or other unpredictable shocks, and (iii) 
prioritizing reforms that are urgent regardless of whether oil is produced or not, particularly in 
the areas of good governance, competitiveness, and diversification.  

12. 
This report is organized as follows: Section II below details the assessment of the 
program’s performance, and provides a concise review of the progress made towards achieving 
CAS/ISN outcomes and identifies key challenges remaining; Section III details the evaluation of 
the Bank Group’s performance in designing and implementing the CAS/ISN and managing risks; 
and Section IV presents key lessons learned and outlines recommendations for future program 
design and implementation. 

II. WORLD BANK GROUP PROGRAM ASSESSMENT 

Program Performance: Satisfactory 
Bank Performance: Satisfactory 

13. 
The CAS/ISN program is rated satisfactory as the country made progress towards all 
major expected outcomes despite external shocks and internal political tensions during the 

50 Report No. 59853-ST dated April 15, 2011 
51 Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper was presented to for IMF and WB review on October 2013.  
52 The Joint IDA-IMF Staff Advisory Note on the Second Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (Report 72388-ST) was 
issued on March 2013.

CAS/ISN implementation period. Program performance has to be viewed in the context of 
exogenous and unplanned factors that affected STP during the period including the fuel and food 
price increases, the world economic downturn and political instability. The WBG, through 
remote collaboration from the Mozambique and Washington DC offices, has been able to 
support the Government with a combination of analytical work, technical support, and financing 
for the implementation of the PRSP-I (2005) and development of the PRSP-II. IDA allocation 
during rounds 14 and 15 53 were small but the World Bank team efforts and good partnership 
with the Authorities ensured that the funds were maximized.  

14. 
During the CAS/ISN period, STP joined the International Finance Corporation (IFC)54 
leading to significant progress in improving transparency, fostering competition and improving 
the business environment. IFC’s advisory and technical assistance has been focusing on the 
promotion of the private sector, including enhancing the country’s investment climate in order to 
reduce the cost of doing business and attract investments that will broaden the export base. The 
benefits of this engagement were reflected in the Doing Business Surveys and Transparency 
International 55 evaluations. On December 20, 2012, DTP became the 178th member of the 
Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) following completion of the formal 
requirements for membership. Following membership, MIGA is open for business in the country 
offering covers for investors concerned about Transfer Restriction, Breach of Contract, 
Expropriation, and War and Civil Disturbance risks. MIGA has a strategic priority to focus on 
IDA countries, such as STP.  MIGA will also seek out opportunities to work alongside the Bank 
team. An example of possible MIGA’s support would be supporting the energy sector by 
complementing a partial risk guarantee for a power supply agreement or IFC funding for equity 
projects. MIGA is currently looking at a number of leads in the country and will continue to look 
for opportunities to support investors into the country and develop a presence for investors 
concerned about non-commercial risk in STP.  

15. 
The principle CAS objectives were to: (i) support the implementation of the PRSP and 
strengthen the areas where the PRSP needed to be improved, as highlighted in the JSAN, and (ii) 
provide assistance to STP to ensure that it was sufficiently prepared to maximize the benefits of 
future oil revenues. The CAS proposed a results framework, summarized in a Results Matrix. It 
contained the five PRSP objectives aligned to 18 CAS outcomes. The ISN reaffirmed the 
relevance of the CAS, adjusted some of the CAS outcomes and included IFC operations in the 
program of support to the country. 

Ob je c t iv es o f the A s s i s tance 

16. 
The WBG’s approach to support the country’s development goals was embodied in two 
strategic objectives: (i) accelerate sustainable and broad-based growth and (ii) strengthen 
governance, public institutions and human capital. WBG assistance aimed at raising 
competitiveness and employment while addressing vulnerability and resilience issues. It

To accelerate sustainable and broad-based growth, the program sought to promote four 
main areas: (i) consolidating macro-stability, especially fiscal sustainability; (ii) strengthening 
infrastructure, with emphasis on energy and telecommunications; (iii) enhancing STP’s 
investment climate; and (iv) strengthening the financial system. To strengthen governance, 
increase transparency, and build up public institutions and human capital the focus areas were: 
(i) strengthening transparency and accountability of budgetary operations and improve payroll 
management; (ii) increasing transparency and accountability of upcoming petroleum revenues; 
(iii) developing human resources and access to basic social services; (iv) creating strategies and 
information to allow the measurement of success; and (v) strengthening environment protection 
and resilience.  

18. 
The CAS outlined a notional lending program that ranged from a base case scenario of 
US$5.5 million to a high case of US$10 million supporting ongoing projects and development 
policy lending operations. Based on the Africa Region’s Strategy of attention to small states, 
partnerships and regional integration, the team leveraged IDA resources to the fullest extent 
possible. This framework generated a multi-stakeholder effort 
integrating 
the unique 
contributions of the IMF, EITI, AfDB, EU and other bilateral development partners in a unified, 
holistic program. The WBG was able to supplement lending and knowledge products to benefit 
STP with a regional integration operation - the Central Africa Backbone-APL2 (US$14.9 
million) funding the submarine fiber-optic cables, and GEF financing (US$4.1 million) for 
climate change mitigation, thus increasing the CAS base case scenario by 700 percent (see Table 

50

A. Progress on Strategic Objective I: Promote Broad-Based and Sustainable Economic 
Growth 

20. 
The CAS/ISN development goals under the first strategic objective were: (i) consolidate 
macro-stability especially fiscal sustainability; (ii) strengthen infrastructure, with emphasis on 
energy and telecommunications; (iii) enhance STP’s investment climate; and (iv) strengthen the 
financial system. Nine of the 10 results indicators under the CAS/ISN strategic objective have 
been achieved; one was not achieved, despite having made some progress. 

Revised CAS Goal 1(i): Consolidate macro-stability especially fiscal sustainability  

21. 
Development Policy Operations 56 and knowledge products provided throughout the 
CAS/ISN period enhanced the Government’s ability to develop a culture of prudent 
macroeconomic management. The WBG supported the Authorities in accelerating the process of 
fiscal adjustment through a series of gradual reductions of nonessential expenditures, containing 
the growth of the wage bill, and enhancing the enforcement of tax collection. The Debt 
Management Performance Assessment carried out in 2009 and again in 2012 led to the 
development of a Debt Management Reform Plan being implemented by the Authorities for 
stronger fiscal controls, thus reducing the domestic primary deficit to 4.1 percent of GDP in 2010 
and then to 3.2 percent in 2012.  

Revised CAS Goal 1(ii): Strengthen infrastructure, with emphasis on energy and 
telecommunications 

22. 
Infrastructure strengthening in STP benefits from the holistic approach and integration of 
the Development Partners. The WBG, through the CEM and other knowledge products, provided 
the support to the Authorities in identifying the top priorities in overcoming the large 
infrastructure deficit. Telecommunication and energy sectors were recognized as the most 
transformative and capable of unlocking the country’s development potential by fostering local 
potential and as a basic pillar to attract foreign direct investments. 

23. 
The Central Africa Backbone APL2 
funded 
extensive 
improvements 
in 
telecommunication with the arrival of the ACE submarine cable in the country in November 
2012. With little over a month of operation, the use of capacity has gone up five times (from 50 
to 250 Mbs), and given the current cable capacity, it can still increase 18 times more before 
requiring an upgrade of the international cable capacity. Average prices are already coming 
down (the operator is offering four to eight times more capacity for the same price). Tender for a 
second telecommunications operator was launched and one proposal was received on March 8, 
2012. In its technical proposal, the proposed licensee shows investments plans for US$16 million 
including 25 stations in STP. 

24. 
The 2010 “Revitalization of the Power Sector and Private Sector Participation” study 
carried out with the support of Public-Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility (PPIAF) and the

IFC 57 identified systemic constrains within the energy sector and provided ideas on how to 
overcome them. The Authorities have been evaluating the best way to implement the study 
recommendations. Amongst other DPs’ complementary efforts on the sector, the Government 
accepted a grant from the SIDS-DOCK 58 Partnership and the Energy Sector Management 
Assistance Program (ESMAP) 59 to fund detailed engineering designs necessary to upgrade the 
transmission and distribution system and reduce the commercial losses. A campaign to replace 
incandescent light bulbs with Compact Fluorescent Lamps Reduction is planned for FY13 and 
has the potential to reduce peak of energy demand in the country.  

25. 
Although the Bank has been providing support to the Government on the energy sector, 
the design and submission for discussion to key stakeholders of regulations to reduce electricity 
fraud and theft have not been completed.  

Revised CAS Goal 1(iii): Enhance STP’s investment climate 

26. 
At the beginning of the CAS period, STP ranked among the least attractive places - 180th 
out of 183 countries - to start a business according to the Doing Business Survey. Starting in 
2007, Development Partners 60 started providing technical assistance to STP for the improvement 
of the investment climate. The IFC advisory services started in 2008 focusing on improving the 
commercial code, reducing the number of procedures to start a business, and improving access to 
electricity and telecommunication services, amongst others. With IFC support, STP introduced 
reforms of the century-old business licenses regime. The reforms left only a few business 
licenses related to public health, safety and environment. This work complemented the launch of 
the one-stop shop for business registration (GUE). The GUE started with 57 new registrations in 
2010, but with the abolition of alvarás, many more entrepreneurs were attracted to formalize 
their existing businesses or starting new ones: the number went up by 241, more than quadruple, 
and then 388 more in 2012 – up by another 62 percent. Improvements in the investment climate 
earned STP a spot among the top-ten worldwide reformers in the 2012 Doing Business Report 
(DBR) and a spot in the top 50 worldwide reformers from 2005-2013 in the 2013 DBR.  

Revised CAS Goal 1(iv): Strengthen the financial system  

27. 
A Public Expenditure Management and Financial Accountability Review, and a Country 
Integrated Fiduciary Assessment 61 were both completed in 2007, and two Public Expenditure 
and Financial Accountability (PEFA) reviews, conducted in 2007 and 2010, have provided short

term recommendations which have been implemented by the Authorities with the support of the 
holistic program by DPs. WBG, through the several DPOs, supported (i) a prudent management 
of oil signature bonuses combined with careful control of spending which has allowed the 
Authorities to reduce the domestic primary balance, (ii) creation of a single database with 
information on all government employees, and (iii) full implementation of a sophisticated SAFE-
e software system with modules on human resources and wage management and integration to 
the treasury, budget, and public accounts.  

B. Progress on Strategic Objective II: Strengthen Governance, Public Institutions and 
Human Capital 

28. 
The CAS/ISN development goals under the second strategic objective are: (i) strengthen 
transparency and accountability of budgetary operations and improve payroll management; (ii) 
increase transparency and accountability of upcoming petroleum revenues; (iii) develop human 
resources and access to basic social services; (iv) create strategies and information to allow 
measuring success; and (v) strengthen environment protection and resilience. Seventeen of the 
18 results indicators under the revised CAS/ISN strategic objective have been achieved; one was 
not achieved. 

Revised CAS Goal 2(i): Strengthen transparency and accountability of budgetary operations 
and improve payroll management 

29. 
Throughout the CAS/ISN period, the program of good governance in STP has yielded 
extraordinary results. Transparency and accountability 
introduced by 
the oil revenue 
management law in 2004 paved the way for a gradual strengthening of the public sector with 
significantly improved budget, natural resource management, fiscal and debt management, 
national statistics management, and the investment climate. Sustainable fiscal stance has also 
improved through fiscal adjustment underpinned by public administration reform and the 
reduction of the state’s role in commercial activities. Since 2010, the general budget has been 
published in the Government website. For the first time in 2012, the Government prepared a 
Citizen’s Budget (for the 2013 fiscal year) which summarizes key information on budget 
aggregates and explains it in a simple and didactic language so that it can be easily understood 
by the general population. The Citizen’s Budget is expected to be approved by the Council of 
Ministers and published in the Government’s website 62. Progress has also been made regarding 
the comprehensiveness of budget documents, in particular the 2013 Budget Proposal, which now 
includes an explanation of how the budget will be financed, including a summary of the level 
and composition of the debt stock and information about debt servicing.  

30. 
Such remarkable progress has not gone unnoticed by the international community. In 
2012, Transparency International’s Corruption Perception Index 63 ranked STP 72nd in the world, 
together with Italy and just below South Africa. That is a jump of 28 positions; the previous year 
the country was ranked 100th. STP was the third-strongest reformer in the world in the Open 
Budget Index due to substantial reforms in the area of budget transparency and accountability:

STP improved its OBI score from 0 to 29, out of 100, jumping 25 places to rank 62nd in the 
world. Improvements in the investment climate earned STP a spot among the top-ten worldwide 
reformers in the 2012 Doing Business (DB) report, and a spot in the top 50 worldwide reformers 
from 2005-2013 in the 2013 DB report; STP also became the world’s top reformer in terms of 
business freedom in the 2012 Heritage Foundation's Index of Economic Freedom. This is a clear 
result of the reform program supported by the World Bank Group during the CAS/ISN period. 

Revised CAS Goal 2(ii): Increase transparency and accountability of upcoming petroleum 
revenues 

31. Much progress has been made regarding transparency and accountability related to 
petroleum revenues during the CAS/ISN period. The Organic Law on Petroleum Operations 
(2009) has been approved as the principal legislation to guide the granting of licenses for the 
exploration and extraction of oil in STP. The Oil Revenue Law (2004), which guides the 
management of oil revenues, established the National Oil Account (NOA), into which all oil-
related revenues are to be deposited. It sets a limit of 20 percent of the balance of the preceding 
year to fund the Government budget. Once oil production starts, the bulk of the current revenues 
are to be transferred into a sub-account of the NOA - the Permanent Fund of STP. These 
resources are to be invested with a view to generating a permanent income stream for the NOA. 
To date, STP oil revenues have been limited signature bonuses for a total of US$87.9 million, 
equivalent to 30 percent of GDP since 2005, from the issuance of prospecting licenses in the 
Joint Development Zone (JDZ), resource sharing between Nigeria (60 percent) and STP (40 
percent) in 2005 and 2007, as well as in the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) in 2011 and 2012. 

32. 
Through the JDZ, STP became an EITI candidate country in February 2008 but the JDZ 
EITI Report could not be produced due to coordination issues with Nigeria. As a result, the EITI 
Board delisted STP from the EITI in April 2010, while Nigeria was granted “near compliant” 
status in October 2010. STP was encouraged to reapply once circumstances for rapid 
implementation were more favorable, and it could demonstrate a renewed commitment by 
providing a clear outline of how it had corrected previous barriers to effective implementation.64 
The Government is committed to transparency and accountability and took the following steps to 
reapply for EITI candidacy: (i) it issued an unequivocal public statement of its intention to 
implement the EITI; (ii) it expressed its commitment to work with civil society and companies 
on the implementation of the EITI; (iii) it appointed a high ranking official to lead the EITI 
implementation; (iv) it restructured the EITI National Committee 65 and (v) it agreed and 

64 The previous barriers included absence of a clear commitment from the Government with EITI, including (i) 
absence of financial support, and (ii) insufficient engagement by the coordinator in the process. The Government has 
addressed these issues as follows: (i) a dedicated budget line was introduced in the national budget; (ii) an office 
space and meeting facilities have been assigned for EITI at the Ministry of Finance; (iii) the STP-EITI has been 
placed within the Ministry of Finance and the Minister of Finance has been appointed EITI Champion who will lead 
the implementation of the Initiative; and (iv) the STP representatives to the JDZ Tripartite Subcommittee have been 
appointed. In addition, a Permanent EITI Secretary was appointed - a private consultant - currently financed by the 
World Bank, who has been actively involved in the process. 
65 The STP-EITI National Committee consists of three representatives from the Government (Ministry of Finance, 
Treasury and National Petroleum Agency); three representatives from civil society (NGO WEBETO, Women 
Lawyers’ Association, and Federation of NGOs); the Chamber of Commerce, Industry and Agriculture; one 

55  

 
 
 
                                                        
 
published a fully costed Work Plan containing measurable targets, and a timetable for 
implementation. The Government applied for candidacy in September 11, 2012 and was 
accepted as candidate country by the EITI Board at its meeting in Lusaka on October 26, 2012. 
STP is expected to become an EITI Compliant Country by April 2015. 

Revised CAS Goal 2(iii): Develop human resources and access to basic social services 

33. 
The Social Sector Support Project (P075979) and the Social Sector Support Project 
Additional Financing (P113113) made significant contributions to improving the access of 
basic services for the STP population. Important improvements in the health sector in STP can be 
attributed to these operations which contributed to building, equipping and making functional a 
number of health centers in remote districts, by training health personnel, and by supporting 
capacity development of the Ministry of Health. Amongst the indicators for the project are: 
immunization rate for measles, the proportion of pregnant women receiving antenatal care, and 
the proportion of births attended by qualified birth attendants. Comprehensive donor 
coordination, partnership, and complementary interventions contributed to progress in the sector 
indicators.  

Revised CAS Goal 2(iv): Create strategies and information to allow measuring success 

34. 
The Government has seen the impact of measuring success as recognized by the 
international community but it remains a challenge for the Authorities. Despite the WBG’s and 
other DPs’ support to the Government in strengthening the monitoring and evaluation (M&E) 
capacity of the National Statistics Institute (Instituto Nacional de Estatistica - INE) effective 
monitoring of poverty indicators continue to be a challenge for the Authorities. In 2006, a Trust 
Fund Grant for Statistical Capacity Building (TF056928, US$160,000) was provided to the INE 
to support the development of a National Strategy for the Development for Statistics (NSDS) and 
improvement of the statistical capacity in the country. TA was provided by the UN and AfDB in 
preparation of the PRSP-II; nonetheless, there were considerable delays on the production and 
analysis of the 2010 household survey and completion of the poverty profile. Updates and 
disaggregation of the data based on gender, age, geography (rural and urban), and socioeconomic 
status remain to be done. A strategic action plan to strengthen statistical sector capacity needs to 
be designed, funded and implemented.  

35. 
Based on the experience of PRSP-I and given the inherent constraints on resources, the 
JSAN66 for the PRSP-II recommended including concrete policy prescriptions in the 
forthcoming Priority Action Plan (PAP) linking specific PRSP-II goals with quantifiable - to the 
extent possible - and easy-to-monitor indicators. Support for the statistics and M&E tools and 
mechanisms should continue to be a priority for the Bank team.

Revised CAS Goal 2(v): Strengthen environment protection and resilience 

36. 
Erosion and flooding exacerbated by climate change and sand removal for the 
construction industry have had a severe and negative impact on coastal infrastructure, tourism 
and housing. The Global Environment Fund - Adaptation to Climate Project together with a 
national study on climate change trends and future forecasts financed by the European Space 
Agency (which has been completed) address the damage being inflicted upon the vulnerable 
coastal communities. Community disaster prevention teams have been training communities 
throughout the country on readiness and mitigation measures. This needs to be accompanied by a 
climate-resilient coastal policy and stronger 
integrated planning 
taking 
into account 
environmental and climate risk. To reduce the vulnerability of the most affected – coastal 
communities and fishers – a reinforced early warning and safety-at-sea system will be 
introduced, in conjunction with improved community-based management of coastal areas. IDA 
would draw upon its comparative global expertise in other SIDS (particularly in the Pacific and 
Caribbean regions) and coastal areas of Africa to help the STP Government address these vital 
challenges. STP would be supported through, inter alia, a US$4.1 million GEF Least Developed 
Country Fund and complementary analytical work (e.g., TFESSD-funded Adaptation to Climate 
Change on the Coast of Sao Tome) , as well as inputs to other Bank operations aimed at 
mainstreaming environmental and climate resilience into the Bank’s portfolio. In addition, it 
would also help strengthen public and private sector awareness of international standards and 
technical regulations. 

III. BANK’S PERFROMANCE IN DESIGNING AND MANAGING THE 
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROGRAM AND MANAGAING RISKS 

37. World Bank performance is rated satisfactory. The CAS/ISN was relevant and aligned 
with the Government’s PRSP-I, and the design and implementation of the Bank program 
contributed to the achievement of most CAS/ISN outcomes. The Bank performance rating is 
justified given the efforts made by Bank staff to address the emergencies confronted by STP 
during the period which helped mitigate the effects of the problems resulting from the economic 
downturn. The CAS/ISN achievements surpassed expectations and were demonstrated by STP’s 
remarkable progress in a number of international rankings. In 2012, STP was the third-strongest 
reformer in the world in the Open Budget Index (OBI) thanks to substantial reforms in the area 
of budget transparency and accountability: STP improved its OBI score from 0 to 29, out of 100, 
jumping 25 places to rank 62nd in the world. STP became the world’s top reformer in terms of 
business freedom in the 2012 Heritage Foundation's Index of Economic Freedom and jumped 28 
positions, from 100th place to 72nd in the world on Transparency International’s Corruption 
Perception Index, well above the average for the Sub-Saharan Africa region.  

38. 
The success achieved owes much to the fact that the CAS/ISN built upon the previous 
strategies by enhancing and deepening a selective program. The CAS/ISN was aligned with the 
priorities of the Government and thus had local ownership. The CAS/ISN included a 
combination of strong knowledge products, budget support and regional integration investment 
lending which has shown to be an effective approach to addressing structural reforms in this 
insular nation. 

57  

 
 
 
 
 
39. 
The risks identified in the CAS related mostly with the complexity and management of 
future oil revenues; it did not fully recognize the length of time it would talk for the industry to 
develop the sector. The urgency in developing a framework for the management of oil revenues 
was beneficial for the strategy expediting the development of an accountability and transparency 
framework regardless of the political divisions within the country. The CAS focused on 
supporting the country’s basic needs through a comprehensive set of knowledge and lending 
products. These contributed to significant achievements in improving the accountability, 
effectiveness, and level of public resources; and strengthening governance in the petroleum 
sector while maintaining a stable macroeconomic environment. Support to the social sector has 
been contributing to improving the delivery of basic health and education services with a focus 
on greater and equitable access, better quality, and improved local governance of services.   

40. 
The World Bank team was able to respond to risks to the program through a series of 
knowledge and lending programs that build upon each other. Starting in 2007 with an Integrated 
Fiduciary Assessment (IFA), the first of its kind for STP, the Bank combined the analysis and 
policy recommendations from a public expenditure review (PER), a country financial 
accountability assessment (CFAA), and a country procurement assessment review (CPAR). The 
goal was to identify the major challenges facing the country in the pre-petroleum era in public 
finance management (including public enterprises) as part of the implementation of the PRSP 
with a tight resource envelope. The evaluation took in consideration economic developments and 
fiscal sustainability analysis vis-à-vis petroleum and non-petroleum scenarios, with 
corresponding analysis on which of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) are reachable. 
The IFA reported on revenue and expenditure performance from 2001-2007, highlighting issues 
related to the implementation of the public investment program (PIP) and its coordination with 
the PRSP, and the budget process, including findings from the Health PER, which highlights a 
lack of allocative efficiency. It also reported on the financial fragility of state-owned enterprises 
(SOEs) and the possible fiscal consequences for the central budget, especially regarding the 
implicit subsidies and tax breaks to (and the hypothetical tariff increases of) the electricity and 
water company. The Public finance management system (budget preparation, execution, control, 
governance, and human resources) was also reviewed as well as the reform process to address 
many of the concerns it raises.  

41. 
In 2008/09 STP was hit hard by the increases in international food and fuel prices and 
was affected by the global economic downturn through lower-than-expected tourism receipts and 
donor assistance, lower remittances, and postponement of FDI. The Bank responded with a US$2 
million supplemental financing for the Public & Natural Resources Management DPO with 
funds provided under the IDA Financial Crisis Response Fast Track Facility (FCR FTF) to 
continue with budget support while promoting transparency and accountability in the 
management of public resources. 

42. 
The Governance Capacity Building Technical Assistance (CBTA) project (US$5 million) 
from FY05-10 supported reforms in public finance management, procurement, petroleum 
management, all of which helped build the basic public financial management systems. The 
biggest achievement for the GCBTA was support to the Government to create an institutional 
and legal framework to formulate policies, supervise, and regulate the petroleum sector, and 
support to public financial management by developing the legal framework for public accounting 

58  

 
 
 
and build capacity to prepare the public accounts of the State. GCBTA closed in September 2010 
and was rated Moderately Satisfactory on its overall performance. 

43. 
The Public and Natural Resource Management Development (PNRMD) DPO (US$6 
million), approved in 2008, supported the introduction of modern techniques and approaches in 
PFM, and aimed at developing mechanisms to ensure that the benefits of future oil extraction 
materialize optimally within standards of good governance. This operation benefited from 
supplemental financing (US$2 million), approved in 2010, from IDA’s Crisis Response Window 
to minimize the risks of the 2009 global financial crisis. PNRMD closed in June 2010 and was 
rated Moderately Satisfactory on its overall performance.  

44. 
The Public Resource Management and Governance (PRMG) development policy 
operation (US$4.2 million), approved in May 2011, aimed to raise transparency in public 
expenditures, improve the management and reporting of public accounts, promote fiscal 
sustainability, strengthen debt management, and strengthen donor coordination. PRMG closed in 
February 2012 and was rated Satisfactory on its overall performance.  

45. 
The Social Sector Support Project (SSSP, (US$8.6 million), approved in 2004, aimed at 
increasing access and equity of the rural population to health services; improving the quality of 
those services; and contributing to support for the national program to fight HIV/AIDS and 
malaria. They included rehabilitation, construction and equipment of health centers in the 
districts to increase coverage; strengthening the institutional capacity of the Ministry of Health 
and training of health staff in order to improve quality of services; and institutional support to the 
National Programs to Fight HIV/AIDS and Malaria and provision of condoms, and some drugs 
and testing kits for HIV and malaria. The Original Financing also included Community-Driven 
Initiatives (CDI) promoted by NGOs. In 2010, SSSP was extended to support the health sector to 
consolidate the gains obtained with the Original Financing, while support to the education sector 
was pursued through the Global Partnership for Education (GPE) Fund. The Supplemental 
Financing supported institutional strengthening of health institutions at the central and local 
levels. Thus, main activities included building residences for health staff in remote areas in order 
to attract skilled staff and to improve service delivery; continuing the program of rehabilitation, 
expansion and equipment of health centers, including the National Center for Endemic Diseases 
(CNE, the Government department responsible for malaria and HIV/AIDS programs); and 
training and capacity development of the Ministry of Health. The Additional Financing also 
continued to support CDI promoted by NGOs in the area of health through supplemental 
financing because of the need to provide critical budgetary support to facilitate the continuation 
of the reform process. The SSSP closed on December 31, 2012 and the completion report is 
under preparation. The team expects that the SSSP would be rated Moderately Satisfactory on its 
overall performance. 

46. 
The Central Africa Backbone (CAB2) Adjustable Program Lending 2 (US$14.9 million) 
was approved in 2011. As of March 2013 CAB2 has disbursed 93 percent of the total - with all 
payments to the ACE consortium now completed. The ACE submarine cable landed in the 
country in November 2012 and was commercially launched in February 2012. Within a little 
over a month of operation the use of capacity went up five times (from 50 to 250 Mbs), and 
given the current cable capacity it can still increase 18 time more before requiring an upgrade of 

59  

 
 
 
 
the international cable capacity. Average prices are already coming down (the operator is 
offering four to eight times more capacity for the same price). The most recent Implementation 
Status Report rates the project Satisfactory on its overall performance.  

47. 
The Adaptation to Climate Project financed from the Global Environment Fund (GEF) 
sources (US$4.1 million) was approved in 2011. This operation is crucial for STP to provide 
strengthened capacity and financing to address erosion and flooding which are affecting coastal 
infrastructure, tourism and housing and developing an early warning system to disseminate 
timely warnings to artisanal fishers prior to fog/storm events. The last ISR indicated that the 
project implementation is Moderately Satisfactory due to delays in the Coastal Protection for 
Vulnerable Communities and Coastal Early Warning and Safety at Sea components. Regular and 
detailed monitoring of the project indicators needs strengthening. 

48. 
Selectivity and coordination have been cornerstones of the CAS. All of the IDA country 
allocation funded the DPOs, focusing on macroeconomic stability, and increasing the 
transparency and accountability within the public sector. Since 2008, when IFC started 
supporting STP, the focus has been on improving the business climate in order to attract FDI. 

49. 
Risks related to the extensive influx of oil signature bonuses were avoided since the large 
revenues from the sector have not yet materialized. The CAS anticipated the country’s 
vulnerabilities to external shocks such as the effect of the world economic downturn, and in 
response the Bank adjusted its assistance program. A mid-term review was not carried out. In 
reality, the external conditions and frequent internal changes made such a review difficult. Also, 
a mid-term revision of activities would have been time-consuming and difficult to justify given 
the length of the CAS period. 

IV. KEY LESSONS AND SUGGESTIONS FOR THE NEW CPS 

50. 
The lessons drawn from the review of the CAS/ISN and recommendations for the future 
CAS are summarized below. 

• 

• Broad-based macroeconomic support is needed for successful CAS implementation. The 
Bank’s successful support to STP was anchored on macroeconomic and development 
strategies based on pre-established strategies, such as Policy Development Operations. 
Such an instrument provides structure and mitigates political instability of frequent 
changes in priorities in the Government. 
Innovation and combination of resources into a holistic program focus on strengthening 
governance and competitiveness has been the cornerstone for the success of the WBG 
program in STP, a small island state with limited capacity as it prepares to meet the 
challenges of an emerging oil sector.  
• A multi-stakeholder approach provided an interconnected program supporting knowledge 
and TA through the integration of unique contributions of the IMF, EITI, AfDB, EU and 
other bilateral development partners. For instance, the AfDB teamed-up with the Bank to 
provide TA in support of a set of joint objectives, while the Bank’s team collaborated 
very closely with UNDP and EU to ensure full harmonization of objectives and activities

• 

and support the Government in the preparation of a new Poverty Reduction Strategy 
Paper. 
IDA should continue to build on recent success and gains on strengthening transparency 
and accountability on the public and petroleum sectors. IDA support to the Government 
has been crucial to strengthen their ability to focus on economic stability and 
strengthening of institutions to address the country’s development challenges and 
eliminate constrains in preparation for the time when the oil revenues would materialize. 
• The World Bank Group’s (IDA and IFC) close coordination during the CAS/ISN period 
led to extraordinary achievements in STP as described above. Such close coordination 
should continue in the next strategy. 
• To date, STP has been highly dependent on the support of the DPs which have 
contributed annually between 85 to 93 percent of the country’s capital budget. The 
absence of the STP Authorities in donor coordination indicates dispersed aid and efforts 
leading to meager results. In December 2011 the Government convened the first Donors’ 
Meeting but no concrete action plan was proposed during the meeting and the DPs left 
without making pledges of coordination and support. Strengthening the Authorities’ 
ability to lead the coordination and integration of DPs’ programs would be recommended 
for the next CAS period.  
• There are very few people in STP familiar with Bank procedures. Having a common 
fiduciary staff (Financial Management, Procurement and Accounting) to serve several 
Project Implementation Units within the Ministry of Finance would enhance the 
consistency and improve/facilitate implementation progress.  
• Make CAS periods longer and allow flexibility in the program. The CAS four years were 
too short a period to show meaningful results; in fact, the extension of the CAS via the 
ISN allowed for completion of the program leading to satisfactory results. Considering 
that it is difficult to carry out mid-term reviews within a short time frame; a longer CAS 
period (say five years) would permit a mid-term evaluation. Experience in STP shows the 
importance of building flexibility in the program to permit adjustments when 
unpredictable situations, which affect outcomes, occur. 
• Given the encouraging results of the SSSP and further support of the Global Partnership 
for Education, it would be important to keep in the next CAS not only policy dialogue but 
also, if possible, additional financial support to the social sectors, therefore, consolidating 
current gains.  

V. CONCLUSION 

51. 
The WBG’s support to STP’s poverty reduction strategy led to extraordinary outcomes 
within challenging circumstances. Whether STP follows in the footsteps of other small states that 
have harnessed their natural-resource potential to achieve rapid, sustained and broad-based 
growth, or whether it will succumb to the devastating and all-too-familiar consequences of the 
resource curse, will depend on the Government’s efficiency in implementing ambitious structural 
reforms and develop the institutional strength and administrative capacity to effectively manage 
a thriving oil sector and withstand the corrupting influence of resource revenues.

 1. 
Annex 6: São Tomé and Príncipe: Financial Management and Procurement Systems 
Laws and regulations provide an enabling framework for effective public financial 
management (PFM). The 2007 SAFE Law adopted a chart of accounts employing double-entry 
accounting, which permits a more homogeneous and transparent recording of financial 
transactions, facilitating the analysis of outcomes. Corporate and personal income tax codes were 
revised in 2009 to harmonize taxation between enterprises and individuals, simplified the rate 
structure, and strengthened tax assessment. The Public Debt Management Law specifies the 
processes and procedures for contracting new public debt. These legislations were followed by 
elaboration of the chart of accounts, preparation and dissemination of a public accounting 
manual and a manual of operations for the management of assets, and approval of steps towards 
preparation of the Government financial statements. The public procurement legal framework 
has been significantly modernized following the approval, in March 2009, of the Decree-Law nr. 
3/2009 and the Law nr. 8/2009, of 26 August 2009 that set up the new legal framework for 
public works contracts and acquisition of goods and services by the Government. Its scope 
covers central government entities, public institutes, national agencies, public enterprises, local 
authorities, and the autonomous region of Príncipe. The new legal regime requires that 
procurement should be ruled by the principles of economy, efficiency, transparency and 
publicity. It defines open competition as the preferred method for all procurement, requiring that 
its non-utilization should be the subject of proper justification. 

2. 
Public fiduciary institutions have been created not so long ago. The systems of 
financial recording, accounting, and reporting of public resources have been considerably 
strengthened under the Government reform program supported by development partners. In 2009 
the Government created the institutions required to prepare the public accounts, notably the 
Public Accounting Directorate (PAD) and the Public Assets Management Directorate. Since 
2010, both institutions are operational with appropriate budget, personnel allocations, and 
equipment. PFM improvements, as a result, include consultative preparation of State budget 
within sectoral ceilings and enhanced comprehensiveness, public disclosure of State budget, 
enhanced tracking of pro-poor expenditures, a comprehensive inventory of existing mobile 
public assets (including vehicles) covering all sector ministries, and implementation of 
government IFMIS (SAFE-e). The new public procurement legal framework also created an 
independent entity (COSSIL – Gabinete de Coordenação e Seguimento do Sistema de Licitações) 
to regulate the process of procurement, responsible, amongst other things, for the definition of 
procurement policies/procedures, for an integrated management of data and information, for 
approval of bidding documents and validation of Evaluation Reports, and for periodic audits of 
procurement processes. Under this legal framework, the responsibility for procurement 
management rests with the spending ministries, through the Unidades de Gestão de Licitações 
(UGEL – Procurement Management Units) within Direccao Administrativa Financeira (DAF – 
Financial Administrative Direction). At the same time, the law created a non-judicial Conflict 
Resolution Commission under the responsibility of the Prime Minister’s Office, responsible for 
assessing the complaints and appeals submitted during public procurement processes. 

3. 
However, the process of PFM reform is still at an early stage and it will take time 
and further support to reap the benefits. Overall, the 2009 Public Expenditure and Financial 

66  

 
 
 
Accountability (PEFA) scores were low. The majority of processes were graded with a “D”, and 
five processes received a grade of “B” or above (compared to only three processes in the 2008 
PEFA out of a total of 28 processes). There has been a modest improvement in eight PEFA 
indicators between 2008 and 2009, with regard to comprehensiveness and transparency of public 
finances, and on the predictability and control of budget execution. A PEFA update (2013) is 
being finalized and draft results indicate improvements in 18 PEFA indicators, whereas only one 
indicator showed a negative trend. Nevertheless, the lack of public accounts makes it difficult to 
conduct macroeconomic and public financial analyses and, more importantly, hinders effective 
internal and external fiduciary control and legislative scrutiny. The 2013 PEFA public 
procurement indicator (PI-19) has an overall C+ score, with the highest score a B on the open 
competition sub-indicator (i), and two Cs on (ii) use of less competitive procurement and (iii) the 
complaints mechanism, which is the same score as the 2009 PEFA, indicating no significant 
progress Implementation and enhanced ownership of the new legal framework will gradually 
improve performance. However, poor practices like the non-formal appointment of the members 
of the Conflict Resolution Commission point towards a lack of robustness leading to the overall 
C+ P-19 PEFA indicator. In addition, general capacity constraints at central level institutions as 
well as in the Procurement Management Units at sector level hamper good public procurement 
system performance. A procurement performance indicator on competitiveness is proposed in the 
results framework. 

4. 
The Bank program in STP will continue to support consolidation of remaining areas 
of PFM, particularly strengthening fiscal discipline through implementation of medium-term 
debt management strategy and legislation, preparation and auditing of State annual financial 
statements, and enhancing capacity for legislative scrutiny through targeted PFM training/ 
seminar for parliamentarians. The CPS also proposes to have one enhanced PIU with fiduciary 
staff (for Financial Management, Procurement and Accounting) to support implementation of 
Bank-financed projects within the Ministry of Planning and Finance, with dedicated project staff 
working with the PIU.
