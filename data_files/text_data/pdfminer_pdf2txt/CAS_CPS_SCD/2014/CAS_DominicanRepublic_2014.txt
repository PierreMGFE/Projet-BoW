EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
i. 
Over the past two decades, the Dominican Republic has recorded exceptional growth (an 
average growth rate of 5.7 percent per year during 1991-2013) in comparison to the Latin 
America and Caribbean region, closing the gap with the region in terms of GNI per capita.  
However, despite such high growth, poverty and unemployment have remained high since the 
2003 crisis. Trends in inequality and non-monetary poverty have improved but progress on 
shared prosperity has been slower than in the rest of the region. In addition, the DR has 
witnessed little upward economic mobility. Poverty is significantly higher in rural areas, 
although it is also increasingly becoming an urban problem. Income inequality and inequality of 
opportunities place women at a greater disadvantage than men.  
ii. 
Against the backdrop of a less favorable external environment and decreasing 
competitiveness, the Dominican Republic now faces the double challenge of sustaining growth 
and making it more inclusive and resilient. Based on Bank analysis, factors that limit further 
improvement in shared prosperity can be grouped around five categories: (i) the existence of an 
“enclave” economic model with insufficient job creation in key sectors (especially as the 
composition of the economy shifted from agriculture and industry towards the services sector); 
(ii) unfavorable climate for doing business, including limited access to finance, costly and 
unreliable electricity supply and insufficient ICT penetration (which disproportionately affects 
micro, small and medium sized enterprises, where most jobs are); (iii) high vulnerability to 
economic and climate related shocks; (iv) public finance management and fiscal challenges, 
limiting the ability of the state to redistribute income; (v) inequities in access to basic public and 
social services (in particular in sectors such as water and sanitation, education, health, and social 
protection). 
iii. 
The overall strategic goal of the CPS for FY15-18 is to support the Government’s efforts 
to sustain growth and make it more inclusive. The CPS is organized around five strategic results 
areas over the next four years: (i) improving the investment climate and fostering private sector 
development; (ii) improving access to efficient and reliable electrical distribution networks, ICT 
and other infrastructure; (iii) supporting the government in building resilience to external shocks; 
(iv) promoting equitable, efficient, transparent and sustainable management of public resources; 
and, (v) strengthening social service delivery.  
iv. 
The proposed CPS is informed by lessons learned from the previous Country Partnership 
Strategy (FY09-13) and by extensive strategic consultations. It is aligned with the World Bank 
Group’s (WBG) twin goals of ending extreme poverty and boosting shared prosperity and the 
Government’s development priorities as established in the National Development Strategy. It 
applies a systematic filtering process reflecting Government ownership, the WBG’s value-added, 
and potential impact on poverty reduction and shared prosperity, as identified in the Bank’s 
background analyses. In selected areas, such as the eradication of water borne diseases on the 
island, the WBG will endeavor to promote enhanced coordination with Haiti. In line with the 
new World Bank Strategy, work initiated in the Dominican Republic (DR) on citizen 
engagement will be actively sustained, and gender and governance considerations, which are 
critical for WBG engagement, will be mainstreamed in all activities. 
v. 
Finally, the CPS outlines mitigating measures to contain the substantial political, 
capacity, exposure, and natural disasters risks to the program. With elections coming up in the 
spring of 2016, political economy factors could slow down implementation of reforms. Weak 

vii 

technical capacity, budgetary constraints and complex procedures for project restructuring can 
also affect the implementation of WBG-supported projects. Structural domestic challenges and 
weaknesses on the external side pose a significant risk to the Bank’s ability to achieve results, 
while exposure to looming climate variability and climate-related natural disasters could also set 
the country back. The WBG will: (i) invest in knowledge services to support reforms and seek 
partnerships with champions in Government and a wide range of actors in the private sector, civil 
society and the donor community and seek to engage in investments that change local views 
about the potential for development in key areas; (ii) align its program closely with core 
Government priorities; (iii) support key reforms aimed at improving fiscal performance, equity 
outcomes associated with public spending, greater energy efficiency, and better debt 
management; and (iv) support enhanced DRM practices in the country, as well as apply strong 
DRM practices to the investments the WBG will support. In case of a major disaster, the Bank 
would make available emergency lending within the overall envelope by reallocating resources.

COUNTRY DIAGNOSTIC 

I. 

Growth, Poverty and Shared Prosperity 

1. 
The Dominican Republic has recorded exceptional growth in comparison to the 
Latin America and Caribbean region, closing the gap with the region over the past twenty 
years (Table 1). Between 1992 and 2000, the Dominican Republic (DR) grew at an average rate 
of 6.7 percent, thus becoming the top performer in the Latin America and Caribbean (LCR) 
region. Between 2001 and 2013, the DR grew at an average rate of 5.1 percent, the fourth top 
growth performer after Panama, Argentina and Peru. Overall, over 1991-2013, the DR grew at an 
average annual growth rate of 5.7 percent. This overall dynamic growth has enabled some 
convergence of the DR’s GNI per capita (US$5,620 in 2013 1) with that of the region, from 52 
percent to 78 percent of the regional average during 1990-2011. While in the mid-1990s, the 
DR’s per capita income was only about 10 percent of that of the US, it had climbed to around 20 
percent as of 2011. The country weathered the global economic slowdown of 2008-09 well, 
applying counter-cyclical policies including an expansion of its safety nets with donor support. 
However, declining domestic demand and weak performance in richer economies has 
contributed to slower growth since 2011 (growth fell from 7.8 percent in 2010 to 4.1 percent in 
2013). 
2. 
Despite such high growth, poverty and unemployment have remained high since the 
2003-04 crisis. In the wake of the banking crisis of 2003-04, the Dominican economy 
decelerated abruptly and the country’s GDP that had grown by 6 percent in 2003 contracted by 
0.3 percent in 2004. As a result, an estimated 1.7 million people moved into poverty, which 
reached 50 percent of the population in 2004 (up from 32 percent in 2000). According to national 
figures, while poverty rates began to fall when the economy started recovering after the crisis, 
they have not returned to their pre-crisis level (Figure 1) 2, despite the DR’s strong economic 
performance. Evidence of decline in moderate poverty (from 11 percent in 2000 to 9.9 percent in 
2010) and extreme poverty (from 5.2 to 2.2 percent) is also seen when using the  poverty 
headcount ratio at $1.25 and $2 a day (PPP), respectively, which corresponds to applying lower 
thresholds than those normally used in LCR. 3 The extended unemployment rate increased from 
13.9 percent in 2000 to 18.4 percent in 2004 and declined to 14.1 percent in 2008. Since then, it 
has remained stable between 14 and 15 percent. 
3. 
Trends in inequality and non-monetary poverty have improved but progress on 
shared prosperity has been slower than in the rest of the LCR region. The Gini coefficient 
has been falling slightly since 2000 (from 0.51 in 2000 to 0.48 in 2011), and multi-dimensional 
poverty, defined as the percentage of the population with more than three unmet basic needs, 
decreased from 29.5 percent in 2000 to 19.8 percent in 2011.  However, the increase in the

3 World Bank, World Development Indicators. Please, note that in Latin America and the Caribbean, the thresholds 
usually adopted for extreme and moderate poverty are $2.5 and $4 a day (PPP), respectively. Under these thresholds, 
the extreme and moderate poverty rates for DR in 2010 would be 16.1 percent and 35.1 percent respectively. See 
CEDLAS and the Economic Mobility and the Rise of the Latin American Middle Class Flagship Report of the LCR 
Chief Economist office, 2012.

proportion of people who are considered transitory poor (i.e., people with low incomes but not 
multi-dimensionally poor), which almost doubled from 15 to 29 percent over the same period, 
raises concerns about whether access to basic services translates sufficiently into higher 
employability and incomes. In addition, while there has been some progress in terms of shared 
prosperity with an increase of roughly 2.5 percent per year in the incomes of the bottom 40 
percent of the population between 2003 and 2012, this is below the LCR average of 5 percent per 
year over the same period (Figure 2).

Source: MEPYD estimates based on ENFT, using the official poverty measurement 
methodology for the DR, and World Development Indicators.  
Note: these figures were calculated on the basis of the official poverty methodology, which 
defines four poverty lines: (1) urban moderate poverty (RD$3,238); (2) rural moderate 
poverty (RD$2,883); (3) urban extreme poverty (RD$1,458); and (4) rural extreme poverty 
(RD$1,397). Values are in Dominican pesos of June 2007, updated annually using the CPI. 
All numbers are identical to those officially published by the Poverty Committee. 

4. 
In addition, the DR has witnessed 
little upward economic mobility, and 
opportunities are still constrained by circumstances at birth. The Human Opportunity Index 
(HOI) has gradually improved over time (at a 
FIGURE 2: INCOME GROWTH OF 
rate of 1 percent per year), implying that, if 
BOTTOM 40 PERCENT (DR VS. LCR) 
current trends are sustained, it would take 
almost 30 years to equalize opportunities for 
Dominicans, longer than the average of 24 
years for LCR. In terms of inter-generational 
income mobility, while 41.4 percent of people 
rose to a higher economic group in the region, 
only 1.8 percent did so in the DR. More than 
three-quarters 
of 
the 
inequality 
in 
opportunities is explained by area of residence 
(26 percent), parents’ education (26 percent), 
family income (20 percent), and gender (15 
percent), underscoring the need to improve 
access to welfare services and ensure equal 
opportunities for all.

Poverty is significantly higher in rural areas, although it is increasingly an urban 
problem too. Extreme poverty reached 15.5 percent in rural areas vs. 5.8 percent in urban areas 
in 2012 and overall poverty was 46 percent in rural areas vs. 26 percent in urban areas. However, 
most of the increase in poverty of the last decade has occurred in urban areas, where the number 
of poor has swelled by more than 1 million people since 2000.  At the national level, incomes per 
capita are three times higher in Santo Domingo, La Romana and the Cibao valley’s Mao-
Valverde provinces than in the southwest of the country and along the border with Haiti.  Some 
53 percent of poor households are concentrated in the southwestern regions of Del Valle and 
Enriquillo. 
6. 
Income inequality and inequality of opportunities place women at a greater 
disadvantage than men. Gender gaps in the labor market are evidenced by participation rates 
(83 percent for men vs. 55 percent for women in 2011); access to employment (young women’s 
unemployment in 2007 was twice that of young men) 4; wages (women earned 84 percent of what 
men earned in 2010), and by the lack of income sources for women (32 percent of women had no 
personal income in 2010 vs. 14 percent of men). This is in spite of the reverse situation in 
education where more girls than boys complete primary school 5, and the female-male enrolment 
ratios are high at 1.13 in secondary and 1.59 in tertiary education. Women in the DR also suffer 
from exceptionally high maternal mortality and adolescent fertility rates 6 by LCR and Upper 
Middle Income Country (UMIC) standards. Women also constitute 58 percent of persons aged 
15 or more living with HIV in the DR (Annex 14). Furthermore, female headed households 
(FHH) are more likely to be poor: 52 percent of rural FHH and 48 percent of urban FHH were 
categorized as poor in 2010, versus 38 percent in rural areas and 30 percent in urban areas for 
male headed households 7. By contrast, in terms of participation, the proportion of seats held by 
women in national parliament almost tripled from 8 percent in 1990 to 21 percent in 2011. 
7. 
In addition to poverty and shared prosperity challenges, in recent years, the DR has 
also seen its competitiveness decrease. The DR ranked 105th out of 144 countries in the 2013 
World Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Index, down from 95th out of 133 in 2010. 
Exports of goods and services have fallen from 37 percent of GDP in 2000 to 26 percent in 2013, 
primarily due to the loss of competitiveness in textiles manufacturing in Export Processing 
Zones (EPZs) after 2004, in the context of the end of the Multi-Fiber Agreement 8. While these 
are gradually being replaced by more skill-intensive exports of machine parts, plastics, and 
medical instruments, EPZs still face a series of challenges in terms of competitiveness. 9 A 
similar stagnation and decline in the general ease of doing business in the country since 2008-09 
has been captured by the annual Doing Business reports. The reports highlight complex and 
expensive regulatory procedures and weak legal institutions. According to both the Doing 

4 However, there has been a 10 percentage point increase in the percentage of women in non-agriculture 
employment from 32 percent in 1990 to 42 percent in 2011.  
5 About 82 percent of women aged 15 to 19 had completed primary education by 2011, vs. 72 percent of men 
6 There were 107 births per 1,000 women aged 15-19 (2010), which is 50 percent higher than the LCR average (69) 
and well above the average for Upper Middle Income Countries (43).

8 The Multi Fibre Arrangement (MFA) was introduced in 1974 as a short-term measure intended to allow developed 
countries to adjust to imports from the developing world. It governed the world trade in textiles and garments from 
1974 through January 1, 2005.  
9 These are among the preliminary findings of a Trade Competitiveness Diagnostic under preparation.

transactions such as registering property, resolving insolvency proceedings, obtaining a 
construction permit or starting a business, all above the regional average. According to the 
Global Competitiveness Index the DR ranks particularly weakly on anti-monopoly policies 
(123rd out of 144 countries) and on the prevalence of favoritism in decisions by government 
officials (ranking 144th out of 144 countries). The lack of competition has stifled innovation,10 
with the DR ranking 118th out of 144 countries in 2013, which in turn has dampened demand for 
more skilled labor, and reduced competitiveness. 
8. 
A less favorable external environment may also constrain future growth prospects. 
While stronger projected average US growth in 2014-18 will provide support to the Dominican 
economy, as will recovery in the euro zone, growth prospects in Latin America are generally 
affected by less supportive external conditions and domestic supply-side constraints. The 
recovery in advanced economies should generate positive trade spillovers to the region, but these 
are likely to be offset by lower commodity prices, tighter financial conditions, and supply 
bottlenecks in some countries. Growth in the Caribbean as a whole remains constrained by high 
debt levels and weak competitiveness. The DR’s persistent current account deficits and its large 
external financing needs (US$ 7.3 billion or 12.4 percent of GDP in 2014 for both the public and 
private sector 11) could make the economy highly exposed to exogenous shocks. International 
reserves, at an average of 2.1 months of imports during 2009-2013, have been low by 
international standards, even though bond issues have raised reserves to more than 3 months of 
imports in 2014. The most immediate risk factors include the pace of the global recovery, which 
will influence the level of tourism demand and demand for Dominican exports, including 
commodities; and, trends in oil prices, as well as sources of financing for oil, which would affect 
the DR’s financing costs. 12 In addition, the DR economy is also vulnerable to a slow-down in 
China through minerals prices. 
Overall, going forward, the DR faces the double challenge of sustaining growth and 
making it more inclusive and resilient. Despite the fact that growth in the DR has been 
stronger than in the LCR region as a whole over the last two decades, the country has been 
slipping on indicators of competitiveness, which will make it harder to sustain its growth 
performance, especially in the context of a less favorable regional environment. Moreover the 
DR has been falling behind in a number of equity dimensions. Largely as a result of the 2003-
2004 crisis, poverty rates remain higher than the regional average. The country is also 
underperforming LCR in terms of increasing access to quality public services, and, at the rate of 
improvement of the past decade, the DR would take longer to reach universal access to such 
services than LCR. Finally, upward mobility has also been more limited than in LCR.

Challenges to a More Sustainable and Equitable Growth 
10. 
The Dominican Republic faces a number of key challenges to sustain growth and 
make it more inclusive and equitable. While there are various possible explanations for the 
DR’s situation, based on Bank analysis, factors that limit sustaining growth and further 
improving shared prosperity can in general be grouped around five categories 13: (i) an “enclave” 
economic model with insufficient job creation in key sectors; (ii) an unfavorable investment 
climate, especially for SMEs, including limited access to finance, costly and unreliable 
electricity supply and insufficient ICT penetration; (iii) high vulnerability to economic and 
climate-related shocks; (iv) public finance management and fiscal challenges, limiting the ability 
of the state to redistribute income; and (v) inequities in access to basic public and social services.

Enclave economic growth 

11. 
Sectors driving economic growth recently have had limited linkages to the overall 
economy. Growth in the past decade has been driven by isolated ‘enclaves’ that have not 
generated much spill-over into the larger economy. The impressive average growth rate of 5.5 
percent per year during 1991-2013 has been largely driven by services, including tourism and 
telecommunications, as well as export processing zones (EPZs) and mining (see Box 1).  
However, none of these sectors have been successful in building significant linkages with the 
rest of the economy, thereby limiting the permeation of welfare gains to the majority of the 
population. 
12. Over the last two decades, the composition of the economy shifted from agriculture 
and industry towards the services sector. The shares of agriculture and industry in GDP 
declined from 13 percent and 35 percent to 9 and 29 percent respectively between 1992 and 
2012, while the share of services rose from 51 percent to 62 percent over the same period. EPZs 
lost some steam over the past decade following the elimination of quotas that governed world 
trade in textiles and clothing, which resulted in a drop in employment during the first half of the 
past decade. In the tourism sector, arrivals have increased to 5 million per year, although the 
average length of stays declined by 8 percent during the past decade while daily expenditures 
remained unchanged. Overall, between 2000 and 2013, services contributed on average 3 
percentage points each year to GDP growth (more than half of the recorded growth in the 
period), led by telecommunications and transportation (Figure 3). 

BOX 1: EXTRACTIVE INDUSTRIES IN THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC 

In recent years, the Dominican Republic has experienced a significant expansion of its mining sector, 
particularly Pueblo Viejo project by Barrick, which has challenged the government's institutional, technical and 
regulatory capacity. This $4 billion investment into Pueblo Viejo is the largest single foreign investment in the 
history of the Dominican Republic and is expected to provide the government with $10 billion over its 25-year 
life. Mining accounted for 29.4 percent of all FDI inflows into the Dominican Republic between 2009 and 
2013. Due in large part to Pueblo Viejo and other projects such as Falcondo (XtrataNickel), Las Lagunas 
(Panterra), Cerro Maimon (Perilya Ltd) and Las Mercedes, the mining industry grew by 157 percent in 2013, 
compared to the previous year, accounting for an estimated 6 percent of the GDP. Gold exports increased 582 
percent to US$1.19bn, contributing to the rise of the sector’s share of Dominican total exports to 30.5 percent in 
2013. Government estimates suggest that the mining sector has the potential to generate 15,000 to 20,000 direct 
jobs and 45,000 to 60,000 indirect jobs, primarily in Pueblo Viejo and Cerro Maimon. More jobs can be added 
if advanced exploration projects such as Neita (Unigold Inc.), El Romero (Gold Quest Mining Corp) and 
Pueblo Viejo Extension (Everton Resources Inc.) come to fruition. Mining in the DR continued to grow rapidly 
in the first two months of 2014, at an annual rate of 29.1 percent in January and February, faster than any other 
industry. Growth in the country's mining industry is mainly driven by the ramp-up of the Pueblo Viejo gold-
silver mine, which started commercial production in January 2013. The recent expansion of mining sector has 
put enormous strain on the Dominican Republic’s capacity to manage and monitor the sector. The DR has 
expressed interest in joining the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) but is still not a candidate. 

13. With such sector shifts, the labor market has underperformed in spite of rapid 
economic growth. Employment rates of close to 53 percent of the population in the DR are low 
compared to the LCR average (60 percent). While the “open unemployment” rate 14, at around 6 
percent during the 2000s, is not particularly high, a more comprehensive measure of 

14 Share of those without a job who are actively seeking an occupation.

unemployment that includes discouraged workers (those no longer actively seeking an 
occupation) is much higher, at 15 percent as of October 2013 and is twice as high for Dominican 
youth. 15 One important consequence of insufficient job creation over an extended period of time 
has been significant out-migration, with the Dominican diaspora swelling to over 1.5 million (or 
around 15 percent of the population), primarily in the United States and Spain. 16

Fast productivity growth in key sectors brought limited employment gains and 
rising informality. Key sectors such as manufacturing, transportation, communication, and 
financial services have experienced a sharp rise in productivity, but their contribution to total 
employment has declined; in the case of manufacturing, it has gone from 18 percent in the early 
1990s to 12 percent in 2011. By contrast, “other services” 17, which included mainly low-skilled 
jobs and some public sector jobs, accounted for 25 percent of total employment in 2012, up from 
22 percent in 2005. Commerce and tourism created almost 200,000 new jobs, while jobs were 
destroyed in manufacturing activities and their share in total employment decreased from 14.8 
percent in 2005 to 10.4 percent in 2012. Agriculture kept a stable share of 14.5 percent of total 
employment over the period. Overall, informal sector jobs grew at twice the rate of formal sector 
jobs since 2000, reaching over 57 percent of total employment in 2012, and formal sector job 
creation since 2000 has been dominated by the public sector (an estimated 80 percent), with very

Options for a Job-Rich Growth”, IMF Working Paper WP/13/40, Washington, DC. 
16 This has implications in terms of large flows of remittances that provide safety nets for Dominican families, but 
also of a higher reservation wage for recipients, and the social consequences of disarticulated families. 
17 This category contains mainly low-skilled jobs, such as housekeeping (fastest growing segment prior to 2007), but 
also captures a significant share of public sector jobs, according to an analysis by the National Private Enterprise 
Council (CONEP): “Análisis del Mercado Laboral en la República Dominicana y Lineamientos Generales hacia su 
Formalización”, June 2013.

little formal private sector job creation (a mere 4 percent increase since 2000). 18 In the 2014 
Doing Business ranking, the DR ranks 144 out of 189 countries in terms of starting a business. 
This is largely due to a very high requirement for the minimum paid-in capital for a new 
business, equivalent in value to 46 percent of GDP per capita, compared to an average of 3.6 
percent in the region. These constraints, in addition to limited access to finance, the lack of a 
simplified tax regime for SMEs, and low institutional capacity of firms, especially outside Santo 
Domingo, also contributed to the formation of a large informal sector, which not only represents 
lost fiscal revenue, but is also a source of lower quality jobs. 
15. Most of the jobs created have been of low quality in low-productivity sectors. 19 Real 
earnings started to fall at the end of the 1990s and this trend was accentuated by the banking 
crisis of 2003-04 and ensuing higher inflation. Real earnings of highly-skilled workers, which 
increased rapidly during the 1990s, suffered a sharp downward adjustment in 2003 and have not 
recovered since. Thus real private sector wages declined by 27 percent between 2000 and 2011 
in spite of rapidly rising productivity. For example, transportation, communications, and 
manufacturing recorded high rates of productivity growth while real wages in these sectors 
remained virtually stagnant, in line with the pattern observed in other sectors with much weaker 
productivity growth. 20 While it has been posited that Haitian emigration might be supplying 
unskilled labor that attenuates the effect on wages of increases in labor demand usually 
associated with high GDP growth rates, evidence to date on this hypothesis is inconclusive21.  

Unfavorable investment climate 

16. 
Doing business continues to be a challenge in the DR, especially for micro, small and 
medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs), but recent government efforts provide an opportunity 
to improve the investment climate. The DR ranked 105th out of 144 countries in the 2013 
World Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Index, down from 95th out of 133 in 2010.  A 
similar stagnation and decline in the general ease of doing business in the country since 2008-09 
has been captured by the annual Doing Business reports. The reports highlight complex and 
expensive regulatory procedures and weak legal institutions. According to both the Doing 
Business indicators and the Enterprise Surveys, the DR shows regulatory complexity in terms of

20 See Abdullaev and Estevão (2013), op. cit., for a detailed analysis of productivity and real earnings dynamics in 
the DR labor market. 
21 On the one hand, Aristy-Escuder (2008) argues that Haitian workforce is a substitute for the unskilled Dominican 
workers, resulting in a wage reduction for less-qualified jobs, whereas return to capital and wages of the skilled 
workforce have increased.  On the other hand, Mejía (2009) finds some evidence that native workers in the 
construction sector of the DR are currently more affected by unemployment than Haitians, although he does not find 
strong evidence of deterioration in sector wages provoked by the increased participation of migrants in the 
workforce. Finally, the World Bank (2012) also finds only weak evidence of downward wage pressures caused by 
Haitian workers. See Aristy-Escuder, J., 2008. “Impacto de la inmigración haitiana sobre el mercado laboral y las 
finanzas públicas de la República Dominicana”. Santo Domingo. Mimeo; Mejia, J.C., 2009.  “Impacto de la mano

Investigación Económica y Social. Santo Domingo. Unpublished; and World Bank, 2012. “Haiti, Dominican 
Republic: More than the sum of two parts.” Country Economic Memorandum.

the number procedures, time and cost involved in undertaking business transactions such as 
registering property, resolving insolvency proceedings, obtaining a construction permit or 
starting a business, these indicators are all above the regional average. For example, according to 
the Doing Business Report of 2014, while it takes 3.5 years for a firm in the DR to go through 
insolvency procedures and it costs 38 percent of the estate, the average in Latin America is 2.5 
years and 16 percent, respectively. These obstacles and costs affect micro and small enterprises 
much more than medium and large companies, who have greater resources to overcome these 
challenges. The Government has embarked on an ambitious reform agenda to reverse this 
regulatory complexity, and has been engaging various public and private stakeholders on an 
initiative to bring significant reform in key areas of the business environment such as insolvency, 
access to finance, protecting investors and starting a business. 
17. 
Insufficient access to finance, in particular for small enterprises and households, is a 
major obstacle to investment, growth and inclusion, which the government is keen to 
address. According to Findex data, 38 percent of the population has an account at a formal 
institution which is just below the LCR regional average of 39 percent. The most recent 
Enterprise Survey data shows that 64 percent of firms had a loan from a formal financial 
institution compared to 58 percent for the LCR region. However, only 4.5 percent of MSMEs get 
loans from banks, and both total credit to private sector and total deposits have the lowest 
penetration relative to GDP of all LCR countries (21 and 19 percent respectively). Without 
access to adequate financing, households are limited in their ability to take advantage of 
economic opportunities, and firms, especially MSMEs, cannot fund investments. Access to 
finance in the DR has been hampered by weak competition in the banking sector and public 
sector crowding-out. These problems are compounded by the banks’ high operational costs and 
lending rates; the need to modernize key elements of the financial sector infrastructure 
(especially insolvency and creditor rights), and the need to unify government programs providing 
support to MSMEs, including leveling the playing field for different institutions that provide 
credit.  In addition, stronger bank supervision and transparency of banking practices could 
improve oversight and the efficiency of the sector. 
18. 
Capital markets are small and face structural challenges, further reducing financing 
for investments and growth. There have been recent improvements in the public debt market, 
and the number of issuers of corporate bonds has increased from three in 2005 to 20 in 2011, 
while pension funds, which are the country’s main investor, have seen their assets grow 
substantially from one percent of GDP in 2003 to six percent in 2010. However, the amount of 
financing to the Dominican economy is still low as private credit to GDP is just 21 percent, and 
the private debt market represents less than 1.5 percent of GDP. The DR has a large and 
unfulfilled demand for infrastructure projects and a potential for more project financing through 
infrastructure bonds and other private solutions. Despite reductions in the inflation rate, domestic 
interest rates continue to be high 22, which makes it difficult for the corporate sector to use the 
bond market as a financing mechanism, so that the corporate bond market has not been able to 
develop much. Overall, insufficient capital market development is a problem for housing, 
corporate, and infrastructure financing.  

22 According to Central Bank data as of December 2012, the interest rate on government bonds with maturities 
between 4 to 7 years was 9.8 percent.

Low reliability and high cost of electricity have been some of the main drags on 
competitiveness in recent decades. Although coverage has risen over the past twenty years to 
around 98 percent of the population and black-outs have declined in duration since the early 
1990s, the DR still has more than six times as many power outages per month as the average for 
LCR, and more than one-third of the electricity generated in the country is not recovered. 23 The 
poor reliability of the electricity service 
FIGURE 4: PRODUCTIVITY IN ELECTRIC 
(averaging 17 hours per day) has led to 
UTILITIES 
reliance on 
self-generation, via an 
estimated 2,700 MW of highly polluting 
and expensive diesel gensets. The DR’s 
three public 
electricity distribution 
companies (EDEs) are also inefficient 
due 
to clientelism, 24 employing 
for 
example 11 times more workers than the 
utility of Santiago, Chile (Fig. 4). The 
DR has chosen not to increase tariffs in 
recent years in line with the steep rise in 
fuel costs since the mid-2000s, so actual 
tariffs averaged 20.4 cents per kilowatt 
hour in 2013 versus an indexed-cost tariff 
of 30 cents, which greatly increases the 
fiscal burden of the sector. In 2012, the sector’s losses led to government transfers of 10 percent 
of the national budget and two percent of GDP (2.7 percent in 2008). The DR plans to launch a 
dialogue in 2014 towards an Electricity Pact to achieve a broader political consensus on essential 
reforms for the sector, offering an opportunity to agree on measures to reduce power outages and 
the high cost of electricity thereby improving competitiveness and the well-being of Dominicans. 
20. 
There has been notable progress with 
regards 
to 
information and 
telecommunication technologies, but limited penetration reduces the impact on inclusion 
and competitiveness. The telecommunications sector has been a major source of growth of the 
economy during the past decade. Mobile subscriptions increased from 8 to 89 percent between 
2000 and 2013.  The DR has excellent undersea cable connectivity, but the proportion of fixed 
internet users (35 percent) and subscribers (four percent) in the population remain below regional 
averages mainly due to the under-development of a fiber optic backbone to link populations 
beyond the major cities at an affordable price. For the poorest households, fixed internet 
connectivity prices equal 79 percent of the household’s monthly earnings, and for 60 percent of 
households, connectivity prices are well above the maximum of five percent of household 
earnings recommended by 
the International 
telecommunications Union (ITU). In 26 
municipalities (16.8 percent of the existing 155 municipalities) there are no fixed internet 
accounts registered, and only 14.4 percent of households have internet, with a maximum of 22.1

percent in the city of Santo Domingo and a minimum of five percent in certain rural areas. This 
situation puts the DR at a disadvantage in reaping the potential benefits that ICT can offer, 
including competitiveness, job creation, transparency and participation. 

High vulnerability to economic and climate-related shocks 

21. 
The sustainability of growth and competitiveness are further affected by the DR’s 
high exposure to shocks, including economic shocks and natural disasters. The DR is highly 
sensitive to growth in Europe and the US with direct links to tourism and remittance revenues. It 
is also highly exposed to oil prices. In addition, the DR is among the countries that are most 
exposed to natural disasters in the world, ranking 8th out of 183 countries. 25 The DR has been hit 
by 10 hurricanes in the last 50 years, the most damaging of which (e.g., David in 1979 and 
George in 1998) caused economic losses in excess of 14 percent of GDP. 26  Natural disasters 
have been a source of high fiscal burden (e.g., damages and losses caused by tropical storm Noel 
in 2007 represented a fiscal burden that forced the government to reallocate funds representing 
0.22 percent of GDP in the months following the event and issue new disaster-related debt equal 
to 0.61 percent of GDP). According to insurance industry models, the average expected annual 
losses to the economy of earthquakes and hurricane winds are more than US$600 million, and 
there is an eight percent chance that the country will be hit by a natural disaster that may cause 
damages of more than US$6 billion during the period of the CPS (CCRIF, 2014).  
22. 
Natural disasters have a high human toll, especially on the poor. The DR ranks as one 
of the top five countries in LCR for disaster-related deaths: during the period 2002-2010 an 
estimate of 966 people were killed and 350,000 were affected in the DR by earthquakes, storms, 
epidemics and flooding. 27 Due to precarious living conditions, poor households tend to be hit 
harder by natural disasters. When tropical cyclone Noel hit the DR in 2007, 90 percent of the 
direct victims were under the national poverty line. Adverse effects of natural disasters are not 
limited to short-term and temporal losses of well-being; they can push households into poverty 
traps from which recovery may not be possible without external assistance. 
23. 
The government is keen to mitigate this high risk by incorporating disaster 
prevention and climate change adaptation measures in territorial and public investment 
plans to prevent disasters and manage risks to major infrastructure (e.g., dams, roads, schools, 
hospitals). There is also a need to better protect the private sector where insurance coverage is 
insufficient, notably for small agriculture producers and MSMEs. 
Public Finance Management and Fiscal Challenges 

24. 
The current structure of fiscal policy, both on the revenue and expenditure sides, 
limits the government’s ability to provide more equitable access to quality public services 
and places too much of the burden on the poor. The fiscal system is hampered by low revenue 
collection, expenditures that are insufficiently progressive, budget rigidities that limit the ability

to redirect allocations, and a heavy reliance on indirect taxes that also limit progressivity. The 
country’s low tax to GDP ratio limits the government’s ability to expand public services while 
maintaining debt sustainability, and infrastructure spending has, until 2013, long been given 
preference over investment in human development. 28 Equitable access to basic services (e.g., 
primary enrolment, health insurance and potable water and sanitation) has expanded in the last 
decade, thereby enhancing equality of opportunities and reducing unmet basic needs. However 
the slow rate of progress implies that it would take more than a generation to level the playing 
field for the poor and the vulnerable. In addition, the quality of public service delivery remains 
low, so that the middle class often opts out in favor of private solutions for security, electricity, 
education or health. 29 
25. 
The government has been working since 2012 on strengthening the budgetary 
process to improve its credibility, predictability and openness. The 2012 Public Expenditure 
and Financial Accountability Assessment (PEFA) found that these areas had worsened since the 
2010 PEFA. Public expenditure allocation remains highly discretionary and in the hands of the 
Executive. The progress achieved since 2006 (when the Budget law and the Procurement law 
were approved) was partly reversed in 2012 30. The DR’s integrated budget financial information 
system does not include decentralized and autonomous institutions and does not provide 
adequate and timely information during the budget process (budget formulation, execution, 
modification, accounting and reporting). Despite efforts to shift the focus to outcomes, budget 
formulation is still incremental, rather than performance-driven. There has been important 
progress on the Open Budget Index, which increased from 14 in 2008 to 29 in 2012, although 
this remains below the average of neighboring countries. The quality and comprehensiveness of 
information provided via the web portal and the limited degree of substantive public engagement 
on the budget contribute to the low relative ranking of the DR. 
26. 
A limited tax base and rigid expenditures result in limited fiscal space, constraining 
the government’s ability to promote growth and greater inclusion. The authorities 
successfully reduced the central government’s primary deficit from 2.1 percent of GDP in 2008 
to around 0.5 percent of GDP in 2011, but fiscal policy was relaxed in 2012, an election year, 
when the primary deficit expanded to 4.6 percent of GDP. The persistent primary deficit is due to 
two long-standing, structural challenges, namely the large electricity sector deficit, which 
absorbed 1.8 percent of GDP in public subsidies in 2012, and a narrow tax base, which has 
averaged 13.7 percent of GDP since 2000 and has not risen despite numerous tax reforms. Low 
levels of revenue collection are associated to a narrow tax base, caused by significant exemptions 
resulting in tax expenditures estimated at 5.9 percent of GDP in 2013, and to tax avoidance via 
informality. 
27. 
As a first step to increase much needed fiscal space, the government has taken 
measures to increase public revenues. A tax package approved in November 2012 that

increased VAT rates from 16 to 18 percent, and the renegotiation of the agreement with Barrick 
Gold are expected to help increase public revenues by 1.2 to 2 percentage points over the next 
four years, but this may be insufficient to expand fiscal space in the medium term. Public debt 
service reached 4.6 percent of GDP or 20.8 percent of central government expenditures in 2012. 
The ratio of debt interest to fiscal revenue rose from 8.6 percent in 2004-2008 to 14.1 percent in 
2009-2012 and currently represents a significant burden for public finance. The consolidated 
public sector debt rose from 33 percent of GDP in 2007 to 48 percent of GDP in 2013. The stock 
of debt is three times the annual tax collected, the highest such ratio among 20 Latin American 
countries, underscoring the country’s narrow fiscal space. Furthermore, recent debt sustainability 
analysis shows that the DR is vulnerable in the event of an exchange rate shock, so that fiscal 
consolidation is a priority. 

Inequities in access to basic public and social services 

28. 
Several challenges hamper public service delivery, especially in water and sanitation, 
education, health and social services. 
29. 
In water and sanitation, despite significant coverage improvement, the sector faces 
challenges related to access, quality and sustainability of services. Access to water supply 
and sanitation (WSS), at 80 percent and 70 percent respectively, have improved gradually and 
are above LCR averages. However, these averages mask big differences between the richest and 
poorest quintiles of the population, ranging from 20 percentage points for water to almost 50 
percentage points for sanitation. Also, actual sewerage collection is low at less than 25 percent, 
as is wastewater treatment at 22 percent of sewerage collection, with treatment ranging from 
around 60 percent in Santiago to less than 5 percent in Santo Domingo. Water quality also varies 
greatly: around 68 percent of the DR’s water supply is disinfected, mainly in big cities, but only 
6 percent is chlorinated in rural areas. This has significant potential health impacts, especially for 
the poor, and notably in relation to cholera, which has re-emerged on Quisqueya, especially in 
Haiti but also in the DR. 31 The DR’s main rivers are highly polluted and the country has 
struggled to maintain adequate levels of water and sewerage quality services in certain tourist 
areas, a challenge that is critical to sustaining its 5 million visitor beach-tourism industry. 
Moreover, other than in Santiago, where water is priced close to the LCR average of $0.45 per 
cubic meter, most regional water authorities charge less than $0.10 per cubic meter, 
compounding the problem of extremely low water billing and collection rates. 
30. 
There is a need for a strong lead institution in the sector. WSS services are provided 
by six regional water utilities and by a National WSS Institute (INAPA), which covers the 
remaining urban and rural areas. However, there is no clear lead institution to set overall sector 
policy: INAPA blends various sector functions including regulation and service provision and 
the National Council on Water, which should serve as a temporary body as the DR moves 
towards creating a regulatory body for the sector, is inactive. Additionally, the DR has yet to 
establish a national WSS information system, cost recovery in the sector is weak (the 

31 From the beginning of the epidemic in November 2010 to February 2014, 31,521 suspected cholera cases and 467 
deaths were reported. However, the reported number of cases markedly decreased from 20,851 in 2011 to 7,919 in 
2012 (cholera mortality rate dropped from 3.46 in 2011 to 0.67/100,000 inhabitants in 2012, according to MOH). 
The reported number of suspected cholera cases (57) for Jan.-Feb. 2014 is much lower than the number of new cases 
reported for the same period in 2013, 2012, and 2011 (PAHO, Epidemiological Profile, March 2014).

government subsidizes 100 percent of investment and 70 percent of operation and maintenance 
in water and sanitation), and water resources and water and sanitation laws have been under 
discussion in Congress for many years but have not yet been approved. A lead WSS institution is 
required to drive a country-wide water reform agenda for improved access and services. 
31. 
Fragmented institutional arrangements and unclear policy direction also hamper 
good water resource management. Even if Water Administration and Management and 
Watershed management have been transferred clearly in 2000 under the jurisdiction of the 
Ministry of the Environment by mandate of Law 64-00, Integrated Water Resource Management 
(IWRM) principles are still not fully implemented in the DR. The Ministry of Environment lacks 
the resources and a more solid legal framework to play an effective role in promoting a 
sustainable water and soil management 32, water quality protection 33 and multipurpose use of 
hydraulic infrastructures 34. Some IWRM-related functions and decision-making processes are 
still fragmented across the different water-related sectors, especially: (i) the National Institute for 
Hydraulic Resources (INDRHI), which is the direct or indirect administrator (through Water 
Users Associations) of 300,000 hectares of irrigated land, accounting for 88 percent of water 
abstraction and; (ii) the Hydraulic Electrical Generation Enterprise (EGEHID), in charge of 
operating the main hydropower facilities in the country (13 percent of total energy generation). 
An integrated approach to water resource management and other water users such as industry 
and household water and sanitation is nonexistent.  This takes on increasing urgency over time 
because the DR faces a relative scarcity of freshwater, with renewable internal freshwater 
resources (two million cubic meters per capita) at one-tenth of the average for LCR. 
32. 
The education sector continues to face challenges in terms of quality, coverage, 
access, efficiency and learning outcomes. Historically, low levels of investments in education 
resulted in low coverage, weak quality and poor outcomes in the education system, especially for 
rural and poor children. Investment in education, which until 2013 had averaged 2.3 percent of 
GDP, has been well below regional and UMIC averages, although the Government has raised 
this to four percent since 2013, reflecting both its clear commitment to education and strong civil 
society pressure. Access to Early Childhood Development (ECD) Services for children through 
age five is low (38 percent in 2011), equivalent to just over half the rate for LCR.  It is especially 
low for rural areas and for those in the poorest quintile. Net completion rates at the primary and 
secondary levels are low compared to regional averages: less than 30 percent of the primary 
school age population completes primary and only 18 percent of the secondary school age 
population completes secondary. 35 Pupil-teacher ratios are high especially at the secondary level 
(28:1 vs. an average of 15-16:1 for LCR and UMICs). The insufficient availability of classrooms 
for students, resulting in double shifts, puts pressure on student-teacher ratios (78:1 in public 
schools with over 500 students) and leaves little effective class time (less than three hours a day). 
33. 
The low quality of teaching and limited educational resources for teachers and 
students, have contributed to poor outcomes, reflected in high repetition rates (eight percent at 

32 Yaque del Sur or Yuna watersheds for example, deforestation and severe erosion processes in upper watersheds 
33 Like in Ozama, Higuamo, Yuna, Yaque del Norte with water quality issues identified by MIMARENA in 2002.

irrigation, or irrigation and environmental flows.

primary level) and high drop-out rates (boys tend to drop out earlier than girls, especially in rural 
areas, but girls drop out of secondary schools in larger numbers, so gross completion rates are 
less than 50 percent overall, with 55 percent for girls and 40 percent for boys). Moreover, the 
lack of pedagogical and administrative management systems at all levels resulted in poor 
accountability for actors in the system. The performance of students in the Second Regional 
Comparative and Explanatory Study (SERCE) show that over 78 percent of third-grade students 
are not achieving basic competencies in reading and 90 percent are falling short in basic 
competencies in math, far more than in comparable 
countries or the rest of the region (Figure 5). There 
are no early standardized tests that can be used to 
strengthen 
the effectiveness of 
teaching and 
learning. Moreover, curricula do not appear to be 
well aligned with business needs, 
leading 
to 
unemployment among graduates. 
34. 
A National Pact for Education Reform 
was signed on April 1, 2014, which provides a 
unique opportunity to address the sector’s 
challenges. The Education Pact signed between the 
Government, the main political parties, members of 
the Economic and Social Council, private sector 
and civil society actors drew on a nationwide 
participatory process and led to agreements on key 
priorities to be implemented through 2030, without regard to which political party is in power. 
Agreements reached included free public early childhood education for all children from age 
three onwards; respect for the school calendar and roll-out of an extended school day to enhance 
learning; competitive pre-screening of teachers as well as enhanced teacher training to enhance 
teacher quality, and the introduction of standardized tests in basic education to diagnose 
challenges and inform improvements in education. 
35. Outcomes in health have improved but challenges remain, especially in improving 
the quality of health services to reduce maternal mortality. Even though 98 percent of births 
are attended by health professionals and 95 percent of women receive at least four prenatal visits 
(both above the LCR average), maternal mortality is one of the highest in the region – almost 
twice as high as the regional average at 130/100,000 births (vs. a regional average of 80/100,000 
births). Infant and under five child mortality are also high by regional standards (respectively 22 
and 28 per 1000 live births, vs. 19 and 22 per 1000 live births on average for LCR). Progress has 
been made over time on child and maternal health indicators but gaps between actual results and 
MDGs remain and are particularly large for maternal mortality.  While demand side 
interventions are important to further increase prenatal consultations and institutional births, 
available evidence suggest that poor standards of practice largely explain why these weak 
outcomes arise in spite of a very high ratio of births attended by medical professionals. 
Adolescent pregnancy also remains high and its related consequences such as poor maternal and 
child health outcomes and lower educational and labor prospects for young mothers would 
require a coordinated multi-sectoral response. In addition, while progress has also been made on 
reducing the incidence of dengue, malaria, cholera and tuberculosis, fatalities related to these 

15 

illnesses also remain high by regional standards. The recent appearance of the Chikungunya 
virus is creating additional health issues 36. 
36. While health insurance coverage has improved due to the roll-out of contributory 
and subsidized regimes, further efforts are needed to attain universal coverage. About 51 
percent of the population is still not covered by health insurance. The Subsidized Regime (SR) 
still needs to reach 27 percent of its target population while the Contributory Subsidized Regime, 
which has a target population of approximately 3 million people, has not yet been implemented. 
37. 
Since 2003, the Government has introduced key elements of a social protection 
system, and intends to continue its efforts to improve targeting and develop better linkages 
to economic opportunities, including via active labor market programs. An institutionalized 
targeting system, Sistema Único de Beneficiarios (Single Beneficiary Selection System or 
SIUBEN) that classifies households by poverty levels, and a safety net, known as Progresando 
con Solidaridad (PROSOLI), which fosters human capital accumulation through cash transfers to 
targeted households conditioned on verified actions to strengthen children’s health and school 
attendance have been put in place. These programs were critical in mitigating the effects of the 
2008 global crisis on the poor, and have achieved the fifth highest coverage in LCR, with 
Conditional Cash Transfers (CCT) benefitting 775,000 households, at a cost of less than 0.5 
percent of GDP. Going forward, a revamping of PROSOLI is envisaged to support poor 
households via a holistic approach that includes CCT, socio-educational support and improved 
housing and income-generating programs (e.g., vocational training, entrepreneurship) with the 
purpose to foster graduation out of poverty. This would require applying the 2012 SIUBEN to 
PROSOLI and other targeted services and subsidies, rationalizing social programs, improving 
interagency coordination, a more integrated territorial approach, and enhanced accountability 
through a greater use of results-based resource allocation 37. Finally, while 230,000 people have 
received identification documents since 2010 that enable them to access public services, over 
300,000 people over 18 years of age remain undocumented. 

38. Governance challenges reinforce problems in the delivery of public services. Despite 
a lively media and active civil society, clientelism and governance and accountability issues 
persist at both front-line service delivery (micro) and macro levels, in particular in areas such as 
budgetary process and overall fiscal management, financial management, procurement and audit 
systems, and the overall quality and openness of government data, thus leading to the 
consolidation of vested interests in various sectors, a sharp fall in the perceived control of 
corruption since 2004, 38 and a fraying of the social contract 39.

GOVERNMENT VISION 
The DR’s long-term planning is anchored on the country’s National Development 
39. 
Strategy (END) or Vision 2030. 40 Approved by Congress in March 2012, the END is divided 
into four pillars with 19 general objectives, 57 specific objectives and 90 key performance 
indicators. Pillar one on institutional development aims to achieve a social and democratic state, 
with rule of law and transparent institutions, at the service of a responsible and participatory 
citizenry that guarantees security and promotes equity, governance, peaceful coexistence and 
national and local development. Pillar two on social development is to achieve a society with 
equal rights and opportunities, in which the entire population is guaranteed education, health, 
decent housing and quality basic services, and one that promotes the progressive reduction of 
poverty and of social and territorial inequality. Pillar three on productive development aims to 
develop an integrated, innovative, diversified, quality and sustainable economy that creates and 
de-concentrates wealth, generates high and sustained growth with equity and decent jobs, takes 
advantage of and strengthens local market opportunities and inserts itself competitively in the 
global economy. Pillar four on sustainable development is designed to foster an environmentally 
sustainable society that adapts to climate change. Cross-cutting policies cover human rights, 
gender, environmental sustainability, territorial cohesion, civic engagement and ICT for public 
management. The END law also calls for three major pacts on education, electricity and fiscal 
issues. 
40. 
The Government’s 2013-2016 plan for the public sector, in line with the END, 
focuses on institutional development. 41 The plan’s objectives are to establish a transactional 
procurement portal, consolidate public accounts into a single treasury account, implement 
international public sector accounting standards, expand coverage of the SIGEF, improve the 
budget portal and foster greater civic engagement. It also envisages institutional mechanisms for 
participation and oversight, e.g. the Pacts for Education and Electricity and civic oversight of all 
procurement by the Ministry of the Presidency and selected other public agencies. 
41. 
The Government also has ambitious medium-term goals in the areas of social 
development and productive development. The Government is currently focusing efforts on 
expanding the coverage of CCT; implementing a strategy to help households exit poverty 
(“Hispaniola Sin Miseria”); adopting a territorial approach to social assistance programs, 
including in the areas of ECD (“Hispaniola Empieza Contigo”); eliminating illiteracy 
(“Hispaniola Aprende Contigo”); fostering participatory dialogues through the Dominican 
Initiative for Quality Education (IDEC) and the Pact for Education to build a political consensus 
for reforms to boost educational quality; articulating a national employment system; expanding 
access to public health insurance and upgrading the quality of health services; and increasing 
access of water supply and sanitation. As far as productive development is concerned, areas of 
focus include creating jobs; increasing tourism arrivals; boosting agricultural production and 
exports; supporting SMEs; reviewing labor laws; completing major road network and 
investments; reducing electricity generation costs and sector losses; expanding mining; and 
fostering greater connectivity (e.g., internet access, citizen participation, e-services). 

40 See http://www.stp.gov.do/mepyd/estrategia-nacional-de-desarrollo-2030/  
41 This plan and the END are complemented by various sector plans, e.g. 10-year plans for education and for gender.

WORLD BANK GROUP COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY 

I. 
Lessons Learned from the Previous CPS 
Lessons from the Completion Report of the FY09-13 Country Partnership Strategy 
42. 
(CPS CR) highlight the need for greater selectivity and focus on mutually reinforcing 
objectives. It also shows that the Bank’s knowledge and convening services were important 
complements to the lending program in achieving results.  For example Bank support for public-
private dialogues (e.g., Iniciativa Participativa Anti-Corrupción -IPAC, Caribbean Growth 
Forum -CGF, Iniciativa Dominicana para una Educación de Calidad- IDEC) effectively 
leveraged the Bank’s expertise and convening power into results with strong local ownership, 
while involving minimal Bank financing. The CPS CR also suggest that project design should 
take into account a range of factors that can otherwise slow implementation: political economy 
considerations, project management and capacity constraints; turnover in project management 
and bureaucratic hindrances on both the Bank’s and the client’s side; that strong monitoring and 
evaluation systems are critical to the success of the Bank’s engagement; and that political 
economy analysis should underpin program and project design. The IEG reviews of projects that 
closed during the FY10-13 CPS period and of the FY06-09 CPS Completion Report point to the 
need to develop more robust M&E systems that include readily quantifiable indicators; build into 
project design adequate risk mitigation; strengthen financial and procurement management; and 
ensure organizational and staffing continuity to achieve success.  

II. 

Consultations 

43. 
The CPS draws on extensive strategic consultations. The CPS is grounded on 
extensive nationwide consultations, including: (i) the IPAC, IDEC, Pact for Education and CGF 
participatory processes, that inform programming in the areas of governance, education, skills 
and productivity, investment climate and logistics; (ii) the DR Dialogue Day (March 9, 2013), 
involving the Inter-American Development Bank, the World Bank Group, and high-ranking 
government counterparts in ten Ministries, as a culmination of the joint Inter-American 
Development Bank (IDB)-WBG elaboration of Policy Notes for the DR; (iii) CPS consultations 
(April and May 2013) with over 280 people in five cities around the country (Santiago, Dajabón, 
Barahona, La Romana and Santo Domingo) and with the Dominican diaspora in New York, 
complemented by further consultations with civil society and private sector actors and with 
donors in June 2014; these consultations reconfirmed several priorities under consideration and 
led directly to the addition of a focus on agriculture; and, (iv) the FY13 Country Survey, which 
suggests that the Bank’s program is seen as well aligned with key stakeholder priorities 
(including public sector governance, corruption, citizen participation, education, energy and 
jobs) and that the Bank is seen as a valued and knowledgeable development partner (see Annex 
11). 

III. Country Engagement Model 

44. 
The proposed CPS is aligned with the WBG twin goals of ending extreme poverty 
and boosting shared prosperity and the Government’s development priorities, as 
established in the END. In line with the WBG twin goals, the strategy supports operations 
aimed at improving the enabling environment for private sector development and job creation; 
building resilience to external shocks; and, promoting equitable, efficient, transparent and 

18 

sustainable management of public resources and public service delivery. The WBG’s proposed 
program of financing, knowledge and convening services has been designed to support the DR’s 
priorities, as established in the National Development Strategy (END) and the Government’s 
four year plan as well as the diagnostic of key challenges to poverty reduction and shared 
prosperity presented in this strategy. The program is coordinated with those of other key 
development partners, particularly the IDB. To maximize impact, the proposed development 
solutions leverage the comparative advantage of each institution of the WBG. 
45. 
This CPS applies a systematic filtering to define focus areas and activities, including: 
(i) client demand/commitment; (ii) “line of sight” to the twin corporate goals; (iii) potential to 
achieve highest impact in the DR, in particular in shifting to a more sustainable and inclusive 
development path, in line with the diagnostic above; and (iv) WBG comparative advantage 42. It 
also takes into account the assistance provided by other development partners (see Fig. 6). With 
such filters, the proposed program selectively supports five Results Areas.  
46. 
To strengthen the impact of its support, the WBG will do at least five things 
differently than during the previous CPS period. First, the use of a systematic filtering 
process will allow the WBG to shift its program of support towards the most relevant areas and 
activities. Second, the Bank will intensify partnerships with local counterparts and external 
donors, building further on the strong coordination that already exists with various donors, 
notably the IDB. Third, the CPS will draw more on political economy and stakeholder analysis 
and introduce beneficiary feedback and/or citizen’s engagement mechanisms in Bank projects as 
applicable to understand and address reform challenges better and draw on citizen’s voices to 
strengthen results. Fourth, where feasible, the CPS will combine WBG engagements in a 
territorial approach to address challenges for marginalized communities and approach issues at 
the level of the island where relevant.  Finally, this CPS is guided by the principles of flexibility 
and focus on results through tailored financial and knowledge development solutions by the 
WBG. The strategy is a joint effort from the IFC, MIGA and the World Bank. While proposing 
development solutions as one WBG, interventions have been selected based on each WBG 
institution’s comparative advantage and client demand. 
47. 
In select areas, the WBG will endeavor to promote enhanced coordination with 
Haiti. Under the previous CPS, the Bank produced the Quisqueya report on common growth and 
poverty reduction opportunities in the island in order to generate more and better information to 
inform policy decisions in the areas of competitiveness and economic relations with Haiti. This 
CPS will endeavor to support selected actions needed to promote enhanced coordination and 
collaboration between the two countries. Bi-national trade, investments, migrations, and 
remittances have been identified as the most critical linkages between the two nations. The WBG 
will coordinate closely with the EU, which is leading this agenda among donors on the DR side, 
and is therefore providing much of the basic institutional strengthening support as well as 
leadership in this dialogue. Among others, the Bank will contribute to efforts to eradicate cholera 
on the island, through coordinated health and water and sanitation programs both in Haiti and in 
the DR. The Bank will also foster a dialogue and knowledge exchange in the energy sector. The 
IFC program will focus on cross-border, private sector-led investment opportunities (e.g., 
CODEVI, Leopard Capital). IFC expects to continue supporting manufacturing opportunities in 

42 Comparative advantage was defined as measuring the WBG’s global experience, its analytical understanding and 
the success of its engagement in a given area.  

19 

                                                 
the context of a bi-national operation, and to support and catalyze integration across Quisqueya 
in new sectors such as energy, natural gas transportation, or the financial sector. 
48. Gender and governance considerations are critical to the engagement and will be 
mainstreamed in all activities. Building on previous efforts to strengthen social accountability 
mechanisms and bring multiple voices to the table through dialogues that would press for greater 
transparency, the program will combine significant support for strengthening PFM systems while 
addressing governance challenges that can constrain the transparent and equitable delivery of 
quality public services under each of the proposed new lending operations. A key part of this will 
include building on past experiences to work with clients to mainstream more systematic citizen 
feedback mechanisms, combined with more open data, and better articulation of the “compact” 
or norms of service in key sectors across the WBG program. On gender, a Country Gender 
Analysis (CGA) completed in 2013 and a Gender Portfolio Review conducted by the World 
Bank in the lead-up to the CPS, which shows that about 15 percent of inequality in opportunities 
in the DR is explained by gender, inform this strategy (see Annex 14). The CPS will contribute 
to gender mainstreaming by consistently ensuring a stronger and more complete gender 
perspective in supported operations, including gender consideration in analysis, actions and 
monitoring and evaluation as applicable across the new pipeline. At the same time, the scope of 
actions will be expanded to include specific programs targeting female-headed households 
(FHH). Finally, greater dialogue on gender issues with national partner institutions will be 
fostered within the framework of the priority areas of the CPS. 
49. 
Continuing from the previous World Bank Group Strategy, work initiated in the 
DR on citizen engagement will be actively sustained. As the DR has been among the pioneers 
in ICT-enabled citizen engagement platforms, the CPS will continue to assist clients in 
developing beneficiary feedback mechanisms, and enhance linkages between open data and civic 
engagement in service delivery as possible. Citizen engagement can be promoted at three levels:  
(a) through integration of more systematic citizen feedback and definition of norms into Bank 
operations on service delivery; (b) at the policy level via coalition-building initiatives and 
inclusive dialogues such as those around the Pact for Education, the Electricity Pact, the Fiscal 
Pact and the Caribbean Growth Forum, which prove to be powerful vehicles for civic 
engagement; and, lastly, (c) via capacity building for civic oversight of procurement (and third 
party) monitoring by civil society. Bank operations will continue to encourage citizen 
engagement for instance through the use of scorecards in CCT, civic platform pilots in the 
electricity sector, social compact and social audits in the health sector, etc. 
50. 
To enhance impact on poverty reduction, the CPS will seek to focus its interventions 
geographically on selected poor provinces of the country, combining various dimensions of 
support to targeted households in extreme poverty. Integrated Social Protection and 
Promotion will target 14 provinces with the highest levels of extreme-poverty and extremely-
poor households that tend to be in those rural areas. These households will be provided with an 
integrated package of services: human capital gaps, CCT, housing improvements, and skills-
enhancement. The Bank is also targeting its ongoing municipal development support to the 
poorest municipalities. As for reducing poverty among female-headed households and increasing 
women’s entry to the labor market, the proposed integrated social protection project and the 
proposed flexible employment services project would pay special attention to vulnerable groups, 
including poor women and female heads of households.

Proposed World Bank Group Country Partnership Strategy  

51. 
The overall strategic goal of the CPS for FY15-18 is to support the Government’s 
efforts to make growth sustainable and more inclusive. The CPS will be organized around 
five strategic results areas over the next four years: improving the investment climate and 
fostering private sector development; improving access to efficient and reliable electrical 
distribution networks, ICT and other infrastructure; supporting the government in building 
resilience to external shocks; promoting equitable, efficient, transparent and sustainable 
management of public resources; and, strengthening social service delivery (Fig. 7). 
FIGURE 7: WBG COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY IN THE DOMINICAN 
REPUBLIC 

Results Area 1: Improving the investment climate and fostering private sector development 

CPS Outcomes: (1) an improved climate for doing business for microenterprises and SMEs, 
measured by a shorter time for a company to register; and, (2) improved access to finance, 
measured, among others, by additional clients benefiting from SME finance in IFC-supported 
institutions. 
52. 
The CPS will support measures that foster a dynamic, competitive private sector 
that generates quality jobs. Bank Group engagement will focus on avoiding a dual economy 
and a reliance on enclave activities, by strengthening value chains and backward linkages to the 
local economy, and by removing barriers and disincentives to formality by improving the 
investment climate for microenterprises and SMEs and access to finance. 43  
53. 
This engagement will be delivered through an integrated suite of financing, 
knowledge and convening services by the WBG. The WBG program will focus both on 
vertical support to specific sectors and on general horizontal support: specifically the WBG will 

 43 See the 2013 World Development Report on Jobs, and the IFC 2013 Study on Jobs 

22 

 
                                                 
indeed continue to help the DR strengthen the general business environment while fostering the 
development of specific sectors that can be drivers of growth. At the macro level, the program 
will include coordinated Bank-IFC reimbursable advisory services to strengthen the investment 
climate, the financial sector and corporate governance; subnational Doing Business analysis; 
possible additional knowledge services on innovation, and competition policy, and convening 
services via the Caribbean Growth Forum (CGF). At industry level, interventions will focus on 
the agribusiness and mining sectors to remove gaps in the value-chain, improve the business 
environment, reduce infrastructure gaps, foster higher entrepreneurship and innovation, and 
attract private investment. 
54. 
A better investment climate is necessary to enhance competitiveness and facilitate a 
more inclusive development of the private sector. The Bank Group will advise the government 
in the selection of reforms priorities and the elaboration of action plans, focusing on reform areas 
susceptible to have the greatest impact in improving the investment climate in the country. For 
each reform area, the WBG will work with the government and key counterparts from the private 
sector to support the implementation of the Action Plans. Support activities will include technical 
assistance to promote better service delivery to the private sector, and capacity building.  
55. 
Enhancing access to finance will be important to foster more inclusive growth and 
more spillovers into the local economy. The Bank will conduct a Development Financial 
Sector Assessment (D-FSAP) to provide a comprehensive diagnostic of obstacles to greater 
access to finance, followed by assistance to implement recommendations. The IFC will support 
microenterprises and SMEs, with a focus on financial inclusion, and targeting SMEs, women 
entrepreneurs, farmers, low-income households, and students. The IFC will explore providing 
credit lines for women-owned SMEs (via intermediary lending) and enhanced support to female 
micro-entrepreneurs through partner financial institutions. To increase competition in the 
financial sector, IFC will aim at supporting the conversion of some second-tier credit-unions, 
microfinance NGOs and cooperatives into full-fledged banks, strengthening both their capital 
base and governance, while the Bank is likely to work towards strengthening financial regulation 
and supervision and improving government programs. The IFC will also support local capital 
markets development by continuing to issue medium and long term local currency bonds, 
establishing needed benchmarks for the private sector, and using bonds proceeds to expand 
access to long term local currency financing for the private sector while providing a viable 
channel for domestic savings to be directed to productive long term investments. 
56. 
Budgetary constraints represent an opportunity 
for more public-private 
partnerships, potentially with IFC and MIGA support. The government is keen to explore 
how to re-launch its PPP program to address critical infrastructure and services gaps. However, 
the DR’s mixed experience with PPPs has led the Government to be wary of this approach, so 
that effective advisory services will be needed where opportunities arise, to strengthen the design 
of future PPPs and ensure their success. 
57. 
The WBG will support a more inclusive development of the agribusiness sector. The 
program will aim to: (i) provide investment support for agricultural value-chains to facilitate 
collaboration between SMEs, smallholders and larger companies, thereby aiming to make 
agriculture more inclusive and a stronger source of rural poverty eradication; and, (ii) strengthen 
linkages between agriculture and the local tourism industry, and at making agriculture more 
resilient. This support will be achieved through a Bank lending operation, continuous dialogue 
and collaboration with key development partners and possible IFC investments and MIGA 

23 

guarantees. An assessment will also be conducted of how best to develop Climate Smart 
Agriculture in the DR to enable the country to better assess the geospatial impacts on agriculture 
of looming climate variability and increasing frequency and intensity of extreme events (rainfall, 
heat)  and make investments in value-chains more resilient to climate and weather shocks.  
58. 
The WBG will also support a more transparent and inclusive development of the 
mining sector. Support will focus primarily on developing a policy and strategy for the 
sustainable development of mining and providing guidance on international best practices, as 
well as setting up and implementing the EITI process in the DR. This focus on oil, gas and 
mining reform will allow the DR to develop its natural resource sector in a more strategic and 
sustainable manner. IFC will continue supporting the development of mining operations at the 
development and operation stages, with a focus on building responsible mining operations that 
maximize benefits to local communities and the country.  

Results Area 2: Improving access to efficient and reliable electrical distribution networks, ICT 
and other infrastructure 

CPS Outcomes: (1) improved efficiency and reliability of the electricity sector, measured, among 
others by a reduction in commercial losses; (2) improved connectivity through the deployment of 
a national broadband backbone between the main city of several provinces, measured, among 
others by an increase in the number of provinces interconnected through the national broadband 
network; and, (3) energy diversification. 
The CPS will aim to address issues related to access to efficient and reliable 
59. 
electrical distribution networks, ICT and other infrastructure services, major constraints 
to private sector development and competitiveness. Reducing electricity sector commercial 
losses and providing a more reliable and continuous supply of electricity would have a large 
direct impact on enterprises, competitiveness, fiscal expenditures, and households. Improved 
connectivity would also enhance competitiveness through higher efficiency and innovation.  In 
partnership with the European Investment Bank, the IDB and with potential IFC support on 
improving the generation mix via clean renewable sources, the Bank will explore opportunities 
for realigning fiscal incentives, reducing fossil fuel subsidies and supporting the achievement of 
an Electricity Pact in 2014, while bearing in mind the complexity of the political economy of the 
sector. The program will also focus on improving access to more efficient and reliable ICT 
services, given its importance for nationally integrated and inclusive growth, for the open data 
and civic innovation agendas and for overcoming the digital divide. 
60. 
First, the WBG will support strengthening governance, enhancing quality of service 
delivery, and reducing losses in the electricity sector. This engagement will build on ongoing 
successful work aimed at rehabilitating distribution lines to improve electricity supply and at 
strengthening incentives for payment for services through community outreach and guaranteed 
24-hour service where repayments are high, while intensifying the dialogue on the performance 
and governance of distribution companies, so as to ensure greater transparency and efficiency. 
The Bank will also provide support for hedging risks on fuel prices, for the Electricity Pact, and 
for strengthened management and oversight in the electricity sector. IFC will seek to mobilize 
financing for investments that help diversify the country’s generation matrix and introduce 
innovative off-grid generation models. IFC will also seek to support the development of new 

24 

liquid natural gas import and gasification infrastructure and promote greater energy efficiency 
via lending partnerships with local financial institutions. 
61. 
Second, the WBG will focus on improving access to more efficient and reliable ICT 
services. This high priority area for engagement will be supported through a proposed Bank 
investment linked to the Caribbean Regional Connectivity Program (CARCIP). 44 The proposed 
project seeks to increase access to regional broadband networks and advance the development of 
ICT-enabled services. CARCIP can support existing Government’s efforts in addressing the lack 
of supply of fixed broadband connectivity, particularly in remote and marginalized areas of the 
country, and contribute to providing universal and affordable access to all citizens. CARCIP will 
also support work on Open Innovation to build ICT skills, particularly among the poor and 
women, and foster a culture of entrepreneurship by involving citizens in identifying and solving 
their own problems through ICT solutions. MIGA will explore opportunities to support further 
projects that boost growth and jobs in the DR, including via its Small Investment Program. 
62. 
Finally, the WBG will also support selected infrastructure efforts. This will include 
the rehabilitation of storm-damaged transmission lines and of large water resources infrastructure 
via the existing Emergency Recovery Loan. It may also be complemented by new knowledge 
services to support the conservation and management of water resources. MIGA will oversee its 
on-going toll-road guarantee to Autopistas del Nordeste. The IFC will contribute by mobilizing 
private financing to support firms that will provide infrastructure services and foster 
connectivity. 

Results Area 3: Supporting the Government in building resilience to external shocks 

CPS Outcomes: (1) improved DRM planning in the norms and procedures for public investment 
projects in light of climate change; and, (2) recovery from tropical storms Olga and Noel with 
increased resilience of infrastructure; these outcomes will be measured, among others, by the 
development of a national integrated information system for DRM and by the number of dams 
rehabilitated. 
The WBG will enhance the DR’s capacity to manage the destructive effects of 
63. 
natural disasters by mainstreaming disaster risk management (DRM) in territorial 
planning and public finances. Recent developments reflect political commitment to strengthen 
the institutional framework for DRM (including the preparation of a new DRM law) and shift the 
focus from effective response to natural disasters towards more proactive planning and up-front 
risk mitigation and prevention. Given the devastating impacts of natural disasters on the poor and 
the difficulty they face in recovering from disasters even in the medium-long term, efforts in this 
area would have a direct impact on poverty reduction. in coordination with the UNDP, Spanish 
cooperation, and other partners, the Bank will provide knowledge and convening services related 
to DRM planning and risk financing and insurance; as well as funding under the Forest Carbon 
Partnership Facility and grant-funded capacity building, and supporting participation of the DR 

44 International studies indicate that a 10 percent increase of broadband penetration triggers a 1.38-3.20 percent 
growth of GDP per capita.  

25 

                                                 
in the Caribbean Catastrophic Risk Insurance Facility (CCRIF). 45 The Bank will also complete 
the on-going Emergency Rehabilitation Loan. 
64. 
The WBG will also support the government to hedge risks related to fuel prices.  
The 2008 oil price spike dramatically increased generation costs and the need for fiscal transfers 
to cover the tariff-cost gap. To address the challenge of fuel price volatility the Government 
would like to strengthen its internal capacity to develop a commodity risk management strategy 
for the energy sector, so that it can approach the market on its own terms to secure appropriate 
hedging instruments. Bank technical assistance will support these efforts and the IFC will 
complement them by possibly mobilizing financing to support a more diversified generation 
matrix via renewables. 

Results Area 4: Promoting equitable, efficient, transparent and sustainable management of 
public resources 

CPS Outcomes: (1) a more efficient, effective, transparent and sustainable management of public 
resources at the national and local level, measured by an improved alignment of actual public 
expenditures with the original approved budget; and, (2) enhanced civil society capacity in 
budget analysis and oversight, measured by an improvement in the Open Budget Index. 
65. 
This CPS will support public finance management reforms aimed at setting up the 
institutional basis for better transparency, equity and efficiency in the allocation and use of 
public funds. The authorities are designing or implementing a number of policy reform 
initiatives, which demonstrates their commitment to greater transparency, openness and equity in 
public policies (e.g., Fiscal Pact, Education Pact, Electricity Pact, Reforma Laboral). Capitalizing 
on research conducted during the previous CPS 46, this CPS proposes to continue building the 
knowledge base to inform government policy and institutional reforms necessary to strengthen 
public finance management, enhance transparency, and improve the sustainability and equity in 
the use of public resources, in partnership with local stakeholders and with donor partners such 
as the EU and IDB. Depending on Government’s appetite, the Bank may also provide support for 
selected measures that strengthen overall fiscal management and fiscal space; the budgetary 
process; the quality of public expenditures and of tax policy; the strength of controls and 
accountability in the execution of public funds; the robustness of financial management, 
procurement and audit systems; the quality and openness of government data; and, finally, 
mechanisms and capacity for civic oversight. If the conditions are appropriate, the Bank might 
consider an Equity DPL to “lock in" important reforms that could make a significant impact on 
equity outcomes. Reforms in this area can foster a culture of transparency and accountability, 
encourage better quality and 
targeting of public services and ensure strong overall 
macroeconomic management to sustain growth and promote shared prosperity. 

45 In the event that a new DRM law, currently under consideration by Congress, is adopted and accompanied by 
significant improvements in the institutional DRM framework, a catastrophic deferred draw-down option (CAT-
DDO) might be included among the disaster risk financing options to be presented to the DR. 
46 See PEFA and PEMFAR reports

Results Area 5: Strengthening social services delivery 

CPS Outcomes:  (1) improved quality of teaching through better teacher policies, measured by 
an increased number of teachers recruited under a new competitive system; (2) improved quality 
of learning through implementation of a robust student assessment system; (3) improved primary 
maternal health care for targeted women, measured by the number of pregnant women in 
selected regions with risk evaluation completed before week 15 of pregnancy; (4) improved 
vaccination rates for children according to quality standards in at least three regions of the 
country; (5) access to improved sanitation services for mostly poor people in the Puerto Plata 
area; (6) improved social protection coverage of, and support to, extremely poor households in 
high poverty provinces; and, (7) increased incomes and employment rates among participants in 
the expanded Temporary Employment Program 
66. 
The CPS will support improvement in the management and delivery of basic social 
services (including education, health, water and sanitation, and social safety nets) with a 
view to reducing vulnerability and enhancing social inclusion. Improving the performance of 
the Dominican education system will require focusing on two core issues: teacher quality and the 
ability to diagnose problem areas and remedy them. Quality health services, especially at the 
primary level (mothers and children), are critical for achieving better health outcomes. Increasing 
access to improved sanitation services and strengthening the policy and institutional framework 
for the water and sanitation sector will lead to better quality and service, with direct positive 
impact on health and welfare. Improving the targeting and expanding the coverage of extremely 
poor households in the social protection programs (including youth) and the services offered to 
them will directly address extreme poverty but also help address inter-generational poverty by 
helping families invest in themselves, in their children and their assets. 
67. 
In the education sector, the Bank will support efforts focused on teacher policies, 
evaluation systems and early childhood development through a new investment lending 
operation. The Bank’s efforts will aim to strengthen the management of the education system by: 
i) strengthening teachers training programs and career development policies; ii) developing a 
comprehensive student evaluation system; iii) strengthening quality assurance standards of Early 
Childhood Development (ECD) institutions; and iv) enhancing the ministry of education’s 
institutional capacity towards school management. The IFC will pursue its engagement with 
Universidad Organización y Método (O&M) and explore demand for further investments. The 
program will also include knowledge, convening and grant support as needed, in partnership 
with the IDB, EU, Spanish cooperation and UNICEF. 
68. 
In the health sector, the Bank will support on-going and proposed health reform to 
further improve access and quality of health services, and develop a strategy to reach the 
informal sector. The Bank will expand the assistance currently provided to primary health care 
in three regions of the country via a results-based financing approach to additional regions. 
Moreover given that most births take place in hospitals, the Bank will pilot the results-based 
financing approach in hospitals, and enhance the coordination between primary health and 
hospital services to improve pregnancy risk management and the quality of care during 
deliveries. The Bank will also support enhancing health sector governance and spending 
efficiency, as well as to strengthen the capacity of the Ministry of Health to manage public health 
emergencies such as the recent outbreaks of cholera and Chikungunya. The elimination of 
cholera from Quisqueya requires cross border collaboration between Haiti and the DR in the 

27 

areas of surveillance, hygiene and prevention campaigns, health prevention and treatment, and 
water and sanitation improvements where needed, especially in rural areas and small towns 
across the Haitian border. 
69. 
Implementing inclusive social protection strategies that address the multiple 
dimensions of extreme poverty and link poor households to economic opportunities will be 
essential to reduce extreme poverty and economic vulnerability in the DR. This approach 
begins with consolidating social safety nets and pursuing active labor market policies. It also 
includes improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the social protection system and 
particularly the flagship safety net Progresando con Solidaridad; pursuing efforts to protect the 
rights of poor and vulnerable Dominicans, including by documenting undocumented citizens; 
supporting a targeted, multi-sectoral approach that links CCT users to productive and service 
opportunities in such areas as entrepreneurship, skills enhancement and housing, thereby creating 
conditions for moderately poor households to exit the CCT; implementing a territorial strategy in 
selected provinces that combines various dimensions of support to targeted households in 
extreme poverty; as well as supporting flexible employment systems for poor unemployed 
persons, that can readily be expanded in times of economic crisis, and employment opportunities 
for poor idle youth. These activities have the potential to mitigate otherwise severe and long-
lasting impacts of shocks on the poor and to build bridges to economic opportunities. They will 
be conducted in partnership with the IDB and other local and external partners, and build on the 
recently closed Youth Employment project 47. The linkages to entrepreneurship may include 
coordination with IFC-supported microfinance institutions. 
Strengthening water and sanitation is fundamental for a healthier population. 
Building on the on-going water project in touristic areas, the Bank will expand its support to the 
sector, which currently faces major challenges related to equal access, quality, sustainability, and 
clear policy direction. Moreover, the outbreak of cholera in Haiti has also spilled over to the 
DR—albeit with a much lower incidence—and solid water and sanitation programs will be 
essential to eliminate cholera and other water-borne diseases from the entire island. An 
assessment of the feasibility of policy reforms would be a key factor in deciding on the nature of 
further support. Water and sanitation should also be better integrated with water resources 
management. A well-targeted water supply and sanitation (WSS) improved access program 
combined with improved policy and institutional framework would have a significant impact on 
health, welfare and competitiveness. The Bank will work in close coordination with other local 
and international stakeholders (including Spain and France).  

70. 

FINANCIAL PORTFOLIO AND EXPOSURE MANAGEMENT 

71. 
The overall financial envelope for the Bank’s engagement is expected to be similar 
to that for the last CPS period, although the balance will shift significantly towards 
investment lending. During FY09-13, the Bank approved US$600 million in new commitments, 
of which US$520 million were through Development Policy Loans (DPLs). These numbers 
compare to plans for US$547 million in total lending during FY09-13, including US$440 million 

47 The youth employment program, combining technical and life skills training with apprenticeships in private firms 
to insert vulnerable youth into the labor force, was highlighted as a success in the 2013 World Development Report 
on Jobs. 

28 

                                                 
via DPLs. This reflects the top priority given to supporting the Government in successfully 
averting an increase in poverty following the global crisis, via a DPL series designed to 
strengthen social protection. During the new CPS period, it is expected that around US$550 
million in new operations will be presented to the Bank’s Board for approval. Actual delivery of 
the lending program will depend on DR's performance, IBRD lending capacity, demand from 
other borrowers, global economic developments and disbursement profiles that keep exposure 
within the country limits (Table 2). The Bank expects to rebuild the program most intensively in 
FY15 to respond to strong demand from the client.  The program will focus on selected areas 
such as modernizing the public sector, improving social services and strengthening key 
infrastructure services for growth and job creation.

The WBG’s contribution to results in the DR in the early years of the new CPS will 
be primarily through the existing portfolio, and managing the implementation of the 
portfolio for results is a key priority. The Bank’s portfolio comprises five projects worth 
US$207.4 million as of August, 2014, with US$78m undisbursed (Table 3). The FY14 
disbursement ratio as of June 2014 has risen to 27 percent, above the LCR average. The Bank is 
currently managing 12 trust funds for a total of US$3.7 million, of which US$2.2 million remain 
to be disbursed.  Project effectiveness and implementation have been slowed down in the past by 
a lengthy approval process in Congress (on average 12 months), weak capacity, and binding 
budget ceilings. Historically, more than one-third of closed projects since 1980 and two out of 
five projects since FY10, have been rated unsatisfactory by IEG. However, quality is expected to 
improve as five project closures remain to be rated by IEG, that are all at least moderately 
satisfactory according to Bank staff assessment. A Country Portfolio Performance Review 
(CPPR) in March 2013 placed emphasis on improving the capacity of implementation units, 
through close implementation support as well as through fiduciary capacity building from the 
country office based team. The Bank has also had an active dialogue with the authorities to 
ensure adequate budgetary ceilings to enable disbursements.  Going forward, the Ministry of 
Economy and the Bank have agreed to meet on a quarterly basis with all implementing units to 
monitor the portfolio and resolve common challenges quickly.

IFC’s committed portfolio currently stands at US$208 million, the second-largest 
IFC program in the Caribbean.  In addition, mobilizations from other partners amounted to 
US$97 million (see Annexes 3 and 6).  New commitments in FY13 reached a record high of 
US$164 million and include flagship transactions such as: (i) a US$100 million equity 
investment in InterEnergy Holdings, a power holding, together with IFC Asset Management 
Company; (ii) a US$30 million loan to Indomina in the Media industry; and (iii) a “Taino Bond”, 
a first US$10 million equivalent local currency bond issue, with proceeds disbursed immediately 
to two mid-size financial institutions providing mortgage loans to low-income households and 
loans to SMEs.  IFC has increased its advisory presence in recent years, notably with regard to 
corporate governance and access to finance. The overall focus of the portfolio is on renewable 
energy, financial inclusion and infrastructure, and recent investments are expected to produce 
new results throughout the new CPS time-frame in terms of energy matrix diversification, job 
creation, and increased access to financing. In the timeframe of this CPS, IFC expects to 
mobilize financing for new investments for an average total annual amount of US$50m per year.  
74. 
Support to the private sector is complemented by a MIGA guarantee approved in 
2006 for US$107.6 million for a toll road to the Northeast of the DR, covering a US$14 million 
equity investment and US$162 million bond issue for MIGA’s client, Autopistas del Nordeste. 

MANAGING RISKS 

75. 
The risks to the successful implementation of the CPS program are substantial. The 
CPS program faces four types of risks: political, capacity, exposure to exogenous shocks, and 
natural disasters risks.   
(i) 
Political economy factors could slow down implementation of reforms. With 
elections coming up in the spring of 2016, the risk that the new administration does not support 
some of the policy priorities promoted under the Bank Group program will need to be mitigated 
through dialogue and flexibility in the program. An important share of the proposed engagements 
addresses areas that are sometimes captured by vested interests, which may hinder the success of 
Bank operations (e.g., education, health, corporate governance, electricity sector). To mitigate 
this risk, the Bank will invest in knowledge services and intensive dialogue with relevant 
stakeholders, notably benchmarking, to support reforms and seek partnerships with champions in 
Government and a wide range of actors in the private sector, civil society and the donor 
community. The IFC will continue to exercise due diligence, emphasize corporate governance 
and apply best practices in environmental management and performance standards.  Ultimately, 
all development solutions require local ownership and implementation, and the WBG will need 
to be very realistic about the change that can be achieved within the CPS period. 
(ii) Weak technical capacity, budgetary constraints and complex procedures for project 
restructuring can affect the implementation of Bank-supported projects. The Bank and the 
Government will work closely together to mitigate the limited technical capacity by: improving 
design and quality at entry, drawing on lessons learned, and increasing the share of results-based 
financing in the portfolio; intensive implementation support, including via missions, local 
fiduciary support via training, and local consultant support in the Country Office for Bank 
projects; frequent portfolio reviews with the client to resolve common issues, and restructuring 
as needed. In light of the importance of restructuring and of delays in the process, the Bank is 
engaging in a dialogue to ensure that the restructuring process can be as streamlined as possible 

30 

moving forward 48. Budgetary constraints represent a challenge for Bank-supported financing to 
the extent that budgetary caps on investments constrain disbursements.  This will be alleviated 
by aligning the program closely with core Government priorities, via support to strengthen the 
quality of public expenditures and an active dialogue on project financing.   
(iii) 
Structural domestic challenges and weaknesses on the external side pose a 
significant risk to the Bank’s ability to achieve results. With large electricity sector deficits, a 
narrow tax base, a growing public sector debt, and a relatively high fiscal deficit, the DR faces 
challenges to sustain growth. On the external side, persistent current account deficits and large 
external financing needs make the economy highly exposed to developments in international 
markets. In addition, changes in the Dominican Republic’s sources of financing for oil could 
result in an increase in fuel import costs and a deterioration of the trade balance as well as 
possible repayment demands putting pressure on reserves. Finally, increasing depreciation 
pressures could at some point generate some market anxiety, especially if the DR’s Central Bank 
is unable to maintain reserve levels above three months of imports. If these risks remain 
unaddressed they could jeopardize the DR’s ability to reduce poverty and improve shared 
prosperity. Mitigation measures are embedded in the CPS program in the form of support to key 
reforms aimed at improving fiscal performance, equity outcomes associated with public 
spending, greater energy efficiency, and better debt management, as well as through support for 
more effective safety nets. 
(iv) Exposure to looming climate variability and climate-related natural disasters could 
also set the country back. The DR is vulnerable to low frequency and high impact natural 
events that have historically been costly to address and which could potentially threaten fiscal 
sustainability and progress towards lower poverty and greater shared prosperity. To mitigate this 
risk, the WBG will support enhanced DRM practices in the country, as well as apply strong 
DRM practices to the investments the WBG will support. In case of major disaster, the Bank 
would make available emergency lending within the overall envelope by reallocating resources.  

48 Recently, interpretation of Government procedures suggested that project restructuring would potentially require 
approval in Congress, which would entail significant implementation delays.

ANNEX 8. CLIENT SURVEY AND STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS 

Client Survey 49 
In January 2013, 505 stakeholders of the World Bank in the DR were invited to share their 
opinions on the Bank’s assistance to the DR via a client survey.  Invitations were sent to persons 
in the offices of the President, the Vice President, Ministers, Congress; the judiciary branch; 
employees of a ministry, ministerial department, or implementation agency; local government 
officials or staff; independent government institutions; consultants/contractors working on Bank-
supported projects/programs; project management units (PMUs); private sector organizations; 
media; NGOs and community-based organizations (CBOs); trade unions; faith-based groups; 
academia/research institutes/think tanks; bilateral and multilateral agencies. A total of 275 
stakeholders responded to the survey (54 percent). Respondents were asked about general issues 
facing the DR; their overall attitudes toward the Bank; the World Bank’s effectiveness and 
results; the Bank’s knowledge work and activities; working with the World Bank; the Bank’s 
future role in the Dominican Republic, and the Bank’s communication and information sharing. 
The FY13 country survey results in the DR suggest an environment where the World Bank has 
created strong and positive relationships to support development efforts on the ground.  The 
findings also demonstrate strong alignment between the perceived development priorities and the 
areas where stakeholders believe the Bank should focus its attention and resources. Key findings 
with implications for the work on the ground include:  
1. Development priorities and the Bank: Perceived development priorities have remained 
constant since the FY09 Country Opinion Survey. Public sector governance, corruption and 
education are top on the minds of stakeholders. Jobs are seen as critical for poverty reduction and 
energy is seen as the top factor for economic growth in the DR. In FY13, respondents indicated 
that education (66 percent) would contribute most to poverty reduction in the DR, followed by 
sustained growth/less inequality (31 percent), lower corruption (25 percent), and more jobs (25 
percent).  Not all country surveys find that stakeholders see a key role for the Bank in areas that 
are top priorities, but in the DR, stakeholders report that the Bank should play a key role in the 
areas considered top development priorities: governance, education, energy and reducing 
corruption, indicating that the Bank has value to add to the most critical issues that the country is 
facing. 
2. How the World Bank operates in the country: Stakeholders have very positive views of the 
way the Bank operates on the ground in the DR. Ratings are very high related to the way the 
World Bank collaborates with government and the respect with which it treats stakeholders. The 
lowest ratings (relatively but not absolutely low) are related to the Bank’s speed, timeliness and 
flexibility.  When asked how the Bank can be of greater value to the country, nearly half added 
that it should reduce the complexity of obtaining financing.   
3. Sectoral effectiveness: While ratings are relatively high for a range of sectoral areas that the 
Bank is involved in, ratings in the DR are relatively low for a few top priority areas that include 
jobs (5.4 on a ten point scale) and anti-corruption (5.3 on a ten point scale). These ratings are 
much lower than those for investment climate (7.1), and a top development priority, public sector

governance (6.9). While ratings are down from FY05 country survey findings in education, 
health and corruption, they are similar to the FY09 ratings (in FY05, a greater share of 
respondents came from ministries where opinion tends to be most positive, often related to 
higher familiarity).  
4. Interactions outside of government: When asked how the Bank can be of greater value in 
the DR, 49 percent of respondents said the Bank should reach out more to groups outside 
government. While ratings for the Bank’s effectiveness at engaging outside of government are 
not low, they are significantly lower than ratings of collaboration with the Government.  
Similarly, while ratings for the Bank’s knowledge products are very high, they are lower for 
stakeholder involvement during their preparation.  Respondents report that the greatest barrier to 
reform in the country is inadequate citizen participation (followed closely by political pressures 
and then inefficiencies of government). In sum, issues related to outreach and citizen 
participation warrant further consideration. 

Stakeholder Consultations 
Extensive consultations were held with civil society in five cities in the DR and with the 
Dominican Diaspora in New York during April 2013, as a key element in shaping the concept 
for the FY15-18 CPS.  Once the concept had been developed, further consultations were held in 
Santo Domingo in June 2014 to reconfirm that the strategy is well aligned with citizens’ 
priorities.   
Methodology: In April 2013, five civil society consultations were held in different cities in the 
DR—Santo Domingo (capital), Dajabón (north-west), Barahona (south-west), La Romana (east), 
and Santiago (north)—as well as with the Dominican community in New York, in order to 
identify priorities and recommendations for the design of the new Country Partnership Strategy. 
More than 250 people in the DR and 27 in New York participated from a variety of civil society 
organizations representing women, youth and student organizations, businesses and business 
associations, handicapped persons, faith groups, academia, labor unions, as well as other non-
government and local government actors.  Approximately one-third of participants in the DR and 
half in New York were women.  The consultations in the DR were facilitated by an independent 
consultant and an NGO, Progressio, while the consultations in New York were facilitated by the 
City University of New York’s Dominican Studies Institute (CUNY’s DSI). 50  The consultations 
focused on two questions: 
 (1) Given the framework set forth in the country’s National Development Strategy, what are the 
main challenges and opportunities that the World Bank should prioritize in its support? 
(2) How should the World Bank address these priority areas in order to support the State and 
Dominican society in achieving development goals? 
Findings: The most important pillar of the END for civil society was social development, 
followed by productive development, 
institutional development and 
lastly sustainable 
development. Within this first pillar, education was identified as a core driver of social and 

50 Findings are reported in full in: (1) “Civil Society Consultations: Final Report” by María del Carmen Tomé 
Valiente, Consultant, June 2013; (2) “Final Report of the Consultations with the World Bank”, CUNY Dominican 
Studies Institute, April 2013; and (3) “Consulta del CPS con Sophie Sirtaine”, Laura Abreu, Consultant, June 2014.

economic change and for all development. Participants asked the Bank to help with school 
infrastructure, and better access, quality and market alignment of education. They stressed the 
need for more inclusive, efficient and better quality health and social security systems, with free 
and guaranteed primary care, as well as protection for children and youth, the elderly and those 
with disabilities. Protecting women’s rights and eradicating gender-based violence through 
education/ awareness campaigns was also stressed. 
Within the productive development pillar, the consultations stressed the need to support MSMEs, 
especially in agribusiness and small-scale local development that links producers to markets. 
They noted the need for investments in logistics infrastructure (warehouses, transportation, etc.), 
and a focus on product quality and higher value-added to complete in global markets. Jobs for 
youth were stressed, together with the urgency need for efficient and cost-effective 
energy/electricity services. 

With regard to institutional development, the consultations highlighted the importance of an 
efficient and transparent public administration system.  There was strong and widespread 
demand for anti-corruption measures that reduce political patronage and impunity, for example 
with regard to public employment, and that strengthen control mechanisms and institutions 
promoting accountability. CSOs also proposed deepening democracy through civic oversight and 
requested the continuation of IPAC and support for empowering and building civil society 
capacity for monitoring the major government/society pacts (education, electricity and fiscal 
reform). 

With regard to sustainable development, participants supported more environment-friendly 
policy reforms, reforestation campaigns, renewable energy investments, recycling, and more 
responsible mining (and in one case, no mining).  DRM was also highlighted given the 
vulnerability to disasters.  
While fewer suggestions emerged on how the Bank should engage, participants worried about 
the government’s capacity to properly spend funds provided by the Bank and other multilateral 
organizations. They suggested strict control over the use of loan proceeds and urged compliance 
with commitments and expected results to prevent funds being used for clientelistic purposes.   
Some difference in areas of priority emerged by location.  For example, in Santiago, the top 
priority was social development, i.e. equal rights and opportunities for all, education and health, 
eliminating gender violence (sexual abuse and feminicides) and lowering maternal mortality.  In 
Dajabón, participants focused primarily on production: support for small agribusiness producers 
(TA, microcredit, training, etc.); job creation, especially for women and youth; and better quality 
health and education.  In Barahona, the focus was also on productive development, followed by 
social sectors, especially education (ECD and youth training for jobs) and health.  Citizen 
security and immigration issues were also cited as priority areas.  In La Romana, institutional 
strengthening and social accountability emerged as priorities.  In Santo Domingo, fighting 
corruption and impunity was seen as fundamental, together with fiscal reform, citizen 
engagement, judicial reform, energy sector reform and better quality education.  In New York, 
fighting corruption, linking small producers to global markets and improving the quality of 
health and education were emphasized.

Gender-disaggregated data for consultations in Barahona, La Romana and Santo Domingo 
pointed to similar patterns for women as for men with regard to productive and sustainable 
development, with a larger difference in terms of the emphasis placed by women versus men on 
institutional and social development: women were more likely to stress the need to control 
corruption and men were more likely to stress the need for education and opportunities for youth. 
These overall findings were ratified in consultations led by the Country Director in Santo 
Domingo in June 2014 with 15 business and civil society, academic and business organizations 
representing a wide range of civil society actors and interests.   Participants welcomed the 
presentation of the CPS diagnostic and proposed program, and emphasized the need for fiscal 
reform, 
transparency and accountability, strengthening civil society, supporting SME 
development and job creation, and electricity reform.  They welcomed the Bank’s knowledge 
and convening support. 

Overall, the CPS consultations confirmed the priority of the five core objectives of the proposed 
CPS, and of support in key areas like education, health, employment, public sector 
modernization and electricity reform.  They also confirmed the important of knowledge and 
convening services as complements to the Bank Group’s financing.  The consultations genuinely 
guided the WBG strategy in that they not only ratified priorities discussed with Government, but 
led directly to the inclusion of support for strengthening agricultural value chains, which had not 
been considered prior to the consultations.  Thus the CPS consultations were a valuable 
complement to the findings of the END, (which itself was based on extensive nation-wide 
consultations), in guiding the WBG’s strategy.

ANNEX 9. PARTNERSHIPS  

Donor coordination has grown in strength as a result of a number of initiatives.   First, there 
has been close coordination among several donor partners around recent and on-going dialogue 
processes, including IPAC, IDEC and the CGF.  Second, the Bank serves as coordinator for a 
monthly exchange of information among donor partners.  Third, donor agencies have prepared a 
matrix of donor support aligned around the objectives of the END that identifies support by END 
objective, type of engagement, region, year and counterpart agency, among others.  This has 
proven valuable to MEPYD and other GODR agencies and to donors themselves in harmonising 
and aligning support. Fourth, donor partners have gathered around key themes and sectors (see 
Table). Each group is led by donors that play a key role in the respective area.  Each group is 
drawing up a matrix that builds a consensus on key challenges and policy recommendations for 
the sector as well as detailed disaggregation of donor support to ensure harmonized support.  
Finally, donors are supporting GODR’s efforts to resume government-led donor coordination 
tables by sector, which had fallen into disuse.  The overall aim is to achieve more transformative, 
pro-poor change through effective partnerships.   

While the Bank coordinates with a wide range of donors, some partnerships have been 
especially important for the Bank’s work in the DR.  These include partnerships with: (1) the 
European Union and USAID notably on governance issues, with the Bank implementing grant 
resources from these partners and coordinating policy discussions in these areas closely with 
them; (2) the IMF, in relation to macroeconomic management and financial sector soundness; (3) 
the UN system in various human development areas; and (4) important bilateral donors such as 
France and Spain in selected areas of basic infrastructure.  However, the most wide-ranging 
partnership by scope and volume is with the IDB, the largest multilateral donor in the DR, whose 
strategic objective is to promote growth that is compatible with the generation of quality jobs to 
enable a sustained reduction in poverty.  The Bank and IDB are coordinating their strategies 
closely over the next four years and jointly supporting several areas, including the electricity 
sector, social protection, active labour market policies, education, and public financial 
management reforms.

ANNEX 10. THE CARIBBEAN GROWTH FORUM (CGF) IN THE DOMINICAN 
REPUBLIC 
The Dominican Republic Chapter of the CGF was launched in November 2012 under the 
coordination of the Minister of Economy, Planning and Development during an event with the 
participation of more than 170 participants from public, private and civil society sector. Other 
Government 
institutions 
involved are: Ministry of Industry and Commerce, National 
Competitiveness Council and the Ministry of the Presidency. Other donors involved included: 
the Inter-American Development Bank, the IFC, the European Union, the Canadian International 
Development Agency, the French Agency for Development, the Spanish Agency for 
International Cooperation, the German Embassy, the United States Agency for International 
Development and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. 
Following the launch, three working groups (Logistics and Connectivity; Investment Climate; 
Skills and Productivity) elaborated priority actions papers, that were delivered to the MEPYD on 
December 20, 2012 and subsequently placed on-line 51 for open consultation for one month. Over 
700 representatives of the private sector and civil society provided feedback. The final version 
was posted online on February 11, 2013. The three working groups prioritized in total 14 
objectives and 77 concrete actions. About 300 people participated in the elaboration of the action 
papers, of which 44 percent were from the public sector, 43 percent from the private sector and 
13 percent from the civil society, academia and cooperation agencies.  
Key reforms implemented during the first six months of the process include: 
• Investment Climate: Presidential Decree 164-13 that stimulates the participation of 
SMEs in public procurement; development of the procurement e-portal and the creation 
of social oversight commissions for public procurement; the Superintendent of Securities 
has started developing the “Draft Law on the Securities Market 19-00”; legal reforms of 
the Customs Act, Law 28-01, the Company Law, the Bankruptcy Law, the Reciprocal 
Guarantees Act, the Factoring and Leasing Act, the Secured Transactions Law and the 
Law for the restructuring of the Ministry of Industry, Trade and SMEs; launching of the 
“Formalizate.gob.do” one-stop shop by the Vice-Ministry of SMEs to facilitate 
registration of new businesses in the National Office for Intellectual Property, the 
Chamber of Trade and Production and the General Directorate for Tax Administration; 
approval of a law to allow the placement of a new financing instrument for SMEs, the 
“Closed Fund for Business Development”, and the establishment of a Guarantee Fund 
and a Fund for Financing SMEs with support from the Government. 
• Logistics and Connectivity: development of the plan for the improvement of cross-border 
trade with Haiti; development of a Master Plan for Logistics to position the country as a 
regional hub; measures to reduce informality at the border with Haiti and the launching of 
the Electricity Pact process; a National and Regional Observatory on Freight and 
Logistics; improvement of the connectivity plans to improve access to the ports of 
Caucedo and Puerto Plata by means of developing ring-roads around Santo Domingo and 
Santiago.

• Skills and Productivity: The Ministry of Industry and Commerce has initiated large 
capacity building programs for SMEs and public officials on quality control, occupation 
health and safety, and management; measures promoting SMEs’ access to public 
procurement for the provision of goods and services at both central and municipal levels. 
In addition the CGF has led to the signature of an inter-ministerial agreement for the 
coordination of policies aiming to improve the investment climate and to the establishment of an 
independent Observatory composed of more than 15 organizations from private sector, academia 
and civil society to monitor the implementation of the reforms in the months to come, showing 
that coordination and accountability are centerpiece of this administration.

ANNEX 11. GENDER NOTE 

Gender equality in the Dominican Republic has improved in the last decades along several 
dimensions such as education, health, and female political representation and the policy and legal 
framework and institutions have also advanced towards ensuring equal rights and opportunities 
for men and women. However, there are still many challenges, particularly for women, in 
obtaining sufficient levels of autonomy, participating actively as citizens and accessing a range 
of human development opportunities. 
Legal and Institutional Framework: The Dominican Republic has adopted and committed to a 
number of international treatises, passed national legislation, and created policies and 
institutions, that aim to reduce inequality among men and women. The country’s Constitution, 
revised in 2010, contains ample mention of gender equality and women’s rights and the state’s 
responsibility in ensuring these. Nevertheless, Article 37 which outlaws abortion under any 
circumstances is viewed by many as a limitation on women fully exercising their sexual and 
reproductive rights. The National Development Strategy 2010-2030 Law includes the gender 
perspective as one of its cross-cutting pillars. The Municipal Law establishes a mandatory 4 
percent of local government budgets destined to fund gender-focused activities (although rarely 
enforced). The Ministry of Women’s Affairs was created in 1999 and now has 52 provincial and 
municipal law and a presidential decree instructed all state agencies and ministries to create an 
internal Office for Gender Equality and Development. Despite these institutional strides, the 
budget assigned to the Ministry is one of the lowest in all of the Government which significantly 
constrains its operations. 
Poverty and Gender: Several different sources indicate that women are generally poorer than 
men in the Dominican Republic. CEPAL, a research center for Latin American studies, has 
published studies that show that despite sustained economic growth, female poverty rates exceed 
regional averages, even more so in rural areas. It also notes a strong correlation between women-
headed households and poverty. The Social Protection Unique Beneficiary System’s database 
contains 840,817 poor households, 65 percent of which are headed by women. The level of 
autonomy for women, as measured by disposing of personal income, is an indicator that reflects 
the difficulties and barriers faced by women to earn income through labor market activities, 
access to property or credit, etc. In 2010, 14 percent of men aged 15 years or older had no 
personal income, whereas the percentage rises to 32.6 percent for women in this segment of the 
population. 
Access and Quality of Social Services: The National Office for Statistics (ONE) estimates that 
13 percent of the population in 2010 did not read or write. This and many other indicators point 
to the dire situation for education in the Dominican Republic. When seen from a gender 
perspective, the data show there is a gender gap in favor of women in this area. More women 
than men enroll in the educational system at all levels, and the tendency reveals that the gap 
widens as the level of education rises. Studies show that 62 percent of university enrolment is 
female, while they remain a minority in vocational/technical institutes. This denotes occupational 
segregation by gender which responds to cultural prejudices and stereotypes in terms of which 
careers are traditionally suitable for men or women. In many cases, women study careers that are 
socially less valued and with lower remuneration. Although the State looks to address these 
issues in National Education Ten-Year Plan which establishes gender equality as one of the main 

52 

 
 
Dominican Republic: Country Partnership Strategy FY10-13 – Completion Report 

values to be instilled in the pre-primary, primary and secondary school system, gender matters 
were not taken into account in its Higher Education Ten-Year Plan. 
Investment in the health sectors has also been traditionally low in the Dominican Republic. Of 
notable progress in the last decade was the new Social Security System in which public health 
insurance coverage increased from 7.2 percent in 2003 to 53.3 percent of the population in 2013.  
The main patterns of causes of death have been changing as the country transitions from the 
prevalence of transmittable diseases to non-transmittable.  The main causes of death for women 
are circulatory system related (39.9 percent), tumors/growths (16.1 percent), transmittable 
diseases (9 percent) or other (7 percent).  
Basic health indicators such as maternal and child mortality as well as child malnutrition have 
shown limited improvement and will fall short of the Millennium Development targets. High 
maternal and child mortality persist despite high coverage of prenatal care (94.5 percent of 
pregnant women attend at least four medical visits), and a high percentage of births in health 
centers and with medical assistance (95 percent). This can be partly explained by the low quality 
of services, where two-thirds of deaths are directly caused by obstetrics (toxemia, hemorrhage, 
etc.) The overall panorama is worsened when one considers that women do not have the option 
to abort and have very little access to contraceptives and family planning services. An additional 
factor to note is the high levels of adolescent pregnancies. Overall rates of fertility have slightly 
decreased from 2.7 children per mother in 2008 to 2.5 children in 2011, still above the regional 
average (2.37), and the fertility rate for adolescents is alarmingly high at 106.8 births for every 
1,000 women aged between 15 and 19 in 2010, more than twice the regional average. 
Labor and Employment: The Dominican labor market is characterized by persistent gender 
inequality with significant differences in the level of participation, access, occupational 
segregation, salary inequality and the absence of measures that address the need for women to 
reconcile their family and work lives. The percentage of global participation in the labor force is 
65 percent for men and 48.8 percent for women. That being said, the female economically active 
population has slightly increased due to several factors: economic growth, lower fertility rates, 
higher schooling rates, new cultural patterns of inclusion, and the need for two household 
incomes to cope with inflation and declining real wages, among others. 
The unemployment rate for women is twice that of men (over 20 percent). A condition that is 
worse in the young population where young women are particularly vulnerable despite receiving 
more school than their male peers – this may be attributable to the economy’s deficiency in the 
creation of new jobs to absorb the economically active population. 
An important occupational segregation exists – women are employed mainly in services 
(community and social services, health and education, and hospitality) whereas men participate 
for the most part in commerce, agriculture, manufactures, transportation and communication. 
Both men and women are increasingly working in the informal sectors (60.3 percent of men and 
50.8 percent of women in 2011) where they have little job security or access to social protection. 
Gender-based Violence 
Gender-based violence is one of the main human rights violation issues in the Dominican 
Republic which affects primarily women. This phenomenon is not only a public health issue and 
barrier to human development, but also one of the main causes of death for women aged 15-49. 
The National Household Survey (ENDESA 2007) revealed that 1 out of every 5 women older 

53 

 
Dominican Republic: Country Partnership Strategy FY10-13 – Completion Report 

than 15 years of age had been a victim of physical violence at some time, and the risks of 
suffering physical or sexual violence are higher during childhood and adolescence – most 
women reported being raped for the first time when they were between 15 and 19 years old. 
Women who have had fewer economic and educational opportunities and women who are 
employed tend to be more prone to gender-based violence. In 2012, 196 cases of feminicides 
were reported, occurring mainly in urban areas (Santiago, La Vega, Santo Domingo, San 
Cristobal), 65 percent of which were murders with firearms or bladed weapons. 
The Attorney General reported 72,199 reports of gender-based violence in its Special units for 
Violence Against Women. However, the judicial system does not have the requisite capacity and 
structure in order to attend to all reports in an efficient and timely manner. In 2012, a bill was 
presented to Congress for the prevention, attention to, sanctioning and eradication of violence 
against women but has yet to be passed. 
Political Participation and Representation 
Female participation in the country’s political system has increased somewhat. In the Congress 
as well as local governments, the Dominican Republic has a quota system that establishes 
minimum numbers of female candidates (33 percent) – which has yet to be met. The number of 
women in the Chamber of Deputies has increased but still low at 20.8 percent, whereas in the 
Senate, female participation has been even lower with 3 out of 32 positions. The resulting overall 
percentage of participation in the legislative branch falls below the 33 percent established by law 
and the regional average of 23 percent (2011). At the local level, participation is even lower with 
only 7 percent of municipal governments headed by women, below the regional average of 10 
percent. Out of 21 national ministries, only 3 are led by women and are usually related to 
socially assigned roles (education, women’s affairs) although recently the Minister of Labor 
witnessed the appointment of a female leader. Within the Executive Branch, it is important to 
mention that Vice President and director of the Social Cabinet which manages all of the 
executive branch’s social programs is a woman. The judicial branch participation shows 
improvement with the proportion of women judges increasing from 36.8 percent in 1999 to 50 
percent in 2010.

ANNEX 12. MILLENNIUM DEVELOPMENT GOALS (MDGS) IN THE DOMINICAN 
REPUBLIC 
There has been progress towards the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) but 
challenges remain especially with regards to poverty, health and gender. The DR has 
achieved MDG2 with universal access to primary education. Good progress has also been made 
with regards to MDG4 as child mortality reduced by nearly two thirds between 1990 and 2013 
from 60 to 27 per 1,000 births. The objective of reducing the share of the population without 
access to safe water and sanitation by half is assessed as having been met well ahead of the 2015 
deadline. On MDG7, the country’s forest cover is estimated to have risen by almost 7 percentage 
points to 39.7 percent during 2003-11, although deforestation in Haiti and a growing cross-
border charcoal trade represent challenges for this indicator.  Further, good progress was made 
on MDG8, notably with regard to expanding cellphone and internet coverage (to 90 and 40 
percent, respectively, by 2010).  However, decrease in poverty has been insufficient to reach the 
target (MDG1), while the DR is also lagging behind on health and gender MDGs. Between 1990 
and 2012, maternal mortality rate 
(MMR) estimates decreased from 
220 to 150 per 100,000 live births 
but 
remain much higher 
than 
countries with similar or 
lower 
incomes (an average of 80 in LCR 
in 2010). Ministry of Health audits 
point to deficiencies in services as 
the 
leading cause of maternal 
mortality. On MDG6, 
both 
tuberculosis (TB) 
incidence and 
HIV prevalence in the 15-49 age 
group decreased to 62 and 0.7 
respectively 
in 2012. Cholera, 
which broke out 
in 
the DR 
following the outbreak in Haiti in 
2011, decreased significantly from 
20,851 in 2011 to 7,919 in 2012 and 
the cholera mortality rate dropped 
from 3.46 in 2011 to 0.67/100,000 
inhabitants 
in 
2012. 
Non-
communicable diseases 
(NCDs) 
have emerged now emerged as the 
leading 
causes 
of 
death.52 
Controlling dengue and malaria, and 
more recently chikungunya, remain 
important challenges for the DR.

I. Introduction   

1. The Country Partnership Strategy Completion Report (CPSCR) assesses the joint 
IBRD/IFC’s assistance program in Dominican Republic (DR) over the period July 1, 2009 to 
June 30, 2013. 53 Specifically, the report briefly describes progress on country outcomes and the 
Bank’s contributions to these, evaluates the achievements of CPS program outcomes, assesses 
World Bank Group performance in terms of the design and implementation of the program and 
draws lessons and recommendations for the preparation of the upcoming CPS (FY15-FY18).   

2. This CPSCR concludes that overall progress towards achieving CPS outcomes was 
Moderately Satisfactory.  Of the four Strategic Objectives (or pillars) under the CPS, three were 
rated Satisfactory or Moderately Satisfactory, while the fourth was rated Unsatisfactory, and the 
majority of the fifteen CPS outcomes were either achieved (six) or mostly achieved (two), while 
five outcomes were partially achieved and two outcomes were not achieved.  Bank performance 
in designing and managing the implementation of the CPS program is rated as Good.  
Moreover, during the CPS period, the World Bank Group supported the successful piloting of a 
range of initiatives that generated notable results for the citizens reached and are setting the 
strategic direction for lasting institutional transformations and changes in behaviors in such 
areas as social protection, primary healthcare services, reducing electricity distribution losses, 
civic engagement, and deepening access to finance.  Activities under this CPS have thus set 
important foundations for future advances that are not fully captured in the results measured 
for this CPS period. 

II. Country Level Development Objectives 

3. At the start of the CPS Period in 2009, following strong growth in the previous two 
decades, the DR faced important challenges that threatened the prospects for continued rapid 
progress. 54  The main sources of vulnerability included a difficult fiscal situation worsened by 
the global economic financial crisis; high levels of poverty and inequality and limited capacity 
to implement counter-cyclical social policies; and competitiveness challenges due to a great 
extent to an inefficient energy sector and low skills levels.  Moreover, the limited ability of 
public institutions to produce demonstrable results was leading to low and declining trust in 
Government.   

4. In this context, the Government prepared the Dominican Republic’s National 
Development Strategy (END). The Bank played an important role in this process, providing TA 
in the definition of objectives and indicators, benchmarking information and international best 
practices.   

5. Important advances towards reaching the country’s development objectives have been 
achieved since the early start of END implementation. 55  A national dialogue on corruption 

53 The FY10-13 CPS was discussed by the Board of Executive Directors in September 2009 and 
revised in the CPS Progress Report, dated December 21, 2011. 
54 See the Dominican Republic – Country Partnership Strategy FY10-13.  Report No. R2009-0208,

under the Participatory Anti-Corruption Initiative (IPAC) was put in place and a range of 
follow-on actions such as a Citizen’s Portal for budget transparency, helped improve the Open 
Budget Index for the DR. The system for procurement of medicines by the National Health 
System strengthened transparency and cost efficiency thus generating significant savings and 
quality improvements. The coverage, targeting and conditioning of social safety net transfers 
was strengthened and the coverage of Subsidized National Health Insurance was expanded to 
provide better safety nets for the poor and vulnerable. A National Pact for Education and the 
expansion of Early Childhood Development programs is focusing on improving quality of 
education and education outcomes. Some of the Bank’s contributions to achieving progress on 
the client’s development objectives are described in the next section together with progress 
against CPS outcomes and Strategic Objectives. 

III. CPS Program Performance 

6.  The WBG CPS was closely aligned with the END. While the END covers four pillars with 
19 general objectives, 57 specific objectives and 90 key performance indicators, the WBG’s CPS 
focused on supporting a selected set of the Government’s agenda.  Under the END’s pillar of 
institutional development, the objectives that the WBG’s CPS sought to support accountability 
and efficiency of public resource utilization, and participatory policy formulation.  Under the 
END’s social development pillar, the CPS sought to support access to quality health services, 
access to better quality education, protecting the country’s vulnerable population and 
strengthening the capacity of local governments.  Under the productive development pillar of 
the END, the Bank Group’s CPS sought to support the objectives of improving competitiveness 
and putting in place basic infrastructure for a better business enabling environment.  Finally, 
under the sustainable development pillar, the WBG focused on improving the capacity for 
disaster risk management. 

7. The combination of financial, knowledge and convening services brought to bear by the 
World Bank Group contributed to significant results for citizens and successfully piloted a 
range of initiatives that set the strategic direction for lasting institutional transformations.  
These include the successful implementation of results-based financing for primary health care, 
shifting the Bank’s support e.g. from purchasing vaccines to ensuring that children are 
vaccinated according to quality protocols, thus realigning incentives towards quality and 
results, and Government is expanding this methodology throughout the health care system.  
Similarly, the successful implementation of social compacts with citizens in poor neighborhoods 
to reduce electricity losses by rewarding high electricity cost recovery with 24 hour service has 
proven extremely successful in the project areas supported by the Bank, and the electricity 
utilities are expanding this approach across the networks with multi-donor support.  The 
significant expansion in coverage, targeting and conditioning of cash transfers under the social 
safety net to over 90 percent of the extreme poor identified in the targeting database, has 
enabled the government to achieve significant reductions in vulnerability of the poor at a low 
cost (0.5 percent of GDP), and poverty rates barely rose following the 2008-09 global crisis, 
when compared to the earlier financial crisis in the DR.  The Participatory Anti-Corruption 
Initiative brought together public, private and civil society actors to address the perceptions of 
weakening controls of corruption and to prioritize actions to strengthen governance and 
transparency.  Its model of citizen engagement and oversight of agreements to ensure they were 
indeed fulfilled spurred a successful approach that was subsequently adopted in the education 
sector through the Dominican Initiative for Quality Education (IDEC) and in the broader 

58 

 
Dominican Republic: Country Partnership Strategy FY10-13 – Completion Report 

Caribbean through the Caribbean Growth Forum (CGF).  Finally, IFC’s trailblazing local 
currency Taino Bond issue not only contributed to a far broader set of investments by IFC that 
has greatly increased the number of poor in the DR with access to finance, but also spurred the 
creation of a brand new market for five year fixed term SME and housing loans, thereby greatly 
reducing risks for borrowers.   

8. The overarching objective of the FY10-13 CPS was to support the country in reducing its 
vulnerability to internal and external factors while producing results for its citizens.  The 
strategy sought to “give special emphasis to protecting the poor while enhancing 
competitiveness and strengthening public institutions for performance accountability in the 
country.” The CPS had four Strategic Objectives: (i) strengthen social cohesion and improve 
access to and the quality of social services; (ii) promote competitiveness in a sustainable and 
resilient economic environment; (iii) enhance the quality of public expenditures and 
institutional development; and (iv) build capacity and constituencies for reform. Achievements 
were uneven across the Strategic Objectives: the first objective, which received the vast majority 
of the FY10-13 lending program, was the most successful and was rated satisfactory, with the 
majority of its outcomes achieved. The second Strategic Objective was the least successful with 
various outcomes partially achieved or not achieved. The third and fourth Strategic Objectives 
saw moderately satisfactory progress towards achievement of related outcomes. Overall out of 
a total of fifteen CPS outcomes, six were achieved, two were mostly achieved, five were 
partially achieved, and two were not achieved.  Overall, the CPS performance is rated of 
Moderately Satisfactory.

Strategic Objective 1: Strengthen Social Cohesion and Improve Social Services; Rating: 
Satisfactory 

9. The first Strategic Objective of the FY10-FY13 Country Partnership Strategy focused on 
strengthening social cohesion and improving access to and quality of social services.  It 
placed greater emphasis on the social sectors than the previous CPS had, so as to protect 
vulnerable segments of the population in light of the global crisis. A combination of lending 
programs supported the achievement of results under this objective.  These included a new 

59 

 
 
  
  
  
  
  
  
 
 
Dominican Republic: Country Partnership Strategy FY10-13 – Completion Report 

programmatic DPL series for the social sectors (Performance and Accountability of Social 
Sectors – PASS 1, 2 &3), a Public Finance and Social Sector DPL, Additional Financing to the 
Social Sectors Investment Program (PIPS), the Second Phase of the Health Sector Reform APL 
(PARSS2), as well as the ongoing Early Childhood Education and Youth Development SILs. The 
Bank complemented this with a Programmatic Social Sector NLTA throughout the CPS period 
to support the social sector reform agenda, together with other services such as the CCT 
(Solidaridad) Impact Assessment.  IFC investments in health, education and access to finance 
yielded results that complemented those achieved via Bank engagements. Overall, three of four 
CPS outcomes under this Strategic Objective were achieved, while the fourth was mostly 
achieved, leading to an overall rating of Satisfactory for this Strategic Objective. 

10. Outcome 1: Improved quality of mother and child healthcare services, was mostly 
achieved.  This reflects that two of the three indicators were surpassed or mostly achieved, 
while the third was not achieved, although it is on track for 2015. During the CPS period, the 
number of pregnant women in Regions VI and VIII of the DR with a risk evaluation completed 
before the 15th week of pregnancy, based on national protocols, rose from 0.43 percent to 18.8 
percent, more than half way towards a target of 30 percent, and progress continues to be made 
following the CPS period.  The share of children under 15 months of age with completed 
vaccination scheme required by national protocols rose from a baseline of 0 percent to 46.7 
percent by 2013, versus a target of 40 percent.  Moreover, since there are many doctors who still 
do not systematically register data in the Clinical Management System (CMS), the real increases 
are believed to be underestimated. 56  Regional Health Service Centers in two pilot regions 
assisted by the Bank did produce significantly higher registrations of CMS data compared to 
other regions, but as yet no region is producing monthly reports using the Single Management 
System of Medicines and Inputs (SUGEMI), so this indicator was not achieved as of the end of 
the CPS period.  However, the system has been designed and the Health Reform APL 2 targets 
these reports to be generated using the SUGEMI as of 2015.  The maternal health and 
vaccination results were obtained via a results based financing mechanism designed under the 
Bank’s APL2 that has created incentives for better behaviors among primary healthcare services 
by linking transfers to results and to quality (through compliance with protocols).  Indeed, 
Government plans to extend this methodology to eight regions of the country with Bank and 
IDB support, and has requested Bank support under the new CPS to introduce the methodology 
to the hospital system.  In addition to the above targeted outcomes, IFC investments in Hospiten 
hospitals translated into services for over 130,000 patients (of which 80,225 were women) and 
support for 452 jobs, 76 percent of which (345 jobs) were held by women. 

11. Outcome 2: Increased access to and quality of education, was achieved. The Early 
Childhood Development project, together with the PASS DPL Series and Programmatic Social 
Sector NLTA supported GODR in achieving noticeable advances towards country development 
goals in this area. Verification under the CCT program shows that enrollment rates among 
children of beneficiary families reached 96 percent in 2012 for children in primary education 
(surpassing the original target of 85 percent), although enrollment for CCT-beneficiaries’ 
children in secondary education was reportedly lower at 32 percent in 2012 than the 42 percent 

56 Targets for these two indicators were revised with the establishment in 2011 (after the CPS was 
launched) of the Clinical Management System used to gather the data, and aligned with 
targets set in the Health Reform APL 2.  

60 

 
                                                 
Dominican Republic: Country Partnership Strategy FY10-13 – Completion Report 

rate in 2009, possibly due to challenges of data comparability around this indicator. The 
verification also demonstrated that attendance rates for beneficiary children enrolled in primary 
school reached 94.2 percent in 2012, up from 93.7 percent in 2009, while attendance for CCT 
beneficiary children enrolled in secondary education rose from 87.1 percent in 2009 to 93.5 
percent in 2012. Furthermore, early childhood education enrollment rates of the poorest 5-year-
olds increased from 51 percent to 71.3 percent for the lowest quintiles, exceeding the 69 percent 
target. 57 The ECD project built and furnished classrooms and provided learning materials, 
earning support from parents who were more willing to enroll their children due to the 
improvements. The Bank also supported the introduction of new student evaluation standards 
for: pre-primary education (ECD), the first cycle of Basic Education, the second cycle of basic 
education and secondary education. The Bank, along with other donors, supported the Iniciativa 
Dominicana para una Educación de Calidad (IDEC), a dialogue among Government, private and 
civil society actors to prioritize and monitor actions to improve the quality of education with the 
increased funding available (4 percent of GDP), that was an essential precursor to the very 
successful conclusion of a National Pact for Education, for which the Bank provided technical 
support.  IFC support complemented these results via a $20 million investment to support 
private university outreach to mid/low-income families via Universidad OM.  

12. Outcome 3: improved coverage and quality of social protection programs, was achieved. 
Again through a mix of instruments that included the PIPS, PASS DPLs, and the Programmatic 
Social Sectors NLTA, the Bank supported the Government in achieving the country 
development goal of protecting the country’s vulnerable population through a major increase in 
the percentage of households in extreme poverty covered by Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT) 
programs.  These increased from 51 percent in 2009 to 91 percent in 2011, surpassing the target 
of 85 percent. The number of households receiving conditional cash transfers more than 
doubled from 228,052 in 2005 to 622,537 in December 2011.  Another benefit, for which no 
targets were set in the CPS, but represents a good indicator of strengthened social protection 
programs is that the share of transfers that were conditioned rose to 70 percent during this 
period.  The projects furthermore contributed to quality improvements in the CCT programs by, 
for example, updating the country’s national targeting system (SIUBEN) and broadening its 
coverage to transfers beyond Solidaridad. The program also helped to provide national identity 
documents to 201,000 people by 2013, which has given them access not only to social programs 
but to a wide range of opportunities, such as the ability to avoid restrictions to education for 
their children, to register marriages and property and to access formal financial services.  
Finally, beneficiary assessments (which previously did not exist) were conducted through 
scorecards and customer satisfaction studies to assess the quality of attention and service of the 
CCT programs. They reveal that Solidaridad beneficiaries are mostly satisfied or very satisfied 
with health services, education benefits, the welfare service provider network, CCT service 
personnel and community liaisons. Looking forward, CCT program funding has been ensured 
as social protection planning was included in the approved Multi-Annual National Public 
Investment Plan 2011-2014, and transfers have been in line with budgeted amounts 

57 The target was lowered from 86 percent to 69 percent in a formal 2010 restructuring of the 
ECD project in light of dramatic increases in the cost of construction materials (cf. ICR Report No. 
ICR00002039).  The 20 percentage point increase in ECD enrollment still represents a significant 
increase in opportunities for the poorest 5-year-olds.

13. IFC contributed via the development of private sector solutions for the poor. In response 
to the global crisis, IFC focused on serving underserved market segments via financial inclusion 
(“including the excluded”) for microenterprises and SMEs, women in rural areas, and 
mortgages for low income households to enable them to increase incomes, smoothen 
consumption and upgrade their living conditions.  Through its support to ADOPEM, IFC 
financing and Advisory Services supported close to 200,000 loans for over $100 million and the 
opening of over $14 million in savings accounts primarily for low-income people, 80 percent of 
whom are women.  At end-2012, IFC’s clients Banco BHD and Adopem had a total of 409,000 
MSME loans outstanding worth $619 million.  Moreover, to broaden its impact on MSMEs and 
low income housing finance, IFC applied innovative instruments in the DR, such as the IFC 
Capitalization Fund – managed by the IFC Asset Management Company (US$25 million for 
MSMEs with BHD), and the Taino Bond. 58 IFC issued the Taino Bond in December 2012 for 
RD$390 million (around $10 million), with proceeds directly on-lent to local financial 
intermediaries (La Nacional and FONDESA), thereby expanding access to long term finance for 
micro, small, and medium enterprises and creating an unprecedented five-year fixed rate 
mortgage for low income households in the DR.  The Government is now looking to 
microfinance, entrepreneurship support and housing support as key elements of a strategy to 
graduate poor people out of safety nets to economic self-reliance, and has requested WBG 
support in this area. 

14. Outcome 4: improved the employability of poor at-risk youth was achieved. In this respect, 
the Youth Development Project, trained 35,800 youths (exceeding the project’s targets) through 
the Ministry of Labor’s youth training program “Juventud y Empleo” in both life skills and 
technical skills, with training linked to internships. Via this project, tThe Ministry of Labor also 
created a pilot temporary employment program “Santiago Trabaja”, which reached 4,335, 
exceeding the target of 4,000 beneficiaries. Additionally, INFOTEP, the National Institute for 
Technical and Vocational Training, successfully delivered 400 learning courses for at-risk youth. 
Moreover, the final impact assessment indicates that at least 65 percent of beneficiaries are 
employed or self-employed 6 months after graduation exceeding  the target for the indicator; a  
( a follow-up survey showed that 71.8 percent of the 2008-09 cohort was employed, 59 so the 
outcome is considered as having been achieved. 

Strategic Objective 2: Promote Competitiveness in a Sustainable and Resilient Economic 
Environment;  Rating: Unsatisfactory 

15. The CPS’ second Strategic Objective aimed to promote competitiveness in a sustainable 
and resilient economic environment. The World Bank and IFC supported this Strategic 
Objective with a blend of lending and non-lending support.  The Bank’s lending program 
included an Electricity Distribution and Rehabilitation SIL, a Power Sector Technical Assistance 
Loan (TAL), an Emergency Recovery and Disaster Management Loan, a Water and Sanitation in 
Tourist Areas APL, an Energy Sector TAL and a Financial Sector TAL. In addition, the Bank 
delivered a host of non-lending services including the Treasury’s Country Banking Services, a 
Dominican Republic-Haiti Quisqueya Growth and Poverty report, support for DR Living 
Standards Measurement and for the DR National Strategy for the Development of Statistics, a 

58 This was the first domestic placement by an international triple-A rated issuer in the DR.

Dominican Republic: Country Partnership Strategy FY10-13 – Completion Report 

Poverty and Inequality NLTA and DR Index Insurance Regulatory and Policy Capacity 
Building, and Policy Notes. IFC contributed to this strategic objective via its investments in 
energy (including investments in the Línea Clave natural gas distributor and a Sustainable 
Energy credit line for Banco BHD); tourism and trade (expansion of the Punta Cana airport and 
Caucedo Port, and a trade finance credit line for Banco León) and telecommunications 
(expansion of WIND Telecom). The Multilateral International Guarantee Agency (MIGA) also 
supported the country’s competitiveness by continuing to provide political risk insurance 
guarantees for the Santo Domingo - Samaná toll road.  Overall, since the majority of CPS 
outcomes under this Strategic Objective were partially achieved or not achieved, this Strategic 
Outcome is rated as Unsatisfactory. 

16. Outcome 1: A broader information base (data and facts) for informed policy decisions in 
the areas of macro-financial stability, competitiveness and economic relations with Haiti, 
was Achieved. The Bank supported the National Statistical Office (ONE) in producing a 
National Strategy for the Development of Statistics that allows ONE to assess the availability 
and utilization of data, harmonize and better integrate the data, identify deficient critical areas 
that are fundamental to track the progress towards the goals in the National Development 
Strategy, and link the production of data with evidence-based policy making.  ONE has greatly 
valued the capacity building and strategic support that is shaping its activities and has 
requested continuing support from the Bank under the new CPS. A key result in this CPS 
period was achieved through the TA that enabled the DR’s Poverty Committee to build 
consensus around and establish the new official poverty measurement methodology for the DR 
that is now used by the country.  The Treasury’s Country Banking Services have also helped 
enhance the Central Bank’s investment capabilities for the management of foreign exchange 
reserves, which contributes to country development goals of reducing risks and achieving 
greater economic stability.  In the same vein, the TA provided through the Financial Sector TA 
Loan served to strengthen prudential regulation and supervision of the banking system, 
contributing to greater financial stability.  Other key Bank products that have expanded the 
Government’s information base for policy making include two sets of Policy Notes in 2010 and 
2013; an analysis of public expenditures conducted jointly with the Ministry of Economy, an 
Equity Assessment that was finalized in 2013 and disseminated early in 2014, generating 
extensive public debates on how to reduce poverty; e-conferences on Free Trade Agreements; 
Index Insurance Regulatory and Policy Capacity Building for the development of index-based 
insurance, and a Country Economic Memorandum (CEM) entitled the DR-Haiti Quisqueya 
Growth and Poverty Report, analyzing the foreign trade and migration linkages in the island. 
Therefore, while no indicator with baseline or target values was assigned to this outcome, it is 
considered achieved given the important progress made on broadening the information base for 
informed policy decisions. 

17. Outcomes 2 and 3: Improved management of the water and sanitation sector and better 
performance of selected water and sanitation corporations, were not achieved. The Water and 
Sanitation in Tourist Areas Project has accompanied the Government in establishing a National 
Water Council and in designing the Water and Sanitation Strategy as well as drafting the Water 
Law.  Approval of the draft law has, however, been delayed by intense debates given its 
sensitivity and the embedded institutional reforms, and therefore the Water and Sanitation 
Strategy remains to be adopted. Thus far, only one of the three utilities has a draft of a business 
and modernization plan modernization; the local water and sanitation corporations (CORAAs) 
have yet to sign the envisaged business performance agreements. However, with continuing 

63 

 
Dominican Republic: Country Partnership Strategy FY10-13 – Completion Report 

Bank project support, progress in institutional development is beginning to gather momentum, 
notably via capacity building to strengthen performance.  

18. Outcome 4: Increased efficiency in power distribution and quality of electricity service, 
has been partly achieved. Large improvements in the Cost Recovery Index (CRI) from 53 
percent to 67 percent for the largest of the three electricity distribution companies (EdeSur) 
outweigh the slight decreases in CRIs for EdeNorte and EdeEste, but overall progress on this 
efficiency indicator still fall short of the 75 percent target envisaged in the CPS. It should be 
noted that (a) improved data management and cleaning of databases meant the data used to 
measure performance were more reliable than the data used to generate the baseline in 2010, 
and (b) the CRI targets are system-wide, and that within the project areas supported directly by 
the Bank project, affecting around 5 percent of customers, significantly larger improvements 
were achieved in reducing distribution losses. 60  Better progress was also made with regard to 
the quality of electrical service, as measured by the Average Service Availability Index (ASAI), 
which reached or exceeded targets for all three companies, with hours of available electricity 
rising from a baseline of 73-75 percent to 74-92 percent, depending on the utility, although this 
project-level indicator of quality of service was not included in the CPS results matrix.  There 
has been an improvement in Bank support to the sector, with the recently closed Electricity 
Distribution Rehabilitation Project rated as Moderately Satisfactory compared to the 
Unsatisfactory rating for the earlier Power Sector TAL.  On the IFC side, financing for the 
energy sector, including for the compressed natural gas distributor Linea Clave, and for a $20 
million Sustainable Energy credit line to Banco BHD, have emphasized energy efficiency and 
addressing climate change issues by helping small industries convert from heavy fuel oil to 
natural gas.  This in turn has decreased vulnerability to international oil prices, reduced carbon 
emissions and generated financial savings, improving the DR’s competitiveness.   

19. Outcome 5: Mainstreaming disaster risk management (DRM) into the Ministry of 
Economy, Planning and Development, was partially achieved. It was supported by the 
Emergency Recovery Loan (ERL) and Additional Financing, as well as non-lending TA in the 
areas of Adaptation to Climate Change and Disaster Risk Management as well as Avian 
Influenza Prevention. Significant delays in the program implementation resulted in only partial 
achievement of outcomes within the CPS period, although progress has accelerated more 
recently under the ERL and NLTA and outcomes should be achieved within the new CPS 
period.  With Bank TA, the DRM law was revised and is currently being considered by 
Congress.  GODR has opted for a Territorial Planning Information System with a DRM focus 
instead of a National Integrated Information System for DRM, and it has defined actors and 
institutional roles for the system and prepared specifications for the technical design of the 
system.  GODR has also explored risk financing alternatives, engaged IDB support for risk 
financing and is evaluating entry into the Caribbean Climate Risk Insurance Facility.   In terms 
of investment planning for resilience, Bank-supported rehabilitation of over 12,000 hectares of 

60 For example, in the Cristo Rey neighborhood of Santo Domingo, commercial distribution losses 
were reduced with the project from over 70 percent to less than 20 percent and 24-hour 
electricity service is provided, leading neighboring areas to request to be included in the Bank-
supported project.  An indicator for distribution losses originally included in the FY10-13 CPS was 
dropped as it was not included in the Electricity Distribution Project, due to questions of reliability 
of the data at the time, and since it distribution losses are reflected in the CRI. 

64

irrigation already exceed project targets, with another 10,000 hectares planned, all with a more 
disaster resilient investment design than was in place before. Dam safety has improved through 
rehabilitation works and the establishment of dam safety management rules for two main dams.  
Due to implementation delays, the upgrading of hydro-meteorological weather observation is 
only now being procured. However, the Avian Influenza Prevention NLTA successfully 
establish early warning systems, reducing reporting times of poultry diseases at the local level 
from 7 days to one day, far better than the target of 4 days. 

20. Beyond the above outcomes, IFC investments have provided important additional 
support for strengthening competitiveness.  With $20 million in financing for the expansion of 
the Punta Cana airport (serving 2.5 million passengers in 2013, and with its expanded capacity 
now beginning to serve as a logistical hub for trade in perishable cargo from South and Central 
America to Europe), $17.5 million for the expansion of the Caucedo port (now handling over 1 
million TEU containers, and designed to handle post-Panamax cargo shipping), and a $5 million 
trade finance credit line to Banco León, IFC has continued supporting major improvements to the 
country's competitiveness in the tourism and trade areas. IFC has also promoted increased 
competition in telecommunications with its support for the expansion of WIND Telecom 
(US$16 million subordinated debt plus US$12 million B-Loan). 

Strategic Objective 3: Quality of Public Expenditures and Institutional Development; Rating: 
Moderately Satisfactory 

21. The third strategic objective of the CPS was to enhance the quality of public expenditures 
and institutional development. Bank lending in this area included the Programmatic PASS 
DPL series, a Municipal Development Loan (PRODEM), and to a lesser degree the Health Sector 
Reform Loan (PARSSII). A robust portfolio of NLTA, above and beyond those planned in the 
CPS, also contributed to these outcomes in the areas of: Improving the Quality and Efficiency of 
Public Expenditures; Social Sectors; Improving Performance Accountability by Strengthening 
the DR’s Supreme Audit Institution; Strengthening Civil Society; Public Expenditures 
Management, and Institutionalization of Robust Fiscal and Financial Management Capacities in 
the Public Administration.  An Institutional and Governance Review is also being finalized.  IFC 
has complemented efforts to strengthen public governance with initiatives that strengthen 
corporate governance in the private sector, working with the Bolsa de Valores (stock market) and 
the American Chamber of Commerce in the DR to build skills and awareness of best practices 
and partnering with the Bank on regulatory improvements for the banking sector.  With one 
CPS outcome achieved and two partially achieved, this Strategic Objective is rated as 
Moderately Satisfactory. 

22. Outcome 1: improved budget management, is rated as partially achieved. Bank support 
under DPL series and NLTA ensured that the execution of social expenditure was successfully 
protected despite the international crisis at the start of the CPS period and the recent fiscal 
issues facing the Government through the performance agreements signed between MEPYD 
and the Ministries of Finance, Public Administration, Health and Education for health and 
education priority investment programs. Although not measured in the CPS, this is an 
important element of the improvement in budget management. On the CPS indicators within 
the Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA), performance did not improve: 
Indicator 1 (actual budget expenditure compared to original approved budget) showed no 
change between 2007 and 2012 (based on data as of 2011), while the country’s score on the PEFA 

65 

 
Dominican Republic: Country Partnership Strategy FY10-13 – Completion Report 

indicator that measures variance in budgeted versus expenditure compositions worsened from 
C in 2007 to a D+ in the 2012 PEFA.  At the same time, a subsequent Bank-led Public 
Expenditure Management and Financial Accountability Review (PEMFAR) documented 
important advances in the public financial management system since late 2011 that are not 
captured by the 2012 PEFA but that indicate improved budget management and credibility.61  
These include: the use by all central government agencies of the integrated financial 
management system (SIGEF) and the beginning of a roll-out to decentralized and autonomous 
agencies; the design of a Municipal SIGEF; the introduction and automation of a more detailed 
Chart of Accounts aligned with the Budget Classification System and with the coding of goods 
and services procured; the establishment of budget ceilings; the implementation of a platform 
(known as UEPEX) for managing external funds; the capturing of a larger share of government 
revenues in the Single Treasury Account; strengthened controls in procurement, internal audit 
and in external audits by the Supreme Audit Institution, which has started publishing online 
audit reports as soon as they are approved by the members of plenary as well as citizen-friendly 
reports. Moreover, budget monitoring by civil society organizations has improved significantly 
since the Participatory Anti-Corruption Initiative, and the DR’s Open Budget Index has 
increased from 11 in 2008 to 14 in 2010 and 29 in 2012. Thus the successful protection of social 
expenditures which was the underlying objective, and the documented implementation of 
reforms since 2012 that strengthen budget credibility, lead to a rating of Partially Achieved for 
this CPS outcome as of the end of the CPS period, in spite of the PEFA ratings as of 2012 (that 
were based on data as of late 2011).   

23. Outcome 2: Significant progress in the move toward performance-informed budget 
management was achieved. With support from the PASS DPL series and the Programmatic 
Social Sector NLTA, the Government adopted a Multi-Annual National Investment Plan in the 
Public Sector 2011-2014 designed to close gaps in the supply of education, health and nutrition 
services. PEFA indicator 11 on orderliness and participation in the annual budget process, and 
PEFA indicator 12 on a multi-year perspective in fiscal planning, expenditure policy and 
budgeting, improved from D scores in 2007 to B+ and C+, respectively. Furthermore, the 
signing of inter-ministerial performance agreements shows progress in the preparation of 
budget documents with accurate and timely performance information loosely linking inputs to 
outputs, outcomes and entitlements.  These results complement the successful piloting of 
results-based financing in health (see above). 

24. Outcome 3:  increase rural poor municipalities’ management capacity and is rated as 
partially achieved. Support in this area was provided primarily by the Municipal Development 
Project (PRODEM). Of the 15 rural municipalities participating in the PRODEM project, five 
pilot municipalities have benefited from systematic capacity building in areas including but not 
limited to procurement, financial management, human resource management strategic planning 
and community outreach. This has led to significant behavioral changes in management and 
citizen participation, as well in transparency and accountability.62 Moreover, the national 
government now integrates the Municipal Action Plans of the pilot local governments into the 

61 The World Bank: Public Expenditure Management and Financial Accountability Review 
(PEMFAR) for the Dominican Republic. 2014. 
62 This is reflected in a draft independent evaluation report commissioned for the Mid-term 
Review in April 2014.

national budget planning process. However, project implementation setbacks due to project 
management deficiencies, capacity shortages at national and local levels, and widespread 
institutional shortcomings at the local level have led to less progress to date than expected 
relative to the baseline. 

Strategic Objective 4: Capacity and Constituencies for Reform; Rating: Moderately 
Satisfactory 

25. The fourth Strategic Objective of the CPS aimed at building capacity and constituencies 
for reform. This objective was included after extensive consultation with Government officials 
and civil society.  It recognizes that addressing development challenges in the DR requires the 
involvement of non-Government actors. This Strategic Objective was supported by the PASS 
DPL series, which supported the budget transparency portal, and by the Municipal 
Development Project, which supported local participatory budget capacity-building initiatives. 
Non-lending assistance included an Institutional Development Fund (IDF) for Congressional 
Oversight, NLTAs for Strengthening Civil Society and Programmatic Social Sector support, 
Gender Mainstreaming Capacity and Advocacy, Access to Information and Downward 
Accountability in the DR, Improving Performance Accountability in the DR by Strengthening 
Congressional Oversight, Demand Side Governance, and the USAID-funded Strategic 
Partnership for Transparency, Social Accountability and Governance.  Finally, the Bank’s 
convening services played a critical role in supporting important national dialogue processes in 
education (IDEC), inclusive growth (the Caribbean Growth Forum–CGF) and corruption 
(Participatory Anti-Corruption Initiative–IPAC).  With one CPS outcome achieved, one mostly 
achieved and one partially achieved, this Strategic Objective is rated as Moderately 
Satisfactory. 

26. Outcome 1: Strengthened congressional budget oversight capacities, was partially 
achieved. The IDF-financed Congressional oversight strengthening grant supported the work of 
the House of Representatives’ Office of Budgetary Analysis, Monitoring and Evaluation 
(OASEP), training legislators on best practices in Congressional supervision through the 
upgrade of the Legislative Information System, and TA to develop an institutional plan to 
transform the OASEP into a bi-cameral Congressional Permanent Advisory Office (OPA) for 
budget oversight. Although the OPA has not been established, as initially envisioned by the 
Government, OASEP’s role in improving congressional oversight has been significantly 
strengthened: the office is now staffed with merit-based personnel and has been producing 
trimestral reports on budget analysis and budget execution that are distributed to various 
legislative committees in the House of Representatives. 

27. Outcome 2:  strengthening civil society capacity for budget analysis and monitoring, was 
achieved.   As reported in the CPS Progress Report, the Civil Society Public Budget Observatory 
of a local NGO called Centro Juan Montalvo published six budget analysis reports and 18 
regional technical bulletins on the national budget using Portal del Ciudadano (budget 
transparency portal) data, in cooperation with the Civil Society Commission on Poverty and 
Fiscal Policy of the Foro Ciudadano, a coalition of more than 150 CSOs.  The Observatory also 
trained nine community groups on monitoring budget execution and over 100 people on fiscal 
pacts and budget processes. The Observatory also developed a work plan for transparency and 
accountability that resulted in a pact signed by all presidential candidates in 2012, formalizing 
the commitment to dedicating 4 percent of GDP to education, which has been honored by the 

67 

 
Dominican Republic: Country Partnership Strategy FY10-13 – Completion Report 

new Administration.  Finally, an integral part of the IDEC, IPAC and Caribbean Growth Forum 
dialogue processes (described under Strategic Objective 4) has been the post-dialogue 
monitoring of compliance with agreed actions, and civil society strengthened its oversight 
capacity as a result of these processes. 

28. Outcome 3: Enhanced participatory planning at the local level was mostly achieved. 
Progress towards this outcome was made with the Municipal Development Project (PRODEM).  
PRODEM’s five pilot municipalities concluded participatory planning processes and prepared 
Municipal Development Plans that were approved by their corresponding Municipal Councils.  
At the same time, the indicator related to establishment of a budget transparency portal was 
achieved and the Portal del Ciudadano was launched on August 30, 2011.  It is linked to the 
Government’s Financial Management Information System (SIGEF) and provides data on 
revenues and expenditures for each central institution.  A total of 12,204 visits were registered 
in the 12 months to September 2012. The information in the portal could usefully be upgraded 
to include local governments, state-owned enterprises and other government-funded entities, 
among other improvements. The Government has also prepared easy-to access budget 
execution reports, known as the citizens’ budget (“Presupuesto Ciudadano”), although they can 
benefit from increased dissemination. 

29. Achievements under this fourth Strategic Objective of building coalitions for reform, and 
indeed under all four Strategic Objectives of the CPS, were supported by the Participatory 
Anti-Corruption Initiative (IPAC).  This highly successful contribution goes beyond any CPS 
performance indicator of success.  The IPAC is a unique approach to combatting corruption: it 
established a broad participatory mechanism under which representatives from Government, 
civil society and the private sector worked together to establish priorities anti-corruption 
actions.  With technical support from the Bank and other donor partners, the IPAC developed 
30 recommendations, identified progress milestones and established a consortium of 14 civil 
society organizations to monitor and audit implementation and inform citizens of the progress. 
Among the 20 recommendations fully achieved to date, IPAC has resulted in greater budget 
transparency and access to budget information, better integration between procurement and 
financial management, as well as major progress on creating a single treasury account, among 
other accomplishments.   

30. Not only has the IPAC methodology attracted international attention, but the Bank has 
drawn on it to embark on a wider, multi-stakeholder participatory initiative in 14 countries 
in the Caribbean called the Caribbean Growth Forum.  The CGF aims to foster equitable, 
inclusive and sustainable growth by identifying priority policies and actions that enhance 
private sector led growth. The CGF was launched in the DR in November 2012 with the 
participation of 170 representatives from the public sector, donor community, private sector, 
academia and civil society, applying the IPAC methodology to build consensus on priority 
actions for promoting growth through enhanced logistics and connectivity, investment climate, 
and skills and productivity.  In May 2013, the Minister of Economy, Planning and Development 
launched the implementation of the Action Plan developed in the CGF process.  A first public 
accounting of progress was held in November 2013. Similarly, the IDEC, cited above under the 
first Strategic Objective, also followed the IPAC methodology, involving a dialogue between 
government and civil society, supported by donor partners, that was designed to build a 
consensus around monitorable priority reform actions for enhancing quality in the education 
sector. These priority actions were adopted by the Ministry of Education in April 2013 and 

68 

 
 
Dominican Republic: Country Partnership Strategy FY10-13 – Completion Report 

integrated into its annual operating plans and monitoring systems. IDEC adopted similar civic 
oversight tools to those developed by the IPAC, and the first semiannual public accounting of 
progress was held in August 2013.  The Bank has played a critical convening and knowledge 
provider role in supporting all three of these best-practice dialogue processes. 

31.  Further initiatives to strengthen participatory budgeting included the World Bank - 
USAID Strategic Partnership for Transparency, Social Accountability and Governance.  This 
Externally Funded Output (EFO) financed training for 21 CSOs in two provinces on the 
Participatory Budgeting Quality Assessment Tool to build capacity for social accountability in 
relation to local level participatory budgeting. The Bank’s Access to Information and 
Downward Accountability in the DR grant also enabled vulnerable marginalized groups in ten 
communities to benefit from the Access to Information Law in the DR and strengthened their 
capacity to express their voice, participate in policy discussions, demand accountability and 
monitor government services, as documented in a recent impact evaluation. 63 Finally, a pilot 
program implemented through the Government’s Information Technology Office (OPTIC) 
conducted a participatory budgeting SMS mobile technology survey program in two 
municipalities that increased participation rates in budget deliberation to one-third of citizens 
versus one-fifth in non-pilot areas. 

IV. Bank Group Performance 

Bank Group Performance Rating: Good  

CPS Design 

32. The strategic objectives defined under the FY10-FY13 CPS were strongly aligned with the 
country objectives formalized in the National Development Strategy 2010-2030 (END). Each 
CPS objective corresponds directly to either one or two of the four END strategic pillars, as the 
CPS results chain clearly illustrates, 64 demonstrating a clear understanding of the country’s 
needs and its development challenges.  The CPS addressed the need to reduce the country’s 
vulnerability to shocks following the 2008-09 global crisis while delivering results for citizens.  
It was also aligned to the political cycle, which has allowed time to consult and ensure proper 
alignment of the upcoming CPS with the new Administration’s priorities.   

33.  Lessons learned from the FY06-FY09 CAS Completion Report were incorporated in the 
design of the FY10-FY13 CPS. In particular, it was suggested that the new CPS focus on a few 
key sectors with potential for success and where Bank advice is appreciated, and that it set 
realistic and measurable objectives and targets. These lessons were taken into account in the 
FY10-FY13 CPS results framework, which tightly linked results to interventions. However, 
several indicators lacked baseline data and many had to be revised during the CPS Progress 
Report as the scope for results under problem projects narrowed. Other indicators (e.g. for 
budget predictability or electricity cost recovery) were defined in a system-wide manner that 
went beyond the projects’ spheres of influence, so they ultimately understated the projects’ 
impact.

Dominican Republic: Country Partnership Strategy FY10-13 – Completion Report 

34. Risks were properly identified in the CPS design.  The CPS was prepared in the context of 
the global financial crisis and built in flexibility to allow for adjustments in the event of a halt in 
the Government’s reform program or a significant deterioration in macroeconomic conditions. 
The CPS program’s flexible approach envisioned a balance between investment and policy-
based lending, which could be modified if change in circumstances warrant, as happened with 
the additional Public Finance and Social Sector DPL in FY10. Apart from economic risks, the 
CPS design considered implementation risk (e.g. effectiveness delays) and operational risks (e.g. 
project implementation challenges in procurement and financial management), and proposed 
mitigation measures including close portfolio monitoring and capacity building, which proved 
essential in practice in light of delays and challenges in implementation capacity. 

35. A mid-term Progress Report was conducted and determined only few adjustments in the 
program were necessary.   Changes in the strategy identified by the CPS Progress Report 
focused on strengthening efforts to improve the performance of existing operations and 
increasing the delivery of knowledge services.  In the process, some indicators were revised 
downwards to ensure greater realism, notably in light of extended effectiveness delays in the 
Congressional approval process and implementation delays. 

36. IFC similarly aligned its strategy to the National Development Strategy by organizing its 
support along four strategic pillars: (i) Financial inclusion, through investment and advisory 
services to financial institutions to improve access to finance for MSMEs and households; (ii) 
Competitiveness, through investments that support infrastructure, trade logistics, education 
and regional integration, and advisory services in areas such as Corporate Governance; (iii) 
Climate Change, through continued support to the energy sector, direct and through financial 
institutions; and (iv) Resilience to crisis, through the deepening of the local capital markets and 
support to the diversification of the country's economy. Alignment with other donors and 
development partners was also considered in the program design. 

CPS Implementation 

37. During the FY10-FY13 CPS period, the Bank Group exceeded its originally planned 
lending and non-lending program. The indicative lending program set forth in the CPS 
proposed a total of $500 million, the bulk of which related to social programs through the PASS 
DPL series ($370 million).  The PASS DPL series supported significant policy reforms in social 
protection that strengthened safety nets for the poor in the post-global crisis environment, and 
reflects the quality of the Bank’s policy dialogue with the Government during this period.  
While the CARCIP regional connectivity project for $27 million was postponed and a final DPL 
for $70 million was dropped in the 2012 election year, a new DPL (Public Finance and Social 
Sector Development), approved during the first fiscal year for $150 million and additional 
financing for the emergency recovery loan (US$20 million) brought the total lending envelope 
to $600 million during FY10-13, amounting to record levels of Bank support in a CPS period to 
the DR. 

38. The Bank delivered a range of knowledge services that have generally been highly valued 
by Government and other counterparts and leveraged its convening services to great effect. 
Technical assistance has been funded by the Bank’s own budget resources and trust funds, as 
well as by donor partners, demonstrating the Bank’s ability to effectively leverage other sources 
of financing. These targeted knowledge services complemented the lending program, 

70 

 
Dominican Republic: Country Partnership Strategy FY10-13 – Completion Report 

particularly in the areas of social sector performance reform, public sector management and 
demand for improved governance.  They also included South-South exchanges, as well as 
highly innovative leveraging of the Bank’s convening powers through such best practices 
initiatives as IPAC, IDEC and the CGF, which were all launched during the CPS period (the 
latter two are still on-going). 65 

39. Project implementation was below expectations.  As the previous discussion has indicated, 
several important results were achieved during the CPS period, notably with the successful 
PASS DPL series. However, of the five SILs that closed during FY10-12, three were rated 
Moderately Satisfactory and two were rated Unsatisfactory.  The current portfolio of five 
operations for $207.4 million includes one project that is Satisfactory, three that are Moderately 
Satisfactory and one that is Moderately Unsatisfactory.  The Bank’s implementation support 
and CPPR consultations have identified weaknesses in relation to project management, 
effectiveness delays due to the time taken by the Congress to approve new loans, procurement 
delays due to capacity constraints, binding budget ceilings linked to efforts to contain fiscal 
deficits by curbing public investment, and (in the case of the Power Sector TAL and the first 
Health APL, rated Unsatisfactory at closing) Government commitment.  The Bank and 
Government have worked to build capacity, adjust budget ceilings and better align the latest 
health and electricity operations with Government priorities—and the electricity operation 
closed with an MS rating while the ongoing Health APL2 is also showing positive results at this 
stage.  Proactive restructuring and intensive implementation support have served to improve 
the ongoing portfolio as well as obtain improved ratings for projects closed during FY13 (to MS 
for two investment operations and Satisfactory for the PASS DPL series) compared to FY10-12.  
The Bank and Government have also undertaken an assessment of procurement issues and 
committed to an action plan to enhance procurement performance, including the use of the 
Bank’s procurement plan tracking system (SEPA), rolled out in 2012, to enhance timeliness and 
transparency of procurement processes.  A final, key observation is that the Bank-supported 
portfolio of investment projects was maintained through the electoral period and political 
transitions, and the Bank has built favorable relationships with new counterparts. Although 
significant effectiveness delays and slow project start have influenced negatively THE 
completion of activities and the attainment of some CPS targets within the CPS period, a sound 
program of ongoing activities is in place for the new CPS period.  

40. During the CPS period, IFC average annual investment activity increased to $42 million 
in FY10-FY12 compared to $27 million in FY07-FY09, and were complemented by a range of 
Advisory Services. IFC’s portfolio size increased from $170 million in June 2009 to $215 million 
in March 2013 (in 19 active investment projects, with $139 million outstanding and $12 million 
in Syndicated B loans for which IFC is the lender of record). The portfolio is more diversified 
today in terms of sectors (new investments in education, local capital markets, microfinance, 
energy efficiency, natural gas, housing finance) and clients (7 new clients). During FY10-13, IFC 
committed 16 investments for a total of $184 million and secured an additional mobilization of 
US$87 million (US$75 million from AMC and US$12 million B loans).  Leading sectors include 
infrastructure (52 percent), followed by the financial sector (36 percent), and manufacturing and 
services (12 percent). Most operations have been aligned with the CPS’ second Strategic

Objective, namely to Promote Competitiveness in a Sustainable and Resilient Economic 
Environment. As of 2012, IFC’s clients were supporting over 12,000 jobs, of which 5,458 were 
held by women. In addition in 2012, IFC’s clients reached over 92,000 patients and made $34 
million in taxes and other payments to the government, as well as $36 million in purchases from 
domestic suppliers. IFC lending and investments have been complemented by a range of 
advisory services projects in such areas as access to finance (ADOPEM – microfinance targeted 
to women), energy efficiency (BHD – energy efficiency credit line) and corporate governance 
awareness and capacity building.  

V. Key Lessons and Recommendations 

41. Knowledge and convening services were important complements to the lending services 
in the Bank’s overall program for achieving results.  The success of dialogues such as the 
IPAC, where the Bank galvanized civic engagement to advance the anti-corruption agenda; the 
CGF, where the Bank and donor partners are helping to build consensus around priorities for 
inclusive private sector-led growth; and the IDEC to enhance quality in the education sector, 
demonstrates the effectiveness of leveraging the Bank’s convening power in impactful 
initiatives that require minimal financing. Similar efforts in other sectors can be considered in 
the forthcoming CPS where opportunities arise.  Moreover, an impressive number of AAA 
products and of trust-funded activities, often in partnership with other donors, were delivered 
during the CPS period, many of which complemented the lending program in significant ways.  
Those trust-funded activities that were more peripheral to the Bank’s program received less 
implementation support.  The new CPS should therefore attempt to ensure that lending, grants 
and technical assistance are bundled around core objectives in ways that are mutually 
reinforcing. The Bank should also be clearer at the outset of its knowledge services as to the 
indicators of success of the activity, the key audiences and best modes of delivering messages to 
those audiences, and the opportunities for partnerships that can be built in the course of 
preparing and delivering knowledge services. 

42. A range of operational and political economy factors have contributed to slow 
implementation of Bank-financed projects and these need to be mitigated to the extent 
feasible in the forthcoming CPS.  Key factors include long effectiveness delays due to delays in 
Congressional approval of loans; project management and capacity constraints; turnover in 
project management on both the Bank’s side and the client’s side; bureaucratic hindrances in 
both the design and implementation of projects on both the Bank’s and the client’s side that 
need to be reduced and factored into disbursement projections; overly ambitious outcome 
indicators in some cases; and severely binding budget ceilings for the projects, including for 
projects that were being successfully restructured only to find that execution rates were capped 
to improve the country’s fiscal situation. Project design should also take into account the effort 
required to create consensus and achieve inter-institutional coordination, which are critical for 
project implementation and policy reforms.  More generally, political economy analysis should 
underpin program and project design more often, as was made clear, for example, with the 
stalled strategic and legislative agenda in the water and sanitation sector, but which is 
important more broadly in the context of the institutional fragmentation and vested interests 
that projects inevitably operate in in many countries, such as the DR. 

43. Monitoring and Evaluation needs to be strengthened in the next CPS. The current CPS 
results framework included indicators with no baseline data, indicators that had to be adjusted 

72 

 
Dominican Republic: Country Partnership Strategy FY10-13 – Completion Report 

as they were unduly optimistic, indicators that the Bank’s operations could not influence 
sufficiently relative to other factors, indicators with insufficient periodicity to be able to monitor 
progress continuously, and a lack of reliable data collection or monitoring systems that made it 
harder to evaluate progress. In several cases, these challenges carried over from the CPS to the 
CPS Progress Report, although in others corrections were made, notably in light of improved 
baseline data or overambitious targets.  In one case, the Health APL2, the linkage of financing to 
indicators has helped to align incentives with results and gradually encouraged improved data 
collection, offering a valuable lesson for the new CPS.

Management System has increased 
in the pilot regions, but there are 
still doctors who do not always 
systematically register data (so the 
true value of the indicator is 
believed to be higher). Also, data 
entry has been delayed in health 
centers that do not have regular 
access to the internet, i.e. 
information tends to be uploaded 
into the CMS periodically instead 
of during medical consultations 
(Source: Clinical Management

evaluation of the Solidaridad CCT 
program show that their 
beneficiaries have on average 2.9% 
higher incidence of prenatal check-

(end-2012) and 46.7% in 2013; The 
number improved rapidly after 
2011, and exceeded the target in 
2013.  Moreover, as the use of the 
CMS continues to be limited, the 
true number treated could be even 
higher.  One main issue is that 
nurses usually administer 
immunizations in health centers 
but doctors have access to the CMS 
and the computer in the health 
center so coordination needs to be 
improved among health staff to 
ensure that vaccination data are not 
just manually registered in the 
immunization books but also in the 
CMS (Source: CMS). For children 
beneficiaries of the CCT program 
Solidaridad, the percentage 
increased from 26.1% in 2010 to 
28.5% in 2011, respectively 8.3 and

findings, various activities and 
processes in the DR are underway

an efficient way 
that with the

Although it is much desired for 
numerous institutions 
participating in the Employment

coordination, ensuring 
articulation and integration as 
well as sustainability of the 
programs, in practice this is 
difficult to achieve and success 
depends deeply on the capacity 
and ability of implementation 
support and constant monitoring 
to take the project's design into 
practice.   

Stability of the staff in charge of 
implementation is very important. 
The Ministry of Labor 
implemented the programs 
through a PIU which was 
operating since 2001. The 
implementation of MINERD's 
component was led by Adults 
Directorate whose department 
head changed every 6 months on 
average. The contrasting results 
achieved can be considered as 
evidence of the relative capacities 
of the implementing agencies and 
the importance of the PIU's in the 
achievement of the goals, which is 
highly correlated to the stability of 
trained people with direct hands-
on experience performing these 
activities.

The electricity sector 
improvement requires a long term 
commitment by the Government 
beyond the 4 year period of the 
administrators. The sustainability 
of the sector cannot be achieved in 
one or two years. On the other 
side, the installation of generation 
plants takes a long time (4 to 8 
years and even more in the case of 
hydro power plants) so results 
cannot be achieved nor measured 
in shorter periods. A 
programmatic scheme could be 
advisable in these cases, and 
requires an integrated strategy 
addressing various dimensions of 
energy generation, transmission 
and distribution as well as 
improved utility management and 
appropriate pricing of electricity

Revised Indicator 1: Partially 
Achieved. A DRM law has been 
drafted with Bank TA and 
submitted to Congress to 
strengthen the overall DRM 
framework.  Instead of a National 
Integrated Information System for 
DRM, GODR opted for a Territorial 
Planning Information System with 
a DRM focus.  Actors and 
institutional roles have been 
defined and adopted for the 
system, and specifications 
prepared for the technical design of 
the system.  Investment plans: 
DRM aspects are beginning to be 
included in investment plans, e.g. 
for hospitals, and are expected to 
be included systematically in 
territorial and investment plans by 
2016.  Bank support has led to the 
rehabilitation of more than 12,000 
hectares of irrigation (already 
exceeding the ERL project target of 

88

11,577 hectares), with further 
investment plans for an additional 
10,000 hectares under the ERL by 
2015, all with a more disaster risk 
resilient design than before the 
2007 disasters that triggered the 
ERL.  Municipalities: A diagnostic 
has been undertaken of DRM 
information in selected 
municipalities and proposals 
defined for categorization of 
municipalities and risk assessment 
by hazard type. National Strategy: 
GODR has explored risk financing 
alternatives, engaged IDB support 
for risk financing and is evaluating 
entry into the Caribbean Climate 
Risk Insurance Facility.

The objective was to protect 
allocations in particular for social

broader budget indicator was used.  
The execution of social expenditure 
was indeed successfully protected 
throughout the period and beyond, 
with the execution of social 
expenditure for the closing of 
supply gaps protected despite the 
fiscal crisis. Moreover, a 
subsequent PEMFAR documents 
significant improvement on budget 
credibility as of 2013, reflected in a 
new, more detailed chart of 
accounts to be able to match 
budget and procurement data, the 
expanded application of a Single 
Treasury Account, strengthening of 
internal and external controls, the

Capacity issues at both the

significant. Where possible, 
subcontracting should be 
contemplated while strengthening 
capacity to design and monitor at 
the ministerial level.    Also, given 
widespread institutional failure at 
the local level, a CDD operation 
focussed on both the demand side 
(collective action) and the supply 
side (municipal/district capacity
