EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

i. 
The small, open economies of the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) 
have been trapped for years in low growth, high debt, and limited fiscal space, exacerbated 
by a number of external shocks. The impact of the 2008 global financial crisis was severe as 
tourism, remittances, Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and official development flows decreased 
sharply, growth rates plummeted, debt and fiscal imbalances increased to unsustainable levels, 
and labor market conditions deteriorated. With decreasing productivity and weak external 
demand in key sectors, decreasing FDI, and continued structural weaknesses, these impacts are 
still lingering today. The financial sector demonstrated limited capacity to support growth and 
job creation. In addition, natural disasters have periodically taken a large toll on the region, 
affecting lives, infrastructure, and economic activity. The OECS’s bleak economic performance 
has exacerbated social problems: unemployment has been growing at alarming rates, especially 
among the youth; and poverty, which was relatively high before 2008, has very likely worsened. 
ii. 
Against 
this background, resumption of 
inclusive growth, generation of 
employment, and increased economic and social resilience are the priorities of OECS 
governments. Macroeconomic sustainability is a key objective of OECS governments. They 
understand that strengthening the financial sector, continuing to improve the investment climate, 
and enhancing the competitiveness of key sectors are critical to support the resumption of private 
investment and development of key economic sectors that can generate growth and employment. 
In order to achieve this objective, reducing the cost of electricity, which is among the highest in 
the world, and increasing Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) connectivity are 
important. OECS governments recognize that a modernized public sector, including a stronger 
framework for public-private partnerships, would contribute to improving fiscal management 
and public service delivery as well as strengthening social safety nets and equipping the labor 
force with the skills needed to find jobs would help improve social resilience and employability. 
Finally, the OECS governments agree that better disaster prevention and risk management are 
critical. 
The OECS Regional Partnership Strategy (RPS) for FY15-19 is consistent with the 
iii. 
holistic approach adopted by the OECS Governments to tackle the long-standing issues of 
low growth and debt sustainability. The OECS countries acknowledge the multifaceted nature 
of their challenges and have elaborated their own vision considering that improvements in 
competitiveness, reduction in sovereign debt levels, fiscal adjustments to ensure macro 
sustainability, and enhance resilience to shocks are interrelated aspects all critical to resume and 
sustain inclusive growth. The Bank has supported this approach and, at the request of the Heads 
of Government of CARICOM countries, has elaborated the Comprehensive Debt Framework 
(CDF) which aims at helping governments, consistently with their own visions, in the design of 
country specific solutions to their high indebtedness. The CDF is the context in which the Bank 
undertakes its dialogue with the OECS and defines its assistance program. 
iv. 
In that context, the objective of the RPS is to contribute to laying the foundations 
for sustainable inclusive growth through three areas of engagement: (i) competitiveness, (ii) 
public sector modernization, and (iii) resilience. Drawing on a diagnostic of the main 
obstacles to poverty reduction and shared prosperity, under the RPS the World Bank Group 
(WBG) will work in close partnership with the IMF and the Caribbean Development Bank to 

i 

 
support governments’ efforts on the much needed fiscal adjustment, and on strengthening the 
financial sector, with the objective of contributing to macro-financial stability and enabling the 
resumption of financing activities to support growth and investments. In parallel, the WBG will 
focus on laying the foundations for increased private participation in the economy by creating a 
more effective investment climate and promoting the competitiveness of industries with high 
potential, including tourism and agribusiness. Over the long run, this is expected to contribute to 
higher investments, private sector activity, and ultimately growth and employment, as well as to 
poverty reduction in rural areas where many smallholders live. The RPS will also support 
enhanced efficiency in the supply of, and demand for, electricity and diversification of energy 
supply away from fossil fuels, with the objective of enhancing the competitiveness of key sectors 
of the economy and contributing to enhanced shared prosperity. A significant impact on the price 
of electricity will, however, require work extending beyond the RPS period. Finally, the RPS 
aims to support better disaster risk management and resilience, as well as investments in human 
capital, including through more effective social protection systems, better quality of education 
and employability of the labor force, and greater use of evidence-based policy to address non-
communicable diseases. 
v. 
This WBG program will be financed through a highly selective package of regional 
Bank lending operations and by leveraging additional resources. Three new operations are 
planned: a Competitiveness project, a Renewable Energy project, and a Social Resilience and 
Human Development project. A fourth operation to support financial sector strengthening could 
also materialize in the context of adequate progress on developing a comprehensive financial 
sector strategy - in collaboration with the IMF, the ECCB and the CDB - and under a suitable 
policy and regulatory environment. To capitalize on the benefits of regional integration while 
enabling strong country ownership, each operation will be designed under a regional framework, 
as appropriate, but developed and implemented at national level. Implementation of the existing 
portfolio will further contribute to achieving the RPS development objectives, particularly in the 
areas of disaster risk management, ICT connectivity, and reforms of the public and social 
sectors. As IBRD and IDA resources are limited in the OECS and needs very large, leveraging 
additional trust fund and grant resources is integral to the success of this RPS. 
vi. 
Constrained in general by the small size of investments in the OECS, the IFC and 
MIGA will contribute to the RPS objectives through selective investment support, 
depending on opportunities. The IFC will focus on crisis response; job creation and inclusive 
growth; innovation, competitiveness, and integration; and climate change. MIGA faces limited 
opportunities for engagement because of the small market size of the OECS countries. 
Improvements in the financial sector and development of PPPs are likely to enable a greater role 
for IFC and MIGA. 
vii. 
The program proposed in this RPS might be reviewed at the time of the first 
Performance and Learning Review. The emphasis of the WBG engagement and allocation of 
resources to the various priority areas would depend on governments’ priorities and demand for 
Bank support at the time of the review. As the timing and form of support to the OECS financial 
sector remain uncertain, flexibility in the implementation of the RPS will be required. In 
particular, speedy progress on the financial sector reforms would require a shift of support and 
resources away from other areas of the RPS, while a slower pace might require an increased 
focus on the RPS resilience pillar, especially on building stronger safety nets to support the most 

ii 

vulnerable. Thus, the program, including key areas of engagement and results, may be 
significantly adjusted at the time of the first Performance and Learning Review (PLR). 
viii. The proposed program faces high risks stemming from a fragile macroeconomic, 
financial and social framework, exposure to exogenous shocks, complex political economy 
issues, feeble regional cooperation, and weak institutional capacity. Persistent high levels of 
debt and fiscal imbalances constrain countries’ ability to build fiscal buffers to manage shocks 
and sustain confidence and investment. A weak financial sector is a source of potential macro 
risks and limits the financing of private sector investment. This, in turn, might undermine the 
achievement of greater competitiveness in the leading sectors of the economy.   Social tensions 
could increase if unemployment, especially among youth, continues to rise and might generate 
lack of consensus to move forward the development agenda that the WBG is supporting. 
Exposure to economic and natural shocks remains a threat to the achievement of results on 
structural reforms and fiscal management. Weak capacity and a complex political economy 
could stall needed reforms and impact the possibility to modernize the public sector as well as to 
take actions to improve social protection systems and the delivery of basic social services. Weak 
regional cooperation could jeopardize the adoption of actions needed to implement regional 
projects. To mitigate this risk, the OECS governments have committed to implement a program 
of reforms focused on fiscal sustainability and macro stability, which have been expressed in 
their national and regional strategies, while the WBG will maintain a systematic dialogue with 
the authorities and other partners to better understand the political economy context in each 
country. Moreover, the WBG will use flexibility, within the context of the RPS and in line with 
Governments’ needs, to allocate resources as events develop and will provide technical 
assistance and training initiatives, embedded in the operations when feasible, to contribute to 
increased institutional capacity.

1. COUNTRY DIAGNOSIS 

A. 

Recent Economic Developments  

1. 
For years, the small states of the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) 
have been trapped in a spiral of low growth, high debt, limited fiscal space, and growing 
social problems, exacerbated by a number of external shocks. 1 Since the 1990s, growth in the 
OECS countries has been subdued. Growth was further hit hard by the global financial crisis of 
2008, and in most OECS countries growth has not returned to pre-crisis levels. Overall, OECS 
countries ranked among developing countries with the lowest growth in the world between 2003 
and 2012 (Fig. 1). Low growth, combined with natural disasters and imprudent fiscal policies, 
has led to persistent fiscal deficits. Structural fiscal problems have resulted in turn in a sizable 
accumulation of debt in the region, leading to fragile macroeconomic frameworks. This 
lackluster performance has exacerbated social problems: unemployment has been growing at 
alarming rates, especially among the youth.  

Subdued growth 

2. 
Over the last two decades, economic growth has been elusive in the OECS. In the 
1980s growth averaged 5.9 percent per year, largely driven by an expansion of agricultural 
exports (mainly bananas and sugar) under preferential trade arrangements with Europe, large aid 
inflows that followed independence from the United Kingdom, and an initial spurt in the tourism 
sector. In the early 1990s, the region experienced a dramatic shift in its external trade position 
when many economies lost preferential access to European markets. Average annual growth 
dropped to 3.3 percent at the end of the decade. In the early 2000s, OECS governments’ efforts 
to offset exogenous shocks through increased public investment did not translate into a revival of 
growth; rather, they crowded out private investment. The growing fiscal imbalances associated 
with increased public investment were financed by expensive domestic and external commercial 
borrowing and resulted in an unsustainably large debt burden. In addition, the deterioration in the 
external environment caused a contraction in exports and in the resource balance.  
3. 
The 2008 global economic crisis further weakened growth. After the onset of the 
global financial crisis, economic growth in OECS countries contracted for four consecutive years 
(on average, by 1.5 percent per year), leading to a cumulative drop of 6 percent in total output 
during 2009-2012. Per capita income declined on average by 4.5 percent from around US$9,200 
in 2008 to US$8,800 in 2012 (Table 1). The largest fall in per capita income was felt in Antigua 
and Barbuda (17 percent compared to the pre-crisis level), which experienced a cumulative 
output contraction of 22 percent of GDP during 2009-2011. Dominica, St. Lucia, and St. Vincent 
and the Grenadines were less affected by the crisis compared to neighboring countries: St. Lucia 
maintained low, but positive growth from the time of the crisis through 2011. After two 
consecutive years of negative growth, St. Vincent and the Grenadines recorded positive growth 
from 2011 on. However, across the OECS, recovery has remained fragile. 2  

1 The OECS, created in 1981, comprises six independent countries and three British Overseas Territories (Anguilla, 
Montserrat, and the British Virgin Islands). This RPS covers the six independent OECS countries: Antigua and 
Barbuda, Dominica, Grenada, St. Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines. Apart from St. 
Vincent and the Grenadines, which has not yet joined the IFC, all are members of the World Bank Group.  
2 Tables on OECS countries’ selected economic indicators and projections are in the Annexes.

4. 
Since the crisis, growth has remained subdued due to declining competitiveness in 
key sectors and weak external demand. Despite a slight rebound in 2013, with regional real 
output growth averaging 0.7 percent, economic activity in most countries has remained sluggish. 
The OECS countries rely extensively on tourism, construction, agriculture, and financial 
services, which in 2013 represented respectively 8.7, 3 8.6, 4.3, and 9.3 percent of GDP. The 
OECS’s lackluster growth performance since the global financial crisis was accentuated by the 
weakening competitiveness of the tourism sector and the continued low demand related to the 
slow recovery in advanced economies: the share of tourism receipts from the US, UK, and 
Canada to the Eastern Caribbean Currency Union (ECCU) 4 declined by 37 percent, and the 
region was not able to attract visitors from other potential markets with higher growth. 
5. 
Large remittances to the region have typically helped ease external constraints to 
growth. Over the past two decades the OECS has seen a significant migration of skilled labor 
out of the region, and has in return benefitted from large private remittances, ranging from 
US$20 million in Antigua and Barbuda (2 percent of GDP in 2012) to US$45 million in St. Kitts 
and Nevis (6 percent of GDP in 2012). In some countries, remittances exceed the value of 
exports (Fig. 2). Remittance flows to the region have been one of the most important sources of 

3 This value indicates the direct contribution of travel and tourism to GDP, or total “internal” spending in a 
particular country on travel and tourism by residents and nonresidents for business and leisure purposes, as well as 
government “individual” spending on travel and tourism services directly linked to visitors—cultural (e.g., 
museums) or recreational (e.g., national parks).  
4 The ECCU comprises six countries—Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica, Grenada, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia, St. 
Vincent and the Grenadines—and two British territories, Anguilla and Montserrat.

However, remittances fell during the 
crisis and have made only a modest 
recovery since. Traditionally, remittances 
have 
increased during 
crises, helping 
households and investors weather shocks. 6 
This time, however, there was a substantive 
drop in overall remittance inflows—they fell 
by 15 percent between 2007 and 2010. In 
addition, the rate of recovery has been slow: 
while remittance receipts have picked up since 
2011, they have barely returned to pre-crisis 
levels, exacerbating the impact of the crisis on 
growth.

Fiscal imbalances 

7. 
Low growth, combined with frequent natural disasters and imprudent fiscal 
policies, has led to persistent fiscal deficits throughout the region. The sluggish economic 
recovery has had implications for revenue performance, while OECS countries implemented 
fiscal stimulus packages that led to a surge in current expenditures. Total revenue collection in 
the region (including grants) dropped by an average of 1.3 percentage points from the crisis to 
2012, but recovered to pre-crisis level in 2013 (Fig. 3). Overall fiscal balances plunged in 2009, 
and, while they recovered progressively afterwards, the overall fiscal deficit remained elevated 
reaching 2.6 percent of GDP in 2013. In St. Kitts and Nevis and Dominica, fiscal positions have 
improved because of the recent introduction of a value-added tax (VAT) 7 and strong receipts 
from the Citizenship-by-Investment (CBI) program, 8 while in the other countries large 
expenditures have continued to put pressure on fiscal balances.

Unsustainable debt levels 

8. 
Structural fiscal problems, combined with external shocks, have resulted in a sizable 
accumulation of debt in the region: aggregate public debt reached 86.7 percent of GDP at end-
2013 and all OECS countries had debt levels greater than 70 percent of GDP (Table 2). The fact 
that more than half of the debt is external, nonconcessional, and held by commercial banks 
contributes to high debt service costs (on average, 3 percent of GDP in 2013), leaving the region 
with little fiscal space for growth-enhancing investment. A recent Bank Debt Sustainability 
Analysis shows that public debt levels in most OECS countries are unsustainable. Although 
some countries have embarked on debt restructuring since 2009, 9 these interventions have not 
been large enough to reestablish debt sustainability and market access in a durable way.

8 The CBI is a program established by some OECS governments to attract investors to make a substantial 
contribution to the development of the country in return for the opportunity to apply for citizenship and passport 
within the strict guidelines of the law. CBI programs are currently active in Antigua and Barbuda, St. Kitts and 
Nevis, Grenada, and Dominica.

Outlook 

9. 
Going forward, growth is expected to pick up gradually. As the economic activity of 
its main trading partners (the US, Europe -in particular the UK-, and Canada) recovers, the 
OECS’s external demand is projected to improve. Major growth drivers in the OECS, such as 
tourism, construction, and agriculture, are also expected to pick up, 10 thanks in part to several 
investment projects in the tourism sector that are under way across the region 11. Overall, growth 
is expected to pick up gradually to reach a regional average of around 3 percent annually over 
the medium term. 
10. However, declining FDI inflows and large current account deficits expose the region 
to increased volatility. FDI inflows to the OECS declined by 5 percentage points between 2008 
and 2012 (from 12.3 percent to 7.3 percent of GDP), shifting away from the OECS to other 
Caribbean destinations (Fig. 4). In parallel, the OECS’s average current account deficit has 
declined by more than 10 percentage points (from 28.7 percent of GDP in 2008 to 17.9 percent 
in 2013) because of lower imports and strong service receipts, mainly driven by the CBI 
program. However, the current account deficit is projected to remain high at 16 percent of GDP 
by 2017 as tourism receipts increase (from 19.5 percent of GDP in 2014 to 20.2 percent in 2017) 
but inflows from the CBI program slow down over the medium term. 

Figure 4: FDI/GDP in selected Caribbean countries 

Source: UNCTAD and WB staff calculations. 

10 Growth in tourism, construction, and agriculture is expected to increase from 1.7, 1.6, and 4.5 percent in 2013 to 
2.1, 2.8, and 4.6 percent in 2014, respectively. 
11 E.g., construction of Sandal Resort in Grenada and new international airport in St. Vincent and the Grenadines.

11. 
Financing needs in the region are high and sources volatile. Financing of the current 
account deficit has relied heavily on government borrowing and short-term flows into the 
banking sector. The region is also dependent on a number of nontraditional sources of financing, 
including the CBI programs, oil financing arrangements,  and non-market financing sources. 
Volatility associated with these sources of financing could expose OECS countries to important 
vulnerabilities. In particular, a disruption or modification of the terms of oil financing could 
affect the external accounts of OECS countries and generate fiscal pressures. And while the CBI 
programs have been a significant source of funding for several OECS countries in recent years 
(providing revenues equal to 13 percent of GDP in St. Kitts in 2013 and of nearly 4 percent in 
Dominica), they are uncertain, especially as such programs proliferate in the region (e.g., 
Antigua and Barbuda and Grenada restarted in 2013 and 2014, respectively). 
12. 
Financial sector stress creates additional downside risk. The ECCU financial sector 12 
has come under considerable stress as a result of the combination of exogenous and endogenous 
factors: (i) the global financial crisis; (ii) low economic growth; (iii) the insolvency in 2009 of 
two large insurers based in Trinidad with large presence in the ECCU; 13 (iv) weak underwriting 
criteria and risk management policies in banks; and (v) lack of a sufficiently robust regulatory 
framework and supervision. As a result, the quality of assets has deteriorated significantly, 
profitability has declined, and credit to the private sector has contracted during the last five 
years. The lack of a lender of last resort, a deposit insurance scheme, and fiscal space has 
prevented the authorities from effectively supporting weak institutions, leaving the financial 
sector vulnerable and unable to meet the intermediating needs of OECS economies. In addition, 
OECS countries stand at varying levels of compliance with anti-money laundering/countering 
the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) international standards, leaving financial institutions 
vulnerable to illicit financial activity. 

Poverty and Shared Prosperity 

B. 
13. 
Against the backdrop of low growth and persisting systemic vulnerabilities, poverty 
remains a concern. The scant availability of data on poverty and social indicators in the OECS 
limits the ability to carry out a disaggregated analysis of poverty and shared prosperity trends. 
The most recent poverty assessments are outdated and do not capture the effects of the global 
financial crisis. Overall, extreme poverty was lower in the Caribbean in 1999 than in the Latin 
America and Caribbean (LAC) region and it fell by more than 2 percentage point over the last 
decade. However, poverty declined faster in LAC, and the Caribbean economies are now lagging 
behind the LAC average (Fig. 5). 

12 OECS countries belong to the ECCU and share a common Central Bank, the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank 
(ECCB). The regulatory framework of the domestic banking system has two main legislative components: (i) the 
ECCB Agreement Act of 1983 and its amendments, which gives the ECCB the power to “regulate banking business 
on behalf of and in collaboration with Participating Governments”; and (ii) the Banking Acts of the various 
territories of the participating governments, which govern the regulation of banking business in those territories. The 
harmonized Banking Acts recognize the ECCB as the ECCU’s Central Bank, with primary responsibility for the 
supervision of domestic banks. The ultimate authority for regulating institutions covered by this Act is jointly vested 
in the Minister of Finance and the ECCB. The Minister of Finance is normally required to act in consultation with, 
and on the recommendation of, the ECCB with respect to areas in which the Minister has ultimate responsibility. 
13 British American Insurance Company (BAICO) and CLICO International Life sold policies to ECCU credit 
unions and banks, and total liabilities amounted to about 12 percent of the ECCU GDP.

Caribbean includes data from Belize, Dominica, Guyana, Jamaica, St. Lucia, Suriname, and Trinidad and Tobago. 

14. Official poverty rates vary from 18 to 38 percent (using each country’s national 
poverty line). Latest poverty assessments (Fig. 6) show relatively small rates of extreme poverty, 
but rates of moderate poverty are higher than would be suggested by OECS countries’ level of 
income. By contrast, inequality (measured by the Gini coefficient) is low (ranging from 36.6 in 
2008 in Grenada to 48 in 2006 in Antigua and Barbuda) compared to the LAC average of 52.9 in 
2009. The majority of poor people are in rural areas, where a large part of the population lives, 
and poverty is particularly prevalent among the indigenous population and female-headed 
households.

15. 
Unemployment has risen in most OECS countries in the aftermath of the global 
financial crisis. Lower demand for OECS exports and services resulting from the 2008 crisis 
exacerbated the already high pre-crisis levels of unemployment in most OECS countries (e.g., 
unemployment increased in St. Lucia from 14.7 percent in 2002 to 20.6 percent in 2012, and in 
Grenada from 10.2 percent in 2001 to 29 percent in 2010 -Fig. 7). Unemployment is in general 
higher among the poor, and reaches 35 percent of them in some OECS countries. Unemployment 
is also higher among women (e.g., in St. Vincent and the Grenadines, male unemployment is 
12.2 percent and female unemployment 26.2 percent). 
16. 
Youth unemployment is a source of particular concern. Available data suggest youth 
unemployment levels ranging from 34 percent in St Lucia to 42 percent in Grenada (Fig. 7). 
There is evidence that youth unemployment is higher among women (e.g., in St. Vincent and the 

10 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Grenadines, the male youth unemployment rate is 27.8 percent and the female youth 
unemployment rate is 41.4 percent). The growing number of young adults who are neither at 
school nor at work has a negative effect on labor force participation, crime, and other social 
issues. 14

17. While OECS countries have made overall progress in achieving the Millennium 
Development Goals (MDGs), challenges remain. Overall, human development indices are 
relatively high in the OECS, which rank between 63 and 88 among the 186 states in the United 
Nations Development Program’s Human Development Index. 15 16 Good progress has been 
achieved on the education MDGs: enrollment in primary education ranges between 90 and 100 
percent and in secondary education between 85 and 100 percent. The OECS is also on track for 
achieving the MDGs related to maternal and child health by 2015. 17 However, no information is 
available on the poverty MDG, and progress to reduce hunger by half (MDG1c) has been mixed 
(see Table 3): while hunger is very low in St. Vincent and the Grenadines and Dominica, hunger 
in Antigua and Barbuda and Grenada remains moderately high and has worsened over time; St. 
Kitts and Nevis and St. Lucia have made some progress in reducing hunger but remain relatively 

14 In the OECS, men’s experience of violence is generally linked to crime-, drug- and gang-related activities, while 
women are more likely to be exposed to sexual, domestic, and intimate partner violence. UNODC’s sex-
disaggregated data on homicide rates shows that in the subregion, males’ homicide rates are higher than females’, 
ranging from 66.7 per 100,000 people in Antigua and Barbuda to 93.3 per 100,000 people in St. Lucia (compared to 
33.3 and 6.7 per 100,000 people, respectively, for women).   
15 World Bank, OECS Overview, 2013. 
16 The production of timely and accurate national-level information on the MDGs has been challenging, leading to 
incomplete aggregation of data. The OECS Commission is taking the lead, working with other partners (WB, CDB, 
UNDP, UNICEF) on implementing the Sustainable Data Program for the Measurement of Living Conditions and 
mainstreaming a Multidimensional Approach to Poverty Measurement in the OECS.  This effort would have the 
dual objective of regularly generating reliable data to monitor different micro-dimensions of poverty, and of 
developing a new approach to national policy, planning, and development initiatives for the achievement of poverty 
reduction goals in the subregion, while enabling the measurement of progress in achieving the post-MDGs agenda. 
17 Under-five mortality (deaths of children per 100,000 live births) in the OECS has declined significantly since the 
early 1990s; estimates from 2011 show that in the OECS countries this indicator ranged from 7.4 to 20.9, which is 
considered “low mortality.” Maternal mortality rates—which range from 24 to 48 in 2010—are also low in the 
OECS; however, it must be noted that data are available only for Grenada, St. Lucia, and St. Vincent and the 
Grenadines.

(MDG7).

18. 
Similarly, OECS countries have made significant progress in closing the gender 
gaps in the last few decades, but challenges persist 18 (Table 4). Compared to the LAC region, 
OECS countries do relatively well with regards to girl enrollment in primary schools (which is at 
parity or close to parity with boys’), girls’ participation in tertiary education, and maternal 
mortality. However, significant gender gaps remain, especially with regards to the labor market, 
reproductive health, poverty, and parliamentary participation: 

• Education and employment. Girls generally outperform boys in the higher levels of 
education, with almost twice as many young women enrolled in tertiary education as 
young men. However, this does not translate into labor market opportunities: women 
face lower labor market participation (e.g., in 2012, in St. Lucia and St Vincent and 
the Grenadines, the female labor force participation was 62.6 percent and 55.7 
percent, respectively, 19 compared to male labor force participation of 76 percent and 
78.2 percent, respectively), lower wages, and higher unemployment rates than men 
(see Table 4). 
• Reproductive health. The OECS is characterized by close to universal access to 
prenatal care, births attended by skilled staff, and low maternal mortality rates. 
However, women aged 15 to 24 are three to six times more likely to contract 
HIV/AIDS than young men, and teenage pregnancy is a major concern: 40.3 percent

and Nevis, had their first child by the age of 19. 20  
• Poverty. Women living in rural areas are particularly vulnerable to poverty because 
they engage in unpaid domestic work, and as the limited job opportunities in rural 
areas mean higher unemployment and lower income for them. Also, female-headed 
households, which account for two-thirds of households, are more likely to be poor. 21

Challenges for Poverty Reduction and Shared Prosperity 

19. 
Lack of macroeconomic sustainability and existing structural bottlenecks have 
limited the OECS ability to grow faster, reduce poverty, and promote shared prosperity. 
The low growth OECS countries have experienced over the last decades is partly due to a weak 
macroeconomic framework and sluggish implementation of structural reforms. In addition, 
OECS have experienced declining competitiveness, resulting both from structural cost 
disadvantages (in part due to the OECS economies’ small sizes) and poor policy choices, which 
have led to decreasing productivity, employment generation, and growth in key sectors. 
Inefficiencies in the public sector have led to inflated fiscal imbalances and public debt, and poor 
public services, putting a further drag on macroeconomic sustainability, growth, and poverty 
reduction. Finally, high vulnerability to economic shocks and natural disasters has hampered 
growth and affected OECS households, which are poorly equipped to manage the impact of 
shocks and adapt to changing circumstances. 

Weak Competitiveness 

20. 
Inadequate access to finance, investment climate, connectivity, electricity costs, use 
of ICT, and innovation and entrepreneurship, affect the competitiveness of OECS 
economies, leading to lower FDI, private sector (especially SME) investment, exports, and job 
creation, and ultimately limiting growth, shared prosperity, and poverty reduction. The most 
recent (2010) Enterprise Survey reveals that private firms consider that the lack of access to 

13 

finance is the single most important constraint to their development, followed by the lack of 
affordable electricity, an inadequately trained work force, followed by specific concerns related 
to the investment climate (Fig. 8).

21. 
The financial sector, though large in terms of financial assets over GDP and number 
of institutions, does not provide sufficient intermediation to support economic growth. 
Financial system assets in the OECS represent 200 percent of regional GDP, on par with 
countries with well-developed financial systems. The financial sector comprises 40 commercial 
banks (14 domestic banks and 26 branches or subsidiaries of five foreign banks), 67 credit 
unions, and 61 insurance companies (on a consolidated basis) (Table 5). However, many of the 
institutions are small and offer a limited range of financial services. In particular, due to a 
number of constraints (including investment climate, credit infrastructure, and creditor rights 
constraints), banks provide mostly consumer loans and lines of credit to larger firms, and limited 
services to SMEs. In addition, bank credit to the private sector has been declining over the last 
five years 22 as stress on the financial sector has grown. Further, alternatives to credit are scarce 
as capital markets, venture capital, leasing, and factoring are underdeveloped.

22. 
In addition to poor access to finance, there remains, despite good progress in 
selected areas, constraints in the investment climate, which hurt small and medium-sized 
enterprises (SMEs) and FDI. While in general OECS countries rank well compared to their 
Latin American peers with regards to investor protection, construction permits, the availability of 
electricity, and regulations to start a business, severe constraints remain with regards to getting 
credit, registering property, enforcing contracts, resolving insolvency, and, in some jurisdictions, 
paying taxes (Fig. 9). Weaknesses in the investment climate penalize SMEs disproportionally, 
but are also an obstacle to resume growth in FDIs. Enhancing growth and job creation will 
require fostering faster development of the private sector, including through FDI and an 
enhanced contribution of SMEs, which dominate the corporate sector in the OECS, with 96.3 
percent of the total number of firms and 75.8 percent of employees and have thus a crucial role 
to play to achieve a more inclusive growth (Table 6).

23. 
Competitiveness is also eroded by high logistics costs and poor transport 
connectivity. A recent review suggests that OECS ports are relatively well developed and well 
equipped, given their traffic, but that the cost of import and export movements is prohibitive. On 
average, OECS import costs amount to US$2,000/container, four times more than in Singapore 
(considered best practice) and 30 percent higher than in other Caribbean countries. Similarly, 
export costs are twice as large as best practice in the world and 25 percent larger than in the rest 
of the Caribbean and similar island states (i.e., Pacific Islands) 23 . For imports, the main driver of 
costs is the cost of customs and document handling and for exports it is inefficient inland 
transportation, which accounts for about 50 percent of export costs. Air transport is also a 
challenge, as the inter-island system is not reliable and is not coordinated with larger 
outside/international carriers 24. This seriously limits the development of stay-over tourism (as 
opposed to cruise-based tourism), which represents a key growth opportunity for OECS 
economies but would require better regional coordination of air transport systems and intra-
island transportation. 
24. 
The cost of electricity in the OECS is among the highest in the world, creating an 
additional constraint on competitiveness and poverty reduction. While the availability of 
electricity is generally good, the cost of electricity if prohibitively expensive and a significant 
constraint to the competitiveness of OECS economies and to shared prosperity. In 2011 the 
average residential electricity tariffs in the OECS ranged from US$0.27 per kWh in St. Lucia to 
US$0.41 in Dominica, compared to US$0.19 on average in LAC (Fig. 10). The high price of 
electricity in the OECS largely reflects the high cost of producing electricity in systems that are 
small, 25 isolated, and primarily dependent on expensive fuel oil (diesel and heavy fuel oil 
accounted for 77-100 percent of electricity generation in 2011). This price has a sharp impact on 
the competitiveness of key sectors, including tourism. 26 Moreover, pollution from the heavy use 
of fuel oil affects the local environment (which in turn further affects tourism), and produces 
greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change. Electricity costs also cause hardship to 
private consumers, particularly poor households, who can spend as much as 7-11 percent of their 
income on electricity. 27 In addition, if the full cost of electricity supply is not passed on through 
tariffs, the subsidies used to cover the gap undermine the financial stability of utilities and create 
fiscal liabilities. Finally, OECS countries import all their oil, which exposes them to price and 
supply shocks and enhances their economic vulnerability. 

23 Briceno-Garmendia et al. (2014), Connectivity for Caribbean Countries, World Bank, CGF, June 2014. 
24 OECS countries do not seem to face a physical infrastructure challenge in the transport sector. They have a high 
density of airports (seven international and four intercontinental) with a capacity of about 4 million passengers each 
year. The proven demand is about 1 million tourists each year, and the aggregate population a little over 600,000. 
The challenge is with the systems and regional coordination. By constrast, traffic within the OECS is cumbersome; 
it is dominated by a monopolist air operator that controls schedules, characterized by the lack of interlining that 
creates baggage losses and delays (among other things), and framed in old-fashioned immigration requirements 
among OECS countries. Briceno-Garmendia et al. (2013), Connectivity for the OECS Countries: An Initial Step for 
an Assessment of the Caribbean Connectivity, Paper Presented in the Regional Workshop of the CGF in the 
Bahamas, June 2013. 
25 The installed generation capacity in OECS islands ranged between 46 and 98MW in 2011. The total installed 
capacity for the entire region is only 373 MW (vs., for example, 3,000 MW in the Dominican Republic only). 
26 A charge for a guest night in a 50-100 room hotel includes an estimated US$14-18 in electricity costs, as each 
room night consumes an average of 44 kWh of electricity, at tariffs ranging from US$0.32-0.40 per kWh; Caribbean 
Hotel Energy Efficiency Action Program benchmarks, 2012.

25. However, the abundance of renewable energy sources (solar, wind, and geothermal) 
in the OECS provides an opportunity. Dominica and St. Vincent and the Grenadines generate, 
respectively, 23 percent and 12 percent of their electricity using hydropower, but other OECS 
countries generate only 3 percent or less from renewables. Nonetheless, OECS countries have 
the potential to better diversify their energy matrix through more renewables, thereby reducing 
their dependence on imported fossil fuels, enhancing the reliability of their energy supply, and 
lowering electricity costs over the long run. Achieving the appropriate balance of base-load 
renewables, such as geothermal energy, and intermittent sources such as solar and wind power, 
will be critical to meet future demand while enabling a decrease in electricity tariffs. Widespread 
integration of renewable energy will require changes to the power sector business model and will 
present challenges. Geothermal power, in particular, involves an initial high risk associated with 
exploration and high up-front costs. However, when judiciously combined with measures to 
enhance energy efficiency, greater use of multiple renewable energy alternatives can help boost 
the region’s competitiveness and reduce its vulnerability to high and volatile fuel prices. 
Increasing the provision of renewable energy is also important for maintaining a clean 
environment, which is critical for sustaining tourism and improving health. Access to sustainable 
sources of clean, reliable, and affordable energy will also enhance the provision of services, 
including the operations of hospitals and schools. 
26. Higher reliance on ICT also has the potential to increase competitiveness in the 
OECS. ICT connectivity remains weak in the OECS as a result of low broadband penetration, 
limited competition, unfinished liberalization, and high prices for services and devices. While the 
region is served by several fiber-optic submarine cables (overcapacity exists in many places), 
there is no effective competition in the provision of international services. 28 The result is 

28 In most countries, former incumbent operators still control international facilities, and cables are not subject to 
open access regulatory regimes. Similar challenges exist at the national transmission levels, where there are few 
competitors.

inequitable access to ICT, which constrains the region’s capacity to compete in the global 
economy and its options to improve competitiveness, create jobs, explore digital industries 
opportunities, and enhance public service delivery. However, OECS governments recognize that 
ICT is a critical tool for improving competitiveness and service delivery, increasing citizens’ 
capacity to provide feedback to the authorities, and creating job and growth opportunities in 
digital industries. 
27. 
Increased 
innovation and entrepreneurship are also needed 
to enhance 
competitiveness. Innovation and entrepreneurship are limited in the OECS, as exemplified by 
the percentages of firms that develop or introduce new products. This is particularly problematic 
for OECS countries, whose main challenge is to foster job creation and economic growth, as 
innovation and entrepreneurship play a crucial role in strengthening economic competitiveness. 
Innovative entrepreneurs are indeed often the drivers that spur growth and competitiveness by 
creating jobs and delivering new products, services, and business models to underserved 
markets. 29 In this context, innovative growth enterprises can help address some of the most 
significant social, environmental, and economic challenges of the OECS. For example, ICT 
enterprises offer opportunities to promote youth employment and foster regional digital industry 
development. Similarly, climate technology enterprises can help traditional industries, such as 
tourism and agri-processing, to mitigate and adapt to climate change challenges and ensure 
energy and resource efficiency. Unleashing the potential of innovation and entrepreneurship is 
therefore critical to OECS’s economic integration and increased competitiveness (Fig. 11).

Low Productivity and Growth in Leading Industries  

28. 
Tourism is an important source of employment, economic activity, and growth in 
the OECS. OECS countries have limited options for economic diversification because of the 

29 See Global Competitiveness Report (2013-2014). 

18 

 
                                                      
small size of their markets and their limited endowments 30 and tourism has been the main pillar 
of their economic growth. While there are some differences across countries, the average total 
economic contribution 31 of tourism for the six independent OECS countries has represented 
roughly 60 percent of export earnings, 30 percent of GDP, and 30 percent of total employment 
(Fig. 12). Tourism is also an important source of foreign exchange. A competitive and robust 
tourism sector is thus critical to OECS economies, especially since the sector has significant 
linkages to such other areas of economic activity as construction, agribusiness, and financial 
services. 

Figure 12: The total contribution of travel and tourism to GDP and employment (percent) 

Source: Country Reports, World Travel and Tourism Council (2012). 

29. While global demand for tourism has been evolving, tourism in the OECS continues 
to rely on markets and products with lower growth or lower local benefits. In terms of 
markets, the OECS countries have mostly relied on traditional tourist markets (the USA, Canada, 
the UK, and the Caribbean). While there has been a very marginal growth in the North American 
markets, the flow of tourists from the UK and the Caribbean has been shrinking since 2012. 
OECS countries have been less successful in attracting tourists from Europe or countries fueling 
growth in global tourism, including Brazil, Russia, India, and China. From a product perspective, 
tourism in the OECS is dominated by cruise-based travel, while the development of stay-over 
resort tourism represents one of the most important opportunities for OECS economies. Indeed, 
OECS cruise visitors are between 2.5 and 3 times more numerous than stay-over visitors; yet 
spending by stay-over tourists can be about ten times higher than that of cruise ship visitor. In 
addition, tourism in OECS countries has been heavily dependent on all-inclusive resorts, a model 
that has lower impacts on shared prosperity at the local level than such emerging tourism 
segments as nature, eco-, and cultural tourism. Overall, while tourism is the lead economic sector 
in the OECS countries, the share of OECS countries in international tourism is less than 0.2 
percent of world tourism arrivals (Table 7). Even with respect to tourism in the wider Caribbean, 
the OECS represent a market share of no more than 7 percent, a share that has been on the 
decline over the last two decades.

30. 
The recent OECS Common Tourism Policy provides an opportunity to expand into 
growing tourism niches while creating greater linkages with local economies. The 2011 
OECS Common Tourism Policy envisages tourism as an industry that is viable, internationally 
competitive, and resilient. It identifies a large number of policy areas requiring work to improve 
the region’s tourism competitiveness: redefining market niches and developing new products, 
increasing community participation and sectoral linkages, better training the tourism workforce, 
enhancing regional coordination, strengthening marketing at regional level, addressing access 
and transportation issues, ensuring environmental and cultural sustainability, addressing crime 
that involves visitors, and strengthening data collection and research. An enhanced focus on 
tourism destinations and attracting visitors to authentic places would enable the OECS to tap into 
this fastest-growing tourism market, with high labor intensity and deep linkages with local 
communities. Doing so would provide more stable employment opportunities and promote 
greater shared prosperity (a high share of tourism employment (75 percent) is indeed typically 
for unskilled or semi-skilled labor, and tourism-related labor is highly inclusive of women, 
youth, and marginalized social groups) 32. 
31. 
In addition, strengthening the tourism sector’s linkages with other sectors, such as 
agribusiness, would multiply the growth and job creation spillover effects. Since 2000, the 
decline in the production and export of sugar and bananas has meant a dramatic decline in 
agriculture’s contribution to GDP in the OECS 33. More recently, data gathered by the Eastern 
Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB) reveals a modest upward trend in the sector’s contribution to 
regional GDP, from 2.93 percent in 2007 to 3.2 percent in 2011, with about 3.5 percent projected 
for 2014, resulting from an increased contribution of nontraditional crops—from 1.77 percent of 
GDP in 2007 to 2.01 percent in 2011. Further efforts to support resumption in the growth of 

32 In general, women are overrepresented as employees in the service sector in the LAC region, and particularly so in 
the Caribbean. For example, data from Antigua and Barbuda (2010) indicate that 93.8 percent of all female 
employees are in the service sector.

agriculture could have a significant impact on shared prosperity, especially in rural areas, as 
many smallholders would stand to gain. It addition, it could yield significant economic benefits, 
especially by reducing hotels’ dependence on imports. According to a survey conducted in 2008 
by the World Bank Group with hotels, cruise lines and marinas in the region, while most hotels 
procure services locally, very few purchase local agricultural goods, as local production is 
neither competitive nor large enough to accommodate hotels´ demand. According to this survey, 
only 32 percent of tourism food demand is currently sourced locally 34. Separately, based on a 
2011 study, 89 percent of meat, 81 percent of dairy products, and 41 percent of fruits and 
vegetables consumed by the region’s tourism sector are imported. 
32. 
To reap the benefits of stronger linkages between agribusiness and tourism, the 
OECS needs to improve the productivity of the agribusiness value chain. Revenue 
generation in agriculture has been compromised by sensitive ecosystems, vulnerability to climate 
shocks and climate change, historical dependence on a few key export commodities, and 
dependence on food imports. To address these challenges, it is necessary to link producers and 
processors to markets, provide incentives for the adoption of improved technologies to make 
crops more resilient and productive, and improve skills at the farm level (with a focus on small 
farmers) to enable farmers to increase productivity, comply with standards and adapt to markets, 
and be better prepared to deal with climate change and natural disasters. While such reforms may 
take time to generate their full impact, their spillover effects on poverty reduction can be large. 
33. 
Stronger links between tourism and agriculture could benefit the poorest segments 
of the population, who mostly live in rural areas. Currently, all the OECS countries are net 
food importers, and the negative trade balance has been growing since the late 1990s. According 
to a survey of hotels, cruise lines, and marinas, only 32 percent of tourism food demand is 
currently sourced locally. Ensuring that more goods and services in the tourism supply chain 
come from local sources would help maximize the proportion of tourism spending that is 
retained in local communities, and would involve the poor in the supply process. Creating a 
stronger link between tourism and agribusiness could facilitate this and help reduce foreign 
exchange leakage for food purchases. 

Inefficient Public Sector 

34. 
Public sector modernization would help the OECS countries enhance their fiscal 
and debt sustainability, improve the provision of public services, and leverage private 
investments. Greater efforts need to be done across the OECS to implement structural reforms 
and establish the foundations of a sound macroeconomic framework. Reducing fiscal deficits and 
public debt levels are a priority to create the fiscal space needed to support growth-enhancing 
investments, conduct countercyclical policies, and mitigate the impact of shocks. Doing this 
requires improving public financial management (PFM), fiscal management, and debt 
management. At the same time, increased institutional capacity and better management of 
government institutions would enable more effective delivery of public services, increased 
capacity for public-private partnerships (PPPs) and greater leverage of private investment in 
infrastructure and service provision. 
35. OECS governments are committed to implement fiscal consolidation measures to 
reduce fiscal deficits and promote sound and prudent debt management. Recognizing that 

34 World Bank, 2008. 

21 

                                                      
the accumulation of debt pulls resources away from more productive uses, 35 OECS governments 
have indicated (in the OECS Growth and Development Strategy and in the ECCB Eight Point 
Stabilization and Growth Program) their desire to reach, by 2020, the debt-to-GDP ratio of 60 
percent recommended by the ECCB, through a combination of measures to enhance fiscal 
discipline and growth performance. 
36. 
Public administration systems need modernization to generate enough fiscal gains to 
enhance the sustainability of public finances and improve the delivery of public services. 
While several OECS countries have engaged into public sector modernization efforts, PFM 
should generally be further strengthened to increase links between planning and budgeting, 
improve cash management by taking advantage of information generated by integrated financial 
management information systems, reduce manual processes in treasury administration (using, for 
instance, a Treasury Single Account system), integrate systems (e.g., tax, customs, budget, debt 
management), and enhance the supervision of state-owned enterprises in terms of corporate 
governance and fiscal risks. Improving statistical capacity to collect data and monitor the impact 
of governments’ and development partners’ programs, particularly on poverty and shared 
prosperity, is also a priority36. 
37. Greater use of PPPs provides an opportunity to improve the delivery of key services 
and fill in key infrastructure needs. Across the region, boosting economic growth, shared 
prosperity, and resilience will require meeting significant infrastructure and social investment 
needs. Driven by a combination of tight fiscal constraints and growing appreciation of the role of 
the private sector in delivering public services, OECS governments are increasingly considering 
PPPs to meet those needs. The recent “Caribbean Infrastructure PPP Roadmap” found a current 
pipeline of 14 potential PPPs. When selected, structured, and managed well, PPPs can help make 
the best use of the financial and technical resources of the public and private sectors to provide 
improved infrastructure assets and services. To do so however, it is critical to increase capacity 
in the public administration to manage such partnerships, including at regional level, as well as 
to prepare potential projects to best international standards. 

Social Vulnerabilities 

38. While access to social services is strong in the OECS, structural weaknesses affect 
the effectiveness of these services and expose large social vulnerabilities. OECS countries 
provide a range of safety net programs and labor market interventions. But while safety net 
programs and spending levels are in line with global averages, the programs suffer from high 
fragmentation and duplication, spending 
inefficiencies, capacity deficiencies, 
targeting 
inadequacies, and limited ability to respond to exogenous shocks. These factors hamper the 
effectiveness of social protection spending, limit coverage, and restrict impact on human capital 
development. Overall, the systems have proven largely insufficient to facilitate resilience and 
protect vulnerable populations during the economic crisis. 
39. 
Despite universal education coverage, education quality is weak and learning 
achievements are low. Large segments of the population leave the education system with 
limited skills. For instance, the percentage of students passing five or more Caribbean Secondary 

35 Esteban Pèrez Caldentey (2007), “Debt in CARICOM: Origins and Consequences for Growth and Economic 
Development” in Business, Finance and Economics in Emerging Economies 2(1). 
36 See Annex VI, “Monitoring and Evaluation.” 

22 

                                                      
Education Certificate subjects, including English and mathematics, ranges from only 20 percent 
in Grenada and St. Vincent and the Grenadines to 35 percent in Dominica. In 2011, 67 percent of 
students achieved grades I-III in English, and 35 percent achieved the same grade range in 
mathematics. 37 In addition, the skills generated by the education system do not meet labor 
market expectations and the lack of adequate skills is cited as a top constraint by firms (Fig. 9).38 
In the OECS fewer than half of mathematics and English teachers, and fewer than 20 percent of 
science teachers, are qualified to teach their subjects 39 . The lack of teaching and learning 
standards and weak school-level leadership contribute to the poor quality of education. 
Improving education quality and outcomes in the OECS would go a long way to enhance the 
employability of the workforce and support job creation and growth. Evidence shows indeed that 
a difference of one standard deviation in test scores between countries equates to roughly two 
percentage points in annual long-term GDP growth. Better education would also contribute to 
greater shared prosperity, as children from poorer households perform worse than their richer 
peers in school.  
40. 
Noncommunicable diseases also place a heavy economic burden on households and 
the economy, slowing growth, increasing human vulnerability, weakening resilience, and 
affecting the productivity of the workforce. As a result, OECS households are poorly equipped to 
profit from opportunities, adapt to changing circumstances, and manage the impact of shocks. 
About 70 percent of years of life lost in the OECS are due to noncommunicable diseases 
(NCDs), a much higher rate than either the global average (50 percent) or the average for low- 
and middle-income countries in the Americas (60 percent). Moreover, the burden of NCDs falls 
most heavily on the poor, taking a greater toll on their already low incomes (e.g., poorer 
households in St. Lucia spend 48 percent of their per capita expenditure on health care, while 
better-off households spend less than 20 percent), lowering their productivity, and compromising 
their chances of moving out of poverty. There is also a gender dimension to NCDs, as risk 
factors affect men and women differently: 40 NCDs also represent a heavy fiscal burden (e.g., 
Antigua and Barbuda spends US$2.4 million a year on health care for diabetics, and St. Vincent 
and the Grenadines, US$1.8 million).

countries, whereas hypertension, alcohol consumption and tobacco use generally affect more men There is not a 
uniform trend in the OECS countries in terms of whether there is a higher premature mortality rate (under age of 70 
per 100,000 population) due to cerebrovascular disease and diabetes among men as compared to women. However, 
the OECS averages show that men are more likely to die prematurely from cerebrovascular disease (19.9, as 
compared to 9.8 among women), while women are more likely to die prematurely from diabetes than men (28.1 and 
20.2, respectively).

Vulnerability to Climate Change  

41. OECS countries are among the countries in the world that are most exposed to 
natural hazards in terms of GDP and population at risk. Climate-related hazards are more 
common than earthquakes in the region. Major climatic hazards include strong winds and heavy 
rains often associated with the annual formation of tropical depressions, storms, and hurricanes, 
causing floods and landslides. 41.The region is also at significant risk of storm surges, drought, 
and volcanic eruptions. Ground-shaking, liquefaction, tsunamis, and landslides—harder to 
forecast—occur with little or no warning, often resulting in significant loss of life and structural 
damage. Most of the buildings in the region were not built to appropriate seismic-resistant 
standards, so a large earthquake event could also have catastrophic consequences. Between 1993 
and 2012, average OECS annual losses from natural disasters reached 4.3 percent of GDP (Fig. 
13). Single events can have devastating impacts on OECS economies (Fig. 13). For example, 
Hurricane Ivan (2004) damages amounted to over 200 percent of Grenada’s GDP, and Hurricane 
George (1998) caused damages amounting to 140 percent of St. Kitts and Nevis’s GDP. The 
frequency and impact of natural disasters have been growing in OECS countries (Fig. 14), 
increasing vulnerabilities significantly.

41 For instance, on December 24, 2013, a brief tropical storm in St. Vincent and the Grenadines and St. Lucia 
produced extraordinarily intense rainfall at a time that was well outside the traditional hurricane season. Over a 
three-hour period, St. Vincent and the Grenadines received 278 millimeters (mm) of rain and St. Lucia 224 mm. 
Total damages were assessed at approximately 15 and 7 percent, respectively, of the GDP of the two countries.

Vulnerability to natural disasters affects OECS growth and prosperity prospects 
significantly. The average annual losses incurred by OECS countries from extreme weather 
events range from about one percent of GDP in St Vincent and the Grenadines to a very high 
nine percent in Grenada (Fig. 15). Similarly, average annual life losses are very significant 
across the region. Such losses create a significant challenge for OECS governments as they 
endeavor to create sustained economic growth and prosperity. Therefore, enhanced disaster risk 
resilience is fundamental for the OECS to ensure sustainable and inclusive growth.

43. Going forward, increased threats to marine and coastal resources in the OECS may 
have further negative effects on tourism and growth. The natural resource base, the engine 
that drives tourism and fosters private sector growth and jobs in the OECS, is at risk as oceans 
become dumping grounds for industrial and urban solid waste and sewerage, agricultural run-off, 
and marine-based pollution (e.g., sewage from yachts). Other factors, such as ocean temperature 
increases that are due to climate change and point source pollution, have also had a marked 
destructive impact on these resources. The result, highly visible to tourists, is a noticeable 
decline in marine life, degraded corals, and declining fish varieties and stock. A degraded marine 
base could seriously affect tourism and other sectors of the economy, and highlights the 
importance of promoting a sustainable ocean-based (blue) economy in the OECS.

2. NATIONAL AND REGIONAL VISIONS  

44. 
The OECS governments recognize the fundamental challenge of resuming growth 
and competitiveness in the region. In their national development strategies, OECS countries 
acknowledge the importance of addressing the persistently high unemployment rate, especially 
among youth. They also mention the importance of addressing their vulnerability to economic 
and natural shocks. They recognize fiscal deficits and high debt levels as the main constraint for 
governments’ action. The weaknesses of both the financial sector and the current business 
environment are major concerns. Tourism, agriculture, ICT, and energy are recognized as the 
main drivers of future growth. The OECS countries emphasize the importance of modernizing 
the state and developing effective social protection systems, and they agree that better-quality 
education and appropriate skills are needed to meet job market demands. 
45. 
The OECS regional vision is anchored on the Revised Treaty of Basseterre (June 
2010), establishing the OECS Economic Union, and the OECS Growth and Development 
Strategy. The Treaty led to the creation of a single financial and economic space within which 
goods, people, and capital move freely; monetary and fiscal policies are harmonized; and 
countries take a common approach to trade, health, education and environment, as well as to the 
development of critical sectors such as agriculture, tourism, and energy. The 2012 OECS Growth 
and Development Strategy provides directions for the region’s development over the next ten 
years. Its key objectives are to achieve economic transformation, growth, employment, poverty 
reduction and better human development, with a focus on structural reforms geared towards 
boosting private investment and productivity, recognizing in particular the role that tourism, 
creative industries, ICT, education and health, and environment management can play. In 2013, 
an OECS Growth and Development Strategy Action Plan outlined short, medium, and long-term 
activities in the areas of tourism, agriculture and the creative industries among others. In 2014, 
the Director General of the OECS Commission presented a new OECS regional vision, based on 
three pillars: (i) consolidation of the institutional architecture of the union; (ii) facilitation of the 
free movement of people and capital; and (iii) security and well-being of OECS citizens, founded 
on an effective job creation strategy across the single economic space.  
46. 
This Regional Partnership Strategy (RPS) is consistent with the strategic directions 
of the OECS Growth and Development Strategy and relevant national and regional OECS 
policies, strategies, and papers 42. The RPS also takes into account the vision expressed by the 
Governor of the ECCB and developed in two main documents (i.e., the “8 Point Stabilization and 
Growth Plan” of 2009 and “Challenges to ECCU Stability and Growth” of 2013), which identify 
the major challenges faced by the OECS in the aftermath of the global financial crisis and 
propose a focus on four key areas: i) financial stability, ii) debt management, iii) fiscal reforms, 
and iv) growth and competitiveness. 

42 For example, at the regional level: the OECS Common Tourism Policy (OECS Commission, 2011); the OECS 
Education Strategy (OECS Commission, 2013); A Framework for Regional Growth and Development in 
CARICOM (CARICOM, 2013); Structural Change for Equality: An Integrated Approach to development (ECLAC, 
2012). At the national level: National Economic and Social Transformation Plan (Antigua and Barbuda, 2009); 
Growth and Social Protection Strategy 2014-18 (Commonwealth of Dominica, 2014); Growth and Poverty 
Reduction Strategy 2012-16 (Grenada, 2012); Adaptation Strategy in Response to the new Sugar Regime 2006-13 
(St. Kitts and Nevis, 2006); Medium term Development Strategic Plan 2012-16 (St. Lucia, 2011); and the National 
Economic and Social Development Plan 2013-2025 (St. Vincent and the Grenadines, 2013). See also Annex VIII, 
“Compendium of National and Regional Strategies.”

3. WORLD BANK GROUP PARTNERSHIP 

A. Lessons Learned from the Previous RPS  

47. 
Lessons resulting from the Completion Report of the OECS RPS for 2010-14 have 
been incorporated into the design of this RPS. The RPS for 2010-2014 was implemented 
under difficult circumstances as the stagnation brought about by the continued sluggish global 
economy, the scarcity of readily available opportunities to diversify, and recurrent natural 
disasters placed the OECS economies under stress. The World Bank Group (WBG) responded by 
increasing attention to such issues as economic growth and employment, sustainability, the 
financial sector, and energy. Overall, delivery of the program met expectations, but because of 
some partial shortfalls, the Completion Report rated the RPS’s contribution to development 
outcomes as moderately satisfactory. The new RPS builds on the efforts of the previous strategy. 
The following are key lessons learned from the implementation of the RPS 2010-14 that have 
been taken into consideration in designing the new strategy: 
• Objectives set under the RPS should be aligned with the capacity of the WBG program to 
deliver (available instruments and capacity to influence results); 
• The RPS results framework must reflect as accurately as possible the outcomes and impact of 
the program (i.e., scope of engagement and achievements); 
• The RPS support for regional integration through a combination of regional work and 
country-level interventions worked well and should be further enhanced; 
• A regional perspective would enhance opportunities for the IFC to contribute to growth and 
inclusion, bringing to bear the IFC’s innovative practices, expertise, and finance; 
• Flexibility to respond to evolving circumstances through innovative products or activities is 
critical (e.g., Comprehensive Debt Framework, Caribbean Growth Forum); 
• Caribbean countries have found it difficult to undertake reforms in the past, often because of 
political economy factors; and 
• Selectivity can help improve focus and delivery of results. 

B. Consultations 

48. 
This RPS draws on extensive strategic consultations with different partners and 
stakeholders. In-depth consultations were conducted with governments and representatives of 
the private sector (including through the OECS Business Council) and civil society, both in-
country and in Washington, DC. 43 Bilateral and multilateral partners, as well as the OECS 
Commission and the ECCB, were also extensively consulted at different times in the process. A 
Client Survey was carried out in the OECS 44 in 2013, and its results were taken into account in 
designing the strategy. The RPS also capitalizes on the wide-reaching participatory process of 
the Caribbean Growth Forum (CGF), which informs programming in the areas of skills and 
productivity, investment climate, and logistics 45. 

43 Specifically, representatives of the private sector and civil society organizations have been consulted on this RPS 
in Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica, Grenada, St. Lucia, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines. 
44 See Annex IX on the results of the Client Survey conducted in Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica, Grenada, and St. 
Vincent and the Grenadines. 
45 See Annex VII, “Caribbean Growth Forum.”

49. 
Stakeholders support the proposed RPS framework and its objectives. There was 
broad agreement on giving priority to activities that could help lay the foundations for growth 
and competitiveness and stimulate job creation in the OECS countries. Stakeholders also agreed 
that particular attention should be paid to the role and soundness of the financial sector, and 
public sector modernization is also high among their priorities. In addition, attention to social 
safety nets and disaster risk management were requested to enhance OECS’s resilience. 

C. Country and Regional Engagement  

Figure 16: Comprehensive Debt Framework (CDF) 

50. 
This RPS applies a systematic filtering process to define relevant areas of 
engagement. Four filters have been used: (i) client demand and commitment; (ii) “line of sight” 
to the twin corporate goals; (iii) potential to achieve highest impact in the OECS, in line with the 
diagnostic presented above, and (iv) WBG comparative advantage. 46 The RPS also takes into 
account the assistance provided by other development partners. 
51. 
 The OECS Regional Partnership Strategy (RPS) for FY15-19 is consistent with the 
holistic approach adopted by the OECS Governments to tackle the long-standing issues of 
low growth and debt sustainability. The OECS countries acknowledge the multifaceted nature 
of 
their challenges and have 
elaborated 
their 
own 
vision 
considering that improvements in 
competitiveness, 
reduction 
in 
sovereign 
debt 
levels, 
fiscal 
adjustments 
to 
ensure macro 
sustainability, 
and 
enhanced 
resilience to shocks are interrelated 
aspects all critical to resume and 
sustain inclusive growth. The Bank 
has supported this approach and, at 
the 
request of 
the Heads of 
Government of CARICOM, has 
elaborated 
the Comprehensive 
Debt 
Framework 
(CDF). 
Structured around four pillars, the 
Comprehensive Debt Framework 
(CDF) is designed to address the 
interdependent structural causes of 
high debt and low growth in small island states by (i) promoting private-sector led growth, (ii) 
strengthening fiscal management, (iii) building resilience to natural disasters, and (iv) improving 
debt management. The CDF is the context in which the Bank undertakes its dialogue with the 
OECS and defines its assistance program.

52. 
As there is merit in seeking greater regional integration but implementation of 
regional programs has proven difficult, the RPS will support country programs under 
regional frameworks. For the OECS, the greatest benefits from economic integration will come 

46 Comparative advantage was defined as measuring the WBG’s global experience, its analytic understanding, and 
the success of its engagement in a given area.  

28 

 
                                                      
from taking advantage of economies of scale, sharing risk, generating cross-country spillovers, 
rationalizing the provision of public services, eliminating duplication of administrative 
structures, and better representing the region in international fora. Achieving economies of scale 
will also allow IFC and MIGA to play a stronger development role and increase opportunities for 
investment in the OECS. However, despite recent efforts towards regional integration, progress 
has been uneven. This RPS proposes a systematic, yet pragmatic, approach to regional 
integration by offering individual countries a menu of options under a regional operation 
framework; this arrangement will foster regional approaches in critical areas and has potential to 
generate cross-country spillovers, while allowing countries to select the mix that suits their 
priorities best and tailor support for reforms to their needs, for greatest ownership and 
effectiveness. Accordingly, the Bank will prepare regional programs supporting regional 
approaches where suitable, and implemented through tailored country-level loans, using 
Investment Project Financing for “Series of Projects”. 
53. 
The proposed engagement model aims at maximizing impact by leveraging a 
tailored package of WBG financial, knowledge, and convening services, including a 
strategic use of trust funds. To build knowledge in areas critical to the RPS objective, analytic 
and advisory activities (AAA) will support each area of lending engagement. In each objective 
area, support will be provided by the Bank, IFC, and MIGA as relevant and feasible. 47 MIGA 
and, to some extent, IFC currently acknowledge limited opportunities for engagement because of 
the small size of the OECS markets. They will, however, endeavor to seek potential 
opportunities for engagement, possibly at regional level. In high-income OECS countries 
(Antigua and Barbuda and St. Kitts and Nevis), the Bank will move toward a model that is 
increasingly based on reimbursable advisory services. Trust funds will be sought to complement 
the limited IDA/IBRD envelope and enable more effective results in each area of engagement. 
54. Gender, environmental, and institutional capacity considerations are critical and 
will be mainstreamed in activities, where relevant. As relevant, WBG interventions will 
include a gender perspective to enhance the development outcomes. Concerns about 
environmental sustainability will be mainstreamed throughout the program, as will capacity-
building efforts. Indeed, much of the program seeks not only the delivery of specific sector 
outcomes, but also the building of capacity and institutions to sustain achievements over the long 
haul.  

D. Proposed World Bank Group FY15-19 Partnership Strategy 

55. 
The overall strategic goal of this RPS is to support the OECS in laying foundations 
for sustainable inclusive growth. To pursue this high-level objective, the RPS activities are 
organized around three areas of engagement; all ranked as high priorities by governments and 
stakeholders: competitiveness, public sector modernization, and resilience (Fig. 17).  

47 St. Vincent and the Grenadines is the only OECS country that is not also a member of IFC.

56. 
The proposed RPS program is aligned with the WBG Strategy and the twin 
corporate goals of reducing extreme poverty and boosting shared prosperity.  Establishing a 
sound investment climate, including ICT and transport connectivity and lowering the cost of 
electricity, would help eliminating obstacles to growth and private sector development, and 
attracting FDI, which are all necessary to create jobs and new sources of wealth. Strengthening 
the financial system would help reducing fiscal risk, for governments with limited fiscal space 
and rising debt, and potential negative spillovers on the most vulnerable. The limited capacity of 
the financial system to support private sector development is an obstacle to investments and 
growth. A more efficient public sector would reduce unnecessary fiscal costs and support private 
sector development. Improved quality of public services would positively affect the well-being 
of the poor and vulnerable. The poor would also benefit from less fragmented, better designed 
social assistance systems. Moreover, social vulnerability would be reduced with stronger 
education systems with higher quality and able to equip the population with the necessary skills 
to enter the job market effectively. Finally, better capacity to manage natural disasters would 
lead to significant reduction in human and economic losses. 

Competitiveness 

57. 
The RPS includes activities aimed at increasing private participation in the economy 
through a more effective business environment and increased competitiveness in leading 
industries. In this regard, the WBG plans to implement both “horizontal” and “vertical” 
interventions. Horizontal actions refer to economy wide reforms aimed at enhancing the overall 
enabling environment for businesses across sectors (e.g., interventions to enhance access to 
finance, improve the investment climate, encourage adoption of ICT, support innovation, and 
decrease the cost of electricity). Vertical actions aim at unleashing the competitiveness potential 
of leading sectors of the economy, particularly tourism and agriculture. 

30 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Outcome 1: Improved investment climate  
58. 
A better investment climate will improve conditions for private investment, FDI, 
SMEs, and higher productivity. Removing weaknesses in the investment climate should have a 
positive impact on firms, including on their ability to invest and grow. SMEs, which typically 
suffer more from investment climate barriers, stand to gain significantly, and, as they are the 
main generators of employment in the OECS, their benefiting from reforms of the investment 
climate should have a positive impact on employment. A better investment climate is also a 
requisite to reverse the trend of decreasing FDI. Finally, constraints in the investment climate 
increase the costs of doing business, so that their removal will contribute to increasing 
productivity in key sectors. 
59. 
The WBG will continue to support efforts to remove key weaknesses in the 
investment climate, with a specific focus on areas where the OECS countries rank low relative 
to countries at a similar level of per capita income or in the region, and are thus handicapped to 
compete regionally and globally, such as for getting credit, registering property, enforcing 
contracts, resolving insolvency, paying taxes, and improving logistics 48. Country-specific action 
plans stemming from the CGF process will provide the basis for identifying needed reforms. The 
WBG, working in coordination with the OECS Business Council, will support implementation of 
these action plans. 
60. 
A strengthened banking system is necessary to support the development of the 
private sector. Given the dominance of bank credit and the lack of other instruments to finance 
productive activities, the curb on lending resulting from bank balance sheet weaknesses has left 
firms and individuals with limited financial resources to leverage internal funds for investment, 
in turn limiting growth of the private sector and the creation of jobs. A well-functioning and 
diversified financial sector is also necessary to maintain economic stability; efficiently mobilize 
domestic and external savings; and ensure the efficient allocation of capital to productive 
investments, housing, and infrastructure, thereby supporting growth of the private sector and the 
economy49.  
61. 
The WBG will support the development and implementation of a comprehensive 
strategy to support the financial system. A comprehensive approach to strengthening the 
banking sector and developing the financial sector is essential, given the OECS’s commitment to 
a single financial space and the opportunity to generate economies of scale in a fragmented 
market. The Bank will support the ECCB in developing a comprehensive financial sector 
strategy aimed at strengthening the health of the banking sector and its ability to support the 
development of the private sector and economic growth, while ensuring macro sustainability. An 
operation to support the financial sector strengthening could materialize in the context of 
adequate progress on developing a comprehensive OECS financial sector strategy - in 
collaboration with the IMF, the ECCB and the CDB - and under a suitable policy and regulatory 

48 Ongoing WBG advisory support for selected investment climate reforms include (i) facilitate business entry of 
firms in Dominica and St Lucia; (ii) facilitate application process for construction permits in Dominica; (iii) 
establish framework for the operation of a collateral registry in St Lucia; (iv) automate the clearance of imports and 
build capacity of border agencies in Dominica, Grenada, St Lucia, St Kitts and Nevis; (v) support the establishment 
of a commercial chamber/commercial court in St Lucia; (vi) provide support to  simplify tax administration in 
Antigua and Barbuda; and (vii) improve the framework for resolving insolvency in Dominica and St Lucia.

environment. The IFC will seek to support development of the financial sector where private 
sector investment may be mobilized. 
62. 
To enhance productivity, competitiveness, and employment, the RPS will also 
support greater adoption of ICT, innovation, and growth of creative industries. The RPS 
program will support increased access to regional broadband networks and the development of 
an ICT-enabled services industry in the OECS. Thus, the Bank will continue implementing the 
Caribbean Regional Communication Infrastructure Project (CARCIP),  endeavoring to extend it 
to other OECS countries. 50 In collaboration with InfoDev (through the Entrepreneurship Program 
for Innovation in the Caribbean, or EPIC), 51 the WBG will help foster entrepreneurship through 
the development of a dynamic innovation and entrepreneurship ecosystem, including supportive 
public policies, public and privately funded incubators, training, and exchange of knowledge. 
Building on the successful experience of Digital Jam 3.0 “Caribbean edition” in Jamaica, where 
OECS countries were invited to participate, the WBG, in collaboration with various development 
partners, will support the development of creative industries (e.g., animation industry). This 
work will help increase youth employability and entrepreneurship, and create opportunities for 
jobs, especially for young women and men, in the virtual global economy and in creative sectors. 
63. 
Finally, the RPS will support activities aimed at contributing to more predictable 
and lower energy prices to enhance competitiveness and inclusion. The Bank will support 
enhanced efficiency in the supply of and demand for electricity.  It will also support diversifying 
the energy supply away from fossil fuels, realizing, however, that significant impact will require 
work extending beyond the RPS period. Therefore the objective during the RPS is to set the 
groundwork and, when ready, to commence work in this area, beginning with the preparation of 
geothermal development roadmaps in OECS countries, including Dominica and St. Lucia. To do 
this, the WBG will mobilize technical assistance resources (e.g., from the Energy Sector 
Management Assistance Program ESMAP, SIDS DOCK, the Global Environment Facility GEF), 
in coordination with other development partners. In addition, the Bank will continue 
implementing the Eastern Caribbean Energy Regulatory Authority Project (ECERA) to develop 
a strengthened energy regulatory environment, and will endeavor to extend it to other OECS 
countries 52. 
Outcome 2: Increased  tourism benefits with stronger linkages to agribusiness 
64. 
Revitalizing 
the 
tourism sector and establishing stronger 
linkages with 
agribusinesses will contribute to resumption in employment and growth in the OECS. 
Resumed growth in tourism, the main economic driver in the OECS, is expected to have a 
spillover effect on other sectors (e.g., agriculture) in terms of economic growth and job creation. 
This would be particularly the case with growth of tourism segments that have strong linkages to 
local culture, are associated with the highest labor intensity, and are highly inclusive of women, 

50 CARCIP Phase 1 was approved in May 2012 with Grenada (US$10m IDA), St. Lucia (US$6m IDA) and St. 
Vincent and the Grenadines (US$6m IDA). At the end of 2013, Antigua and Barbuda expressed its intention to join 
CARCIP. However, a new Government is in place after the June 2014 elections and the interest has to be confirmed.   
51 The EPIC program is a 7-year program funded by the Canadian Department of Foreign Affairs, Trade, and 
Development (DFATD) and implemented by the WBG, with three components: (i) support to and expansion of the 
Caribbean network of business enablers (including women entrepreneurs); (ii) skills upgrading and capacity 
development; and (iii) innovative access to finance program for entrepreneurs.  
52 Grenada and St. Lucia are the only OECS countries that are currently part of ECERA, which is implemented by 
the OECS Commission. 

32 

                                                      
youth, and marginalized social groups. Stronger links between tourism and agriculture will 
benefit small holders and those living in rural areas, who are among the poorest segments of the 
population. In addition, the development of agriculture will contribute to reducing food imports 
and improving the current account balance. 
65. 
The WBG will support a comprehensive set of measures to enhance the 
competiveness of tourism and create stronger linkages with agribusinesses. The Bank will 
support the removal of obstacles to the sector’s development, including those related to policies, 
regulation, infrastructure, and logistics. It will also foster linkages between the two sectors, so 
that the tourism industry increasingly provides a market for small agribusinesses. This will be 
achieved in part by strengthening selected value chains. Emphasis will be placed on developing 
productive alliances in rural areas and enhancing the quality and standards infrastructure. 
Capacity development of female entrepreneurs and insertion of female-led enterprises in these 
alliances will be supported. Attention will be given to increasing the availability of productivity-
enhancing technologies (e.g., seeds, weather insurance, improved farming practices, training) for 
agriculture. Productive alliances will not only link producer organizations to national markets 
(including tourism), but will also link and strengthen productive alliances with exporters and 
importers overseas for products where the OECS countries have comparative advantages, such as 
nutmeg and other spices, quality cocoa or some tropical fruits. Investments could be supported in 
cold chains and food safety systems. Air and maritime connectivity issues, which limit both 
tourism and agriculture, may also be addressed (including the feasibility of a ferry system), 
depending on economic feasibility, the availability of additional donor funding, and political 
appetite. In addition, through an ongoing operation, 53 the WBG will continue supporting better 
management of marine resources in the OECS, which will also help to boost tourism, although 
recognizing that long-term efforts will be needed in this area, given the degree of degradation of 
marine and coastal resources. Measures supporting the promotion of a sustainable ocean-based 
(blue) economy in the OECS could also lead to positive spillovers. 

Public Sector Modernization 

66. 
The WBG will support more effective and transparent public administrations, more 
robust institutional capacity and stronger frameworks for partnership with the private 
sector. The RPS will concentrate efforts in three areas: (i) assisting OECS governments to build 
more efficient and accountable public administrations, focusing on the processes and systems 
that will enhance the efficiency of the public administration and enable the fiscal gains that are 
needed to enhance the sustainability of public finances; (ii) strengthening statistical capacity to 
inform policymaking, and (iii) strengthening the framework for PPPs to enable OECS 
governments to partner with the private sector to meet critical infrastructure investment needs. 
The Bank will also continue to build institutional capacity in the public sector by incorporating 
institutional capacity-building components in lending operations, and the Bank will explore the 
possibility to support the adoption of harmonized Procurement Acts and developing supporting 
regulations and institutional processes in the OECS. 

53 The Sustainable Financing and Management of Eastern Caribbean Marine Ecosystem Project established the 
Caribbean Biodiversity Fund, with a current capitalized endowment of approximately US$15 million from 
GEF/World Bank, the German Development Bank, and the Nature Conservancy.  

33 

 
 
                                                      
Outcome 3: Improved budget management and transparency  
67. With significant fiscal imbalances impeding government’s ability to allocate 
resources to needed investments and programs, establishing the basis for sound fiscal 
management is essential in the OECS. Introducing strategic budgeting tools, such as rolling 
forward budget estimates and multiannual budget ceilings, is critical to lay the foundations for 
better fiscal management, as these tools will contribute to inform decision on additional spending 
request and savings options. In the long term, more efficient public administrations and increased 
institutional capacity will help free up resources to deliver better services and strengthen macro 
sustainability. 
68. 
The WBG will support selected country efforts to enhance the processes and systems 
that contribute to better budget processes and greater transparency. It is expected that 
Antigua and Barbuda, St. Kitts and Nevis, and Grenada will, with support from the Bank, 
gradually introduce program budgeting and make available to the public information on planning 
and budget outruns 54. In these three countries, the Bank will also support the creation of an Open 
Budget Index through the implementation of the Open Data Initiative. These efforts will be 
complemented by assistance provided under the Supporting Economic Management in the 
Caribbean (SEMCAR) 55 program and the Caribbean Regional Technical Assistance Center 
(CARTAC), 56 in close coordination with the EU and the IMF. The Bank will also continue 
working with the Supreme Audit Institutions and Public Accounts Committees of Parliaments in 
the OECS areas as well as on accounting and auditing standards. Finally, the Bank will support 
greater accountability by leveraging the opportunity provided by the CGF process and the Global 
Partnership for Social Accountability (GPSA) for the five OECS countries that have joined the 
program 57. 
Outcome 4: Strengthened statistical capacity 
69. 
Solid statistics are critical to inform policy decision making and monitor the impact 
of policy decisions. Priority will be given to social and poverty statistics that allow timely 
poverty and inclusion assessments and the assessment of the impacts of policy measures on 
poverty and shared prosperity. In coordination with other partners, the WBG will support, 
through no lending activities, the production of harmonized household surveys and capacity 
building in key national and regional institutions (e.g., national statistical offices, OECS 
Commission, Living Standards Measurement Committee) 58. A plan to strengthen OECS statistics 

54 This will be achieved through the ongoing A&B Public and Social Sector Transformation Project; through an 
ongoing Institutional Development Fund (IDF) grant in St. Kitts and Nevis; and through the development of a policy 
loan series in Grenada. 
55 The SEMCAR Program, initiated with funding from DFATD, is managed by the World Bank and implemented in 
partnership with the IMF. Its strategic objective is to improve economic management, regional integration, and 
competitiveness in 12 Caribbean countries by contributing to more efficient, effective, accountable and regionally 
integrated tax, customs, and PFM institutions, policies, processes, and ICT systems. Also, it includes a component 
that aims to better understand and address gender-differentiated constraints to voluntary tax compliance.  
56 CARTAC’s mission is to enhance the institutional and human capacities of countries in the Caribbean region to 
achieve their macroeconomic, fiscal, and monetary policy objectives. It provides technical services in four core 
areas: public expenditure management, tax/customs policy and administration, financial sector regulation and 
supervision, and economic and financial statistics. 
57 Antigua and Barbuda, Grenada, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines. 
58 This work will also be crucial to respond to one of the key constraints for improved gender mainstreaming as it 
will provide sex-disaggregated statistical information.  

34 

                                                      
and poverty work will be rolled out and implemented during the first two years of the RPS, and 
more up-to-date information on poverty and shared prosperity will be presented in the first 
Performance and Learning Review (PLR). 
Outcome 5: Strengthened capacity to manage PPPs  
70. 
Appropriate structuring of PPPs can help project implementation, contributing to 
increasing resilience and competitiveness. To improve service delivery and free up much-
needed public resources for other initiatives, in the long term, OECS governments need to 
partner with the private sector in building infrastructure, managing state assets, or carrying out 
innovative investment projects. Thus, the WBG will support, through non lending activities and 
trust funds, the development of a stronger institutional, legal, and regulatory framework, at 
national and regional levels, for the development and implementation of PPPs. This will be 
achieved by supporting OECS governments in implementing the actions identified in the 
Caribbean PPP Infrastructure Roadmap that has been prepared with joint support from the Bank 
and other development partners 59. In coordination with the IFC, the WBG will also support the 
preparation of selected PPP transactions. Greater development of PPPs could lead the IFC to 
play a greater role in the OECS.  

Resilience 

71. 
The RPS aims at supporting OECS governments and households to better manage 
the impact of shocks and adapt to changing circumstances. Through a combined focus on 
strengthening social protection systems and improving the quality of education and health 
systems, the RPS aims to support holistic human capital development among the poor and 
vulnerable. In addition, the Bank will endeavor to incorporate a youth dimension in this 
assistance, anchored on a youth survey covering all human development areas (i.e., health, 
education, employment, civic engagement, and providing sex-disaggregated data). In parallel, 
the Bank aims to continue building the capacity of OECS governments to effectively manage 
natural disaster risks, focusing on shifting attention toward prevention and building resilience. 
Proper management of these risks would lower the human and economic costs of disasters. It 
would also have benefits in terms of reducing fiscal pressures and enhancing the quality of the 
environment, thus contributing to growth and employment. 
Outcome 6: Improved targeting and reduced fragmentation of social protection systems 
72. 
Enhanced effectiveness of social protection systems will strengthen the resilience of 
the population, especially vulnerable groups, to shocks. Social protection systems directly 
address extreme poverty, but they also address intergenerational poverty by helping families 
invest in themselves, their children, and their assets. The priority will be on reducing high levels 
of fragmentation and duplication, spending inefficiencies, capacity deficiencies, targeting 
inadequacies, and limited abilities to respond to exogenous shocks. The reforms would improve 
the responsiveness of social protection systems, particularly in times of economic and 
environmental shocks. The ongoing Safety Net Advancement Project will continue to be 
implemented in Grenada. The planned Regional Social Resilience and Human Development 

59 The Caribbean PPP Infrastructure Roadmap identifies a number of relevant actions, both at the country and 
regional level, to capitalize on the PPP potential in the OECS, such as: identify a “PPP focal point” at the national 
level; training for government staff at all levels; developing priority PPP projects and pipelines; exploring the 
creation of a regional PPP support mechanism, etc.. 

35 

                                                      
operation will address social protection challenges in other OECS countries, depending on their 
demand. Complementary work on health systems will depend on country demand and is likely to 
focus on addressing the threat of NCDs. 
Outcome 7: Establishment of quality education standards 
73. 
Improving education standards and the skills of the labor force is essential to 
enhance employability. Inadequate skillsets are among the biggest obstacles identified by 
businesses operating in the OECS. Improving the education and skill set of OECS populations is 
thus essential to enhance the employability of the labor force and contribute to reduced 
unemployment and poverty. Enhanced vocational training will also be useful as individuals who 
take employer-provided or vocational training earn, on average, at least 5 percent higher real 
earnings than those who have not taken such training. The returns are closer to 5-10 percent if, as 
a result of the training, the individual obtains a middle or higher vocational qualification. 60 
Specific attention will be given to skills training that promote women’s labor force participation. 
74. 
The RPS aims to focus on improving the quality of education standards. The priority 
in education is to implement the OECS Education Sector Strategy, which targets significant 
improvements in educational outcomes. With support from the Global Education Partnership 
(GEP), the Bank will focus its support on the establishment of quality standards and 
improvement in teaching. The RPS will also support better technical and vocational education 
and training to optimize human capital. 
Outcome 8: Enhanced data to support evidence-based health policy to address NCDs 
75. 
Despite significant progress in improving their population's health in the past two 
decades, OECS countries face the challenges of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) which 
represent the major causes of death in the region. NCDs also account for a growing portion of 
health spending, imposing a large economic burden. The OECS capacity to address NCDs is 
compromised by i) the shortage of Human Resources for Health (HRH), particularly nurses, 
which limits the ability to meet key health service needs, ii) lack of effective information on 
NCDs, and iii) inadequate financing in the health sector. 
Better information on NCDs would enable better evidence-based policies and 
76. 
decisions. The RPS will focus on developing a regional mechanism to systematically capture 
timely data on NCDs to assess results, resource gaps, and define policies and improve programs 
based on evidence. 
Outcome 9: Increased capacity to manage natural hazards 

77. 
The RPS will help OECS countries better manage natural disasters with greater 
focus on ex-ante risk reduction, planning, and financing, and enhanced rapid emergency 
response capacity. Such an effort could significantly contribute to reducing the impacts of 
natural disasters, especially for the most vulnerable segments of the population, who often live in 
fragile houses and in remote areas prone to disaster impacts. Physical damages to housing, 
schools, and health centers interfere directly and indirectly with the provision of education, 
health, and social services, and therefore greater resilience has a strong positive social impact. 
The approach would also help reduce the fiscal impact of natural disasters, as risks would be

for Fiscal Studies, ISBN 1-873357-56-7..

increasingly transferred to the market, and as enhanced resilience would attract more investments 
into OECS countries. 
78. 
To this end, the RPS will aim to continue building greater resilience and enhanced 
disaster risk management capacity. In coordination with other donors, and capitalizing on 
available trust funds and grants, the WBG will continue helping OECS countries increase their 
resilience to natural hazards and climate change impacts, through a combination of resilience 
investments and resilience-building policy advice and capacity building. Specific emphasis will 
be put on understanding and addressing gender-differentiated vulnerabilities and impacts, based 
on women’s and men’s different roles and responsibilities 
in 
their households and 
communities 61. The Bank will also support OECS governments in assessing contingent liabilities 
associated with natural disasters, thus setting the basis for undertaking appropriate precautionary 
measures. In addition, fiscal risk assessments will inform OECS countries in the development of 
National Disaster Risk Financing and Insurance strategies and associated action plans, enabling 
them to make informed decisions about efficiently transferring more disaster risk to private 
capital markets. This will be achieved by continuing the implementation of a large portfolio of 
disaster risk management activities (i.e., four large operations that are active in Dominica, 
Grenada, St. Lucia, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and a related additional financing 
operation for Grenada planned for FY15). The WBG will complement these efforts with 
activities to strengthen governments’ capacity to address individuals’, households’, and 
communities’ vulnerability to disasters and strengthen their resilience, including through 
transfers and social services to affected individuals, households, and communities. 

4. FINANCIAL PORTFOLIO AND EXPOSURE MANAGEMENT 

79. 
Indicative IBRD envelope. The indicative IBRD lending program for the six OECS 
countries is expected to be around US$120 million, comprising up to a maximum of US$20 
million for each OECS country for the period of the RPS (FY15-19), subject to country and 
program performance, IBRD’s lending capacity, and exposure management parameters.  

80. 
IDA-17 Resources. In addition to the IBRD envelope, four OECS countries (Dominica, 
Grenada, St. Lucia, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines) can also count on an IDA national 
allocation and can leverage additional regional IDA resources, consistent with the IDA regional 
allocation criteria 62 . The IDA17 (FY15-17) indicative allocation for the OECS is equal to 
SDR61.3 million, an increase of around 22 percent over the IDA16 OECS allocation (SDR50.3 
million) 63 (Table 8). 

61 In the St Lucia disaster vulnerability resilience project (DRVP), specific focus is given on understanding how 
policies may affect women and men differently and on constructing a sex-disaggregated baseline for the project, 
taking into account gender differentiated needs and preferences. This work is informing the government on relevant 
gender aspects to programming on climate change, and will provide useful lessons learned for the rest of the region 
as well. 
62 The level of IDA regional allocation to be leveraged would depend on project design. 
63 However, IDA allocations are determined on a yearly basis. The final allocation for each FY during the IDA17 
replenishment period will depend on:  (i) the total IDA resources available; (ii) the country’s performance rating, per 
capita GNI, and population; (iii) the terms of IDA assistance (grants/credits); (iv) the allocation deductions 
associated with MDRI annual debt service foregone as applicable; (v) the performance, other allocation parameters, 
and IDA assistance terms for other IDA borrowers; and (vi) the number of IDA-eligible countries.

81. 
Leveraging additional resources will be essential to achieve the RPS objectives. With 
adequate conditions in place, support to strengthen the financial sector could require significant 
IBRD and/or IDA resources, thus leaving limited resources towards the other areas of 
engagement proposed in this RPS. Leveraging additional resources will thus be essential, 
including supporting the proposed engagements in human development, natural disaster risk 
management, and energy. 
82. 
Three new regional operations will be implemented under the RPS. In order to 
provide selective support in areas likely to have the strongest impact on poverty reduction and 
shared prosperity, three operations are planned under this RPS: a Competitiveness project, a 
Renewable Energy project, and a Social Resilience and Human Development project. A fourth 
operation to support the financial sector strengthening could also materialize in the context of 
adequate progress on developing a comprehensive financial sector strategy - in collaboration 
with the IMF, the ECCB and the CDB - and under a suitable policy and regulatory environment.  
83. 
In addition, implementation of the following ongoing investment operations will 
continue: i) two regional projects in the areas of Private Sector Development and 
Competitiveness (i.e., the Caribbean Regional Infrastructure Communication Project (CARCIP), 
and the Eastern Caribbean Energy Regulatory Authority (ECERA) project); ii) in the area of 
Public Sector Modernization, a Public Sector and Social Transformation project in Antigua and 
Barbuda; and iii) in the area of Social and Climate Resilience, a Safety Net Advancement project 
in Grenada; and a large portfolio of Disaster Risk Management projects (i.e., four regional 
operations in Dominica, Grenada, St. Lucia, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines, one emergency 
operation to respond to the effects of the Hurricane Tomas in St. Lucia, and a Sustainable 
Financing and Management of Eastern Caribbean Marine Ecosystem Project). In addition, an 
ongoing series of development policy operations in Grenada, anchored on the CDF, is expected 
to have a cross-cutting impact on the three engagement areas (Table 9).

84. 
The existing portfolio for the OECS (as of June 2014) consists of six IDA, one IBRD, 
and one GEF project, totaling net commitments of US$134.1 million, of which 18 percent is 
undisbursed. The number of projects under implementation has gone down from 15 to 7 over 
the period FY10-FY14, showing increased selectivity. However, net commitments have 
increased over the years; and the average project size has increased from US$6.1 million in 2010 
to US$19.2 million today. The disbursement ratio remains relatively low however, resulting in 
longer implementation periods. In addition, the Bank is implementing 28 trust funds worth $31.8 
million in the region, to support the implementation of projects and provide technical assistance. 
The Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) has evaluated six of eight recently closed projects, 
with 100 percent satisfactory ratings (Table 10). In addition to close supervision, which promotes 
an early response to implementation problems, the Bank will continue working to strengthen 
government capacity for project implementation, including by providing annual fiduciary and 
procurement training.

The lending program under this RPS may be substantially reviewed at the time of 
the first PLR. Strengthening the OECS financial sector is critical to ensure macro-financial 
stability and establish the appropriate engine to support private sector growth. The WBG, in 
close partnership with the IMF and CDB, will work closely with the OECS governments and the 
ECCB toward suitable approaches that would support strengthening key elements of the financial 
sector. However, the decision to proceed with financial support will depend on the progress 
achieved by the ECCB and the OECS governments in taking the necessary measures to create 
the conditions for such support to be effective, including the appropriate legislative and 
regulatory environment. In view of the ongoing dialogue on the nature and form of such support, 
it is suggested that the lending program be reviewed at the time of the first PLR of this RPS. In 
addition, flexibility in resource allocation, and leveraging additional funding, will be required 
throughout the period, because of the high vulnerability and needs of OECS countries. 
86. 
IFC’s existing activity in the OECS focus on: i) crisis response; ii) job creation and 
inclusive growth; iii) innovation, competitiveness and integration; and iv) climate change. 
During FY09-FY14, IFC committed six projects for $165.6 million in the OECS, including 
Sagicor Insurance (FY11), a $100 million regional commitment in insurance that had over $1.1 
billion in annual premiums in 2012 and is active in every OECS country. In Advisory Services, 
IFC has exposure in every member state of the OECS with a current portfolio of $14 million 
focusing on Investment Climate (Tourism Investment Generation, St. Lucia) and PPPs 
(Hewanorra International Airport, St. Lucia, and St. Joseph’s hospital, Grenada). In addition, IFC 

39 

 
has OECS exposure in a number of regional projects: Risk Management & Corporate 
Governance, Caribbean Regional Credit Bureau and SME Banking, Business Entry, Tax Reform, 
Indicator-Based Reform Advisory, Trade Logistics, and Investment Climate. Overall, IFC was 
more successful through its Advisory Services. Investment opportunities proved to be limited, 
mainly because of small market size. In addition, engagements through the financial sector were 
constrained because of the increasingly difficult financial situation of most commercial banks in 
the region. 
87. 
Looking ahead, IFC aims to expand its investment activities in the region. Over the 
next strategy cycle, IFC Advisory Services and the newly established Global Practices of the 
WBG are expected to remain a critical component of IFC’s engagement. On the investment side, 
IFC expects to build on close relations with the World Bank through this strategy, which is more 
focused on growth industries and targeted regional initiatives, to jointly develop more sizable 
private sector investment opportunities in the financial sector as well as in infrastructure through 
strengthened PPP frameworks. This should help IFC to expand its investment support, especially 
in the areas of tourism, agribusiness, banking and financial inclusion, education, renewable 
energy/energy efficiency, and other infrastructure areas. MIGA will continue observing potential 
opportunities in the market. 

5. MANAGING RISKS 

88. 
The risks of not achieving the development objectives of the proposed program 
under this RPS are high. They include (i) a fragile macro framework and potential social 
tension; (ii) potential lack of government actions to address financial sector weaknesses; (iii) 
exposure to exogenous shocks and natural disasters; and (iv) complex political economy, weak 
regional cooperation and low institutional capacity. 
89. 
The macro situation is fragile, particularly because of high debt, fiscal imbalances, 
and exposure to external shocks. A drop in CBI revenues, changes in sources of oil financing, 
or an external shock could all affect the fiscal sustainability of the OECS and create negative 
spillovers on growth, poverty, and shared prosperity. In addition, despite a relatively secure and 
stable environment in the OECS, an increasing level of youth unemployment could give rise to 
social tensions. A sound macroeconomic framework and governments’ commitment to 
implement structural and social reforms are critical and, if needed, the Bank’s support might be 
strengthened to support these reforms. The WBG will closely monitor the macro framework 
through systematic dialogue with the OECS governments around the CDF. In addition, close 
coordination with the IMF will be maintained including around areas for strengthening fiscal 
management through better management of public finances. The RPS also contemplates 
enhancing social safety nets to mitigate the risk of social tensions. The Bank will also support 
measures to improve the investment climate and labor employability, and thereby set the 
foundations for greater employment and growth.  
90. Given the level of uncertainty on financial sector issues, flexibility in the 
implementation of the RPS will be essential. In particular, in case of sufficient progress on 
developing a comprehensive financial sector strategy and on building a suitable policy and 
regulatory environment to address vulnerabilities in the financial sector, an operation to support 
the financial sector will take place and the Bank might limit its engagement in the other results 
areas envisaged by this RPS, unless it is able to leverage additional resources to achieve the other

objectives. In case of lack of progress on these issues, the Bank would refocus the program 
toward building resilience; especially establishing stronger safety nets to mitigate the impact of 
enhance vulnerability on the poor and vulnerable. Preserving appropriate flexibility in focus 
areas, results, and the allocation of resources is, therefore, an integral feature of this RPS. 
91. 
Exposure to natural shocks continues to be a major threat for OECS countries, 
which are still not sufficiently socially and structurally resilient to disasters. Infrastructure 
repair negatively affects fiscal balances, declines in tourist arrivals reduce GDP growth and 
widen current account deficits, and the human toll of natural disasters remains very high. The 
WBG plans to mitigate this risk by making sure that the large portfolio of disaster risk 
management operations will continue to produce results and is reoriented from a culture of 
“reaction” to “prevention.” The Bank will also strengthen the social dimensions of these 
operations. 
92. 
Lack of actions at the political level, including within the regional context, could 
slow down implementation of projects and reforms, especially considering the weak 
institutional capacity. Despite public commitment, it is possible, particularly in periods close to 
political elections, that appropriate actions may not be taken in a timely manner to speed up 
implementation of projects and reform. Political will is particularly important for effective 
regional integration and economies of scale, which are critical for the realization of this program, 
including ensuring a greater role for IFC. In addition, lack of well-trained human resources, 
obsolete systems of government personnel management, insufficiently robust accountability 
system for results, a weak enforcement culture to implement decisions, and scarce financial 
resources make it difficult for governments to achieve results effectively and on time when 
implementing projects. To mitigate this risk, the OECS governments have committed to 
implement a program of reforms focused on fiscal sustainability and macro stability, which have 
been expressed in their national and regional strategies 64 , while the WBG will maintain a 
systematic dialogue with the authorities and other partners to better understand the political 
economy context in each country and will take care to design operations that, while regional, will 
give clients a strong sense of ownership by also addressing country-specific needs. Moreover, 
the WBG will provide technical assistance and training initiatives, embedded in the operations 
when feasible, to contribute to increased institutional capacity.

Annex II. Country Growth Outlook and Selected Economic Indicators 

Country Growth Outlook 

Antigua and Barbuda, St. Kitts and Nevis, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines show the most 
favorable growth prospects. In Antigua and Barbuda and St. Kitts and Nevis, growth prospects 
are improving as a number of construction projects are already on the pipeline, and tourism and 
construction activity continue to recover. The IMF projections indicate that real GDP growth is 
projected to reach 3 to 3.5 percent over the medium-term as a result of the positive results shown 
by their CBI program. In St. Vincent and the Grenadines, growth is expected to improve with the 
renovation of the international airport over the next 16-18 months, which could boost tourism-
related activity. The recent opening of two medical universities is also expected to contribute to 
growth. In Dominica, growth is projected to pick up to its potential rate of close to 2 percent with 
a rebound of the economy’s major growth drivers – agriculture and tourism, combined with a 
negative impact from a demographic change (aging and population decline). Grenada is expected 
to recover steadily over the medium-term to about 2.5 percent with a continued recovery in the 
tourism and private investment. Finally, in St. Lucia, medium-term growth is expected to rise 
gradually to its potential rate of 2.3 percent, supported mainly by a rebound in agriculture, which 
will indirectly boost related manufacturing activity and stronger tourism arrivals, but stronger 
growth will be held back by a weak banking system

Annex III. Political Context and Progress in the Integration Process   

Although there have been some changes in the political landscape, the political 
environment in the OECS remains stable. In Antigua and Barbuda, elections were held in June 
2014, and Hon. Gaston Browne, of the Antigua & Barbuda Labor Party, won 14 of the 17 seats 
in the Parliament. This is a relevant political shift after 10 years of leadership by the United 
Progressive Party, led by Baldwin Spencer. In Dominica, the Hon. Roosevelt Skerrit has been 
Prime Minister since 2004; the last elections were held in 2009, and new ones are expected at the 
end of 2014. In Grenada, where the most recent elections were held (February 2013) and the next 
are expected in 2018, the Right Hon. Dr. Keith Mitchell returned as Prime Minister, winning all 
15 parliamentary seats; he had previously served as Prime Minister from 1995 to 2008. In St. 
Kitts and Nevis, the Hon. Dr. Denzil Douglas is serving his fourth term in office as Prime 
Minister, following his success at the general election in January 2010; the next elections are 
expected in 2015. In Saint Lucia, the Hon. Dr. Kenny Anthony, who served as Prime Minister 
from 1997 to 2006, resumed that post in 2011; the next elections are expected in 2016. In St. 
Vincent and the Grenadines, the Hon. Dr. Ralph Gonsalves is in his third term of office as Prime 
Minister, a position he has held since March 2001; the last elections were held in 2010 and the 
next ones are expected in 2015.   
A revised Treaty of Basseterre to establish the OECS Economic Union was ratified on June 
18, 2010. Before ratification, the provisions of the Economic Union Treaty were expected to 
include (i) free circulation of goods and trade in services within the OECS; (ii) free movement of 
labor; (iii) free movement of capital (through the ECCB’s program of support to the money and 
capital market); (iv) a regional Assembly of Parliamentarians; and (v) a common external tariff. 
Within the Single Financial and Economic Space, goods, people, and capital would move freely; 
member states are expected to harmonize monetary and fiscal policies and to take a common 
approach to trade, health, education and environment, as well as to the development of such 
critical sectors as agriculture, tourism, and energy.  
A joint declaration by political leaders gave assurances that the OECS Economic Union 
would not run counter to CARICOM integration but would be seamlessly integrated into 
the CARICOM Single Market Economy (CSME). 1 The OECS Heads of Government agreed 
that steps should be taken to ensure that the OECS Economic Union Treaty would be recognized 
under the Revised Treaty of Chaguaramas (establishing the CARICOM), just as the original 
Treaty of Chaguaramas had recognized the Treaty of Basseterre. At the Twenty-Fourth Inter-
Sessional Meeting of the Conference of Heads of Government of CARICOM (held in Port-au-
Prince, Haiti, in February 2013), CARICOM leaders adopted the Revised Treaty of Basseterre 
into CARICOM’s Revised Treaty of Chaguaramas, effectively giving CARICOM member states 

1 The CSME is an integrated development strategy envisioned at the 10th Meeting of the Conference of Heads of 
Government of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), which took place in July 1989 in Grand Anse, Grenada. 
The Grand Anse Declaration had three key features: (i) deepening economic integration by advancing beyond a 
common market toward a Single Market Economy; (ii) widening the membership and thereby expanding the 
economic mass of the Caribbean Community (e.g., Suriname and Haiti were admitted as full members in 1995 and 
2002, respectively); and (iii) inserting of the region into the global trading and economic system by strengthening 
trading links with nontraditional partners. A precursor to CARICOM and its CSME was the Caribbean Free Trade 
Agreement, formed in 1965 and dissolved in 1973.

the opportunity of integrating initially with the OECS and taking a seemingly quicker path to 
integration. To achieve this, the Conference agreed that an Inter-Governmental Task Force 
revising the Treaty of Chaguaramas would recognize the provisions of the Treaty establishing 
the Economic Union of the OECS.   
Despite notable progress toward integration, several factors have posed significant 
drawbacks: weak commitment at the national level, political economy issues, and 
inadequate resources to drive implementation at the national and regional levels. The 
Economic Union Treaty created new organs for governing the OECS. 2 Among those, the OECS 
Assembly (consisting of members of Parliaments) was inaugurated in August 2012.  In 2008, the 
61st Meeting of the Monetary Council of the ECCU approved the establishment of an “OECS 
Distribution and Transportation Company” to address the deficiencies in inter-island trade by 
forging greater distributional links throughout the islands and providing fast and reliable 
transportation services for goods. In 2009, the OECS Commission conducted an independent 
review of the existing “Policy Framework and Strategic Plan for Agriculture.” In 2011, the 
OECS Council of Tourism Ministers approved the “OECS Common Tourism Policy.”  An 
“OECS Education Sector Strategy” was launched in October 2013. The OECS Commission 
drafted an “OECS Growth and Development Strategy,” which the OECS Assembly was 
expected to endorse by 2013. However, despite all this progress toward integration and the sense 
of urgency to proceed on this path, it seems that political economy considerations—such as the 
alignment of internal decisions with the countries’ political cycles—and the lack of sufficient 
resources to drive implementation at both the national and regional levels have slowed progress 
and created considerable obstacles to an effective integration process. 

2 The organs are (i) the Authority of Heads of Government of the Member States; (ii) the Council of Ministers; 
(iii) the OECS Assembly; (iv) the Economic Affairs Council; and (v) the OECS Commission.

Annex IV. Partnerships and Areas of Donor Supporting the OECS   

The World Bank’s role in the OECS aid architecture is built on its capacity to convene regional and international partnerships for 
addressing the critical challenges the OECS faces. The regional aid architecture consists of a large number of bilateral and multilateral 
agencies that provide development assistance to the OECS in a wide range of sectors and thematic areas that are critical to the 
countries’ economic and social development. The WBG has worked closely with many of these development agencies and maintains 
long-standing and mutually supportive relationships with Caribbean institutions and agencies. The Bank will systematically coordinate 
with other development partners to monitor the implementation of development strategies and activities, and adjust the overall 
program as needed, on the basis of each partner’s comparative advantages. Systematic bilateral meetings have been, and will continue 
to be, held with such regional institutions as the OECS Commission and the ECCB. Quarterly donor meetings are organized by the 
UN Resident Coordinator in Barbados, with participation by such major donors as DFID, CIDA, EC, CDB, IMF, CARICOM, and 
other UN specialized agencies. Moreover, to improve coordination, frequent bilateral meetings will be held during international events 
(such as the WBG/IMF Annual and Spring Meetings) or on an ad hoc basis.

Annex V. Gender Note1   

OECS countries face multiple development challenges—not only in the macro-dimension of 
the countries’ structural weaknesses, but also at the household and individual levels. The micro-
level is characterized by a variety of inequalities, including inequalities based on gender, which 
often exacerbate the development challenges. In the subregion, gender identities rooted in shared 
social norms and cultural values expose men and women to specific gendered concerns that are 
described in this note. Understanding the gender dimension of the socioeconomic processes is 
crucial to adequately addressing the region’s gender-differentiated needs and concerns.  
A. Legal & Institutional Framework  
All countries have established gender divisions/departments under sectoral ministries. 
Some have developed gender action plans and national policies to promote gender equality—for 
example, Antigua’s National Plan of Action for Gender Affairs and Dominica’s National Policy 
and Action Plan on Gender Equality and Equity. They have also taken specific actions to 
mainstream gender among different government levels—for example, Dominica has established 
Gender Focal Points in some government departments; and in St. Vincent and the Grenadines, 
the Gender Affairs Division sits on several committee and task forces, such as the health, trade, 
and poverty alleviation committees.  
OECS countries are signatories to the most relevant international and regional treaties and 
mechanisms. They adopted the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action and ratified the 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), the 
Inter-American Convention on the Prevention, Punishment, and Eradication of Violence against 
Women, and the Convention on the Rights of the Child. 
OECS countries face challenges in complying with international agreements and 
provisions. Advances have been made in enacting laws to protect, support, and defend women’s 
rights, but some countries still lag in adapting the conventions into their legal system and in 
implementing them at the country level. 2 A number of OECS countries also have weaknesses in 
their enforcement mechanisms, especially with reference to domestic violence. In addition, 
because of human and technical constraints, not all of the OECS states are complying with treaty 
reporting obligations, such as those in CEDAW, and most states have not signed. 3  Public policy 
and allocation of funds related to gender issues and gender mainstreaming are underdeveloped, 
and there is a shortage of sex-disaggregated data in all of the OECS countries. 

B. Poverty  
Despite being categorized as having high human development, OECS countries experience 
a high poverty rate and financial debt and low economic growth. In the OECS countries 
poverty is higher in rural areas, where half of the population lives, and rural women are among

Team, December 2013, as an input to the RPS process.

3 Every four years, State parties to the CEDAW are requested to report on the implementation of the Convention at 
national level. According to the CEDAW’s website, none of the OECS countries has regularly complied with this 
requirement since their ratification of the Convention.

the most affected by poverty. 4 The combination of unpaid domestic work, lower income, and 
higher unemployment due to limited job opportunities in rural areas means that rural women are 
highly vulnerable to poverty. Additionally, their role as primary care-provider for their families 
further challenges their situation. 
The gender distribution of poverty in the subregion varies across countries. 5 Men and 
women are nearly equally represented among the poor in Dominica. In Grenada and Saint Lucia, 
however, more males than females are poor (52.2 percent and 57.5 percent, respectively). The 
situation is reversed in Antigua and Barbuda and in St. Kitts, where females make up 52.8 
percent and 52.5 percent, respectively, of the poor.  
Poverty appears also to be intergenerational among the OECS countries. Youth are 
disproportionately affected by poverty, and in several OECS countries they are at the greatest 
risk of falling into the poverty trap. Additionally, in the subregion, as in most of the Caribbean, 
there is growing concern about the situation of young males: because of limited education, high 
drop-out rate and a shortage of job opportunities, they are more likely to engage in risky 
behavior.    
In the OECS countries, single mothers are particularly vulnerable to poverty.  Although 
single parenthood is prevalent in the subregion, states seem to be falling behind in providing 
tailored support to the affected population. The OECS study on social safety nets in the Eastern 
Caribbean reports that states target less than 12 percent of expenditures to single parents; and in 
no country is single parenthood among the eligibility criteria for granting social safety nets. This 
situation is relevant for women, since in the subregion the majority of single parents are females, 
particularly in the lower income quintiles. Another concern related to single mothers is that their 
poverty may sometimes lead them to engage in transactional sex to earn fast cash. 6  
While poverty affects both women and men’s lives, they experience it differently. Cultural 
stereotypes, gender-based differences in social roles, and access to the formal labor market shape 
the way in which men and women, girls and boys are affected by poverty. USAID’s report on 
Gender in the OECS notes that being a poor woman in the Caribbean often means carrying the 
responsibility of a large extended family and being part of a community network of people who 
support each other. Women cope with poverty through such different strategies as cultivating 
fruits and vegetables for domestic use, relying on their neighbors’ support, and trying to have 
more than one occupation. To meet their caring and welfare responsibility toward their family, 
they also engage in survival sex mechanisms. On the other hand, being a poor man in the 
Caribbean means living alone, sometimes having multiple relationships and less contacts with 
family and possible children. Because of poverty and the large number of single parents and 
female-headed households, fathers often fail in financially supporting their children. Typically 
poor men also engage in male networks that can be either positive, such as networks for job 
seeking, or negative, such as criminal networks.

C. Education 
In the OECS countries boys and girls have equal access to education, but the majority of 
students are girls, and the higher the educational level, the wider the gender gap. The ratio 
of female to male enrolment is near parity at the primary level in almost all countries, 7 and boy-
girl primary completion rates vary. 8 Girls are slightly more likely than boys to be enrolled in 
secondary school (except in Antigua and Barbuda and St. Lucia), but in all countries with 
available data, girls are much more likely to enrol at the tertiary level.  
There is a strong gender aspect to the higher levels of education in the OECS. Not only do 
more young women than men enroll in tertiary education, but data shows that in 2010 girls 
accounted for 65 percent of the Caribbean Secondary Education Certificate examinations and 
Caribbean Advanced Proficiency Examinations. 9 Girls and boys tend to make different choices 
of studies and types of training: 10 at the tertiary level female students tend to choose subjects in 
humanities, whereas male students to a larger extent study science. 11  
D. Health 
OECS countries have made significant progress in the last decade in terms of reproductive 
health. The subregion is characterized by high percentages of prenatal care and of births 
attended by skilled staff, factors that likely have contributed to the low maternal mortality rates. 
In both Antigua and Barbuda and Grenada, maternal mortality ratio is three times lower than the 
average for upper-middle-income countries (24 versus 62 per 100,000 live births in 2010) and 
almost four times lower than the regional LAC average (80 per 100,000 live births). 12 St. Lucia 
has a maternal mortality rate of 35, and in St. Vincent and the Grenadines the rate is 48.   
Despite these encouraging health outcomes, teenage pregnancy is a major concern in the 
subregion, with serious consequences for the health of both mother and child. Across the 
Eastern Caribbean, a large share of women aged 15 to 49 report having their first child between 
15 and 19 years of age: 40.3 percent in Grenada, and 42.2 percent in St Kitts and Nevis. 13 
Engaging in transactional sex with many different men and getting involved in the sex trade to 

7 The outliers are Antigua and Barbuda and St Vincent and the Grenadines, which both have a female-to-male 
primary enrolment ratio of 0.93. 
8 The countries present varying primary completion rates: they are equal for boys and girls in St. Lucia; in Dominica 
and St. Kitts and Nevis females have a higher completion rate than males; and the other countries males have a 
higher completion rate than females.  
9 Caribbean Secondary Education Certificate and Caribbean Advanced Proficiency Examination are the 
examinations that students take at the end of secondary school. Caribbean Advanced Proficiency Examination is 
intended for university qualification. 
10 Caribbean society has been characterized by institutional sex discrimination in education, stemming from the 
immediate post-slavery period.  An intentional sex segregation of curricula ensured differential socialization of 
males and females into gender-related roles. Girls from working-class families were prepared for motherhood or 
domestic service in elite homes, while boys from working-class homes were groomed for manual labor in 
agriculture and industry. Middle-class girls were prepared to be good wives and mothers, clerical workers, nurses, or 
teachers, while boys from this social class were prepared for commerce and politics, among other class-appropriate 
occupations.  This gendered aspect of education has affected girls’ and boys’ different choice of studies and types of 
training.

earn some money expose girls to multiple pregnancies and many other health risks—particularly 
the risk of contracting HIV/AIDS and/or STIs. 14  Furthermore, when girls get pregnant and drop 
out of school, they have fewer livelihood options than their male counterparts, which ultimately 
may lead to their increased dependence and higher levels of poverty.  Teenage pregnancy is also 
related to poverty: in St. Lucia both qualitative and quantitative data indicate that poor women 
are more likely to have their first child much earlier during their teenage years. 
HIV/AIDS is another concern that seriously affects both women and men’s health in the 
OECS countries, and it is deeply entrenched in gender differences and inequalities. Young 
women aged 15-24, who are three to six times more likely to contract the infection than young 
men, are the most at-risk population. 15  
E. Labor Market Participation  
Differences in the labor market based on gender pervade the subregion and affect men’s 
and women’s access to and quality of employment. 16 Although working, including working 
outside the home, 17 has always been part of the Caribbean woman’s identity, women face lower 
labor market participation, lower wages, and higher unemployment rates than men.  
Women’s labor force participation is generally low compared to men’s. 18 In St. Lucia, of the 
population aged 15-64, 69 percent of women and 81 percent of men participate in the labor 
force; and among the same population in St. Vincent and the Grenadines, 60.7 percent of women 
and 83.3 percent of men participate in the labor force. Unemployment rates are also higher 
among women than men: in Dominica, 33.8 percent of females and 20.2 percent of males are 
unemployed, 19 and in Grenada 31.8 percent of females and 17.9 percent of males are 
unemployed. (In Antigua, however, female unemployment is a low 4.1 percent). Youth are 
particularly vulnerable to unemployment, although gender differences depend on the local 
context. In Grenada, for example, 27.5 percent of male youth and 21.1 percent of female youth 
are unemployed. 20 Data from 2008 regarding the regional distribution of unemployment by 
education level suggest that both men and women with low education levels are more likely to be 
unemployed. Also, in the Caribbean the gap in earnings between males and females is still high 
at 17 percent. 21 
Qualitative analysis shows that women are more involved in the informal sector than 
men. 22  By contrast, men seem to be more exposed to vulnerable employment than women.23 
Facing the structural changes of moving from traditional rural employment toward a more urban 

14 In St. Lucia, transactional sex is not only a source of the income single mothers need to feed their children, but it 
is also the greatest reason for STIs and HIV/AIDS as these women are unable to afford contraception and bargain 
for safe sex. Caribbean Development Bank Poverty Assessments (2006).

23 In St. Kitts and Nevis both men and women experience a low share of vulnerable employment: 9.9% of male 
employment and 6.6% of female employment. The gender gap increases in Dominica, where males’ vulnerable 
employment accounts for 29.3% compared to females’ 20.5%. WB, Gender Statistics for 2001.

profile of occupation, women in OECS countries are getting jobs in tourism and are increasing 
their involvement in occupations other than the agriculture sector. 24 Today, the service sector is 
the main source of employment for both men and women in LAC, accounting for 51.7 percent of 
men’s and 77.7 percent of women’s employment. 25 In Antigua and Barbuda in 2008 the service 
sector accounted for 93.8 percent of females’ and 69.5 percent of males’ employment, and in 
Dominica 81.5 percent of employed women and 43.9 percent of employed men work in 
services. 26  
F. Entrepreneurship and Access to Finance 
A growing number of women are involved in entrepreneurship, developing businesses in 
areas such as woodwork and manufacturing. 27 Although the percentage varies, female 
participation in firms’ ownership is remarkably high in the OECS: from 76 percent in St. Vincent 
and the Grenadines to 32.1 percent in St. Lucia. 28 However, female owned enterprises are more 
likely to be micro or small firms than medium or large firms. Additionally, they are usually 
smaller, both in terms of sales and number of employees, and they tend to focus on less lucrative 
areas, such as commerce and personal consumption services. Female owned firms are also less 
stable, less productive, and less profitable. 29  
Inadequate access to finance is among the main factors hindering entrepreneurship, and in 
the Caribbean women have less access to finance than men. In a recent survey, 67 percent of 
interviewed female entrepreneurs in the region report that access to finance is a critical constraint 
to developing and operating firms. 30 Because women tend to work in low value-added sectors, to 
receive lower wages, and to be promoted at lower rates than men, they save less than men. Other 
factors impeding women’s economic development as entrepreneurs include limited access to 
training, markets, and technical assistance. 31 
It has been reported that there is a shortage of microfinance institutions specifically 
addressing females and youth.32 Most programs are not tailored to the specific face of poverty 
in the subregion—that is, female, youth, undereducated, and rural. Some positive cases are 
reported:  for example, in St. Kitts and Nevis the Government provides microcredit loans at 
minimal interest to enable women to finance their businesses and facilitate the starting-up of 
their micro enterprises. 33

G.  Natural Disasters  
Although both men and women are badly hit by natural disasters, women are usually 
reported to be the most affected population. 34 In the Eastern Caribbean men and women hold 
different places in society, support distinctive activities, have different access to resources, and 
have different priorities and needs. These differences, along with their unequal access to the 
labor market and gendered differentiation of skills in the labor force, influence how both men 
and women react, address and adapt to and recover from natural disasters.  
Women’s livelihoods—such as employment in the tourism and the subsistence and small- 
scale farming sectors—and their fewer labor opportunities leave them more vulnerable and 
dependent in times of disaster. Following Hurricane Ivan, Grenada’s worst-hit sector was 
agriculture, including the nutmeg industry, and this led to serious loss of income among 
women. 35 Women working in these areas had few other skills with which to move to another 
occupation. In St. Lucia after Hurricane Tomas’s devastation, women reported that their self-
sustainability was deeply hampered and they feared becoming dependent on husbands, partners, 
and fathers to meet their subsistence needs. 36  
Women’s higher vulnerability is also linked to their specific needs, such as those related to 
health, security, and safety. 37 In a study on disaster risk management and climate change in 
Dominica and other Caribbean countries, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) 
reports that sexual violence against women is a common risk in emergency shelters. In Grenada, 
the lack of security and separate facilities for men and women contributed to the sexual abuse of 
girls. Men’s vulnerabilities, on the other hand, are usually embedded in their gendered role as 
protector and provider. In St. Lucia men’s major concern in the aftermath of the hurricane was 
related to their inability to farm because their lands were swept away or hard to access because 
of damaged infrastructure. Men are at greater risk for alcoholism, drugs, and gambling: in 
Grenada increased alcohol consumption, drugs, and looting have been reported as possible 
coping mechanisms among men.  
Gendered roles, labor segregation, and unequal access to opportunities prevent women 
from taking advantage of certain situations. Men’s resilience is mainly rooted in their 
professional and work contacts, technical abilities, limited childcare responsibilities, and access 
to resources. 38 For example, in Grenada, after Hurricane Ivan, men transitioned from the tourism 
and agricultural sectors to the construction sector and were involved in the productive sphere 
rebuilding homes. The same kind of change was not possible for women, who reported 
challenges in accessing this labor market. Women’s resilience increases with extensive 
knowledge of community and social networks, high level of risk awareness, and their caring 
abilities. 39 Following their gender roles and socially consolidated norms, in Grenada in the 
aftermath of the hurricane women devoted their energy to the caring aspects of the community, 
providing moral support, preparing common meals, and comforting children. Additionally, 
during the relocation phase, in line with women’s socially constructed protector role, they were

organizing personal belongings, taking care of children and men, and creating human chains to 
save children, elderly people, and persons with disabilities. 
The subregion lacks gendered components in the main instruments for assessing and 
implementing disaster risk management (DRM) mechanisms. 40 The Hyogo Framework of 
Action establishes that at both national and regional levels a gender-responsive approach is 
critical to minimize risks and to strengthen resilience mechanisms. However, the OECS 
Environmental and Sustainable Development Unit’s strategy on climate change and DRM gives 
limited attention to gender concerns at both design and implementation levels, and its 
Vulnerability Benchmarking Tool lacks elements to assess gendered vulnerabilities.  

H. Gender Norms   
In the OECS the gendered experience of violence is deeply entrenched in the society’s 
norms, traditional roles, and cultural values. Despite adopting international instruments and 
establishing institutions to protect women’s rights and eradicate violence against women, there 
are still elements of a culture that often justifies violence against women in the OECS 
countries. 41 Men’s experience of violence is more linked to crime-, drug-, and gang-related 
activities, 42 while women are more likely to be exposed to sexual, domestic, and intimate partner 
violence. 43   
Young men in the sub-region are particularly at risk of being the victims and perpetrators 
of violent crime. UNODC’s sex-disaggregated data for the subregion show much greater male 
homicide than female homicide—the rate of male homicide (per 100,000 people) ranges from 
66.7 in Antigua and Barbuda to 93.3 in St. Lucia. 44 Gang-related activities affect youth, 
especially at-risk youth who are more likely to engage in criminal activities, violence, and drug 
trafficking. 45 Cunningham’s study on youth at risk in LAC reports that in the region the majority 
of perpetrators of violent crime are young men aged 16-25; 46 in addition, these young men are 
exposed to a high risk of murder.  
Women, by contrast, are more likely to be the victims of intimate partner violence and 
unwanted sexual practices with their partners. Intimate partner violence is among the most 
widespread forms of violence that women and girls experience. According to both UNICEF and 
USAID, it is difficult to estimate the rate of violence against women because incidences of 
violence are underreported and there are institutional weakness in collecting data and 
investigating cases of violence. 47 Nonetheless, USAID reports anecdotal data showing that 
violence and abuse are increasing in the subregion, with 40-50 percent of women experiencing 
some form of domestic violence. The US State Department’s Human Rights report for St. 
Vincent and the Grenadines (2012) states that “Violence against women remained a serious and

development and their successful integration into society as productive citizens” (Barker and Fontes 1996).

pervasive problem” and identifies domestic and sexual violence against women and girls as 
among the most serious human rights problems.  
Most of the OECS countries have established mechanisms to deal with domestic violence, 
but effective implementation is hampered by lack of resources and gendered sociocultural 
stereotypes that lead people to accept higher levels of violence and make victims reluctant to 
seek professional support. CEDAW’s Shadow Report for St. Lucia notes, for example, that 
although St. Lucia has had a law against domestic violence since 1994, even when domestic 
violence occurs close to law enforcement bodies such as police stations, often no action is taken.  

I. Female Participation in Decision-Making Spaces 
In the last two decades all OECS countries have made notable progress in increasing 
women’s parliamentary participation. For example, in St. Lucia the percentage of women in 
parliamentary seats grew from 0 percent in 1990 to 17 percent in 2012. However, the OECS 
countries, with an average of 13 percent female participation in parliament, still lag behind 
upper-middle-income countries and LAC averages (22 percent and 25 percent, respectively). St. 
Kitts and Nevis are farthest from the average at 7 percent, and St. Lucia and St. Vincent and the 
Grenadines closest at 17 percent. 48 Women’s access to ministerial positions is still low in the 
OECS countries—15.8 percent in Dominica, 19 percent in Grenada, and 20 percent in St. 
Vincent and Grenadines. 
In the Caribbean, as in most of LAC, women are more likely to sit in “sociocultural 
cabinets” than in “economic-political cabinets.” 49 In 2011, 59 percent of female ministers 
were seated in “socio-cultural ministries” and 14 percent in “economic-political ministries”.  
In OECS local governments, the higher positions, such as city councilors and mayors, are 
extensively held by men. 50 In Antigua, in the last 15 years no woman has been elected to any 
city council, and in Dominica no female mayor has been elected since 2002.   
The data on women’s access to decision-making positions are more encouraging for the 
judicial branch. In the last three years women’s participation on the subregion’s Supreme Court 
has ranged between 52.2 and 60 percent 51—considerably higher than the LAC regional average 
of 23 percent. 52 A possible explanation could be that women are more likely to continue higher 
education and are thus qualified and eligible for such roles.  

J. Concluding Remarks 
Gender inequality is a cross-cutting concern in all sectors in the OECS countries. It is also 
an endogenous variable and can be addressed to a considerable extent by a change in the social 
and cultural mindset. The fact that the existing social norms and gendered stereotypes explain the

The biggest concerns for the younger generation are teenage pregnancy, HIV/AIDS, and 
violence, which jeopardize social and economic progress by affecting the future labor force and 
youth’s own development. The gender-based violence (GBV) that plagues the subregion puts an 
additional strain on the overall health of the economy and of the society. It is important to work 
strategically at the ground level to tackle the social drivers of these concerns—addressing men’s 
and women’s norms and behaviors and stimulating men’s, boys’, women’s, and girls’ 
engagement in addressing unequal and risky attitudes.  

The following points identify some areas in which the World Bank could provide technical 
and financial assistance in the gender area, sometimes within World Bank projects. 
However, to identify more specific interventions and support comprehensive sex-disaggregated 
data sets would require country- and region-wide consultations to better understand the needs 
and demands of men and women, as well as government priorities.  
Gender mainstreaming  
• Assist Gender Departments in developing gender action plans and gender policies and 
support the incorporation of gender analysis in assessment, monitoring, and evaluation of 
government programs. 
• Strengthen technical skills to develop sex-disaggregated indicators within all ministries, 
especially those related to labor market and violence, and support sex-disaggregated 
statistical data collection and analysis. 
Education 
• Support the design and implementation of strategies, including constructive engagement 
approaches in curriculum, to target boys’ weak educational outcomes and their high dropout 
rates; develop behavioral change projects to provide boys, parents, and teachers with 
alternatives to existing norms around masculinity. 
• Support “second chance” learning programs, including life skills components, to improve the 
quality and quantity of vocational training and work force development; strengthen public 
and private collaboration, linking the education system’s second chance learning to available 
employment opportunities. 
• Support further research to better understand why boys are underperforming compared to 
girls and dropping out at higher rates than girls, especially at the higher levels of education. 
Health 
• Support programs linking health practices to broader social, economic, cultural, and 
environmental factors that affect health care provision. 
• To change social norms around potentially risky behaviors, encourage reproductive health 
education in school curricula to educate children at an early age, and educate adults.  
Safety nets 
• Support the development of social safety network programs that target vulnerable 
populations, such as female-headed households and youth; assist single parents; and provide 
tailored financial contributions to larger families. 
Labor market and access to finance 
• Assist labor institutions in designing policies and developing programs to improve 

64 

employment opportunities, especially for women and youth; set up business advisory 
services to promote women’s entry into the private sector and provide consulting and training 
on business expansion; work closely with the education sector to tailor “second chance” 
programs to market needs; and develop tailored programs, training, and workshops to 
improve women’s economic empowerment through business skills development and 
knowledge.  
• Support the development of micro-credit programs that facilitate women’s access to credit 
and support young entrepreneurs in new ventures; collaborate with local banks to diversify 
financial products and services to cater to the different needs of entrepreneurial women. 
• Support more research to better understand the links between gender-differentiated 
educational attainment, formal and informal labor market opportunities, and poverty, as well 
as men’s and women’s different financial demands, needs and constraints.  
Environmental and climate change resilience 
• Encourage and support national and regional disaster relief institutions to include women’s 
organizations in planning and response mechanisms, and to incorporate a gender perspective 
in DRM strategies. 
Gender-based violence 
• Support national and local institutions in efforts to prevent GBV and support victims of 
GBV, including by creating better data on victims of GBV, incorporating related topics on 
gender norms in school curricula, and through awareness campaigns and media, etc.  
Participation in decision-making spaces 
• Support policies and initiatives to facilitate and pave the way for women’s participation in 
local and regional leadership roles.  
• Support initiatives that promote and facilitate women’s entrepreneurship, including through 
access to finance and the recognition of female entrepreneurs.

Annex VI. Monitoring and Evaluation 

Progress in achieving the goals of the RPS will be assessed through two Performance and 
Learning Reviews—in FY16 and FY18—and a Completion Report in FY19. The team 
understands that the lack of reliable data in the OECS may create problems in establishing 
baselines for measuring progress at the start of the implementation of this RPS. Therefore, 
baselines will be thoroughly reviewed at the time of the first Performance and Learning Review 
(PLR), in FY16. Each PLR will be accompanied by a comprehensive OECS Country Portfolio 
Performance Review to provide information on the progress of the strategy and recommend 
appropriate actions to address emerging issues. 

Results-based monitoring is particularly challenging in the OECS, where the collection of 
timely and accurate data remains a problem, not least because of human resource and 
capacity constraints. The frequent and timely availability of high-quality data on poverty and 
social conditions is critical for the OECS governments to design, implement, and evaluate the 
policies and programs to reduce poverty and achieve the Millennium Development Goals, and 
for the Bank to monitor progress on the WBG program and the twin corporate goals. However, 
sufficient statistical information on poverty has been lacking in many OECS countries. The 
collection of poverty data has in general received lower priority from the OECS governments 
and has largely been funded by external donors. Because of limited capacity and resources, the 
National Statistical Offices (NSOs) have often contracted out much of the data collection and 
analysis.  

Some progress has been made in framing a sustainable regional initiative to improve data 
collection and elaboration. Beginning in 2001, the World Bank (WB) began actively engaging 
with the East Caribbean states 1 and the regional development partners, working with NSOs and 
the OECS Commission to develop a more country-owned and sustainable regional initiative to 
improve the availability of micro data, particularly household, employment, and labor data. In 
recent years, the WB has collaborated with the OECS Commission to create the Living 
Standards Measurement Committee, comprising the heads of all the NSOs in the region, to 
improve coordination and work collaboratively to address data gaps in the domain of social 
statistics. As necessary and pertinent, donors are invited to participate in the discussions as 
observers. Additionally, the WB has used multidonor trust funds to financially support the OECS 
Commission in conceptualizing a regional Labor Market Information System (LMIS) and 
designing a harmonized Labor Force Survey questionnaire that was piloted in Grenada in 2010. 
In parallel, the WB has provided extensive financing and technical assistance for designing a 
pilot regional Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) System for the Economic Union, which has 
been endorsed by the Secretariat and its member states. Donors such as UNICEF and UNDP are 
in consultations to provide financial support for the implementation stage.   
The WBG has provided initial support to move toward a Sustainable Data Program. 
Building on the LMIS and M&E System activities, the WB engagement in the region has also 
included support for the conceptualization of the Sustainable Data Program—a five-year survey 

1 Activities were supported in the six independent member states: Antigua and Barbuda, Grenada, Dominica, St. 
Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines. 

66 

                                                      
plan to increase the frequency and quality of data collection through a “progressive modular 
approach.” The survey plan will use a Labor Force Survey (the harmonized regional 
questionnaire developed under the LMIS) as a core module, collected every year, to which other 
modules will be added (socio-demographic and consumption household-level modules, plus one 
ad hoc module, depending on needs). The fifth and final year would correspond to a full-fledged 
Living Standards Measurement Survey. This approach will allow for the production of yearly 
data under a five-year cycle that provides both regional and national coverage of a variety of 
development dimensions, and it will feed nicely into the regional LMIS and regional M&E 
System. In this framework, poverty could be measured in years 2 and 5 (using the consumption 
module), and estimated for the in-between years. The progressive addition of modules also 
allows building capacity, moving from a relatively simple survey in year one (the Labor Force 
Survey) to a complex survey in year 5 (Living Standards Measurement Survey).

Annex VII.  The Caribbean Growth Forum (CGF) 

The Caribbean Growth Forum (CGF) is a multistakeholder platform designed to identify, 
prioritize, and implement activities to improve the growth-enabling environment in the 
Caribbean, while promoting participatory public policy-making. It has so far engaged more than 
2,500 representatives from business associations, civil society organizations, government, private 
sector, media, indigenous groups, and international development agencies on themes such as 
logistics and connectivity, investment climate, and skills and productivity.  
The region is characterized by low growth; high unemployment, especially for youth and 
women; high debt ratios (8 of the 12 most indebted countries in the world are in the Caribbean); 
high incidence of crime; and growing vulnerability to external shocks. In the wake of the global 
financial crisis, the high debt/low growth challenge has become even more acute.  
A number of Caribbean countries reached out to international donors to find an innovative 
approach to the region’s growth challenge. A suggestion was made to launch a genuinely 
participatory growth initiative. Following consultations and some preparatory work, the program 
started in mid-2012 with a regional launch event in Jamaica. The process is supported and 
facilitated by the World Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank, the Caribbean 
Development Bank, Compete Caribbean, and the European Union. 
Key Outcomes 
Eighteen months into the initiative, positive outcomes are tangible: 12 countries formally joined 
the process by establishing a national CGF chapter and completing the first phase of national 
dialogue. This effort has led to the prioritization of concrete and actionable activities, and draft 
action plans are now available, with details on each activity’s implementation plan (e.g., 
accountabilities, milestones, timeline, and funding).  
The results of each country’s dialogue were presented at a regional forum in The Bahamas in 
June 2013. At the forum, national stakeholders from government, private sector, and civil society 
were able to compare notes on each other’s priorities and exchange ideas on solutions to 
identified challenges with technical specialists and peers. The high-level attendance (nine 
ministers, several Permanent Secretaries and Directors, and over 300 private sector and civil 
society representatives and technical-level government officials) sent a strong signal in terms of 
both ownership and credibility. The Bahamas Communiqué, issued by the Government of The 
Bahamas during the event on behalf of CGF participating countries, attested to all parties’ 
commitment to inclusive and participatory policy-making, accountability and transparency in 
policy implementation, and the CGF reform process itself.  
By then, each government had also committed to follow up on implementation of the reform 
agenda, to report back periodically on progress (every 4-5 months), and to enable independent 
monitoring of the reforms by private sector and civil society representatives.  
As of June 2014, six countries have completed their First Accountability Workshop (Dominican 
Republic, Jamaica, St. Lucia, St. Vincent, Saint Kitts and Nevis, and Grenada). In addition, the 
Government of Dominica has approved the CGF Dashboard in a Cabinet resolution and is 
preparing the progress report for the accountability workshop to be held in September 2014. A 
main challenge that the CGF is addressing is the lack of trust between the public and private 
sectors and the slow and poor delivery of policies. Indeed, on the one hand, although the 
countries are small in size, communication is very sporadic and trust quite low between public 

68 

and private sector; while on the other, capacity and fiscal constraints make policy delivery 
challenging.  
A Regional High Level Technical Training was held in St. Kitts and Nevis in June 2014 to 
engage 45 key public and private CGF stakeholders on such concepts as policy delivery, 
participatory governance, and accountability and related practical tools. Invitations to this event 
were extended to Anguilla and Montserrat with funding from CDB. An immediate result of this 
training was the establishment of a regional CGF private sector Observatory anchored in the 
OECS Business Council, focusing on monitoring a few key country strategic delivery indicators 
and using a very innovative web platform.  

A gradual shift in mindsets is taking place, moving toward the concept of delivering reforms, not 
just outputs, with simple and useful metrics that can help keep track of progress. Participants 
value highly the Bank’s role as a broker in the process (clear rules of the game, leverage, 
influence, and convening power), and reform champions within government increasingly 
perceive the initiative as an opportunity to put pressure on ministries and agencies that do not 
deliver. In addition, through the CGF national and regional dialogues are informed by the 
production of analytic work in the form of policy notes, in-depth reports, and technical 
presentations at public events, using OECS country-specific data. Donor coordination has also 
been significantly improved in common reform areas and has led to the provision of additional 
technical assistance funds for the OECS countries. 

Participation in the process has been high at both national and regional events (including national 
chapters’ kick-off events and subsequent working group meetings). Extensive media coverage 
has also confirmed the importance of the initiative.  
The structure and format of the CGF has fostered a culture of transparency and accountability: 
all information pertaining to the CGF process, all minutes, and background information 
(including participants’ lists and documents elaborated by working groups) are available online 
on the CGF website. 1   
In addition, CGF events have served as important catalyst for teams from the World Bank 
Group, Caribbean Development Bank, Compete Caribbean, and Inter-American Development 
Bank to engage with each country, as evidenced by increasing levels of exchange and dialogue 
since June 2012. A number of new lending and nonlending operations are being put in the 
pipeline, tackling reform priorities identified during CGF dialogues. The CGF has been an 
effective mechanism for development partner coordination. The continued engagement of the 
UK DFID and the Canadian DFATD, as well as the increased interest of other development 
partners, is a strong sign of the relevance of the CGF as a vehicle for engaging in promoting 
sustainable growth in the region.

Annex VIII. Compendium of National and Regional Strategies 

Antigua and Barbuda 

The focus of the Government’s National Economic and Social Transformation Plan for 2010-
14 is on fiscal consolidation and financial sector stability. The new National Strategic 
Development Plan focuses on (i) fiscal balance; (ii) Education for All; (iii) enhancing the social 
development agenda; (iv) preserving the environment and stronger infrastructure; (v) economic 
sustainability; and (vi) the branding of Antigua and Barbuda. 
The 2014 Budget Statement, “Building a New Economy for Growth and Prosperity,” delivered 
in January 2014, highlights such key areas as (i) fiscal stability, particularly public financial 
management and government procurement; (ii) transforming the public sector to transform the 
New Economy, namely by strengthening strategic management of government policies, 
modernizing civil service management, and developing statistics; (iii) small business 
development, particularly in tourism and agriculture; (iv) social sector transformation, 
particularly social sector reforms and pension modernization; and (v) financial sector stability.  
A new Government is in place since June 2014. 

Dominica 

The Third Medium Term Review of the Growth and Social Protection Strategy 2012-14 
(GSPS), represents the Government’s strategy for pursuing growth and poverty reduction. It has 
a threefold focus: (i) fiscal policy and administrative reform, including creating an enabling 
environment for promoting private enterprise and attracting investment; (ii) sectoral strategies 
for growth (PSD, geothermal, eco-tourism, agro-industries, niche-focused agriculture, water, 
improved export performance); and (iii) strategies for poverty reduction and social protection 
(health, education, social safety nets, housing, infrastructure). 
The GSPS complements the 2013-14 Medium-Term Debt Management Strategy, which outlines 
the Government’s debt objectives for FY2013/14 to FY2017/18. The strategy has the same focus 
of the 2012-14 GSPS  
The Budget Statement for FY2013-14, “Building on the gains we have made” was delivered in 
July 2013. The statement confirmed the three main pillars of the economy highlighted in the 
previous year’s statement: (i) a sound macroeconomic framework and financial management 
system; (ii) reforms to enhance competitiveness; and (iii) targeted investments. It highlights jobs, 
agriculture, tourism, and geothermal development as the main priorities. 

Grenada 

Grenada’s 2014 Budget Statement, “Building The New Economy through higher productivity 
and shared sacrifices for the benefit of all,” delivered in December 2013, focuses on 
(i) improving fiscal management (revenue raising measures; improving tax administration; 
expenditure reduction measures); (ii) agriculture, fisheries, tourism, energy, ICT, and trade; 
(iii) support to small business development; (iv) focus on public-private partnerships; 
(v) education and human 
resources development; 
(vi) health and social security; 

70 

 
 
(vii) constitutional reform; (viii) financial sector regulation; (ix) public sector modernization; 
(x) national security; and (x) disaster mitigation and management.  

St. Kitts and Nevis 

The 2014 Budget Address, delivered 
in December 2013, focused on (i) 
tourism; 
(ii)  construction; (iii) agriculture; (iv) industrial and enterprise development; (v) information 
technology and telecommunication; (vi) energy; (vi) the financial sector; (vii) social 
development; and (viii) law and order. 

Saint Lucia 

The Medium-Term Development Strategic Plan 2012-16 identifies the following development 
themes as “imperative to be addressed”: (i) high dependence on one sector for earning foreign 
exchange and failure in diversification of the export sector; (ii) trade liberalization; (iii) a 
growing fiscal deficit; (iv) diseconomies of small scale; (v) poverty and unemployment; (vi) lack 
of skills and of depth and breadth in education of the workforce; (vii) limited productivity 
growth; (viii) increase in crime and the growth of the underground economy; (ix) deterioration in 
the structure of the family system, and in social capital; (x) absorption of negative cultural 
influences from abroad and youth disaffection; and (xi) exposure to pandemics and high 
incidence of lifestyle diseases.  
The 2014 Budget Statement, “Building the Pillars for Economic Success, Resilience, and 
Fiscal Stability,” delivered in March 2014, highlights the strategic directions for 2014 and 
beyond. It stresses the importance of addressing (i) low growth; (ii) high unemployment; (iii) 
natural events; (iv) economic shocks; (v) fiscal imbalances; and (vi) lessons from the economic 
crisis. Expansion in tourism and agriculture are underlined as key priorities. 

St. Vincent and the Grenadines 

The National Economic and Social Development Plan 2013-2025 outlines the country’s long-
term strategies for national development. It is anchored on the achievement of the following 
goals: (i) reengineering economic growth; (ii) enabling increased human and social development; 
(iii) promoting good governance and increasing the effectiveness of public administration; (iv) 
improving physical infrastructure, preserving the environment, and building resilience to climate 
change; and (v) building national pride, identity, and culture. 
The 2014 Budget Statement, “Strengthening the Socio-Economic Base for Recovery and 
Reconstruction after a Natural Disaster in the Context of On-Going Global Economic 
Uncertainty and Downside Risks,” was delivered in January 2014. It focuses on the natural 
disaster that hit the country on Christmas Eve 2013 and identifies the following priorities: 
(i) energy; (ii) education; (iii) agriculture and fisheries, tourism, information technology, 
manufacturing, construction, financial and other services, 
including 
the cultural and 
entertainment industries; (iv) health sector; (v) the completion of the Argyle International 
Airport; (vi) infrastructure; (vii) telecommunications and water; (viii) improvement of air and 
marine transport; (ix) disaster mitigation measures; (x) sport and culture; (xi) sustainable safety 
nets; (xii) good governance; and (xiii) regional integration. 

71 

 
 
 
Regional Policies and Strategies 

The Common Tourism Policy (2012‐2017) addresses the challenges and opportunities that can 
best be addressed collaboratively at an OECS level, with a view to achieving balanced growth 
and development of the tourism sector in the OECS Economic Union Area. The policy identifies 
the following areas in which action is required to improve the region’s tourism competitiveness: 
(i) investment and product development; (ii) community participation, sectoral linkages, and 
joint procurement; (iii) human resource development; (iv) tourism awareness; (v) research and 
statistics; (vi) access and transportation; (vii) regional facilitation; (viii) environmental and 
cultural sustainability; (ix) marketing communications; and (x) addressing crime that involves 
visitors. 
The OECS Education Sector Strategy, which Member States will use to align their national 
strategies and plans, is built on the successes of two previous education sector initiatives, 
Foundations for the Future 1991-2000 and Pillars for Partnership and Progress 2000-2010.  The 
OECS vision is that all citizens, at every stage of their learning journey, from early years to 
adulthood, are able to reach their full potential and be successful in life, at work, and in society. 
The overarching goal of education in the OECS is to contribute to socioeconomic advancement 
through a quality education system that enables learners of all ages to reach their true potential. 
Seven Strategic Imperatives to achieve the vision and the goal for education in the OECS 
respond to the challenges and priorities identified in the analyses, reviews, and consultations that 
informed the development of the Education Sector Strategy. The Strategic Imperatives are (i) 
improve the quality and accountability of leadership and management in schools, Ministries of 
Education, and other education institutions; (ii) improve teachers’ quality, management, and 
motivation; (iii) improve the quality of teaching and learning at all levels, using learner-centered 
experiences; (iv) improve curriculum and strategies for assessment to meet the needs of all 
learners at all levels of education; (v) increase access to quality early childhood development 
services for children from birth to five years; (vi) provide opportunities for all learners to 
develop knowledge, skills, and attitudes to enable them to progress to further education and 
training and to engage in productive employment; and (vii) increase access to and relevance of 
tertiary and continuing education and increase research and innovation in the OECS.

Annex IX. Summary of the Overall Findings of the OECS Client Survey 

The findings from the FY14 country surveys fielded in four OECS countries (Grenada-GD, 
Dominica-DM, St. Vincent and the Grenadines-SVG, and Antigua and Barbuda-AB) suggest a 
number of themes that cut across countries; however, it is useful to explore the data at a country 
level as there are nuanced differences that are worth taking into account when mapping out 
country strategies. 

The survey sample represents a nearly equal number of opinion leaders in each of the four 
Caribbean countries. Many respondents report little collaboration with the World Bank Group 
(WBG) but a fairly good level of familiarity with the institution. Respondents who collaborate 
with the Bank are significantly more positive about nearly all aspects of the WBG and how it 
operates than those who do not collaborate. Overall, respondents are less familiar with the Bank 
than they are with other organizations, such as the OECS, CDB, and IMF.  
Overall context 
Opinion leaders in the four OECS countries share the view that key development priorities 
include jobs (first and foremost across the countries), education, and growth (education is 
recognized as a critical development priority more in SVG and AB than in GD and DM). In AB, 
public sector governance/reform is considered by more respondents a top development priority. 
For the most part, Foreign Direct Investment, jobs, and agriculture are seen as key to economic 
growth in all the countries.   
The World Bank’s role in the OECS countries  
There is much agreement about where the WBG should focus its resources, and these areas are 
closely aligned with the perceived development priorities: agriculture, jobs, public sector, 
governance, and education. Energy appears to be an area where Bank involvement would be 
valued; and in SVG, health is viewed as an important sector for Bank emphasis.  
In fact when considering where the WBG’s comparative advantage is in OECS countries, 7 out 
of 10 respondents believe that the WBG should lead in supporting efforts to generate 
employment (far fewer believe that other donors should lead).  
The WBG appears to be most valued for its financial resources, but its technical assistance, 
capacity development (particularly in AB), and policy advice are also highly valued.  Capacity 
development emerges throughout the survey as an important and valuable aspect of the WBG’s 
work; the number of respondents who report that capacity development is the most effective 
instrument in their country to reduce poverty is nearly equal to those who say investment lending 
is.  
Operating on the ground 
With most respondents reporting that they do not currently collaborate/work professionally with 
the WBG, it is worth looking at perceptions of how the WBG works by disaggregating those 
who say they collaborate with the institution (24%) and those who do not. Among those who say 
they collaborate, survey findings indicate far more positive perceptions—for example, about the 
WBG’s straightforwardness, flexibility, collaboration with other donors, and collaboration with 

73 

those outside of government. The findings suggest that stakeholders’ level of interaction with the 
Bank is an important predictor for their views of the WBG. 
This is of particular importance when considering how to build support in the OECS countries 
and where it will be most important to direct support-building efforts. When considering 
constituencies, more attention should be given to how to achieve results on the ground, taking 
into account that the WBG does not have the resources to engage with all constituencies. It is 
worth noting that more than 8 out of 10 respondents say that the Bank should have a greater 
presence in their countries, and that even those who collaborate with the WBG are more familiar 
with OECS than with the WBG.  
Looking forward 
A number of the findings relate to how the WBG can be of greater value and how it can 
potentially operate more effectively: 
• Greater outreach.  More than half report that the WBG could be of much more value if 
it were to reach out more to groups outside of government (note the findings above 
related to the relationship between collaboration and more positive views of the WBG). 

• Research findings indicate concern about the level of citizen participation. More than 
half of the respondents report that failed reforms can be attributed to inadequate citizen 
participation. In terms of the WBG’s capacity building, work related to citizen 
engagement is viewed far less positively than capacity building in project implementation 
and policy design.   
• Capacity building is highly valued. It is worth finding opportunities for expanding 
capacity building in these countries.  

• Several findings related to knowledge and public disclosure are worth noting.  A 
majority of respondents report that they rarely or never use the WBG’s knowledge.  
Nearly 4 out of 10 said the WBG’s greatest weakness is that it does not provide an 
adequate level of disclosure. These two findings are worthy of consideration. Is the 
Access to Information Policy known?  Are there more effective ways to get relevant 
knowledge into the hands of those who can use and apply the work?  In the survey a slim 
majority said they would prefer to get their information from the WBG through e-
newsletters, 
followed 
by 
publications 
and 
other written material 
and 
seminars/conferences/workshops.  Depending on the web may not generate interest in the 
WBG’s knowledge at this stage, in the OECS countries (only 56% of respondents said 
they use/have used the WBG website).  
• More innovative financial services.  Nearly 4 out of 10 respondents report that they 
believe the WBG should offer more financial services.

Annex XIII. OECS Regional Partnership Strategy 2010-14: 
Completion Report 

I. Introduction 
1. 
This Annex presents the draft Completion Report for the Organization of Eastern 
Caribbean States (OECS) - Regional Partnership Strategy (RPS) for 2010-2014, as 
revised by the Progress Report (2012).  Preparation of the draft Completion Report has 
been based on such documentation as project Implementation Status and Review reports 
(ISRs) and Implementation Completion Reports (ICRs), project documentation, and 
analytic and advisory activities (AAA), as well as on discussions with country team 
members. The draft has been shared with the OECS governments and selected 
stakeholders, and their comments have been incorporated.  
2. 
The Completion Report rates the delivery of outcomes as moderately 
satisfactory. The WBG has contributed toward improving the OECS economies’ 
resilience to natural disasters and economic shocks. The Comprehensive Debt 
Framework (CDF) is revamping the approach to the management of public debt and 
providing a broader framework for policymaking. Disaster management is now more 
proactive and less reactive. The stage has been set for broader regional approaches on 
education, skills, social assistance, and health, in line with the expectations under the 
RPS. Improved knowledge and dialogue are feeding into strategies to address financial 
sector challenges. Internet coverage is rising briskly. The contribution of the Caribbean 
Growth Strategy to the objective of responding differently to the challenges of growth 
and employment, and the work on agriculture, are notable achievements that compensate 
for the lack of traction in areas such as public-private partnerships (PPPs), business 
environment, and public financial management. The rating of moderately satisfactory is 
consistent with the fact that 61 percent of the objectives were either achieved or mostly 
achieved.  
3. 
The Completion Report rates World Bank Group performance as good. The 
broad objectives of the strategy fitted the reality on the ground and governments’ 
priorities, but limited background information and institutional capacity led to an 
overambitious design that was only partially adjusted by the Progress Report. The WBG 
responded effectively and proactively to emerging challenges in the region, developing 
solutions and contributing knowledge to build regional consensus around common 
solutions (growth, finance, public debt management), which in turn has improved the 
capacity of the donor community (including the WBG itself) to coordinate their efforts. 
The upgraded knowledge base now available provides the countries and the WBG with 
essential tools for the next RPS. The Bank delivered on its lending agenda, and the rating 
of completed projects is in line with regional averages. Portfolio performance was 
affected by capacity constraints and, in some cases, issues related to the complexity of 
projects’ design.

II. Broad Developments during RPS Implementation 
The OECS region has yet to recover from the global financial crisis. 
4. 
Economic growth contracted for four consecutive years following the onset of the global 
economic crisis in 2008 for a cumulative drop of 6 percent in total output during 2009-
2012. A slight rebound in 2013 lifted regional real output by 1.3 percent. The region’s 
major sources of growth (tourism, construction, agriculture, and offshore banking) have 
suffered from weak external demand and tame efforts to improve competitiveness. Per 
capita income in the region declined on average by 4.5 percent, from around US$9,200 in 
2008 to US$8,800 in 2012. Across countries, per capita income fell farthest in Antigua 
and Barbuda (17 percent less than the pre-crisis level), while in Dominica it increased by 
more than 5 percent. Despite large variations in growth performance across the region, 
recovery remained fragile for all countries. 
5. 
The fiscal situation in the OECS remains fragile. The sluggish economic 
recovery has had implications for revenue performance, even as countries implemented 
fiscal stimulus packages that led to a surge in current expenditures. Total revenue 
collection in the region (including grants) dropped by around 1.5 percent on average in 
2013 compared to pre-crisis levels. After a plunge in fiscal balances in 2009, primary and 
overall balances improved by roughly 1.5 percent and 2 percent of GDP in 2012, 
respectively, but they deteriorated further in 2013 (as the average primary deficit 
increased to 1.6 percent of GDP and the overall deficit to 4.9 percent). The fiscal 
situation varies across countries: the fiscal position of St. Kitts and Nevis, Antigua and 
Barbuda, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines has improved because of the recent 
introduction of VAT 1 and strong receipts from the Citizenship by Investment Program 
(CBI); however, in Grenada and St. Lucia the situation deteriorated: current expenditure 
surged in 2009 because of expansionary fiscal policies, and it has remained high since. 
OECS countries’ debt is increasing and has reached levels considerably 
6. 
above the average for Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC). The growth in debt 
was influenced by the impact of a series of major natural disasters, the graduation of 
countries from IDA and consequent lack of access to concessional resources, and the 
global financial crisis. The high level of debt has led rating agencies to downgrade some 
countries and has reduced countries’ ability to borrow from international and regional 
markets. Moreover, the allocation of substantial portions of recurrent revenue to debt 
servicing incurs a high opportunity cost in terms of expenditure that could have been used 
to support growth and address resilience. Average total public debt-to-GDP in the region 
was around 82 percent in 2013, ranging from 74 percent in Dominica and St. Vincent and 
the Grenadines to 116 percent in Grenada. Many countries are already making fiscal 
adjustments, and many have also sought additional financing from international financial 
institutions and donors to undertake these reforms.  
7. 
Declining competitiveness and deteriorating productivity have been a 
significant drag on potential output growth. Productivity growth, as measured by total 

1 VAT introduction:  Grenada (February 2010), St. Kitts and Nevis (November 2010), and St. Lucia 
(October 2012). 

79 

 
                                                      
factor productivity, has fallen significantly since the 1990s. 2 A stagnant and unfavorable 
business environment has likely contributed to the slowdown in productivity in the 
region. The countries have limited options, given the size of their markets and the high 
logistics costs; a sizable share of the educated population migrates for lack of 
opportunities.  
8. 
Increased unemployment has amplified social disparities. Although the 
absence of periodic, frequent, and harmonized data makes it difficult to evaluate the 
recent evolution of poverty and inequality across the OECS or to precisely assess the 
impact of the 2008 global economic crisis on these indicators, it is likely that the lower 
demand for OECS service exports resulting from the 2008 crisis exacerbated the already 
high pre-crisis levels of unemployment. This is particularly evident for service exports 
such as travel and tourism, which account for about 75 percent of GDP and employment 
in Antigua and Barbuda and an average of about 27 percent of GDP and employment in 
the other OECS countries. The overall perception is that poverty has increased since the 
2008 crisis.  

III. Delivery of Results 

Pillar One: Building Resilience 
Result Area 1: Promote Fiscal and Debt Sustainability 
9. 
The PRS noted that improved fiscal and debt sustainability, enhanced efficiency 
and transparency of public spending, and more efficient delivery of public services are 
critical to strengthening the ability of OECS countries to respond to exogenous shocks, 
and to laying the foundation for medium-term growth. During the RPS period, the Bank 
Group proposed to contribute to achieving the following outcomes: (a) strengthening debt 
management; (b) achieving a fiscally sustainable wage bill and ensuring coverage of key 
public services; (c) creating closer linkages between public expenditure and development 
objectives through improved monitoring and evaluation; and (d) improving service 
delivery across the region through regionally integrated e-government services. 
Outcome 1: Debt management functions strengthened.  Achieved 
10. 
The original RPS foresaw a contribution to reducing the debt-to-GDP ratios of 
OECD countries. The Progress Report dropped this objective, as the Bank lacked 
adequate instruments to contribute to its achievement. Through Stand-by Arrangements 
the IMF has led this effort in some countries; with attention to comprehensive public debt 
restructuring that is critical to the achievement of debt sustainability.  
11. 
In accordance with the Progress Report, the Bank focused its efforts on 
strengthening debt management functions, including through the development of debt 
management strategies. According to the information provided by the Eastern Caribbean 
Central Bank (ECCB), St. Lucia, Dominica, and Antigua and Barbuda have prepared 
medium-term debt management strategies (MTDSs).  St. Vincent and the Grenadines is 
preparing a MTDS, and a Technical Assistance Mission visited the country in March

2014. Grenada has requested the assistance of the IMF and the Bank in developing a 
MTDS, which should be ready by the end of 2014 or the beginning of 2015. WBG 
support for these initiatives has been coordinated with the ECCB, which continues to lead 
capacity-building efforts on various aspects of debt management, including conducting 
Debt Management Performance Assessments (DeMPAs) and debt sustainability analyses 
and preparing MTDSs. CIDA-funded technical assistance (TA) to the OECS supported 
the ECCB work program.  
12. Most importantly, at the request of Caribbean countries, the Bank has helped 
define a Comprehensive Debt Framework (CDF), which is being disseminated with the 
cooperation of the Caribbean Development Bank (CDB) and the IMF. The CDF initiative 
is providing a solid platform for designing debt strategies in the region and is informing 
the dialogue among all stakeholders. It will also be a key framework for the design of the 
next RPS. A development policy operation for Grenada that will soon go to the Board has 
been designed following the CDF.  
Outcome 2: Fiscally sustainable wage bill ensuring key public services coverage. Not 
Achieved 
13. 
OECS public sector wage bills have been rising gradually since the global 
economic crisis, reaching around 11 percent of GDP on average in 2013. Only St. Kitts 
and Nevis has shown a decrease in the wage-to-GDP ratio. The Bank’s engagement was 
centered on improving the quality of civil service practices. In this regard, the Bank 
supported Grenada, St. Lucia, and Antigua and Barbuda in conducting functional reviews 
and human resource audits in critical ministries. During 2012-2013, the Government of 
Grenada implemented HR audits in three ministries and one department, with the 
objective of aligning public sector positions and employee skills with the functions and 
programs for which these organizations are responsible. The Bank provided TA to 
support this activity. The implementation of the recommendations of the HR audit is 
pending. In addition, the Bank is currently working with Antigua and Barbuda on civil 
service reform through the Public Sector and Social Transformation project – FY13. 
14. 
Overall, progress in civil service reform in the region has been slow, because 
countries are still operating with outdated norms and practices, some of them going back 
to pre-independence, and also because governments partly retain the role of employer of 
last resort. In these circumstances, it has proven challenging to streamline public sector 
employment and improve the quality of the civil service.  
Outcome 3: Improved government services across the region through the implementation 
of regionally integrated e-government services. Achieved 
15. 
Indicators set under the RPS Progress Report have been met, with the support of 
the e-Government for Regional Integration (EGRIP) Project, which is focused on reforms 
in procurement and tax and customs across the subregion. Nine new e-systems are in 
place: one regional e-procurement system for pharmaceuticals; four e-tax filing systems 
and four multipurpose ID systems—one of each in Dominica, Grenada, St. Vincent and 
the Grenadines, and St. Lucia.  
16. 
The Bank’s contribution through this operation goes beyond setting up the e-
systems to transform service delivery. The e-tax filing system will deliver time 

81 

 
efficiencies in filing taxes online rather than manually/in person. Regional procurement 
of pharmaceuticals will reduce the time to complete a pharmaceuticals requisition order 
in four countries by pooling procurement across the OECS, with gains in economies of 
scale, and the tender and contractual information will be available online; the availability 
and affordability of pharmaceuticals should improve. The multipurpose ID system will 
replace as many as five different identifier numbers with a unique personal identifier. In 
addition, the project contributed to a tighter economic union: the OECS Secretariat can 
adapt the web-based monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system to monitor donor projects 
and progress toward the economic union; a suite of legislation for e-government is 
harmonized across the region; harmonized technical standards for e-government, 
interoperability frameworks, and enterprise architecture are established at the regional 
level; and government videoconferencing facilities have been set up to improve 
connectivity among participating countries.  

Outcome 4: Greater linkage between public expenditures and development objectives. 
Partially Achieved 
17. 
The six OECS countries embarked on a broad common public accountability 
reform program targeting (i) harmonized internal and external audit and public 
procurement legislation; and (ii) support to members of the audit profession, supreme 
audit institutions, and the parliamentary public accounts committees. Partners supporting 
the initiative included the World Bank, the IMF (through the Caribbean Regional 
Technical Assistance Centre), the European Union, and the Canadian International 
Development Agency (CIDA). CIDA funded TA through the Supporting Economic 
Management in the Caribbean (SEMCAR) program, which provides a single platform for 
participating donors to support OECS-wide public financial management reform.   
18. 
SEMCAR has produced preliminary results. Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica, and 
St. Kitts and Nevis have adopted harmonized Procurement Acts and are developing 
supporting regulations and institutional processes. Antigua and Barbuda and Grenada are 
modeling the revision of their Audit Acts on a harmonized act. The Caribbean 
Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions completed an assessment of OECS public 
oversight arrangements. Grenada and St. Lucia are preparing to pilot implementation of 
the Bank portfolio through their own systems. SEMCAR has operated on an “on 
demand” basis, which has led to some dispersion and difficulty in tracking outcomes and 
impact. A menu approach from which countries could choose would possibly help better 
channel the support and ensure quality assistance and delivery of results.  

Results Area 2: Protect and Improve Human Capital 
19. 
The Bank Group proposed 
to contribute 
to 
the 
following outcomes: 
(i) rationalized social safety net systems; (ii) an increase in the proportion of qualified 
teachers; (iii) a better-skilled post-secondary labor force; and (iv) improved data and 
understanding about the region’s chronic noncommunicable diseases. Delivery of results 
has been satisfactory.  

82 

 
 
 
Outcome 5: Rationalized social safety net systems. Mostly Achieved 
20. 
The impact of the global crisis fueled awareness in the OECS countries of the 
need to rationalize and target social assistance systems and led to an informed and 
coordinated exchange of ideas and experiences within the subregion. The OECS 
Secretariat organized the delivery of technical workshops and seminars in which 
government officials shared experiences and learned about best practices, with a view to 
building consensus on actions that could be taken at subregional and national levels to 
strengthen social safety net systems. Simultaneously, the Bank, in collaboration with 
UNICEF and UN Women, conducted social safety net assessments (SSNAs) in five 
OECS countries; these assessments provided the basis for policy reforms that the 
governments are now implementing.  
21. 
The Social Protection (OECS) nonlending TA (NLTA)—FY10 advanced regional 
work and cooperation by supporting capacity building in social protection tools and 
increasing knowledge about the social safety net landscape in OECS countries.  The 
NLTA’s products included SSNAs for Antigua and Barbuda, Grenada, St. Kitts and 
Nevis, St. Lucia, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and technical workshops to 
improve capacity in targeting and management information systems. The NLTA also 
partially supported the creation of a Community of Practice on Social Protection. In St. 
Lucia, additional TA is supporting overall social safety net reform that is partially 
grounded in the findings of the SSNA. Furthermore, broader policy reforms have taken 
place as a result of the NLTA activities, particularly the recommendations of the SSNAs. 
Grenada has developed a Social Safety Net Framework, and St. Kitts and Nevis has 
developed and is now putting into operation a National Social Protection Strategy. 
Dominica is also finalizing an Integrated Social Protection Strategy.  
22. 
The abundant and effective TA led to projects in Grenada (to develop a 
Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT) and in Antigua and Barbuda (to improve the social 
protection system, improve the efficiency of social protection spending, and support labor 
market programs). Both of these projects are under implementation. Previously, the Bank 
had helped design a targeted social assistance system through the Dominica Growth and 
Social Protection Technical Assistance Credit FY07 (TAC), already completed. The ICR 
considered overall achievements under objective IV (corresponding to the social 
assistance component) as substantial. The achievements included (i) modernizing and 
streamlining the systems for beneficiary selection and registration; (ii) strengthening the 
administrative capacity to deliver social assistance; and (iii) designing and implementing 
a public information campaign to inform citizens about new approaches to the delivery of 
safety net programs. A Cabinet-approved proxy means test and the Beneficiary 
Identification System for the selection of beneficiaries were launched in January 2011.  
As of March 2011, information of about 75 percent of current beneficiaries was entered 
into the new Beneficiary Identification System, and 95 percent of those were 
confirmed—slightly below the targets of 100 percent identification and registration of 
beneficiaries. Delays in implementing the new system point to design flaws that did not 
consider political economy roadblocks to the implementation of targeted social 
assistance, and design options for addressing these political economy concerns are 
currently being explored.   

83 

 
22. 
This objective is considered mostly achieved, given the effective support for 
improving awareness of and dialogue on social assistance among the OECS countries, the 
training of staff, and the scoping of the relevant challenges that is supporting the design 
and implementation of two operations on the ground. The Dominica system has been 
designed and is ready for operation, and the projects in Grenada and Antigua and 
Barbuda are on the way to deliver modern social assistance institutions.  
Outcome 6: Increase in the proportion of qualified teachers at the primary and 
secondary levels (i.e. teachers with teacher training qualification) in the OECS. Mostly 
Achieved 
23. 
The proportion of qualified teachers at primary and secondary levels increased to 
65 percent in 2013, surpassing the target set under the RPS of 62 percent for 2014. 
However, these efforts have not brought about better quality outcomes. The OECS 
Education Strategy3 points to “deficiencies in the quality of education, such as inadequate 
levels of literacy and low competences in Mathematics, Science and Technology. 
Performance in Mathematics continues to decline with pass rates reaching 40 percent for 
most States in 2011. In that year a mere 23 percent graduated with the basic qualifications 
of five passes including English and Mathematics at the end of the secondary cycle. At 
the early grades approximately 50 percent of students score below the national average in 
Mathematics and about 40 percent are under-performing in English language.”   
24. 
The Bank’s contribution has been partial and indirect. The Bank supported 
regional efforts to train teachers through the now completed Teachers Career Path 
(OECS) ESW—FY10. IEG rated two completed Education Development Projects 
(Grenada, FY09; St. Vincent and the Grenadines, FY03) both moderately satisfactory for 
achievement of development outcomes, noting the relevance of the objectives, but 
singling out the limited contribution to efficiency. The Bank also provided TA to the 
preparation of the OECS Education Strategy. Support for better-quality education 
statistics through the completed Improving Human Development Data (OECS) IDF – 
FY11 has been effective, with increased availability of quality data.  However, the 
intended Education Sector SWAp—FY12 was not delivered.  
Outcome 7: Better skilled post-secondary workers in the labor force.  Achieved 
25. 
The Bank contributed to improving institutional capacity for training post-
secondary workers, and the pilot experience can inform future efforts. The demand-
driven technical and vocational training program financed by the Bank has supported the 
establishment of institutions and structures for training and certifying post-secondary 
workers.  The indicators set under the RPS were achieved with the support of two OECS 
projects: Skills for Inclusive Growth (St. Lucia, FY07; Grenada, FY09). The cumulative 
number of people enrolled in training programs at level 1 or higher surpassed the targets 
(912 vs. 500 in Grenada and 1005 vs. 870 in St. Lucia). However, the number of 
graduates fell below the targets. Overall, the complementary indicators suggest that the 
initiative had impact covering a wide range of economic sectors and engaging the private 
sector above expectations. Both Grenada and St. Lucia now have a quality assurance 
system firmly in place; they have also met all the requirements for issuing Caribbean 

3 The Bank supported the preparation of the strategy with an IDF grant, Education Sector (OECS) NLTA—
FY11.

Vocational Qualifications and have been authorized to issue them.  With these systems in 
place, the challenge will now be to scale up pilot efforts to achieve larger impact. 4 
Outcome 8: Improved knowledge and information on the subregion’s chronic 
noncommunicable diseases. Achieved 
26. 
The World Bank has produced and disseminated analytic work on health in the 
OECS and throughout the Caribbean at large. 5 The research indicates that OECS 
countries are facing a health crisis, with rising rates of heart disease, diabetes, obesity, 
and other noncommunicable diseases (NCDs).  NCDs disproportionately affect poor 
families, bringing the possibility of disability and premature death and worsening poverty 
as people pay for medical treatment out of their own pockets. The report estimates that 
the annual cost for treating a diabetic ranges from US$322 to US$769 in the OECS. 
Acknowledging that NCDs are the major cause of death in the subregion, OECS 
countries have taken steps to improve their ability to prevent and manage them. A 
growing portion of health spending in the OECS is dedicated to managing NCDs, and 
policies and programs could focus more on prevention at a lower cost and for better 
results. Because data on the epidemiology of NCDs in the OECS are limited, the OECS 
Secretariat, in collaboration with the Bank, has been supporting interventions to improve 
the availability and use of data to inform policymaking, as well as to define a set of 
common regional indicators to monitor NCDs. Dominica and St. Lucia are exploring 
mechanisms to create incentives for achieving better results in the health sector, applying 
the principles of results-based financing. The UN has recognized the Caribbean countries 
as international leaders in driving the NCD agenda; however, because of a lack of 
funding, comprehensive strategies to address the NCD challenge have yet to be drafted 
and approved. 

Results Area 3: Strengthen Climate Resilience 
27. 
The RPS noted, “Given the vulnerability of OECS’ small island ecosystems, the 
central role of tourism in their economies, and their susceptibility to weather-related 
natural disasters, the Strategy provides for support for efforts to strengthen climate 
resilience and enhance environmental sustainability.” The RPS program sought to 
contribute to improving resilience and moving from a passive to an active stance in the 
management of natural disasters. The RPS expected to achieve the following outcomes: 
(i) improved understanding of the vulnerability of critical infrastructure; (ii) a reduction 
in the number of people at high risk of landslides in St. Lucia; (iii) improved management 
of priority terrestrial and marine protected areas; and (iv) the establishment of long-term 
financing mechanisms for critical ecosystems. 

4  IEG rated both of the supporting projects as moderately satisfactory for achievement of outcomes, 
downgrading the team’s satisfactory rating. At play is the fact that the projects were severely restructured 
toward the end of implementation to take design flaws into account. With hindsight, the teams could have 
been more proactive and restructured earlier. Still, the contribution of the project in terms of building 
institutions stands. The lesson remains that skills initiatives must be complemented by policies that activate 
labor demand.

Outcome 9: Improved understanding of vulnerability of critical infrastructure.  Achieved 
28. 
Solid progress is being made toward improving understanding of the vulnerability 
of critical infrastructure. An inventory of public buildings and critical infrastructure in 
Grenada and St. Vincent and the Grenadines has been created as a first step in 
establishing a database necessary for undertaking vulnerability assessments. The Public 
Buildings database work is being carried out in Dominica under a trust fund linked to the 
OECS Regional Disaster Vulnerability Reduction Project (Phase 3-Dominica- P129992) 
and in St. Vincent under the Hurricane Tomas project (P124939). Additional work in 
Grenada and St. Lucia is about to be finalized. The Bank has mainstreamed 
understanding of the vulnerability to natural disasters through its operations, with 
activities that include identifying the various risks, constructing risk maps, and data 
management and monitoring. Four Regional Disaster Vulnerability Reduction Projects, 
two of which have already been approved and are under implementation, aim at further 
reducing the vulnerability of infrastructure and developing a comprehensive view of the 
risks and the remedies.  
29. 
The Bank’s contribution on disaster risk management went beyond understanding 
the vulnerability of critical infrastructure. First, the Bank continued supporting recovery 
after major disasters. 6 Hurricane Tomas Emergency Recovery Loans in St. Vincent and 
the Grenadines and St. Lucia (both 2011) responded to the governments’ request for 
support in post-disaster reconstruction efforts.  These projects included regional activities 
on data management and monitoring, coupled with activities to tackle risks and 
vulnerabilities in all Caribbean countries.  The implementation of projects in direct 
support of recovery efforts has taught valuable lessons on project design: rapid project 
preparation led to underestimating the cost of some components and limited the 
implementation of the original pipeline of investments. These lessons have been 
incorporated in the design of the Regional Disaster Vulnerability Reduction Projects 
series through improved cost estimates and room for flexible implementation.  
30. 
During this RPS period the completion of the Caribbean Catastrophe Risk 
Insurance Facility (CCRIF) contributed to the creation of a Regional Insurance Fund to 
provide timely resources to member countries in the aftermath of a natural disaster. The 
parametric modeling of disasters under the CCRIF also contributed to the objective of 
building understanding of the vulnerability of critical infrastructure. Both the team and 
IEG rated this project as highly satisfactory. Moreover, the World Bank is currently 
supporting Caribbean-led efforts to increase climate resilience and decrease vulnerability 
to natural disasters through the Caribbean Regional Pilot Program for Climate Resilience, 
which includes attention to individual countries (Dominica, Grenada, St Lucia, and St. 
Vincent and the Grenadines).. 
Outcome 10: Reduced number of communities at high risk of landslides in St Lucia. 
Achieved 
31. 
Thirteen communities in St. Lucia that have benefitted from the implementation 
of drainage works and guttering to ensure stable slopes in case of flooding also withstood 

6 A sign that the previous efforts have had an impact is that following Hurricane Tomas in St. Lucia in 
November 2010, the World Bank carried out an evaluation that found that investments over the past decade 
held up well and served their purpose. 

86 

 
                                                      
Hurricane Tomas. Most if not all of these community interventions were finalized under 
the St. Lucia Disaster Management Project II (P086469). In addition, the Bank is 
supporting Caribbean governments in the use and application of Open Data for Resilience 
tools and technologies to improve geospatial data management and risk analysis and to 
harmonize national and regional data-sharing on management practices. Improved 
information and coordination should enhance the authorities’ capacity to respond.  
Outcome 11: Improved management of the priority terrestrial and marine protected 
areas. Achieved 
32. M&E systems that include biodiversity monitoring at the site level have been 
established for six OECS protected areas (one in each member state). The ICR of the 
OECS Protected Areas and Associated Livelihoods Project (March 2012) reports that 100 
percent of the M&E systems were established. This was an intermediate indicator under 
the project; notably, all of the development outcomes were met or surpassed.  
Outcome 12: Long-term financing mechanisms established for critical ecosystems by 
2014.  Not achieved 
33. 
The latest ISR for the Sustainable Financing & Management of Eastern Caribbean 
Marine Ecosystem Project (P103470) states that the National Protected Areas Trust Fund 
( NPTAFs) are not yet established.  Initial steps have been taken to establish a Caribbean 
regional endowment fund and national trust funds for the OECS to promote conservation 
of priority coastal and marine ecosystems, although the effort has suffered delays because 
of coordination issues and a change in project implementing arrangements.   

Pillar Two: Enhancing Competitiveness and Stimulating Sustainable Growth 
Results Area 4: Strengthen the Domestic Financial Sector 
34. 
In the RPS, the Bank Group foresaw contributing to improved regulatory and 
supervisory frameworks for non-banking financial institutions. As the difficulties of the 
banking system became evident, the focus shifted to helping improve understanding of 
the situation and designing policy options. This shift is reflected in the revisions 
introduced by the Progress Report.  
Outcome 13: Medium-term resolution strategy for the financial sector.  Achieved 
35. 
The Bank’s work, carried out with DFID support and in collaboration with the 
ECCB, the IMF, and the CDB, improved understanding of the financial sector situation, 
highlighted the various trade-offs in strengthening the financial sector, and led to the 
elaboration of strategic options to ensure financial sector stability. The tight coordination 
among the CDB, IMF, and the World Bank allowed difficult messages to get through. It 
took time to develop a working relationship with the ECCB because of the difficulty of 
the situation. However, the gradual dialogue served to enhance awareness and to provide 
evidence of the need for a solution, given the limited fiscal space in the region. IFC 
supported the Bank of St. Lucia with Advisory Services in investment and SME banking. 
The ECCB and the governments of the member countries are now evaluating the 
adoption of a regional framework and options to strengthen the financial sector.  

87 

 
 
36. 
The Bank also contributed to the orderly resolution of British American Insurance 
Company (BAICO), a regional insurance giant that collapsed in 2009 in the aftermath of 
the financial crisis. The BAICO resolution process is nearly complete, with a few 
policyholders awaiting relief, subject to a grant from the Government of Trinidad and 
Tobago. The orderly resolution of BAICO was an outcome under the original design of 
the RPS, but the Progress Report dropped the outcome because of the time required to 
reach it and the uncertainty of funding from the Government of Trinidad and Tobago. 
Nonetheless, the outcome was achieved. The effective resolution of BAICO had 
important demonstration effects on the capacity to address concerns in the financial 
sector. In addition, IFC invested over US$150 million in two regional insurance 
companies to prevent the BAICO collapse from resulting in loss of insurance coverage 
for the OECS.  
37. 
Bank TA to the financial sector has been provided mainly with support of a DFID 
grant, Restoring Financial Stability in the OECS. The work sought to tackle 
vulnerabilities identified by the 2004 Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) and 
to address difficulties in the insurance sector—an orderly resolution for BAICO and 
Clico International Life, and improved regulation and supervision in insurance. 
Achievements under the grant include, for instance, extensive diagnostics of all domestic 
banks (joint CBD/IMF/WB Report), a stress test of 14 banks, and identification of legal 
and regulatory reforms. This grant also accommodated a crisis response to St. Vincent 
and the Grenadines when the Building and Loan Association (with deposits at 12 percent 
of GDP) faced a deposit run in January 2013 and had to be taken over by its newly 
created supervisor. The availability of DFID funding allowed the Bank to quickly roll out 
TA, and the Building and Loan Association was stabilized and returned to its members in 
August 2013.  Following satisfactory results on the first grant, DFID agreed to provide 
two additional grants for the Bank to continue its work on the financial sector.  
38. 
A planned operation to provide technical support to the financial sector was not 
delivered, as it was considered that more results and outcomes would be delivered with 
TA. A new operation is being considered in the context of the regional framework to 
strengthen the financial sector that the countries are developing.  
Outcome 14: Improved regulatory and supervisory framework for the financial sector. 
Mostly achieved  
39. 
The Bank has been working with the IMF and the CDB on supporting the 
regulatory and supervisory framework for the financial sector. The Bank provided TA to 
review the new insurance legislation in line with international standards and to advise 
ECCU countries on the regulatory architecture for non-bank financial institutions, 
building on the considerable experience it acquired in assisting with the orderly 
resolution of BAICO.  Two reports were prepared, which led countries to establish a 
regional non-bank supervisor, starting with insurance and pensions. A draft insurance bill 
was delivered to stakeholders in February 2014. 
40. 
In the banking sector, work is ongoing to strengthen the banking legislation and 
prudential guidelines. Using extensive background work carried out with the Bank’s 
support, in February 2014 countries agreed on a strategy for strengthening banking 
regulation and supervision and decided that the work would start with independent 

88 

 
diagnostics and legal reforms. The Bank is also currently providing TA on the legislation 
to set up an asset management company to address the high level of nonperforming loans 
in the banking system.  
Results Area 5: Improve Access to Quality Services for a more Competitive Business 
Environment 
41. 
The Bank Group proposed to help achieve the following outcomes: (i) a new 
regional institutional framework for energy; (ii) increased access to ICT services for the 
general population; (iii) PPPs to assist in reducing government expenditure and 
improving services; and (iv) simplified procedures for starting a business and for regional 
trading. With hindsight, the initial design of this results area lacked a coherent supporting 
analytic framework, so that outcomes appear dispersed. During implementation a 
common framework has begun to emerge through the CDF and the Caribbean Growth 
Initiative.  
Outcome 15: Draft treaty establishing ECERA prepared for two countries by 2014. 
Partially Achieved 
42. 
A draft Eastern Caribbean Energy Regulatory Authority (ECERA) treaty for the 
regional electricity regulator is being prepared; a final draft treaty is not expected until 
additional countries commit to joining ECERA. Only Grenada and St. Lucia have 
officially joined the initiative, while other OECS countries are participating as observers. 
Both St. Kitts and Nevis and Antigua and Barbuda have recently expressed their 
intentions to join, and they may commit within six months. A Regional Energy 
Committee is in place and has met eight times. A SIDSDock grant of US$1.5 million 
approved by the Energy Sector Management Assistance Program is supporting efforts to 
bring in new members. A review of the national electricity legal frameworks and other 
efforts are under way to align ECERA’s mandate with the challenges that the countries in 
the region face. In addition to the work on electricity regulation, the Bank is completing a 
review of the energy sector in the OECS region that will inform governments on options 
and trade-offs as countries work to diversify the power generation mix and introduce 
demand management practices. The WBG has been increasingly focused on geothermal 
as an option, especially in Dominica, and is undertaking background work that will help 
Dominica and potentially the broader OECS region reduce external vulnerability by 
diversifying energy sources away from fossil fuels. 
Outcome 16: Increased access to ICT services for the general population. Mostly 
Achieved 
43. 
The use of ICT services in the region has increased rapidly. The number of 
subscribers to broadband services went from 2.88 percent in 2008 to 14.0 percent in 
2013. Over the same period, broadband performance (in terms of downloading speed) 
more than doubled in Grenada, Dominica, and St. Lucia, and increased by more than 50 
percent in St. Kitts and Nevis . The quality of service improved as well. The Bank 
contributed to these objectives through the Telecommunications and ICT Development 
Projects completed at the end of 2011 and rated as moderately satisfactory by IEG for 
achievement of outcomes. The ICR judged the contribution to access and quality as 
substantial, but considered as modest the spillover effects on the economy, noting that 

89 

 
achieving a broader impact will take more time and effort. Despite significant 
improvements in ICT infrastructure, the investment in broadband could be greater, and 
the connectivity among the countries of the region and with the rest of the world needs to 
be improved. Moreover, concerns about competition in the sector remain, and the impact 
on development outcomes has to be further nurtured. The Caribbean Regional 
Communications Infrastructure Program (CARCIP) was launched to help close these 
gaps: a Phase 1 project has already been approved and is under implementation.  
Outcome 17: PPPs in relevant sectors to relieve government expenditures and improve 
service. Not achieved 
44. 
No PPP has been implemented with the assistance or support of the WBG. Efforts 
on two potential PPP operations—one a deal for a general hospital in Grenada—
advanced to the point of design but did not materialize when the political environment 
changed following elections. In view of the slow pace of individual operations, the 
countries and WBG shifted their approach and focused on preparing the Caribbean 
Infrastructure PPP Roadmap, which reviews the outlook for PPP in the region and 
identifies concrete opportunities in providing improved infrastructure, the constraints on 
pursuing them, and possible solutions at the project, sector, country, or regional level. 
The Roadmap found a current pipeline of 14 infrastructure projects that OECS 
governments are actively appraising or developing as PPPs.  
Outcome 18: Simplified procedures for starting a business and trading across borders 
within the OECS by 2014.  Partially achieved 
45. 
The indicators under the RPS results framework show partial progress in reducing 
the number of days to import and export in Grenada, St. Lucia, St. Kitts and Nevis, and 
Dominica. Grenada adopted new regulations on entry. However, these four OECS 
countries’ Doing Business rankings continue to lag behind those of other countries in the 
LAC region with similar levels of income.    
46. 
Investment climate reforms were highlighted as critical in the IFC-WBG 
partnership strategy for the OECS. In partnership with the Canadian Department of 
Foreign Affairs and Trade and Development (DFATD), IFC’s Investment Climate in the 
Caribbean project focused from 2010 to 2013 on reforms to improve the business entry 
process and trade logistics and, to a lesser extent, on business taxation, property 
registration, and enforcing contracts. The projects were partially unsuccessful because not 
all reform targets were met, but legislative and regulatory changes were supported and 
completed in Dominica and Grenada to streamline the process of registering a business, 
while St. Lucia and St. Kitts and Nevis have still to make the regulatory changes 
effective. IFC supported the installation of e-registry software adapted to each client’s 
requirements and trained staff and the private sector in Dominica, Grenada, St. Kitts and 
Nevis, and St. Lucia. The system provides work-flow functionality for electronic 
submission of registration applications and approvals, and connects the Companies 
Registry with the tax and social security authorities. In the three countries where the 
system is operational, it has reduced by about 40% the time required to register a business 
and generated US$400,000 by December 2013.  

90 

 
47. 
Trade logistics are also critical to the Caribbean’s open economies and are at the 
top of the reform agenda. IFC undertook trade and port logistics assessments and 
supported policy dialogue between OECS governments and the private sector. During the 
project, the governments of Grenada and Dominica reduced the number of days it took to 
trade across borders, and governments asked to start a new project on trade logistics in 
2012, in partnership with AusAID, to help automate clearance of imports. In 2012 
Grenada was among the world’s top 10 economies in improving the ease of doing 
business, with reforms in starting a business, trade across borders, and property 
registration: between 2009 and 2014 it has reduced the number of days to start a business 
from 19 to 15, and the number of days to export from 14 to 9. The support came through 
the Public Sector Management TAC (FY06). Still, Grenada’s ranking in the Doing 
Business report (2014) has fallen by five positions to 107.  Doing Business issues are also 
being considered under the Caribbean Growth Forum (CGF), and country targets have 
been set.  

Other activities relevant to competiveness 
48. 
The Bank supported small farmers in Grenada in adopting new technologies 
through the Grenada Small Farmer Vulnerability Reduction Initiative Project, financed 
from the Emergency Window of the Japan Social Development Fund.  The draft 
Implementation Completion Memorandum for the project rated the following as 
satisfactory: relevance, achievement of development objectives, efficiency, and 
development impact of the project.  The grant put in place an innovative, demand-driven, 
and market-oriented incentive mechanism to drive technology adoption. The project 
benefitted from the ability to leverage additional funds and bundle services—south-south 
exchange, analytic work on the logistics chain analysis of two products, regional 
workshop—to provide tailored development solutions to the client. In addition, thanks to 
this successful activity, a Regional Agriculture Competitiveness Project is planned under 
the OECS RPS now under preparation.  

49. 
Growing concerns with the region’s lackluster economic growth and rising 
unemployment led stakeholders to seek a nontraditional approach to the greatest 
challenge facing the region—creating sustainable and inclusive growth. The CGF has 
been the response. 7 The CGF is a facilitated methodology for public-private dialogue 
around issues central to private sector development and growth; it seeks to enable an 
action-oriented dialogue around key policy reforms needed across three thematic areas: 
Investment Climate, Skills and Productivity, and Logistics and Connectivity. The CGF 
engages all critical players—the public sector, the private sector, academia, youth, civil 
society, and the Caribbean diaspora—in the dialogue on how to stimulate economic 
growth.  At the end of the first year, in June 2013, at a regional conference mirroring the 
launch event, individual country action plans and the results of the first year’s 
participatory dialogue were disseminated. The CGF proposes to build a “pro-growth 

7 The CGF, a joint initiative of the Compete Caribbean Program, the Inter-American Development Bank, 
the World Bank, and the Caribbean Development Bank, is supported by CIDA, DFID, the CARICOM 
Secretariat, and the University of the West Indies.

coalition” through a broad-based but unified forum that rewards diverse constituencies 
for active support. The WBG has been actively engaged in the design of the approach, 
providing countries with TA to develop and implement their action plans of reforms. In 
2014, the WBG—with the other institutions supporting the initiative—has begun 
organizing CGF Accountability Workshops in each of the participating countries to 
monitor the implementation of the agreed action plans.  
50. 
As of June 2014, six countries have completed their first Accountability 
Workshop (Dominican Republic, Jamaica, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, St. 
Kitts and Nevis, and Grenada). The Government of Dominica has approved the CGF 
Dashboard in a Cabinet resolution and is preparing the progress report for the 
Accountability Workshop to be held in September 2014. A main challenge that the CGF 
is addressing is the lack of trust between the public and private sectors and the slow and 
poor delivery of policies. Indeed, despite the country’s small size, communication is very 
sporadic and trust between the public and private sectors quite low, and capacity and 
fiscal constraints make policy delivery challenging. In June 2014, a Regional High Level 
Technical Training was held in St. Kitts and Nevis for 45 key public and private CGF 
stakeholders to engage them on such concepts as policy delivery, participatory 
governance and accountability, and related practical tools. With funding from the CDB, 
invitations to this event were extended to Anguilla and Montserrat. An immediate result 
of this training was the establishment of a Regional CGF Private Sector Observatory, 
anchored in the OECS Business Council, focused on monitoring a few key delivery 
indicators through an innovative web platform. A gradual shift in mindsets is taking 
place, moving away from thinking about just outputs toward the concept of reforms 
delivery, with simple and useful metrics that can help keep track of progress. Participants 
greatly value the Bank’s role as a broker (clear rules of the game, leverage, influence, and 
convening power), and reform champions within governments increasingly perceive the 
initiative as an opportunity to put pressure on ministries and agencies that do not deliver. 
In addition, through the CGF, national and regional dialogues are informed by a range of 
analytic work—policy notes, in-depth reports, and technical presentations at public 
events, using data specific to OECS countries. Donor coordination has also been 
significantly improved in common areas of reform, leveraging additional TA funds for 
the OECS countries. 
Rating for Achievement of Outcomes 
51. 
The Completion Report rates the delivery of outcomes as moderately 
satisfactory. Most of the outcomes (12 out of 18) were achieved or mostly achieved. 
• Under the first pillar, the delivery of outcomes was quite strong. Important 
steps have been taken to build the foundations for improved resilience in the 
OECS countries. The CDF revamped 
the approach 
to public debt 
management; it is now being used by the Bank and other development 
partners, and it provides the basis for the new RPS. The OECS’s approach to 
disaster management is being transformed from reactive to proactive. The 
Bank has supported such achievements as a regional facility to insure against 
disasters, an 
improved understanding of 
the vulnerability of critical 
infrastructure, and investments to reduce the vulnerability of the most exposed 

92 

 
communities. Outcomes on improving human capital include analytic work 
and pilots to set the basis for broader regional approaches to education, skills 
development, social assistance, and health.  
• Delivery of outcomes in the second pillar, competitiveness and growth, was 
mixed. The Bank contributed to both improving knowledge about and 
developing strategies to address the financial sector challenges, and it 
successfully continued its support for increasing access to ICT. Because of 
political economy challenges, the agenda did not gain significant traction in 
areas such as PPPs and the business environment. Work on supporting public 
financial management advanced at a slower pace than expected. Although the 
CDF and the work in agriculture (Grenada) were not reflected in the results 
matrix, they represent relevant contributions that compensate for the partial 
delivery on competitiveness and growth.  

IV. World Bank Group Performance 
52. 
The objectives of the RPS were relevant to the situation and to the challenges 
faced by OECS countries, as well as to the governments’ priorities.  The OECS 
economies had been hit severely by the 2008 global economic crisis and by hurricanes 
that caused sizable disasters, especially in Grenada. The reduction in demand for tourism 
services and lower remittances hit output and employment and put the financial sector—
especially the major insurance companies—under stress. A drop in public revenues and 
the need to increase public expenditure to cushion the impact of the crisis led to increases 
in the level of public debt. Therefore, the two pillars of the RPS (building resilience and 
enhancing competitiveness) fitted well the challenges that the countries faced.   
53. 
Limited knowledge in certain critical areas affected the design of the RPS.  
There were various gaps. First, the approach selected to manage the high level of public 
debt was narrowly centered on fiscal consolidation, with limited focus on growth and 
natural disasters. As a result, the RPS initially emphasized budget support operations to 
accompany fiscal consolidation, an approach that did not work.  Second, there was 
limited background knowledge on how to spur growth and employment, and 
consequently the program to help rekindle economic growth was weak. Third, the 
approach to the management of natural resources was initially reactive, as in the past.  In 
addition, the RPS results framework did not fully capture the scope and relevance of the 
WBG’s engagement in certain critical areas, even after the adjustments introduced by the 
Progress Report.  Finally, the RPS could have been more selective—18 objectives 
stretched the capacity of the WBG and the countries. Greater selectivity could have been 
obtained by a more careful analysis of the relationship between the objectives and the 
program.   
54. 
The RPS was implemented under difficult circumstances. The OECS 
economies had not recovered from the impact of the crisis because the global economy 
continued to be sluggish, the opportunities to diversify were scarce, and the high levels of 
public debt continued to limit the governments’ capacity to take a proactive stance. 
Natural disasters added to the stress on the OECS economies. It was increasingly  

93 

 
 
• 

challenging for the OECS governments and the supporting developing community to 
adjust strategies and programs to the continued difficult circumstances.  
55. 
The WBG showed flexibility in adjusting to the emerging situations.  The 
Bank’s response came in various ways.  
• The Bank adjusted its lending to help repair critical infrastructure after 
Hurricane Tomas in St. Lucia and St. Vincent and the Grenadines.  
Recognizing the serious impact of disasters on the population and on the fiscal 
situation, the Progress Report further directed lending toward disaster risk 
management, and the new lending for disaster risk management emphasized 
prevention rather than reaction only.  
• As traditional approaches to debt reduction ran their course, the Bank 
gradually adjusted its approach to work on debt, growth, and finance. The 
CDF, which was built on the regional dialogue and good supporting analytics, 
emerged as a holistic approach to debt and macroeconomic sustainability 
during the implementation of the RPS.  The CDF defined for the Bank a role 
compatible with its mandate and comparative advantage, thus reducing 
overlap with the IMF.  
In response to the mounting concerns about economic growth, the CGF 
emerged as an innovative approach to identifying priorities and targets: OECS 
countries commit to pro-growth reforms, and the commitments are tracked 
over time, while donors provide TA and/or resources in line with these 
commitments.  
• The work on financial sector has followed and responded to the emerging 
challenges. Frank dialogue with the authorities has brought agreement on an 
in-depth analysis of the situation by the Bank (now under way), and on the 
need to adopt a regional approach with strong political backing to increase the 
odds of dealing successfully with the emerging challenges.    
56. 
Lending delivery was in line with program, while it was also responsive to 
emerging challenges. Since FY10, the Bank has delivered 14 operations, of which 10 
were planned under the RPS or the Progress Report. Including the operations now under 
preparation, IDA commitments will amount to US$198.9 million and IBRD’s to US$18.5 
million. The full IDA16 (FY12-14) envelope will have been used. Of the four operations 
not planned, two came about as response to Hurricane Tomas. A development policy loan 
(DPL) for Grenada, now under preparation, supports the implementation of the CDF and 
complements IMF efforts in support of macroeconomic stabilization. The operation is in 
line with the RPS’s initial intention to provide budget support, with the difference that the 
supporting policy framework is stronger than before. The proposed OECS Financial 
Sector Strengthening and Regulation Project and the OECS Education SWAp were not 
delivered. For the financial sector, extensive and effective technical support was provided 
with the support of a DFID grant. The new RPS includes a financial sector operation. 
With an OECS Education Strategy now available, financing of education will be taken up 
in the new RPS.  

94 

 
57. 
Various factors affected portfolio performance adversely. The disbursement 
ratio fluctuated during RPS implementation; at an average of 23 percent, it is lower than 
the LAC average (28.1 percent for 2008-2014.) Given the size of the portfolio, the 
disbursement ratio is sensitive to the presence of budget support operations. Poor 
capacity at the country level and at the level of the OECS Secretariat slowed down 
project implementation. Moreover, compliance with procurement regulations has proven 
cumbersome for the small economies. No disbursements are at risk today. 
58. 
Project design issues affected implementation and delivery of results.  For 
instance, cost estimates proved unrealistically low and affected the implementation of the 
Hurricane Tomas Recovery projects. The team is now developing better cost estimates 
for potential investments (e.g., bridges, roads, centers) to be ready to help manage 
emergencies in a timely and effective way. Another issue that emerged is how best to 
design regional engagements. Working directly with the OECS Secretariat in the 
implementation of several projects, while posing interesting challenges of institution 
building, proved cumbersome because of the extra layer of coordination. A superior 
approach is to design regional platforms that provide menus from which the countries 
select those components that best suit their challenges and their policies.   
59. 
The Bank sought to improve project implementation by granting the OECS 
additional flexibility in the use of the Procurement Guidelines. In 2013, to improve 
project performance and delivery of results and to respond to the demand of the OECS 
countries’ authorities, and after consulting with 
the business community and 
representatives of civil society, the Bank eased its procurement rules for small contracts. 
The new procurement practices favor the development of local business in the OECS by 
taking account of the limited number of suppliers, the prevalent forms of business 
organization, and the history and size of businesses.  
60. 
Political economy issues affected delivery of results. Politics affected the 
delivery of outcomes in various ways. First, the political cycles of the various OECS 
countries are not coordinated and therefore it is not possible to align the strategy with 
political cycles.  Second, shifts in government affected implementation through changes 
in policy or in administrative personnel. As an example, the recent change of government 
is Grenada brought to a halt one PPP operation that was under preparation, and 
management changes delayed implementation of the social protection projects. Third, 
political economy issues have also affected the traction and development of certain 
issues, such as the role of the private sector in the development process.   
61. 
The quality of delivery compares favorably with regional averages. For 2008-
2014, ICRs are available for 25 OECS projects. Of these, the country teams rated 21 (85 
percent) as moderately satisfactory or better, which is above LAC averages. However, 
IEG rated only 18 as moderately satisfactory or above. The ratings of 10 projects were 
downgraded and two were upgraded, of which one became highly satisfactory. The high 
level of disconnect between the ratings of the teams and those of IEG is of concern; it 
signals the need for a more careful monitoring of impact through ICRs and other 
instruments.  
62. 
The Bank supported regional integration efforts.  The RPS committed to 
support regional integration and did so in various ways. First, the Bank experimented 

95 

 
through project design—some projects were implemented through the OECS Secretariat 
and others were implemented directly by the borrower countries under a common policy 
platform. The emerging consensus is that the second alternative is preferable because it 
facilitates implementation and provides a better fit to local needs and preferences.  
Second, the WBG used its convening power to develop and encourage policy dialogue at 
the regional level, using sound analytics around common challenges as the basis for 
regional solutions. This approach, as exemplified by 
the CDF and CGF, 
is 
transformational: it helps break barriers to change and helps anchor national initiatives on 
regional consensus for greater likelihood of success.  
63. 
The RPS AAA work increased knowledge of key strategic issues (growth, 
debt, natural risks, health, education, etc.) and helped develop innovative solutions, 
enhancing the Bank’s contribution to the development of the OECS countries. 
Attachment III provides a list of the AAA delivered and the current pipeline, including 
AAA benefiting the entire Caribbean region. The Bank budget resources allocated to 
AAA have been increasing steadily, giving evidence of the importance the team has 
assigned to both analytic work and TA. Highlights of the AAA agenda include support 
for the OECS Education Strategy, PPP development, ICT capacity development, energy 
strategy and geothermal development, logistics, and the business environment, as well as 
for building a regional dialogue and capacity on social assistance, taking stock of NCDs, 
and restoring financial sector stability. In addition, the design of the CDF and the CGF— 
initiatives that have involved regional institutions and other development partners—
represent innovative ways to address challenges in the OECS countries and more broadly 
in the Caribbean. In hindsight, although the provision of TA has been tailored to fit needs 
and delivery has been timely, a greater effort was needed to go beyond targeted 
assistance to build local capacity.  Also, despite all these efforts, major knowledge gaps 
remain, including in the areas of poverty and inclusion.  
64. 
Collaboration between the IFC and the Bank was strong on the advisory 
side, but results were more limited in private sector investments.  IFC worked in 
close coordination with the WB in a range of TA areas such as business registration, trade 
logistics, and credit bureaus. However, IFC investment opportunities are limited because 
of the small size of the OECS, especially in the absence of stronger regional integration. 
The effectiveness of the joint work between the IFC and the Bank could be further 
improved. The work on PPPs is a good example of cooperation that did not meet the 
expected results, primarily because of the problems with the political economy of the 
region. The effort to put together a roadmap for PPPs seems a step in the right direction, 
but it needs to be developed further in the next strategy.  
65. 
The Bank has maintained a broad and fruitful cooperation with other 
development partners active in the OECS in all areas of engagement: with the IMF 
on fiscal and financial sector challenges; with DFID on the financial sector; and with a 
broad range of partners in supporting public expenditure reform. Support for disaster risk 
management has mobilized substantial resources from global funds to complement Bank 
resources in pursuit of the RPS objectives. Attachment IV lists the trust funds that 
provided complementary financing in several strategic and priority areas of engagement. 
In general, the World Bank’s participation in the quarterly meetings among bilateral and 
multilateral partners organized by the United Nations Regional Coordinator in Barbados 

96 

 
has proven to be a valuable way to increase coordination and share relevant information 
among partners.  
Rating for World Bank Performance  
66. 
The Completion Report rates WBG performance as good.  The broad 
objectives of the strategy were aligned with the reality on the ground and the priorities of 
the governments. The detailed design was affected by the inherited limited background, 
which, combined with the limited capacity in the countries, led to an overextended design 
that included 18 objectives. The results framework could have better reflected the scope 
of the program and spelled out with greater clarity the chain or results between activities 
and development impact. However, the WBG responded effectively and proactively to 
the region’s challenges by developing solutions and building the supporting knowledge to 
assist in creating regional consensus, encourage shared solutions, and improve its own 
capacity and that of the development community to help. The WBG also responded in a 
timely manner to the countries’ need for support after natural disasters. The WBG was 
able to mobilize resources from other donors, working with them around such critical 
agendas as disaster risk management, public financial management, financial sector, debt 
management, and social sectors. The upgraded knowledge base now available provides 
the countries and the WBG the basis to deliver outcomes under the next strategy. The 
Bank delivered on the lending agenda, and the ratings of completed projects are in line 
with regional averages. Portfolio performance has been affected by capacity constraints 
and, at times, complex designs. Efforts to improve delivery include working on design 
and being more flexible in the enforcement of the procurement guidelines to better adapt 
them to the reality of small countries.  

V. Lessons and Recommendations 
67. 
The OECS RPS 2010-14 was implemented under difficult circumstances. The 
stagnation brought about by the continued sluggish global economy, the scarcity of 
readily available opportunities to diversify, and recurrent natural disasters placed the 
OECS economies under stress. The WBG responded by expanding attention to such 
issues as economic growth and employment, sustainability, the financial sector, and 
energy. Overall delivery of the program was on target with expectations, but because of 
some partial shortfalls, the Completion Report rated the contribution to development 
outcomes as moderately satisfactory. This section highlights the key lessons learned from 
the implementation of the RPS 2010-14, which have been fully taken into consideration 
in designing the new strategy. 
68. 
The objectives set under the RPS should be aligned with the capacity of the 
WBG program to deliver. In the OECS context, with the multiplicity of countries and 
the relatively small scale, it is not advisable to target overly ambitious development 
objectives under a strategy. For instance, the objectives under the original RPS with 
regard to alleviating the burden of public debt proved to be too ambitious for the 
instruments available to the Bank, and they had to be adjusted in the Progress Report. In 
addition, a greater understanding of the link between the objectives and the programs 
could have helped the exercise of selectivity.  

97 

 
 
69. 
The RPS results framework must reflect as accurately as possible the 
outcomes and impact of the program.  Some of the indicators selected under the RPS 
did not reflect accurately the scope of engagement and achievements of the Bank’s 
program—for example, 
those for disaster risk management and public sector 
management. In reality, the impact and contribution of the disaster risk management 
program exceeded the indicators selected. Poor selection of objectives and indicators can 
end up shortchanging the evaluation of program delivery.  
70. 
The RPS support for regional integration through a combination of regional 
AAA work, country-level interventions, and the building of shared understanding, 
vision, and solutions across countries worked well and should be further enhanced.  
It is advisable to use targeted analytic work to develop shared diagnostics that ground a 
dialogue involving all shareholders around the development of regional visions upon 
which countries can articulate policies and programs. This approach can have the added 
benefit of helping governments break local political constraints, coordinate with 
development partners, and lower the costs of developing and implementing initiatives. It 
also allows countries to take the lead on different fronts, creating momentum and 
encouraging peer pressure, which can be powerful drivers of change. Similarly, open 
support menus lead to dispersion; it would be better for project designs to provide 
countries a menu from which they can select the mix that suits them best. The approach 
to supporting regional platforms needs to be monitored continuously and adjusted.   
71. 
A regional perspective will help enhance the opportunities for the IFC to 
contribute to growth and inclusion. The small national OECS markets limit the 
opportunities for the IFC to contribute. As governments and development partners 
address bottlenecks to growth from a regional perspective, the opportunities for the IFC 
to engage will increase. A strengthened financial sector would allow the IFC to invest 
and finance, using innovative practices in making resources available to the dominant 
small enterprise sector.  As the efforts to sharpen a PPP agenda materialize, IFC can lead 
in implementation, bringing in expertise and finance and building partnerships. A 
regional approach to removing constraints to growth could identify opportunities of 
relevance and scale propitious to the skills and comparative advantage of the IFC, which, 
on its side, could continue to explore new practices and approaches suited for small-
island environments.  
72. 
In such complex environments, the Bank must maintain a flexible and open 
approach to be able to respond to evolving circumstances.  Several products or 
activities were developed and introduced during the implementation of the RPS in 
response to evolving circumstances and client demand—for instance, the CDF and the 
CGF. The CDF was a response to the need to address debt issues in a broader context 
than simply fiscal and disaster risk management. The CGF arose to meet the mounting 
concern with economic stagnation. The Bank’s contribution to improving the assessment 
of the financial sector’s situation has in turn transformed the program of support, with 
deep implications for the design of the new RPS.  
73. 
In the past, Caribbean countries have found it difficult to undertake reforms, 
often because of political economy factors. Political economy factors need to be taken 
into account in both the design and the implementation of the program. The OECS 

98 

 
countries are small, highly personalized societies in which the political sympathies and 
loyalties of individuals tend to be widely known and career public servants traditionally 
block reforms led by politicians of the other party; and they are characterized by a 
domestic and foreign private sector that has developed competitive advantages based on 
concessions and exemptions; a weak civil society and media sector that lack the 
necessary autonomy for advocacy; and, finally, the presence of a widespread mistrust 
between public and private sector, which contributes to lower mutual expectations and 
scope for engagement. Despite these challenges, the political stability and good 
governance indicators that result from strong democratic institutions could help avoid 
slippages and reversal once reforms are implemented.  
74. 
Selectivity can help improve focus and delivery.  The need to respond to 
evolving circumstances and demands pressured the WBG program away from selectivity, 
especially during implementation. Indeed, during this RPS, the range of engagement of 
the program expanded, leading in some cases to dispersion—for example, in Grenada. 
Given the importance of selectivity for the quality of the program and the delivery of 
results, a greater effort is needed to prioritize engagements and the rules to follow during 
implementation to maintain the necessary degree of focus.

Lessons 

The Progress Report correctly 
dropped the original objective 
to lower the public debt-to-
GDP ratios, as the Bank did 
not have adequate 
instruments to help deliver on 
that objective, especially 
when the expected DPL 
operations did not 
materialize.  The IMF has 
taken the lead in support of 
this objective.  A lesson that 
emerges is the need for 
credible roadmaps linking 
interventions to objectives to 
anchor the design of the 
results framework.  The shift 
of focus to help develop an 
analytical structure on debt, 
growth, and frailty represents 
a more credible avenue of 
impact.

Achieved  

The target indicator was 
exceeded with the support of 
the OECS EGRIP project 
covering Dominica, Grenada, 
St. Lucia, and St. Vincent and 
the Grenadines. The e-
government services 
introduced are expected to 
have an impact beyond the 
outcomes of EGRIP.  

Partially achieved 

Information on the proposed 
indicators is not available. 

Progress has been made in 
advancing a broad and shared 
public accountability reform 
program targeting 
harmonized internal and 
external audit, public 
procurement legislation, use 
of country systems, and 
support for the audit 
profession, the supreme audit

interventions would link to a 
reduction of the wage bills-
to-GDP ratios. The Bank 
program did not have the 
appropriate instrument to 
contribute to the achievement 
of the objective, and the 
Progress Report should have 
realigned it.  
The supporting project was 
implemented through the 
OECS Secretariat, which 
implied a high level of 
coordination and made for 
difficult implementation, 
although at the end the 
revised results were 
delivered. A preferred 
approach to regional projects 
is to use common platforms 
that are then tailored to the 
needs of the countries.  
The objective and indicators 
did not fully reflect the 
supporting Bank program, 
which was to a great extent 
coordinated with other 
development partners and 
designed to respond to 
demand from the OECS 
countries, which makes it 
difficult to articulate precise 
indicators.

Increase in the proportion of 
qualified teachers at the 
primary and secondary levels 
(i.e., teachers with teacher 
training qualification) in the 
OECS (6 countries) 

institutions, and 
parliamentary account 
committees.  

A CCT system was 
developed for Dominica. 
Work is under way in 
Grenada and Antigua. The 
Bank contributed to 
generating an active and 
ongoing regional dialogue on 
social assistance and the 
sharing of experience.

The design of targeted social 
assistance programs (CCT) 
must take political 
sensitivities into account.  
Creating a regional dialogue 
and generating mutual 
technical support across the 
islands, as well as generating 
leadership by example, could 
facilitate implementation of 
such programs.   

The analysis presented in the 
regional education strategy 
reports limited progress 
regarding quality of education 
despite the gains made in the 
qualification of teachers.

Channeling the supporting 
project though the OECS 
Secretariat proved 
cumbersome for 
implementation, although the 
revised results have been 
achieved.  A preferred 
approach to regional projects 
is to use common platforms 
that are then tailored to the 
needs of the countries. 
AAA intervention in the 
region has helped to analyze 
the situation and develop 
health priorities in the region.  

The objectives/outcomes did 
not fully reflect the scope of 
WBG involvement and its 
achievements in the area of 
disaster risk management, 
which exceeded the outcomes 
under the indicators.

highly satisfactory. An 
important lesson—results 
frameworks must properly 
capture the scope and impact 
of Bank engagement, or high 
achievements may be 
underestimated.  

The Bank’s focus, flexibility, 
and delivery in its work on 
the financial sector were 
exemplary. The initial focus 

104 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
on addressing the difficulties 
of the large insurance 
companies morphed into a 
larger attention to 
understanding the status of 
the banking sector and 
designing options to address 
the challenges in the sector. 
In addition to contributing to 
a deeper knowledge of the 
sector, the Bank has worked 
to increase awareness and 
develop shared solutions in 
the region.

an improved understanding of

ICT is an area of long-term 
Bank engagement, with 
notable results in developing 
regional institutions and 
broadening access.  The 
lesson is that sustaining a 
long-term engagement around 
a clearly defined objective 
reaps substantial positive 
results over the long term.

any future PPP agenda must 
defuse the political risks. The

remains to expand the 
membership beyond two 
countries and to adapt the 
approach to the realities on 
the ground in each country. In 
addition, the Bank has just

The lack of traction of the 
simplification agenda has 
come from the limited

to this agenda.  The CGF
