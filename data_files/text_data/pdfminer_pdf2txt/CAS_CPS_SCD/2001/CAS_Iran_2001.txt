MEMORANDUM OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON AN
INTERIM ASSISTANCE STRATEGY
FOR THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF IRAN

I. 

Introduction

1.1 
Iran is an important country in the Middle East Region. With a population of
63 million, it is the most populous country in the region, and the 16th most populous in
the world. With a GDP of US$111 billion, Iran is the second largest economy in the
region. It is also the second largest OPEC oil producer and has the world's second largest
reserves of gas. Iran is progressively emerging from a long period of uncertainty and
instability, marked of by the destructive war with Iraq, internal post-revolutionary strife,
international isolation, and deep economic instability. As an ancient civilization, and an
internationally important cultural pole, it exerts a great deal of influence not only in the
region but also in the world. Iran's economic prosperity, social progress, and greater
integration into the world economy will not only bring benefits for the Iranian population
but will also have important spill-over effects for the region.

1.2 
World Bank lending to Iran resumed in May 2000 with the approval by the
Board of Executive Directors of two projects: the Second Primary Health Project
(Loan 4550; $87 million) and the Tehran Sewerage Project (Loan 4551; $145 million).
These loans were approved after a hiatus of seven years during which Bank activities
were limited and focused mainly on supervision of ongoing projects and limited
economic work. While approving the two loans, the Executive Directors requested that
Management prepare a strategy note reviewing the concrete progress of economic reform
and developments and outlining the Bank Group's approach in Iran.

1.3 
This Interim Strategy seeks to update the Executive Directors on the current
development situation in Iran, report on the progress of the process of reforms, and
highlight the development challenges and prospects faced by the country. It outlines the
assistance strategy that the Bank Group will follow while preparing a Country Assistance
Strategy (CAS) for consideration by the Executive Directors within the next two years.
Thus, the strategy in this note should be viewed as an interim assistance strategy. The
CAS will reflect the further deepening of the Bank's knowledge over the next two years
of Iran's development process and priorities.

1.4 
Iran is currently in the midst of a major process of econoric re-orientation, and
important evolution of its social and institutional system. This change is taking place in
the context of a relatively open debate with wide participation. In March 2000, the
Parliament approved the Third Five-Year Development Plan (FYDP), which provides the
broad directions of a wide-ranging program of economic reforms and social priorities
over the period 2000-05. The World Bank Group Interim Assistance Strategy over the
next two years would follow a two-pronged approach: (i) policy dialogue on the reform
program through non-lending services; and (ii) targeted lending in the key social and
environment areas consistent with the Third FYDP, and focusing on projects that have

- 2 -

the most tangible benefits and quickest impact on the population, that are least affected
by policy distortions that could constrain their effectiveness, and that are resilient to
Iran's risk factors (see para. 5.1-5.5).

1.5 
The level of IBRD lending is envisaged to be up to US$755 million over the
next two years. This transitional lending volume is small relative to the needs of the
country and the size of the economy. Nevertheless, the level of lending will enable the
Bank to play a meaningful role in assisting in some of the key priority areas of basic
needs while filling the gaps in the Bank's knowledge of the economic, sectoral, and
social situation in the country caused by the Bank's past limited activities, and the still
early stage of the reform process. During the next two years, the Bank will intensify its
sectoral and economic work to strengthen the knowledge of the country, develop a better
understanding of the Government's program and priorities, and further the dialogue with
the different stakeholders to enable the Bank to develop a more informed country
assistance program.

1.6 
Macroeconomic stability and sustainability, and sufficient progress in the key
areas of economic policy reform are critical to putting Iran on a sustainable growth path,
notably in improved private sector environment, financial sector, and pricing system
reforms. On the international relations front, Iran's anticipated sustained progress in
improving its relationships with the rest of the world -- which constitutes a major
achievement of President's Khatami's d6tente diplomacy -- is a key factor in opening
economic and financial opportunities for Iran and in ending its international isolation,
which, among other factors, has contributed to the upheavals of its recent economic
history (see paras. 2.16-2.18). On the domestic side, continuing progress in greater
participation by the civil society and enforcement of transparency will enhance good
governance.

II. 

Country Context and Recent Developments

Overall Context

2.1. 
Since the election of President Khatami in 1997, Iran has been undergoing a
significant evolution, both internally and in its external relations. On the domestic side,
Iran enters the new century with a difficult, but most animated debate about its future
based on continuing progress in granting a greater role to civil society and the prevalence
of the rule of law. The municipal elections held in 1999, which brought elected
representation to the lowest levels of government, was a significant milestone. On the
international side, Iran's foreign policy based on d6tente and President's Khatami
"dialogue among civilizations" is helping Iran out of its isolation with improved relations
within the region and with Europe, Japan, and the rest of the world. These developments,
if sustained, could open significant prospects for the future economic integration of Iran
with the world economy.

2.2. 
The Iranian institutional system is comprised of a popularly-elected President
and Parliament (Majlis), functioning under the guidance of spiritual leader Ayatollah
Khamenei. President Khatami was elected by a large majority in 1997 on a broad
platform of reforms. In his election platform, President Khatami has emphasized the need

- 3 -

for political and institutional reform based on greater involvement of civil society. His
election platform also emphasized the promotion of transparency and the rule of law as
guiding principles for the Iranian government. A number of measures were taken to
increase personal liberties, including greater freedom of the press. From 1988 to 1998,
1,222 newspapers and periodicals received licenses for publication, out of which 565
licenses were issued from 1996 to 1998. At the same time, there have also been periodic
reversals with the closing of newspapers, trial of journalists, and blockage of press reform
code legislation.

Exective

2.5. 
On the international side, Iran's current approach to foreign relations, based on
President Khatami's "dialogue among civilizations," opens an era of detente and greater
openness to the outside world. Iran's relationship with its neighbors in the region, and
with the European Union countries and Japan has significantly improved recently, with
full diplomatic and commercial relations re-established. Progress in external relations has
already benefited Iran's attempt to secure foreign investment. Over the past four years,

- 4 -

several oil and gas companies have renewed investment in Iran, and a pipeline of new
investments is under discussion.

Social Context

2.6. 
Since the 1979 Revolution, Iran has given strong and special emphasis to human
development, social protection, and "social justice," with significant progress to-date. As
a result of major investments in the social sectors over the last 20 years with virtually
universal education and extensive health coverage, and an active Government distributive
strategy through direct transfers and indirect subsidies, the proportion of the population
living under the poverty line has fallen significantly from 47% in 1978 to 15.5% now.
Virtually all social indicators have shown improvement to the point where Iran now ranks
at or near the top of comparable countries (Table 1). Of particular note is the closing of
the gender gap in education, where enrollment rates for boys and girls show only small
differences, in literacy, and in political representation (see Graph 1).

* The drop in the rate of enrollment could be explained by the increase in private schooling.

The statistics on enrollment capture only attendees of public schools.

2.7. 
Notwithstanding these achievements, Iran still faces three major challenges: (i)
it still has a significant prevalence of poverty; (ii) it has dealt with poverty more through
handouts and charitable transfers than through employment and empowerment; and (iii)
while these explicit subsidies and transfers have the merit of reaching the poor, Iran also
maintains, often in the name of the poor, an expensive and excessively large implicit
subsidy system that is untargeted and distortionary.

2.8. 
A poverty study undertaken by the Government established a strong linkage
between poverty and unemployment: 37% of poor households in the poorest first decile
have no one working, and 45% of them have just one working person. This characteristic

- 5 -

underscores the high positive impact that growth and productive employment could have
on poverty reduction.

2.9. 
Iran has an extensive social safety net and transfer system that reaches a large
number of the poor. Half of the poor, about 4.5 million persons or 1.47 million
households, benefit from social coverage by government social safety net programs,
charity institutions, and other non-profit organizations. These programs include direct
cash transfers, housing provision, education scholarships, and health and social security
coverage. In particular, targeting and reaching the poor is made possible in Iran through
the network of mosques, and other non-governmental institutions. The country has also
accumulated a rich experience of rationing during the long war with Iraq. Most of the
beneficiaries have access to bank accounts through which regular direct cash transfers are
made.

2.10. While the above cash and other direct transfer support is effective in reaching
the poor, Iran also maintains extensive implicit subsidies, including energy subsidies,
exchange rate subsidies, and credit subsidies, that are excessively large (the energy
subsidy alone is estimated at more than 12% of GDP), but are untargeted and ineffective.
While the maintenance of these subsidies is often justified in the name of the needy, they
do not proportionately benefit the poor. In fact a large part of the subsidy system,
including those directed to basic needs such as bread and medicine, are highly untargeted
vis-a-vis the poor (Table 2). The total benefit from the bread, medicine, gas and kerosene
subsidies, for example, that goes to the richest decile is twice, four times, thirty two
times, and three and a half times, respectively that going to the poorest decile, reflecting
both the extent of waste and inefficient targeting of these subsidies.

Economic Context

2.11. A stabilizing macroeconomic situation: After a long period of instability and
large external and internal imbalances that reflected Iran's economic structural problems,
its external difficulties, and its limited access to external financing, the macroeconomic
situation has recently improved significantly. During 1999-2000 the budget registered a
surplus of 1% of GDP, up from a deficit of 6.7% in the previous year. A budget surplus
of 12.6% of GDP is estimated for the Iranian year 2000-01 which has ended in March 20,
2001. The budget surplus (equivalent to $8 billion at the TSE rate) has been allocated to
the newly created Oil Stabilization Fund. The balance of payments difficulties that have
marked most of the past decade have eased. A current account surplus of 4.3% of GDP
was registered in 1999-2000, and a surplus of about 14% of GDP is estimated for the
Iranian year 2000-2,001, driven by a trade surplus of $14 billion-one of the largest ever.
Foreign exchange reserves are building up to more than 10 months of imports. Inflation
fell to under 20%, a level it held over the past two years. Progress in reducing inflation in
the near future will, however, remain limited because of ongoing liberalization efforts,
the scaling down of subsidies, and the process of unification of the exchange regime.

2.12. While the rebound in oil prices, and to a certain extent the start of
implementation of reforms (see para. 3.6) contributed greatly to these positive
developments, the progress toward macroeconomic stability is being strengthened
through higher commitment to fiscal responsibility and by the significant fall in the debt
stock and debt services. Fiscal sustainability, indeed, is being strengthened by the
institution of the newly created Oil Stabilization Fund and the commitment of the
Government under the FYDP to a balanced budget stance based on prudent projections
of oil prices and revenues' over the period of the Plan. The fiscal situation is further
strengthened by the sharp tailing off of Iran's external debt profile. The annual total debt
service (including short term debt services) has fallen to US$6.9 billion at the end of the
2000-01 Iranian year, down from an average of about US$11.5 billion during the last 4

l Projected foreign- exchange revenues from oil exports in US$ billion by the FYDP which are used as a
basis for the balanced budget for the Iranian years 2000/1 to 2004/5 are: 11.09; 10.86; 11.05; 11.57; and
12.08 respectively, corresponding to price levels of between US$15-17 per barrel.

- 7 -

years. It is projected to decrease to US$5 billion thereafter. The debt stock is also sharply
reduced, and has fallen to about US$8.4 billion at the end of the 2000-2001 Iranian fiscal
year, down from US$22 billion in 1995-96 (Graphs 2 and 3). The end of the debt-crisis,
which has dominated much of the economic scene in the last few years, is an important
development for the Iranian economy. It opens the prospects for a more stable and
sustainable macroeconomic position in the future, and provides a solid footing for the
start of the program of structural reforms envisaged in Iran's Third Five-Year
Development Plan (FYDP).

2.13. Despite improvement in macroeconomic stability, Iran faces the major
challenge of accelerating growth rates. During the past five years, growth has averaged a
mere 3% per annum (see Graph 4), which is too low to secure sufficient jobs for the more
than 700,000 additional job seekers that come to the job market annually, not to mention
the stock of unemployment (Q6%). Despite the significant accomplishment in bringing
population growth to 1.4%, the labor force is still growing at 4.5% per annum because of
the relatively young population. Iran needs to secure a GDP growth rate even higher than
the 6% rate targeted in the current Plan.

Box 2. The "Bonyad" Foundations in Iran
Iran's post-revolution public sector includes a number of organizations in the form of semi-public

foundafions called "Bonyad". Established in the late 1979 after the Revolution, they operate as holdings of

companies of the former Pahlavi Fowndation and other confiscated assets. Some of these foundations are
heavily involved in a variety of economic activities and are the most important channel of carrying out
Iran's large social assistance programs. In addition to their own resources that they derive from their
economic activities, they finance their social activities from the refund of their own taxes, which are held in
special accounts at the Treasury and don't channel through the budget, and from charitable contributions.
Some of them, such as Komiteh Emdad (see below) receive most of their funding directly from the budget
and are the main implementation institution of the Government social coverage program.

Our information on the size, stucture and funtioning of the Bonyads is limited, but critics of these
institutions in the private sector generally raise the issues of their extra-economic quWsi-monopolistic
power, and the fact they enjoy wide ranging tax and customs privileges, preferential access to credit and

foreign exchange allocation, as well as regulatory protection from private sector competition. Efficiency.
transparency, and good coordination between the different Bonyads in the provision of social assistance
function are recognized also as critical to the success of the Government's new poverty reduction strategy.
Within the framework of the FYDP, the Government intends to un*y the administration system of the
whole social program under the Management and Plan Organization.
Among these Bonyads, the following are of special significance due to their share in economic
activities (Baonyad Mostazafan) and the extent of their social involvement (Komiteh Inidad).

is estimated at about US$1.5 billion. BMJ has a large social assistance program including financial

assistance to more than 120,000 families of war veteran and families of martyrs, 

and covers pensions, free

health and education services and housing to large segments of the poor. Financing of the social activities is
ensured by own profit and refunded taxes which are held in a special account at the Treasury.
Komiteh Emdad Emm Khomeini (KE). While its involvement in economic activities and own
assets are less important than those of Xt BMJ, KE is the most active Bonyad in social safety net provision.
It provides assistance to about 4 million people, or 80% of the poor who benefit from social assistance, and
provides educational support to 600,000 students. It also provides international support and relief assistance
to other countries. The Komitch's financing resources come essentially from the Government budget and
the rest from its own resources and charitable contributions.
Other Bonyads, include: 
(the Martyr Foundation) providing support for the martyrs'
d 

families as well as disabled. The foundation owns several companies in agriculture, mining, construction

and trade. &ayqd Ma 
(the Housing Foundation), set up in June 1979 to house the poor especially in
rural areas. Financial resources come from private resources, the government developrnent budget for rural
housing, and borrowing from the banking system.

2.14. 
Impediments to achieving growth: Achievement of rapid economic growth is
constrained by a multitude of distortions that have accumulated over the past two decades
of great disruptions and uncertainties, marked by the Revolution, the long and destructive
war with Iraq, and the difficult international relations situation that impeded the country's
normal access to international capital and goods. The prolonged heavy interventionist

- 10-

framework of economic management during the war and after, led to the buildup of a
complex distortionary pricing system, with multiple foreign exchange rates, quantitative
trade restrictions and distorted tariffs, and large subsidies of energy products. It also led
to the development of a large public enterprise sector, dominating up to 60% of the
manufacturing sector, and large quasi-public Bonyads (see Box 2) -the 
latter combine
production, commercial, and social protection functions with little transparency. The
Bonyads also enjoy extra-economic power that adds to the other institutional and legal
impediments to the development of private activities. The financial sector is also
controlled by the state and most of the credit is administratively directed through the
public banks (there are no private banks). The outcome has been a prolonged economic
stagnation, during which time GDP per capita fell and, in spite of its slow recovery
(mostly due to a steep drop in population growth), has yet to regain its pre-revolution
level (see Graphs 4-5).

2.15. 
Shifting from a "distribution-before-growth" development approach to a
"distribution-with-growth" approach: To fulfill the promise of the Revolution in
promoting social justice, Iran has followed a "distribution-before-growth" development
approach. Indeed, while growth has stagnated and per capita GDP has declined since the
Revolution, social indicators have improved significantly. This paradox of improvement
in social conditions with declining growth is explained by the very active Government
role in important direct transfers, explicit subsidies of essential goods, and a strong
human resources development program (universal access to education and health
combined with successful population growth control), and also through large, but
untargeted, implicit consumption subsidies2 . This transfer program, while reducing
poverty, has started reaching its limit. The shift of public resources to consumption at the
expense of production limited growth and thus job creation for the growing number of
young people entering the labor force. Growth was also hampered by over expansionary
fiscal spending that generated macroeconomic crisis, as was the case during the First Plan
(see paras. 2.17). A major challenge of Iran's transition will be to find the appropriate
mechanisms to move away from the large untargeted subsidies to more targeted subsidies
for the genuinely poor, and to channel the resulting public savings to augment private
savings in financing private sector investment to generate productive employment and a
sustainable growth with social justice. This re-orientation of the economy will also need
to be accompanied by a redefinition of the role of the government to core areas, leaving
productive activities in the hands of the private sector.

2.16. 
Past failed attempts to reform: The Iranian authorities recognize the need for
structural reforms in the economy and have attempted to address these as early as the
country's first FYDP (1990-95). These attempts, however, proved unsuccessful because
of lack of resolve in the pursuit of reforms, Iran's external isolation and its limited access
to adequate foreign financing on longer terms. These factors, combined with Iran's
external vulnerability to oil shocks, led to major macroeconomic imbalances. During the
period of the second FYDP, a continuously adverse external environment-including a
tight debt repayment schedule, low oil prices, and continued external embargo-lirnited

2 Expliciting energy subsidies, exchange rate, credit and other subsidies would add about 20% of GDP to
the reported total budget size, as measured by total expenditure, ranging about 26% of GDP.

- 11 -

Iran's ability to stabilize its economy and to pursue aggressively the economic reform
agenda of the election platform of President Khatami.

2.17. 
First Five Year Development Plan (1990-95): The first attempt at reform
started after the war with Iraq and within the framework of the First FYDP covering the
period 1990-95. Iran embarked on a large infrastructure reconstruction program with total
investment ranging from 30 to 35% of GDP. During this period, Iran also pursued an
aggressive agenda of economic policy reform, including decontrolling domestic prices,
removing many trade restrictions, liberalizing the foreign exchange system, and initiating
a privatization program of public enterprises. These policies, along with the
reconstruction program and an expansionary fiscal policy in support of an ambitious
social program, resulted in an impressive 7% average annual growth during the Plan
period, and a significant improvement in social indicators, which put Iran in the forefront
of best performers of its income category, and of the MENA region. This over-
expansionary fiscal stance, however, resulted in large macro imbalances. Given Iran's
limited access to longer-term external financing, the large current account deficit was
reflected in a surge in short-term debt and excessive drawing on foreign exchange
reserves. In 1994, when the bunching of short-term debt coincided with lower than
expected oil prices, an external payments crisis emerged. Large payment arrears led to a
series of reversals of the policy reforms undertaken, including the reinstitution of
multiple exchange rates, and the halting of the privatization process as the unemployment
and social situation worsened.

2.18. 
Second Five Year Development Plan (1995-2000): During the Second FYDP,
the economy entered into a "muddle through" phase with growth stagnating at an average
of 3% per annum, below the projected 5.1% in the Plan. In addition to the structural
impediments, growth was mostly constrained by the excessive compression of imports
(reaching up to 50% in some years) needed to make room for external debt repayments as
Iran's access to external financing remained restricted. Management of the unstable
macroeconomic situation left little leeway to address the structural reform issues.
Macroeconomic instability was further heightened with the extension and intensification
of external economic and financial sanctions on Iran. This dampened expectations and
triggered a run on foreign exchange and consumption goods markets that induced a sharp
depreciation of about 50% of the free exchange rate to Rls 6,200 per U.S. dollar, and a
surge in consumer prices by 14% during April/May 1996, bringing inflation for the year
to 49%. In yet another attempt to control the foreign exchange crisis, the authorities
raised to 100% the export repatriation and surrender requirement, and ordered all foreign
exchange transactions to go through the banking system, effectively ending the non-bank
foreign exchange market. During the subsequent years of the Plan, the bunching of
repayments of the rescheduled debt was again exacerbated by a sharp drop in oil prices in
1998/99, inducing a second external payment crisis and leading to another bilateral
rescheduling. The collapse in oil revenues also led to a fiscal deficit of 6.7% of GDP in
1998/99 in spite of drastic cuts in capital expenditures and delays in implementation of
public investment projects. Table 3 summarizes the key economic indicators for the
1991-2000 period.

Country Development Priorities and Progress

3.1 
Iran's current development priorities and approach are outlined in the Third
FYDP (2001-2005) approved by the Parliament last year. The Plan aims at a growth rate
of 6% per annum during the Plan period. At the same time, the Plan continues the strong
emphasis of the past on social development and equity. To achieve its objectives of
raising economic growth potential, increasing the living standards of the population, and
reducing unemployment, the Plan envisages a wide range of structural reforms aiming at
a balanced and gradual transition to a market economy. While greater private investment
is expected to provide the basis for more rapid growth, the Plan gives special emphasis to
agricultural and rural development, and housing as the key sectors underpinning the
growth with distribution objectives. Both of these sectors have not only potential for
growth but also for job creation and poverty alleviation given their higher labor-intensity,
in particular of unskilled and poor workers.3 The Plan also gives particular priority to the
environment, including managing air and water pollution and the preservation of natural
resources. These aspects are discussed below.

Economic Reform Agenda

3.2 
The economic reform strategy is based on a two-pronged approach aimed at
developing a competitive functioning of the economy by taking steps toward liberalizing
the pricing system, and shifting toward a market-based price determination as a means
toward more efficient allocation of resources. Secondly, the strategy involves the
undertaking of legal and institutional reforms to enable the development of private sector
participation concomitant with public enterprise sector reform and privatization, as well
as reform of the financial sector.

3.3 
The reform of the pricing system includes: (i) the unification of the multiple
exchange rate system and movement toward market determination of the exchange rate;
(ii) trade liberalization, consisting of the narrowing of the large non-tariff barriers, and
the streamlining of tariffs; (iii) moving away from the system of administratively
determined credit allocation and real negative interest rates, toward competitive
allocation of credit, and positive interest rates; and (iv) addressing the issue of the large
energy subsidies.

3.4 
The other set of structural reforms in support of the development of a private
sector-based development includes: (i) strengthening the legal and 
institutional
framework, in particular the reform of the previously constraining legal framework of
foreign direct investment, and the enactment of laws, regulations and institutional
arrangements to limit monopolistic and unfair trade practices, and the opening of all
economic activities to the private sector; (ii) reducing the size of the public enterprise
sector through privatization and public enterprise reform; (iii) starting the reform of the
state-dominated financial sector, strengthening banking regulation and supervision, and
opening the way to the emergence of private banking; and (iv) strengthening of
mechanisms of social protection to limit the negative transitory effects of the reforms.

3 Our analytical knowledge of the sources of growth and the sectoral potential for growth and distribution
are very limited at this stage. AAA work is planned to fill this gap.

- 14-

3.5 
Iran's economic reform strategy is based on a gradualist approach given the
complexity of the reform process and the need to avoid undue social disruption. The
magnitude and inter-locking nature of the various distortions require a careful sequencing
of the reform measures. Nevertheless, the Government is committed to the full reform
agenda of the Third FYDP and has already made good progress in the first year (which
began in March 2000) as indicated below:

3.6 
Recent progress in reform implementation: Significant progress has been
realized over the first year of the Third FYDP in several economic reforn areas:

-

-

-

Foreign exchange reform: The exchange rate system was further rationalized
with the abolition of the export exchange rate, reducing the multiple exchange
rate system to two rates: the Tehran Stock Exchange (TSE) rate, currently at
about Rls8,000/US$, which approximates market rates and under which all
private and a large part of public sector foreign exchange transactions are
conducted; and an official exchange rate of Rlsl,750/US$ now used for certain
limited public sector transactions (debt payments, imports of essential goods
such as pharmaceuticals, some capital and defense goods). Steps are now being
taken to move to an inter-bank market of foreign exchange. Distinction between
"locally" and "internationally"-sourced foreign exchange for legitimate current
account transactions will be abolished during 2001-2002. A commission has
been constituted to evaluate economic and social impacts of total unification of
the exchai ge rate system, and to formulate a strategy to address its economic
and social effects. Full unification is scheduled to happen within the current
Iranian fiscal year 2001-02. Indeed, the budget law for the current year
stipulates that the next budget (March 21, 2002- March 20, 2003) shall be
prepared on the basis of a unified exchange rate.

Trade reforms: The strategy of the Government is to: (i) remove all non-tariff
barriers (NTBs) and replace them with tariffs; (ii) progressively reduce the tariff
bands over the period of the Third FYDP; while (iii) progressively reducing the
average tariff rate to a level that allows Iran to engage in WTO negotiations.
Until March, 2000, out of 5,113 HS product codes, there were only 1,900
products free of restrictive licensing. During the first six months of the Iranian
year 2000-01, 895 additional new products have been freed from licensing. An
additional list of more than 2,000 new codes under import licensing to be
converted into tariffs has been presented to the Parliament. It is expected that by
the end of next Iranian year, Iran will complete the tariffication of all NTBs and
move from a positive list-based import control system to a small negative list.
The authorities are also actively preparing for a WTO accession request.

Energy price adjustment: Energy border prices are 4 to 5 times higher on
average than domestic prices and subsidies are estimated at more than 12% of
GDP. Energy price adjustments, however, have proven to be highly sensitive
politically given their high and wide-spread impact on the population, and the
fears about ripple through effects in the economy. Proposals for price
adjustment were presented to the Majlis last year, but were rejected on these
grounds. The draft budget for next year currently being discussed stipulates a

- 15-

modest increase of 15% for gasoline, kerosene, and gas prices. However, a
committee has been set up to evaluate the effects of alternative adjustment
strategies and develop compensating strategies to cushion the effect of energy
price adjustment. Energy price adjustment will remain a critical step to the
credibility of the reforms and their feasibility, not only because it removes a
major source of resource allocation distortion in itself, but also because it would
provide a critical source of financing of the economic and social costs of the
overall reform process.

Privatization: Since the announcement of the privatization program in the Plan,
a new privatization agency has been set up in the Ministry of Finance. The
Majlis has promulgated regulations governing privatization. The Privatization
committee, under the supervision of the President, has reviewed 1,039 public
sector enterprises for privatization: 217 are to remain public, 87 will be
liquidated, and 735 are slated for privatization. During the first half of the year
2000-01, the Government sold Rls2,040 billion (about 0.5% of GDP) equivalent
of shares of public enterprises in the TSE. It has ceded to workers RlslO0 billion
worth of shares. Rls1,800 billion worth of shares are being put to sale for the
next fiscal year. In the oil sector, the Oil Ministry announced that it will cede 23
firms of its subsidiaries to the private sector over the FYDP. These include the
National Iranian Tanker Company and the liquefied gas distribution centers.

Financial Sector Reform: Significant policy changes are planned, or already
under way, in the financial sector. This sector has been dominated by wholly
government-owned banking entities, operating within a 
restrictive
administrative regime and behind strict exchange controls. However, the
Government envisages greater private role in the future. Already several private
credit institutions, albeit very small, have been licensed in the last few years and
a reinterpretation of the banking constitutional legislation is opening the way to
the licensing of private domestic banks (two are expected within the current
Iranian fiscal year.) Also, legislation permitting the establishment of foreign-
owned banks in off-shore free trade zones has been enacted. However, it will
be some time before private banking and quasi-banking operations develop into
viable alternative provider of financial services, particularly given the lack of
consensus on the appropriate role of the state in the financial sector.
Meanwhile, the state owned banks can be expected to continue to be the
dominant players, and for these, greater freedom in credit allocation and pricing
is envisaged, while at the same time prudential regulation and supervision is
being strengthened. Non-bank finance is also being enhanced, and the Tehran
stock exchange has re-emerged as a significant and active entity. There remain
challenging issues of adapting international regulatory practice to the all-Islamic
financial practice of Iran and, more widely, ensuring that the financial system
can deliver the services necessary to strengthen the productivity and
international competitiveness of the non-oil sector. Following the recent joint
Bank-Fund assessment of the Iran's financial sector as part of the FSAP
program, both institutions have been providing technical assistance in support of
what will need to be a sustained effort over several years for the development of
Iran's financial system.

- 16-

Foreign Direct Investment: Encouraging foreign direct investment in both the
oil and non-oil sectors is one of the pillars of economic revival in the Third
FYDP. A new FDI Act is now before the Parliament and is expected to be
approved shortly. Over the past 5 years, Iran was able to attract some $10
billion in private investment in the oil sector using a buy-back formula as a way
to bypass restrictions by the Constitution on ownership of natural resources by
foreigners-an amount judged far below what is needed to meet Iran's
ambitious plans to develop its oil and gas production. Other new options are
now being debated, including enhanced buy-backs with long-term agreements
and more incentives; joint ventures between foreign and Iranian oil and gas
companies are also being considered.

The Social Agenda

3.7 
As reported above, Iran's social indicators improved substantially since the
Revolution, but these achievements also present weaknesses that challenge their
sustainability. Progress in social welfare and human capital development has yet to be
supported by growth and matched by productive opportunities, and the system of social
support remains based more on handouts and charitable transfers than on empowerment
and employment. The Third FYDP correctly recognizes these weaknesses and presents a
two-pronged strategy to fight poverty based on employment creation for those who are
able to work, and a more efficient and targeted social safety net to support the rest of the
poor.

3.8 
Empowerment-based poverty reduction: The Plan targets an ambitious
reduction of the poverty headcount from 15% to 7% at the end of the plan period.
Because of the established direct link between poverty and employment in Iran, this
should be realized through an annual creation of 765,000 jobs, corresponding to a
decrease in the rate of unemployment from 16% at its starting year to 12.5% at the end of
the Plan. The Plan presents a sectoral approach to promoting employment and reducing
poverty. It envisages higher support to the agricultural sector through higher public
investment in the water management and other productivity enhancing investment, and
support to small development activities such as fisheries, animal raising, and forestry. In
mining and industry, the strategy includes support to small and medium enterprises
through special incentives to investment in under-served regions. In the housing sector,
tax and credit incentives are provided to promote low-income housing construction, that
would benefit the poor directly and indirectly (through employment creation).

3.9 
Improvements in education and health are envisaged in the Plan as direct
mechanisms for poverty alleviation through empowerment. In education, the Plan
emphasizes education as a means to fight poverty, as indicated by the linkages between
educational attainment and literacy, and poverty. It envisages upgrading the quality of the
educational system at all levels, and improving its effectiveness in terms of a better
alignment with the needs of the economy and the labor market. It also envisages
reforming education curricula, and developing appropriate programs of vocational
training. In health, while Iran has a well performing basic health system and good health
indicators, it still has a high rate of childhood malnutrition. The Plan emphasizes the need

- 17-

to address these deficiencies in health by developing a nation-wide nutritional education
program, and improving geographical coverage of basic health services. The Government
intends also to give particular importance to improving the efficiency of the health
system and the quality of services at all levels, and to undertake the reform of its pension
system.

3.10 
Improving the efficiency of the Social Safety Net: The second prong of the
Government poverty reduction program concerns those who are disabled and those who
can not work. The plan envisages improvements in the efficiency of transfers through
better targeting, improving the poverty map, and enhancing the coordination between the
various social safety net institutions, including the Bonyads, by bringing them under the
administrative control of Management and Plan Organization. A comprehensive review
of the different institutions and the existing targeting mechanisms is underway.

3.11 
Addressing the social costs of reforms: While the Plan provides important
elements of the social safety net, it does not address explicitly how these mechanisms can
be used to mitigate the adverse effects of economic reforms. Rationalization of subsidies,
particularly the extensive energy subsidies, as well as privatization will require
commensurate measures such as worker training, cash compensation, short-term
employment creation, etc. The absence of a clearly articulated social protection strategy
could act as a barrier to implementation of the reforms. The Bank plans to work with the
Government in preparing a social assessment of the reform program in terms of its impact
on the different income groups, and articulating a social protection strategy which builds
on the various Plan initiatives.

Environmental and Water Resource Management Agenda

3.12 
The environment agenda has been elevated as one of the highest priorities of the
Iranian Government. Environment affairs are handled at a vice presidential level. An
Environmental High Council reporting to the President includes two Vice Presidents,

- 18 -

10 cabinet Ministers and the Attorney General. Iran indeed has severe environmental
problems-urban, rural, and coastal-that have reached critical levels.

3.13 
On the urban environment side, Iran has a very underdeveloped sewerage
sector. Adequate waste water collection and disposal systems exist only in Isfahan,
covering a population of one million, and to a limited extent in Tehran. The dominant use
of absorption wells is contributing to ground and surface water pollution through
infiltration or overflowing, and presents serious health risks. The Government recognizes
the backwardness of the sector and the Plan proposes an ambitious program to upgrade
the system in all urban areas over the next 20 years. Key policy and institutional
measures adopted include the introduction of pricing policies of water supply and
wastewater services to achieve efficient tariffs based on full recovery of O&M costs and
capital expenditures, and the promotion of private sector participation in the sector. The
increasing volume of toxic industrial effluents also constitutes a significant urban
environmental concern for Iran, and figures in the action plan of the Government. The
Tehran Sewerage Project approved last year represents the first major initiative consistent
with the thrust of the Plan.

3.14 
Air pollution also poses a major urban environmental concern. It is estimated
that more than 5 million tons of pollutants are released per year into Iran's atmosphere,
65% of which comes from motor vehicles. Heavily subsidized energy prices are widely
understood to be a major contributing factor. Air pollution in Tehran and other major
cities, especially from motor vehicles, exceeds by far the standards set by the WHO and
poses serious health problems. There are occasions when schools are closed in Tehran
because of the high level of air pollution. The authorities are developing a comprehensive
action plan to deal with the aggravation of the air pollution problem, including a review
of the energy subsidies, improving regulations of gas emissions, levying fines for non-
compliance and tax-deductible expenses for industries, and encouraging the relocation of
industrial enterprises outside cities boundaries.

3.15 Major environmental issues in the rural areas identified by the Government
pertain to inefficient irrigation systems caused by excessive groundwater extraction that
threatens both water quantity and quality; high conveyance and distribution losses of
surface water due to inefficiency of the irrigation network, and low on-farm irrigation
efficiency; severe soil erosion and land degradation due to lack of integrated river basin
water management, over-cultivation of marginal land, and unsustainability of high
carrying capacity of range and pasture, and deforestation.

3.16 
The FYDP targets increasing water availability for agriculture by around 9%
and expanding the irrigated areas by about 30%. Achieving these targets will involve
decentralization, a decline in the role of Government, and an effective involvement of
Water User Groups (WUGs) in water resource management; optimum exploitation of
border rivers and common water resources to reduce the pressure on groundwater
extraction; and encouraging the establishment of cooperatives with expected increases
from 700 to 1,700.

- 19 -

Governance and Transparency Agenda

3.17 
President Khatami, since assuming office in 1997, has advocated the need for
political and institutional reforms that increase transparency based on strengthening the
rule of law, and giving greater involvement of the civil society as a means to ensuring
sustained pressure towards accountability of the system. Some specific measures that
have been taken in the past few years include:

-

-

-

Granting much more freedom to the press, which would ultimately contribute to
a more open and critical examination of government policy, fuller
representation of public opinion and the viewpoints of civil society. Iran today
has a flourishing press, with different political leanings. Out of a total of 1,222
newspapers and periodicals that received licenses for publication from 1988-98,
565 licenses were issued from 1996 to 1998 alone.

Reforming the budget nomenclature, process, and control mechanisms and
institutions so as to ensure greater transparency and efficiency in public
expenditures. A council for administrative reform headed by the President has
also been created with the objective of fostering transparent management at all
levels of the administration.

The Third FYDP covers also a series of measures to regulate monopolies and
promote competitive economic activities, which should enhance wider
transparency and limit the opportunities for corruption.

3.18 
Despite these significant measures, there is the continuing struggle between
opposing factions with strongly differing views on the direction and speed of reforms.
Periodic set-backs are, therefore, to be expected.

IV. 

Interim World Bank Group Support Strategy: FY2002-03

Past World Bank Activities

4.1 
Iran was an active borrower of the World Bank until the oil windfall of the early
1970's, when the financial assistance from the World Bank was phased out. Up until
FY76, Iran had borrowed from the World Bank a little over US$1 billion. Lending
resumed in 1991, after incomes had declined following the long war with Iraq, and the
Government embarked on a large reconstruction program, including a program of
economic reforms within the First FYDP. From 1990-93, the World Bank made six loans
totaling $843 million. In May 2000 the Executive Directors approved two new loans -
the Second Primary Health and Nutrition Project and the Tehran Sewerage Project.
World Bank activities in the last few years in the absence of new lending focused mainly
on the supervision of the portfolio and some limited economic and sector work. The Bank
also supported capacity building through technical assistance funded from IDF grants for
debt management, banking supervision, foreign investment promotion, and the
introduction of VAT. IFC and MIGA were not active in this period, although MIGA
(through FIAS) assisted the Government in implementing the IDF grant for foreign
investment promotion.

- 20-

Interim World Bank Group Support

4.2 
Iran is a large country that is emerging from a long process of international
isolation and economic embargo that limited its normal access to long-term financing
opportunities for its development needs. To achieve the plan's objectives of 6% growth
and the creation of 765,000 jobs per year, an estimated 7% annual growth of investment
is required. The needs for external financing are estimated at around US$7-10 billion for
the Plan period. The lending and non-lending support from the Bank would thus be
important and have a significant payoff for the country in this transition phase. In
addition, the authorities see the World Bank playing an important role in supporting
Iran's new policy and effort to improve its relations with the international financial
community and to attract foreign investment. For FY 2002-03, the Bank lending program
could amount to up to $755 million.

4.3 
The economic and social reform agenda of the Government as outlined in the
Third FYDP, addresses the right issues to move the economy forward. The announced
social strategy emphasizing employment over direct assistance, improving efficiency,
transparency and effectiveness of existing programs, and unifying the institutions that are
responsible for the delivery of the social program, represents a change in the right
direction. On the economic side, the Third FYDP addresses many aspects of the
prevailing structural problems of the Iranian economy, in particular the reform of some
elements of the pricing system distortions and the reform of public enterprises and the
financial sector. Implementation difficulties, however, cannot be understated because of
institutional, managerial and technical constraints, as well as the as yet unclear political
consensus. Nevertheless, the current environment is the most favorable for reforms the
policy makers have faced in some time. Iran's substantial drop in indebtedness and
improved fiscal situation, constitute new favorable developments underpinning a more
stable macroeconomic environment, providing room for maneuver that was previously
not available. The Government can now focus more on the longer-term reforms and shift
away from the crisis management mode that prevailed during the two previous plans. A
good start has already been made in reform implementation during the first year of the
third FYDP (see para. 3.6) which created a momentum. Bank support, through non-
lending services and targeted lending for basic needs, would assist the Govemment to
implement its reform program.

4.4 
In support of the Government's reform efforts, the Bank will intensify economic
and sector work covering the main reform areas, and provide support for capacity
building in the formulation of economic and sector policies, their sequencing, and
implementation. This non-lending support will also be useful in the preparation of the full
CAS. A series of economic studies is either underway or planned over the next two years
to provide the basis for providing fruitful policy dialogue and policy analysis and prepare
the CAS. These include a study on the reform of the energy pricing system (already
finalized); a Trade and Foreign Exchange System reform study (at an advanced stage); a
planned Public Expenditure Review including a Country Procurement Assessment
Report, and a Country Financial Accountability Assessment; a Country Economic
Memorandum providing analysis of the medium term framework for the economic
transition and the sequencing of reforms; an evaluation of the costs of reforms and how to

- 21 -

address them; as well as other major sectoral studies, including a Water Management
Policy Review note, and sectoral strategy notes on housing, agriculture, air pollution
control, and others (see Table. 5)

4.5 
On the lending side of our assistance, given the size and needs of the country,
and its creditworthiness, Bank lending volume could gradually increase to significant
levels. But with the much reduced Bank activities in the last 7 years and the resultant
deficit in economic work and sectoral knowledge, which has to be quickly made up for,
the Bank Group would follow a transitional assistance strategy which can, over time, lead
to a fuller involvement in 2-3 years.

4.6 
Lending during this transitory short period, as specified below, will focus
mainly on priority areas such identified as low income housing, sewerage, urban
upgrading, and community-based infrastructure and employment creation schemes for the
poor. These are areas that are least constrained by policy distortions being addressed, are
most resilient to potential country's economic and social risks and, at the same time, have
a quick impact on improving the situation of the poor and the environment and enhance
resource management. Lending will also be directed to technical assistance in support to
the structural reform program. The Bank will continually assess the lending program on
the basis of progress in macroeconomic performance and policy outcomes and project
implementation in the areas identified as a priority for Bank involvement. IFC and the
World Bank Institute will combine efforts in support of this transition program. As
mentioned earlier, a full CAS will be developed within the next two years, as sufficient
progress is being achieved in our dialogue with the Government and stakeholders at
large, and also in key areas of policy reform.

Support for Reforms and Economic Management

4.7 
Bank Group support for economic reforms will include four areas: (i) analytical
and advisory work to provide an underpinning for the reforms; (ii) lending for technical
assistance; (iii) capacity building and training by WBI, and (iv) IFC support for the
private sector.

4.8 
Analytical and Advisory Services are envisaged in the areas of: reform of the
pricing system and its economic and social implications; trade and tariff reform strategy;
privatization of public enterprises; financial sector reform and institutional development;
and sequencing of the reform agenda. A study of the social safety net indicated earlier
will provide a strategy for ameliorating any adverse social implications of the reforms.

4.9 
The Government expressed the need for technical assistance in several areas,
including the development of financial sector institutions, and support for the
privatization program. A small Technical Assistance Loan will be provided to address
these needs.

4.10 
The World Bank Institute has provided some assistance in the past two years,
in particular in the trade area, and within the framework of the Mediterranean
Development Forum (MDF), which has been greatly valued by the Iranian authorities.
There is need for further assistance in training in several areas, in particular in trade

- 22 -

reform and WTO accession, governance, infrastructure finance, project management
skills, and macroeconomic training.

4.11 
IFC Support will complement the Bank's analytical and technical assistance
activities in support of private sector development. IFC will assist in mobilizing foreign
direct investment in specific sectors which are open to private/foreign investment as a
result of the reform process. Most sectors of the economy have been affected by more
than two decades of domestic distortions and external embargoes. While the oil, gas, and
petrochemicals sectors continued to benefit from some foreign investment, other sectors
have fallen behind. As a priority, IEFC's initial support will focus on the financial sector,
particularly as it supports small and medium enterprise development as a pillar in the
employment creation strategy of the Government. As policy constraints are removed and
reforms progress, support would be extended progressively to other projects which are
export-oriented, and where Iran has a comparative advantage.

4.12 
Iran's private sector, while small, has limited access to financing. State-owned
banks control the financial sector and credit allocation benefits non-competitive state-
owned enterprises. Furthermore, a limited range of financial instruments is available to
the domestic private sector. As a first step, IFC proposes to support the development of
leasing institutions. Leasing, indeed, could be effective in supporting the development of
SMEs, and IFC has considerable experience worldwide. Thereafter, EFC's focus in the
financial sector would eventually include support for formation of banks in the private
sector, trade finance, and the development of capital markets. IFC will provide, as
needed, advisory services to support any initiative in privatization of state-owned banks.

4.13 
IFC's short to medium-term focus would expand to investments in companies
with strong foreign partners to promote the transfer and upgrading of technology in Iran,
which is needed after years of sanctions. IFC also proposes investing in those industries
where Iran has a comparative advantage, or which are export-oriented. These include
manufacturing, and services, including development of business hotels with international
operators to develop the business travel market, which would grow as the climate for
foreign investment improves.

Support for the Social Protection Agenda

4.14 
Social Safety Net: The key element of the new Government approach to
poverty reduction is to shift from the transfer/charity based approach to one based on
employment/empowerment. The Government is also addressing forcefully both the
efficiency and targeting of its existing system of subsidies and transfers and is
considering the reform of the institutional vehicle of its social programs. Our selective
assistance in this area involves a series of focused operations with an expected quick
impact on the population.

4.15 
A Social Fund Project would focus on micro-credit and community-based
infrastructure and employment creation schemes. The project would be implemented
through non-governmental organizations and focus on the poorer communities. A Low
Income Housing Project would support the Government's efforts in providing
affordable housing to low- and moderate-income families. Iran is facing serious problems

- 23 -

of housing in general and low-income housing in particular. The housing problem is
aggravated by a spur in the coming of age of a large number of young Iranians, and also
urban migration. The project would provide financing for low- and moderate-income
families through the National Housing Bank. A Housing Strategy Note will examine the
policy constraints in the sector and instruments to develop market-based housing finance
intermediation.

Support for Environment and Natural Resource Management

4.16 
Environment: Given the severity of pollution and its impact on public health,
the Bank will assist through a series of projects and advisory services that will
cumulatively help in building an investment portfolio, the outcomes of which would be
the reduction of exposure to air pollution and water borne diseases and, in parallel, a
strengthening of the capacity of the environment-related institutions in monitoring and
enforcement. The Bank will also provide non-lending services in the field of
environmental risk assessment and safeguards, as well as mainstreaming environmental
concerns into the decision-making process. Finally, as part of its regional cooperation and
with a view toward protecting the fragile marine ecosystems of the Caspian Sea, the Bank
will continue its on-going technical assistance to Iran.

4.17 
Untreated sewerage as well as municipal and hazardous waste constitute one of
the major environmental issues in Tehran and other secondary cities. Following the
Tehran project, a Second Sewerage Project would be developed to provide sewerage
and sanitation services in one or more secondary cities. The project will include:
pretreatment of industrial waters before discharging into the municipal sewers by
providing incentives to the polluting installations; appropriate treatment of municipal
waste water with proper disposal of sludge; and re-use of treated effluents for
agricultural/irrigation purposes.

4.18 
Iran has inadequate municipal waste disposal facilities. Iran produces about
14.7 million tons a year of municipal waste, of which 2.2 million tons is generated in
Tehran. Iranian industries also emit a total of 100,000 tons a year of toxic substances, as
well as 15,000 tons a year of heavy metals. On the basis of a waste management sector
note which will be prepared, a Municipal Solid Waste Management Project would
support the collection and safe disposal of municipal waste. The project would also
include a pilot component for handling hazardous and hospital waste, as these represent a
growing problem.

4.19 
Addressing the air pollution environmental problem, particularly in Tehran
where air quality is extremely poor, will require bold actions on a variety of fronts. On
the policy side of the problem, the Government needs to adjust significantly the level of
energy prices. This will induce a decrease in the use of private vehicles in cities. The
Government needs also to expand urban public transport. Part of the savings generated
from energy subsidy reduction could be used to finance this shift to a public transport
system. Conditional on significant progress in energy price reform, the World Bank
would support the Government program with an Urban Transport Project, which
would include investments in transport infrastructure, public transportation and measures
to monitor and control air pollution. Although the project will most likely mature after

- 24 -

the transition period, preparatory work could be initiated during the period. Preliminary
work has already been done in the area of air pollution by the World Bank in 1994, and
would be updated to support such an effort.

4.20 
In terms of capacity building, the Environmental Organization4 is expected to
play an important role in the formulation, implementation and enforcement of
environmental policies. An Environmental Management Project would assist the
Environmental Organization in capacity building and provide it with adequate equipment
for monitoring.

4.21 
Rural Environment/Water Resource Management: The ongoing Irrigation
Improvement Project (FY94) aims to improve water resource management in a number of
provinces. This large multi-component project supported activities such as: irrigation and
drainage networks improvement, operation and maintenance (O&M), water users
organizations, extension, research, environmental studies and institutional strengthening.
Achievements under this project, as well as the privatization of the O&M activities,
constitute a good basis for continued Bank involvement in rural environment and water
resource management.

4.22 
Consistent with the directions in the current FYDP, a Water Resource
Management Project would address the issues of watershed management based on a
river basin management approach. The project would include water management and
agricultural development in the lower reaches of the river basin, and watershed
management of the upper reaches of the river basin. In the lower reaches, the
rehabilitation and modernization of the irrigation and drainage networks and the
strengthening of the privatization of the operation and maintenance activities should be
linked to the strengthening of agricultural activities, such as extension and research. In
the upper reaches, watershed management would be geared towards conservation of soils,
rehabilitation of range land and restoration of marginal land, coupled with the
improvement of the quality and productivity of range land. The approach is intended to
ensure that the upstream rural inhabitants also share in the development, and participate
in the management of water resources.

4.23 
Environmental assessment will be an integral part of all lending operations.
These will provide opportunities for the Bank to strengthen capacity for the relevant
environmental institutions.

4.24 
Urban Upgrading and Historic Sites Rehabilitation: Part of the authorities'
strategy of employment creation and growth is to use its important cultural assets to
promote cultural-centered tourism as an important economic sector and as a means to
present the country's civilization and image to the rest of the world. An Urban
Upgrading and Historic Sites Rehabilitation Project linked to tourism development
would aim at developing cultural tourism as an economically as well as an
environmentally sustainable sector. The project would ensure regulated planning and
investments in historic sites to reconcile the economic benefits and the environmental
risks posed by unregulated investmnents and the expected increase of tourists. Project

4 Headed by a Vice President.

- 25 -

components would include: (i) renovation of historic sites; (ii) provision of supportive
public infrastructure; (iii) developing incentives for the private sector participation in
developing infrastructure and tourist facilities; and (iv) institutional/financial mechanisms
to ensure that local communities realize a share of the benefits from the tourism industry.

Portfolio Performance

4.25 
Of the six loans approved in the early 1990s, three have been closed with
satisfactory outcome and the remaining are expected to close over the next year. With the
approval of two projects last year, the current portfolio consists of 5 projects.
Implementation performance of all of these except for one (Health and Family Planning
Project) continues to be satisfactory. The health project has suffered from management
problems for the past year which has led to a lack of follow up on critical actions, but
these problems should be resolved shortly. Typically, projects in Iran have faced start-up
problems, but have generally been resolved satisfactorily over time with adequate and
consistent supervision by the Bank. These problems can be minimized in the future as the
Iranian agencies and Bank staff become more familiar with each other's procedures and
requirements, and have more regular contacts.

4.26 
Implementation performance, except for the start-up problems referred to above
caused mostly for procedural reasons, has been generally satisfactory. Annual
disbursement ratio has been in the 18-35% range in the last three years, and average
implementation period is estimated to be 5.5-6.5 years. The favorable record of
implementation in Iran reflects a high degree of competence and commitment of the
national staff working on the projects.

iMF Relations

4.27 
Iran maintains the normal Article IV consultative relations with the Fund. The
last such consultation was reviewed by the IMF Executive Board on August 3, 2000. The
Fund has an active program of technical assistance. In recent years, it has provided
technical assistance in the areas of banking supervision and regulation, foreign exchange
market reform, government finance and national accounts statistics, tax administration
and value added tax, and intensive training in financial programming (in Iran) for senior
officials. A number of Iranian officials also visited the Fund for short periods on special
assignments. Jointly with the Bank, the Fund conducted a financial sector assessment in
February/March 2000 under the FSAP.

Creditworthiness and Risks

5.1 
The proposed lending level of up to US$755 million over two years is within
the range of prudential limits of the World Bank. Iran indeed successfully managed the
difficulties in its commercial debt service during the 1990's period. It has a modest level
of debt burden and is now the second least indebted country in the region after Kuwait. It
has demonstrated, in the past, willingness to make extraordinary efforts to service its
external creditors even under severe circumstances, when it had sometimes, such as
during 1993-94, adjusted its imports by as much as 50% to honor its obligations. IBRD
exposure, in part due to the long hiatus in lending, would be very low, with IBRD debt
service in the next few years projected at about 0.4% of total exports and 2.5% of total
debt service (Table 6).

5.2 
Despite the current favorable financial situation, some risks would remain that
would need to be monitored. First, while Iran's fast debt reduction has reduced
significantly its debt related risk, the prospects of periodic macro economic imbalances
emerging will remain, with any major fluctuation of the oil market. Oil and gas continue
to be the dominant source of foreign exchange resources and budget revenue, and occupy
a prominent role in the structure of domestic production. The risk is somewhat reduced,
however, by the recent steps by the Government to limit the impact of these fluctuations
on economic stability, including the institution of an Oil Stabilization Fund, and the
adoption of a more cautious approach in the projection of oil price within the Third
FYDP.

5.3 
Second, the ambitious growth scenario of 6% per annum projected by the Third
FYDP under the current distorted economic structures, could prove difficult to achieve,
therefore slowing down progress in creating jobs and reducing poverty. Third, Iran
continues to confront a challenging political transition that weighs on its risk profile.
There are likely to be periodic controversies around the direction of reforms both at the
internal level, involving economic reforms and political liberties and openness, and at the
international level, involving the current d6tente-driven foreign policy. These would have
a bearing on Iran's ability to implement the economic reforms and the future directions of

- 28 -

its extemal relations, which could affect the effectiveness of the Bank Group's program.
Finally, the upcoming Presidential elections could also have a direct impact on the
direction, extent, and speed of the country's reforms and development.

5.4 
Finally, difficulties in implementation of various reforms can also be
anticipated. The reforms contemplated are normally difficult to undertake under any
circumstances since some would require painful and politically difficult decisions.
Coordination between the different elements of the reforms is also technically complex
and requires high skills and highly coordinated efforts between the different Government
departments. This is all the more important because of the interlocking nature of the
reforms. Lack of political support for the ensemble of the reforms or for one of the key
elements of these reforms (as with the case for energy subsidy reduction for example)
could impact on the speed and success of the whole process.

5.5 
In light of the above factors, Management will ensure that the scope and extent
of Bank support is tailored to development and reforms' needs of the country based on
the increase in our knowledge and assessment of social and economic developments.
