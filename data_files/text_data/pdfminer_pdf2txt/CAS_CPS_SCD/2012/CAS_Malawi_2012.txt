EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

This World Bank Group Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Malawi for the period FY13-FY16 
is fully aligned with the Second Malawi Growth and Development Strategy (MGDS II) adopted in 
April 2012 and the subsequent Economic Recovery Plan launched in October 2012.   

Malawi is a small country with one of the lowest per capita incomes in the world.  Its history has 
been characterized by alternating periods of good policy and then policy reversal. The economy is 
only starting to be stabilized after the reforms in 2012.  But the authorities are fully committed to 
reform and a new IMF program offers an opportunity to institutionalize and better sequence reforms.  
Structural transformation of Malawi’s economy will be critical over the coming years. 

The CAS responds to recent developments in the economic and governance context in Malawi, and 
prioritizes WBG support around three themes: (1) Promoting Sustainable, Diversified and Inclusive 
Growth; (2) Enhancing Human Capital and Reducing Vulnerabilities; and (3) Mainstreaming 
Governance for Enhanced Development Effectiveness.  Within these themes, WBG support will be 
demand-driven and exercise strategic selectivity.  The WBG will continue to: embrace the 
harmonization agenda, build-up country systems, and engage with all key stakeholders. 

The three priority themes of the CAS have been structured around six results areas: 
Result Area 1: Structural and macroeconomic policies to restore internal and external balance. 
Result Area 2: A business environment that promotes competitiveness and enhances productivity. 
Result Area 3: Improved delivery of public services. 
Result Area 4: Lowering vulnerability and enhancing resilience. 
Result Area 5: Improving public sector management systems. 
Result Area 6: Strengthening social accountability for service provision.  

The national elections slated for 2014 will be an important test for the stability of macroeconomic 
and other reform policies, which are critical for reducing poverty and increasing shared prosperity.  
Other important issues which could affect the success of the CAS results include Malawi’s 
vulnerability to external trade shocks and the strong dependence of the country on donor financing. 

During 2006-2010, Malawi averaged 7 percent annual GDP growth, but the growth has not translated 
into higher living standards for most people.  The CAS has been positioned to provide a combination 
of lending and knowledge work to help the country address these complex set of challenges and 
improve its competitiveness.  The CAS will also help take forward the regional integration agenda. 

The WBG portfolio continues to grow – e.g. the Bank commitment to Malawi currently is at $970 
million and it is a relatively young portfolio, of which about one-third has been disbursed.  The CAS 
places emphasis on effective implementation of projects so as to enhance the overall development 
impact of WBG support.  Going forward, Malawi has the opportunity to continue on a high growth 
path but also to ensure that the growth remains inclusive, and by implementing this CAS the WBG 
will remain a transformative player in the country.

I. INTRODUCTION 

1. 
Malawi is a small, peaceful, and democratic country, with one of the lowest per capita 
incomes in the world. In 2011 Gross National Income per capita (Atlas Method) was US$340. With 
a population of 14.9 million (WDI 2010), it is also one of the world’s most densely populated 
countries. Malawi is land-locked, has unexploited natural resources, and is highly vulnerable to 
shocks. It regularly suffers from droughts and floods. Its production and export structure is not 
diversified. Despite improvements in its food security, the country still experiences frequent food 
shortages, especially in the south. The economy faces numerous structural, institutional, and 
infrastructure constraints and is not well integrated into regional and global markets. Despite growth 
averaging 7 percent for 2006–10, absolute poverty has barely budged: from 52.4 percent in 2004/05 
to 50.7 percent in 2010/11. Despite a recent very difficult economic and political period, since April 
2012 Malawi has initiated major economic and political governance reforms. 

2. 
This four-year Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Malawi covers FY13-FY16. It is 
aligned with the Second Malawi Growth and Development Strategy (MGDS II, 2011–2016) adopted 
in April 2012. A Joint Staff Advisory Note on the MGDS II was presented to the IMF Board in July 
and the Bank Group Board in August 2012. Recognizing the magnitude of the reforms Malawi has 
undertaken this year after a change in administration, the World Bank Group (WBG) agreed with the 
Government of Malawi to slightly postpone finalization of the CAS. This allowed for additional 
consultations with the authorities and other stakeholders and takes account of the new government’s 
drive to re-prioritize Malawi’s medium-term strategic objectives (within the MGDS II) so as to deal 
with emerging macroeconomic realities. A government-initiated National Dialogue on the Economy 
in July 2012 resulted in the preparation of the Economic Recovery Plan, launched in October 2012, 
identifying commercial agriculture, mining, tourism, transport infrastructure, and energy as the five 
priorities to fuel the economic rebound, together with improving the investment climate and regional 
integration. The CAS responds to the revised priorities. 

II. COUNTRY CONTEXT AND DEVELOPMENT AGENDA 

Political Context 

3. 

Malawi went through a very turbulent period in 2010 and 2011. President Bingu wa 
Mutharika ruled the country from 2004 until his death in April 2012. Originally elected president as a 
member of the United Democratic Front (UDF), he soon split from the UDF to form a new party, the 
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP). Through 2009 his administration made substantial progress 
despite lacking a parliamentary majority: Malawi saw a remarkable economic turnaround, sustained 
economic growth, progress on service delivery and the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), 
and—most remarkable—improved food security. As a result, President Mutharika’s DPP was re-
elected for a second term in office (2009–2014) with a 60 percent majority in the 193-seat Parliament 

2 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Malawi Country Assistance Strategy FY13–16 

and also secured considerable support from independent parliamentarians 1. The administration was 
thus able to pass with ease laws in support of the President’s political and development agenda.  

4. 
In 2010 Malawi’s record on governance began to deteriorate significantly. Especially the 
application of checks and balances in the political process affected the environment for growth, the 
investment climate, and service delivery. In 2010 and 2011 Parliament passed a number of laws 
perceived as weakening democratic institutions and human rights. Local elections, required since 
2005 and planned for 2010, were again delayed. President Mutharika and Vice President Joyce 
Banda had a falling-out over succession strategies and in early 2011 Mrs. Banda, though still Vice 
President, began taking her own political course.  

5. 
Social conflicts over a host of governance issues soured relations between the 
government and most other stakeholders. Relations with neighboring countries became strained. 
The downturn in the economy fueled protests and strikes that peaked with demonstrations in July 
2011; the main demands were for resolution of economic and democratic governance challenges. 
Development Partners, still providing considerable assistance to Malawi, increasingly expressed 
concerns and gradually adjusted the size and content of their programs, rerouting planned budget 
support programs to long-term investment or capacity-building programs. Later on, DPs even funded 
directly essential imports such as fertilizer, fuel, and emergency drugs to keep essential poverty-
oriented programs on track. Major long-term investments, such as the US$350 million energy 
compact of the Millennium Challenge Corporation, were put on hold.  

6. 
The deterioration 
threatened 
to reverse Malawi’s major achievements 
in 
macroeconomic stabilization, economic growth, food security, and progress on a number of the 
MDGs. In 2011 there began a negative cycle of loss of confidence, investment, and international 
support. An IMF Extended Credit Facility (ECF), approved in February 2010, was suspended in June 
2011 and DPs halted all remaining budget support. The sudden drop in budget support, which 
traditionally underwrote 8–13 percent of the budget, worsened Malawi’s fiscal and external 
imbalances and further tilted an already severely imbalanced economy. In response, the government 
adopted a zero-deficit budget that attempted to fund all recurrent government expenditures from local 
tax revenues. This meant significant tax increases on an already overstressed private sector. 
Reserves, nevertheless, dwindled dramatically and domestic borrowing soared. With the exchange 
rate fixed, a severe foreign exchange deficit contributed to painful fuel shortages, idle industrial 
capacity, growing unemployment, and rising poverty. By early 2012 Malawi’s progress was nearly at 
a halt. 

7. 
When Bingu wa Mutharika died in April 2012, Joyce Mtila Banda became President of 
Malawi and began immediately to address reforms. Her new Cabinet 2 succeeded in getting 
Parliament to repeal some of the laws perceived as abrogating human rights and freedoms, such as 
the Civil Procedure Amendment Act and Section 46 of the Penal Code. The administration also 

1 The 2009 polls saw the number of women members of Parliament rise from 14 to 22.3 per cent. For the first time 
since independence in 1964, Malawi also had the first female Vice President, Mrs Joyce Banda. 
2 Out of a 36 Member Cabinet, in the Peoples Party led-Government, a third are women.

instituted inquiries into such prominent human rights abuses as deaths in police custody and has 
begun to cut wasteful spending. It has also undertaken to reinforce management of public 
procurement and controls and initiated leadership change in key accountability institutions and the 
long-awaited Electoral Commission has been appointed. The President also reached out to civil 
society, the churches, traditional authorities, private sector, DPs, and neighboring countries to mend 
relationships.  

8. 
Simultaneous presidential, parliamentary, and local government elections are planned 
for 2014. This timetable puts significant pressure on the government to demonstrate successful 
reforms in the next year. 

Social Context 

9. 
Malawi is ranked 171st out of 187 countries surveyed in the United Nations Human 
Development Index of 2011. According to the recent report of Malawi’s Third Integrated Household 
Survey (IHS3 2010/11), absolute poverty has declined by less than 2 percent since 2004/05, to 50.7 
percent. Although poverty in urban areas reduced from 25.4 percent in 2005 to 17.3 percent in 2011, 
this gain was counterbalanced by a worsening in rural poverty from 55.9 percent to 56.6 percent. 3 It 
appears from the stagnant rural poverty rate that despite an increase in per capita income, inequality 

in Malawi is rising.  Poverty rates among female headed households are significantly higher than male 
headed households, with their limited access to larger land holdings and failure to engage in cash crop 
production contributing to the higher household poverty 4. 

10. 
Income is unevenly distributed. The Gini coefficient for Malawi deteriorated from 0.39 
in 2004/05 to 0.45 in 2010/11. Within rural areas, the index rose from 0.34 to 0.38, while in urban 
areas it was fairly constant at about 0.49. The reasons for rising inequality need further investigation. 

11. 
 Stagnant poverty levels raise questions on the effectiveness of the Malawi’s Farm Input 
Subsidy Program (FISP) in alleviating poverty and food insecurity in a sustainable fashion. 
Preliminary investigations show that FISP may have a differential impact on different categories of 
farmers and could be an important factor behind increasing inequality. This is yet another area that 
warrants further investigation before credible policy recommendations could be drawn. However, the 
preliminary empirical evidence, based on the nationally-representative IHS3 data, shows that a large 
share of better-off farmers are benefiting from FISP inputs, most probably through redistribution 
and/or reselling from FISP beneficiaries. This may obviously limit the impact of FISP benefits on 
poor households and on poverty alleviation at large. 

12. With the majority of the poor living in rural areas, rural growth through agricultural 
transformation is clearly critical as Malawi strives to reduce the number of its people who live 
in absolute poverty. International experience shows that rapid and sustained poverty reduction 

3 The difference between IHS2 and the IHS3 national absolute poverty rates is not statistically significant. The IHS3 rural  
poverty rate is also statistically indistinguishable from that of IHS2. 
4 Poverty headcount for female headed households stood at 57.1 percent in 2011 compared with 49.0 percent for male headed 
households.

Malawi Country Assistance Strategy FY13–16 

requires expanding the sources of growth and in the process increasing the share of the labor force 
effectively. This is not yet the case in Malawi. Currently, a large number of Malawians depend for 
their livelihood on rain-fed subsistence agriculture. The impact from climate change and high 
population growth is likely to make them even more vulnerable unless the agricultural sector is 
transformed. 

13. 
High population growth (over 3 percent), high population density, and high HIV/AIDS 
prevalence exacerbate poverty. With almost 46 percent of the current population younger than 14 
years (WDI), if unabated the fertility rate of 6 births per woman will increase the pressures and costs 
of providing social services, worsen pressure on land and cause further environmental degradation, 
and increase pressure for employment. The MGDS I (2006 –2011) did not reach its goals of reducing 
annual population growth to 1.5 percent and the total fertility rate (TFR) to 4.9 by 2011, but the 
MGDS II has set an even more ambitious TFR target: 3.5 by 2016. Job creation, especially for the 
youth, is a major priority. The country has a large informal sector, mainly based on smallholder 
agriculture and employing a large proportion of women; only about 10–12 percent of the workforce 
is engaged in formal employment. Most working women are active in the informal sector.  Low 
wages and low labor productivity characterize Malawi’s labor market. The official estimate of 
unemployment is 4–5 percent,5 but anecdotal evidence points to a growing problem of youth 
unemployment and underemployment, especially in farming communities. Nationally, youth 
employment is 84 percent (IHS3): the labor force participation rate of those aged 15–24 is 77 
percent, with 54 percent of these employed by private individuals, 31 percent in the private sector, 
about 8 percent in the public sector and the remainder is employed by NGOs and others.  

14. 
Despite mixed human development indicators, Malawi is likely to meet four of the eight 
MDGs – which is a noteworthy achievement in the Sub-Saharan Africa context.  Health is being 
improved by reductions in chronic malnutrition, measles immunization for children less than a year 
old and life expectancy has surged, from 38 in 2005 to 53 in 2012. Unfortunately, the HIV 
prevalence rate in Malawi is still one of the highest in the world: 10.6% for adults aged 15–49 in 
2010 (12.9 percent for women and 8.1 percent for men), slightly down from 11.8 percent in 2004. 
AIDS is the leading cause of adult deaths in Malawi. As for the education MDGs, though Malawi has 
made progress, the quality of education is still low by regional standards. In general, though, Malawi 
is doing better on achieving the MDGs than many other sub-Saharan countries. It is likely to meet the 
goals related to reducing child mortality; combating HIV/AIDS, malaria, and other diseases; ensuring 
environmental sustainability and developing a global partnership for development (see Annex 4). 
Trends in under-5 and infant mortality have been improving steadily for two decades. While the 
country was believed to be on track to achieve the MDG goal on poverty eradication based on the 
2009 Welfare Monitory Survey, however, the results from IHS3 reflect a different picture.

welfare, which give little indication of the true incident of underemployment (ILO 2011).

Economic Context 

Structure of the Economy 

15. Malawi, a landlocked agrarian economy, is poorly integrated into the region in terms of 
both trade and physical infrastructure. The concentration of its economy in a few primary 
commodities makes it vulnerable to weather and terms of trade shocks. The country is also highly 
aid-dependent. Poor management of the public finances and frequent macroeconomic policy 
reversals make these economic vulnerabilities worse. In recent years, agriculture has been 
contributing about 28 percent to total GDP, services 33 percent, and a barely developed 
manufacturing sector 10 percent. Minerals began to make a contribution only in April 2009 with the 
start of uranium mining at Keyelekera, though interest in Malawi’s mineral potential has since 
intensified. However, unlike neighboring South Africa, Tanzania, Zambia, and Mozambique, where 
the recent commodity boom has re-emphasized mining as strategic for the entire economy, it is still 
only nascent in Malawi. When and how much it will contribute to the economy is very uncertain.  

16. 
Agriculture is the backbone of Malawi’s economy, accounting for about 85 percent of 
employment and about 80 percent of foreign exchange, about 60 percent of which comes from 
tobacco alone. The structural transformation in agriculture that took place in the mid-1990s saw 
particularly rapid growth in smallholder tobacco farms. Smallholders are responsible for more than 
80 percent of Malawi's agricultural production, but theirs is predominantly subsistence farming, and 
reliance on rain leaves them vulnerable to bad weather. Investment in productivity enhancements is 
minimal. To sustain growth in the sector, crop diversification and agro-processing will be critical. 

17. 
Since Malawi is landlocked with a narrow resource base and only a small domestic 
market, Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) is minimal. As Malawi depends heavily on transport 
through neighboring countries, the costs of importing raw material and intermediate inputs and of 
accessing export markets are high to begin with and they are exacerbated by extensive delays at 
ports, too many border procedures, and complex transit arrangements. FDI has mainly gone into 
mining, manufacturing, agriculture, tourism, and services.  

Recent Economic Developments  

18. 
From 2006 to 2010, Malawi averaged a solid 7 percent growth in GDP annually, 
supported by a stable macroeconomic environment and large aid inflows. But this growth has 
not translated into higher living standards for most Malawians. The growth was largely driven by 
exports (mainly tobacco); relatively large FDI in a mining project in 2009; and fiscal expansion. Debt 
relief from the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative helped to create the fiscal space 
Malawi needed to generate momentum for growth, but macroeconomic imbalances started to build 
up after the 2008 global crisis and the 2009 presidential elections. Then in 2011 came multiple 
shocks: adverse terms of trade, significant reductions in tobacco proceeds, and a drop in donor 
inflows (especially budget support); these were compounded by inappropriate policy responses. 
Together the shocks triggered a severe foreign exchange shortage. For the business community, 
delays in making payments abroad led first to loss of credit lines and then to scaling down operations 

6 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Malawi Country Assistance Strategy FY13–16 

and laying off workers. These events culminated in fiscal and external imbalances that required 
adjustment to contain domestic demand. But there were no adjustments with the 2011/12 budget, and 
as budget support grants disappeared, the authorities resorted to Central Bank financing. 

19. 
 By December 2011, severe foreign exchange shortages were beginning to choke the 
economy. Excess demand for foreign exchange led to increasing shortages of critical goods, 
especially fuel, and of other production inputs and essential drugs. With international reserves 
plunging, in August 2011 the authorities devalued the Malawi Kwacha (MWK) by 10 percent—but 
at the same time tightened restrictions on foreign exchange transactions. As the stricter controls 
drove economic activity to the parallel market, the gap between the official and parallel exchange 
rates shot up from 20 percent in August 2011 to about 80 percent in March 2012. Meanwhile, the 
downward slide of the economy speeded up because firms could not access foreign exchange to buy 
inputs for production. Fuel supply shortages also intensified. 

20. 
Employment downsizing, the resultant loss of income for food and other living expenses, 
and the price changes induced by the kwacha depreciation hit the poor hard. In urban areas, the 
poorest households suffered most from loss of income in terms of both aggregate and food 
consumption. In rural areas consumption fell for all income groups, but as a result of the 
depreciation-induced price changes, the poorest groups lost most. 

21. 
President Banda and her new government acted swiftly to arrest the economic crisis. In 
early May 2012, the government made a one-step 50 percent adjustment of the official exchange rate, 
moved to a floating exchange rate, liberalized current account transactions, reinstated the automatic 
fuel price adjustment mechanism, and adjusted electricity tariffs toward cost-recovery levels—all of 
which improved Malawi’s economic outlook. Tighter monetary policy brought an upward adjustment 
in the Reserve Bank’s rate in 2012 from 13 percent to 16 percent in May to 21 percent in June, and to 
25 percent in December. The authorities have also adopted a tight fiscal stance and a realistic 
2012/13 budget anchored on zero net domestic financing (on an annual basis). A sizable fiscal 
adjustment is planned in the 2012/13 budget to support the recent policy reforms, entrench 
macroeconomic stability, and expand social safety nets. 6 This will largely be supported by 
introduction of expenditure controls and prioritization as well as by revenue-enhancing measures.  

22. While the economic recovery remains fragile, policy reforms are starting to bear fruit, 
as evidenced by improvements in the availability of fuel and foreign exchange and the return of 
some credit lines. The floating exchange rate has crowded out the parallel market; the premium sank 
from 80 percent down to 5–10 percent. The supply of petroleum products has also loosened, excess 
liquidity tied to outstanding import bills has been mopped up, and smallholder tobacco farmers are 
being paid at market-determined exchange rates. However, the economic rebound has been buffeted 
by a surge in inflationary pressures since January 2012 (headline inflation in October 2012 was 30.6 
percent compared to 10.3 percent in January) as the kwacha continues to depreciate because of the 
pent-up demand for foreign exchange associated not only with market demands but also the backlog 
in private sector external arrears. The rise in the cost of living has intensified demands for wage 

6 Including expansion of a country-wide labour-intensive public works, the FISP, and several social safety net programs.

Malawi Country Assistance Strategy FY13–16 

increases in both public and private enterprises, and some labor strikes have slowed economic 
activity.  

The Medium-Term Economic Outlook 

23. 
The macroeconomic and structural reforms have brightened the medium-term 
economic outlook but there are still risks, mainly associated with the global environment.7 
While the recent reforms have made the country more competitive, the supply side response from the 
export side is still constrained. To transform Malawi into an export-led economy, the structure of the 
economy needs to be changed by diversifying; improving the business environment; reducing the 
infrastructure deficit, especially energy and water; improving trade facilitation and regional 
integration; making credit more available and affordable, especially to smallholders; and addressing 
the skills gap. Deteriorated governance and accountability performance also needs to be addressed.  

24. 
Real GDP growth is expected to rebound to more than 6 percent by 2014, anchored 
mainly by the sectors hardest hit by foreign exchange shortages: tourism, manufacturing, 
transportation services, construction, and trade (Table 1). 8 Growth in services is expected to be 
healthy in the medium term, propelled by financial services and telecommunications. Other sectors will 
also benefit from the gradual move toward agricultural commercialization. Mining and construction 
are expected to see solid growth, but if growth is to be inclusive, it needs to be broad-based. 

25. 
Rising inflationary pressures, projected at 20.8 percent in 2012, are expected to taper 
off to 18.0 percent in 2013 and ease to pre-2010 levels of less than 7 percent by 2016, despite the 
recent bouts of high inflation. Fiscal policy is expected to be contractionary, anchored on zero net 
domestic financing and geared to creating fiscal space for pro-poor and growth-enhancing spending. 
The overall balance is projected to narrow from a deficit of 8.5 percent of GDP in 2011/12 to an 
average deficit of 0.5 percent for 2013–2016, assuming that the authorities resist pre-election 
spending pressures. The current account deficit is also projected to narrow, from 5.9 percent of GDP 
in 2011 to an average of not more than 1.7 percent for 2013–2016.  

26. 
As production diversifies, agriculture is expected to rebound to 5 percent growth within 
the next 24 months and continue on up over the medium term, supported by planned reforms, 
such as commercialization and modernization of farming systems. In addition, some rebalancing 
of public spending in agriculture is expected to support promotion of crop diversification, small 
livestock production, commodity risk management, and other productivity-enhancing investments. 
Meanwhile, manufacturing is expected to rebound by the second half of 2013 as firms begin to use 
up idle capacity when supply chains normalize based on returning lines of credit and foreign 
exchange supply. However, inadequate energy and water supplies are expected to remain a constraint 
for a number of years.  

7 Other threats include the risk of policy reversal as the 2014 elections approach, exogenous and terms of trade shocks, and 
shortfalls in donor support. 
8 Assuming that the authorities sustain the recent reforms.

27. 
If several critical problems are addressed, the mining sector could bring in significantly 
more export earnings and revenues in the medium term, particularly if the second phase of the 
Keyelekera uranium mine is confirmed. Depending on external factors like international 
commodity prices and internal factors like power supplies and the legal and institutional framework, 
several other mining projects could reach the stage of investment decision before 2020.  

28. 
At the moment the risk of debt distress is moderate; Malawi’s debt burden indicators 
are expected to remain well below prudential thresholds. Over the long term, the stock of external 
public and publicly guaranteed debt is expected to ease downward from about 31 percent of GDP in 
2012 to about 16 percent in 2032. The present value of the debt-to-exports ratio falls gradually and 
stays under 80 percent, well below the 150 percent distress threshold. However, stress tests show that 
an export shock could breach the threshold-hence the need to diversify exports to minimize Malawi’s 
9 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Malawi Country Assistance Strategy FY13–16 

vulnerability to shocks. The policy slippages in 2010–2011 contributed to the build-up of domestic 
debt in 2011 to about 25 percent of GDP (from 20 percent as of 2008). Stress tests indicate a need for 
fiscal consolidation and reform of parastatal institutions to slow growth in the domestic debt stock. 

Development Challenges and Opportunities 

Economic Management, the Business Environment, and Regional Integration 

29. 
Sustaining the policy reforms may be a problem. The country’s history has been 
characterized by alternating periods of good policy implementation and policy reversals, usually 
associated with different political cycles. Macroeconomic stability following the actions taken by the 
new administration is still tentative and overall benefits depend critically on sustaining the reform 
momentum. However, the commitment of the authorities and the new IMF/ECF program offer an 
opportunity to further institutionalize and better sequence reforms to ensure the chances of 
sustainability before and after the elections. Structural transformation of the economy will also be 
critical. 

30. 
Public spending is inefficient and poorly targeted. There needs to be sound public 
financial management (PFM) and spending that is growth-enhancing and poverty-reducing, which 
depends on a more credible budget. It is essential that Malawi reduces variations in the recurrent 
budget while containing its growth, ensuring better linkage with policy priorities by budgeting within 
a medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF), more focused and more carefully appraised public 
investment, and managing domestic debt so as to ensure that it is not only sustainable but also 
adheres to the guiding principles stipulated in the debt management strategy. With support from DPs, 
the government has initiated several programs to reinforce financial management processes, and in 
2011 approved the Public Finance and Economic Management Reform Program (PFEM). The Multi-
Donor Trust Fund (MDTF) for the PFEM, managed by the Bank, is a comprehensive and well-
coordinated approach to helping Malawi build capacity to better manage public resources.  

31. 
Agriculture, the main source of growth and exports in Malawi, is central to reducing 
poverty. Expanding and diversifying agricultural exports and expanding commercial agriculture is 
high priority. The country’s dependence on a single agricultural export, tobacco, is now threatened 
by the enforcement of the Framework Convention on Tobacco, which would restrict, and possibly 
ban, the use of flavorants, which are essential ingredients for burley-filled tobacco products. Burley 
tobacco still accounts for about 80 percent of Malawi’s agricultural exports and 60 percent of 
national export value. The new government is considering a thorough revision of the Tobacco Act 
after consultation with all stakeholders. A major shift from an auction-based system toward contract 
farming is underway. Sugar and tea are important alternatives, particularly for larger agricultural 
estates (and their smallholder subcontractors), and a broader range of commercial opportunities is 
needed for smallholders. With support from DPs, the government is promoting production of 
legumes and has introduced a pilot program to promote cotton production. Other potential 
commercial agricultural products are pepper, coffee, and horticultural crops as well as dairy and 
poultry production. However, the success of agricultural diversification will inter alia depend on 
adequate road access (highlighted in the 2010 CEM) and marketing infrastructure.

Malawi Country Assistance Strategy FY13–16 

32. 
Irrigation 
is 
critical 
for 
enhancing productivity, water use 
efficiency, 
commercialization, diversification, and for resilience to climate change. Small and medium scale 
irrigation has expanded in recent years, building the base for a diversified rural economy and 
incomes in the dry season. On a larger scale, if implemented successfully through a public-private 
partnership (PPP) arrangement and with due attention to economic, social, and environmental 
sustainability, the Shire Valley Irrigation Project (which could cover as much as 42,000 ha, about 50 
times larger than the largest publicly financed scheme in Malawi) could transform the regional 
economy and help increase the much needed export base. The World Bank, the AfDB, and the IFC 
are involved in preparatory activities. The water resource base could provide opportunities for 
agriculture, consumption, hydropower, fisheries, industry, and tourism, and can be harnessed 
efficiently for times of scarcity.  

33. Mining is in its initial stages, but could become more important in the medium term.  In 
addition to the Kayerekera project, the niobium mining project at Kanyika, for which an agreement is 
currently being negotiated, is a good example.  The growing interest that has been shown in potential 
oil resources, underlines the need to put in place capacity to manage the extractive industries, 
beginning with effective and transparent measures to allocate exploration rights. This potential for oil 
resources also provides an opportunity to plan mechanisms for the equitable distribution of revenues 
to benefit all Malawians and to define appropriate social and environmental safeguards. 

34. 
The authorities are currently drafting a National Export Strategy (NES) as a road map 
for how Malawi can drive export growth to generate the foreign exchange it needs. Efforts are 
underway to establish an export guarantee financing facility for potential exporters. Careful research 
and market analysis will be critical to ensure its success: the value chain analysis undertaken by the 
World Bank and other DPs can be useful in this process.  

35. 
Private investment is deterred by the investment climate. The deterioration of the 
business environment in Malawi in recent years has slowed FDI and reduced competitiveness. The 
2009 Enterprise Survey for Malawi listed the top five obstacles: access to finance, transportation, 
informal practices, electricity, and tax rates. While the new government has made commendable 
efforts on stabilizing the economy, improving the business environment will depend on policy 
certainty and predictability. 

36. 
Access to finance is a major problem. The financial system suffers from a lack of critical 
mass, low productivity, high spreads because of high costs, and limited outreach and product 
variety. 9 According to the 2009 Finscope Survey, only about 19 percent of Malawi’s population have 
formal bank accounts, and only 3 percent use insurance or pension products. However, recent 
reforms in the laws governing the financial sector have potential to deepen and broaden the 
availability of financial services.

37. 
Delays at ports and border posts, unduly complex customs, and regulatory and non-
tariff barriers along major routes all contribute to higher-than-necessary transport costs, 
making it harder for Malawi to integrate into the regional and global economy. The 
government, with support from the EU and other DPs, has made major investments in roads. 
Although data on road conditions are encouraging, 10 significant investments are still needed to 
prevent future deterioration; a joint sector approach has therefore been formulated in collaboration 
with DPs. Road safety is a major problem in Malawi, requiring solutions that address institutions and 
attitudes as well as infrastructure. Rail transport is underutilized as a lower-cost alternative to road 
freight due to the poor condition of rails and rail-beds and shortages of rolling stock. Only through 
consolidation of traffic from neighboring countries, with Malawi acting as a regional hub, can 
improvements to the rail infrastructure be justified. Malawi’s location as a potential transit route for 
the increasing volume of minerals being produced regionally (particularly in Mozambique’s Tete 
Province and in Zambia), offers opportunities to attract significant infrastructure investment. Close 
collaboration with neighboring countries offers the most effective, in some cases the only, way to 
reduce these infrastructure gaps. In this regard, a dramatic improvement in the rail sector in Malawi 
is expected from a new PPP agreement between the governments of Malawi and Mozambique and 
Brazilian mining giant Vale to construct a new line through Malawi, part of a US$ 2 billion 
investment in a railway line from the northwestern province of Tete in Mozambique, through 
Malawi, to a new coal terminal at Nacala-a-Velha port in Mozambique, scheduled to open in 2015. 

38. Malawi’s energy sector needs both public and private investments to eliminate energy 
shortages, by upgrading transmission and distribution systems to reduce energy losses and 
improving both energy efficiency and transmission interconnections to the Southern African 
Power Pool (SAPP) to diversify supply sources. One hydropower facility is being extended, and 
the feasibility of several new hydro-generation sites is being studied as part of the World Bank-
supported energy project. A US$350 million Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) project will, 
besides upgrading generation and transmission systems, provide support for improvements at the 
state-owned utility and for amending regulations to facilitate private participation. These efforts are 
aligned with the Bank’s engagement with the government on sector policy and regulation, and IFC is 
involved in discussions on options for introduction of management contracts and possible PPPs in the 
sector. Moreover, the new government is giving priority to reviving a project to connect Malawi to 
the SAPP to enable import and export of power. There is renewed optimism on the medium-term 
energy outlook that is increasing private interest in investment.  Energy could provide good 
opportunity for PPPs but needs careful preparation.  Box 1 provides further details on the PPP 
environment in Malawi.

Box 1:  Public-Private Partnerships in Malawi 

Some years ago the government began a long process of improving the environment for PPPs in order to lower 
investors’ perceptions of risk and increase government capacity to enter into and monitor PPP projects. This has 
now culminated in the adoption of a PPP policy, the passing of the PPP Act in 2011, and transformation of the 
Privatization Commission into the PPP Commission. Effective regulation, which is vital to the success of PPPs, has 
been partially addressed with the establishment of regulators for energy, water, and telecommunications. Other 
sectors are regulated by line ministries. 

The existence of a pipeline of viable PPP projects is important for attracting investors to participate. The WBG, 
through a PPIAF grant, is providing support to the PPP Commission to screen potential projects and identify 
candidates for further development. The WBG has supported government in formulating the institutional framework 
for PPP management and in building capacity of the commission itself, both through PPIAF and as a part of projects 
such as BESTAP. It is currently advising the government on renegotiation of the CEAR rail concession to take full 
advantage of new investments in the line. IFC’s PPP advisory department recently undertook scoping mission to 
Malawi to assess the opportunities and possible areas of private sector engagement in the provision of long-term 
sustainable water services and identified potentially interesting opportunities. 

39. Water resources management and infrastructure are not sufficient for growth in 
critical sectors. While Malawi has enough water resources, they are unevenly distributed, erratic, 
and not well-harnessed. Apart from the natural storage in Lake Malawi, there is very little storage 
elsewhere and Malawi has no good database or modelling tools to support decision making. Key 
economic sectors (irrigation, hydropower, water supply for industrial and human use, and navigation) 
are significantly raising demand for water. As new needs arise, decisions on development of water 
resources have been ad hoc and uncoordinated. There is, at present, no institutional mechanism to 
coordinate investment planning and systems, and water conflicts are becoming apparent, especially 
in the Shire Basin, where 96 percent of the country’s energy is generated. Blantyre, the country’s 
commercial centre, draws its water supply from there, and current and planned irrigation in the basin 
will significantly increase demand. Given the periodic low flows, water resources are unlikely to be 
sufficient to meet all needs, thus making negotiated joint planning imperative.  

40. 

Information communications and technology (ICT) can be leveraged for economic 
growth. Since the mobile phone was introduced in Malawi in 1996, ownership has increased (see 
Table 2) and device costs have plunged. Recent installation by Malawi Telecommunications Limited 
and Electricity Supply Corporation of Malawi of a fiber optic network and launch of the World 
Bank-funded Regional Communications Infrastructure Project (RCIP), which will connect Malawi to 
undersea fiber optic cables from the coast of Mozambique and Tanzania (through a PPP 
arrangement), will inevitably lead to faster, more reliable, and cheaper connections. While Malawi 
has yet to realize the full potential of mobile phones as a low-cost payment system and for increasing 
access to finance, especially in rural areas, the recent piloting of a mobile money product by the 
major mobile operators and the increasing use of mobile phone value- added services by financing 
institutions suggest that quick progress is possible. With joint IDA, DfID, and USAID financing, a 
Financial Sector Deepening Trust Fund is being established to encourage access to finance and 

13 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Malawi Country Assistance Strategy FY13–16 
leverage ICT, especially for lower income households and smaller scale enterprises in both rural 
and urban areas 11.

41. 
Regional integration can help create jobs by broadening Malawi’s export base. Because 
it is small and land-locked, regional integration is necessary for Malawi to benefit from the growth of 
the larger economies in neighboring countries (Box 2). Opportunities missed in the past include the 
Bank’s Malawi-Mozambique energy 
interconnector project and an 
initiative 
to 
improve 
environmental management of Lake Malawi. Since the new government has taken power, it has 
moved to repair strained relations with neighboring countries, and prospects seem better for a more 
constructive environment for regional cooperation. Malawi has signaled that reinstating the Malawi-
Mozambique energy interconnector has high priority to overcome the crippling power shortages. 
Major new mining projects in Tete province in neighboring Mozambique and the buoyant economy 
in Zambia could benefit Malawi both through investments in improved transport corridors and by 
generating opportunities for Malawian businesses to provide goods and services. 

42. 
Lack of skilled labor is a barrier to private sector-led growth. Malawi’s tertiary gross 
enrollment rate is 0.4 percent—one of the very lowest in Africa. Although recent gains in enrollment 
due to the introduction of private institutions have eased some constraints to access, they still enroll 
only about 12% of the students. University entry, based on merit, is highly competitive. However, 
Malawi’s tertiary education system is regressive in that student loans are not needs-based and are 
almost never recovered, which further exacerbates inequities. Expansion of enrollments is not based 
on labor market needs, and there is little evidence that the private sector is consulted on program 
development or curricula. In addition, with the shift from the Board of Governors to the University of 
Malawi12, technician programs in core skills areas were neglected or entirely abolished. Access, 
quality, and funding indicators for Technical, Entrepreneurship and Vocational Education Training 
(TEVET) in Malawi are among the lowest in the region. Although the private sector is well 
represented on the TEVET board, both universities and TEVET suffer from low private participation. 

11 The Trust will operate as a legally independent Trust under the supervision of professional trustees, with policy 
guidance from a program investment committee comprised of representatives of donors and GOM. 

12 Until 2002 a Board of Governors was responsible for degree level technicians program in Malawi, a parallel structure in the 
University of Malawi, housed at the Polytechnic. They continued to be responsible for all aspects of the technician programme 
until they were dissolved.

Malawi Country Assistance Strategy FY13–16 

Consequentially, analysis has found that severe skills gaps remain, including in such vital growth 
areas as mining, agriculture, tourism, and the construction industry.  

Box 2:  Regional Integration 

Especially for Malawi, integration into the dynamic and open Southern African region is central to building 
prosperity and improving livelihoods. Although there has been solid political consensus from regional leaders in 
support of integration, some countries continue at various levels to protect national producers. South Africa exports 
twice as much to countries in the region as it imports from them, but economies of scale make it difficult to redress 
the imbalance. In southern Africa there are many cases where national boundaries artificially separate areas of 
production from nearby markets.  

Recent progress in regional cooperation, including the gradual dismantling of barriers within the COMESA and 
SADC free trade areas and renewed bilateral cooperation with Mozambique, will help expand market access and the 
inflow of investment to support diversified exports and economic growth in Malawi, though significant work is still 
necessary to turn intentions into reality. Malawi also depends on regional collaboration to upgrade infrastructure to 
regional and international markets; harmonize standards and sanitary measures; protect against plant and animal 
diseases; and generate new technology. However, if it is to be regionally competitive, the country needs to address 
the problems of low productivity, high cost of inputs, and high costs along the value chain through available 
regional and national initiatives. Malawi is already simplifying its trade regime and establishing one-stop border 
posts with Mozambique, Tanzania, and Zambia; the launch of the MGDS II and the ERP present opportunities to 
push forward regional integration. Initiatives are already underway to improve rail and telecommunication 
infrastructure, such as private investment in the railway line from Tete in northwestern Mozambique via Malawi to a 
new port at Nacala-a-Velha and the SADC fiber-based telecommunications network. In addition, the government 
has resumed negotiations on a regional electricity interconnector with Mozambique and is facilitating market access 
for Malawian products, in particular targeting the economic boom in Tete

Human Development Indicators and Vulnerabilities 

43. 
Building up the human capital base is a priority for Malawi. Although primary education 
is free, only 55 percent of boys and 45 percent of girls finish primary school. Secondary education 
has lower gross enrolment rate of only 17 percent, with fewer girls than boys. Malawi’s scores on 
student learning tests are among the worst in the countries of the Southern African Consortium of 

Monitoring Education Quality (SACMEQ).  Malawi is expected to make progress towards 
achieving quality education for all as the Government has committed itself to a comprehensive 
reform agenda largely based on the findings of a rigorous sector analysis.  Malawi’s national 
education sector plan addresses key reform areas including (i) increasing accountability through 
providing grants to schools; (ii)  reducing the rural urban disparity in  pupil teacher ratios; and 
(iii) promotion of double-shifting.  In response, DPs have committed to support the 
implementation of the national education sector through a Sector Wide Approach.   As a result of 
these efforts the total financial envelope has been growing and beginning to constitute a more 
proportionate response to the scale of issues faced in Malawi. In line with the recommendation of 

the 2013 WDR on Jobs, the Government of Malawi understands that a holistic approach to address 
15 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Malawi Country Assistance Strategy FY13–16 

constraints faced in the education sector is needed in order to improve the quality and effectiveness 
of the education system to provide the generic skills needed to learn and adapt to different tasks that 
young people will need in a rapidly changing world.  

44. 
Stunting, a primary manifestation of malnutrition in early childhood linked to maternal 
size, nutrition during pregnancy, and fetal growth, has barely shown any improvement since 
1992, and at 48 percent in 2010 is among the worst in sub-Saharan Africa. Since malnutrition is 
the cause of one-third to half of all child deaths and impairs cognitive development by 20 or more IQ 
points, the challenge is to finance a coherent and integrated approach to nutrition. 13 Although good 
progress has been made on HIV/AIDS, with more people on antiretroviral drug treatment (ART) and 
increased availability of counseling and testing, a major effort is needed to prevent new HIV 
infections. Unless incidence is reduced significantly, due to Malawi’s financial and health system 
limitations ART is not sustainable in the long term at current population growth rates. 

45. 
Addressing Malawi’s population projections is necessary to ensure sustainable 
economic growth. Malawi is one of southern Africa’s most densely populated countries; its young 
and growing population is expected to reach 24.2 million by 2025. A sustained multi-sector approach 
will be necessary to address the causes and consequences of population growth. The goal of the 
MGDS II is to manage population growth for sustainable socioeconomic development. Its expected 
outcomes are a reduced fertility rate and well-managed migration. A number of initiatives for 
reducing the fertility rate are underway. The government and DPs (IDA, DfID, UNICEF, USAID) 
are supporting proven interventions to delay early marriage and reduce early pregnancy by (i) 
expanding access to modern family planning methods; (ii) improved access to health commodities; 
(iii) improved sanitation facilities in secondary schools; and (iv) school bursaries and cash transfers 
that are conditional on girls’ attendance.  

46. 
Although investments in women’s empowerment have brought notable progress, 
women in Malawi are still disadvantaged in numerous ways. The Malawi Poverty and 
Vulnerability Assessment (2007) found that women head 23 percent of all households. Though the 
maternal mortality rate has been moving downward, from 984 per 100,000 live births in 2004 to 675 
in 2010, it is still high. The schooling conditional cash transfer program is helping to close gender 
gaps in primary education, but only 66 percent of women are literate compared to 80 percent of men. 
Furthermore, in rural Malawi the households headed by females tend to be poorer than male-headed 
households.  

47. 
The government has been providing social protection through various interventions to 
help vulnerable groups manage the risks they face. An estimated 50 percent of the population is 
classified as vulnerable (IHS3 2010–2011). Government spending on social protection was 5 percent 
of total spending in FY12/13 (excluding FISP) but is mainly sourced from DPs. It includes cash 
transfer pilot schemes, labor-intensive public works, school feeding programs, and investments in 

13 A recent study highlighted the widespread growth retardation during the first two years of life that underlies the prevalence of 
stunting. The growth retardation is in large part due to inadequate child care and feeding practices, which can easily be overcome 
by counselling mothers and caregivers. However, this requires a program shift that gives more attention to preventing growth 
retardation rather than treating acute malnutrition.

improving resilience to climate shocks through better management of natural resources, flood risk, 
and irrigation. Currently, many of the social support interventions in Malawi are not coordinated. 
Most, except for public works, are not implemented nationwide, are not amenable to scaling up in 
times of crisis, and have different targeting mechanisms, making it possible to double-target a single 
needy household. In line with the Social Support Policy adopted in June 2012, the government has 
therefore begun to roll out large programs to reach more vulnerable people and to cushion the impact 
of the stabilization effort on the most vulnerable groups.  

48. 
Adequate water supply and sanitation services for Malawi’s citizens and businesses are 
needed to reduce poverty. The Ministry of Water Development and Irrigation and the five regional 
water boards have made significant progress, and water access rates have increased from 40 percent 
in 1990 to 83 percent in 2010. 14 Access to adequate sanitation has increased more slowly, from 42 
percent to 51 percent during the period, with 8 percent open defecation. 

49. 
Significant human pressure is degrading Malawi’s land and forests. A growing 
population increases the pressure on land for cultivation and exploits forests and woodlands for 
firewood and charcoal production. Land degradation, deforestation, inappropriate farming methods, 
and limited incentives to promote land and water conservation have increased erosion, run-off, and 
flash floods, carrying high loads of sediment that are deposited in reservoirs and flood plains. 
Together, these factors reduce agricultural productivity, fisheries potential, and hydropower 
generation; damage infrastructure, and adversely affect critical ecosystems and human health. 

50. Malawi is prone to natural disasters primarily related to climate variability and change. 
Its location within the East African Rift system makes it susceptible to disastrous earthquakes; the 
December 20, 2009, earthquake in Karonga, which had an intensity of 6.2 on the Richter scale, 
caused US$13.6 million in damages and affected over 145,000 people. Climate-related disasters such 
as floods and droughts are more frequent due to degradation of upper catchment areas, encroachment 
of river banks, and the increasing incidence of extreme weather affecting larger areas of the country 
and exacerbating Malawi’s already high levels of poverty. On average, 1.7 percent of GDP is lost 
each year to droughts and floods and about 265,000 more people fall into poverty. Resilience to 
disaster and climate risks is particularly important for the rural households who depend on the fragile 
natural resource base for their livelihoods. Forest cover is reportedly decreasing at an alarming rate, 
and the energy balance has not moved away from biomass at all. Rural roads and the rail network are 
particularly vulnerable to the increased run-off rates that accompany climate change. Climate shocks 
have direct effects on agricultural productivity and rural vulnerability and erode the productive assets 
of the poor. Further linking climate risk management and investments with productive social 
protection investments is necessary to prevent erosion of human capital and build the productive 
capacity of the poor.

Public Sector Governance 

51. 
Democratic governance saw some serious setbacks in the last two years, but the 
approach of the new administration is encouraging. Laws that were perceived as oppressive have 
been repealed and engagement with civil society has been reopened. The administration has also 
begun to move on overdue procurement and anti-corruption reforms and has appointed new 
commissions, such as the Electoral Commission. These positive steps bode well for Malawi’s 
renewed commitment to democratic governance. 

52. 
Over the last decade, Malawi has made progress in reinforcing public sector 
management systems but their application is still a challenge. The quality of public governance 
depends on such underlying issues as checks and balances and improving the operations that must 
support the CAS to promote a results orientation, enhance social accountability, and build trust in 
government. This calls for a balanced approach, incorporating both supply-side mechanisms in 
public sector management and demand-side mechanisms by working to strengthen citizen groups and 
social accountability. While some progress has been made in PFM, human resource management, 
and procurement, monitoring and evaluation (M&E) and decentralization now need attention.  

53. Malawi has made some progress in PFM, procurement, and human resource 
management, but there is still room for further improvement. Public Expenditure and Financial 
Accountability (PEFA) assessments were conducted in Malawi in 2005, 2006, 2008, and 2011. The 
latest, which analyzed performance for 2007–11, revealed that PFM capacity is emerging, as 
evidenced by a more orderly annual budget process and more timely and better quality public 
accounting and reporting through roll-out of the Integrated Financial Management Information 
System (IFMIS). But budget credibility has been undermined by overspending and there are serious 
deficiencies in management and operation of IFMIS controls that have caused significant financial 
losses. The capacity to carry out more timely audits, both external and internal audits, has improved, 
although the quality and the follow-up on internal and external audits are still uncertain; regulation 
and operational guidelines for internal auditing are not yet well embedded; and systems-based 
coverage is low. There is now a solid legal foundation for public procurement and dedicated 
procurement units have been established in major spending ministries, though many are not yet fully 
staffed. Since 2008 the government has also been carrying out independent procurement audits and is 
moving to institute a procurement cadre within the Ministry of Finance Purchasing and Supply 
Directorate. The Public Procurement Act is currently being reviewed to give the directorate more 
powers to investigate fraud and corruption in the public sector, which was previously within the 
purview of the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB). In human resource management, the government is 
now able to monitor the wage bill month by month and reports are sent to heads of ministries. Next 
planned steps are a payroll audit and further elimination of all ghost workers. 

54. 
The government now has a basis for M&E, and the next step would be a government-
wide and results-oriented M&E system and a push for performance management. Malawi has 
also been improving its statistics. The National Statistical Office (NSO) has experience in 
administering the National Household Survey and other mandated basic surveys, but there are data 
18 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Malawi Country Assistance Strategy FY13–16 

quality questions and there need to be closer links between the NSO and both suppliers and users of 
data, outside as well as inside government. Management of various public sectors is also being 
reinforced, especially for mining, where the reform agenda includes adoption of a sector 
development policy in 2012, revision of the mining law, better engagement with stakeholders on 
such issues as revenue transparency, upstream and downstream management of mineral resources, 
and careful monitoring of environmental, social, and institutional impacts. These efforts to mitigate 
the risks associated with mining development during the CAS period are timely; several options 
currently being explored could lead to significant mining activity within 10 years. 

55. 
Decentralization has been progressing slowly. While a policy has been elaborated, as yet 
there is no solid fiscal and institutional decentralization plan. There is need to prepare a solid 
revenue and expenditure allocation system and a transfer system for local governments; build up 
intergovernmental accountability; and emphasize social accountability. Until there are elections, 
which were postponed by the previous government until 2014, it will be difficult to make substantial 
progress on decentralization 

56. Malawi has set up formal accountability institutions, but their ability to exercise 
effective oversight is at times limited. Parliament’s role in providing checks and balances over the 
presidency has been minimal, especially when the ruling party dominated the Chamber, but its 
oversight over government ministries, departments, and public institutions has been better because 
that is done through committees. While there has been oversight from a relatively effective judiciary, 
there is a need to complement formal oversight mechanisms with more informal social accountability 
mechanisms. In this context, it is noteworthy that Malawi recently joined the Global Partnership for 
Social Accountability (GPSA) and even agreed to serve as one of the three governments to serve on 
the first steering committee.  

57. 
Civil society in Malawi, which is active and diverse, has been instrumental in shaping 
public policy. Examples of demand-side governance instruments are community score cards and 
report cards, user committees, and participation by nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) in certain 
sectors (e.g., water, irrigation)—all of which have helped to lay the foundation for more social 
accountability. Since last year’s social unrest, civil society has grown and matured. The new 
administration has reached out effectively to civil society organizations (CSOs), and the dialogue is 
expected to result in further collaboration. Malawi also enjoys independent and outspoken media. By 
various accounts, threats to journalists and their institutions during 2011 did little to dampen their 
resolve to exercise freedom of the press. 

58. Malawi has made progress in building up its anticorruption mechanisms but needs to 
do more to improve transparency and accountability. Recent anti-governance trends have 
widened the transparency and accountability gap. This is demonstrated, for example, by the 2011 
Transparency International Corruption Perception Index in which Malawi scored 3 out of 10, down 
from 3.4 in 2010. Malawi’s Country Performance and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) also slid from 
3.5 in 2007 to 3.3 in 2012. Malawi’s ACB does not believe it has adequate capacity, both human and 
19 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Malawi Country Assistance Strategy FY13–16 

financial, to handle the growing corruption. Malawi is a party to anticorruption treaties, like the UN 
Convention against Corruption and the African Union Convention on Prevention and Combating 
Corruption, but while approval of these conventions is clearly a positive step, much remains to be 
done to fulfill the associated obligations. 

III. WBG ASSISTANCE STRATEGY FOR MALAWI 

A. 

Underpinnings and Principles of the CAS  

59. 
The new WBG strategy has been informed and enriched by a variety of documents, 
views from stakeholders, and numerous lessons from experience. A primary document was the 
government’s poverty reduction strategy, the MGDS II. The relevance and appropriateness of the 
proposal for the Bank Group’s program were verified by a range of stakeholders through group 
consultations and surveys of about 600 representative clients. The CAS strategy also hinges on the 
Bank’s Africa Region Strategy, lessons from the previous CAS, knowledge and advice from the 
World Development Reports on gender and on jobs. Above all, the strategy embodies the WBG’s 
commitment to achieving results both in investments and in knowledge and analytical work; the 
ultimate goal is to improve the lives of Malawians. 

Second Malawi Growth and Development Strategy (MGDS II)  

60. 
The MGDS II (2011–2016) is the country’s second plan to reduce poverty by creating 
wealth through sustainable economic growth and infrastructure development over the medium 
term. MGDS II identifies six thematic areas: sustainable economic growth; social development; 
social support and disaster risk management (DRM); infrastructure development; improved 
governance; and cross-cutting issues (gender, capacity development, population, decent employment, 
productive activities, and economic and democratic governance). The MGDS II emphasizes an 
export-led growth strategy with major investments in agriculture, manufacturing, mining, and 
tourism. It commits to heightened accountability and transparency in the public sector, recognizes the 
importance of reforming PFM and public administration, and highlights the achievement of social 
objectives. MGDS II was drafted over the course of two years through an inclusive process of 
consultation with a range of stakeholders. It also drew from what was learned in implementing 
MGDS I. The cabinet approved the strategy in April 2012 and a few months later gave priority to the 
Economic Recovery Plan (ERP), which identified a number of areas for accelerating a rebound from 
the economic crisis in 2011 and early 2012.  

61. 
The Joint IDA-IMF Staff Advisory Note (JSAN) concluded that the MGDS II 
presented a clear analysis of the challenges but given limited resources needed to be further 
prioritized, sequenced, and costed. The plans need to be more clearly linked to the budget, the 
MTEF, and the three-year rolling Public Sector Investment Program (PSIP). The poverty analysis 
also needs to be updated with the findings from the recent IHS III. The JSAN noted that the 
macroeconomic framework for MGDS II also needed to be updated because it did not adequately 
reflect either developments in the past year or recent policy changes. While the MGDS II highlights 

20 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Malawi Country Assistance Strategy FY13–16 

risks to growth and poverty reduction from Malawi’s vulnerability to external shocks, further 
elaboration is needed on such endogenous risks as inadequate policy response, inadequate 
implementation capacity, lack of capacity to steer reforms, and the political risks related to the 2014 
elections. Staff recommended that the first Annual Progress Report address these issues, emphasizing 
M&E issues.  

Africa’s Future and WBG Support  

62. 
The CAS is aligned with the Bank’s Africa Regional Strategy which has two pillars—
competitiveness and employment, and vulnerability and resilience—and is built on a 
foundation of governance and public sector capacity. Regional solutions are one of the special 
themes, which the Malawi CAS mirrors. The first theme in the CAS addresses competitiveness and 
employment by improving Malawi’s business environment, easing infrastructure constraints, and 
increasing the competitiveness of skilled labor and a diversified economy. The second theme of both 
the CAS and the regional strategy deals with enhancing capacity, lowering vulnerability—notably for 
women—and enhancing resilience. Finally, the third theme of the CAS, public sector governance, 
corresponds directly, via its dual focus on the supply and demand sides and its concern for formal 
and informal accountability mechanisms, to the approach of the Regional Strategy to addressing the 
foundational challenge of strengthening governance and public sector capacity. The CAS responds to 
corporate priorities, such as including the governance and anticorruption (GAC) agenda. Regional 
approaches are integrated in the CAS in both analytical and financing activities. 

Lessons Learned from the Previous CAS  

63. 
This CAS draws on lessons from its predecessor (FY07-FY12) as detailed in the CAS 
Completion Report (see Annex 2). The completion report concluded that the CAS was well-aligned 
with and relevant to the MGDS goals, priorities, and themes, which reinforced government 
commitment. This enhanced the effectiveness of the Bank Group’s contributions to Malawi’s 
development goals, the importance of which was evident in the evaluation of the previous CAS; 
when commitment to reform and good governance deteriorated in 2010 and 2011, achievements for 
both the MGDS I and the CAS went down. The new CAS (FY13-16) is therefore also aligned with 
the government program embodied in the MGDS II. In putting together the CAS, it was clear that 
consultations with civil society and other stakeholders, such as the media and the private sector, 
should not only be continued but expanded because they offer an alternative voice. Because 
weaknesses in government capacity had slowed project implementation, financial management, 
procurement, project management, and M&E should be addressed in the new CAS. Experiences from 
the Education and HIV Pools also informed the WBG of the significant need for comprehensive 
fiduciary support, especially in sector-wide approaches, which are central to the government policy 
on integration of project implementation units. An important lesson was that programmatic 
approaches can help to leverage resources; the emphasis on programmatic approaches helped to 
ensure consistency in sector reforms and to leverage resources from other DPs in a harmonized way 
that can increase the impact of sector and budget funds while reducing transaction costs significantly.

CAS Stakeholder Consultations 

64. 
In the two years before this CAS was drafted, two sets of consultations were 
undertaken with a range of stakeholders. The first set took place during President Mutharika’s 
administration and the second during the administration of President Banda. Nine government 
priorities informed the first draft of the Concept Note. Discussions were also held with the private 
sector, civil society, academia, government institutions, and DPs. Throughout the process, the World 
Bank Africa Strategy was also discussed. In most consultations, agriculture, the macro-economy, and 
public sector governance were identified as areas requiring more WBG support. Some stakeholders 
were concerned about the small resource envelope for Malawi considering the challenges that need to 
be addressed. Stakeholders also reviewed the proposed program; they recommended rescheduling 
some analytical work to be done earlier (e.g., work on PFM), undertaking more analysis of land 
issues, and strengthening synergies with other DPs. The change in administration necessitated 
another round of consultations with government after the priorities were redrawn. Based on the 
MGDS II, the Banda administration held a National Debate on the Economy in Mangochi in July 
2012 that recommended streamlining the MGDS II priorities to focus more on economic recovery. 
The five priority areas identified were agriculture commercialization, energy, mining, tourism, and 
infrastructure further elaborated in the Economic Recovery Plan (ERP) launched in October 2012. In 
consultations with the Banda administration, it was agreed that the CAS was generally in line with 
government priorities as re-defined at the National Debate and the ERP. The Bank Group was asked 
to help meet the more acute challenges by giving priority to such issues as energy and higher 
education. DPs pointed out that Malawi’s problems had not changed with the regime change, so the 
CAS was still responsive to Malawi’s needs (see Annex 7 for consultation details). 

The 2010 Country Client Survey  

65. 
The survey showed noteworthy improvements in perceptions of the impact of the 
World Bank programs compared to the 2006 survey. The Bank’s strategy of alignment with 
country priorities was considered appropriate, but the survey results also underscored a need to 
strengthen outreach to stakeholders, enhance engagement with civil society and NGOs, foster more 
partnerships with decentralized actors and the private sector, and articulate more forcefully the 
rationale for its engagements and activities in Malawi. The most critical priorities were identified as 
government effectiveness, governance, growth, education, and agricultural productivity (coupled 
with food security). Stakeholders made it clear that they thought that in Malawi it would be most 
productive for the Bank to focus on education, economic growth, and infrastructure.  

Response to the 2012 World Development Report: Mainstreaming Gender 

66. 
The WBG will support Malawi in promoting the country’s goal of attaining gender 
balance in all sectors and programs. A gender portfolio review shows that in FY11 (baseline), 42 
percent of all current lending operations and projects had a gender-responsive design (50 percent 
includes at least one sex-disaggregated indicator). The Malawi program is producing specific gender 
outcomes in the areas of analytical work (80 percent of the WBG’s analytical and advisory work is 
22 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Malawi Country Assistance Strategy FY13–16 

gender-sensitive); policy dialogue (e.g., land and social safety); equal access to services; income and 
financial markets, and capacity building. The gender program responds to six of the eight policy 
areas of the Malawi National Gender Program (NGP): education and training, health, HIV/AIDS, 
food and nutrition security, natural resources and environmental management, and poverty 
eradication and economic empowerment. Overall, the CAS will target an empirically-based gender-
informed approach to reducing poverty in Malawi with gender explicitly and appropriately 
incorporated into operations and analytical work. For instance, operations will incorporate rigorous 
impact evaluations to assess the gender-disaggregated effects of these interventions (see Annex 6 for 
proposed approaches to mainstreaming gender). 

Linking Knowledge to Results 

67. 
The CAS is premised on full commitment to achieving results. The results specified are 
aligned with the government’s own priorities as articulated in the MGDS II and are fully supported 
by such Bank activities as the continuing portfolio of projects, proposed new lending, current and 
planned AAA, TFs, IFC instruments, and partnerships with DPs. The WBG considers it important to 
translate the outcomes of numerous impact evaluations that are monitoring actual results into the 
continuing program and linking knowledge learned back into operational design to improve the final 
results (see Box 3).  

Box 3:  Applying Knowledge to Improve Development Goals 

Impact evaluations (IEs) in Malawi produce information for improving both policy and operations. By empirically 
testing the effectiveness of policy alternatives and scaling up those that perform best, IEs will improve the 
effectiveness of WBG programs. The IEs are designed in strategic thematic areas aligned with the CAS, such as 
improving skills for employability and productivity, barriers to savings and lending, and increasing the productivity 
of farmers. Malawi currently benefits from over 10 IEs supported by the WBG. As a result of the evidence provided 
through IEs, for instance, the current CAS has scaled up WBG support for communication strategies to inform 
smallholder farmers about new technologies, land policies and administration to improve investment in land 
redistribution, and financial literacy to improve account management and individual earnings for vulnerable 
communities, especially women.  

IFC is strengthening Monitoring and Evaluation of its Services engagements, which continuously feeds back 
experience into the design of new advisory programs.   On the investment side, IFC's Development Outcomes 
Tracking System (DOTS) underpins the IFC Development Goals, which are increasingly driving the investment 
choices that IFC makes, and influences project structuring. 

Collaboration with the Development Research Group (DECRG) ensures high-quality research and helps to build 
local capacity to produce systematic evidence-based information about what actually improves the lives of the poor. 
The new CAS will support IEs that are operationally-driven and fill knowledge gaps in the portfolio. Sector teams 
will work closely with researchers in DECRG and local research institutions early in design of programs to draw up 
appropriate research protocols. Areas of collaboration include evaluations to improve targeting of public works 
programs, identify cost-effective methods for providing early childhood development programs, and designing 
mechanisms for conditional cash transfers and bursaries to improve education outcomes. With the results of the 
nationally representative IHS3 2010/11 data and the planned Integrated Household Panel Survey 2013 to track and 
re-interview about one-quarter of the IHS3 sample, Malawi is included in three cross-country microeconomic 
research programs on (i) understanding the extent and drivers of gender differences in agricultural productivity and 

23 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Malawi Country Assistance Strategy FY13–16 

technology adoption in sub-Saharan Africa; (ii) links between different forms of household involvement in 
agricultural activities and nutrition outcomes; and (iii) facts and myths in sub-Saharan African agriculture. The 
research is led by the Living Standards Measurement Study (LSMS) team within the DECRG-Poverty and 
Inequality (DECPI) unit. The LSMS team has already commissioned research studies on the FISP to evaluate its 
targeting and its effects on crop land allocation decisions, agricultural productivity in general and gender differences 
in agricultural productivity in particular, and household welfare. The drafts of Malawi-specific case studies from the 
research programs and FISP-related empirical papers are expected to be ready by the end of FY13. 

Close collaboration with government counterparts will ensure that research findings translate into policy.  The 
WBG teams will work closely with government counterparts through formal training, networking within and across 
countries with a large community of practitioners, and learning-by-doing through joint government-WBG 
evaluations. The collaborative and participatory process ensures that IEs reflect the learning priorities of government 
and the information feeds back into the policy process. The communities of practice will build upon established 
impact evaluation teams in the ministries of Education, Health, and Agriculture.

Principles of the CAS 
68. 
The basic principles for the new CAS are thus to: 
i. 
ensure that the WBG strategy is demand-driven, aligned with the priorities and 
objectives of the government as articulated in the MGDS II and ERP, and supports 
interventions that are both technically and politically feasible. 
build on past experience and draw on lessons from previous and current Bank and 
IFC-supported programs in Malawi and elsewhere. 
be selective in choosing proposed engagement areas that build on the WBG’s 
strengths and comparative advantages, other assistance programs, and the 
absorptive and implementation capacity of Malawi. 15 
fully embrace the harmonization agenda; work with DPs and counterparts guided 
by the successor to the Development Assistance Strategy (2006–2011); and 
emphasize strategic sectoral approaches by preparing joint diagnostics, action 
plans, and (preferably) sector-wide approaches, with harmonized financing 
modalities to reduce transaction costs. 
v. work through and build up country systems to the extent possible. 
vi. 
engage with civil society, private actors, NGOs, academia, and the media in 
designing, implementing, monitoring, and validating the WBG’s engagements (see 
Box 4).  
69. 
The guiding principle is the focus on harmonized structures and funding modalities to 
help Malawi to push forward country systems and the aid coordination agenda. Budget support 
will be used selectively to advance reforms in sectors where the WBG has or plans to be involved 
through its investment operations if there is enough traction and a supportive macroeconomic 
environment. The CAS is strategic, proposing both short- and long-term measures. It is pragmatic, 
concentrating on areas where government commitment is clear and there are obvious entry points. 

15 Annex 5 lists the division of labor among DPs. There are a number of very important sectors, including health 
(except HIV/AIDS/nutrition) and transport (other than rural feeder roads and regional transport integration), where 
the WBG is no longer engaged.

Malawi Country Assistance Strategy FY13–16 

Box 4:  Engaging Stakeholders with the CAS 

The CAS was developed through a highly consultative process involving a variety of stakeholders from the 
grassroots to other DPs. Implementation will also require continuing engagement with stakeholders, as guided by 
CAS Principles 4 and 6 (para 69) that stipulate collaborating with other DPs and reaching out to civil society 
organizations (CSOs), private actors, NGOs, academia, and the media at all points. 

Engaging DPs: Lessons from the previous CAS show that collaborating with others in knowledge work enriches the 
product, broadens ownership of findings and recommendations, and strengthens the platform on which DPs can base 
their advice to government and inform their own operations. This collaborative approach will therefore continue in 
such activities as Country Economic Memorandums (CEMs), Country Status Reports (CSRs), and Public 
Expenditure Reports (PERs). The WBG will also collaborate with others in financing operations through SWAps 
and other co-financing arrangements, and participate in a common approach to budget support. This will further 
strengthen joint accountability for results. 

Engaging all other stakeholders: Informed by the previous CAS Completion Report, which observed that civil 
society, private sector, and the media offer useful contributions in implementation or influencing the environment, 
the new CAS will scale up involvement of these stakeholders in Bank and IFC-supported operations where 
appropriate. The new CAS has operations that require involvement of grassroots beneficiaries themselves, such as 
those in education, child nutrition, and river basin management. CSOs and the media will be instrumental in raising 
awareness and ensuring accountability and transparency in projects that involve and benefit large numbers. 
Accountability issues are mainstreamed through Theme 3 of the CAS, which will engage stakeholders and build 
their capacity.  

The private sector as an important stakeholder in the CAS will continue to be engaged, especially in evaluation of 
the doing business environment in collaboration with the IFC. It will also participate in relevant AAAs, such as 
FINSCOPE surveys and the CEM; as well as in some investment operations, such as FSTAP-AF and Shire Valley 
Irrigation. The PADs will detail the specific engagement modalities. 

B. 

Proposed WBG Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) 

70. 
To support the Government of Malawi in achieving its MGDS II, the new CAS will 
contribute to Malawi’s efforts toward more diversified, competitive, shock-resilient socioeconomic 
growth in three thematic areas: 

Theme 1: Promoting Sustainable, Diversified, and Inclusive Growth 
Theme 2: Enhancing Human Capital and Reducing Vulnerabilities 
Theme 3: Mainstreaming Governance for Enhanced Development Effectiveness  

Strategic Objectives and Results Areas 

71. 
The CAS results framework is built around three thematic areas with six core results 
areas and seven CAS outcomes. Efforts to reach the objectives will be supported by Bank financing 
(lending and grants), AAA (ESW and non-lending TA), Bank-managed trust funds, policy advice, 
IFC investment and advisory services, MIGA support, and close coordination with other DPs. The 
framework also identifies indicators and milestones for each results area and outcome (see Annex 1).  

25 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Malawi Country Assistance Strategy FY13–16 

Theme 1: Promoting Sustainable, Diversified, and Inclusive Growth 

Results Areas and Outcomes 
Results Area: Conducive structural and macroeconomic policies to restore internal and 
external balance 
· 
Outcome 1.1: Improved macroeconomic management 
Results Area: Enabling a business environment that promotes competitiveness and enhances 
productivity 
· 
Outcome 1.2: Improved ease of doing business, through better economic infrastructure, 
regional integration, and access to demand-responsive skills development  
· 
Outcome 1.3: Increased productivity and commercialization of agriculture and sustainable 
management of water resources for multiple uses 

72. 
To accelerate progress in reducing poverty, the WBG will work to help Malawi 
achieve and maintain macroeconomic stability and ensure that growth is more inclusive and 
sustainable. The main barriers to achieving this goal relate to the stability of the economy and 
improving the business environment to promote competitiveness and higher productivity. Building 
on the current macroeconomic and policy environment, in particular the continuing credible and 
orderly external sector adjustment underpinned by an IMF program, the Bank and IFC will support 
efforts to: 
i. 
improve macroeconomic management (especially a prudent fiscal stance and sound monetary 
policies) through more efficient and better targeted public spending, an appropriate exchange 
rate and foreign exchange system, better monitoring of budget planning and execution, and 
effective management of domestic debt;  
enhance the business environment by simplifying business processes; using effective public-
private partnerships (PPPs), especially in agriculture, energy, irrigation, transport, and 
tourism; expanding access to financial services; easing energy and other infrastructure 
constraints; promoting entrepreneurship and increasing skills; and promoting regional 
integration by enhancing access to ports through smoother railway and road connectivity and 
streamlining cross-border customs clearance; and 
diversify the economy and increase productivity, particularly for crops and exports, and build 
land and water resource management and institutional capacity.  

iii. 

ii. 

Results Area: Constructive structural and macroeconomic policies to restore internal and 
external balances 

Outcome 1.1:  Improved Macroeconomic management 

73. 
The World Bank, coordinating with the IMF, will support the government structural 
and macroeconomic policy reforms needed to restore and sustain internal and external 
balances. The Bank will continue to support reforms designed to restore macroeconomic stability, 
accelerate the resumption of growth, and mitigate the impact on vulnerable households of the 
economic adjustment process. Specifically, the Bank will support budget and treasury management 
26 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
Malawi Country Assistance Strategy FY13–16 

reforms to help bring about more efficient and better targeted use of public resources. To improve the 
credibility of the budget, the Bank will support a prudent and transparent approach to budgeting and 
deepen the strategic medium-term perspective for planning and managing public resources. This will 
also help ensure better linkage between policy priorities and the budget by improving multiyear 
budgeting and the quality of public investments. This is expected to help reduce variations in primary 
spending while containing its growth. The effect of these efforts should be to enhance fiscal 
efficiency and effective delivery of services to the poor and the most vulnerable. Among instruments 
to support this outcome are the Rapid Response Development Policy Grant (RRDPG), the new 
Development Policy Operation (DPO) series, the Public Expenditure Review, and the PFEM MDTF.  

Results Area: Enabling a business environment that promotes competitiveness and enhances 
productivity  

Outcome 1.2: Improved ease of doing business through better economic infrastructure, 
regional integration, and access to demand-responsive skills development  

74. 
Improving the business environment in Malawi will require facilitating start-up of both 
formal and informal businesses and employment creation by simplifying business requirements, 
facilitating access to credit, improving public-private dialogue, and removing unnecessary barriers to 
trade, especially nontariff barriers. The Bank and IFC have been working closely with the 
Government of Malawi to address Malawi’s continuing slide in the Doing Business rankings through 
targeted technical assistance on Companies Act reform to simplify business operations and on reform 
of the Insolvency and Secured Transactions/Collateral Registry to address access to finance, 
especially for small and medium enterprises. Work also continues on addressing Malawi’s worst 
Doing Business indicator, trading across borders, where the time, number of documents required, and 
costs are above the regional average. The WBG will continue to support the government’s efforts 
related to the Doing Business Reform Memorandum drafted jointly by the government and the WBG 
Doing Business Reform Unit.  

75. 
In the financial sector, the major goal of the CAS will be to increase the number of 
Malawians who are enrolled in the banking system, especially women (only 17 percent of adult 
women are formally banked; Finscope Survey, 2009). Working closely with DfID and USAID as 
well as other partners, the Bank will use the Financial Sector Technical Assistance Project (FSTAP, 
FY11) and the Malawi Financial Sector Deepening Trust (MFSDT) to achieve this by, e.g., 
promoting mobile technology and branchless banking to increase rural access, putting in place an 
interoperable national switch, and launching financial literacy programs. IFC will continue to build 
its portfolio of funding and technical assistance to the banking sector, aimed primarily at increasing 
access to finance for Small and Medium Enterprises.  The Mining TA Project (FY11) will help to 
improve governance of the mining sector and its contribution to sustainable, diversified, and 
inclusive growth; Bank activity in this area is closely coordinated with the EU and France. 

76. 
Improving economic infrastructure is essential to increase competitiveness and attract 
potential investors. Unreliable power and water supplies and excessive transport costs must be 
addressed. The WBG strategy is to support both analysis and direct project interventions and to 
27 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Malawi Country Assistance Strategy FY13–16 

encourage private investment through PPPs. The Bank and IFC will continue to work closely with 
other DPs supporting the energy sector, notably the MCC, whose program has a substantial energy 
sector governance component, and with the AfDB and other DPs active in the sector. It will also 
coordinate closely with the government’s own investments to build capacity for power generation, 
transmission, and distribution through the current Bank Energy Sector Improvement Project (FY11) 
and through non-lending activities. This project will make the transmission network more efficient, 
reducing losses, and will undertake feasibility studies to attract financing for new hydropower 
schemes. A transmission interconnection link to the SAPP would be one of the fastest solutions to 
Malawi’s serious energy shortages through a Regional Energy Project (FY14/15). The governments 
of Malawi and Mozambique are currently discussing this project, which would revive a 2007 effort. 
In FY13 the Bank will support updating of the 2005 Malawi Transport Cost Study to maximize the 
effectiveness of investments in reducing transport costs. Through the Regional Southern Africa Trade 
and Transport Facilitation Program, Malawi may benefit from regional IDA resources to help finance 
rehabilitation of the North-South Corridor, road safety improvements, activities to mitigate the 
impact of HIV/AIDS on corridor users, and measures to facilitate trade, such as upgrading Malawi’s 
border posts. The safety of Malawi’s paved road network will be assessed with support from the 
Global Road Safety Facility. The WBG will support the government in promoting PPPs to leverage 
resources to address investment deficits in energy, irrigation, transport, water and other sectors 
through transaction-specific support. A screening process, funded by PPIAF, is underway to identify 
candidate projects and help prepare a pipeline of opportunities that will attract investors. The WBG 
and AfDB have established a Joint Infrastructure Unit in recognition of the major investments 
required and the regional complexities of many infrastructure projects in Malawi. The unit (staffed 
by WBG and AfDB personnel, with financial support from DfID) is looking first at transport and 
water projects as well as regional integration.  These upstream initiatives will act as a feeder of 
potential PPP's that IFC's Advisory Services will be able to convert into realized projects.  The 
institutions are thus working closely to ensure adequate feedback loops are in place to improve the 
chances of success, focusing in the first instance on hard infrastructure such as electricity, water, rail, 
and subsequently on social services such as education and health. 

77. 
The benefits to Malawi from regional integration and connectivity are twofold: (i) 
improvement of energy, transport, and telecommunications services, and (ii) commercial 
opportunities offered by regional trade. They are closely linked: more reliable energy will make 
manufacturing and mining more competitive, and efficient cross-border transport links will 
encourage trade, reducing the costs. The WBG will seek to advance regional integration by 
undertaking analytical work on sub-regional growth poles and supporting initiatives to remove 
logistical bottlenecks. A concessionaire currently operates Malawi’s rail network; with PPIAF 
funding and in collaboration with the EU, the WBG is supporting government renegotiation of the 
agreement in order to attract additional investment and improve the service. The Bank is also 
working with the government through the Regional Communications Infrastructure Project (RCIP, 
FY09) to improve international ICT connectivity and sector regulation. Infrastructure improvements 
are being driven by transport needs in both Malawi and the region. The timing of infrastructure 
investments will be influenced by the economic and political scenario. Current investments in the 
Tete coalfields in Mozambique, about 200km from Blantyre, are fuelling unprecedented economic 
growth in the region, providing potential business opportunities for Malawian manufacturers and 
28 

 
 
 
 
Malawi Country Assistance Strategy FY13–16 

service suppliers. For example, Blantyre has a significant manufacturing base; the Tete area does not. 
This and other opportunities will be investigated through a planned regional growth pole TA that will 
cover a number of countries in addition to Malawi and Mozambique (in addition to a Malawi specific 
TA). A Diagnostic Trade Integration Study (DTIS) update is also to be carried out in FY 13. In 
addition, with the recent launch of an Accelerated Program for Economic Integration by the 
Governments of Seychelles, Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique, and Zambia, discussions have begun 
on a possible regional DPO to push forward reforms that will reduce trade barriers. 

78. 
The supply of skilled workers in Malawi is severely inadequate, both quantitatively and 
qualitatively. Success in expanding primary education has put further pressure on a flimsy post-
basic education system. To ensure knowledge-driven economic growth and poverty reduction, the 
Government of Malawi has committed to supporting equitable expansion of post-basic education and 
university and TEVET programs that are directly linked to growth sectors suffering skills shortages. 
The government has asked the WBG to help draw up strategies to ensure more efficient and strategic 
use of government funds and to introduce a transparent and objective mechanism to allocate public 
funds to higher education institutions that put in place programs in areas that the private sector will 
not cover, while also increasing capacity and provision of post-secondary education through private 
sources. The WBG will support this objective through comprehensive analyses of the 2009 
Enterprise Survey and the skills development needs that underpin a new operation, the Higher 
Education and Skills Development Project (FY14). The proposed project will concentrate on getting 
the skills development system closer to the labor market by consulting industry groups in key growth 
areas on designing a more rational and effective model for financing higher education, revising 
standards and curricula, establishing a forceful quality assurance system, and building both national 
and institutional management capacities. Close collaboration with DfID, the ILO, AfDB, and other 
DPs is envisaged.  

Outcome 1.3: Increased productivity and commercialization of agriculture and sustainable 
management of water resources for multiple uses  

79. 
Transformation and modernization of smallholder agriculture is at the core of the new 
Agricultural Sector Wide Approach (ASWAp), which was formulated under CAADP auspices 
and constitutes the reference investment framework shared by the government and DPs. Following 
the ASWAp, the Bank and IFC will promote inclusive smallholder-based growth with the objective 
of modernizing and transforming the smallholder subsistence farming system into commercial and 
market-oriented agriculture. However, among the barriers to agricultural transformation are low 
productivity, very small land holdings with insecure tenure, recurrent drought, lack of access to 
financial services and to market information, and scarce and expensive transport to markets. IFC is 
already engaging in providing capital and advisory services targeted at medium-sized farmers who 
have the potential to move quickly from subsistence farming into commercial agriculture and to act 
as leaders through integrated assistance packages to commercial banks in Malawi. 

80. 
The WBG support for transforming smallholder agriculture will address critical 
structural challenges by giving priority to the following: 

29 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Malawi Country Assistance Strategy FY13–16 

• 

• The efficiency and balance of public investments in agriculture, through an Agriculture Public 
Expenditures Review (AgPER) that will evaluate the outcomes of the entire agricultural program 
and special initiatives such as the Farm Input Subsidy program (FISP). The combination of the 
this AgPER with a DfID-funded impact evaluation of FISP will provide valuable information 
about the efficiency and relevance of the fertilizer and seed subsidy and should facilitate well-
informed discussion of the objectives and design of the FISP.  
Increasing the productivity of maize and rice in particular to improve food security: (i) support 
scaling up current research and extension activities (under the Agricultural Sector Wide 
Approach – Support Project Additional Financing (ASWAp-SP AF) and the eventual MDTF) 
and (ii) expand rehabilitation and construction of new irrigation schemes and also help build 
capacity for investment planning for irrigation.  
• Diversifying, by scaling up investments in legume production (groundnuts, soya beans, pigeon 
peas), which is important for diversifying household diets as well as providing income 
opportunities, and by opening up new export windows, especially within the region’s markets. 
Increasing the availability of legume seed is the first priority in building this supply chain.  IFC is 
currently exploring additional support to an existing client in this sector (ETG). 
• Commercializing agriculture by improving access to market through more efficient and 
coordinated planning of tertiary, district, and community road improvements and maintenance 
geared to the volumes of production that must be transported. Improvements to the business 
environment through a focused IFC Investment Climate advisory engagement should also 
facilitate expansion of contract farming arrangements between private agribusiness investors and 
smallholders to control production, facilitate market access, and promote produce quality that 
meets international standards.  Furthermore, IFC will explore opportunities for private provision 
of bulk storage facilities and warehouse receipts programs to enhance access to market 
infrastructure and value chain liquidity. 
• Land policy and land tenure for an efficient agribusiness environment, especially for 
smallholders; this will certainly require an efficient land market where tenure security is 
guaranteed, and processing of land transfer transactions is transparent, fair, and efficient, and 
structural constraints do not limit access to markets. Larger average land holding size will 
certainly speed transformation of the traditional subsistence farming system into a modernized, 
diversified, and market-oriented agriculture.  

81. 
The World Bank (with co-financing from the Government of Norway) previously 
contributed to the elaboration of the ASWAp and is supporting it through the ASWAp-SP 
(FY08), which is designed to improve the effectiveness of investments in food security and 
sustainable agricultural growth. In FY12 the WBG approved additional financing to increase the 
impact of the ASWAp-SP on smallholder productivity by scaling up research and extension activities 
and improving market access through improvement and sustainable management of feeder roads. The 
new financing is complemented by funding from other DPs through an MDTF. A regional project 
(FY13) will also promote agricultural productivity by creating regional centers of excellence in 
research and development (R&D) in Malawi, Zambia, and Mozambique.  

30 

 
 
 
 
 
 
Malawi Country Assistance Strategy FY13–16 

82. 
The Irrigation, Rural Livelihoods, and Agricultural Development Project (IRLADP, 
FY06) has benefitted from additional financing from the Rapid Response Program (FY13) for 
scaling-up activities such as the input-for-assets program to cushion the effect of the crisis on the 
rural poor and enhance the developmental impact of irrigation. It will also consolidate the gains 
achieved so far with water user associations and irrigation services and prepare for future irrigation 
investments. 

83. 
These operations will be followed by an ASWAp-SP Phase 2 or Agricultural 
Commercialization and Rural Growth Project (FY15) focusing more on the diversification and 
commercialization objectives. This follow-up ASWAp-SP will be a consolidated operation linking 
agricultural commercialization, research and extension, the business environment for private 
investments, improved agricultural water management, and sustainable rural access. It could be 
complemented by investments in land issues, especially in improving land administration and 
facilitating land redistribution to smallholders through targeted actions based on the impact 
evaluation of the Community-Based Rural Land Development Project. Of course, given different 
sector orientations, multi-sector operations face many difficulties in areas like implementation 
arrangements. However, with careful design, a consolidated operation is likely to lead to better and 
more sustainable outcomes than a large number of small stand-alone operations that are not well-
coordinated. Central to success for such projects is clear allocation of responsibilities for activities to 
appropriate sectors, with a steering committee to oversee progress. A similar approach has been 
successful elsewhere in the region.  

84. 
Future investments in agricultural commercialization and agribusiness development 
will be conceived in a growth pole approach supported by irrigation development to enable 
productivity growth and high-return agriculture. One proposed significant investment would 
expand irrigation in the Shire Valley (Shire Valley Irrigation Project, FY16), where large scale 
market-led irrigation has the potential to transform the region. Where the area is currently among the 

poorest in Malawi, with the appropriate investments and support, the climatic, agro-ecological, transport 
and market conditions would enable a radical transformation of this area into a high productive growth 
pole with regional significance. If successfully implemented and drawing in significant investments in the 
value chains, this would not only provide local farming households the opportunity to improve their 
livelihoods, but also attract investments and become a source of added value and export earnings. 

Proceeding with this operation will depend on macroeconomic performance and the business 
environment because it does require large scale private-sector participation.   This investment is 

currently envisioned as a PPP with involvement of both IFC and MIGA and collaboration with other 
development banks, including in preparations already with the African Development Bank. IFC's 

involvement in this operation will enable the WBG to test market appetite and feed reactions back 
into the project design.  

85. 
Improving sustainable access to water through an integrated water management 
system, addressing increasingly conflicting economic and social demands on water resources, 
and enabling collaborative planning for growth are MGDS goals that the CAS will support. 
Especially in the Shire Basin, critical planned developments will put large demands on the system; at 
the same time attention is urgently needed to management of climate and resource variability and the 
31 

 
 
 
 
 
 
Malawi Country Assistance Strategy FY13–16 

deterioration of supporting ecosystems that undermines the resources on which growth is founded. 
To enable sustained economic growth in different water-dependent sectors and protect the resource 
base, the WBG, the government, and other DPs are working together to harmonize and implement 
Malawi’s new Water Resources Investment Strategy (2011); build the infrastructure necessary for 
enabling and sustaining economic growth in water-using sectors; and promote integrated planning 
and building basin institutions for making decisions on water allocation and investment. Milestones 
for the water and natural resources planning sector include setting up a collaborative planning 
framework for management and development of the Shire Basin; better hydro-meteorological 
systems and real-time decision-making support for basin water allocation and release strategies; 
upgrading the Kamuzu Barrage, which regulates flow in the Shire River and makes it possible to 
increase average firm production in the Shire cascade of hydropower plants and other uses; 
increasing the irrigated area in the basin; and better management of the water supply for Blantyre. 
The WBG will support detailed design and scoping for financing development of water resources to 
augment water supply to the major cities and towns, most prominently Blantyre/Limbe and 
Lilongwe, where urbanization and industrial growth are reaching the limits of current capacity. These 
investments will be pursued to harness resources most efficiently for multiple benefits, such as 
energy production, irrigated agriculture, fisheries, industry, transport, and water supply, working 
through the National Water Development Program (FY07), the Shire River Basin Management 
Project (Phase I; FY12), and support for regional dialogue. They will also build on strategic planning 
and design work carried out under the National Water Development Program and Global Facility for 
Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR)–funded disaster risk management work.

86. 
The government is committed to accelerating progress toward the MGDS and 
enhancing Malawi’s human resources. The MGDS II stresses the need to improve delivery of 
social services in education, health, nutrition, youth development, and water and sanitation. The 
government is also committed to integrating into the development process climate change mitigation 
and adaptation and natural resource and environmental management. The WBG will selectively 
support elements of these efforts. 

87. 
Improving the effectiveness, efficiency, and equity of health care delivery is vital. Main 
bottlenecks are 
the management and distribution of human resources, management and 
accountability for health system finances, the supply chain for pharmaceuticals and medical supplies, 
and the quality of service. The Bank’s HIV/AIDS and nutrition operations are designed to achieve 
specific measurable outcomes while helping to address system-wide concerns. HIV/AIDS and 
nutrition interventions will focus on the capacity to work effectively with other sectors, such as 
agriculture, education, and social protection, to ensure an integrated approach to improving the health 
and nutrition of Malawians.

88. Malawi has the lowest learning outcomes in the region. Since most Malawians are likely 
to be working on family farms or in the informal sector, providing them with fundamental reading 
and numeracy skills is critical. Rigorous analysis in the World Bank’s education country status report 
suggests that inadequate school infrastructure, financial constraints, and exorbitant teacher-pupil 
ratios are factors in the low levels of student learning. The government’s National Education Sector 
Plan (NESP) is structured in terms of the three areas of access and equity, quality, and governance. 
The access dimension covers demand-side interventions that address critical equity issues as well as 
more conventional supply-side interventions in terms of classroom construction and procurement of 
teaching and learning materials. Both the government and DPs recognize that this piecemeal 
approach to planning is highly inefficient and that to be effective changes will require a more 
comprehensive approach. Thus the Ministry of Education, Science, and Technology is working 
closely with the ministries of Agriculture; Youth, Children and Development; and Local Government 
and Rural Development to deliver the goals detailed in its plan. Pooled resources from the WBG, the 
Global Partnership for Education, DfID, the German Development Cooperation (GDC), and 
UNICEF are supporting the NESP. Close collaboration with all other partners that support the 
program with parallel financing, such as USAID, WFP, and JICA, will continue through the SWAp. 

89. 
The National Nutrition Policy and Strategic Plan (2007–2012) is being reviewed in light 
of new developments and increased donor support. CIDA, Irish Aid, USAID, UNICEF, EU, and 
the FAO, among other DPs, have expressed keen interest in supporting the nutrition policy agenda 
through consolidated community-based programs in order to prevent and control the most common 
nutrition disorders, particularly among vulnerable groups. The Bank participates in the Donor 
Nutrition Security Support Group to leverage and harmonize support. It will address governance 
failures by strengthening the capacity of the government and its partners to scale up programs to 
improve access to nutrition information and services to prevent growth faltering in early childhood. 
An Infant and Child Feeding Study (FY11) provided valuable analytical and policy insights and 
helped guide project design.  

90. 
The WBG proposes to continue supporting the objectives of the National HIV/AIDS 
Strategic Plan (NSP) (2011-2016) that prioritize reducing new infections as being critical to 
mitigate the burden of the epidemic. Support through the Multi-sectoral AIDS Project (MAP) is 
continued under the follow-on operation (Nutrition, HIV, and AIDS Project, FY12) which also 
contributes to a pool arrangement. The HIV Pool is administered by the National AIDS Commission. 
The Bank will use the Nutrition, HIV, and AIDS Project to earmark pool funding for the prevention 
programs that have the greatest impact on new HIV infections, building upon and complementing the 
effort supported by the US President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). The project is 
emphasizing the scaling up of voluntary medical male circumcision and neonatal circumcision; 
reducing pediatric infections by increasing access to prevention-of-mother-to-child-transmission 
programs; improving access to male and female condoms; preventing unwanted pregnancies among 
women living with HIV; promoting early infant diagnosis; and reducing transmission of, and 
morbidity from, sexually transmitted infections. Participation in the HIV Pool has permitted the Bank 
to discuss with representatives of the health sector reforms to strengthen the system and Malawi’s 
capacity to manage and implement the national response across the country through better M&E, 
supply chain management; and health care waste management. The IDA contribution to the HIV 
34 

 
 
 
 
 
Malawi Country Assistance Strategy FY13–16 

Pool complements treatment activities provided outside the pool by the Global Fund to Fights AIDS, 
Tuberculosis and Malaria.  

91. 
Design of the Nutrition, HIV, and AIDS Project was informed by analytic work on 
nutrition conducted in Malawi with Bank support, by assessments of experience from similar 
Bank-funded operations elsewhere in Africa, and by the evidence base for interventions to reduce 
HIV incidence, such as lessons learned from past projects in Malawi. Rather than depending on 
Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) indicators collected every five years, the project will use a 
more selective set of program-based indicators which will allow for closer monitoring. 

92. 
The National Water Development Program has attracted financing from eight DPs in 
addition to the World Bank (Second National Water Development Project, FY07, with 
additional financing in FY11), and the government wishes to further ensure coordination through a 
SWAp arrangement. The program has already brought over 600,000 people improved water and 
sanitation services and is committed to supplying 2.2 million people before it ends in 2015—it was 
scaled up with significant additional financing in FY11. A water, urban development, and municipal 
services AAA is proposed for later in the CAS period to support the national city development and 
slum upgrading program (being planned with support from Cities Alliance) and the drafting of City 
Development Strategies in a number of cities. Malawi is expected to continue to urbanize rapidly at 
an estimated 5.3 percent annually (one of the highest rates in the world, though from a very low 
base), yet the country is ill-prepared to manage the change. At the current rate, by 2050 Malawi’s 
urban population would balloon by 48 percent. 

Results Area: Lowering vulnerability and enhancing resilience 

Outcome 2.2: Improved resilience for poor communities through adequate social safety nets, 
improved climate resilience, and enhanced capacity to respond to disaster risks 

93. 
During the CAS period, the WBG will help to reinforce and rationalize Malawi’s social 
support programs into a coherent productive social safety net system to protect the extreme 
poor (both urban and rural), especially during natural disasters and other shocks. The WBG advice 
will be in line with the World Bank Global Social Protection and Labor Strategy and the Africa 
Social Protection Strategy, helping to design a comprehensive and equitable social protection system 
that will guide Malawi’s most vulnerable people in becoming more resilient to shocks, including 
climate changes, and to create better opportunities for the poor. Built on Malawi’s new Social 
Support Policy, approved in 2012, and on more than 10 years of experience in social support 
programs through the Malawi Social Action Fund (MASAF), a comprehensive social support and 
safety net system should provide cost-effective social welfare and care to marginalized groups, such 
as the disabled and especially vulnerable children, and support active labor market and employment 
programs. 

94. 
In support of the bold economic stabilization program Malawi initiated in April and 
May 2012, the Bank in July 2012 approved a US$150 million Rapid Response Program (RRP) 
comprising a Rapid Response Development Policy Grant (RRDPG) and two additional financing 
35 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Malawi Country Assistance Strategy FY13–16 

operations: the Malawi Social Action Fund 3 (MASAF 3 APL II) and the Rural Livelihood and 
Agriculture Development Project (IRLADP). Both MASAF and IRLAD are active, expanding their 
programs and helping to mitigate the impact on vulnerable households of the legacy of inflationary 
pressures and economy rebalancing. Assistance to both rural and urban vulnerable households (by 
expanding labor-intensive public works) and poor farming communities (by scaling up support to 
productive rural livelihoods through irrigation) increases the incomes of a large number of 
households, enabling them to better manage shocks and to build household assets. The Bank will 
also, through a proposed AAA, conduct IEs of the MASAF 3 APL II Public Works Program; 
disseminate the recommendations of the targeting study, which includes establishing a harmonized 
social safety net system, a unified targeting strategy, including policy to harmonize targeting across 
programs; and update the 2001 Social Safety Net Review to inform preparation of MASAF 4 
(FY15). The Bank will continue to use its programs to leverage resources, as it did for MASAF 3 
APL II: AfDB is now supporting the project’s economic program for the poor under the Community 
Savings and Investment Program. Other DPs working with the Bank are UNICEF, Irish Aid, DfID, 
the EU, and KfW. 

95. While Bank-financed projects are already supporting sustainable land and water 
management and conservation agriculture (ASWAp-SP, IRLAD, NWDP II, Shire River Basin 
Management Project), the approach today is to put in place a more integrated sustainable 
development portfolio of investments that consolidate the ecological, economic, and social 
dimensions of sustainability. Planned CAS projects will explore new mechanisms to integrate the 
activities of current projects. This is reflected in the targeting of basin and regional development 
planning, coupled with recognition of the need to better share knowledge and to monitor and evaluate 
aggregate impacts in order to link micro, meso, and macro planning areas. Specifically, the WBG is 
working to improve rural livelihoods and natural resources management nationally and regionally in 
critical catchments through the Shire River Basin Management Project (FY12) as well as through 
agriculture investments as part of the ASWAp program. Projects specifically targeting biodiversity 
and natural habitats are the Global Environment Facility (GEF) Nkhotakota Wildlife Reserve Project 
and the GEF Nyika Trans-Frontier Conservation Area Project. National management and investment 
will be considered in regional dialogue on better management of shared resources in the Shire and 
Lake Basins (linking where appropriate with Zambezi Basin cooperation initiatives). The additional 
financing approved for the IRLAD Project, will not only expand the social safety net through rural 
investments in resilience, largely by expanding mini-scale irrigation nationwide through the inputs-
for-assets subprogram wide, it will also help prepare the way for similar new investments.  

96. 
Assistance will focus on both being better prepared for and mitigating vulnerabilities to 
climate change and disaster risks. The Malawi Disaster Risk Management program (outlined in the 
Country DRM Plan and the multi-donor National Climate Change Program) will address climate and 
disaster risk challenges through a mix of analytic work, lending, and technical assistance. DRM will 
focus on support for realization of an Action Plan for Integrated Flood Risk Management in the Shire 
Valley, enhanced capacity for damage and loss assessments, disaster risk financing, and capacity to 
deal with seismic risk. The focus for climate change adaptation will be on assessing the potential and 
requirements for Malawi to access carbon finance, analyzing the contribution that better land and 
forest management could make to both climate mitigation and adaptation, making climate 
36 

 
 
 
 
 
Malawi Country Assistance Strategy FY13–16 

information more widely available, and weather forecasting. Support will increasingly go to 
mainstreaming the findings of analytical and advisory tasks through the WBG’s lending portfolio. 
The WBG will also seek opportunities for follow-up climate and DRM financing through Bank-
managed trust funds, cooperation with DPs, and regional initiatives. In particular, the Shire River 
Basin Management Project provides opportunities for improving climate and disaster resilience; it is 
concerned with both flood and land management issues in the Shire, where certain areas have some 
of the highest climate-related disaster risks in the country. The project is expected to partly finance 
the Action Plan for Integrated Flood Risk Management and to apply lessons from assessments of the 
Climate Change Program and activities related to catchment management and strengthening 
hydromet systems.

Theme 3: Mainstreaming Governance for Enhanced Development Effectiveness  
Results Areas and Outcomes: 
Results Area: Improving public sector management systems  
· 
Outcome 3.1: Improved public sector performance because of better PFM, procurement, and 
M&E systems and enhanced statistics  
Results Area: Strengthening social accountability for service provision 
· 
Outcome 3.2: Enhanced transparency on resource flows and service delivery  

97. 
The governance arrangements that underpin service delivery are central to the ability 
to effectively design and implement the CAS. The WBG will provide support to strategies for 
improving governance in order to enhance development effectiveness. This theme comprises a cross-
cutting effort to help strengthen both supply-side and demand-side institutions, with an emphasis on 
mainstreaming enhanced governance across the portfolio. The supply side comprises governance 
mechanisms through which the government organizes itself to deliver on the strategy. On the demand 
side, the CAS adopts  strategic incrementalism, targeting entry points where there are client demand 
and alliances for change and piloting smaller local initiatives and scaling them up as demand for 
them emerges. This takes into account previous results that demonstrate that gains in this area come 
incrementally and depend on client demand, and the WBG will respond to recent government 
engagement on these issues. The demand side comprises the macro- and micro- institutional 
arrangements that assure accountability, especially arrangements that facilitate citizen engagement in 
design, implementation, and oversight. This will include a context analysis for selecting demand-side 
governance instruments aligned with the political context and space to ensure that the instruments are 
tailored to the country’s governance and operating environment.  

Results Area: Improving public sector management systems 

Outcome 3.1: Improved public sector performance because of better PFM, procurement, and 
M&E systems and enhanced statistics systems 

98. 
The WBG is stepping up partnerships with DPs and the government to further refine 
Malawi’s PFM system. The government has put in place a medium-term Public Finance and 
Economic Management Reform Program (PFEM RP) covering a broad range: planning and policy 
analysis, resource mobilization, budgeting, procurement, accounting and financial management, cash 
and debt management, parastatal financing, reporting, auditing, and PFEM RP administration. A 
common-basket support mechanism has been designed; the MDTF will be administered by the IDA 
and executed by the government. During the CAS period, the Bank will work with the government to 
strengthen its procurement management capacity, transparency, and accountability and monitor large 
contracts in the eight top-spending ministries and departments (Agriculture, Education, Health, 
Transport and Public Works, Irrigation and Water Development, ESCOM, the Roads Authority, and 
the Malawi Housing Corporation). The Bank will further assist the government, especially the Office 
of the Director of Public Procurement, to reinforce M&E of public procurement, complaint handling 
systems in all procuring entities, and contract management capabilities; pilot independent contract 
monitoring by CSOs; carry out on-site training courses for procurement staff; institutionalize 

38 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Malawi Country Assistance Strategy FY13–16 

procurement planning as part of the budget process; and prepare simple bidding documents for local 
government and community procurement. 

99. 
Through both lending and non-lending TA to support implementation of a government-
wide, results-oriented M&E system, the WBG will enhance the linkages between strategic 
planning and M&E across sectors.  It will also promote M&E transparency by expanding access to 
information. The intent is to build demand for and effective supply and use of M&E information by 
institutionalizing use of M&E across government. To do so the WBG will support design of a 
government-wide M&E system that is technically feasible and not overly complex and that will be 
built incrementally as demand arises, accompanied by the necessary capacity-building. Support for 
M&E and government transparency and accountability will also entail better statistics, particularly in 
terms of data quality. The government is preparing a new statistical development strategy and needs 
support for its application, mainly through donor harmonization (basket financing, e.g., with 
Norway). The strategy is expected to be translated into a statistical action plan that is timed, 
budgeted, and actionable and clearly identifies a small number of major objectives: e.g., introduction 
of the new System of National Accounts 2008 standard (SNA08); upgrading of NSO software and 
hardware to better manage application of the new standards; and provision of constant online access 
to major regional and international statistical resources. A variety of issues will then be jointly 
addressed through a possible Public Sector Performance Project (FY14), which could include support 
for reinforcing performance of the civil service, M&E, and statistics.  

100. WBG engagement will include analytical work on public sector management, both 
cross-cutting and by sector. Following up on country- and sector-wide political economy analysis 
undertaken as part of the previous CAS, the 5th CAS proposes both cross-cutting and sectoral 
political economy work on such topics as decentralization, mining, and the Nacala railway corridor. 
This will include sector-specific work on governance, based on risk assessments. Regarding 
decentralization, AAA will work on design and implementation of a solid fiscal and institutional 
framework, exploring options tailored to the current Malawi context on the basis of international 
good practices, lessons learned, progress made, and continuing challenges. Depending on 
government demand, the WBG and other DPs will again support capacity-strengthening activities to 
enhance both central and local capacity for efficiency, transparency, and accountability and the 
capacity to put in place social safety nets. Support for decentralization might be provided through 
lending (e.g., through the public sector performance project) or non-lending TA and analytical work 
to support decentralization policy. An FY13 policy on decentralization in Malawi recommends 
seizing the opportunity provided by the Local Development Fund to put in place a well-designed 
capital transfer plan to improve service delivery, set local management incentives, and institute a 
demand-driven, well-targeted, and performance-oriented system.

Results Area: Strengthening social accountability for service provision 

Outcome 3.2: Enhanced transparency on resource flows and service delivery  

101. The CAS will mainstream initiatives to enhance transparency across current and new 
WBG-financed operations, using demand-side governance tools to the extent feasible. On the 
basis of work done (see annex 8) and further reflections on lessons learned, mechanisms will be 
selected at the beginning of the CAS period through a context analysis for demand-side governance 
that examines the conceptual framework for social accountability. It will examine not only previous 
social accountability experiences and lessons learned but also the political economy context for 
demand-side governance. It will also evaluate new social accountability mechanisms, their benefits 
and risks, and their potential for helping achieve CAS goals; their fiscal, institutional, and social 
impact; potential for demonstration effects; and potential for being scaled up to enhance the 
sustainability of program interventions in line with local, national, and international lessons learned. 

102. 
 Demand-side governance instruments will be piloted first, mainly at the local and 
sector levels, and then gradually be scaled up in line with government interest. Preliminary 
methods to enhance the transparency of resource flows might include mechanisms that produce and 
make available to citizens and users (on an annual basis) information on (i) the magnitude of 
budgetary transfers to front-line service units and local governments; (ii) the obligations and 
commitments of government in terms of services citizens should expect; and (iii) actual performance 
of front-line service units, in a form that facilitates comparison both across units and relative to 
announced obligations. This area will include support for budget transparency, independent budget 
analysis, citizens’ charters, and possibly sectoral Public Expenditure Tracking Surveys (PETS). To 
pave the way for a positive contribution to Malawian development from the mining sector and 
mitigate the well-known risks that inadequate natural resource management poses for development 
generally, the WBG will make a particular effort to support transparency and an enabling 
environment generally in the mining sector (see Box 5).  

103. Demand-side mechanisms have already been incorporated into the WBG portfolio to 
enhance civil society and user participation, with a view to increasing transparency and 
accountability. This has been particularly important when governance and growth cycles have been 
changing quite radically. Box 6 lists social accountability initiatives currently being implemented and 
Annex 8 sets out plans for the future.  Demand-side governance interventions would benefit from 
better design and more concern for implementation and would in particular benefit from scaling up 
so that over time they can be truly mainstreamed. Careful M&E of demand-side governance 
interventions would also help heighten the impact as these interventions are expanded and 
institutionalized.

Box 5:  WBG Support for Mining Sector Governance Reform and Capacity Building 

Sustainable growth of the mineral sector from its present relatively low-base is not assured but is possible if geology 
campaigns and exploration reveal more resources and projects currently in the pipeline qualify for investment 
decision in the medium term. Indeed, if commodity prices remain high and the recent dynamism in infrastructure 
development is confirmed, a few mining projects could become viable. International experience shows that the right 
frameworks and capacities need to be in place so that when the time comes, the sector will realize its potential 
positive contribution in terms of both fiscal receipts and non-fiscal linkages. Otherwise the sector may have negative 
economic, environmental, or social impacts, as demonstrated by the well-documented “resource curse.” 

To support mining sector management, the Bank program comprises a US$31 million TA project co-financed in 
FY11 by an IDA credit and a European Development Fund (EDF) grant, the objective of which is to improve the 
efficiency, transparency, and sustainability of mining sector management. The project supports government 
improvement in (i) management of mineral rights and operations; (ii) generation and management of mineral 
revenues; and (iii) knowledge and promotion of national mineral resources.  

In practice, the first phase of the project will include the following:  
• 
Installation of a modern computer-based system to address transparency in mineral licensing  
• Develop a Strategic Environmental and Social Assessment (SESA) that make it possible to closely analyze the 
environmental and social challenges of mining and how they are addressed by policies and institutions  
• Finance a countrywide airborne geophysics survey and reinforce the Geological Surveys Department, where 
such information will be open and accessible to all interested parties. Providing access to geological information 
will promote transparency in knowledge and use of Malawi’s natural resources.  
• Offer capacity-building support to key agencies, such as the Ministry of Finance and the Revenue Authority, on 
royalty and tax collection, revenue forecasting, and management of the resulting fiscal flows. 

In parallel, the WBG is also encouraging stakeholders to engage more fully in the sector through formalized 
arrangements for monitoring policy implementation and through support for revenue transparency via the Extractive 
Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), with funding from the EITI-MDTF.  In addition, South-South learning to 
link revenue from mining to human development will be encouraged. 

104. To enhance transparency wherever feasible the CAS will mainstream across the range 
of WBG-financed operations and non-lending work mechanisms that (i) create opportunities for 
users of services to participate in planning, implementation, and oversight of how public resources 
allocated to service delivery are actually used; and (ii) facilitate sharing of information, especially 
since there is no Access to Information Law to make such sharing easier. Mechanisms for 
disseminating information should empower beneficiaries and oversight institutions while building 
government capacity to make information accessible. Such mechanisms include citizens and 
community scorecards (already piloted under the MASAF), participatory planning and budgeting 
exercises, and other social accountability mechanisms. Selected instruments could include the use of 
ICT to elicit feedback on user satisfaction with service delivery, such as social media platforms for 
independent complaint and redress mechanisms; Public-Private Dialogue fora, along the lines of 
those that IFC has successfully sponsored in several other African countries; support to the media by 
training investigative journalists; and support for transparency, oversight, and feedback mechanisms 
to bring citizen concerns more forcefully into the public sphere. Complementing this demand-side 
governance work, the WBG will support, with assistance of WBI and other units, building capacity 

41 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Malawi Country Assistance Strategy FY13–16 

for supporting parliaments and other oversight institutions to complement informal civil society 
social accountability.  

Box 6:  Social Accountability Initiatives in the Current WBG Program 

There have been significant gains in incorporating transparency and citizen participation into Malawi’s 
development programs. For example, important social accountability initiatives within WBG-supported 
programs include: 

• The use of Community Score Cards (CSCs) and Citizen Report Cards by the Malawi Social Action Fund. 
• Within the IRLADP irrigation project, Water Users’ Associations are established and built up to fully 
engage water users in system management and control of the schemes, including financial management, 
and are empowered to engage in monitoring construction progress and quality.  
• Civil society participates in joint annual and semi-annual reviews of the national response to HIV and 
AIDS where technical, financial management, procurement, and grants facility progress are discussed. 
• Under the Nutrition & HIV/AIDS Project, NGOs will be active in community mobilization through 
contractual arrangements between the central Department of Nutrition, HIV and AIDS, and the District 
Council and NGOs.  
• The School Management Committees are responsible, with the head teacher, for submitting school 
improvement plans to district assemblies for inclusion in District Education Plans, as well as for 
management of school grants. 
• Civil society and communities have an explicit role in planning within the Shire River Basin Management 
Program through the Shire River Basin Stakeholder Forum, discussing issues affecting the basin and 
proposing management solutions. Also, catchment and flood risk management activities are giving NGOs a 
key role in both implementation with communities and in process and output monitoring.  
• The Construction Sector Transparency (CoST) Initiative phase I, assisted by the Bank, supports publication 
of information on procurement and fulfillment of construction contracts, allowing the media and civil 
society to take a more active role in monitoring them. Malawi will also participate in phase II of this 
initiative. 
• Representatives of transport infrastructure users and civil society participate in the Transport Joint Sector 
Review meetings. 
• Communities will define priorities for community roads to be improved in the road component of the 
ASWAp.

Implementing the FY13-FY16 WBG Country Assistance Strategy 

105. The WBG is proposing an indicative financing envelope of US$695 million 17 over the 
four years to support engagements under this CAS. Indicative lending and ESW programs are 
included in Annex 10 and 11 respectively.  The amounts shown in outer years are indicative only. 
Actual allocations will depend on (i) the country's own performance; (ii) its performance relative to 
other IDA recipients; (iii) the total amount of resources available to IDA; (iv) any changes in the list 
of IDA-eligible countries; (v) terms of the financial assistance provided (grants or loans); and (vi) the 
amount of compensatory resources received from MDRI.  Despite HIPC debt relief, Malawi is 
vulnerable to moderate debt distress and external shocks even as it attempts to diversify its export 
base. Furthermore, the IDA program could be adjusted in case of policy slippages and a slowing pace 
of reforms, particularly through the sizing and timing of the DPOs in close consultation with the 
Common Approach to Budget Support (CABS). Support for proposed sectoral SWAps is also 
contingent on reaching agreement on strategies with DPs and the government. 

Portfolio Issues 

106. The Malawi portfolio has reached record commitment values. The World Bank portfolio 
in Malawi currently contains 13 investment projects with about US$970 million already committed 
and US$651 million in undisbursed balances. By the end of FY13 the Bank will have a relatively 
young portfolio, comprised of 10 active projects (see Table 3 for the portfolio trend). Previous 
portfolio performance has been relatively strong in Malawi. There have been no problem projects for 
the past three years, notwithstanding the difficult economic and political environment. Except in 
FY12 disbursements have been above those for the Africa Region. The first few months of FY13 
suggest a return to disbursement levels of above 20 percent. Performance of the portfolio has 
improved since the last major CPPR in 2010, with 6 of the 13 projects rated as Satisfactory in terms 
of Development Objectives (DOs) and Implementation Progress (IP), and only 3 projects with both 
DOs and IPs rated just Moderately Satisfactory. The other four projects have either the DO or the IP 
rated Satisfactory and the other Moderately Satisfactory.  

107. Most of the outcomes of this CAS will be achieved by continuing the current portfolio. 
The number of active projects is expected to remain constant at 10 from January 2013 on (see table 
3). Three projects are closing this year and no new one will be added. The envisaged additional 
financing for FSTAP will not affect the number of projects in the portfolio. In FY13 new entrants are 
expected to match the number of exits.

108. The WBG supports the harmonization agenda with, for example, the use of national 
procurement procedures for over 60 percent of procurement for IDA projects (subject to 
exceptions related to fraud and corruption clauses) and also supports the mainstreaming of project 
management units (PMUs) in government structures (e.g., ASWAp, ESWAp, mining, energy and 
Shire River Basin Management Projects being implemented without PIUs). Between 2010 and May 
2012, Bank and IFC-supported projects in Malawi ran into problems related to cost overruns, poor 
contract administration, procurement delays, lack of readiness for implementation, fuel and foreign 
exchange shortages, and funding delays for local project components. The WBG will address these 
issues during the new CAS by moving toward more programmatic operations (which worked well 
during the last CAS); using country systems where capacity exists or can be strengthened; 
simplifying project design; using additional financing mechanisms to reduce transaction costs and 
preparation time; improving readiness for implementation; ensuring more realistic covenants; helping 
the government to move away from the PIU implementation model, and periodically reviewing the 
portfolio with the government. The WBG now has better access to local technical support with the 
establishment of the WBG/AfDB Joint Infrastructure Unit. The WBG will also consider using 
innovative instruments like the P4R (Program for Results) where appropriate, maybe in higher 
education and perhaps output-based aid (OBA) in areas such as nutrition, water and sanitation 
services, and social protection. 

109. The fiduciary risk of the portfolio as a whole is high due to (a) inadequate accounting 
controls; (b) inadequate audit committees in government ministries and failure to follow up on audit 
issues; and (c) low implementation capacity. The report on the Assessment of Fiduciary Risks in the 
Use of Country PFM system for Investment Projects (2010) concluded that key elements to move 
toward substantial use of the country PFM system for investment lending projects are present but 
need to be refined. This includes integration of WBG-funded investment lending projects into the 
planning and budget processes, appropriation, expenditure control, funds flow, accounting, and 
reporting through the IFMIS and internal and external audit arrangements. The PFEMRP, supported 
through the MDTF, will address some of these deficiencies. The fiduciary framework is adequate for 
using country PFM systems for development policy operations (DPOs). The fiduciary team will be 
cautious in increasing use of country FM systems. The team will analyze the risks and institute 
mitigation measures for each element of the FM systems before using them. The Financial Reporting 
and Oversight Improvement (FROI) Project funded through the PFEMRP MDTF is expected to go 
into operation soon, which should address some of the current concerns in the portfolio. The WBG 
team will also provide support to government financial management staff in projects in the portfolio 
to build their capacity to maintain reliable records and submit properly reconciled reports for 

44 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Malawi Country Assistance Strategy FY13–16 

monitoring and disbursement purposes. On the procurement side, an Institutional Development Fund 
(IDF) is enhancing the skills of staff involved in procurement in Malawi’s ministries, departments, 
and parastatal organizations and the capacity of the Office of the Director of Public Procurement 
(ODPP) and of third party organizations to monitor procurement activities. 

110. The governance mainstreaming approach laid out in Theme 3 of this CAS can only be 
effective if it is given priority across all operations by the full Malawi country team. The WBG 
programs that have emphasized governance in the CAS and the resulting mainstreaming of 
governance throughout operations have found it useful to establish a Governance Advisory 
Committee within the country team. The Malawi team has such a committee, led by the Country 
Manager, as a cornerstone of CAS implementation. The Advisory Committee (i) provides guidance 
on the governance strategy for Malawi; (ii) offers guidance on operational design in terms of 
understanding and addressing governance constraints, such as by incorporating components to 
enhance the transparency of sectoral resource flows and service delivery, and enhance civil society 
participation in and oversight of service provision; (iii) reviews and clears project documents; (iv) 
facilitates efforts to mainstream governance into operations along the above lines; and (v) monitors 
progress on the governance strategy to build transparency, participation, and oversight across the 
portfolio. 

111. The CAS will support an AAA program (ESW, non-lending TA, and IEs) to underpin 
the financing activities, fill in knowledge gaps, update diagnostics, and stimulate innovations 
and pilots drawing on country and global experience. Following the harmonization principles and 
drawing on the lessons of the CAS Completion Report and client consultations, research and analysis 
will be done in close cooperation with country counterparts, development partners, and local 
academics and researchers to reinforce joint ownership and build capacity. The strategic use of trust 
funds will enhance the scope and depth of the analytical and advisory work. An IDF grant is 
supporting the government’s efforts to enhance capacity to mobilize the Malawian diaspora for 
economic development and build remittances. The WBG will also participate in joint evaluations led 
by other DPs, as is the case for the DfID-funded impact evaluation of the FISP. The WBG is part of 
the technical committee in charge of supervising the evaluation that will design and draft a panel 
survey based on the IHS3 to measure the impact of the FISP on household productivity and incomes, 
on maize and labor market changes, on fertilizer and seed markets, and more globally on the general 
economy. The WBG has also been advancing the knowledge-sharing agenda by engaging non-
traditional partners through south-south knowledge and peer-to-peer learning programs; for instance, 
it recently organized a video conference where officials from the Reserve Bank of Malawi financial 
education unit were able to learn from their Brazilian counterparts about Brazil’s successful program 
of financial education in schools.   

112. The CAS objectives and the results will be achieved with a concerted and integrated 
WBG approach. Delivering the bulk of the agenda will require synergistic collaboration and 
coordinated complementary activities of the Bank, IFC, and MIGA (as needed). Close partnership 
between the Bank and IFC will be particularly important to improving the business climate, 
diversifying the economic and export base, enabling PPPs to meet investment gaps and deliver better 
infrastructure services, meeting the financial needs of individuals and enterprises (including Micro, 
45 

 
 
 
 
 
 
Malawi Country Assistance Strategy FY13–16 

Small and Medium Enterprise (MSMEs)), expanding emerging sectors and businesses, and 
maximizing the potential of greater global and regional integration. The IFC’s Global Trade Finance 
Program (GTFP) has been active in Malawi, working to expand available financing with longer 
maturities to reduce the need for collateralized transactions. Its focus has been in the financial, agro-
processing, and telecom sectors.  MIGA also remains open for business in Malawi, across all of its 
Political Risk Insurance product lines, including Transfer Restriction, Expropriation, Breach of 
Contract and War and Civil Disturbance, as well as the Non-Honoring of Sovereign Obligations.  
These product lines can be used alongside other WBG products, for example, IFC loans or PRG 
support, or to directly support government public private partnerships or Independent Power Projects, 
as has been applied elsewhere in the region. MIGA's Small Investment Product (SIP) could also be 
useful for the country, where more streamlined procedures could allow smaller projects to be 
supported. WBI will have a critical role in building capacity, disseminating global best practices, and 
building the knowledge base of counterparts in such areas as budgeting and PFM reforms, public 
investment planning and management, project analysis and implementation, and poverty and sectoral 
assessments and strategy development.   

Box 7:  World Bank / IFC Collaboration 

IDA and IFC have a strong partnership and intend to step up the collaboration in the improved private investment 
environment. IFC is seeking to increase its engagement in Malawi, focusing on investments and advisory activities 
that help diversify the economy; develop the micro, small and medium Enterprise (MSME) sector; and improve 
access to finance. IDA and IFC teams have been exploring joint initiatives and are working closely together in areas 
such as improving the business environment, access to finance for SMEs, agro-processing and commercial 
agriculture, telecoms, PPP support, and facilitation of global trade integration. Some highlights of this collaboration: 

• 

IFC’s Global Trade Finance Program (GTFP) in Malawi seeks to (expand available financing and reduce 
the need for cash collateralized transactions; (b) provide longer maturities than currently available; and (c) 
deliver technical assistance and training to improve operating standards. Its Small and Medium Enterprises 
Enterprise Development Initiative (SME-EDI) worked with the Malawi Export Promotion Council (MEPC) 
on a countrywide sector mapping exercise to identify SME export opportunities, and on production of an 
SME exporter handbook, completed in November 2008.  

• For the Shire Valley Irrigation Project (FY16), in 2011 a joint identification mission from IFC/IDA/AfDB 
drafted with the government a roadmap and identified principles of engagement on this large-scale 
irrigation- based agricultural growth pole project. It encompasses a comprehensive support package 
directed at both the public and the private sector, with specific support for value chain and agribusiness 
development. Preparatory studies are being proposed under the CAS looking specifically at the investment 
climate, regional agribusiness opportunities, linkages of producers to markets, and access to finance; and 
these are pursued in a direct collaboration between IDA/IFC and the AfDB. Also on irrigation service 
provision and the large public and private investments required for infrastructure and O&M, options have 
been explored for PPPs and joint support from IDA, IFC, and also MIGA.  

• Also in agriculture sector in general, as a complement of World Bank support to the ASWAp-supported 
reform agenda, IFC through its Investment Climate (IC) Advisory Services may provide technical 
assistance to improve the functioning of markets serving agribusiness, including addressing legal barriers to 
competition in and expansion of commercial agriculture all along the value chain: input markets, systems 
for contract farming and aggregation, management of storage and logistics, cross-border trade, and taxation 
issues.  

46 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Malawi Country Assistance Strategy FY13–16 

• 

In both of these initiatives, IFC’s experience in investment promotion and facilitation could help attract 
reputable investors. This could be done with support for the technology, quality standards, and market 
access necessary to make the sector more competitive and build the capacity of smallholders to handle out-
grower schemes. 

113. Trust funds (TF) are an integral part of the Malawi portfolio and contribute to 
achievement of CAS goals. The current strategy of closely linking TFs with planned financial 
support will continue, with a program designed to address analytical gaps and provide TA essential 
to achievement of the CAS outcomes. TFs have also been effectively used to help Malawi pilot 
initiatives and respond to changing country conditions (as in disaster risk reduction and 
management). A concrete example of the positive impact of trust-funded activities was when TA 
under the Financial Sector Reform and Strengthening Initiative (FIRST) was used to draft a Financial 
Sector Development Strategy for Malawi, which then led to a financial sector technical assistance 
operation that is helping implement the strategy. Management of TFs will be mainstreamed within 
the WBG’s CAS implementation strategy in areas such as procurement, financial management; and 
M&E within an integrated portfolio monitoring and reporting system, which will ensure continuous, 
follow up of activities. (See Annex 9 for a summary of current TFs.) 

114. There are 30 DPs active in Malawi in a variety of sectors (see Annex 5). Actual official 
development assistance (ODA) disbursements to Malawi between 2007/08 to 2009/10 amounted to 
US$2.14 billion. In FY2009/10- 2010/2011, of the 30 DPs, the six largest as a percentage of ODA 
were United States (US$206 million), the EU (US$ 154 million), the World Bank (US$139 million), 
the United Kingdom - Department for International Development (DfID) (US$$108 million), 
Norway (US$ 57 million), and the AfDB (US$ 36 million). The top five DPs contributed 70 percent 
of Malawi ODA. The largest multilateral agency was the EU and the largest bilateral donor the 
United States. The WBG, in close partnership with the government and other DPs, is committed to 
the Paris Declaration for Aid Effectiveness and the Accra Agenda for Action. The MGDS framework 
provides the basis for alignment of donor support to ensure greater ownership, emphasis on results, a 
sharp poverty focus, harmonization, and mutual accountability. The WBG is moving toward more 
programmatic lending arrangements with other DPs and already participates in one pooled funding 
arrangement (the HIV and AIDS Pool) and is building similar arrangements in education, water, and 
agriculture. Sector wide approaches (SWAp) and SWAp-like arrangements are pursued in nutrition 
and education through co-financing arrangements such as MDTFs. An MDTF has already been 
established for PFM reforms.  The WBG plans to continue to provide and implement the DPOs 
within the framework of the CABS, a group of DPs that have a common approach to provision of 
budgetary support to the government. The Joint Framework signed in 2005 between the government 
and the CABS DPs (EU, DfID, Norway, SIDA) sets forth agreed terms and procedures for budget 
support and serves as a coordinating framework for consultation, joint reviews of performance, and 
reporting. All CABS members have bilateral agreements with the government that guide their 
individual financial decisions. Revision of the Joint Framework, initiated in 2010, is continuing. 

115. The government has created sector working groups to coordinate and manage sector 
activities and also a high-level forum for policy discussions. Within the harmonization framework, 
47 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Malawi Country Assistance Strategy FY13–16 

the WBG will lead the sector working groups on Economic Governance, Management, Energy, and 
Private Sector Development. It will play a co-lead role in partnership with others in agriculture and in 
the sustainable development of irrigation and water resources. The Joint Infrastructure Unit will 
facilitate collaboration with the government and other DPs in the Water and Transport working 
groups and coordination of project preparation and implementation. Joint programs should decrease 
transaction costs for all parties. The WBG is also contributing to a continuing effort to agree on joint 
donor conclusions on development issues (Joint Country Analysis), spear-headed by the EU and 
UNDP, which is expected to form a key input for the planned December 2012 planned high-level 
meeting.  

116. Effective collaboration with nontraditional partners in Malawi is still a work in 
progress and during the first half of this CAS, efforts will be made to learn from the WBG-
wide experience in this area. Nevertheless, collaborative efforts between traditional and 
nontraditional partners will be central to helping government deliver on its economic growth targets. 
Currently coordination is within the context of the Heads of Mission dialogue platform, which is 
open to both traditional and nontraditional partners. Although the share of nontraditional support in 
total foreign support remains small, in recent years the presence in Malawi of nontraditional partners 
(dominated by China and India) has been growing. Nontraditional partners are largely concentrated 
in project financing, though PPPs and otherwise, and facilitating private investments on a 
concessional basis as part of south-south cooperation. Over the past few years China’s support to the 
Malawi government has included infrastructure investments (international conference facility, 
National Parliament Building, Sciences and Technology University, Karonga-Chitipa Road, 
expansion of Kapichira II and more recently launched the building of a national stadium now 
underway). India has extended two lines of credit worth US$ 80 million for investments in 
agriculture.  

117. The gender focus of the WBG’s program is addressed explicitly in the CAS. In the CAS 
the WBG has prioritized interventions that support (i) more equal enrollment and retention of boys 
and girls in school: the CAS will support retention of girls in schools through conditional cash 
transfers and school bursaries, and by improving education quality through providing clean and safe 
sanitation for children attending school in specified project areas (e.g., the Project to Improve 
Education Quality in Malawi, FY10); the Second National Water Development Project (FY07)); (ii) 
more equal access to financial markets and land: project interventions will increase the number of 
women with access to land and financial services by helping the government to increase access to 
stronger financial markets and promote equity in land acquisition (e.g., Financial Sector Project; 
Community Based Rural Land Development Project); and (iii) more income opportunities for rural 
women: the CAS will support targets for raising agricultural productivity and improving the 
livelihoods of poor and vulnerable rural households, including women, for example, by improving 
access to agricultural inputs (e.g., seeds and fertilizers) and to income-generating activities (e.g., 
Irrigation, Rural Livelihoods and Agriculture Project; Third Social Action Fund; Shire Valley 
Irrigation Project). The aim is to raise two of the indicators for mainstreaming gender in the country 
portfolio. (See Annex 6, which has a separate monitoring framework for this gender mainstreaming 
target).  Moreover, this gender focus in operations is underpinned by a strong analytical work 
program. 

48 

 
 
 
 
 
Malawi Country Assistance Strategy FY13–16 

118. 
In addition to mainstreaming impact evaluations, the program will be monitored and 
outcomes evaluated regularly. A CAS Progress Report to be prepared for Board presentation in 
2014 will reflect candid assessments of progress and address any major deviations or emerging 
priorities. Annual Results Days will bring together the country team to take stock of progress and 
discuss needed adjustments, corrections, and updates; the results framework will be used as a live 
monitoring tool. The WBG will continue to have annual programming discussions with the Ministry 
of Finance and Planning to review the CAS program.  

IV. MANAGING RISKS  

119. There are considerable risks to successful attainment of the results targeted in the 
proposed CAS program. These stem from the political environment for sustained commitment to 
the reform agenda, external and internal macroeconomic risks, weather-related shocks, risks from the 
lack of diversity of the economy, and risks arising from inadequate public sector management 
capacity and fiduciary and governance issues. 

120. Political risks could affect macroeconomic stabilization. The current government has 
embarked on bold reforms to restore macroeconomic stability and is committed to prudent 
macroeconomic policies. However, risks might arise from tensions between political pressures to expand 
government programs and the need for a prudent fiscal stance in order to keep inflation pressures at bay 
and keep debt sustainable. The reform agenda may also be affected by the elections planned for 2014. 
While there is likely to be continued political commitment to poverty reduction and implementation 
of the MGDS II, in the past commitment to a credible macro stabilization program has wavered. 
Some of the risks are mitigated by the deliberate government efforts to build broad public support for 
policy reforms. In addition, the government’s efforts to enhance social inclusion through education, 
health, and expanded social protection programs, supported by the Bank’s Rapid Response Program, are 
expected to help offset potential social tension. 

121. Shortfalls in donor support could undermine economic growth and the external balance. 
A widening external financing gap could force the authorities to borrow domestically; given minimal 
official reserves and significant import needs, that would put pressure on a difficult fiscal adjustment 
process, undermine fiscal sustainability, and jeopardize necessary social and capital expenditures. These 
risks are mitigated by the forceful actions the administration has already undertaken to repair relations 
with DPs and its intentions to address governance and human rights concerns; its commitments to the 
fiscal adjustment program and a flexible exchange rate policy, which anchor for external and debt 
sustainability; and predictable and timely budget support backed by analytical support and policy 
dialogue through the next DPO series. 

122. 
Social tensions could mount, which would cause fiscal pressures. The consequences of 
previous economic policies and recent adjustments in the economy could further push up consumer prices 
and erode consumer purchasing power, which could stimulate wage demands in both the private and the 
public sector and increase social tensions. Already there have been many labor disputes and some strikes 
that affected service delivery and raised political concerns about the viability of the reform effort. These 
49 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Malawi Country Assistance Strategy FY13–16 

tensions could be exacerbated if international increases in fuel prices result in second-round effects on the 
prices of other products and further increase the costs of production, which would again raise prices. 
Domestic tensions could affect investor and consumer confidence, which would deter private investment, 
and could also increase fiscal pressures on government financing. There are provisions in the fiscal 
framework as agreed with the IMF to deal with some of the demands, but it will be necessary for the 
government to engage all stakeholders to rally support for reforms, understand the consequences, and 
manage expectations. To mitigate this risk, the government will also need to make a deliberate and 
comprehensive effort to clearly communicate the reform program, its impact, and the role of various 
stakeholders, including citizens.  

123. Malawi is still vulnerable to internal and external trade shocks. The lack of agricultural 
diversification and arbitrary government interventions in agricultural markets, as well as weather- 
related events (droughts, and also floods, are frequent), expose the economy to such shocks. Last 
year, burley tobacco, the country’s main export crop, demonstrated disappointing performance, and 
the sector is now threatened by enforcement of agreed components of the Framework Convention on 
Tobacco, which would restrict, and possibly ban, the use of flavorants. Alternative livelihoods and 
sources of export revenues are being explored, but effective diversification programs require a 
supportive macro-environment and investment climate. It will also take time to establish effective 
market conditions for alternative crops to take the place of tobacco. Non-agricultural diversification, 
for instance mining, requires significant investments, which in turn will require government to 
improve the business climate for private energy investors. The WBG, together with other DPs, will 
continue to work closely with government counterparts to deal with the many structural barriers in 
this transition process.  

124. Climate variability and natural disasters continue to put strains on Malawi’s economy. 
WBG assessments found that droughts and dry spells cause average annual losses of about 1 percent 
of GDP and floods losses of about 0.7 percent. Given the country’s vulnerability to natural disasters, 
coupled with their potentially significant impact on the economy, which could be exacerbated by 
effects of climate change, the WBG is already scaling up support for climate and disaster risk 
management and mainstreaming mitigation and adaptation within the portfolio. DPs are also 
supporting adoption of a comprehensive risk mitigation and contingency plan for reducing Malawi’s 
vulnerability to natural disasters. 

125. Concerns about poor public sector management and governance persist. Implementation 
of the CAS program and achievement of results could be undermined by inadequate public sector 
management capacity and arrangements. Furthermore, highly centralized decision making and 
centralization of powers affect decisions related to projects. Firming up the evidence base for 
decision-making and collaboration on strategic decision-making through enhanced support for public 
sector reform could mitigate this risk. Feeble public fiduciary management due to lack of capacity to 
implement, account for, and report on expenditures at all levels, as well as limited capacity to 
manage procurement, raise concerns about the governance aspects of projects. Recognizing these 
weaknesses, the government has pronounced a “national austerity drive” to address some of them. 
Several interventions, such as the Public Finance and Economic Management MDTF, are expected to 
help address capacity challenges. The first project of the PFM RP is focusing on the government 
50 

 
 
 
 
 
 
Malawi Country Assistance Strategy FY13–16 

accounting system (IFMIS), internal audits, and external audits. The intent is to improve the 
timeliness and reliability of financial information; the control environment, by building up the 
internal audit function to ensure enforcement of policies and procedures and prompt follow-up of 
audit recommendations; and the external audit function to improve the range (through, e.g., forensic 
and value-for-money audits) and quality of audits. This should partially mitigate the public fiduciary 
management problem. Enhanced transparency of resource flows and service delivery, including 
efforts to improve data quality and availability for results monitoring, coupled with enhanced civil 
society participation and oversight, is also expected to help mitigate these risks. Extra vigilance in the 
oversight of project funding allocations will be required.

I. INTRODUCTION 

1. 
The Malawi Country Assistance Strategy Completion Report (CASCR) assesses the 
effectiveness of the Bank’s assistance program to Malawi for the period FY07-FY12. The CAS 
was originally planned for FY07-10, but was extended due to delays in implementation of the 
program caused by political economy problems and to allow full alignment of the new CAS with 
the second Malawi Growth and Development Strategy (MGDS II). The conclusions of this report 
will inform the new CAS to be delivered in FY13. This report benefited from (i) a review of the 
link between the strategic objectives of the 2007-2012 CAS and government goals as formulated 
in the Malawi Growth and Development Strategy 2006/7-2010/11; (ii) a review of portfolio 
performance and selected Bank documents and assessments carried out to date; (iii) a review of 
the Bank’s Quality Assurance Group’s (QAG) reports on several projects in the portfolio; (iv) 
updated outcome tables and inputs from the Country Team members; and (v) an assessment of 
the extent to which the Bank was successful in meeting CAS objectives.  

2. 
The CASCR rates program implementation as moderately unsatisfactory due to limited 
improvement in the business environment, especially the energy outcomes, failure to embark on 
agriculture commercialization, and the deteriorating political economy and poor macroeconomic 
management that affected project implementation, especially the last 18 months of CAS 
implementation. It rates Bank performance as moderately satisfactory; the program demonstrated 
uneven success in contributing to the achievement of all CAS outcomes.  However, there is a 
broadly sound program of ongoing activities in place for the next strategy period.  Positive 
aspects of Bank performance included a results-based and client-responsive CAS design, 
proactiveness in dealing with implementation issues, and successfully replacing budget support 
by investment lending at times of inappropriate macro-policies.  The Bank’s program remained 
responsive to the country’s changing environment and demands during the CAS period. 

II. MALAWI’S LONGER-TERM STRATEGIC GOALS 

3. 
The MGDS sets out the Government’s economic growth and development priorities for 
five years (2006/07 – 2010/11), in line with the longer term Vision 2020 and the Millennium 
Development Goals. The MGDS built on the country’s Poverty Reduction Strategy (2002) and 
Economic Growth Strategy (2003) and integrated several new sector strategies, policies, and 
emerging issues, such as land reform and public-private partnerships.  

4. 
The July 2010 MGDS review commissioned by the Malawi Government and financed by 
UNDP indicated that the MGDS has generally been an effective instrument for achieving the 
country’s development goals. Through this strategy some challenges, such as food insecurity and 

65 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Malawi Country Assistance Strategy FY13–16 
dwindling of income, have been reversed, resulting in positive economic growth. However, 
performance in areas such as poverty reduction, elimination of extreme hunger, gender parity, 
universal access to primary education, maternal health, and employment generation is still 
disappointing. There are also structural challenges, such as weak harmonization between overall 
strategies and implementation of specific policies at the ministerial level, and weak monitoring 
and evaluation systems.  

5. 
In 2007, an IMF/World Bank Joint Staff Advisory Note (JSAN) concluded that the 
MGDS provided a comprehensive framework for growth and poverty reduction in Malawi, but 
also pointed out that the results framework was weak. Staff noted that the emphasis on growth 
and government ownership were key strengths of the strategy, while the results framework was 
not underpinned by a comprehensive list of indicators that allowed for effective monitoring and 
evaluation. The role of social protection and expenditures protection in supporting growth was 
also underplayed.  

6. 
The JSAN recommended additional analytical work that was necessary to achieve MGDS 
objectives. These included growth diagnostics; analytical work to improve the quality of the 
governance environment (efficiency, accountability, and transparency in the use of public 
resources); diagnostic work to better understand the underlying constraints to evidence-based 
policy making in Malawi; more detailed analytical work on barriers and facilitators to infant and 
child feeding as a main contributor to malnutrition; institutional audit to inform efforts to build a 
stronger disaster management system; and efforts to further scale up weather insurance policies. 

III. CAS OBJECTIVES AND OUTCOMES 

7. 
The 2007 CAS identified three key challenges to achievement of the Government’s 
development goals: 

• Pervasive risks at the national and household level resulting primarily from food 
insecurity caused by weather-related shocks to agricultural production and poorly 
functioning agricultural markets, macroeconomic instability, and illness or death, 
especially from HIV/AIDS. 

• Constraints in private sector development because of macroeconomic instability, 
deficient infrastructure, especially limited and unreliable electricity supply, a shortage of 
skilled personnel, expensive and restricted access to credit, and the negative impact of 
crime and corruption.  

• Weak institutional capacity: Malawi faces severe human resource constraints in key 
sectors, including health and education, partly due to the inability of the education 
system to produce sufficient graduates, exacerbated by the impact of the HIV/AIDS.  

8. 
Responding to the key development challenges identified by the World Bank, the 2007 
CAS set four pillars with outcomes directly linked to the MGDS goals. The milestones for 
monitoring progress were centered on key issues that the Bank program sought to address 
through expected CAS outcomes (see Figure 1).  

66 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Malawi Country Assistance Strategy FY13–16 
9. 
The CAS was also aligned with the Bank’s African Region strategic priorities. The focus 
of the CAS on growth, enhanced social protection, and improved governance reflected the four 
pillars of the Africa Action Plan (AAP, adopted in September 26, 2005): accelerating shared 
growth; building capable states; strengthening outcome-based national strategies and the Bank’s 
focus on results; and strengthening the global development partnership for Africa.  

10. 
Implementation of the CAS and progress of reforms were strongly influenced by 
political, social, and economic developments 
in Malawi during 
the period. Program 
implementation gave more preference to economic growth than has been the case in the past, in 
line with Malawi’s substantial progress in pursuing sustainable fiscal policies and maintaining 
macroeconomic stability for a number of years. The country’s macroeconomic performance was 
affected by various shocks and the level of fiscal discipline, which tended to oscillate between 
periods of strong (2006–2008 and 2010) and weak policy implementation (2011/12). The year 
2006 marked a return to macroeconomic stability and fiscal prudence with 7.7 percent growth in 
real GDP after an era of weak macroeconomic performance and lackluster economic growth, 
averaging 2 percent.

IV. RESULTS ASSESSMENT 

Program Performance Rating 

The CAS Completion report rates the achievement of results foreseen in the CAS as moderately 
unsatisfactory because it did not make acceptable progress toward several of its major expected 
outcomes. The program was delivered as planned with minor modifications to scheduling but 
within an expanded implementation period and more resources as compared to the plan. The 
most important shortcoming was the failure to address issues in the energy sector which is today 
still a major constraint to investment. The Bank contributed to the development of SWAps in the 
education and agriculture sectors as a means of addressing Government capacity constraints and 
pooled funds with other development partners to address the issues of vulnerability as a result of 
HIV infections and food insecurity. DPLs were provided in the context of the Common 
Approach to Budget support and were linked to the investment lending, in turn preceded in most 
cases 
by 
AAAs. 
Some 
of 
the 
notable 
results 
achieved 
are                                                                                         
(a) harmonization of agriculture and education sector investments and a close alignment of 
support toward Government sector programs; (b) setting the analytical basis for Government to 
make informed evidence-based policy decisions in order to focus on priorities that can enhance 
the impact on growth and poverty reduction; (c) support Government to implement innovative 
agricultural risk management models on macro- and micro-weather insurance schemes; The 
implementing environment characterized by a challenging policy environment and a fragile 
economy contributed to underperformance. Areas of concern included these areas: limited 
improvement of the business environment aggravated by the static energy agenda; delayed 
implementation of reforms; and the deteriorating political economy.  

11. 
The political stalemate between the former president and the opposition hampered the 
Government’s ability to legislate. This affected progress of implementation of agreed reforms, 
including meeting several covenants, 19 and ratification of a number of IDA credits. In 2008 and 
2009 the policy-making environment remained constrained, compounded by the 2008/09 global 
food and fertilizer price shocks and significant fiscal loosening that preceded the 2009 elections. 
Consequently, although the 2007 CAS had planned to deliver three projects (HIV/AIDS, Energy, 
and PRSG2) valued at $90 million in FY09, only one, the PRSG2, was delivered, with a limited 
reform agenda and a correspondingly lower amount of budget support. IDA was able to deliver a 
Regional Communication Infrastructure Project that was not originally planned. Some IDA-
Board approved projects were not ratified for a long period (including the Mozambique-Malawi 
Interconnector and the Agriculture Development Support Project). Hence the Bank adopted a 
roll-back strategy in 2009, which meant reduced lending and increased AAA.  

12. 
President Mutharika was re-elected in May 2009 and his Democratic Progressive Party 
(DPP) won an absolute majority in Parliament. This allowed for a smoother budget session than 
in the previous years. Ratification of Bank credits, including ADP-SP and the additional 
financing for the Multi HIV/AIDS project, was quicker. New operations, such as the PRSG III 
and the Improving the Quality of Education Project, were rapidly processed. Additional 
financing for MASAF III and IRLAD and new operations in the mining, environment, and 
financial sectors were also approved. While the Regional interconnector project was cancelled

Malawi Country Assistance Strategy FY13–16 
for lack of political support in Malawi, the energy dialogue picked up again, resulting in 
preparation of a new energy investment project. Other investments in water, nutrition, 
agriculture, and environment were approved in FY 11 and FY12. Because all of these activities 
were still part of the original CAS program, the CAS implementation period was extended by 
another year. This also allowed time to fully align the new CAS (FY13-16) with the 
Government’s process to review the MGDS I and prepare for MGDS II, which was adopted in 
May 2012. 

13. 
However, pressures were growing, political as well as economic. Malawi went into a 
negative cycle of lost confidence, investment, and support. The inappropriate policy response to 
shocks, including the terms of trade shock in early 2011, resulted in an off-track IMF Extended 
Credit Facility. As a result, budget support from the Bank and other donors in the Common 
Approach to Budget Support (CABS) came to a halt. In addition, the $350 million Millennium 
Challenge Compact and budget support from CABS development partners were also suspended. 
This resulted in foreign exchange and fuel shortages that slowed down the implementation of 
many projects, especially in the infrastructure area. All these impacted the entire program, and at 
least a year of implementation was lost.  

14. 
In April 2012 Mrs. Banda ascended to the presidency following the death of President 
Mutharika. This opened a new window of opportunity; many pending important governance and 
economic reforms were implemented within a short period, necessitating the preparation of a 
Rapid Response program. An IMF-endorsed ECF program has been in place since July 2012. All 
donors are back at the table. As there are still some concerns about effective parliamentary 
oversight, civil society and faith-based organizations continue their watchdog and alternative 
voice role. 

V. 
CAS IMPLEMENTATION PRIORITIES, ACHIEVEMENTS AND CHALLENGES AT 
THE END OF THE CAS PERIOD 

Pillar 1: Agricultural productivity and integration into agro-processing 

15. 
The priority was to increase productivity and food security. Irrigation and market 
incentives were expected to contribute to increased yields, specifically for smallholder farmers 
supported by the Bank program. Through three projects—the Community Based Lands 
Development Project (CBRLD); the Irrigation, Rural Livelihoods and Agricultural Development 
Program (IRLADP); and the Agricultural Development Program-Support Project (ADP-SP that 
later was folded into Agriculture SWAP)—the following had been achieved by June 2012: 

• 

Increased productivity by targeted farmers for rain-fed maize from less than 1.0 t/ha to 1.9 
t/ha on average at the national level. Under irrigation, national statistics indicate that 
average maize and rice yield have increased to over 2.8 t/ha (from 1.6) and 1.5 t/ha (from 
1.0) respectively by 2012.  
• More than 3,400 hectares of irrigated land have been developed or rehabilitated, benefitting 
over 20,000 households. 
• 15,142 land-poor rural households voluntarily relocated from densely populated districts to 
other districts with available arable land where they have realized improved food 
production and incomes. These beneficiaries now cultivate about 2 ha from an original land 
holding size of less than 0.5 ha.  

69 

 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
Malawi Country Assistance Strategy FY13–16 
• More than 340,000 farming households are benefitting from on-farm trials and 
demonstrations of improved seed, crop nutrient management, sustainable land and water 
management techniques, and post-harvest technologies.  

16. 
However, much remains to be done to put agriculture in Malawi on a more diversified 
and commercial-oriented footing. The Bank is still in the initial stages of work with the Ministry 
of Agriculture and Food Security to develop a project to promote agricultural diversification and 
more commercialized farming practices. The ASWAp-SP, has received additional financing for 
construction of rural roads and to start initial investments on diversification (focusing on 
legumes production). IRLADP has been extended and received additional finances of $52.7 
million to scale up its support to small-scale irrigation schemes and implementation of inputs for 
asset activities as a social safety net program to cushion the impact of the economic reforms in 
rural areas. The Community Lands project closed in September 2012 and received a positive 
evaluation from the IEG assessment 
.  
Pillar 2: Improved business environment 

17. 
The program expected to achieve improvements in the efficiency and reliability of 
electricity supply and in “Doing Business” indicators for increased trade across borders and 
reductions in the costs to start a business. The major achievements were: 

• The establishment of a Commercial Court in 2007 significantly reduced the number of 
days spent in settlement of commercial disputes from an average of 290 days in 2008 to 
96 days in 2010. 

• 

Improvement of sector management and governance due to the establishment of the 
Malawi Energy Regulatory Authority (MERA) in 2008 and an increase in tariff levels by 
an average of 56 percent, which will strengthen the financial position of ESCOM. 

• The Bank and European Commission have supported the preparation of a multimodal 
transport study and the Government is preparing a Transport Sector Investment Program. 
The condition of the road network has improved significantly, and the outlook for 
financing maintenance through road user charges is encouraging. 

18. 
However, no progress was made in improving the quality of electricity supply. The 
quality of electricity remains the most serious constraint for businesses, as evidenced by load-
shedding, currently estimated to frequently exceed 30 mw, or 10 percent of peak demand. The 
cancelled Mozambique-Malawi Interconnector Project to connect Malawi to the Southern 
African Power Pool would have provided an alternative source of power pending development of 
Malawi’s domestic power resources. A new Energy Sector Project was approved in FY11 and is 
investing in rehabilitation and expansion of the current distribution and transmission system, as 
well as in future generation and demand-side measures. The MCC Compact was delayed in 
preparation, signed in 2011, but subsequently put on hold due to governance challenges until 
June 2012. This US$350 million program, which complements the scope of the Bank-financed 
energy project, is now beginning its implementation.  

70 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Malawi Country Assistance Strategy FY13–16 
Pillar 3: HIV/AIDS and nutrition 

19. 
Behavior changes were expected in order to contribute to a slowing HIV infection rate 
and an increased number of people on Anti-Retroviral (ARV) treatment. Government was 
expected to develop a coherent program on improving the nutritional status of children of less 
than 2 years of age. The following was achieved: 

• 

Increased number of people living with HIV/AIDS on antiretroviral therapy (ART), from 
around 57,000 in 2006 to over 198,800 in 2010, exceeding the target of 165,000 set for 
2009. Similarly, the number of HIV testing and counseling sites increased from 14 in 
2001 to the 410.  
• The HIV/AIDS infection rate decreased from 14 percent to 10.6 percent in 2012. This has 
contributed to the improvement in life expectancy from 30 in 2005 to 52 in 2012. 

20. 
Although a nationwide awareness and information campaign was undertaken to promote 
good feeding practices for under-5 and school-age children, Malawi still lacks a coherent 
nutrition program. A multi-partner study examining determinants of infant and child feeding 
practices was completed and provided the basis for a nutrition program. Study results have been 
widely disseminated and the Bank in collaboration with other partners prepared the Nutrition, 
HIV and AIDS project, which was approved in FY 12. 

Pillar 4: Sustain improvements in fiscal discipline 

21. Malawi was expected to achieve improvements in expenditure management as measured 
by the public financial management (PEFA) indicators. Below are some major achievements 
(details may be found in Attachment 2 of this report : 

• Comprehensiveness and transparency of the budget: Government progressed in improving 
the linkage between the MGDS and the budget. Since 2008/09, Government introduced an 
output-based budget framework where ministries, departments and agencies (MDAs) are 
now required to make their budgets according to MGDS priorities. Furthermore, the 
presentation and structure of the budget, together with the associated chart of accounts, 
have been improved to become compliant with international fiscal reporting standards 
(Government Financial Statistics (GFS) 2001), both for economic and program 
classifications. A module dealing with integrating the budget into the overall General 
Ledger in IFMIS has been introduced. MTEF was reinvigorated in 2011/12 and the budget 
process now focuses more on outputs and achievements. 

• External audit and scrutiny: Progress has been made in improving the timeliness and 
coverage of audits. Government has since cleared the backlog of audits. While the audit of 
the 2009/10 financial statement was submitted within six months of the end of the fiscal 
year, the audit for the 2010/11 was submitted to Parliament with some delays. 

• The key challenge in audit and external scrutiny is to make timely follow-ups of the audit 
issues raised by the Public Accounts Committee of Parliament. Government is expected to 
report on this in a Treasury Minute issued by the Ministry of Finance. There is still a 
backlog of these Treasury Minutes. In addition, beyond linking the budget to the MGDS, 
there is need to further strengthen institutional arrangements for budget implementation. 

71 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Malawi Country Assistance Strategy FY13–16 
For example, currently no budget planning margins are being provided within the MTEF 
ceilings to cater for additional expenditure requirements arising from new policy or 
programs.  

V. BANK PERFORMANCE 

Bank Performance Rating  

The Completion Report rates Bank performance as moderately satisfactory, because the 
implementation of the program demonstrated uneven success in contributing to the achievement 
of CAS outcomes. However, there is a broadly sound program of ongoing activities in place for 
the next strategy period. Positive aspects of bank performance included: (a) program design that 
was selective, result focused, and responsive to Government requests and priorities, which 
enhanced Government ownership; (b) proactive and timely streamlining of the portfolio through 
the cancellation, closure, and restructuring of operations to ensure effective implementation, 
including in some cases provision of additional financing for cost overruns and scaling–up of 
successful interventions; (c) leveraging the Bank’s knowledge-generation capacity and 
convening power to lead the delivery of lending and key knowledge products to help achieve the 
objectives of both the CAS and the Malawi Growth and Development Strategy; (d) flexibility 
and proactiveness that led to the adoption of a roll-back strategy that suited the implementation 
environment in 2009; (e) successful steering Bank support from budget support to investment 
support at times when macro-policies made budget support rather impossible; and (f) widening 
and harnessing stakeholder participation, especially the private sector, CSOs, and media, which 
improved the Bank’s image as per the 2010 client survey. However, the policy dialogue proved 
difficult beyond the technical level and delayed the ratification of some of the policies.  

A. Quality of Products and Services 

22. 
During the CAS period, the WBG’s program was selective based on government requests 
and priorities. The program also targeted more realistic results in line with the key 
recommendations of 2006 IEG CAE. The program limited the Bank’s engagement in sectors in 
which other development partners are adequately positioned to take the lead, for instance, the 
health sector. The portfolio was streamlined through the cancellation, closure, and restructuring 
of operations to ensure effective implementation. The portfolio was reduced to about 10 projects 
to allow budget space for critical knowledge work.  

23. 
The Bank has been leveraging its capacity in knowledge-generation and convening power 
to support interventions by other partners. Factors that determined entry into new areas of 
engagement or exit from current engagements included: 

• A link to policy reform. Particular importance was given to ensuring a strong link to 
policies supporting the establishment of an enabling environment for private sector 
development, agriculture production, and marketing. 

• Explicit government ownership. The Bank engaged only in areas where there was 
explicit request and concrete upfront signals and an agreement with the Government. 

72 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Malawi Country Assistance Strategy FY13–16 
• WBG’s comparative advantage. The Bank provided support only when it had a particular 
comparative advantage in technical skills, resources, convening power, or ability to 
mobilize international expertise. 

Lending 

24. 
Volume, lending instruments, and scenarios: As of June 30, 2012, the Bank portfolio in 
Malawi had 12 investment projects valued at US$861.1 million and two GEF-financed projects 
and was managing two catalytic fund projects in the water and education sectors. Of this amount, 
71 percent were credits and the rest grants. This support was distributed as follows: 30 percent 
for human development; 37 percent for infrastructure development; 15 percent for agriculture, 
rural development and natural resources; 15 percent for environment, and 3 percent for private 
sector development. The Bank portfolio has two regional projects, in telecommunications and 
trade insurance. Since 1966, the WBG has committed about US$2.6 billion to Malawi supporting 
over 120 operations.  

25. 
CAS plans and actual deliveries: The CAS FY07-FY10 planned to deliver $340 million, 
projected at $80 million a year for the first two years and $90 million for the last two years. 
During this CAS FY07-FY12, IDA has committed about $890.0 million. The increased budget is 
a result of successful replenishment of IDA 15, availability of crisis response window funds, and 
extension of the implementation period by two years. Three of the planned four PRSCs were 
delivered. Four additional financing operations were prepared, in the HIV/AIDS, agriculture, 
water, and Social protection sectors. PRSCs were used to implement critical policy and 
institutional reforms aimed at improving agriculture productivity, business the climate, dealing 
with vulnerability to shocks and improving economic governance.

In FY06, 30 percent of the Bank’s Malawi projects were problematic, partly due to 
insufficient capacity and lack of familiarity with Bank procurement procedures. Following the 
Country Portfolio Performance Review in FY06, steps were taken to improve quality at entry 
and portfolio performance, particularly through project-specific seminars to disseminate best 
practices on procurement and financial management. Of the three problem projects, FIMTAP 
was restructured and closed on September 1, 2009. Community Lands improved performance, 
received US$10 million additional financing, and closed on September 30, 2011. ESSUP closed 
successfully in December 2010. BESTAP was restructured in FY09 and was upgraded. Two 
projects were cancelled: the Malaria Booster Program closed due to non-performance and the 
Malawi–Mozambique Interconnector due to a change in priorities of the Malawi Government. 
Two of the four additional financing projects that were processed in the period were needed to 
cover cost-overruns, resulting from price increases, inadequate cost estimation, and delayed 

73 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Malawi Country Assistance Strategy FY13–16 
implementation. The FY10 CPPR indicated that portfolio performance was mixed. The 
Infrastructure Services Project (ISP) was saved from cancellation by a remarkable turnaround 
due to revamped collaboration between the Government and the Bank. Overall, the restructured 
portfolio has improved tremendously in the last years of CAS implementation. At the time of this 
report, there are no problem projects in the portfolio, partly due to Bank decentralization, which 
increased skills availability at country level. Mini/quarterly CPPRs were used to track 
implementation.

The Education Country Status Report (CSR), the Mining Sector Review (MSR), the 
Country Economic Memorandum (CEM), the 2008 Financial Sector Assessment (FSAP), and 
the Malawi Social Protection Stock Take have significantly contributed to the planning and 
policy environment. The CSR brought into focus issues affecting the quality of education in 
Malawi at various levels. The findings fed into the National Education Sector Plan (NESP), 
which has assisted the Government to leverage resources from various donors and the Fast Track 
Initiative (FTI). The MSR in 2009 brought worldwide experience in the management of mining 
transactions and informed the design of the Mining Policy. The MSR provided the analytical 
underpinnings of a new Mining Governance and Growth Support Project. The CEM is a rich 
piece that acknowledges the progress that Malawi has made in improving its macroeconomic 
environment and proposes options on ensuring continued future growth. The 2008 FSAP was 
instrumental in bringing financial sector development into the policy debate in Malawi and its

recommendations have greatly assisted in leading to other AAA, such as the Malawi Financial 
Sector Development Strategy and Finscope Demand and Supply Side Surveys. A Financial 
Sector TA operation has also been developed to implement the recommendations of the FSAP. 
The Social Protection Stock Take informed the design of the social protection policy and has 
helped Malawi move toward development of the Social Support Policy and Program. 

28. 
A few of the planned analytical work and advisory services were merged with other 
AAAs or cancelled or put on hold. The planned AAA on the Weak Evidence Base on High 
Value Crops was delivered as part of the agricultural background analysis which contributed to 
the CEM to avoid duplication and provide a comprehensive picture for understanding the cost 
structure and competitiveness of a number of key agricultural commodities as a basis for 
assessing sources of agricultural growth in Malawi. The Forging Partnership with Agribusiness 
AAA was put on hold because it was meant to be part of diagnostic studies to inform the design 
of the Agriculture Commercialization project, which has been deferred to FY15. In a number of 
cases, the diagnosis and recommendations of the Bank’s work were endorsed by the client, for 
example, the recommendations of the CEM and the Mining Sector Review resulted in 
Government demand for projects in mining, energy, and agriculture.  

B. CAS Implementation 

29. 
CAS implementation monitoring arrangements: Internally, the Malawi CAS was 
launched during a Country Team retreat held in March 2007. The retreat's objective was to 
understand and develop a work plan for CAS implementation, based on the CAS Results Matrix. 
Four CAS pillar teams discussed and presented critical steps necessary for the achievement of 
the objectives. This translated into matrices that were used to track progress on a quarterly basis. 
Specific country team and portfolio review meetings were organized in which CAS progress was 
discussed. In keeping with the spirit of the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness, the 
Government of Malawi initiated annual Joint Programme Reviews (JPRs) with the Department 
for International Development (DFID), European Union (EU), World Bank, German Technical 
Cooperation (GTZ), and Norway. More donors joined later. The process was later converted into 
MGDS annual review and eventually was augmented by regular CPPRs and mini CPPR 
meetings with Government counterparts. 

VI. COUNTRY DIALOGUE AND PARTNERSHIPS 

30. 
The Government has taken significant steps to strengthen donor coordination. Through 
the Department of Debt and Aid in the Ministry of Finance, the Government is now taking a lead 
role in the coordination of donor assistance. Its Development Assistance Strategy was published 
in November 2007 and an Aid Calendar, outlining the expected timeline for disbursement of 
donor funding, is now produced annually. A system of Sector Working Groups is being 
institutionalized. The First High Level Forum meeting between the Government and the 
Development Partners will be held on February 9, 2011. Further, nearly all development 
assistance provided to the public sector is now included in the budget.

Malawi Country Assistance Strategy FY13–16 
VII. CONCLUSIONS AND LESSONS 

31. 
At best program progress toward achieving the goals of FY07 CAS has been mixed. 
Good progress has been made toward two of the four CAS pillars (HIV/AIDS and public 
expenditure management). Mixed progress has been registered toward CAS Pillar 2, with some 
encouraging developments on road infrastructure but little improvement in the investment 
climate and much less in energy. Developments in the agriculture sector have also been mixed 
(CAS Pillar 1). 

32. 
At completion, the objectives of the CAS remained relevant and aligned to the goals of 
the MGDS. The priority areas outlined in the CAS remained the appropriate focus of Bank 
resources and will remain so in the next CAS. A year of implementation was lost due to the then 
prevailing political environment. This necessitated rescheduling of planned projects and 
extension of the CAS implementation period. For example, political and administrative 
constraints resulted in delayed implementation or preparation of certain projects (agriculture and 
energy), and the availability of additional regional financing resulted in the inclusion of projects 
consistent with regional policy (e.g., Regional Communications Infrastructure Project). The 
available CRW funds have been successfully absorbed. 

Experiences and Lessons  

33. 

Some highlights of lessons from the implementation of the FY07-FY12 CAS include: 

• Alignment of the CAS with the MGDS enhanced ownership and commitment, and resulted 
in effective Bank contribution to the country’s development goals. The next CAS should 
likewise be aligned with the government program and it is worthwhile to postpone 
production of the new CAS to allow full alignment with MGDS II. 

• Weak government capacity, especially in areas of financial management, procurement 
and project management as well as monitoring and evaluation, slowed down project 
implementation. The new CAS should help build the capacity of the Government in 
general. In addition, project designs should reflect capacity constraints on the ground. 

• Covenant implementation affected project implementation. The new CAS should find 
alternative ways of supporting key reforms, for example, to link sector policy reform to 
budget support operations or ensure that essential policy reforms are implemented prior 
to proceeding with investment lending. 

• 

Important role for civil society: Civil society, the private sector, and the media are able to 
offer strong contributions and an alternative voice, which is especially important if the 
political arena is dominated by one party. It is therefore recommended that the next CAS 
should scale up the involvement of civil society in Bank-supported projects and the role 
of the Bank in fostering a useful and productive dialogue between the Government and 
civil society. 

76 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Malawi Country Assistance Strategy FY13–16 
• Joint analytical pieces with other development partners help in building consensus, 
expanding ownership, and harmonizing support.  

• Programmatic versus discrete projects: The portfolio is tilting toward programmatic 
approaches to financing, which helps leverage resources from other development partners 
as well as increasing impact on use of (sector) budget funds.  

• There is a need for comprehensive fiduciary support, especially in sector-wide 
operations. Experiences in the Health and HIV pool, as well as from detailed 
procurement reviews, as was done in the fertilizer procurement, indicate that there is still 
significant need for comprehensive fiduciary support in sector-wide operations due to 
weak capacities in the Government. These lessons have already informed arrangements 
for the education pool and the design of the agriculture pool. 

• Projects can influence policy: The implementation of MASAF contributed to a policy 
shift in Government and other stakeholders, for example the use of starter packs to 
conditional cash transfers in addressing food security and vulnerability.

Partially Achieved. Three of the four 
outcomes have been achieved, resulting in 
achieving the goal of food security. In 
target areas under the agricultural projects 
there has been a substantial increase in 
yields due to good rainfall, improved 
irrigation 
service delivery, 
increased 
access to inputs [and] land and adoption of 
new 
farming 
technologies. Under 
IRLADP, maize yields have increased 
from 1.6 ton/ha to 2.8 ton/ha under 
irrigation (75% increase, also partially due 
to increased cropping intensity). Similarly, 
average rice yield in targeted schemes has 
improved from about 1.0 ton/ha to 1.5 
ton/ha (50% increase). The Community 
Based Rural Land Development Project 
(CBRLDP) has enabled 15,142 land-poor 
rural households to voluntarily relocate 
from densely populated districts to other 
districts with arable land where they have 
realized improved food production and 
incomes. 
These 
beneficiaries 
now 
cultivate about 2 ha from an original land 
holding size of less than 0.5 ha. Maize 
productivity in the targeted districts has 
increased from about 500kg/ha to over 
1,500 kg/ha on average, resulting 
in 
increased crop production, food security, 
and income from cash crops. However, the 
commercialization agenda has suffered 
from policy reversals, hence was not fully 
implemented.

Achieved. To date 90,000 ha are under irrigation nationwide, up from 73,480 in 2007. 
These country-wide figures are uncertain and highly fluctuating due to the nature of the 
informal sector. When the CAS was designed the figure of 28,000 ha of formal and semi-
formal irrigation was used as the benchmark, with the drafters being aware of but not 
counting the fluctuating numbers of additional hectares in the informal sector. Against the 
target of 2,500 hectares additional irrigation, irrigated area increased to date by 3438 ha 
with Bank support (37% over target), through rehabilitation of medium-scale schemes 
covering an area of 1,385 ha, and development of small-scale (10-50 ha) and mini-scale 
(<10 ha) schemes covering a total area of 2,053 ha, benefiting over 20,000 farm 
households. At scheme level, the project engaged the services of an NGO to facilitate the 
establishment and training of 40 Water User Associations (of the planned 50). The lower 
number of WUAs is not an underachievement; it is also a result of consolidation of the

Malawi Country Assistance Strategy FY13–16 

fertilizer from 15% to 50% 
in 11 districts by 2009 

fully developed irrigated area managed by water user associations and groups. The task 
will soon be fully achieved since all rehabilitation has been completed. Delayed 
completion of this task was caused by delayed rehabilitation schemes. These WUAs are 
gradually taking over management of the schemes. 

 

Improve market incentives 
for surplus production 
- ADMARC commercial and 
social functions separated by 
the end of 2007  

On-farm trials, demonstrations, and farmer try-outs have been implemented and have so 
far reached more than 300,000 farming households (20 percent of the 1.5 million 
households benefitting from FISP). Research and extension activities cover the following 
areas: improved seed development and use, with 14 varieties tested last year; crop nutrient 
management based on 2,300 research-led trials across the country and 12,000 farmer try-
outs; demonstrations on sustainable land and water management techniques reaching 
more than 30,000 farmers with close to 18,000 ha estimated to be under conservation 
agriculture; and demonstrations of post-harvest technologies with a focus on silos and 
large grain borers bio-control.  

Partially Achieved. The Bank supported restructuring of the state marketing board, 
ADMARC, and implemented a series of risk management initiatives. In line with the 
restructuring program approved by the Cabinet in 2006, ADMARC streamlined its 
activities by closing ancillary departments (clinics, tailoring workshops, etc.) and 
contracting out these services to the private sector. ADMARC has sold its shares in 
various subsidiary companies, closed down the ADMARC Investment Holding Company 
(AIHC), and laid off more than 400 staff. While concrete steps were taken to roll out 
reforms in ADMARC, including the establishment of MAWTCO and the transfer of six 
ADMARC warehouses to MAWTCO, the 2008 global food and fertilizer price crisis 
affected 
the Government’s resolve 
to proceed with 
these 
liberalization plans. 
MAWTCO’s establishment aimed at enhancing private sector participation in maize 
markets. Unfortunately, there have been delays in operationalizing MAWTCO. The 
smaller ADMARC has been mandated to operate as a commercial company. However, the 
Government continues periodically to demand that ADMARC purchase and sell maize at 
mandated prices, purchase cotton at mandated prices, and provide inputs under the Farm 
Input Subsidy Programme. This has resulted at times in a significant contingent liability 
and undermined the idea to run ADMARC as a solely commercial company.  

- 

Increased awareness of 
value of crop diversification 
to reduce income variation 
by 2009  

Achieved. A national export strategy has been prepared and discussed with public and 
private stakeholders. The Ministry of Agriculture is developing action plans to promote 
new crops and to expand the contract farming approach with private investors. The Bank-
funded IRLADP and ASWAp-SP have been promoting production of legumes 
(groundnuts, soya beans, and pigeon peas).  

 Strengthen integration and 
links to input/output markets 
- Travel time reduced by 10% 
between farms within a 
20km radius of the market 
center in areas supported by 
the IIS by 2010 

- 

Private sector leads fertilizer 
procurement and 
distribution, in partnership 
with Government ,by 2009  

Partially Achieved. The CAS indicator on reducing travel time by 10% between farms 
within a 20km radius of the market center in areas supported by the Infrastructure 
Services Project (ISP) was not featured in the ISP results framework; therefore, it has not 
been monitored. Unfortunately the Road Administration does not have any data relating to 
this indicator. However, this indicator was related to feeder road improvements that were 
done rather than surfacing of critical sections of the corridor roads. The Tsangano work 
has not been particularly long-lasting but has significantly contributed to reduced travel 
time. In this regard it could still be possible that travel time has been reduced by 10%, but 
no data are available to demonstrate this.  

The private sector is now contributing to the bulk procurement of the FISP fertilizer 
requirement, with 65% procured by private suppliers in 2011/12 and 80% for this coming 
2012/13 cropping season. However, distribution in rural areas remains fully managed by 
public institutions (ADMARC and SFFRFM). On the seeds side, there is more progress: 
private sector outlets procure and distribute 100% of the seed package under the FISP.

 Establish storage and 
mitigation measures for food 
security risks over time  

- Grain banks and improved 
warehouse receipt system in 
place by 2010 

Partially achieved. Malawi has been taking the lead in Southern Africa in looking for 
ways that market-based tools and risk management strategies can replace traditional, ex 
post reactions to food shortages caused by drought. Three innovative pilot projects to 
improve its risk management related to food crops dealt with weather risk and maize price 
risk: (i) buying insurance against drought, (ii) using SAFEX financial derivatives to 
manage price risks associated with food crisis, and (iii) development of a warehouse 
receipt system. Support for on-going strengthening of the Government’s agricultural risk 
management capabilities is being provided by the Bank under the IDA-financed ASWAp-
SP and the Disaster Risk Management Program, complementing work on building 
community-level resilience. 

The warehouse receipt system is yet to be fully in place because the establishment of the 
Malawi Agricultural Warehousing and Trading Company (MAWTCO) has not been fully 
completed. MAWTCO is expected to lease warehouse space that will be available from 
ADMARC. However, a limited warehousing receipt facility has been established by the 
Agricultural Commodity Exchange (ACE) in collaboration with the Grain Traders and 
Processors Association (GTPA) following the policy discussions that were championed 
by the Bank and other development partners.

Investment climate: 

At least the following two doing 
business indicators should show

• Trading across boarders 
from current 41 to 25 
days (time for export) 
and from 61 to 40 days 
(time for

Partially Achieved. Malawi 
has implemented a number 
of business reforms but at 
relatively slowly, hence its 
ranking on DBI from 110 in 
2007 to 141 in 2011 and 
145 in 2012. There has 
been no progress in trading 
across borders indicators: 
45 days to export and 54 
days to import in 2010.  
This has remained constant 
since. 

The average time necessary 
to start a business has 
increased from 37 days in 
2007 and 2008 to 39 days 
in 2009, 2010, 2011, and 
2012. However, Malawi has 
implemented some other 
DB-related reforms quite 
successfully: (i) registering 
property (reduced from 88 
days in 2007 to 49 days in 
2011 (although this went 
back up 
to 69 days 
in 
2012)); and (ii) enforcing 
contracts (reduced from 337 
days in 2007 to 96 days in 
2012).

 

Improve energy generation 
and transport: 

- Energy generation capacity 
increased 25% by 2011 from 
284 MW in 2006  

- Additional resources to fill 
the financing gap for 
transport identified and 
targeted against priority 
transport objectives by 2008 

- 

 Address policy issues in the 
investment climate 
Policy and legal framework 
and nit for PPP transactions 
in infrastructure in place by 
2009 
- Number of procedures 
necessary to deal with a 
license reduced from 23 to 
15 by 2009 

Not Achieved. Energy continues to be a serious binding constraint on economic growth in 
Malawi as it is affecting the operations of the private sector as well as being a 
constraining factor for potential foreign investors, especially in the mining sector. The 
Mozambique-Malawi Interconnector project, expected to connect Malawi to the Southern 
African Power Pool and hence allowing Malawi to import up to 50 MW of power, was 
approved by the Bank Board in 2007. However, the IDA credit offer was withdrawn in 
June 2010 after the Government of Malawi at the time indicated that it no longer 
considered it a priority project. The new Malawi government has re-launched discussion 
on this priority regional project with the Government of Mozambique, and it is being 
included in the pipeline for the next CAS. In parallel, IDA financing was proposed for an 
extension of the Kapichira hydropower plant by an additional 64M, representing a 22% 
increase in installed system generation capacity. The Government decided to fund this 
project from its own budget and construction is underway. The Government subsequently 
requested that IDA fund a US$84 million energy project that was approved in June 2011. 
Activities include strengthening and expansion of the transmission and distribution 
systems, studies for new hydropower sites, and energy efficiency activities. The MCC 
Compact was delayed in preparation, was signed in 2011, but was subsequently put on 
hold due to governance challenges until June 2012. This US$350 million program, which 
complements the scope of the Bank-financed energy project, is now beginning its 
implementation.  

Partially Achieved: Better progress was achieved in the transport sector. The Bank’s Road 
Maintenance and Rehabilitation Project (ROMARP), which closed in June 2006, 
established the roads database and the Road Fund and supported significant institutional 
reforms in financing and planning for the roads sector. Investments in roads have resulted 
in a significant improvement of the network: the Ministry of Transport and Public 
Infrastructure reports that the proportion of classified paved roads in good or fair 
condition has increased from 84% in 2007 to 93% in 2010, although the condition of 
unpaved roads has deteriorated from 83% in good or fair condition in 2007 to 65% in 
2010. Government has recently approved an increase in road user charges and expects that 
Road Fund income will cover all maintenance costs within five years. Past poor contract 
management practices have resulted 
in substantial unbudgeted expenditure, but 
Government has now introduced improved controls. The Bank and European Commission 
have supported preparation of a multimodal transport study and the Government is 
preparing a Transport Sector Investment Program. The European Commission, African 
Development Bank, and Japanese International Cooperation Agency are making 
significant investments in the transport sector, primarily in roads. The Bank- financed 
Infrastructure Services Project, whose benefits have been delayed by slow 
implementation, is now starting to contribute to provision of integrated infrastructure 
(electricity, water, sanitation services, roads, and ICT) at five market centers that are 
considered growth corridors. To date, electricity supply has been extended to these 
centers, with the remaining components approaching completion. The current rail network 
concession is not producing the desired quality of service. The proposal to transport coal 
from Tete in Mozambique through Malawi and on to the Indian Ocean port of Nacala is 
coming to fruition, and has attracted nearly US$1 billion in private investment. A 
concession agreement has been signed to construct a new link to the border with Tete 
province, and the EU and the Bank with PPIAF funding are advising Government on 
revision of the agreement for the existing network. 
Partially Achieved. The PPP Bill was published in August 2008 and a PPP policy 
framework approved. A PPP Unit is in place, located in the Privatization Commission. 
The Commission has been instrumental in over 60 transactions in the manufacturing, 
agricultural, telecommunications, tourism, transport, water, banking, and industry sectors. 
Examples include establishment of concessions for Malawi’s rail network and lake 
shipping services and for baggage handling at Lilongwe and Blantyre airports. The 
number of procedures to deal with construction permits has remained constant at 200 
from 2007 to 2012. Cost has come down from 2,931.6 in 2007 to 1,077.5% in 2012 (as a 
percent of income per capita).

Government in defining 
private sector-oriented post-
secondary education 

At the Government’s request, the Bank completed a Financial Sector Assessment Program 
(FSAP) and a Corporate Governance Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes 
(ROSC). Government responded positively to the key recommendations of the FSAP, 
including the drafting and passing of new financial sector laws in microfinance, pensions, 
credit references, insurance, and capital markets. Results of the 2006 Investment Climate 
Assessment (ICA) have been fed into the drafting process of the new Private Sector 
Development (PSD) Policy and Strategy and were also used in the design of BESTAP 
(FY07-FY12). Small and medium enterprises have started accessing matching grants from 
the Business Growth Scheme (BUGS) under BESTAP, which are facilitating business 
growth and improving access to financing. BUGS reimburses 50 percent of costs incurred 
by SMEs in accessing finance (through preparation of business plans, feasibility studies, 
market research, etc.), up to a maximum of US$50,000. Total reimbursements were at 63 
percent, totaling US$1,250,907 as of December 31, 2011(latest figures.  

IFC is seeking to increase its engagement in Malawi, focusing on investments and 
advisory activities that help diversify the economy, develop the micro, small, and medium 
enterprise (MSME) sector and improve access to finance. In June 2008, the IFC 
committed US$5 million to Bakhresa Malawi, a flour milling company, and US$3 million 
was committed to NBS Bank in FY08 under the MSME program. The IFC’s Global Trade 
Finance Program (GTFP) in May 2008, a US$10 million GTFP line, was signed with First 
Merchant Bank (FMB), supporting FMB’s capacity to deliver trade financing to its clients 
by providing risk mitigation to its correspondent banks. FMB has also benefited from 
trade finance training for its staff through IFC GTFP technical assistance programs. IFC’s 
Small and Medium Enterprises Enterprise Development Initiative (SME-EDI) worked 
with the Malawi Export Promotion Council (MEPC) on a countrywide sector mapping 
exercise to identify SME export opportunities and on production of an SME exporter 
handbook, completed in November 2008. In telecommunications, the IFC has provided 
US$15 million to Airtel Malawi (as part of a multi-country program) for a risk-sharing 
facility to increase access to finance for Airtel’s distributors facility using Standard Bank 
as a partner bank.

Decrease vulnerability at the household level to HIV/AIDS and malnutrition.

 Decrease vulnerability as 
measured by: 
5% of sexually active 
women (15-49 years) and 
18% of men (15-49 age) had 
sex with a non-regular 
partner within the past 12 
months by 2009 (down from 
8.3% and 26.9% 
respectively in 2000) 

Achieved. Most of 
the 
indicators, especially those 
related to HIV/AIDS, have 
been exceeded. The general 
epidemiologic trend over the 
past few years has been 
stabilization of the antenatal 
HIV seroprevalence, with a 
decreasing trend from 14% 
to 10.6%. In addition, the 
percent of sexually active 
women (15-49 years) having 
sex with more than one (non-
regular) partner in the last 12 
months decreased from 1.1% 
in 2004 to 0.7% in 2010. The

 

Improved HIV/AIDs 
awareness and access to 
drugs and treatment 
- By 2009, 90% of health 
facilities have drugs for 
opportunistic infections in 
stock with no stock-outs of 
more than one week (by 
district), up from 35 percent 
in 2004. Interim milestone: 
65 percent in 2007. 

- 

- 

165,000 people (85%) living 
with HIV/AIDs are on anti-
retroviral therapy (ART) at 
the end of each year 
beginning in 2009, up from 
57,000 (31%) in 2006. 

60% of facilities are 
delivering Essential Health 
Package (EHP) services, up 
from 10% (2003 baseline), 
by 2008.  

- More than 60% of people 
living with HIV/AIDs 
receive nutrition counseling 
and/or nutritional support.  

Achieved. The number of people living with HIV/AIDS receiving antiretroviral treatment 
(ART) has increased from about 57,000 in 2006 to over 198,846 people in 2010 
exceeding the 165,000 target for 2009. There has been a rapid scale-up of the program 
between 2010 and 2012 with the introduction and scale-up of new treatment guidance. As 
of March 2012 there were 347,938 patients alive and on ART. This represents about 36% 
of the estimated number of persons living with HIV in Malawi. This treatment coverage 
rate is one of the highest in high-prevalence IDA countries in Southern Africa.  

Similar progress was achieved in increasing the number of HIV testing and counseling 
sites and the number of people being tested. In 2001, there were only 14 sites offering 
testing and counseling services. According to the Ministry of Health (MOH), there are 
currently 810 sites in Malawi and in the first three quarters of FY12, 1,249,425 persons 
were counseled, tested, and received their results. This was slightly lower than the target 
and was due primarily to stock-outs of HTC test kits. Over 20 percent of orphans and 
other vulnerable children are receiving free external support (medical, psychosocial, or 
material) and, given underreporting, the actual figure is likely to be considerably higher.  

In September 2008, the proportion of health facilities stocking various drugs for 
opportunistic infections ranged above 80 percent without stock-outs. The MOH reports 
that most districts are improving in terms of stock-outs and that tracer drugs were above 
85% available in 2012, although some drugs, such as LA (first line Rx for malaria), 
Cotrimoxizole, Metronidazole, Ampicillin, and Niverapine were usually out of stock, as 
were HIV/AIDS reagents. 

By 2009, 65% of facilities were delivering the Essential Health Package. 

Nonetheless, the number of new infections is estimated to be between 70,000 and 90,000 
per year, significantly increasing the number of people who will eventually require 
treatment, and treatment costs per person are expected to treble as Malawi phases in the 
new WHO treatment guidelines. 

The Additional Financing to the original HIV/AIDS project supported and strengthened 
the national response to HIV/AIDS in line with the Government’s National Action 
Framework, and is financing another three years of the national program. It is financially 
contributing toward implementation of the joint program of work within the HIV/AIDS 
SWAP, which is co-financed by multiple donors and the Government of Malawi. Priority 
has been given to ensuring that the momentum developed in HIV testing and treatment is 
continued, and that more effort is placed on supporting evidence-based prevention 
strategies. 

Cumulatively 37,571 malnourished ART/TB patients are receiving therapeutic feeding. 
The annual target is 8,000 new patients.

Partially Achieved. Scaling up of results-based targeted nutrition information programs 
was not fully achieved under this CAS. The detailed joint PATH/USAID/World Bank 
study on infant and young child feeding practices was delivered and disseminated in 2010. 
The results of this study informed policy dialogue toward a focused communication 
program which is being scaled up to national level: USAID has started to support 
communication programs in 11 districts since early 2012, and the Government with donor

support will be scaling up to the remaining 27 districts. Notwithstanding the delay in the 
roll-out of nutrition programs, a nationwide awareness and information campaign was 
undertaken. There has also been an increase in the number of orphans and vulnerable 
children supported with nutritional, psychosocial, financial, and educational support from 
200,000 in 2004 to 2,651,700 in 2008. The introduction of a social cash transfer program 
in 2006 has benefitted a total of 70,125 individuals, up from 18,180 households, as of 
December 2008. There has been an increase in the number of households receiving 
external assistance in the past 12 months to care for adults who have been chronically ill 
for three or more months, from 19,706 households in 2003 to 744,062 in 2008. There also 
has been an increase in the number of community-based organizations providing support 
to orphans and vulnerable children from 300 in 2003 to 2,000 in 2008. 

Donor coordination is pursued through various forums. Since 2010, nutrition donors meet 
monthly in the Donor Nutrition Security Group (DoNutS). The Government has reached 
out to donors through the Scaling Up Nutrition (SUN) movement, which provides a 
common platform for nutrition programming led by Government institutions. Government 
and stakeholders regularly meet under the SUN Task Force. In addition, there is the 
Government and Development Partners Nutrition Committee, which discusses broader 
nutrition policy issues. 

An $80 million Nutrition and HIV/AIDS project was approved by the Bank in FY12. 
Other donors, for example Ireland and CIDA, are contributing to the Nutrition element of 
the project. 

Achieved. With funding from the Building Resilient Communities Trust Fund, the Bank 
supported the development of a Social Support Policy to promote an integrated approach 
to social protection investments. Malawi’s Social Support Policy was approved —with a 
delay of over two years—by the Cabinet in June 2012 and will form the basis for a new 
Social Protection Program envisaged under the next CAS. Under the Malawi Social 
Action Fund (MASAF) 3 APL II (FY 08), US$35 million has been provided in 2012 as 
Additional Financing to support a public works cash transfer program through local 
government and the Local Development Fund, in order to assist about 600,000 of the 
poorest households (self-targeting) to purchase agricultural inputs, grains, and other basic 
necessities in the event of food security-related shocks. Through the use of Community 
Score Cards, under MASAF community accountability has increased as a result of the 
Information, Education and Communication campaigns that were undertaken. An 
assessment of the targeting process under the MASAF 3 PWP intervention indicated that 
the program targeted 93% of the intended beneficiaries, with a 7% inclusion error. This 
has led to refinement of the targeting method—effectively engaging more of the 
community in a participatory way to identify food-insecure beneficiaries.  

After the late December 2009 earthquakes in the Karonga area, the World Bank 
responded quickly with immediate assistance from GFDRR (Track III funds and staff) 
and in early January the Bank was among the first institutions to respond to the 
earthquake with a light Damage and Loss Assessment, which brought more clarity on the 
extent of the damage, which was concentrated in housing and schools. The first 
Additional Financing for MASAF, approved in 2010, was partially focused to help rebuild 
these buildings, with better earthquake-resistant standards.  

Both Additional Financing Credits have supported the districts In the South that have 
continuously been hit by drought.

- Annual agreements on

Partially Achieved. All six reviews of the IMF-funded PRGF program between 2005 and 
2008 were successfully concluded. However, progress was more problematic between 
2009 and early 2012. In 2009, Malawi implemented the Exogenous Shocks Facility 
(ESF), a one-year program designed to assist Malawi to overcome external shocks 
associated with the 2008 global fuel and food crises. This program expired on December 
2, 2009, without formal completion of the review, because of slippages in the first half of 
2009, especially in public spending, leading to much higher domestic borrowing than 
expected and lower reserves. In early 2010, Malawi concluded a new, ECF–supported 
program with the IMF. After a successful review in late 2010, it went off-track in mid-
2011. Only after a new Government initiated major reforms in May 2012 was a new 
program agreed upon and the IMF Board approved a new three-year arrangement for 
Malawi under the Extended Credit Facility (ECF). The first quarterly ECF review is 
scheduled for late October 2012.  

Partially achieved: Implementation of the recommendations from internal and external 
audit below the targeted 100%. While Audit Committees are in place in a number of 
ministries and departments, only a few are functioning and/or meeting regularly. This 

85 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Malawi Country Assistance Strategy FY13–16 

continues to hamper effective follow-up of audit reports and implementation of audit 
recommendations. As part of the PFEMRP, Government has reiterated its commitment to 
revive the internal audit functions and the first project to be funded out of the PFEMRP 
Multi Donor Trust Fund (MDTF) will support strengthening of internal audit. 

100% of internal and NAO 
audit recommendations

Achieved: 85% of staff from Government ministries and departments were certified at 
different levels by CIPS by December 2008, and are still serving Government, so the 
target has been met. However, of 6 officers from the Office of Director of Public 
Procurement (ODPP) that were trained up to master’s degree level in procurement and 
supply chain management through the closed FMTAP, 5 officers have left the Directorate 
and a completely new team is in place.

- 

75% of professional officers

Partially achieved: External auditing and parliamentary scrutiny of financial accounts has 
registered considerable improvements, however, challenges in the quality of audit and 
follow-up on audit queries remain. The focus of Bank support under the PRSC I-III was 
on increasing the percentage of central government entities audited, reducing audit 
backlog, and follow-up actions to issues raised by the Public Accounts Committee (PAC). 
As a result, audit coverage has now reached 58 percent (target: 50 percent). On audit 
follow up, all the audit reports submitted to Parliament for years ended June 2006, 2007, 
2008, 2009, and 2010 have been scrutinized and discussed by the PAC. This implies that 
the PAC is current in terms of scrutinizing all the reports that were submitted including a 
Treasury Minute for the year ended June 2004. However, Government is aware of the 
backlog of Treasury Minutes due to irregular PAC meetings resulting from funding 
challenges. With increased funding to Parliament, PAC is able to meet more regularly to 
scrutinize audit reports. The Government has currently submitted a Treasury Minute for 
2005 to 2007 financial years to Parliament. The Government is stepping up its efforts to 
work on more recent Treasury Minutes and make necessary follow-ups with controlling 
officers who have been identified to have issues. Efforts are also reported to be underway 
to fill in the position of the Auditor General who resigned recently.  

Achieved: Personnel records and payroll data are now generated and managed within 
HRMIS and these processes are being carried out by both the line ministry and the 
Department of Public Service Management (DPSM). Concurrently, an audit of the entire 
civil service database was carried out in 2008. The personnel audit verified genuine 
employees but also found around 700 ghost workers, who were eventually removed from 
the payroll. The introduction of payments through the banking system for all government 
transactions in January 2011 has also helped to address the issue of ghost workers. In 
FY2010/11 alone, 4,878 ghost workers were deleted from the system.  

Malawi has taken steps to strengthen its public procurement system, moving from a 
centralized procurement system without procurement law to a decentralized one with a 
procurement legal framework. A Public Procurement Act (PPA) was enacted in 2003 and 
an Office of the Director of Public Procurement (ODPP) created in 2004. It is quite 
evident that the country has made significant efforts to improve the quality and standard 
of its procurement system, but a lot is yet to be accomplished. Progress has been largely 
hampered by inadequate human capacity and financial resources, data availability 
problems, noncompliance with procurement rules and procedures as well as insufficient 
procurement information. The PPA is generally recognized to be in line with international 
standards, though it does not adequately address some issues, such as decentralized 
procurement arrangements and asset management and disposal; currently, the Act is being 
further revised.  
Achieved: The FY 2009 GoM budget is Government Finance Statistics (GFS) compliant. 
The new budget structure now comprises 19 standardized programs and sub-programs in 
line with the 2001 GFS classifications, from 52 program classifications in previous 
budgets. The new COA was fully implemented in the FY12 national budget. The 2011

PEFA assessment showed improved scores in the areas of classification of the budget and 
comprehensiveness of information included in the budget documentation, from a rating of 
B in 2008 to a rating of A in the 2011 PEFA. 

Partially Achieved. While all ministries have internal audit units and internal audit 
committees (IACs), only 16 of the largest MDAs out of 22 had functional IACs that 
actively met in 2008. This ensured coverage of about 75% of public expenditures. As of 
December 2010, only one IAC out of the six key spending ministries was reported to have 
an active Internal Audit. Non-functioning IACs continues to hamper effective follow-up 
of audit reports and implementation of audit recommendations. Efforts are now being 
geared toward injecting a new lease on life into the IAC with the recent approval of the 
Internal Audit Charter, which clearly specifies the Terms of Reference for the IACs and 
their roles and responsibilities. As the result, the IACs in the six key spending ministries 
started meeting regularly as of June 2011. 

Partially achieved: The Government has catalogued recommendations presented in the 
2008 PETS and 2006 PERS reports. The document was then circulated to all concerned 
sectors with a letter requesting them to provide updates on what has been done to 
implement the recommendations and address the issues that were raised in the reports in 
April 2011. 

Achieved: Previously MASAF used to have regional offices and sub-regional offices that 
were seen as parallel systems to local council operations. These were abolished and 
therefore the MASAF 3 APL II Project, which became effective in 2009 only, has the 
Technical Support Team at the national level. The entire project funding to the local 
councils passes through the National Local Government Finance Committee, as is the 
case with the transfers from the central government. All implementation is handled by the 
councils.

Annex 3: Poverty Context 

Poverty in Malawi remains widespread and concentrated in rural areas According to the recent 

report of the Third Integrated Household Survey (IHS3 2010/11); the absolute poverty rate has 
declined only slightly, from 52.4 percent (IHS2 2004/05) to 50.7 percent. While the poverty levels 
for urban areas declined from 25.4 percent in 2005 to 17.3 percent in 2011, they worsened slightly in 
rural areas, from 55.9 percent to 56.6 percent, during the same period. 20 Acute poverty affected 25 

percent of the national population (compared with 22 percent in 2004/05), 4 percent of the urban 
population, and 28 percent of the rural population. National consumption inequality, measured 
through the Gini coefficient, has risen sharply from 0.39 to 0.45, mostly driven by the dynamics 
in rural areas, where the Gini coefficient rose from 0.34 to 0.38 while staying roughly constant in 
urban areas at about 0.49. A rise in rural inequality could explain how average incomes rose in 
Malawi while living standards for the rural poor stagnated. Malawi’s inequality is still below that 
of neighboring Zambia (one of the highest Ginis in SSA at 0.50), but higher than Tanzania 
(0.34). Thus, while the increase in inequality is troubling and needs further investigation, if 
Malawi is able to contain the increase in the next decade, the forecast for poverty reduction is 
brighter.

According to the IHS 3, the proportions of poor and acutely poor people were found to be 
highest in rural areas in the south (63% poor and 34% acutely poor) and in the north (59% poor 
and 29% acutely poor). Poverty has been driven by limited access to education and production 
assets, shocks affecting agricultural productivity, and lack of diversification and access to 
markets. Poverty is also exacerbated by a high population growth rate (about 3 percent), high 
population density, and HIV/AIDS prevalence. Nationally, the heads of the poorest households 
have less schooling, are older, and are more likely to be female than the heads of better-off 

20 The difference between the IHS2 and the IHS3 national absolute poverty rates is not statistically significant. The 
IHS3 rural poverty rate is also statistically indistinguishable from its IHS2 counterpart.

households. The poverty gap and the severity of poverty measures confirm that the worst poverty 
is concentrated in rural areas in the most densely populated south and north, while the central 
region is better off. Urban areas have much lower percentages of people below the poverty line 
(17 percent), and they also have the lowest share of the acutely poor (4 percent). Therefore, any 
strategy to reduce poverty in Malawi and make growth more inclusive must include a leading 
role for rural growth and development, with a substantial focus on smallholder agriculture, 
tourism development, infrastructure, and other non-farm employment creation.  

Preliminary Analysis 

Growth incidence analysis shows that real incomes of the rural poor are falling and only the 
better-off households experience some growth in real expenditures. In order to understand what 
is behind this trend, there is a need to analyze the crop portfolio, market participation, overall 
household activity, and portfolio and income structure changes over time. This result also raises 
concerns about the impact on poor rural households of the Farm Input Subsidy Program (FISP) 
introduced in 2005/06 on poor rural households and specifically the beneficiary targeting 
methodology. What is clear is that despite large state outlays to input subsidy programs, rural 
poverty has not declined. Distribution of fertilizer and seed under the FISP is intended to benefit 
poor households selected by communities with support from district councils and agricultural 
district officials, as well as traditional authorities. While improvements in FISP targeting are 
noted in the past two planting seasons and there was increased transparency (open meetings and 
clearer selection criteria), evidence still points to significant redistribution, sharing, and reselling 
of fertilizer and seeds.  

The other dimension of poverty in rural areas that may explain this result is the structural 
deficiencies of the local farming system, characterized by the small size of land holdings (less 
than 1 hectare for almost 60% of the farms), no equipment, and limited or no livestock (imposing 
a limitation on both sources of income and soil fertility management). In that context, emphasis 
on FISP benefits may not be expected realistically to make a sustainable difference, and fertilizer 
might be of better use for many poor households if re-sold (in addition to social pressure to 
share).  

Preliminary comparative analysis (IHS2 and IHS3) indicates that there has been some 
specialization in crop production toward maize at the expense of other crops. In such a situation, 
if returns of that specialization less than compensate for the loss of crops households choose not 
to grow, overall incomes will fall. Preliminary evidence also shows that proceeds from maize are 
also stagnating in terms of value, and sales continue to be very concentrated in relatively better- 
off households. This would be consistent with the low levels of consumption expenditure among 
the poor. The initial results seem to suggest that as a result of the expanded FISP, households 
tended to specialize in maize and in doing so reduced other streams of income so that the net 
gains of that dynamic are negative.

Malawi Country Assistance Strategy FY13–16 

The IHS3 is a very rich data set and will provide the basis for thorough analysis of the 
determinants of household well-being in all areas and all groups in Malawi. The value of the HIS 
data will be elevated with the planned Integrated Household Panel Survey (IHPS) 2013, which 
will track and re-interview about 25 percent of the IHS3 sample. The two datasets will be 
instrumental in depicting movements in and out of poverty, and the correlates of chronic vs. 
transient poverty status in Malawi, Other questions that could be tackled with the data include: 
What were the sources of growth in consumption at the household level, and what were the 
sources of the growth in inequality? Analysis should help identify the winners and the losers, and 
more importantly the factors underlying these processes. Did Government policies help some but 
not others? Did the increase in food and other commodity prices hurt some while others 
benefited? Did some farmers suffer more from shocks than others? What characterizes those 
households in the groups that appear to have gained from growth?  

Planned Poverty Analysis Work and Technical Assistance 

In the coming months, the Bank, through a series of policy notes, will analyze these data in 
search of answers to these questions and others, starting with analysis of the behavior, 
livelihoods, and welfare of rural households, as well as establish the link between farming 
household assets, farm size, and poverty level. The rural and agricultural population should not 
be treated as one homogenous group; a farm typology based on IHS3 data may show that the 
situation of less poor agricultural households has improved while the situation of the poorest 
farmers has deteriorated, leading to a slight increase of the aggregate poverty level in rural areas. 
In addition, the introduction of a stricter yield measurement methodology combining traditional 
field surveys and remote sensing tools (satellite imagery) could better assess real productivity 
gains of FISP beneficiaries. These analyses may result in questioning the impact of the FISP and 
have major implications for FISP design and its underlying objective in terms of deciding 
whether it is meant to be a social safety net program or a program to increase agricultural 
productivity. The Bank will also make use of available research on Malawi and will explore 
opportunities to collaborate with researchers from DECRG (as outlined in Box 3 in the text) and 
from academia in areas of interest.  

On technical assistance, the Bank Living Standards Measurement Study Team within DECPI has 
been collaborating with the National Statistical Office (NSO) on a multi-year program with the 
objective of designing and implementing the IHS3 in 2010/11 and IHPS in 2013. As part of this 
work program, the NSO has been and will continue to be supported by a strong LSMS field 
presence through a resident advisor, and frequent missions from Bank headquarters. Bank 
support to the IHS3 and the IHPS is within the cross-country nationally-representative panel 
household survey program in sub-Saharan Africa known as the LSMS-Integrated Surveys on 
Agriculture (LSMS-ISA) initiative. The IHS3 was also supported by Norway, DFID, Irish Aid, 
and MCC, and it is likely that multiple donors will contribute to the implementation of the IHPS 
as well. The World Bank also provided technical assistance to the NSO on finalization of the 
analysis of the results from the IHS3, including the CPI Technical Assistance to support the 
exercise of coming up with new poverty numbers. As part of the Bank’s Open Data Access 
initiative and the LSMS-ISA mandate, the IHS3 data was made publicly available on the LSMS 
website within 12 months of field work completion. Under the new CAS, the Bank plans to

Annex 6: Mainstreaming Gender 
Gender Results Monitoring Framework 

Strengthen Mainstreaming of Gender throughout the Portfolio 
During the CAS period the county team will further increase the integration of gender issues into 
proposed and on-going activities as appropriate. In preparation for the CAS, a gender assessment 
and a portfolio review were carried out in close consultation with the Country Team. Gender 
issues in the country identified by the assessment are reflected in the CAS report and priority 
gender-responsive actions have been identified to respond to these issues based on review of the 
current and pipeline portfolios. The Bank’s gender program during the CAS period will focus on 
the following three national gender equality areas:  
• 
equal access to education,  

• 

• 

equal access to financial markets and land, and  

income opportunities for rural women.  

Interventions in these areas are supported by analytical work. The following sub-sectors 
contribute to the key response areas: education, water, financial, environment, agriculture, and 
social. 

Moreover, under the FY13 - 16 CAS, the goal will be to further expand an empirically-based 
gender-informed approach to reducing poverty in Malawi, utilizing a portfolio of operations and 
analytical work where gender is explicitly and appropriately incorporated and features 
prominently in supervision and implementation support. Key measures to monitor progress 
toward this goal are assessment of whether a project has “a gender-responsive design” and 
“gender in the Project Results Framework.” Table A6.1 supports the goal of a more gender-
informed portfolio 21.  

21 The following principles have been used to establish baseline data: For a project to be rated “yes” as having a 
“gender responsive design,” the PAD would demonstrate that (a) there has been a gender analysis as part of the 
social assessment during project preparation or relevant diagnosis and recommendations from a Country Gender 
Assessment (by the Bank or partners) has been adopted; and (b) the results of that analysis have informed project 
design, as indicated by at least one of the following: (i) specific project policy or activity that seeks to promote 
gender equality through either gender targeted or universal policy/project intervention; or (ii) at least one gender-
specific target or indicator in the Results Framework. The Project Results Framework will be used as reference 
because it is the binding agreement between the Bank and the government and thus would be the basis for 
accountability and performance rating.

Annex 7: CAS Stakeholder Consultations 

1. 
Between December 2010 and July 2012, the WBG held consultations with government 
officials, civil society, the private sector, academia, media, and development partners to draw up 
a new strategy to support Malawi’s Second Growth and Development Strategy (MDGS II, 2011-
2016). The consultations, which were face-to-face, were held in all three geographic regions of 
the country, in Blantyre, Lilongwe, and Mzuzu, which are the hub cities for stakeholders. More 
than 150 institutions were represented in these consultations.  

2. 
Two sets of consultations were held during the administrations of two different Malawi 
presidents. The first set ran from December 2010 to April 2012, when the late President 
Mutharika was in power, during which substantive work was done on the CAS. The Government 
program that informed the CAS was the draft MDGS II. After his death in April 2012, President 
Banda and her Cabinet quickly approved the MDGS II in April but in early July the president 
held a national symposium to further rationalize priorities to revive the economy. The 
symposium identified five areas: agriculture, energy, mining, tourism, and infrastructure. This 
necessitated a second round of consultations with Government to validate the draft CAS in view 
of the change in political leadership and identification of new priorities. A second round of 
consultations was also held with development partners through the Heads of Cooperation.  

3. 
The first round of consultations was guided by a Concept Note that identified three 
themes: (i) Promoting sustainable, diversified, and inclusive growth; (ii) enhancing human 
capital and reducing vulnerabilities; and (iii) mainstreaming governance for enhanced 
development effectiveness. The consultations sought stakeholder views of these themes and 
obtained feedback about specifics to be covered under each theme. 

4. 
Stakeholders generally endorsed the three thematic areas. With regard to Theme 1, they 
recommended that the CAS (i) promote commercialization, agro-processing, and value addition 
as a basis for growth of the agricultural sector; (ii) trade promotion and empowerment of micro-, 
small, and medium enterprises; (iii) development of energy supply (one stakeholder said, “Power 
shortages severely constrain private sector growth and access to ICT services, thereby inhibiting 
poverty reduction efforts. Access to power should therefore be one of the key priorities for 
Malawi as well as for the World Bank”) and (iv) infrastructure, with suggestions to have it stand 
alone as a pillar and “not hidden in the other pillars, since so many other developments are 
dependent on infrastructure.” 

5. 
For Theme 2, stakeholders gave priority to issues of jobs, health, climate and 
environmental degradation: (i) development of entrepreneurial skills to enable educated people 
to become employers (there was concern that the CAS was silent on unemployment issues); (ii) 
primary school health should be an important element; (iii) nutrition is a weak sector requiring 
both funds and institutional strengthening; (iv) the WBG’s silence on health is not good for 
Malawi; (v) climate change should be a priority area because it will affect agriculture and energy 
if not considered critically; and (vi) environmental degradation especially in relation to the Shire. 

6. 
For Theme 3, stakeholders observed that governance should not be about systems and 
capacity only, but there should also be an emphasis on checks and balances. They also asked that 

102 

 
 
 
 
 
Malawi Country Assistance Strategy FY13–16 

the WBG be more specific about how it is going to engage with civil society and the media and 
make corruption a salient governance issue.  

7. 
While commending the WBG’s selectivity, stakeholders also bemoaned the size of the 
IDA envelope for Malawi. Suggestions were made to have a larger envelope for fewer sectors to 
have more impact than is currently the case. 

8. 
Government and development partners had their own issues in addition to some of those 
raised above. The government view was that the CAS Concept Note was generally well aligned 
with the MGDS II. “The first theme is particularly in the same direction as the MGDS II. So too 
are the issues on diversification, productivity, public management, and skills,” said the Principal 
Secretary for Development Planning. On the scheduling of proposed operations and analytical 
work, the government urged for timing that enables a better tie-in between its program and 
proposed WBG-supported operations. The government welcomed the idea of reduced covenants 
because covenants delay implementation. While agreeing with the proposed analytical work 
program, government representatives requested more AAA on issues of land and urban 
development. Government stakeholders also keenly followed the presentations on the new Africa 
Strategy. Observing that Malawi is reflected in the AFR strategy, they wondered why the CAS 
CN does not articulate gender and CSO issues as clearly as the AFR strategy does. 

9. 
Development partners raised questions about collaboration, systems, and some project- 
specific matters. They observed that the WBG’s collaboration with other partners in such sectors 
as education is quite strong but the CAS does not truly reflect coordination issues. They also 
called for more collaboration where there are high degrees of synergy and overlap with other 
donors. They wanted to know if the proposed program has a built-in efficiency system to ensure 
value for money. On specific operations, they wanted to know if some projects, such as 
BESTAP, would have follow-ups; involvement of other development partners in EITI; more 
information on regional initiatives, such as regional rail; and how the WBG sees partnerships 
evolving in new sectors, such as nutrition. Commenting on the AFR strategy, they were pleased 
with the decentralization of knowledge hubs and the opportunity to access WBG expertise closer 
to Malawi. 

10. 
In the second round of consultations with Government, it was agreed that the CAS was 
generally in line with Government priorities, but there were specific requests about, e.g., 
prioritizing power generation, which is a serious problem for Malawi; the supply chain for 
agricultural produce; supporting industry; transport infrastructure, especially for cross-border 
trade; and doing more in higher education. 

11. 
The development partners in their second round also noted that Malawi’s problems had 
not changed with the regime change, so the CAS was still in sync with Malawi’s needs. There 
was commendation on the inclusion of vocational training and suggestions about stepping up 
civil service capacity, including that of ministers; incorporating corruption to keep pressure on 
governance; better coordination with the more numerous donors interested in commercial 
agriculture; and recognizing urbanization as a risk, since Malawi is one of the fastest urbanizing 
countries yet is not prepared for it. Some partners indicated interest in keeping in touch with the 
Bank on regional integration issues.

Annex 8: Social Accountability in the Malawi Portfolio  

Social accountability refers to the broad range of actions and mechanisms beyond voting that 
citizens can use to hold the state to account, as well as actions on the part of government, civil 
society, media, and other societal actors that promote or facilitate these efforts. Pillar 3 of this 
new CAS covers social accountability. This table outlines social accountability tools that various 
projects in the entire portfolio, continuing and new, could use to promote citizen participation in 
engaging authorities in achieving results and staying accountable. Individual projects will 
therefore be expected to make budgetary provision for social accountability activities.  

Social 
Accountability 
Method 
Policies/Plans  

Description of Tools 
under Method 
(National  Local) 
Participatory policy 
making and planning: 
Consensus conferences, 
local issue forums, and 
citizen juries will be used 
in components that 
require stakeholder input 
in developing policies 
and guidelines.  

Examples of Projects Where  
Tool Is Applicable 

Mining: Mineral revenue 
management and transparency 
issues 

Shire River Basin Management: 
Development of catchment 
management guideline. 

Budgets  

Citizen involvement in 
preparing and analyzing 
public budgets: Civil 
society analysis of the 
impact and implications 
of budget allocations; 
raising awareness of 
decentralized budgets, 
and training communities 
on monitoring local 
activity budgets 

Education and Local 
Development Fund: These 
projects provide funds at local 
levels where communities are 
engaged in a number of 
activities. Communities should 
be empowered to appreciate and 
review budget allocations 
against delivery. 

DPOs: Accommodation of 
public views 

Expenditures 

Public expenditure 
tracking surveys: The 
surveys themselves, 
social audits, and specific 
budget websites to 
promote transparency. 

Agriculture: Substantive 
resources go to this sector as the 
backbone of the economy, and 
more than 75 percent of 
Malawians depend on it. 
Tracking expenditures is 
therefore of national interest. 

Education: Participatory 
tracking of primary education 

104 

Remarks 

Government actors should be 
provided the necessary support 
to be proactive in seeking 
citizen input on policy and 
planning issues. CSOs have 
already been vocal on both 
mining revenue and 
environmental issues, so 
detailed planning/ 
implementation of social 
accountability methods will 
take into consideration such 
issues.  
CSOs and the media already 
analyze national budget 
allocations for various sectors. 
Relevant projects should 
therefore further support them 
in analyzing budgeting and 
impact at project level and also 
train local communities in 
budget literacy. The 
government has already 
established a system of 
consulting the public when 
developing budgets. However, 
concerns remain on how far 
government accommodates 
public views. Should it be more 
consultation or collaboration in 
budget development? 
Information is disseminated 
through the use of media, 
publications, and public 
meetings. Dissemination 
activities should be properly 
budgeted for and undertaken 
not just to inform but also to 
empower citizens with 
information and facts to engage 
the government positively for

Services/goods  

M&E of public services 
and goods: This 
establishes the relevance, 
quality, and accessibility 
of goods and services 
that the project was 
designed to provide. 
Since it is the citizens 
themselves who are on 
the receiving end of 
goods and services, tools 
here require citizen 
participation in drawing 
up indicators. Tools 
include citizen report 
cards, community 
scorecards, public 
hearings, public opinion 
polls, and citizens’ 
charters. 
Public oversight  Public oversight over the 
WBG program: WBG 
accountability and 
transparency to the 
public should also 
improve. Currently, this 
is done in the context of 
reviewing the MDGs, 
which includes CSOs, 
and less proactively with 
the public. 

Examples of Projects Where  
Tool Is Applicable 

expenditures and capacitating 
sector Parliamentary 
Committees to engage Ministry 
on timely and appropriate 
spending to expedite progress in 
education results 
A number of projects in the 
portfolio would benefit from the 
use of these tools, especially 
ICT-based ones which use 
mobile phones to monitor and 
evaluate goods and services. 
These projects include FSTAP, 
Education, Mining, MASAF, 
Shire River Basin Management, 
Nutrition, Energy, and ASWAp. 

Entire WBG program in 
Malawi: Empower CSOs, 
parliamentarians, and media to 
participate in implementation. 
Also, present results of CAS 
reviews to the general public,

completion reports for lessons 
learned to relevant stakeholders.  

Remarks 

improvements.  

Most of the tools for services 
and goods require thorough 
logistics and good skills to 
capture and synthesize salient 
issues arising from various 
project sites. When properly 
developed and utilized, these 
tools help improve operational 
results and process outcomes 
(e.g., institutional changes). 

The proposed Social 
Accountability Committee 
should consider liaising with 
the Open Development 
Technology Alliance (the 
World Bank ICT Knowledge 
Platform) - http://opendta.org/ 

Initial steps to help such 
constituencies as CSOs, 
Parliamentarians, and the 
media to understand the Bank 
project cycle have been taken. 
The new CAS should take 
further steps by more actively 
engaging some of these 
stakeholders in the 
implementation so that they are 
better empowered to provide 
oversight. Also, there is need to 
publicize results of the MDG 
reviews with specific notes on 
WBG performance. The CAS 
budget should provide for 
WBG accountability to the 
public.
