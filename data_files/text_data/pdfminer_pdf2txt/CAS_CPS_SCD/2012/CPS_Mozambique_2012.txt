EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

i. 
Overall Context.  The launch of the proposed Mozambique Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) 
for FY12-15 comes at a momentous period in the country’s impressive post-conflict journey; one which 
many analysts suggest has propelled the nation to a unique point of inflection. The optimism that 
accompanied the previous CPS for FY08-11, after two decades of growth and poverty reduction, has been 
replaced by sober but purposeful deliberation over Mozambique’s path to development.  In recent years, 
Government and donors have had to grapple with a deceleration of poverty reduction in the face of strong 
growth; social unrest that closely preceded those in the Arab world; a drop in the Human Development 
Index and Doing Business country rankings, and the broader perception of reform deceleration; the 
likelihood of increased pressure and decreased aid among bilateral donors; and serious capacity 
constraints to manage increasingly important natural resources, including significant coal and newly 
discovered gas deposits which by all accounts will be a ―game changer‖ for Mozambique’s future. Thus, 
while significant challenges of sustaining stability and building a more equitable society persist, the 
upside potential of leveraging its strong post-conflict performance towards transformative growth in the 
medium to longer-term, is enormous and almost second to none in Sub-Saharan Africa.             

ii. 
Recent Economic Developments and Prospects.  Since the end of the two-decade long civil war 
in 1992, Mozambique has had to play catch up with the rest of the world.  Macroeconomic stability, 
structural reforms, and reconstruction drove post-conflict growth which has been sustained over the past 
decade by enclave mega-projects in mining and energy production.  The country has weathered the global 
economic and financial crises, with economic growth dipping to 6.3 percent in 2009 but projected to have 
risen to 7.2 percent in 2011.  Increased infrastructure spending as well as foreign investments in new 
mega-projects are expected to drive economic growth to 8 percent over the medium-term.          

iii. Development Challenges.  The deceleration of poverty reduction in the face of robust economic 
growth is the defining development challenge in today’s Mozambique.  The challenge is to diversify the 
sources of economic growth; integrate capital-intensive mega-projects with the Government’s poverty 
reduction strategy; and develop the agriculture sector which employs close to 80 percent of the workforce 
but remains largely unproductive, subsistence-based, and where there is a growing ―feminization of 
poverty.‖  More broadly, Mozambique needs to accelerate investment climate reforms; improve provision 
of public goods to facilitate inclusive growth (e.g., infrastructure, education, health); set up well-targeted 
safety nets for the most vulnerable; and promote greater voice and citizen participation while building 
transparent and accountable systems, including those related to extractive industries.             

iv. Government’s Poverty Reduction Strategy.  The Plano de Acção de Redução de Pobreza 
(PARP) for 2011-14 is the third Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) and aims to reinvigorate the 
poverty reduction agenda to foster more inclusive growth.  It specifically recognizes the empowerment of 
women as a decisive factor in poverty eradication and economic growth.  Acknowledging the need to 
diversify sources of growth, the PARP looks to complement efforts to improve service delivery with an 
economic strategy to boost productivity in labor-intensive sectors and unleash the structural 
transformation of the economy.  The PARP is built on three main pillars: (a) increasing production and 
productivity for the agricultural and fisheries sectors; (b) promoting employment; and (c) fostering human 
and social development.  Two supporting pillars focus on good governance and macroeconomic stability.

v. 
Lessons Learned.  The CPS Completion Report (CR) in Annex 2 identified the following lessons:  
(a) an appropriate program of analytic work to underpin Bank programs and projects is needed to inform 
public debate on key development issues, including the entry points for economic transformation; (b) the 
CPS should be a living document and updated and monitored at mid-term with updated monitoring 
indicators; (c) Bank lending instruments should be chosen and sequenced more strategically to address 
sectoral bottlenecks and implementation capacity constraints; and (d) staffing and management vacancies 
affected the overall program delivery and results, and should have been addressed more expeditiously.     

vi. CPS Pillars and Outcomes.  The CPS for FY12-15 takes as its starting point the Government’s 
PARP, with its theme of inclusive and broad-based growth.  The Africa Regional Strategy also provides 
an overall framework for setting priorities and managing the proposed program.  Like the Africa Regional 
Strategy, the CPS has two cross-cutting pillars and a foundation:  

Competitiveness and employment.  In view of structural issues and growth and poverty trends, 
the Bank looks to help improve the regulatory environment; prioritize investments through spatial 
planning; enhance agricultural productivity and employment in potential growth sectors; improve 
provision of transport, water, energy, and other infrastructure; and promote an educated, skilled, 
and healthy workforce. 

Vulnerability and resilience.  Given the country’s susceptibility to idiosyncratic and exogenous 
shocks, the Bank aims to help improve health services for the vulnerable; strengthen social 
protection; and encourage climate change adaptation and reduce vulnerability to natural disasters.              

Governance and public sector capacity.  Key to achieving the country’s development objectives 
is improved public financial management, particularly at the sector and local levels; improved 
citizen participation in service delivery monitoring; greater contribution of wildlife conservation to 
the economy; and improved transparency in extractive industries. 

In addition, the CPS aims to mainstream gender, social accountability, and nutrition in the portfolio.  On 
gender, the Bank will build on an already solid track record of addressing gender equality during project 
preparation and implementation.  There is broad scope to introduce social accountability mechanisms, 
particularly in projects seeking to improve service delivery. A parallel strategy to incorporate social 
accountability is currently under discussion.  Similarly, with chronic malnutrition among the worst in the 
world, nutrition-related activities are planned for active and pipeline operations, as appropriate.             

vii. CPS Program and Resources.  The CPS for FY12-15 will be supported by IDA 16: the notional 
envelope is US$1.04 billion for the first three years of the CPS period.  IDA resources will continue to be 
supplemented by trust funds, parallel and basket financing, and used strategically to catalyze and leverage 
donor and private sector financing.  Given the potential for the mineral and gas sectors, agribusiness, 
tourism, and other sectors, as well as the Government’s desire for the Bank to be a catalyst for large and 
complex infrastructure projects, the Bank will look at the range of instruments, including IBRD enclave 
financing, and will ensure coherence and complementarity with IFC and MIGA.  The Bank will also 
generate greater knowledge products, including South-South knowledge exchange across a range of areas.      

viii. Risks.  Risks include: (a) weak government capacity to coordinate and implement key cross 
sectoral reforms and operations, and to manage the extractive industry sector, including private sector 
participation; (b) elevated social 
tensions particularly among urban unemployed youth; (c) 

2 

 
macroeconomic shocks and their impact on the Government’s reform program;  and (d) reduced donor 
aid. 

I. COUNTRY CONTEXT AND DEVELOPMENT AGENDA 

1. 
The Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for FY12-15 will be implemented during a period of 
inflection in Mozambique’s history.  Over the medium-term, the country has an opportunity to lay the 
basis for a marked transformation of its social and economic structure. For now, the latest household 
survey indicates that despite impressive growth rates over two decades, the pace of poverty reduction has 
been disappointing.1  Social unrest in recent years underlines the vulnerability of large segments of the 
population and is the impetus behind a more inclusive growth strategy. The CPS will also coincide with 
the final push to achieve the 2015 Millennium Development Goals (MDGs): many are within reach but 
will require a determined effort by all stakeholders. Meanwhile, Mozambique is at the cusp of a major 
―game changer‖ in the form of its vast mining and oil and gas sectors, which are at world-class scale and 
could generate sizeable resources for needed public investments in the long run. The next two years will 
be a critical window to make the appropriate policy and investment decisions that will shape the natural 
resources sector for the next generation. But attention to this and to the broader development agenda will 
be tested by a potentially disruptive political cycle, with the Frelimo Party convention and municipal and 
presidential elections taking place over the next three years. In sum, the medium-term outlook is fraught 
with both unmatched opportunities and persistent downside risks.                      

A. Political Context 

2. Mozambique, a southeast African country of 22.9 million people, occupies an area of 800,000 
square kilometers.  About 70 percent of the population live and work in rural areas .  The country has 
more than 2,500 kilometers of coastline along the southwestern rim of the Indian Ocean.  It is endowed 
with ample arable land, water, energy, and gas and mineral resources; three deep seaports; and a relatively 
large potential labor pool.  It is also strategically located, bordering six countries — four of them 
landlocked and hence dependent on Mozambique as a conduit to global markets.  In addition, the 
country’s strong ties to the regional economic engine of South Africa underscore the importance of 
Mozambique’s economic, political, and social development to the stability and growth of the region.  

3. 
Following independence from Portugal in June 1975, the country underwent a protracted 15-
year armed conflict, fueled largely by regional powers and Cold War politics , leaving the country 
and its economy in ruins.  Mozambique began a slow but successful transition to peace, political 
stability, and democracy in the late-1980s and two years after the formal peace agreement in October 
1992, the country held its first democratic elections.  The Front for the Liberation of Mozambique 
(Frelimo) edged out its civil war rival, the Mozambican National Resistance (Renamo).  Frelimo has 
remained in power ever since, most recently winning the fourth presidential and parliamentary elections 
in 2009 by 70 percent of the popular vote (an increase from the 60 percent garnered in the 2004 
elections).  Frelimo has a two-thirds majority in the national parliament, 80 percent of the seats in the 
provincial assemblies, and majorities in all elected municipal assemblies.  Such control over the elected

and politically appointed state positions is unparalleled in the country's recent history .  Political analysts 
predict it could undermine the Government's ability to respond to the needs of its citizens.   

4. 
Looking ahead, the next three years will be marked by several political milestones that could 
distract from the country’s development agenda.  The political jockeying ahead of Frelimo’s party 
convention in 2012 has been accompanied by discussion over the future ideological tilt of the party, given 
the emergence of a new generation of leaders with no connection to the struggle for independence and 
little allegiance to the Socialist ideals of the party’s founders.  There is also some talk about a possible 
constitutional amendment to extend presidential term limits which may cause dissention within the party.  
The 2013 municipal elections will also be highly anticipated and will determine whether the Democratic 
Movement of Mozambique (MDM), an off-shoot of Renamo, can build on its control of two of the largest 
municipalities (Beira and Quelimane) and emerge as a serious force in Mozambican politics.  Both 
Renamo and MDM’s power base lies in the central provinces of Sofala, Manica, and Zambezia – often 
referred to as ―Mozambique’s breadbasket‖.     

B. Recent Economic Developments and Prospects 

5. 
 For the past two decades since the end of the civil war, Mozambique recorded a sustained 
and impressive rate of growth. Average real GDP growth rate soared from zero percent during the 
1981-92 period to 8 percent between 1993 and 2010; and real GDP per capita almost doubled after 1992, 
making Mozambique one of the best performing countries over the past two decades among African oil 
importers (Figure 1). While growth in the immediate aftermath of the peace accords was driven by a 
return to political and macroeconomic stability, a first wave of structural reforms , and a post-conflict 
―catch-up effect‖ in infrastructure and agriculture, more recent growth (since 1998) has been driven by 
policies to entice foreign investments, particularly in isolated mega-projects in mining and energy 
production, and strong donor support. Foreign direct investment totaled US$890 million in 2009 and 
increased to US$1 billion in 2010.  These flows support the growing perception of Mozambique as a 
market-oriented economy with strong prospects for structural transformation and high growth. 

Figure 1. Mozambique Growth Record 1993-2012 

6. 
Economic growth has remained 
relatively strong albeit with some slow 
down during the global food, fuel, and 
financial crises and consequent global 
economic slowdown since 2008. While the 
country’s real GDP growth rate fell slightly 
to 6.3 percent in 2009, it rose to 6.8 percent 
in 2010 and is estimated to have increased to 
7.2 percent in 2011. The country’s economic 
growth has remained one of the strongest in 
the region, outpacing not only the Sub-
Saharan average but also that of the other 
economies‖.2

including measures to rationalize expenditures for non-priority sectors, and monetary policy aimed at 
limiting the impact of the higher public debt on credit to the private sector. With economic growth now 
back on a sound footing, the Government has started tightening macroeconomic policies, reverting from 
the expansionary stance adopted during the global economic crisis to address the double-digit inflation 
that Mozambique had in 2010.  Inflation in 2011 fell to 5.5 percent.  

7. Mozambique's rapid economic growth has not translated into significant poverty reduction in 
recent years.  Growth was accompanied by significant strides in reducing poverty up to 2003 . Household 
survey data indicate that the national poverty headcount fell from roughly 69 to 54 percent from 1996 to 
2003.  The results of the 2008-09 household survey suggest the response of poverty reduction to 
economic growth has since weakened.  The geographical distribution of poverty, however, continues to 
be concentrated in the rural areas, and in the center and northern part of the country. 

8. 
The medium-term outlook for Mozambique remains positive.  Increased public investments, 
particularly in infrastructure, as well as foreign investments in new mega-projects in the energy sector and 
extractive industries are expected to drive economic growth to 8 percent over the medium term, putting 
the country back on its pre-global crisis trajectory (Table 1).  Investment spending is already at about 15 
percent of GDP in 2011 and an expansion is necessary given the country’s low physical capital stock.  
Given low private investment rates, the Government may need non-concessional external resources.  
Emphasis should be placed on the quality of projects so as to ensure an adequate growth dividend and 
ability to repay additional borrowing.  Such efforts would need to be embedded in a continued pursuit of 
macroeconomic stability.  

9. 
The World Bank and the IMF have recently upgraded Mozambique as a Higher Capacity 
Country in terms of its non-concessional borrowing capacity.  This is a result of improvements in sub-
Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (sub-CPIA) and Public Expenditure and Financial 
Accountability (PEFA) scores, as well as the significant progress achieved in terms of debt management, 
including the formulation of medium term debt strategies and the preparation of annual debt sustainability 
analyses.  Higher borrowing capacity should serve Mozambique well as it looks to increase public 
investment in infrastructure over the medium-term.  Aid flows, including direct budget support, have 
remained strong but have been falling from their peak in 2009, as a percent of a fast growing GDP, and 
are estimated to level off in 2012.  

10. Recent discoveries of coal and gas resources indicate that over the medium-term 
Mozambique's development could receive a very significant boost.  Mozambique has the potential to 
join the ranks of resource rich economies especially if the exploitation of natural gas resources 
materializes.  This could be transformative, providing government with significant resources and altering 
the geographic distribution of development which is now heavily centered in the southern part of the 
country.  Government's attention to EITI, public financial management, and the continued strengthening 
of tax administration is a good basis, but will need to be complemented with stronger attention to polices 
to support economic diversification and strengthening government's ability to deliver services.  

11. Despite an overall positive economic outlook, the Mozambican economy faces substantial 
downside risks, particularly with regards to a slowdown in international economic growth.  The 
increased risks posed by the deteriorating global environment and the negative impacts it would bring to 
the country – as prices of commodities decline resulting in lower export revenues, foreign investment 

5 

 
retracts, and economic activity slows down – will also result in lower tax revenues.  The main 
transmission channels of a significant downturn in the global economy (and especially from a recession in 
Europe) would result in lower commodity prices and its effects on growth through lower foreign direct 
investment to resource-rich Mozambique. In addition, the important trade links to South Africa (including 
aluminum exports and imports of consumer goods) could have a wider effect through the bilateral 
exchange rate. 

     Table 1. Mozambique – Key Macroeconomic Indicators, 2008-2013 

1/ 2011 data refers to average from January to October.     
Source: Estimates and projections from Government of Mozambique, IMF, and World Bank. 

12. Under an alternative global growth scenario, assuming the downside risk of a global 
slowdown, Mozambique's growth is projected to decelerate with growing fiscal and external 
imbalances.  Assuming a decline in GDP in developed countries of about 1 percent and almost stagnant 
overall global growth, real GDP growth in Mozambique is projected to fall by 1.8 percentage points in 
2012 and by 1.6 percent in 2013 (compared to the baseline scenario).  Also, under this alternative 
scenario, the global downturn is projected to add pressure to the fiscal accounts as fiscal revenues fall 
faster than spending and the external current account deficit to widen slightly as lower external demand 
and falling commodity prices are expected to affect exports.  Mozambique also remains vulnerable to 
changing global food and fuel prices, given the moderate fiscal capacity to moderate its impact on 
domestic prices. 

C. Millennium Development Goals and Poverty 

13. As the country moves closer to 2015, Government and stakeholders are looking to make a 
final push to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).  The country can potentially 
achieve 13 of the 21 MDG targets by 2015 (Table 2).  Those within reach relate to poverty, under-five 
mortality, maternal mortality, and the establishment of an open trading and financial system. Improved 
public financial management (PFM) and massive investment in priority areas have helped to improve 
service delivery in education, health, transport, and infrastructure, resulting in progress across a range of 
non-monetary poverty indicators. Enrolment and attendance rates over the past decade have increased

significantly; 81 percent of primary school-age children (6-12 years) attend school, with only a two 
percentage-point difference between boys slightly outnumbering girls. Overall, the achievement 
represents one of the most significant improvements in gender equality in the country over the past 
decade. Net enrolment in all grades of EP1 (escola primária do primeiro grau, level 1 up to grade 5) 
increased from 45 to 77 percent during 1998-2008, and the completion rate increased from 39 percent in 
2003 to 73 percent in 2010.

14. Progress has been made from a low base in the health sector, but many challenges remain , 
including inequality in access and health outcomes, and require sustained commitment. The under-
five mortality rate decreased from 178 to 138 per 1,000 live births between 2000 and 2008 due to 

7 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
improved vaccination rates and service coverage. Maternal mortality has decreased from an estimated 
1,000 to 340 per 100,000 between the early 1990s and 2007. Despite these significant improvements, 
Mozambique fares less well than the Sub-Saharan Africa average.  HIV appears to have stabilized at a 
prevalence rate of 11.5 percent among 15-49 year olds, still among the highest prevalence rates in the 
world, and adolescent girls are 3 times more likely than adolescent boys to be infected by HIV.  Married 
women have limited ability to negotiate safe sexual practices (such as condom use) and are at greatest risk 
of contracting HIV.  The Bank estimates that the high prevalence rate may reduce Mozambique’s 
economic growth by as much as one percentage point annually. And the Food and Agriculture 
Organization estimates that Mozambique may lose more than 20 percent of its agricultural labor force by 
2020 because of the epidemic.   Coverage of malaria prevention methods, such as insecticide-treated nets, 
has also improved. Nonetheless, malaria continues to pose a major public health problem, accounting for 
a large proportion of deaths among children under-five. It is also a contributing factor to at least 30 
percent of maternal deaths. All regions of the country remain at high risk of transmission, requiring 
coverage to be further improved and sustained over the long-term. 3  

15. Chronic malnutrition is extremely high. In Mozambique, approximately 47 percent of children 
under five suffer from chronic under-nutrition (or stunting), a rate that has remained virtually unchanged 
since 2003 and is considered "very high" by World Health Organization standards. Chronic under -
nutrition accounts for at least one-third of child deaths. Stunting affects individual children but is also 
closely linked to overall development of a country as stunting affects cognitive development and is 
related to timely school enrolment and future educational outcomes. This high burden of under-nutrition 
stems from soaring levels of poverty, food insecurity, poor child-feeding practices, and inadequate 
prevention and management of acute illnesses. 

16. The Mozambique health system is weak in general, with particular challenges in human 
resources, healthcare financing and supply chain management.  Mozambique has the fifth lowest 
ratio of health workers to population (0.03 doctors, and 0.21 nurses per 1 ,000 inhabitants). There are 26 
donors in the health sector, making predictability and coordination difficult. Government allocation to 
health spending has recently decreased, and public financial management needs to improve. Poor 
management of the supply chain has resulted in expired drugs in central warehouses at the same time as 
drug stock-outs at health facilities. Challenges outside of the health system also have a heavy impact on 
health status. While 77 percent of people in urban areas had access to improved drinking water sources in 
2008, this fell to 29 percent for rural populations (48 percent overall). Among rural households, only six 
percent have access to safe sanitation compared to 47 percent of urban households.  

17. Significant challenges in education remain.  Progress in school enrolment masks challenges in 
the quality of education, with 44 percent of children in primary schools being over -age and only 1 in 5 
children of secondary school age actually attending secondary school . Gender parity has been achieved in 
school enrolment, but there are more out-of-school girls than boys. Especially significant, gender gaps 
remain in the higher grades of primary education (EP2 , escola primária do segundo grau, grades 6 to 7) and 
secondary education. This is particularly pronounced in the Northern provinces where low literacy rates 
persist for women of ages 15-24. Adult literacy rate for women is only 41 percent compared to 70 percent

for men.4  For women, this is far below average rates of neighboring countries. Key issues that influence 
girls’ retention in the education system — beside the wealth of their family — are premature marriages, 
dominance of male teachers and inherent fear of sexual harassment, and distance to water supply systems.

18. Despite 
significant progress, 
the 
provision of water remains a major 
challenge in Mozambique. Although the 
share of people with access to safe drinking 
water 
in 
urban 
areas 
has 
increased 
significantly and achieving the MDG target 
for sustainable coverage is expected for urban 
water supply (reaching 70 percent), overall 
access remains low. The 47 percent with 
access to water is below the average of 58 
percent across the African continent. This is 
mainly because coverage in rural areas, which 
accounts for 73 percent of the total population, 
is low at 30 percent compared to the African 
average of 46.5 percent. Among 
rural 
households, only 6 percent have access to safe 
sanitation compared to 47 percent of urban households.

Nacional de Estatística, 2010)  

19. 
 The uneven progress on the MDGs mirrors the challenges in sustaining broad-based poverty 
reduction.  Mozambique's rapid economic growth was accompanied by significant strides in poverty 
reduction in the decade following the civil war. Poverty rates fell from 69 percent in 1996-97 to 54 
percent in 2002-03 — equivalent to nearly three million people (or 13 percent of the country’s 
population) lifted out of poverty.  Despite this success, Mozambique needs to further decrease the poverty 
rate by 15 percentage points to achieve the MDG target of 40 percent of the population below the poverty 
line by 2015.  Mozambique remains one of the poorest countries in the world, ranking 184 out of 187 
countries in the 2011 Human Development Index.5  It ranks 197 out of 210 countries in GDP per capita 
(US$441 in 2010, compared to the US$510 average for low-income countries).6  Moreover, the results of 
the 2008-09 household survey, while subject to some methodological caveats, suggest overall poverty 
reduction has remained at roughly 54 percent of the population, with rural poverty actually increasing 
slightly to 57 percent since the 2002-03 survey.7  While the food and fuel crisis of 2008-09 played a role 
in this outcome, the poverty trend suggests that growth has become less inclusive in recent years.

Box 1. Mozambican Development from a Gender Perspective 

Since Independence, Government policies have emphasized gender equality and women’s empowerment and 
some have contributed to important development results. They include drastically improved gender gaps in 
schooling and significant reductions in infant and under-five child mortality. There has also been a notable 
increase in women’s political representation (ranked 61 out of 116 countries under the Gender Empowerment 
Measure). However, women continue to live and work at a disadvantage under a strong patriarchal culture that 
hinders their optimal benefit from and contribution to economic and social development achievements. Compared 
with men, women still have heavier workload responsibilities, inferior employment and lower income, inferior 
access to land and lower agricultural production, and lower levels of education and health. Gender-based violence 
continues to be a fundamental obstacle to the achievement of gender equality; and while one of Africa’s best 
performing economies, Mozambique has experienced a ―feminization‖ of poverty and the agricultural sector.  

An important aspect of the ―feminization‖ of poverty is that women stay in the agricultural, informal sector and 
low paid occupations while men are moving to pursue higher earnings in other sectors.  Trends between 1997 and 
2003 show that men moved out of agriculture and into the private sector and self-employment in non-agricultural 
sectors to a higher degree than women.a  Women are also less likely than men to grow tradable crops because they 
concentrate on basic foods to feed their familyb and women experience lower technology adoption rates than 
men.c This gender gap not only has important implication on equity, social cohesion and individual welfare, it 
also creates important economic inefficiencies. Strategies are needed to specifically help women diversify  crops 
and raise output to a commercial scale without risking household food security, for example through extension 
services targeting women. Another finding shows that women with education do move into commercial 
agriculture, underlining the multiple advantages of enhancing access to education among rural women.d

20. The 2011 Gender Inequality Index8 ranks Mozambique 125 out of 146 countries, revealing 
that Mozambique remains poor in overall as well as in gender equality terms. 9  Gender of the 
household head is a major determinant of poverty in Mozambique.  According to the Social and Gender 
Assessment and using data from the 2002-03 household survey, it has been observed that households with 
low consumption levels tend to be larger, have a higher proportion of children, and live in rural areas; and 
their head of households work in the agriculture sector and have a lower education level. Households 
headed by females tend to be poorer than those headed by males.10 Of families headed by women, 57.8 
percent fall below the poverty line, compared to 53.9 percent of those headed by men.  Yet, as seen in 
Figure 2, one of the most significant outcomes of the 2008-09 household survey relates to gender: female-
headed households are experiencing a more consistent drop in poverty rate than male-headed households, 

8 UNDP’s Gender Inequality Index (GII) reflects women’s disadvantage in three dimensions—reproductive health, 
empowerment and the labour market. The health dimension is measured by two indicators: maternal mortality 
ratio and the adolescent fertility rate. The empowerment dimension is also measured by two indicators: the share 
of parliamentary seats held by each sex and by secondary and higher education attainment levels. The labour 
dimension is measured by women’s participation in the work force.

particularly in urban areas.11  Key gender analyses conclude that there is a ―feminization of poverty‖ in 
Mozambique.12  The overall proportion of female-headed households is at 26.4 percent, but it ranges 
between 54 percent in the southern province of Gaza to 21 percent in the two most populous northern 
provinces of Nampula and Zambézia.13  

21. Growth in Mozambique has not been as pro-poor as in other high-growth countries and it 
has become less pro-poor over time. When compared to peer countries, GDP growth has had less of an 
effect in reducing the headline poverty rate.14  Despite a healthy pace of growth, the current elasticity of 
poverty reduction with respect to mean income (about 1.5) will lead to only very slow poverty reduction 
over the next decade.  In a country with no social safety nets and where half of the population is under 20 
years old (Figure 3), 80 percent of the labor force in informal or subsistence, low-productivity activities, 
that baseline scenario would be a recipe for sociopolitical tensions.  The September 2010 riots, following 
the Government’s announced price increases for bread, water, and electricity, underlined the extreme 
vulnerability of the country’s population.  The aftermath of the riots have also prompted the Government 
and the donor community alike to place greater emphasis in developing rural areas where about 60 
percent of the population lives, and to promote labor-intensive growth, particularly in the agriculture 
sector which employs 78 percent of the workforce and is an obvious engine for sustained and 
transformative growth and poverty reduction. At the same time, the Government is mindful of the high 
and growing risks associated with urban unemployment and poverty — driven by rural migration and 
high population growth — and the potential for social unrest.

22. With population growth relatively fast at 2.8 percent in 2008, the government faces the 
challenge of creating employment opportunities for its fast growing and young labor force.  Using

15 to 59 as the working age, the labor force in Mozambique will increase by almost 50 percent during the 
22 years from now to 2025, from about 8 million in 2010 to about 11.6 million in 2025. While 
Mozambique’s employment to population ratio currently stands at 78 percent, job creation in the non-
agricultural modern wage sector has not kept up with labor force growth.  Moreover, the country’s human 
capital base is quite thin: more than 90 percent of the labor force has either no formal education or only 5 
years of formal education. 

D. Development Challenges and Opportunities 

23. Slow poverty reduction in the face of robust economic growth is the defining development 
challenge in today’s Mozambique.   

Promoting Inclusive Growth to Enhance Job Creation 

24. Recent poverty outcomes can be attributed in part to low growth in agricultural productivity 
(especially food crops), weather shocks affecting the 2008 harvests, and increase in international 
food and fuel prices.  However, more broadly, slow poverty reduction reflects the structural deficiencies 
and the narrow productive base of the economy, the inadequacy of the Government’s growth strategy, and 
the breadth of the investment climate reform agenda left to be addressed. For some time there has been 
broad agreement that the drivers of growth in the recent past — the post-conflict catch-up effect and 
overseas development assistance — were bound to fade over time; and long-run productivity growth 
needs to replace them. However, growth in the past decade has been concentrated at one end of the 
productive spectrum: foreign-owned, capital-intensive, and export-oriented mega-projects. Mega-projects 
have contributed significantly to Mozambique’s economic growth and have put the country on the map as 
an attractive destination for international investors, but they have had limited impact on employment 
creation and productivity spillovers. While representing 62 percent of the production value of the 
manufacturing sector, mega-projects only employ 3 percent of the sector’s labor force and 2 percent of 
urban private sector employment.15  Mega-projects dominate Mozambique’s exports, about half of which 
derive from the aluminum smelting mega-project, making the economy highly dependent on world 
commodity prices. There are only 14 other products registering exports in excess of US$1 million.16  
Also, mega-projects have had limited fiscal benefits — a legacy of the Government’s tax incentives to 
lure foreign investors.    

25. 
Inclusive growth calls for better integration of mega-projects into the overall socio-economic 
development strategy, but Mozambique must also develop broader and more diverse sources of 
growth.  The country has a vast potential for diversification.  Box 2 assesses options for diversifying 
sources of growth. Beyond mining and energy, the untapped development of agribusiness, fisheries, 
forestry, tourism, trade and logistics, light manufacturing and services holds significant potential in terms 
of growth but also job creation and livelihoods. In order to encourage a structural transformation of the 
economy and a more competitive and diversified productive and export base to emerge, the Government 
of Mozambique needs to accelerate reforms to improve both the overall investment climate and to

Private Sector, World Bank, 2009).

untangle sector-specific bottlenecks in potential growth areas. At the same time, Mozambique needs to 
maintain its strong track record of macroeconomic stability , particularly in the face of continued global 
economic uncertainty; boost public investment in infrastructure as a way to crowd in private sector 
activity and improve the quality of life and productivity of its citizens; and enhance the competitiveness 
of the local workforce through improved education and skills development . More than 90 percent of the 
labor force has either no formal education or only five years of formal education. 

Box 2.  Growth Identification and Facilitation in Mozambique  

The key questions for the country’s economic agenda are whether high growth rates can be sustained and even 
increased to levels that would ensure prosperity for Mozambicans, and what strategic policy choices and tradeoffs 
are needed in order to get there. Among the many challenges facing the country, lifting the 80 percent of the 
population currently in low-productivity or subsistence activities into industries that conform to the country’s 
comparative advantage is probably the most important one. 

At the request of the Mozambican authorities, a World Bank team is currently preparing jointly with the 
Government a Policy note on the appropriate way of identifying new sources of growth, and some specifics on the 
facilitation role that the state should play.  The work will feed into a high level ―Jobs Summit‖ to mobilize global 
experience on job creation through growth facilitation.   

Preliminary results of the analysis suggest that Mozambique has several options at its disposal: 

Option A: Fostering current policies to exploit the country's large energy, and gas and mineral resources. The 
risk, however, is price volatility.  Heavy reliance on aluminum, for example, which accounts for about one-
third of exports, subjects the economy to the sharp declines in aluminum prices that the country experienced 
during the 2008-10 global economic crisis. 

Option B: Strengthening the emerging agri-business sector, which is already attracting strong interest and high 
levels of foreign investment, often from countries such as Brazil where there is deep knowledge and expertise. 
Mozambique is endowed with ample arable land and water and could certainly establish itself as a powerhouse 
in agri-business industries. This option could transform the rural economy, where over 2/3 of Mozambique's 
poor households live, owing to linkages and spillovers to the traditional farming sector. 

Option C: Developing light manufacturing industries-and trying to seize some of the 85 million low-skilled 
manufacturing jobs that China will have to graduate from in the next decade due to its fast-rising wages. 
Mozambique has a relatively large potential labor pool and manufacturing provides more long-term economic 
benefits than other activities. It generates economies of scale, sparks industrial and technological upgrading, 
fosters innovation, and is characterized by big multiplier effects. This option would reduce urban poverty and 
have spillovers to rural areas as well through informal transfers.  

Option D: Positioning itself as a regional hub. Mozambique is also strategically located, bordering six 
countries - four of them landlocked and hence dependent on Mozambique as a conduit to global markets.  In 
addition, it has three deep seaports, more than 2,500 kilometers of coastline along the southwestern rim of the 
Indian Ocean, and strong ties to the regional economic engine of South Africa. 

Option E: Developing tourism to make it one of the main sources of foreign exchange and growth. The 
potential is virtually unlimited. If combined with programs to develop the required skills in the labor force, this 
option could lead to substantial employment gains, but would not reach the majority of the labor force. It 
would work best in combination with others. 

For each one of these options, two main obstacles will have to be overcome: high factor costs (often due to poorly-
conceived regulations and rigidities in land policy) and high transaction costs (often due to insufficient 
infrastructure and poor governance).  By facilitating the clustering of competitive private firms in some geographic 
locations with excellent logistics (without using the distortionary instruments of old industrial policies such as 
tariffs or other forms of heavy protection), the government could foster the backward and forward linkages that 
will bring capital and knowledge to the Mozambican economy.   

13 

 
26. 
 The magnitude and complexity of the reform agenda requires stronger development 
planning, management, and oversight. The Government has already begun a series of measures and 
reforms, such as tightening the fiscal regime for large investments and mega-projects to ensure mineral 
revenues are at comparable levels to other resource-rich countries and to bring them more in line with 
current international good practice. Higher mineral revenues would, in turn, support the stepped up 
infrastructure and education investments needed to improve competitiveness over the medium to long 
term, as well as institute effective social protection programs.17  

Box 3. Opportunities and Perils of Mozambique’s Burgeoning Extractive Industry 

Mozambique is at the cusp of becoming a world-class destination for mining and gas.  For the latter, the next 
two years will be a critical window to put in place policies and investments that will shape the sector for the next 
30 to 40 years.  Exploration in the Rovuma basin in 2010-11 first confirmed the presence of natural gas volumes 
in excess of 30 Tcf (comparable to Oman), and more recent announcements by investors increased that potential 
estimate to between 80 and 100 Tcf (comparable to Norway).a  Mozambique already plays an important role in 
the world’s production of aluminum and beryllium. Its massive coal reserves could eventually place 
Mozambique at par with the largest coal exporters in the world.     

The extractive industries sector currently accounts for about 5 percent of the country’s GDP, primarily from gas, 
with a limited share from mining. However, the country has only just begun to tap into its huge potential. 
Expectations are that in 5 to 10 years, coal and natural gas projects alone could double the sector’s contribution 
to GDP. With over 1,000 active prospecting and exploration licenses, the mining and oil and gas sectors have 
the potential to contribute additionally up to 10 percent of GDP (based on global comparators) . Large-scale 
mining and petroleum operations provide a unique opportunity unlike other industry sectors to bring in private 
financing for development of regional infrastructure to facilitate local value addition and business development 
that could serve as ―anchors‖ for growth corridors development. 

One key challenge facing the country for harnessing its natural resource opportunities is to design the right 
strategic policies in a context that supports a sound sector governance, legal, and regulatory regime; linkages to 
the broader economy; and fiscal prudence. Another challenge is to minimize macroeconomic distortions and the 
negative impacts (―the resource curse‖) seen in other resource-rich countries. These include a decline in the 
competitiveness of other economic sectors (due to real exchange rate appreciation), volatility of revenues from 
the natural resource sector due to global commodity market swings, government mismanagement of resources, 
and weak or corrupt institutions. To avoid the latter, the Government of Mozambique made a commitment to 
increase transparency and accountability in the management of extractive industries. On May 15, 2009, 
Mozambique became an Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) Candidate Country. The country is 
undergoing EITI validation, which assesses compliance with EITI principles and standards. As of 2011, 
Mozambique has largely passed the first stage of reforms by establishing a sound legal and regulatory regime 
and generating modern, high-quality geodata. The second-generation reforms that Mozambique is facing can 
produce the highest results in terms of revenues to the country by ensuring that exploration turns into mines, that 
mines produce in accordance with the plans, and that mines pay their dues in accordance with the laws and 
regulations. Technical assistance for the extractive industries and specific support for a ―master plan‖ for the gas 
sector are also planned under the CPS.

27. The Government is also looking to improve the impact of mega-projects on employment and 
revenues, as well as greater linkages with local enterprises. More generally, the Government is keen to 
improve land use, strengthen mining law and regulations, manage offshore gas development, revise the 
Public-Private Partnership Law, and improve public financial management to deliver effective services 
that facilitate growth. In this regard, the Government is looking at spatial development planning to 
improve efforts to set the proper enabling conditions for private sector investment and public-private-
community partnerships in developing or underdeveloped regions or ―corridors‖ that demonstrate 
potential for growth.  While limited capacity to undertake such level of development will continue to be a 
concern, the potential for better planned, integrated, and managed development that spurs inclusive 
growth shows considerable promise. Box 3 discusses the potential for development of Mozambique’s 
extractive industry.  

Investment Climate 

28. Despite efforts to improve the investment climate, Mozambique still ranks low on 
international indicators of economic competitiveness and business environment . In the 2012 Doing 
Business Index, for example, Mozambique ranked 139 out of 183 countries. This is despite recent reforms 
related to business licensing and registration for smaller business.18  New business owners in 
Mozambique still have to go through an extensive bureaucratic process to formally register their business. 
It also remains particularly costly and/or burdensome to deal with construction permits, employ workers, 
register property, trade across borders, and enforce contracts. Similarly, in the World Economic Forum’s 
Global Competitiveness Report 2010-2011, Mozambique ranked 131 out of 139 countries in terms of 
economic competitiveness.19  Poor access to finance, the perceived prevalence of corruption, inefficient 
government bureaucracy, inadequate infrastructure, and the education level of the workforce were 
regarded as particularly challenging. The World Bank Investment Climate Assessment released in 2009 
also found that the top private sector constraints in Mozambique were shown to be access to finance, 
practices of the informal sector, inadequate electricity supply; high tax rates; and crime, theft, and 
disorder.20 The shortage of technical skills is a particular constraint to local economic development, and 
other concerns may be even more acute in the provinces outside the capital . Despite some modest reforms 
in the trade area, Mozambique’s ranking in the 2010 Global Logistics Performance Index is 136 out of 
155 countries surveyed.21 This contrasts sharply with South Africa, which is ranked 28 in the same 
survey. Trade facilitation reforms would also go a long way for Mozambique to play its natural role as the 
gateway for trade for the Southern Africa region.  

29. The weak business environment has a particularly negative impact on small and medium-size 
enterprises (SMEs). About 90 percent of all private businesses in Mozambique are small to medium-size 
enterprises. Over-regulation, administrative procedures, and rigid labor laws discourage most of these 
firms from formal registration, putting them in a very tenuous position. Most employ less than 10

employees, sell mostly to the local market, operate with very low profit margins, face severe resource 
constraints, offer few opportunities for savings and investment to escape poverty, and contribute modestly 
to exports and economic growth.  Supporting small and medium-size enterprises would necessarily have 
to focus on improving access to finance, which is often the principal constraint most often cited by 
entrepreneurs. Factors accounting for lack of progress in increasing financial access include economy-
wide structural impediments to financial intermediation that limit the number of creditworthy clients 
and/or increase the costs and risks of offering financial services. There is also a lack of competition in the 
banking sector, high overhead costs and interest spreads, and high and nontransparent bank commissions 
and fees. Other factors are the informal nature of the private sector and limited management, financial, 
and technical skills at smaller firms. Small and medium-size enterprises also suffer from lack of business 
advisory services. The local business services market is characterized by large firms supplying high- 
quality and expensive accounting, auditing, information technology, and legal services to large 
enterprises, with limited affordable services available to small and medium-size enterprises. Catalytic 
interventions can help stimulate the demand and supply of business advisory services. Addressing the 
skills deficit in the workforce requires investments in technical and vocational training so that graduates 
have marketable skills. Small and medium-size enterprises would also benefit by greater linkages with 
mega-projects and more streamlined registration procedures that would help businesses graduate from the 
informal to the formal sector.  

Diversifying Sources of Growth 

30. Agriculture is arguably the most critical sector relative to a more inclusive growth strategy in 
Mozambique. It is the country’s second largest sector in the economy, contributing 24 percent of GDP 
and employing 78 percent of the workforce. While annual growth in the agricultural sector has averaged 
about 7 percent since 2003 and has been an important contributor to overall economic growth, it has 
mainly been driven by the expansion in labor and land that followed post-conflict resettlement of refugees 
in rural areas. Although new investments have taken place in specific subsectors, largely in response to 
existing domestic and export market opportunities, the sector remains relatively unproductive and consists 
largely of subsistence farming in which 85 percent of rural households are engaged. The average size of 
cultivated land per household is less than 1.5 hectares.22 And their traditional inputs — using outdated 
seeds, plants, tools, and techniques — result in low yields relative to neighboring countries with similar 
agro-ecological potential. Low adoption rates of productivity-enhancing agricultural technologies, 
coupled with an inadequate provision of agricultural services; limited access to rural finance; and a land 
law inefficiently enforced are major constraints to transforming subsistence smallholders into market-led 
agricultural entrepreneurs. And despite recent investments in roads, the density of the road network is the 
lowest in southern Africa, and linking investments in rural roads to agricultural production areas still 
remains a challenge. Other key infrastructure such as power, telecommunications, and irrigation are also 
underdeveloped. Total irrigated area is only about three percent of its potential. Moreover, the rural 
population suffers from high rates of malnutrition, HIV/AIDS, and malaria , which reduce productivity. 
Smallholders, particularly in the Zambezi Valley, are also highly vulnerable to extreme climactic

conditions that alternate between frequent droughts and floods. The increase in rural poverty reported in 
the 2008-09 household survey23 is largely attributable to such weather events.  

31. More women (83 percent) participate in the active labor force than men (72 percent).24  Eight-
nine percent of women are occupied in the agriculture sector while only 5.5 percent work in commerce 
and 3.3 percent in the service sector.25 Men’s occupational pattern varies more with 68 percent in the 
agricultural sector, 10 percent in commerce, 8 percent in services and 6 percent in government. Women 
are staying in the agricultural, informal sector, and low-paid occupations while men are moving to pursue 
higher earnings in other sectors. Improving the productivity of women in agriculture would boost 
economic growth and reduce poverty. However, a country study finds that women are less likely than 
men to grow tradable crops because they concentrate on basic foods to feed their family ; yet the study 
also finds that women with education do move into commercial agriculture.26 This accentuates the 
multiple advantages of enhancing the level of education among women in rural areas. Furthermore, 
women in rural communities experience lower technology adoption rates than men.27 This gender gap 
does not only have important implications for equity, social cohesion , and individual welfare, it also 
creates important economic inefficiencies. The latest poverty and gender assessment concludes that 
strategies are needed to specifically help women diversify crops and raise output to a commercial scale 
without risking household food security, for example through extension services targeting women . 

32. The constraints faced by smallholders also deter agribusiness investment to a large extent. 
Agribusiness successes over the past 20 years remain limited. The product mix has barely changed since 
colonial times; technological change has been slight; and few investments in agribusiness have taken 
place with the exceptions of sugar plantations and cashew, maize, and tobacco processing. Growth in 
agribusinesses is also constrained by procedures for accessing suitable land and water rights, high cost of 
expanding infrastructure, inadequate logistics and complex bureaucratic procedures for effective supply-
chain management, and minimum wage for labor that often exceeds labor productivity. These constraints 
could be overcome through a series of reforms, prioritized investment programs, and public -private 
partnerships in creating the necessary support institutions and access to financial resources. In addition, 
Mozambique offers agribusiness investors with tremendous natural assets: extensive undeveloped and 
fertile farmland, abundance of water for irrigation, and diverse agro-ecological environments suitable for 
growing a variety of products.28      

33. Beyond agriculture, the Government has identified the fisheries sector as an important 
contributor to growth and poverty alleviation. The sector contributes to food security, balance of 
payment, public revenues, employment, and gender equity. Fisheries are the foundation of economic 
growth in many rural and urban areas and often the resource of last resort for poor, marginalized , and 
isolated communities. About 850,000 households get income from fisheries, and fishing is the primary

source of income for about 330,000 people. The number of artisanal fishers involved in marine fisheries 
doubled from 2002 to 2007. Women make up almost half the labor force, mos tly engaged in post-harvest 
processing and marketing and shellfish cleaning. Nevertheless, the sector’s economic performance has 
fallen below its former position as a leading contributor to the national economy and foreign exchange . 
Weak terms of trade and economic inefficiencies have undermined this contribution: up to three-quarters 
of the economic rent escaped from Mozambique through transfer pricing (estimated at US$16 million per 
year for a US$20 million per year rent). At the same time, rent could have been almost doubled (US$35 
million per year) under appropriate management of the exploitation. In addition , better domiciling of the 
activities, including upstream and downstream value chain, could improve the sector’s direct and indirect 
contribution to the GDP. Reforms can reverse the observed downward trend, and new sector policy 
instruments should be designed to improve integration of the activities in the national economy. New 
principles and practices of allocation of fishing rights, an improved taxa tion regime, and spatial planning 
would also support the distribution of benefits among the economic agents and the regions. 

34. Given Mozambique’s varied and relatively pristine environment and mild year-round 
climate, together with its rich cultural heritage and proximity to South Africa, the tourism sector is 
often seen as an excellent prospect for development. However, the sector has not performed to its 
potential, and investments have been slow to mature. Only 18 percent of approved tourism investments 
between 2005 and 2007 have actually materialized. As shown by experience elsewhere, tourism growth 
depends on two major factors: the overall investment climate and the quality and accessibility of the 
tourism product. In Mozambique, tourism is hobbled by complex land acquisition process; inadequate 
transport infrastructure, particularly air transport to coastal areas; and high cost of sourcing consumer 
goods from South Africa. The Government of Mozambique nonetheless has set a target of attracting 4 
million tourists over the next few years, compared to about 1 million in 2006 . Arrivals are projected to 
increase at 7.8 percent annually over the next few years, reaching 30.5 million by 2020. Tourism is 
already the third largest investment sector in the country . Conservation areas and targeted coastal districts 
have particularly high prospects because nature-based and sustainable coastal tourism are expected to be 
the largest growth area in the coming decades: 60 percent of South Africa’s 6 million tourists, for 
example, now visit protected areas each year, producing revenues of US$2.5 billion. Tourism’s linkages 
to transport, agriculture, food and beverage, retail, financial services, and construction sectors offer 
compelling job creation and economic growth opportunities.  

Infrastructure 

35. There has been substantial improvement in the provision of public goods that could facilitate 
sustained and inclusive growth. This is particularly the case in transport infrastructure, electricity, urban 
and rural water, and telecommunications. Mozambique’s infrastructure is beginning to approach the level 
of its neighbors; entrepreneurs are less worried about energy provision, for example, than they were in 
2003.29  Overall improvements however mask significant urban-rural disparities; and compared to middle-
income economies such as South Africa, inadequate infrastructure in Mozambique continues to represent 
a significant obstacle to improved living standards and economic productivity.

Box 4.  Regional Integration and the Potential of Mozambican Infrastructure 

The two leading Regional Integration Arrangements (RIA) in Southern Africa – the Common Market for Eastern and Southern 
Africa (COMESA) and the Southern African Economic Community (SADC) – are making good progress toward an envisioned 
African Common Market. The recently-established Customs Union is expected to be fully operational in 2012 and many 
member countries are already part of a free trade area (FTA).  These moves should enhance the economic potential of a region 
whose combined population of 160.5 million is about 17 percent of Africa’s total.  The combined GDP is 42 percent and 
landmass is 22 percent of the continent’s total.           

Progress on trade and regional integration has nevertheless been slower than desired due to several factors: overlapping regional 
arrangements and membership, political turmoil in some countries, political sensitivities between countries, weak productive 
capacity, low value addition in the production chain, and unsupportive business environment.  Inadequate infrastructure is 
another major challenge. Poor transportation network and infrastructure, insufficient energy supply, and underdeveloped ICT a ll 
contribute to the region’s poor trade performance.  

Mozambique can play an important role in ameliorating infrastructure bottlenecks.  The country enjoys a privileged and 
strategic location as the natural exit to most of its landlocked neighbors, in particular Zimbabwe, Zambia, and Malawi. The 
transport infrastructure of central Mozambique extends east to west, from the Port of Beira to Zimbabwe, and marginally to 
Malawi and Zambia. The southern transport network links the Port of Maputo to the northeastern part of South Africa, 
Swaziland, and Zimbabwe. These two ―transport clusters‖ are multimodal, mostly functional, connecting mining and 
agricultural clusters inside Mozambique and in neighboring countries to exit ports. The quality of roads along these corridor s is 
relatively good and the railway system is mostly functional, albeit in needs for significant upgrade and rehabilitation.     

The regional importance of Mozambique also extends to the power and ICT sectors.  The country, already a net exporter of 
electricity, still has untapped hydropower potential mainly in the Zambezi watershed.  Plans to expand the generation and 
transmission infrastructure, which involve Bank participation, is underway which will enhance the country’s role as a key 
player in the regional power market, catering to the demand for clean energy in South Africa and other neighboring countries.  
In ICT, domestic fiber-optic backbone extends to all provincial capitals in the country and the commissioning of two fiber-optic 
submarine cables (the first of which was completed in 2009) will add significantly to Mozambique’s international Internet 
capacity.  The parallel fiber-optic infrastructure not only provides redundancy in access to an international gateway, but 
implicitly creates competitive conditions between landing points.   

Despite the potential that exists, Mozambique and its neighbors are far from having an efficient, seamless and cost-effective 
trans-boundary network of infrastructure that could significantly facilitate regional economic integration.  The road network 
needs to be improved and extended, and it must connect the east-west transport corridors to one another.  Rehabilitation, 
upgrade, and maintenance of railways are needed to meet growing demand from increased cross-border trade and domestic coal 
production.  Mozambique also needs to improve the financial sustainability of the power sector and take advantage of the 
opportunities that power trade offers to the country.  The potential for ICT is hampered by the need to further develop the 
Internet market.  All these issues require large and sustained investments over decades, with the needed participation of the 
private sector and nontraditional financiers. Weak institutional capacity similarly poses a sizeable challenge.   

Source: Mozambique’s Infrastructure: A Continental Perspective (World Bank, 2011) 

36. Of Mozambique’s network of 37,000 kilometers of roads, only about 6,000 kilometers are 
paved. Road density per land area is low at 46 meters per square kilometer due to the large size of the 
country, but quite average relative to the population at 423 meters per 1,000 people. Estimates suggest 
that the network could provide potential access (measured as those living within 2 kilometers of any road) 
to around 41 percent of the rural population. However, because of the poor condition of the network, the 
share of the rural population with reliable, all-year access is much smaller (the Government’s 
Performance Assessment Framework puts it at 11 percent). Poor road condition contributes to high 
vehicle operating costs, high transport costs, and low traffic volumes, posing major constraints to 
agricultural areas. Moreover, much of the transport infrastructure was designed to serve the colonial 
economy, providing access to seaports for landlocked countries in southern Africa. This has had serious 
implications, particularly for the agriculturally productive areas of the north and center , which historically 
have been poorly integrated into the national markets. Through the Government’s Roads and Bridges 
Management and Maintenance Program, there has been much progress in expanding links to agricultural 
areas; securing access to ports; upgrading corridors to neighboring countries to encourage industrial 

19 

 
development; and improving the main north-south road to stimulate internal commerce and provide 
access to markets, district capitals, employment opportunities, and educational and health facilities .  

37. Over the past decade, the Government has invested substantially to accelerate access to and 
improve quality of modern energy services. Mozambique is endowed with huge energy resources. The 
Cahora Bassa dam is one of the largest hydropower installations in Africa, generating 2,075 Megawatts 
(or 85 percent of the country’s current energy production capacity), with much of this power exported 
regionally. The country’s potential hydropower generation is estimated at 13,000 Megawatts, with the 
capacity to produce 65,000 Gigawatt-hours per year of energy. This untapped resource has attracted 
significant foreign private sector interest in investing in several power mega-projects that could make 
Mozambique one of the largest power producers in the African continent. Despite this potential, 
Mozambique has — even with significant gains in recent years — one of the lowest electrification rates in 
southern Africa, with approximately 15 percent of households having access to electricity, half of them 
living in Maputo and its surrounding areas and most of the remainder in the provincial capitals and 
municipal district seats. Most of these urban and peri-urban centers are connected to the main national 
electrical grid.  

38. Access to grid-based electrification in the rural areas is extremely low at two percent. Due to 
low demographic densities and geographically dispersed loads, access will remain very low for the 
foreseeable future. Increasing household access to grid-based electricity is a major focus of the 
Government but requires significant concessional financing. In addition, the majority of Mozambicans 
rely on biomass such as wood, charcoal, dung from animals or agricultural waste as their principal energy 
sources, all of which have a number of detrimental effects on people’s health and the environment. Off-
grid electrification schemes (such as solar photovoltaic systems) have and can continue to increase access 
to modern energy services. But substantial and sustained investments are required, anchored by a long -
term national electrification strategy and a medium-term spatial, least-cost rollout of grid-based and 
complementary off-grid programs. 

39. While teledensity has shot up in recent decades, access to broadband is still limited, and is 
particularly expensive outside of Maputo.  With the introduction of a second mobile operator in 2002, 
tele-density shot up from 0.8 percent in 2000 to 8 percent in 2006 to 22 percent by 2009 and close to 30 
percent in 2011.  Access to Internet and broadband is still expensive, especially outside of Maputo.  The 
lack of competitively priced backbone access constitutes one of the most severe barriers for operators to 
expand.  A deficient telecommunication infrastructure is a barrier for accessing information, for doing 
business, in particular outside of Maputo, and to achieve effective decentralization.  

40. Low-level access and poor service delivery characterize water supply and sanitation in 
Mozambique. Only 43 percent of the population has access to safe water and 19 percent to adequate 
sanitation. The rural-urban disparities are acute; while 70 percent of urban residents have access to safe 
water supply and 47 percent to adequate sanitation, the corresponding numbers for rural inhabitants are 30 
percent and 6 percent, respectively. Poor and uneven access to safe drinking water and adequate 
sanitation is responsible for regular outbreaks of cholera and diarrhea, a major cause of child illness and 
death. While urban areas are better served, Mozambique is experiencing a trend seen in Sub -Saharan 
Africa as a whole. Service provision has not kept pace with rapid urbanization and, as such, the share of 
the urban population with access to water and sanitation actually declined during the 1990-2006 period. 

20 

 
41. This decline is particularly notable in the Greater Maputo area where safe water supply 
ranks low among major urban areas. On average, water is supplied for about 9 hours per day 
(compared to 14 hours in 2005) with some areas limited to about 5 hours. The long -term supply of water 
to the Maputo area is of major concern given the city’s contribution to overall economic growth. It is 
estimated that by 2012, the present source of water (the Umbeluzi River) will be fully utilized and will 
still be able to serve about 73 percent of the population. In the meantime , the estimated demand for water 
in the Greater Maputo area is expected to grow from about 206,000 cubic meters per day in 2012 to about 
560,000 cubic meters per day in 2035. The rapidly increasing numbers of peri -urban residents (around 
200,000 people per year) without access to adequate sanitation facilities and fecal sludge management 
services is of particular concern from a public health perspective. 

Climate Change and Natural Disaster 

42. Mozambique ranks third among African countries most exposed to risks from extreme 
weather events in the form of floods, cyclones, and droughts.30  Drought is the most frequent disaster, 
occurring primarily in the southern and central regions with a frequency of 7 in 10 and 4 in 10 years, 
respectively. There are areas in these regions classified as semi-arid and arid (Gaza, Inhambane, and 
Maputo) where rain, even when above average, is inadequate and results in critical water shortages and 
limited agriculture productivity. An estimated 35 percent of the population is now thought to be 
chronically food insecure. Economic impacts of drought seem to be most significant in Zambezi Province, 
where production losses could range between US$12 million to US$170 million in maize alone.  Floods 
in Mozambique occur most frequently in the southern and central regions, along river basins in low-lying 
regions, and in areas with poor drainage systems. They are linked not only to heavy rainfall but also to 
water drainage from rivers in upstream neighboring countries. Water from nine major river systems from 
vast areas of southeastern Africa finds its way to the Indian Ocean across Mozambque. The flood in 2000 
killed about 800 people and displaced 540,000.  Most recently, in January of 2012, Tropical Storm Funso, 
while never making landfall, directly affected 65,000 people whose homes were inundated and suffered 
severe damage.  

43. From January to March, Mozambique is subject annually to 3 or 4 cyclones, which travel up 
the Mozambique Channel. More than 60 percent of the population of 22 million live in coastal areas and 
is therefore highly vulnerable to seawater inundation, as are coastal agriculture and the fisheries sector . 
Such inundation threatens coastal infrastructure such as roads and housing. In some areas of Beira, 30 to 
40 meters of beach have been eroded in the past 15 to 20 years. Storm surges pose a huge threat to coastal 
infrastructure as they can temporarily raise sea levels by as much as five meters. While many of the major 
coastal cities of Mozambique have infrastructure in place to stem the effects of such extreme events, 
many are in need of serious maintenance. In regional projections, climate change is expected to increase 
the frequency and magnitude of weather events. As a result, droughts, floods , and cyclones are likely to 
pose a large threat to the country’s economic growth.  

Social Protection    

44. Along with natural disasters and the projected impact of climate change, exogenous shocks 
stemming from global economic events expose the extreme vulnerability of the majority of the 

30 Mozambique: Economics of Adaptation to Climate Change (World Bank, 2010). 

21 

 
                                                            
population falling near or below the national poverty line . According to a 2007 FAO assessment, 20 
of the 128 districts in the country are ―highly prone to drought‖, 30 to flooding, and 7 to both. The poorer 
households tend to spend a higher share of their budget on food and have fewer assets (wealth). Floods 
and cyclones have the strongest impact on household expenditures, reducing them by about 32 percent. 
Droughts are estimated to have an impact of approximately 17 percent. However, the impact on 
households’ expenditure from idiosyncratic shocks is even higher. It is estimated that the death of a 
breadwinner may cause a reduction in household’s expenditure by mover 50 percent, while illness would 
reduce it in about 25 percent.  Only a minor proportion of workers, usually the less poor (formal workers 
and public servants) have access to any kind of insurance or any other social benefit. An equally low 
proportion of households has access to financial and credit markets. Social assistance interventions 
comprise few and in some cases fragmented social transfers as well as other welfare programs with 
limited coverage and unclear targeting methods or eligibility criteria. Consequently, households usually 
have to rely on informal coping mechanisms to address seasonal as well as unpredictable shocks, such as 
reducing food consumption or selling assets. These strategies not only represent a further barrier for poor 
households to overcome poverty and vulnerability but may inflict irreversible damage to human capital 
formation (especially as a result of chronic malnutrition among infants , which is likely to affect learning 
capacity as children and productivity as adults).  

45. Since 2007, the Government has been taking measures to establish basic social protection . 
The Social Protection Law (Law 4/2007) was issued in 2007, and the Government approved the Basic 
Social Protection strategy in 2010. The Government has also made progress in defining clear institutional 
responsibilities regarding social protection and social safety net strategy and programs. In this framework 
and under the overall coordination of the Ministry of Women and Social Action (MMAS), the Productive 
Social Action, a multi-sector strategy, will promote the socio-economic inclusion of vulnerable and food-
insecure population with the opportunities to work. At the core of the strategy is an intervention to 
provide seasonal (temporary) but predictable sources of income to households affected by regular and 
unexpected shocks mainly by participating in public works and complemented by other income-
generation initiatives. The labor-intensive public works program will complement the current cash 
transfer intervention (with targeted public service announcement to the elderly, chronically ill, and 
disable) to provide a temporary source of income to those able to work during periods of food insecurity, 
thus reaching all vulnerable households. A strategic combination of public works programs and cash 
transfers may be adequate to gradually link vulnerable groups both to productive and income-generating 
activities and to social services for human capital accumulation and thus contribute to economic growth 
and poverty reduction. To ensure that the programs reach the poorest and most vulnerable , an accurate 
targeting mechanism to select beneficiaries should be developed and tested. 

Service Delivery 

46. Rising demand for social services is not being met with a commensurate increase in supply. 
Mozambique has made good progress toward achieving the Millennium Development Goals. However, 
the progress could have been even greater if the supply to essential services could have kept up with the 
increasing demand. For example, net enrollment in primary education more than doubled from 45 to 95 
percent between 1998 and 2010. This massive increase has put enormous pressure on the system. Recent 
data suggest quality is deteriorating and there is an acute shortage of spaces in secondary schools. In 
health, the percentage of the population with access to a health unit wi thin 45 minutes’ travel by foot rose 

22 

 
from 55 to 65 percent between 2002-3 and 2008-9.  The increase in the numbers of schools and clinics is 
constrained by the ability of government to train and hire all the teachers and health workers that are 
required and provide adequate financing for school materials and drugs.  

47. 
Inequities in access to basic social services persist. While access to social services has increased, 
it has often been inequitable in terms of gender, income, or geography. Provincial disparities also exist, 
where the northern and central provinces have lower access to health services, education, water, 
sanitation, and social protection. These provincial disparities are reinforced by lower per capita budget 
allocations. The proportion of school age population enrolled in secondary education varies from only 2 
percent in Niassa to 12 percent in Maputo. Poorer families are also less likely to access services. For 
example, antenatal care coverage varies between 58 percent and almost 100 percent in the lowest and 
highest quintiles.   

Governance and Public Sector Management 

48. Another challenge for Mozambican society is weak governance structures, including 
institutions and the rule of law. The Worldwide Governance Indicators for 2009 indicate improvements 
since 2004 across 5 indicators, most prominently for political stability but also those measuring 
government effectiveness, regulatory quality, rule of law, and control of corruption.31  However, on voice 
and accountability, Mozambique’s percentile showed a modest slippage . Compared to country groupings, 
Mozambique’s percentile ranking exceeds those of Sub-Saharan Africa and other low-income countries 
across all 6 indicators. Nevertheless, there is plenty of room for improvement. With the exception of 
political stability, all other indicators for Mozambique in the 2009 assessment fall below the 50th 
percentile. Despite adoption of the National Anti-Corruption Strategy in 2006, perceived corruption has 
increased. Transparency International (TI) Perception Index (scale of 10 to 0, ―very clean‖ to ―highly 
corrupt‖) for Mozambique has been static at 2.8 from 2004 and 2007; slipped to 2.7 in 2008; down to 2.5 
in 2009; the back to 2.7 in 2010, a score that did not change in 2011.32 And while there has been stepped 
up efforts by the donor community to engage civil society organizations (CSOs) and to give voice and 
increase participation, tangible results beyond the demonstration effects of donor projects have been slow 
to materialize.   

49. Civil society engagement in governance is recent in Mozambique.  Accountability mechanisms 
are generally thought to be weak.33 Voice and accountability are rather unfamiliar concepts in 
Mozambique, and citizens know very little about rights and responsibilities.34 There is still a culture of 
deference towards authorities, especially in rural areas, which restricts citizens’ active engagement.  There 
is general agreement that non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and CSOs are typically characterized 
as weak in capacity and organization.  In addition, the existing legislation makes it cumbersome, 
complex, and expensive to register an organization.  For instance, a minimum of ten people is required to 
start the registration process, and all signatories have to submit proof of no criminal record, which is

extremely difficult to obtain.  Overall, CSOs are excluded from real decision-making processes and their 
influence on development policies remains weak. 

50. Mozambique has come a long way from its dire state of public financial management at the 
end of the civil war. Three successive Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) 
assessments help trace the course of the remarkable improvements resulting from a strong emphasis on 
the introduction of a new legal framework, coupled with the implementation of an integrated financial 
management information system (e-Sistafe). The proportion of indicators scored B or above has gone 
from 39 percent in 2004, to 54 percent in 2006 and 61 percent in 2009. This puts Mozambique in the top 
league of PFM performers in Africa. However, this relatively ineffective spending despite good PEFA 
scores is an apparent paradox. PEFA data shows that although Mozambique does wel l on formal, 
centralized processes, such as following a structured budget process, maintaining aggregate fiscal 
discipline, or producing financial statements on time, significant challenges remain in utilizing the new 
rules and systems toward improving day-to-day practices at sector level. For instance, manually operated 
processes coexist with electronic technology, in particular for expenditure commitment. Similarly, 
although automated financial reporting capabilities and internal oversight entities exist throughout 
government, there is little evidence that they are properly utilized to monitor spending for compliance, 
economy, efficiency, and effectiveness. These findings about the gap between the theoretical blueprint of 
PFM reform at play, partial implementation of reforms, and the reality of daily practices are especially 
acute when it comes to spending in sectors, provinces, and districts as opposed to central finance 
agencies.   

51. While progress was made in improving Mozambique's public procurement system, 
challenges remain for enhancing its efficiency and transparency and strengthening the capacity of 
public officials to implement the procurement legislation. The Government has demonstrated strong 
commitment to improve the country's procurement system with its the adoption of the 2005 procurement 
legislation and the creation of a new central procurement institution (UFSA) in 2006 -2007, and a unit for 
execution and management of acquisition (UGEA). These reforms were supported by a capacity-building 
exercise program, and technicians were trained at the central, provincial, district, and local municipality 
levels. Nonetheless, the 2008 Country Procurement Assessment Review (CPAR) identified areas for 
improvement in the legal framework, capacity, and transparency. By publishing a revised Procurement 
Decree in 2010 and by reinforcing UFSA and installing 821 UGEAs, the Government has contributed 
significantly to the legal framework and institutional architecture; but little has been achieved on the 
operation of the system and less on integrity. Although the capacity of public officials improved over the 
years, limited detailed knowledge of the procurement legislation, meager financial resources, and 
resistance to change required with adoption of new procurement practices undermines their ability to 
fulfill their mandate. 

52. Public sector reform shows limited results. The Government of Mozambique adopted the Global 
Strategy for the Public Sector Reform (2001-2011) aimed at enabling the public sector to promote socio-
economic development and reduce poverty. It is in the process of developing the next strategy. Significant 
progress had been made with the creation of an integrated database allowing strategic management of 
human resources and establishment of an electronic payment management system (e-FOLHA) to improve 
payroll management. The implementation of a new wage policy in 2009 and the approbation of a national 
policy for HIV/AIDS and disabilities in the work place also show positive trends. Progress however 

24 

 
remains limited in other areas. There is a lack of clear reform priorities and little attention is paid to 
sequencing reform. The absence of a communication strategy supporting the implementation of the 
reform and the lack of clarity of roles and responsibilities of central and decentralized government 
structures also undermines the implementation of the Public Sector Reform. Inter-governmental 
coordination remains a significant challenge in Mozambique. 

53. Decentralization is an explicit strategy of the Government to achieve many of the objectives 
of its PARP for 2011-14.  The broad aim is to bring the management of public services closer to the 
people and to allow districts to act as ―polos de desenvolvimento‖ (poles of development).  A self -
standing decentralization policy does not yet exist but the Law on Local Organs of the State (LOLE) in 
2003 and its regulation in 2005, have provided the legal framework for decentralization. They provide the 
basis for the structure of local governments, deconcentration of functions to the districts, legal 
requirements regarding preparation of local level development plans, and establishment of mechanisms 
for flow of funds to the local level.  Progress, however, has been tempered by shortcomings to 
implementation, including the level of resource transfers, strengthening financial management, 
accountability, and service delivery.  On the municipal side, the creation of new municipalities together 
with the transfers of responsibilities is creating additional demands on serv ice delivery.  But small 
budgets and weak institutions have made it difficult for municipalities to comply with their mandates.  To 
accelerate the process of decentralization, and specifically to make policy objectives more specific and 
operational, the Government is preparing a long-awaited Decentralization Strategy to be approved by the 
Council of Ministers.  In the meantime, as the 2011 by-elections showed, the simple fact that there are 
municipalities with a political life of their own, and that local elections can take an unexpected turn, 
means that the decentralization process, limited though it may be, is contributing to political evolution 
and change. 

E. Government Priorities and Medium-Term Strategy 

54. Against the backdrop of continued strong growth and a deceleration of poverty reduction, 
the Government seeks to reorient its new poverty reduction strategy to make economic growth 
more inclusive and broad-based. The Government’s third poverty reduction strategy (PARP) is the 
operational plan for the Government’s Five-Year Program and sets out a broad and ambitious agenda of 
reforms. In preparing the strategy, the Government held broad-based consultations with major 
stakeholders and civil society. While reflecting some continuity from the past PARP, it acknowledges the 
challenges of sustained and inclusive poverty reduction; the urban–rural disparities in human 
development and service delivery; uneven development across regions; and the precarious situation of 
women, children, the elderly, and other vulnerable groups. Its principal theme reflects the intensified 
policy dialogue among the World Bank, other development partners, and the Government: combating 
poverty requires transforming the structure of production and economic productivity and their linkages, 
the centrality of rural development in undertaking such transformation, and strengthening the domestic 
market while facilitating its integration into the national economy. The PARP seeks to return to its 
impressive record of poverty reduction and establishes a target of cutting poverty incidence from the 55 
percent reported in the 2008-09 household survey to 42 percent in 2014.35 

35 Inquérito sobre Orçamento Familiar 2008/09 (Instituto Nacional de Estatística, 2010). 

25 

 
                                                            
55. The strategic orientation of the PARP is clustered around three pillars that contribute to the 
overall objective of inclusive economic growth and poverty reduction. These are (a) increased 
agricultural and fishery production and productivity, (b) job creation, and (c) human and social 
development. The three main PARP pillars are complemented by two supporting themes (or cross-cutting 
pillars) on fostering good governance and preserving macroeconomic stability. The PARP includes a 
strategic matrix of key indicators that are the basis for monitoring progress. It is the intention that these 
indicators will be monitored through existing national systems that comprise the annual economic and 
social plan (PES), the annual monitoring of the PES (Balanço do PES), and the annual budget and budget 
execution reports. A subset of the indicators will be used to jointly assess progress on General Budget 
Support through the Performance Assessment Framework (PAF). 

56. The Government designed the PARP as a dynamic and flexible document.  In contrast to the 
previous two PRSPs, the PARP allows the Government to adjust priorities and targets in light of changing 
economic and social conditions and international developments, and in tandem with the implementation 
of sectoral strategies, such as the Strategic Plan for Agricultural Development (PEDSA) for 2010 -19, the 
forthcoming Financial Sector Development Strategy, and the successor to the 2008-2012 Strategy for the 
Improvement of the Business Environment in Mozambique.  The objectives and indicators would be 
updated in the PES and reflected in the PAF, in agreement with budget support donors.  The Bank 
strongly welcomes this new dynamic nature of the document.   

II. WORLD BANK GROUP COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY 

57. The new Country Partnership Strategy for FY12-15 will be implemented as Mozambique 
confronts a critical juncture in its development.  The country is faced with the daunting and immediate 
task of maximizing the social and economic benefits of its natural resources; transitioning toward a more 
inclusive growth strategy anchored to productive agriculture; accelerating efforts to achieve MDG targets; 
putting in place policies, programs, and institutions to mitigate the myriad shocks that impact the country; 
and reversing the perception of a stalled reform process that could lead to cuts in development assistance.  
These constitute only part of a weighty development agenda whose implementation will be tested over the 
next few years by political events and on-going global economic challenges. 

58. The Government has expressed a strong desire for robust support and leadership by the 
World Bank at this important juncture in the country’s history.  The CPS for FY12-15 supports the 
catalytic role the Bank is taking to: develop one of the region’s largest hydroelectric generation and 
transmission projects in partnership with the private sector and donors; develop the burgeoning natural 
resources sector in a sustainable, well-managed, and transparent way based on global good practice; 
crowd-in financing, particularly from the private sector, to help rehabilitate or upgrade its railways, road, 
and other infrastructure that are key to national and regional development; leverage private sector 
investments in mega-projects to stimulate ancillary economic activity in growth corridors; strengthen the 
links between improved governance and enhanced service delivery through innovative results-based 
approaches; put in place a comprehensive and unprecedented social protection program to protect 
vulnerable populations; provide technical leadership and a convening role on donor dialogue on 
agriculture and climate change; and close the vast infrastructure gap.  Leadership on the operational and 
financing side will be underpinned by a renewed commitment to analytical and advisory activity (AAA).             

26 

 
59. The CPS for FY12-15 incorporates lessons learned from the past and is strongly aligned with 
the country’s vision for the future.  It is aligned with the priorities and embedded in the framework laid 
out in the Africa Regional Strategy. Gender, social accountability, and nutrition – all critical to the 
country’s vision of inclusive growth, will be mainstreamed throughout the portfolio (see Box 6 on gender 
mainstreaming). The CPS will employ an integrated approach that stresses (a) partnerships with various 
stakeholders; (b) stepped up demand-driven knowledge generation and advisory work; and (c) use of IDA 
resources as a catalyst for leveraging financing by government and traditional and non -traditional 
partners. These approaches will be undertaken in the context of greater selectivity; efforts to address 
portfolio fragmentation and quality; cross-sectoral approaches to complex development challenges; and 
continued efficiency gains in project preparation and implementation, greater decentralization, and results 
orientation.       

A. Lessons Learned from Previous CPS 

60. The Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) undertook a Country Program Evaluation (CPE) 
of the World Bank’s assistance to Mozambique in 2010.36  The CPE covered the period from FY01-08 
although many of the general findings could also apply to the period of the previous CPS for FY08 -11. Its 
main findings included the following: (a) Bank support to agriculture did not have a significant impact on 
the productivity of small-scale farmers in rural areas; (b) progress in Bank support to the SME sector was 
slow owing to limited access to finance; and (c) the Bank’s program also fell short of intended results in 
improving the quality of social services, countering the perception of corruption, strengthening the 
judicial system, and stemming the spread of HIV/AIDS. It also noted that the IFC portfolio was 
dominated by investments in two foreign-owned, capital-intensive mega-projects (with IDA participation) 
that contributed to growth through increased exports and helped enhance foreign investors’ perception of 
the investment climate. However, the extent of their development impact has been limited due to weak 
linkages with the local economy and limited employment generation. 

61. The IEG evaluation made several key recommendations to the World Bank. The IEG 
recommendations included: (a) help make credit more accessible to small and medium-size enterprises, 
assist to improve business procedures and regulations, and ensure a firm basis for increased agricultural 
productivity (helping Mozambique sustain high growth while reshaping its pattern to facilitate greater 
employment creation and poverty reduction);  (b) focus analytical work on infrastructure strategy, 
agricultural productivity, education quality, and HIV/AIDS; and (c) support more efficient public 
expenditures with emphasis on high-quality social services. The evaluation noted that while the Bank 
advanced the harmonization and alignment agenda through joint efforts with other development partners 
to provide budget support and while this arrangement helped to structure the dialogue and improved 
predictability of resource transfers, it also limited the Bank’s flexibility and increased transaction costs .  

62. These findings not only remain valid for the FY08-11 CPS period, they offer a degree of 
caution for the Bank’s work over the next four years. The broad agenda that includes supporting small 
and medium-size enterprises and in particular addressing bottlenecks to accessing finance and advisory 
services will require long-term engagement with Government to see the type of structural, policy, and 
institutional reforms needed to stimulate entrepreneurship and to provide incen tives for small and 

36 Mozambique Country Program Evaluation (World Bank, Independent Evaluation Group, IEG 2010/07, April 
2010). 

27 

 
                                                            
medium-size enterprises to move to the formal sector. Stimulating agricultural productivity is also a long -
term proposition that will require greater Government coordination, commitment, and a clearer vision of 
how productivity is to be achieved. Stimulating the growth of agribusiness, for example, would require a 
broad set of policy and institutional reforms, including politically sensitive reforms involving land policy 
and administration, as well as significant institutional building of key agencies.  As Mozambique 
undergoes such transformative processes, poverty levels remain high and a large segment of the 
population remains highly vulnerable to shocks.  A minimum level of social protection would address 
vulnerability      

63. The CPS Completion Report (CPSCR) reviewed CPS implementation during the FY08-11.  
The CPSCR rated the CPS for FY08-11 as ―moderately satisfactory‖ in terms of both the program 
performance and the Bank’s performance.  The CPSCR found that the CPS was relevant, adequa tely 
designed, responsive to client needs, integrated with the overall development partner harmonization 
agenda, and that the anticipated portfolio was successfully delivered. The Bank’s performance was 
characterized by a well-performing portfolio (on balance) and delivery of a larger than envisioned lending 
program and high-quality and just-in-time knowledge products. However, there were some delays in 
project delivery, leading to uneven achievement of outcomes. Moreover, the results matrix and the 
strategy itself were not updated vis-à-vis a mid-term CPS progress report, rendering some outcomes 
unobservable. The last semester of the CPS period also witnessed a deterioration of the portfolio with four 
IDA projects in problem status.    

64. The CPSCR highlights operational and portfolio issues that should be addressed in the CPS 
for FY12-15.  First and foremost, the failure to monitor CPS outcomes and to prepare a mid-term CPS 
progress report to assess the need for strategic and operational changes in keeping with changing country 
conditions was one of the most significant shortcomings of the past four years. The proposed CPS FY12 -
15 should take a pro-active approach and have an annual stocktaking exercise on CPS milestones and 
implement the necessary adaptations at mid-term together with a CPS progress report. The CPS 
monitoring should be based on a more selective results matrix with a smaller number of outcomes to 
avoid fragmentation of results. In addition, the results framework should carefully take into accoun t the 
level of results it can realistically achieve over the CPS period, given the timeframe, risks, and resources 
available to support operations. It would also be worth trying to map investments per supported outcome 
as this may place particular attention to high-value outcomes.  

65. Going forward the CPS should lay out a more focused and planned AAA program related to 
PRSC areas to inform the sector dialogue, as suggested by the IEG Country Program Evaluation. 
Together with more Public Expenditure Surveys, analytical work will then have a better chance of 
influencing reforms on which in turn investment operations can build. The Bank team should also take 
seriously the suggestion by the IEG Country Program Evaluation to assume a stronger leadership role in 
the budget support program, building on analytical work as a foundation. Besides other priority areas 
determined by budget support areas and sector engagements, the analysis should focus on analyzing why 
poverty rates are stagnating while Mozambique's economy sustains high levels of growth. 

66. Lastly, echoing the CPE recommendations by IEG, the CPSCR notes that the heavy aid 
architecture entails high transaction costs on the donors’ side. While there have been significant 
improvements in recent years, there is scope for streamlining the donor aid architecture in Mozambique in 

28 

 
order for the donor community as well as Government to benefit from efficiency gains. This may need 
high-level dialogue beyond the level of Heads of Cooperation.  

B. CPS Consultations with Country Stakeholders 

67. World Bank staff undertook consultations with civil society organizations, local and central 
Government officials, and development partners.  The consultations took place in four cities: Maputo, 
Beira, Nampula, and Pemba.  Approximately 300 individuals took part in the CSO consultations, 
representing a wide range of organizations, from private sector groups to international NGOs that 
undertake both advocacy and operational work. Stakeholders also included groups affiliated with political 
parties, academic institutions, student associations, private sector representatives, union movements, 
farmers associations, civic youth organizations, members of local community-based organizations, as well 
as national and international NGOs.  The main messages included: 

 The World Bank should be more visible, known and understood at the local level. Civil society 
has little knowledge of the Bank's activities in Mozambique and in their respective communities. 
Task managers or members of the implementing units should use their travels to liaise more 
often with civil society about their specific projects.  These comments are being taken on board 
as part of the preparation of the Bank’s communications strategy of engagement with 
Mozambican society, including the press, civil society, and ordinary citizens to improve 
awareness of the Bank’s support and development issues more generally.  

 There was a universal call for the Bank to work more closely with civil society, beyond 
consultations, and to partner with civil society operationally. Suggested areas of collaboration 
included service delivery at the community level, project monitoring and evaluation, governance 
and anti-corruption, and monitoring of project finances by implementing agencies.  Whether 
such a partnership develops, CSOs asked that these consultations do not end with the individual 
workshops but rather should continue through follow-up communications. To this end, the mid-
term CPS progress report would be a good opportunity to have follow-up consultations to 
inform participants of progress on CPS objectives.  

 Many participants expressed the opinion that the Bank was committed to greater transparency 
and openness - both in terms of itself as well as to the Government. Given the difficulties in 
obtaining information from Government authorities on policies and decisions that affect their 
lives, participants requested that the Bank play a more active role in facilitating access to 
information about Government policies and programs. More broadly speaking, CSOs - 
particularly those based in Maputo - called for the Bank to push for improved governance and 
anti-corruption as a means to enhance development effectiveness. 

68. Among local provincial, district, and municipal authorities, discussions focused largely on 
local needs.  Service delivery, particularly in health and education, was brought up consistently as a 
challenge, given devolved responsibility and inadequate budgets.  Inadequate infrastructure, particularly 
in more rural areas, was also raised as a main concern.  Discussion also revolved around possible Bank 
support to local industries, such as tourism, fisheries, agriculture, and manufacturing.  Echoing one of the 
messages from CSO participants, local authorities asked that Bank teams take some time to make 

29 

 
―courtesy visits‖ to keep appropriate authorities abreast of Bank activities and to explore possibilities for 
collaboration. 

69. Directors of central ministries participated in a roundtable discussion about the Bank’s 
program of active and planned lending and analytic work.  The Bank team stressed the importance of 
maintaining a well-performing portfolio and high disbursement ratios. While acknowledging that there 
were elements within country systems that require sorting out, Government participants noted that Bank 
procedures were also cumbersome and cause implementation delays. Government also pointed out that 
there was scope to improve just-in-time analytic work to inform Government decision-making and to 
underpin policy and institutional reforms, as well as strategies and programs. Lastly, Government 
acknowledged the need for greater coordination across sector ministries as the Bank adopts a more multi-
sectoral approach to its program.     

70. The Bank held two consultations with development partners in Maputo.  One consultation was 
with the UN country team and included the heads of all UN agencies. The other included heads of 
bilateral aid agencies providing budget support (G-19 members) as well as other non-budget support 
donors, both traditional and emerging, including Japan and China.  The consultations provided the Bank 
an opportunity to lay out the overall thrust of the CPS and the proposed program of lending and analytic 
work; to emphasis the need for stronger and broader partnerships, greater program selectivity, and multi -
sectoriality; and to discuss in detail specific projects, such as the Growth Poles Development Project. 
Development partners expressed support for the Bank’s plan to increase its program of analytic work (a 
participant commented on the notable decline in Bank analytic work that used to underpin the PRSCs); 
welcomed the Bank’s proposed engagement in ―new‖ areas, such as climate change, social protection, as 
well as plans to deepen involvement in EITI and agriculture.  A question on trade -offs was posed to the 
Bank team in reference to the flat budget environment the Bank is operating in while pursuing a fairly 
ambitious program covering myriad sectors. Other partners questioned whether the Bank was doing 
enough to ―push the envelope‖ in areas such as water, agriculture, and governance.  Aid coordination and 
development effectiveness were also discussed, particularly in relation to the Bank’s participation in 
sector working groups and budget support.      

C. Country Partnership Strategy Objectives and Program 

71. The CPS is aligned with both country and Bank strategies. The CPS FY12-15 takes as its 
starting point the country’s own vision of its development goals and its strategy for achieving them. The 
close collaboration among Government, the Bank, and development partners over the past two years has 
led to considerable symmetry between the PARP and the proposed CPS, not only in terms of the main 
theme of inclusive, pro-poor growth but also in its focus on priority policy and institutional areas that will 
be key to achieving the Government’s vision. The CPS is consistent with the IDA policy framework’s 
main themes of climate change, gender considerations, and regional integration and is also embedded 
within the framework of the Africa Regional Strategy.  Like the Africa Regional Strategy, the CPS has 
three pillars.  The first two are Competitiveness and Employment, and Vulnerability and Resilience.  The 
third, Governance and Public Sector Capacity, is considered a ―foundation‖ (see Figure 4).   

72. Seventeen outcomes have been defined encompassing 30 outcome indicators. The set of 
indicators primarily derive from the ongoing Bank programs and not from products and services in the 

30 

 
pipeline, given the need to measure tangible results in two years’ time in the CPS Progress Report. The 
Progress Report, in turn, will include an updated Results Matrix taking into account indicators from new 
projects entering the pipeline and revised targets through the end of the CPS period . An overview of the 
major objectives, outcomes, and programs defined for each pillar is included below . The CPS Results 
Framework Matrix is found in Annex 1.  

Figure 4.  CPS Pillars and Alignment with Mozambique PARP 

 (a) Pillar I. Competitiveness and Employment 

73. Pillar I is expected to provide the principal support to the overarching CPS goal of broad-
based, inclusive, and pro-poor growth. There are eight objectives that underpin this goal: (a) improved 
regulatory environment; (b) improved management of development process through spatial planning; (c) 
increased crop yields and overall productivity; (d) increased employment and growth in the tourism 
sector; (e) improved provision and management of road infrastructure; (f) improved provision of water 
and sanitation service; (g) improved access to electricity; (h) improved access to affordable 
telecommunications; and (i) better educated, skilled, and healthier workforce. Achievement of these 
objectives entails a mix of investments, policy, and institutional reforms; capacity building; analytic 
work; and the ability to convene various stakeholders, including local communities and the private sector 
(Table 3).  The proposed program of new products and services supporting Pillar I is detailed in Table 4. 

74. 
 The on-going PRSC series has been the primary means of supporting reform . Over the next 
CPS period, FY12-15, the annual PRSCs will more strongly support reforms to improve the business 
environment, including simplifying administrative procedures and eliminating unnecessary regulations 
(e.g., import and export clearances); strengthening the financial sector; and maximizing the benefits from 
megaprojects, concessions, and public–private partnerships. Over the medium term, there is scope to 
support more fully the range of sectors in the PAF matrix for budget support, including addressing 
constraints to agricultural productivity, infrastructure provision and management, exploitable renewable 
and non-renewable resources, fisheries, and tourism.  The Bank is currently in discussion with

75. The Bank is working closely with IFC to provide the needed analytic and advisory support to 
improve the country’s business and investment climate.  The Competitiveness and Private Sector 
Development Project (FY09) aims to enhance the overall business environment by improving the SME 
competitiveness through improved access to business development services, broader tourism-led growth 
in Inhambane, and improved horticulture skills through a new training center in Nampula. It also invests 
in standards and quality-related services while strengthening the accounting profession .  The IFC’s 
Mozambique Investment Climate Project (FY12) will support and help implement key elements of the 
Competitiveness and Private Sector Development Project, improving the country's investment climate 
through regulatory simplification of business registration and licensing procedures. The Financial Sector 
TA Project (FY06) is part of an overall multi-donor framework to improve the soundness of the banking 
sector and public debt management through key policy, regulatory , and institutional reforms that aim to 
support the development of a financial sector capable of delivering more appropriate, affordable, and 
sustainable services needed by firms, both large and small and medium-size enterprises.  The Bank is 
looking at options to continue support to the financial sector, including a Financial Sector Access project 
that would focus on promoting access to financial services for households and businesses while 
consolidating the recent achievements in terms of financial sector stability and soundness.  The ongoing 
work on the Financial Sector Development Strategy will result in more immediate targeted advice, 
technical assistance, and enhanced policy dialogue for financial sector development.  

76. Supporting high growth SMEs is a key focus of IFC’s strategy in Mozambique.  Until 2009, 
IFC implemented an SME initiative that provides financing and technical assistance and aims to build the 
Mozambican economy's ―missing middle‖ by targeting local firms with long-term funding, hands-on 
partnership, and support in key business functions, including marketing, management, human resources, 
and information technology.  This program is now being handed over to a fund manager for expansion.   
IFC will expand its established SME capacity building programs, Business Edge and the SME toolkit, 
both implemented through partnerships with Mozambican institutions.  The third phase of IFC’s 
successful supplier linkages program with large firms, Mozlink, will transfer operational responsibility to 
the CPI.  IFC has helped increase access to finance by supporting a bank in Mozambique through 

32 

 
subordinated debt and credit line products plus advisory service aimed at helping the bank to grow and 
adequately manage SMEs.  Those projects assist the Bank in extending financing to the SMEs, including 
women entrepreneurs (Gender Finance) as well as growing its retail business in line with IFC’s strategy.  
IFC will replicate this approach with other banks, including supporting the establishment of new 
greenfield banks to spur competition in the sector, and potentially local currency lending.  

77. 
IFC support for large-scale projects 
will 
help 
ensure 
their 
broad-based 
development impact.  IFC has supported three 
large-scale industrial, natural resource, and 
infrastructure projects to date:  Mozal, the 
Sasol gas pipeline, and the Moatize coal mine 
and related infrastructure, the latter two as 
integrated World Bank Group efforts.  In the 
future, IFC will seek to support those large-
scale natural 
resource and 
infrastructure 
projects where IFC involvement can help 
ensure economic and social sustainability, and 
broad-based development impact.  Potential 
involvement currently ranges from projects in 
cement, infrastructure, and energy, including 
the extension of the Sasol pipeline project to 
Maputo for electricity production and industrial 
use.

78. The CPS FY12-15 will 
place 
appropriate emphasis on agriculture as a 
natural source of employment, livelihood, 
and inclusive growth and poverty reduction. 
The 
on-going Market-Led 
Smallholder 
Development in the Zambezia Project (FY06) 
has provided direct outreach and technical 
support 
to smallholder groups and other 
supply-chain participants 
in 
the area of 
production, marketing, applied research, and 
training. The project also provides resources 
for agriculture-related 
infrastructure; small-
scale investment, including farm-level storage facilities and small-scale processing units; improved 
natural resource management, and strengthening district-level agricultural planning. The new PROIRRI – 
Sustainable Irrigation Development Project (FY11) addresses infrastructure constraints to productivity by 
financing sustainable irrigation schemes in central Mozambique as well as tertiary roads segments, and 
energy supply to those schemes. To enhance sustainability of irrigation schemes and improve access to 
markets by smallholder farmers, it also strengthens institutional capacity and participatory irrigation 
management, and improves access to finance as a way of supporting the development of value chains.    

Note: Table does not include programs under implementation 

33 

 
 
The PROIRRI Project will directly link with the Spatial Development TA Project (FY11) and the Growth 
Poles / Corridors Project (FY13) that identify the Zambezi Corridor as one of the core geographic areas 
for agriculture-based economic development.  The regional Agriculture Productivity Project for Southern 
Africa (FY13) looks to strengthen and scale up regional cooperation in the generation of research, 
technology, training, and dissemination programs for priority commodities and induce the required 
transformation in the national research and extension system. To help ensure a healthy and skilled 
agricultural workforce, the Bank’s portfolio of health and education projects will continue to increase the 
numbers of rural schools and health facilities.  

Box 5.  Mainstreaming Gender in the Bank Portfolio 

The Bank recently undertook an assessment of how it is addressing gender issues in Mozambique.  The review involved 25 
projects, including 14 on-going IDA operations, 6 pipeline projects, and 5 ESW to be delivered in the beginning of the CPS 
period (FY12-15).  For a project to be considered as having a ―gender-responsive design‖, the project appraisal document 
(PAD) should demonstrate that (a) there has been a gender analysis or a gender-sensitive social assessment during project 
preparation, and/or relevant diagnosis and recommendations from a Country Gender Assessment (made by the Bank or 
partners) are adopted in the PAD, and/or consultations that address male and female beneficiaries separately informed the PAD; 
and (b) the results of that analysis have informed project design, as indicated by at least one of the following: (i) specific project 
policy or activity  that seeks to promote gender equality through either gender-targeted or universal policy/project intervention; 
or (ii) gender-specific target or indicator in the Results Framework.   

The review found that 64 percent of the projects in the current portfolio have a gender-responsive design. This means that a 
majority of projects in the portfolio have addressed gender issues in the preparation of the project and have identified spec ific 
project policies or activities that seek to promote gender equality through either project intervention and/or gende r specific 
indicators in the binding documents for the projects.  The review cautiously estimates that 75 percent of the country’s lending 
portfolio will be gender mainstreamed by the end of the CPS period in FY15. This estimate excludes all IDA projects, which 
are planned to end before FY15, and potential future projects not included in this review.  

The country program could benefit by showing how Bank assistance addresses gender issues. Only 50 percent of the ongoing 
and pipeline projects in the portfolio have a gender-informed results framework (in the ongoing project portfolio alone the level 
is 43 percent). This means that while the majority of projects in the portfolio draw on gender-related diagnostic work, and these 
are translated into specific project policy or actions, only half of the portfolio can generate measurable results related to gender. 
That said, the review finds that 70 percent of the projects in the pipeline are expected to generate gender impact and result s data, 
which means that the project portfolio holds the potential to improve its reporting on gender targets. 

79. Further support to the agriculture sector will include a programmatic Agriculture DPO 
(FY13-15).  Based on the analytical evidence from AAA and other sector work under the previous CPS, 
the Agriculture DPO will address policy and institutional constraints to the implementation of the 
country's 2010-2019 Strategic Plan for Agricultural Development (PEDSA) and the country’s 
commitments to the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Program (CAADP). The 
Agriculture DPO will align closely with the Economic Governance Project (FY13) activities in 
agriculture and is expected to contribute to outputs in the areas of: enhancing agriculture productivity 
through technology adoption, improving land access and land administration, improving access to rural 
finances, enhancing market access through rural roads improvements and supporting the decentralization 
of the agriculture administration.  

80. 
IFC and MIGA also support increased agricultural productivity through development of 
sustainable commercial agriculture/agribusiness. Two MIGA guarantees were issued for a sugar 
plantation project involving the rehabilitation of Mozambique’s largest sugar estate , which employs 8,000 
people and injects US$7 million in annual salaries and wages into the local economy, and contributes an 
estimated US$33 million annually to the Mozambican economy through import substitution and export 
earnings. MIGA also issued a guarantee for a project to develop land for rice production.  IFC has 

34 

 
supported the expansion of domestic grain processing, and currently is developing a pipeline of 
agriculture and agribusiness projects.  

81. Beyond agriculture, the Bank looks to support the tourism (particularly related to wildlife 
recovery and conservation) and fisheries sectors, both priorities of the Government and with 
untapped potential for growth. The on-going Transfrontier Conservation Areas and Tourism 
Development Project (FY06) has contributed to the growth of tourism in Mozambique by building the 
country’s capacity to manage natural tourism assets. The project has two major dimensions: (a) 
supporting reforms to the regulatory framework and (b) support to protected area management and 
sustainability. On the latter, the project has provided a model for shared growth by establishing 
community–private joint ventures whereby the community becomes a more prominent player in the 
development of tourism rather than the classic model of tourism investment. It is expected that five 
protected areas will have achieved minimal capacity to sustain wildlife recovery and gradually build their 
sustainability through tourism revenues. The follow-on project under preparation, Transfrontier 
Conservation Areas and Tourism Development Project II (FY14) looks to scale up the partnership with 
local communities, improve management capacity, and invest in infrastructure that will allow greater 
visitor access within the protected areas. Reductions in malaria transmission, as supported through the 
Health Service Delivery Project (FY09), are also likely to contribute to the growth of tourism.  The IFC 
Tourism Anchor Investment Program is implemented in collaboration with the Ministry of Tourism and 
local communities, facilitating private investment in tourism and helping implement regulatory reforms 
aimed at improving the investment climate in the sector.  The program has developed approaches to 
concessioning tourism development sites, including those in sensitive areas, and brought two initial 
projects to closure in Zambezia Province and in the Maputo Special Reserve.  

82. Fisheries are the foundation of economic growth in many rural and urban areas, and often 
the resource of last resort for poor, marginalized, and isolated communities. The on-going 
Community-based Coastal Resources Management and Sustainable Livelihoods Grant (FY09) targets the 
reduction of pressure on over-exploited marine and coastal resources through community awareness and 
promotion of sustainable exploitation methods and innovative alternative activities. It is expected that the 
project will provide a model for mitigating impact on coastal population brought on by future access 
restrictions to fishery grounds due to the expansion of coastal protected areas or need to maintain the 
health of fish resources. In parallel the Regional South West Indian Ocean Fisheries Project (FY08) 
supports the improvement of knowledge of fisheries resources, capacity building in research, creation of a 
regional management structure, and biodiversity mainstreaming in fisheries management. To enhance the 
sector’s potential, the Fisheries and Coastal Livelihood Project (FY14) aims to increase in a sustainable 
way the overall benefits generated by the exploitation of marine and coastal fisheries resources and the 
proportion of those benefits captured by Mozambique, and to insure a fairer distribution of the benefits 
both spatially and among economic agents (households, entrepreneurs, the state). The project will focus 
on (a) economic governance; (b) private sector development; (c) human and institutional capacity 
strengthening; and (d) global public goods management and regional fisheries collaboration.  

83. Reflecting the division of labor agreed to with development partners, the Bank will continue 
to focus on water supply and sanitation in urban areas though may respond to opportunities for 
support to small rural towns. The Water Sector and Institutional Support Project (WASIS) (FY08) has 
significantly increased water service coverage in the four major cities of Beira, Nampula, Quelimane, and 

35 

 
Pemba and helped establish an institutional and regulatory framework for smaller cities and towns . With 
additional financing (FY11), the project has expanded the scope to nine other provincial capital and 
tertiary cities. The planned Greater Maputo Water Supply Project (FY14) will provide similar investment 
and regulatory and institutional support to Maputo, which has seen its water supply services deteriorate, 
given the pressures of increased urbanization and spatial expansion . The future project is closely linked to 
and will follow the Water Resources Development Project (FY12), which will strengthen the management 
of national water resources and increase the yield from the Corumana Dam to augment water supply for 
the greater Maputo metropolitan area through 2020 and provide water to low-income, peri-urban areas not 
currently served.  Institutional and investment support to Maputo in the area of solid waste management 
will continue through the Maputo Municipal Development Program II (FY11). Looking forward, the 
Bank is in discussions with AusAID on further collaboration in supporting peri-urban sanitation in 
Maputo and other cities, and water supply improvements in secondary urban centers.  

84. The Bank will continue its support to improve the roads network to promote equitable access 
and broad-based growth. The CPS will encourage activities that clearly support growth sectors, such as 
agriculture feeder roads and roads that can link tourism sites to the markets . The Roads and Bridges 
Management and Maintenance Program II (FY08) along with the associated additional financing (FY11) 
looks to bridge the infrastructure gap in Mozambique, particularly for rural residents, through investments 
to repair and maintain sections of the main north-south highway.  The next phase of the project, to be 
supported by Roads and Bridges Management and Maintenance Program III (FY13) pending agreement 
with authorities, will complete the program of rehabilitating the entire length of the north-south highway, 
along with feeder roads to agricultural areas.  The next phase of the Transfrontier Conservation Area and 
Tourism Project (FY14) will improve road access within protected areas to bolster conservation and 
tourism efforts.  The Maputo Municipal Development Program II (FY11) supports rehabilitation of major 
municipal arteries, primary and secondary roads, as well as unpaved peri-urban roads in the greater 
Maputo municipal area.  Both programs support institutional capacity and strategic planning to encourage 
sustainable management of the roads infrastructure. 

85. Beyond the on-going and proposed projects noted above, the Bank is in early discussions with 
Government to look at ways to take a catalytic role in addressing infrastructure needs, especially 
those with regional scope and implications.  This includes a long-term strategic approach that would 
help Government prioritize infrastructure investments, a strategy to manage and finance the rehabilitation 
and operation of the railway sector, and key power transmission investments as a way to unlock the 
country’s vast water resources and hydropower potential.  The Spatial Development Planning TA Project 
(FY11) promises to provide a long-term roadmap for the best use of resources for infrastructure 
development.  The Bank looks to take on a convening role in crowding in financing from development 
partners and the private sector, leveraging limited IDA as well as exploring opportunities for IBRD 
enclave financing and partial risk guarantees.             

86. The Bank will continue its support to improve access to affordable telecommunications over 
the course of the CPS for FY12-15.  Through the Mozambique e-Government and Communications 
Infrastructure Project (MEGCIP) (FY09) the Bank will continue support that contributes to lower prices 
for international capacity and extends the geographic reach of broadband networks.  Affordable access to 
telecommunication services and to Internet services in particular is essential for improved access to 
information, for doing business, and to promote effective decentralization of services to the provinces.  

36 

 
Through MEGCIP, and as the recently attributed third mobile licensee starts operations, competition and 
affordability are expected to improve. The new entrant plans to build an extensive backbone network that 
would compete with Telecomunicações de Moçambique (TDM) network. Growing demand through 
additional use and development of applications, coupled with an appropriate regulatory framework, will 
also help the viability of the networks and eventuality of lower prices. As the infrastructure becomes 
available, government can deliver in a decentralized manner a wide range of applications in several 
sectors (e.g., education, health, public administration, etc). Development of services and e -Government 
applications as well as the underlying regulatory and physical framework to make it possible will 
contribute to improved efficiency and transparency in public service delivery. 

87. 
Improving access to and management of electricity and energy services will continue over the 
course of the CPS for FY12-15. The US$80 million Energy Development and Access Project (FY10) 
aims to reinforce the primary electricity network and extend the medium- and low-voltage grid in peri-
urban areas, with a target of connecting an additional 25,000 households , as well as health facilities and 
schools. It also seeks to accelerate access to off-grid electricity and modern energy services in 
underserved rural areas through renewable energy resources and technologies, primarily through solar 
photovoltaic systems. Separately, the planned Regional Transmission Development Program (FY13) 
supports an estimated US$2.5 billion transmission expansion program co-financed commercially and by 
other development partners. Its main objective is to support the development of a high-voltage 
transmission system in Mozambique by linking the central grid that extends from Tete Province to the 
southern grid in Maputo Province, and ultimately connecting to the South African Power Pool (SAPP) via 
Kwazulu-Natal. The key objectives for the program are to increase the provision of affordable energy 
services and efficiency to urban, peri-urban, and rural areas in Mozambique by evacuating power 
southwards from new generation capacity in Tete province; support regional economic development by 
supplying bulk power into the SAPP system; and support regional environmental sustainability by 
replacing thermal power generation based on coal with renewable hydropower. IFC and MIGA, together 
with IDA, have continued to support the oil and gas sectors through the Sasol Pipeline, a project 
consisting of an 865 kilometers of gas pipeline from the central processing facility in Mozambique to 
South Africa.  

88. Beyond expanded infrastructure and improved business environment, Mozambique’s 
competitiveness depends on a better-educated and appropriately skilled workforce. The Bank’s 
education portfolio contains significant depth and breadth, supporting efforts to better prepare the 
country’s workforce to contribute to sustained economic growth . The Education Sector Support Project 
(FY11) aims to improve access to and quality of primary and secondary education through teacher 
training, curriculum reform, distribution of school books , and supporting institution building to better 
manage the sector. The planned additional financing (FY12) will expand the scope of the project to 
include early childhood education while the additional financing to the Health Service Delivery Project 
(FY09) will include a nutrition component to address chronic malnutrition, thus enhancing learning 
ability and ultimate capacity of the population. The Higher Education, Science and Technology Project 
(FY10) seeks to increase the number and raise the quality of graduates at the undergraduate and graduate 
levels, and strengthen the national research capacities to produce research outputs of relevance to the 
country’s strategic economic sectors. The Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) 
Project (FY06) and associated additional financing (FY12) looks to improve the quality and 
responsiveness of the TVET system to labor market needs by providing training that is delivered in a 

37 

 
sustainable, integrated, effective, and equitable manner.  Other on-going operations also have activities 
that aim to enhance skills development. 

89. Bank support to the health sector will also contribute to a healthier and more productive 
workforce. The Health Commodity Security Project (FY11) aims to improve the availability of selected 
and drugs and supplies including ARVs to treat HIV/AIDS and ACTs to treat malaria, both diseases 
which take a heavy toll on the productivity of the workforce. The Health Service Delivery Project (FY09) 
also finances activities to reduce the burden of malnutrition in addition to HIV/AIDS and malaria.  The 
Health Care Financing AAA (FY13) will help provide options to improve productivity and sustainability 
of health services for the next ten years. 

90. The Government of Mozambique realizes the potential of its many natural endowments and 
its considerable development potential, as well as the need for proper planning and management . 
With help from the Bank through the Spatial Development Planning TA Project (FY11), the Government 
hopes to improve its national development planning with the introduction, institutionalization, and 
mainstreaming of multi-sector spatial development planning methodologies and practices. The planned 
Growth Poles Project (FY13) will build on this approach by supporting a critical mass of reforms, 
productive infrastructure investments, skills development, and other value-added activities around large 
anchor projects, normally mineral-based, that promote trade and investment-led growth and that are 
located along under-developed or developing corridors with high potential to link anchor projects to the 
local economy through densification (e.g., provision of feeder infrastructure to support smallholder 
agriculture producers) and deepening (e.g., forging backward and forward linkages with local 
enterprises).  

91. The size of recent discoveries of gas deposits presents a potential “game changer” for 
Mozambique’s development. The country has an historic opportunity to develop its domestic gas market 
in addition to export schemes and subsequently create value from its natural resources beyond revenues 
from export. The proposed Gas Master Plan, to be developed by the Government with support from the 
Bank, aims to identify policy options to maximize the monetary, social and environmental value of 
natural gas to Mozambique.  Value will arise from domestic access to secure and affordable energy, 
employment generation, reduction of fuel imports, economic diversification, community benefit sharing, 
sustainable development through corporate social and environmental responsibility mechanisms/models – 
all of which will be fundamental to inclusive growth. A significant challenge for the Government will be 
to develop institutional capacity: in this regard, the Bank is preparing a Mining and Gas Technical 
Assistance Project (FY13) to address identified policy and capacity gaps. The proposed project will 
support reforms, initiatives, and capacity building to enhance the efficiency and accountability of 
institutions involved in the management and planning of the mining and hydrocarbon sectors.   

(b) Pillar II. Vulnerability and Resilience 

92. 
In recent years, Mozambique has been buffeted by various shocks that have impacted the 
pace and level of its growth, poverty reduction, and social cohesion. As such, Pillar II is an integral 
part of the overall CPS goal of achieving inclusive and pro-poor growth. The deadly riots in 2008 and 
September 2010, sparked by rising food and fuel prices, underlined the extreme vulnerability of most 
Mozambicans to even the slightest rise in the cost of living — whether through a reduction in subsidies or 
to the Mozambican Metical depreciation against the South African Rand. The spike in the global price of 

38 

 
food in 2007 had a significant impact on household consumption, which is estimated to have decreased by 
more than seven percent.37 This is expected to have had a considerable impact on food insecurity for more 
than half of the population given the high proportion of household income consumed in food (more than 
65 percent in rural areas).38  Furthermore in 2009-10, the climatic phenomena El Niño produced a drought 
similar to those in 2002-03 and 2004-05, which affected food production and food access.39  The seasonal 
and unpredictable shocks suggest the need for permanent effective measures to mitigate future shocks and 
to address the high degree of vulnerability among a significant portion of the country’s population .  

93. The proposed program supported by Pillar II will address vulnerability in its various forms. 
Pillar II entails three main objectives: (a) effectively respond to macroeconomic and idiosyncratic shocks; 
(b) improve resilience to natural disasters and the impacts of climate change; and (c) strengthen social 
safety net for the most vulnerable people (Table 5).  The objectives of Pillar II will be supported by on-
going and new projects and analytic work, including those listed in Table 6.  

94. Macroeconomic shocks include those stemming from terms of trade. Mozambique (particularly 
urban inhabitants) is highly dependent on imported food from South Africa. In the 12 months preceding 
the riots, the Metical depreciated one-third against the US dollar and two-fifths against the South African 
Rand, exacerbating inflation triggered by rising food and fuel prices. Mozambique has established a 
strong track record of maintaining a stable macroeconomic framework ; and the World Bank, in close 
partnership with IMF, continues to monitor and advise on policy responses against this and other types of 
macroeconomic shocks. The PRSC series will continue to help fund the budget and maintain stability in 
the real economy. Past actions have helped to improve revenue mobilization and public expenditure 
management. More frequent country economic updates will also help ensure the Bank’s abil ity to 
participate in the dialogue on macroeconomic management.     

Table 5. Objectives and Expected Outcomes of Pillar II: Vulnerability and Resilience 

Objectives 
Effective response to idiosyncratic shocks 

 Improved health services for the vulnerable  

General Outcomes 

Mitigate the impacts of climate change and extreme 
weather events 
Reduce vulnerability to exogenous and endogenous 
shocks 

 Adaptation to climate change and reduced risk of natural 
disasters 

 Strengthened social protection 

95. There are multiple idiosyncratic shocks in the Mozambican context.  Food insecurity is at a 
very high level. Almost half of all children under-five are malnourished — a rate that has remained 
virtually unchanged since 2003 — and chronic under-nutrition accounts for at least one-third of child 
deaths. Malaria also poses a major public health problem, accounting for a large proportion of deaths 
among children under-five. It is also a contributing factor to at least 30 percent of maternal deaths . The 
incidence of tuberculosis (TB), at 431 per 100,000 is above the average incidence in Sub -Saharan Africa. 
Sixty-six percent of all diagnosed TB cases are co-infected with HIV, another significant health 
challenge. Fifteen percent of people between the ages of 15 and 49 are living with HIV/AIDS, the eighth

highest prevalence rate in the world and almost twice the Sub-Saharan average of 7.2 percent. In 2005, 
there were 123,000 AIDS-related deaths, and an estimated 1.6 million orphans.  

96. The CPS will help the Government address these health-related crises. The Bank is working 
with government and other partners to address key health system constraints. This includes policy 
dialogue on human resources, health financing and the supply chain. This is combined with focused 
project support. The Health Service Delivery Project (FY09) seeks to reduce maternal and child mortality, 
the burden of malaria and tuberculosis, and the inequity in service provision in three Northern provinces. 
The project supports rehabilitating and constructing health facilities, strengthening of the Government’s 
malaria control management program, and capacity building. Additional financing under preparation for 
FY13 will add a nutrition component, which will support interventions, such as Vitamin A distribution, 
salt iodization and food fortification. Community-based nutrition activities will also be supported, 
including the promotion of exclusive breastfeeding, education on safe water, hygiene, and sanitation. The 
ESW on health care financing will provide options for reducing the burden of poor health on the poor and 
limiting catastrophic expenditures that push people into poverty.  The Health Commodity Security Project 
(FY11) seeks to improve the availability of selected drugs and medical supplies for people living with 
HIV/AIDS, women seeking family planning and prenatal care, those needing vaccination against measles, 
and people living in malaria prone areas (i.e., those requiring insecticide-treated mosquito nets). Health 
has also been selected as a pilot for a new cross-sector program being developed to improve service 
delivery performance by strengthening economic governance and accountability. 

97. As noted earlier, Mozambique ranks third 
among the African countries most exposed to risks 
from multiple weather-related hazards. Major floods, 
cyclones, and droughts have a significant impact on the 
country's economy.  As much as 58 percent of the 
population and more than 37 percent of GDP are at risk 
from two or more hazards. Each major shock can reduce 
GDP growth on average by 5.6 percent. Observed trends 
and future scenarios suggest climate change will 
increase the extremity of weather patterns.

98. Under the proposed CPS, climate change 
mitigation and adaptation activities will be a new and 
important business line. Given the critical need for 
policy, regulatory, and institutional changes needed on 
climate change planning, a programmatic series of 
development policy operations (DPO) is planned during 
the CPS period. The objective of the proposed operations will be to support progress in achieving policy 
reforms necessary for mainstreaming climate change throughout the Government’s policymaking process 
and to ensure a coordinated approach that addresses the many parallel strategies and planning processes at 
different levels of government. Outputs would likely include a national climate change strategy; 
development of a national institutional framework; and sectoral strategies and action plans in selected 
sectors such as water, energy, forestry, social protection and health. Possible outcomes could include

those mapped to and mentioned under Pilar I. 

40 

 
progress in achieving lower carbon-intensity development and helping to ensure sustainable use and 
preservation of the country’s vast tracts of forests for carbon sequestration.  

99. The DPL-supported measures are intended to complement the portfolio of investment 
projects co-financed by the Pilot Program for Climate Resilience, one of the newly established 
Climate Investment Funds. The already mentioned National Water Resources Development Project 
(FY12) seeks to address water scarcity through enhanced water resources planning and capacity of the 
regional water authorities in the country’s river basins, including the Zambezi . It also aims to develop and 
implement mechanisms to facilitate comprehensive water allocation, licensing, revenue , and compliance 
with monitoring measures, in addition to rehabilitating the hydrometric network in the Zambezi Valley. 
The third phase of the Roads and Bridges Management and Maintenance Project, which is under 
discussion for FY13, will pilot appropriate and cost-effective engineering and adaptive maintenance 
approaches on 1,000 kilometers of rural roads in the Zambezi Valley and develop an innovative rapid 
response mechanism to road ruptures and bridge washouts. Another investment project, the Cities and 
Climate Change Project (FY12) looks to improve municipal management and sustainable financing 
approaches to enhance climate resilience in Maputo, Beira, Nacala, and Pemba, the coastal urban areas 
that account for a significant share of the country’s GDP . In Beira, for example, heavy rainfall and higher 
sea tides have already destroyed parts of the existing coastal protection infrastructure, leaving the interior 
parts of the city vulnerable to flooding. Beira is also prone to cholera outbreaks, which are aggravated 
during flood-related events. The project will support the city’s adaptation deficit in infrastructure 
investments by improving drainage, coastal protection, and strengthening the municipal sanitation agency. 
The on-going Health Services Delivery Project (FY09) can also integrate climate resilience measures in 
Nampula, which is in one of the three provinces targeted by the project . More recently, Mozambique has 
prepared a Disaster Risk Management Plan (FY11) aimed at building policy, strategies, and institutions; 
identifying, assessing, and monitoring risks; and reducing underlying risk factors. The implementation of 
the plan is being supported by the Global Facility for Disaster Risk Reduction (GFDRR).         

100. Two IFC Programs will support climate resilience in the private sector.  IFC will implement 
the private sector components of the PPCR under the Building Africa’s Resilience to Climate Change 
(BAREC), a pre-pipeline advisory services program.  The program will channel $10 million in PPCR 
funding to catalyze private sector investments that result in climate resilience across all economic sectors, 
with a focus on agriculture and forestry.  At least one component will be implemented through 
commercial banks to target small-scale projects.  The IFC Mozambique Forestry program will provide 
advisory services to develop sustainable private forestry investments, with a focus on maintaining and/or 
expanding forest cover while generating economic returns.  The program will focus on expanding 
productive livelihoods for communities adjacent to productive forests, as well as taking advantage of 
potential carbon offsets or other means of monetizing the forest’s carbon sequestration contribution.               

101. The high degree of vulnerability to macroeconomic and idiosyncratic shocks, as well as 
natural disasters, underlines the need for a comprehensive social protection system. Despite still low 
coverage, Mozambique has developed some social safety-net programs. Social insurance only covers 
seven percent of households, comprising public servants and other formal workers. Other social 
assistance programs, including cash transfers to the elderly, disabled, and chronically ill, and in-kind 
transfers for indigent populations, have limited coverage and low-budget allocation. Within this context, 
the Bank is supporting implementation of the Government’s Productive Social Action Strategy through a 

41 

 
pilot project of labor-intensive public works to provide temporary income generation . The Bank’s 2008 
Poverty Assessment shows that a labor-intensive public works program is an adequate short-term measure 
to address immediate needs of highly vulnerable households. The Developing the Building Blocks for 
Effective Crisis Response: Piloting a Public Works Program (FY11), funded by the Rapid Social 
Response Multi-Donor Trust Fund, is expected to improve the design and implement the first phase of a 
public works program; concurrently, the program supports developing tools, methods, and processes to 
reach the poorest more efficiently; formulating and implementing appropriate interventions; and 
monitoring safety net programs to inform decision-making. To complement the current social safety-net 
assessment, discussions with authorities are considering the additional analysis needed to support 
development and testing of targeting mechanisms. The pilot project, underpinned by on-going and 
planned analytic work on targeting systems, will act as an entry point to a much more comprehensive 
engagement by the Bank in social protection, culminating in a Social Protection Project (FY13) which 
will  support government in consolidating and making operational a social safety net system (as opposed 
to a collection of programs) to protect the poorest and most vulnerable from chronic poverty and seasonal 
and unpredictable shocks, and support the implementation of the productive social action strategy 
(possible through a cash-for-work intervention in urban and rural areas).   

102. The conservation of natural ecosystems and biodiversity are the building blocks toward 
better resilience to natural disasters and livelihood vulnerability . The on-going Transfrontier 
Conservation Areas and Tourism Development Project II (FY06), which is co-financed by the Global 
Environment Facility (GEF) with the Bank, has contributed to building the country's capacity to manage 
biodiversity in protected areas, in particular by supporting national reforms and on -the-ground investment 
in five protected areas. The follow-on project under preparation, Transfrontier Conservation Areas and 
Tourism Development Project III (FY14), also to be co-financed with GEF, looks to scale up the 
partnership with local communities and to further improve biodiversity management capacity . These 
national parks represent valuable tourism assets, but they deserve attention for their global value as well 
as for many other ecosystem services. Mozambique contains a wide diversity of habitats , including 
mountainous, woodland, wetland, and coastal/marine ecosystems. These large areas are important for 
their richness of biodiversity and because they contain topographic and ecological gradients and transition 
zones, and historical corridors for large-scale animal movements, which will become increasingly 
important with habitat modification due to climate changes. Increasingly, the ecosystem services provided 
by these protected areas are valued as buffer to land degradation and disasters such as flood or drought. 
They are also ―insurances‖ for the most vulnerable livelihood in rural areas by providing an array of wild 
resources ranging from energy, meat protein, construction material , and medicinal plants.  

(c) Governance and Public Sector Capacity: The Foundation 

103. Weak governance and public sector capacity underlie Mozambique’s myriad development 
challenges. All activities discussed under Pillars I and II require a strengthened public sector capacity and 
improved governance deciding on the most effective way to mitigate high international food and fuel 
prices; channeling benefits of mineral wealth to ease people out of poverty; lifting legal and regulatory 
constraints to access finance; planning and implementing integrated spatial development along growth 
corridors; and bridging urban-rural disparities in service delivery. Every Bank project includes activities 
that enhance the Government’s ability to develop strategies, plan, budget, manage, implement, and 
monitor. Institution building is fully mainstreamed throughout the portfolio.  And as the consultations for 

42 

 
the Africa Regional Strategy conveyed clearly, ―governance and leadership were the most important 
factors driving Africa’s future development.‖  And just like the Africa Regional Strategy, the 
Mozambique CPS considers this the ―foundation‖ upon which the pillars, in fact, the entire Bank 
program, rests.  And while every product and service undertaken during the CPS period can be ―mapped‖ 
to Governance and Public Sector Capacity, this Foundation has specific objectives, projects and analytic 
work in the area of economic governance, social accountability, and natural resources management (see 
Tables 7 and 8).        

104. Beyond institutional capacity components in its projects, the Bank is supporting greater 
transparency and accountability primarily through reforms in public financial management. The 
PRSC series in particular will continue to support reforms to improve financial management and 
procurement while possibly broadening its scope to better respond in a timely way to other likely 
changing realities on the ground over the CPS period .  A challenge is to broaden and deepen these 
reforms to decentralized levels as well as in sector ministries at the central level. Given the 
decentralization process and the deconcentration of functions, including the provision of service delivery, 
to the provincial and district levels, two on-going programs are supporting the former. The Maputo 
Municipal Development Program II (FY11) is building on the successful implementation of the first 
phase and aims to continue efforts to strengthen the capacity of the Maputo City Council to plan, finance, 
manage, and maintain urban services and infrastructure. Similarly, the municipal strengthening 
component of the Coastal Cities and Climate Change Project (FY12) will support 19 municipalities in 
the central and southern regions of the country in the areas of financial management and 
urban/environmental planning. The project will continue the long-term engagement of the Bank in the 
area of municipal development and will bring additional resources to strengthen both the municipal and 
relevant sectoral agencies. The National Decentralized Planning and Finance Project (FY10) is the 
Bank’s contribution to a common fund that aims to improve the capacity of local government to manage 
public financial resources for district development and to better integrate district planning and budgeting 
into the national systems. The project seeks to achieve this objective through technical assistance and 
capacity building, and institutionalization and mainstreaming of best practices in all districts of the 10 
provinces.  The public expenditure reviews and health financing study will also provide information to 
help improve inefficient public spending in human development.     

Table 7. Objectives and Expected Outcomes of Governance and Public Sector Capacity

General Outcomes 

Improved economic governance and policy making

Enhanced social accountability mechanisms 

 Improved citizen participation in public service monitoring 

Strengthened non-renewable, renewable natural 
resources and environmental management 

 Greater contribution of wildlife conservation to economy 
 Improved transparency in extractive industries 

105. The objective of the Economic Governance Project (FY13) will be to lift key procurement, 
public financial management, human resources, and monitoring and evaluation bottlenecks to 
service delivery in selected sectors. The action to take is narrowing the gap between PFM and 
procurement policy, rules and systems, and their actual implementation. Service delivery sectors will be 

43 

 
used as entry points to narrow the gap between PFM and procurement reforms and their implementation. 
A Program-for-Results component may be used to provide incentives for the development of common 
solutions to service delivery problems identified in the key sectors targeted (health, education, justice , and 
agriculture). A PFM and procurement technical assistance component will complement the Program-for-
Results component. The technical assistance component will aim to address the critical PFM, 
procurement, human resource issues; but it would do so by focusing the attention of the au thorities on the 
―softer‖ aspects of the implementation of these reforms, such as change management and communication, 
and by encouraging them to identify the real nature of the issues and the level of local capacity rather than 
jumping on good practice for ready-made solutions. The technical assistance component would also 
include a knowledge window that aims to gather analytical evidence on the causes of poor service 
delivery. In light of the governance environment in Mozambique, it would also put a strong emphasis on 
social accountability mechanisms in order to increase the demand for better public services and leverage 
the ―short route‖ to accountability.

106. Another challenge is to stimulate the demand 
for good governance by 
increasing citizen 
participation in the monitoring of public services 
and the effective use of public resources. The 
Maputo Municipal Development Program II (FY11) is 
the only program that includes social accountability 
activities, including citizen surveys, municipal report 
cards, citizen access to municipal information, and 
participation in municipal affairs. The aim is to bring 
service delivery closer to end-users and to encourage 
greater voice and participation as a way of demanding 
better-quality provision of public services. Under the 
CPS FY12-15, the Bank will look at ways to 
mainstream social accountability and public voice 
either as integral components of projects or as complementary activities, building on lesson s learned from 
on-going work by civil society groups and in partnership with them and other development partners 
similarly interested in building social accountability measures in their respective programs.

107. One area of governance that has grown in importance in recent years is the Extractive 
Industry Transparency Initiative (EITI). The Government has made a strong commitment to develop its 
natural resources in line with global best practice guided by transparency principles. Mozambique is 
currently an EITI-candidate country. The Bank has been working with other development partners to 
support the Government in this process. During the CPS FY12-15 period, the Bank through a Mining and 
Gas TA Project (FY13) will continue to help improve the legal, fiscal, and regulatory frameworks; create 
provisions to facilitate adequate contribution of the sector to economic development and regional levels ; 
and improve extractive industries sector transparency and build capacity for sector revenue estimation and 
collection, and revenue management.     

108. Over the last 15 years, the World Bank has supported the Statistical Office of Mozambique 
(INE). Bank support has focused particularly in the collection and analysis of micro data.  Recent 
achievements include the new Atlas of Mozambique, an important analytical tool based on the 2007 

44 

 
census and 2008/2009 household survey that maps the socio-economic characteristics of the country and 
compares them with 1997 census and survey findings.  Despite solid collaboration, there is scope for a 
stronger partnership. INE still needs support to develop a coherent long-term plan of work as well as to 
improve its technical capacities. As shown by the last household survey (2008-09), a number of 
weaknesses still affect INE in various areas, from the design of questionnaires, to the collection of data , 
and finally to the early stages of data analysis. In this regard, the Bank plans to avail itself as needed for 
the next household survey, tentatively scheduled for 2014.  Bank support to INE would complement the 
support provided by the Norwegian, Swedish, and Danish aid agencies through the Scanstat program 
which looks to improve institutional capacity, general statistics, census taking, and surveys. 

III.  IMPLEMENTING THE COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY  

A. Resources to Implement the Strategy 

109. The CPS covers the three years of IDA 16 (FY12-14) and the first year of IDA 17 (FY15). The 
CPS operational program was calibrated based on an assumption of annual IDA-16 lending envelopes in 
the order of US$346 million for a total notional IDA allocation of US$1.04 billion.  Actual allocations 
will depend on (a) the country’s own performance; (b) its performance relative to other IDA recipients; 
(c) the amount of overall resources available to IDA; (d) changes in the list of active IDA -eligible 
countries; and (e) terms of financial assistance provided (grants or loans); (f) the amount of compensatory 
resources received for MDRI; and (g) availability of IDA resources that could be reallocated. 
Mozambique may also avail of IBRD financing for enclave projects in the energy, transport, logistics, and 
minerals and gas sectors. 

110. In keeping with the African Regional Strategy, the Bank will continue to leverage IDA 
resources to mobilize external financing and to ensure a greater concentration of resources to 
address key challenges.  The Mozambique program has already demonstrated a good track record of 
leveraging external financing in the form of donor trust funds, with US$149 million in trust fund 
resources activated during the previous CPS period (FY08-11).  Total active trust fund resources as of 
end-FY11 stood at US$216 million in the form of co-financing or as stand-alone arrangements. In 
addition, two active projects, the National Decentralization Planning and Finance SIL (FY10) and the 
Education Sector Support Project (FY11) with a combined commitment of US$100 million are part of a 
basket funding arrangement with non-Bank donor resources estimated at about US$360 million.  The 
Bank is also one of 19 budget support donors that provided US$471 million in 2011 (the Bank’s 
contribution was US$85 million).  Many other active projects are part of broader programs of coordinated 
support where other donors and the Government alike fund related activities.  

111. In regard to human resources, the Bank will maintain a decentralized and high-capacity 
Mozambique country office.  Of the 19 active IDA projects currently in the portfolio, 14 are managed 
by task team leaders based in the country office.  Another two are based in neighboring countries, while 
three are based in Washington.  There has been good progress over the years to provide local senior staff 
with task management experience in other, mostly Lusophone countries.  The Bank office in Maputo 
includes a Country Director, the Lead Economist, and Sector Leaders for Sustainable Development , 
PREM, and Human Development.  Senior fiduciary staff covering financial management, procurement, 
and social / environmental safeguards are also based in the country office.  The IFC office is headed by a 

45 

 
resident Country Manager, with 8 professional investment and advisory staff.  In total, the country office 
comprises 75 staff and consultants (including IFC), of which 27 (or 36 percent) are internationally 
recruited.   

B. Partnerships and Donor Coordination 

112. The Africa Regional Strategy emphasizes the importance of partnerships as the foremost 
important instrument to implement country strategies.  Indeed, the Mozambique country program 
views partnerships – with Government, development partners, the private sector, and local institutions – 
as an indispensable aspect of our work.  Partnerships entail close operational coordination with 
development partners, leveraging IDA resources to mobilize external financing, and taking a catalytic and 
convening role to mobilize the attention, resources, and technical skills of others.  The Bank’s current and 
proposed work program provides many examples of such partnerships:  

 Leveraging external resources: the Bank’s active TF portfolio is about $200 million and 
complements an IDA portfolio of about $1 billion in net commitments. 

 Budget support: the Bank closely coordinates its budget support operations with 19 other donors, 
ensuring a coordinated dialogue on key policy issues.  In FY11, the Bank disbursed $85 million 
out of a total $450 million in donor budget support.  

 Basket funding arrangements: currently, the Bank is providing a combined commitment of $100 
million to support basket funding arrangements in decentralization and education with other 
donor resources estimated at about $360 million. 

 Program coordination: the Bank and other donors have formal geographic divisions of 
responsibilities to support Government programs in roads, agriculture, and water. 

 Catalytic role: the Bank has played a catalytic role in the planned Regional Transmission 
Development Project (FY13), providing $150 million in total IDA resources to crowd in 
approximately $1 billion from private sector and development partners. 

 Convening power:  over the past two years, the Bank has organized (with financing support by 
donors) flagship workshops with top Government policy makers on growth, inviting speakers 
from around the globe to discuss various growth strategies, models, and lessons learned.   

 WBG partnerships: the Bank’s program in Mozambique benefits from extensive collaboration 
across the WBG, with strong synergies with IFC and MIGA programs to strengthen the 
investment climate, infrastructure provision, agribusiness, SMEs, tourism, energy, and even 
climate change resiliency.  The Mozambique program is facilitating joint work between DEC 
and the Prime Minister’s office on growth and employment creation.  Collaboration with WBI 
will be strengthened over the next four years: beyond current joint work on urban management, 
WBI will help strengthen the Government’s capacity for communication dissemination. 

 Knowledge generation: the Bank is in the works to set up a TF with DFID to finance analytic 
work on growth and economic governance.  A key aspect of the TF entails efforts to collaborate 
and forge closer relationships with local think tanks and academic institutions.  WBI will assist 
in improving capacity of these institutions.  

113. Donor aid coordination in Mozambique is highly structured and to a large degree, facilitates 
strong partnerships across the range of development actors.  The Bank, together with the UN, co-

46 

 
chair the Development Partners Group (DPG) which is a forum for substantive discussions among 
development partners and coordination among numerous donor programs and project activities.  
Quarterly ―extended‖ DPG meetings include presentations on inclusive growth, rural development, 
climate change adaptation, management of agricultural land, social protection, and post-disaster response.  
They have also drawn high level government participation and serves as an informal forum to exchange 
ideas on key development challenges. 

114. Donor budget support is coordinated through the Group of 19 donors (G19), including the 
World Bank.  The group is chaired on a rotation basis with Canada currently chairing.  The 
Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed in March 2009 between the Government and the G19 is 
based on a set of ―fundamental principles‖: (a) predictability and alignment with domestic systems; (b) 
monitoring has to be done jointly and all policy actions or expected outcomes in the program have to be 
based on the common Performance Assessment Framework (PAF); (c) no separate reporting to the donors 
is required; and (d) mutual accountability is a primary factor to be included.40   

115. The G19 system has brought substantial benefits in terms of streamlining and harmonizing 
the donor dialogue with the Government. And while there is scope for introducing greater flexibility in 
the G19 processes and systems, the past year has seen some significant changes.  Budget support 
decisions were previously based on policy actions or outcomes introduced in the PAF matrix three years 
prior.  Starting in 2012 and reflecting the newly introduced concept of a ―dynamic PARP‖, such decisions 
will be based on indicators agreed to from the previous year and allows the Government to adjust 
priorities and targets in light of changing economic and social conditions, or changing priorities and 
strategic orientation.  Hence the PAF could be modified to take into account analytic work or new sector 
strategies, such as the Strategic Plan for Agricultural Development, the Financial Sector Development 
Strategy, and the Strategy for the Improvement of the Business Environment.  Still, greater flexibility 
could allow indicator-based disbursement brought forth in real-time and reflecting changing conditions 
(e.g., external shocks) or new government priorities.  Second, there could be a better balance in the PAF 
between outcome indicators and policy reform actions. The PAF is heavily skewed toward the former. 
This is a challenge for the preparation of PRSCs since Bank policy requires that DPL operations should 
disburse against the completion of policy and institutional actions.  

116. The donor harmonization system in Mozambique could be strengthened further by 
consolidating the policy dialogue in a smaller number of working groups, which would lead to 
improved prioritization and efficiency.  Implementation of the PARP will be monitored through sector 
working groups with indicators included in the PAF assessed during the Annual Review typically 
scheduled in April. This work is complemented by September Planning Meetings to agree on the 
indicators and triggers for the following year. The sector working groups can be good vehicles for policy 
dialogue, donor harmonization, and for reaching agreement between the Government and all the donors 
involved in a specific sector. At present, this donor coordination system is organized around 29 main 
sector working groups, which involve government participation and 43 additional donor-only subgroups. 
An unintended consequence of this large number of groups is that the policy dialogue tends to be 
excessively fragmented, focusing too narrowly on specific issues discussed across many different 

40 See www.pap.org.mz for details and a copy of the MoU.  

47 

 
                                                            
 
meetings. This makes prioritization and dialogue difficult — while imposing a heavy burden on the time 
commitments of all involved.  Annexes 12 and 13 provide a summary of donor support by sector.  

C. The Bank Portfolio Performance 

117. Over the course of the CPS FY08-11 period, the Bank delivered its largest program for 
Mozambique (Figure 5).  The Board approved US$1,016 million in IDA for 17 new lending projects and 
three additional financing projects. New deliverables accelerated in the last year of IDA 15 in FY11 as 
seven new projects were approved. Record lending has resulted in a fairly large active portfolio 
comprised of 19 IDA projects and a net commitment amount of US$976.1 million.  However, despite the 
growth of the portfolio, the average project size has remained constant, averaging US$46.6 million, below 
the Africa Region’s average of US$73.6 million (Figure 6).  This has led to fragmentation of the portfolio 
that will need to be remedied through preparation of umbrella projects that are likely to be programmatic, 
multi-sectoral, and is of sufficiently large scale to maximize development impact. 

   Figure 5.  IDA Commitments and Projects 

Figure 6.  Average Size of New IDA Projects 

118. As agreed to with Government, Country Portfolio Performance Reviews (CPPRs) take place 
twice a year.  The focus on the CPPR alternates between (1) a focused discussion on specific projects and 
issues impeding smooth implementation and disbursement ; and (2) a broader discussion of systemic and 
institutional issues that affect the entire portfolio, including those of other donors .  An example of the 
latter included the challenges the Bank and other donors experience using country systems, given the on-
going transition to newly automated financial management systems and procurement and audit 
procedures.  Moving forward, greater effort will be made to incorporate into the CPPR exercise a greater 
results orientation to keep track of progress toward achieving key program outcomes.    

IV.  RISKS AND MITIGATION 

119. 
 Reduced donor assistance.  As one of the largest recipients, Mozambique is heavily dependent on 
donor assistance, which is estimated at about 20 percent of GDP.   Donor budget support comprises about 
40 percent of the Government’s budget. However, economic difficulties in donor countries may lead to 
less predictable aid and other financial inflows. In anticipation of such reductions, the Government is in 
discussion with the Bank about possibly raising the level of budget support. Such potential increases 
would likely need to correspond to an acceleration of reforms, particularly to the overall business climate 
and to constraints in key sectors. In such a tightening environment challenges of donor coordination are 
likely to intensify.  In addition,  given the desire to develop its energy and natural resource industries , the 

48 

 
 
 
Government may also look at IBRD enclave financing, as well as IFC and MIGA products and services. 
Bank and other donor policy dialogue will continue to underline the need to continue improving on 
revenue generation and collection, and to allocate meager budgets to a few strategically targeted 
programs, reforms, and industries that have the potential to compete and provide a source of revenue 
needed for development spending. 

120. External shocks.  There are risks related to the potential for macroeconomic shocks and their 
impact on the implementation and achievements of the government reform program.  The current 
deterioration and high uncertainty of the global economy brings with it risks of deteriorating terms of 
trade, reduction of FDI, and potential reductions in donor disbursements, especially through budget 
support.  As for mitigation measures, the Government is following the course that helped them manage 
the 2008-09 crisis by maintaining a high level of reserves, a flexible exchange rate regime, and keeping 
low external debt vulnerability.  Additionally, Mozambique has a stable relationship with the IMF, 
anchored on a Policy Support Instrument (PSI), which has contributed to solid macroeconomic 
management.  The elaboration of the new PARP contributed to deepening the communication and to 
address differences of views that could have lead to reduced donor support.  Over the long run, 
Government is keen to continue to build its own revenue base to gradually reduce dependency of foreign 
aid.  While the risk of macroeconomic shocks affecting the reform program is moderate, it requires 
constant attention to changing circumstances. 

121. Slowing pace of reform.  The drop in Mozambique’s ranking in the 2011 Doing Business report 
reflects both accelerated reforms in other countries, but also a much slower pace of reform in 
Mozambique over the past year.41  If this is an indicator of a broader trend, the ability of Mozambique to 
foster a vibrant private sector will be greatly impaired and may trigger the reduction of donor aid.  The 
Government is working closely with the donor community and private sector groups to update its set of 
priority business climate reforms, a complement to the PARP that will provide a blueprint for discussion 
on private sector development.  

122. Capacity constraints and weak client coordination. Notwithstanding significant progress over 
the past two decades, a deep-seated and persistent challenge for Mozambique will be its still largely 
fragile capacity, especially at  technical levels across the board.  In the important agricultural sector for 
example, with an irrigation project recently achieving effectiveness, a regional agriculture productivity 
project under preparation, and an Agriculture DPO in the pipeline, the agriculture sector is receiving 
appropriate emphasis in the CPS for FY12-15 as an engine of economic growth and poverty reduction. 
However, given capacity constraints at the Ministry of Agriculture, the Bank will have to closely monitor 
on-going activities, including technical assistance and institutional capacity development. The Bank is 
also looking at alternative ministries for future projects, e.g., housing the Agriculture DPO under the 
Ministry of Planning and Development (MPD).  Relatedly, the slew of multisector projects – including 
the Growth Poles Development, Economic Governance, and Climate Change DPO – will test the 
Government’s ability to coordinate across ministries and agencies. The Bank will work closely with the 
Ministry of Planning and Development, as well as the Prime Minister’s office, to ensure such high-profile 
projects receive the appropriate level of coordination required for implementation.

123. Management of extractive industries.  The Government at the highest levels has expressed 
concern over the ability to manage the burgeoning mining and gas sectors and the entry of large 
multinational firms looking to negotiate and sign contracts .  Given the potential ―game changer‖ that 
these sectors represent, the Government aims to maximize the benefits to the country, particularly in 
terms of revenue sharing. Negotiating deals of this magnitude requires international and sectoral expertise 
that the Government currently lacks. The Bank Group as a whole, building on on-going mining and gas 
policy dialogue and advice, as well as positive experience with EITI-related work, is inter alia preparing a 
TA project to address identified policy and capacity gaps. The proposed project will support reforms, 
initiatives, and capacity building to enhance the efficiency and accountabil ity of institutions involved in 
the management and planning of the mining and hydrocarbon sectors. 

124. Possible elevation of social tensions.  Recent global events have shown that no government is 
immune to social unrest stemming from a lack of economic opportunities and unresponsive governance.  
The related events of 2008 and 2010 were perhaps wake-up calls for Government to do more to address a 
slowing pace of poverty reduction, create employment and improve livelihoods, and to provide a 
minimum level of social protection for vulnerable populations.  The CPS for FY12-15 supports these 
efforts.  In addition, by integrating social accountability mechanisms throughout its program, the Bank 
hopes to give rise to citizens’ voices and increase participation as a means to improve accountability and 
delivery of public goods and services.

I. INTRODUCTION  

1. 
The Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) Completion Report assesses the World Bank Group’s assistance 
to Mozambique during the FY08-11 period as guided by the Mozambique CPS (Report No. 39395-MZ). It reviews 
the support provided to Mozambique through a mix of investment instruments, partnerships and knowledge 
products and assesses (i) the program performance in influencing the CPS outcomes as laid out in the CPS results 
matrix and (ii) the World Bank Group’s performance with regard to relevance, design and management of the 
strategy. The last chapter summarizes lessons drawn from this assessment which should feed into the design of 
the follow-up Country Assistance Strategy (CAS). 

2. 
Overall, this report concludes that the Bank’s program performance is considered to be only Moderately 
Satisfactory for the FY08-FY11 CPS. Although the Bank’s program over the CPS period was relevant, adequately 
designed, responsive to Government requests, integrated with the overall development partner harmonization 
agenda, and the anticipated portfolio was successfully delivered (even surpassing its foreseen scope in terms of 
lending and grant amounts), there were some slippages in the portfolio. While most of the results were 
achieved as outlined in the CPS results framework and good progress was made in other areas , the results 
achieve were uneven across the portfolio and the results matrix was never updated, rendering some outcomes 
unobservable. A detailed assessment of achievements against outcomes as measured by indicators in the CPS 
results framework is presented in Table 1 in the Annex.   

3. 
Thus, despite the impressive delivery of a much larger lending program than anticipated and 
maintaining an overall effective and well performing portfolio for most of CPS period as well as delivering a 
number of high-quality and timely knowledge products, the Bank’s performance is assessed only moderately 
satisfactory, mainly due to the: (i) failure of undertaking a CPS progress report causing a number of stale CPS 
outcomes, (ii) slippages in the portfolio leading to delays in results delivery and the (iii) deterioration of portfolio 
performance towards the end of the CPS implementation period.  Table 2 and 3 of the Annex present the 
detailed listing of newly committed lending and major grants over the CPS period.  

4. 
The details of the CPS Completion Report as presented in the following reflect a comprehensive self -
evaluation undertaken by the country team, in which actual achievements were evaluated against outcomes 
defined in the CPS results matrix. The assessment is based on several sources, such as project specific data from 
ISRs and ICRs, portfolio data from institutional systems, as well as economic and sectoral assessments and 
interviews with Bank staff. Finally, the report included consultations with development partners and key 
ministerial and project counterparts.      

A. Progress Towards Mozambique’s Long Term Objectives over the CPS Period 

5. 
Premised on macroeconomic stability and improved public financial management, the overarching goal 
of Mozambique’s 2006-10 Poverty Reduction Strategy, the PARPA II, was the reduction of poverty through 
sustainable and inclusive growth. In addition to eight cross-cutting topics highlighting key development 
priorities, the PARPA II is organized around three pillars: Governance, Human Capital, and Economic 
Development.     

59 

 
 
 
6. 
At the beginning of the CPS period Mozambique had posted a strong 8 percent average GDP growth rate 
for a number of years, making it one of Africa’s best-performing economies. Together with sustained political 
stability after a two-decade long civil war, the country was able to attract substantial development partner 
support. Mozambique was also able cope relatively well with the global food, fuel, and financial crises and 
consequent global economic slowdown. The Government has repeatedly addressed external shocks with rapid 
and flexible policy responses, seeking IMF resources to maintain prudent levels of reserves while allowing the 
exchange rate to depreciate gradually. As a result, economic growth continued to be strong: real GDP growth 
dipped slightly from 6.7 percent in 2008 to 6.4 percent in 2009, and is expected to post at 6.5 percent in 2010. 
According to the latest IMF Article IV Consultations, Mozambique’s medium-term outlook remains favorable and 
economic growth is projected to accelerate to 7¼ percent in 2011 and close to 8 percent over the medium term.   

7. 
After significant strides in poverty reduction between 1996 and 2002/3, the results of the 2008-09 
household survey suggest that overall poverty reduction has leveled off at roughly 55 percent of the population. 
Notwithstanding concerns about the reliability of national poverty data, the results also indicate that urban 
poverty continued to decline but at a much slower rate, reaching 50 percent, while rural poverty actually 
increased slightly to 57 percent. These decelerating pace of poverty reduction point to structural deficiencies, 
weaknesses in the Government’s growth strategy, and the narrow productive base of the economy which leaves 
significant challenges to be addressed.  

8. 
The agriculture sector, while contributing 24 percent of GDP and employing 78 percent of the country’s 
workforce, has witnessed private sector investments in specific subsectors in response to existing market 
opportunities but continues to consist largely of subsistence farming in which 85 percent of rural households are 
engaged. The manufacturing sector, accounting for 13 percent of GDP, is led by a few capital intensive mega-
project investments, most notably aluminum smeltering, that represents 62 percent of the production value of 
the entire sector but only about 3 percent of the sector’s employment.  Meanwhile, reforms to the business 
climate have been slow, particularly in accessing finance which continues to impede the competitiveness of the 
vast majority of firms, primarily small and medium enterprises (SMEs) which mostly compete in the local 
market.     

9. 
Despite concerns with the Government’s current growth strategy, substantial improvements in the 
provision of public goods were recorded, particularly in transport infrastructure, electricity, urban and rural 
water, and telecommunications. Entrepreneurs, for example, are now less worried with energy provision, than 
they were in 2003 according to the 2009 Investment Climate Assessment. Also Mozambique’s business 
environment has shown some improvements. The 2011 Doing Business survey indicates an improved overall 
ranking in terms of the ease of doing business, with progress on legal reforms, simplified licensing procedures, 
and protecting investors, ranking Mozambique as number 140 in 2009 and 135 in the 2010 Doing Business 
Reports. Nevertheless registering property, dealing with construction permits, access to credit, paying taxes, 
trading across borders, enforcing contracts, and closing a business are all areas where progress has lagged.     

10. Weak governance structures remain a challenge for Mozambique’s business climate. The World Bank’s 
Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGI) note improvements since 2004 across five indicators, most prominently 
that for political stability but also those measuring government effectiveness, regulatory quality, rule of law, and 
control of corruption, but with the exception of political stability, all other indicators for Mozambique in the 
2009 assessment fall below the 50th percentile. On voice and accountability, Mozambique’s percentile showed a 

60 

 
 
modest slippage. Corruption consistently ranked among the top constraints to businesses, particularly among 
SMEs, and irregular payments with respect to customs, taxes, licenses, regulations, and services add up to 
significant costs. Perceptions of corruption have remained steady according to Transparency International’s 
Corruption Perception Index which shows Mozambique’s ranking remaining relatively stable, from 111 out of 
179 countries in 2007 to 116 out of 178 countries in 2010.  And while there has been stepped up efforts by the 
development partner community to engage civil society organizations and to increase voice and participation, 
tangible results beyond the demonstration effects of development partner projects have been slow to 
materialize. The progress made towards a comprehensive decentralization policy and intergovernmental fiscal 
framework has been substantial in the past decade, significant gaps still exist particularly in the area of 
intergovernmental fiscal systems and municipal finance. One area that has shown significant progress has been 
the introduction of investment budgets for districts and the transfer of human resource management to the 
district level, as well as the creation of local councils, all contribution to citizens’ voice and accountability. 

11. 
Mozambique’s social indicators and its progress toward the MDGs have shown good results, however, 
based on the results of the recent household survey, the country needs to accelerate efforts to reduce poverty to 
achieve this goal by 2015. Expenditures on PARPA priority sectors have been maintained at about 65 percent of 
total expenditures since 2004 and public services have improved over the past decade. However, social progress 
is uneven and the richest have benefited most in electricity, health, and secondary education, while primary 
education has particularly benefited the poor. The MDG for sustainable coverage for water supply could be met 
given the rapid improvements in the provision of urban water supply, while access in rural areas continues to lag 
and the MDG sanitation targets are very unlikely to be met, especially in peri-urban areas. While there has also 
been substantial progress in gender equality and women’s empowerment, reduction of child mortality and 
improving maternal health, as well as immunizations, exclusive breastfeeding, and supervised deliveries, the 
country’s health status indicators continue to be below the Sub-Saharan Africa average.  

12. 
Mozambique still has the lowest ratio of health providers per population in Southern Africa, and 
HIV/AIDS continues to pose serious long-term challenges, despite significant progress in the access to Anti-
Retroviral treatment (ART) throughout the country over the CPS period. A 2009 national survey estimates the 
HIV prevalence rate among the adult general population at 11.5 percent. The epidemic seems to be leveling-off 
notwithstanding the increasing trend of HIV prevalence observed in the southern region, particularly in Maputo 
where the prevalence rate is estimated at about 20 percent.   

II. CPS PROGRAM PERFORMANCE 

B. Program Overview and Principles of Engagement 

13. 
The Bank program in Mozambique was predominantly delivered in the form of investment loans and 
grants and a PRSC series for general budget support in the overall amount of US$ 1,047 million including 
regional operations and additional financings. Out of these, US$ 345 million were committed for the PRSC series 
over the four year program. The lending portfolio was complemented by a considerable and growing Trust Fund 
program. Over the CPS period an overall of US$ 252.4 million in Trust Funds were signed, with the Education For 
All Catalytic Trust Fund taking the lion share of US$ 79 million signed in FY 09 and US$ 90 million signed in FY11. 
Other large Trust Funds were committed in the Water Sector (twice US$ 15mill), the Environment/ Tourism 

61 

 
 
sector with a GEF/PHRD grant contribution to the Trans-Frontier Conservation Area & Tourism Development 
Project of US$13.7million, and the Agricultural Sector (US$ 6.2 million). 

14. 
Engagement under the CPS followed the three principles of “Collaborate-Focus-Deliver” with a strong 
anchoring in partnership with Government and other donors. The Bank took an active role in development 
partner harmonization to achieve overall of eighteen outcomes which the CPS for FY08-11 set out to achieve. 
The CPS was organized in three broad pillars: (1) Increased Accountability and Public Voice: (2) Equitable access 
to key sectors; (3) Sustainable and broad-based growth and measured with 28 outcome indicators. The CPS 
results framework indicates how the policy and investment areas under each pillar are aligned with PARPA II 
objectives. Because a mid-term CPS Progress Report (PR) was not undertaken, the Bank missed an opportunity 
to take stock of progress against envisioned outcomes and as a result, a number of outcome indicators that 
should have been replaced, clarified, or dropped due to changing circumstances and priorities were left in the 
results framework.  The majority of the outcomes that were observable with measurable ind icators and were 
pursued was “achieved” or “partially achieved”. Only three of the eighteen outcomes are considered “not 
achieved”.  

15. 
The CPS Program by and large delivered the 
anticipated results across the three pillars, but 
exhibits uneven performance, and some delays in 
demonstrating development 
impact. The results 
framework was inadequately maintained throughout 
the CPS period, missing opportunities to adjust for 
changes in the portfolio and such rendering some 
outcomes unobservable or not achieved. Due to this 
shortcoming and some slippages in the portfolio, the overall performance of the CPS Program is considered 
only moderately satisfactory.

17. 
The PRSC series was the driving force behind the CPS program in the area “Increased Accountability and 
public voice” and supported significant progress towards improving budget planning at central, district and 
municipal levels, notably the strengthening of public financial management (PFM) systems. Improvements have 
focused on the legal framework and the implementation of an integrated PFM information system (e-SISTAFE) 
which has allowed the full transition from the previous system of advance payments towards a modern system 
of direct budget execution. Roll-out of e-SISTAFE was also supported by the Public Sector Reform Project and the 
system has been comprehensively introduced across central government and was accompanied by an extensive 
training program, involving 1,850 users. The roll out of e-SISTAFE has exceeded the targets set for in the PRSC 
series, both at the national and sub-national levels. Currently, over 90 percent of goods and services 
transactions are carried out through the system via direct bank transfer from the Single Treasury Account, thus 
improving transparency and information on public spending as well as reducing the risk of diversion of funds. 
Besides the PRSC’s role as a vehicle to buttress reforms, the IMF took a central role through its use of structural 
benchmarks to effectively implement e-SISTAFE, as pointed out by the IEG Country Study on Mozambique PRSCs 
(IEG Working Paper 2010/7).   

18. 
Also supported by the PRSC and equally successful were measures to enhance revenue generation 
capacity through the creation of the Central Revenue Authority. The IEG Country Study on Mozambique PRSCs 
(IEG Working Paper 2010/7) confirmed that revenue collection is an area where most significant improvements 
were observable during the PRSC series. Revenue targets were exceeded for 2009 by reaching 17.8% of GDP; 
Coverage of internal audit and controls increased significantly and meeting the revised Performance Assessment 
Framework (PAF) targets for 2009 with 75% of central and provincial level bodies having operational internal 
audit units which amounts to an increase of 50 percentage points over 2007. Another, more general indication 
of the impressive improvements in PFM is provided by the PEFA assessment (December 2010), where the share 
of indicators graded B or above has gone from 39 percent in 2004 to 61 percent in 2009. The CPS delivered also 
two core ESW to support this results area, the CPAR Update and the Accounting and Auditing ROSC.  

19. 
The process of decentralization has provided an opportunity to promote demand-side governance 
activities, 
including mainstreaming of social accountability mechanisms 
in order to enhance citizens’ 
participation in public sector management and the oversight of public resources. Unfortunately achievement of 

63 

 
 
CPS outcomes in the area of citizen oversight and improvements in legal and judicial services cannot be 
sufficiently demonstrated as the CPS results framework was not adjusted to allow a selection of different 
indicators.  Due to the closure of the Public Sector Reform Project in unsatisfactory state, only some milestones 
were achieved and both of the associated CPS outcomes appear as ‘not monitored’.  

20. 
Notwithstanding the shortcomings of the CPS results framework, results achieved through the first 
Decentralized Planning and Financing Project are witness to quite impressive progress as evidenced by ICR data 
(Report Nr. ICR00001308). For instance, at the end of the project in 2009, all districts had District Consultative 
Councils organized approving district plans and implementation reports over a zero baseline in 2004. All of the 
128 districts have adopted methodologies for participatory planning and governance. A 2009 study of 
community participation and consultation found that the project made a major contribution in creating 
structures for community participation. Some 81 percent of respondents to the survey conducted said they were 
aware of district investments and 88 percent of these expressed satisfaction with the results. In terms of 
improving accountability and citizen voice the successful support for the completion and publication of data for 
the population census by the Public Sector Reform Project should also be pointed out for its important 
contribution to establish baseline data and reference points to measure improvement of public services.  

21. While the Public Sector Reform Project struggled with an ambitious agenda for a three-year 
implementation period, the public sector team took to heart the lessons learned by dropping the originally 
planned second phase of the APL to devise a more effective approach to reform and decided for a change -
management model for the follow-up operation, now planned for FY12. The successful Decentralized Planning 
and Financing Project was followed up with an operation in FY10 to sustain and further deepen the results 
achieved at the district and local level. Despite the politically sensitive decentralization policy in Mozambique, 
the new operation was successful in harmonizing development partner support under one common results 
framework. The second Decentralized Planning and Financing Project also continues to support some of the 
district communication strategies.     

22. 
Despite the highly satisfactory outcomes in the area of PFM, overall, outcomes for this pillar are 
considered moderately satisfactory given the shortcomings of results achievement in improving legal and 
judicial services, as well as improved government information and communication systems.  

2. Equitable Access To Key Services - CPS Pillar 2 

23. 
The US$ 55mill HIV/Aids Response Project was successful in contributing to increased access to 
information on and treatment for HIV/Aids and thus provided an effective response to an area that the CPS 
had singled out HIV/Aids as perhaps the single greatest threat to Mozambique’s growth and development. 
The MAP project was restructured to better contribute to the implementation process of the Government’s 
National Strategic Plan to Combat STD and HIV/AIDS, notably the realignment of the CNCS (National HIV/Aids 
Council), which aims to refocus the organization's role around the core functions of coordination and leadership 
of the national HIV/AIDS response. Recently the CNCS Board examined and endorsed the decentralization of the 
HIV/AIDS response to the local level. In addition, the Board considered the new proposed organic statute for the 
CNCS, which seeks to ensure that the rules, staffing, recruitment and careers governing CNCS are based on the 
common Government Public Service laws and regulations. This is an important step in ensuring sustainability of 
the national HIV/Aids response.  

64 

 
 
24. 
Over the period of the CAS, the number of people receiving ARV treatment increased from 34,000 in 
2006 to more than 170,000 by mid 2010 according to Global Fund data. Since the project supported the national 
HIV/Aids response, these results cannot be solely attributed to the project; however this figure far exceeds the 
60,000 people envisioned in the CPS. The project’s last ISR reports that as of April 30, 2011, nearly 234,000 AIDS 
patients were on ART or roughly 47% of HIV+ individuals who need ART. Over 900 health facilities in 
Mozambique are providing PMTCT services to about 70,000 HIV positive pregnant women, representing a 
coverage rate of about 46%. Overall, according to data from successive epidemiological surveillance (2003, 2005, 
2007) and the INSIDA 2009, the HIV epidemic in Mozambique appears to be slowing down, notwithstanding the 
continuing rise in the country’s southern region.   

25. 
Other than in the HIV/Aids program, the CPS was less successful in achieving improved equity in 
health services, but was responsive to Governments request in quickly delivering an additional Health 
Commodity Securities Project. Preparation of the Health Service Delivery Project was delayed and then 
experienced another 10 months effectiveness delay. Although the latest ISR (Jan 2011) projects disbursements 
of up to US$20 million during the calendar year, by end of the CPS period, it had only disbursed about one 
percent of funds, mainly due to delays in submitting an acceptable procurement plan. This is juxtaposed by the 
health team’s quick response to an urgent Government request to help avert the fall-out of the global financial 
crisis which adversely affected the availability of key public health commodities and delivered an additional US$ 
39mill Health Commodity Security Project. The project became effective in February 2011 and aims at improving 
supply chain management in the country, thus ensuring the availability of selected drugs and medical supplies in 
Key Distribution Points.  

26. 
The institutional set-up for the national TEVET system was successfully created under the CPS. 
However, the Technical and Vocational Education Project followed a rather ambitious design by creating the 
institutions for a market-oriented and competency-based TEVET system and expecting results in labor-market 
uptake for graduates of newly created qualification program within a five-year implementation period. The 
project experienced implementation delays, in particular with regard to policy implementation as well as 
institutional arrangements, but made significant strides towards setting up Mozambique’s TEVET system and 
met the milestones the CPS set in this area: 19 qualifications and related modules have been developed in the 
areas of Agriculture, Industrial Maintenance, Tourism and Administration and Management. However, the 
indicator on labor-market uptake was unlikely to be observable under the projects or the CPS period; the 
following CAS will have to closely monitor developments in the TEVET area, especially since the project received 
additional financing in FY11 to scale up its impact. 

27. 
The CPS Results Framework did not include results in the area of access, quality and equity of prima ry 
and secondary education, but great progress was made through the US$ 79mill Education For All Catalytic 
Trust Fund (FY09). Supporting the implementation of the Government's Strategic Plan for Education and Culture 
2006-2011, the first FTI project employed a pooled funds mechanism to move Mozambique’s education sector 
closer to achieving the MDGs. The primary completion rate increased from 38% in 2007 to 48% in 2009 and the 
illiteracy rate was reduced by 9 percentage points in the three-year period between 2007 and 2009. An 
additional 7000 teachers graduated from pre-service training in the same period, according to the last ISR of the 
project. The project is followed by another FTI and IDA combined investment of US$171mill in FY11 to continue 
improving educational quality and picking up the delays in classroom rehabilitation and construction. Overall, 

65 

 
 
although not officially accounted for in the CPS, achievements in the general education sector which were 
directly supported by the Bank’s program were significant.  

28. 
Progress in increasing access to potable water through the Water Services and Institutional Support 
Project was significant under the CPS. The original US$15mill operation received additional financing of US$ 37 
million in FY11 and has scaled up its activities to additional cities, now serving Beira, Dondo, Nampula, 
Quelimane, Ilha de Mocambique, Mocimboa da Praia, Pemba, Tete, Chimoio, Gondola, Angoche, Moatize, and 
Nacala. By end of June 2011, the project had connected an additional 192,443 urban dwellers to potable water, 
and hence exceeded the CPS target of 53,000 people by far.  

29. 
This remarkable result was achieved despite the FY07 approved US$ 6 million Output-Based Payments 
Grant to increase piped-water access to the poor in Maputo, Beira, Nampula, Quelimane, and Pemba never took 
off and has yet to be restructured to focus on Maputo only. Under the division of labor increased rural access 
was supported by the African Development Bank with a programmatic lending approach. Although not 
supported by Bank operations, access to clean water in rural areas has been growing at around 200,000 to 
250,000 people per year in the four targeted provinces which exceeds by far the CPS target of adding 360,000 
people over 4 years, The CPS should have clearly stated the division of labor in this area; however, taking into 
account the impressive results, this oversight in managing the CPS shouldn’t impact the assessment of this 
outcome.  

30. 
The CPS was successful in increasing access to sustainable and affordable electricity to institutions 
outside of the power network, but did not fully attain its targets within the CPS period. Supported by the IDA 
US$ 40 million Energy Reform and Access Project (ERAP), the CPS specifically focused on electrifying schools and 
clinics with off-grid solar systems. Out of the 300 planned systems to be installed, 236 acceptance certificates 
had been issued by the consulting engineer by May 2010. The remaining 64 facilities, plus an additional 100 
facilities not foreseen in the CPS, will be completed by early 2012. The procurement and contractual delays have 
now been resolved and the contractor for the remaining installations has now mobilized.  Although not 
measured by an outcome indicator, the on-grid electrification activities also supported by the project were very 
successful in reducing the cost for new grid connections. While the project target was to decrease the new 
connection cost to under US$ 950 per connection, in May 2010 the average cost was below US$ 700 by the end 
of the project, thus by far exceeding the project’s target. In addition, approximately 28,000 new household 
connections in project areas were completed by May 2011. Looking forward, this is a significant stepping stone 
in ensuring the sustainability of electricity access expansion in Mozambique.  

31. 
Select achievements under this pillar are impressive but are contrasted by significant shortcomings 
and delays in critical areas. Despite the excellent progress in the area of HIV/Aids prevention and treatment, 
increased access to potable water and educational outcomes towards the MDGs, outcomes for this pillar cannot 
be rated better than moderately satisfactory due to the shortfall in general health service delivery, delays in the 
TEVET system as well as below-target numbers in institutional off-grid access to electricity.   

3. Sustainable And Broad-Based Growth - CPS Pillar 3 

32. 
The CPS growth agenda was broadly delivered and achieved, although two critical areas either slipped 
into the next CAS period or were dropped without being formally adjusted in the CPS framework which reflects 
negatively on the otherwise satisfactory accomplishments. Guided by the overall goals of sustainable and 

66 

 
 
broad-based growth, this pillar grouped interventions supporting improvements in the investment climate and 
financial sector, ICT and transport infrastructure, as well as agricultural development and strengthening the 
tourism sector, one of Mozambique’s growth areas with great potential. Energy production, water resource 
management and enhanced disaster response were also part of this pillar’s program. The investment lending 
program and PRSC were supported by a knowledge program of ESW and TA products, including the High-Level 
Policy Conference on Medium-Term Economic Policy Priorities, hosted by the Government of Mozambique and 
jointly undertaken with the IMF, Bank and other donors, which was highly appreciated for its in -time and 
adequate high-quality support to the client. 

33. Water resources management and disaster response are critical areas for Mozambique, a country that is 
frequently exposed to floods on the one hand but has difficulty to serve its capital city with the necessary water 
supply on the other hand. The National Water Resources Development Project addresses both aspects by 
increasing the storage capacity of Corumana dam to ensure adequate supply to the Maputo piped system on 
one hand, and supports the implementation of the National Water Resources Strategy on the other hand. 
Unfortunately the project slipped into FY12, the next CAS period, mainly due to delays in preparatory studies 
and the precautions and safeguards needed in projects that involve large dams. Disaster preparedness and 
response in the meantime was supported by a GFDRR grant that made good progress in mainstreaming 
integrated disaster risk management and adaptation to climate change into policies and strategies, such as the 
Plano Quinquennal (Mozambique’s Five-Year National Plan) at the national and sector level.  

34. 
The Bank’s program made critical contributions to power sector development but the CPS outcome to 
increase energy production for export, commerce and industry was not directly supported by project activities 
undertaken during the CPS period. The CPS had anticipated the Bank’s involvement in increasing intra-regional 
power trade via the Mozambique-Malawi Transmission Interconnection (SAPP APL-II) project. However, due to 
political reasons in Malawi, the credit for the Malawi segment of the project was never signed and the credit is 
due to be restructured to support the national energy sector in Mozambique. That said, several reform areas in 
Mozambique’s energy sector were supported by Bank operations, such as the Energy Reform and Access Project 
(ERAP APL-I), including the successful establishment of an independent, advisory regulator for the energy sector 
in Mozambique. ERAP’s successor project, the Energy Development and Access Project (EDAP APL-II), which was 
approved in March 2010, will continue to support on- and off-grid electrification as well as ongoing sector 
reforms. In a related area, the water resources outcome was not achieved as anticipated, with the regional ESW 
on the Zambezi Multi-Sector Investment Opportunities, the Bank provided high-quality analysis to inform future 
sustainable development in the Zambezi valley, including irrigation, tourism and regional power development 
and trade through the Southern African Power Pool. 

35. 
The ICT agenda was successfully delivered under the CPS by introducing competition in the 
Mozambican telecommunications market. As a result, ele-density increased from 8% in 2000 to over 20% in 
2008, a performance that is also remarkable in comparison to other regional countries. Building on the initial 
success, the follow-up eGovernment and Communications Infrastructure Project (MEGCIP) project, delivered in 
FY10, further improves competition, through the introduction of a third mobile operator, improves affordability 
of international communications and internet services, and addresses the lack of competitively priced backbone 
access, which constitutes one of the most severe barriers for operators. In addition the new intervention will 

67 

 
 
also reach direct beneficiaries by supporting the setup of up to 20 Community Multimedia Centers (CMCs) 
throughout the country. 

36. 
Improvements in the Investment Climate, particularly with respect to the ease of doing business and 
the strengthening the financial and Tourism sector were successfully supported by the CPS program. The 
number of days to open a business was reduced from 90 in 2006 to 26 in 2009, surpassing the target set by the 
CPS and the Performance Assessment Framework (PAF) for General Budget Support. While the outcome was 
supported by the PRSC series, the Financial Sector Technical Assistance Project, and the Competitiveness and 
Private Sector Development Project, which is a US$ 25 million operation closing in 2014, aiming to accelerating 
licensing reform and enhance business services for SMEs, an area that is also supported by IFC. The 
Competitiveness operation will also provide matching grants schemes accessible to participating SMEs which is a 
critical stepping stone in increasing access to finance.. The achievements in improving standards in the financial 
sector exceeded the target of 80%, by 93% of banks fulfilling norms and IAS/IFRS in 2010 over a zero baseline in 
2006.  The CPS complemented its lending program in this area with the FSAP Follow-Up and Mozambique 
Investment Climate Assessment (ICA) in FY09, a Growth Poles & Economic Zones analysis in FY10, the Regional 
Investment Climate Assessment and the Regional Trade Report in FY11.  IFC newly invested about US$43 million 
in the banking Sector in Mozambique and otherwise realized roughly US$27 million in private sector investments 
in the Oil, Gas and Mining Industry and Food and Beverages.  

37. 
IFC’s advisory services played a role in supporting the SME segment in Mozambique over the CPS 
period but it is difficult to assess in measurable terms in how far the CPS succeeded to increase access to 
finance for SMEs.  IFC provided a rich program for SMEs through its Advisory Services mostly focusing on 
business plan creation, which in turn would secure investment or lines of credit. IFC also financed capacity 
building activities including for women entrepreneurs. Most prominently placed was IFC’s SME Initiative with 
the general objective of creating a sustainable SME funding mechanism complemented by tailored advisory 
activities to enable SMEs to better deal with issues related to business legalization, environmental and social 
licensing, strategic and business planning, accounting and financial management, and other management issues.  

38. 
Tourism Sector Development progressed well under the CPS, albeit changes in the regulatory 
environment are lagging behind. The Tourism sector was supported by two operations under the CPS, the 
Competitiveness and Private Sector Development project, focusing on support to SMEs in the sector, and the 
Trans-Frontier Conservation Area & Tourism Development Project (TFACTDP) supporting community 
participation in tourism development, as well as IFC’s Tourism Anchor Investment Program. The number of bed-
nights in tourism facilities in target districts increased to about twice the amount of the targeted 100,000 bed-
nights by 2009, and, the TFACTDP also surpassed its targets for revenue generation by targeted protected areas 
in Mozambique. The tourism agenda was also successfully supported by IFC Advisory Services securing a US$ 2.5 
million investment for the Maputo Elephant Reserve for a partnership between a private sector investor and a 
local community association and securing a US$ 30 million tourism investment for the Casuarina and Epidendron 
Islands. The development is expected to create 650 jobs during construction and 250 jobs during exploration. 
IFC also successfully supported regulatory reform in the tourism sector, including the Investment Law Regulation 
which allows individual Integrated Tourism Resort projects to apply for Special Economic Zone status, the 
Tourism Interest Zones Regulations which foresees that areas with special natural, cultural or historic 
characteristics can be reserved for tourism development and the creation of a new government agency, the 

68 

 
 
Tourism National Institute (INATUR) in charge of tourism development and investment facilitation in ‘Anchor 
Sites’. Despite these achievements and the successful development of Tourism Master Plans for three provinces, 
critical sector reform processes, such as the award and management of tourism concessions on public land, are 
delayed at the national level and should be closely monitored under the new CAS until the project closes in 
2013. 

39. 
The CPS program was by and large successful in achieving the anticipated outcomes in the 
transportation sector. Specific challenges became recently evident with the concessionaire for the Railway line 
in the Zambezi Valley, as rehabilitation works were falling further behind, and line’s capacity and rolling stock 
fleet were unable to meet the transport demand. This lead the performance of the Beira Railway Project to be 
downgraded to unsatisfactory state, just nine months before the project’s closing end December 2011. The 
Beira Railway Project built on the successful delivery of the Railway and Ports Restructuring Project that 
restructured Mozambique’s Ports and Railway Parastatal (Portos e Caminhos de Ferro de Mozambique, E.P.-
CFM) and substantially increased the operating efficiency of the three major port-rail systems in Mozambique 
and enabled them to increase their share of international freight traffic. The scheduled ESW on the 
Concessionaire is delayed into FY12.   

40. 
In the roads sector, the Roads and Bridges Maintenance Project, delivered as an Adaptable Program 
Loan, assisted the recipient successfully in setting up the National Roads Fund and increasing its revenues , which 

in turn is the main mechanism to finance road maintenance. By end of the first phase of the APL revenue targets 

were surpassed and such the sustainability of financing for road maintenance significantly strengthened.  During 
the CAS period, additional financing for the second phase of APL2 was delivered and together with support by 
the PRSC, targets for the percentage of road network in good and fair conditions increased almost as planned 
from 64% in 2007 to 71% in 2009, albeit falling short of the 78% target. The next CAS will have to closely monitor 
maintenance and rehabilitation of roads assets.   

41. 
 The agriculture sector in Mozambique faced considerable challenges but the CPS program successfully 
supported the anticipated CPS results. Main vehicles of support were the PRSC, the Marked-Led Smallholder 
Development Project, a Public Expenditure Review study of the agricultural sector and a set of high-quality set of 
Land Policy Notes. The anticipated target of increasing access to public extension services from 222,000 in 2007 

to 411,000 in 2009 was almost met in 2009 by reaching a total number of 364,752 peasants. However, exten sion 
services, while critical, are only enablers for improved productivity and increased agricultural income. Together 
with the US$ 70 million Sustainable Irrigation Development Project approved in FY 11, the agricultural sector 
program will have to strengthen its policy dialogue and accelerate implementation to show real impact during the 
following CAS period.    

42. 
Performance of the CPS program under this pillar was uneven across different sectors but overall 
satisfactory despite the diverse set of challenges posed by a difficult policy environment and sometimes 
diverging multi-development partner interests. Nevertheless, due to the inadequate results framework in some 
of the targeted areas, outcome achievement under this pillar can only be considered moderately satisfactory.  

III. WORLD BANK GROUP PERFORMANCE 

D. CPS Design and Relevance 

69 

 
 
43. 
The FY08-FY11 CPS was relevant in its design by being developed in close alignment with Mozambique’s 
PRSP, or PARPA II whose name is derived from the Portuguese acronym for the Second Action Plan for the 
Reduction of Absolute Poverty. One of the main drivers of the CPS program was to address the challenge of 
sustaining growth in Mozambique’s economy beyond the post-conflict catch-up that could be observed since 
the end of the civil war in 1992. Other main challenges identified by the CPS were second generation policy and 
regulatory reforms associated with the broad area of governance and the needs of the human development 
agenda, including the paramount challenges posed by HIV/Aids. Responding to these challenges, and based on 
sound preparatory analytical work, the CPS program was arranged in three pillars, (I) Increased Accountability 
and Public Voice, (II) Equitable Access to Key Services, and (III) Sustainable and Broad-Based Growth. 

44. 
The CPS Results Framework was generally clearly organized, but the opportunity to adjust the program 
through a progress report was missed causing detrimental effects for the results-based management of the 
program.. The results matrix aligned the portfolio well with government development goals in an overall of 
eighteen outcomes, grouped in five results areas and three pillars. While the framework could have defined 
outcomes more selectively, by and large it was furnished with measureable outcome indicators. However the 
CPS included end-of-project results for some pipeline operations which were impossible to be realized during 
the CPS implementation period. Since no CPS Progress Report was prepared the opportunity to correct this 
shortcoming was missed, and together with delays in project preparation, this lead to CPS outcomes rated as 
‘not achieved’, while in fact they should have been dropped or adjusted and replaced with more suitable ones. 

E. CPS Implementation 

45. 
Most of the lending program planned under the CPS was delivered and the World Bank Group adapted 
well in response to emerging needs stemming from the Global Financial Crisis and other challenges. In summary 
the World Bank Group made good use of the instruments available to successfully adapt the program to 
changing needs. The country team delivered a considerable additional lending program that almost doubled the 
original indicative lending volume through (i) higher than anticipated lending amounts for most operations, (ii) 
Additional Financings to ongoing operations and (iii) additional projects.  

46. 
The initially anticipated CPS program exhibited some delays and a few slippages which occurred mostly 
where complex operations were being prepared in sectors with a challenging political economy environment 
such as water resources or agriculture. However, projects facing preparation delays mostly were eventually 
approved with a higher than originally anticipated lending amount. About half of the new lending program was 
approved in FY11, indicating bunching coinciding with the end of the IDA15 cycle.  

47. 
Overall the portfolio maintained its ‘healthy’ and ‘efficient’ state which is an indication for a well 
managed portfolio, although portfolio performance took a downward turn in FY11. Equally, the high pro-activity 
levels decreased to only 33% in FY11. This coincided with the delivery of more than 50% of new lending in FY11 , 
which is an astounding accomplishment given the CMU’s management challenges during this period. In addition, 
preparation time was reduced from 15 to 9 months on average compared to the previous CAS period and is 
lower than the average 12 months for the Africa Region overall. The country team carried out a rigorous CPPR 
program with a strong results focus and follow-up on issues identified, such as intensified client capacity building 
in procurement, financial management and monitoring and evaluation.

The Mozambique portfolio was 
generally effective in terms of achieving 
development outcomes as evidenced 
by 86% satisfactory outcome ratings for 
FY08-10 (IEG) and a 0% disconnect to 
IEG ratings for exiting projects over the 
CPS period which is considerably lower than the average for the Africa Region. Only one project, the Public 
Sector Reform Project (FY03) exited with an unsatisfactory (both Bank and IEG) rating. Nevertheless, bunching, 
delays and the leadership vacuum had a bearing on CPS portfolio effectiveness. Unfortunately no CPS Progress 
Report was prepared to adjust the results framework to changing circumstances and to properly reflect 
additional operations.

49. 
The CPS included a demand-driven AAA program which was generally consistent with the areas of focus 
of the Bank. In hindsight, the demand-driven approach worked well in responding in a timely manner to select 
social and economic challenges (food/fuel price crisis, social protection), but could have benefitted from better 
strategic programming. The slippage of the publication of one of the major ESW deliverables, the Country 
Economic Memorandum (CEM), beyond the CPS implementation period into FY12, is an unfortunate 
shortcoming. However, alternate AAA activities were highly successful and flexible in responding to the changing 
circumstances, such as the global financial crisis. Notably the High-Level Policy Conference on Medium-Term 
Economic Policy Priorities which was hosted by the Government of Mozambique and jointly undertaken with the 
IMF, stands out with respect to providing in-time, high-quality knowledge support to the client. Having been co-
sponsored by the United Kingdom Department for International Development (DFID) and the Swiss Agency for 
Development and Cooperation, the conference is also an excellent example of development partner 
collaboration. In addition, ESWs such as the ones on Municipal Revenues, Urbanization and the Water Sector 
Public Expenditure Review proved the Bank’s ability to deliver high-quality knowledge products in time for 
public policy planning as well as informing the lending program.   

50. 
Overall, progress was made to move forward the Paris Agenda on alignment and harmonization of 
Development Partners according to the 2011 OECD Mozambique Evaluation Report on the Paris Agenda, but the 
heavy aid architecture increasingly limits flexibility and efficiency. The PRSC series to provide direct budget 
support was in line with the effort to accelerate implementation of the Paris Agenda, an explicit objective of the 
CPS and based on recommendations from the previous CAS. The Memorandum of Understanding serves as the 
main vehicle for coordination of budget support by the Budget Support Donors Group (G19). An elaborate set -
up of up to 72 working groups encompasses the overall aid architecture in Mozambique which is generally 
believed to reduce transaction costs for Government. Conversely, the World Bank Group’s participation and lead 
in a high number of working groups entails significant transaction costs at the Bank’s side and restricts 
somewhat the flexibility in raising policy issues, although sector specialists, over time, have arrived at 
appreciating the PRSC as a vehicle for generating more effective sector policy dialogue, as the IEG Country Study 
on Mozambique PRSCs (IEG Working Paper 2010/7) points out. 

51. 
On the other hand, the three-year Performance Assessment Framework (PAF), used to monitor progress 
against development outcomes for general budget support, was perceived as too rigid and the development 
partner dialogue at times as challenging, particularly with regard to education and agriculture SWAPs. Donor 

71 

 
 
dialogue reached an impasse in early 2010 in the context of Mozambique’s General Elections, when multilateral 
positions diverted significantly from the ones brought forward by bi-lateral donors with regard to demanding 
political change. Despite the challenges of participating in a large group of donors with equal voice, Government 
officials pointed out in the IEG Working Paper on Mozambique’s PRSCs that the Bank’s convening power lends 
credibility to the general budget support program and appreciated the Bank’s technical expertise as an asset in 
helping shape policy formulation. The same review however also encourages stronger Bank leadership on 
analytical work as a foundation for the budget support program; a suggestion that should be taken seriously for 
the upcoming CAS.   

F. World Bank Group Performance Rating 

52. 
The World Bank Group delivered very successfully a stronger than anticipated lending program and 
timely AAA products, yet the Bank’s performance falls short of a fully satisfactory rating for the following 
reasons: The impact on the ground could have been even stronger with less slippages, tighter ESW programming 
and the formal undertaking of the necessary adjustments through a CPS Progress Report. A major contributing 
factor was certainly the transitional character of management during the second half of the CPS 
implementation. The success of the strategy despite of these internal management challenges was due to the 
consistently strong dialogue and close engagement with Government, and the continued strong management at 
the portfolio and project level which off-set the overall lack of strategic leadership during the last third of CPS 
implementation. Therefore the World Bank Group performance is overall rated as only “Moderately 
Satisfactory”. 

IV. KEY LESSONS LEARNED AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE NEW CAS  

53. 
Poverty Reduction.  Poverty has stagnated at roughly 55 percent of the population despite good levels 
of growth in the economy and during the CPS period growing disparities between rural and urban poverty 
became more apparent. At the same time there are concerns about the reliability of national poverty data. Over 
the next CPS period considerable effort should be put towards providing appropriate analytical work to better 
understand structural deficiencies and weaknesses in the Government’s growth and poverty reduction strategy. 
Analytics of this kind need to have a thorough grounding in the country itself, going beyond participatory 
approaches. The Bank, together with Government and other partners should explore avenues for 
institutionalizing a permanent Think Tank with a strong policy evaluation unit that has, while being independent 
from influence, enough political clout to be a driver of change. The AAA program and possibly a governance 
focused operation should take this into account. 

54. 
CAS Monitoring. One of the significant shortcomings of the CPS was the failure to monitor CPS 
outcomes and adapt to changes in the country environment and the portfolio. The upcoming CAS should take a 
pro-active approach and have an annual stocktaking exercise on CAS milestones and implement the necessary 
adaptations at mid-term together with a CAS Progress Report. CAS monitoring should be based on a more 
selective results matrix with a smaller number of outcomes to avoid fragmentation of results. In addition, the 
results framework should carefully take into account the level of results it can realistically achieve over the CAS 
period, given the timeframe, risks and resources available of supporting operations. It would also be worth 

72 

 
 
trying to map investments per supported outcome as this may place particular attention to ‘high value’ 
outcomes.   

55. 
Leadership, Pipeline and Portfolio Management. Portfolio performance and pro-activity took a 
downward turn towards the end of the CPS period. This coincided with challenges in the CMU’s leadership, 
leaving key positions in acting arrangements for significant periods of time. Staff morale in particular at the 
country office level suffered from a lack in readily available management guidance. Going forward the CMU 
should ensure strong leadership for the country team and program to reinstate trust and stability. Going hand in 
hand with this, strong and systematic portfolio management could help in addressing issues quickly and avoid 
slippages in programmed lending and weaknesses in portfolio performance. As for the  pipeline, candid analysis 
of capacity (client and Bank) and the political economy of the concerned sectors could allow for a more realistic 
assessment of preparation time and implementation readiness.  

56. 
Choice of Instruments - Investment Loans/Grants & PRSC: While the PRSCs are helpful in embedding 
sector specific reforms within broader structural reforms in the economy and ensuring that the reforms are 
aligned with national development strategies, they have their limitations. The successful implementation some 
of the PRSCs was strengthened by the presence of complimentary technical assistance projects. This was 
especially the case where capacity was weak. Going forward this cross-fertilization of PRSCs and sector 
investment programs should be pro-actively used as an instrument to influence and impact outcomes on the 
national development agenda. 

57. 
AAA Program: Going forward the CAS should lay out a more focused and planned AAA program related 
to PRSC areas to inform the sector dialogue, as suggested by the IEG Country Program Evaluation (IEG 2010/07). 
Together with more Public Expenditure Surveys, analytical work will then have a better chance of influencing 
reforms on which in turn investment operations can build. The Bank team should also take seriously the 
suggestion by the IEG s Country Program Evaluation (IEG 2010/07) to assume a stronger leadership role in the 
budget support program, building on analytical work as a foundation. Besides other priority areas determined by 
budget support areas and sector engagements, the analysis should focus on analyzing why poverty rates are 
stagnating while Mozambique’s economy sustains high levels of growth.  

58. 
Aid Architecture: While Mozambique is still regarded as a good example of development partner 
harmonization, the heavy aid architecture takes a toll in terms of transaction costs on development partner 
sides. Under the upcoming CAS the Bank should take an active role in overhauling the heavy aid architecture in 
Mozambique to let the entire development partner community benefit from efficiency gains. This may need 
high-level dialogue beyond Head of Corporations/ Head of Missions level.
