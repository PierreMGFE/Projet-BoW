EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

i. The Sri Lankan country context has evolved considerably since the FY09-12 
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) was prepared.  The 26-year conflict ended in May 
2009 and resettlement of Internally Displaced Persons and demining are now largely 
complete. Sri Lanka 
is 
transitioning 
to middle 
income country status. The 
macroeconomic situation has improved.  Sri Lanka can now focus on long-term strategic 
and structural development challenges. Key challenges include realigning public 
spending and policy with the needs of a middle income country, ensuring opportunities 
for all Sri Lankans to benefit from economic growth, ensuring appropriate resource 
allocations for the various tiers of Government, addressing the opportunities and impacts 
of the demographic transition, and enhancing the role of the private sector including 
provision of appropriate incentives for increasing productivity and exports. 

ii. The Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for FY13-16 is designed to assist the 
Government of Sri Lanka to address the long term strategic and structural 
development challenges, while using the existing portfolio to support ongoing efforts 
to restore livelihoods of Internally Displaced Persons and others affected by the 
conflict.  The World Bank Group’s relationship with the Government has strengthened 
with increased dialogue and support on the middle income country agenda.  In 
recognition of its growth and economic stability, Sri Lanka has access to IBRD financing 
as of FY12, allowing for significantly increased financial support during the coming 
years. 

iii. Recognizing the need for sustained effort following the end of the conflict, the 2011 
World Development Report on Conflict, Security and Development provides 
valuable insights for this CPS.  Many of the principles of engagement proposed by the 
World Development Report are relevant for Sri Lanka:  delivering early results to build 
public trust and confidence, strengthening institutions in a phased approach, focusing on 
social accountability, enhancing political and economic inclusion and applying 
community managed/driven approaches.  Many of these principles, including community 
managed/driven approaches, were central in the FY09-12 CAS.  This CPS continues to 
encompass these principles. 

iv. This CPS provides support to address the challenges for achieving the 
Government’s vision as laid out in the “Mahinda Chintana, Vision for the Future”.  
For each of the three central goals of the Government’s vision, the CPS lays out the key 
areas of engagement in which World Bank Group support can most effectively address 
the identified challenges.  These areas of engagement were developed through a process 
of eighteen thematic consultations with the Sri Lankan Government, private sector, civil 
society, development partners and other stakeholders.  Addressing these challenges will 
require a set of structural and behavioral changes in line with the new middle income 
status of Sri Lanka. 

i 

 
 
 
 
 
 
v. The first goal of the Mahinda Chintana -- to increase per capita income to US$ 4,000 
by 2016 -- will require sustained high economic growth (8 percent per year), driven 
by a high investment rate.  Of the targeted investment rate (33-35 percent of GDP per 
year), 6-7 percent of GDP per year is expected to come from public investment with the 
remainder coming from the private sector.  While public sector investment targets were 
achieved in 2010 and 2011, it will be difficult to sustain these levels in the absence of 
increased fiscal space. On the private sector investment side, the level reached 22 percent 
and 23 percent in 2010 and 2011 falling short of the targets. Reversing this trend will 
require concerted efforts to improve the investment climate. 

vi. The second goal is shifting towards a more knowledge-based, globally integrated 
and competitive, environmentally friendly, internally integrated and increasingly 
urban economy.  Sri Lanka has a solid base for achieving this goal, with a well educated 
population and a wealth of environmental assets.  Challenges going forward include 
providing systems and incentives to build an appropriately skilled labor force, 
establishing economic policies that encourage competitiveness, stronger efforts on 
environmental sustainability and adaptation to climate change, and modernizing 
infrastructure systems to integrate the disparate parts of the country and meet the needs of 
the increasingly urban population.   

vii. The third goal is ensuring improvement in living standards and social inclusion.  
With its long history of attention to access to basic services, Sri Lanka excels for its 
income level on most social indicators, with the exception of malnutrition.  As Sri Lanka 
becomes a middle income country, new challenges are emerging (e.g. a rapidly aging 
population) and improving the quality of services will be a major issue.  While increasing 
the quality of services, an important challenge will be to ensure that benefits are equitably 
shared across all segments of the population and to prioritize social inclusion and ethnic 
reconciliation. Successful achievement of this goal will require continuation of 
Government efforts to resettle Internally Displaced Persons, to invest in the conflict-
affected areas of the North and East, and to engage with the political opposition.  

viii. The proposed FY13-16 CPS builds on the successful engagement under the FY09-12 
CAS and deepens the World Bank Group’s support to Sri Lanka in addressing its 
emerging middle-income country agenda. It is designed to be flexible, focusing on a 
small number of large projects.  Further, country systems will be used to the extent 
possible. 
 Moving 
toward 
increased harmonization with country systems and 
coordination with other development partners will be especially important in sector wide 
approaches. This engagement will be supported by International Development 
Association (IDA) and International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) 
resources, using a full range of lending and non-lending instruments.  The International 
Finance Corporation (IFC) will continue to play a key role in providing investment and 
advisory services to the private sector.   

ix. The CPS focuses on three areas:.  These are: (i) facilitating sustained private and public 
investment; (ii) supporting the structural shifts in the economy; and (iii) improving living 
standards and social inclusion.

xi. 

xii. 

In the area of sustained private and public investment, the World Bank Group will 
support the Government effort to improve the investment climate, strengthen 
governance and reduce the inefficiencies of the public sector. The IFC plans to 
catalyze private investment through directly investing in important projects in key 
sectors. The World Bank will also support the Government’s efforts to maintain a high 
level of public investment and improved efficiency of public expenditures and financial 
management and procurement practices in line with international standards, using both 
knowledge (e.g. Public Expenditure Review and Public Expenditure and Financial 
Accountability Assessment) and lending products (e.g. a development policy loan for 
investment policy and governance reforms and an investment loan for legal and judicial 
reforms). The World Bank will also advise Government on ways to improve the 
efficiency of key State Owned Enterprises (SOEs). 

In supporting a structural shift in the economy, the World Bank Group will deepen 
its assistance to the knowledge based economy with investments in skills, research 
and innovation.  In addition, support to the development of infrastructure needed for 
sustainable urban development and better linkages within Sri Lanka will be enhanced. 

Finally, the World Bank Group will continue to support improvements in living 
standards and social inclusion in order to ensure the benefits of rapid growth and 
higher quality services are broadly shared.  Activities in this area already include three 
ongoing livelihood projects in the conflict-affected North and East regions of the country 
which includes restoration of basic infrastructures, housing construction, and cash for 
work as well as support for starting new businesses.  During the CPS period, the program 
will further include: (i) support to the national health sector program with a focus on 
supporting emerging service delivery demands resulting from Sri Lanka’s aging 
population, such as work on non-communicable diseases; (ii) inter-sectoral efforts to 
address malnutrition, economic integration of women and a range of other activities to 
further support the needs of women, youth and the disabled; (iii) analytical work on 
allocation of resources and benefits received by various groups; and (iv) IFC’s support 
for inclusive growth. 

xiii. The CPS includes an indicative pipeline of projects for financing.  Reviews will be 
held annually to monitor CPS implementation and ensure continued alignment of 
the CPS with the evolving country needs. The program will be supported by 
approximately US$ 577 million (SDR 374.2 million) in funding under the remainder of 
IDA 16.  The program will also be supported by a total of approximately US$ 450 
million in IBRD financing over the period FY13-FY14.  The Government has expressed 
interest in a significantly larger amount of IBRD financing for the outer years of the CPS, 
which would depend on the macroeconomic environment in Sri Lanka as well as the 
overall demand for IBRD resources from other clients, IBRD financial capacity and 
global economic developments.  A Progress Report will be prepared in FY14 at which 
time any necessary revisions to the program, including the lending plans, will be 
discussed.  

iii 

 
 
 
 
 
 
xiv. 

Increased attention will be paid to results in all sectors.  The choice of lending 
instrument will depend on the specific needs.  Alongside specific investment loans, 
instruments are expected to include Development Policy Loans and Program-For-Results 
financing, as client demand and other conditions permit.  Analytical work will also focus 
on results by helping to identify the driving forces and key constraints that need to be 
addressed through policies and investments.   

xv. This CPS includes a careful assessment of key risks in the program, and steps to 
manage such risks.  The first set of risks is related to the implementation environment 
and is reflective of Sri Lanka’s specific development challenges. These include: (i) 
external shocks emanating from Euro Area crisis; (ii) macroeconomic and fiscal risks; 
and (iii) natural disasters. The second set of risks is related to the design of the program 
itself.  These include portfolio risks related to governance, procurement and financial 
management and risks related to government capacity to manage the increased volume of 
lending.  The CPS presents ways to mitigate these challenges. Moreover, the flexible 
approach of this CPS will allow adjustment in the program in line with evolving 
Government priorities and country needs, within the broad direction for engagement 
outlined in this CPS.

COUNTRY CONTEXT 

1. 
The Sri Lankan country context has evolved considerably since the FY09-12 
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) was prepared.  The 26-year conflict ended in May 2009 
and resettlement of Internally Displaced Persons and demining are now largely complete.  The 
attainment of peace bolstered economic performance. The Sri Lankan economy grew at 8 percent 
average per year since the end of the conflict.  Inflation is relatively low at about 6 percent in 
2011, down from 22.6 percent in 2008. Public debt and deficit have been gradually brought 
down and Sri Lanka is transitioning to middle income country status.1   

2. 
Sri Lanka can now focus on long-term strategic and structural development 
challenges.  Key challenges include realigning public spending and policy with the needs of a 
middle income country, ensuring opportunities for all Sri Lankans to benefit from economic 
growth, ensuring appropriate resource allocations for the various tiers of Government, addressing 
the opportunities and impacts of the demographic transition, and enhancing the role of the 
private sector including provision of appropriate incentives for increasing productivity and 
export. 

3. 
The Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for FY13-16 is designed to assist the 
Government of Sri Lanka to address these long term strategic and structural challenges, 
while using the existing portfolio to support efforts to restore livelihoods in the parts of the 
country most affected by the conflict.  The World Bank Group’s relationship with the 
Government has strengthened with increased dialogue and support on the middle income country 
agenda.  In recognition of its growth and economic stability, Sri Lanka has access to IBRD 
financing as of FY12, allowing for significantly increased financial support during the coming 
years. 

4. 
Recognizing the need for sustained efforts following the end of the conflict, the 2011 
World Development Report on Conflict, Security and Development provides valuable 
insights for this CPS.  Many of the principles of engagement proposed by the World 
Development Report are relevant for Sri Lanka:  delivering early results to public trust and 
confidence, strengthening institutions in a phased approach, focusing on social accountability, 
enhancing political and economic inclusion and working with structures at the local level to 
identify priorities and deliver programs.   Many of these principles were central in the FY09-12 
CAS.  This CPS continues to encompass these principles and adopts a pragmatic approach to 
address immediate and medium-term challenges towards strengthening basic institutional 
functions towards providing shared growth, security, justice and jobs.  As such, it is 
strengthening institutions including the Auditor General and judiciary, enhancing the 
transparency and communication between Parliament and civil society, utilizing third party 
monitoring of  projects, and emphasizing equitable allocation of resources and public service 
provision across the country to ensure that all Sri Lankans benefit.

A.   

Political and Social Context 

5. 
The current Government has strong political support.  President Rajapaksa was first 
elected in 2005.  Following a concerted military campaign, the Government defeated the 
separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in May 2009.  Mr. Rajapaksa was re-elected in 2010 
with a strong majority.  Subsequent parliamentary, provincial and local elections have also 
brought strong support for the President’s United People’s Freedom Alliance.  At the national 
level, the opposition now holds less than one third of Parliamentary seats.   

6. 
Resettlement of internally displaced persons and demining have been major focuses 
of the past two years.  About 277,000 people were displaced within the country during the 
conflict.  The vast majority have been resettled, though about 14,000 individuals still remain in 
welfare centers and camps2. Many have returned to areas that were destroyed during the conflict 
and major efforts are ongoing to reestablish public services and infrastructure as well as to 
rebuild housing and re-establish income generating activities.  Many development partners, 
including the World Bank, have supported the Government in the resettlement effort.  

7. 
Broad social and economic inclusion has been occurring slowly and further progress 
is still required.  A long lasting solution to the ethnic problem and setting up effective means of 
addressing grievances of minority communities is vital for sustained peace.  President Rajapaksa 
appointed the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission and mechanisms have been put in 
place to implement key recommendations of the Commission. This process is closely monitored 
by the Government with support of key bilateral partners. 

8. 
Sri Lanka is on track to meet most of the Millennium Development Goals.  UNDP 
has identified Sri Lanka as an early achiever on 10 of the 21 indicators, including those related to 
universal primary education and gender equality.  Sri Lanka is also expected to meet the goals of 
maternal health and HIV/AIDs.  However, Sri Lanka is making slower progress on the goals 
related to malnutrition and child mortality.  Indicators are mixed on the environment: while Sri 
Lanka is an early achiever on indicators of protected area, ozone depleting substance 
consumption, safe drinking water and basic sanitation, it has stagnated or is slipping backwards 
on forest cover and CO2 emissions.3      

9. 
Sri Lanka compares favorably with other countries in its income band in terms of 
gender equality.  Sri Lanka ranks 72nd out of 169 countries on the UN Gender Inequality Index.4  
On the OECD’s Social Institutions and Gender Index, Sri Lanka scores highest among all South 
Asian countries.5  The main gender challenges relate to women’s access to employment 
opportunities and women’s nutritional status.  Only 32.3 percent of females aged 15 or older

the Pacific (ESCAP) and ADB. 
4 The Gender Inequality Index is a composite measure of reproductive health (maternal mortality ratio and adolescent fertility 
rate); women’s empowerment (share of parliamentary seats held by women; and female secondary and tertiary educational 
attainment rates); and labor participation (share of women in the labor force). United Nations 2008. 
5The OECD index looks at family law, civil liberties, physical integrity (including violence against women), son preference and 
ownership rights.

participate in the labor force.6  Poor nutritional status of women is particularly severe in estate 
areas:  the percentage of women with low body mass index is nearly 48 percent in estate areas, 
compared to 23 percent of rural areas, and just 12 percent in urban areas. Poor nutritional status 
of women reduces the woman’s own quality of life as well as her earning capacity and the health 
of her children.  (See Annex 18: Gender Issues in Sri Lanka.) 

10. 
Sri Lanka’s changing demographics – the aging and urbanization of the population 
– is having dramatic impacts on education and health as well as the economy.  By 2036, 
more than 22 percent of the population will be over 60 and there will be 61 dependents per 100 
adults.  Unless labor force and employment rates increase, a very small number of employed 
persons will need to provide for a very large number of non-working persons – straining the 
budgets of families and Government.  As the population becomes older and has a higher income, 
the types of public services required will change.  The education system will need to give 
increasing emphasis on computer, English and higher level cognitive skills.  The health system 
will need to focus more on non-communicable diseases.7  Social protection for the elderly will 
need to be enhanced.  Increasing urbanization will require investments in mass transit and 
expanded water and sewage networks.         

11. 
Unemployment rates have fallen since the end of the conflict.  As of second quarter of 
2011, unemployment was only 4.2 percent.  Unemployment rates are higher among youth, 
women and the more educated: the unemployment rate was 7.6 percent among those 25-29 years 
old, 7.0 percent among women, and 7.8 percent among those with A-Level education and 
above.8 More than half (about 55 percent) of the employed population works as a paid 
employee9, although even among this group, a large share is in the informal sector.10 

12. 
Poverty rates have fallen from 15 percent of the population in 2006/7 to 9 percent in 
2009/10.11  The most dramatic decline has been in the estate sector (from 32 percent to 11 
percent) following a major wage increase at the beginning of 2010.  Remaining concentrations of 
poverty are not limited to a single part of the country: the four districts with the highest poverty 
rates are Batticaloa (20 percent) in the east, Jaffna (16 percent) in the north, Moneragala 15 
percent in the south-east and Badulla (13 percent) in the south-east.12  Inequality of consumption 
declined between 2006/7 and 2009/10, with the Gini index falling from 0.40 to 0.36 and the 
quintile ratio falling from 6.7 to 5.7.     

6 Female labor force participation is highest (50.2 percent) among those aged 40-44 years as of second quarter 2011.  Female 
labor force participation rates would be somewhat higher if the large number of Sri Lankan women working outside the country 
(primarily as housekeepers) were included.  
7 Non-communicable diseases  are those diseases that are not transmissible from one person to another, including a wide array of 
health conditions such as injuries, mental health problems, disabilities, cardio-vascular diseases, endocrine disorders such as 
diabetes mellitus, non-infectious respiratory diseases such as asthma, degenerative diseases of old age, and cancers. 
8 The Advanced Level General Certificate of Education, commonly referred to as an A-level, is a qualification offered by 
education institutions in Sri Lanka and other Commonwealth Countries.  A-levels are studied over a two-year period and are 
recognized as the standard for assessing the suitability of applicants for academic courses in universities. 
9 The remainder work as entrepreneurs or unpaid family workers.

11 These numbers are based on the national poverty line.  Poverty rates are calculated separately for urban, rural and estate 
(plantation) sectors.  World Bank estimates using international poverty lines find that as of 2007, 7 percent of Sri Lankans were 
below the US$ 1.25 line and 29 percent of Sri Lankans were below the US$ 2.00 line.

Economic Context and Recent Economic Developments 

13. 
The Sri Lankan economy grew at a vigorous 8.3 percent during 2011, largely due to 
the post-conflict rebound.  Sri Lanka was able to maintain relatively strong growth of about 5 
percent per year even during the war, though growth dropped to 3.5 percent in 2009 during the 
last stage of the conflict, which coincided with the international economic crisis.  The post-
conflict rebound has helped all sectors, both on the supply side and the demand side.  
Agricultural land in conflict-affected areas could once again be cultivated; double shifts in 
manufacturing became possible as workers no longer had to worry about security restrictions. 
Domestic consumers’ and investors’ confidence revived, and services related to tourism picked 
up as tourist arrivals surged since the end of the war.   

14. 
Sri Lanka has been experiencing an increase in the trade deficit, estimated to be 
about 17 percent of GDP in 2011.  Goods exports declined as a share of GDP from 30 percent 
in 2001 to 18 percent by 2011. Sri Lanka’s low share of GDP from exports is not an outlier in the 
world perspective, but as an economy with a relatively small domestic population, with a 
favorable geographic location as a trade hub and close proximity to fast growing markets, Sri 
Lanka’s exports are below potential.  Although exports have increased, they have not kept pace 
with the surge in imports.  Increased imports reflected a rapid rise in consumer imports, tied to 
the rising income of the population; increased investment goods imports to support infrastructure 
development; and an increasing bill for intermediate goods imports due to higher commodity 
prices, notably oil.  

15. 
The trade deficit has been financed largely by remittances (about 9 percent of GDP 
in 2011) and to a lesser extent by tourism receipts (1.5 percent of GDP in 2011).  In 2010 the 
trade deficit was comfortably financed by remittances and tourism.  However, despite strong 
remittances and tourism, the large increase in the trade deficit resulted in a more than doubling of 
the current account deficit and a rapid decline in foreign reserves in 2011.  In February of 2012, 
the authorities introduced a package of measures to rein in the current account deficit, stem the 
reserve loss, bolster fiscal performance and increase the sustainability of growth.  These 
measures included monetary and credit policy tightening, petroleum and electricity price 
increases, a petroleum tax increase and the abolishment of the rupee trading band to allow the 
exchange rate to adjust more flexibly.  At the same time, the authorities increased the kerosene 
coupons available to the poorest in order to mitigate the adverse impact on that group.     

16. 
The public debt and deficit have been gradually brought down.  Public debt is 
estimated at 79 percent of GDP as of December 2011, compared to nearly 91 percent of GDP in 
2005.13  The fiscal deficit excluding grants reached 10.4 percent of GDP in 2009, but the 
authorities made significant stabilization efforts under the IMF program since then to gradually 
reduce it to an estimated 6.9 percent of GDP in 2011.14  The debt sustainability analysis 
performed by the IMF in 2010 found the public debt to be sustainable and projects it to decline to 

13 Domestic public debt is currently about 44 percent of GDP. 
14 Reduced fiscal deficit was accomplished in large part through higher receipts from import duties, VAT and excise taxes.

64 percent of GDP by 2015, assuming 6.5 to 7 percent annual growth, 6 to 7 percent nominal 
interest rates and continuous fiscal stabilization efforts.   

17. 
Inflation remains low.  Having reached 22.6 percent (annual average) in 2008, inflation 
has fallen to about 6.0 percent in 2011.  Monetary policy has been accommodative since the start 
of the global economic crisis.15  Strong credit expansion since 2009 has helped stimulate 
domestic demand. After falling by 5.8 percent in 2009, credit to the private sector increased by 
24.9 percent in 2010 and about 33 percent in 2011 year-on-year.  In its recent report, the Fitch 
ratings agency has warned that such fast credit growth, if maintained, and fast rising asset prices 
may be putting the financial system at risk.16  To address such concerns, the Central Bank of Sri 
Lanka recently raised policy interest rates.17 This move is expected to reduce growth in private 
sector credit and domestic demand and reduce emerging risks to the financial sector.

IMF and World Bank Group staff estimates 

18. 
Sri Lanka entered into a US$ 2.6 billion IMF Stand-By-Arrangement in July 2009.  
The program aims to put Sri Lanka on a sustainable growth path, rebuild foreign exchange 
reserves, strengthen the fiscal position, bring down inflation and strengthen the financial 
system.  In April, 2012, the Executive Board of the IMF completed the seventh review of Sri 
Lanka’s economic performance and disbursed SDR 275.6 million (about US$ 426.8 million) 
brining total disbursements under the arrangement to about US$ 2.13 billion. In addition, the 
Executive Board approved an extension of the arrangement period to July 23, 2012, to allow 
time for the completion of the eighth and final review.

Economic Outlook 

19. 
The Government’s strategy aims at eight percent annual real growth over the 
medium term.  Whereas the recent growth has been achieved in large part due to the one-time 
benefits of the end of the conflict, sustaining strong growth will require continued efforts to 
increase investment and raise productivity.  To date, both domestic private investment and FDI 
have been well below desired levels: domestic private investment was 20.1 percent of GDP and 
FDI was 0.9 percent of GDP in 2010.18 Improvements in the investment climate will be essential 
to achieving sustained growth, and investor confidence is expected to continue to depend heavily 
on predictability of the policy environment.  In addition to high investment ratios, total factor 
productivity increases will be crucial, particularly as the share of the population of working age 
declines.  Increases in productivity will depend in large part on opening up the economy, a 
higher exposure to global knowledge and innovation, and general progress in the efficiency of 
production processes.19  

20. Over the CPS period, both exports and imports of goods are expected to grow 
rapidly.  As imports will start from a higher base, the merchandise trade deficit is expected to 
widen and remittances will continue to be a major source of financing.  Imports are expected to 
increase in investment goods and intermediate goods as the economy rebuilds following the 
conflict, as well as in consumer goods, as an increasingly wealthy population demands a wider 
range of imported products.  There are several potential areas for increased exports, including 
expanding labor intensive production (e.g. garments) as China moves out of these markets.  The 
risks of declining export demand if the economies of Europe and the U.S. remain sluggish could 
be mitigated by completion of the trade agreement with India and expansion of exports to other 
fast growing developing countries.20  A simpler trade regime has the potential to improve the 
trade balance. Continued exchange rate flexibility will also be important to maintain macro 
stability (including rebuilding international reserves) and to maintain competitiveness. The 
Central Bank’s announcement in February 2012 that it will reduce intervention in the foreign 
exchange market is a positive sign.     

21. 
Sri Lanka’s fiscal balance and debt situation is expected to continue to improve, 
assuming continued efforts to enhance revenues, reign in expenditures and strengthen debt 
management.  The medium term fiscal framework relies heavily on revenue growth.  There 
is considerable room for revenue growth, given that current levels (about 16 percent of GDP in 
2011) are low by international standards and compared to levels achieved in the 1980s (about 23 
percent of GDP).  Important reforms were enacted last year, simplifying the tax regime and 
broadening the base, in an effort to increase revenues.  Persistent inefficiencies in tax collection 
and widespread tax evasion, however, have meant that revenues have been slow to rise.  Progress 

18 The official numbers for 2011 are not yet publically available. 
19 Recent analytical work finds that the two main constraints to labor productivity in Sri Lanka are: (i) low competition with 
foreign firms (i.e. insufficient incentives to produce efficiently) and (ii) low share of investment financed externally (i.e. 
insufficient exposure to state-of-the art global knowledge).  See Dutz and O’Connell (2011), “The Business Environment, 
Productivity and Innovation in Sri Lanka: An Empirical Exploration”  
20 Sri Lanka relies heavily on European demand for its merchandise exports as well as service exports (tourism). Thirty five 
percent of goods exports go to Europe and 37 percent of tourist arrivals come from Europe.

is expected going forward as the tax administration is modernized.21   Expenditures are expected 
to remain flat as a share of GDP despite pressure to increase public investment on infrastructure 
and to increase the remuneration of civil servants.  Continued efforts to increase efficiency of 
public spending, 
including 
improving value-for-money from public procurement and 
management reforms in SOEs, will be essential.  Government plans to improve the flow of 
reliable and timely information on budgets and outcomes are expected to improve the quality of 
budgetary decision making and confidence in sound policy making.  Interest payments on public 
debt continue to absorb more than a third of recurrent expenditure.22  Despite its improved 
sovereign credit rating, Sri Lanka is vulnerable to increased costs of borrowing because overall 
debt remains high.23 

22. 
Inflation is expected to remain moderate over the CPS period.24  The increased cost 
of imports (due to a weaker rupee) is expected to be offset by lower domestic food prices (thanks 
to increased production).  Risks to inflation remain, however, if investment does not increase fast 
enough to avoid an overheating of the economy.   

II. 

COUNTRY VISION, ACHIEVEMENTS AND CHALLENGES 

23. 
The Mahinda Chintana Vision for the Future lays out the Government’s vision for 
development over the period of 2010 to 2016.  The Mahinda Chintana describes three goals.  
The first is the doubling of per capita income between 2009 and 2016 to be achieved through 
sustained high economic growth, driven by a high investment rate.  Second is the shifting of the 
structure of the economy to be more knowledge-based, globally integrated and competitive, 
environmentally friendly, internally integrated and increasingly urban.  And third is ensuring 
improved living standards and social inclusion.   

A.   

Doubling Per Capita Income through Investment 

24. 
The Government’s Vision, lays out a consistent set of macroeconomic goals.  In 
particular, the Mahinda Chintana seeks to double per capita income, to about US$ 4,000 between 
2009 and 2016.  Accomplishing this will require about 8 percent GDP growth, which would in 
turn require investment of 33-35 percent of GDP per year.25  The Government plans include 
public investment of 6-7 percent of GDP, as the maximum affordable given the fiscal and debt 
situation.  The remaining investment would need to come from the private sector.   

21 An ongoing project financed by the Asian Development Bank is computerizing tax records and collection procedures. 
22 Interest expenditure accounts for a one third of total recurrent expenditure.  Yield rates on government short to medium term 
securities having risen considerable since the third quarter of 2011. 
23 Costs of borrowing could rise if improvements in the sovereign credit rating were reversed or if international credit markets 
contracted as a result of ongoing problems in Europe. 
24 In the near term, inflation could increase.  The Government raised retail prices of gasoline, diesel and kerosene by 9 percent, 38 
percent and 49 percent respectively in February 2012.  In addition, electricity fuel surcharges were also raised between 15-40 
percent in February (to take into account increased cost of thermal power generation) while transport fares in the privatized bus 
companies were also increased by 20 percent.  These one-time increases in energy prices are expected to result in increases in 
food and other products over the coming months. 
25 Achieving this level of per capita income by 2016 is consistent with assumptions for annual population growth of 1 percent, 
annual inflation of 2 percent and an annual appreciation of the rupee against the dollar of 1.6 %.

25. While the growth target was met for 2010 and 2011, as a result of the post conflict 
rebound, sustaining this growth will require a substantial increase in investment.  Public 
investment came close to the target in 2010 and 2011, at 5.8 and 6.0 percent of GDP 
respectively.26  The main challenge in this regard will be sustaining the high rate of public 
investment over the medium term given the tight fiscal space.  The Mahinda Chintana proposes 
to bring the fiscal deficit to 5 percent of GDP by 2013 and maintain it at that level over the 
medium term.  This goal is achievable but will require significant effort on both revenues and 
expenditures.  At about 16 percent of GDP in 2011, revenues are low by international standards 
and well below the 23 percent Sri Lanka had in the 1980s.27  The budget for 2011 simplified and 
reduced taxes and broadened the base, in the hopes that this will boost receipts.  Further tax 
regulation changes could enhance incentives for productive investment and reduce distortions.  
In addition, increased efficiency in tax collection and improved efforts to address the tax evasion 
are needed if revenues are to reach the targeted levels for 2012 and beyond.  While revenues 
have been low, expenditures have been high (about 22 percent of GDP in 2011) due to the high 
level of investments in post war reconstruction and infrastructure modernization, transfers to 
loss-making State Owned Enterprises, a large wage bill and high interest payments on debt.  The 
Mahinda Chintana identifies several important governance-related opportunities to increase 
efficiency of public spending.  These include establishing a clear system for assessing costs and 
benefits of investments, reforming management and improving efficiency of State Owned 
Enterprises28 and improving the flow of budget information.  Improvements in efficiency will 
also require continued efforts to improve financial management and procurement practices and to 
improve alignment of available resources of provincial and local authorities with the mandates 
they have been given.  Sri Lanka’s ability to borrow to finance public investment has improved 
since the end of the war thanks to increased creditworthiness, as reflected in sovereign credit 
ratings.  Nevertheless, borrowing costs could increase if there are problems in the international 
financial markets (e.g. related to the Eurozone crisis) or if credit ratings are not maintained. 

26. 
Private investment has fallen far short of the amount needed to sustain growth.  
With private investment at 22 percent of GDP in 2010, total investment reached only 26 percent 
of GDP – far below the required 33-35 percent.  Foreign Direct Investment has also been 
disappointing.  Foreign Direct Investment is not only important for increasing total investment 
but also as a key source of global knowledge and technology.  Achieving the private investment 
target will require concerted efforts to improve the investment climate.  The World Bank 
Group’s Doing Business Indicators have identified areas of weakness including enforcing 
contracts, paying taxes, registering property, and obtaining construction permits.  An interagency 
committee has been following up on reforms in these areas with the aim of achieving a 30th place 
ranking in Doing Business.  A recently conducted survey of Sri Lankan businesses indicates that 

26 Pubic investment numbers provided are capital investment numbers as reported by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka. 
27 This decline is mainly attributed to the gradual removal of export related taxes, which was a significant source of revenue until 
the end of the 1980s. 
28 Off budget financing activities are relatively low and loss-making state enterprises are financed mostly by direct transfers from 
the budget.  The bulk of state-owned enterprise debt is from Ceylon Petroleum Corporation and Ceylon Electricity Board. Efforts 
are ongoing to try to help these enterprises break even.  However, these enterprises and the country public finances will remain 
vulnerable unless Sri Lanka implements a price-setting mechanism that allows the full recovery of input prices.  The recent 
revisions in energy prices are a positive move in this direction.  The banking system poses modest contingent liabilities to the 
government, with adequate capitalization ratios and improving nonperforming loans.  The Mahinda Chintana states that all SOEs 
will develop corporate mandates, all Board members will enter into performance contracts, and all SOE activities will be 
disclosed to the public by adopting a sound reporting system based on international best practices.

the biggest obstacles faced are access to finance, taxes, unfair advantages of the informal 
sector,29the formal/informal sector dichotomy, electricity,  labor force skill mismatches, and 
access to land.  

B.  

Shifting the Structure of the Economy 

27. 
Sri Lanka has a generally well educated population for its income level, but faces 
challenges in becoming a knowledge-based economy.  Sri Lanka does well in terms of access 
to education and completion rates.30  At the same time, however, employers complain that they 
are unable to find workers with the needed skills – especially information technology, English 
language, and soft skills (e.g. problem-solving skills, good communication and ability to work in 
teams). Although efforts have been made to introduce these skills into the curriculum, the 
emphasis on testing factual knowledge in the assessment system has meant that few resources are 
spent on the new skill curriculum.  Moreover, addressing the knowledge-economy will require 
creation of a dynamic system in which curriculum focuses on higher level cognitive skills and a 
feedback mechanism to adjust to changes in the needs of the labor market.  In addition, in light 
of the long-lasting impacts on both cognitive and non-cognitive skills, early childhood education 
needs attention.  Keeping up with technology will be a particular challenge: information and 
communications technology adoption is identified as a weakness in both the Global 
Competitiveness Index31 and the Global Innovation Index.  According to the Telecom 
Regulatory Commission, internet use at 12 percent of the population in 2010 is below the 
average for countries at Sri Lanka’s income level.   

28. 
The Mahinda Chintana aims to increase Sri Lanka’s integration into the global 
economy and make it competitive internationally.  Historically, Sri Lanka has been well 
connected internationally, making use of its excellent climate and strategic geographic position 
between the west and the east, and was considered the most open economy in South Asia.  Over 
the past decade however, Sri Lanka has become less competitive, with the exports declining from 
39 percent of GDP in 2000 to 17 percent in 2011.  Although the high-end apparel sector has 
performed well and the number of tourist arrivals has increased dramatically since the end of the 
conflict,32 several challenges remain.  The tourist industry competes with other destinations that 
offer very high value for money.  High tech exports represented less than one percent of 
in 2010.33 Sri Lanka’s high exchange rate has hurt export 
manufacturing exports 
competitiveness, particularly as the currencies of several nearby countries have devalued in the 
past year.34  The agricultural export sector (including tea, historically a main export) operates 
well below potential due to low productivity; and complex, frequently changing, anti-export 
trade and pricing policies.  In terms of the Logistics Performance Index, Sri Lanka ranks below 

29 The formal or registered companies are perceived to be adversely affected by the informal or unregistered companies since 
they are not required to obtain various regulatory approvals and can evade taxes and also avoid maintaining accounts. 
30 Primary completion rates are above 97 percent and secondary school enrollment is over 85 percent.   
31 The Global Competitiveness Index measures the speed with which an economy adopts existing technologies to enhance the 
productivity of its industries, with specific emphasis on its capacity to fully use ICT in daily activities and production processes 
for increased efficiency and competitiveness.   
32 Tourism receipts increased from US$ 380 million in 2008 to US$ 576 million in 2010 to about US$ 800 million in 2011. 
33 World Development Indicators. 
34 Unfolding events in Europe caused a retreat out of developing countries and into “safe haven” U.S. assets.  As a result, 
currencies of Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, and others around the world depreciated sharply against the dollar.

the regional average, reflecting poorly developed railways and congested access to major ports, 
as well as problems in customs clearance times, logistical competence, and the ability to track 
shipments.  The Government strategy aims to reverse these negative trends and make Sri Lankan 
exports highly competitive.     

29. 
Sri Lanka has a wealth of environmental assets, boasting the highest biodiversity 
per square kilometer in Asia.  During the conflict, the slow pace of economic development 
meant that degradation was slower than it otherwise might have been.  Mahinda Chintana goals 
for 2016 include raising forest coverage from 23 percent to 35 percent of the land area.  Despite 
official recognition of the importance of protecting environmental assets, the country’s 
performance on environmental sustainability has not been fully satisfactory.  In fact, Sri Lanka 
risks losing many of its assets and biodiversity, as demonstrated by a recent survey that found 
that 33 percent of fauna and 61 percent of flora are threatened.  Thirty five percent of old growth 
forest cover has been lost since 1990 – among the highest in the region – further increasing the 
challenge of meeting Government targets.  Moreover, environmental neglect can directly and 
indirectly impact economic performance, and the rate and sustainability of long term growth.   

30. 
For generations, Sri Lanka’s population has been more internally mobile than most 
countries, on account of the extensive network of roads, buses and railways and relatively 
compact geographic territory.35  During the war, much of this infrastructure was damaged and 
attention was not given to modernizing or even maintaining the infrastructure.  Today, road 
travel within the country is very slow with average speed of only 26 kilometers an hour.  A 
massive effort is currently underway to bridge the infrastructure gap, using domestic budget as 
well as support from the multilateral and bilateral community.  The country’s first expressway 
opened in 2011, halving travel time from Colombo to Galle.  Nevertheless, challenges remain.  
More needs to be done to understand and enhance the economic connections across the country 
to take advantage of forward and backward linkages in supply chains and of distinct comparative 
advantages of different parts of the country.36   

C.  

Improved Living Standards and Social Inclusion 

31. Mahinda Chintana aims to ensure that all social groups benefit from the growth 
envisaged above. With a long history of attention to access to basic services, Sri Lanka excels 
for its income level on most social indicators.  This includes life expectancy, education, births 
attended by a skilled professional, access to improved water source, and other key indicators.   

32. 
Although Sri Lanka excels in most social indicators, malnutrition is a striking 
exception.  About 22 percent of Sri Lankan children under 5 are underweight, as against the 14 
percent expected for Sri Lanka’s income level.  That malnutrition has persisted even as the GDP 
per capita has increased reflects the complexity of the problem.  Tackling malnutrition will 
require a combination of actions involving healthcare, food security, water and sanitation, 
attitudes and behaviors. 

35 As of 2010, there were 1.7 km of road per km2 and 97 percent of villages are reached by the road network.  As of 2000, 86 
percent of the roads were paved. 
36 Based on current trends of urbanization and policies that support private vehicle ownership over mass transit, congestion rates 
are expected to increase dramatically over the coming decade. By 2031 travel speed is expected to decline to 19 kilometers an 
hour, with rush hour in Colombo District falling to below 9 kilometers per hour.

33. 
As Sri Lanka becomes a middle income country, new challenges emerge related to 
the interrelated phenomenon of increased wealth, changing age structure of the population 
and increasing urbanization.  As the population becomes wealthier, citizens expect a higher 
quality and wider range of services and lower waiting times.  The type of services needed also 
evolves with the changing diseases and the aging of the population: the health system, for 
example, must build capacity to address non-communicable diseases associated with a wealthier, 
more urban lifestyle (e.g. chronic conditions like diabetes and traffic accidents) and with an older 
population (e.g. geriatric care).37  The social security system needs to be made sustainable.  And 
the population density associated with urbanization requires improved network services (e.g. 
mass transit and water and sewerage networks). 

34. While increasing the quality of public services is an essential priority, it must be 
achieved in a manner that is fair to all citizens.  Whereas post-conflict resettlement and 
reconstruction necessitates a focus on investments in the conflict-affected areas of the north and 
east, service quality modernization necessitates a national approach.  As noted earlier in this 
document, pockets of poverty exist in various parts of the country.  The challenge for service 
quality modernization will be to establish consistent, countrywide standards to support needs 
based resource allocations.   

35. 
Similarly, social inclusion is a high priority in the Mahinda Chintana, including 
addressing issues of youth unemployment, equal employment opportunities for women, 
safety nets for the poor and vulnerable, economic opportunities for the disabled and the 
aspirations of Sri Lanka as a multi-ethnic and multi-lingual country.  As in all countries, 
social inclusion is a challenge that requires continuous effort and the Government is taking steps 
in this direction. The challenges going forward include advancing on the ethnic reconciliation 
agenda and implementing key recommendations of the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation 
Commission. The World Bank will assist the Government to increase social inclusion through 
analytical and advisory work, as well as through specific operations and as a cross-cutting theme 
overall in the portfolio. 

36. 
The Mahinda Chintana emphasizes the importance of women in Sri Lankan society.  
The Ministry of Labor is currently in the process of preparing a strategy to encourage women’s 
employment opportunities.  In the past women working abroad as maids has been the largest 
source of remittances, but there have been several cases of major physical and psychological 
abuse reported.  The Ministry of Foreign Employment Promotion and Welfare has shifted its 
emphasis and is now providing training programs and encouraging women to seek skilled jobs.  
Regarding women’s nutritional status, the Government has introduced a nutritional supplement 
program for mothers and infants, which is well-targeted.    

37 Sri Lanka has the oldest population age composition outside of the Eastern European transition economies.  In two decades Sri 
Lanka’s age profile will be similar to that of Europe and Japan today, but with much lower income to support the large number of 
elderly dependents.

A. 

WORLD BANK GROUP PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY 

Lessons from the CAS Completion Report38 

37. 
The design of CAS FY09-12 reflected country reality at the time it was written.  
Appropriately, the CAS FY09-12 focused on maintaining basic services in the midst of conflict, 
with strong attention to the conflict-affected north and east and other lagging regions and strong 
use of Community Driven Development (CDD) approaches.  Over the course of the CAS FY09-
12, Sri Lanka’s context changed and the program appropriately adapted to those changes. Of the 
15 lending operations that were planned in the CAS, five were dropped and two transformed.  
Meanwhile, four new projects were added and additional financing was provided for three 
projects. Of the 12 Analytic and Advisory Activities (AAA) that were planned in the CAS, three 
were dropped and two refocused.  Meanwhile, four new AAA tasks were added. 

38. 
In many ways, the World Bank was successful in responding to the changing 
priorities.  The lending program responded to urgent needs – including resettlement and floods, 
while still focusing on the conflict and lagging regions.  In other ways, however, the World Bank 
did not fully keep up with the changing issues.  Authorities have noted that the World Bank was 
overly focused on what the Government views as a ‘low income country agenda’, and could have 
moved support to the emerging middle income country agenda, with which the Government has 
less experience. 

39. 
The AAA program was small, and in some cases lacked a clear purpose and 
audience.  Dialogue on policy issues was underdeveloped in most sectors.  This was due to two 
factors.  First, counterparts were primarily focused on engaging the World Bank in infrastructure, 
rather than policy issues.  Second, the World Bank did not keep up with core AAA products 
needed to monitor the evolving situation (e.g. analysis of public expenditures, public financial 
management and poverty).  

40. 
Engagement in education and health was more successful than in other areas.  This 
success was due to several factors: (i) the substantive focus was well-aligned with Government 
priorities; (ii) interaction was sustained through a combination of lending and AAA used to 
inform the dialogue; (iii) sector-wide, results-based approaches were introduced including 
support for strategic planning, monitoring and results-based disbursement; and (iv) interactions 
at both national and sub-national levels.  

41. 
The strategy of channeling resources through the banking system and of 
strengthening the alignment between IFC advisory services and investments worked well. 
Sri Lanka possesses a sound banking system, which both the IFC and the World Bank used 
effectively to channel resources, for instance, to engage the private sector in sustainable energy 
generation and in transferring resources to SMEs during the economic slowdown. The lesson is 
that anchoring support on strong local institutions helps by-pass local capacity constraints.  In 
addition, in line with global guidelines, IFC’s work on the ground stressed the alignment 
between advisory and investment activities.  For instance, in projects such as support to the

Dialog telecommunications company, the advisory intervention broadened the range of benefits 
and beneficiaries that are being supported.  

42. 
The last CAS committed to the use of a Conflict Filter to improve the peace and 
conflict sensitivity of operations.  It was meant to help task teams better understand the 
operating environment at both national and local levels, as well as possible drivers of the conflict 
through deeper analysis on institutions, stakeholders and benefits-sharing.  The Conflict Filter 
analyses have been conducted for all new projects in the current CAS period. The Filter was 
revised during the CAS period to map it to the new Operational Risk Assessment Framework 
(ORAF), which was introduced across the World Bank.   

43. 
It takes longer-than-anticipated time for private sector investment to pick up in 
post-conflict markets.  Expectations for a rapid pick-up in private investments after the conflict 
ended proved to be optimistic.  The corporate/private sector may not have felt comfortable to 
make investments until peace was firmly cemented, including an easing of tensions with the 
international community, and seeing how the new Government would rebuild the ground for the 
private investment.  On the latter, the signals of the Government regarding its commitment to a 
positive investment climate for the private sector have been perceived as mixed by potential 
investors.  The lesson that emerges is that in post-conflict countries stronger and unambiguous 
messages are needed to motivate a strong engagement of the private sector. Going forward 
continued attention to the quality of the broad business environment is needed to enhance the 
opportunities for the private sector support in the country. 

B. 

Findings from the Stakeholder Survey and Consultations39  

44. 
Stakeholder surveys were conducted during the CPS preparation process to 
complement the World Bank’s self-assessed CAS FY09-12 Completion Report.  A 
quantitative Client Survey captured views of 300 respondents.  The survey findings support 
several of the conclusions from the CAS Completion Report.  Although respondents perceived 
the World Bank to be more effective than it was when the survey was last conducted in 2007, 
respondents feel that the World Bank’s focus has not been sufficiently aligned with Sri Lanka’s 
current development priorities, notably middle income country issues.  Respondents also 
indicated a need for an increase in the provision of knowledge and advice.   

45. 
In addition to the quantitative Stakeholder Survey, in-depth interviews were 
conducted by an independent research company with key decision makers, government 
officials, private sector representatives and civil society leaders.  The interviews reinforced 
the conclusions from the quantitative survey.  The World Bank is seen as an organization able to 
catalyze transformational change in Sri Lanka, through combined knowledge and financial 
resources.  Respondents perceive the World Bank to be extremely rigorous in its processes – a 
quality that some see as beneficial, while others felt is overly cumbersome.  Respondents feel 
that in recent years, the World Bank has focused its attention on financing rather than knowledge 
and could play a more proactive, visible role in Sri Lanka’s transformation.   

39 A more detailed description of the consultations is provided as Annex 16.  A more detailed description of the stakeholder 
surveys is provided as Annex 17.

46. 
Consultations were held throughout the CPS preparation process.  A total of 18 
consultations were conducted, involving more than 400 participants including development 
partners, youth, gender and environmental activists, the private sector, Members of Parliament, 
and officials from central, provincial and local government.  The consultations contributed to the 
diagnosis of Sri Lanka’s development challenges and provided an opportunity to obtain feedback 
as the strategy’s objectives, areas of focus, principles and rules of engagement emerged.  
Recurring issues raised in the consultations include: the need to reorient publically provided 
infrastructure and services to the needs of an urbanizing, middle income country;  the 
institutional and financial needs of local and provincial government to allow them to fulfill their 
mandates; the need for increased clarity and consistency of policy vis-à-vis the private sector; the 
need for continued attention to poverty and inequality; the role the World Bank is expected to 
play in wide dissemination of knowledge; and the importance of World Bank coordination with 
other development partners.   

C. 

Assessment of the Current Portfolio 

47. 
The portfolio is generally healthy with no major problems.  The current World Bank 
portfolio consists primarily of International Development Association (IDA) funded projects: the 
first International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) loan was presented to the 
Board in March, 2012.  As of March 31, 2012, the portfolio consisted of 14 projects with a total 
commitment of US$ 1.068 billion40  and a disbursement ratio of 17.9 percent (compared to 15.8 
for South Asia as a whole and 14.9 for the World Bank as a whole.)  Sri Lanka has a high 
percentage of projects at risk41 (21 percent), however measures are being taken to address these 
projects as reflected by the high proactivity index of 100 percent.42   

48. 
The latest portfolio review held in October 2011 identified scope for further 
improvements in several areas including procurement43 and monitoring and evaluation44.    
The overall financial management performance of the Sri Lanka portfolio is satisfactory and the 
fiduciary risk after mitigation is rated as “moderate” for the majority of projects.  Risk in some 
projects have been rated as “high” and “substantial” based on the nature and complexity of 
implementation arrangements, weak implementation capacities of implementing agencies and 
due to their reliance on aspects of the country financial management systems that are still weak.  
With the intention of the Government of Sri Lanka to promote the use of country financial 
management systems to the maximum extent, continued efforts are required to strengthen these 
systems.   

40 The first IBRD loan, the US$ 213 million Metro Colombo Urban Development project, will bring the portfolio to 14 projects. 
41 A project is considered “at risk” if it is not meeting its development objectives.  It is the sum of actual problem projects and 
potential problem projects.  A project is considered a problem project if implementation progress or the development objective is 
rated unsatisfactory in the latest project implementation status report.  Disbursement ratio is defined as the ratio of disbursements 
during the fiscal year to the undisbursed balance at the beginning of the fiscal year.  (Only investment operations are included in 
the calculation.)  The net disconnect is defined as the difference between ratings given by the Internal Evaluation Group and 
those given by the Regions. 
42 The proactivity index gives the percentage of projects rated as actual problem projects 12 months earlier than have been 
upgraded, restructured, suspended, closed or partially (20 percent or more of commitments) or fully canceled.    
43 With regard to procurement of the 13 projects, 5 were satisfactory, 8 were marginally satisfactory and 2 were marginally 
unsatisfactory. 
44 Of the 13 projects, 10 were satisfactory, 4 marginally satisfactory and 1 marginally unsatisfactory.  

14 

 
 
 
 
 
                                                 
 
49. 
The World Bank Group program made significant use of trust fund resources 
during the FY 09-12 CAS period, supporting both analytical work and technical assistance. 
Trust funds have supported activities in a range of areas, from technical assistance on Public 
Private Partnerships for infrastructure development, to avian influenza preparedness, to 
renewable energy. Trust funds have significantly bolstered post-conflict and reconstruction 
efforts, including considerable Australian support for the cash-for-work component of the 
Emergency Northern Recovery Project and the Japan Social Development Fund support for 
nutrition in the Northern Province. They have also afforded meaningful support for the 
Government’s efforts to reform its main safety net program, Samurdhi, as well as for undertaking 
critical post-disaster needs assessments and expanding access to finance for poor women. 
Commitments from trust fund resources over the FY09-12 CAS period have amounted to US$ 
42.2 million, over 39 World Bank operations. IFC's private sector development support benefited 
from donor support, including Norway for the Sri Lanka Development Facility, and The 
Netherlands-IFC Partnership Program and DevCO  for the South Asia Infrastructure Facility.  
Global Environment Facility-backed PADGO (Portfolio Approach to Distributed Generation 
Opportunity) is also supported by Japanese and Irish funds.  Recently, the European Union and 
IFC have strengthened their partnership, and the first such initiative has launched to benefit four 
post-conflict districts.  

50. 
A performance review of the eight ongoing recipient-executed trust-funded activities 
(see Annex 14) identified several areas for increased attention. Among the issues identified 
are delays in effectiveness and implementation, lack of attention to results monitoring and 
evaluation, and high transaction costs for both the Recipient and the World Bank. A specific risk 
associated with the trust fund portfolio has been the limited institutional capacity of recipient 
institutions and the over-burdening of implementing agencies with the administration and 
management of small stand-alone trust funds. This has sometimes resulted in lack of compliance 
with fiduciary requirements, as in the case of the small post-conflict grants.   

51. 
IFC’s portfolio is generally performing well and weathering the global economic 
challenges well.  Two underperforming investments are being monitored closely.  IFC’s ability 
to advise Government agencies on structuring and tendering projects and to fund infrastructure is 
constrained by limitations in the rules and competitive bidding process currently in place. 

D. 

Principles and Rules of Engagement 

52. 
Reflecting on the dialogue with the Government counterparts, consultations with 
stakeholders, and the CAS FY09-12 Completion Report, the World Bank Group has 
agreed on several principles and rules of engagement to guide the new CPS.   

53. 
Focus will be placed on the middle income country agenda.  For many years, Sri 
Lanka has served as an international role model in terms of access to basic services.  As Sri 
Lanka moves into middle income country status, a new set of issues has emerged.  Such issues 
include the fiscal and social impacts of the demographic transition, the Government’s role as 
facilitator/regulator of the private sector as well as direct provider of services, and alignment of 
roles and resources of provincial and local authorities.  Building on the World Bank’s 

15 

 
 
 
 
 
  
 
comparative advantage in analytical work and as an institution working in a wide range of 
middle income countries, the World Bank will increase its efforts to identify the various options 
taken by other countries in the transition, to connect Sri Lankan practitioners with their 
counterparts from other countries. 

54. 
The 2011 World Development Report (WDR) on Conflict, Security and 
Development provides valuable insights and lessons for this CPS.  Sri Lanka emerged from 
26 years of conflict in 2009; however it is important to note that it is not a standard post-conflict, 
fragile country that experienced a substantial breakdown in institutions.  Even during the 
conflict, the public sector continued to function, providing increasingly better services, fostered 
substantial economic growth and the poverty conditions improved.  Nevertheless, many of the 
principles of engagement proposed by the WDR are relevant for Sri Lanka: enhancing political 
and economic inclusion, delivering early results to build public trust and confidence, focusing on 
social accountability 
tools, applying community-driven approaches, and strengthening 
institutions in a phased approach.  This CPS, as well as the past CAS, encompasses these 
principles.  For example, under the last CAS and continuing during this CPS, the World Bank 
has supported the Government's rapid effort to resettle families dislocated by the conflict.  This 
resettlement has helped build confidence in Sri Lanka going forward.  On-going projects in the 
portfolio will continue to support building livelihoods and social capital among the resettled 
communities through a CDM approach.  The CPS addresses social accountability through 
support to Parliamentary oversight committees, works with and strengthens all tiers of 
Government, and emphasizes broadly shared benefits of growth.     

55. 
The CPS is designed to be flexible.  The present document includes an indicative 
pipeline, which will be modified and supplemented during the CPS period.  The World Bank 
Group will use the CPS Progress Report to review alignment of the project /AAA portfolio with 
evolving country needs and Government priorities and to modify program accordingly. 

56. 
Increased attention will be paid to results in all sectors.  Building on successful 
approaches in the education and health sectors, the World Bank will move toward increasing 
emphasis on results in all sectors.  AAA will be used to identify the driving forces and key 
constraints to inform projects design.  Results will also be emphasized in the formation of teams: 
it is anticipated that teams will increasingly need to include staff from more than one sector, and 
often including both the World Bank and IFC.  Recognizing the difficulties inherent in this work, 
the Country Management Unit will play an active role in defining tasks around results and 
providing appropriate incentives and accountability.   

57. 
The Government systems will be used whenever possible and strengthened.  Over the 
upcoming CPS period, increased use of country systems is expected as capacity is built in line 
ministries and provincial and local governments. Where separate the World Bank systems need 
to be maintained, efforts will be made to reconcile the systems and build capacity.  In financial 
management, the World Bank will agree with the Government on steps to increase the use of 
country financial management systems during the CPS period.  Support to the strengthening of 
public audit to enhance the scope and coverage of public audits and to strengthen value added 
audit services will continue.  Re-engaging in activities to strengthen Parliamentary oversight of 
public funds is also expected during the CPS period.  In procurement, the recent portfolio review 

16 

 
 
 
 
 
and procurement assessment have identified scope for improvement.  During the CPS period, 
fiduciary reviews will be conducted with an emphasis on improving the capacity to implement 
procurement in accordance with the national procurement legislation.  The World Bank is also 
working toward mainstreaming project implementation in existing agencies, and move away 
from stand-alone Project Management Units, consistent with Government’s Management 
Circular 33.  For example, in the recently approved Metro Colombo Urban Development Project, 
while a stand-alone Project Management Unit has been established, its mandate is limited to 
fiduciary issues and it is comprised of civil service staff temporarily released from their normal 
duties and paid salaries based on a regulated scale.   

58. 
The pipeline will focus on a small number of large projects.  Given that the 
Government is engaged in a major effort to modernize infrastructure and institutions, human 
capacity in Government agencies is being stretched by high transaction costs.  Similarly, World 
Bank resources for both analytical work and lending will be stretched given the flat budget 
environment to support increasing lending. Under this CPS, lending will be through few, larger 
operations. This allows efficiency in delivery and focus on identified priorities of the 
Government. 

59.  Lending activities and dialogue will involve all relevant tiers of Government.  This 
approach builds on the successes of the previous CAS in supporting capacity building at local, 
provincial and central levels in projects including North and East Local Services Improvement, 
Higher Education for the Twenty First Century, Provincial Roads, and the Health Sector 
Development Project.  

60. 
Safeguards provide opportunities to support the Mahinda Chintana vision.  For 
example, the World Bank will seek opportunities for projects to actively contribute to the 
Mahinda Chintana goal “to promote sustainable development in close liaison with the land, fauna 
and flora and to bestow our natural heritage to our future generation.”  This approach will 
include efforts to maximize the environmental benefits of projects and to protect investments 
through integrated disaster risk management.  Similar efforts will be made on other safeguards as 
well.   

61.  Analytical and advisory activities will be used strategically to support the CPS areas 
of focus.  All potential AAAs will have clearly defined purpose and audience.  AAA will be used 
to inform planned lending activities, to support dialogue in key policy areas where no lending 
activities have been planned and to fill gaps in the World Bank Group’s own knowledge, and  
due diligence.   

62. 
Increased attention will be paid to communication.  In addition to requesting the 
World Bank to provide more analytical work, respondents in the Stakeholder Surveys requested 
the World Bank to play a more visible and active role in broad knowledge dissemination and 
stimulating public debate on development issues.  Going forward, consistent with the Access to 
Information Policy, the World Bank will increase the attention paid to dissemination of the 
messages of analytical work to a wide audience including Government counterparts, Parliament, 
think tanks and others.  Increased attention will also be paid to communication with the media. 

17 

 
 
 
 
 
 
Greater emphasis will be placed on translating materials into Sinhala and Tamil and 
communicating with the Sinhala and Tamil media.  (See Annex 17 on communication.)   

E. 

Country Partnership Strategy Areas of Focus 

63. 
This Country Partnership Strategy provides support to address the challenges for 
achieving the three main goals of the Government’s Mahinda Chintana Vision for the 
Future.  For each of the three central goals of the Government’s vision, the CPS lays out 
the key areas of engagement in which the World Bank Group support can most effectively 
address the challenges identified in the Section II of this document.   In particular, the CPS 
focuses on specific topics of the World Bank comparative advantage, with an emphasis on the 
middle income country agenda, the role of the private sector, and institutional and policy issues, 
and ensuring broadly shared benefits of growth.  The CPS is organized as follows: 

Area 1: Facilitating sustained private and public investment 
A:  Improving the investment climate 
B: Increasing fiscal space and the efficiency of public spending  

Area 2: Supporting structural shifts in the economy 
A: Supporting the shift to a knowledge-based economy 
B:  Boosting international integration and competitiveness 
C: Supporting the internal integration of the economy 

Area 3: Improving living standards and social inclusion 
A: Increasing quality of services 
B: Reducing the prevalence of malnutrition 
C: Expanding social inclusion and equitable access 

64. 
IFC’s focus areas during FY 13-16 will be fully aligned with the CPS and will be 
consistent with IFC’s Regional Strategy in South Asia, which emphasizes: i) Inclusive 
Growth; ii) Climate Change; and iii) Regional/Global Integration.  While all of the three 
pillars support Area 1 of this CPS, the inclusive growth emphasis focuses on making an impact 
on the base of the pyramid, low income households through access to finance, infrastructure, 
social services and markets.  This focus especially supports the outcomes set in the Areas 2 and 3 
of the CPS described.  The climate change emphasis supports renewable energy (hydro, solar, 
biomass, and wind), energy efficiency, and agricultural and irrigation efficiency activities, which 
are expected to result in reduced carbon footprints.  This focus is aligned with Area 2.  Finally, to 
promote integration, IFC supports South-South investments, knowledge transfer, improvements 
in the investment climate, and trade and logistics.  This focus is in line with Areas 1 and 2 of the 
CPS.  

Area 1: Facilitating sustained private and public investment

The first CPS area, facilitating sustained private and public investment, provides 
support to the Mahinda Chintana goal of doubling per capita income through sustained 

18 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
growth.  The main challenges to achieving this goal relate to increasing private investment and 
making public investment sustainable.   

Area 1A: Improving the investment climate 

66. 
The World Bank Group will support the Government’s efforts to improving the 
investment climate.45 The Government has requested financial assistance to support regulatory 
aspects of investment climate reforms.  Potential areas for engagement include improving the 
business environment, enhancing investor confidence, and business-related legal and judicial 
reforms.  The requested assistance is likely to include a multi-sector Development Policy Loan 
and an Investment Loan supporting the legal and judicial sector. 

67. 
An enterprise perception survey of Sri Lankan firms was conducted in 2011 to 
gauge the constraints hindering the performance of firms.  The findings of the survey 
revealed that the major constraints encountered by firms are access to finance, informal practices 
by firms, electricity and tax rates.  The World Bank Group will continue to provide support to 
the Doing Business Committee (convened by the Central Bank and chaired by the Minister of 
Economic Development) as it facilitates the implementation of priority reforms.  In particular, 
trust fund resources will be sought to connect relevant agencies to their counterparts in countries 
that have worked on similar reforms through a South-South Knowledge Exchange and other 
mechanisms.  Trust fund resources will also be sought to provide support to development of the 
capital market for financial sector deepening and improving access.  Ongoing projects include 
the Small and Medium Enterprise Development Facility (improving access to finance for Small 
and Medium Enterprises affected by the global financial crisis), the Sustainable Tourism Project 
(supporting environmentally and socially sound investments in tourism) and the Warehouse 
Receipts Trust Fund (providing farmers with access to storage and collateral needed for access to 
finance).     

68. 
The World Bank will continue its support to the increased adoption of International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and International Audit Standards in the private 
sector.  Well defined standards and practices in Financial Reporting and Auditing in enhancing 
the quality of corporate governance and ability of the country to attract foreign investments will 
be critical. Following up on the recommendations of the Report on the Observation of Standards 
and Codes for Accounting and Auditing (ROSC A&A) diagnostic carried out by the World Bank 
(2004), support is being provided to the Institute of Chartered Accountants Sri Lanka through an 
Institutional Development Fund grant for enabling the adoption of International Financial 
Reporting Standards to small and medium enterprises and State Owned Enterprises as well as for 
improving the quality of audit practices.  Support will be provided to oversight institutions like 
the Sri Lanka Accounting and Auditing Standards Monitoring Board that will help to improve 
the transparency and accountability in the private sector. Considering the changes and 
improvements that have happened internally and externally since the last ROSC A&A Report for 
Sri Lanka; an update of the diagnostic is planned to facilitate targeted support to emerging areas 
relating to the strengthening of corporate governance and financial management in the private 
sector. 

45 Improvements in the investment climate will not only help increase total investment but also encourage foreign direct 
investment – a key source for global knowledge and technology.

69. 
Through its investment and advisory products, IFC will seek to promote private 
sector investment and work with the World Bank and the Government on the related 
agenda.  To help Sri Lanka maintain strong economic outlook despite expected slow growth in 
the global economy in at least the initial part of the CPS period, it is critical to improve the 
investment climate by facilitating Government efforts on the comprehensive framework and fair 
rules to enable increased participation by the private sector.  Complementing the World Bank’s 
support for legal and judicial reform, IFC plans to support the supply side by promoting 
transparency in the private sector and helping to clarify the private sector’s role, which can 
increase investor comfort level.  In addition to supporting Doing Business, IFC will look for 
opportunities to improve regulations that constrain the financial sector, tourism and agribusiness. 
IFC will also seek to catalyze investments through directly investing in important projects in key 
economic sectors including the financial sector, tourism, agribusiness and infrastructure.  IFC’s 
advisory program will expand its support for firm level capacity building in priority sectors. 
Capacity building in the financial sector will facilitate increased access to financial services for 
micro, small and medium enterprises as well as promoting low carbon growth.  In the tourism 
and agribusiness sectors, IFC will also combine investment and a range of advisory activities – 
promoting sustainable practices, supply chain strengthening, particularly for small and medium 
enterprises, and regulatory improvement.  To promote competitive and sustainable business 
practices, all IFC investments will provide assessment and advice on environmental and social 
standards and require IFC’s Performance Standard to be met.  IFC also provides a corporate 
governance analysis of clients as a part of a new investment due diligence and will explore 
possibilities of providing more programmatic corporate governance assistance. 

Area 1B: Increasing fiscal space and the efficiency of public spending 

70. 
The World Bank will support the Government’s efforts to maintain the high levels 
of public investment in a sustainable manner.  As a first step, the World Bank will provide 
analytical support in the form of a Public Expenditure Review (PER), which will examine budget 
allocations across sectors, contingent liability issues related to State Owned Enterprises, the 
extent to which revenue policies are achieving their objectives, and a Public Expenditure and 
Financial Accountability report (PEFA) that will examine the performance of budget formulation 
and execution process and which will benchmark Sri Lanka against other middle income 
countries.  AAA will also be provided to outline alternative financing arrangements for public 
infrastructure and services (including Public Private Partnerships) and the pros and cons of the 
various options.  An existing activity, “Building Media and Civil Society Capacity for Budget 
Transparency” is supported by the Social Development Civil Society Trust Fund.  A proposed 
Development Policy Loan is expected to include aspects of public financial management, 
building on the engagement begun during the CAS FY09-12 and including increasing efficiency 
of public spending in line ministries and State Owned Enterprises, as well as aspects of the 
investment climate (as described in paragraph69).   

71. 
Following up the public private partnership workshop organized by the World 
Bank Group in December 2010, IFC is prepared to continue to collaborate with the World 
Bank and Government partners to further develop a competitive Public Private 
Partnership framework in Sri Lanka.  This would include supporting the Government in 
20 

 
 
 
 
 
 
structuring specific PPP projects and bidding these on a transparent, competitive basis in line 
with international best practice.  This would help free up public sector resources and ensure that 
Sri Lanka benefits from private sector efficiency and cutting-edge practices. 

Area 2: Supporting structural shifts in the economy 

72. 
The second CPS area supports the Mahinda Chintana goal of shifting the economy 
to be more knowledge-based, globally integrated and competitive, internally integrated, 
increasingly urban and environmentally friendly.  

Area 2A: Supporting the shift to a knowledge-based economy 

73. 
The World Bank will support the Government’s efforts to shift toward a knowledge-
based economy.46  In addition to the ongoing lending activities on Higher Education for the 
Twenty First Century, the E-Sri Lanka project, and the Trust Fund for Information and 
Communications Technology Regulatory Capacity Building, two additional lending activities 
have been requested.  The proposed skills development project aims to enhance the relevance of 
training programs for the needs of the labor market. AAA task on skills development and another 
specifically examining skills training for women are ongoing and will support preparation of this 
project.  The proposed innovation and research project aims to encourage private sector 
innovation and technology adoption.  AAA on middle income approaches to innovation and 
technology adoption will be conducted in advance of project design.  IFC seeks to continue to 
provide support in this area through capacity building for financial institutions and skills training 
in partnership with companies to strengthen the performance of SMEs.  IFC will continue to 
introduce innovative products to improve funding flows to Sri Lanka, such as a diversified-
payments loan committed in FY12. These products can help lower the cost of financing for 
financial institutions and their customers, thus boosting competitiveness. 

Area 2B:  Boosting international integration and competitiveness 

74. 
The World Bank Group will support Sri Lanka’s international integration and 
competitiveness through AAA activities.  These activities include an analysis of policy options 
for improving the trade balance and an analysis of Sri Lanka’s potential to become an 
international hub for naval, aviation and commercial services. IFC will seek opportunities to 
support South-South investments into and from Sri Lanka and help catalyze foreign investments.   

Area 2C: Supporting the internal integration of the economy 

75. 
The World Bank Group will support the Government’s efforts to enhance Sri 
Lanka’s urban areas and support internal integration.  A proposed project would provide a 
package of investments which would support economic connectivity and provide infrastructure 
services appropriate for rapidly growing secondary cities.  Analytical work to better understand 

46 Sustained long term growth will require increases in productivity as well as increased investment.  Education is important not 
only for direct increases in productivity but also as a prerequisite for innovation and technology adoption. 

21 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                 
economic drivers and connectivity with the national economy will be conducted to help inform 
project design.  In addition, IFC is currently preparing an economic development project to be 
funded by the European Union, complementing the World Bank’s support for in-country 
integration.  The project, also supporting Area 3, is designed to focus on four conflict affected 
districts of Mannar and Vavuniya in the north and Batticaloa and Ampara in the east, improving 
the business environment, local employment and micro and small enterprise development. 

76. 
The Mahinda Chintana advocates for an environmentally friendly economy.  The 
World Bank will continue to engage in this area, seeking opportunities to support the mutually 
reinforcing aspects of economic growth and environmental sustainability as well as ensuring 
compliance to environment-related safeguards.  Although no new financial assistance has been 
requested, the World Bank would be prepared to provide financial support if needed in this 
sector.  The ongoing AAA on Mainstreaming Disaster Risk Management looks to strengthen Sri 
Lanka’s early warning system and the capacity of Government to assess risks, integrate disaster 
risk reduction into the planning process and prepare post-disaster assessments.  The World Bank 
will continue to strengthen the institutional framework for environmental and socially sound 
investments especially in the East, including training eco-tourism guides and matching grants for 
reduction in carbon emissions.  Building on its sustainable energy risk sharing facilities and 
direct financing for wind power generation, IFC will support projects that address climate change 
issues, such as renewable energy, cleaner production and energy efficiency.  

Area 3: Improved living standards and social inclusion 

77. 
The third CPS area is to support the Mahinda Chintana goal of improved living 
standards and social inclusion and equitable access.   

Area 3A: Increasing quality of services 

78. 
The World Bank will support increasing the quality of services. A national health 
sector program, currently under preparation, will improve the quality of services provided 
throughout the country and modernize the Government managed health system.  The loan will 
specifically address the health care quality improvements required to address non-communicable 
diseases and will support modernizing the health system.  The loan will be complemented by 
already ongoing AAA on the role of the private sector in health care in Sri Lanka and the 
recently concluded AAA on chronic and non-communicable diseases.  The program is expected 
to be presented to the Board in FY13 and have disbursements linked to key results.   In addition, 
the Government has requested financial support for the transportation sector and for urban 
infrastructure (including water systems and solid waste management).  Analytical work on 
options for internal transport is ongoing.  Early childhood education will be assessed and 
reviewed through AAA in preparation for a lending operation. Ongoing activities include support 
to education and transportation and improved local service delivery in the conflict-affected North 
and East. 

22 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Area 3B: Reducing the prevalence of malnutrition 

79. 
The World Bank will aim to support reducing the prevalence of malnutrition, a key 
human development area in which Sri Lanka lags behind its peers.  In addition to the 
nutrition component of the health program, new multi-sector AAA work will be carried out and 
will build on existing analysis to identify policies for addressing malnutrition, including links to 
water supply and hygiene.  Further engagement in the form of technical assistance or lending 
may be developed based on the analysis.  In the meantime, the trust fund activity “Local Level 
Nutritional Intervention for the Northern Province” fosters changes to improve nutrition 
outcomes in resettled populations of the Northern Province.47    

Area 3C: Expanding social inclusion and equitable access 

80. 
Support for equitable access to public services and social inclusion includes 
activities specifically focused on conflict-affected areas as well as activities which address 
these issues at the national level.  Activities focused on conflict-affected areas include; the 
Community Livelihoods in Conflict Affected Areas project, the Emergency Northern Recovery 
project, and the trust fund supported North and East Pilot Water, Sanitation and Hygiene project 
for post conflict resettlements. As the focus shifts from post-conflict reconstruction to an 
emphasis on equitable access and social inclusion across the entire country, new activities will 
seek to analyze and address inequities using a more systemic and sustainable approach. 
Activities which address equitable access and social inclusion at a national level include: (i) the 
Second Community Development project; (ii) a Poverty and Inequality Assessment; (iii) a trust 
fund on economic integration of vulnerable groups; (iv) a Poverty and Social Impact Analysis on 
the potential effects of various policy options on employment of women; (v) technical assistance 
to the Ministry of Labor on their gender strategy; (vi) technical assistance on the Government’s 
social protection strategy and Samurdhi program; (vii) vocational training for the disabled; (viii) 
pilot approaches to sustainable, affordable sanitation services to under-served low-income 
groups;  and  (ix) work with youth organizations to support their involvement in development 
issues.   

81. 
IFC will seek to help improve living standards and social inclusion especially 
through support for access to finance, 
infrastructure, agribusiness and farmers 
(particularly in post-conflict northern and eastern regions), and micro, small and medium 
enterprises.  Mindful of the post-conflict and transition state of the country, IFC has been 
increasingly supporting some of these areas in Sri Lanka in recent years and will build on those 
experiences to enhance the reach and impact for inclusive growth.  For example, microfinance 
projects have been promoting women’s financial inclusion and an agri-business advisory project, 
supported by a multi-donor Global Index Insurance Facility, is building on pilots in other 
developing countries and helping create a weather-index based crop insurance to support 
farmers.  The new economic development initiative mentioned in paragraph 76 is also expected 
to contribute to social inclusion.  Geographically, IFC will seek to support regions outside of 
generally more affluent Western and Southern Provinces.   

47 This activity is supported by the Japan Social Development Fund.

F. 

Implementing the Country Partnership Strategy 

i. Financing Parameters  

82. 
Sri Lanka became an IDA-IBRD blend country as of FY12, eligible for IDA16 
resources and IBRD lending. This marks Sri Lanka’s re-access to IBRD resources for the first 
time since blend status was lost in 1986.  An indicative lending program for IDA and IBRD 
combined for the first two years of the CPS is US$500 million in FY13 and US$527 in FY14.  
Sri Lanka’s eligibility for IDA will likely end at the end of the IDA16 cycle. The Government is 
interested in IBRD lending of up to US$500 million annually during FY15 and FY16, which 
would, however, depend on the macroeconomic environment in Sri Lanka, overall demand for 
IBRD resources from other clients, IBRD financial capacity and global economic developments.  
It is foreseen that IBRD financing will be used primarily for investment projects supporting 
regional economic development, urban infrastructure, encouraging innovation and technology 
adoption, and improving the skills of the labor force.  Lending plans will be reviewed at the time 
of the CPS Progress Report. 

83. 
Assuming growth prospects remain strong and macroeconomic balances and overall 
creditworthiness continue to improve, it is expected that IDA resources will be phased out 
during the CPS period through a managed transition to IBRD-only status. The indicative 
country envelope for IDA16, covering FY12-14, is SDR 458.1 million (about US$ 688 
million).48 This represents an increase of about 30 percent over its IDA 15 envelope, mainly due 
to increased IDA resources in the IDA 16 replenishment as well as improvements in Sri Lanka’s 
country performance.49  In FY12, the first year of IDA16 which preceded this CPS period, the 
IDA allocation amounted to SDR 162 million (about US$ 249.8 million).50 The same year saw 
the introduction of IBRD financing for the Metro Colombo Urban Development Project. Given 
that Sri Lanka has obtained access to IBRD resources, and its per capita income has exceeded the 
IDA income cutoff for more than three consecutive years,51 the country is expected to graduate 
from IDA through a managed transition as IBRD resources are phased in.  During the transition 
to the IBRD-only status, IDA resources would continue to play on important role to support 
governance reforms and to address the critical needs in the social sectors.  In addition, the World 
Bank could work with the authorities to explore the additional flexibility for more front/back-
loading of IDA resources across the years in FY12-14 to help ensure a stable level of overall 
financing. Box 1, below, summarizes the ongoing and proposed IDA and IBRD portfolio. 

48 IDA envelope beyond the first year of the IDA16 period is indicative and could change depending on: (i) total IDA resources 
available, (ii) the country’s performance rating, (iii) the number of IDA eligible countries, and (iv) the performance and 
assistance terms of other IDA-eligible countries.  Also, IDA allocations are provided in SDRs, and the US dollar equivalent 
amount for IDA 16 is based on replenishment rate of 1SDR=US$1.50233, but the exchange rate for each IDA operation depends 
on the applicable prevailing rate at the time of approval.  Furthermore, about 97 percent of the IDA resource is available as IDA 
credits on blend terms, while the remaining 3 percent is available on hard terms that can only be accessed by blend countries but 
has lower concessionality. 
49 IDA resources are allocated through a performance based allocation system that provides higher allocations to countries with 
better performances in delivering results at the same income level, other things equal. 
50 The actual commitment of IDA resources in FY12 was US$ 111, with the expectation that the unused FY12 allocation would 
be committed in FY13. 
51 The GNI per capita of Sri Lanka has exceeded the IDA operational income cutoff since 2004 but the country did not become 
credit-worthy for IBRD lending until 2011.  In FY12, the corresponding IDA cutoff is a 2010 GNI per capita of US$ 1,175 while 
the figure for Sri Lanka is US$ 2,290.

ii. Instruments 

84. 
In order to address the shift in focus toward support for the evolving middle income 
country agenda, the range of instruments will expand.  As there is increasing demand from 
Government for information on how other countries have addressed the transition to middle 
income country status, the demand for AAA has increased.  Also, with an increasing need for 
policy actions (in addition to investments in hardware), the demand for policy lending has 
increased as well.  And, as institutional capacity to focus on results increases, the demand for 
results-linked disbursements has increased.  It is therefore anticipated that a wider range of 
instruments will be used,52 including Development Policy Loans and Program-for-Results 

52 A delegation from the Government of Sri Lanka visited the World Bank Group in Washington in July 2011 and met with the 
World Bank Treasury Department, the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency and representatives of other parts of the World 
Bank Group.  In addition, staff of the Treasury Department of the World Bank conducted a workshop in Colombo to familiarize 
Government counterparts with IBRD. 

25 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                 
financing, with the appropriate instrument for each specific project to be determined during 
project preparation.   

85. 

The new CPS aims to better coordinate and integrate Trust Funds in the portfolio, 
in line with the World Bank’s policy to modernize Trust Funds through operational 
simplification and strategic alignment. This would include: (i) aligning Trust Fund 
management to the way the World Bank products are defined, managed and reported; (ii) using 
the same control and quality assurance framework for trust funds that are used for IBRD and 
IDA resources; (iii) using a strengthened approach to better define the results and risk 
management of Trust Funds. More specifically, going forward we aim to not only include Trust 
Funds in the CPS, but also to: (i) integrate Trust Funds into the results framework of the CPS by 
tracking results in the CPS from all funding sources; (ii) include Trust Funds in the portfolio 
reviews in order to examine alignment with the CPS; and (iii) track similar portfolio indicators 
for Trust Funds, such as riskiness, disbursements and performance.  New Trust Fund tasks will 
be carefully selected to focus only on key strategic goals and not to overload the Government 
and the task teams.   

86. 
IFC intends to continue to actively provide both investment and advisory services.  
Over the coming CPS period, IFC will design programmatic solutions instead of individual 
products and one-off projects. 

iii. Monitoring and Evaluation 

87. Monitoring and evaluation will be especially important given the CPS’s flexibility 
and the shift in focus toward the middle income country agenda.  Strategic reviews will be 
held annually to monitor CPS implementation and ensure continued alignment of the CPS with 
the evolving country needs. A CASPR will be prepared in FY14 at which time any necessary 
revisions including the results matrix will be discussed. 

88. 
Pilot use of third party monitoring will be evaluated and scaled up if found useful.  
Currently, third party monitoring is being conducted for the Road Sector Assistance Project53 to 
involve users and stakeholders in the monitoring process and to strengthen the capacity of the 
Road Development Authority to make benefit monitoring an integral part of road sector.  Over 
the coming CPS period, the World Bank hopes to expand the existing pilot to other projects.  As 
part of the planned engagement with youth, it is hoped that the youth networks will take an 
active role in monitoring the impact of the CPS as a whole with particular emphasis on activities 
that are of direct relevance to youth.  

iv. Complementarities with Activities of Other Development Partners 

89. 
The development partner landscape in Sri Lanka continues to evolve. While the 
World Bank has traditionally been one of the ‘big three’ development partners in Sri Lanka, 
together with Japan and the Asian Development Bank, China and India have emerged as the 
largest contributors, primarily through export credits. With Sri Lanka’s transition to MIC status, 

53 The ongoing pilot is being conducted with support from the Demand for Good Governance window of the Social Development 
Civil Society Trust Fund. 

26 

 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
                                                 
the Government has broadened its options for foreign financing for public investment, through a 
blend of concessional and non-concessional external assistance. Capital market financing is also 
increasingly being tapped with issuance of long-term sovereign bonds. Sri Lanka continues to 
benefit from a number of grants from multilateral and bilateral development partners. 
Development partners’ respective areas of support are highlighted in Annex 11. 

90. 
In line with the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness, both development partners 
and the Government have strengthened efforts to coordinate and harmonize foreign 
assistance. Among the mechanisms in place in this regard are: (i) the Development Partners 
Forum; (ii) the Development Partners Committee supported by a Secretariat and sector-based 
working groups. 

91. 
Development Partners Forum.  The Development Partners Forum is a broad 
information-sharing and coordination mechanism, in which Development Partners share 
respective assistance strategies, programs and new initiatives. The World Bank is one of the six 
foreign aid missions that form the Development Partner Committee, mandated by the larger 
Development Partners Forum to manage the interaction with the Government on behalf of the 
development partners.  The Development Partner Committee comprises of three multilateral - 
World Bank, UN Resident Coordinator, Asian Development Bank, and three bilateral missions 
selected on an annual basis by the Bilateral Donor Group.54  The Chair of the Development 
Partners Forum also chairs the Development Partners Committee.    

92. 
During the CPS period the World Bank Group will continue to be an active member 
of the development partner community, coordinating with relevant working groups and 
reaching out to new development partners.  IFC is a member of the Development Partner 
Forum Private Sector Development working group, chaired by USAID. 

IV. RISKS AND RISK MANAGEMENT 

93. 
This CPS includes a careful assessment of key risks in the program, and steps to 
manage such risk.  The World Bank Group program in Sri Lanka faces two types of risks in 
implementation of the Country Partnership Strategy.  The first set of risks is related to the 
implementation environment and is reflective of Sri Lanka’s specific development challenges.  
The second set of risks is related to the design of the program itself.   

A. Risks Related to the Implementation Environment 

94. 
External shocks could impact the macroeconomic framework.  The main external risk 
is that key trading partners, lenders and financers would be unable to sustain expected levels of 
engagement.  Sri Lanka is vulnerable to Euro area debt problems and weakening growth in 
several large emerging economies.  Sri Lanka relies heavily on European demand for its 
merchandise exports as well as service exports.55  A deepening of the Euro Area crisis would 

54 For 2012, the three bilateral Development Partners on the Committee are AusAID, Japan International Cooperation Agency 
and USAID. 
55 Thirty five percent of goods exports go to Europe and 37 percent of tourist arrivals come from Europe. 

27 

 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
                                                 
lead to weaker exports and capital flows.56 Sri Lanka is also vulnerable to disruption in imports 
of petroleum products, most of which come from Iran.  The risk of reduced demand for exports 
can be mitigated by increased focus of trade with growing economies of East and South Asia.   

95. 
There are also macroeconomic risks originating from within Sri Lanka.  Increased 
international competitiveness leading to a reduced trade deficit is essential for macroeconomic 
stability.  Without an increase in exports, remittances or FDI, Sri Lanka will be unable to finance 
the investment and intermediate imports required for growth.  To that end, an exchange rate that 
is both market-driven and reasonably stable will be essential.  To the extent the exchange rate 
volatility witnessed in February and March 2012 (when the Central Bank curtailed its 
intervention) reflects a short-lived process of finding equilibrium following the Central Bank’s 
reduced intervention, it is a positive sign, though one that requires close monitoring.     

96. 
Expenditure pressures may slow down the progress on reducing the fiscal deficit.  
Continued efforts will also be required to ensure progress in reducing the fiscal deficit and debt.  
Strong effort on tax administration can mitigate the risk of slower than anticipated progress on 
fiscal deficits.  Analysis of State Owned Enterprises (including that being performed by the 
World Bank) will help identify the extent of risk associated with contingent liabilities.  Although 
Sri Lanka’s cost of borrowing has declined thanks to improvements in the sovereign credit 
ratings, costs could increase if there are problems in the international financial markets or if Sri 
Lanka’s credit ratings are not maintained.  Investment and productivity increases are essential for 
the achievement of sustained growth.  Both rely heavily on further improvements in the 
investment climate and predictability of the policy environment.  Lapses on either issue would 
result in lower than expected growth.  Inflation is expected to remain low over the CPS period.  
This scenario is subject to risk, however, if the economy were to overheat.  Finally, rapid credit 
growth achieved in the past year could be a foreshadowing of an increase in non-performing 
loans and potentially serious issues in the financial sector, ultimately raising the risks of high 
contingent fiscal liabilities.  The Government is a significant stakeholder in a number of private 
commercial banks.  There is a risk that the Government’s ownership and position on the Board 
of Directors may influence the decisions of the banks’ management for non-commercial 
purposes. 

97. Macroeconomic risks will be monitored throughout the CPS period.  The World 
Bank produces monthly and semi-annual macroeconomic monitoring notes, and has initiated an 
analysis of potential impacts of a Eurozone crisis.  In addition, the CPS program includes a 
growth analysis report, a fiscal issues note, a Public Expenditure Review/ PEFA, analysis of the 
judicial system, as well as dialogue on public financial management and investment climate 
reforms.  All of these activities will be shared with Government in an effort to agree on a set of 
measures to mitigate the associated macroeconomic risks.         

56 Since mid-2009 significant investment flows from Europe has found its way into assets in the country particularly through 
successive GoSL Eurobond issues, investments into the Colombo Bourse and investments into GoSL treasury bills and treasury 
bonds.  The recent Global Economic Prospects report estimates exposure to Sri Lankan assets by European banks at close to 10 
percent of country’s GDP or US$ 5.5 billion. This presents a significant vulnerability in face of a sudden withdrawal of 
investments as the exposure amounts to near entirety of country’s gross official reserves as of end 2011. However, such risks are 
mitigated by the fact the much of these investments are medium to long term in nature.  The spreads on Sri Lanka Eurobonds in 
secondary markets trading has been rising since end 2011. The current spreads of 461 basis points is the highest in 20 months.

98. 
Continued efforts will also be required to ensure social inclusiveness and political 
openness as well as economic integration of conflict affected areas and to make sure that 
the benefits of growth are widely and equitably shared.  A process for implementation of 
recommendations of the Lessons Learned and Reconciliation Commission will be important.  
The World Bank Group is providing support including ongoing projects to help internally 
displaced persons resettle and reestablish livelihoods.  Analytical work on inclusive growth, 
labor and poverty will also support dialogue and actions in these areas. 

99. 
Sri Lanka is vulnerable to natural disasters and extreme weather events, including 
floods, droughts, and cyclones.  In addition to the immediate impact of destroyed assets, natural 
disasters and extreme weather events can affect economic growth by diverting the development 
funds for emergency response, relief and recovery efforts and by affecting the income generating 
activities of the population. The CPS program includes a trust funded activity, “Strengthening 
the Disaster Management System and Mainstreaming Climate Change Mitigation in Urban 
Development”, which supports the Government of Sri Lanka’s efforts to address these risks. 

B. Risks Related to the Program 

100. The World Bank’s portfolio faces risks related to governance, procurement and 
financial management.  Recent assessments on these topics concluded that Sri Lanka has made 
efforts toward reforming and developing its systems, while suggesting areas for further 
modernization.  Portfolio related governance risks will be addressed through project and sector 
specific mitigation measures, including through Governance, Accountability and Anti-
Corruption Action Plans (GAAP). The proposed AAA to improve SOEs management and 
effectiveness, the DPL to improve the overall investment climate, as well as the proposed 
Judicial Reform Project to support legal and regulatory reforms will also contribute to enhancing 
the dialogue on governance related issues. Fiduciary risks will be mitigated by continued support 
to the Auditor General Department for enhancing the scope and coverage of public audits as well 
as to strengthen value added audit services, and support to the Institute of Chartered Accountants 
of Sri Lanka for enabling the adoption of IFRS to State Owned Enterprises and small and 
medium enterprises, as well as for improving the quality of audit practices.  In addition, the 
World Bank expects to build on support provided during the FY09-12 CAS to the Parliamentary 
committees for budget oversight to strengthen their oversight functions.  In addition, fiduciary 
assessments will be performed at a sector level in advance of any proposed Program-For-Results 
operation. 

101. Program implementation also faces risks related to Government capacity to manage 
the increased volume of lending.  Although Government agencies have skilled professional 
staff, the massive public investment program will put strains on staff.  The risk that capacity 
within Government will be insufficient, given the increased level of engagement in addition to 
the Government’s existing investment program, is mitigated by the World Bank minimizing 
transaction costs by moving toward use of country systems for financial management, and 
proactively restructuring projects.  A related risk is that Government priorities may change over 
the course of the CPS period.  This risk will be minimized by taking a flexible approach, with the 
CPS used to set the broad direction for engagement in line with the Government’s own strategy 

29 

 
 
 
 
 
and to identify the program for the first two and a half years. The CPS Progress Report will 
provide opportunities to realign and modify the program accordingly.   

102. 
In addition to the risks above, there are two sets of key risks faced by IFC.  The first 
is a program risk due primarily to IFC’s catalytic role that appropriate partners may not be found 
for the planned initiatives.  This risk should be mitigated by lessons learned from IFC’s past 
experience in Sri Lanka and its growing network of partners.  The second is the risk from the 
expected increased weighting to the financial sector in IFC's investment portfolio, which will be 
above 50 percent for much of the CPS period.  Sri Lanka has a relatively sound banking system 
overall, and the exposure is therefore not an immediate concern.  However, IFC will actively 
seek to build a diversified portfolio, will diversify within the financial sector across different 
types of financial institutions, and, through advisory services, will strengthen its portfolio 
financial institutions, where necessary.

Executive Summary 

FY2009-2012   
June 10, 2011        

The World Bank Group’s FY09-12 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Sri Lanka was 
discussed by the Board of Executive Directors on June 5, 2008. The CAS, prepared against the 
backdrop of a protracted civil conflict, centered attention on the conflict-afflicted areas of the 
Northeast and the poor areas of the South. When the conflict ended in May 2009, the World Bank 
Group strengthened this strategic focus, adding priority support for the resettlement of internal 
refuges, the reconstruction of infrastructure and the improvement of livelihood opportunities in 
afflicted areas. During this CAS period Sri Lanka transitioned from a Low to a Middle-Income 
Country (MIC) and was declared creditworthy for IBRD financing in December 2010. A CAS 
Progress Report in June 2011 adjusted the program to take account of implementation and the 
country’s emerging priorities. It also drew the implications of these developments for Sri Lanka’s 
CAS program moving forward.  

  This Completion Report finds that WBG made a positive contribution to the delivery of 
development outcomes in the lagging regions of the country including former conflict areas 
by improving access services, advancing reconstruction of housing and productive 
infrastructure, and involving the communities in these processes. The World Bank helped 
with the monitoring of the resettlement of displaced persons program and informing the 
international community of the progress made. The contribution in health and education was 
likewise significant nationwide, as has been the work on mainstreaming ICT practices in 
government and the private sector and improving the road network. The IFC’s alignment of its 
advisory and investment activities and the coordination with the World Bank helped deliver in 
areas such as renewable energy and ICT.  In some areas, such as improving public expenditure 
practices, supporting SOE reform and developing formal PPP frameworks, CAS delivery fell 
below expectations. 

3. 

This joint World Bank-IFC report is based on an extensive review of the World Bank 
project documents, analytical work and evaluations of specific programs undertaken by 
IBRD, IFC, Government, and other external partners during the CAS period.  It is also 
informed by interviews with several Government officials (from ministries and other public 
sector institutions), relevant civil society representatives, external partners and World Bank staff.

Progress towards Long-Term Development Goals 

The country made good progress towards the development objectives set under the 
Government Strategy Mahinda Chintana’s vision for Sri Lanka (2007).  The achievements 
include resumption of rapid economic growth, reduction in poverty levels, infrastructure 
upgrading, and continued gains in health and education.  Since the end of the conflict the 
Government has carried out a rapid resettlement of displaced persons and taken actions to 
improve economic opportunities in the afflicted zones. The end of the conflict and the rapid pace 
of recent economic growth open the opportunity for institutional reforms in line with the 
ambitions of the government to transform Sri Lanka into a full-fledged middle income economy.  

Brisk economic growth has taken the country to middle-income status. The 2008/2009 global 
crisis slowed but did not stop the path of rapid economic growth. A drop in external revenues 
induced an economic contraction during the last quarter of 2008 and the first quarter of 2009. 
Skilled macroeconomic management supported by an IMF program (20-month Stand-By 
Arrangement amounting to US$2.6 billion57) and the end of conflict contributed to a rapid 
recovery and the economy grew at 3.5 percent in 2009.  The rate of economic growth increased to 
8 percent in 2010 and the estimate for 2011 is 8 percent as well. The income per-capita of the 
country is over US$2,400.   

The quality of the macroeconomic environment has improved. Economic growth and a 
process of fiscal consolidation that includes revenue and expenditure measures have reduced the 
ratio of the fiscal deficit and of the public debt to GDP. A 2009 IMF –World Bank Debt 
sustainability analysis found the risk of debt distress to be moderate.  But, there are concerns 
about over-heating from demand pressures and the rapid expansion of credit to the private sector 
that may be pressuring the stability of the financial sector.   

The end of the conflict and an ambitious public investment program are contributing to an 
improved attractiveness of the business environment, but full impact has yet to be achieved.  
Sri Lanka’s ranking according to the Global Competitive Index58 improved rapidly going from a 
position of 77 in 2008-2009 to 52 in 2011-2012. Rankings improved across the board, with 
significant gains made regarding infrastructure, macroeconomics, basic health and education, and 
security.59 The improvements in infrastructure have been the result of the Government’s emphasis 
on reconstruction; public investment has increased from around 4 percent in 2006 to reach 7 
percent of GDP in 2011. Private investment a percentage of GDP, however, does not show an 
increasing trend and FDI remained low during the period. In the meantime, remittances have 
grown in importance and now represent half of the value of exports. The increase in remittances 
has coincided with a drop in the share of exports in GDP that has fallen from 30 percent in 2006 
to 22 percent in 2011, reflecting a slowdown in the economies of several important trade partners 
in Europe and North America during and following the crisis, a loss of competitiveness due to an 
appreciating real effective exchange rate, and a negative shift in Sri Lanka’s terms of trade. 

57 November, 2009.  
58 The GCI, produced annually by the World Economic Forum, ranks countries along a wide range of factors that affect 
competitiveness.  
59 According to Doing Business (DB) indicators, progress in improving the regulatory framework for business has been 
more limited. However, the DB indicators consider a narrower set of variables.  According to the Logistics 
Performance Index, produced by the World Bank, the progress between 2007 and 2010 has been uneven. Updated 
analytical work on competiveness and growth is needed to provide a consolidated view.

A process of internal reconciliation is underway. The resettlement of displaced persons is 
almost completed and reconstruction in the conflict-affected areas is underway. Economic 
activity is recovering, especially the Eastern province where the process of reconstruction has 
been going for a longer period of time. A Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission 
commenced its work in August 2010 and has issued final recommendations on the reduction of 
high security zones, release of ex-combatants, resolution of land disputes and disarming of 
paramilitary groups. Still, the relationship with some members of the international community 
remains tense, particularly as it refers to the accountability for actions during the war.   

Sri Lanka is likely to reach all of the MDGs, except for the environment. Sri Lanka has 
continued delivering outstanding basic social outcomes far above those of countries with similar 
levels of income. Poverty incidence continues to decline. Excluding the conflict-affected North 
and East, the poverty headcount ratio fell from about 15.2 percent in 2006/2007 to about 8.9 
percent in 2009/10. This rapid decline reflects broad reductions across much of the country 
including in urban, rural and plantation areas.  In education, major progress was made in 
increasing access, enhancing quality and improving governance of basic and secondary education 
as well as setting the basis for an overhaul of higher and vocational education. The primary 
completion rate is over 97 percent, and the survival rate to the end of basic education (age 14) is 
over 91 percent. Sri Lanka has made considerable progress in putting in place a National Policy 
Framework for University, Technical and Vocational Education. Implementation of this 
framework is commencing. Less attention has been placed on pre-school education, where access 
remains low. Life expectancy is comparable to that of upper middle-income countries, with the 
emerging challenge centered on addressing communicable deceases. HIV/AIDS incidence is very 
low. Relatively high levels of child malnutrition in rural and urban areas reportedly are mostly 
related to cultural practices and not responsive to increases in incomes.  

Progress has been slower regarding implementation of the environment agenda. Sri Lanka 
was the first country in Asia to prepare in 1992 a National Environmental Action Plan (NEAP), 
which has been updated periodically with the latest update, “Caring for the Environment: A Path 
to Sustainable Development 2008-2012” prepared in 2008. In addition, “Haritha (Green) Lanka” 
program has been published by the Ministry of Environment in 2010, as an output of the National 
Council for Sustainable Development.” The Mahinda Chintana identifies precise targets in all 
environment fronts. Still, on results the country appears to lag behind many of its peers.  The 
overall approach to environmental management has been a combination of environmental policies 
and strategies, such as regulation and the establishment of a dialogue with the private sector in 
order to strike the right balance between economic development and environmental protection.  
However, actual steps taken to resolve environmental and natural resource issues have been 
weak.  Therefore, on most measures of environmental stewardship Sri Lanka’s performance 
remains disappointing.  The only MDG the country is unlikely to achieve is MDG 7 on ensuring 
environmental sustainability by 2015. 

III. 

Design and Relevance  

11. 

The four pillars of the World Bank Group’s FY09-12 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Sri 
Lanka were aligned with selected aspects of the government strategy Mahinda Chintana’s vision 
for Sri Lanka (2007). They were also relevant to the challenges that the country faced. The 
emphasis of the first pillar was on bringing services and opportunities to the lagging regions of 
the country and rehabilitating the areas affected by the conflict. The second pillar focused on 
improving the foundations for sustained economic growth. The third pillar maintained the World 
Bank’s involvement in health and education, areas with a strong track record of cooperation. The 

46 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
12. 

13. 

IV. 

14. 

15. 

fourth pillar sought to support the strong emphasis on the environment found in the government 
strategy.  

The CAS, in addition, stressed two crosscutting themes. First, a key-driving theme of the CAS 
was addressing the challenges of the conflict-affected areas and more generally the challenge of 
generating opportunities in the lagging regions of the country.  With the end of the conflict the 
government further prioritized this objective and the WBG increased its support for it. The 
attention to the lagging areas was mainstreamed into several operations that included housing 
reconstruction, rural development, irrigation repair, micro-finance, community development, 
rebuilding of infrastructure and service delivery. Second, the CAS design emphasized 
Transparency and Accountability as a thematic issue and focused its program on (i) supporting 
core governance institutions; (ii) strengthening sectoral governance in sectors where the World 
Bank is engaged; and (iii) fostering increased demand for good governance. In the difficult 
implementation environment of conflict, the CAS introduced a conflict filter to guide both the 
selection of activities to engage as well as to guide implementation.  

During implementation and towards the end of the CAS, as reflected in the CAS Progress Report, 
the WBG began to broaden the scope of engagement to cover priority areas of the evolving 
government strategy, with attention to urban development, a holistic view of infrastructure, social 
security and growth.  

Results delivered with the support of the CAS program  

This section reviews the contribution of the CAS program to the delivery of results following on 
the commitments made under the original CAS and the revisions introduced by the CAS Progress 
Report. This review examines, in addition, the rationale behind revisions introduced in the 
Progress Report introduced.  

Strategic Objective 1:  Expanding Economic opportunities in Lagging Regions. Inclusive 
and Equitable Economic Development. 

Support for expanding economic opportunities in lagging regions centered on (a) promoting 
rural development and (b) improving access to infrastructure and services in the conflict areas. 
The relevance of these objectives was grounded on (i) the wide income discrepancies between the 
Western region, where the capital Colombo is located, and the rest of the country and (ii) the fact 
that 90 percent of the poor live in rural areas. The World Bank examined the challenges the 
country faced to redress these discrepancies in the widely disseminated Growth Potential in 
Lagging Regions (Connecting People to Prosperity Study) (FY08). A strong delivery of results 
was aided by several projects under implementation at the beginning of the CAS and the approval 
of new operations that included support for the resettlement of refuges as the conflict ended, 
support for infrastructure reconstruction, and rapid response to emergency situations such as the 
flooding of late 2010. A nationwide decline in poverty incidence suggests that the welfare of the 
lagging areas is increasing and that regional disparities have not widened. 60  

60  Urban poverty incidence dropped from 6.7percent in 2006/2007 to 5.3 percent in 2009/2010. Rural poverty 
incidence dropped from 15.5percent in 2006/2007 to 9.4percent in 2009/2010. The drop in poverty incidence in the 
areas under tea estates was significant going from 32percent to 11.4percent during the same period.

Outcome 1.1: Supporting Integrated Rural Development 

16. 

17. 

18. 

Implementation of 
the WBG delivered significant positive outcomes regarding 
electrification, roads, and irrigation in the poor regions of the South and the conflict-
affected areas of the Northeast. The Agricultural Commercialization (FY2009) Report studied 
value chains for key products and presented recommendations for raising their productivity; these 
recommendations remain valid and could be the basis for future engagement on rural 
development by the World Bank or other donors. However, the foreseen Agricultural Research 
and Productivity Improvement Project was not delivered, possibly because the limited success of 
a previous engagement. 61 The original CAS included, under this strategic objective, results on 
improving the level of nutrition in children, which the Progress Report eliminated because of 
delays in launching the supporting instrument. Only in January 2011, a Trust Fund was approved 
to focus on nutrition interventions in the Northern Region, with results due in the next strategy. 62 

The WBG contributed both to a greater availability of electricity in rural areas and to an 
increase in energy supply from renewable sources.  The IFC and the World Bank contributed 
towards increasing the supply of renewable energy. The World Bank has done so through the 
Renewable Energy for Rural Economic Development Project and the IFC through a special 
program called PADGO or Portfolio Approach to Distributed Generation Opportunity. With the 
support of the World Bank project 139,241 new rural households have access to electricity as of  
November15, 2011. In addition, the amount of renewable energy supplied to the national grid 
from small and medium generation plants has expanded to reach 174.2 MW 63.  The IFC-
supported, innovative risk sharing facility with two commercial banks, in combination with 
advisory services, is supporting small hydro and wind power projects with total installed 
generation capacity of 65.4MW thus far, enabling 72,000 MT GHG emissions yearly.  IFC has 
also provided direct financing for wind power generation.  The World Bank and IFC support for 
Sri Lanka’s renewable energy sector is having a transformational impact through increased 
private sector participation in generation.  

Availability of drinking water in rural areas has expanded. The share of rural households 
with access to an improved water source reached at 74 percent in 2011 up from 71 percent in 
2008. 64The World Bank contributed partially to this increased availability of improved water 
through the Second Community Water Project that has recently been completed and that provided 
around 384,100 people in rural areas with access to improved water sources and about 92,000 
new piped household water connections as of the end of 2010.  The satisfaction of the 
beneficiaries of this project was 88percent as per surveys under project. The project ICR rated the 
achievement of development outcomes as moderately satisfactory, and noted that both the initial 
and revised designs had set unrealizable goals regarding the number of people that could be 
covered with the resources available under the project.  

61 The achievement of development outcomes under for the Sri Lanka Land Titling and Related Services Project was 
rated as moderately unsatisfactory. See corresponding ICR March 2007. A key recurrent concern remains the role that 
land titling is to play in a rural development strategy.  
62 Nutrition is discussed further ahead under the Health section outcome 3.2 and paragraph 43.  
63 November 15,2011 
64 There remains a wide discrepancy between rural and urban areas in the availability of pipe borne water supply; 
approximately 75percent of the urban population having access while only 14percent of the rural population does. In 
sanitation, it is estimated that 85.7percent of the population has access to adequate sanitation, with no major urban rural 
disparities.

Efforts are on going to improve the irrigation system and reduce the risk from dam failure, 
but implementation is behind schedule. Sri Lanka possesses an extended irrigation system, part 
of which is one of the oldest in the world and is in dire need of repair in order to raise agricultural 
productivity and reduce risks from inundations. The Dam Safety and Water Resources Planning 
Project (FY08) focuses on establishing long-term sustainable arrangements for operation and 
maintenance of large dams and on improving water resources planning. Initial implementation 
was slow to pick-up and heavy rains during 2010 further delayed progress. The CAS Progress 
Report consequently downgraded initial expectations about progress; today, implementation is 
picking up and already two out of 32 larger dams are considered not to pose a major risk for the 
population Irrigation repair components included under various World Bank projects are 
beginning to deliver results, as reported in paragraph 23. Several projects planned in the water 
sector could not be delivered:  Irrigation Maintenance and Water Resource Management Project; 
Community Water and Poverty Alleviation in Plantation Districts Project; and Provincial Water 
Supply Project.  

20. 

IFC has been supporting increasing the financial inclusion amongst the poor. IFC also 
provided capacity building support to micro, small and medium enterprises in five lagging 
districts in the South with the Business Edge toolkit as well as helped partnered financial 
institutions to offer financing to MSMEs.   These support helped improve rural entrepreneurs’ 
know-how and access to finance. 

Outcome 1.2: Improving Access to Public Services and Infrastructure in the North and East 

21. 

An ambitious resettlement of displaced persons advanced rapidly after the conflict ended. 
When the conflict ended the government placed a high priority on reconstruction so as to enable 
the rapid return of displaced persons to their place of origin. The support of the World Bank for 
these efforts came through an operation that tracked the resettlement process by focusing on key 
performance indicators and, in addition, financed the repair and improvement of infrastructure in 
afflicted areas. 65 Tracking of resettlement targets and informing the international community of 
the progress achieved was timely and relevant at the time when the country under was 
considerable scrutiny. As it turned out, resettlement was undertaken rapidly despite the 
substantive preparatory work that was required, including mine removal in the areas of 
resettlement. As of October 31,2011, 187,533 IDPs returned home exceeding the target of 
100,000 introduced by the CAS Progress Report. By the same date, employment equivalent to 
1,653,000 person-days had been generated, above the target of 1,070,000. The World Bank 
project continues to work on providing solid opportunities for the returnees. Considerable 
progress has already been made to reach the targets under the project. For instance, the target 
(7,600 Has) for farm and high land recuperated is close to being reached. The designs are ready 
for 600 sub-projects costing around US$60 million that would finance roads, water supply, 
irrigation and other infrastructure.  

22. 

The World Bank program contributed to increasing the stock of available housing in 
conflict affected areas of Sri Lanka. Two World Bank projects contributed to the reconstruction 
of housing destroyed during the conflict: Puttalam Housing and North East Housing 
Reconstruction, which has received additional financing.  This support has led to the 
reconstruction of 52,193 houses as of November 28, 2011, with 532 villages receiving basic 
infrastructure improvements—the additional financing is refurbishing infrastructure in 217 
villages more.  These results exceed the milestones set under the CAS and come close to the

target set by the CAS Progress report.66 The housing projects have emphasized the involvement 
and participation of the potential beneficiaries and their communities with the expectation that the 
capacity acquired and lessons learned can serve the country and the government in reducing the 
remaining housing gap.

The CAS program has contributed to improved access to infrastructure services in the 
zones that experienced conflict.  The share of rural population with access to basic 
infrastructure facilities in the heavily affected communities of the North and East reached at 15 
percent in 2011, up from 9 percent in 2008.  The World Bank supported this achievement through 
the Community Livelihoods in Conflict-Affected Areas Project. As the conflict ended, the project 
received additional financing in 2009 to scaling up the resettlement process by scaling-up support 
for village development and irrigation.  A third additional financing (2011) was designed to 
respond to the impact of severe rains in November and December 2010, exacerbated by further 
flooding in January/February 2011, which affected the livelihood of around half a million people. 
67In addition, the North East Local Services Improvement Project (FY10) supports construction 
and rehabilitation of rural roads and drainage systems. The full impact of this project will be 
realized during the next CAS period.  

A Community Driven Development (CDD) approach has been an effective instrument for 
improving service delivery in the targeted regions where poverty is prevalent. Two projects 
have focused primarily on involving communities in service delivery. 68 First, in the northeastern 
regions, the Community Livelihoods in Conflict-Affected Areas Project is utilizing a CDD 
approach with around 1,506 Community Based Organizations involved in project implementation 
and monitoring and evaluation at the village level. This project has contributed to improving the 
access of the rural population of the Northeastern regions to services and markets as reported in 
the paragraph 23. Second, the Integrated Community Development and Livelihood Improvement 
APL that is covering the Southern regions of the country followed a more ambitious CDD 
approach.  The ICR for the first operation under this APL project rated delivery of outcomes as 
satisfactory; IEG in turn, rated it highly satisfactory and noted the quality of the targeting and the 
high impact on incomes and employment of the interventions.  Notably the project has been the 
executed by a semi-autonomous foundation. The second leg of the APL (FY10), referred to 
locally as the Gemi Diriya (GD) Project, reportedly faced implementation difficulties69 due to an 
emerging lack of Government ownership over the conceptual framework of the project including 
the role played by the independent Gemi Diriya Foundation. The Government and the World 
Bank have reached agreements on future implementation arrangements, which will integrate the 
project structures within government structures but maintain community involvement in project 
implementation.  

66 The North East Housing Reconstruction Project, as of May 2011, was close to meeting its target of number of 29,079 
houses reconstructed with 27,000 completed. The Puttalam Housing Project, as of May 2011, had met 86percent of the 
target for construction of houses. However, the project required an extension, approved in June 2011, due to the slower 
pace of implementation of the infrastructure component that was designed to cover roads, water and sanitation.   
67 The project has remained focused on twelve districts in the Eastern and Northern provinces and adjoining areas and 
is assisting in improving the livelihood opportunities of 136,000 households in 1,000 villages and to rehabilitate seven 
major irrigation schemes benefiting over 35,000 farmers.  Already 90 percent of the target households have benefited 
from various income generating schemes and 19,200 ha of land have been rehabilitated and brought under cultivation. 
Around 1,506 Community Base Organizations are actively engaged in reconstruction activities. 
68 A CDD approach has been mainstreamed to several other projects as well.

Strategic Objective 2: Improving the Investment Climate and Competitiveness. Accelerate 
and Sustain Economic Growth.   

The Government’s strategy to accelerate growth to a steady annual eight percent per year 
called for placing great emphasis on closing the infrastructure gap within a vision of Sri 
Lanka as hub or magnet in the South Asia region.  In addition, the Government strategy 
foresaw creating conditions for a dynamic private sector to emerge and take the lead in growth 
and job creation. Along these lines, the implementation of the national roads agenda has advanced 
satisfactorily, under the leadership of the Government and with the support of the development 
partners, including the World Bank. The World Bank Group contributed to creating conditions 
for a more dynamic private sector to emerge in the areas of its limited engagement: easing the 
conditions for opening up a business, finance, and ICT development. The CAS Progress Report 
revised the results framework regarding the transparency and effectiveness of budgetary practices 
to account for the limited traction in advancing this agenda. With hindsight, the limited support 
that the WBG provided towards improving the business environment for private enterprise and 
for improving budgetary practices was due in part to a lack of supporting analytical work to guide 
the dialogue with government and perhaps, as well, to divergent views, between the Government 
and the WBG, on how to achieve the goals set out in the national strategy. In addition, the 
messages sent by the government have been ambiguous. On the one hand, the recently established 
Strategic Investment Law helps fast-track approved projects/investors to reduce red tape.  On the 
other hand, the Under-performing Enterprises and Underutilized Assets Act has raised concerns 
among potential investors. Towards the end of the CAS, the World Bank has been working on 
improving its competitiveness diagnostic and understanding the challenges of improving 
budgetary practices in order to step up the dialogue with the government in these areas.  

Outcome 2.1: Improving Infrastructure Provision 

26. 

27. 

The CAS program contributed to improving road interconnections across the country, with 
the central government responsible for the national road network; and, as established in the 
Article 13th of the Constitution, provincial and local governments taking the lead in 
secondary and tertiary roads. The World Bank, jointly with other development partners has 
been supporting up-grading national and provincial roads.  

Substantive results have been achieved in upgrading of the national road network. On the 
institutional front, the capacity of the Road Authority has been strengthened, as has been the 
financing of the Road Maintenance Trust Fund that increased from $13 million in 2005 to $64 
million in 2010. The quality of the national road network has improved with a reduction in the 
International Road Roughness Index and a decline in the Network Vehicle Operating Costs. The 
World Bank support has come through the Road Sector Assistance Project (FY06) that has 
received additional financing.   Under the project a total of 618 km of national roads have been 
upgraded and the Road Roughness index under the project is far below the national average. A 
component on rural roads has contributed to 154 KMs of repaired roads, with a reduction of 60 
percent in travel time on these roads, far above the 4 percent target set in the initial project 
design.70 The Provincial Roads Project (FY10), consistent with supporting conflict affected areas 
and poor areas, is working to improve road conditions in three provinces in the North, East and 
South. This project is commencing implementation.

Recently, the World Bank work is refocusing its support on infrastructure. A project has 
been negotiated71 to support program of work on urban and water issues in the metro Colombo 
region, signaling a welcome shift in the World Bank agenda towards helping with emerging 
urban challenges.    This will be the first IBRD operation in the country when approved.  

IFC has also been supporting improvements in infrastructure. IFC contributions comprised: 
direct and indirect support for scaling up renewable energy; portfolio support for two major 
communications companies (Dialog and Suntel); South Asia Gateway Terminals investment, 
which was completed during the CAS period; as well as efforts to try to facilitate the 
development of a PPP project.  On this, WB, WBI, and IFC jointly held a workshop on PPPs in 
Colombo in December 2010 and continue follow-up dialogues with the Government. The scope 
for PPP work by the WBG has been limited by the Government’s preference for bi-lateral 
solutions to the construction of large infrastructure projects, such as ports.  

 Outcome 2.2: Improving the Business Environment for Stronger Entrepreneurship and a Knowledge-
Based Economy 

30. 

31. 

The World Bank and IFC’s regulatory support for improving the business environment 
was selective with a focus on facilitating entry through a reduction in the costs of opening 
up a business.  According to the 2012 Doing Business Report (DBR) Sri Lanka ranks second in 
South Asia on the quality of the business environment. The efforts supported by the WBG to 
facilitate business creation reduced by half the number of days needed to open a business. IFC-
WB Doing Business Reform Technical Assistance and IFC advisory support in selected 
municipalities provided the necessary support to achieve this result. The Ministry of Economic 
Development has recently launched an initiative to improve the quality of Sri Lanka’s business 
environment ranking over the next two years, beginning with tax reform, as the global DBR 
ranking for Sri Lanka at 82 in 2012 is dissonant with the notable achievements in other areas such 
as education and health.  

The World Bank and the IFC’s successful support for ICT development and technology-
enabling innovation were part of a broader effort to bolster private sector competitiveness, 
expand electronic government services and reach out to communities in rural and remote 
areas. The World Bank’s e-Sri Lanka Development Project, has established over 600 tele-centers 
throughout the country, linking over 70,000 users monthly, half of whom are women. The project 
has trained 35,000 private sector participants to incorporate ICT into their businesses and is 
helping to improve government efficiency and transparency by introducing ICT in government 
agencies and taking public services online. These results are helping reduce the regulatory burden 
for businesses and individuals.72 Additional finance for this project, has been approved (FY12) 
and , aims to (a) consolidating high impact activities including e-applications, common platforms 
and service delivery points; and (b) addressing constrains to expansion by bridging gaps in 
infrastructure, training, technical standards, regulations and legislation. The project is one of the 
most comprehensive ICT initiatives by the World Bank which is now under implementation.  

32. 

Towards the end of the CAS two World Bank projects were approved in support of the 
development of the private sector with emphasis on small and medium enterprises (SMEs). 
The Sustainable Tourism Development Project (FY2010) is designed to strengthen the 

71 Metro Colombo Project expected Board Date March 15, 2012. 
72 The contribution of this project extends beyond the indicators included in the CAS. See November 3, 2011 ISR for 
the e-Lanka Development Project.

institutional framework for the tourism sector in order to facilitate environmentally and socially 
sounds investments, with particular attention to the East of Sri Lanka. Specifically, the project 
supports drastically reducing the connection time between Colombo and the East, training human 
resources for tourism, and the development of SME sector. The progress towards the 
development outcomes under this project has been substantial, already exceeding in some cases 
201473end of project target.  The project complements IFC’s advisory work for sustainable 
tourism (including supplier medium, small and micro Enterprises capacity building) and south-
south capacity building for SMEs.  The Crisis Response Small and Medium Enterprises 
Development Facility Project (FY10) built on the success of the Renewable Energy for Rural 
Development Loan, an operation with a large financial intermediation component, and 
complemented credit lines provided by other international organizations and the government. In 
addition, the World Bank Group has provided assistance for the development of the non-banking 
sector through TA funded by the FIRST initiative. This support included technical assistance to 
the Securities Exchange Commission to amending the SEC Act to enable demutualization of 
Colombo Stock Exchange (Support has also been provided for insurance supervision.)  In 
addition, at the end of the last calendar year,  the World Bank produced a  Financial Sector Policy 
Note that takes stock of the progress and challenges in the financial sector against the backdrop of 
the 2007 FSAP.  

The IFC has supported SMEs and micro enterprises by facilitating access to finance, skills, 
capacity, and training opportunities. Enhancing its financing for Dialog, IFC provided 
linkages advisory support to build MSME capacity and trained over 5000 participants to date and 
helped increase revenues. IFC is also helping strengthen technology-based financial infrastructure 
through, for example, the establishment of Secured Collateral Registry. With the use of the 
Performance Based Grant Initiative, IFC encouraged the expansion of microfinance services 
provided by LOLC Micro Credit and SANASA Development Bank to urban and rural lower 
income segments. Focusing on the post-conflict and less developed regions, IFC’s support helped 
these microloan providers to increase aggregate new loans by over 266,000 in the amount of 
US$275million in a year and a half to Dec 2011. It is noteworthy to point out that Sri Lanka has 
one of the most advanced micro-credit sectors in the region.   

33. 

 Outcome 2.3:  Improving the Strategic Relevance and Transparency of Public Spending 

34. 

35. 

Overall, the progress made during the CAS in improving public expenditure practices was 
limited. To begin, the expectations regarding results from World Bank engagement under the 
original CAS document were modest and targeted towards selected objectives, reflecting a de 
facto limited engagement. Moreover, the CAS Progress Report eliminated several of the expected 
outcomes in procurement, PPP and SOEs.  

The Public Sector Capacity Building Project (FY08) has been slow to deliver results.  The 
project was designed to enhance the effectiveness and productivity of the Department of Census 
and Statistics (DCS) and the Auditor General’s Department (AGD), but a slow and difficult 
implementation has meant that the project will not be completed on time. The DCS component 
has been marred by procurement difficulties and has been cancelled. But, significant progress has 

73 Since the end of the internal conflict tourism has picked exceeding the expectations for the end of 2014 set under the 
Bank project. Tourism receipts went from US$ 320 millions at the end of 2008 to US$ 580 million September, 2011. 
The target for the end of the project was US$400 million. During the same period, occupancy rates went from 
44percent to 72percent, still below the 90 percent target at the end of the project. However, during the same period, the 
occupancy in the East (where the project is operating) went from 21.6percent to 68percent above the end of 2014 target 
of 45percent. Notably, streamlining licensing procedures has reduced the number of days in registration from 147 to 30, 
again below the target of 75 days.

submitting the national budget audit to parliament (now 8 months, when it was 2 to 4 years in 
early 2008.) In addition, public audit coverage has extended from 50 percent of the public sector 
in 2008 to 100 percent as of May 2011.    

36. 

37. 

The CAS Progress Report eliminated several results where the dialogue between the 
government and the WBG was making limited headway. The World Bank support for SOE 
reform did not materialize after early-on analytical work was completed; however, the IMF 
program is focusing on reducing the losses of the SOE sector to help buttress the fiscal stand of 
the public sector and open space to finance a more aggressive public investment program in line 
with the objectives of government. The Progress Report eliminated reference to establishment of 
a framework for PPPs. Although the Government has not established a formal framework for 
PPP, it has engaged international partners in the construction of infrastructure arrangements that 
in the view of the government are PPP-like arrangements.  Expected outcomes on improving 
budgetary practices were also scaled backed in the Progress Report. The information available 
suggests limited progress was made during the CAS period in improving public expenditure 
practices. On public procurement, after disbanding the National Procurement Agency, a new 
Project Implementation Unit at the Ministry of Finance and Planning is tracking procurement, but 
no indicators are available to judge that this is an improved arrangement.  Regarding, Public 
Financial Management, a unified treasury remains in place, but commitment control remains a 
challenge. The Government would benefit from a thorough stocktaking, such as through a PEFA, 
to set a baseline to track the impact of policy actions to improve the quality of fiscal governance 
in the future.  

Strategic Objective 3: Improving the Quality of Services and Accountability. Provision of 
High Quality, Relevant and Cost Effective Public Services, Including in Conflict-Affected 
Areas  

Sri Lanka has traditionally posted a strong performance in health, education and social 
assistance achieving levels similar to those of countries with higher levels of income. The 
CAS program under this objective was built on a long-standing relationship between the WBG 
and the country to continue its support for stronger health and education outcomes and 
commenced assistance to improve the national social assistance program. The World Bank 
support for  primary education and health is being done in cooperation with the provincial and 
local governments through SWAP operations, which have been well received and set the basis for 
more ambitious results-based approaches in the future within the framework of strengthening 
local governments. Work under this strategic objective has benefited from grant financing, 
especially on the area of social protection. The grants have proven effective in assisting the 
government in defining the scope and direction of the policy agenda in social assistance.  

 Outcome 3.1:  Improving Quality, Relevance and Governance of Education 

38. 

Access, quality and retention rates in basic education improved during this CAS. School 
survival rates through grade nine increased from 78 percent in June 30, 2005 to 91 percent in June 
30, 2011 and the proportion of primary school students attaining competence in mathematics 
increased from 67 percent to 82 percent during the same period. 74Access to basic education and 
secondary education was improved through the activation of school attendance committees,

expansion of basic facilities such as classrooms, water and sanitation, school health and nutrition 
programs for poor children, and special and non-formal education. The improvement of the 
quality of education was achieved through curriculum modernization, teacher development and 
delivery of textbooks on time. In additional, the school-based management approach was 
expanded from 16 zones (17 percent of all zones) to all zones in the country. The support has 
been provided through the Education Sector Development Project, which was completed in June 
2011. The recently completed ICR (dated December 19, 2011) rates the project as satisfactory on 
all aspects, with moderate risks to development outcomes. The ICR highlights the usefulness of 
the SWAP approach in the context of decentralization and the major contributions resulting from 
that increasing community and parental involvement.  

The CAS contributed to improved educational outcomes in undergraduate education and 
enhanced multi-ethnic awareness early on in the learning process. The IT achievement scores 
of undergraduates have risen from 49 percent in 2005 to 56 percent in 2008, the year the targeted 
intervention, Institutional Block Grants, was completed. The achievement of development 
outcomes under the Improving Relevance and Quality of Undergraduate Education Project was 
ranked as satisfactory by the team and as moderately satisfactory by IEG, who recognized the 
achievement of highly relevant development objectives but questioned on the lack of evidence for 
the efficient use of project resources. The project contributed to implementing IT learning and 
English improvement learning programs in all universities.  The school curriculum promotes 
bilingual education and includes civics as a subject. Multi-ethnic and multicultural curriculum 
review committees are over-seeing the design and delivery in the areas of civics, history and 
English. 75 

Support for education was further strengthened during the second half of the CAS. The 
Higher Education for Twenty First Century (FY10) Project aims to enhance the capacity of the 
higher education system. The design of the project benefited from analytical work such as Towers 
of Learning: Higher Education Report (FY09) that has been widely disseminated and consulted. 
Already, progress has been made in the development of a national qualifications framework and 
legislation has been approved to enable registration, quality assurance and accreditation of state 
and non-state higher education in line with the Higher Education Development Strategy of the 
government. Observers in the country and abroad consider this a major institutional achievement 
in Sri Lanka. In addition, the Transforming School Education as the Foundation of a Knowledge 
Hub Project (FY12) seeks to further enhance the quality of primary and secondary education as 
the foundation for the knowledge-based economic and social development of the country. 
Building on previous efforts that have increased the completion rate at grade nine, this project 
proposes to improve the completion rate at grade 11 and the national assessments of learning 
outcome for key subjects.  It also aims to strengthen governance and delivery of education 
services.76 

Outcome 3.2:  Improving Health and Social Protection Services 

41. 

The significant progress that Sri Lanka has made in health translates into a high level of life 
expectancy (75 years) that compares well with indicators from higher middle-income 
countries. The long life expectancy and the dropping fertility rates have meant that Sri-Lanka is

experiencing a rapid demographic transition (mainly characterized by an ageing population. The 
World Bank’s study Demographic Transition (FY08) study examined the consequences of this in 
detail and which it’s contributing now to a rich national dialogue on its implication for 
development opportunities in all sectors of the economy.   

The World Bank worked directly with the nine provinces of Sri Lanka, as well as the 
central Ministry of Health to deliver a stronger national primary health network.  A sign of 
increased administrative planning and monitoring capacity at the provincial level is that all 
districts are now using a logical framework and reporting regularly on performance, while when 
in 2006 only 26.9 percent did so.  The contribution of the World Bank has been through the 
Health Sector Development Project and Additional Financing, whose development outcomes 
have been rated as moderately satisfactory by the management77. This rating reflects initially 
over-ambitious objectives and immeasurable indicators chosen at project preparation, and the 
transfer of significant project resources for the tsunami relief operation; but, delivery on the 
revised objectives / indicators was satisfactory. The project has contributed to a reduction in 
infant and maternal mortality as well as to a lower disparity in these indicators across regions. In 
addition, the project contributed to improved administrative output indicators, including for 
increased utilization of lower level hospitals and improvements in screening services for selected 
non communicable diseases (NCD), and better emergency health care through newly established 
emergency treatment units.  The project also made a substantial contribution (especially through 
its additional financing) to the post-conflict reconstruction of health facilities in the Northern and 
Eastern provinces. 

The World Bank is supporting government’s efforts to address the challenges of non-
communicable diseases and malnutrition.  The World Bank’s analytical work has focused on 
the health challenges arising from increased burden incidence of non-communicable diseases, 
made more severe with the aging of the population, as noted in the corresponding World Bank 
prepared  Study of the Aging (FY08). The Government has issued a National Action Plan for 
prevention of NCDs which includes a national surveillance system, whose design has benefited 
from the Health Delivery System Review and Non-Communicable Diseases Strategy (FY10.) The 
IFC in turn has invested in an additional private hospital while the portfolio hospital project, rated 
mostly successful in its most recent development outcome, was completed in September 2011. 
The World Bank mobilized trust funds78 to design community-based nutrition interventions. 
Further trust funds were received from the Japan Social Development Fund to finance a project 
on improving nutrition outcomes among vulnerable population groups in the Northern Province,  
using the community based design.  This project has successfully introduced community based 
nutrition interventions linking the service providers with the community to improve nutrition 
outcomes.   

The World Bank began to support selected aspects of Social Assistance reform with trust 
fund financing. First, the IDF grant Improving the Monitoring and Evaluation of the Samurdhi 
Safety Net Program is financing the development and testing of a comprehensive Management 
Information System (MIS) for the Samurdhi Food Stamp and Cash Transfer Program, Sri Lanka's 
largest transfer program. The IDF grant will be used to design and pilot the new MIS in three 
selected locations. The Government of Sri Lanka has committed funds to replicate the system in 
three additional locations. It is expected that the experiences of the six locations, upon evaluation, 
will form the basis for the scaling up of the MIS across all other locations across the country 
where the program operates. Second, the Rapid Social Response Multi Donor Trust Funded

V. 

49. 

The WBG delivery of results regarding environmental protection has been mixed. Highly 
positive results were achieved on renewable energy, but efforts to support preservation of the 
biodiversity of the country fell through, when the government’s priorities changed.  

The IFC and the World Bank work on renewable energy is contributing to an improved 
environment, specifically through WBG contributions to reduction in greenhouse emissions. 
As has been noted, both the World Bank and the IFC have provided effective support to an 
renewable energy effectiveness initiative that has not only helped connect people in rural areas  to 
electricity but also increase the supply of electricity while abating energy emissions. The 
Renewable Energy for Rural Economic Development Project has contributed an estimated 1.75 
million tons of carbon abatement based on projects commissioned to date. The IFC supported 
projects have also contributed in this regard, as reported in paragraph 17.  

The IFC has been actively involved in the environment sector. IFC has been committed to 
ensuring that all current and future clients meet Environment Performance Standards.  IFC’s 
Advisory Services have been working with SMEs on upgrading environment protection. SME 
Hotel operators are being assisted with achieving operational efficiencies (such as energy 
efficiency practices, quality standards) and obtaining the US green Building Council’s Green 
Building Certification.  

The CAS objective centered on the preservation of the country’s rich bio-diversity could not 
be delivered. The activities foreseen under the CAS included attention to management of the 
elephant human conflict and the rationalization of tourism flows to the national parks.  Following 
on preliminary analytical work and in line with the national strategy, the Ecosystems 
Conservation and Management Project reached the negotiation stage, at which point the 
government proposed substantial changes to the design that would have substantially altered the 
original development objectives. As a result, the project preparation was stopped which has 
meant a postponement of the intended World Bank work through the project and affected the 
delivery of intended results during this CAS.   

World Bank Group Performance 

A large share of commitments and disbursements went towards the rehabilitation of the 
conflict-affected areas.    The World Bank committed a total of US$1016.5 million of IDA and 
IBRD79 resources and has disbursed US$579.4 millions during the CAS period, as of January 31, 
2012. The undisbursed balance increased from US$483.0 million at the beginning of the CAS to 
reach US$582.8 million by January 31, 2012. In FY09 at the beginning of the CAS, 13 projects 
were under implementation of which three focused on conflict-related areas, as of January 2012 
five out of 13 projects did. Out of the total disbursements during the CAS period around 
33percent went to conflict areas and 63percent went to both infrastructure and conflict areas.  

79 This includes US$213 million of IBRD resources for the Metro Colombo Project expected to go to Board in March 
15, 2012.

Delivery of projects differed from the planned program.  As detailed in Table 2 comparing 
planned IDA/IBRD Lending Program for FY09-12 and actual deliveries, five of the 15 proposed 
lending activities, were dropped. Four Additional Finance operations were approved.80   Table 3 
shows that of the 12 AAA activities in the original CAS, three were dropped and two refocused. 
As of September 2011, four projects, three AF operations and four AAA activities, which had not 
been foreseen in the CAS, were added, along with additional technical assistance support that had 
not been envisioned in the CAS. IFC’s program has also adapted to respond to emerging needs 
and opportunities over the course of the CAS period. 

Various reasons stood behind the difference between planned and actual delivery of 
projects.  First, the space opened by cancelled projects provided opportunities to finance conflict 
affected areas and infrastructure (roads) through additional financing, which has become a 
significant lending instrument during this CAS period, in terms of project performance, cost-
effectiveness and in enabling the World Bank to swiftly respond to unforeseen or emergency 
needs, such as for post-conflict reconstruction or in response to the 2010/2011 floods.   Second, 
cancelled projects reflected shifts in the preferences of government (environment), failure to 
make traction around a common vision that could be supported (agricultural competitiveness) or 
an overestimation of the pace at which an agenda could be developed (water.)  

Portfolio performance has remained steady and compares well with the performance of the 
region. The disbursement ratio was 33 percent for FY11 and 13.4 percent in FY12 as of January 
31, 2012. The percentage of projects at risk is 17 percent as of December 31, 2011, reflecting in 
part the relatively small number of projects in the portfolio. One project in the portfolio, the 
Second Community Development and Livelihood Project, is currently classified as a problem 
project with unsatisfactory ratings. The commitments at risk amount to 36 percent. A Portfolio 
Review in October, 2011 concluded that overall the portfolio is generally healthy and identified 
no major problems. The recommendations include strengthening procurement and further 
integrating PIUs into the implementing agencies.81 All projects completed during the CAS have 
been rated as either satisfactory or moderately satisfactory. The pro-activity is 100 percent.  

The current portfolio to implement and deliver results early in the next CPS period is quite 
concentrated. As of end-January 2012, the active IDA portfolio in Sri Lanka consists of 13 
projects with a net commitment value of US$ 1,074.1 million. The share of undisbursed resources  
available for both conflict areas and infrastructure amounts to 61 percent as of January 2012.  
Two education projects that have been approved recently account for 23 percent of the total 
undisbursed balance as of January 2012. Recent approvals and additional financing are shifting 
alignment towards growth and competitiveness issues (SME financing, tourism, higher education, 
and e-Sri Lanka) and thus responding to concerns of the government about the concentration of 
the World Bank agenda on IDA priorities.  

The satisfactory performance of SWAP operations has set a solid basis for results-based 
approaches and for working with the provinces.  The design of some of the operations under 
the present CAS tested or piloted interesting approaches to delivering results—such as CDD, -
housing self-construction, etc. The broader long-term impact of these initiatives will depend on 
how the government incorporates them into its own regular programs. Two SWAPs, one in health 

80 One came from the previous CAS. Two were road projects. Another supported the impact of the 2010 rains on the 
conflict-affected areas.  
81 As of November 2011, the share of commitments are risk in Sri Lanka (15percent) compared to the South Asia 
countries was only higher tan India (12percent) and Bangladesh (9percent) and Afghanistan (14percent.) The 
disbursement ratio at midyear compared to 6.6 percent for India,  8.3 percent for Afghanistan and 7.7 percent for 
Pakistan.   

58 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                 
and one in education, successfully tested a different implementation approach. The SWAP 
instrument allowed the World Bank to work with the provinces in advancing national policies 
within the framework of implementing the decentralization mandate. For future lending, a 
programmatic approach is a better alternative as oppose to isolated smaller projects as reflected in 
a programmatic budget of the government.   

55. While some of AAA has been of good quality and effective, it has been narrowly focused 
with gaps in core products and limited alignment with the larger government priorities.  
The quality of some AAA, such as the work on health and education, is contributing to the 
national dialogue and had an impact either on policies or project designs. In certain areas the 
impact has been more limited, such as in agriculture and environment. In agriculture, this is 
because of divergent views between the government and the World Bank. In environment, the 
failure to agree on the content of the proposed project has delayed impact even though the issues 
raised by the World Bank’s analytical work are judged relevant by the sector government. There 
are two concerns with the AAA agenda that was developed and implemented during this CAS.  
First, gaps in traditional products such as Country Economic Memorandum (CEM), poverty 
assessment, Public Expenditure Reviews, and Public Financial Management impaired the 
capacity of the World Bank to engage in core areas of its competence. Second, the AAA was not 
aligned with the broad concerns of government and specifically with the ambitious transformation 
agenda of the current administration.  The AAA program was not relevant for the government and 
weakened the World Bank as an interlocutor as the government sought to further develop and 
implement its vision. This is being reversed at the end of the CAS with the preparation of 
strategic notes on several themes that are top priorities to government. 

56. 

57. 

58. 

The World Bank launched efforts to reach broader audiences through more forceful 
dissemination efforts.  The World Bank has been extending its outreach effort by responding to 
the dynamic dialogue on development carried out in the local press, including that in the two 
native languages, which plays an important role in shaping public opinion. The local press has its 
own dynamics apart from the English press.  The World Bank has begun to publish the Executive 
Summary of new AAA in Singhalese and Tamil in a first effort to breach this gap. This is a 
welcome step towards developing a more accurate view of the World Bank’s work in the country.  
In addition, the World Bank has involved local research institutions and think tanks in the 
preparation of key pieces of analytical work.  

IFC’s advisory services have also been supporting SMEs, providing technical assistance to 
financial institutions and maximizing linkages in tourism, ICT and agriculture. IFC’s 
completed sustainable tourism advisory project facilitated 555 SME contracts and US$1.12 
million in collective sales revenues for participatory MSMEs in FY08-11. In response to the 
growing interest in PPPs, IFC, in collaboration with the World Bank and World Bank Institute 
(WBI), held a well-received workshop in Colombo on the topic for government and the private 
sector. 

IFC has increased the number of new commitments and sought to diversify its portfolio 
during this CAS period. Annual commitments will have averaged around US$45 million during 
FY09-11. New commitment volumes in Sri Lanka had peaked at US$175 million in FY08, in the 
wake of two large transactions. Since FY09 through December CY2011, IFC has invested a total 
of US$238 million (including $19 million mobilized from external partners) in 20 projects.  
These encompassed diverse sectors, such as renewable energy (including its first direct 
investment in wind power), healthcare and the financial market (including Global Trade Finance 
Program (GTFP) trade finance facilities and IFC’s first direct investment in a private equity 
fund). As of November 2011, IFC’s committed portfolio of US$198 million (not including a 

59 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
mobilized amount) consisted of ICT companies promoting enhanced communication access, 
financial institutions supporting SMEs and sustainable energy, a credit rating agency, hospitals, 
and a Sri Lankan hotel operator active in the region. The portfolio is generally performing well. 
IFC’s investment and/or advisory support for the financial sector has focused on developing local 
banks’ capacity to provide trade financing, renewable energy financing, SME- and agri-finance, 
and household access to finance. IFC has been providing locally-scarce financial instruments, 
such as risk capital, trade finance guarantees, and risk sharing facilities. Risk sharing facilities, 
structured with a first-loss partial guarantee from the Global Environment Facility (GEF), are 
helping two leading national banks develop know-how in financing private sustainable energy 
projects. IFC is also supporting leading private hospitals to help meet the country’s growing 
demand for healthcare. 

Trust Fund (TF) resources have supported key CAS initiatives, but the TF portfolio is 
dispersed adding to the costs of coordination. The commitments available from TF sources 
amounted to US$ 42.175 million in 39 operations. Eight operations over US$1 million each, 
accounted for 75 percent of the total. TF resources have served various purposes. Several have 
complemented World Bank operations, such as the Northern Emergency Project, and Energy for 
Rural Development. Other TF operations are filling gaps, such as nutrition in the Northern region 
and access to finance in the Southern region. Others are serving to scout reform options, as in the 
on-going work on social assistance that is financed from several trusts funds. Likewise IFC’s 
private sector development support benefited from donor support, including Norway for the Sri 
Lanka Development Facility, and NIPP82 and DevCo83 for the South Asia Infrastructure Facility. 
The latest Country Portfolio Review (November, 2011) noted that there are delays between the 
approval and effectiveness of trust funds, with high transaction costs for all. In addition, TF 
activity was not evenly integrated into the results framework of the CAS.  

Government’s access to international finance and the emergence of new partnerships with 
major regional powers changed significantly the financing opportunities for the country 
during the implementation of this CAS. First, the government has issued 2 (10-years) US$ 1 
billion rounds of bonds in the international markets. This instrument was not available in the past, 
but is now, as the country’s paper is rated as BB-. Second, the emergence of China and India as 
the dominant bi-lateral partners has enabled the government to start undertaking ambitious 
infrastructure projects. Third, the weight of traditional Overseas Development Assistance (ODA), 
as defined by the OECD, has been decreasing since 2005, when support came in to help the 
country in the aftermath of the Tsunami. The architecture of the development community has yet 
to adjust to this emerging reality. The mixed IDA/IBRD status will provide the opportunity to 
develop a new CPS consistent with the middle-income status of the country and shift from an 
exclusive IDA focus that the government deem incomplete.

The CAS Completion Report rates the achievement of results, as amended by the CAS 
Progress Report, as moderately satisfactory. The program achieved good progress toward most 
major expected outcomes, with some slight shortcomings. Under the first pillar, the program

supported a rapid resettlement of displaced persons; it contributed towards increasing access to 
electricity and water in rural and conflict areas and the supply of housing available for 
resettlement; and, through a CDD approach, has helped in engaging marginalized communities in 
their own development.  In addition, it played the important function of signaling to the 
international community the progress made in resettling displaced persons.  

Under pillar 2, the program, working with other development partners and under the 
leadership of the government, contributed to road rehabilitation.  The contribution of the 
program towards improving access to ITC services by the public and small and medium 
enterprises and a better interface between the public and private sectors is notable and has been 
widely acknowledged within the World Bank and by external observers. Progress under the 
tourism project is likewise notable. The contribution of the WBG to improving the business 
environment helped reduce the number of days to open a business, but engagement on PPP and 
SOE reform did not materialize as originally expected and the Progress Report had to scale down 
the expectations about results. The contribution of the program to the institutional improvement 
of the budgetary framework was limited as acknowledged by the Progress Report.  

Under pillar 3, the CAS delivered strong results in education and in health in line with 
expectations. The impact on education has gone beyond delivering outcomes as the analytical 
work has had an impact on the national discourse on higher education and contributed to the 
introduction of reforms that have opened greater scope for the private sector in the delivery of 
education services while setting in place an accountability framework for both public and private 
institutions to ensure adherence to quality standards.  The health program contributed to 
improving local sector institutions and indirectly to improved health outcomes nationwide. The 
analytical work on health is contributing to a dialogue on future adjustments to the health system 
to address the rising challenges of non-communicable deceases and the aging of the population. 
On-going social assistance work, with the support of trust funds, is providing inputs for the 
government as it examines options to improve the effectiveness of the current extensive system of 
social assistance.  

The agenda on the environment, under pillar 4, made a contribution to increasing the 
supply of generation capacity from renewable sources at a pilot scale setting the basis for a 
larger contribution towards closing the energy gap as the economy expands. These 
interventions have abated carbon emissions.  The remaining environment agenda was derailed 
when the foreseen project was stopped at the point of negotiation, due to a change in 
government’s priorities, despite considerable efforts that included prior analytical work and 
extensive dialogue.  

Regarding the crosscutting CAS agenda, the delivery of results in support of conflict-
affected areas was strong.  Achievements on the transparency and accountability agenda were 
mixed, with progress on demand-side of governance through the work involving communities in 
their own development and the institutional improvements in health and education. However, 
results on core governance (under the second pillar) felt short of the initial expectations, with the 
Progress Report eliminating most of the results that appeared in the original CAS.  

WBG Performance  

66. 

The CAS Completion Report rates the performance of the World Bank and the IFC as 
moderately satisfactory.  The design the program was relevant and made a contribution to the 
achievement outcomes by responding to government priorities and country needs. In responding 
to emerging priorities and needs (post-conflict) the World Bank exhibited flexibility, as noted by 

61 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the Progress Report. The management of the World Bank’s portfolio, which compares favorably 
with the region, provided a steady flow of resources and contributed to the delivery of resources. 
However, in a few cases delays in project implementation made it necessary to revise the original 
targets set under the CAS. Quality AAA in education and health contributed to a national policy 
dialogue and project design; however, lack of timely AAA in the critical areas of growth and 
governance limited the World Bank’s ability to engage the government fully in areas that the 
CAS had identified as a priority. This is being remedied now at the end of the CAS through the 
on-going production of policy notes to advance the dialogue in the preparation of the forthcoming 
CPS. These efforts are an important first step in addressing the skepticism of the government 
regarding the role of the World Bank as a source of policy advice. That skepticism has arisen in 
part from the presumption that the World Bank does not respond to local realities and rather 
resorts to general remedies.  

The CAS Progress Report was prepared relatively late during the CAS due to the vacuum 
created by the delay in appointing a new World Bank Country Director. At the end of the 
CAS, the portfolio was heavily concentrated in a few areas of engagement: reconstruction of 
conflict-afflicted areas and roads. However, the WGB is beginning to give more attention to 
growth and competitiveness issues, both in AAA and lending, especially with the availability of 
IBRD resources. 

The IFC maintained a limited but targeted engagement and its work complemented the 
World Bank in areas like finance, IT, and renewable energy, contributing to strong results 
delivery. The IFC continued solidifying its presence and PSD engagement in Sri Lanka and has 
led the program in several areas helping to build local capacity to address financial inclusion, 
enterprise development, and climate change. The IFC complemented well advisory services and 
investment activities.  IFC, like the World Bank made limited traction in advancing the PPP and 
the deregulation agendas.

VII. Lessons and recommendations 

69. 

70. 

The forthcoming CPS is being prepared in an environment very different from that in 
which the previous CAS was prepared. Internal armed conflict has ended; economic growth is 
fast and the mandate of the government is strong. The government seeks a rapid transformation of 
the economy within a very specific vision of the country in the region and the world. The 
challenge for the government is to develop the concrete steps, policies and investments to reach 
this vision.  The World Bank needs to support government in responding to these challenges. The 
experience during the implementation of this CAS provides several lessons that are relevant for 
the design and implementation of the next strategy.  

Strategy Design and Implementation  

Flexibility in both design and implementation of a strategy is necessary to deliver a 
program in an uncertain and evolving environment. This CAS strategy ended up with a 
flexible implementation to accommodate emerging developments and shifts in policy stance. As a 
result, the lending program differed from the original plan and the Progress Report revising the 
results framework. Even if now no major upheavals are expected, it is advisable to embed 
flexibility into the design of the next CAS. In a transitional context like Sri Lanka, it would help 
to adopt an exploratory stance, where a combination of AAA, dialogue and pilot engagements is 
used to explore the likelihood of successful engagement as areas of potential engagement open 

62 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
up. A Progress Report strategically timed and hopefully at an earlier point in time than during this 
CAS can be used to further tighten the areas of engagement during implementation. 

71. Delivery is likely to be more effective in areas where the World Bank supports the revealed 
priorities of the government on the ground. The government’s commitment to infrastructure, 
resettlement, IT, education and health provided a solid ground for World Bank engagement. 
However, the CAS committed to deliver results in areas where either the government had not 
articulated a precise agenda.  Consistent with a flexible stance, the next strategy may want to the 
limit its commitments to areas where solid programs are in place for delivery and to adjust the 
program as new agreements come into place. It may also engage the government in development 
of a monitoring instrument to track progress in national goals such as the reduction in regional 
disparities.  

72. 

73. 

74. 

The World Bank responded to the priorities of the government but could have been better 
prepared to respond to emerging priorities such as economic growth. The WBG responded 
appropriately to the priority that was given to rehabilitating conflict-affected zones and, more 
broadly, to help reduce regional disparities. In doing so, it concentrated a large share of its 
portfolio towards this objective. The downside has been a limited attention to other relevant 
issues of the development agenda, such as economic growth and public sector capacity building. 
The challenge moving forward will be to balance the response to the emerging priorities of a 
middle-income country with the reconstruction needs that remain. Since reducing regional 
disparities will remain of concern, the WBG can, first, support mainstreaming the lessons from 
past interventions, for instance, by focusing its support on budget programs through instruments 
such as P4R or sector DPLs. And, second, it can look for complementarities between social 
inclusion and strengthening the productive capacity of provinces within the context of 
diversification and competitiveness. Moving to a growth and competitiveness agenda need not 
mean abandoning inclusion and reconciliation.  

IFC  
The strategy of channeling resources through the banking system and of strengthening the 
alignment between IFC advisory services and investments worked well. Sri Lanka possesses 
a sound banking system, which both the IFC and the World Bank used effectively to channel 
resources, for instance, to engage the private sector in sustainable energy generation and in 
transferring resources to SMEs during the economic slowdown. The lesson is that anchoring 
support on strong local institutions helps by-pass local capacity constraints.  In addition, in line 
with global guidelines, IFC work on the ground stressed the alignment between advisory and 
investment activities.  For instance, in projects such as Dialog, the advisory intervention 
broadened the range of benefit/beneficiaries that are being supported.  

It takes a longer-than-anticipated time for private sector investment to pick up in post-
conflict markets.  Expectations for a rapid pick-up in private investments after the conflict ended 
proved to be overly optimistic.  The corporate/private sector may not have felt comfortable to 
make investments until peace was firmly cemented, including an easing of tensions with the 
international community, and how the new Government would rebuild the ground for the private 
investment.  On the latter, the signals of the Government regarding its commitment to a positive 
investment climate for the private sector have been perceived as mixed by potential investors. 
The lesson that emerges is that in post-conflict countries stronger and unambiguous messages are 
needed to motivate a strong engagement of the private sector. Going forward continued attention 
to the quality of the broad business environment is needed to enhance the opportunities for the 
private sector support in the country.  

63 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Projects  

75. 

Appropriate design and timely implementation of programs and projects is required for the 
effective delivery of results. Regarding design, two issues stand out during this CAS. The first is 
the importance of designing relevant and realistic results frameworks for projects and for the 
CAS. Several ICRs (health and water) illustrated how unrealistic results designs harm the 
perception of achievements, even when these achievements have been substantial. Likewise, the 
CAS Progress Report found it necessary to scale back initial expectations about results in part due 
to the progress in project implementation. Regarding implementation, the negative impact of 
delays on the reputation of the World Bank is of significance. The latest Portfolio Review 
(October, 2011) identifies procurement weaknesses and limited integration of PIU units into the 
public administration as factors that need attention. It also pointed out to the need to balance the 
contribution of trust funds in advancing programs, with the high transactions costs for trust fund 
approval and implementation.  The second pertains to the selection of instruments suitable for the 
specific conditions of the country and the sectors. Here, the SWAPs in health and education were 
suited to support strengthening service delivery at the local level. Likewise the design in support 
of resettlement combined attention to meeting national commitments, with support for 
rehabilitation in the conflict areas.  

AAA 

76. 

Quality AAA can contribute to the national dialogue on policy and better ground the 
dialogue with the government. The effective dissemination of quality analytical work on 
education has had a positive impact on policy reform and policy design. Similarly, other 
analytical work on demography and health is contributing to policy dialogue nationwide. Going 
forward, it is advisable that the WBG fills the AAA gaps regarding growth and public sector 
management to be in a better position to engage the government on a dialogue around the options 
to unbundle and implement its vision of rapid and sustained growth. In doing so, the WBG should 
rely on evidenced-based arguments and by focusing on options rather than definite prescriptions.  

77. Outreach efforts to the broader constituencies are a powerful instrument to increase the 
understanding of the issues and the reform options.  With a literate population, an active press 
and strong civil society organizations, dissemination is a powerful tool for contributing to the 
national debate on development choices. In broadening the outreach, the WBG though needs to 
continue to go beyond English to the two national languages. The dialogue in the local languages 
dominates the policy discussion, with substantial variation in content and tone. The World Bank 
has already commenced by publishing the executive summary in the two languages. Further 
efforts at outreach would be consistent with shift in strategy that is ahead.

helping the government address 
these challenges. The positive 
results (foremost the rapid 
resettlement of refugees) reflect 
government commitment, 
World Bank and other donors’ 
rapid response and an increased 
allocation of (IDA) resources 
towards these objectives.  

This experience exemplifies the 
importance of the a flexible 
approach that responds to 
emerging developments,.  

The challenge ahead will be 
aligning continued support for 
increasing economic 
opportunities in conflict 
affected areas with  he 
government growth strategy 
that emphasizes strong growth 
poles throughout the island.  
These two goals are quite 
compatible.

Redressing the infrastructure 
gap has been a top government 
priority that has received the 
support of the donor 
community. Major institutional 
gains have been made and 
results delivered. A key lesson 
learned here is the importance 
of the government leadership in 
coordinating the contribution of 
traditional donors.   

The challenge ahead lies in 
shifting the focus from 
infrastructure to logistics with 
the view to develop efficiency 
corridors that improve the 
integration of the domestic 
economy and link it with the 
external markets.

CAS Outcome 2.2: Improving the Business Environment for Stronger Entrepreneurship and a Knowledge-Based Economy 

 Share of commercial lending for 
SMEs from World Bank 
increased by 10 percent.   

 20 e-government services 
established and used by private 
sector (Baseline: zero as of 
2008)   

 Achieved:  Share of commercial lending for SMEs has increased by 
15 percent as per CAS Progress Report.   

Note: World Bank support for lending to the SME sector has come 
through the Small and Medium Enterprise Development Facility 
Project approved in FY11. As of 01-12-2011, 209 loans had been 
processed and 46 approved, with 75 percent more than three-year 
maturity. The total amount of resources made available had reached 
US$4.4 million. (ISR—April-2011)  

  Achieved: 130 e-government informational services offered 03-11- 
2011 (ISR –e-Sri Lanka Project.)  

(Note: Contribution of the e-Sri Lanka Project and parallel IFC efforts 
go far beyond the above indicator. See, ISR 03-11-2011.)  

 Time to start up a business 
reduced by 25 percent (70 days 
as of 2008)  

 Achieved: 35 days as per the 2012 Doing Business report, a 50 
percent reduction.

WBG support for improving the 
business environment was 
effective but limited, especially 
given the importance the 
government assigns to rapid 
economic growth. The 
intervention to support IT 
development in government and 
the private sector has been very 
effective and is a good  example 
of a well targeted operation that 
responds to the strategic priority 
of the government.  

Channelling resources through 
the financial sector worked well 
both for the IFC and the World 
Bank and helped by-pass local 
capacity constraints. 

.Arguably the lack of up-to-date 
analytical work affected the 
capacity of the WBG to engage 
more effectively around the 
growth agenda. A strong lesson 
that emerges is the need to be

CAS Outcome 2.3:  Improving the Strategic Relevance and Transparency of Public Spending 

 Share of budget expenditures 
classified as ‘other’ in the 
MTEF reduced to 5 percent (30 
percent in 2006)  

 Quasi-fiscal losses of SOEs 
reduced to less than 0.5 percent 
of GDP (2 percent in 2006)  

 Improved public procurement, 
public financial management 
and parliamentary oversight 
over public spending  

 Achieved: As of 2011, no budget expenditures are categorized as 
‘other’—CAS Progress Report 

 Target eliminated by the CAS Progress Report.  
World Bank support for SOE did not materialize after an early on 
analytical work was completed due to lack of government’s demand. 

 Partial Progress. No noted progress in either public financial 
management or public procurement, but some progress has been 
made in improving parliamentary oversight over public spending: 
(a) external auditing has widened to 100 percent of the public 
sector now, when it was 50 percent in 2008, and (b) the Audit 
Agency is in time with the annual audit plan rather than 2 to 4 
years late in 2008..(ISR Public Administration Project.)

The limited impact of the 
program supporting the 
strategic relevance and the 
transparency of public spending 
was partly the result of low 
government interest, lack of 
supporting analytical work and 
the difficulties with 
implementing the Public Sector 
Capacity Building Project, with 
the exception of the support to 
the office of the Auditor 
General that has worked well. 
Efforts are underway to build a 
program that can help Sri Lanka 
strengthen its country systems 
and develop effective results 
oriented budget programs. It is 
advisable that this area become 
a priority in the next strategy.

The supporting environment in 
education contains all of the key 
elements for successful 
cooperation. Strong institutions 
in education have steered the 
delivery of strong results over a 
long period of time. The 
analytical work of the World 
Bank in education was amply 
discussed and disseminated. 
The government has undertaken 
important institutional reform in 
tertiary education.  The World 
Bank has worked with regions 
in improving results at the local 
level. All expected outcomes 
under the CAS were delivered.  

One lesson for cooperation in 
other sectors is to take a long 
term perspective to build solid 
results overtime. Another lesson 
that emerges is the importance 
of SWAPs and results-based 
instruments to implement

The country has sustained the 
improving trend in health 
indicators, such as maternal and 
infant mortality. The 
contribution of the World Bank 
has come in supporting 
improved managerial practices 
at the local level. The analytical 
work of the World Bank has 
pointed out the challenges of 
the demographic transition and 
non-communicable diseases. As 
in the case of education, 
SWAPs and results-based 
instruments seem quite 
appropriate to help implement 
programs that have a strong 
regional focus.  Going forward

jointly with sector government 
officials, these events point to 
the type of risks that can arise 
today in Sri Lanka. Efforts 
should be made to mitigate 
these risks without 
compromising an open 
approach to cooperation.  

To the contrary the progress 
with increasing the supply of 
renewable energy and abating 
carbon emissions has been quite 
effective, even if at a pliot level. 
The experience provides a 
valuable experience for Sri 
Lanka and for other countries.

Annex 12: Sri Lanka Statistical Assessment 

Sri Lanka – Statistical Systems Review  
and Suggestions for Further Strengthening of Statistical Capacity 

Introduction 

1. 
Over the past decade – since the turn of the millennium Sri Lanka has made considerable progress 
-- transitioning from a low income country to a middle income country and seeing an end to the 30-year 
long armed conflict – which was the biggest impediment to country’s development. Indeed, post-conflict 
Sri Lanka presents considerable opportunities for investors – both domestic and foreigners to embark on 
wealth generating endeavors as well as for the policy makers to embark on crucial policy reforms that 
could truly unleash country’s full potential. It is at this juncture, crucial consideration of the adequacy of 
the country’s statistical systems to meet both these requirements comes into play. This note analyses the 
current position of the national statistical systems and how best it could be geared to face challenges of a 
new Sri Lanka. 

Overview of the Current Statistical Systems. 

2. 
Currently in Sri Lanka a number of institutions are engaged in the compilation of statistical data. 
On the real sector, the department of Census and Statistics (DCS) is the sole authority responsible for the 
preparation of National Accounts data, demographic and population data, labor force data, price indices, 
HIES and the poverty estimates. Earlier, prior to 2007, the Statistics Division of the Central Bank of Sri 
Lanka (CBSL) also prepared national accounts data in parallel with DCS84 but since that year this 
function has been solely assumed by the DCS85. The CBSL also maintains a fully fledged statistical 
division, and it continues to prepare data on provincial level GDP, district level price indices and many 
other statistics particularly on the monetary, banking & finance sectors and the BoP. The main source of 
fiscal data in the country is the Ministry of Finance and Treasury – which in turn relies on a number of 
agencies – such as the Inland Revenue Department, the Customs Department and the Excise Department 
to provide with data. The Customs Department is the main agency for the external trade data while 
several other agencies86 also provides various external sector related data.  

3. 
A Statistical Master Plan (SMP) for the country87  was developed in mid 2006 and this provided a 
basis for the STATCAP project of the bank (see box for a description of the project). The SMP 
underscored the importance of developing an appropriate statistical system (conforming to international 
standards) commensurate with needs of a middle income country. In addition, the SMP also laid focus on 
upgrading IT facilities, upgrading of skills of staff and moving towards a more efficient system of data 
gathering, coordination and data dissemination. One of the more important anticipations of the SMP was 
to establish a National Data Committee (NDC) – comprising officials from the Ministry of Finance88, 
CBSL, DCS and the independent research institution – the Institute of Policy Studies (IPS) to spearhead 
the activities of the SMP and chart its way forward. Unfortunately, the NDC did not get established until 
2010 – a time the DCS was contemplating shelving the SMP and move towards an Official Statistics Plan 
(OSP). 

84 With some discrepancies – particularly in National Accounts data observed for many years. 
85 Nevertheless, the CBSL has been entrusted with the task of preparing forecasts for the medium term macro framework – for 
which the DCS lacks sufficient capacity. 
86 Such as the CBSL, the Bureau of Foreign employment and the Board of Investment (BoI)  
87 Titled the Reform and Strengthening of the Sri Lanka Statistical System: A “Statistical Master Plan”, Department of Census 
and Statistics.  
88 The Deputy Secretary to the Treasury (DST) functions as the Chairman of the NDC.

4. 
The OSP is a five year plan that is expected to consolidate upon SMP and the experiences 
following the SMP. Ordinarily, OSP’s focus on a number of things including: (a) principles of official 
statistics (b) monitoring of evaluation; (c) statistical infrastructure ; (d) data quality assurance and (e) 
publication and dissemination. The DCS expects to embark on an OSP by first identifying the exact data 
requirements of the country through a comprehensive needs assessment identifying which agency will 
provide which information89 and in what frequency. In essence, the proposed OSP will define multiple 
responsibilities for the collection and compilation of statistical data.     

BOX: The World Bank Statistical Capacity Building (STATCAP) Project 

The Sri Lanka Public Sector Capacity Building Project was approved by the Board in mid 
2008 and became effective on September 5, 2008. The project was geared to enhance the 
effectiveness, efficiency and productivity of two key public sector agencies, Department of 
Census and Statistics (DCS) and Auditor General’s Department (AGD) through an investment 
package 
that 
included organizational strengthening, capacity building, 
information 
management, communication improvements, physical and information technology (IT) 
infrastructure, and Information and Communication Technology (ICT) support. A total of US$ 
22.65Mn was allocated for the project – of which US$ 12.05Mn was for the DCS component 
and US$ 10.55Mn for the AGD component.  

The project has most recently been rated as Moderately Unsatisfactory for Project 
Development Objective (PDO) and Implementation Progress (IP), primarily due to delays in 
the construction of the building for the DCS. However the PDO and IP under Part 2 (AGD 
component) of the Project have been consistently rated as Satisfactory. As a result, the team 
concurred in late 2011 to cancel all undisbursed balances under the DCS component and 
extend the project closing date (earlier set for 31 December 2011) by one year to support 
remaining work only under the AGD component.  

The Supply and Demand Consideration: National Level Statistics 

5. 
With the country making a transition to middle income status and considerable opportunities 
opening up after the end of the war, the need for credible and timely data for investment analysis, project 
appraisals and measurement of policy efficacy have been increasingly felt. At present, Sri Lanka has a 
statistical system that appears fairly adequate for a low income country. Its statistical capacity score -- as 
estimated by the World Bank in 2011, was 78 percent compared to an average for all IDA countries of 62 
percent. Over the years various statistical agencies have systematically improved data coverage, 
periodicity and timeliness of data90 with several of these agencies (in particular DCS and CBSL) having 
advance release calendar which informs of the release of various data in advance91. By and large the 
CBSL functions as the defacto statistical repository with data from many different institutions (including 
DCS and CBSL itself) being compiled and published on a regular basis. The CBSL flagship weekly 
economic indicator (WEI) and the monthly economic indicator (MEI) serve as the two most 
comprehensive statistical dissemination vehicles which provide regular updates of key economic data.    

89 Or assume responsibility for that piece of information.  
90 For example, headline inflation numbers are announced by the last day of the month – compared to the 1-month lag earlier.  
91 Adherence to the advance release calendars has also been very consistent. .

ii. 

6. 
Notwithstanding the significant strides made in improving the coverage and timeliness of 
statistical data a few shortcomings still underlie the supply side: 
i. 
Firstly, several aggregate level statistics lacks sufficient timeliness. The DCS – who assumes the 
primary responsibility for preparing national accounts, still does not produce within year (or 
interim) aggregate demand data92 – which is a considerable shortcoming. There is a clear need to 
see this data at least on a semi-annual (or if possible, quarterly) basis. In addition, several other 
macroeconomic indicators also lack sufficient timeliness. Monetary aggregates prepared by 
CBSL have a 3-month time lag93 while those of fiscal, external trade, wages and industrial 
production also comes with a 3-month lag. Key banking sector indicators comes with at least a 6-
month lag.   
There have also been issues obtaining sufficient granular level information needed for analysis. 
Record level data from the DCS HH surveys and LFS are not readily accessible94. Potential users 
are first released a minimal 5percent sample – from which they have to build a case for the use of 
the data. The ‘proposal’ would then be evaluated by the DCS after which the full sample may be 
released subject to the discretion of the DCS. The CBSL also collects several high frequency data 
which is normally not published for various reasons. For example, central bank intervention in the 
currency markets and gross official reserve (GOR) figures are compiled on a daily basis – but are 
published after a 3-month lag! The most likely reason for this is to prevent any adverse reactions 
by market players during times of volatility95.  However, not having data in sufficient frequency 
and granularity also creates uncertainty – which could lead to unnecessary speculation and bring 
about instability in the markets. There is a clear need for statistical data to be more accessible and 
usable particularly through the vantage point of the private sector. A systematic move towards an 
‘open-data’ policy would benefit the country immensely.  
iii. At present, Sri Lanka subscribes to the IMF's General Data Dissemination System (GDDS). 
However, as a MIC needing to sustain high rates of investments the country may want to move 
onto Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS). With the momentum gained in recent times in 
developing the statistical system this could very well be an achievable medium-term goal.  A 
major focus in the transition would be to improve data timeliness, frequency96 whilst also catering 
to demands for more high-frequency, real time economic data. 

The main constraints faced by the National Statistical System and its use by the users.  

7. 
Several capacity limitations still underlie the NSS in the country.  One of the foremost constraints 
faced by the DCS – the main statistical agency in the country is the lack of a permanent abode to house its 
various units currently scattered in different parts of Colombo. To address this need the STATCAP 
project earmarked a sum of US$ 6.8Mn to establish a permanent office for  the DCS97 – amounting to 57 
percent of the total allocation under the DCS component (see box). However, due to various factors the 
project got delayed and with the cancellation of the remaining credit under the component the DCS now 
envisages to complete the building with GoSL funds and have it completed by 2014. Until such time a 
permanent office is established the DCS will not be expected to reach its full potential efficiency. 

8. 
Coordination among various statistical agencies in the management of the national statistical 
system could also be improved. Despite the progress made, the consensus is that existing coordination 
among various statistical agencies could be further improved particular through vehicles such as the 

92 Both nominal and real

95 Such as time of significant foreign outflows or one-time transactions which could be perceived wrongly. 
96 Particularly on National Accounts as discussed earlier. 
97 Under the ‘works’ component.

newly established NDC. The DCS currently has around 600 staff98 in decentralized offices, with several 
staff seconded to other line Ministries. At times certain ‘conflict of interest’ is witnessed when these staff 
are requested to attend to Ministry work in addition to DCS work. In parallel to statistical agencies 
improving coordination there is also a need for various donors supporting the development of statistical 
systems in the country to also optimize coordination among themselves so that the necessary support is 
provided sans duplication and overlap.    

9. 
On the user side, despite the significant improvement in data availability, coverage and 
periodicity the country still lacks a formal agency (government or private) that could provide formal data 
services to the clients99. As a result, for those who cannot afford expensive data solution from off-shore 
providers, considerable time and effort is spent on collecting data which at times undermines efficiency 
and timeliness of analysis/appraisals and research100.  Secondly, it is also clear that among various users 
the data awareness remains considerably weak – as many users are not fully aware of what type of data is 
available and their sources. This usually results in country missing out on very critical analysis at times 
and also an element of ‘wastage’ on the part of the sources who spend resources gathering information – 
which for most part remains ‘invisible’. 

10. 
The proposed OSP would greatly address the ‘invisibility’ aspect by compiling a formal list of 
data items to be gathered and identifying the associated responsibility so that ‘what’ type of data is 
available would no longer be relegated to guess work. More importantly by having a continues 
monitoring and feedback process the NSS would also be in a position to continually ‘upgrade’ itself both 
in terms of data span101 as well as portability. 

Prognosis and Recommendation to the CPS. 

ii. 

11. 
Through a review of the NSS and its related issues the team is of the view, that the country 
currently has an adequate platform of statistical systems to support results based management. However, 
the underlying issues looked at above also indicate a clear need for the bank engagement beyond the 
current STATCAP project to continue support the statistical system in the country. The salient 
recommendations to the CPS team in connection include: 
i. 
To examine means of providing support for the development of the OSP which would be a crucial 
landmark in the development of NSS in the country. 
To continue support the DCS in terms of necessary capacity building excluding any physical 
works. In particular, support towards continues staff training and ICT enhancement could be 
thought of provided they are carefully planned and outcomes monitored. In particular, country’s 
newly acquired MIC status may also mean that it transforms from a GDDS to a SDDS which the 
World Bank102 could support.  
To support the establishment of independent data solution providers103 (either public or private) to 
facilitate data provision to companies and the public sector. These providers will specialize in 
management of data (from various sources) and providing client services based on specific 
formats and requirements. The providers should also ensure adequate data quality assurance 
whilst also taking responsibility to update relevant data when necessary.

subscriber.

Annex 15: Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) Process 

1. 

The Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) has been a two track process.  (See figure below.)  The 
first track involved a thorough review of the Sri Lankan vision for development and the current situation 
with regard to each aspect of the vision.  The second track involved a thorough review of the World Bank 
Group’s engagement over the Country Assistance Strategy FY09-12 (CAS FY09-12) period. 

2. 

Country Vision.  The Government’s vision is laid out in the document “Mahinda Chintana 
Vision for the Future” prepared by the Department of National Planning, Ministry of Finance and 
Planning in 2010.   

3. 
Diagnosis of Achievements and Challenges.  The diagnosis of achievements and challenges is 
based on a wide variety of sources.  The Annual Reports of the Ministry of Finance and Planning and of 
the Central Bank of Sri Lanka were essential inputs, as was the “Global Partnership in Development” 
report of the External Resources Department of the Ministry of Finance and Planning.  The CPS 
consultations conducted by sector colleagues were used as an opportunity to hear from Government, 
private sector, civil society and development partners about the current situation and the challenges 
related to several themes.  (See below for more details on the consultations.)  Finally, issues notes were 
prepared by sector colleagues as part of the FY12 work program.  The purpose of these notes was to take 
stock of selected issues, fill specific knowledge gaps and explore opportunities for engagement.104  The 
notes included: 
 Agriculture  
 Environment  
 Transport  
 Urban  
 Water supply and sanitation 
 
Investment climate  
 Financial sector  
 Fiscal  
 Public procurement  

104 Issues notes were not prepared in areas where recent analytical work was available, such as education and health.

 Public financial management  
 Gender  
 National statistical systems  

4. 
Assessment of the Appropriate Role for the World Bank Group.  The review of World Bank 
Group engagement took several forms.  A portfolio review (jointly organized by the Department of 
Project Management and Monitoring of the Ministry of Finance and Planning and the World Bank) 
October 24-25, 2011, provided an opportunity to reflect on each project and the portfolio as a whole.  The 
Client Survey provided insight into how the World Bank’s work is perceived by stakeholders.  The 
quantitative Client Survey was supplemented with a qualitative Client Survey which provided more in-
depth perceptions through structured interviews.  Reflections on the existing and appropriate future role 
of the World Bank Group were discussed at meetings held September 14, 2011 in Washington and 
October 20-21, 2011 in Habarana, as well as in various staff meetings.  The Completion Report for the 
FY09-12 CAS evaluated the performance of the program and the World Bank and is included as an annex 
in the present document. 

5. 
Dialogue and Consultations.  Dialogue and consultations were held throughout the past year.  
Counterparts in the Department of National Planning and External Resources Department of the Ministry 
of Finance and Planning worked closely with the World Bank team throughout the entire process.  An 
extensive consultation process, involving Government counterparts, private sector, and civil society and 
development partners was also conducted throughout the process.  The consultations provided essential 
inputs into the diagnosis of achievements and challenges as well as providing feedback on the preliminary 
drafts of the CPSfor FY13-16.  A total of 18 consultations were organized, some focusing on a specific 
theme, others organized for a specific group of stakeholders.

World Bank Group Country Partnership Strategy.  The World Bank Group Country 
Partnership Strategy, described in the present document, is based on all of the above elements.

Annex 16: Summary of Consultations 

Consultation process 

1. 
A total of 18 consultations involving more than 400 participants were carried out amongst a wide 
cross section of Sri Lankan society as part of the preparation of this CPS.105 The participants at the 
consultations represented government ministers,  opposition members of parliament, central and 
provincial government officials, Local government representatives, a plethora of NGO’s covering a wide 
section including  youth, gender, environment,  advocacy and governance, representatives from Chambers 
of Commerce from the Northern, Eastern and southern province, Academics, think tanks, key members 
from large conglomerates, bankers and other representatives from the  financial sectors and also  bilateral 
and multi lateral donor and UN agencies. The process of consultation served a dual purpose by both 
allowing Sri Lankans to have an input into the country’s development agenda and by allowing the World 
Bank Group to further clarify its role in helping the Government of Sri Lanka achieve the results 
identified by the development policy framework of the government, in selected areas of comparative 
advantage where it could best contribute. 

2. 
The consultations were carried out from September to March, with early consultations being 
broader in scope and narrowing down as the CPS took shape over the preparation period. A total of nine 
consultations were broadly thematic and focused on the education, health, urban, environment, private 
sector, financial sector, SME’s, and transport sectors. The balance were broader and cross cutting in scope 
involving consultations with parliamentarians, the general public, the donor community, media personnel, 
and youth. 

3. 
Although a majority of the consultations were in Colombo, consultations with youth and SME’s 
took place in the northern, eastern, central and southern provinces. Theses consultations were an 
opportunity to capture geographic area specific, gender specific and national policy level challenges. The 
purpose of involving youth who are and have been beneficiaries of many World Bank supported projects 
and operations, from the conceptual stage of the Country Partnership Strategy, was to actively engage 
them as key stakeholders in World Bank operations in Sri Lanka from the very outset. The youth 
participating at the consultations represented young men and women from academic, civil society, 
government and private sectors. 

4. 
In order to ensure a structured discussion all participants were provided along with their 
invitations a two page introductory note that described the CPS process, the reason for consulting with 
that particular group, the key areas that the particular consultation would focus on, and a detailed agenda. 
All consultations began with brief introduction followed by a short presentation by a member of the CPS 
preparation team on the CPS process. The participants were informed from the outset that none of their 
comments would be individually attributed to them and that therefore they could be as candid as they 
wished. Simultaneous translation in Sinhala, Tamil and English was also provided at all consultations that 
took place out of Colombo. All consultations were well attended and a common complaint echoed by 
participants was that the two hour stipulated time limit was insufficient. 

5. 
The following is an attempt to extract some of the important issues captured owing to the 
difficulty in presenting all the ideas and comments received. The summary is presented thematically for 
easy reference.  

105 A comprehensive list of participants is available on request.

Health Sector consultation 

6. 
A health sector dialogue was held on the 30th of September, 2011 at the Galle Face Hotel.  
Participants included the Secretary of Health, Provincial Directors of Health Services from Western and 
Sabaragamuwa provinces, other government representatives, and private sector health service providers, 
Vice Chancellors, University Professors, representatives from the colleges of medical specialties, 
representatives from think tanks and a representative from the NGO sector. 

7. 
Gaps in clinical quality of care provided in both public and private health facilities were 
discussed. The necessity for the establishment of national accreditation systems, an independent quality 
assurance body, introduction of death audits, finalizing of a national essential drug policy to prevent 
excessive control by market forces to protect the majority of the population were highlighted. It was felt 
that improving access to the full package of care at the province level would better address geographical 
equity in Sri Lanka. Further the development of a National Health Development Plan (NHDP) for the 
health sector was identified as an important step in addressing geographical equity and overall health 
sector development. With the changing disease trends, ageing pattern and peoples’ health seeking 
behavior there was also an urgent need to reorient the health service delivery model to better provide long 
term, integrated care (different experts need to work together for managing the patient) and specialized 
elderly care. The existing quality of data and the new improvements needed for better data quality were 
also discussed in detail. Participants also felt that a stronger  focus should be placed on better utilization 
of health information for planning and budgeting purposes, with the existing health information system 
being  modernized (i.e., automated) to increase the reliance on the system data as seen in developed 
countries. 

8. 
The audience stressed that the World Bank should facilitate knowledge dissemination on private 
public partnerships specifically for the health sector, to introduce cross country learning by sharing best 
practices in areas where improvements are required in the health sector, and assist with studies concerning 
private health services models that could be applied to Sri Lanka.  

Urban sector consultations 

9. 
On the 22nd of September, 2011 a brainstorming meeting was held with a number of public and 
private sector representatives and World Bank staff to share early ideas on the vision for the future 
development of Metro Colombo, at the World Bank Colombo Country office. 

10. 
The main conclusion of the discussion on the City Vision was that the visioning exercise should 
be included in the development of the City Development Strategy.  The city’s vision should be a synthetic 
statement balancing the seemingly opposing challenges of managing environmental, social and economic 
sustainability with modernization, along with history together with development.  

11. 
To ensure this delicate balance, the vision of Colombo Metropolitan Area should be based on a 
series of inputs, that when integrated, provide a comprehensive picture of the city's present state of affairs 
along with the proposed next steps. 

12. 
On the 4th of October 2011, a full day consultative work shop was held at Hotel Renuka with the 
participation of government official, academics, participants from the donor community, and members 
from the private sector and World Bank Staff. 

13. 
There was consensus that the current statistical definition of urban areas based on administrative 
criteria (i.e. urban areas are defined by the administrative boundaries of Municipal Councils and Urban 
Councils) is inadequate to capture urbanization trends on the ground with a new definition of urban areas 

101 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
based on population/economic criteria needing to be developed. Urban sprawl was described as resulting 
from inefficient city management, which is in turn due to confusion about administrative authority and 
boundaries. There was also consensus that the traditional scope of urban services needed to be broadened 
to include social services. Limited capacity at local level is the main constraint for improved the delivery 
of urban infrastructure & services. Finance was a major constraint with participants discussing the need to 
move to a new model of municipal finance. Cluster-based systems of service delivery should be 
encouraged to improve efficiency and reduce costs in services provision at local level. Improving the 
competitiveness of secondary cities requires exploiting the unique character of each city. Growth will 
occur when cities are dynamic and vibrant and offer high quality services. 

Environment Sector Consultation 

14. 
On the 13th of January, 2012 a consultation with environmentalists, academics, members of the 
private sector and World Bank staff was held at the DFFCC bank conference room.  

15. 
The critical environmental issues that would need to be addressed in order to ensure 
environmental sustainability of Sri Lanka's rapid development program included urban environmental 
issues such as  flood management, solid waste management, the quality of urban environment, air 
pollution, water and sanitation. The fragmentation of the concept of  “Environment” into various agencies 
(and Ministries), some of which do not have a mandate to protect/conserve/manage the Environment; the 
lack of coordination amongst the various institutions responsible for environmental management, the lack 
of clarity of institutional mandates, weak institutional capacity and infrastructure to monitor/assess the 
various environmental issues in development projects; the non-integration of environment in the early 
stages of the development (and project) planning process; and not using the  Strategic Environmental 
Assessment (SEA) findings nor incorporating them  into the overall development planning process were 
highlighted as key issues. 

16. 
Other issues that were highlighted included the lack of conservation and management of Marine 
Protected Areas and Coastal Ecosystems (includes coastal and other sanctuaries), biodiversity issues such 
as Human-wildlife conflicts (elephants/monkeys/wild boar) in both rural and urban areas; threats to 
isolated natural landscapes through the promotion of unregulated “ecotourism”; the disruption of river 
ecosystems through various human activities; and the lack of consideration of ecosystem services during 
land allocation for development projects. 
17. 
The development of strategies, policies and actions that place an economic value on ecosystem 
services and promoting business opportunities through ecosystem conservation and management, 
restoration of degraded ecosystems, strengthening of environmental and sectoral agencies responsible for 
mainstreaming environmental and natural resource management in the development planning process, 
ensuring that the protection/conservation of environment is integrated into the school curricular, the 
adoption of  a holistic approach to growth by avoiding isolated development planning, ensuring the 
integration of environmental considerations into every aspect of the development activity, and the active 
participation of beneficiaries in the planning were some of the options listed that would enable Sri Lanka 
to simultaneously harness the twin benefits of growth and environmental sustainability.  

18. 
In addition to providing assistance with the above the World Bank was also requested to 
undertake studies to value environmental services to assess the conservation values of the environment, 
undertake economic, social, and livelihood related impact projections of the loss of these resources, and 
ensuring that World Bank projects shift from merely ensuring environmental safeguard compliance to a 
more holistic integration and main streaming of environment by integrating safeguards for sustainability 
into the development activities and projects.

Consultation with the Private sector 

19. 
A consultation with key members from the private sector and World Bank Group Staff was held 
on the 17th of January 2012 at the Cinnamon Lakeside Colombo. 

20. 
A principal concern voiced by the participants was that the Government was sending out mixed 
signals. This lack of clarity and consistency was exacerbated by uncoordinated ministries in the country. 
Insufficient communication between the private sector and the Government and also between the public 
sector hierarchy and the lower levels and provinces also compounded the problem. Participants went on to 
explain that even some of the positive policy measures taken at the Central government level do not get 
effectively implemented at the lower levels or at the provincial level owing to this problem. 

21. 
The participants described how the availability of land remained a major constraint. With the 
government owning large tracts of land, obtaining land for commercial purposes remained difficult.  
Increased transparency in the process, a one stop shop in most of the industries for investment 
information and approvals, an education system geared towards producing a skilled labor force, and 
improved public and corporate sector governance were cited as key policies that would boost investor 
confidence. 

22. 
Regular dialogue between the government and the private sector would increase the trust between 
the two parties and would lower confusion as in the case of Expropriation Bill, Pensions, and Private 
University Bill. The World Bank Group was requested to play an enhanced role in facilitating dialogue 
between the private sector and the government. A detailed government vision and the provision of a clear 
and consistent operational framework for major sectors were important next steps that would allow the 
private sector to operate freely within those sectors and thereby rapidly develop. 

Consultation with Development Partners 

23. 
A consultation with the donor community active in Sri Lanka was held on the 18thth of January 
2012 at the World Bank Colombo Country office. 

24. 
The WBG was encouraged to look more specifically at the extent to which the distribution of 
income (or consumption expenditure) among Sri Lankan households has increased (as reflected in the 
increased Gini index) and to ensure that the new strategy towards better social inclusion.    

25. 
Development Partners also highlighted the need to continue supporting the most vulnerable in the 
country, including those who had suffered the direct brunt of the war. Internally Displaced Persons were 
listed as still requiring assistance towards their return (e.g. from India), their “resettlement “and their 
access to sustainable source of income and livelihood.  

26. 
Issues relating to internal and external Sri Lankan migrants, and the promotion of safe and fair 
labor mobility were also discussed by the participants. The WBG was encouraged to ensure equality and 
social protection in a dynamic way, and to also bolster basic social support to the poorest and the most 
vulnerable was stressed.   

27. 
The participants also suggested that the WBG work collaboratively and dynamically with other 
development partners, to maximize impact.  Recognizing that working jointly could exponentially 
increase complexity and bureaucracy, especially when using sector wide approaches (as the CPS 
proposes) coordination in such cases was likely to be time consuming. In order to overcome these issues 
it was felt that actively seeking collaboration and jointly agreeing on division of labor, which goes further 
than just information-sharing would be useful.  

103 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Consultation with Financial Sector 

28. 
A consultation with key members from the financial sector and World Bank Group staff was held 
on the 19th of January 2012 at the Cinnamon Lakeside Colombo. 

29. 
The participants explained that funding requirements for the Banking Sector are a cause for 
concern with banks experiencing difficulty in managing liquidity, with deposit growth not keeping pace 
with loan growth and with savings rates also being relatively low in Sri Lanka compared to rest of region. 
Long term funding options for banks also remain limited. Banks are often unable to access long term 
FCY funding as long term swaps are not available in the local market. 

30. 
Such liquidity issues may affect future credit growth. It was also felt that the capital markets was 
being under-utilized with a clear need emerging to develop the local bond market, explore options of dual 
currency listing in the CSE, remove ambiguity on capital gain taxes, proper development of the yield 
curve. Overall it was felt that the World Bank Group (WBG) can play a critical role of strengthening the 
governance structure and capital market products in Sri Lanka.  

31. 
Large shareholding by government entities in the financial sector was seen as sending mixed 
signals to the investors.  It was felt that long term banking reforms are required; especially to address 
need for industry consolidation. Further, reforms on corporate governance structure can strengthen the 
banking sector.  

32. 
It was felt the WBG can help the sector in designing products that package both the finance and 
the ‘know how’ for more productive use of the funding by the Micro and Small Enterprise segments. It 
was also felt that policy support is required for Banks to focus more in this segment. The participants felt 
that the high cost structure of banks makes them ineffective in bottom of pyramid financing. High 
documentation requirements under KYC were often a deterrent for small borrowers to open an account or 
take a loan from a bank. It was also felt that WBG can assist the sector by funding a study to formulate a 
comprehensive policy on mobile banking operations.  

33. 
Citing human resources as a key challenge, the NBFC players mentioned of lack of qualified 
entry level staff for their regional expansion. The participants requested WBG to look into strengthening 
existing training institutes in the country to be able to support the sector better.  

34. 
Participants felt that the perception of Sri Lanka can be improved in the eyes of the international 
community/international investors, by projecting the post war positive developments in the country. The 
participants in the discussion felt that consolidation was the way forward in the financial sector, with the 
development strategy of the sector having a four pronged focus on capital markets, private equity, 
banking and mobile banking.  

Consultation with Parliamentarians  

35. 
A consultation with key members from the government and the opposition was held on the 20th of 
January 2012 at the Parliamentary complex. 

36. 
The participants were keen to understand what the transition from a lower income country to a 
middle income country entailed specifically in terms of different funding options available through the 
IBRD lending window and the current blend status of funding.  

104 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
37. 
The opposition noted that the main reason the private sector was not investing further was 
because there was concerns raised on the decision making process involved in passing legislature  such as 
the Revival of Under-Performing Enterprises and Under-Utilized Assets Act and the alienation of land. 
There was also concerns raised on the consistency and clarity of the policy of the government, which was 
cited as the principle deterrent to potential investors. The members from government responded that most 
of the companies coming under the Revival of Under-Performing Enterprises and Under-Utilized Assets 
Act were loss making institutions that were a drain on the national economy. 

38. 
Issues concerning the sovereign guarantees the government could provide for FDI's was also 
discussed. It was noted that the while the government could facilitate such investments it would face 
difficulties in guaranteeing.  

39. 
There was also discussion on issues concerning the manner in which agricultural productivity 
could be raised in the country. Solid waste management was described as a priority area where assistance 
is required. Issues concerning the decentralization of solid waste management to municipal authorities, 
and the lack of coordination with the central authority were highlighted. 

40. 
Issues relating to micro finance including the role of the IFC in facilitating increased access to 
micro finance and the possibility of increased usage of mobile phones to facilitate such transactions were 
also discussed.  

41. 
The need for greater engagement with parliamentarians in the future and the enhanced role of the 
World Bank Group as a key knowledge provider was described as key priority areas for future 
engagement. Suggestions were made for the World Bank to organize similar dialogues so as to present 
recent findings and other information directly with parliamentarians. The importance of continued World 
Bank support for education and skills, labor markets, health, and malnutrition was also highlighted. 

Transport sector Consultation  

42. 
A consultation on the issues facing the transport sector was held on the 23rd of January 2012 at 
the Cinnamon Grand Hotel.  The participants included representatives from the Ministries of Finance 
(National Planning Department & Department of Public Finance) and Transport, representatives from the 
National Physical Planning Department, National Transport Commission, Civil Aviation Authority, Sri 
Lanka Railways, Sri Lanka Transport Board, Road Development Authority, Sri Lanka Ports Authority, 
Colombo Municipal Council, Private Omnibus Association, Ceylon Chamber of Commerce, Association 
of Container Transporters, ADB, JICA, members of the Private sector, and World Bank Group staff.  

43. 
The major issue facing the sector was recognized as “rapid motorization”  whilst outdated 
transport networks, inadequate institutional capacity, inadequate maintenance, land acquisition, safety, 
inadequate land use planning, funding constraints, inadequate regulation in the bus sector and inadequate 
administrative structure for central Government coordination were recognized as the issues facing the 
transport sector. 

44. 
There was unanimous agreement that increasing the share of public transport was paramount with 
a paradigm shift in attention for public transport required for the resolution of these issues. There was 
agreement that improving the quality of public transport (both Bus and Rail) as well as a new mode of 
transport was required and demand management measures such as rationing the number of vehicles and 
vehicle use management was required through appropriate policy measures to address the issue of 
motorization. The participants were also in agreement that other capacity improvement measures on the 
road sector is required as a priority as opposed to the acquisition of land for capacity increases in the 
metro areas. 

105 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
45. With regard to freight transport, there was agreement that internal Container Depots and logistics 
centres were required although there was no clear agreement on shifting goods transportation from road to 
rail. It was agreed that the development of domestic airports should take account of proposed expressways 
as they would compete with each other. 

46. 
Due to the location of the new port and airport, Hambanthota was identified as having significant 
potential for development and connectivity to and from Hambanthota was considered a priority in order to 
make such economic model work. 

SME consultations  

Eastern Province 

47. 
A consultation with key members from the business chambers of the Ampara, Moneragala and 
Batticoloa districts and World Bank Group Staff was held on the 24th of January 2012 at the Monty hotel 
in Ampara. 

48. 
The principle constraints to the development of the districts were described as being the lack of 
access to finance, the lack of a viable market for their products, and the lack of information and 
knowledge. With agriculture being the most important economic driver in the province, the very poor 
value addition that is observed along the agricultural value supply chain with no off-season strategy being 
implemented were described as being the key causes for low agricultural productivity. Infrastructure 
issues such as inadequate government emphasis on the rural road network, the lack of transport facilities 
after 5 pm , frequent power failures and  high electricity tariffs, were other  issues that were presenting 
problems for SME’s in the district. In the Batticaloa district in particular a key cause of unemployment 
was the lack of SME businesses / industries. Over a period of time the majority of the industries in the 
district were shut down due to the difficulties faced in accessing markets for their products. 

49. 
On potential next steps, the creation of master plan by government, (focusing on key aspects such 
as agriculture and tourism) for the districts, in consultation with all relevant stakeholders, and wide 
dissemination upon its completion was seen as an essential. The creation of an agricultural technical 
knowledge hub in the province and greater government support for the activities of the chamber to ensure 
its long term sustainability were seen as key measures that would result in enhanced benefits over time. 
The WBG was requested to provide support towards the development of the technical capacity, and 
Research and development initiatives of the private sector, with the IFC being listed as key partner that 
could contribute to the growth of the province. The provision of vocational training was described as a 
primary requirement, especially IT education with an increased emphasis on skilled labor such as masons, 
carpenters, plumbers and electricians with the WBG urged to assist in conducting a feasibility study to 
explore and identify feasible business opportunities in the district.  

Northern Province 

50. 
A consultation with key members from the business chambers of the Trincomalee, Anuradhapura 
and Jaffna and Mannar districts along with World Bank Group staff, was held on the 26th of January 2012 
at the Heritage hotel in Anuradhapura. 

51. 
Overall, businesses were described as being affected severely by war with no forum/dialogue yet 
established for business owners to discuss problems and come up with solutions together with the 
government and other stakeholders. Access to finance remains a key barrier with issues including - high 
interest rates, high tax rates, collateral on loans, and the lack of long term loans being listed as specific 

106 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
constraints. The lack of information on new technology, and resources available was a reason for limited 
capacity for the creation of goods for exports. The lack of skilled personnel with the required technical 
skills, marketing and management skills to increase productivity and the lack of opportunities specifically 
with regard to access to economic zones were also highlighted. SME's in province are finding it difficult 
to cope with the competition from well established companies based in the western province. Government 
policies, with regard to leasing or purchasing land are considered as an extremely cumbersome process. 
As a result the lack of land hinders investment opportunities. 

52. 
The shortage of SME's in the province was described as the key concern of the business 
chambers. With no impact assessment having been carried out thus far, the unavailability of data makes 
business decisions an even more complex process.  Cultural issues such as those that discourage women 
from participating in the tourism sector have resulted in increased gender income disparities.   

53. 
As plausible next steps, the promotion of joint ventures that utilize both human capital and other 
resources readily available in province, and greater emphasis on encouraging private sector activities in 
the post conflict set up was seen as key means of alleviating the issues faced by SME’s in the province. 
PPP's were seen as viable options for enhancing gains. The creation of knowledge banks, skills and 
capacity building, were areas listed for WBG engagement.  

Education sector Consultation 

54. 
An education sector dialogue was held on the 2nd of February, 2012 at the World Bank Colombo 
country office.  Participants included officials from TVEC, officials from the ministry of education, 
university professors, undergraduates, and private sector education service providers, representatives from 
UNICEF, representatives from YESL, representatives from LYON and a student representative from the 
Model United Nations. 

55. 
The participants felt that education and skills remain a key issue as critical skill gaps are 
hampering the performance of the economy, with continued World Bank to support being required to 
address this issue. It was felt that advocacy programs should be conducted with a need to consider market 
requirements of specific skills and then develop a pool of such skilled personnel. The skill development 
paths should be communicated to parents and families, with greater emphasis on attracting students for 
some of the skills related courses where challenges exist, (the examples cited were construction, 
carpentry). Professionalization of such skills was also important with career guidance especially before 
and after GCE O/L examination being cited as crucial. The participants felt that too much emphasis was 
being placed on the Grade V exam. 

56. 
Vocational skill development courses should be introduced within the school with the inferior 
social status of vocational training being addressed. It was felt that integrated policies are required to 
address the needs of students in addition to the introduction of technical streams. 

57. 
It was also felt that a review of vocational training is important, along with the content, quality 
and quantity of the entire education sector being evaluated. The service delivery system issues should be 
addressed, with accountability and monitoring being important to improve the overall efficiency. 
58. 
A competency based assessment was considered important, with teacher development also being 
cited as a critical area. The National Qualification Framework being developed under the World Bank 
Higher Education Project is very important. 

59. 
Early childhood education was another area where World Bank support was requested. Although 
a proliferation of Montessori’s, but a lack of teachers trained for this level. Maintenance of quality was 
cited as being of utmost importance. Although a policy was developed a long time ago but only some 

107 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
aspects of the policy have been implemented. Support from provincial councils to assist in the 
implementation of policies, activities was important. Advocacy programs were also cited as important. 

60. 
Research and development especially in terms of studies identifying skills mismatch was 
described as being important. Participants also felt that there was a need for tracer studies to be conducted 
along with research into evidence based management. 

Consultations with Youth 

61. 
Five consultations were conducted in Northern, Eastern, Western, Central and Southern Provinces 
with the participation of a group of 20 – 30 young men and women, representatives of organizations 
working on youth and gender in development and World Bank staff. With nearly 5 million of Sri Lanka’s 
population being below 30 years of age and with unemployment among educated youth being 
significantly higher than the overall unemployment rate, common grievances shared by youth in all 5 
consultations related to the lack of opportunities to develop knowledge and skills, a mismatch between 
employment requirements and skills development, unmet youth aspirations, parental attitudes and 
expectations, lack of career guidance,  a lack of trained and informed teachers at primary and secondary 
levels and lack of knowledge on developing entrepreneurial skills. The absence of a national policy on 
youth development was an overarching national level challenge for youth development. 

62. 
In the Northern Province during the consultation held on the 27th of January 2012, at the 
University of Jaffna, space and opportunities for open dialogue was identified as a strong need for youth 
to voice their opinion on development and related issues in the region. Issues brought out were related to 
the lack of a longer term citizen engaged approach to development, the need for a social and political 
solution to address grievances of the Tamil community, improve the quality of education, with a focus on  
higher education, an increase in violence against women, and a greater need for private sector investment.  
The need to increase entrepreneurial skills and financial management skills among youth in the region by 
creating opportunities to gain professional qualifications was discussed. Most of the manufacturing, 
agricultural and fisheries sectors in the area remain largely neglected due to the protracted conflict.  
Opportunities for rapid expansion in these areas are available but yet to be achieved in a consultative and 
citizen centered manner.  The requirement of addressing issues related to the political economy of 
development taking place in the region was also discussed. 

63. 
A consultation for youth form the Eastern province was held in the Batticaloa public library on 
the 7th of February 2012. The Lack of resources (financial and human), the need for increased private 
sector investments and the strong need to change people’s attitudes towards work ethic were the key 
issues highlighted. Most educated youth (at graduate level) were seen to be primarily focused on securing 
public sector jobs. The key reasons for this being assumptions of job security and stable pension schemes 
offered by the public sector, cultural impetus and lack of private sector involvement in the area.  Private 
sector job opportunities were considered remote and often unstable.  Internship facilities were only being 
provided by a few public sector organizations and most youth were unaware of such opportunities. The 
lack of internship opportunities were highlighted as key constraints in finding jobs. Current problems 
relating to the theory based rote learning methodology of education and the skills mismatch between 
graduate skills and what was demanded by potential employers was also highlighted.  

64. 
Issues relating to the education sector in Sri Lanka were identified by participants from the 
Western Province as the key drawback that was preventing youth from actively accelerating the countries 
development. This consultation was held on the 13th of February, at the World Bank Colombo Country 
Office. A loosely based definition of entrepreneurship, the failure to identify that most youth did not have  
the drive and determination required ,  were often risk averse, and did not possess  the required  skill set, 
was seen as important issues that had to be addressed  prior to the national promotion of entrepreneurship 

108 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
culture. An increased emphasis on standards through rankings system especially for the faculties and 
individual departments was seen as key means of raising overall standards in state run universities. 
Recommendations made at this consultation included the need to collaborate effectively, share knowledge 
and information related to youth development efficiently, to provide opportunities and space for youth to 
voice their concerns in a non-threatening and non-patronizing environment. 

65. 
During the consultation held on the 17th of February 2012 at the Peradeniya University, the 
participants form the central province described job matching as a key issue, with the aspirations of 
undergraduates being much higher than what the job market in the country has to offer. Youth continued 
to demand public sector employment in search of job permanency and pension schemes.  Private sector 
jobs were seen to be difficult to obtain as there was a significant skills mismatch and also lack of private 
sector opportunities in the central province. Issues relating to state run tertiary education such as the lack 
of practical training and insufficient emphasis on soft skill development and relevant career guidance was 
highlighted. There was also discussion on the lack of internship opportunities and overall job 
opportunities with the private sector in the central province. The western province remained the area of 
choice for the securing of good jobs. Solutions to these issues included increase opportunities for 
knowledge sharing and platforms for youth to highlight their issues. Even though the central province had 
an ideal climate and the resources for agricultural expansion youth were not keen to seek opportunities in 
agricultural activities owing to social stereotypes associated with farming and agriculture. A lack of 
knowledge on the potential for increased agricultural productivity and the returns that could be obtained 
was acknowledged by the participants. 

66. 
In the southern province recommendations from participants included the need for private sector 
investment mainly in education and related fields, the need to coordinate donor support and efforts giving 
priority to the country’s vision and development challenges and increased linkages with stakeholders of 
development.  The discussion also revealed that no forum existed in the southern province for youth to 
discuss provincial issues and have a greater impact on the development of the province.  Issues such as 
the culture of alcoholism among the fishing community that resulted in the perpetuation of alcoholism 
amongst successive generations of youth in the fishing community were also discussed. This consultation 
was held on the 22nd of February at the Solis hall in Matara. 

Consultations with media 

67. 
A consultation with media personnel representing print, electronic, television and radio was held 
on the 28th of February 2012 at the DFCC Bank auditorium.  

68. 
A principal issue discussed was the role an enhanced adherence to the rule of law and democratic 
principles would play in the development of the country. Media freedom remained a key cause for 
concern along with access to information. The participants also highlighted the need for a clear and 
descriptive strategy for the country for the next 10 -20 years that will provide all stakeholders with clarity 
and consistency on the growth trajectory of the country. 

69. 
Issues concerning health (focusing on the issue of malnutrition and its link to poverty/behavior 
change) was also discussed by participants with a possible role the media could play in spreading 
important messages to educate the public on proper nutrition. 

70. 
Problems relating to the education sector were also discussed. The school to university and then 
to work transition was seen as a key stumbling block with a clear need to improve the quality of 
education. With youth unemployment being a cause for concern in the country, participants felt that 
politicians could play a key role in dissuading youth from solely seeking public sector jobs.  

109 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
71. 
The participants recommended that as the media was largely unaware of the WB Access to 
Information policy the World Bank must take pro-active measures to generate awareness on the policy 
and work with media to make this information accessible in formats that would enhance public 
consumption and dialogue. 

Consultations with General Public 

72. 
A consultation with members of the Sri Lankan general public, who had registered for 
participation through an online application process, was held on the 29th of February 2012 at the World 
Bank Colombo country office.  

73. 
A significant portion of the discussion centered on the education sector with participants 
describing it as the crucial sector that must be reformed if the country was to reach its goals. Some 
participants stated that state run universities in the country must be transformed from the traditional silo 
based systems to those that incorporate a multi or intra disciplinary approach. It was also stated that 
undergraduates in particular were highly risk averse and this lead to an increased demand for public sector 
jobs over private and entrepreneurial professions. Internship opportunities form the 1st year onwards was 
described as being important in this regard as it would allow undergraduates to obtain jobs more easily 
and also avail them of job market realities for the outset. 

74. 
On entrepreneurship development, the participants agreed that there was a need to increase 
technological entrepreneurship, set up innovation parks and ensure that social benefits from such schemes 
are widely distributed. A key factor that would influence the development of an entrepreneurial culture 
was described as attitudinal change. 

75. 
The participants also felt that the government should not get involved in sectors where the private 
sector was already involved in as at time they were unable to compete.  Road safety and the increasing 
number of roads traffic accidents was also highlighted.  

76. 
Some participants also felt that corruption was another aspect that needs to be addressed by the 
country’s development framework. They also called for the strengthening of public accountability 
mechanisms such as the COPE and COPA parliamentary committees by enhancing their capacity to 
implement the recommendations suggested in their reports. Participants also stated that governance and 
the adherence to the rule of law would be enhanced if forums to voice concerns were made more freely 
available. Accountability and transparency to be included in curriculum. 

77. 
The needs of the vulnerable population (especially IDP’s), was also discussed with the World 
Bank being requested to provide increased grant facilities in this regard. A further recommendation was in 
relation to greater Civil Society participation and donor coordination. CSO engagement in monitoring 
evaluation and social accountability measures was discussed, with participants describing a need for a 
development monitoring mechanism.

Annex 17:  Client Survey and Communications 

Communications and Outreach Brief 

Introduction 

1. 
This brief outlines the World Bank’s approach to communications and outreach targeting its 
clients in government, private sector and Civil Society groups including media, academia and 
parliamentarians. This brief also outlines some key findings of the client surveys, the long term goals of 
communications and outreach strategy in support of the broader goals of the CPS and the medium term 
objectives that the External Affairs unit of the World Bank will undertake.  

2. 
There are two objectives for the strategy: (a) to disseminate our global and local knowledge 
which would be of much use to the country; and (b) to strengthen the World Bank-Government-Public 
policy dialogue. Through this process the World Bank team envisages to play a major supporting role in 
achieving country's ambitious development targets over the medium term. Over the years the World Bank 
has gathered a considerable wealth of global knowledge and expertise through its extensive operations in 
over 150 countries. Increasingly, client countries are seeking this global expertise with the view of 
applying similar approaches to their own challenges and issues – albeit with some adjustment for the 
domestic context. As such, the World Bank now promotes sharing of this global expertise through a 
multitude of means including the highly successful South-South exchanges. At the same time, the country 
specialist knowledge as well global interlinks allows the World Bank to position itself as a vital partner in 
the policy dialogue process. 

3. 
To support the World Bank and its client the Government of Sri Lanka as well as the public 
groups that are both the clients of the Government of Sri Lanka and beneficiaries and contributors of 
World Bank support to Sri Lanka. 

 World Bank Clients 

4. 
The World Bank is owned by the people in countries in which it operates or the tax payers. Hence 
the people of Sri Lanka are a significant part of the clientele of the World Bank. Representing the people 
of the country, the elected Government becomes the main interlocutor or the primary client of the World 
Bank.

Key and noteworthy findings of the Client Survey 

5. 
To check the pulse of World Bank clients in Sri Lanka, to seek recommendations to be 
incorporated into the CPS and to provide as a baseline for communications and outreach to clients, the 

111 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
External Affairs unit of the World Bank facilitated a client survey.  This survey was administered using 
both quantitative and qualitative survey methods.  In addition, eighteen different consultations were 
conducted island wide to gather insights that would inform the future engagement needs of the World 
Bank. An island wide consultation was also completed to triangulate the findings. This was done in the 
form of focused group discussions capturing a sample of young men and women below 35 years of age 
and a selected number of representatives from government, private sector and civil society106. 

6. 
The main purpose of the client survey was for the 
World Bank to gain understanding of how its stakeholders 
perceive the World Bank and its operations in Sri Lanka. For 
the purpose of this brief, the focus will remain in the client 
survey 
findings 
that 
are 
related 
to World Bank 
communications and outreach. 

7. 
Respondents 
from 
the media and PIUs/PMUs 
indicated the highest levels of familiarity with the World Bank 
whereas respondents from NGOs, other organizations, and the 
office of a Parliamentarian had significantly lower levels of 
familiarity. Respondents from the Western Province indicated 
significantly higher levels of familiarity with the World Bank 
compared to respondents from other areas. 

8. 
The survey findings demonstrate the widely held view 
that growth and government effectiveness/governance are the 
top development priorities in Sri Lanka. The top weakness of 
the World Bank is identified in the survey as ‘inadequate 
alignment with country priorities’ in Sri Lanka. The survey 
also identified the lack of awareness and proper consultations 
at all levels and groups as a contributor to this perceived 
weakness. 

9. 
Respondents report the greatest level of satisfaction 
with sector wide approaches and results based lending and 
investment lending in Sri Lanka. 

Specific Areas of Effectiveness  

“Helping to bring about economic growth”; 

“Encouraging greater transparency in 
governance”; 

“Helping to strengthen the regulatory 
framework”; 

“Helping to strengthen the judicial system”; 

“Helping to strengthen the public sector”; 

“Helping to strengthen the education sector”; 

“Helping to strengthen the health sector”; 

“Safeguarding against corruption in projects/ 
programs that it funds with its procurement 
rules”; 

“Helping to strengthen agricultural 
development”;  

“Helping to reduce corruption in the country 
with its advice and support”; and 

10. 
A nearly equal number of respondents believe that the 
World Bank can increase its value in the future in Sri Lanka if 
it offers more tailored services for a Middle Income Country, 
reduces the complexity of its financing, improves the quality of 
its expertise’s as related to Sri Lanka, and helps to build institutional greater capacity.  

“Helping Sri Lanka adapt to/avert risk of climate 
change”. 

11. 
The respondents believe that the primary obstacle to World Bank assisted reform efforts in Sri 
Lanka is that they do not  take into account adequate consideration of the country’s challenges.  This 
obstacle to reform succeeding is followed by political pressures and an inadequate level of citizen/civil 
society participation.  The World Bank’s new focus on civil society is particularly relevant now in Sri 
Lanka in light of these survey findings.   

Communication and outreach  

106 Civil Society includes Academia, NGOs, CBOs etc.

12. 
Two-thirds of all respondents indicated that they got most of their information about economic 
and social development issues in Sri Lanka from local newspapers. The Internet was also a popular 
information source. A large number of the respondents have visited the World Bank website and prefer to 
get updates through web sources. (This includes respondents from outside the Western Province). 
Nevertheless there is a significant number of respondents without any knowledge or awareness of the 
World Bank Access to Information policy and how to access information from online sources.  

13. 
Therefore, there is a need to position the Goal: World Bank to be perceived as an effective 
Development Partner, committed to partnering the GOSL and its people fairly, transparently and 
impartially. 

To achieve this goal, the following three communication objectives are proposed: Objectives:  

1. Communicate for results 
2. Communicate for transparency 
3. Communicate for social accountability 

14. 
Communicate for results. Development communications play a crucial role in the success or 
failure of a development project or operation. The need to share global knowledge and expertise has been 
identified as a very important expectation from the people of Sri Lanka. As such, there will be a conscious 
effort to plan and implement a comprehensive knowledge and information dissemination strategy that 
would help build capacity of those who come into constant contact with the development agenda planned 
for Sri Lanka. This strategy would help stakeholders institutionalize development knowledge and 
information in daily operations. It would also benefit development stakeholders in applying knowledge 
for change and development by improving their capacities to engage in evidence based policy dialogue, 
which is much needed to achieve the ambitious development goals of Sri Lanka. Targeted and systematic 
stakeholder consultations, monitoring the socio-political and economic climate through media and other 
information sources, coordination with development partners and taking proactive measures to mitigate 
risks can support a development operation reap maximum results.  

15. 
The World Bank External Affairs unit in collaboration with other sectors will work closely to 
document achieves project results as well as to communicate effective practices. This would also help the 
World Bank to align its support to country priorities as well as transfer greater ownership of Sri Lanka’s 
development to the elected Government and its people. 

16. 
Communicate for transparency. The client survey finds that there is a significant lack of 
awareness of the World Bank policy on Access to Information. With this policy, the World Bank now 
makes all its information other than a few exceptions available for public access. In the short term, 
strategies will be developed to promote awareness of the policy and what it means in terms of achieving 
development effectiveness. Given that most of World Bank clients access information through local 
newspapers, media capacity will be built to access information and use the information for public 
consumption. In the longer term, World Bank will also engage with public and private sectors as well as 
NGOs to work towards policies that promote greater transparency of their work. South-south knowledge 
exchanges and technical expertise are available through World Bank resources.  

17. 
Communicate for social accountability.  The client survey also identified the need to actively 
engage citizens and Civil Society groups in collaboration with the client Government, specifically at the 
local government levels. Such engagements could also help the client government to monitor its 
development effectiveness through third party monitoring mechanisms and through initiatives to promote 
media and citizens awareness. of budgeting and budget transparency. The CPS consultations also initiated 
an engagement with parliamentarians. A strategy to engage parliamentarians to adopt social 
accountability tools in their work is another area to be developed. 

113 

 
 
 
 
 
  
18. 
Following up on findings of the client survey, more World Bank staff will engage in 
communications and outreach in a systematic manner as facilitated by the World Bank External Affairs 
unit.

Annex 18: Gender Issues in Sri Lanka 

Gender and Poverty in Sri Lanka  

1.1 
Sri Lanka is a lower-middle income country with a per capita income of approximately US$ 
2,400 and a population of around 20 million people. Basic human development levels are high, with the 
country performing well across a number of socio-economic indicators, including gender indicators. The 
country has been ranked in the Global Gender Gap Index 16th out of 134 developing and developed 
countries in terms of closing gender gaps in economic participation and opportunity, educational 
attainment, health and survival and political empowerment.107 Gender gaps in education and health 
indicators tend to be low, particularly when compared with other countries in the South Asia region; 
however, women persistently lag men in terms of economic participation: female labor force participation 
rates remain low, and unemployment rates are double those of men (World Bank 2011a). Women are also 
segregated into lower paying, low-skilled employment in both the formal and informal sectors, and into 
domestic service overseas (ibid). Sri Lanka’s performance on the UN Gender Inequality Index (see Figure 
1) is second only to the Maldives in South Asia (ranked 72 among 169 countries, compared to the 
Maldives 59th place ranking)108, and is rapidly approaching the rank of such upper middle income 
countries as Malaysia (ranked 55th).109

In 
terms 
of 
social 
indicators, the country performs at 
the 
level of middle 
income 
countries (see Table 1). Literacy at 
91 percent is near universal and 
basic 
indicators of health are 
uniformly high across 
income 
groups, with 99 percent of births 
attended by skilled health staff 
(World Bank 2011a; World Bank 
2007). The total fertility rate has 
been dropping from 2.9 births per 
woman in 1980-85 to 2.3 births per 
woman in 1990-95 and 2002-08 
(World Bank 2011a). 
 MDG 
timelines for universal primary 
school enrollment, gender parity in 
primary and secondary school 
enrollment, 
and 
universal 
provision of reproductive health services are on track. Sri Lanka has met the MDG numerical goals 
relating to universal primary school enrollment and completion, reaching near universal enrollment (96 
percent) and gender parity in primary and secondary enrollments since the early 1990s (World Bank 
2007), though quality questions remain (World Bank 2005a). Its performance on infant and under-5

108 The Gender Inequality Index is a composite measure of reproductive health (maternal mortality ratio and adolescent fertility 
rate); women’s empowerment (share of parliamentary seats held by women; and female secondary and tertiary educational 
attainment rates); and labor (share of women in the labor force) (UN 2008).  
109 On the OECD’s Social Institutions and Gender Index which looks at family law, civil liberties, physical integrity (including 
violence against women), son preference, and ownership rights, Sri Lanka scores highest among all South Asian countries (score 
0.059 versus average regional score of 0.335), due especially to lack of son preference in the country. (See OECD SIGI Index at 
http://my.genderindex.org).

mortality rates is also very strong, and four times better than what might be expected for a country of its 
income level. Sri Lanka should reach the goal by 2015 of 6.3 deaths per 1000 live births (ibid).110

1.3 
The Government’s 10-year Development Framework entitled the Mahinda Chintana: Towards a 
New Sri Lanka, sets out three pillars: i. equitable development through accelerated rural development; ii. 
accelerated growth through increased infrastructure investment; iii. strengthening of public service 
delivery (World Bank 2011a).111  A key challenge for the Government is to successfully manage 
development and poverty reduction efforts in a manner that is inclusive, pro-poor and gender-responsive. 
Improved performance on MDG 3 (Gender equality) will be a challenge given the gender gaps that 
remain in most aspects of economic and political empowerment, especially in areas such as representation 
in decision-making and public life. Persistent poor performance on indicators such as women’s labor 
force participation outside of agriculture, and poor nutritional outcomes across income quintiles, point to 
challenges that require a multi-pronged gender-sensitive approach. This is particularly pressing given the 
government’s goals of reducing rural employment from two-thirds to a half, and increasing the urban 
population from a quarter to a third. Migration policy also seeks to double the proportion of remittances 
earned on the basis of skills, with important implications for female overseas workers.  Women’s 
participation in the garment sector, in particular, remains significant.  

1.4 
Remittances by female overseas workers working in domestic service and the health sector 
contribute greatly to national and household incomes. Remittances are the second largest earner of foreign 
exchange in Sri Lanka (Abayasekera 2010) and women are significant participants in the overseas Sri 
Lankan labor force--53 percent of the total in 2003 (World Bank 2007). Abroad they work largely as 
domestic staff in households in the Middle East (90 percent). Many of these women come from the 
generally poor estate sector; however, individual households sending women to work abroad tend to have 
more assets than other non-migrant sending households (ibid). Government policy toward female 
overseas workers is mixed. The Government of Sri Lanka (GoSL) supports migration because of 
remittance earnings, yet it seeks to bar married women with young children from such work since work 
conditions abroad can be abusive. Indeed, the government has done little to work with host countries to 
reduce these abuses endured by both female and male migrant workers from Sri Lanka (Gunatilaka et al  
2010; ADB 2008) .   

110 Nonetheless, even infant mortality rates (IMR) vary widely by region: e.g., in 1996, the district with the highest IMR rate in 
the country (i.e., Anuradhapura) had a rate almost 20 times that of the district with lowest (that is, Trincomalee) (World Bank 
2005). Progress since then has been similarly varied spatially.     
111 Sri Lanka’s strategy for attaining high-middle income status is centered around five key hubs for growth, viz: i. knowledge-
based industries and services; ii. ports and shipping; iii. aviation; iv. commercial hub; and v. energy  (World Bank 2011b).

Persistent Gender Inequities in Sri Lanka: Statistical Summary   

2.1 
Despite favorable composite scores on gender, Sri Lanka performs less well than expected for its 
GNI per capita level in two key areas:  women’s labor force participation, and nutritional status of women 
and children.

2.2 
Women’s Labor Force Participation:  Women’s labor force participation in Sri Lanka is just 37 
percent, below that of Nepal (NPL); middle-income countries (MIC); Sub-Saharan Africa (SSF); 
Malaysia (MYS), which has gender equality outcomes in other areas that are similar to Sri Lanka’s; and 
not much higher than in India or Afghanistan (Figure 2). The government is committed to improving this 
performance, particularly as the country transitions further into the services and industry sectors. 
However, a historical look at Sri Lanka and other comparator countries shows remarkable persistence in 
women’s labor force participation in the last three decades, with Sri Lanka actually demonstrating a slight 
decline in women’s participation rates as the economy develops (Figure 3).  These figures mask 
differences in rates in rural and urban areas.  Rural women participate in the labor force slightly more 
than do urban women, and this disparity persists over time (Figure 4). Women’s labor force participation 
for female youth aged 15-29 from 1992-2006 was just 38 percent compared to their male counterparts’ 
participation at 66 percent, though women’s participation was increasing by 3.4 percent per year 
compared to the male increase of 1.8 percent per year  (Arunatilake and Jayawardena 2010).  Still, from 
1992 to 2006, women’s labor force participation (ages 15 and over) increased from 36 percent to 39 
percent, while men’s increased from 75 percent to 77 percent of the respective population (ibid, based on 
DCS data). The overall unemployment rate for females was double that of men (i.e., 9.7 percent 
compared to 4.7 percent) (ibid).  Unemployment for women is higher than for men in all sectors, but 
highest in the rural sector, followed closely by urban unemployment (Figure 5).

2.3 
Nutrition of Women and Children: Consumption and income poverty persist in Sri Lanka, as does 
malnutrition, especially among the poor. While the prevalence of malnutrition is not as high as in other 
South Asian countries and even many middle income countries (Figure 6), overall child malnutrition rates 
in 2002-08 were 21 percent (World Bank 2011a). Among children under age five, 18 percent are stunted, 
22 percent are underweight, and 15 percent are wasted (UNICEF 2009). These malnutrition levels are 
higher than what is expected for countries at similar GDP per capita levels. National aggregates, 
moreover, mask widening disparities between different groups in the population.  While child 
malnutrition is present across all income quintiles, it declines as income levels rise. In the estate sector, 
where child malnutrition rates are among the highest in the world, stunting (height for age) affects more 
than 40 percent of children. A Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) indicator for the period FY09-12 was 
to reduce the share of underweight children under age 5 in estate areas from 44.1 percent in 2000 to 34.9 
percent in 2011-12; however, this indicator has since been dropped (World Bank 2011a).
