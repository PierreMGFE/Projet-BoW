EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

1. 
Jordan is sensitive to the economic and political volatility of the region.  The political 
upheaval that swept the Arab region this year has had a significant impact on Jordan, taking the form of 
economic shocks as well as demands for stronger citizen voice, greater accountability and improvements 
in living conditions.  Lower foreign direct investment (FDI), remittances and tourist revenues resulting 
from the regional turmoil and interruptions in the gas supply from Egypt have coincided with higher 
international grain and energy prices.  At the same time, the Government has faced public protests 
demanding reforms to the constitution and to the electoral system.  The Government has responded by 
adopting constitutional reforms and creating an enabling environment for an effective political party 
democratic system.   

2. 
Jordan’s vision is to pursue a knowledge-based economy, leveraging the country’s strong 
human capital base and creating jobs.  The Government’s Executive Development Program (EDP) for 
2011-13 underscores the importance of exports to Jordan’s economic future and the role of education and 
skills development in tailoring the country’s human capital to the needs of the private sector.  Along these 
lines, the EDP emphasizes the need for an improved enabling environment for business and investment 
with the objective of enhancing the competitiveness of the economy.  In addition, increased transparency 
and accountability are highlighted as necessary conditions to bring Jordan to the next level of economic 
and social development.  In its presentation to the Deauville Partnership, Government drew heavily on the 
EDP as its medium-term socio-economic development plan and noted that events in the region have 
underscored the need to accelerate the political reform agenda and to ensure that the dividends of 
economic reforms are shared across the country.  In addition to improved governance, job creation and 
private sector development are primary goals, along with addressing challenges in the energy and water 
sectors. 

3. 
In the short to medium-term, the Government’s key challenge, in addition to implementing 
the political reform agenda, is to create fiscal space in order to protect against external shocks and 
to safeguard growth-enhancing capital spending while also enhancing the efficiency and 
effectiveness of social protection systems. The substantial public deficit—caused largely by 
expansionary spending on recurrent budget items during the 2000-10 period and more recently by social 
expenditures in 2011 in response to the recent shocks—leaves limited fiscal space to make capital 
investments for growth.  As a small, open economy, Jordan will continue to be vulnerable to external 
shocks because of the significant role played by FDI and remittances in growth and because of the 
reliance on foreign aid to help finance the fiscal deficit.  FDI and remittances tend to track together with 
the price of oil and have recently been affected by the regional turmoil , and foreign grants are 
unpredictable.  

4. 
The Government took decisive measures to reduce the fiscal deficit in 2010 to 5.6 percent; 
however, an increase in expenditures in 2011, responding to unexpected exogenous factors has 
diverted Jordan from its fiscal consolidation path.  Despite significant progress in deficit reduction 
(from 8.9 in 2009 to 5.6 percent in 2010), social pressures resulting from the regional popular revolts 
prompted the Government in early 2011 to revise the budget, increasing civil service wages and 
introducing additional food and fuel subsidies.  Together these measures will cost 2.1 percent of gross 
domestic product (GDP), most of which is being financed by a decrease in capital expenditures .  
Additional social expenditures (amounting to 2.3 percent of GDP) were incurred after the budget was 
approved.  This package was fully covered by a $1 billion grant received from Saudi Arabia in the end of 
July 2011, and the projected fiscal deficit, including grants, remains close to the 2010 level, at 6.5 

i 

 
 
 
 
 
percent.  The public debt-to-GDP ratio surpassed the 60 percent debt ceiling in the autumn of 2011 
because of loan guarantees provided to the National Electricity Company as the latter had to switch to 4 
times more expensive fuel to generate electricity when the gas supply from Egypt was disrupted.   

5. 
In an effort to minimize the burden on the budget while at the same time facilitating 
growth-enhancing investments, Government is looking to leverage private capital for investment in 
key infrastructure. Government has renewed its emphasis on strengthening the framework for 
investment development and growth across regions (through new Investment Promotion and Economic 
Zone laws) and has developed legislation to facilitate Public Private Partnerships (PPPs).  Jordan will 
seek to become globally competitive and less vulnerable to changes in regional demand.  To help in this 
process it will need not only investments but policies and institutions that will further boost total factor 
productivity (TFP).  Jordan’s TFP growth was good during 2000-08, but pales when compared to that of 
countries like Malaysia or Chile.  This can improve with the continuation of educational reforms that 
close skills gaps and improve education quality and with the development of an innovation policy, 
increased focus on private sector competitiveness, and services to promote small and medium-sized 
enterprises (SMEs). 

6. 
Finally, in order for Jordan to be able to address the needs of its most vulnerable 
population, while also maintaining fiscal discipline and investing in longer term growth and job 
creation, efforts must be made to increase the efficiency of the social protection system.  In this 
regard, Government is exploring the potential for a more targeted subsidy system while at the same time 
examining ways to ensure that the benefits of economic development, including the creation of jobs, 
reach people in the less privileged areas of the country.  

7. 
The World Bank Group (WBG) and Jordan have built a strong and flexible partnership 
that has enabled frank and substantive discussion about the country’s development challenges as well as 
about the areas where the WBG can bring the most value to Jordan, especially in the context of other 
donor assistance and IFC’s mobilization of additional funding for the private sector .  As of November 30, 
2011, Jordan’s total active portfolio was valued at $279.1 million of which 87 percent ($243.5 million for 
seven investment lending projects) is financed by IBRD and 13 percent ($35.6 million for twelve projects, 
including one technical assistance project executed by the Bank) is financed by Bank-administered trust 
funds.  In addition, there are two guarantees valued at $60 million: (i) $45 million from IBRD for the 
Amman East Power Guarantee Project; and (ii) $15 million from the Carbon Fund for the Amman 
Landfill Gas Recovery Project.   IFC has scaled up its investment activities in Jordan considerably during 
the last few years; its portfolio has grown from $50 million at end-FY05 to about $524 million at end-
September 2011.  IFC has also mobilized around $310 million over the past three years and has 
undertaken extensive program of Advisory Services to support private sector development. 

8. 
Taking into consideration the challenges facing Jordan at this time, the World Bank 
Group’s Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for FY12-FY15 is designed to help lay the foundation 
for sustainable growth and job creation through a three-pronged approach:  
(i) Strengthen fiscal management and increase accountability.  The Bank will support efforts to improve 
public financial management, including increased efficiency of public expenditures and revenue 
generation, and will support the Government’s ambition to increase accountability.  Relevant instruments 
include the programmatic series of development policy loans that will support fiscal management, public 
sector spending efficiency, private sector-led growth and governance, including strengthening the Anti-
Corruption Commission.  Technical assistance (TA) on subsidy targeting, a fiscal consolidation study, 
and TA on governance reform will complement the Development Policy Loan (DPL) series.  WBG 
advisory services and interventions at sectoral levels will be guided by the need to strengthen 
transparency, accountability, and broader consultation with the private sector and civil society 
organizations. 

ii 

 
 
 
 
 
(ii) Strengthen the foundation for sustainable growth with a focus on competitiveness.  The Bank Group 
will support priority infrastructure, including by leveraging private sector investment, supporting 
improvements in the business environment, and supporting education and skills development.  Towards 
this end, the Bank Group stands ready to provide technical assistance, IFC advisory services, and 
investments to attract private sector participation in infrastructure funding and management.  Support for 
a better business environment will focus on removing obstacles to innovation and investment at the firm 
and sector levels; streamlining and reducing the procedures and cost required to create and operate 
businesses; and enhancing SMEs’ and microenterprises’ access to finance to boost private sec tor growth 
and competitiveness.  To develop skilled human resources, the Government has been investing in 
education quality with Bank support and has recognized the need for enhancements both on the 
vocational and higher education side and on the labor market side in order to create skills more in l ine 
with private sector demand.  The Bank will remain involved through its ongoing portfolio of projects and 
TA and will support a number of new regional education initiatives; IFC will facilitate improvements in 
the quality and relevance of post-secondary education and vocational training through its Education for 
Employment (e4e) initiative, where work in Jordan is currently more advanced than elsewhere in the 
region.  Pilot labor market programs will be evaluated and scaled up, targeting youth including women at 
the secondary and post-secondary levels. 

(iii) Enhance inclusiveness through social protection and local development.  Building on past support to 
the reform of Jordan’s safety net system, the Bank will continue assisting the Government in better 
targeting its social assistance and subsidies to the poor and vulnerable.  The Bank will also support 
Jordan’s Social Security Corporation in implementing the new Social Security Law.  The Bank Group 
will build on the ongoing Regional and Local Development Project to expand a performance-based block 
grant system that targets infrastructure interventions to municipalities and communities based on their 
needs and abilities.  The Bank Group will help strengthen the capacity of local communities and proposes 
to build local economic and social assets through community-based approaches in order to reduce poverty 
pockets and empower communities.  The community-based approaches could focus on overall social 
inclusion, particularly of youth and women.  

9. 
The strategy and the scope of WBG support reflect consultations with the Government and 
other stakeholders and are aligned with the priorities articulated in the Executive Development 
Program, specifically those focusing on fiscal consolidation, growth, job creation, private sector 
development, governance and social inclusion. The CPS also reflects the Bank and IFC’s regional 
framework and strategy for the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) Region which has evolved to 
respond to the events of the Arab Spring and focuses the WBG engagement on supply- and demand-side 
governance, economic and social inclusion, job creation and sustainable private sector-led growth.  The 
Bank Group will seek to optimize the various instruments available and will emphasize the provision of 
solid analytical work and selected advisory services and technical assistance; development policy loans 
and guarantees.  In addition, IFC’s lending, equity investments, mobilization, and guarantees (Risk-
sharing) and selected IBRD investment loans to will help leverage private sector investment in growth-
enhancing infrastructure.  The IBRD lending envelope will be $500-$650 million, depending on the 
sequencing and mix of instruments.  IFC’s current investment portfolio stands at $523 million and is 
expected to grow to approximately $750 million during this CPS period.  The program for FY12-15 is 
indicative and will be adapted to respond to country and private sector demands and to the WBG’s ability 
to service this demand in the context of its comparative advantages. 

10. 
Risks to the successful implementation of the Government’s agenda stem in part from the 
increasing social pressures in Jordan and the associated risks to the pursuit of economic reforms 
that are needed to stimulate long-term growth and job creation.  The pressure for populist policies 
and demands for subsidies and public sector employment could further strain the budget and squeeze out 
capital investment.  Relatedly, lack of consensus on the depth and relevance of political reforms could 

iii 

 
 
 
prolong the movement of protests and create uncertainty about Jordan’s stability with consequences on 
domestic and foreign direct investments and hence growth.  The Government will submit four draft laws 
to Parliament before end 2011, including laws that govern elections and the political party system and that 
establish an independent commission to oversee parliamentary polls.  Government made use to a large 
extent of recommendations submitted by the National Dialogue Committee, which comprises 
representatives of political parties and civil society organizations tasked with reaching a consensus over 
legislation governing political reforms.  As such, the Government is taking steps to address the mounting 
social pressures, but appropriate legislation to regulate the political party system and the election process 
will be needed to further mitigate this risk. 

11. 
In addition to the risks originating in the domestic political realm, there are risks that stem 
from the strong links Jordan’s economy has with the other countries in the region as well as with 
the global economy.  Over the past several months, popular uprisings in a number of Middle East and 
North African countries have shaken the political stability of the region as a whole and have increased the 
risk premium as perceived by investors.  Foreign Direct Investment, as well as tourism receipts, fell 
dramatically in 2011 by 32 percent and 16 percent respectively in the first half of the year, despite high oil 
prices.  Since February 2011, repeated disruptions in the Egypt gas pipeline, which supplies 70 percent of 
Jordan’s gas, have resulted in a four-fold increase in Jordan’s energy bill due to the need to substitute 
costly heavy fuel for gas.  If there is a prolonged transition period in surrounding countries, the risk of 
slower growth resulting from these factors will persist.  In addition, Jordan’s heavy reliance on imported 
energy and food (98 percent of the country’s energy and 90 percent of its food supply is imported) make 
it vulnerable to increases in international commodity prices.  As long as food and fuel prices continue to 
rise, this risk will also persist.  While in the past the adverse impact of high commodity prices on the 
current account deficit has been mitigated by cyclically higher FDI and sustained remittances from the 
Gulf, this has not been the case in 2011, and Jordan has had to rely heavily on foreign grants.  The 
reliability of foreign aid flows is affected by downturns in the global economy as well as by changes in 
geopolitics, and as such, dependence on this source of financing is inherently risky.  As discussed further 
in the CPS, Government will work to minimize Jordan’s vulnerability to external shocks and to lessen its 
reliance on foreign grants by building up fiscal space and by setting the stage for endogenous, private-
sector led growth.

I. COUNTRY CONTEXT 

1. 
Jordan is an upper middle-income country with a population of 6 million and a per-capita 
GNI of $4,390.  The population is around 80 percent urban and is one of the youngest among upper-
middle income countries, with 38 percent being under the age of 14.  The country is not rich in natural 
resources (potash and phosphate are its main export commodities).  Agricultural land is limited, and water 
is considerably scarce—indeed, Jordan ranks as the world’s fourth poorest country in this regard.  
Services account for more than 70 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) and more than 75 percent of 
jobs.  As one of the most open econonmies of the region, Jordan is well integrated with its neighbors 
through trade, remittances, foreign direct investment (FDI), and tourism and has especially strong links to 
the Arab Gulf economies.  Jordanian policymakers seek to use the demographic opportunity of a well 
educated, young population to build a dynamic, knowledge-based economy.  

2. 
Jordan is vulnerable to the economic and political/social volatility of the region.  The 
political upheaval that swept the Arab region this year has had a significant impact on Jordan, taking the 
form of economic shocks as well as demands for stronger citizen voice, greater accountability and 
improvements in living conditions.  Tourism receipts, FDI and, to some extent, remittances fell 
dramatically in the first half of 2011, while the import bill increased as a result of higher commodity 
prices.  In addition, numerous interruptions in the gas supply from Egypt have coincided with higher 
international grain and energy prices.  At the same time, Government has faced public protests demanding 
reforms to the constitution and to the electoral system.  The Government has responded to these demands 
by adopting constitutional reforms and creating an enabling environment for an effective political party 
democratic system.  In addition, Government has increased current expenditures—in the form of 
increased public sector wages and subsidies, especially in the energy sector.   Like other countries in the 
Region, Jordan will have to balance short-term needs, related to external shocks and current political 
demands, with the need for fiscal stability and capital investments, both of which are necessary 
ingredients for long-term, sustainable growth. 

A. 

Political and Social Context 

3. 
Since January 2011, Jordan has seen demonstrations with calls for political reforms, 
including fighting corruption and putting in place new election and political parties laws along with 
greater political and press freedom.  H.M. King Abdullah responded by ordering political reforms that 
address voice and participation and create an enabling environment for an effective two-three party 
system.  Towards this end, two committees were formed in February 2011:  (i) the Royal Committee for 
Constitutional Reforms which was charged with creating constitutional amendments to enhance the power 
of the Judiciary, the Parliament, and civil liberties, thereby improving the balance of power between the 
King, the Parliament and the citizens; (ii) the National Dialogue Committee which was tasked with 
preparing a new Municipal Law, a new Electoral Law and a new Political Parties Law.  These laws are 
expected to strengthen the legislative body and provide for greater Government accountability while 
paving the way for the formation of stronger political parties.  The Municipal law was approved on 
September 8, 2011 by parliament; the new Electoral law and Political Parties law are expected to be 
submitted to Parliament before the end of 2011.   Some Government actions to date, such as the 
strengthening of the anti-corruption commission, the first ever publication of the anti-corruption report, 
the limits imposed on the jurisdiction of the State Security Court, and the restriction on bypassing 
Parliament through the temporary laws mechanism reflect the commitment of policy makers to tackling 
these concerns.

4. 
While political and structural reforms have been contemplated for many years in Jordan, 
the degree to which they have been pursued has varied.  Among other factors, frequent cabinet 
changes and fragmented structures with overlapping mandates have affected the Government’s ability to 
implement reforms with consistency.  Beginning with the National Agenda in 2005 which contained 
initiatives to open up elections, prevent discrimination against women, and encourage freedom of the 
press, there have been attempts to build a strong multi-party political system and to develop a free, 
independent and professional media.  Galvanized by the most recent events in the Region, these ideas are 
being re-invigorated by H.M. King Abdullah II and a newly appointed Prime Minister, and they are 
beginning to bear fruit, especially with regard to modernizing the elections process. 

5. 
Jordan has achieved impressive progress in education, health, and technological readiness 
compared to other middle-income countries (MICs) and Middle East and North African (MENA) 
countries.  The maternal mortality rate stood at 59 per 100,000 live births in 2008, compared to 210 and 
80 in MICs and MENA countries respectively.  Similarly, the infant mortality rate is 18.4 per 1,000 live 
births compared to 38 and 25.6 in MICs and MENA countries.  Jordan’s educational record is impressive 
with a 100 percent primary school completion rate and a 111 percent ratio of female-to-male tertiary 
enrollment.  Mobile phone subscriptions per 100 people have risen to 101 in 2010 compared to 79 among 
MENA countries overall.  

6. 
Jordan is on track to reach most of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), yet 
regional disparities persist.  Though overall poverty incidence has been reduced from around 20 percent 
in the late 1990s to 13.3 percent in 2008, higher poverty incidence occurs in rural areas, especially in the 
Mafraq, Karak, and Tafileh governorates.1  Jordan’s primary and secondary enrollment, primary 
completion, illiteracy rates, and female enrollment have already reached their goals for 2015.  In terms of 
the MDG gender indicators, Jordan lags behind in female representation in parliament (despite efforts 
undertaken in this regard) and employment in nonagricultural sectors.  In addition, although Jordan has 
made major improvements on both indicators relating to access to an improved water source and 
sanitation services, targeted policy actions are required to achieve the environmental stability MDG by 
2015.  Water will continue to be a major challenge given the very limited water resources in the country .  
In addition, although Jordan has achieved major improvements on both indicators related to the percent of 
the population that has access to an improved water source and sanitation services, Jordan still requires 
decisive and targeted policy actions and political will to achieve the environmental stability MDG goal by 
2015.  Water will continue to be a major challenge given the very limited water resources in Jordan.    

7. 
Though Jordan invests heavily in human capital, it sees its best trained people migrate 
abroad while foreign laborers take many of the available jobs.  Commensurate with high growth in 
investments and GDP, job creation in Jordan has been strong.2  However, unemployment among nationals 
has remained high, at 12.5 to 14.5 percent over the last decade.  Part of the reason is the mismatch 
between labor supply and demand, and the high expectations of the unemployed—caused in part by the 
existence of high wage jobs in Gulf countries—and the low wages paid in Jordan.3  Unemployment is 
highest among young graduates, particularly among young women.  Although women are at least as 
educated as men, their participation in the labor force is among the lowest in the region, at around 15 
percent. 

1 It is important to note that although few of the residents of Amman are poor, there are more poor people in Amman than in 
other governorates due to the concentration of the country’s population in Amman. 
2 The Jordanian economy created between 24,000 and 44,000 additional jobs per year from 2000 to 2005, rising to 60,000 -70,000 
in 2008.

Economic Context 

8. 
Following almost a decade of strong macroeconomic performance, Jordan’s economy was 
knocked off course by the global crisis, and has struggled to regain its footing ever since.  Supported 
by a favorable external environment and capital inflows, growth averaged 6.5 percent in 2000-2009.  This 
dynamic was halted by the global crisis, which led to a sharp decline in growth in 2010 (down to 2.3 
percent). Initial efforts to get back on track were sidetracked as Government struggled to respond to 
public demands, leading to a widening public sector deficit, rising public debt and a further shift in 
spending priorities from investment to subsidies.  This is stifling private sector growth and, together with 
rising import prices, is putting pressure on external accounts.  A grant from Saudi Arabia helped ease the 
fiscal pressure in 2011, but Government now hopes that reforms on the political front will allow it to 
regain the initiative on the fiscal front, and steer the economy away from what could otherwise be a 
downward trajectory. 

The Period 2009-2010 

9. 
When growth slumped in 2009, the Government’s initial reaction was to pump the economy 
back to life through public investment (+ 50 percent in 2009). 4  But this attempt was quickly scaled 
back in 2010 in the face of disappointing revenue performance and dwindling foreign grants.  
Government shifted its efforts towards reviving private sector growth instead, with fiscal retrenchment 
and a shift in Government borrowing towards foreign sources, creating ample room for private sector 
credit.  By late 2010, promising signs were beginning to appear of a fledgling supply response to the 
easing of credit conditions, including in the real estate, financial, retail trade and construction sectors. 

10. 
Not surprisingly, the downturn significantly affected public finances.  Significant spending 
cuts helped narrow the fiscal deficit (excluding grants) by 3 percentage points of GDP in 2010, from 11 
percent of GDP in 2009.  Faced with an already deteriorating social climate, the Government chose to 
reduce capital spending significantly in 2010 (mainly delaying projects scheduled to be launched).  A 
drop in international prices nonetheless helped the Government to keep consumer subsidies at a low level. 
As foreign grants continued to disappoint, however, such fiscal retrenchment proved insufficient to arrest 
the rise of public debt.  The ratio of (net) public debt, which had reached a low at 57 percent of GDP in 
2009, crossed the 60 percent line in 2010.5 

11. 
On the external front, although FDI declined in 2009, it comfortably financed the current 
account deficit and allowed Jordan’s official foreign reserves to reach a record high by end -2009. 
The current account deficit stabilized at around 5 percent of GDP in 2010 and was easily financed by FDI 
and remittances.  As a result, external reserves reached $12.2 billion (about 7.6 months of imports) at the 
end of 2010. 

12. 
On the monetary policy side, the fiscal retrenchment allowed the Central Bank (CBJ) to 
shift to a more expansionary stance.  From November 2008 onwards, the CBJ has pursued a policy of 
monetary easing to stimulate the economy through cuts in the policy interest rate ,6 a reduction of reserve 

4 The Government officially revised its GDP figures in June 2011, raising the 2009 GDP and bringing down slightly the 2010 
GDP.  The statistics department indicated that they needed to update the numbers based on updated firm surveys and correct ed 
errors found in calculating net taxes. 
5 Jordan’s debt law stipulates that the public net debt to GDP should not pass 60 percent as a rule.  However, the general 
provisions of the law stipulate that the debt limit rule article would come into force only if specifically and separately ap proved 
by the Council of Ministers.  Such approval has never materialized.  So, de facto, the 60% debt limit is not binding legally. 
6 Policy interest rate dropped by 200 basis points (bpt) between August 2008 and January 2010 and by 50 bpt between February 
2010 and end-2010.

requirements,7 and a halt in the issuance of certificates of deposits.  As a result, lending to the private 
sector, which had been previously contracting, registered an 8 percent growth in 2010 (though remaining 
below pre–global crisis level).  

The Period January – August 2011 

13. 
Since the beginning of 2011, Jordan has faced a series of exogenous and endogenous shocks.  
First, the political revolutions sweeping the Arab World have significantly reduced short-term growth 
prospects for Jordan through sharp declines in FDI (-32 percent in the first semester of 2011), tourist 
revenues (-16 percent) and remittances (- 3.1 percent).  Instead of the gradual recovery hoped for, growth 
stood at about 2 percent in the first semester of 2011, leading to a shortfall in fiscal revenues estimated at 
1 percentage point of GDP.  Second, in a context of high international prices of oil and food commodities, 
the Egyptian gas pipeline, which supplies 70 percent of the energy needed to generate electricity, 
exploded nine  times since February, forcing Jordan to switch to more expensive heavy fuel and diesel to 
maintain electricity supply.  Finally, demonstrations demanding political reforms and improvements in 
social conditions erupted and challenged the Government to address a host of short-term demands from 
different segments of the population, chiefly political reforms, reduced corruption and social transfers 
from the state. 

14. 
The Government has initiated a number of political reforms while at the same time 
suspending the adjustment of domestic prices to global developments and introducing additional 
social spending.  A first package, equivalent to 2 percent of GDP, was included in the official 2011 
budget, and a second one, equivalent to 2.7 percent of GDP, was adopted in August 2011, as part of a 
supplemental budget.  This recent package includes higher fuel and grain subsidies ($400 million due to 
subsidies given to gasoline, octane 90 and kerosene users by temporarily suspending the application of the 
end-user oil price adjustment formula and $141 million due to the impact of higher fuel and grain prices 
on the wheat and cooking gas cylinder subsidies), a one-time cash transfer to public sector employees, the 
armed forces and the beneficiaries of the National Aid Fund on the occasion of the holy month of 
Ramadan ($112 million), additional investment in small-scale infrastructure projects in lagging regions in 
partnership with the private sector ($35 million) and the clearance of arrears to private contractors and for 
land acquisition ($141 million). 

15. 
 The Government successfully mobilized additional grants to cover these additional 
expenses, without swelling public borrowing requirement.  On July 28, 2011, a $1 billion (3.2 percent 
of GDP) grant from Saudi Arabia was announced.  This came in addition to the $400 million which was 
received in June and incorporated in the initial 2011 Budget.  As a result, the Government’s remaining 
gross financing requirement for 2011 was left more or less as envisaged in the initial 2011 budget, at 
around $2.5 billion.  While the deficit including grants increased only slightly in 2011 (from 5.6 percent 
to 6.3 percent), when grants are excluded, the deficit has risen substantially, from 7.7 percent to 12.2 
percent.  In addition, net public debt is expected to rise to 65.6 percent as a result of the loan guarantee 
granted by the Government to the National Electric Power Company (NEPCO) to cover part of its losses 
resulting from the shift to heavy fuel for electricity generation. 

Macroeconomic Outlook, External Financing Needs, Debt Sustainability and Risks 

16. 
The outlook for 2011-12 has become increasingly challenging in light of growing social 
pressures and uncertainty in the region.  It is expected that growth will gradually recover in 2012-2014 
(2.5 percent in 2011, 3 percent in 2012 and 3.5 percent in 2013) against a backdrop of regional and 

7 Reserves requirement was reduced from 10 percent in October 2008 to 7 percent currently.

domestic turmoil, high imported food and fuel prices, and rising sovereign financing costs .  
Macroeconomic prospects hinge in large part on the Government’s renewed commitment to fiscal 
consolidation but also on potential investments from the GCC countries as well as continued growth in 
neighboring Iraq.  

17. 
The Draft Budget Law for 2012 aims to scale the budget deficit back to 8.6 percent (a 3.5 
percentage of GDP fiscal adjustment) by increasing domestic revenues while capping current 
expenditures.  Debt interest payments are projected to increase by 11 percent, capital spending is 
scheduled to decline, and recurrent spending is being held constant (declining in real terms).  Underlying 
the medium-term fiscal framework is a number of new fiscal measures which the Government has 
indicated it will undertake in 2012.  These include re-targeting oil derivatives subsidies to the neediest of 
the low and middle income consumers, limiting electricity and water tariff subsidies to the neediest of the 
low and middle income consumers and ensuring better tax collection among other measures.  

18. 
Jordan’s total external financing needs for 2011, 2012 and 2013 are expected to amount to 
about $3.2, $3.1 and $2.9 billion respectively.  This reflects the large increase in the current account 
(e.g. quasi doubling in 2011 to 9.1 percent of GDP), driven by increased prices of imported commodities 
and lower tourism receipts.  It is envisaged that reserves will decline in 2011 (-$689 million) before 
recovering in 2012 and 2013.  The outstanding amount of foreign reserves at year-end 2011 would 
however remain sizeable around $12.1 billion, enough to finance more than seven months of imports and 
maintain the stability of the currency peg.  External financing needs will be financed, by and large, by 
FDI and portfolio inflows (about 70 percent of financing sources) and external borrowing/disbursements 
from bilateral, multilateral and private creditors (about 30 percent).  

19. 
The foreign debt is expected to remain under control and total debt growth will be mainly 
driven by domestic borrowing.  Growth of foreign debt (which represents about 36 percent of total debt) 
has remained low and contained thanks to large FDI and portfolio inflows and deliberate Government 
strategy. In sharp contrast, domestic borrowing has ballooned due to stubborn fiscal deficits and 
contingent liabilities in the energy sector in 2011.  For instance, for the year 2011, an amount of $620 
million debt guarantees was granted to the electricity company NEPCO by August 2011. As a result, the 
net public debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to rise from 61 to 65.6 percent by end-2011, its highest level 
since 2007 (see below). External debt was reduced in 2008 by 20 percentage points of GDP following a 
Paris debt buyback operation.  Its ratio to GDP increased by only 1.9 percentage point of GDP in 2010 to 
23.6 percent of GDP. Jordan’s external debt vis-à-vis bilateral and multilateral creditors, is on relatively 
favorable terms.  

20. 
The pace of debt growth experienced in 2011 is unsustainable, and Jordan has become more 
vulnerable to shocks than in the recent past.  Bank and Fund analyses conducted in 2010 showed that a 
shock (of one-half standard deviation from the baseline) to real growth, interest rates, and the primary 
balance was unlikely to bring the debt-to-GDP ratio above its 2007 level (65.1 percent in net terms).  
2007 was selected as a benchmark because it had the highest net public debt ratio between 2004 and 
2010.  Now, with net debt-to-GDP projected at 65.6 percent in 2011, Jordan’s vulnerability to shocks and 
contingent liabilities has become more significant.  A key factor to reduce this vulnerability is a renewed 
commitment to fiscal consolidation that addresses, inter alia, the contingent liabilities in the energy 
sector, the fuel subsidies (that were eliminated in 2008 and reversed in January 2011) , and the lack of 
targeting of consumer subsidies.  Complementary reforms to boost growth are also important.  Bank 
simulations show that if the Government fails to implement the announced fiscal consolidation measures 
in 2012 and the NEPCO’s financial situation continues to deteriorate, the debt-to-GDP ratio will climb to 
72 percent in net terms (77 percent in gross term in 2012).  In that scenario, gross public debt will remain 
around 77 and will only start to decline in 2014.  It is noteworthy that Jordan has a track record in 
improving debt sustainability over the past decade; for instance, the debt-to-GDP ratio was successfully 

5 

 
 
 
 
 
brought down by about 55 percentage points of GDP between 1999 and 2008.  As such, while the needed 
debt reduction is ambitious, it is not unprecedented in Jordan’s history. 

21. 
Jordan’s base case macroeconomic scenario is subject to other substantial risks, one of 
which is a strong social pressure for populist policies.  Despite a good track record in 2010, efforts to 
reign in expenditures in 2012 may be challenged by increases in international oil and food prices and 
continued expressions of discontentment by some groups in the society.  For instance, augmenting 
electricity tariffs may be delayed and additional social spending may be inevitable politically.  At the 
same time, credible progress on political reforms could help reduce pressure for populist policies.  
Political reforms are a top priority for the new Government, led by a reputed international judge.  

22. 
Other risks relate to the external environment.  One has to do with the world price of oil. 
Aggregate demand, inflation as well as fiscal and current account balances are all highly sensitive to the 
price of oil.  If oil prices remain high, and if Iraqi and international demand for Jordan’s goods and 
services remain strong, then growth and inflation are likely to be high while the fiscal and current account 
balances may deteriorate.  To the extent that the sovereign debt crisis spreads to the US and emerging 
markets and undermines global demand, Jordan will be affected indirectly through lower demand for its 
goods and services.  In particular, the United States, Iraqi and Gulf economies (Jordan’s main trading 
partners) will be crucial in this regard.  Relatedly, Jordan’s dependence on external grants exposes it to 
the vagaries of politics and economic fortunes of its partners.  For instance, external grants dropped from 
4.5 to 1.9 percent of GDP between 2008 and 2009, causing a dramatic widening in Government’s 
borrowing requirement.  To mitigate this risk, the Government has used a more conservative approach to 
predicting external grants than before the crisis:  $290 million each year through 2013.  In comparison, 
external grants totaled $1 billion in 2008, $469 million in 2009, $565 million in 2010, and more than $1.5 
billion in 2011.  Finally, the regional political and economic environment is far from stabilized as many 
of Jordan’s neighbors are undergoing civil strife or difficult transitions, and it is difficult to predict how 
these developments will affect Jordan.

TABLE 1: JORDAN’S MEDIUM-TERM OUTLOOK 

II. BUILDING LONG-TERM, SUSTAINABLE GROWTH 

23. 
Jordan needs to secure sustainable growth to reduce unemployment, especially among 
youth and women.  This goal poses a two-fold challenge:  to build resilience to shocks, and to put in 
place policies and institutions that promote good governance and boost domestic investment, 
employment, and productivity.  In addition to political reforms promoting participation, transparency and 
accountability, fiscal consolidation is a key element in Jordan’s growth challenge in the near term and a 
key building block for longer-term growth.  In addition, it will be crucial for Jordan to find ways to better 
protect vulnerable groups without permanently compromising the fiscal position, and to increase 
accountability, transparency and efficiency in the use of public resources.  Long-term growth also hinges 
on Jordan’s ability to leverage private capital for investment in infrastructure and to increase productivity 
at the firm and sector level.  Further educational reforms are needed to close skills gaps and improve 
education quality.  Reforms are also needed to address the inefficiencies inherent in the current structure 
of economic activity, including the lack of flexible labor markets, the burden of inefficient employment -

related social safety net obligations borne by small and medium enterprises, and the market -distorting 
effects of the large public sector on wages and young people’s employment expectations.  Ultimately, it is 
job creation and economic and social inclusion that are the priorities for Jordan right now -- these goals 
will be advanced by ensuring a stable macroeconomic framework that is resilient to shocks, by fostering 
sustainable, private-sector led growth, and by improving the governance framework. 

A. 

Building Stronger Growth Resilience through Fiscal Consolidation  

24. 
The impact on Jordan of the 2009 economic crisis and of the recent political events in the 
region illustrates the need to build resilience against external shocks.  Jordan will need to buffer 
declines in external demand and capital inflows through counter-cyclical policies that maintain and/or 
boost domestic demand and domestic private investment.  In the long term, growth resilience depends on 
building a fiscal position that provides a self-sustaining foundation for growth, with robust domestic 
private investments that complement FDI inflows and contribute a growing share of capital accumulation 
and growth.   

25. 
The Government recognizes the need to build fiscal space and plans to return to its path of 
fiscal consolidation in 2012.  As noted above, in 2010 Government made considerable strides, reducing 
the deficit from 8.9 percent of GDP in 2009 to 5.6 percent.  However, significant deviations from the 
fiscal consolidation path occurred in the first half of 2011 in the context of the regional turmoil and rising 
international prices on food and fuel.  Going forward, the Draft Budget Law for 2012 aims to scale the 
budget deficit back to 8.6 percent (a 3.5 percent of GDP fiscal adjustment) by increasing domestic 
revenues, while capping current expenditures.  Debt interest payments are projected to increase by 11 
percent, capital spending is scheduled to decline, and recurrent spending is being held constant (declining 
in real terms).  The alignment of salaries and wages between independent institutions (which enjoy higher 
salaries) and the public administration (which will be allocated the savings from cuts in independent 
institutions’ salaries) will increase overall salaries.  This will be compensated by cuts in other operations 
spending.  Underlying the medium-term fiscal framework is a number of new fiscal measures which the 
Government has indicated it will undertake in 2012.  These include re-targeting oil derivatives subsidies 
to the neediest of the low and middle income consumers, limiting electricity and water tariff subsidies to 
the neediest of the low and middle income consumers, and ensuring better tax collection among other 
measures.  The strategy underlying these measures is reflected in the Medium-Term Expenditure 
Framework 2011-2014 and the Budget Preparation and Priority Paper, both of which were submitted for 
approval by the Council of Ministers before the adoption of the 2012 Budget Law. 

26. 
The pursuit of deficit reduction points to the need for spending efficiency and for 
prioritization of expenditures.  This is important in order to ensure efficient use of scarce resources and 
to maintain growth-enhancing capital expenditures as well as critical spending on maintenance of 
productive assets.  Jordan is currently exploring different financing schemes to finance priority capital 
investments.  This is particularly relevant to the consideration of a number of infrastructure mega -projects 
(national railways, nuclear energy, and the Red-Dead Sea conveyance project) that will require huge 
investments, including from the public sector.   

27. 
In addition to prioritizing capital expenditure, the Government has indicated its willingness 
to ensure greater efficiency and prioritization of recurrent expenditures .  Reform is needed in the 
pension system, which now accounts for 11 percent of total public spending, and in other social safety 
nets, to target them better to the most vulnerable populations.  Also, given that the public sector makes up 
45 percent of GDP in Jordan, there is a strong justification for reducing the duplication of agency 
functions, increasing productivity and efficiency, and improving service delivery.  In this context, 
leveraging the existing e-Government infrastructure and encouraging the re-use of successful applications 

8 

 
 
 
 
 
 
across different agencies is a priority.  The Government has begun to examine the scope for enhancing tax 
revenues through improved administration and rationalization of exemptions; it is placing greater 
emphasis on the administration of the larger files, merging the income tax department with the sales tax 
department, and simplifying tax rules and aligning them with European regulations. 

28. 
The Government continues to make public financial management (PFM) reform a priority. 
While many reform elements have been introduced or are underway in fiscal transparency and the control 
of expenditures, progress has been uneven, and not all of them have yet yielded tangible improvements on 
the ground.  Accounting, auditing, and the internal control framework are particular areas where further 
improvement is needed.  The remaining agenda also includes strengthening coordination to reduce 
fragmentation in policy and budget management; strengthening the analytical basis for expenditures; and 
addressing capacity constraints.  Full implementation of the Government’s financial management 
information system and reforms of the internal control framework are critical for successful 
implementation of Government-wide public sector reform, including PFM reform.   

B. 

Strengthening Governance, Transparency and Accountability   

29. 
The Government recognizes that Jordan’s continued economic and social advancement 
depends greatly on the quality and effectiveness of its public administration.  Government 
acknowledges the need to reform the public sector to turn it into a public service that is focused on 
delivering results and that is accountable for such results.  Key objectives include enhancing public 
participation in decision making, strengthening the role of civil society institutions, building trust between 
citizens and institutions, and adopting principles of transparency, good governance, and accountability.  
The recent National Dialogue initiative and the recently proposed political reforms, including expected 
changes in the representation system (through the political parties and election laws) are also necessary 
elements of a new governance practice that promotes transparency, participation and accountability.     

30. 
Over time, different parts of an enabling environment for increased public sector 
performance, accountability and transparency have been developed.  Jordan has since 2006 enacted 
an Access to Information Law and passed an Anti-Corruption Law, and Government has established or 
sought to strengthen institutions that support a results focus and enhance transparency, accountability, and 
good governance.  These institutions include the Audit Bureau, the Ombudsman Bureau, the Anti -
Corruption Commission, and the King Abdullah II Center of Excellence (which conducts assessments of 
ministries and institutions’ performance and service quality).  Accountability in the public sector is 
further supported by the Government’s Performance Administration Unit (attached to the Prime Ministry) 
which measures public sector performance.  Mechanisms have been developed to strengthen the voice of 
citizens through the Complaints Hotline.   

31. 
Nevertheless, there are a number of areas where further work is needed.   More effort is 
needed to enhance access to information and to ensure that the quality of regulations and their application 
are in line with international standards.  Along these lines, the implementation of Jordan’s anti-corruption 
legislation needs strengthening.  In addition efforts are needed to build a performance-based, client-
focused public sector that delivers high quality services.  The public sector reforms being considered by 
the Government should contribute to improving the Government’s ability to develop, implement and 
manage policies. Additional efforts will be undertaken to enhance transparency of Government operations 
and the accountability relationship between the Government and its citizens.

BOX 1: INTERNATIONAL COMPARISON OF JORDAN’S GOVERNANCE 
INDICATORS 

Jordan has traditionally been one of the strongest performers in the region and among countries at a similar level of development on 
many aspects of governance.  However, a review of governance indicators over the past several years shows that governance 
ratings for Jordan have declined relative to other countries and that institutions need to be further strengthened in order to support 
the country’s ambitions to compete on a global basis.   

The 2010 World Economic Forum’s Arab World Competitiveness Review shows that Jordan, while a good performer in the region, 
saw its ratings deteriorate in relative terms from 2005 to 2010, and the country now stands at 65 out of 139 countries worldw ide.  
This decline can be attributed to poorer assessments of public sector institutions, incentive structure in the workplace, transparency 
of Government policy making and the burden of Government regulation.  

Scores from the 2010 Open Budget show that Jordan’s budget process is relatively transparent.  Jordan’s score of 50 i s the highest 
in the region and above the worldwide average.  At the same time, the scores point to the need to strengthen dissemination of 
related budget and financial activities to the public to include information on outputs and outcomes; budget oversight; and public 
participation in budget discussions.  

Global Integrity Jordan Indicators 

Jordan Overall Performance and 
Implementation Gap 

Data from Global Integrity shows that between 2007 and 2009, Jordan’s ranking on a number of governance indicators has slippe d, 
namely in the areas of: oversight and regulations; and administration and civil service. A comparative regional assessment of 
overall rankings on these indicators shows that, while 2007 numbers positioned Jordan well above the regional average, the decl ine 
of recent years has repositioned it at par vis-à-vis other countries in MENA, and Jordan’s overall ranking has moved from moderate 
to very weak.  Figure 2 illustrates that while Jordan has a strong legal framework compared to other countries, actual 
implementation and enforcement of legislation and regulations needs to be strengthened to enable more effective implementatio n of 
policies.

Supporting Sustainable Growth through Investments in Core Infrastructure and 
Improvements in the Business Climate 

32. 
In addition to creating the fiscal space necessary to respond during external shocks, it is important 
to address the requirements for long-term sustainable growth, including investment in critical 
infrastructure and improvements in the business climate.

Water, Energy, Climate Change and Transport 

33. 
Reducing water scarcity and increasing the efficiency of water use are critical for Jordan. 
Jordan is one of the ten most water-stressed countries in the world.  Its per capita annual renewable 
resources of 145 cubic meters per capita are far below the threshold of severe water scarcity of 500 cubic 
meters.  About 64 percent of its water was withdrawn by agriculture in 2007, which accounted for only 
2.1 percent of gross domestic product (GDP). The water needs for irrigation, industrial and domestic uses, 
wetland protection and in-stream habitat needs; the deterioration of water quality and control of water-
borne diseases, continue to pose serious challenges.  Demographic and economic growth has added 
further strain on the very limited water supply of the country.  The Government has laid out its long-term 
strategy for the country.  It is constructing the last small dams and the Disi-Amman system to mobilize 
additional water.  It is exploring additional sources of supply such as deep aquifers and brackish and 
large-scale seawater desalination.  Efforts are being made to optimize the use of existing resources by 
reducing physical and commercial losses.  Efficiency improvements are part of the strategy as currently 
16 percent of the country’s energy resources are consumed by water delivery.   

34. 
Climate variability and change are challenging economic growth and livelihoods in Jordan.   
Findings drawn from global assessments of climate change show a significant increase in the number of 
dry days, heat waves, warm nights and length of growing seasons as well as fewer frost days by 2080.  
Jordan will become a hot spot of severe water stress by 2050:  water yield is likely to be reduced by 40-60 
percent by 2050 as a result of a 10 percent reduction in precipitation and a temperature increase of two 
degrees.  Water scarcity and climate variability will further increase Jordan’s dependence on food 
imports, particularly wheat and barley as 97 percent of Jordan’s consumption of these grains is imported.  
This raises concerns about exposure to international food price volatility.  Going forward, it is critical for 
Jordan to address water scarcity and climate variability challenges through investments in adaptation to 
climate change.  Better management of exposure to international food price volatility will require the 
development of financial hedging instruments and possibly grain storage capacity.    

35. 
Jordan is very dependent on energy imports, mainly in the form of crude oil and natural 
gas which account for more 98 percent of the country’s energy needs and represent about 20 
percent of GDP.   Though Jordan has been diversifying its sources of supply by importing natural gas 
from Egypt, the volume available for such imports remains small , and recent disruptions of the pipeline 
point to the uncertainty around this supply source.  Implementation of energy efficiency programs and 
changing the energy mix though the gradual development of renewable and other non-conventional 
energy resources are now part of the Government’s priorities. 

36. 
Jordan was one of the first countries in the region to initiate fundamental reforms in the 
electricity sector and has made significant progress.  The Government has set an ambitious 10 percent 
target for renewable energy as part of the total energy mix by 2020 with a particular focus on the 
development of wind and solar power plants.  To promote investments in renewable energy and energy 
efficiency, the Government approved in February 2010 the Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency 
(REEE) Law which required the creation of the Jordan REEE Fund.  Government will work on 
developing the necessary regulations required by the new law.  

37. 
Transport accounts for about 11 percent of GDP and earns foreign exchange through the 
provision of transshipment services via the Port of Aqaba and overland transport routes .  Jordan 
has a well developed highway and roads network that extends beyond the Amman urban area .  The roads 
infrastructure has adequate capacity but requires enhanced maintenance.  Certain links in the trunk road 
system are missing, particularly a complete ring road in the rapidly urbanizing Greater Amman Area. 
Another priority need in the transport sector is for an integrated urban public transport system in the 

11 

 
 
 
 
 
 
Amman metropolitan area to alleviate congestion and improve mobility.  The Government has reformed 
transport services, including privatizing public enterprises and liberalizing the trucking industry.  
Together with the European Investment Bank, it is preparing a National Highway Master Plan that will 
serve as the basis for all major inter-urban highway sector developments in Jordan in 2010-30.  

38. 
The Government is contemplating the preparation of three mega-projects:  the National 
Railways project, the Nuclear Energy project, and the Red-Dead Sea conveyance project.  These 
projects hold the potential to provide the necessary supply for water, energy, and transport services to 
meet medium- and long-term demand.  Their sheer size may make them attractive for private sector 
participation if their financial viability can be guaranteed.  While the private sector is expected to play a 
role in financing these projects via public-private partnerships (PPPs), the Government is refining its 
feasibility studies to determine the level of Government contribution needed to attract the private sector 
and the best sequencing of implementation over time.  

39. 
Jordan recognizes that promoting environmentally and socially sustainable growth creates 
economic value and opportunities for its citizens, while also improving the environment and protecting 
global public goods for future generations.  Enhancing Jordan’s environmental management will not only 
improve the well being of Jordanians but will also enable the country to compete better in increasingly 
environmentally conscious markets.  Recognizing the strategic relevance of the municipal solid waste 
sector, the Government has established a number of targets for improved management of municipal solid 
waste in the Greater Amman Municipality.  However, municipalities outside of Amman are still suffering 
from poor waste disposal practices with a negative impact on the environment, natural resources, public 
health, and tourism.   

Business Climate 

40. 
Beyond public investment in infrastructure, an environment conducive to private sector 
investment and entrepreneurship is key.  As shown in analytical work undertaken by the WBG over 
the last several years (Jordan’s Investment Climate Assessment (2007), Jordan Financial Sector 
Assessment Program Development Module (2010); ―Doing Business 2012‖ (2011); and ―Making a 
Difference for Entrepreneurs‖ (2010)), Jordan needs to further simplify regulations affecting private 
businesses, strengthen the legal framework for private sector participation in Government projects, and 
enhance SMEs’ access to finance to foster growth and employment.  With regard to the latter, a national 
program was launched in 2011 to support SMEs through loan guarantees, technical assistance and 
targeted grants that aim to enhance female employment, innovation and competitiveness. 

41. 
The Government has been working on improving business regulation over the last four 
years, and a Committee headed by the Ministry of Planning and International Cooperation has devised a 
strategy to improve the business environment on the basis of the framework provided by the ―Doing 
Business‖ report and key areas of concern that were underlined by the 2007 Investment Climate Survey.  
Major improvements have been observed in some areas; for example, the required paid in minimum 
capital went from 795.4 percent of Gross National Income (GNI) in 2007 down to zero percent in 2011, 
and the cost of obtaining construction permits was reduced by 42 percent between 2007 and 2011.  
Notwithstanding these achievements, Jordan has been overtaken in the Doing Business rankings by other 
countries that have more active and effective business regulation reform programs, and Jordan’s ranking 
in the ―Doing Business 2012‖ report has dropped from 95 in 2011 to 96 today.  In a number of areas, 
including registering property, official fees remain relatively high compared to other regional and global 
practices.   

42. 
The SME sector is a leading source of exports, employment, and incomes in Jordan, yet it 
faces both new and long-standing constraints to its development.  SMEs will be a key player in the 

12 

 
 
 
 
 
 
shift to high-value growth sectors, initially through enterprise creation and subsequently through 
providing services and inputs, and increasing productivity through adopting and applying innovations. 
Efforts will need to be made to remove constraints and to encourage innovation, apply new technologies, 
and support the development of these enterprises, especially those among them that are capable of moving 
up the value chain.  Facilitating SMEs’ access to credit through adequate guarantees and collaboration 
with local banks is instrumental in this regard.  The Central Bank has strengthened banking supervision 
and introduced measures under the Basel II Capital Accord to reduce its risks while easing monetary 
policy to stimulate credit to the private sector.  In addition, the Government is in the process of launching 
a program to support SMEs through loan guarantees, technical assistance and targeted grants with a 
special emphasis on the periphery of the country where work opportunities have been most limited.  

43. 
The Government has initiated wide-ranging legal and financial reforms to broaden access 
to financial services.  Credit reporting and information sharing is being improved through the public 
credit registry and a newly adopted Credit Bureau Law.  Collateral constraints have also to be eased, and 
a framework for Secured Transactions is being developed to allow the use of movable assets as collateral 
and out-of-court collateral enforcement.  Telecoms and payments innovations also show promise for 
improving access to finance.  

D. 

Supporting Sustainable Growth through Enhancing Human Capital and Competitiveness 

44. While total factor productivity growth was good over the period 2000-08, and Jordan’s 
performance is good in the context of the region8, it pales when compared to that of countries like 
Malaysia and Chile.  Jordan can do better if it implements reforms to close skills gaps in its education 
system, improves education quality, and anchors its innovation policy on private sector competitiveness. 

45. Modernizing the education system and harmonizing curriculum and teacher skills with the 
objectives of science and technology excellence is critical.  Numerous efforts are underway to improve 
educational quality, enhance technical and vocational training, better link the education system to the 
labor market, and raise the prestige of the vocational/non-academic stream of learning.  By modernizing 
the education system overall and improving the quality, relevance, and coherence of higher education 
institutions, Jordan can reduce the mismatch between labor market needs and available skills.  

46. 
To attract foreign investment and compete successfully in markets beyond the region, 
Jordan needs to raise its students’ skills to international levels and address lagging areas.  Key 
education sector challenges include:  (i) overcrowded schools in urgent need of upgrading and expansion; 
(ii) the need to expand access to early childhood education, especially in poor urban areas and rural areas; 
and (iii) the high percentage of the education budget spent on wages and salaries which leaves little room 
for the needed capital and quality-enhancing investments; and (iv) the low enrollment in vocational 
education (between 12 to 14 percent)—which suggests a need to realign vocational education to the 
demands of the labor market. 

47. 
In higher education, Jordan has made significant progress and is addressing remaining 
challenges including:  (i) very high enrollment growth rates which are increasingly becoming difficult to 
accommodate while maintaining quality; (ii) declining public financing for higher education amidst rising 
tuition fees and the absence of a significant student aid scheme; (iii) misalignment between community 
colleges’ curricula and the demands of the labor market; (iv) a rigid governance system that restrains 
universities’ ability to respond to emerging needs of the labor market; (v) lack of university autonomy, 

8 The Investment Climate Assessment (World Bank 2007) shows that ―Jordanian manufacturing firms are as efficient as Turkish 
firms and nearly 40 percent more efficient than Indian manufacturers.‖ 

13 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                 
which is hindering innovation; and (vi) a weak relationship between universities and research institutes on 
one side, and the industrial and service sectors on the other. 

48. 
Unemployment continues to be high, standing at 13 percent of the labor force overall, 21 
percent among women and 30 percent among university graduates.  This points to several issues 
relating to both the educational system and the labor market.  At the macro level, the Jordanian economy 
is not generating enough jobs to absorb the more than 60,000 young citizens who enter the labor market 
annually.9  Major constraints arise from the structure of economic activity, the lack of flexible labor 
markets, and a large presence of the public sector with market-distorting effects on wages and youth 
expectations. 

49. 
Jordan’s rate of female labor force participation, at around 15 percent, is among the lowest 
in the region and in the world.  This is especially paradoxical given Jordan’s huge investments in 
female education.  Female enrollment in tertiary education has exceeded that of male enrollmen t, and 
while females represent about 40 percent of the employees in the public sector, they do not exceed 13 
percent in the private sector. The situation is particularly difficult for young women, whose 
unemployment rate is 36 percent compared to 19 percent among young men.  Young women account for 
only nine percent of the economically active population.  The structure of the economy offers few 
opportunities for unskilled and semi-skilled women (who make up most of the economically inactive 
population).  For married women with children, the cost and availability of daycare alternatives is an 
important element in the decision to participate in the labor force.  Moreover, in the past, employers 
tended to prefer hiring men (or single women) to avoid paying for maternity leave; while the Social 
Security Law has introduced a socialized payroll deduction in place of the direct payment from 
employers, the effects of the previous disincentive can still be seen in the unemployment figures today.  
Finally, the fact that educated women are more likely to be unemployed than uneducated women suggests 
that women face considerable barriers to employment entry across a wide range of educational choices.10

Source: Jordan Employment-Unemployment Survey (EUS), 2009 and 2010. 

9 Recent projections show that the number of Jordanian entrants into the labor market over the next five years wil l be 50,000 to 
75,000 annually.  This reflects annual growth in the labor force of about 3.2 percent.  See Arouri (2010), ―Labor force migration 
in Jordan,‖ mimeo.  Assuming that about 20 percent of jobs will be filled by foreign workers, the economy will need to create 
60,000 to 90,000 jobs every year.  In recent years, the best job creation performance, which was accompanied by high GDP 
growth (as in 2007 when growth was 7.6 percent and 56,000 jobs were created), was still only able to absorb the new entrants, 
thus leaving the unemployment rate unchanged at 13 percent. 
10 According to the Jordan Employment-Unemployment Survey (EUS), 2010, 62% of unemployed women hold a Bachelor’s 
degree or above, and the unemployment rate among women with this education level is 25%, whereas it is 15% among women 
with less than a high school degree.  The unemployment rate among men is the same (11%) in both these categories.

50. 
The Government has begun implementing a National Employment Strategy focused on 
addressing the above constraints and on increasing female participation by:  (i) targeting several of 
its vocational and micro-finance programs toward unskilled and semi -skilled females; (ii) approving the 
new Social Security Law which provides for a new maternity insurance scheme which is financed by both 
male and female payroll contributions to eliminate discrimination in hiring decisions; and (iii) expanding 
public kindergarten schooling and the provision of day care franchises to address the acute shortage of 
day care spaces and quality issues. 

51. 
Jordan’s investments in education, its highly skilled diaspora, and its location near large 
markets make the country ripe for pursuing innovation.  While the Government has put in place a 
number of programs to encourage innovation, there is need for greater cohesion among these initiatives 
and for an integrated innovation policy that will help support long-term productivity growth.  This policy 
should expand beyond a focus on science and technology and be driven by firm competitiveness.  In 
addition, the institutions involved in innovation policy need adequate funding and experienced staff and 
the innovation services provided by Government entities should be demand-driven.  A recent assessment 
of innovation policies and performance recommended the establishment of a central anchor for innovation 
policy and a mechanism for funding risk.  

E. 

Fostering Inclusion through Effective Social Protection and Local Development  

52. 
Another crucial dimension of resilience and of political stability is the effectiveness of 
measures to address the population more inclusively and to protect vulnerable groups.  While 
Jordan made substantial progress in poverty reduction between 1997 and 2006 (poverty declined from 21 
percent to 13 percent over this period), the impact of local development initiatives has been 
geographically uneven.  Moreover, during the past few years, sharp increases in oil and food prices, the 
removal of fuel subsidies, and the global economic downturn have put pressure on the living standards of 
many Jordanians, particularly those at the bottom of the income distribution.  In 2010, ten additional 
poverty pockets, i.e., areas where 25 percent of the population or more fall below the poverty line, 
showed up in the poverty map, raising the total number to 32 from 22 in 2006. 

53. 
Jordan’s social protection system consists of the social insurance system, which covers 36 
percent of the labor force at an annual cost of 5.7 percent of GDP; social safety net programs, 
which cover about 8 percent of the population at a cost of about one percent of GDP; and active 
labor market programs and policies, which include mainly vocational training and in-service 
training.  Reforms to the social insurance system were introduced in Social Security Law Number 7, 
2010, and work is underway to improve the targeting of the social safety net programs, but there is scope 
to further improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the system, with a view to putting in place fiscally 
affordable safety nets that are designed flexibly to be deployed in the event of an economic shock and 
phased out after the end of a crisis.  The recent shocks that have impacted Jordan so heavily have 
demonstrated the need to combine:  (i) income support to the unemployed with (ii) social assistance 
targeted to the chronically poor.  Income support in the form of unemployment benefits helps laid-off 
workers and could also have macroeconomic benefits through stabilizing aggregate demand.  

54. 
Stronger local governance and greater responsiveness to citizen needs can help address 
Jordan’s regional disparities and reduce pockets of poverty. 
 By moving resources and 
responsibilities for service delivery to local Governments and by supporting community-driven 
development, the governance of public institutions and project-level administration can be strengthened.  
Expanding microfinance is another way to help promote local development and create job opportunities 
where these are desperately needed.  With a view to fostering local development, the Government has 
improved the mechanism for capital investments at the municipal level through the introduction of 

15 

 
 
 
 
 
 
performance-based incentives.  However, many municipalities (though to a lesser extent the Greater 
Amman Municipality) still need to improve their municipal management capacity and budgeting.  To 
jumpstart development at the local level, a three-pronged approach needs to be implemented to:  (i) 
increase local participation in decision making, implementation and monitoring of programs; (ii) develop 
the capacity of sub-national institutions to plan, carry out, and manage their development programs; and 
(iii) exploit local endowments and assets as a means of catalyzing local economic development through 
tourism and small industries. 

55. 
Tourism is Jordan’s largest export sector and can also serve as a vehicle for local economic 
development.  Travel and tourism account for about 12 percent of GDP and provide both direct and 
indirect employment opportunities, including in some of the poorer parts of the country.   Many of 
Jordan’s most significant cultural and historic assets are located in secondary cities, and their potential 
needs to be further developed to ensure local development benefits accrue throughout the country. 

III. THE GOVERNMENT’S DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM 

A. 

National Agenda (2006-15) and Executive Development Program (2011-13) 

56. 
The National Agenda was initiated in 2005 as a holistic approach to the reform process and 
encompassed a wide variety of political, economic and social policies that were to be linked to the 
budget and include timelines and performance indicators.  The overall objective of the National Agenda is 
to improve the quality of life of all segments of the Jordanian society; it envisages three distinct phases in 
Jordan’s socioeconomic development.  Phase I (2007-12) centers on job creation through the development 
of labor-intensive and export-oriented industries while reshaping the skills of the labor force.  It also 
envisages public sector reforms and liberalization of state-controlled markets.  Phase II (2013-17) 
includes the promotion of capital-intensive industries and the expansion of the service sectors as well as a 
transition to higher value-added occupations.  Phase III (2018-onward) envisages Jordan becoming a 
world-class knowledge economy.     

57. 
The Government’s new Executive Development Program (EDP) for 2011-13, introduced in 
the summer of 2010, and updated in December 2010 and 2011, builds on the National Agenda and 
serves as an action plan for the Government for the next stage.  The EDP responded to the consequences 
of the global crisis with a comprehensive work plan that set out detailed economic objectives, policy 
initiatives, projects, and indicators to measure outcomes.  The EDP was prepared using a participatory 
approach, drawing from sectoral strategies as well as from the recommendations of Parliament regarding 
fiscal and economic reforms.11  Its main objectives are:  (i) strengthen the independence and integrity of 
judicial authorities and develop the legislative framework; (ii) maintain financial and monetary stability 
and increase self-reliance; (iii) reform the public sector as well as human resources and increase their 
productivity; (iv) enhance the knowledge-based economy and harmonize education outputs with labor 
market requirements; (v) create an appropriate environment for business and investment and promote the 
national economy’s competitiveness; (vi) increase local exports and open up new markets to support 
Jordanian producers; (vii) promote tourism and preserve Jordanian cultural heritage; (viii) enhance the 
agricultural sector’s competitiveness and raise its quantitative and qualitative productivity; (ix) promote 
local development to achieve a high level of developmental balance between governorates, protect the 
middle class, reduce poverty and reduce unemployment; (x) expand the base of social services, provide 
infrastructure including appropriate housing and focus on poverty pockets; (xi) develop water sources and 
upgrade their management efficiency; (xii) secure energy supply and diversify energy sources; (xiii) raise 

11 The 2011 draft Budget Law was prepared in accordance with the final draft of the Program agreed upon by the ministerial 
committees. 

16 

 
 
 
 
 
                                                 
the competitiveness of information technology and knowledge transfer; and (xiv) encourage the private 
sector to enter into partnerships to undertake major development projects, particularly in the fields of 
energy, water, transportation and industrial zones. 

58. Most recently, in its presentation to the Deauville Partnership in the Fall of 2011, the 
Government drew heavily on the EDP as its medium-term socio-economic development plan and 
noted that events in the region have underscored the need to accelerate the political reform agenda and to 
ensure that the dividends of economic reforms are shared across the country.  In this context, in addition 
to improved governance, job creation and private sector development are primary goals, along with 
addressing challenges in the energy and water sectors. 

IV. WORLD BANK GROUP PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY 

59. 
The WBG and Jordan have built a strong and flexible partnership that has enabled frank and 
substantive discussion about the country’s development challenges as well as the areas where the WBG is 
seen to bring the most value to Jordan, especially in the context of other donor assistance.  The WBG 
program has been demand-driven, and has proved its ability to respond flexibly to unanticipated changes 
in Jordan’s circumstances and needs, including for budget support during the crisis of 2009.  The 
momentous changes now taking place in MENA emphasize the need for continued flexibility.  For its 
part, the WBG recognizes the importance of listening and responding to opportunities to add value when 
asked by the Government to do so and where it is well placed to do so.  Given the strong presence of a 
number of other development partners in Jordan, the Bank’s support is often complemented by the work 
of others.  For example, USAID has a large technical and financial assistance program in the areas of 
fiscal management, SME development and competitiveness, PPPs, and water.  The European Union (EU) 
is providing support to local development, especially in lagging areas and is also supporting fiscal 
sustainability along the same lines as the Bank.  The European Investment Bank (EIB) is one of the 
largest lenders to the private sector, especially in infrastructure, and has also engaged in support of SME 
development.  The focus of the Agence Française de Développement (AFD) has been on financing 
infrastructure and tourism development, often in parallel with the WBG, and may also support fiscal 
sustainability, growth and jobs.  Against this backdrop, and in light of the relatively small size of the 
Bank’s lending program, it is important for the Bank to coordinate its support with other partners with a 
view to maximizing the impact of its contribution to Jordan’s development goals. 

A. 

Lessons Learned 

60. 
The CPS takes account of lessons that have emerged in the Bank Group’s work in Jordan 
over the last several years.  First, it recognizes that the Bank Group must be able to respond quickly to 
changing country circumstances. It uses a flexible framework whereby the WBG will respond to 
Government and private sector requests for financing and analytical and advisory services insofar as this 
support is aligned with the main objectives of the strategy.  Second, since Government and other 
stakeholders have underscored that selectivity is an important guiding principle, the Bank will focus on a 
few of Jordan’s strategic priorities, with a view to ensuring complementarity and coordination with other 
donor assistance.  These priorities will be determined over the CPS period in coordination with the 
authorities to ensure the Government’s ownership and engagement.  IFC has considerably scaled-up its 
program in Jordan over the last five years.  In doing so, the Corporation has become a key player in 
supporting the private sector and in particular advancing Jordan’s PPP agenda.  

17 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
61. 
The WBG recognizes the need for continued strong analytical work and technical assistance 
as well as for broad consultation on challenging reforms.  The Completion Report of the 2006-2010 
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) showed that a strong analytical foundation positively influenced the 
mobilization of political and financial support for key reforms (see Annex 2 below).  The WBG’s high 
quality analytical and advisory work has made important contributions to the Government’s development 
agenda, especially in economic diversification and competitiveness, access to finance, investment climate 
reforms, and public-private partnership.  The WBG’s TA and advisory services have also had a 
significant impact on reform (for example in the area of social insurance).  Because experience shows the 
need to ensure broad consultation among all affected stakeholders before beginning to design a difficult 
reform program, the WBG will continue to use its convening power to help sustain collaboration, 
consistency, and communication among the actors involved in reform.  

62. 
The CPS results matrix reflects the need to be realistic.  The results matrix from the 2006 
CAS now appears to have been overly ambitious.  The results matrix associated with the new CPS 
presents a selected set of indicators, derived from the WBG’s ongoing program of support and from those 
planned activities that will produce tangible outcomes within the next two to three years.  At the time of 
the CPS mid-term review (when the CPS Progress Report is presented to the Board), additional indicators 
will be added as needed to capture any new program elements that will produce results within the 
remaining CPS period.  

B. 

Current Portfolio 

63. 
As of November 30, 2011, Jordan’s total active portfolio was valued at $279.1 million of 
which 87 percent ($243.5 million for seven investment lending projects) is financed by IBRD and 13 
percent ($35.6 million for twelve projects, including one technical assistance project executed by the 
Bank) is financed by Bank-administered trust funds.  In addition, there are two guarantees valued at $60 
million: (i) $45 million from IBRD for the Amman East Power Guarantee Project; and (ii) $15 million 
from the Carbon Fund for Amman Landfill Gas Recovery Project.  Urban and Tourism Development 
account for the largest share of the portfolio at 34 percent followed by Transport and Education at 21 
percent and 20 percent respectively (Figure 1).  The quality of the portfolio during the last CAS period 
(FY06-FY10) was generally satisfactory, with one problem project.12   

64. 
Beginning in FY11, however, the portfolio started showing some signs of weakness , which is 
reflected today in five problem projects: the Regional and Local Development Project; the Employer-
Driven Skills Development Project; the Social Protection Enhancement Project; the Amman Solid Waste 
Project; and the Second Education Reform for the Knowledge Economy Project .  47.8 % of total IBRD 
commitments are at risk.  Several implementation issues have emerged mainly concerning complex 
project design, lack of ownership, interruptions in counterpart financing, and low capacity of 
implementing agencies.  Frequent change of leadership within ministries has also affected project 
performance.  In all these cases, the Bank is working with counterparts to develop action plans to improve 
performance, including restructuring as needed.  In addition, work is underway on a Country Portfolio 
Performance Review which will address the systemic issues that cut across the portfolio and will involve 
the Ministry of Planning and International Cooperation, the Ministry of Finance, and relevant line 
ministries. 

12 From FY06-FY09, the Public Sector Reform Capacity Building Project was in problem status.  It was cancelled in March 2008 
at the request of the Government.

In addition to the investment portfolio, Jordan has a substantial trust fund portfolio 
totaling $50.6 million which reflects the emphasis of the Bank’s strategy on Government accountability, 
environmental sustainability, education and jobs (in particular for women), private sector -led growth and 
local development/inclusion (Table 4).  The trust fund portfolio comprises thirteen active grants and is 
financed by a range of Bank-administered trust funds, including the Institutional Development Fund 
(IDF), the Global Environment Facility (GEF), the Ozone Trust Fund of the Montreal Protocol (OTF), the 
Gender Trust Fund (GENTF), the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), Cities 
Alliance (CITIES), the State and Peace Building Fund (SPF), the Japan Social Development Fund 
(JSDF), and the Carbon Fund (CF).  In addition, Jordan benefits from a Regional GEF grant that finances 
the improvement of local and transboundary water resources and agricultural management in countries

around the Mediterranean Sea.13  Jordan's trust fund portfolio performance has been generally good.  The 
implementation of grants has been satisfactory with an overall disbursement rate of 56 percent (excluding 
the Carbon Fund guarantee).  To date, two GEF projects are in problem project status.  The Integrated 
Ecosystem Management in the Jordan Rift Valley Project showed signs of weakness and became a 
problem project by the second half of FY11.  Most recently, the Promotion of a Wind Power Market 
Project was downgraded due to substantial delays in a major component which affected project 
implementation.  The Bank is reviewing progress with Government and will recalibrate the action plans, 
including restructuring, as needed.

66. WB-financed projects do not yet rely on Jordan’s own financial management information 
system.  As this system (GFMIS) becomes more functional, the Bank plans to rely on it for preparing 
project-specific requests.  It intends to utilize single treasury accounts over time, and to rely on the Audit 
Bureau as the external auditor of WB-administered resources, initially on a pilot basis for auditing grants. 
The Bank expects to fully utilize various aspects of Jordan’s public financial management system for 
WB-financed projects by the end of the CPS period. Overall, the level of fiduciary risk is currently 
assessed as moderate/substantial.

IFC has scaled up its investment activities in Jordan considerably during the last few years. 
Its portfolio has grown from $50 million at end-FY05 to about $524 million at end-September 2011.  In 
addition, IFC mobilized $310 million in additional funding to a number of its key projects.  In expanding 
its activities, IFC’s strategy focused on supporting infrastructure development, access to finance, and 
Public-Private Partnership.  Despite the difficult environment in the second half of the fiscal year , IFC 
committed $141 million in five projects and mobilized $90 million in the chemicals sector in Jordan in 
FY11.  These investments were primarily in the financial sector (trade finance), and a $215 million 
investment ($125 million IFC account and $90 million in mobilization) in a chemicals project.  In FY10, 
IFC committed $77 million in seven companies primarily in the financial sector (trade and microfinance) , 
and $50 million in investments in a fertilizer project (see Annex B8 for the details of IFC’s investment 
portfolio).  MIGA’s portfolio has grown from zero at end-FY05 to $4 million gross exposure at end-June 
2011, all in the waste water sector. 

C. 

World Bank Group Assistance Strategy 

68. 
The World Bank Group will support Jordan in its efforts to lay a foundation for inclusive 
growth and job creation through a three-pronged strategy:  (i) strengthen fiscal management and 
increase accountability; (ii) strengthen the foundation for sustainable growth with a focus on 
competitiveness; and (iii) enhance inclusion through social protection and local development.  In light of 
the Government’s increased focus on transparency, public participation, and Government accountability, 
the World Bank Group will also seek opportunities to support these efforts across the portfolio (Figure 2).  
In this regard, support will be provided to involve relevant stakeholders in policy development, 
implementation and monitoring and to strengthen the existing institutional framework relating to 
performance, transparency (including information disclosure in user-friendly formats) and accountability 
within the public sector.  WBG advisory services and interventions at sectoral levels will also mainstream 
a sectoral governance and social accountability agenda (such as through the Affiliated Network of Social 
Accountability – Arab World), aimed at strengthening transparency, accountability, and systematic 
consultation with the private sector and civil society organizations regarding policy reforms and 
Government programs. 

FIGURE 2:  LAYING A FOUNDATION FOR SUSTAINABLE GROWTH AND  
JOB CREATION

69. 
In response to Government’s request for more targeted WBG support, the Bank Group will 
focus its activities on areas of its comparative advantage and will seek opportunities to complement 
other donor financing and to leverage resources from the private sector.  This will be done by 
providing targeted analytical work, advisory services, and technical assistance supporting key structural 
reforms through a series of programmatic development policy loans; and by providing guarantees and 
IFC’s lending and equity investments to leverage private sector resources in growth-enhancing 
infrastructure. 

Pillar I:  Strengthen Fiscal Management and Increase Accountability 

70. 
A primary goal of the Government is to maintain financial stability and to enhance 
Government administration so that it becomes transparent and subject to accountability at the 
central and local levels.   
To support this goal the Bank will focus on:  (i) improving public financial management; (ii) increasing 
the efficiency of public expenditures; and (iii) strengthening mechanisms for both internal and external 
accountability.  

Results area I.1:  Improve public financial management, improve efficiency of public expenditures; 
and strengthen accountability 

Government objectives (EDP):  Maintain financial and monetary stability and increase self-reliance; 
Enhance Government’s performance efficiency and effectiveness and empower it to use transparency and 
accountability tools; Protect public money and enhance monitoring over it 
CPS outcomes:  
1. Improved targeting of subsidies 
2. Modern Internal Audit function established in line ministries in accordance with internationa l good practice  
3. Increased effectiveness of Access to Information Law 

71. 
Support will be provided through the forthcoming programmatic series of development 
policy loans and through technical assistance on governance, fiscal consolidation and subsidy 
targeting.  In coordination with the IMF, USAID, and JICA, the Bank has focused on building the 
technical capacity of the Ministry of Finance and the General Budget Department to formulate and 
implement appropriate fiscal policies and medium-term expenditure frameworks (MTEFs) and to increase 
efficiency in public expenditure management.  The Bank will continue to help improve budget 
management, including through better alignment of policy decisions with budget preparation .  Going 
forward, given the strong presence of USAID in the PFM arena and the extensive analysis recently 
completed on public expenditures across a range of sectors, the Bank’s contribution will focus on the 
revenues side of public finance through a fiscal consolidation study and a review of public expenditures in 
the energy/electricity sector.  Through a Governance Reform TA additional support could be provided to 
assist the Government in increasing fiscal transparency by extending the presentation of the budget to 
include a fuller discussion of the risks and assumptions behind budget projections.  The DPL series will 
support improved transparency and accountability including through strengthening the effectiveness of 
the Anti Corruption Commission.  In this connection, support will focus on the development of a 
regulatory an institutional framework that is effective and responds to the requirements stipulated in the 
United Nations Convention against Corruption (UNCAC), including those relating to application of the 
Anti-Corruption Law.  The DPL also supports better access to information, and the establishment of a 
modern Internal Audit function in line ministries.   Finally, with a view to reducing the fiscal burden of 
consumer subsidies while at the same time better serving the poorest segments of the population, the 
Bank is providing technical assistance that analyzes the poverty impacts and policy implications of 
changes in subsidy regimes (cash subsidies and tax exemptions) and is examining options for improved 
targeting mechanisms.    

22 

 
 
 
 
72. 
Public sector reform can be an important factor in increasing the efficiency of public service 
delivery and can also facilitate greater Government accountability.  Towards this end, a key objective 
of the Government’s EDP is to enhance Government’s efficiency and effectiveness and empower it to use 
transparency and accountability tools as well as evaluation mechanisms.  The Bank has provided some 
advice and technical assistance with regard to streamlining the Government structure, setting up 
performance-based management of human resources, and improving service delivery and stands ready to 
support the Government’s recently adopted Public Sector Reform strategy at the appropriate time.  The 
Bank could also support the national e-Government strategy which, if well implemented, would allow 
significant savings to the administration, better services to citizens, better decision making, and a more 
transparent and accountable administration to citizens and investors.  An Institutional Development Fund 
grant will be used to support service delivery improvements in the recently established Ombudsman 
Office which will allow for more efficient resolution of administrative complaints against public sector 
entities.  A regional TA program on public sector complaints mechanisms will provide capacity building 
to the Complaints Hotline of the Ministry of Public Sector Development with the aim of collecting and 
analyzing data related to complaints in order to better understand the demand side of services and to 
prioritize services for reform.  Discussions are ongoing with the Department of Lands and Survey 
regarding the establishment of a proper legal and institutional framework for public land management and 
the introduction of a one-stop shop for land transactions.  The Bank stands ready to engage with other 
agencies that are seeking to improve the effectiveness of their service delivery.  Finally, in the area of 
procurement, the Bank can provide assistance in the implementation of the new procurement law that it 
helped develop in line with international best practice.14  IFC has started an advisory services program 
with the Companies Controller Department and Jordan Securities Commission to provide support in 
corporate governance targeted at listed companies and SMEs. 

Pillar II:  Strengthen the Foundations for Sustainable Growth with a Focus on Competitiveness 

73. 
Sustained high growth is necessary for fiscal stability and job creation.  To strengthen 
Jordan’s foundation for inclusive growth, the CPS gives attention to priority infrastructure (energy, 
environment, water, and transport); the business environment; and education and skills development. 
Strategic capital investments and further efficiency gains are needed to address supply constraints to 
growth in water, energy and transport.  This will require greater collaboration with the private sector to 
finance infrastructure projects, a well developed framework for Public-Private Partnerships, the 
identification of economically viable projects, as well as a healthy investment climate.  The World Bank 
Group is well positioned to support the Government in these areas through technical assistance, IFC 
advisory services, and investments (from both IBRD and MIGA) to attract private sector participation in 
infrastructure funding and management.  IFC will provide long term financing and equity investment to 
private sectors in these sectors.   Another key ingredient for private sector-led growth, especially growth 
that is high value-added, is skilled human resources.  The Bank is undertaking a Development Policy 
Review (DPR) which analyzes Jordan’s key growth and competitiveness challenges and outlines policy 
options to address them.  Initial findings point to the need to build open and productive partnerships 
between the private and public sectors in policy formulation and implementation; to further trade 
integration and market diversification; to promote innovation; and to invest in high value-added industries 
where Jordan has latent comparative advantage in order to help Jordan upgrade to a higher middle income 
country and to create quality jobs for young men and women.  

14 This work emerged from the OECD-DAC self assessment carried out by the Government-appointed task force and responded 
to Jordan’s desire to gain accession to the World Trade Organization’s Agreement on Government Procurement.

II.1:  Support selected priority infrastructure 

74. 
The WBG will initially support two results areas—energy/transport and environment/waste 
management—based on the intensity of the current engagement in these sectors .  IFC in particular 
will support private sector participation in renewal energy.  The WBG engagement in these areas will be 
assessed at the CPS mid-term review and might be expanded to include additional areas and activities. 

Results area II.1:  Support selected priority infrastructure (energy, transport) 

Government objectives (EDP):  Secure energy supply and diversify energy sources; Increase the share 
of renewable energy resources in the total energy mix; Provide safe, effective  and economic 
transportation services which preserve the environment  
CPS outcomes:  
1. New electricity generation capacity developed to meet growing demand  
2. Scale-up in implementation of renewable energy and energy efficiency activities 
3. Efficient transport and logistics services supported by removing key infrastructure bottlenecks 

75. 
Energy: The Government seeks to diversify energy sources and increase the share of 
renewable resources in energy generation.  Recent disruptions in the gas pipeline from Egypt have 
highlighted the need for reliable sources of gas to avoid shortages and large price increases.  In addition to 
technical assistance, the Bank can provide financial support for a private sector investment in a gas supply 
facility.  The Bank will also support an increase in electricity generation capacity through Partial Risk 
Guarantees for the Third and Fourth Independent Power Project, slated for late FY12.  The Bank will 
continue to support the Green Growth agenda through two GEF Trust Funds, namely on Wind Power and 
on Energy Efficiency.  It might also consider supporting the development of concentrated solar power 
(CSP).  A new transmission line would be needed for connecting new solar and wind power plants and for 
enhancing the prospects of regional electricity integration between Mashreq countries and Europe. The 
transmission project may be eligible for concessional financing from the Clean Technology Fund. The 
Government is in the process of launching a feasibility study, financed by a grant from the EU 
Neighborhood Investment Fund, for the project.  Finally, the oil sector reform, including the rehabilitation 
and expansion of the sole oil refinery, is now expected to move forward following some delays in the past 
few years. The Bank group could provide technical assistance on developing downstream petroleum 
sector regulations and building capacity in the line ministry.  IFC is currently engaged in supporting the 
energy sector, especially by exploring possibilities of financing wind and solar projects in the pipeline. 
The Corporation could also play a role in supporting the development of LNG for electricity generation.  
Finally, IFC will look for investment opportunities that support clean technology and energy efficiency 
with private equity funds and some of IFC’s clients in Jordan.  MIGA is actively looking to support 
power sector projects through the provision of political risk guarantees. 

76. 
Transport:  The WBG is already involved in improving transport in Amman; going 
forward the Bank and IFC will also support Jordan’s drive to enhance its role as a regional trade 
and transport hub by developing cost-effective multimodal transport and logistics systems.  The 
Bank is currently co-financing (with EIB and the Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development) the 
Amman Development Corridor Project (ADCP), which will reduce the cost of transit traffic, and alleviate 
congestion.  Once completed and supported by other public urban transport measures, this project will 
help reduce CO2 emissions in Amman.15  In addition, several regional initiatives are underway as part of 
the Arab World Initiative, including preparation of a Regional Cross-Border Trade Facilitation and 
Infrastructure project for Mashreq countries which aims to improve transport infrastructure and services, 
harmonize customs, and create more efficient logistics chains.  In this context, the WBG is also providing 

15 Jordan recently signed the Emissions Reduction Purchase Agreement (ERPA) through which the Bank, as Trustee of the 
Carbon Fund for ERPA, will purchase about 300,000 tCO2e during the period 2012-2014.

technical assistance to Jordan to assess the feasibility of a national railway network connecting Jor dan to 
its immediate neighbors and beyond.  In this context, the Technical Assistance Facility as well as the 
public and private window of the joint World Bank, IFC and Islamic Development Bank (IsDB) Arab 
Fund for Financing Infrastructure (AFFI) might be relevant for Jordan. 

Results area II.1.2:  Support selected priority infrastructure (environment/waste management) 

Government objectives (EDP):  Manage solid waste in a comprehensive, effective and environmentally 
friendly manner; Sustainable protection and management of the environment; Curb climatic change; 
Protect ecosystems and biodiversity  
CPS outcomes:  
1. Better urban environment within Greater Amman region 
2. Increased contribution of Jordan to the climate change mitigation agenda 
3. Better conservation and harnessing of values from natural ecosystems 

77. 
Environmental Quality and Green Growth:  The Bank is supporting the improvement of 
environmental quality in Jordan, which has been a pioneer in environmental management in the 
region.  The Amman Solid Waste Management Project is helping strengthen the operational, financial, 
and environmental performance of Municipal Solid Waste Management in Amman.  This project includes 
finance for using landfill gas for power generation while mitigating green house gases.  As a future 
engagement, the Bank could support the Greater Amman Municipality (GAM) in modernizing their 
Municipal Solid Waste Management (MSWM) systems in line with the findings of the ongoing MSWM 
Strategy Planning study.  IFC will help GAM bring private sector participation to its energy efficiency, 
renewable energy, transport, and waste management programs.  The Bank will support the Amman Green 
Growth Program to improve the urban environment within the Greater Amman Region and to promote 
low-carbon investments in urban services, particularly through the mobilization of a grant under the 
Bank-managed Carbon Asset Development Facility.  Because this is a multi-faceted process that will take 
some time to fully materialize, it is not possible to define outcomes for the CPS period at this stage. 

78. 
Climate Change:  The WBG will coordinate with other donors to provide technical—and, if 
needed, financial—support to help the Government mitigate the impact of and/or adapt to climate 
change.   TA is planned in transport (public transport system), energy (wind and CSP), water (demand 
management and water productivity), and urban forestry, and for developing climate -friendly regulations 
and incentive systems for existing and new buildings.  TA will help position Jordan for climate-change-
related concessional finance.  The Ozone Depleting Substance Phase-out Project, an instrument of the 
Montreal Protocol, will continue to support Jordan’s climate-change-related agenda.  The Integrated 
Ecosystem Management in the Jordan Rift Valley project (supported by GEF) seeks to integrate climate 
impacts into conservation planning and the management of protected areas as well as the Badia 
Ecosystems and Livelihoods project (GEF).  Through grant-based technical assistance, the Bank is 
assisting Jordan in the process of defining and prioritizing its nationally appropriate mitigation actions 
(NAMAs, and will also help the Government assess options for embedding a low-carbon approach into 
development planning, prioritizing selected NAMAs ,and giving specific attention to the innovative use 
of financial instruments and to public-private partnerships.  Further, in accordance with the Governance 
Framework of the Partnership of Market Readiness (PMR), Jordan was confirmed as one of the 15 
Implementing Country Participants of the PMR.  This program will provide technical assistance over five 
years, aiming to provide a platform for technical discussions, South-South exchange, and collective 
innovation on new market instruments.   

79. Water:  The Bank has recently been invited to renew the dialogue with Government and 
stands ready to collaborate with other donors active in the sector, including USAID, KfW, AFD, 
JICA and the European Investment Bank.  The Bank is working on a Technical Assistance Program that 
includes several activities.  It is currently managing a multi-donor trust fund to prepare the feasibility and 

25 

 
 
 
 
 
environmental impact studies for the Red Sea/Dead Sea Water Conveyor.  The Bank has agreed with the 
Government on a small program of irrigation water productivity in the Jordan Valley.  In addition, several 
regional GEF grants are being prepared to support wastewater reuse and the use of quantitative and 
spatially based decision making tools in the water sector.  As part of IFC’s Water Resources Group 
Initiative, the Corporation has provided analytical work to develop an investment plan for narrowing the 
water demand-supply gap and will support the implementation of this plan.  MIGA will look to support 
further waste water projects, building on its support to the Samara waste water treatment facility signed in 
FY06. 

80. 
In all three areas of energy, transport and water, the Government is evaluating potential 
strategic investments, including through major development projects such as the Red-Dead Sea 
Desalination Project, the Nuclear Energy Project, and the National Railways Project.  The Bank 
Group can provide selective support through a range of instruments, including technical assistance (to 
assess technical feasibility, fiscal impact, and optimal financing arrangements), access to the TA 
component of the AFFI, as well as IBRD and MIGA guarantees to attract private participation.  IFC 
offers financing and facilitation of private participation in infrastructure with an emphasis on projects that 
have large and long-term financing needs and on clients who have regional expansion plans.  As such, it 
is playing a key role in supporting most of the strategic projects in Jordan and is well positioned to 
mobilize financing for a number of projects in power, ports (Aqaba Port relocation projects), and 
chemicals (phosphate).  IFC is already engaged with the sponsors of each of these projects.   

II.2:  Improve the business environment to enhance competitiveness and attract investments 

81. 
The WBG is supporting Jordan’s private sector development through technical assistance 
and through IFC investments and advisory services.  The Bank has worked closely with the Executive 
Privatization Commission to build a suitable legal environment to regulate PPPs and is supporting the 
development of a legal framework for insolvency.  IFC is supporting PPPs through advisory services, 
helping to develop the financial market and mobilizing financial resources for project finance.  MIGA is 
actively looking to support FDI in the country, including through support to PPPs. 

Results area II.2:  Improve business environment 

Government objectives (EDP):  Improve and develop the business environment and promote its 
competitiveness;  Empower new, small and medium sized enterprises and build their capacities; 
Encourage the private sector to enter into partnerships to undertake major development projects  
CPS outcomes:  
1. Streamlined regulatory environment and more equitable enforcement of rules 
2. SME financing facilitated through support to legal and institutional reforms 
3. Suitable legal environment to regulate PPPs 

82. 
Going forward the Bank Group will focus on the enabling business environment, sector 
competitiveness, SME financing and the framework for PPPs.  The IFC will pursue dialogue on 
improved access to finance and building the risk management capacity of credit institutions to better 
engage with micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (SME Credit Guarantee Scheme).  The Bank’s 
programmatic series of development policy loans will support SMEs’ access to finance, improving the 
licensing procedures for new firms, and supporting the development of PPP by-laws in line with 
international best practice.  IFC will assist in harmonizing the Government’s PPP strategy with the new 
law.  This work will complement that of other donors such as AFD and USAID who are also supporting 
the implementation of a PPP framework and the financing of PPP projects.  The WBG will prepare a 
competitiveness and private sector assessment (CPSA), provide related technical assistance and support 
the Government in using the results to develop a competitiveness and innovation strategy to move up the 

26 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
value chain, diversify the economy, and expand exports.  The CPSA will have an SME focus and will 
examine those sectors that are most likely to generate employment for young Jordanians .  As part of the 
process, the Bank Group will ensure the participation of women in the public-private dialogue around 
competitiveness challenges and will encourage their greater participation in the private sector, both as 
entrepreneurs and as workers.      

83. With regard to MSME finance much work has been done with the support of the WBG.  
IFC has led the effort over the last four years to improve the business and regulatory environments for 
access to finance.  It supported efforts by the Government and financial regulators to develop the leasing 
sector, establish a credit information law, develop the secured lending framework, and strengthen the 
insolvency policies and regulations.  IFC will continue supporting access to finance in Jordan through 
investments in the financial and banking sectors and advisory services as well as supporting Micro-
finance institutions.  In addition, the Bank has undertaken a survey of MSMEs with a view to 
understanding key constraints from the firms’ point of view (including labor market, exporting 
constraints, access to finance, etc.).  The analysis of this data will help develop a roadmap for MSMEs.  
The WBG TA for MSME finance, a joint effort with IFC, DfID and the EIB, can provide support for: (i) 
policy and legal reforms; (ii) capacity building and advisory services to financial institutions; and (iii) 
capacity building for MSMEs.  The WBG’s work on MSMEs is complemented by the work of AFD, EU, 
the Islamic Development Bank, USAID, the US Overseas Private Investment Corporation which are 
providing loan guarantees, grants and advisory support to MSMEs and clients of the Jordan Enterprise 
Development Cooperation.  Finally, an Institutional Development Fund grant will be used to strengthen 
the capacity of the Jordan Association for Certified Public Accountants (JACPA) to modernize its 
accounting and financial reporting architecture. A qualified audit profession and a strong financial 
reporting architecture are key pillars of sound corporate governance, required to build investor confidence 
and support a strong business climate.  

II.3:  Improve education quality, develop skills, and address labor market constraints 

84. 
The Government recognizes the need to improve the quality of education, including higher 
education and vocational training, in order to produce a labor pool that can match the needs of the 
private sector.  The Bank has long been supporting investments in education quality and reform, and 
under the CPS it will support the Government’s focus on enhancing skills and better addressing the needs 
of the private sector.  IFC is supporting improvements in post-secondary education quality and relevance 
through its Education for Employment (e4e) initiative (see Box 2 below). 

Results area II.3:   Improve skills and enhance employability 

Government objectives (EDP):  Enhance the knowledge-based economy and harmonize education 
outputs with labor market requirements; Provide a safe and sound educational environment; Reducing 
unemployment and increasing job opportunities; Raising women’s economic involvement in the labor 
market 
CPS outcomes:  
1. Learning environment improved 
2. Response to labor market and employers’ requirement of labor skills improved 
3. Enrollment in post-secondary technical training enhanced 
4. Effective operation and financial coverage by the Jordan Student Aid Fund 

85. 
The WBG will remain involved through the two ongoing investment projects (ERfKE II 
and the Employer-Driven Skills Development Project) as well as TA in higher education.  The 
Education Reform for a Knowledge Economy II project (ERfKE II) is helping to improve the quality of 
education and the learning environment in Jordan (including through school-based development, 
vocational education, improvement of the physical learning environment, availability of learning 

27 

 
 
 
 
 
 
resources and materials, early childhood education, and special education).  ERfKE II is combining 
system-wide investments in education quality with targeted investments in remote and underprivileged 
areas, notably construction and renovation of kindergartens and construction, extension and rehabilitation 
of schools.  ERfKE II is also supporting a Gender Unit within the Policy Planning and Strategic 
Department of the Ministry of Education in order to prioritize data availability and evidence -based 
decision making concerning the education of girls and women.  The Employer-Driven Skills 
Development Project (EDSDP) is addressing employment, technical and vocational education, and 
training reform.  EDSDP focuses on reforming governance, program development and financing of the 
Vocational Training Corporation (VTC) which essentially serves students at risk of exclusion.  Innovative 
and employer-driven programs are succeeding in attracting more youth and in ensuring their transition 
into the labor market.  TA in higher education supports the creation of a community college system that 
produces graduates with skills in high demand by the labor market, and is developing student aid 
programs that combine financial need with merit.  Both of these efforts facilitate access to education by 
less fortunate populations, and the community college component addresses in particular the needs of 
women, as female enrollment in these schools is high.  In addition, TA is being provided for the 
development of the Government’s National Employment Strategy which aims to increase labor 
participation in Jordan ant to create more and better jobs.   

86. 
The Bank Group is also supporting a number of regional education initiatives with Jordan 
as a focal country.  The Queen Rania Teacher Academy has been selected as the host institution for the 
Regional Program on Teacher Policies in the context of the Arab Regional Agenda fo r Improving 
Education Quality, a program initially financed by a Development Grant Facility grant.  In addition, the 
National Center for Human Resources Development is the host to the Regional Initiative for Education 
Policy Analysis, a Bank-supported program financed with an IDF and with the support of the Islamic 
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (ISESCO).  Jordan is one of the first pilot countries that 
will take part in IFC’s Education for Employment (e4e) for Youth in the Arab World Initiative (Box 2).  
A report on the challenges and opportunities of e4e in Jordan has been completed, and the findings will be 
disseminated to all stakeholders in Jordan.  Early business development work has also taken place, and 
IFC is at an early stage of identifying investment opportunities in the vocational training areas. 

87. 
In response to the difficulties facing women in Jordan’s labor market, the Bank is working 
with the Government on interventions to improve gender equality and female labor market 
participation.  A pilot initiative under the patronage of Her Majesty Queen Rania al-Abdullah aims to 
increase female labor force participation through:  (i) job vouchers that provide an incentive for firms to 
hire new female graduates; and (ii) training for women in interpersonal and soft skills that employers 
identify as constraints.  Studying the employment status of participants one year after the start of the 
program will improve understanding of the barriers to women’s employment and help the Government 
develop policy measures that promote women’s participation in the labor market.  A follow-up activity 
could involve designing a program to match the skills of female job candidates to the needs of firms.  
Consistent with the recent commitment of the Bank’s MENA region, a Gender Assessment will be 
undertaken over the course of the CPS period, and the Bank will work together with Government to 
develop a Gender Action Plan to address the impediments that stand in the way of women’s economic 
empowerment in Jordan.  The Gender Assessment, tailored to the Jordanian context, will analyze 
obstacles for increased female participation in the labor force.  This analysis will be informed by the 
results of the Young Women Graduate Employment Pilot, by a new Youth and Inclusion Poverty and 
Social Impact analysis, which will examine the impact of labor laws on employment outcomes for young 
men and women, and by an assessment of the impact of the new Social Security Law on employment 
opportunities for women.  In addition, the Development Policy Review and the Competitiveness and 
Private Sector Assessment will use gender-disaggregated data in assessing the impact of policies on jobs 
and growth.  Looking ahead, outcomes developed in the context of the Gender Action Plan could be 
considered for inclusion in the CPS at the time of the mid-term review. 

28 

 
 
 
BOX 2:  IFC’S EDUCATION FOR EMPLOYMENT (E4E) FOR YOUTH IN THE ARAB 
WORLD 

This initiative is a critical component of IFC’s response strategy in the MENA region to address the 
concerns of unemployment, especially of youth and women. IFC and IsDB are partnering in this initiative 
with a view to providing Arab youth with the skills that are relevant to the marketplace. The overall 
objective is to: (i) catalyze increased private sector investment; and (ii) help government stakeholders, 
private sector employers, civil society, and the education sector work together to improve the quality and 
relevance of the skills students take into the workforce. With an improved skills set, it is expected that 
students in the Arab World will become more employable, which in turn will help reduce unemployment 
and increase productivity levels in private sector firms. IFC, working with its partners, will invest and 
serve as a catalyst, convener, and implementer of projects. 

The e4e initiative is in its initial stages of implementation, with a dedicated team identified and parti ally 
deployed in the region.  Diagnostic needs assessments have been completed in Jordan and Tunisia, and 
other countries in MENA will follow over the coming months. Early assessments in Jordan have 
highlighted areas of engagement for IFC’s investment and advisory services, and the e4e team is currently 
exploring investment opportunities in the vocational training area. The initiative will complement the 
ongoing work of the World Bank on the role of policy and labor market reforms to enhance education 
quality, and will include strong partnerships with the Bank, regional partners, and donors, among others.  

Pillar III:  Enhance Inclusion through Social Protection and Local Development 

Results area III.1:   Social protection 

Government objectives (EDP):  Expand the base of social services, provide infrastructure including 
appropriate housing and focus on poverty pockets; Provide an effective social safety net system for the 
poor and social welfare services in line with best international practices; Improve targeting mechanisms 
for beneficiaries of programs and projects to combat poverty ; Expand umbrella of health insurance 
CPS outcomes:  
1. Adopt improved targeting mechanism by the National Aid Fund that reaches higher number of the poor  
2. Better access to and quality of social care services 
3. Expanded access to Social Security Coverage 

88. 
Through the ongoing reform of social safety nets and social security, the Government has 
taken key steps to improve its targeting systems and increase coverage of pensions and health 
insurance.  The WBG will support efforts to better target social assistance to the neediest while 
simultaneously improving access to and quality of social care services and improving health insurance 
coverage.  Building on the past four years of programmatic TA for the development of new social security 
reforms and legislation, the Bank will support the Social Secur ity Corporation (SSC) in implementation 
of the new Social Security Law which includes coverage extension, unemployment insurance, and 
maternity benefits.  A qualitative study will analyze the likely impact of the new Jordan Social Security 
Law on employment opportunities for woman.  The Bank will continue supporting the National Aid Fund 
renewal, which includes enhancements in the targeting mechanism and provides a system for timely and 
adequate support to poor households that would likely be affected by reforms such as subsidy removals.  
Support is also being sought through a Japan Social Development Fund (JSDF) grant for integrated social 
services for vulnerable groups.  An IDF grant will support Government in measuring the impact of 
national policies and strategies on gender equality, including the development of a gender disaggregated 
website at DOS and manuals on gender-based indicators for monitoring and evaluation.  Another 
potential area of engagement is the Arab World Initiative for Food Security, a source of concessional 

29 

 
 
 
 
 
 
financing that could, once secured, minimize the impact of high food prices on the livelihoods of poor 
urban and rural residents in Arab countries.  

89. 
Policy advice and TA will be provided for the introduction of health insurance to Social 
Security Corporation (SSC) beneficiaries.  The Bank will assist the Government to develop and 
implement a policy framework for reforming the health financing system and expanding health insurance 
to the whole population through the programmatic social insurance TA.  IFC will work to identify viable 
investment opportunities that will enable existing health providers to grow and attract south-south 
investments.   

Results area III.2:   Pursue local development and address poverty pockets 

Government objectives (EDP):   Promote local development to achieve a high level of developmental 
balance between governorates, protect the middle class, reduce poverty and reduce unemployment ;  
Promote tourism and preserve cultural heritage 
CPS outcomes:  
1.Enhanced operational performance and project implementation practices in municipalities other than 
Amman 
2.Improved local development in four historically and culturally important cities—Jerash, Karak, Madaba, 
Salt, and Ajloun—through increased tourism activities 
3. Development of a National Poverty Reduction Strategy with a comprehensive action plan and 
implementation arrangements. 

90. 
The Government recognizes the need to strengthen capacity at the local level to assume 
greater responsibilities for administration and service delivery and to expand services to unreached 
populations.  The Bank will help the Government build on the momentum of the ongoing Regional and 
Local Development Project and expand the successful performance-based block grant system to target 
infrastructure interventions to municipalities according to their needs and abilities.  A Cities Alliance trust 
fund grant will further support municipalities to develop their municipal strategies .  In addition, the Bank 
stands ready to assist the Government in developing a strategy to help local communities exploit local 
endowments, especially in the tourism sector, thereby creating economic opportunities and encouraging 
shared sustainable growth across the country.  The Bank also stands ready to advise on local development 
efforts with a focus on increasing local participation in decision making and implementation, as well as 
on enhancing the capacity of sub-national institutions to plan, implement, and manage their own 
development programs.  In addition, the Bank will support the Government in developing an urban 
heritage and tourism development program for the historic areas of two secondary cities, Irbid and 
Tafileh, with a view to helping local communities exploit local endowments and creating economic 
opportunities in less advantaged regions of the country.  Given the involvement of AFD and the EU in 
local development, the Bank will coordinate closely to ensure complementarity of efforts in this area.  

91. With a view to addressing poverty pockets throughout the country, the Government has 
initiated the preparation of a National Poverty Reduction Strategy that will draw on a number of 
Bank inputs over the coming months and years.  The focus of the strategy is:  (i) a deeper 
understanding of who the poor and vulnerable populations are; (ii) why they are poor, sources of their 
vulnerability and why some populations in Jordan have remained in poverty for some time; (iii) 
recommendations for policies and programs to reduce poverty and vulnerability; and (iv) the drawing up 
of an action plan including an institutional set up and mechanisms for the next 3 -5 years.  The Bank will 
assist with the formulation of the overall strategy and will provide capacity building to the Department of 
Statistics, the Ministry of Planning and International Cooperation and the Ministry of Social Development 
in the tools of poverty and social protection analysis.  The strategy will build upon ongoing work by the 
Bank including:   (i) an analysis of the relationship between growth, poverty and inequality (part of the 
Development Policy Review) which will examine the extent to which growth has been inclusive in 

30 

 
 
 
 
 
Jordan, both over time and across socioeconomic groups; (ii) renewal of the National Aid Fund (NAF) 
which includes the adoption of a new targeting mechanism that will enhance the poverty impact of the 
NAF; (iii) analysis of consumption subsidies which examines the poverty impacts and policy implications 
of changes in subsidy regimes and assesses options for improved targeting mechanisms; and (iv) the 
National Employment Strategy which analyzes one of the main sources of vulnerability of the Jordanian 
population – that of unemployment and underemployment.  IFC will place greater emphasis on increasing 
its investment and advisory engagements in poorer regions of Jordan, and also try to better target youth 
and women in its access to finance and education interventions. 

92. 
In addition through the use of several small grants, the Bank will support the provision of 
key legal and economic services to vulnerable groups.  Specifically, a grant from the State and Peace 
Building Fund will finance the provision of legal information, counseling and representation to displaced 
Iraqis and Palestinians, and a grant from the Japan Social Development Fund on Community-Driven 
Development of Legal Aid Services will expand the provision of these services to reach poor Jordanians 
living outside of Amman, covering three governorates in the North and three in the South.  The services 
will be delivered directly by CSOs in coordination with the Ministry of Justice and will include capacity 
building for these CSOs.  A GEF grant (Badia Ecosystems and Livelihoods Project) will help sustain 
ecosystem services and livelihoods in four poverty pockets in the Badia through diversification of 
community income sources and through the sustainable use of rangeland resources. 

Financing of the Program 

93. 
Jordan can access an indicative IBRD envelope of $500m - $650m for the four-year period 
of the CPS, depending on the sequencing and mix of instruments (DPLs vs. investment loans vs. 
guarantees), IBRD lending capacity, demand from the authorities , and performance under the CPS.  The 
proposed lending program for FY12-15 will be adapted to respond to country demand, country 
circumstances, and the Bank’s ability to service such demand in the context of its comparative advantage. 
In addition to this indicative lending program, and with a view to promoting regional cooperation and the 
use of new financing arrangements, IBRD could also provide financing to Jordan for regional projects 
supported by the Arab Financing Facility for Infrastructure or by the Micro, Small, and Medium 
Enterprise Facility.  During the CPS period FY12-15, IFC will continue investing in the private sector 
with an indicative program of $100-150 million per year.

V. CONSULTATION 

94. 
To help prepare this CPS the World Bank Group held three rounds of consultations with a 
range of development partners and stakeholders about the WBG’s programs in Jordan.  The first 
round was at the launch of the CPS process in February 2010, the second, more extensive, took place in 
October 2010, and the final round was conducted with the new Government in March 2011.  The 
Government’s main interlocutor has been the Minister of Planning and International Cooperation, but line 
ministries were also very involved.  The consultations also included:  (i) the banking and private sector; 
(ii) non-Governmental organizations (NGOs) and grassroots organizations; (iii) academicians and 
representatives of the civil society at large; and (iv) development partners.  The dialogue with these 
stakeholders helped shape the main pillars of the CPS and provided the Bank team with suggestions for 
interventions that could support the Government’s reform agenda.16  

95. 
The discussions covered a variety of sectors, including education, employability, health, 
local/rural development, governance, fiscal management, and access to finance.  They provided a critical 
but constructive view directly from people affected by these programs.  The issues raised covered almost 
all aspects of the Bank’s engagement in Jordan and confirmed the new strategic thrust: 

 Representatives from civil society pointed to the quality of education and employability, especially in 
rural areas, as main concerns.  Low labor force participation of women was also highlighted. The 
mismatch between labor market needs and the skills of graduates produced by educational institutions 
was seen to be exacerbating unemployment, especially among the youth.  Education in rural areas 
was said to suffer from weak infrastructure and poor quality of delivery.  
 Need to focus the quality and management of education to improve employability and to 
address underlying constraints for women  

 Representatives from civil society stressed that the high level of urbanization has deepened the 
disparity between rural and urban development, contributing to increased poverty and unemployment, 
especially among women and youth.  Participating NGOs agreed that micro-finance as well as 
Government support to job-creating businesses, instead of cash transfers, may provide better 
incentives for social development not only in rural areas but also in urban centers.  The participants 
also expressed concerns about insufficiency of public services in health.  Severe water shortages and 
inferior electricity infrastructure were seen to discourage agricultural and industrial projects. 
 Need to address regional disparities by supporting local economic development and SMEs to 
support local job creation 

 For private sector and banking sector representatives a key problem was the absence of dialogue 
between the public and private sectors to produce viable solutions to economic and financial 
problems.  Private sector representatives stressed that the limitations placed by commercial banks on 
credit to the private sector were constraining the growth of the private sector.  Limited access to 
finance by MSMEs was seen as a severe constraint.  Banks were reluctant to offer credit because of a 
general lack of confidence in the sustainability of small industries.  
 Need for better dialogue between the private and public sector, and better access to finance, in 
particular for MSMEs 

16 For more details on the discussions, see Annex 4. 

33 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                 
 Representatives noted that Jordan’s slow recovery from the financial and economic crisis was due to 
its dependence on foreign aid.  They believed Jordan’s fiscal management to be inefficient and that 
donor aid should be allocated to capital investments rather than used to pay public sector salaries. 
They saw the Government as determined to shrink the deficit without examining the impact on the 
economy. 
 Need for expenditure rationalization, then expenditure cuts 

 Private sector representatives expressed their dissatisfaction with the competence of university 
graduates.  Jordan’s once renowned human capital was seen to be dwindling, so that the Gulf 
countries that used to attract many Jordanian graduates would in ten years look elsewhere for 
employees.  For lack of competent Jordanian graduates, Jordan’s own private sector employers were 
said to be resorting to foreign labor.  Strengthening vocational education and training could help 
reduce unemployment rates in the long run.  
 Need to address the quality of education both at the university and school level, and 
encourage vocational training 

 NGO and private sector representatives saw corporate governance as a mirror of the public 
administration and a serious concern.  They felt that hiring decisions should be based on experience 
and skills, not nepotism. 
 Need to strengthen transparency and accountability in the public administration  

96. 
Jordan, through the Ministry of Planning and International Cooperation, takes the lead in 
the dialogue with its development partners, but there is room for more coordination among donors . 
To this end, the Bank Group regularly consults and coordinates with partners and seeks to complement 
the activities they support.  For a detailed overview of the activities of Jordan’s development partners, 
including areas of collaboration with the WBG, see Annex 3.  

VI. MONITORING AND EVALUATION 

97. 
The CPS results framework is anchored in the Government’s Executive Development 
Program for 2011-13 and derives from the Government’s development objectives while showing the 
contribution of the Bank’s program to the achievement of selected indicators.  

98. 
The CPS results framework is a live document.  The CPS provides the overall framework 
which responds to Government’s demand for a long-term flexible partnership developed around strategic 
priorities.  The current framework reflects activities through FY13 in which Government has officially 
requested the Bank Group to take part.  It is expected that activities may be added in response to 
Government demand as we move through the CPS period.  The Bank will update the results framework as 
the program evolves and as agreements are made on assistance going forward.  Specifically, the CPS 
progress report will take stock of progress in two years, and the results framework will be updated 
accordingly at that time.  

VII. MANAGING RISKS 

99. 
Risks to the successful implementation of the Government’s agenda stem largely from the 
increasing social pressures in the country and the associated demands for the Government to spend 
more on subsidies and wages.  Recent demands for voice and accountability as well as for improved 
service delivery and more jobs are likely to continue, challenging the Government’s ability to move ahead 
with its fiscal consolidation plans.  Increased recurrent expenditures and universal subsidies strain the 

34 

 
 
 
 
 
 
budget and leave little room for capital expenditures that are needed for growth and development and 
little flexibility to cope with exogenous shocks.  In addition, frequent Cabinet reshuffles could slow down 
reform efforts and limit the Government’s capacity to implement long-term structural reforms.  The 
Government is addressing this risk in part by introducing a series of political reforms.  In addition, the 
Government is looking to move away from universal subsidies in favor of targeted programs that will 
serve the neediest. 

100. 
Jordan is highly vulnerable to external shocks, due to its heavy dependence on imported oil, 
its reliance on foreign aid to address the fiscal deficit, and its dependence on FDI and remittances 
for growth.  Added to this is the fact that the country’s debt stock has grown and there is limited fiscal 
space to counteract shocks or to invest in growth-enhancing capital.  The WBG will support the 
Government’s efforts to sustain fiscal stability and build adequate fiscal space through better 
prioritization of investment and increasing efficiency of expenditures, and will work with the Government 
to increase Jordan’s productivity and competitiveness with a view to broadening the sources of growth.  

101. 
Jordan’s national security and economic wellbeing are affected by regional political 
developments.  As has been demonstrated by the impact on Jordan’s growth of the increased perception 
of risk in the region due to the revolutions in neighboring countries and by the impact of the multiple 
disruptions in the Egypt gas supply, Jordan is vulnerable to the political developments in the region.  In 
addition, repercussions caused by the Middle East conflict and geopolitical events (such as the situation in 
Iraq, developments in the Palestinian territories, and the threat of terrorism in the region) continue to 
challenge the authorities to maintain an ―oasis of stability.‖    

102. 
Jordan’s heavy reliance on imported energy and food (98 percent of the country’s energy 
and 90 percent of its food supply is imported) make it vulnerable to increases in international 
commodity prices.  As long as food and fuel prices continue to rise, this risk will also persist.  Wh ile in 
the past the adverse impact of high commodity prices on the current account deficit has been mitigated by 
cyclically higher FDI and sustained remittances from the Gulf, this has not been the case in 2011, and 
Jordan has had to rely heavily on foreign grants .  The reliability of foreign aid flows is affected by 
downturns in the global economy as well as by changes in geopolitics, and as such , dependence on this 
source of financing is inherently risky.  With the support of the World Bank Group, the Government will 
work to minimize this dependence by building up fiscal and setting the stage for endogenous, private -
sector led growth.

I. 

INTRODUCTION 

1. 
On May 4, 2006 the Board of Executive Directors discussed the Country Assistance 
Strategy (CAS) for Jordan, for the Fiscal Years 06-10 (Report No. 35665-JO). This Country 
Assistance Strategy Completion Report (CASCR) takes stock of the effectiveness of the FY06-FY10 
Bank assistance to Jordan and draws lessons for the preparation of the forthcoming Country Partnership 
Strategy (CPS). The methodology used in conducting this assessment was comprised of three main 
elements: (i) close consultations and interviews with project team leaders, team members and clients; (ii) 
review of Implementation Completion Reports (ICRs), Implementation Status Reports (ISRs) and Aide 
Memoires; and (iii) examination of the alignment of the CAS and the following adjustments in the 
progress report with the country development objectives as well as progress made toward these long -term 
objectives.  It examines the political and economic context over the CAS implementation period, assesses 
implementation progress and impact of analytical support, draws lessons learned, and recommends ways 
to effectively assist Jordan to address its development challenges in the next country strategy. 

II. 

JORDAN’s DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVES: NATIONAL AGENDA  

A. Recent Political, Social and Economic Developments 

2. 
Jordan is a lower middle income country (LMIC) with strong ownership of its development 
strategy.  Over the last years, the Government has established a solid track record as one of the 
champions of fiscal and structural reforms in many areas in the Middle East and North Africa region 
(MENA). 

3. 
In July and November 2007, municipal and parliamentary elections were held in Jordan 
respectively, and a new Prime Minister and Government were appointed .  In the ensuing two years, 
Prime Minister Dahabi reiterated Jordan’s long-term development goal of transforming the country from 
a lower-middle income country into a modern knowledge-based economy with higher value-added and 
increased productivity and employment, and underscored the GoJ’s commitment to implementing 
economic policies to reduce the budget deficit and maintain a stable macroeconomic framework. 

4. 
Although Jordan enjoys overall political stability, it remains embedded in a highly volatile 
regional environment.  Its national security remains closely linked to regional stability. During the CAS 
implementation period, sporadic domestic tensions caused by geopolitical events (such as increased 
tension in Iraq until late 2007 and the Gaza offensive in 2008) often affected Jordan’s national security. 

5. 
The global economic slowdown created challenges for Jordan during the CAS period. 
Jordan was exposed to major external economic shocks such as the fuel and food crisis as well as the 
global economic recession.  The combined impact of higher global oil prices, lower private capital 

44 

 
 
 
 
 
inflows and lower overall regional growth reduced Jordan’s economic growth from 7.6% in 2008 to only 
2.3% in 2009.  In addition, the fiscal deficit rose to 8.5% of GDP (2009). 

6. 
On November 23 2009, King Abdullah II dissolved Parliament two years ahead of schedule. 
On December 9, 2009, a new Government was announced and Samir Al-Rifai, previously Chief of the 
Royal Court, was appointed as new Prime Minister through a letter of designation by King Abdullah. The 
Parliamentary elections were held on November 9, 2010. 

B. Development Objectives 

7. 
Becoming a modern knowledge-based economy with higher value added and increased 
productivity and employment is at the core of Jordan’s long-term development vision. This vision 
implies a bold modernization of the country’s economic, institutional and political infrastructure, based 
on improving its business environment, increasing the efficiency of the public sector and enhancing its 
human capital, and ameliorating poverty.  The Government acknowledges that this requires a modern and 
efficient administration, and a more open and participatory policy. 

8. 
Jordan’s National Agenda (JNA) was prepared in 2005 by a Steering Committee comprised 
of representatives from the government, civil society, private sector, Parliament, and media. The 
National Agenda is an ambitious 10-year development agenda that aims to transform Jordan from a 
lower-middle income country into a modern knowledge-based economy with higher value added, 
increased productivity and employment, and improved quality of life for Jordanians. The National 
Agenda distinguished three consecutive phases: (i) first phase (2007-12) focuses primarily on improving 
the business environment, creating employment opportunities, and building the skills needed for the 
knowledge economy; (ii) second phase (2013-17) focuses on strengthening the industrial base and 
preparing the ground for the development of high value-added sectors in the knowledge economy; and 
(iii) final phase (2018-onward) would complete Jordan’s transformation into a world class competitor in 
the global knowledge economy.  

9. 
The GoJ has prepared a new Executive Development Plan (EDP) to underpin the National 
Agenda.  The EDP, presented on February 17, 2010 by the new Cabinet at the request of His Majesty 
King Abdullah II, includes seven strategic pillars, namely: (i) reforming the public sector and increasing 
accountability through tools for measuring and benchmarking government performance; (ii) encouraging 
civil and political participation; (iii) improving the investment and business climate; (iv) improving 
workforce skills to meet the needs of the labor market; (v) supporting economic growth through the 
development of strategic infrastructure projects; (vi) expanding the middle class base and protecting low 
income groups; and (vii) improving the quality and delivery of public services. 

III. CAS RELEVANCE 

10. 
The Bank Group Assistance program is aligned with the JNA, focusing on the GoJ’s 
overarching objectives of productive jobs creation.  In agreement with the GoJ, the CAS focused on 
the following four priority areas: (1) strengthening the investment environment and building human 
resources for a value-added, skill-intensive and knowledge-based economy; (2) supporting local 
development through increased access to services and economic opportunities; (3) reforming social 
protection and expanding inclusion; and (4) restructuring public expenditures and supporting public sector 
reform. 

11. 
The assessment of the CAS program at mid-term and more recently showed high relevance 
of the program with regard to Jordan’s development priorities. The CAS program was found to be 

45 

 
 
broadly relevant, evidenced by a near complete execution of the entire program, with the exception of the 
public sector reform program.  This program was considered to be too ambitious for the prevailing reality 
of the political economy.  As such, the CAS results matrix was revised, and the indicators associated with 
public sector reform were removed, narrowing the focus of the fourth pillar on pub lic expenditure 
management. In addition, in the context of the global economic crisis, the principle of increased flexibility 
to adapt to changing country needs was emphasized. 

12. 
During the CAS period, Jordan was subject to several external shocks including high oil 
and food prices and the global economic downturn.   Oil prices more than doubled during the first half 
of the CAS period, and this hit Jordan particularly heavily as it imports more than 95% of its energy 
needs. This increase had an adverse impact on the wellbeing of poor and vulnerable households and 
broader economic and social implications as households cut back on consumption.  The GoJ’s policy of 
gradual elimination of subsidies over the previous three years was coupled with a compensation package 
that directed a portion of the budgetary savings to finance better targeted expenditures that benefit low- 
and middle-income households.  The combination of sharp increases in both oil and food prices in 2008, 
however, led to a massive increase in the coverage of the compensation package in 2008.  The GoJ 
acknowledged that the budgetary compensation measures were an imprecise method of compensating for 
price increases and could eliminate the recent hard-achieved fiscal gains.  

13 . 

The global financial crisis led the Government to request an emergency ―Recovery under 
Global Uncertainty‖ Development Policy Loan (DPL) in the amount of $300 million from the Bank 
to address the widening fiscal gap.  The Government was keen to avoid crowding out the private sector 
in the domestic market by diversifying its financing instruments, which in recent years had relied mostly 
on the domestic market.  The DPL’s objective was ―to support the implementation of the Government’s 
medium-term development program in the context of the current global financial crisis and economic 
slow-down.‖ I t was developed as a comprehensive operation underpinned by a long standing technical 
dialogue with the GoJ on key development challenges in the following four areas: (i) reducing fiscal 
vulnerability; (ii) strengthening the financial sector; (iii) improving the business climate; and (iv) 
facilitating access of vulnerable groups to a more effective and fiscally sustainable social protection 
system.  

14. 
The breadth and quality of existent analytical work contributed to the relevance of the 
Emergency Development Policy Loan.  A series of new programmatic ESW programs supported the 
Government in assessing the impact of the global financial crisis on Jordan.  These included the ongoing 
programmatic assistance to public financial management; the work on the Medium Term Expenditure 
Framework (with emphasis on budget planning reforms); the assessment of the global financial crisis 
impact (which examine means of transmission of the financial crisis to the Jordanian private sector and 
real economy); the study on price shocks and subsidy reforms which confirmed the need for fiscal 
consolidation to reduce fiscal imbalances and strengthen the effectiveness and efficiency of public 
spending.  A Bank/IMF team also prepared a financial sector assessment program update. 

15. 
The global financial turmoil resulted in mounting pressures on Jordan’s financial system 
and social protection measures. The GoJ moved quickly to form a high-level inter-ministerial 
committee to track relevant economic information and identify emerging macroeconomic imbalances in a 
timely fashion.  A slowdown in the Jordanian economy has undoubtedly had an impact on low income 
households in the country.  The social safety net reforms were, therefore, highly relevant and urgent so 
that their targeting is made sharper and leakages are restricted.  The Bank supported these reforms 
through a programmatic ESW program on social insurance and pensions which identified key areas of 
reforms and provided assistance to the Government. On the basis of this broad analysis, a social 
protection component was determined and included in the DPL.  

46 

 
 
16. 
In sum, the Bank was already working on the necessary reforms such as social insurance 
and safety nets, business environment, financial sector and fiscal adjustments and was able to 
provide advice in a timely and programmatic manner.  However, the crisis also had somewhat of a 
diverting impact on the implementation of the CAS such as: (i) slower implementation of reforms and 
legislation regarding social insurance, (ii) fiscal distress for the government which resulted in financing 
caps for projects and a cancellation of the Higher Education Reform for the Knowledge Economy 
(HERfKE) project.  Despite the cancellation of the loan, the GoJ is committed to implement the 
objectives of HERfKE. 

IV. 

PROGRESS ON CAS PILLARS AND BANK GROUP PERFORMANCE 

17. 
The CAS Results Framework provides a structure for assessing the contribution of the 
Bank Group (see Annex 1).  Implementation experience yielded a number of lessons which will be 
reflected in the forthcoming CPS. The four clusters were underpinned by 14 outcomes and 26 milestone 
indicators which in some cases were found overly ambitious.  They have has been corrected at mid-term 
to allow for proper measurement of the CAS results during the second half of the CAS period. 

18. 
The four clusters remain consistent with the government’s priorities and relevant in guiding 
the Bank’s program choices.  Annex 1 presents a results matrix which includes outcomes and 
milestones for each of the four CAS clusters.  Several of the indicators were revised at the time of the 
CASPR to take into account changes in country circumstances as well as in the Bank’s program over the 
CAS period. In particular, the outcomes associated with the public sector reform were removed. Although 
the title of the fourth pillar was narrowed to ―Restructuring Public Expenditures,‖ the results presented 
under this pillar cover the Bank’s engagement in public financial management more broadly. The CASCR 
builds on the revised results matrix of the CASPR and has been further revised to reflect changed 
outcome indicators associated with sections 1 and 4 of cluster 2 on supporting local development. These 
areas were revised to reflect: (i) recent project revisions of the Cultural Heritage, Tourism and Urban 
Development Project and (ii) restructuring of the Regional and Local Development Project as of March 
2010. Additional outcomes related to the Emergency DPL which were not in the original CAS envelope 
are also presented under the respective pillars. 

19. 
Jordan made significant progress in many areas during the CAS period. In particular in 
education and public expenditure management, the original targets are likely to be fully achieved during 
the CAS period. In social safety nets, investment climate, and local development, the tools to achieve the 
CAS outcomes are in place, and, if efforts are sustained, the objectives are likely to be fully achieved 
early in the next CPS period.  As such, the targets in this area have been modified to better align with the 
timetable of reforms. In social insurance and energy, the Bank’s involvement has been deeper than 
anticipated as the GoJ requested that the Bank provide continued technical assistance to the 
implementation of reforms, particularly in light of the energy and food price shocks and the global 
financial and economic crisis. The implementation of reforms in the areas: (i) fiscal adjustment, (ii) 
financial sector policies, (iii) business environment and (iv) social insurance and social safety net were in 
particular supported and accelerated through the Recovery under Global Uncertainty Development 
Emergency Policy Loan.  

20. 
In public sector reform, progress has been slower than anticipated when the CAS was first 
formulated. The Bank’s planned assistance in this area did not materialize during the CAS period and the 
relevant outcome indicators have been modified accordingly during the mid-term review. However, given 
the recent new emphasis on public sector reform in Jordan, the Bank is re -engaging in these areas under 
the new CPS.

A. Areas of Bank Group Involvement through Implementation of the CAS 

21. 
Cluster 1—Strengthening the investment environment and building human resources for a 
value-added, skill-intensive and knowledge-based economy has shown good progress in many areas. 
The Bank has worked successfully with the GoJ in this area. The objectives have been largely achieved, 
although progress in the area of business environment - while significant - has been slower than planned 
in the CAS. 

With the support of the Bank Group, the GoJ has embarked on an investment climate reform 
process.  In 2008, the GoJ put together a Committee to coordinate and facilitate faster improvement in the 
business environment headed by the Ministry of Planning and International Cooperation.  The Committee 
devised a strategy to improve the business environment in Jordan on the basis of the framework provided 
by the Doing Business (DB) report, and key areas of concern underlined by the 2007 Investment Climate 
Survey. Despite these continuing reforms, Jordan’s Doing Business 2011 ranking dropped to 111 from 
107 in 2010.  The GoJ has adopted a more strategic approach to capital formation, combining efforts to 
improve the investment climate and attract/encourage private business investment. It is wo rth noting that

a new Temporary Income Tax Law became effective as of January 1, 2010. With the adoption of this 
coherent strategy the government has achieved the CAS milestone. However, in order to be successfully 
executed it would need to ensure a consistent implementation, which, if achieved, can yield significant 
improvements in the two coming years in areas covered by the key Doing Business Indicators (starting a 
business, licensing, property registration, investor protection, etc.). 

22. 
During the CAS period, the GoJ launched its Public Private Partnership program and 
promoted Public Private Partnerships (PPPs) for selected infrastructure investments.  In 2008, the PPP 
regulation was implemented.  During the CAS period, two PPPs were completed: the Assamra Water 
Treatment Plant/BOT (2007) and the expansion of the Queen Alia International Airport (QAIA) BOT 
2009..PPPs are expected to play a strong key role in Jordan by creating employment opportunities, and 
providing essential and quality services to the general public and to businesses, thereby fostering local 
economic growth and reducing poverty. The privatization trust fund from USAID managed by the Bank 
was critical in supporting Jordan's major privatization transactions while continuing to provide techni cal 
advice and oversight to the Executive Privatization Commission (EPC). Parallel to the aforementioned 
PPP program initiative, in the electric -power sector the government successfully privatized the 
Central Electricity Generating Company in 2007 and two formerly state -owned electricity 
distribution companies in 2008. In addition, Jordan successfully launched the independent power 
producer program, resulting in the development of two new privately -owned power plants to date 
(the Amman East power project wa s awarded in 2006 and the Al Qatrana power project in 2008). 
The WB provided a partial risk guarantee to support private financing of the Amman East Power 
project. The focus of Bank assistance has shifted away from the privatization of State Owned 
Enterprises (which is now almost fully completed) to the development of a regulatory and institutional 
framework for PPPs and a pipeline of medium-size PPPs for needed infrastructure and services. Jordan is 
now transitioning into promotion and identification of public-private partnerships. In addition to larger 
PPPs (e.g. power sector), the GoJ/EPC is now pursuing medium-sized PPPs in transport, housing and 
education. The WB supported the process with a policy note on guarantees for debt financing for PPPs. A 
new PPP law has also been developed to reflect lessons learned.  

23. 
In order to strengthen Government’s capacity to further utilize PPPs and as part of a wider 
public sector restructuring plan, the Government intends to merge EPC, and integrate its resources 
within the Projects Administration (PA) at the Prime Ministry in the course of 2011. The PA’s principal 
mandate is providing institutional support to the execution of vital mega projects, strategic projects and 
PPPs and will be focused on ensuring delivery of vital projects for the government in partnership with 
line ministries and agencies. The PA will also be responsible for promoting and identifying public -private 
partnerships, as well as taking ownership for the PPP Law that will be presented to Parliament in 2011.  
Serving as Government’s PPP expertise hub, the PA will elevate the importance of PPPs as a vehicle to 
implement Government projects and services. This will also expedite the decision making processes 
regarding approving PPP projects by Council of Ministers.  

24. 
In private sector development, the GoJ reduced the minimum capital required to establish a 
limited liability company from the equivalent of 795% of GDP per capita in 2007 to 19.9% in 2009 —to 
encourage businesses to enter the formal sector. Jordan made it easier to start a business and pay taxes, 
extended the construction permit one-stop shop for medium-size projects, lowered property transfer taxes, 
implemented major court reforms, and speed up trade. The DPL supported in particular the Business 
Environment reforms by measures that reduced the entry and operating costs and improved the tax 
administration: (i) A new Company Law was approved where the minimum capital requirements for 
limited liability’s companies was abolished by eliminating the requirement for depositing 50 percent of 
the capital of limited liability’s companies in commercial banks. As an outcome minimum capital 
requirement for limited liability’s companies is 0 percent of GNI in 2010 versus 24.2 percent in 2008. 
(despite slowdown in economic activity, the number of companies registered in the first seven months of 

49 

 
2010 increased by 1.03 percent compared to the same period in 2009). Moreover, the DPL also facilitated 
improvements of the registration and contract enforcement process: the registration through the 
Companies Control Directorate of the Ministry and Trade was facilitated through four additional one -
stop-shops outside Amman offering a full range of services19; the Ministry of Justice has instituted fully 
operational specialized commercial sections at eight courts outside Greater Amman to improve the 
resolution of business disputes. (ii) The Cabinet has approved a draft Bankruptcy and Insolvency Law 
thereby defining the priority order of secured creditors in bankruptcy cases. (iii) The DPL supported also 
improvements of tax system: An on-line filing system for tax returns and electronic payment systems has 
been initiated and is being used by at least 10 percent of corporate tax payers in November 2010 vs. 1.5 
percent in 2009. 

25. 
There are indications that the GoJ continues to streamline its business registration 
processes; a new commercial code is being considered; a Unified Tax Code is in draft; and there are 
significant reform efforts underway in the area of trading across borders. Jordan continues to be interested 
in unifying customs regulations to be consistent with the region. With assistance from the Bank Group, 
Jordan is focusing on addressing some of the remaining constraints, including streamlining civil 
proceedings; reforming taxation and tax administration and developing the capacity of insolvency 
administrators.  IFC is supporting the GoJ in implementing a comprehensive licensing and inspection 
reform program to simplify the inspection processes in selected ministries and to reduce the time and cost 
burden that inspections place on businesses. 

26. 
Beyond the original outcomes of the CAS, the DPL contributed to strengthen the financial 
sector and to broaden the access to finance: (i) The Central Bank (CBJ) adopted a plan for more 
consolidated supervision providing a comprehensive view of potential risks to the banking sector. The 
Central Bank of Jordan has completed a first run of stress testing on the aggregate banking sector balance 
sheet and has issued guidelines on stress testing to individual banks; a first run stress testing by each 
individual bank has been completed; (ii) The cabinet approved the Credit Bureau Law that improves SME 
access to finance by facilitating bank lending through making credit information of borrowers available 
and alleviating restrictions on use of collaterals. 

27. 
The IFC program contributed significantly to the investment and private sector 
development pillar. The IFC played a key role in supporting the rehabilitation and expansion of the 
Queen Alia International Airport PPP project.  IFC was the lead advisor to the GoJ in structuring and 
implementing the project leading to the award of a 25-year concession to the Aéroports de Paris 
Consortium with a bid of 54.58% of gross revenue to the GoJ, the highest revenue-sharing percentage 
achieved in the world for similar projects. This transaction represented the largest private sector 
investment in Jordan to-date of approximately $1 billion, and is expected to generate $3.7 billion 
(approximately $148 million annually) in concession fees to the GoJ and to realize fiscal savings of 
approximately $1.7 billion. In FY08 IFC invested $127 million in the project (both equity and debt), 
along with $100 million co-financing from the Islamic Development Bank (IsDB).  

28. 
IFC also supported the privatization of Royal Jordanian Airlines by conducting the pre -
feasibility study that led to the initial public offering (IPO) in November 2007, in which the GoJ 
sold 71% of the airline to the private sector.  In addition, IFC is currently the lead advisor to the GoJ 
for the implementation of Amman Ring Road PPP concession to help mobilize private sector investment 
for the 118-kilometer expressway—the first toll road project in Jordan.  In addition to the infrastructure 

19 By 2010 start-ups of businesses was eased by offering a single reception service for company registration at the company 
registrar. In 2008, One-stop-shops limited the time to start business to fall from 18 to 14 days and business start -up procedures 
from 11 to 10.  

50 

 
                                                 
sector, IFC has been actively supporting private sector involvement in transport and warehousing with a 
total of $168 million committed during the CAS period. Over the last 4 years, IFC’s portfolio in Jordan 
increased significantly from $50 Million to around $400 Million today, an indication of an improved 
environment for private sector participation in the economy. 

29. 
Through an integrated investment and advisory program, IFC has helped develop the 
financial sector by increasing access to finance to underserved groups.  During the CAS period, IFC 
has: (i) promoted the leasing sector by strengthening the legislative regime and clarifying the tax 
treatment of leasing; (ii) supported the preparation of the corporate governance code for banks in Jordan; 
(iii) supported the microfinance sector, especially targeting women; (iv) stimulated the housing finance 
market through an investment in a new mortgage finance company, support for the Jordan Mortgage 
Refinance Company, and advisory services to support new legislation for the sector; and (v) assisted the 
GoJ in drafting the new legislation that will regulate the sharing of credit information. Through its Global 
Trade Finance Program, IFC also supported the capacity of three commercial banks to deliver trade 
financing through partial or full guarantees covering payment risks on banks in the emerging markets for 
trade related transactions. Moreover, a $50 million IFC equity investment (IFC’s largest equity 
investment in the banking sector in Jordan) in Capital Bank supports the bank in its small and medium 
enterprise and housing finance strategy, promoting better corporate governance standards, and helps with 
future regional expansion. 

 

30. 
During the period of this CAS, major progress has been achieved in reforming the 
institutional and market structure of the energy sector. The GoJ’s energy strategy (updated in 2007) 
calls for further private sector participation in the energy sector, enhancing energy security through 
diversification of energy imports and strengthened regional trade of gas and electricity, development of 
renewable energy, promotion of energy efficiency, and development of domestic energy resources, 
including oil shale.  
In the electricity sector, the strategy calls for the development of additional gas -based 
independent power producer (IPP) contracts. The Bank Group has provided a Partial Risk 
Guarantee (PRG) and a MIGA Guarantee ($45 million for the PRG and $69.8 million for the 
MIGA guarantee) for the construction of the Amman East power plant and demonstrated 
success of these instruments in attracting private sector investment in infrastructure that could 
further catalyze their use. 
 The adoption of the oil subsidy reform, a milestone of the CAS, has been achieved. 
Subsidies for oil products were gradually removed and completed in February 2008, except 
for LPG (Liquefied Petroleum Gas) resulting in a significant increase in the prices of oil 
products. Associated costs in real income for low and middle income groups have been 
compensated by a variety of measures including tax reductions and exemptions, various cash 
transfers and a substantial increase in public sector pay.  
 A new energy strategy has been developed, emphasizing the need to develop renewable 
energy and an institutional framework for the promotion of renewable energy and energy 
efficiency. A new Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Law was officially ratified in 
February 2010. The Bank is providing support to the sub-sector in the form of two GEFs—
one project supporting wind power generation and one for energy efficiency to initiate the 
implementation of the new framework. Under the Energy TA, three analytical documents 
were prepared to support Government in its policy decisions: (1) Jordan Power Sector: 
Medium Term Issues and Options; (2) Energy Efficiency Framework for Jordan; and (3) 
Concentrated Solar Power for Jordan: Economic Impacts on the Power System..Follow up 
AAA activities are now underway, including (i) a TA on smart electricity grid application for 
Jordan, and (ii) a capacity building TA on carbon capture and storage for Jordan.  
 The Bank also launched a study to assess the potential for regional energy integration in the 
Mashreq, funded by ESMAP and the Arab World Initiative. A Clean Technology Fund (CTF) 

51 

 
 

soft loan was also approved in December 2009 to establish a clean technology investment 
plan and enhance the capacity for Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) including strengthening 
the regional interconnection of electricity grids in five countries, including Jordan.  
IFC is supporting the implementation of the energy sector PPP program through Advisory 
Services and direct financing and mobilization of resources to projects in generation, 
distribution, and renewables. In FY09, IFC invested $40 million in Kingdom Electricity 
Company (KEC), the preferred bidder for the acquisition of the GoJ stake in Electricity 
Distribution Company (EDC). Jordan is the only country in the MENA region to fully 
privatize the electricity distribution sector. By mobilizing intra-regional investments from the 
Gulf, the IFC project hopes to demonstrate the feasibility of electricity distribution 
privatization and attractiveness to foreign investment in the region. The project also provided 
much needed one-off revenues to the government and has relieved the fiscal burden of 
continued investments in power distribution by the public sector. 

31. 
The Go’s commitment to transform the education system into one that can produce 
graduates with skills necessary to meet the needs of a knowledge economy is still strong.  At the pre-
tertiary level, the Go’s implementation of a 10-year reform program–Education Reform for the 
Knowledge Economy (ERfKE) for which the Bank is the lead donor–has already yielded positive results 
and targets have been fully achieved: 

 Education Reform for the Knowledge Economy (ERfKE): Within the ERfKE program, the 
Bank financed the development and implementation of a student outcomes-based curriculum 
for all subjects and grades, an assessment framework for student achievement that measures 
authentic, performance-based achievement; the development and piloting of supplemental e-
learning materials in core subject areas; the connection of more than 2,000 schools to high -
speed learning network; the upgrade of 466 schools, and the construction of 40 new schools 
to provide access to safe and adequate school facilities to basic and secondary students. Net 
enrolment rates in the 8th grade increased considerably during the ERfKE I project period. 
The 2007 Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study results show strong 
improvements in Jordan’s ranking in science and math in both regional and international 
science rankings. 2008 National Assessment for the Knowledge Economy results showed 
improvements in all grades tested as compared to 2006 scores.20 With the support of the 
second phase of ERfKE, the ERfKE II project, the GoJ has adopted a whole school approach 
that engages teachers, principals, administrators, parents and communities in the formulation 
and implementation of school development initiatives focused on the achievement of quality 
learning outcomes. In FY11, IFC made a $13 million equity participation in EdFund (a UAE 
based Fund) to support their acquisition of Al-Alamiyah Schools in Amman. The project will 
help increase the quality of private schooling in Jordan. 

 

In higher education, with technical support from the Bank and a PHRD Grant, the GoJ 
prepared a comprehensive higher education policy framework to serve as the foundation for 
the reform to be supported by the proposed Bank-financed Higher Education Reform for the 
Knowledge Economy project (HERfKE) (FY09). In July 2009, the government decided not 
to borrow, and to finance the project from its own resources. As a result of the financial crisis 
on the government’s approach to debt management, the national debt committee decided to 
significantly curtail borrowing as well as general investment from the budget. Under the 
guidance of the framework prepared for the Higher Education reform project, the GoJ 
nevertheless moved forward on drafting key legislation to kick-start the reform program. 

20 2008 NAFKE results show improvements in scores compared to 2006 baseline in all grades tested (5th, 9 th, 11th) and in 
following subjects per grade tested: (i) 5th: reading; (ii) 9th: math, science and reading; and (iii) 11th: math and reading. 

52 

 
 
                                                 
Three laws were subsequently passed by the extra-ordinary Parliament session in July 2009, 
these laws are: (i) the Higher Education Law; (ii) the Public Universities Law; and (iii) the 
Higher Education Accreditation Law. While the enacting of the laws mentioned sends a 
strong signal to all stakeholders as to the seriousness of GoJ to reform the sector, much work 
still needs to be done to address the state of affairs at the community colleges and to address 
the rising inequity in the system. Despite the decision by the GoJ not to borrow from the 
Bank for the higher education, the Bank’s support in preparing the project and providing 
technical assistance resulted in the development of a comprehensive Higher Education Policy 
Framework which was endorsed by the Council of Ministers (CoM) in March 2009. CoM has 
endorsed, in October 2010, with direct technical assistance from the World Bank, a new 
model for student aid (the Jordan Student Aid Bank – JSAB) based on four pillars: Access, 
Equity, Student Responsibility, and Fiscal Sustainability. An Inter-Ministerial Policy 
Committee has been established and tasked with developing the institutional arrangements for 
the JSAB by end January 2011, for the JSAB to be operational for the 2011/2012 school year. 
The Bank will continue to provide Higher Education reform advice in the form of a multi-
year Technical Assistance in response to the Government of Jordan’s request for assistance to 
support implementation of current and proposed reforms for a better managed Community 
College system and the development of robust student aid programs. 

 

IFC’s use of financial intermediaries helped to increase access to quality education. In 
FY08, IFC committed its first investment in the education sector in Jordan. This project 
consists of a student loan program for university students, whereby the IFC will share risk of 
up to $5 million on a portfolio of student loans that will originate and managed by the Cairo 
Amman Bank, a private commercial bank. 

 With the approval of the Employer Driven Skills Development Project, the training 
sector gained momentum to undertake significant reforms, such as engaging employers in 
the training process, bridging the gaps in matching vacancies with job seekers and ensuring 
that workers and unemployed get access to education and training. The Cabinet has endorsed 
a new law setting up the T-VET council. The council secretariat was established but requires 
further support and capacity building. While a number of PPPs have already been signed with 
the hospitality service sector, telecommunications, pharmaceutical and automotive industries, 
progress in the E-TVET area has been slower and more complex than expected primarily due 
to the involvement of multiple stakeholders (Ministry of Labor, Ministries of Education & 
Higher Education, as well as the private sector).  

Cluster 2—Supporting local development through increased access to services and economic 
opportunities.  This cluster has shown progress in spite of a slow start-up. The results matrix was 
updated in the CAS Progress Report to reflect the slow start-up of the Regional and Local Development 
Project (RLDP) and to revise overly ambitious milestones and expectations. Therefore, new, more 
realistic indicators were added to report on the additional work undertaken with GAM. Since shifting to 
result-based budgeting in 2007, the Ministry of Municipal Affairs (MOMA) is taking a pro -active role in 
fostering local development and supporting municipalities in their efforts to increase access to services at 
the local level, with the support from the RLDP, (co-financed by the Agence Française de 
Développement- AFD), and the Cultural Heritage, Tourism, and Urban Development Project (CHTUD), 
both approved in FY07.  

32. 
In 2008, MOMA issued the 2008-15 Municipal Development Strategy, a strategic framework 
to guide the implementation of the municipal sector reform agenda whose implementation the RLDP is 
supporting. The GoJ is making progress towards an intergovernmental legal and regulatory framework 
that rationalizes and clarifies authorities and functional assignments among different tiers of government. 

53 

 
 
 
Beyond the strategic framework for local development, the government started the preparation for a 
regional and local development White Paper which will pave the ground for the intergovernmental 
framework. Leadership of the project was shifted from MoPIC to MOMA.  MOMA started to implement 
the Municipal ―Performance –Based Block Grant (PBBG)‖ system which was developed under the RLDP 
project, closely working with the municipalities to identify local priorities through a participatory system 
and to deliver a large number of municipal infrastructure.  

33. 
Under the RLDP, the GoJ made progress in providing better access to finance for sub-
national government and contributing to the development of sound municipal financial 
management systems and investment planning tools. It took steps to review the fiscal equalization 
transfer system for municipalities and is in the process of revising the current fiscal transfer formula. This 
fiscal equalization grant, together with the performance based block grant (PBBG) supported by RLDP, 
will assist in achieving a cumulative increase in additional resource transfers to municipalities. The first 
cycle of the PBBG has been completed. This supported a series of infrastructure projects in 72 
municipalities. Key outcomes of the cycle also include: improved municipal planning, management of 
investments, 
investment prioritization, strengthened procurement capacity and 
increased fiscal 
responsibility as several municipalities exceeded their required share of project financing. In the 
meantime, the second cycle has begun. This cycle will be competitive and eligible municipalities will 
compete to access financing.  

34. 
Building on a sector assessment by the Millennium Challenge Corporation, the RLDP has 
been launching the design of an integrated municipal finance management information system. 
MOMA also made progress towards the full disclosure of resource transfer tools, by publishing, together 
with MOF, a joint annual report on intergovernmental fiscal allocation in October 2009. 

35. The Greater Amman Municipality (GAM) presents an excellent example of decentralization 
working effectively in Jordan. Under the RLDP project, GAM is sharing its experience with other 
municipalities (e.g., Irbid and Salt) and is developing the capacity of the newly created Amman Institute 
to formally train and mentor at a national and regional level.  

36. 
Through the CAS instrument, GAM was provided with access to financing to support 
priority investments. GAM entered into an agreement with the Bank to purchase part of the Certified 
Emission Reduction amounting to 0.9 to 0.95 million tons of CO2 and obtained an accompanying 
investment loan to systematically address municipal solid waste management issues and to initiate steps 
towards integrated and efficient municipal solid waste management while mitigating negative 
environmental effects at both the local and global level. Both the carbon finance and the investment 
operations were approved for sub-national borrowing (lending to an institution with the guarantee of the 
government) for an amount of $25 million in FY09.  Owing to the success of these operations, GAM 
requested continuing collaboration with the Bank as a partner in the development and implementation of a 
City-Wide Clean Development Mechanism program.  This program (the Amman Green Growth Program) 
will target GAM priority investments in several municipal infrastructure and services and will make 
Amman the first city worldwide to develop such an approach. GAM is now being considered to join the 
Bank-managed Carbon Partnership Facility as a Seller. 

37. 
A number of activities at the sub-national level are underway with GAM: PPIAF financing 
was secured to carry out an analysis of PPP models for certain priority investments. The Bank has 
initiated TA to review the adequacy of GAM’s revenue and financing sources. This will also help to 
define requirements for a multi-year capital investment plan, and will help GAM access further grant 
funding from the Sub-national Technical Assistance Program (PPIAF-SNTA). The TA will also assist the 
GAM in building a business model for the City-Wide CDM program. Finally, dialogue is on-going on the 
possibility of using the joint Bank-IFC Sub-national Finance Window for GAM’s investment program. 

54 

 
Moreover, the Bank is currently providing technical and financial assistance to GAM, under the 
ongoing Amman Development Corridor projec t (ADCP) , to prepare the feasibility and design 
studies for a public urban transport project which would include Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) and 
could involve a PPP scheme. 

38. 
Jordan’s cultural heritage has benefited from project support. GoJ undertook works to 
restore cultural heritage assets and to improve overall quality of life in historic city cores. The urban 
renewal works were already launched in Madaba, Salt and Jerash. The work in Madaba is almost 
completed. The generation of local economic opportunities through cultural heritage assets initially faced 
some delays. With support of the CHTUP the operation manual for local economic development was 
produced. 

39. 
A country environmental analysis was prepared during the CAS. The Jordan country 
environmental analysis provided the framework for identifying and responding to Jordan’s environmental 
priorities. 

40. 
In 2008, the Bank began support to the communities hosting Iraqi guests21 with a Post-
Conflict Fund (PCF) grant in the amount of $1.7 million to the Save the Children alliance primarily 
in the education sector (kindergartens). The project will be closing in June 2011. It is designed under 
the umbrella of the ―Ta’leem‖ (learning) Regional Education Initiative which increases access to quality 
education for youth between the ages of 4-24. In Jordan, program activities are implemented in direct 
partnership with the Ministry of Education, adding to the World Bank support for the Education Reform 
process (ERfKE) and meeting critical needs in the emerging early childhood sector. Achievements to date 
include: (i) 1250 Iraqi children benefited from a scholarship scheme; (ii) 450 children benefited from 
education support classes; (iii) 60 teachers received capacity building on learning difficulties, inclusion, 
and protection; and (iv) 75 adolescents and youth received training on life skills.  

Cluster 3 — Reforming social protection and expanding inclusion. Significant progress has been 
achieved in this cluster, especially on the social security reforms. Reforms in the soc ial safety nets area, 
however, have been slower than expected. Both Safety nets and social inclusion (SI) were substantially 
supported through the DPL which included also SP components. The GoJ has developed specific 
strategies, policies, and action plans with support from the Bank in key areas, namely reforming the 
pension system, introducing unemployment insurance savings accounts, reforming health insurance, and 
modernizing the National Aid Fund (NAF) and expanding its safety nets.  

Expanded social insurance: The most important outcome of this cluster is the enactment of the new 
Social Insurance Law in March 2010. The law includes reforms related to the current pension system to 
make it financially sustainable, introduces maternity benefits, unemployment insurance, health insurance, 
and extends coverage to establishments of 5 or less employees.22  

41. 
In the pension reform area, the Bank assisted the Social Security Corporation (SSC) to 
design parametric reforms of the current system aimed at: (i) improving the sustainability of the SSC; 
(ii) introducing other benefits such as unemployment insurance, maternity benefits and health insurance; 
(iii) improving the administration of the SSC, and (iv) developing a regulatory framework for private 
pensions in Jordan. With Bank support, a new law that will serve as the basis for the new pension system 

21 There is currently a population of 500,000 Iraqi guests in Jordan, adding to the demand for services and economic 
opportunities. 
22 The new law extended the SCC umbrella to include housewives, linked pensions with the inflation rate and set salary ceili ng 
subject to SSC deduction oat JD 5,000. Groups of previously excluded workers in Jordan are now covered by social security. 
Employers and self-employed are incorporated at a compulsory basis, while stay-at-home women are covered on a voluntary 
basis. 

55 

 
                                                 
was approved in January 2008 by the Board of Directors of the SSC and the Cabinet. In end March 2010, 
the new law was enacted and implementation commenced. The outcomes of the SI components went 
beyond expectations. The new SI legislation includes various innovative and important reforms unlike 
many other countries in the region. In addition, the process followed by SCC was exemplary in seeking 
technical advice from various aspects, demonstrating high ownership of reforms, building its own 
technical capacity and launching a wide and massive information campaign on the reform. Major progress 
has been achieved in the social insurance sector with the support of the Bank’s multi -year programmatic 
ESW combined with the DPL thereby supporting the Jordanians in designing, preparing and pushing 
forward the reforms.  

42. 
The Bank is supporting the GoJ's aim to achieve universal health insurance and to increase 
coverage in a sustainable and equitable way in the coming years. The Bank prepared an assessment of 
the financial implications of possible reform scenarios which was discussed with stakeholders. The 
process to reach a consensus took longer than anticipated and slowed the project prepa ration. This 
outcome is partially achieved at least for SCC members who will now have health insurance coverage. 
Currently, approximately 50 percent of the population is covered by formal health insurance. 

43. 
An important achievement of the SI component under the DPL is the extension of the 
unemployment insurance program. The DPL supported a cabinet approval of a draft unemployment 
insurance program as part of the social security law which provides unemployment insurance benefits to 
all members of the SSC. As a result, all SCC members were covered by November 2010 versus 0 percent 
beginning 2009. On unemployment insurance, the Bank analyzed different alternatives, including the 
viability of an unemployment savings account option. Financial parameters and technical features of the 
unemployment insurance system were designed with Bank assistance and incorporated in the new draft 
pension law. In addition, implementation details were developed. The results matrix was slightly 
modified to reflect the additional work done at the request of the GoJ in unemployment insurance.  

44. 
In social safety nets, the GoJ with assistance from the Social Protection Enhancement 
Project (approved in FY08) is seeking to improve the targeting mechanism of the NAF and to 
increase its coverage. Although the project has advanced implementation in all aspects, it is too soon to 
assess the overall progress towards achieving this objective. At this stage the milestones are partially 
achieved. Under the project, the GoJ has taken steps to establish the database on poor and vulnerable 
populations as a key element in achieving better targeting, but progress has been slower than anticipated. 
With support of a DPL prior action, the coverage of the target poor population by NAF assistance 
increased from 20 percent in 2006 to 40 percent by November 2010 of those under NAF threshold.23 The 
NAF has initiated testing of a new targeting mechanism that is envisaged under the NAF Renewal Action 
Plan, including: (i) improved questionnaire finalized; (ii) database software developed; and (iii) data from 
at least 2,000 households out of planned 6,000 collected. In the meanwhile, NAF has recently completed 
the pilot for 6468 households to be screened using the Proxy Means Testing formula to ascertain their 
eligibility to receive NAF cash benefits. 24 However, a slowdown in the Jordanian economy that has 
resulted from the global economic downturn will undoubtedly have an impact on low income households. 
The ongoing social safety nets reform, supported by the project, is highly relevant and urgent so that their 
targeting is made sharper and leakages are restricted to increase coverage of poor people. The results 
matrix was modified because the original targets can only be achieved upon comple tion of the project, 
which will take place mid-way through the implementation of the next CPS.  

23 NAF, Ministry of Social Development 
24 Switching from the previous targeting mechanism (categorical) to a new mechanism (proxy-means testing) proved to be more 
difficult than expected since resistance to change was high. The PMT pilot results were presented to the Human Development 
Committee in the Prime Ministry and awaiting decision from the Committee (ISR Jordan Social Protection Enhancement 
Project).

45. 
The 2006 Household Income and Expenditure Survey estimated that poverty stood at 13% 
in 2006, with varying levels of poverty between governorates. Contrary to public perception, poverty 
in Jordan dropped between 2002 and 2006, but deep pockets of poverty persist. Poverty in Jordan is 
shallow with a large share of the population consuming at levels close to the national poverty line. The 
decline in poverty is explained by an increase in real expenditure especially among the poorest resulting 
from robust GDP growth and increasing remittances since 2000. In contrast, income levels remained 
stagnant over the same period. The Government has been providing cash transfers and various subsidies 
as part of its safety net, which reached its peak in 2008 at the time of international price shocks. Focusing 
on mechanisms that are systematically included in the budget, such as revising the National Aid Fund 
targeting, is more effective in protecting the poor and vulnerable. To this end, the Bank will continue to 
provide programmatic assistance in poverty monitoring and mapping, including developing a computable 
general equilibrium model; small area estimation; and improving the quality, timeliness and periodicity of 
wage and earnings data. 

Cluster 4—Restructuring Public Expenditures  

46. 
Bank interventions and the defined outcomes of cluster 4 are addressing primarily public 
financial management and the efficiency of public expenditures. The Bank supports GoJ with a 
substantial programmatic assistance in PFM since 2006. The ongoing work was complemented by the 
crisis-response DPL which was not foreseen in the CASPR of March 2009. As already mentioned in the 
CASPR and elaborated below, the support of the public sector program did not materialize. It was 
therefore considered to revise the theme of cluster 4 with a focus on PFM and the efficiency of public 
expenditures. 

47. 
The ongoing programmatic assistance in public financial management initiated in 2006 
under scored the need for further fiscal consolidation and more efficient public spending in Jordan. 
Since 2007 the Bank has assisted the GoJ with the introduction and implementation of the Medium Term 
Expenditure Framework (MTEF), with emphasis on strengthening the policy orientation of the budget 
planning reforms. The assessment of the global financial crisis impact, which examined mechanisms of 
transmission of the financial crisis to the Jordanian private sector and real economy, and the ongoing 
study on price shocks and subsidy reforms identified areas of fiscal vulnerability and selectively 
quantified the gains/losses of compensation policies, confirming the need for fiscal consolidation to 
reduce fiscal imbalances and strengthen the effectiveness and efficiency of public spending.25 

48. 
The main achievements of PFM reforms to support the authorities’ fiscal consolidation 
measures until 2010 include:26  
 
Introduction of a Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) in 2008, integrating the 
planning and budgeting processes, for which the Bank, together with other donors such as USAID 
and GTZ, provided programmatic technical assistance. It has continued to make good progress with 
the introduction of the MTEF and budget preparation reforms which to date have covered three 
budget preparation cycles. The budget planning horizon was now extended to three years with the 
inclusion of program level Forward Estimates (FEs) for two outer years. In introducing the MTEF, 
GBD decided to roll out FEs and performance indicators to all ministries/GUs, rather than starting 
with a number of pilot ministries. The approach has emphasized the central role of the MTEF in 
Jordan’s budget management reforms. FEs were introduced for ministries with the 2008 Budget s and 
for ministries and governmental units (GUs) with the 2009 Budget.

 

Improved Budget preparation and prioritization through MTEF: In both sector ministries and 
GBD, the MTEF is already considered to have brought about significant improvements to budge t 
preparation and negotiation. In most ministries, the MTEF resource ceilings have facilitated more 
realistic and better prioritized budget planning. In some ministries, such as Education and Health 
Care, MTEF already contributed to improvements in budget planning procedures that aim to ensure 
more explicit linkage between ministry strategic plans and budgets. The inclusion of budget 
performance indicators is similarly seen as a positive development that has emphasized the link 
between ministry strategic plans and their budgets. In GBD the reforms are regarded as having 
allowed progress towards a more strategic approach to budget negotiation in which policy 
considerations play a more significant role.  

 Adoption of a revised budget calendar providing more time for expenditure review and strategy 
analysis; The revised budget calendar now provides a clearer agenda for the roll out of the MTEF and 
budget planning reforms. The new calendar was introduced for the 2011 budget for the expenditure 
review and strategy analysis phase and involved Cabinet at four stages during budget preparation. The 
Jordan’s new development plan, the Executive Development Plan (EDP), is the country’s first plan 
whose priorities are directly linked to the budget.27 

 Deepening results-oriented budgeting (RoB) by further improving the definition of ministry and 
program level objectives and introducing performance indicators and targets into the budget 
documentation: These comprise outcome or high level output indicators for measuring progress 
against the strategic objectives of the ministry/GU, and output and activity indicators for monitoring 
program level performance which were aligned the government’s capital spending program and the 
Executive Development Program (EDP);  

 

 

Introducing a new macroeconomic forecasting model scheduled to be fully operational by mid -
11: This model strengthened the capacities for medium-term macroeconomic and fiscal analysis and 
forecasting in the MoF and tax authorities which has resulted in a more robust macro-fiscal 
framework within which budget planning takes place. 

Improved transparency of budget system: With collective assistance from Bank and USAID 
budgets were presented in a program format and included performance indicators and targets at level 
of Budget Institution and program since 2008. Moreover, narrative presentation of budgets at program 
level were developed and piloted with preparation of 2010 Budget and will be further rol led out with 
the 2011 Budget. In addition, a ―Budget in Brief‖ and a ―Citizen’s Budget‖ for the 2011 budget was 
prepared.  

 A number of broader PFM reforms have recently been put in action. These reforms include new 
GFS compliant budget classification and chart of accounts for state and independent institutions 
(introduced in 2009), installation of a Government Financial Management Information System 
(GFMIS, being piloted in selected ministries) which will be expanded to include budget preparation 
and paving the way for an integrated approach in improving PFM, and completion of a Treasury 
Single Account whose coverage is being extended to budget and trust accounts in commercial banks 
and transferring most government revenues in commercial banks to the TSA on a daily basis. When it 
becomes fully operational, the GFMIS will significantly improve data reliability and will enable more 
timely and accurate centralized accounts reconciliation. While the overall reform agenda has been 
ambitious, the approach has been pragmatic to better manage the complexity of these reforms. 

27 There were however difficulties in holding to the new budget calendar in the preparation of the 2011 budget related mainly to 
the need to ensure consistency with the 2011-13 EDP. Certain reforms such as the establishment of a commitment control system 
(CCS) were delayed. 

58 

 
                                                 
However, it must be recognized that it will take time to build depth in the process and bring about 
more fundamental changes in budget planning processes in ministries/Gus Reforms such as the 
GFMIS, the new chart of accounts (CoA), and the earlier submission date of the Budget to Parliament 
are critical to the successful roll out of the MTEF and budget planning reforms. 

49. 
The crisis-DPL supplemented the ongoing program on the fiscal reforms. It targeted 
Government’s challenges of (i) reducing the fiscal vulnerability by broadening tax base, and (ii) 
enhancing effectiveness of government expenditures and had immediate budget effects to mitigate 
negative fiscal effects. It contributed to reduce fiscal imbalances and to enhance the country’s 
macroeconomic stability which were demonstrated through the following results: (i) tax exemptions 
distorting relative prices were reduced, and a new framework for scrutinizing introduction of future 
preferential rates was initiated; (ii) fiscal consolidation plan, including completion of subsidy reform, was 
reinstituted (budget deficit excluding grants declined to $470 million in first half of 2010 compared to 
$884 million in first half of 2008). (iii).The Ministry of Finance adopted an enhanced budget calendar to 
strengthen the initial strategic phase of budget preparation, during which budget performance, strategies 
and priorities are reviewed and medium-term spending requirements evaluated. The calendar included 
Cabinet level consultations in the first quarter of each fiscal year on the key parameters and issues 
underlying the development of the MTEF based on a Budget Policies and Priorities Paper. These policy 
actions had immediate budget effects which helped the government in 2010 to weather the negative fiscal 
effects of the global crisis and supplemented the ongoing program. With a new series of programmatic 
DPLs under the new CPS, the WB will make use of its leverage to continue supporting the fiscal 
consolidation and growth efforts as well as other parts of its policy agenda.  

50. 
The quality of the WBs analytical work was a decisive determinant of the quality of the 
lending (DPO) and of the related policy dialogue on the crisis response. Due to the extensive 
analytical work that had been conducted prior to the DPL, the Bank team was able to prepare a DPL in 
less than six months. The preparation of the DPO built on a solid portfolio of ESWs, including an earlier 
public expenditure review, an Investment Climate Assessment, and insolvency and a Creditor Rights 
Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC). A series of targeted programmatic ESWs on 
the impact of the global financial crisis helped to advance the policy dialogue with Government and 
supported preparation of the DPL: (i) a Fiscal and Poverty Impact Study, (ii) Financial Sector assessment 
program update and (iii) Impact on the Real Economy &Private Sector Assessment. 

51. Progress on public sector reform has been uneven, but new interest in addressing sector 
challenges with World Bank support has emerged. The Public Sector Reform Capacity Building 
Project, which was supporting the development of capacity to carry out the reforms, was cancelled at the 
request of the GoJ in March 2008. The broader political environment in Jordan and internal differences 
within successive cabinets regarding the scope and content of the reforms to be supported by the Bank 
compromised the project's effectiveness. Of the original agenda articulated in the White Paper, progress 
has been made in monitoring key service delivery indicators in selected ministries. Other areas, ranging 
from reforms in pay and grading to improving meritocracy and human resources management to 
strengthening policy coordination and streamlining government, have witnessed limited progress. 
Progress has been registered within several ministries/public institutions using different tools such as the 
King Abdullah II Center for Excellence, which plays an innovative role in promoting excellence in 
service delivery by public sector institutions; and twinning projects with EU institutions which is proving 
effective in harmonizing Jordan’s institutional framework with the EU’s. Because of the lack of Bank 
involvement in this area, the Results Matrix has been revised and no longer includes the corresponding 
outcome indicators and milestones. In its new Executive Development Plan of February 2010, the GoJ 
committed to reform the public sector and expressed interest in pursuing public sector reform with World 
Bank support in the upcoming CPS. 

59 

 
52. In terms of governance, the GoJ has requested technical assistance in the pharmaceutical sector 
to define policy reforms and activities that will have a positive impact on availability and prices of 
pharmaceuticals in the public sector and promote equitable access to high quality medicines. The 
components of the TA program are: (i) the adoption of procurement guidelines and ensuring that these are 
effectively disseminated; (ii) assessment of key policy issues regarding pricing and regulation; and (iii) 
conducting meaningful discussions with all stakeholders and related parties.  

53. Although outside the core program, procurement reform has recently emerged as an area of 
engagement upon request of the GoJ. The World Bank team has been assessing the strength and 
weakness of the current public procurement system (2009-10). In line with the requirements of the GoJ, 
the establishment of two bodies are foreseen: (i) the Directory of Purchasing and Government Contracts – 
an operational central procurement , based on a merger of the General Supplies Department (GSD), the 
General Tenders Department (GTD), and the Joint Procurement Department (JPD) and (ii) the Higher 
Procurement Committee (Council) – assigned the tasks of dealing with complaints from bidders and 
conflict resolution, widely perceived as referring to settlement of contract implementation disputes. The 
most urgent priority in this area is to support the planned merging of the existing three procurement 
institutions and the establishment of the two new procurement bodies. One specific area of focus in this is 
to revise and complete the Legal Framework which consists of the preparation and submission of a 
consolidated Public Procurement Legislation (By-Law(s)) and the elaboration of consolidated regulations 
to support implementation of these By-Law(s), as well as standard bidding documents (including general 
conditions of contract) and supplementary instructions for various sectors of procurement. This area of 
engagement is expected to be highlighted in the forthcoming CPS currently under preparation. 

54. Cross-cutting dimensions. The CAS proposed to address two thematic/cross-cutting issues within 
four priority sectors.  

Environment  

 The Bank is also supporting Jordan in improving urban environment within the Greater Amman 
Municipality with focus on solid waste management. The ongoing Bank funded Solid Waste and 
Carbon Finance operation approved in September 2008 is supporting Amman City in addressing 
municipal solid waste issues, while initiating steps towards effects at both the local and global 
levels. It aims particularly at upgrading the current disposal practices while mitigating Green 
Gashouse and generating of green electricity at the existing landfill in Amman. The Government 
sees this operation as a model for other municipalities in Jordan to enhance their MSWM systems 
and the Ministry of Municipal Affairs expresses strong interest in applying such model 
throughout the country. 

 Some water-related issues were addressed in the Country Environment Analysis led by the Bank, 
assessing Jordan’s environmental agenda and 
the 
linkages between development and 
environmental impact with emphasis on water quality and transport. The CAS had envisaged 
different possible instruments to support the water sector. The GoJ is working to invest in non-
renewable sources with IFC support and engaged with USAID on the preparation of a water 
sector review to analyze the economic and fiscal costs and trade-offs of alternative policy options. 
IFC explored opportunities in the water sector under a design, build, operate and transfer contract 
that involved the extraction of water from the Disi Aquifer and the conveyance of water to the 
Greater Amman area..The project did, however, not come to fruition due to external factors. Due 
to the increasing pressure on natural resources, the Bank will possibly assist GoJ to in supporting 
efficiency of water management utilities under the new CPS under preparation.  

60 

 
 Under the Ozone Depleting Substances (ODS) Phase-out II project, Jordan exceeded its target by 
reducing its ODS importation of chlorofluorocarbon by 96% in 2006 compared to the baseline. 
Under the Conservation of Medicinal and Herbal Plants GEF Project, both in-situ and ex-situ 
activities in the project areas currently contribute to protect endangered species, including seed 
bank collection, and farmer communities are integrated in activities seeking to improve 
vegetation and combat land degradation. In addition to the two GEF Grants, and a third GEF 
Grant was approved to secure the ecological integrity of the Jordan Rift Valley by applying the 
principles of integrated ecosystem management. The ongoing Bank funded Solid Waste and 
Carbon Finance operation approved in September 2008 is supporting Amman City in addressing 
municipal solid waste issues, while initiating steps towards integrated and efficient Municipal 
Solid Waste Management (MSWM) that minimizes negative environmental effects at both the 
local and global levels. It aims particularly at upgrading the current disposa l practices while 
mitigating Green Gas house and generating of green electricity at the existing landfill in Amman. 
The Government sees this operation as a model for other municipalities in Jordan to enhance their 
MSWM systems and the Ministry of Municipal Affairs expressed strong interest in applying such 
model throughout the country.  

Gender  

 The Bank Group has developed a program seeking to create an environment more conducive to 
higher participation of women in the labor force. An IDF grant to measure the impact of national 
policies and strategies on gender equality is under implementation. With funding from the Arab 
World Initiative (AWI), the Bank Group recently launched a technical assistance program to 
assist in creating an enabling environment for job creation for graduate young women in 
partnership with the private sector. Through its microfinance program, IFC has reached over 
35,000 women borrowers in Jordan (96% of all borrowers in the program). IFC is also tracking 
the number of jobs created for women through its investment projects. 

55. 
Several activities were launched under the Arab World Initiative in FY09 to support 
Jordan’s further integration into the regional and global economy, to foster faster and more 
inclusive growth and to address special challenges to Jordan’s development.  
 Technical assistance for the establishment of a center of excellence for professional development 
of teachers. 
 Assessment of energy integration in the Mashreq countries. 
 Assessment of cross-border facilitation and infrastructure in Mashreq countries. 
 
IFC investments in trade finance facilities and mobilization of South-South and intra-regional 
investments. 

V. WORLD BANK GROUP PERFORMANCE 

56. 
Total IBRD lending for the CAS period amounted to $505.5 million, which exceeded the 
planned lending of $440 million (in the base case). Operations envisaged in the CAS were approved for a 
total commitment amount of $205.5 million in investment lending (six investment loans and one 
supplemental loan), and one development policy loan for $300 million. In addition to providing resources 
for these investments, Jordan has sought Bank support to develop overall policy frameworks and to serve 
as a catalyst for additional financing. 

57. While all the operations originally envisaged in the CAS were approved over the CAS 
period, the Higher Education Reform for the Knowledge Economy loan ($25 million) was subsequently 
cancelled with a view to limiting new debt. However, policy reforms associated with this project are now 

61 

 
 
 
 
 
being pursued with the support of TA from the Bank. In general, project preparation has been slower than 
anticipated (by about one year on average), largely because of delays in the preparation of the policy 
frameworks the projects are supporting. In some instances, delays have reduced the impact the projects 
could have during the CAS period.  

58. 
The active Bank portfolio in Jordan consists of 7 investment operations for a total net 
commitment of $243.5 million. The disbursement ratio for investment projects remained strong at 22.7% 
on average during the CAS period. Historically, the quality of the portfolio during the CAS period was 
satisfactory with only one problem project.28.  However, beginning in June 2010, the portfolio started 
showing signs of weakness which are reflected in three problem projects: the Cultural Heritage, Tourism 
and Urban Development (CHTUD) Project, the Employer Driven Skills Development Project, and the 
Social Protection Enhancement Project. These projects have been effective for over two years now, and 
several implementation issues have emerged mainly concerning low capacity of implementing agencies 
and lack of familiarity with Bank procurement, financial management and disbursement procedures. In all 
these cases, the Bank is working with the counterparts to develop action plans to improve performance, 
including restructuring as needed. 

59. 
Three projects closed during the CAS period. IEG rated the outcome of two of the projects 
unsatisfactory/moderately unsatisfactory, citing that the relevance of the design of the Higher Education 
project was modest, and did not provide effective means for obtaining the expected benefits. IEG found 
that the Horticultural Exports Promotion LIL generated little operationally relevant knowledge on the 
potential for involving small farmers in out-grower schemes. IEG rated the outcome of the Amman Water 
and Sanitation project moderately satisfactory because the objective: ―improve efficiency, management, 
operation and delivery of water and wastewater services for the Amman Service area and lay groundwork 
for sustainable involvement of private sector involvement in the countries overall management of water 
and wastewater services‖ was only modestly achieved. 

60. 
During the CAS period, a total of 13 recipient-executed grants amounting to $19.3 million 
and one grant of $1.0 million executed by the Bank were approved.29.Six of these grants have closed 
(total of $2.7 million), one was financed by the Trust Fund for Statistical Capacity Building (TFSCB) and 
five were financed by the Japan Policy and Human Resources Development Fund (PHRD). Currently, 
there are eight active grants (valued at about $17.6 million) in the portfolio of which seven are 
implemented by Jordanian authorities and one by the Bank.30 Three grants (total of $13 million) are 
financed by the Global Environment Facility (GEF)).  Overall, Jordan's trust fund portfolio performance 
is good albeit with some initial delays, generally due to a lack of pro-activity from the relevant staff on 
both Bank and Government sides. The team will continue close monitoring to avoid further delays. 

61. 
The existing trust fund portfolio includes three grants (valued at $20 million) which are financed 
by the Ozone Trust Fund (OTF), the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and 
the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA).  These grants were approved prior to this CAS 
period but the closing dates were extended and therefore are still active and being monitored. 

62. 
During the CAS period, two guarantees were approved valued at $60 million: (i) $45 million 
from IBRD for the Amman East Power Guarantee Project; and (ii) $15 million from the Carbon Fund for 
the Amman Landfill Gas Recovery Project. 

28. From FY06-FY09, the Public Sector Reform Capacity Building Project was in problem status.This project was later cancelled 
in March 2008. 
29 A GENTF grant of US$1.0 million which is implemented by the World Bank was approved in April 2010 to fund a technical 
assistance project to increase young female graduates’ employability and place them in private sector jobs. 
30 PCF Funds for Displaced Iraqi’s of about US$ 2.2 million were agreed with the Government of Jordan as recip ient of which 
the amount of US$ 1.2 million of recent additional financing was allocated to a third party implementing agency NGO Save the 
Children.  

62 

 
 
                                                 
63. 
Analytical and advisory services remain a key instrument for achieving the CAS objectives. 
The GoJ seeks high quality and detailed analytic work to further their drive towards reforming the 
economy and to adapt international experience to Jordan’s specific circumstances. The GoJ has sought 
programmatic assistance from the Bank to accompany reforms (many underpinned by diagnostic work) 
during the implementation phase. The Bank will continue to provide programmatic analytic support in 
key areas, including public expenditure management, social insurance, poverty monitoring, and energy 
sector reform. While there has been a high level of receptivity of the analytical program, dissemination 
has generally been limited, and, the GoJ has not benefited fully from feedback from key stakeholders 
which could have increased the impact of the analysis on the policy reform agenda. To respond to 
pressing requests from the GoJ, particularly in response to external shocks and the global economic 
downturn, the Bank Group quickly deployed a joint IBRD/IFC team of experts to prepare technical notes 
on specific issues such as the impact on growth of reductions in FDI, exports and remittances, as well as 
firm-level surveys. The Bank Group strove to apply the same rigor to these quick response studies 
designed to answer specific policy questions as is applied to classic ESW products, albeit with shorter 
delivery timelines. 

64. 
Financial Products. The GoJ took advantage of the interest rate conversion offer in connection 
with all eight of the currency pool loans in its IBRD loan portfolio. Most of the loans have been converted 
into fixed rate which resulted in a savings of about 2% in interest payments. The Bank will continue to 
focus on building awareness of the breadth of the menu of banking products available to Jordan. In 
addition to the choices available for new lending, the Bank will continue its dialogue on the use of 
existing IBRD financial products in contributing to the management of Jordan's financial risks. 

65. 
Public Debt Management. At the request of the Minister of Finance, a joint Bank/IMF mission 
advised the GoJ on developing a medium-term debt management strategy with a view to helping the 
authorities strengthen the governance structures for debt management and improve operational risk 
management. The Bank and the Fund also advised the authorities on how to s trengthen the integration of 
debt and fiscal management issues, in particular with a view to improving the effectiveness of cash 
management. In each of these areas, the team reviewed existing systems and capacities, and provided 
recommendations for strengthening these functions in the future. The Bank/IMF team will continue to 
assist in debt management strategy formulation and reorganization of the public debt management 
functions.  

66. 
IFC has scaled up its investment activities in Jordan considerably during the last few years. 
The portfolio has grown from $50 million at end FY05 to $ 400 million today. FY08 was a record 
year for IFC (commitments of $243 million in 8 projects), and in FY09, IFC committed $83 million in 
five projects in trade finance, cement transportation, and power distribution. At end February 2010, IFC 
had a committed investment portfolio of around $300 million in 14 companies. IFC’s current investment 
portfolio in Jordan encompasses a number of financial instruments, including loans, equity and quasi-
equity, and risk management and guarantees. Portfolio performance has been generally good. Effective 
collaboration with World Bank has always taken place and has been repeatedly recognized by IEG. IFC 
has a mid-sized country office in Amman, co-located with the Bank’s Iraq transitional office.

VI. 

LESSONS LEARNED  

67. 
The Bank Group will continue to pursue a selective and flexible approach in supporting 
Jordan’s development agenda. The ongoing global economic turmoil and uncertain outlook pose 
exceptional challenges to Jordan’s short- to medium-term economic prospects. In order to quickly 
respond to the challenges that may arise as a result of the global shocks and the highly volatile 
environment, the Bank will approach the Jordan program with an even higher degree of flexibility to 
deploy rapidly, using the various instruments available. The Bank has been successful at meeting 
government requests in energy, education, social protection, public expenditure management and poverty 
reduction, through a mix of instruments relevant to a sophisticated LMIC. The principles of flexibility and 
selectivity will guide the Bank Group’s engagement in Jordan with a view to being able to respond to 
requests from the GoJ based on the following criteria for involvement: (a) select sectors or areas with the 
highest contribution to the GoJ’s strategic objectives and in which the Bank has a comparative advantage 
and can serve as a catalyst for reform, and (b) address emergency issues, particularly the impact of the 
global economic and financial downturn on Jordan’s economy.  

68. 
In formulating the new CPS for Jordan the Bank will pay particular attention to the need 
for continued strong analytical work and technical assistance, especially in the area of economic 
diversification and sources of growth. High quality analytical and advisory work made important 
contributions to the GoJ’s development agenda and remain also in future highly relevant to respond to 
GoJ’s requests. The Bank demonstrated a high degree of preparedness and flexibility and was able to 
respond effectively and swiftly to the GoJ request for a $300m DPL. The Bank will need to remain agile 
and be able to respond to the changing needs of the country, especially as it emerges from the effects of 
the global economic crisis. 

69. 
Broad-based consultations are necessary to assure support from different stakeholders. The 
Bank will commit to having intense consultation during the new CPS period as well as through its sector 
interventions, when preparing for a new project, as well as agreeing on the stages of project preparation 
and timeline approvals by both sides, in addition to the implementation.  

70. 
Close collaboration between the IFC and IBRD is key to respond to Jordan’s demand. 
Strong local presence of IFC and active engagement of the entire WBG on the ground shows 
positive results. IFC has had a positive experience during its increased engagement in Jordan over the 
CAS period..In the context of this improved partnership between IFC and the private sector as well as the 
GoJ, the Government has expressed strong interest in having greater involvement of IFC in its reform and 
private sector development program in the upcoming CAS period. 

71. 
In moving forward to the next Country Partnership Strategy for Jordan, there is a need for 
greater realism in designing the results matrix. The 2006 CAS results matrix, updated in March 2009, 
was too specific and at times overly ambitious. While the matrix continued to be broadly relevant 
throughout the time period of the CAS, certain milestones should have been simplified and easier to 
assess. The lesson learned here is to ensure a more reasonable and practical results framework that 
accounts for the flexibility and dynamism of the Bank approach. 

VII. 

THE WAY FORWARD 

72. 
Despite the progress made, Jordan still confronts several challenges, including those that 
will arise from the recent global economic slowdown. Challenges include vulnerability to fluctuations 
in the international oil market, due to the country’s high energy import dependency; high unemployment 
and dependency on remittances from Gulf economies; and increasing pressure on natural resources, 
especially water. The greatest challenge (and also the largest opportunity) remains the necessity to create 

64 

 
 
adequate conditions for increased private investment and improved competitiveness. This will help to 
deliver the high and sustainable growth needed to create employment and to reduce poverty. Staying the 
course with the implementation of the fiscal consolidation program may prove more challenging in the 
future but is key for preserving good economic performance. 

73. 
Achieving sustained growth and reducing unemployment and poverty are the main 
development challenges in Jordan. Commensurate with strong growth in investments and GDP, labor 
force growth in Jordan has been strong. However, unemployment among nationals declined slowly (from 
14.5% during 2000-05 to 12.7% in 2008). The unemployment rate might further increase in 2010 if 
economic activity slows down and fewer job opportunities are available for Jordanians in the Gulf 
countries. Unemployment needs to be addressed through changes in policies that affect incentives for 
employers to hire Jordanian workers and incentives for Jordanians to accept available jobs rather than 
wait for public sector openings or overseas jobs. While employment among those who actively seek work 
need to be supported through increased focus on skills, addressing voluntary unemployment requires 
aligning policies with the Jordan’s aspiration for becoming a knowledge economy.  

74. 
Sustained progress in implementation of structural reforms and a supportive regional and 
external environment are critical for sustaining good economic performance. The economy continues 
to perform well despite negative external shocks. Nevertheless, there are risks associated with Jordan’s 
heavy reliance on capital inflows and with pressures on the fiscal balance. The Government’s increasing 
emphasis on cushioning the population from the impact of the price shocks and economic downturn since 
2008 led to a divergence from the fiscal consolidation program and erosion of fiscal gains achieved over 
the previous years. However, in the period ahead, pressures from price shocks are expected to ease 
resulting in budgetary savings from subsidies in the GoJ’s 2009 budget, but the indirect economic impact 
of the global financial turmoil may continue to put pressure on the fiscal balance.

Adoption of a simplified private sector

Adoption of subsidy reform (energy). 

Achieved: The GoJ has defined and adopted a coherent 
investment strategy. Successful execution of this strategy 
hinges on consistent implementation which, if achieved, 
can yield significant improvement in the coming two 
years. Over the last 4 years, IFC’s portfolio in Jordan 
increased significantly from $50 Million to around $400 
Million today, an indication of an improved environment 
for private sector participation in the economy. 
Achieved: Through the leadership of MoPIC, Jordan has 
adopted a private sector led institutional framework for 
investment. Jordan made it easier to start a business and 
pay taxes, extended the construction permit one-stop 
shop to medium-size projects, lowered property transfer 
taxes, implemented major court reforms, and sped up 
trade. Despite these reforms, Jordan’s Doing Business 
2011 ranking dropped to 111 from 107st in 2010.  
Achieved: In addition to larger PPPs (e.g., power sector), 
GOJ/EPC is now pursuing medium-sized PPPs in 
transport, housing, education..WB is overseeing USAID 
TF to develop regulatory & institutional framework for 
PPPs.. During the CAS period two PPPs were completed . 
WB will provide a AAA policy note on guarantees for 
LT debt financing for PPPs, provided a partial risk 
guarantee to support private financing of the Amman 
East Power project and will propose a new PRG 
guarantee operation. .  
 IFC made a landmark investment along with IsDB in the 
Queen Alia International Airport - a 25 yr concession 
awarded by GoJ. 
Achieved: Subsidies for oil products were gradually 
removed (completed in February 2008), resulting in a 
significant increase in the prices of oil products. 
Associated cost in real income for low and middle 
income groups has been compensated by a variety of 
measures including tax reductions and exemptions, 
various subsidies/transfers and a substantial increase in 
public sector pay.

Importance of identifying a leader who is 
consistent, committed and can create consensus. 

Consistent implementation of the framework in 
the coming years is crucial to the success of this 
strategy.  
Crisis-DPL complemented through the prior 
actions ongoing Business Environment and 
Financial Sector Reforms.. 

Jordan is a primary importer of energy and 
therefore, moving forward, prospects for energy 
security should be taken into account. Consider 
working with Jordan in enhancing renewable 
energy capacity, conducting domestic 
exploration and enhancing regional integration. 
Continue to support the GoJ in implementing the

Lessons Learned 

Curricula, textbooks, and other learning 
resources for all grades and subjects 
revised, with appropriate teacher training 
taking place. 

Achieved: Curricula, textbooks, etc. revised and in place. 
Teacher training intensified and enhanced.  
2007 TIMSS Scores: 482 science and 427 math. Results 
showed positive and marginally significant improvement 
in performance. In Science, Jordan improved its regional 
and international ranking. 
Between 1997 and 2007, Jordan witnessed the largest 
increase in science test scores of 8th grade students in the 
international assessment - TIMSS - in which more than 
50 countries participate globally. This is clearly hard 
evidence that the education reforms in general education 
over the last decade have made a difference, particularly 
taking into account that net enrolment rate in the 8 th 
grade has also increased during that period. 
In FY11, IFC made a $13 million equity participation in 
EdFund (a UAE based Fund) to support their acquisition 
of Al-Alamiyah Schools in Amman..The project will 
help increase the quality of private schooling in Jordan. 
Achieved: 2008 NAFKE results show improvements in 
scores compared to 2006 baseline in all grades tested 
(5th, 9th, 11th) and in following subjects per grade tested: 
(i) 5th: reading; (ii) 9th: math, science and reading; and 
(iii) 11th: math and reading. 
Partially achieved: A detailed policy framework and 
operational plan (embodied in the Statement of Sector 
Policy) were developed collaboratively with stakeholders 
and different ministries and the policy framework was 
endorsed by the Council of Ministers in March 2009. 
Subsequently in August 2009, Parliament passed three 
laws for the sector: The Higher Education Law; the 
Public Universities Law; and the Higher Education 
Accreditation Law. These laws are the basis for 
governance and management reforms of the sector. 

Partially achieved: This outcome was only partially met 
though there are plans in the Ministry of Higher 
Education and Scientific Research to develop an 
expanded program to include loans, as well as merit-
based grants, with close links to the banking sector in 
Jordan. Only a limited student aid program is currently 
operational in MHESR which existed prior to CAS 
period, but has been expanding unsustainably. GOJ has 

67 

Improving TIMSS scores reflects continuing 
good performance of Jordan education system, 
but is not necessarily attributable to 
interventions in CAS period. 

Despite the fact that the HERfKE project was 
cancelled immediately after it was approved by 
the Bank Board (due to fiscal constraints caused 
by financial crisis), the Bank’s support in 
preparing and technical assistance in the CAS 
period resulted in the development of a policy 
framework, the basis of which were the 
legislative changes approved in August 2009. 
Key lesson is that the Bank’s TA can be of 
benefit and can sometimes achieve even more 
than project loans.  
This outcome was one of the subcomponents of 
the HERfKE project which was cancelled by 
GoJ. The Bank will be extending TA to GoJ to 
support the development of a robust student aid 
program, and thus the lesson learned is similar to 
the point above.

the JSAB by end January 2011, for the JSAB to be 
operational for the 2011/2012 school year. 
IFC has introduced a student loan program through the 
Cairo Amman Bank in an effort to increase access to 
higher education by low and middle-income groups. 
Achieved: Law #20 enacted in April 2008 establishing 
the Higher Education Accreditation Commission 
(HEAC). The law was amended in August 2009 to give 
HEAC full autonomy, and the HEAC now reports to the 
Prime Minister. 
Partially achieved: Cabinet endorsed new law setting up 
the E-TVET Council. 
 However, Council has not been functioning as foreseen 
and although its secretariat has been established, it needs 
further support. A number of PPP have been signed with 
hospitality, pharmaceutical, automotive and telecom 
industries. 

Lessons Learned 

Progress in the E-TVET area has shown to be 
more complex and slow than expected at outset. 
Key reason is the involvement of multiple 
stakeholders – not just Ministry of Labor, but 
equally the Ministries of Education and Higher 
Education, as well as private sector.

incorporated in new draft pension 
law. Implementation details 
developed.  

 f. 

Both Safety Nets and Social Inclusion (SI) 
reforms became part of the Crisis DPL. Without 
the work that had been undertaken over the past 
years in these two areas, and the priority that the 
Bank and the GoJ put on these areas, it would 
have been difficult to approve a DPL without a 
safety net component. 
Decisions and deliberations took longer than was 
anticipated due to political consensus issues and 
a lack of champions.  

Switching from the previous targeting 
mechanism (categorical) to a new mechanism 
(proxy-means testing) proved to be more 
difficult than expected. Resistance to change is 
high. In addition, the financial crisis made it 
difficult for the GoJ to take measures that would 
touch programs known to be focused on the poor 
regardless of how good of a job they were doing. 

In many respects the outcomes of the SI 
components went beyond expectations. Not only 
did a new Social Insurance Law get approved, 
but in addition, the new SI legislation includes 
various innovative and important reforms unlike 
many other countries in the region. In addition, 
the process followed by the SSC was exemplary 
in seeking technical advice from various aspects, 
having very high ownership of the reforms, 
building its own technical capacity, and 
launching a wide and massive information 
campaign on the reform.   
Another important lesson is the value that Bank 
continued involvement with a reform process 
could have. In this case, it was the programmatic 
ESW approach, supported by high level 

Partially achieved: The elements of the strategy have 
been spelled out in several strategic documents, 
including the Bank safety net strategy for Jordan and GoJ 
documents. The GoJ has agreed to Bank safety net 
strategy though no formal approval by Cabinet or Higher 
Council has yet taken place 

Partially achieved: The IBRD project (SPEP) was 
approved and implementation begun. The project 
supports strengthening the targeting mechanism and 
establishing the database on poor and vulnerable 
population. Progress is slow however in adopting an 
improved targeting mechanism. Field testing completed 
only by end 2009. 

Achieved: A new NGO law was passed by Parliament in 
summer of 2009.  
Achieved: d.) Reform proposal enacted into law end 
March 2010 as a new Social Insurance Law, and 
implementation commenced. The new law includes 
reforms to make the pension system financially 
sustainable, introduces maternity benefits, health 
insurance, unemployment insurance, and extend 
coverage to establishments with 5 or less employees. 

Partially achieved: e.) Outcome achieved partially at 
least for the members of the SSC who will now have 
health insurance coverage  

Achieved: f.) This outcome has been achieved.

ANNEX 3:  DEVELOPMENT PARTNERS 

Jordan has good relations with its development partners. The Government of Jordan has a 
clear understanding of the comparative advantages of donors based on various areas of technical 
expertise and terms of their financial support.  

The role played by external financing31 in Jordan has tended to be quite significant, ranging 
between 35-45 percent of total Government revenues which is considerably higher than the MIC 
country average of 17 percent.  In 2010, foreign grants constituted 9.4 percent of total domestic 
revenues in Jordan which is equivalent to 2.1 percent of GDP.  Brief descriptions of development 
partners’ programs in Jordan are provided below: 

Abu Dhabi: The Abu Dhabi Fund for Development started to finance priority economic and 
social projects through soft loans as early as 1974.  Ongoing intervention supports the health 
sector and residential construction such as the expansion of Al Basheer Hospital in Amman, the 
Queen Rania Al-Abdullah for Children Hospital, and the development of Al Karma 
Neighborhood in Aqaba for a total of $49.3 million. 

Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development:  The Fund supports nine projects in 
Amman, Irbid, Zarqa, Aqaba, and Tafilah.  The sectors covered are mainly water, health, 
infrastructure, agriculture, social services and electricy.  Ongoing Projects funded by soft loans 
include:  Al Wihda Dam; Amman Development Corridor (Phase I & II); Development of Wadi 
Araba Region; Prince Hamza Hospital; and the Samra Electric Power Generating Plant (Phase III 
& IV).  Grant-supported projects address life sciences R&D, Mobile Mammography Unit, and a 
Women’s Health Center in the South.  The Fund’s ongoing portfolio is about $373.3 million. 

Canada (Canadian International Development Agency-CIDA): Canada 
launched 
its 
development relationship with Jordan in 1986.  CIDA has focused its assistance on Jordan’s 
human resources development and has been a key partner in supporting Jordan’s education 
reform program (ERfKE I & II), the vocational training sector, and the empowerment of the 
Ministry of Labor to develop and manage a demand-driven labor sector. Currently ongoing 
financial and technical cooperation is directed towards developing the Human Resources 
Development Information System II and providing support to Jordan’s ERfKE which is also 
financed by the WB.  The newly committed support to the ERfKE II is Canadian $20 million.  
CIDA will maintain its thematic priorities with a focus on human resources development in the 
areas of basic education, employment and vocational training, gender and local development.  
The volume of support is expected to reach C$7 million annually. 

China:  Between 1999 and 2009, China has provided Jordan with 17 grants totaling $57.1 million 
to finance key development projects in various areas such as rehabilitating water supply 
networks, financing the construction of housing projects, training of Jordanian officials in China, 
and supplying equipment to ministries.  Ongoing projects include the Al-Baqa’a Hospital, the  
Installation of Central Monitoring System in Amman, the Jordanian Servicemen Apartment 
Project, the Low Income Family Housing Project, and the Water Supply Network Upgrading and 
Expansion Project.   

31 External financing is defined here as ―grants and other revenue‖ which includes grants from other foreign 
governments, international organizations, and other government units; interest; dividends; rent; requited, 
nonrepayable receipts for public purposes (such as fines, administrative fees, and entrepreneurial income 
from government ownership of property); and voluntary, unrequited, nonrepayable receipts other than 
grants.

The European Investment Bank (EIB) has been supporting Jordan since 1978.  Becoming a key 
player in the financial partnership between Europe and the Mediterranean, its activities increased 
significantly after the establishment of the Facility for Euro-Mediterranean Investment and 
Partnership (FEMIP) in 2002.  Its investments are focused on support for the private sector and 
on the creation of an investment-friendly environment.  It has provided financing to the following 
sectors:  water and environment; industry; transport; telecommunications; energy; SME finance; 
human capital projects; and private equity as well as technical assistance with feasibility studies 
for major infrastructure projects.  Future engagement will be directed towards the following 
sectors:  energy, water, transport, PPPs and private sector-led initiatives.  Outstanding and 
committed exposure stands at €40 million. 

The European Union (EU) is an important development partner in Jordan in the context of the 
EU Neighborhood Policy.  The four strategic objectives of the EU Country Strategy Paper (CSP) 
for Jordan for the period 2007-13 and the National Indicative Program are:  (i) democracy, human 
rights, media and justice; (ii) trade, enterprise and investment development; and (iii) sustainability 
of the growth process, including human resource development ; (iv) public financial reform, (v) 
the development of new or alternative energy sources; (vi) local development.  For the period 
2011-13, the EU proposed to allocate €223 million under the ENPI bilateral envelope.  

France (Agence Française de Développement-AFD):  AFD started to operate in Jordan in 2004 
and pursues two strategic objectives:  i) sustainable environment and management of water 
resources; and ii) improvement of living conditions and social cohesion.  AFD has provided loans 
and a grant facility to finance projects in the energy, environment, sanitation, and water and 
irrigation sectors under the first objective. AFD and the French GEF contributed to the multi-
donor trust fund administered by the World Bank on the Red Sea-Dead Sea water conveyance 
study program.  The Regional and Local Development Project, co-financed with the World Bank, 
is supported together with microfinance and the private sector under AFD’s second pillar.  
Committed exposure stands at €400 million.  In July 2011, Jordan and AFD signed a 3 year MOU 
under which a ceiling €600 million was made available to finance projects in the water, transport, 
energy, and local development sectors, in addition to extending development policy loans, and 
supporting the SME Program. 

Germany (Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit-GIZ/Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau-
KfW):  Germany’s support for Jordan targets several areas including debt swap and the 
rescheduling of Jordan's debt to Germany.  Financial cooperation includes the provision of 
schools, support for the German-Jordanian University, and diverse investments in the water 
sector. Technical support is mainly concentrated on the execution of projects in the following 
areas:  water (focus area), energy efficiency, environmental issues, management of public 
expenditures, and fiscal decentralization.  Based on the German-Jordanian Government Talks in 
the form of financial cooperation (€99 million is earmarked for Jordan for 2011-2012 to be 
extended in the form of financial cooperation (€93 million) to finance projects implemented by 
KfW, and technical cooperation ((€6 million) to be implemented by GIZ. 

International Fund for Agriculture Development (IFAD) has committed $71.4 million in loans 
to Jordan since 1981 to support agricultural development and reduce rural poverty. The main 
focus of its support to Jordan is in the agriculture sector, with an emphasis on agricultural 
development, financial services and capacity building through soft loans and grants. Ongoing 
projects aim to improve food and water security and designed to empower small farmers, herders 
and rural women (Agricultural Resource Management Project - Phase II in Karak and Tafila & 
Yarmouk Agricultural Resources Development Project). 

78 

 
 
 
International Monetary Fund (IMF): The IMF has been assisting Jordan in assessing the 
macroeconomic impact of recent developments and how best to preserve economic and financial 
stability and promote inclusive growth.  The Fund has provided technical assistance to the CBJ, 
including through its Middle East Technical Assistance Center (METAC).  This has covered the 
budgeting and costing framework, external sector statistics (foreign direct investment survey, 
balance of payments and international investment information, collection and compilation of 
remittances data) and monetary and banking statistics.  METAC has also been providing technical 
assistance to the Ministry of Finance in cash management and treasury single account.  Areas of 
joint work between the IMF and the World Bank also cover technical assistance to the Ministry of 
Finance in developing a medium-term debt management strategy, and the assessment of progress 
with public financial management reforms.  Most recently, staffs of the two institutions have been 
coordinating closely on policy advice on consumer subsidy reform. 

Islamic Development Bank (IDB):  Jordan and the Islamic Development Bank have enjoyed 
close ties since 1976.  The IDB project portfolio in Jordan consists of eight projects funded by 
grants and soft loans.  Ongoing projects funded by soft loans include microfinance, electricity 
transmission, the central library at the Jordan University of Science and Technology, and 
infrastructure support in the health sector (Zarqa Hospital).  Grant-supported projects address 
capacity building on the local level, microfinance, and the National Information Technology 
Center.  The projects amount to a total of $133.6 million. 

Italy:  Italy supports a portfolio of 5 ongoing projects throughout Jordan and in several sectors 
such as: trade and industry development, water/wastewater, and employment and vocational 
training, tourism, education, and SMEs.  Projects amount to about $76 million in the form of 
grants and soft loans. 

Japan:  Japan’s financial and technical assistance has helped Jordan in pursuing its reform 
programs and in implementing priority projects in key sectors.  Japan has an extensive technical 
cooperation program in Jordan which is implemented by the Japan International Cooperation 
Agency in a broad number of areas including tourism development , clean energy, SME 
development, environmental protection, water resources management, and support to Palestinian 
refugees.  JICA cooperates with the Jordanian Government to promote regional stability through 
a joint training program for neighboring countries in various sectors.  JICA is also preparing its 
first Development Policy Loan to Jordan in collaboration with the WB.  

Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Saudi Fund for Development:  The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia 
provides significant support to Jordan.  One important instrument of assistance is the Saudi Fund 
for Development.  Jordan was one of the first countries to have received assistance from the 
Fund.  During the period 1975-2010, the Fund financed 18 priority economic and social 
development projects through soft loans with a total amount of $315,617 million.  These projects 
focused on following sectors:  water, infrastructure, health, energy and industry.  Ongoing 
projects funded are:  the expansion of the Al Samra Electric Power Station (Phase III) for $51 
million and two health projects; the expansion of Al Basheer Hospital in Amman (phases II & 
III); and the Al-Zarqa Hospital in Zarqa for a total of $78.6 million. In addition, the Kingdom of 
Saudi Arabia has also provided a $1.4 billion grant to Jordan in 2011. 

Kuwait: The Kuwait Fund for Arabic Economic Development provides soft loans and grants to 
support the preparation of feasibility studies in the following sectors:  Industry, Water, 
Infrastructure, Health, and Education.  The Fund has financed several ongoing priority 
development projects through soft loans such as a power plant expansion in the electricity sector 
(a supplementary loan agreement was signed in March 2011 for the Alsamra Power Generation 
Company for $11.9 million) and a health care infrastructure project (Prince Hashem Bin Abdallah 
II Hospital in Aqaba).  The Kuwait Fund has provided a total of 25 loans to Jordan in the total 

79 

 
amount of about $520 million to assist in financing projects in various sectors.  The Fund’s 
ongoing portfolio is about $147.6 million. 

OPEC Fund for International Development:  The OPEC Fund supports projects in several 
areas such as agriculture and agro-industry, energy, education, health, and industry.  The total 
amount of supported projects has reached about $70 million.  One health-related supported 
project is at the Queen Rania Al Abdallah Hospital (Children Hospital) in Amman and an 
agriculture-related project is the Agricultural Resources Management - Phase II, in Al Karak, 
Maan, and Tafilah.  OPEC also supported a research grant to help visually impaired girls at the 
Saudi Center for Rehabilitation and Training of Blind Girls ($130,000) and a grant to support a 
conference on Food Security and Climate Change.  

South Korea:  A total amount of $16.16 million was extended to Jordan as grants during the 
period 2004-2008 to finance a series of projects.  South Korea has also provided Jordan with soft 
loans for a total amount of $119.4 million to finance projects in the water sector.  Areas of 
supported projects cover water and wastewater, health, vocational training, supplying equipment 
to ministries and public institutions, nuclear energy, and private sector innovation strategy (in 
cooperation with the WBI).  

Spain (Agencia Espaňola de Cooperación Internacional para el Desarrollo-AECID):  Spain 
supports ten projects in Jordan targeting several areas including education, tourism, microfinance, 
water, local development, environment, health, and ICT.  Spain’s grants amount to about $5 
million.  

Sweden:  Sweden supports three water projects in the Zarqa and Aqaba areas.  Recently, it-
supported regional climate study was started to map the impact of climate change on water 
resources as well as regional economic integration initiatives related to investments, trade, and 
standardization.  

USA: USAID has been a partner in Jordan for almost 60 years.  Investments in Jordan total 
nearly $7.4 billion, with significant increases in the past decade as Jordan’s strategic centrality in 
the region has grown.  Due to the recent developments in the region , USAID is updating its 
Country Strategy for Jordan for the years 2012 – 2017 and is focusing its aid on six main sectors:  
water, energy, economic growth, health, education, and democracy and governance.  Youth and 
poverty alleviation are major cross-cutting themes integrated across USAID’s portfolio.  USAID 
also provides a large Cash Transfer Program to help with Jordan’s balance of payments.  The 
annual economic assistance budget for Jordan in Fiscal Year 2010 totaled $463 million including 
an additional $100 million in FY 2010 that was provided to address pressing economic issues.

ANNEX 4:  CONSULTATION REPORT  

During the course of its engagement in Jordan, the World Bank has maintained a good dialogue 
with the Government and with different development partners including the private sector, academia, civil 
society organizations, parliament and local representatives.  In the preparation of the Country Partnership 
Strategy (CPS), consultations were carried out on different levels, organized both around the CPS itself as 
well as around other elements of the Bank’s work in Jordan (analytical reports, projects, conferences, etc).  
The goal of these consultations was to understand better the priorities, challenges , and obstacles to 
development and to ascertain where the World Bank has brought value added and where its engagement 
could be strengthened.  These consultations were also an opportunity to disseminate key analytical reports 
and lessons learned from the World Bank’s program in Jordan.  

Consultations with Government 

The development of the CPS has been a consultative and iterative process with the Government 
involving a series of discussions at different levels.  Consultations were carried out mainly with the 
Ministry of Planning and International Cooperation (MoPIC) which coordinates the Bank’s program in 
Jordan, although discussions were held also with other ministries where the Bank finances activities.  The 
CPS discussions were launched in February 2010 with a large meeting between most of the World Bank’s 
Jordan Country Team and the principal interlocutors and representatives of different Government 
ministries and agencies.  Thereafter, the Bank’s team followed up through a series of meetings with 
MoPIC and other ministries to understand more clearly how they viewed the World Bank’s engagement, 
what were the lessons learnt from the previous Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), and where they were 
seeking the Bank’s partnership in the future.  

From these consultations it was apparent that the Government has a clear vision of where and 
how it wants the Bank to engage.  The Minister of Planning and International Cooperation, during his 
participation in the 2010 Bank’s Annual Meetings, elaborated on the Government’s Executive 
Development Program, and these meetings helped the country team better align the CPS pillars and 
themes with the Government’s priorities.  

The Government actively contributed to the CPS beyond consultations by reviewing various 
drafts of the document and providing useful insights, comments , and inputs.  These exchanges were 
carried out with candor and reflected a solid partnership between the Bank and the Government. 

Internal CPS consultation  

The Bank also held several internal meetings dedicated to the development of the CPS and also 
invited outside experts to discuss Jordan’s development challenges and the Bank’s most valuable 
contribution to the country’s development. 

Preparation for the CPS consultations 

The Bank’s CPS team prepared consultations during March and October 2010 and March 2011 
with a set of development partners and stakeholders.  The objective was to organize events that would be 
representative of a range of stakeholders but would also allow for productive discussion and debate. 

The Bank team targeted specific partners and stakeholders through a careful review of the main 
civil society organizations and private sector representatives.  Invitations to the consultations in Amman 
were extended to local representatives, NGOs, and women’s groups.  Representation included sectors and 
groups directly affected by the CPS pillars under discussion. 

82 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Invitations were sent out with a note on the CPS process which provided information on the 
nature and goal of the consultations, the nature of the CPS itself, results and challenges from the last 
Country Assistance Strategy (2006-10), key lessons, and ongoing Bank Group projects in Jordan.  At the 
meetings, information packages were made available according to the target audience.  Information 
shared with participants included:  (i) an informational web package posted on the Jordan website with 
links to related CPS and country data; (ii) a framework note explaining what a CPS is, along with the 
purpose of the consultations in English and Arabic; (iii) information packages with a set of brochures (10 
Things to Know about the World Bank and the WB Public Information Center resources) and (iv) a Press 
release. 

Two objectives guided the approach of the consultations: 

 To discuss the priorities and the role of the World Bank in Jordan:  The consultations were 
structured so as to introduce the World Bank Group’s approach to development and to gather 
opinions on the development priorities in the country; the themes proposed by the CPS (pillars 
and cross-sectoral themes); the role of the World Bank in Jordan; perceptions relating to the 
efficiency of its activities and its impacts; and ways to better support the country. 

 To provide depth to the consultations on the sector specific themes.  Thematic consultations 
were conducted on the subjects and/or the sectors that emerged from discussions during the pre-
CPS consultations phase, for example:  private and banking sector, gender issues, the knowledge 
economy, and public-private partnership.  

Thematic consultations 

In planning and conducting the thematic consultations, the Bank team benefited from the existence 
of an umbrella organization and think tank that operates as an independent advisory body to the Jordanian 
Government on economic and social issues and policies.  The Economic and Social Council (ESC) has 
the mandate to advise the executive body on the outlines of economic and social policy and is the first 
official and institutionalized forum for the promotion of social dialogue and policy discussions in Jordan.  
The ESC brings together the Government, the private sector, labor, and civil society organizations with 
the goal of reaching consensus on economic and social policies in Jordan.  It works to promote 
coordination among stakeholders and to strengthen accountability in Government.  The ESC is made up 
of experts from a wide range of backgrounds and is able to draw on their experience.  The ESC has four 
policy committees:  Economic, Social, Labor, and Educational.  The Bank team had several meetings 
with the ESC, and discussions took place with wide representation of ESC members.  In addition, the 
Bank team met with a number of NGOs working on a range of development issues, including: (i) 
education, (ii) health, (iii) infrastructure and public service delivery, and (iv) local development. 

On education and employability 

This sector emerged as a main concern of various stakeholders, especially with regard to the 
quality of public education, particularly in rural areas, and the mismatch between the labor market needs 
and the work force.  This mismatch is seen to be exacerbating unemployment, especially among the 
youth.  Participants noted that education in rural areas suffers from weak infrastructure and poor quality 
of delivery.  Participants also raised the issue of rural ―hub schools,‖ suggesting that low enrollment 
schools in small villages should be closed in favor of one main school which could cater to the region.  
This model should take into consideration the availability of public transport needed for students and 
teachers as costs of commuting are high.  

As for private education, the standard is seen to be higher, but guidance for students is still 
lacking regarding the needs of the labor market—a process that participating NGOs deemed necessary to 

83 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
start at an early age.  The mismatch creates a surplus of graduates in certain professions which contributes 
to brain drain.  Conversely, there is a severe shortage of Jordanians in certain professions which is offset 
by foreign workers.  The participants believe that this issue should be addressed through vocational 
education and skills training on a national level, not only in rural areas, and requires a change in the 
Jordanian mentality of seeking prestigious professional jobs and high wages.  The NGOs acknowledged 
that mentality change is a long process and should focus on small communities.  Participants raised the 
issue of public daycare centers (pre-schooling) needed to support working mothers. 

Private sector representatives expressed dissatisfaction with the level of competence of university 
graduates.  Jordan’s once renowned human capital was said to be dwindling.  Gulf countries which used 
to attract many Jordanian graduates would in ten years look elsewhere for employees due to the poor 
quality of university education.  The problem was traced back to 1986 when private for-profit universities 
started spreading; these focused more on profit than on educational quality.  Due to the incompetence of 
graduates, private sector employers are resorting to foreign labor.  Strengthening vocational education and 
training could help reduce unemployment rates in the long run.  

Women make up a small share of the workforce in Jordan due to a number of reasons, including: 
social taboos, inadequate maternity leave and employment benefits, and discrimination in salary and 
employment opportunities by the employers.  To address these shortcomings, the participants suggested 
that gender issues should be included in early education curriculums.  Although this is a long-term 
process, the Government and the Bank were urged to engage with all strands of the community, especially 
schools, teachers, and parents.  

 Need to focus on the quality of education, education systems and education management  
 Need to address the quality of education both at the university and school level, and encourage 
vocational training 
 Need to address underlying constraints of women’s employability, starting with early education  

On rural and local development 

Participants stressed that the high level of urbanization of the Jordanian population (around 80 
percent) has deepened the disparity between rural and urban development, contributing to increased 
poverty and unemployment, especially among women and youth.  In some cases, women in rural areas 
are discouraged from pursuing employment as it is considered to be ―shameful‖.  The National Aid Fund 
currently provides cash transfers to the unemployed (JD 40 per month).  These cash transfers, coupled 
with generally low salaries in the labor market, make it unattractive for the unemployed to pursue jobs. 
Participating NGOs agreed that micro-finance as well as Government support to job-creating businesses 
instead of cash transfers may provide better incentives for social development, not only in rural areas, but 
also in urban centers.  Participants also noted that severe water shortages and inferior electricity 
infrastructure discourage agricultural and industrial projects.  Moreover, the absence of public transport is 
encouraging rural-urban migration.  

The health sector in rural areas is seen to be inefficient and fragmented.  Health ―clinics‖ are poorly 
staffed and equipped.  Similar to the ―hub schools‖ suggestion, participants requested consolidation of 
these clinics into ―hubs‖ that serve wider areas and could be better monitored and maintained.  Again, 
public transport was cited as an important component for the success of this model. 

 Need to address regional disparities by supporting local economic development and micro-
finance to support local job creation 

84 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
On fiscal management 

Participants noted that Jordan’s slow recovery from the financial and economic meltdown was due to 
its dependence on foreign aid.  The Government sought pre-2008 to reduce its dependence on regional 
inflows and rely more on the international community.  The participants believed that Jordan’s fiscal 
management is inefficient and that donor aid should be allocated to capital investments rather than used to 
pay salaries of the public sector employees.  The Government was said to be bent on shrinking the deficit, 
without examining the impact on the economy. 

 Need for expenditure rationalization, then expenditure cuts 

On private and banking sector 

A key problem for private sector growth was said to be the absence of dialogue between the 
public sector and the private sector.  One of the issues raised by the private sector was commercial banks’ 
limiting the line of credit extended to the private sector.  This was seen to be restraining the potential 
growth of the private sector.  From the commercial bank side, figures showed that the amount of credit 
extended to the private sector is recovering and comparable to the previous years; however, drilling down 
and analyzing the figures showed that most of the extended credit went to a limited number of firms. 

Microfinance is considered as a strong enabler for women’s employability.  World Bank statistics 
showed that 98 percent of Jordanian women have paid back their loans on time.  Participants believe that 
the banking system in Jordan is too conservative and risk averse towards micro-credit, especially for 
women.  Moreover, there is a general lack of confidence in the sustainability of small industries; products 
could be of high value, but the packaging is costly, and the marketing and branding skills are poor, 
therefore banks are reluctant to offer credit.  

 Need for better dialogue between the private and public sector, better access to finance, in 
particular to MSMEs 

On governance 

Corporate governance was seen as a mirror of the public administration and was a serious concern 
for both the NGOs and the private sector.  Hiring decisions should be based on experience and skills 
rather than nepotism. 

 Need to strengthen transparency and accountability in the public administration  

On development coordination 

Participants noted that in general, donor contributions to Jordan’s social development have been 
fragmented, uncoordinated and short-term, especially those related to education, social awareness and 
youth.
