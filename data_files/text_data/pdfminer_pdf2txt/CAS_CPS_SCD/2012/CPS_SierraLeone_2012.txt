I.  INTRODUCTION 

1. 
This Progress Report assesses the implementation to date and the adjustments to the Joint 
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) of the World Bank Group (WBG) and the African 
Development Bank (AfDB) for FY 2010-2013. 1  The CAS discussed by the Bank‘s Board on April 6, 
2010 was based on the priorities identified in the second Poverty Reduction Strategy, Agenda for Change, 
and focused on two pillars: (i) human development; and (ii) promoting inclusive growth.  At midterm, 
satisfactory progress has been achieved towards meeting the original CAS outcomes and milestones, and 
this report proposes adjustments to the CAS in order to align WBG support with significant changes to 
the country context.   

2. 
Two Annual Progress Reports of the Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS) were prepared by 
the Government of Sierra Leone (GoSL) in 2010 and 2011.  These Progress Reports were prepared 
following a joint government/CSO/development partner consultative process, and both reports conclude 
that satisfactory progress is being made in addressing priorities under the Agenda for Change.  These and 
other recent reports have informed this CAS Progress Report.  The 2011 Integrated Household Survey 
data analysis is currently underway, and the results are expected to be available over the coming months.  
The latest available data indicates that during the CAS implementation period progress has been made, 
albeit at different levels, on most indicators of growth, poverty, MDGs, fragi lity, investment climate, and 
governance.  However, there remain significant challenges and Sierra Leone is still one of the poorest 
countries in the world with some of the worst human development indicators.    

3. 
This CAS Progress Report is being prepared at a significant stage in the country‟s 
development.  Sierra Leone has enjoyed remarkable peace and stability since the end of the brutal civil 
war, ten years ago.  The country is now preparing for the third national elections to be held in late 2012, 
and if it goes smoothly, Sierra Leone would have achieved the distinction of having run three successful 
elections since the end of the conflict.  This would be an important milestone in Sierra Leone‘s recovery 
from ‗post-conflict‘ status.  National stakeholders appreciate the importance of smooth and peaceful 
elections, thus ensuring that no reversals take place in the progress that has been made during the past 
decade.  Another sign of the country‘s recovery is the steady improvement in the CPIA scores – in 2011 
with a score of 3.3, Sierra Leone has moved beyond the threshold of Fragile and Conflict Affected States 
(FCS)2.  At the same time, the country is undergoing a major economic transformation underpinned by 
the extractives sector – perhaps the most significant transformation the country is likely to see in a 
generation.  According to the latest projections, Sierra Leone is likely to record a 36 percent GDP growth 
in 20123 – a one-time shift on account of the initiation of iron-ore exports.  The extractives-driven boom 
comes with its sets of opportunities and challenges, and making the transformation as smooth as possible 
will be a priority for the country. 

4. 
The Progress Report has been prepared as a good segway into the next CAS, which is likely 
to be ready by FY14.  Sierra Leone is currently initiating the preparation of its third PRS: the ―Agenda 
for Prosperity‖, which is expected to be finalized in early 2013.  The initial concept note prepared by the 
Government of Sierra Leone (GoSL) and circulated as a basis for consultations has informed this Progress 
Report.  The next CAS will be developed once the third PRS has been completed and will follow the Joint 
Staff Assessment Note (JSAN).   

1 Due to slightly different timeframes of the WBG and AfDB for the CAS, this report is only for the WBG.  AfDB is 
doing a CAS Completion Report as its CAS is valid only until September 2012.  However, the two teams have carried 
out joint assessments and have shared the drafts of each other’s reports. 
2 Due to the presence of a UN political mission, it is still in the FCS list.  The CPIA scores were 3.1 (2008), 3.2 (2009) 
and 3.3 (2010).

II. COUNTRY CONTEXT AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS 

5. 
At the start of the CAS period, Sierra Leone was recovering from the impact of the global 
financial crisis, and has since had mixed macroeconomic performance .  Real GDP expanded by 5 
percent in 2010 and 6 percent in 2011.  The rebound in growth since 2010 has been broad-based, and was 
led by the manufacturing, mining, construction and agriculture sectors.  The increase in global fuel prices 
in 2011 led to an increase in gas prices at the pump, which along with heavy government borrowing from 
the Central Bank resulted in inflation, which peaked at 20 percent in early-2011 and then, declined 
slightly to 17 percent in late 2011.  Fiscal performance has been uneven in 2010 and 2011, and both years 
ended with higher than anticipated deficits, borrowing and arrears.  The first quarter of 2012 has seen a 
clearance of 2011 arrears.  While revenue performance has been better than projected, expenditures 
mainly driven by capital spending on infrastructure have outstripped revenue collections.  Fiscal 
consolidation is likely to remain a challenge, not least with looming national elections.  The Government 
continues to maintain a flexible exchange rate policy to facilitate the adjustment of the economy to 
external shocks.  Despite the widening trade deficit in 2011, the Leone remained relatively stable, 
depreciating by 4.8 percent against the US dollar. The reason was that the higher imports were largely 
financed by capital inflows from mining and construction companies.  The spurt in imports of machinery 
and equipment by the mining companies resulted in a spike in the overall level of imports and an increase 
in the current account deficit to 48 percent of GDP in 2011, as compared to 19 percent in 2010.   

6. 
Mineral exports and prospective discovery of oil and gas are likely to transform the 
economic landscape in the short to medium-term although they carry significant downside risks.  
Sierra Leone signed two significant mining concession agreements during the CAS period – with London 
Mining Plc and African Minerals Limited, and both have started iron-ore exports.  The production and 
export plans under these concessions show rapid growth between now and 2015-16.  Some estimates 
indicate that Sierra Leone‘s iron-ore reserves measured at current prices are likely to be worth 40 times its 
GDP in 2011.  Based on available production plans of mining projects, the acceleration in mineral 
depletion is likely to be quite pronounced, rising from 0.6 percent of GDP in 2011 to 14 percent in 2012 
and possibly 21 percent in 2015.  The uncertainty surrounding these prospective numbers is undoubtedly 
high, as it depends on the highly volatile global commodity prices, which impact rents and the volume of 
operations.  In the oil and gas sector, recent public announcements of discoveries at the Mercury and 
Jupiter off-shore wells continue to raise expectations, although the extent of commercial viability still 
needs to be confirmed by further testing.  The government is also currently evaluating bids received on 
the nine new exploration blocks offered in a recent round of bids.  These developments in the extractives 
sector are very significant, and potentially transformative, and it is important to note that at the time of 
preparation of the PRS2 and CAS, the full extent and potential of the extractive reserves were neither 
fully realized, nor understood (as a result the CAS has little mention of the extractives sector) and the 
sheer rapidity of these developments is noteworthy.  These developments also come with significant 
downside risks, which are examined  later on in the report.  Sierra Leone‘s candidacy under the Extractive 
Industry Transparency Initiative (EITI) has been extended until December 2012.    Toward achieving this 
goal, the government has completed the staffing and housing of the EITI Secretariat, drafted an EITI Bill, 
begun the reconciliation process to produce the Second Report that will cover 2008, 2009, and 2010, and 
is in the process of recruiting a validator.  A new online Mining Cadastre is expected to improve 
transparency regarding mining licences. 

7. 
Economic diversification takes on added significance in light of the likely extractives boom.  
The agriculture sector has shown potential for being the driver of an ‗inclusive growth‘ strategy, with the 
government‘s Smallholder Commercialization Program now being implemented across the country.  The 
prospects of increasing agriculture productivity starting from the current low base e.g. rice average yields 
are low at 1 ton/ha, are enormous. Studies show that post-harvest losses in the sector amount to about 40 
percent, due to lack of value addition and transportation.  The ongoing risks associated with uncertain 

2 

 
land tenure systems, always a source of potential conflict, have been recently highlighted in connection 
with recent large-scale private investments. This needs to be addressed in order to ensure that the 
agriculture sector grows and benefits a large number of the population.  The fisheries sector could be 
another driver of growth, and the government has started to address the huge challenges of governance 
and illegal fishing.  During the CAS period, work on the policy, regulatory and institutional environment 
in the fisheries sector has been taken forward.  With strong government facilitation, other drivers of 
growth may emerge, which could also benefit as a result of the extractives boom, if funds are not spent on 
the recurrent side.  The diversification of economic activities will be key in creating jobs and improving 
livelihoods, as mining is unlikely to generate sustainable large-scale employment.     

8. 
Progress is being made on most Millenium Development Goals (MDGs), but Sierra Leone is 
unlikely to meet most of the MDGs by the target date of 2015.  The ongoing analysis of the 2011 
Integrated Household Survey data will provide the latest poverty data. While it is expected to show a 
decline in poverty levels, it is unlikely that the country will meet the MDG target of 40 percent of the 
population living below the poverty line by 2015.  The latest comparable data is for 2003, i.e. soon after 
the conflict, which showed poverty rates of 67 percent.  Likewise, as per the latest available data, the 
education and health MDGs are unlikely to be achieved. The country appears to be on-track for meeting 
the gender equality MDG for primary education and the HIV prevalence rate.  Considerable progress is 
being made with other MDGs, but as noted earlier, the civil conflict through the 1990s has had a 
significant impact on Sierra Leone.  Making faster progress towards the MDGs takes on added 
importance in order for the extractives boom to result in broad-based growth.  

9. 
Nonetheless, Sierra Leone has made concerted efforts to address off-track MDGs, especially 
on mortality. Further strengthening of delivery systems and citizen accountability will be crucial in 
making rapid progress.  Strikingly, the country‘s mortality numbers have only recently declined to the 
levels, which existed before the onset of the civil war.  The maternal mortality rates in 2010 are about the 
same as in 1990, as they had spiked by 2000 due to the civil war.  Sierra Leone has in fact lost two 
decades in making improvements in maternal mortality, as a result of the conflict.  Since the start of the 
CAS, the country introduced the Free Health Care Initiative (FHCI) for pregnant and lactating mothers 
and children under five. While the initial period of FHCI proved to be a ‗shock‘ to the health system, its 
implementation seems to have stabilized but is facing capacity and implementation challenges.  The 
financial sustainability of FHCI, beyond the current support by development partners, needs to be 
urgently examined.  More recent efforts by GoSL to engage citizens and give them greater authority to 
hold health service providers accountable is promising, and could well be critical in achieving significant 
progress towards reducing maternal and infant mortality rates in the country. Existing partnerships are 
underway on assisting governments to better harness the private sector in order to improve  the quality of 
health care for the poor.  

10. 
Decentralized service delivery continues to be a key element in improving basic services in 
education, health and water and sanitation, and the time may be ripe for further deepening of the 
decentralization process.  In many ways, Sierra Leone‘s progress on decentralization could hold useful 
lessons for other post-conflict countries, especially in terms of deconcentrating powers by devolving 
responsibilities to local authorities, improving service delivery, and strengthening accountability.  A 
majority of the functions envisaged for devolution under the 2004 Local Government Act (LGA) have 
been devolved to Local Councils.  The third round of elections of Local Councils, since the LGA are 
planned for late-2012, as part of the national elections. Satisfaction levels with quality services provided 
by elected councilors are likely to be a key determinant in voter preferences.  Recent discussions amongst 
stakeholders have highlighted that the aftermath of elections could be a good time to revisit the LGA and 
reflect upon lessons from experience, in order to deepen the devolution process.  Such a review should 
look at devolving authority over line agency staff to Local Councils, and further refine the inter-
governmental fiscal transfer arrangements on the basis of a full understanding of local revenue collection 

3 

 
and management.  The opportunities provided through the decentralization process to actively engage 
with citizens and promote social accountability are being taken forward and are expected to continue. 

11. 
There is a strong recognition in the country of the need to address the challenges of jobs, 
especially for youth.  According to demographic data, about one-third of Sierra Leone‘s population is in 
the 15-35 year age group, of which an estimated 40 to 50 percent are considered unemployed and 
underemployed.  With prospects of rising national wealth from the extractives sector, youth expectations 
are only going to rise, with a risk of social and political alienation if such expectations are not met.  
However, the extractives sector is likely to employ only a few thousand people, as the iron -ore projects 
currently employ only about 5,000 workers.  This generation suffered from the civil war and did not have 
education opportunities, so they may not possess the necessary skills needed for the job market.  During 
the CAS period, the government has prepared a new Employment Policy, set up a dedicated Youth 
Ministry and a National Youth Commission, and taken forward targeted youth employment programs. 
Nonetheless, the challenge of youth unemployment remains enormous.   

12. 
Gender equality continues to be a challenge, as well as reducing the unacceptably high rates 
of maternal mortality in the country.  The FHCI is targeting the latter challenge, although there is a 
continuing need for citizen engagement in order to increase accountability and service delivery around the 
FHCI.  During the CAS period, the government has prepared a National Gender Strategic Plan, but 
implementing it requires resources and capacity.  The Sexual Offenses Bill has been submitted to 
Parliament to address the issue of gender-based violence.  In the political sphere, an active lobby is urging 
a 30 percent representation of women4 in the upcoming national elections – whether Parliament will enact 
the necessary legislation in time for the elections remains uncertain.  A recent assessment on the barriers 
to economic inclusion of women shows that Sierra Leone compares favorably with many African 
countries in ensuring that the laws do not differentiate between men and women in terms of their ability to 
work and run a business5. However, customs and traditional practices do not always allow equal 
opportunities for women.  Further, studies to date on decentralization have found that citizens, and 
women in particular, lack the confidence in engaging authorities and demanding better governance. Yet, 
gender equity has progressed well with 49 percent of pupils in primary education being girls and 45 
percent in secondary education, but this ratio drops at the tertiary level. There remains a critical need to 
ensure that Sierra Leone‘s development progress accrues to women as well as men.       

13. 
Private sector activity has increased significantly with continuing improvements in the 
investment climate.  The country‘s Doing Business scores have improved significantly during the CAS 
period, and in the 2012 Doing Business report, Sierra Leone was ranked among the top ten global 
reformers.  These improvements would need to be sustained for at least the next five years in order for the 
country to become one of the investment destinations in Africa.  In recent years, besides the extractives 
sector, there have been large private investments in the agriculture and hospitality sectors.  Feasibility 
studies are also currently underway for private investments in energy, including hydropower, 
infrastructure, including a new airport for Freetown, and manufacturing projects, including a possible 
steel plant.  At this stage, an important priority for the country is to increase its ability to attract quality 
investors, and ensure sufficient transparency and competitiveness in selecting them, as well as actively 
manage and enforce contractual obligations. If regulatory reforms and infrastructure deficits are 
addressed, then the private sector could be a big driver of growth, diversification and job creation. 

14. 
  The infrastructure destroyed during the civil war is currently being rebuilt, while at the 
same time infrastructure needs for the likely economic transformation require urgent attention.  
Infrastructure remains a binding constraint for growth and transformation – simulation studies indicate 
that if the country‘s infrastructure could be improved to the level of the African leader – Mauritius –

annual per capita growth rates could be 3.3 percentage points higher than those recorded in recent years.  
The total installed energy generation capacity in the country has increased to 90MW since the 
commissioning of the Bumbuna dam in late-2009.  At the same time, the national distribution network 
suffers from high technical and non-technical losses caused by lack of maintenance, overloading and 
inadequate metering, billing and revenue collection. Access to electricity is extremely low, at an 
estimated 6 percent of the population, while tariffs remains high even by regional standards. The National 
Power Agency (NPA) faces endemic structural and operational issues. Improving its technical and 
operational performance is a critical step to raising fiscal viability and overall performance of Sierra 
Leone‘s power sector.  The transport infrastructure has been upgraded during the CAS period, with most 
of the district headquarters being connected, and a number of urban roads being constructed and 
upgraded.  The network of feeder roads has expanded and is starting to show a positive impact on 
agricultural production and marketing. 

15. 
The recent track record on structural reforms has been mixed, and requires renewed 
government commitment in implementing the reforms.  Strengthening sector-level policy, regulatory 
and institutional structures in agriculture, fisheries, energy and water utilities, will be key to improving 
the efficiency and performance of different sectors, and thus further improving the prospects of economic 
diversification. Such reforms can help deliver improvements in efficiency in order to maintain high 
growth rates.  Sierra Leone rightly aspires to become a Middle Income Country (MIC), but structural and 
regulatory reforms would need to be undertaken for the country to become a MIC. During the CAS period 
there have been some important developments in this regard, like the implementation of the concession 
agreement for the container terminal at the port which is now being run by a private company.  There has 
also been progress in the liberalization of the telecommunications gateway, which could unlock the full 
potential of this key growth sector.  The Parliament has also passed new legislation to unbundle the 
electricity sector.  The law setting up an independent National Minerals Agency (NMA) has also been 
passed, which would now act as a regulator in the mineral sector.  Seeing through these and other reforms 
should put the economy in a better position to deliver on the ambitious vision of the government.  
Independent regulatory oversight is being strengthened in some sectors, which is key in ensuring that 
costs and inefficiencies are not passed on to consumers.  

16. 
Sierra Leone needs significant financial resources for meeting its development needs, and 
must look for innovative ways for raising such resources, even before the mining revenues start 
materializing. Over the next three to four years, the country would need significant resources for 
rehabilitating and upgrading the infrastructure in the country, e.g. upgrading electricity distribution in the 
capital of Freetown would require slightly less  than $170m.  Electricity generation for meeting the needs 
of the urban population alone would require another $300m.  Additionally, the energy and transportation 
needs of the mining sector are substantial, requiring billions of dollars in investment. One way to respond 
to this challenge would be to develop infrastructure for multiple users, e.g. shared transportation 
arrangement for mineral resources and possibly for multiple uses e.g. ports, which can be used for mineral 
exports and other potential economic activities.  The government recognizes these challenges, and has 
recently embarked on a process of holding a series of ‗Public – Private Sector Roundtables‘ for finding 
solutions to some of the binding constraints in achieving the economic transformation.   

17. 
The end-2012 national elections are critical in ensuring that the country continues on the 
path to development and economic transformation.  For the first time, Sierra Leone will be holding 
four elections, simultaneously at the end of 2012 – Presidential, Parliamentary, Local Council 
Chairpersons and Council representatives. The first-ever biometric voter registration process has been 
completed and around 2.7 million registered voters are expected to be issued voter registration cards.  
These cards should enhance the likelihood of fair and smooth elections.  However, sporadic political 
violence among supporters of the political parties in recent months has underscored the risks of possible 
violence and voter intimidation during the elections, and all stakeholders have a responsibility in ensuring 

5 

 
violence-free elections.  The political landscape is dominated by two political parties largely drawing 
support along regional and ethnic lines.  In recent months new legislation has confirmed the exact role of 
the National Election Commission.  An election basket fund of around $38m with contributions from the 
government and development partners is being used to finance the elections. 

18. 
The governance and anti-corruption agenda continues to experience serious challenges.  On 
the positive side, according to some of the international benchmarks, there have been some improvements 
in the fight against corruption and the overall governance trajectory. In the Transparency International‘s 
Corruption Perception Index (CPI), Sierra Leone has moved from a score of 2.2 in 2009 (global rank of 
146) to 2.5 in 2011 (global rank of 134).  In the latest CPI assessment, it ranks 26 th among 48 African 
countries.  The 2011 Mo Ibrahim Index ranks Sierra Leone 30 th out of 53 countries with a score of 
48.2/100.  Yet, there remains significant frustration within the population at the slow pace of institutional, 
legislative and systemic improvements to tackle corruption. Recent setbacks with some high profile 
prosecution cases reinforce the perceptions that some of the elite are not impacted. Although the asset and 
income declaration system has undergone some improvements, a comprehensive Politically Exposed 
Persons (PEP‘s) list still does not exist, as required by international law. The passage of the Anti Money 
Laundering/Combatting the Financing of Terrorism Act was delayed and was only enacted in early 2012.  
The need for transparency and accountability, as well as more effective tools and safeguards to fight 
corruption is only likely to increase exponentially with the extractives boom, and improvements in 
systems and enforcement capacity needs sustained action. The Government will need to put in place a 
strong framework for public procurement to ensure value for money and give confidence to investors and 
citizens alike.  On the positive side, space continues to exist for civil society and non state actors to 
openly engage on issues that are of public concern - the World Governance Indicators 2010 (Figure 1) 
give Sierra Leone a percentile ranking of 41.7 for Voice and Accountability, which is better than the 
average of 33 percentile ranking for SSA – this should be an important element in strengthening the 
accountability agenda going forward.   

Figure 1: Benchmarking Sierra Leone on Governance Indicators 

19. 
The CAS period has seen renewed momentum in addressing public sector capacity and 
performance challenges.  Prior to the conflict, technical and administrative capacity was severely 
depleted within government and outside, and the war further exacerbated this situation.  Subsequent 
government and development partner efforts have not systematically addressed the need for building a 
public sector that is meeting present day needs of the country.  During the CAS period, there has been a 
renewed emphasis and a more coherent approach between key stakeholders to start addressing 
systematically the issue of efficiency, capacity, and effectiveness of the public sector, and its ability to 

6 

 
 
attract and retain quality professionals.  The Cabinet approved a ‗Mul ti-Year Pay Reform Strategy‘ in 
2011, and a ‗Program for Improving Public Sector Productivity through Management and Pay Reforms‘ 
in 2012. These are important developments in taking forward the public sector reform agenda, but 
implementation will be crucial and will require continued commitment at all levels of government and the 
ability to address some difficult reforms.   

20. 
The sub-region has enjoyed relative peace and stability during the CAS period, raising 
hopes of enhanced regional cooperation6.  Neighboring Guinea and Liberia have had recent elections, 
and are also experiencing varying degrees of extractive sector booms.  Sierra Leone enjoys peaceful 
relations with its neighbors, and has been an active member of sub-regional groups such as the Economic 
Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and the Mano River Union.  Opportunities for regional 
cooperation are enormous, and are only starting to be realized, for example through new power pool 
agreements.  Road connectivity with neighboring countries has also been upgraded.  There is unexploited 
potential for economic diversification and developing regional transportation infrastructure, i.e. railways 
and ports, around the mining growth corridors among these neighboring countries. 

III. PROGRESS TOWARDS CAS OUTCOMES AND PORTFOLIO PERFORMANCE 

A. Progress against CAS Pillars: Human Development and Inclusive Growth 

21. 
Progress against CAS objectives is satisfactory at this stage, with approximately 85 percent 
of indicators achieved or on track to be achieved, and only 5 percent of indicators unlikely to be 
achieved until the end of June 2013. Progress is equally promising for the two pillars of human 
development and inclusive growth.  Lack of data is an issue as 10 percent of the indicators do not have 
updated progress values, especially for Pillar 2. This is due to weak sectoral monitoring and evaluation 
(M&E) systems as identified by the « Managing for Development Results Cpacity Scan » (CAP Scan) 
fielded in Oct 2010 and facilitated by the Bank. Constraints persist in  project-related monitoring 
arrangements and implementation. The achievement of CAS milestones lags behind, as slightly over 50 
percent have been achieved, which could be attributed to a lack of alignment between indicators and 
milestones7 during the design of the CAS.  Of the cross-cutting indicators on gender and governance, 
which are a sub-set of the overall set of indicators, more than 80 percent have been achieved or are on 
track to be achieved, which is noteworthy. World Bank TA support to Statistics Sierra Leone (SSL) has 
been targeted at specific areas, including in the analysis of the Integrated Household Living Conditions 
Survey.  Going forward, discussions would be carried out on providing more coordinated support for 
SSL.  

6 During the CAS period, Cote d’Ivoire and Mali have witnessed conflict, but the impact on Sierra Leone seems to 
have been limited so far. 
7 The milestones are to be reviewed at CAS mid -point, and are not included in the forward-looking Results Matrix 
(Annex 1b).

The WBG country program has strengthened the focus on the delivery of results.  The 
introduction of Performance Based Financing in the health sector has enhanced incentives for service 
providers, and has started showing improvements in the level and quality of services provided by clinics 
(Reproductive and Child Health Project Phase 2).  Addressing the value chain in the agriculture sector is 
demonstrating a positive impact on the livelihoods of farmers being supported all along the value chain 
(Rural & Private Sector Development Project).  There is also greater attention to selectivity in the Bank‘s 
program with recent exits from urban and water sectors.  There has also been a strategic use of Technical 
Assistance (TA) in helping with the production of vital statistical data from the household living 
conditions survey, and for it to inform the preparation of the PRS3.  The Bank will also help strengthen 
the results focus in the PRS3, specifically through the preparation of the Results Framework for PRS3.            

23.  
IFC, together with the Department for International Development (DfID) completed the 
implementation of the “Removing Administrative Barriers to Investment” (RABI) program during 
the CAS period.  The three year investment climate program focused on improving the business climate 
as measured by ―Doing Business‖, enhancing the image of Sierra Leone as a destination for productive 
investment and developing institutions that support private sector development.  Furthermore, building on 
its partnership with other partners, IFC, DfID, the Soros Economic Development Fund and Germany‘s 
Gesellshaft für Internationale Zusammenheit have supported the annual Business Plan Competition 
(Business Bomba).  In addition IFC continues to coordinate the PSD Donor Coordination Group .  The 
group meets regularly to ensure alignment among partners, as well as with GoSL priorities.  The funding 
for most of IFC‘s advisory activities in Sierra Leone is from the Conflict Affected States Initiative 
(CASA) which is a multi-donor facility with funding from The Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Ireland 
and the United Kingdom.  IFC and the Bank are currently coordinating efforts to address the needs of the 
energy sector.   

24. 
During the first two years of the CAS period, other parts of the World Bank Group have 
contributed significantly to the CAS outcomes.  MIGA issued guarantees to four projects with a total 
investment volume of US$7.8 million.  MIGA covered investors from Switzerland, Denmark and 
Mauritius and investments were made to a mobile payment and banking services provider, a transport and 
logistics firm, a vehicle importer, and a liquefied petroleum gas distributor. All guarantees were 
underwritten under MIGA‘s Small Investment Program. Going forward, MIGA will continue to maintain 
an active pipeline and will seek to support further and catalyze foreign investment that promotes

employment and growth.  The World Bank Institute (WBI) has undertaken innovative work in the areas 
of access to information by supporting the Access to Information Bill, which has just been resubmitted to 
Parliament after it had lapsed, strengthening Parliamentary engagement, especially capacity of the Public 
Accounts Committee, and supporting reforms in procurement and contract monitoring by CSOs, 
especially in the roads sector. WBI will launch a Leadership for Results Program in support of the new 
Pay and Performance Project.  

25. 
The World Bank Group has deepened its partnership with other development partners, and 
has become the largest donor in Sierra Leone.  As per MoFED figures, during the CAS period the 
World Bank has been the single largest development partner in Sierra Leone, with a share of 22 percent of 
total aid disbursements (see Annex 14).  The World Bank, AfDB, DFID and the European Union carry 
out joint assessments for budget support and coordinate the dialogue with GoSL under the Multi -Donor 
Budget Support (MDBS) framework.  The Bank, as the lead partner in the energy sector, has initiated a 
sector coordination group with the Ministry of Energy and Water Resources.  The Bank actively 
facilitated the formation of a Development Partner Governance and Accountability Working Group to 
discuss strategic and technical issues in governance among partners and then, directly with GoSL 
counterpart institutions.  The Bank manages co-financed activities in the areas of PFM, decentralization 
and extractive industries.  Partnership with the UN has deepened and joint analytical work is being 
considered, as well as using UN systems for implementing some elements of Bank-supported programs.  
The Bank and the UN also co-chair the Development Partners Coordination Committee and quarterly 
meetings are chaired by the Minister of Finance and Economic Development.  The dialogue with non 
state actors has been enhanced through a specific focus on the extractives sector, governance and 
transparency.   

B. Portfolio Performance 

26. 
The Sierra Leone portfolio is performing well and has achieved consistently above-average 
disbursement rates. During the CAS period, it has made striking progress in addressing „problem 
projects‟.  The Sierra Leone Portfolio is currently comprised of 17 large active investment operations 
with net commitments reaching US$350 million. In addition, IDA has provided US$51 million as budget 
support during FY10-12. The World Bank extends its support through various instruments ranging from 
budget support, investment lending, technical assistance and knowledge products.  As of the end of March 
2012, the undisbursed balance under the portfolio was US$99.4 million.  The portfolio is currently sound 
with no overage project and low commitments at risk.  Four projects including the Bumbuna Environment 
and Social Sector Investment Loan, GEF Biodiversity, Wetlands Conservation and the Education Fast 
Track Initiative (EFA/FTI) Projects show marginally satisfactory ratings. In terms of Development 
Objectives (DO) and Implementation Performance (IP), about 76 percent of the projects are rated 
satisfactory including one operation being highly satisfactory and 24 percent of the projects are currently 
rated as marginally satisfactory, with only one operation rated unsatisfactory.  Going into the CAS, about 
50 percent of the projects in the country portfolio were ‗problem projects‘ (60 percent of the amount was 
under ‗problem project‘ category), and this figure has been sharply reduced to 0 percent in FY12 (Annex 
8).  Sierra Leone‘s better than average performance in the Africa Region can be attributed to several 
factors including sound project design and Monitoring and Evaluation /Results Frameworks, satisfactory 
PMU performance, effective and efficient supervision and implementation support by task teams, and 
effective working relationships with Government counterparts.  The Bank‘s Country Office now includes 
a team of staff covering most sectors, who can help the country program move to true ‗implementation 
support‘.  

27. Most of the projects in the portfolio face risks related to the Country Environment .   Long 
term risks have been identified under the Rural and Private Sector Development Project due to 
outstanding issues in clarifying implementation arrangements.  These are expected nonetheless to be 

9 

 
 
 
resolved soon.  Other risks under the portfolio include effectiveness delays, as under the Extractive 
Industries Technical Assistance Project and the Youth Employment Support Project.  Issues related to 
legal covenants are being addressed under the Bumbuna Environment and Social Sector Project, as well 
as under the Financial Sector Support Technical Assistance Operation.  Project management and fiduciary 
issues are currently being tackled under the EFA/FTI Education Program.  Finally, the Financial Sector 
Support Project was declared effective on July 20, 2011 and disbursements are expected to start, soon. A 
recent review of financial management arrangements under Community Driven Development type 
projects did not raise any significant fiduciary concerns.  

28. 
The Trust Fund Portfolio in Sierra Leone is relatively large with 36 active Recipient 
Executed Trust Funds (TFs), 27 of which are Multi-Donor Trust Funds (TfS).  Several recent TFs 
have helped leverage the small IDA national allocation and promote CAS objectives. In FY11, the Bank 
was able to leverage the national IDA allocation by three times through Regional IDA allocations and 
Trust Funds.  More recent TFs have been selected strategically to fit into country program priorities, and a 
continued close scrutiny of new TFs has helped limit supply-driven initiatives.  Total commitments under 
the Trust Fund Portfolio currently stand at approximately US$96 million with about US$37million 
disbursed to date. While a number of these Trust Funds are associated wi th an active IDA operation, 
others have been approved as stand-alone Trust Funds in support of Technical Assistance and Institutional 
Reforms, Governance, as well as development activities in the Social Sectors, including provision of 
Safety Nets and Reproductive Health, the Extractive Industries, Education, Energy and Infrastructure.   

29. 
During the CAS period major adjustments have been made to 
implementation 
arrangements following a Country Portfolio Performance Review (CPPR) in 2011 and a mini-
CPPR in early 2012.  Significant actions have been taken following the CPPR to strengthen the 
effectiveness and impact of the Bank‘s program.  Among the noteworthy actions  already  taken:  (i)  
Bank budget support was moved as of 2012 to the first quarter of the GoSL financial year to enhance  
predictability (budget support during the past five years had been disbursed at the end of GoSL fiscal 
year); (ii) the IPFMRP project implementation was mainstreamed  at the Ministry of Finance and 
Economic Development to limit stand alone Project Implementation Units; (iii) a sharper focus was 
placed on results and accountability through initiatives such as Result-Based Financing in health and 
review of social accountability in the country program; (iv) the focus on innovation was strengthened 
such as through the ongoing mapping of facilities providing basic services to strengthen planning and 
accountability; and (v) regular training sessions by Bank staff of procurement staff in project 
implementation agencies.  These actions have substantially enhanced the results-focus of the Bank‘s work 
in Sierra Leone.  The next CPPR is planned for early 2013, and it is expected to inform the preparation of 
the next CAS.  

30. 
IFC continues to support Sierra Leone‟s efforts to improve the business environment and 
the country was named as one of the global top reformers in Doing Business 2012.  IFC supported the 
Credit Reference Act and the development of a private credit bureau in Sierra Leone.  During the CAS 
period, IFC in collaboration with the Bank of Sierra Leone (BSL) developed the leasing framework, 
which enables BSL to supervise leasing companies.   Business Edge (―BE‖) and the SME Toolkit were 
launched on March 03, 2010 and implementation of Business Edge is in full gear.  Four consulting firms 
have been chosen as Business Edge franchisees and IFC supported ―Business Bomba‖, a countrywide 
Business Plan Competition.  In addition, IFC has provided lines of up to US$1 million each to the Sierra 
Leone Commercial Bank and Rokel Commercial Bank under the Global Trade Finance Program (GTFP), 
both of which are state-owned banks. Nonetheless, both banks have been repeatedly noncompliant with 
IFC‘s financial covenants and the trade lines to both SLCB and RCB were frozen in November 2009.  
EcoBank SL also received approval for an IFC GTFP trade line of up to US$2 mill ion in available trade 
support, which will help foster external trade. IFC is also considering a US$5 million line of credit to 
Union Trust Bank to enhance support to Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in Sierra Leone.   

10 

 
31.  
In recognition of the capital constraints of SMEs, IFC developed an initiative (IFC 
Ventures) to provide risk capital and advisory services to small businesses in challenging countries . 
Sierra Leone is one of the four beneficiaries of IFC ventures with an initial investment of US$13.5 
million. The long-term goal of the SME Ventures Program is to help revive the private sector, which was 
seriously destroyed by more than 10 years of civil war. In the manufacturing sector, IFC committed a 
US$110 million equity investment in Heidelberg Cement to modernize and increase the capacity of the 
company's operations in 7 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, including Sierra Leone.  IFC‘s Asset 
Management Company (AMC) also supported this transaction with a US$35 million equity investment.  
In 2011, IFC concluded a $2.8 million loan to Vitafoam Nigeria to expand its operations to Sierra Leone. 
The Vitafoam Sierra Leone Limited project involves US$6.3 million new foam production and a related 
products plant in Freetown for local sales in Sierra Leone and for exports to Liberia and Guinea.    

C. 

Lessons Learned 

32. 
A number of lessons have emerged from the CAS implementation, some of which may have 
wider resonance for other post-conflict countries.  First, during the CAS period, Sierra Leone would 
be making a transition out of the FCS category – it has moved out of the category of countries receiving 
exceptional allocations but  still has low CPIA score.  Experiences in successfully moving countries out 
of the FCS group are still limited, so for the international community Sierra Leone could be an interesting 
case study to focus attention and learn  lessons.  Second, this is the first Joint Country Assistance Strategy 
for the WBG and AfDB in Sierra Leone.  It has provided opportunities for the two institutions to work 
together and develop synergies – but deriving optimal benefits of such joint strategies requires 
governments to effectively lead donor coordination processes at the sector level, and also requires 
sufficient forward planning in order to allow joint missions (the MDBS and education sectors are 
undertaking joint assessments).  Third, Sierra Leone will continue to require the full menu of support 
instruments available to the Bank – financing quality knowledge products and convening power.  In 
sectors, like health, where the Bank is increasingly combining them, the nature of the dialogue with the 
government has changed qualitatively.  Fourth, low institutional capacity in government and fiduciary 
risks are continuing concerns with portfolio management.  This can often shape the full nature of our 
dialogue, unless efforts are made at several ends to move the agenda forward e.g. ongoing work with the 
Auditor General‘s Office and with the National Public Procurement Agency (NPPA) to address some of 
the underlying systemic issues is now a key area of Bank attention, and the ACC is supported through an 
IDF Capacity Building Grant to improve the quality of system and process reviews and the monitoring 
and compliance responsibilities of both the ACC and the respective MDAs. Finally, the challenge of 
collective action (i.e. different agencies pulling together in delivering on an agenda) both within 
government and within sector teams in donor institutions does require continuing facilitation and use of 
‗soft skills‘ – e.g. as WBI‘s Leadership for Results‘ efforts in order to facilitate collective action in the 
area of public sector reforms could hold useful lessons.  Sierra Leone will require such ‗soft‘ initiatives in 
order for a smooth economic transformation.                 

IV.   ADJUSTMENTS TO THE CAS MOVING FORWARD 

33. 
The CAS objectives and priorities remain fully relevant, but two important adjustments are 
being proposed in light of the significant changes in the country context and key lessons learned, so 
far.  The CAS priorities were fully aligned to the Agenda for Change (PRS2) priorities, and both pillars – 
human development and promoting inclusive growth remain priority development challenges for the 
country.  So the Bank would continue to support these pillars during the remaining CAS period.  The 
Agenda for Change is for the period 2007–2012, and the government has currently initiated work on the 
successor PRS3, which is expected to be finalized in early 2013.  An initial concept note for PRS3 
recognizes that PRS3 does not just represent an incremental change in light of the changes in the country 
context, principally the new developments in the extractives sector.  The outline of PRS3 places emphasis 
on: managing the resource boom; economic diversification and jobs; improving competitiveness; human 

11 

 
development; social protection; and governance and transparency.  In light of the changes in the country 
context and as a segway into the next CAS, the Progress Report proposes to make some important 
adjustments for the remainder of the CAS period. 

34. 
The first adjustment is about adding a third pillar to the CAS on “Managing the extractives 
boom”.  This would align the CAS more fundamentally to the opportunities and risks of the extractives 
boom and also to the early vision set out in the draft PRS3 – the Bank would thus be ‗ahead of the curve‘ 
in making an important contribution towards smooth transformation, and this would enhance the overall 
Bank impact in Sierra Leone.  Some of these changes have already started happening in the Bank 
program.  The growth in the extractives sector described more fully in Annex 2 provides a once -in-a-
generation opportunity for Sierra Leone to aspire to Middle Income Country status, but at the same time it 
comes with significant downside risks relating to the ‗resource curse‘ given that the country‘s recent 
tragic history of conflict has had some links with the minerals sector.  The Progress Report proposes that 
smooth economic transformation and managing the risks  will require addressing five priority areas.  
Figure 2 provides a framework for looking at the economic transformation.  The specific activities being 
supported by the Bank during the remainder of the CAS period are described below.  This support would 
be provided through targeted instruments:  IDA and Trust Fund resources, restructuring of ongoing 
projects to address emerging challenges, provision of high-impact knowledge products, and enhanced 
policy engagement between stakeholders.  Selectivity in the program is being strengthened by using this 
framework to understand the relevance and strategic importance of existing and new Bank operations. 

i. 
Strengthening the regulatory and institutional capacity in the extractives sector: in recognition of 
changes taking place in the extractives sector, the Bank program has scaled-up its engagement with the 
extractives sector.  An IDA Additional Financing and a co-financing with DFID were undertaken in FY12 
which are now helping GoSL to strengthen the regulatory and institutional capacity within government to 
manage the sector effectively.  In addition, the Bank is providing experts to strengthen the capacity in 
government to negotiate mining licenses.  The budget support program is also starting to focus on the 
policy areas in the extractives sector.  Together, these constitute important elements of the Bank support 
during the remainder of the CAS period. 

ii. 
Economic diversification through private sector development and establishment of ‗growth 
poles‘: The appreciation of the real exchange rate which could result from the impending extractives 
sector boom would render many tradeable sectors uncompetitive unless special efforts are made to 
strengthen productivity, promote economic diversification especially in sectors less vulnerable to trade 
competition and to strengthen significantly and expand the pool of skilled labor.  The significant 
resources which this will require could well be sourced from the windfall revenues associated with the 
extractives boom.  Sectors like agriculture, tourism and fisheries may offer some possibilities for 
economic diversification and therefore broader based growth, but this will be critically dependent on 
maintaining and deepening competitiveness and increasing productivity.  During the remainder of the 
CAS period, the Bank will support the government with knowledge products which could help identify 
opportunities for economic diversification and making full use of ‗corridor development‘ and ‗growth 
poles‘ (see Figure 3).  Through updating the Diagnostic Trade Integration Study (DTIS), another 
analytical product will be to look at specific issues of competitiveness in some of the potential growth 
sectors.  This could inform future government plans and also identify private sector opportunities. 

iii. 
Infrastructure for the extractives sector:  The growth and expansion plans of the iron-ore 
companies require timely provision of reliable energy and transportation infrastructure (to get the ore to 
the port and adequate port facilities to export).  The practice of balkanizing infrastructure planning and 
provisions may not be in the best long-term interest of the country, particularly given the potentially large 
number of mining licenses and operators.  Through Bank support the government has started a process of 
‗Public-Private Sector Roundtables‘ to address some binding constraints for private sector development 
with the first focusing on infrastructure. There would also be  an opportunity to strengthen regional 

12 

 
 
infrastructure linkages with Guinea and Liberia for iron-ore production. The Bank will also be providing 
‗just in time‘ advice to the government to look at options for having multiple -use and multiple-user 
infrastructure and innovative options for financing such infrastructure.  The government would need to 
continue to lead the process of infrastructure development from the perspective of the broader needs of 
the country.  

Figure 2: What is involved in successful economic transformation 

iv. 
Revenue management  and governance: Transparency will be key for Sierra Leone to avoid the 
risks of the ‗resource curse‘.  The Bank will continue to support the EITI process with enhanced provision 
for CSO engagement, and support through measures like disseminating the Citizens Budget, and contract 
monitoring initiatives. The Bank will be providing TA on strengthening the Public Investment 
Management capacity, and to help the government generate options for managing the fiscal space.   

v. 

Effective use of revenues to deliver results: Especially in the human development sector, 

13 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the Bank will be providing TA and undertaking knowledge work to help the government prepare strong 
credible sector plans and expenditure frameworks in anticipation of rising domestic revenues.  
Specifically, this would be focused on health financing issues and opportunities for scaling-up safety nets, 
including addressing youth employment from prospective revenues.   In addition, knowledge work in the 
education sector would help the government prepare skilled workers for the emerging job market.

35. 
The second adjustment is about putting emphasis on building capacity for improved 
governance and service delivery within government and within civil society – in other words 
emphasizing both the „supply‟ and „demand‟ side of good governance.  Ten years after the end of 
conflict, it is important to address the severe deficits in public sector capacity and performance.  Rising 
revenues will further stretch the already limited capacity of the public sector.  Following a recent request 
from GoSL, the Bank has started engaging in the area of public sector reforms – an area not identified as 
a priority for the Bank under the CAS.  But given the pressing needs in this sector, the Bank has prepared 
an innovative results-based operation, the ―Pay and Performance Project‖ (see text box).  This operation 
is likely to be central in helping the government deliver on its reform agenda.  This project would work in 
close synergy with other sector operations of the Bank so that the reforms being taken forward at the 
central level start demonstrating impact at the level of ind ividual Ministries and Agencies of the 
government.  At another level, a recent review of social accountability / Demand for Good Governance 
(DFGG) work in the Bank‘s program in Sierra Leone has identified opportunities for the Bank to support 
the government‘s growing commitment to engage citizens as partners in monitoring development.  Annex

New iron ore & bauxite projectsOil ExplorationDiamond Mining (mostly artisanal)Gold Mining (mostly artisanal)New agribusiness projectsNOTES:A ‘growth pole’ is a geographic location where productive economic activities are rapidly expanding fueled by a combination of economies of scale, economies of agglomeration, and backward/forward linkages. Potential ‘growth poles’ could be around the north / west where the iron ore and agricultural projects are located, and in the south around commercial mining, agribusiness and potential hydrocarbon resources.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
3 spells out these opportunities in detail, but Bank support in strengthening social accountability will now 
focus on promoting accountability in the ‗policy space‘, re inforcing citizens accountability to improve 
health sector outcomes, and improving coherence and knowledge-sharing on DFGG across Bank 
operations.  For example, in the health sector, Sierra Leone still lags behind in meeting the MDGs, 
accountability gaps with the FHCI have been documented, and the government has shown a keen interest 
in engaging citizens to improve service delivery. This sector may present a key opportunity for 
strengthened DFGG engagement.   

Box: The Pay and Performance Project: The Bank Responding Strategically and Innovatively 

IDA has initiated its involvement in public service reform in Sierra Leone with the US$17 million Pay 
and Performance Project. The Project supports and is fully aligned with the Government‘s flagship 
program ―Improving Productivity through Management and Pay Reforms‖ and it focuses on the three 
reform areas in the government‘s program: (i) Pay Reform; (ii) Recruitment and Staffing; and (iii) 
Performance Management and Accountability.  

The Project uses a results-based approach that rewards the achievement of an agreed set of key milestones 
and results through the use of Disbursement Linked Indicators (DLIs). The objective of the pay reform 
sub-component is to improve external competitiveness and internal equity to enable the public service to 
attract and retain qualified professionals. The objective of the recruitment and staffing sub -component is 
to increase the very low numbers in middle and senior level positions. Between 800-1000 critical 
positions in the ―missing middle‖ will be filled via open, competitive and merit-based procedures. The 
objective of the performance management and accountability sub-component is to improve government 
productivity, increase citizens‘ trust in government and institutionalize transparency and accountability. A 
flexible Technical Assistance component complements the results-based approach by financing selected 
interventions (strategic communications program and social accountability measures).  

This operation is an excellent example of how the Bank has strategically and innovatively responded to 
government request for support.  A strong public sector is key to smooth economic transformation, and 
the Bank has built upon global experiences with public sector operations in preparing this project.   

36. 
These adjustments would bring the CAS in closer alignment with the Bank‟s new Africa 
Strategy.  The proposed adjustments to the CAS lay emphasis on three priorities in the Africa Strategy 
‗Africa‘s Future and World Bank‘s Role in It‘ – competitiveness and employment; vulnerability and 
resilience; and governance and public sector capacity.  The forward-looking results matrix in Annex 1A 
covers FY13 and includes only indicators for the WBG, that is the World Bank and IFC. AfDB is not 
included.  To the results matrix, the following changes have been made: Primary Gross Enrol lment Rate 
(PGER) has been replaced with Primary Completion Rate (PCR) as PGER data are unreliable and with 
significant overestimation of enrolment numbers. PCR is a better measure of efficiency and quality. Spot 
checks for teacher attendance twice a term for each school in all districts by 2013 has been dropped as it 
is not related to the WBG program. Since there is no law in place on the free health care initiative 
enforcement, the related indicator has been replaced by an indicator on social accountability monitoring.  
The indicator from the energy sector has been dropped due to unavailability of data and so has the 
indicator for the transport sector related trunk roads in good and fair condition. In the cash-for-work 
programs, targets have been increased substantially. The indicator on procurement contracts under 
decentralization has been dropped given the concerns over reliability of the data and the indicators on 
Local Councils and service output targets have been slightly reworded.  Under decentralization, an 
indicator on social accountability has been added to strengthen that aspect in the results matrix. An 
indicator on public disclosure of fishing licenses and revenues has been added to fisheries, and an 
indicator on collection rates to energy. Further, a third pillar has been added to the forward-looking matrix 

15 

 
 
 
 
 
regarding the new direction of the CAS to align to and support the sustainable management of natural 
resources, especially in mining. Four indicators have been added in this regard. 

V.    KEY CONSTRAINTS AND RISKS 

37. 
The risks identified in the CAS remain relevant, but there has been some improvement in 
some of the risks and Bank-supported mitigation measures are being implemented.  The six risks 
included in the CAS were: (i) weak governance and accountability structures; (ii) limited capacity to 
deliver services and manage public resources; (iii) youth employment and social instability; (iv) economic 
shocks; (v) regional volatility, including international drug trafficking; and (vi) climate change and 
disaster risks.  As noted earlier, during the CAS period the renewed emphasis on social accountability and 
promoting transparency would continue to be key in managing the weak governance and accountability 
structures, enforcement of systems, rules and procedures.  The Bank is now helping GoSL address more 
frontally the capacity and effectiveness of the public sector, through strategic responses under various 
projects e.g. in fisheries, decentralization, and public sector reforms.  The Youth Employment Support 
Project was prepared and delivered during the CAS period as a response to the challenge of youth 
unemployment, and the ongoing analytical work on review of safety net systems will be informing the 
government‘s plans in the PRS3.  The Bank increased the size of its budget support in response to the 
exogenous fuel and food price shock, and mobilized advice for government on short-term coping systems 
for the country.  The sub-region is now more peaceful and scope for cooperation has widened, although 
recent developments in the Liberia – Cote d‘Ivoire border underscore the fragility of peace in the sub-
region.  Nonetheless, these risks still remain valid for the remainder of the CAS period, and the Bank 
along with other partners would be helping the government manage them. 

38. 
An additional risk which is being identified at this stage of CAS implementation is about 
avoiding the „resource curse‟ as a result of the extractives boom.  This is likely to be the most 
significant development challenge for the country in the foreseeable future. Economic development in 
Sierra Leone could be affected by the dynamics of mineral sector growth.  Political lobbying and rivalries 
as well as social exclusion around extractives may also increase the risk of conflict. While infrastructure 
remains a binding constraint for growth, the mineral sector is like ly to divert human capital, 
entrepreneurial and investment resources from other sectors and lead to spatial disparities and regional 
tensions.  Effective collection of all revenues due to the state and allocation and distribution of 
government spending will need to be optimal across sectors to achieve economic efficiency and inclusive 
growth.  Before the receipt of large windfall revenues, monitoring of licenses and contracts, projects and 
operations will be necessary elements of a broader governance strategy to deal with the new challenges. 
The proposed adjustments to the CAS by adding a third pillar on ‗managing the extractives boom‘ should 
help the country manage this risk, especially anticipatory spending and pressures on the wage bill.  The 
Bank and partners will undertake further ‗fragility risk‘ assessments as a result of the resources boom, and 
this is expected to inform the preparation of the next CAS.

Annex 2: Post-Conflict Meets Resource-Rich: 

Strategic Priorities for Economic Management in the Era of “Iron Ore Economics” 

1. 
A rapidly changing economic environment requires a new strategic focus for economic development in Sierra 
Leone, particularly as it applies to financial and private sector development, extractive sector management and the 
economic policy and institutional agenda.  The impending boom in the mineral sector has far-reaching implications for the 
country‘s development trajectory.  Since the end of the civil war Sierra Leone has followed a gradual post -conflict 
recovery with two successive peaceful election cycles and averaged GDP growth of 6 percent.  Now the economy is 
poised to experience a major transformation:  The development of two large iron ore mining projects will lead to large 
one-off surge in real GDP and a significant surge in exports in 2012 and beyond12. Due to generous tax concessions, 
government revenue will increase only moderately in 2012 but more substantially from 2013 onwards.  While mining 
activity alone will be a game-changer for Sierra Leone, oil reserves in commercial quantities may be verified in the course 
of the year. 

2. 

These developments in the mineral sector confront Sierra Leone with significant opportunities and risks:   

 On the upside, mining can become a growth motor, spur private investment and provide the government with the 
resources it needs to implement its ambitious development agenda.  It provides opportunities for scaling -up 
public-private partnerships for infrastructure development as well as small and medium enterprise development 
linked to mining operations and targeted spatial economic development strategies around new growth poles. 

 On the downside, Sierra Leone has to confront the ‗resource curse‘ that has challenged many resource rich 
African countries.   In the past, Sierra Leone has failed to address these issues and the results have been poor 
development outcomes, high inequality and devastating conflict. The impact of the unprecedented growth shock 
puts significant demands on the Government to maintain macro economic stability, ensure good value for money 
in government expenditures, strengthen transparency and promote good governance.  Beyond the significant 
governance issues associated with managing resource revenues, the dynamics of mineral sector grow th could 
throw economic development off balance. The mineral sector is likely to divert human capital, entrepreneurial and 
investment resources from other sectors and could thereby undermine development strategies in other potential 
growth sectors such as agriculture, light manufacturing, tourism as well as commerce and services. Commodity 
price volatility, foreign currency inflows and a changing structure of the balance -of-payments will challenge 
macro economic management and financial sector capacity.  Social exclusion around extractives could increase 
the risk of instability, conflict and a disruption of revenue flows. 

Strengthening institutions and governance 

3. 

Institutional capacity needs to be built to ensure that benefits of the mineral sector are put to use to develop the 
rest of the economy and achieve inclusive growth in line with agreed priorities. The institutional development agenda is 
necessarily exhaustive and encompasses traditional public sector priorities like public financial management and 
governance as well as specific institutional capacity required to manage resource revenues and increase economic 
management capacity. Four key areas can be identified: 

Firstly, building and improving public financial management capacity remains a key priority as does public sector reform 
more broadly.  Further efforts in strengthening public financial management are required to strengthen the ability to 
manage public finances on a consistent basis and in-line with budgets approved by the legislature. Apart from deepening 
financial discipline this requires developing the skills and systems to ensure that the allocation and distribution of 
government spending is optimal across sectors, in order to achieve economic efficiency as well as effective collection of 
all revenues due to the state – openness and dialogue with citizens is essential in this regard. It also requires establishing a 
strong framework for public procurement to ensure value for money, and give confidence to investors and citizens alike. 
The public sector reform process to strengthen public sector effectiveness and improve its ability to deliver services must 

12 IMF projects a surge in GDP by 35% in 2012 and a fourfold increase in exports. Standard Chartered Bank is projecting 30% GDP 
growth in 2012. Estimates are driven by assumptions on iron prices and, more importantly, mining output in the initial phase of 
operation which is introducing some uncertainty around actual figures.  
32 

 
 
 
   
 
 
                                                      
be broadened and deepened.  A more effective public service will also mean more effective revenue collection, more 
effective monitoring of operations for health, safety and other regulatory requirements. As initiatives in these areas are 
already in place, Government needs to maintain the drive and pressure to develop the broad institutional agenda to ensure 
a strong and consistent measure of governance is embodied in them that will serve the public interest and stand the test of 
time. 

Secondly, governance issues are pertinent and have proven to be even more challenging for countries to address in these 
situations. Pressures to increase government spending, including public sector wages, will rise as will competition within 
society for access to resources. Licensing and contract award would attract undue attention and may become politicized 
due to the rent-seeking opportunities they present, and conflicts of interest would abound.  Groups on whose land the 
resources being exploited were discovered will demand that their rights under law be respected, the environmental and 
social costs of mining be minimized and benefits shared equitably within impacted populations .  All this leads to intense 
political lobbying and competition and could increase the risks of conflict. Increasing conflict stresses are already evident 
in combustible mining communities and will require careful management.  Citizens and communities will be most 
concerned about the environmental impacts and social disruption, distribution of revenues and in the outcomes through 
policies, programs and local level projects/development. Drawing on the experience of other countries a strong 
governance regime underpinned by a practice of accountability and  transparency at all stages, an absolute avoidance of 
conflicts of interest and the direct involvement of all stakeholders, especially community groups in every aspect — 
especially monitoring of licenses and contracts; monitoring of the projects and operations; collection and distribution of 
revenues; and the selection and implementation of projects  — are necessary elements of a broader governance strategy to 
deal with new challenges.  The key strategic priorities in this area are: 

 Licensing and contract negotiations.  Strengthen the process for awarding licenses and contracts by providing a 
strategic framework for integrating extractive industry development projects in the context of national planning 
initiatives. Establish an open and transparent process that utilizes international expertise in negotiations, which 
includes respected CSOs and development partners. Ensure that the integrity of the process is beyond reproach and 
that local communities have a say in it and are informed about developments that affect and change their lives .  

 Revenue Management and associated accountability mechanisms. Extensive public consultations with the 
population at large and political parties regarding the process of revenue management and the associated 
accountability mechanisms are needed to provide a robust accountability framework.  This should also include 
independent and regular public reporting on the accountability mechanisms and results.  Progress in revenue 
collection needs to be consolidated by reinforcing the monitoring function, particularly with respect to financial and 
technical audit of mining operations establishing mechanisms to undertake audits of mining firms by external auditors 
with respect to profit declarations and legal compensation and community development obligations. EITI validation 
and passing of the Sierra Leone EITI Bill will be important steps in improving extractive industry governance. 

 Control Corruption.  The impending extractives boom increases the risks of more corruption, since important 
systems are not yet in place to prevent, detect or deter it or the related money laundering.  Tools and mechanisms for 
prevention and detection need to be embedded in a variety of laws, including the financial sector regulatory system.  
Also, licensing procedures in existing sectors (not only natural resources) are very poor, and these create risks that 
critical licenses may be conferred on those involved in criminal activities.  Importantly, the impending extractives 
boom requires the Anti Corruption Commission to become more effective in its work in detecting and prosecuting 
instances of corruption, but firstly leading (with the Audit Service of Sierra Leone) the installation of sound 
transparent processes and accountable systems.  If integrity issues do not become a very high priority ve ry soon, the 
existing levels of corruption could increase at a rate commensurate with the extractives boom. 

Thirdly, an institutional framework for macroeconomic management needs to be put in place ideally before receipt of 
large windfall revenues in the coming years. Such a framework might include mechanisms like a sovereign wealth fund to 
absorb excess mineral revenues, other hedging mechanisms to reduce revenue volatility, front -loaded borrowing to 
smooth government spending, utilities reforms, and specific strategies for currency reserves management.  Taken 
together, the objective should be to establish a strong foundation for macro stabilization. A key strategic question for 
financial sector management is how foreign currency deposits can be leveraged more to facilitate local currency funding 

33 

 
 
  
 
 
for the private sector, while balancing the risks of currency mismatches on bank balance sheets and dollari zation of the 
economy. 

4. 

The timely establishment of a professionally managed sovereign wealth fund that would absorb large funding 
inflows from extractive industries and could compensate for the limited absorptive capacity of the Sierra Leone economy 
would be a key instrument to enhance economic management capacity.  Especially, it could help mitigate some of the 
potential Dutch Disease effects of extractive industry based development. This will require: (a) definition of the funding 
strategy (for example, state equity returns, advance payments or excess mining revenues); (b) the investment profile and 
allocation priority (taking the form, for example, of a national infrastructure development fund, future generation fund, 
and stabilization fund); (c) the fiduciary arrangements, governance structure, and bylaws of the sovereign wealth fund; 
and (d) the respective legal and regulatory framework. 

5. 

In addition, the authorities should develop a robust pipeline of public investment plans and social interventions to 
be financed on the basis of stable and consistent transfers of mining revenues to the budget.  This will require establishing 
an improved institutional framework for public investment management and revenue management in order to avoid some 
of the problems which occurred in 2010 and 2011.  It will also need to take account of institutional capacity and the ability 
for oversight and management of public investment projects. 

Fourthly, gaps in the regulatory and monitoring frameworks for the extractive sector need to be addressed.  Establishing 
and operationalizing the National Minerals Authority and upgrading the Petroleum Directorate's capacity to manage the 
extractives sector will both assist.  Work will also be required to ensure that the recently enacted M ines and Minerals Act 
and its regulations are faithfully implemented and monitored to prevent these important reforms from existing only ―on 
paper‖. Particular emphasis also needs to be placed on monitoring the implementation of extractive industry agreements.  
Sierra Leone is making progress with respect to improving and strengthening the award of licenses and contracts, 
regulation and monitoring of operations and revenue collection.  Yet this progress needs to be accelerated as the pace of 
mining development is guided by the vagaries of the market and the private sector.   

Private and financial sector development 

The emerging mining industry and its ancillary infrastructure offer the opportunity to be leveraged as ‗growth poles‘ for 
private sector development. The impact of these developments is substantial and includes local economic development 
opportunities in non-mining economic activities around the mine catchment areas and transport hubs, SME forward and 
backward linkages with mine operations as well as the provision of infrastructure leveraging the mining developments 
(see Figure 3 in main body of this report). Government should develop specific, spatially focused strategies around the 
new growth poles, especially in the Bumbuna – Makeni – Freetown corridor which combines key power, mining and 
agro-business assets, and perhaps in the south around the large-scale mining and hydrocarbon reserves, once confirmed. 

6. 

In this context, public-private partnerships (PPPs) for infrastructure development will be a key policy instrument 
for deepening private sector investment.  A key priority will be to strengthen the institutional framework and capacity in 
the Government to identify, close and manage PPP infrastructure projects. Sierra Leone has a huge infrastructu re deficit 
even by African standards.  Recognizing the severe constraints of poorly developed infrastructure for the economy, 
Government has made the issue a policy priority.  An ambitious acceleration in infrastructure investments has, however, 
stretched public finances considerably in recent years.  There is scope for leveraging private sector investment into 
infrastructure PPPs and close the funding gap.  In particular, mining-related investments in infrastructure provide 
significant potential to be leveraged into shared public infrastructure and improve the operating environment for other 
industries.   

7. 

While mining developments offer significant potential, current private sector development strategies need to be 
developed further to actively address the need to invest in economic diversification and balance the structural pressures 
from the mining industry in terms of demands on skills, entrepreneurship, infrastructure and financing.  A key lesson from 
countries that have experienced similar resource booms is that economic diversification strategies need to be made an 
early priority. Sierra Leone has significant growth potentials in non-mining sectors, especially agriculture, fisheries, 
tourism, light manufacturing, commerce and services that need to rema in in the focus of policy and private sector 
strategies. 

34 

 
 
 
 
 
8. 
Financial sector development priorities will evolve around the ability of the domestic financial sector to 
intermediate capital inflows, manage the associated risks and foster private sector growth. The ability of the domestic 
banking sector to meet the demand for funding from new entrepreneurs or existing businesses that seek to expand their 
operations as part of the supply chain of the new mining operations will be crucial in ensuring broad based g rowth.  
Demand for financial services will increase as domestic SMEs leverage the opportunities resulting from mining 
developments and income levels of households increase.  Banks need to invest in their ability to structure loan 
transactions and identify viable borrowers in the new value chains. Demand for transaction and payment services will 
increase and development of the national payment system is crucial. 

9. 

The focus on strengthening the regulatory framework and building capacity for banking supervision needs to be 
maintained and complemented through investments in the risk management capacity of the commercial banks and other 
financial institutions.  Rapid credit growth as a result of a growth shock is prone to result in a build -up of credit risks.  
Furthermore, the high concentration of economic activity related to mining will introduce considerable systemic risk that 
needs to be monitored as part of the financial stability oversight functions of the Bank of Sierra Leone.   

10. 
Sierra Leone has the opportunity to learn from the mistakes of other countries that have experienced a similar 
natural resource-driven boom and invest in governance, institutional development and economic diversification strategies 
from the start. Sierra Leone needs to invest both in the country‘s ability to reap the opportunities as well as the capacity to 
mitigate the challenges and risks.

ANNEX 3: PROMOTING SOCIAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR DEVELOPMENT IMPACT 

I. 

Introduction 

1. 
Sierra Leone has made significant progress in consolidating peace and promoting human and economic 
development in the decade since the end of its civil war.  Yet according to global indicators, governance and corruption 
remain notable challenges in securing lasting development.13  Traditionally, efforts to improve governance and minimize 
corruption have focused primarily on the ―supply-side‖ – including supporting the modernization of the state with 
capacity building programs in decentralization and public financial management. Yet, there is growing recognition that in 
order to achieve lasting development in Sierra Leone, citizens must be involved in the process, forging a ―new social 
contract for development.‖14  In a speech commemorating 50 years of Sierra Leone‘s independence, President Ernest Bai 
Koroma challenged all Sierra Leoneans to be monitors and contributors to government‘s work under a newly envisioned 
citizen-state partnership.15  This partnership places civic participation and demand for good governance (DFGG) at the 
center of development and governance planning and is especially important for Sierra Leone in light of the natural 
resources-fuelled growth that is expected in the coming years.     

Social Accountability (SA) and Demand for Good Governance (DFGG) refer to the extent and capability of citizens to 
hold the state accountable and make it responsive to their needs.16  DFGG identifies the aspirations and involvement of 
citizens as paramount to the governance agenda, empowering them in order to increase accountability and improve 
essential service delivery.17    

II. 

DFGG and the Joint Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) 

2. 
The Joint Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) identifies good governance as a cross -cutting theme in promoting 
Sierra Leone‘s development, pointing to the role of poor governance in fueling the country‘s 11-year civil war.18  The 
CAS frames governance broadly, but doesn‘t distinguish in detail between supply-side and demand-side approaches.  The 
CAS states that ―all operations will, where possible and relevant, help to build the demand for good governance by 
promoting transparency, participation, and accountability and supporting capacity development of civil society and the 
media.‖19  Notably, the CAS offers no conceptual framework or recommendations to guide the design and implementation 
of robust demand-side measures in Sierra Leone.  Since adopting the CAS, experience in Sierra Leone has highlighted the 
increasing relevance of DFGG to the country‘s development agenda.  This Annex provides a framework for greater 
investment in DFGG in Sierra Leone and lays the ground for using experiences with DFGG to inform the preparation of 
the next CAS starting in FY14.  Significantly, the Annex responds to the need for a country-specific DFGG strategy to 
further guide operational and analytical activities and policy engagement for the Bank in Sierra Leone.

3. 
In developing a country-specific DFGG strategy, it is important to consider the political economy and broader 
environment for citizen-state interactions.  The 2004 World Development Report identified three key aspects of the 
accountability relationship between citizens, policy makers and service providers: citizen voice with respect to influence 
over policy makers, citizen power with respect to influence over service providers, and the compact between policy 
makers and service providers.20   

4. 
There remains a need to better understand how Sierra Leone fares in promoting citizen voice, citizen power, and 
in having an effective compact.  There is also an ongoing need to map the context for DFGG, understand how powerful 
groups promote or restrict citizens‘ efforts in this space, and assemble evidence showing how development partners can 
facilitate the citizen-state accountability relationship.21  Based on available global governance data, Sierra Leone performs 
relatively well in the areas of citizens‘ voice and empowerment, although the country has significan t room for 
improvement in government effectiveness, rule of law, and anti-corruption, all of which may undermine the viability of 
relationships between citizens, policy makers, and service providers.22  A growing body of empirical data has also 
suggested that the decentralization process in Sierra Leone has emboldened citizens‘ voice vis -à-vis local government 
authorities, especially where communities are disconnected from transport, telecommunications, markets, or contact with 
the state.23  Yet it is important to assess why Sierra Leone performs well in some areas such as citizen voice and 
empowerment and not in others, as well as to consider how best to boost civil society‘s and government‘s capacity to 
prompt and respond to, respectively, citizens‘ demands for improved governance.    

5. 
Notably, from the supply-side, the Government of Sierra Leone has increasingly emphasized and created space for 
DFGG, making the time ripe for strengthened development partner engagement in this space.  In 2009, Government and 
Non State Actors (NSA) agreed on a NSA Component in the Integrated Public Financial Management Project, thereby 
laying the groundwork for NSAs and Civil Society to become informed and engage directly on PFM issues.  This 
supported the creation of the CSO-led Budget Advocacy network, and in turn provided a forum for civil society to 
comment and engage in the budget debate process. The latest effort in this regard was the launch in May 2012 of the 
country‘s first citizen-version of the public budget, drafted by a formative coalition of civil society organizations 
interested in promoting public financial management.  Among other significant opportunities, the Freedom of Information 
Bill has been resubmitted to Parliament in May 2012, and Sierra Leone is currently undertaking the reconciliation process 
under the Extractives Industry Transparency Initiative (EITI), with a validation deadline scheduled for December 2012.  
The country is also preparing its PRS3, which provides another opportunity for strengthening the SA / DFGG agenda at 
the policy / strategy level.  Yet another issue to ponder over is how can Sierra Leone make quick and dramatic 
improvements in human development, including meeting key MDGs, and does SA / DFGG offer an opportunity in this 
regard.

Zhou ed. 2009), at 25.

6. 
Outside the portfolio of Bank financed projects, the Bank has also engaged with other DFGG initiatives in Sierra 
Leone such as the capacity enhancement of youth organizations on Right to Information (RTI), the Global Youth Anti -
Corruption (GYAC) initiative, supporting the Parliamentary Network on the World Bank (PNoWB), the Contract Watch 
initiative, among others. 

7. 
Against this promising backdrop, in 2011 the Bank conducted an internal assessment of the Bank‘s current social 
accountability engagement in Sierra Leone.  The review analyzed the Bank‘s portfolio across a range of DFGG measures, 
including: information-sharing, citizen consultation and participation, third-party monitoring by CSOs, and grievance 
mechanisms.24  A broad outline of these measures follows: 

 

Information-sharing: Citizens‘ and civil society‘s ability to demand better governance depends on their access to 
actionable information.  The effectiveness of DFGG requires disclosure of information, explanation of the 
information, and dissemination of the information.  Information and communications technology can facilitate 
effective aggregation and dissemination of actionable information. 
 Consultation and participation: While information-sharing is a critical component of DFGG, citizens and civil 
society need mechanisms through which to provide feedback to the state.  Consultation and participation allow 
citizens to influence public decisions and service delivery, although it remains challenging to identify which 
mechanisms – whether citizen scorecards, community oversight committees, or otherwise – best channel this 
―feedback‖ or its ―uptake‖ into Government decisions and policy making.     
 Third-party monitoring: DFGG also calls for the media and other civil society actors to monitor and oversee 
government activities.  Such monitoring can help detect and manage risks.  These civil society actors aggregate 
and disseminate relevant information to enable citizens to discuss government performance and opportunities for 
strengthened action. 
 Grievance mechanisms: In some instances, citizen consultation/participation and third-party monitoring create 
pressure, but government fails to respond in the desired manner.  Effective grievance mechanisms channel 
concerns and provide citizens a voice in development. They can mitigate risks and conflict before they become 
serious or costly.25 

8. 
The review revealed that the Bank is supporting some innovative work on DFGG, but the overall effort is largely 
focused on project-level approaches 
to DFGG, with a 
focus on 
information-sharing and community 
consultation/participation, but with limited grievance mechanisms, third-party monitoring, and sustainable policy uptake 
mechanisms. More importantly, there is scope for tightening the link between use of SA / DFGG and development results.  
The review recommended that:  

During the preparation process, projects undertake better prior analysis of accountability constraints and the demand -
side measures to alleviate them; Projects better engage and avoid duplication with other accountability structures 
that already exist in Sierra Leone – especially during implementation;  
 Relatedly, the Bank consider facilitating citizen participation and DFGG beyond a project‘s life cycle; 
 The Bank sharpen the coherence in its overall approach to DFGG in the Sierra Leone program, and engage with 
government further on how DFGG can help accelerate achievement of development results. 
 The Bank gather stronger evidence to demonstrate the effectiveness of DFGG work, including mixed -methods 
approaches that can help explain why certain DFGG interventions are effective (or ineffective) in a particular 
context.26   

IV. 

Towards a Country-Specific DFGG Strategy 

9. 
Framed by the priorities and limitations outlined in the Africa Regional DFGG Strategy, as well as the findings 
from the 2011 portfolio review, there is a need to develop a country-specific DFGG strategy for Sierra Leone.  The Africa 

24 See GAC-2 DFGG, at 36 (outlining these four categories). The review categories loosely tracked these four categories.   
25 Notably, in order to be effectual and credible, grievance mechanisms must have a supply-side response from the 
government and those who act on its behalf. 
26 See GAC-2 DFGG, at 13. 

38 

 
 
 
                                                      
DFGG Strategy recommends five areas of strategic influence for the region: (i) understanding the socio -political context 
for DFGG; (ii) accountability for service delivery; (iii) enabling environment for DFGG; (iv) strengthening natural 
resource management; and (v) supporting media in promoting good governance.27 

10. 
The Sierra Leone DFGG strategy framework proposed here builds upon existing successes, focuses on select and 
promising entry points for engagement, and leverages the Bank‘s comparative advantages as a convener, financier, and 
knowledge institution to deliver development impact.28  In implementing a country-level DFGG strategy, the Bank should 
engage in more internal dialogue and robust discussions with the government, civil society and other development 
partners to ensure that its work complements and enhances the needs identified and efforts underway.  In this regard, the 
Bank will work to forge relevant partnerships.  The Bank should also consider how to boost the capacity of civil society to 
place demands on government, and of government to respond to those demands, encouraging partnerships between the 
two where possible.  

11. With these principles in mind, three potential key priority areas for DFGG work in Sierra Leone during the 
remainder of the CAS period are: (i) promoting a strong policy and enabling environment for DFGG, (ii) reinforcing 
accountability to improve health care delivery and health outcomes, and (iii) promoting the synergy and cross-learning on 
DFGG issues across the country portfolio. 

i. 

Promoting a strong policy and enabling environment for DFGG.   

12. 

The Bank would play a stronger role in working with government and other stakeholders in promoting an 
enabling environment for citizen engagement and accountability of service providers to citizens.  This would help focus 
the Bank efforts much more on using the ‗policy and planning space‘ to strengthen SA / DFGG as a way of promoting 
transparency and governance in Sierra Leone.  In supporting the broader enabling environment, the Bank would work to 
identify and then address context-specific constraints to effective DFGG, such as lack of awareness of entitlements, 
restricted social capital and group mobilization, and citizen concerns about the efficacy or impartiality of feedback or 
grievance systems.  Specifically, the Bank‘s would have different dimensions: (i) engaging with the PRS3 and sector 
strategy / policy discussions in order to also ensure that SA / DFGG issues get sufficient attention in these documents; (ii) 
working with stakeholders to create opportunities for using open information exchange and communication between 
citizens, policy makers, and service providers in Sierra Leone.  This could involve looking at ways to facilitate 
implementation of the Right to Information Bill, once it is approved by Parliament and ratified into law, and using ICT 
and mapping to provide the same quality information to both local level decision-makers and citizens (and thus addressing 
the problem of potential ‗information asymmetry‘ in making planning decisions at the local level).  It could also entail 
strengthened engagement with and capacity-building within media sources; (iii) continue to strengthen the use of the 
budget as an important tool for promoting accountability, e.g. through quality use of Citizens Budget and supporting the 
government to continue disclosing revenues from the extractives sector; and (iv) make the Bank itself more accountable 
by use of initiatives like External Implementation Status Report (EISR), which aim to complement the Bank‘s Access to 
Information policy, and to get third party / beneficiary feedback on implementation of Bank-supported projects.   

ii. Reinforcing Citizen Accountability to Improve Health Care Delivery and Health Outcomes. 

13. 

Although Sierra Leone has made progress in promoting human development since the end of the civil war, the 
country still lags far behind in achieving certain Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), particularly in the health 
sector.  The country remains near the bottom of the Human Development Index with very h igh maternal and under-five 
mortality rates. As Sierra Leone undergoes a rapid economic transformation driven by the extractives sector, the socio -
political and economic imperative to ensure that there is faster progress on the MDGs is only likely to incre ase. The 
government‘s bold Free Health Care Initiative (FHCI) aims to improve the country‘s health statistics, and health care 
delivery more broadly.  However, the government and civil society have observed gaps in monitoring and accountability 
(improper use fees, absent nurses, missing drugs, etc.) that undermine service delivery.  As this Annex has suggested, the 
Bank needs to focus on select, promising points of engagement with DFGG, and the health sector poses one such 

27 See id. at 14-16. 
28 See AFR Strategy. 

39 

 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                      
promising entry point.  There are identified gaps in monitoring and accountability in the health sector, and citizens (who 
are closest to the point of service delivery) may be best equipped to document these and press for change.  Further, the 
Government has indicated a keen interest in both advancing health outcomes (via the FHCI, among other efforts) and, 
notably, in using DFGG to improve health service delivery.  Hence, it is recommended that the Bank support the 
Government and civil society in their endeavors by focusing its efforts around using DFGG to improve health care 
delivery.  This emphasis is consistent with the Africa Regional DFGG Strategy and the CAS, both of which emphasize the 
importance of SA / DFGG for strengthening service delivery.  Experience elsewhere has shown that pa rallel efforts to 
strengthen the delivery systems (‗supply-side‘) and the accountability systems (‗demand-side‘) are likely to improve the 
prospects of achieving more sustainable development impact.  Yet, the true benefits of SA / DFGG in helping achieve 
development results in the health sector in Sierra Leone must still be validated, and, hence, rigorous and mixed -methods 
evaluation will be an important component of the Bank‘s activities in this space.    The revised CAS Results Framework 
captures the intended outcomes of this consolidated DFGG effort in the health sector in the country.    

iii. Promoting Cross-learning and Synergy on DFGG across country portfolio.  

14. 
As noted above, the review of ongoing of DFGG efforts in Bank-supported programs in Sierra Leone has 
confirmed that SA / DFGG is being actively pursued in many projects in the portfolio.  Going forward, the cross -learning 
and synergy between these efforts would be promoted in a number of ways.  Firstly, the following framework would be 
used as a guide to help identify opportunities for DFGG to contribute to specific sector / project outcomes or address 
binding constraints to good governance and enhanced service delivery in ongoing and new projects.  Secondly, the Bank 
will maintain the focus on high-impact DFGG initiatives and avoid undue proliferation of efforts and ensure optimal use 
of limited government capacity.  Thirdly, put greater attention on ‗closing the feedback loop‘ i.e. stronger grievance 
redressal systems and helping ensure that citizens can use the ‗empowerment‘ provided through DFGG initiatives in 
helping improve service delivery and accountability of providers.  Next, continue and strengthen the use of established 
tools to support DFGG in improving service delivery, such as surveys carried out for several years, including CLoPAS, 
PETS and INPSS.  And finally, consider opportunities to enhance synergies on a regional basis with other countries 
confronting similar development challenges and opportunities for DFGG engagement in areas including increased access 
to information, budget transparency, and extractives.  

Strategic country-level approach to DFGG 

Identify binding constraints in a particular sector or development area. 

Consider whether empowering citizens/civil society may help alleviate that binding constraint.  Is there evidence that 
citizens‘ involvement makes a difference?  Do citizens/civil society have the capacity and willingness to work in this space, 
and, if not, is support available to assist them in so doing?  Does government have the capacity and willingness to respond, 
and, if not, is support available to assist it in so doing? 

If empowering citizens/civil society may make a difference, consider which DFGG measures in particular are best targeted 
to the local context and to the particular need.  Are grievances or discord foreseeable? Are there existing accountability 
structures that can be bolstered? 

15. 
The next opportunity to review the state of play with the overall DFGG effort of the Bank in Sierra Leone would 
be during the preparation of the next CAS.  At that time, the Bank should identify key sectors for future Bank DFGG 
40 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
engagement in order to enhance project performance and/or minimize risks, using a strategic approach such as the one 
outlined above. In addition, the Bank should execute further adjustments and refinements to the country DFGG strategy.

Binding Constraint and Potential DFGG Solution 

Since the government of Sierra Leone passed a free health care initiative (FHCI) in 2010, 
civil society organizations (CSOs) have scrutinized the accountability of service delivery 
providers and pointed to gaps in monitoring that lead, inter alia, to leakage of drugs, 
improper fees for health services, and missing health staff.29   

Government and CSOs have pointed to DFGG as a potentially powerful tool to empower 
citizens to aggregate information about gaps in services and monitor and participate in 
improving health service delivery.  The government Decentralization Secretariat, with 
World Bank DSDP financing, is implementing two DFGG interventions around health 
clinics in four districts, beginning in May 2012: 

1. Seeking to improve accountability in health delivery by convening discussions in 
communities around a clinic scorecard and drafting a compact between 
communities and clinic staff wherein both commit to improving health delivery.  

2. Linking bottom-up feedback from users with top-down, formal state recognition 
through a non-financial award to the top improving clinics and their staff.   

The interventions will be implemented over approximately 8 months using a randomized-
controlled trial.  Qualitative research by the World Bank Justice for the Poor program 
will also seek to understand why and how these measures work.   

Grievance 
mechanisms 

Government and CSOs have noted certain accountability gaps, such as drug leakage or 
poor management, that reflect breakdowns in state structures.  Information-sharing or 
community consultation/ participation may not suffice in these cases; to obtain a remedy, 
communities may need help navigating administrative or other accountability channels. 

Legal empowerment practitioners are exploring their role in addressing such systemic 
breakdowns that create problems felt by an entire community.  Small-scale pilot activities 
are taking place in two districts to investigate role of legal empowerment (paralegals) and 
DFGG (community-based health oversight committees) in improving paths for citizen 
grievances around health delivery.  The findings will inform the broader portfolio of 
Bank-financed approaches to accountability for service delivery in Sierra Leone.

Annex 14 – Donor Partnership in Sierra Leone 

1. According to the latest figures from the Ministry of Finance & Economic Development 
(MoFED), Sierra Leone received about $351.87 million in development partner (DP) support in 
2011.  About 76% percent of this came from five development partners – the World Bank, DFID, 
the EC, the UN system and the United States.  There do seem to be fluctuations in the aid flows 
from various DPs.  World Bank support represented about 22% of the total aid volume in 2011.    
Budget support, project support and Technical Assistance remain the main channels of support 
from DPs.  There is a significant amount of aid resources flowing through off-budget channels, an 
area, which will require further attention.  It is difficult to estimate future aid flows into Sierra 
Leone, but major increases are unlikely to happen given the current global economic context.  
The nature and levels of bilateral support from the BRIC countries, especially China, have 
increased in recent years.  During the IDA16 period, there has been an increase in World Bank 
support based on continued improvements in the CPIA scores.  Nonetheless, as stated in the main 
text of the report, the increase in private flows is likely to be an increasingly important source of 
financing towards the growth and development needs of the country.

2. Aid coordination efforts present a mixed picture.  The Multi Donor Budget Support (MDBS) 
group is working quite coherently and holds a joint and structured dialogue with the government.  
The Group conducts a joint annual Performance Assessment Framework (PAF) under its 
Agreement, which provides the basis for agreed fiscal, policy and institutional actions 
underpinning budget support.  The MDBS process is now increasingly being led by MoFED, 
although there is scope for strengthening coordination within government on budget support 
issues, principally between MoFED and other parts of government, which have a role to play in 
meeting the PAF indicators.  As stated in the CAS Progress Report, the likely economic 
transformation in the country would require the MDBS and IMF programs to be increasingly 
aligned to the new policy and reflect the institutional challenges faced by Sierra Leone.  Beyond 
budget support, the UN system is well-coordinated with a joint UN Vision supporting 
government efforts.  The coordination between the UN and IFIs is also a strong point of DP 
coordination efforts in the country.  Given the relatively small number of DPs in the country,  

62 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
harmonization and alignment efforts have been relatively less demanding to date, in terms of 
process, but there is considerable scope for strengthening DP coordination efforts in order to 
strengthen the delivery of development results.  Coordination efforts at the sector level present a 
mixed picture, with health and education being relatively good examples of sector -level 
coordination.  In the health sector, a Compact was signed recently between the government and 
DPs, which is the first such sector-level effort in Sierra Leone.  In the education sector, there is an 
ongoing dialogue between the government and DPs and an annual joint review of progress and 
priorities in the sector.  These practices in the health and education sectors might hold some 
interesting lessons for other sectors, and going forward MoFED may wish to consider replicating 
them in other sectors. 

3. The Development Partners Committee (DEPAC) has held meetings on a quarterly basis, 
including an annual meeting chaired by His Excellency, the President of Sierra Leone.  These 
meetings provide a valuable opportunity to discuss high-level development priorities and agree on 
priority actions to be taken jointly by the government and donors.  The DEPAC also provides a 
good opportunity for non-traditional DPs to participate in wider aid coordination efforts.  Going 
forward, there will be scope to strengthen linkages between DEPAC and sector -level groups, so 
that DEPAC provides sector groups with an opportunity to share best practices.  Government and 
DP efforts are currently being coordinated for the preparation of PRS3.  Experiences from other 
countries suggest that there may be scope for PRS3 preparation to be less demanding in terms of 
process and coordination, while rebalancing efforts to focus on substantive policy choices and 
options facing the country.   

4. Sierra Leone is committed to the implementation of the Principles of the Paris Declaration on Aid 
Effectiveness. This commitment has led to the country‘s participation in a number of OECD 
DAC surveys including the 2011 joint Paris Declaration and Fragile States Principles Survey. The 
2011 joint survey revealed that Government ownership of the Agenda for Change is strong and 
that there is a rising level of donor confidence as Sierra Leone develops. The country is one of 
only a few developing countries to have a set of coherent and well thought-out policy documents 
addressing the complex inter-relationships between political, security and development 
imperatives.  Alignment has increased significantly especially by the MDBS partners and the UN 
agencies. A more strategic and sustained approach is needed to strengthen parliament‘s capacities 
to assume its constitutional role and fulfill civil society‘s desire to engage in more sustained 
political dialogue with government.  Harmonization is slowly improving but coordination at 
decentralized levels needs to improve. Sustaining decentralization and devolution in Sierra Leone 
will be important peace building and state building activities, in the years ahead. Fully 
empowering the GoSL to manage its revenue and to account for it to both donors and to the 
citizens of Sierra Leone is an essential step that must be taken.   Aside from the formal 
mechanisms, well-established informal networks have emerged which continue to facilitate 
coordination and information-sharing.  Management for results is slowly improving but remains 
weak at project level and the gap between planning and implementation remains wide. 
Procurement systems still remain a challenge and disparities created by salary top-ups and 
parallel implementation units (PIUs) complicate civil service reform. Preventing conflict in Sierra 

63 

 
 
 
Leone will require dealing with traditional regional rivalries and focusing on youth 
unemployment.    

5. Sierra Leone is a pilot country for the G7+ Group on Fragile States and Situations.  Initial 
discussions are taking place between government and partners about what being a pilot country 
will really involve.  This presents another opportunity for Sierra Leone to strengthen its efforts on 
aid coordination and aid effectiveness.  One opportunity for implementing the G7+ New Deal 
may be for the government and partners to consider signing a Compact, after the preparation of 
PRS3 in 2013, which could form the basis for strengthening further aid effectiveness and delivery 
of results.  This may also be an opportunity to consider a better division of labor between DPs, as 
a way of strengthening selectivity and avoiding the problem of some sectors having a large 
number of DPs, while others have too few.  The government may wish to consider useful lessons 
that may be learned from other African countries regarding a sharper division of labor amongst 
DPs.
