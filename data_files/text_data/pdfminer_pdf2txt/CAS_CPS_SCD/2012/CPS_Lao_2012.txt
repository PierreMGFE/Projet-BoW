COUNTRY CONTEXT  

1. 
The proposed Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) period comes at a critical juncture in 
the development of Lao PDR.  The country has embarked on a path of exploiting its abundant natural 
resources to achieve its ambitious goal of graduating from Least Developed Country status by 2020 .  Lao 
PDR‘s location in the dynamic East Asia region, with its accelerating demand for electricity and natural 
resources, make this development path possible.  In recent years, this natural resource boom and the 
resulting foreign direct investment has fueled high growth rates and the promise of economic opportunity 
for the country‘s young and growing population.   

2. 
This resource boom has also exposed risks that threaten to undermine Lao PDR’s success if 
not managed.  Rapid economic growth associated with the resource boom has led to poverty reduction 
but has deepened inequality, especially between rural and urban areas.  The non-resource sector, a source 
of broader based growth that could mitigate this inequality, is in decline, hampered by a lack of 
competitiveness.  The potential for environmental degradation calls into question the sustainability of the 
country‘s natural resource management plan.  The resource boom may also increase the governance gap, 
as institutions of accountability lag behind the growth in projects and investments in the sector.  Finally, 
the risk that Lao PDR‘s resource wealth may not result in sustainable development is exacerbated because 
the country lacks the robust institutions that international experience shows can immunize resource rich 
countries from Dutch disease and other potential pitfalls.  The challenge for the World Bank Group is to 
craft a strategy that can support Lao PDR‘s ambitious development goals while helping the country 
mitigate the risks that could derail this achievement. 

POVERTY AND INEQUALITY   

3. 
Lao PDR has achieved significant progress in poverty reduction.  The poverty headcount has 
declined from almost half the population to below one quarter within a decade .  In 1992/93, basic needs 
were not met for 46 percent of people, but this number fell to 39 percent in 1997/78, to 33 percent by 
2002/03 and to 28 percent by 2007/8.  The share of poverty was reduced by 30 percent in one decade, 
lifting one eighth of the total population out of poverty.  Even though the population grew by more than 
one million between 1992/93 and 2007/8, the absolute number of the poor declined to just over 
1.5 million.

4. 
These averages, however, mask geographic and ethnic disparities.  Urban areas and districts 
along the Thai border have experienced rapid growth and poverty reduction, but other groups continue to 
lag behind.  The northern part of the country remains poorer than the southern and central regions, and 
uplands are poorer than lowlands.  Poverty rates vary according to ethnicity, with the Lao-Tai displaying 
lower poverty incidence.  Gender disparities are also more pronounced among many of the non Lao-Tai 
groups, and progress towards meeting the MDGs has been slower.  The priority districts, which have been 

1 

 
 
 
 
the focus of the intervention by the Government and development partners, remain much poorer than non-
priority districts.  Despite efforts to target Government expenditures at these areas, poverty reduction has 
been relatively slow.  It should be also be noted that, due to the small population share in the priority 
districts, 43 percent of the poor live in areas with higher population density which are not part of priority 
districts, including in urban centers and the provinces along the Mekong.   

5. 
Lao PDR also enjoys a young and growing population, with more than half of the 
population aged less than 20 years old.  Whether the youth bulge is an economic boon or a missed 
opportunity will depend on how young people‘s aspirations can be met within the country with 
appropriate policy responses.  To reap the demographic dividend, Lao PDR will need to equip young 
people with the skills necessary for productive employment, and provide an enabling environment for the 
private sector to increase demand for labor. 

6. 
Liberalization of the private sector, trade, increased electrification and expansion of the 
road network were major drivers of poverty reduction in the last decade.  Other major entry points 
for poverty reduction include road access to market, farming productivity, ownership of land and 
livestock, access to credit and marketing chains.  In addition to the geographical factors, major causes of 
poverty include the legacy of physical devastation during the Vietnam War, with unexploded ordinance 
(UXO) still affecting half of the country‘s territory; weak public service delivery, especially in the health 
and education sectors; inadequate transport and communications infrastructure; and shortcomings and 
weaknesses in the management of public resources.   

7. 
Household vulnerability to shocks remains high, but so far the social and poverty impacts of 
the global financial crisis appear small.  Lao households are highly vulnerable to natural disasters and 
shocks.  Moreover, the food and financial crises have highlighted new forms of vulnerability which, while 
still limited, will likely grow in significance over the years as the Lao economy becomes more open to 
global markets and increasingly marketized.  At this point, however, the impact of increased food prices 
appears to be relatively muted because most households still rely on subsistence agriculture.  This reliance 
on subsistence agriculture has also limited the overall reach of the crisis, although there have been some 
impacts on trade, the natural resource sector and tourism.   

8. 
Lao PDR has made solid progress towards the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), but 
still faces multiple challenges in meeting them by 2015.  Lao PDR lags behind the regional and low-
income country averages on many key social indicators.  Available data suggest that the Lao PDR is off 
track on a number of the MDGs, including malnutrition, measles immunization, skilled birth attendance, 
and some dimensions of gender equality.  Education is among the better performing sectors in Lao PDR, 
but a number of indicators still lag regional averages and even with planned increases in financial 
resources from the Government and development partners for the education sector, it appears that the 
MDG target of 90 percent primary completion is at risk of not being achieved.  Progress towards the 
health MDGs has been mixed.  While child mortality is still high, the MDG target is within reach .  There 
has been less progress on other health indicators, in particular malnutrition, skilled birth attendance, and 
immunization coverage.  Maternal mortality rate is also among the highest in the EAP region .  The need 
for progress in these areas represents a considerable challenge for the coming years .   

9. 
In general, Government policies combined with rapid economic modernization have 
supported the steady advancement of women’s status in Lao PDR, particularly in urban areas .  
Human development trends are mostly positive, particularly in urban lowland areas, and are expected to 
continue to improve.  Improvements include increased coverage of antenatal care, increase in the number 
of births attended by skilled medical staff, and improved enrollment rates of girls.  However, while a great 
deal has been achieved, some indicators show slow—or no—progress and some groups in the population 
are being left behind.  Healthcare for pregnant and new mothers and maternal and child malnutrition are 
areas of particular concern, as are the difficulties that girls in remote areas and from ethnic groups face in 
accessing quality education.  In general, women and girls are the most disadvantaged in the parts of the 

2 

 
 
country where people in general are poorest—those without roads and those in non-Lao Thai ethnic 
groups. 

ECONOMIC CONTEXT AND RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS 

10. 
Lao PDR is rapidly transforming itself through strong economic growth in recent years .  
Following the introduction of market-oriented reforms beginning in 1986, the economy has expanded on 
average by 6.5 percent per year between 1990 and 2009.  Per capita income has more than doubled since 
1990 reaching $1010 in 2010. 

11. 
Lao PDR’s real GDP growth will likely remain robust in 2011 with projected growth of 8.0 
percent.  Natural resources and manufacturing sectors have driven growth last year contributing about 3.5 
percentage points of the projected 2011 growth rate, with the remainder attributed to services (2.6 
percentage points), manufacturing (1.0 percentage point), agriculture (about 0.4 percentage point) and 
construction (0.5 percentage points).   

12. 
The contribution of the resource sectors to economic growth has increased significantly in 
the past five years.  Future growth is projected to be driven largely by natural resources and the non-
tradable sectors.  The natural resource sector‘s contribution to GDP growth increased from about 2.6 
percentage points in 2009 to 4.8 percentage points in 2010 and is projected to average 4.0 percentage 
points between 2011 and 2015, and 3.5 percentage points between 2016 and 2020.

13. 
This growth in resource led growth marks a structural shift from agriculture to natural -
resource based industry. Natural resources have been growing very rapidly during the past decade, at an 
annual average of 20.7 percent in 2003-2010.  As a result, the share of the sector in GDP almost tripled 
between 1998 and 2010, increasing to about 16.1 percent by 2010 from 5.9 percent in 1998 (see Figure 3). 
The share of non-tradables (services) in GDP grew moderately, driven by increases in tourism and trade 
in recent years as well as expansion in infrastructure construction.  Similarly, manufacturing (garments, 
wood and wood products, construction materials, light manufacturing, handicrafts, and, increasingly, 
food, beverages, and related processing) as a share of GDP has expanded slightly.  Most notably, the 
share of agriculture has dropped consistently over the last decade, from 43 percent in 2000 to 30 percent 
by 2010.  Agriculture and forestry are mainly subsistence-based, with some emerging plantation and 
contract farming, and agricultural exports (mainly crops) are limited, just about one -third of 
manufacturing exports.  The transition towards a natural-resource intensive growth is expected to

14. While natural resources are likely to be a major driver of growth over the medium term, 
the non-resource sector is still expected to contribute more than half of real GDP growth and 75 
percent of total GDP.  Non-resource sectors (manufacturing, construction, services including tourism 
and trade) are important for sustainable broad based growth.  They are also traditionally more stable than 
resource sectors, and provide more direct employment due to their higher labor intensity.  Since projects 
in the resource industry are largely foreign-owned, repatriation of benefits abroad may be significant, and 
indeed Lao PDR is already seeing a growing wedge appearing between GDP and GNI.  As a result, the 
actual contribution of such projects to national income and thus to per capita income may be less than 
their contribution to GDP.  This means that to sustain long term economic growth and achieve positive 
development outcomes, Lao PDR needs to create conditions for broad-based private-sector led growth in 
the non-resource economy.  

15. 
Inflation has risen in recent months due to higher commodity prices .  Annualized inflation is 
projected at around 7.0 percent in 2011, up from 6 percent in 2010.  The rise in global food prices have 
limited impact on Lao inflation, as domestic food prices are not strongly influenced by global trends due 
to the subsistence nature of food production and low levels of food exports.  Nevertheless, food prices in 
Lao PDR remain vulnerable to shocks, especially natural disaster (flood and draught), animal disease 
outbreak and other seasonal factors. 

16. 
The Government’s fiscal stance has improved in 2011, but exposure to volatile international 
metal prices remains significant.  The budget deficit is expected to decline further to 2.0 percent of 
GDP in FY10/11 from 4.8 percent in FY09/10 due to tightened expenditure (for both current and capital 
spending) and higher revenue (especially resource tax revenues), and also high copper and gold prices on 
international commodity markets.  The non-mining deficit was 11% of GDP in FY10/11.   Domestic 
revenue is likely to increase to 15.2 percent of GDP in FY10/11 from 14.3 percent in FY09/10 following 
anticipated transfers of taxes, royalties and dividends from the resource sectors as a result of higher 
commodity prices.  Overall spending is expected to decline to 21.4 percent of GDP in FY10/11 from 23.3 
percent in FY09/10.  The wage bill remained stable this fiscal year while an increase (in nominal terms) 
for compensations and transfers was budgeted to support expansion of public services to remote areas, 
especially for social sectors.  The Government pursues a stabilized exchange rate regime of the Lao kip 
against the US dollar and the Thai baht in an economy where more than half of monetary assets 
transactions are US dollar or baht denominated.

17. 
Although Lao PDR continues to face a high risk of debt distress on account of its high debt 
stock, debt servicing remains manageable.  External public and publicly-guaranteed debt stocks remain 
elevated, but the high level of concessionality of official borrowing, which comprises most of Lao PDR's 
debt, keeps debt service ratios relatively contained.  The debt profile has improved in recent years, in part 
because the Government has generally followed a prudent strategy of avoiding the accumulation of non -
concessional debt.  Lao PDR chose not to avail itself of debt relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor 
Country (HIPC) Initiative or the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI).  Because Lao PDR is 
classified as having a high risk of debt distress, under the IDA‘s grant allocation framework the country

Box 1:  World Bank Poverty Program in Lao PDR  

The World Bank has been involved in poverty analysis in Laos since the early 1990s , beginning with 
developing an approach for estimating poverty incidence based on the Lao Expenditure and Consumption 
Surveys (LECS) and leading to a Poverty Assessment in 2006.  New work on poverty and vulnerability was 
initiated in early 2009, in part as a response to concerns about the social and poverty impacts of the 2008 
food price and financial crises.  This has included collaboration with the Department of Statistics (DOS) on 
an updated Poverty Profile, as well as preparation of reports based on the LECS data on vulnerability and 
social safety nets; the incidence and impact of shocks on household welfare; household reliance on natural 
resources, and utilization of health services.  Further analytic work based on the LECS has been initiated on 
the determinants of poverty and vulnerability, poverty dynamics, targeting, and education.  
Past analytic work on poverty and vulnerability has provided an important foundation for capacity 
development, policy dialogue and operational engagement . For instance, the work on vulnerability and 
social safety nets has provided an evidence base for a dialogue with the Ministry of Labor and Social 
Welfare and other stakeholders on policy options for helping households cope with adverse shocks.  On the 
operational side, the work to date has provided contextual information for project design and monitoring, for 
example, in the monitoring of socioeconomic conditions in the Poverty Reduction Support Operations.  

The need for a strong engagement on poverty and vulnerability is likely to increase in the future .  The 
first Lao Statistical Law was approved by the National Assembly in June 2010, and sets the framework for a 
renewed focus on statistics and household survey and poverty analysis in particular.  Specific areas of work 
are expected to include support on household survey design and analysis; analysis of livelihood and labor 
market trends to understand the distributional implications of structural changes for the rural and urban 
population; analysis of the incidence of government policies and public spending to underpin policy 
dialogue in connection with budget support, and enhanced monitoring of the socioeconomic impacts of 
expanding investments in the natural resource sector. 

PRIVATE SECTOR CONTEXT 

18. 
The Lao PDR Constitution of 1991 protects state, collective, and private forms of 
ownership.  During the 1990s an active legislative program laid the foundations for developing market 
based rules and institutions to support private sector development .  Today, agricultural production and 
most manufacturing production are in private hands, and SOEs account for only around one percent of 
employment.  Nearly 97 percent of manufacturing units are small , with less than 10 employees.  Of the 
medium and large units, around one third are privately owned by Lao citizens and just over half are joint 
ventures with foreigners.  The remainder is owned by Government.   

19. 
Foreign investment inflows have increased rapidly, in both resource and non-resource 
sectors.  Between 2003 and 2010, actual investments increased from $110 million to almost $800 million, 
with hydropower and mining now accounting for some 80 percent of the inflows.  The main foreign 
investors are from Thailand, China and Vietnam, with other countries such as France, Australia and South 
Korea also registering with significant investments .  Lao PDR has increasingly improved the regulatory 
business environment, but significant gaps remain due to inconsistent and partial implementation of key 
laws and gaps in the subsidiary legislation.  The expanding private sector is creating opportunities for Lao 
entrepreneurs, 30-40 percent of whom are women.  However, women tend to operate smaller, informal 
firms, often in the retail and services sectors, and thus have traditionally had more difficulty than men in 
accessing finance, markets, and information. 

20. 
Enterprises in Lao PDR report the most significant constraints to business expansion are 
tax administration, access to finance and workforce skills.  Smaller firms suffer most from lack of 
access to formal finance where high levels of collateral and formal accounting are required .  Only 3 
percent of firms use external financing for investments and 19 percent have a loan or line of credit from a 
bank.  The taxation system discourages formalization and the growth of small enterprises into medium 
sized firms.  Larger firms are more constrained by the availability of skilled and unskilled labor .  While 
the cost of labor in Lao PDR is comparatively low, actual labor productivity faces competitiveness 

 
 
 
 
 
 
challenges when compared with neighboring countries and the costs of doing business (regulatory costs 
and infrastructural issues related to the country‘s landlocked supply chain) are comparatively high.  The 
growing influence of natural resource development is beginning to reshape the non-resource sector.  In 
particular, high returns to operating in the domestic market inflate the profitability of domestically 
oriented firms while exporters are increasingly squeezed by high production, transport and trade 
facilitation costs.   

POLITICAL AND GOVERNANCE CONTEXT 

21. 
Lao PDR is governed by a single-party system.  The Lao PDR People‘s Revolutionary Party 
(LPRP) is headed by the Party‘s Central Committee, which is selected through the Party Congress .  The 
9th Party Congress in Lao PDR was successfully concluded in March 2011 .  The structure of political 
power has remained unchanged since 1975, with a decision-making centralized in the Politburo and 
Central Committee.  In recent years there has been a professionalization of the Central Committee, with 
an increasing number of PhDs and technical experts among the members.  Similarly, Politburo 
membership has been gradually transitioning from current or past military members to a younger more 
reform minded generation.  Provincial governments have a high degree of autonomy over resources, 
expenditures, and services.  

22. 
The National Assembly, whose members are elected directly by the people from a list of 
permanent Party candidates as well as some independent candidates (private sector), is increasingly 
playing a stronger oversight role.  It is establishing viable mechanisms of executive oversight, despite 
being restricted to Party and Party approved membership.  There are effective hearings on the budget and 
budget execution statements, increasingly questions are asked about corruption, and the legislature has 
established a popular hotline for the public to express its opinions and seek answers from the 
Government.  It has vetoed executive legislative proposals, demanded more effective action against 
corruption, approved controversial and mega development projects, and slowed land concessions.  
However, capacity across the legislative committees varies.   

23. 
The relatively closed nature of the Lao political system makes an objective assessment of the 
quality of governance a challenge.  However, the political stability makes it relatively likely that 
Government‘s policy orientations would remain during the CPS period, especially given that the Party 
Congress has just taken place and a new Government has only recently formed. 

24. 
Civil society leverage over policy making has been limited, but there are indications that the 
space for participation may be growing.  There are indications, however, that the space for participation 
may be growing.  While international NGOs have been present in Lao PDR for some time, legislation in 
2009 enlarged the space for both international and national nonprofit associations to operate.  However 
challenges remain in implementing the legislation.  There are also signs that the Government may become 
more participatory in its decision making, involving bodies such as the Lao Business Council in policy 
making, and sees value in such consultations.  Mass based organization (MBOs) for women, youth, labor 
and ethnic groups are closely linked to the Party.  While the MBOs are constitutionally provided for, 
funded from the Government budget, they can also provide a channel for grass roots concerns to be 
communicated upwards. 

25. 
Although information is limited, governance in Lao PDR appears to present a mixed 
picture.  On the one hand, the Government has made visible efforts to build modern public sector 
institutions such as the gradual strengthening of formal oversight bodies like the State Audit Organization 
or the National Assembly.  The development of these oversight bodies might provide a modicum of 
checks and balances on the executive branch of Government.  Improvements in basic functions of public 
financial management where there has been concerted external assistance represent another positive 
development.

Box 2:  Supporting Governance and Anti-Corruption in Lao PDR  

The World Bank has adopted a four pronged strategy for supporting governance and anti -corruption 
measures in Lao PDR: 

Addressing fiduciary weaknesses in the governance of public finances.  The World Bank supports the 
government‘s efforts to reduce misuse and improve management of public funds through consolidating 
government bank accounts under the National Treasury.  More than 5,000 spending unit accounts have been 
transferred from individual agency control to the Ministry of Finance, with daily monitoring of cash 
balances. The Bank also supports the revamping of budget execution and reporting systems, which has 
allowed the government to start publishing in-year budget execution reports and summary of approved 
budgets, thereby enhancing fiscal transparency. Efforts have also focused on improving the governance of 
public procurement with through new legislation and establishment of the procurement monitoring office at 
the Ministry of Finance. 

Improving incentives, ethics and meritocracy in the public administration.  Within the overall umbrella 
of the Government‘s Public Administration Reform Program (GPAR), the World Bank has provided 
analysis  on improving the pay and compensation conditions for to incentivize public officials to perform 
their duties appropriately, whilst not engaging in rent seeking activities. At the same time, under UNDP 
leadership, the World Bank has been lending support of the merits and ethics dimensions of the GPAR 
program. The Bank is also assisting the Ministry of Home Affairs in clarifying rol es and responsibilities 
between central government, provinces, and districts, which is critical to improving accountability 
arrangements governing service delivery units. 

Strengthening capacity of external accountability and oversight agencies .  The State Audit Organization 
(SAO) has been actively engaging with the World Bank on improving quality and coverage of financial 
audits. Concurrently the Bank is working with the National Assembly‘s (NA) Committee on Economy, 
Finance, and Planning on building capacity on the budget oversight and legislative analyses functions. The 
engagement with the SAO and NA has contributed to parliamentary debates on budget execution being 
televised and the summary report published in newspaper from 2010 onwards.  

Supporting good governance at the project level and reducing fiduciary risks in the Bank Portfolio .  
In order to recognize, manage, and mitigate risks in the portfolio, the Bank has instituted an Operational 
Risk Assessment Framework for all projects since 2011. Mid -term reviews are now used systematically to 
take stock of such risks and their mitigation measures using the same framework.  In addition, integrated 
and systematic fiduciary supervisions are undertaken periodically for projects, the results of which feed into 
the implementation support strategy for projects. The Bank has also increased fiduciary trainings of 
government staff to ensure that government counterparts have adequate knowledge and tools for 
implementing the Bank‘s procurement and financial management policies effectively.  Finally, governance 
activities are mainstreamed into project design: The Nam Theun 2 project was developed as a good practice 
example of natural resource management governance. The Sustainable Forest Development (SUFORD) 
project supports government‘s efforts to fight illegal logging.  The Poverty Reduction Fund (PRF) and 
Khammouane Development projects support improved governance at the local level with communities.  

Taken together this four-pronged approach provides for a credible and ‗best-fit‘ Governance and Anti-
Corruption strategy for the Lao PDR context.  Looking ahead, the Country Development Partnership will 
continue to deepen this engagement area and broaden engage with government, non -government, the 
ASEAN Good Governance Initiative, and development partner community, to support Lao PDR improve 
governance and anti-corruption measures.   

8 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
26. 
Nevertheless, considerable capacity challenges remain 
in most areas of pub lic 
administration.  In some areas, such as natural resource management, the gap between the rapidly 
growing demand for better governance, and the existing level of governance capacities and institutional 
quality on the other, is growing, especially in terms of regulatory enforcement.  These growing 
―governance gaps‖ elevate the risks of increasing rent-seeking and corruption, and with it, possible 
corrosion of other public institutions including those that have emerged as potential sources of 
accountability in recent years.   

27. 
Government is increasingly concerned about corruption in Lao PDR, although there is 
scant information available to assess its prevalence.  Petty corruption is said to be common, but has not 
stifled basic social and economic transactions.  A particular concern is that the expansion of natural 
resource extraction could give rise to a growth of grand corruption especially around illegal logging and 
land concession.  Despite the emergence of some oversight bodies, existing accountability and 
enforcement measures are insufficient to deter corruption unless the Government takes decisive steps to 
curb its growth.   

REGIONAL AND GLOBAL CONTEXT 

28. 
Lao PDR is surrounded by some of the most dynamic and fastest growing economies in the 
world, and has benefited from the investment and demand that comes from its neighbors .  Growth 
in cross-border investment and trade with neighboring countries continues to grow strongly as Lao PDR 
becomes more and more closely integrated into the region.  Much of this investment is driven by the 
strong demand in the region for natural resources.  Integration into regional production networks for 
goods and services has taken place at a slower pace.  Exports are increasingly dominated by natural 
resources, while non-natural resource exports tend to be located in fragile sectors with limited scope for 
value addition.   

29. 
An explicit part of the Government’s development strategy for Lao PDR is to transition 
from a “landlocked” to a “landlinked” country, elevating the importance of regional cooperation 
and economic integration for the country’s development.  Lao PDR is located in the center of the 
Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS), and is the only country to border all other GMS countries (Cambodia, 
China, Myanmar, Thailand, Vietnam).  As its geographical location places the country at the heart of 
many GMS economic and transport corridors, a challenge for Lao PDR will be to benefit from the 
activities along the corridors while managing the risks associated with cross border movement of people, 
goods and services.  Lao PDR is an active participant in the Mekong River Commission, and is a 
signatory to the 1995 MRC Mekong Agreement.  As Lao PDR turns to hydropower to spur its economy, 
the MRC has become an important forum for consultation with riparians about the proposed use of 
Mekong resources.  In particular, Lao PDR‘s proposal to construct dams on the mainstream Mekong has 
increased the MRCs regional profile and may challenge the organization‘s capacity to facilitate dialogue 
on the sustainable use of Mekong resources.   

30. 
Lao PDR’s membership in ASEAN has far reaching implications for the country’s 
development.  ASEAN leaders have decided to transform ASEAN into a stable, prosperous, and highly 
competitive region with equitable economic development, and reduced poverty and socio-economic 
disparities.  ASEAN members have agreed to establish the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) as the 
goal of regional economic integration by 2015.  The AEC represents a commitment to an open, outward-
looking, inclusive, and market-driven regional economy, and rules-based systems for effective 
compliance.  An ASEAN single market and production base is to comprise free internal movement of 
goods, services, investment, capital and skilled labor.  The prospect of labor mobility that the AEC 
promises can have a lasting impact on growth and job creation but will require Lao PDR to embark on a 
skills development program to remain competitive.  

9 

 
 
 
31. 
Lao PDR has made strong commitments to integrate into the multilateral trading system, 
and is close to acceding to the World Trade Organization (WTO).  WTO accession, while unlikely to 
result in dramatic changes in trade flows and investment, is proving to be a catalyst for reform, improved 
transparency and the introduction of a rules based and non-discriminatory trading system.  As elsewhere 
the challenge will be to sustain the reform efforts and continue with implementation post accession.  
Tariffs are already comparatively low, and since 2010 Lao PDR has enjoyed duty free access to the more 
developed members of ASEAN.  From 2015, Lao PDR will in return be required to remove all remaining 
tariffs on imports of non-sensitive goods from ASEAN members to zero.   

ECONOMIC OUTLOOK 

32. 
Lao PDR’s medium term outlook is promising, driven by strong growth in the resource 
sector, despite slower growth in the global economy, vulnerability to natural disasters, and 
notwithstanding uncertainty on global demand.  Real GDP growth is projected to remain strong over 
the medium term, with increasing reliance on natural resources, in particular mining and hydropower .  
The economy is projected to maintain an annual average growth rate of 7.5 percent between 2012 and 
2015 and of 7.5 percent over the longer term (2016 to 2020).  The natural resource sector is projected to 
contribute an average of 3.0 percentage points of economic growth between 2011 and 2015 and 3.5 
percentage points between 2016 and 2020.  The economy is expected to benefit from the implementation 
of large hydropower projects under construction or in the pipeline, and from tourism and manufacturing.   

33. 
Notwithstanding this increase in resource driven growth, the non-resource economy will 
remain the country’s mainstay, contributing to 75 percent of expected GDP and more than half of GDP 
growth in the future.  The Lao economy is still expected to remain primarily rural based over the coming 
years, with 80 percent of the population living in rural areas.  Farming will continue to be the primary 
economic activity for most Lao households, with 71 percent of the labor force reporting farming, fishing 
or forestry as their main economic activity.    

34. 
Although the impact on the Lao economy of the global economic crisis has been muted, 
potential risks remain.  Although Lao PDR‘s reliance on subsistence agriculture has limited the overall 
reach of the global economic crisis, heightened uncertainty in the global economy (price volatility, the 
debt crisis in Europe, and a slowdown in regional economic growth) has led to a revision of Lao PDR‘s 
medium term growth projections down to 7.5 percent a year on average from 2012 to 2015, compared to 
an early estimate of 8 percent.  Other potential impacts of the global economic crisis include a decline in 
external demand through lower demand for Lao exports and or lower commodity prices, and lower 
foreign direct investment.  These would affect Lao exports, especially minerals and agricultural products, 
as well as FDI inflows, even though the country is relatively less exposed to the global economy 
fluctuations compared to more advanced economies in the region.   

35. 
The risk of debt distress in Lao PDR remains high – as assessed by the latest World 
Bank/IMF external debt sustainability analysis (DSA), while debt services remain comfortably 
below the policy-dependent thresholds.  The stock of external PPG debt declined to 51.8 percent of 
GDP in 2010 from 82 percent in 2005 supported by strong economic growth, appreciation of kip, and 
favorable external conditions and a high level of concessionality.  The large amount of bilateral debt that 
has been contracted in recent years has contributed to Lao‘s external debt .  In light of this, it will be 
important for the Government to improve debt management capacity and develop a medium-term 
borrowing strategy, including for resource sector activity, as well as greater disclosure of borrowing 
plans.  Non-concessional foreign financing should also be strictly limited to commercially-viable projects.  
In this context, efforts should be made to build capacity and establish appropriate governance structures to 
assess the quality, viability and growth benefits of debt-financed projects.  In addition, the Lao financial 
system is vulnerable to systemic shocks, as well as exploitation for money laundering, in the medium 
term due to a sub-standard regulatory framework, limited enforcement and inadequate supervision.   

10 

 
 
 
II. 

DEVELOPMENT CHALLENGES  

36. 
Lao PDR is in the midst of an economic transformation which comes with great 
development opportunities.  Growth rates have been impressive over a long period and are expected to 
continue.  The country is blessed with many natural endowments that are contributing to growth, and is 
located in the center of a fast growing region.  There are no signs of political instability, and the 
Government has shown strong commitment to its development strategy.  Decades of Government and 
development partner investments in the country are now paying dividends in the form of better 
infrastructure, a more educated population, and greater public sector capacity.  A young population is 
available to provide the manpower for further development.   

37. 
Nevertheless, this transformation comes with important challenges.  The regional dynamic 
has helped to drive growth and development in Lao PDR but is also at the heart of the country‘s 
development challenges.  In particular, rapidly accelerating regional demand for energy and natural 
resources give rise to a number of interconnected challenges described below, the response to which will 
shape Lao PDR‘s development for decades. 

SUSTAINABLE NATURAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT  

38. 
Primary among these challenges is the sustainability of natural resource management.  The 
country has long exploited its rich forest resources, and is increasingly turning to its mineral, land, and 
water resources to increase the pace of growth.  Lao PDR has over 20,000 megawatts of hydropower 
potential and considerable known mineral resources, despite low levels of detailed exploration to date.  
Lao PDR also still has relatively rich forest resources, although they are on a declining trend .  The pace of 
exploitation has picked up considerably over the last decade, largely driven by foreign direct investment, 
and the demand for energy, minerals, timber, and agricultural products in regional markets .  For example, 
in the hydropower sector there are now ten large hydropower projects in operation, five under 
construction, and a further 60 large projects at the planning and feasibility stages, the management of 
which requires enormous institutional capacity.   

39. 
International experience has shown that a number of factors will be critical to ensuring the 
country’s natural resource wealth contributes effectively to socioeconomic development .  First, 
environmental and social impacts will need to be carefully managed to avoid unnecessarily depleting the 
country‘s productive resource base and jeopardizing the livelihoods and opportunities of many local 
communities.  The loss of forest is a particular concern in the Lao context given that households are very 
dependent on agricultural land, rivers, and forests for income and food .  For example, even an average 
urban household depends on own-grown rice for 50 percent of its rice consumption, and this increases to 
94 percent for poor households.  The reliance on wild meat as source of protein is also very high: up to 20 
percent of meat consumed by the population comes from the wild .  Malnutrition is highest (above 50 
percent) in those households that are most reliant on wild food and own rice production, thus the loss of 
forest has most serious consequences for those villagers who rely most heavily on the forest to achieve 
food security and nutrition. 

40. 
Second, Lao PDR’s capacity to effectively select, oversee, monitor, and manage a large 
number of projects will need to be strengthened.   Institutional development must be aligned with the 
challenges of natural resource sector management in two crucial ways .  The first is the national portfolio-
level question of whether a country is doing the right projects and the second the project-level concern of 
whether a country is doing the projects right. 

11 

 
 
 
 
Box 3: Lao Development Report 2010: Natural resource Management for Sustainable Development  

Lao PDR’s wealth of natural resources represents a significant opportunity for the country future 
development. Lao PDR is richer in natural capital than an average developing country, because its natural 
capital -- forests, agricultural land, water and hydropower potential, and mineral resources -- comprise more 
than half the country‘s total wealth. This beneficially compares to an average developing country, with one -
third of wealth made by the natural capital. With appropriate macroeconomic and governance policies, Lao 
PDR‘s natural resource wealth can significantly contribute to rapid, sustainable growth and poverty reduction. 
Countries that have been managing these natural assets carefully were able to move up the development ladder 
– investing more and more in produced capital and infrastructure, as well as into the human capital such as 
skills and education of the population, strong institutions, innovation and new technological know -how. 

There are also significant risks associated with natural wealth that already have or may soon manifest 
themselves. At the national level, the risks are macroeconomic or involve the opportunity costs of large -scale 
investments. At the micro level, there is always a risk that inve stments agreed upon on a case-by-case basis in 
hydropower or mining may not represent the best possible use of the natural resources given the socioeconomic 
goals of the country.  The challenges of an expansion in the exploitation of the natural resource w ealth lie in 
several areas, and the report considers each of them in detail, including: social and environmental challenges, as 
mining and hydropower touch upon the lives of more people in more poor areas than before, and as impacts of 
several projects may overlap geographically; governance gaps at national and local levels, if the administrative 
capacity to manage the expansion of exploitation might not correspond to the volumes of extraction; and finally 
macroeconomic risks include volatility and a possible slow-down in industrialization (Dutch disease) .  

The first Lao Development Report brings to the fore the following general principles to translate the Lao 
natural resource endowment into social and economic development gains : developing only a part of the natural 
resource wealth will still allow to achieve Government NSEDP goals; for best growth results, capacity to 
monitor projects needs to be aligned with the speed of expansion; being strategic in choosing the right projects 
and doing them right will be essential to success; proactive poverty reducing policies will require fiscal 
sustainability of spending of the revenues from mineral extraction, with a view to macro stability, specific 
priorities in non-resource and private sector development.  

Maintaining a strategic approach to investments in natural resources that takes into account administrative 
capacity will help to ensure that projects are selected that are financially viable and that have few manageable 
environmental and social effects. This can be achieved by paying careful attention to the cumulative effects of 
multiple projects on the environment and social landscape. Taking a strategic approach will require careful 
advance planning of projects at the sector, river basin, local, and national levels as well as the development of 
mitigation strategies to offset any negative impact on local people and on the environment. 

Ensuring that such a strategic approach translates into implementation on the ground will require 
strengthening the institutional coordination mechanism by systematically involving all relevant actors in the 
national resource management process, with clearly defined roles and accountability for the implementation of 
national policy and sector strategies. 

41. 
Doing the right projects is about developing the optimal national portfolio of projects .  This 
entails ensuring the portfolio is aligned with the government‘s development strategy and the 
government‘s capacity to oversee projects effectively.  It also includes prioritizing projects that offer the 
best net returns from a economic, social, environmental and financial perspective, and identifying the 
trade-offs associated with land and water use by the projects.  These choices usually require a clear policy 
framework and sector strategy.  Doing the projects right is about establishing the optimal governance 
arrangements over the natural resource management process, spanning the legal and contractual 

12 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
arrangements for project development; implementation, monitoring and oversight of projects; and the 
collection and use of revenues from these projects. 

42. 
Third, Lao PDR will need to attract world-class sponsors and financial institutions to 
partner with to develop hydropower, mining, forestry and agricultural potential in a way that is 
sensitive to environmental and social issues.  The Nam Theun 2 project demonstrated the country‘s 
ability to adhere to the rigorous environmental and social safeguards demanded by high quality sponsors, 
as have several other large mining and hydropower projects.  Such success, combined with high levels of 
foreign interest in investing in the natural resource sectors in Lao PDR, provides a situation in which the 
Government can afford to become increasingly selective about the quality of investors that it provides 
licenses to.  In this regard, as part of a joint Bank group strategy, IFC plans to support direct investments 
in the hydro sector to attract sponsors and financial institutions that are leaders in the implementation of 
best practice environmental and social standards. 

MACROECONOMIC MANAGEMENT AND COMPETITIVENESS   

43. 
Rapidly growing financial inflows in the country natural resources sectors fueling economic 
growth call for an acceleration of economic policy and institution reforms to take up the 
macroeconomic management challenges posed by resources led economic growth .  First, medium 
term macroeconomic coordination will need to be strengthened to monitor and manage the country‘s 
exposure to natural resource revenues and associated risks, to strategically plan for large public revenues 
to be allocated to the country priority goals or set aside for future generations depending on absorptive 
capacity, and to mitigate a possible loss of competitiveness in the non resource tradable sectors.  Second, 
Lao PDR will need to improve the competitiveness of the non resource sectors, which are the source of 
most of country labor and jobs, and where attracting investment will require an even better investment 
climate than in the non-resource rich setting.  Third, core public sector management needs to be 
strengthened to plan, allocate, manage and report on public finances in a situation where public resources 
are expected to grow significantly.  Finally, the ultimate challenge is to ensure that public economic 
policies, programs and mechanisms are in place to enable increased public resources to be channeled and 
used effectively for public service delivery and improvement of peoples‘ livelihood.   

44. 
There are many constraints in the business environment that hinder Lao’s competitiveness 
in the non-resource sectors.  First, labor productivity is lower than in neighboring countries and lower 
than in countries with a similar level of income and there is a lack of skilled labor force in many 
industries.  Poor quality education that is not well aligned with market demand and a lack of product 
diversification in the non-resource sector also limits job opportunities for the country‘s ―youth bulge‖ and 
contributes to widening inequality.  Third, tax administration is viewed by businesses as a major obstacle 
and firms spend an abundant amount of time interacting with tax officials.   

45. 
Access to finance is another major challenge to firm start-up, maintenance and expansion 
with firms citing the extensive requirements by banks for loan documentation and collateral as key 
barriers.  Access to finance can be addressed through a number of policy measures, including developing 
a moveable collateral registry, further developing the credit information system, and promoting leveling 
the playing field between the private and state-owned banks.  In addition, the regulatory authorities can 
promote information disclosure, financial literacy campaigns, and new forms of financ ing, such as mobile 
banking, that can help to facilitate outreach.  Finally, there is a need for strengthening the banking sector 
supervision and monitoring which, although starting from a low base, has witnessed a very fast growth 
with relatively loose regulation over the last decade.  This will require efforts to upgrade the legal and 
regulatory framework, build the needed infrastructure, improved methods of supervision and 
enforcement, and enhanced quality accounting and disclosure by banks.  In the past, the Bank group‘s 
support to the financial sector has been slow due to limited engagement with the Bank of Lao.  Given the 
growth of the sector, it will be important to redouble efforts to improve our policy dialogue with the Bank 
of Lao while simultaneously identifying additional entry points and counterparts for discussion.  

13 

 
 
 
46. 
Although Lao PDR has made progress in improving the business environment over the past 
five years, there is a full agenda of reform that needs to be pursued if Lao is to build a stronger 
private sector that can propel a balanced economic growth that creates jobs and income .  Improving 
the business enabling environment for non-natural resource sectors will require the acceleration of 
reforms to reduce the costs of doing business in Lao PDR.  This will require efforts to close the gap 
between the de jure investment environment, and the de facto rules and procedures that the private sector 
is actually required to follow.  Similarly, efforts will be required to support further integration into the 
regional economy through the completion of a rule-based and transparent trading system that is consistent 
with the WTO and further efforts to reduce the costs of trade facilitation through improved trade related 
infrastructure and systems.   

CONNECTIVITY   

47. 
Inadequate infrastructure limits trade potential and service delivery, especially in rural 
areas.  As a result, there is a strong correlation between the access to basic infrastructure services and the 
incidence of poverty.  Lao has one of the lowest population densities in East Asia and 75 percent of the 
population lives in rural areas.  The country‘s large land area, low population density, and mostly hilly 
and mountainous topography require an extensive road network to connect people within the country and 
to the countries in the greater Mekong subregion.  This results in a relatively heavy financial burden for 
road provision and maintenance. 

48. 
Although there has been tremendous improvement over the past decade, the road network 
is not yet adequate to connect all parts of the country and meet the growing demand .  Only 53 
percent of the national roads and 3 percent of the local roads are paved.  The network is especially 
vulnerable to rainy seasons and floods, and road maintenance is a challenge .  Landslides, embankment 
erosion, road flooding, and seasonal closures occur frequently.  More than 10 percent of all district 
centers and over 40 percent of the villages do not have year-round road access.   

49. 
In the energy sector, acceleration of rural electrification is an explicit thrust of the 
Government’s poverty reduction efforts.  Increasing household connections from about 18 percent in 
1995 to almost 72 percent as of September 2011 was a remarkable achievement   However, as 
electrification moves to increasingly remote areas, grid-extension rural electrification becomes more and 
more costly, which has led the Government to promote off-grid options, with emphasis on renewable 
technologies.  Moreover, the power grid is still fragmented and inadequate to support domestic demand 
and the planned expansion of hydropower generation.  Currently, the domestic power market is served by 
three regional grids (North, Central and South) which are not connected at the high voltage level .  As a 
result, Lao PDR requires significant imports of electricity from its neighbors, which reached 45 percent of 
its total electricity demand in 2010.  The underdeveloped power grid is increasingly becoming a 
bottleneck for the expansion of hydropower generation and its connection to the GMS power market. 

POVERTY AND INEQUALITY 

50. 
Declines in poverty are not evenly distributed in Lao PDR.   Considerable differences in 
poverty rates persist among the different ethnic groups, as well as geographic areas .  Lao PDR is an 
ethnically diverse country, consisting of 49 different ethnic groups as identified by the Lao Front for 
National Construction (LFNC) in 2008, many with their own languages and unique cultures.  All three 
major non-Lao-Tai groups, who constitute about 65 percent of the population, still record poverty rates 
above 42 percent, compared to 25 percent among Lao-Tai (considered the majority group).  The pattern of 
poverty also depends on geography, with urban areas and districts along the Thai border experiencing 
rapid growth and poverty reduction.  In urban areas the incidence of poverty is 17 percent compared to 32 
percent in rural areas, where poverty tends to be worse in the mountainous northern and eastern part of 
the country, in which the non-Lao Tai ethnic groups are largely concentrated.   

14 

 
 
 
 
51. 
As with poverty, gaps in achieving the MDGs are more pronounced in remote areas and 
among the non-Lao Tai ethnic groups.  In education, for example, urban areas have near 100 percent 
literacy rates, while rural areas without roads have literacy rates below 75 percent, and the Chine-Tibet 
ethnic group records literacy rates below 40 percent.  There is a direct relationship between poverty and 
educational status, with low education leading to continued poverty and further low education .  Similarly, 
gender inequalities tend to be more pronounced among ethnic communities .  In general, women and girls 
are the most disadvantaged in the parts of the country where people in general are the poorest – those 
without access to road and those in non-Lao Thai ethnic groups.   

52. 
A number of 
interlinked factors contribute to social exclusion and 
inequalities .  
Approximately 42 percent of Lao PDR‘s population lives in mid- and upland areas that are difficult to 
access for service delivery and are remote from markets.  Language barriers, varying cultural practices 
and attitudes complicate communication.  Private sector practices are also adding a layer of complexity.  
Commercialization and associated opportunities for off-farm jobs are providing growth and employment 
opportunities in some areas.  However, this increasing penetration of rural space by market actors is also 
increasing vulnerability among some communities, particularly those who risk losing access to land or 
control over resources, or those who lack the skills needed to earn income in other ways.  There are also 
institutional obstacles that lead to social exclusion and inequalities, such as a continued predominance of 
a top-down orientation in policy making at all levels, and an underdeveloped civi l society.  Being one of 
the poorest countries in the region, Lao PDR also suffers from a lack of funds, and could benefit from 
enhanced capacity in order to implement policies in a more efficient way. 

PUBLIC SECTOR INSTITUTIONS  

53. 
Experience from other resource rich countries indicates that the quality of institutions is 
crucial in determining whether resource wealth is a springboard to long term development .  Lao 
PDR‘s institutions have undergone promising improvements over the past five years, particular ly in 
clarifying responsibilities through restructuring ministries, strengthening its public financial management 
system and improving internal oversight mechanisms.  Yet, as with other low-income countries, Lao PDR 
faces important gaps in accountability, regulatory quality, and government effectiveness .  As the impact 
of natural resource exploitation on the Lao economy is poised to grow dramatically, this institutional gap 
remains a crucial challenge that will increase over time if the government does not take strategic and 
continued action to enhance governance and institutional capacity. 

54. 
Lao PDR’s central-local government relations model is still evolving, and requires 
continued focus in order to put in place the processes, resources, and capacity required to 
effectively deliver services at the local level .  Lao PDR has always had a significantly deconcentrated 
form of administration, and the Government is in the process of rebalancing the model to provide for 
centralized revenue collection but continued decentralized expenditure.  The ongoing reform agenda will 
need to include rules based budget formulas to appropriately allocate public resources back to local 
government, increase the capacity of local governments to translate these resources into results, and to 
introduce mechanisms to strengthen the accountability of local government to local people.     

55. 
Despite some notable successes, public financial management reforms have been hampered 
by inadequate institutional mechanisms and implementation capacity.  In particular, the link between 
policy priorities and budgeting needs to be strengthened.  The budget needs to be linked better to planning 
and to recurrent and capital expenditures.  Establishing a credible and predictable annual budget calendar 
and a medium fiscal framework are also important. Budget execution and revenue administration 
processes warrant modernization. Procurement legislation is in place yet implementation has been 
challenging.  External accountability institutions are in early stage of development.  Targeted assistance 
will be necessary to strengthen both executive and legislative institutions and systems to effectively and 

15 

 
 
 
 
efficiently execute the budget and administer the revenue collection, as well as to hold Government 
responsible for the budget outcomes. 

56. 
Institutional coordination and capacity challenges in light of the country rapid and resource 
based development path call for an acceleration of public sector reforms.  The civil service pay 
structure is compressed and competitiveness of the pay has been eroded as the economy has grown .  The 
legislative framework allows provinces significant leeway in planning budgetary allocations but capacity 
and coordination between central government agencies and provinces leads to difficulties in 
implementation government policies uniformly nationwide.  Institutional coordination within and 
between agencies at the central government level responsible for governance of public procurement is 
limited and fragmented.  There is a fledging external accountability function through the independent 
State Audit Organization and the National Assembly, but capacity of these agencies needs to be 
significantly upgraded to bridge the growing governance gap. 

VULNERABILITY TO NATURAL DISASTER 

57. 
Lao PDR has always been vulnerable to droughts and floods.  Between 1966 and 2009, Lao 
PDR experienced an average of 1.5 severe flood or drought events every year.  In the past 5 years, the 
country was hit by the Kammuri flooding (August 2008) which affected about 200,000 people and 
damaged 50,000 hectares of arable land, followed by Typhoon Morakot (August 2009) and Typhoon 
Ketsana (September 2009) which caused significant damages to several provinces in the central and 
southern parts of Lao PDR.  Typhoon Ketsana alone affected more than 180,000 people and the total 
damage and loss amounted to USD 58 million, which was about 0.4% of GDP.  In mid 2011, the country 
was hit by typhoons Haima and Knock-ten causing $200 million worth of damage and loss.  More than 
500 000 people were affected and 38 deaths were reported.   

58. 
Global and regional climate change projections suggest that natural disasters in Lao PDR 
are likely to intensify and increase in frequency.  Natural disasters in Lao PDR impact all development 
sectors but the hardest hit are agriculture, road transport, and housing.  In addition, poverty patterns mean 
that even low intensity natural disasters increase the vulnerability of rural households .  For example, since 
agriculture is mostly dependent on rainfall, even a modest drought decreases local food security.  On the 
other end of the spectrum, as major urban centers expand and new infrastructure is built with inadequate 
land use planning and inadequately enforced building codes, vulnerabilities are fast accumulating in such 
urban centers.  In short, risks are accumulating at faster rate than the capacity to respond is being built. 

III. 

GOVERNMENT STRATEGY  

59. 
The Government’s development vision is set out in the Long Term Strategy of Socio 
Economic Development to the Year 2020 and implemented through rolling five-year plans that 
provide the overarching development strategy and framework for prioritizing Government expenditures .  
The main objective of the Government‘s strategy is achieving the MDGs and graduating from Least 
Developed Country status by 2020, and the successive five year plans have been centered on these 
ambitions.   

60. 
The most recent five year plan, the Seventh National Socio Economic Development Plan 
(NSEDP7) was adopted by the National Assembly in June 2011 and became operational in October 
2011.  The plan was developed after extensive consultations with key stakeholders and development 
partners.  A Joint Staff Assessment Note was discussed by the Board along with the NSEDP7 on January 
12, 2012. 

61. 
The fundamental objective of the NSEDP7 is to gradually transform Lao PDR into a more 
open, private sector led economy.  To this end, the NSEDP 7 establishes four overarching goals: (i) 
Ensure continuation of national economic growth with security, peace and stability, and ensure GDP 

16 

 
 
 
growth rate of at least 8 percent annually and GDP per capita to be at least USD 1,700; (ii) Achieve the 
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by 2015, and adopt appropriate technology, skills and create 
favorable conditions for graduating the country from Least Developed Country (LDC) Status by 2020; 
(iii) Ensure the sustainability of development by emphasizing economic development with, cultural and 
social progress, preserving natural resources and protecting the environment; and (iv) Ensure political 
stability, peace and an orderly society.  The NSEDP7 aims to restructure the economy such that the main 
drivers of growth shift from agriculture to industry and the service sectors .  The Government estimates it 
will require total investment of about US$ 15 billion (32% of GDP) to finance this plan, derived largely 
from domestic and foreign private investment (50-56% of total investment) and ODA (26-28% of total 
investment). 

62. 
To achieve these goals, the NSEDP proposes to (i) build a strong base for sustained economic 
growth so to drive the nation out of the status of a least-developed country, reduce poverty, support an 
economic and labor structural shift from agriculture to industry, share the benefits of development with 
all; promote small and medium enterprises; and promote people‘s participation; (ii) focus on rural 
development and poverty eradication and reducing income disparities; (iii) continue education reforms 
and support human resource development, upgrade and expansion of educational opportunities and labor 
skills, good health and sanitation, building better management staff and high skilled workers; (iv) 
strengthen the effectiveness of public administration, rule of law, fight against corruption, (v) optimize 
the use of natural resources, increase cooperation and integration at regional and global levels, raise 
competitiveness, develop socio-economic infrastructure; (vi) implement industrialization strategies, with 
a focus on large projects and small and medium enterprises willing to integrate regionally and globally. 

63. 
The NSEDP7 goals are ambitious but largely achievable.  High commodity prices coupled 
with a pipeline of hydropower and mining projects bring the 8 percent growth target within reach, 
although this is dependent to some degree on the global economic outlook.  The Government has outlined 
clear and specific objectives for increased international and regional integration as a means of achieving 
economic and social development targets.  The focus on the sustainability of natural resource 
development is welcome in a resource rich country such as Lao, and the NSEDP7 identifies a number of 
measurable targets related to natural resource management .  Social sector goals are appropriate although 
the national targets do not reflect the significant geographic variations within the country. 

64. 
Although the NSEDP7 benefits from a stronger focus on MDG achievement than in the 
past, significant intervention will be required to achieve them all .  In particular, the MDGs on 
malnutrition, maternal health, immunization, access to water and sanitation in rural areas, and loss of 
environmental resources are unlikely to be realized without increased Government focus and expenditure.  
To that end, the NSEDP7 proposes appropriately to increase allocations to social sectors, but proper 
sequencing and prioritization of expenditures, along with monitoring of their impact, will be critical to 
success. 

65. 
NSEDP7 could benefit from stronger focus in a number of areas.  First, there could be more 
elaboration of how macro-economic risks and reform implementation will be monitored.  Second, there 
are a number of areas, particularly infrastructure and natural resource extraction, where greater focus on 
prioritization, sequencing and capacity development would improve the affordability and effectiveness of 
targets.  Finally, the NSEDP7 is silent on strengthening institutions of public accountability which will be 
critical to the overall success of public sector management reforms.   

66. 
The CPS will be closely aligned with the NSEDP7 .  The Bank Group program of engagement 
will support each of the areas listed in paragraph 61 that were identified by the government as priorities.  
In some areas, Bank support will consistent of a full range of instruments, while in others, the Bank will 
provide only analytical support.  The Bank will work closely with development partners to ensure 
complementarity and alignment of development resources.   

17 

 
 
IV. 

LESSONS AND FEEDBACK  

LESSONS FROM THE CAS COMPLETION REPORT 

67. 
The 2005 CAS included some bold and potentially risky activities, most obviously the NT2 
project, but also commitments to budget support operations, community driven development, and policy 
reforms in a low capacity environment.  Given this ambition, the performance of both the Government 
and the WBG on the formulation and implementation of the CAS during the past six years is impressive .  
However, success in its turn demands raising the level of engagement in the next CPS.  The results 
assessments above have identified a number of lessons going forward (see Annex 2). 

68. 
The success of NT2 provides a lesson on the importance of taking calculated risks for 
transformational project and devoting resources to risk mitigation.  The successful achievement of 
high social and environmental standards in the NT2 project demonstrates what is possible in the Lao 
context.  While each future hydropower project will differ significantly in its scale and the nature of its 
impacts, and therefore in the approach to mitigation and management, NT2 will continue to serve as a key 
benchmark for future projects and the learning platform for strengthening Government‘s capacity to 
manage the sector as a whole.  The World Bank Group is well positioned to continue supporting the 
government and the private sector in building institutional and physical capacity for sustainable 
hydropower development in Lao PDR. 

69. 
Capacity building remains critical but needs to be approached differently .  Identifying 
capacity as a separate CAS pillar was successful at raising the profile and elevating the discussion of the 
issue as a binding constraint.  Implementation of this pillar, however, highlights the need to embed 
capacity interventions within broader sectoral programs rather than separate approaches or activities, and 
to better capture results.  Success in capacity building has been concentrated around sectors, namely 
public financial management, rural electrification and roads, where there was programmatic, sustained 
and sizable engagement involving multiple instruments and coordination with other donors.    

70. Manage the selection of Bank instruments in order to group Bank interventions into 
broader programs.  Selectivity is a challenge in a country with large needs and a supportive, reform 
oriented Government.  While the proliferation of small projects has provided a platform for deeper 
engagement in some sectors, given the associated costs of preparation and supervision and the demands 
on Government capacity, a smaller number of larger projects – or programs including several related and 
mutually reinforcing activities – that are closely aligned with Government priorities should have a greater 
impact in both immediate results and in developing institutional capacity.    

FEEDBACK FROM CONSULTATIONS   

71. 
Under the auspices of the Ministry of Planning and Investment, the Asian Development 
Bank (ADB) and the World Bank organized a Joint Consultation Workshop on their respective 
Country Partnership Strategies in June 2011.  Participants included national and provincial 
representatives from the Government of Lao PDR, development partners, private sector and civil society.  
The consultation involved sharing joint analysis and learning on the Lao PDR context and progress in 
development and presenting ADB and World Bank draft Country Partnership Strategies.  Participants also 
took part in breakout groups to discuss principal constraints and opportunities in five key strategic 
themes:  competitiveness and connectivity; public sector management; inclusive development; natural 
resource management, and health and education.  Participants also explored what strategies and actions 
the Bank and ADB could undertake to address these constraints (see Annex 11).  There was broad 
agreement that the themes selected represent many of Lao PDR‘s binding constraints to development .  
Participants noted that the themes are inextricably linked and urged the Bank to develop a country 
strategy that recognizes these links.   

18 

 
 
 
 
V. 

THE COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY 

STRATEGIC OVERVIEW 

72. 
Building on the Government’s successful impressive growth and poverty reduction record, 
the Bank group will work in partnership with Lao PDR as it lays the foundations to become an 
advanced economy.  Consistent with the directions articulated in the NSEDP7, the CPS will support 
efforts to bolster Lao PDR‘s competitiveness and connectivity among its neighbors to better integrate the 
country regionally and ultimately, internationally.  It will also support country‘s efforts to exploit their 
natural resource wealth sustainably and equitably. To translate the expected benefits from increased 
competitiveness and sustainable natural resource management into inclusive development, the Strategy 
will support the Government‘s efforts in poverty reduction as well as improving the quality of education 
and health care especially for the poor. To achieve these three strategic objectives, building institutions 
and strengthening public sector management would be a cross-cutting challenge.     

73. 
Taken together, the Bank group strategy can be distilled as Stronger Institutions for 
Sustainable and Inclusive Development in full support of the NSEDP7.  To this end, the CPS identifies 
three Strategic Objectives linked by one Cross-Cutting Theme: 

 Cross-Cutting Theme:  Stronger Public Sector Management:  Institutional capacity in the public 
sector is a cross cutting challenge in Lao PDR, limiting the Government‘s ability to design and 
implement its programs.  Indeed, the achievement of each of the strategic objectives will require 
some strengthening of public sector management, which makes this theme the core and unifying 
theme of this strategy.  In the past, Government resource constraints meant that development 
spending was dominated by projects that were funded, designed and implemented by donors.  
Financial resources derived from natural resource exploitation have, for the first time, created the 
fiscal space to enable broader public spending.  The degree to which increased expenditures will 
be translated into better social outcomes will hinge on the extent to which executing agencies are 
able to coordinate macroeconomic policies and design effective programs and provincial 
authorities are able to implement them.  Since Governance is inextricably linked to capacity in 
Lao PDR, strengthening institutions will also go a long way to stemming emerging governance 
challenges.   

 Strategic Objective 1 on Competitiveness and Connectivity will focus on using investment and 
analytical services to support diversification of trade and private sector development and a 
competitive and efficient regulatory framework for private sector, to strengthen the linking 
mechanism between GDP growth and household income growth.  Addressing the skills agenda 
will also be a critical aspect of competitiveness.  To improve connectivity, we will work to 
increase access to improved infrastructure services in transport and energy.  

 Strategic Objective 2:  Sustainable Natural Resource Management will strengthen governance 
and management of the hydropower and mining sectors, including sustained Nam Theun 2 
implementation.  It will also use investment and advisory services to engage high quality 
investors in developing Lao PDR‘s hydropower, mining, forestry and agricultural potential in a 
way that mitigates associated environmental and social issues.  We will also work with the 
Government to seek to conserve Lao PDR‘s biodiversity.   

 Strategic Objective 3 on Inclusive Development will support increased utilization and quality of 
essential maternal and child health services.  Access to and quality of primary education in 
targeted, disadvantaged districts will also be addressed.  We will also work to ensure that local 
populations and businesses, in particular in remote rural areas and among ethnic groups and 
women within these groups, have the opportunity and resources to participate in and benefit from 
economic growth, using bottom-up participatory approaches. 

19 

 
 
 
74. 
Lessons from implementation of the last country strategy suggest that capacity development 
is better achieved by integrating capacity development components into interventions across the 
country program rather than as a stand-alone CPS objective.  To that end, the CPS will draw from 
the successful capacity development efforts in the road sector and apply these lessons to other sectors .  In 
addition, the country team will work with development partners to align their efforts to support the 
Government‘s implementation capacity.  Because local governments remain critical to service delivery, 
building their capacity is critical, with provincial and district level capacity development targets included 
in the CPS. 

75. 
As Lao PDR continues its development path, empowering women and girls will be critical to 
translating the country’s economic growth and demographic dividend 
into development 
achievements.  Thanks to strong commitment from the Government, the human development trends are 
mostly positive, particularly in urban lowland areas, and are expected to continue to improve .  
Improvements include increased coverage of antenatal care, an increase in the number of births attended 
by skilled medical staff, and improved enrollment rates from girls .  While a great deal has been achieved, 
some indicators show slow progress.  Healthcare for pregnant and new mothers, and maternal and child 
malnutrition are areas of particular concern, as are the difficulties that girls in remote areas and from 
ethnic groups face in pursuing quality education.   

76. Women are actively participating in the labor force and are increasingly running their own 
businesses.  However, women‘s businesses tend to be smaller than male-owned business and women 
report greater difficulty in accessing financing and technical skills .  Improvement of the road network is 
providing better access to services and job opportunities, all of which tend to greatly improve women‘s 
wellbeing.  However, increased road penetration into remote areas, as well as economic development 
activities (such as construction, and tourism) also carries risks, including increasing the spread of sexually 
transmitted diseases from construction crews, truckers, and tourists.  With economic integration, 
migration and trafficking are also becoming more prominent .  Increased agricultural productivity and 
opportunities for off-farm jobs are helping pull some households, and certain areas, out of poverty, and 
providing new economic opportunities for some women.  Nevertheless, for women in households and 
areas that have limited assets, or those who lose access to productive land and lack the skills needed to 
earn income in other ways, the commercialization of agriculture may increase vulnerability.  Shifting 
from subsistence-based to market-oriented household economies is particularly difficult for women in 
non-Lao-Tai ethnic groups whose cultural roles, limited Lao language and technical skills, often leave 
them unprepared to engage with the market. 

77. 
Gender concerns have been well integrated into the Lao PDR country program and will 
continue to figure prominently in the CPS.  Responding the gender situation in Lao PDR, Government 
priorities, and the World Bank‘s comparative advantages, the long term priority for the World Bank is a 
two-pronged approach that responds both to gender issues in remote, rural areas and are focusing on 
reducing vulnerability; as well as responds to gender issues in the more dynamic urban areas and are 
focusing on increasing opportunities.

KEY ENGAGEMENT PRINCIPLES  

78. 
The Bank group’s development impact in Lao has been substantial and well appreciated.  
Lao PDR‘s development needs and strong portfolio performance allowed the Bank group to mobilize 
additional resources from IDA and development partners, expanding the program beyond what was 
envisioned in the last CAS.  Despite this positive outcome, there is a compelling case for a more focused 
program, with fewer standalone projects and a more programmatic approach to projects and trust funds.   

79. 
First, resources are constrained.  Pressures on the administrative budget have increased over 
the past several years as the program has grown, administrative budget has been flat, and the costs of 
running country programs in the dynamic Asia region have risen.  IDA resources are also limited, albeit 
rising in parallel with improving country performance, and are inadequate relative to country demands. 

80. 
Second, the experience of the Nam Theun 2 project and related program illustrated how 
concentrating resources around a program can pay enormous development dividends .  NT2 was 
transformative because it acted as a lynchpin for reforms in areas outside of the actual project, such as 
revenue management, environment protection, livelihood development, and developed the overall 
capacity throughout the Government.  A piecemeal approach is unlikely to have such a strong 
development impact 

81. 
Third, there are sectors in Lao PDR where donor resources are concentrated, stretching the 
already thin capacity in some Ministries.  In addition, the start-up costs of engaging in new sectors are 
very high in terms of staff resources needed to build Government capacity and trust.  This investment is 
difficult to justify in sectors where there is already significant donor presence, arguing for a better 
division of labor between the Bank group and other development partners 

82. While the arguments in favor of greater selectivity are strong, the challenge is determining 
what principles should drive these choices.  In the last CAS period, NT2 acted as a tool for selectivity 
since almost all interventions were linked to the infrastructure and policies necessary for its successful 
completion.  In the absence of NT2 to shape the future program several principles, derived from the 
experience of implementing the last CAS and confirmed through Government and stakeholder 
consultations, may help focus our strategy and the nature of our engagement: 

 Leverage and Partnership:  The World Bank group will remain a comparatively small financial 
player in comparison to some other ODA and FDI providers, and particularly in comparison to 
flows from neighboring countries.  Leveraging resources, internally within the Bank group and 
with development partner, will reduce transaction costs and enhance our impact; 

 Ambition and Long-term Positioning:  Several high risk projects, notably NT2 and the Poverty 
Reduction and Support Operation (PRSO) series, have yielded high returns, and position the 
Bank group to tackle some of the bigger issues facing the country.  Moreover, by reaching 
beyond the easy issues and anticipating emerging needs and risks, the Bank group has the 
opportunity to remain relevant to the country which is going through a dynamic transformation.  

 Programmatic:  The Bank group has had the greatest impact when a series of engagements are 
brought to bear on a shared objective.  Programmatic and coordinated activities also reduce 
fragmentation of staff work programs and demands on Government. 

83. 
Applying these principles, the proposed program builds on existing instruments or 
relationships, and relies heavily on development partner resources to maximize impact while minimizing 
the demands on the Government and Bank group resources.  Only one project, the Environmental 
Management Project, involves engaging with a new ministry, the newly established Ministry of Natural 
Resources and Environment, a counterpart where a strong relationship will be critical to the successful 
delivery of the entire country program.  

23 

 
 
 
 
84. Many of the results the Bank will support in Lao PDR will be achieved through the existing 
portfolio of projects under implementation.  Integrating new interventions and these legacy projects 
can support the selectivity principles in areas where reforms have succeeded and implementation is 
strong.  In other areas, a decision will need to be made about discontinuing work in particular areas once 
projects have closed, engaging in these areas through new instruments to solidify whatever gains have 
been made, or coordinating with development partners who may be better placed to engage (see Annex 
12).  Despite these challenges, the principles have led the country team to reject or sequence work in 
several areas.  For example, although urbanization and water and sanitation are growing concerns in Lao 
PDR, the Bank cannot realistically develop a programmatic approach to these problems given the 
constraints of the program.  A decision was also made to refrain from additional financing of agricultural 
inputs, where the Bank has had limited success, and instead to focus on a broader rural development 
program that combines interventions related to malnutrition, food security, agribusiness, and rural 
livelihoods. 

CPS OBJECTIVES AND EXPECTED OUTCOMES  

Strategic Objective 1:  Improving Competitiveness and Connectivity 

85. 
Outcome 1.1:  Strengthened Government capacity to support growth diversification and 
competitiveness.  Although the resources sector has brought significant benefits to Lao PDR‘s economy 
in the form of higher economic growth, an increase in fiscal revenues, infrastructure improvements, and 
improvements in environmental legislation and institutions, an over reliance on the sector as a primary 
source of economic growth poses serious risks to the sustainability of the country‘s long -term 
development.  There is a risk of increased volatility as the economy becomes more susceptible to external 
shocks driven by commodity price movements.  In addition, the sector may not generate the kind of 
broad-based job and income creation needed to benefit a wider range of Laotian people.  The Government 
plans to have the non-resource sector contribute more than half of Lao PDR‘s real GDP growth in the 
near term and 75 percent of the GDP in the medium-term.  To achieve these results, policies in Lao PDR 
should focus on creating a positive enabling environment and that supports the developmen t of the non-
resource sectors.  The Bank team will also assess and analyze skills and labor market issues in the second 
Lao Development Report to offer policy options for Government to upgrade the skill levels of the Lao 
people to better prepare for the future economy.    

86. 
Lao PDR has made significant reforms to the enabling environment for trade over the last 
five years and has deepened commitments at the regional (ASEAN Free Trade Area) and global 
(World Trade Organization) level.  The proposed program will start looking from a pre to post WTO 
accession agenda, with an increased focus on implementation of reforms and following through of 
commitments at a level that directly benefits the private sector.  Secondly, Lao trade performance is likely 
to become increasingly skewed towards natural resource (hydropower and minerals) exports in the years 
ahead.  While this presents tremendous opportunities, it also may weaken if not managed the link between 
growth and people‘s incomes and better living standards.  With an objective of graduating from least 
developed country status by 2020, Lao PDR will also need to focus increasingly on developing skills, 
improving private sector access to finance and facilitating growth in productivity, value addition and the 
discovery of new tradable sectors of comparative advantage.  Key bottlenecks remain in the trade 
enabling environment, not least with regard to the limited extent to which laws and regulations are 
implemented, the high costs associated with a poorly functioning and landlocked supply chain, an 
underdeveloped environment for trade in services, and the limited capacity of government to manage a 
modern, rules-based framework for trade facilitation.  The program of support will therefore use an array 
of instruments (TA, policy-based budget support, targeted public goods support for private sector to 
address some coordination or market failures such as pilots or matching grants for innovation) to support 
a diversified trade and private sector development agenda, so to strengthen the linking mechanism 
between GDP growth and income growth (and hence poverty reduction) in the Lao PDR. 

24 

 
 
 
87. 
A vibrant, formal private sector, especially small and medium enterprises, is critical to 
creating broad based, inclusive growth.  To that end, IFC will continue to focus on creating the 
environment for SMEs in manufacturing, agribusiness, services to formalize and grow .  IFC will also 
establish integrated investment-advisory programs to develop sustainable forestry and set the groundwork 
for a program to support international standard investment in Lao PDR‘s emerging agribusiness sector. 

88. 
In financial markets IFC and the World Bank will support the development of the 
institutional framework and infrastructure that underpins a functioning and accessible financial 
sector.  The World Bank and IFC are working together on an advisory project to develop the foundation 
of the national payment system, which is a critical part of the financial sector infrastructure.  The Bank 
will continue to encourage authorities to agree to a Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) and 
associated technical assistance, and to greater South-South learning through partnerships with regional 
central banks.  The World Bank and IFC will work together on developing a risk sharing facility to 
facilitate an expansion of credit to SMEs in Lao by the commercial banking sector by covering a portion 
of the potential losses.  In addition to responding to government requests for SME support, this pilot will 
also help to launch a broader diagnostic effort in the financial sector. The Bank group will also undertake 
analysis of the opportunities and challenges in the sector to better understand how to provide support in 
this rapidly growing sector. 

89. 
Outcome 1.2:  Increased access to improved infrastructure services in transport and energy.  
There is a strong correlation between access to basic infrastructure and reduced incidence of poverty.  
Many parts of the country lack year-round road access critical to receiving basic services and providing 
market access.  The CPS will seek to continue a robust program of road improvement and upgrading 
begun during the last CAS through additional financing of a road sector project, and eventually expanding 
with a new investment in provincial infrastructure.  Access to modern energy is a critical input to meeting 
MDGs and requires progress on two paths – access to electricity and clean cooking solutions.  The CPS 
will continue support for rural electrification and initiate the program for scaling -up access to modern 
(clean and efficient) cooking fuels and stoves.   

90. 
Lao PDR has had an impressive track-record of increasing electricity access but reaching the 
last 20 percent of the population will become increasingly difficult and costly as the grid extends into 
more remote areas and off-grid concentrates on more difficult to reach villages.  Under the Rural 
Electrification Program, the Bank will directly help the Government achieve about half of their goal of 
increasing the number of households with access to electricity.  This will be done through the IDA and 
IFC projects already underway, cofinanced by Australia, Norad and the Global Environment Facility.  
IFC will support Lao PDR‘s rural electrification goals by developing model off grid PPPs and assisting 
the Government to scale those up, and by assisting Electricite du Lao to develop as a commercial sub 
national borrower. 

25 

 
 
Box 4:  A Rural Electrification Success Story  

Over the last 16 years, the rural electrification access in Lao PDR has steadily increased from 15 percent in 1995 to 72 
percent in 2011. This – probably one of the most successful electrification stories in the world – was achieved through a 
sustained commitment from the Government, tariff reforms and subsidy incentives, capacity building in Electricte du Lao 
(EdL) and strong donors support, including the World Bank. 

The government has set a national target of 90 percent electricity access by 2020.  While the targe t is realistic, Lao PDR 
will require significant changes in the strategy as it will bring new challenges of extending the electricity service to 
populations in remote and mountainous areas where the cost of grid -based electrification is significantly higher.  In fact, 
as the electricity grid has expanded over the last decade to some of more remote areas, the average cost of grid extension 
has nearly doubled from US$450–550 per household (when the rate of electrification was approximately 50 percent) to 
about US$900 today.  However, the cost per household connection at the fringes of the grid is likely to be up to 50 
percent more than the current average, and will continue to rise as the grid is extended farther. Therefore, over the next 
ten years, the investment needs for rural electrification are estimated to reach about $70 million per year.  The 
Government and EdL recognize these new challenges and have keen interest in continuing collaboration with the Bank 
and other development partners in increasing the electricity access in poor rural areas.   

Going forward, the strategy for increasing electricity access will have to work in parallel on two tracks: (a) stretching the 
limits of grid extension by applying innovative and low cost options; and (b) accelerat ing and scaling-up off-grid 
electrification program.  On the first track, EdL should embrace a systemic and widespread deployment of lower cost 
single-phase primary network design and reticulation, and maximize the use of SWER (single -wire earth return) 
transmission lines which are proven and well established solutions for low-cost extension of power grid in remote rural 
areas.  On the second track, Lao PDR needs to focus on institutionally and operationally sustainable expansion of off -grid 
solutions, including solar home systems (SHS) and micro-grids in areas where the cost of grid based electricity would be 
prohibitively high.   

Strategic Objective II:  Sustainable natural resource management:   

91. 
Outcome 2.1:  Strengthened governance and management of hydropower and mining 
sectors, including sustained NT2 implementation.  The scale of hydropower and mining investments 
and their significance to the economy have grown significantly in recent years.  At the same time, 
regulations governing these investments and the sector more broadly are still under development, and 
significant gaps in implementation exist, particularly at the local level.  As the number of investments 
increases, implementing sector wide standards will be critical, as will encouraging transparency in sector 
governance including revenue management – where dialog about the Extractive Industry Transparency 
Initiative is already underway.  This will be supported through the existing NT2 program, which will 
remain active until 2017, and continued and expanded support for hydro and mining technical assistance 
and implementation of a hydropower strategy developed jointly with IFC.  To build on the Bank‘s 
experience and capacity in implementing NT2 and the Hydropower and Mining Technical Assistance 
project, the IFC will develop a comprehensive Advisory Services package that aims to increase the share 
of hydro projects applying appropriate environmental and social standards to address those r isks and 
contribute to the sustainable development of the sector.  IFC‘s advisory program proposes to strengthen 
the ability of local Government agencies to assess cumulative environmental and social impacts, carry out 
appropriate supervision, and help to secure funds to make such work financially sustainable.  IFC also 
plans to provide information and awareness raising opportunities for the private sector on best practice 
standards and facilitate a knowledge exchange among hydropower stakeholders, including developers and 
regional banks.   

92. 
The World Bank Group will continue to explore opportunities to support Government and 
private sector investment in well designed and environmentally and socially responsible 
hydropower projects that will not dam the mainstream of the Mekong.  The IFC is actively 
considering an investment in the Nam Ngum 3 Hydropower Project, as well as investments in other 
hydropower projects.  Should a suitable opportunity arise, the World Bank will explore the option of 
using IBRD enclave instruments to finance export-orientated hydropower projects.   

26 

 
 
 
 
 
 
Box 5:  Ongoing Commitment to the Nam Theun 2 Program 

The NT2 project was approved by the Board at the beginning of the previous Country Assistance Strategy 
(CAS) period, and the successful implementation of the project was one of the four pillars of the last CAS.  
The NT2 project includes the NT2 Social and Environment Project as well as Guarantee projects from IDA 
and MIGA, and it was accompanied by separate but complimentary policy development (the Lao 
Environment and Social Project), local development (Khammouane Development Project), and revenue 
management (Public Financial Management Strengthening Program) projects.  Since Board approval, 
implementation of the NT2 project has progressed well, and commercial operations commenced in early 
2010.  As a result, revenues are now flowing to the government from electricity sales to Thailand, and are in 
turn being invested in priority poverty reduction and environmental protection projec ts in Lao PDR.   

NT2 has also contributed significantly to broader policy and institutional development in Lao PDR, and 
provides a practical example of how to develop and manage economically, environmentally, and socially 
sustainable hydropower.  While this represents great progress, a number of the important social and 
environmental objectives of NT2 are not scheduled to be met for another few years, and the World Bank‘s 
support to NT2 therefore remains in place until the formal project closing date of 2017.  Support to NT2 will 
therefore be ongoing during the current CPS period, and is included as part of the pillar focused on Natural 
Resource management.  Complimentary work on policy and institutional development, local development, 
and strengthening public finances are also embedded in the next CPS.  As is discussed in Section V of this 
CPS, NT2 represented a high risk but potentially high return project for the Government of Lao PDR, as well 
as for the World Bank.  The strong performance of the project to date suggests that the World Bank should 
continue to be open to supporting the Government in addressing high return challenges, even if they contain 
significant elements of risk.  

93. 
Outcome 2.2:  Sustainable environmental, social and water resource management .  Rapid 
economic growth and increased foreign and domestic investment in natural resources presents both 
important opportunities for socioeconomic development, as well as challenges for the sustainable use of 
the country‘s natural wealth.  Improvements to existing policies, laws and regulations will be required, 
but just as important is strengthening enforcement through clarifying institutional responsibilities and 
developing capacity at both national and local levels.  Much of the legal, regulatory and institutional 
framework governing these sectors is evolving – most importantly through the establishment of the new 
Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment (MoNRE) – and the World Bank Group plans to 
continuing supporting these sectors through ongoing as well as new technical assistance, advisory, and 
investment projects.  The proposed Mekong Integrated Water Resource Management Project will provide 
a platform of support for the water sector, and the Bank plans to start developing a broader environmental 
and natural resource management project aimed at  strengthening environmental sector management, as a 
follow-up to the current Lao Environment and Social Project. 

94. 
Outcome 2.3:  Sustainable management and protection of forests and biodiversity.  The 
Government of Lao has highlighted an ambitious goal to achieve 65 percent of forest cover in 7th NSEDP.  
Strengthening institutional and policy framework for the Department of Forest Resources Management 
(DFRM) and the Department of Forest Inspection (DOFI) will support the expansion of biodiversity 
conservation efforts and improve illegal wildlife and timber trade control.  Similarly the Social and 
Environmental Impact Assessment Service of the new Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment 
(MONRE) will strengthen its capacity to evaluate and manage the impacts of foreign direct investment on 
natural resources.  Capacity building is needed to scale up participatory approaches to sustainable forest 
and biodiversity management at the District to Central levels.  The Department of Forestry will continue 
to develop and expand its program of independent certification through the Forest Stewardship Council 
and its engagement in Global Climate Change adaptation and mitigation efforts through the Forest 
Carbon Partnership Facility (FCPF) and the Forest Investment Program (FIP).  Through the FIP, IFC will 
explore opportunities to support the transformation of degraded and underutilized land into privately 
owned productive land through smallholder and private sector partnerships. 

27 

 
 
 
 
Strategic Objective III:  Inclusive Development  

95. 
Outcome 3.1:  Increased utilization and quality of essential maternal and child health 
services.  Despite progress on some health outcomes, continued low utilization of health services reflects 
constraints in both the supply and demand for health services.  The CPS will support continued project 
investments (focused in southern Lao PDR) to strengthen the quality and availability of health services, 
including through upgrading facilities, training and supervision for health workers, and support for 
outreach services and recurrent costs of service provision.  Project support will also pilot and evaluate 
result-based financing initiatives to improve service quality and coverage.  Demand-side constraints are 
cultural as well as financial.  The program will continue supporting Health Equity Funds to pay user fees 
for the poor; support scaling up of free maternal and child health (MCH) services in target provinces; 
complete a pilot and evaluation of condition cash transfers to improve nutrition to improve maternal and 
child health and use of health services by the poor; and support behavior change campaigns to encourage 
appropriate health seeking behavior.  Project support will be complemented by engagement through the 
PRSO to harmonize the national free MCH policy and scale up budget financing for free MCH services, 
and to strengthen monitoring and oversight for health sector expenditure. 

96. 
Outcome 3.2:  Expanded access to and improved quality of primary education in targeted, 
disadvantaged districts.  Education outcomes continue to improve in Lao PDR.  Primary education 
enrollment reached 94 percent (2010/2011) and the primary education completion rate increased slightly 
from 64.2 percent in 2008/2009 to 64.3 percent in 2010/11.  The CPS will support the implementation of 
the EFA Fast-Track Initiative Catalytic Fund and Education Development Project II- Additional 
Financing in improving education access and quality in 56 most educationally disadvantaged districts .  
Coverage will include the provision of pre-primary and primary classrooms, a school feeding program to 
provide an additional incentive for children to attend school, pedagogical interventions including school 
principal training, teacher training in multi-grade teaching, child-centered learning and inclusive 
education, as well as teaching and learning materials (textbooks, teacher guides, notebooks and other 
stationery).  Schools will also be provided with community grants to meet certain defined minimum needs 
for recurrent costs, so as to reduce the need for school authorities to seek parental contributions, which 
tend to increase the cost of schooling for poor families and serve as a constraint on enrollment and 
completion.  Periodic student assessments would be carried out to provide feedback regarding the 
learning outcomes which together with timely grade attainment provides measures of educational qual ity.  
As with school feeding, additional sets of intermediate outcome indicators would be used to monitor the 
provision of the quality inputs.   Projects support will be complemented by engagement through the 
PRSO in the implementation of the school grant program and to strengthen monitoring and oversight for 
education sector expenditure. 

97. 
Outcome 3.3:  Improved access to basic services and markets and community participation 
in rural areas.  While the country has made significant strides in providing access to basic services in 
urban areas, in many rural areas access even to the most basic services, such as clean water, is not 
available and development is progressing slowly.  The World Bank will continue to use and build on the 
achievements and community driven platforms established by the Poverty Reduction Fund (PRF), Lao 
Food Security Improvement Project (LUFSIP), Khammouane Development Project, Sustainable Forestry 
and Rural Development (SUFORD) and Rice Productivity Improvement Project (RPIP), to deliver high 
quality services and livelihood improvements in poor remote areas, using participatory, gender -sensitive 
bottom-up planning approaches, whilst also building community capacity to be more in charge of their 
own development.  In particular, this platform will focus on the most vulnerable segments of the 
population, namely non-Lao Thai ethnic groups and women, in the most remote areas of the country.  
This will be done by the Poverty Reduction Fund II project, co-financed by AusAID, Swiss Agency for 
Development and Cooperation and a JSDF grant.  There is a possibility of scaling up the program being 
financed by the JSDF in future years.  In parallel, the Khammouane Development Project Additional 
Financing, will scale up the successful model for strengthening the participatory planning process and 

28 

 
 
 
public financial management associated with the decentralized delivery of public services and 
infrastructure in Khammouane province.   

Cross Cutting Theme:  Strong Public Sector Management 

98. 
Outcome 4.1:  Strengthened Government capacity for macroeconomic management and 
policy coordination.  Increasing reliance on natural resource revenues, growing exposure to global 
economy trends and commodity markets call for strengthened capacity to coordinate macroeconomic 
policies, improve revenue administration, and the structural reform agenda for managing macroeconomic 
stability and transforming increased financial flows into development (physical or human development) 
assets.  The proposed strategy is therefore to partner with relevant government agencies and existing think 
tanks to produce analysis on macroeconomic developments and associated risks.  To facilitate the 
dialogue and formulation of policy the Bank will produce regular macro and budget economic monitors 
and debt sustainability analysis.  Through the Lao Statistical Capacity Development Project, the Bank 
will strengthen in-country statistical capacity to produce and make available timely reliable statistical 
information.  A new series of policy-based operations will support cross-sectoral policy and institutional 
reform effectiveness.  Finally, in response to Government concerns about the weak performance of state 
owned enterprises (SOE) and the potential impacts on the fiscal position, the Bank will work to raise 
awareness of corporate governance and state-owned enterprise reforms. 

99. 
Outcome 4.2: Strong linkages between planning, fiscal, borrowing strategy, and annual 
budgeting.  Budgeting in Lao PDR is incremental and not strategic.  This is because the needs based 
planning approach makes the budget an ad hoc reactionary process.  There is a need to convert this 
reactionary incremental budgeting process based on needs to one based on medium term resource 
availability where the central agencies consider the medium term resource envelope and then strategically 
allocate the available resources to high social and economic programs in a strategic manner .  In addition, 
clarifying roles and responsibilities between central government, provinces and districts will be critical to 
help improve service delivery  

100. Outcome 4.3:  Improved public finance management for appropriate revenue management.  
Lao PDR tax effort is one of the lowest in the region, at about 15 percent of GDP .  Efforts are needed to 
improve revenue policy and administration to enhance the tax effort to at least 18 percent of GDP over the 
CPS period, and to ensure that the public finance management system is capable of converting high 
revenues into better service delivery.  Furthermore, efforts are needed to ensure the budget is executed, 
reported, and monitored adequately to ensure effective and efficient use of public finances.  To do so, it is 
proposed to continue modernizing the treasury and implementing a new integrated financial management 
information system.  This will be the backbone for enhancing fiscal reporting and modernizing 
accounting and auditing standards; reducing fiduciary risks in management of public finances; improving 
the accuracy of financial statements and facilitating timely external audit; and providing funds in a timely 
manner to service delivery units.   

IMPLEMENTING THE STRATEGY 

Implementation Challenges 

101. While the reported risk level in the portfolio has increased, so has the realism .  With a 
historical unsatisfactory exit rating by IEG of 22 percent, the current level of reported risk in the portfolio 
of 14 percent translates into a realism of 64 percent, a significant improvement from the 0 percent in 
2009.  Task teams are increasingly aware of implementation challenges . Overall, absorption capacity has 
remained strong with disbursement ratios consistently above targets (20%) over the CAS period.  
However, low implementation capacity in line ministries has constrained implementation, which has been 
overcome by relying on project implementation units. More recently, gradual attempts at relying more on 

29 

 
 
 
 
 
existing ministerial departments and staff to implement projects have led to implementation delays and 
challenges; these efforts will be pursued selectively during the new CPS period.  In that context, the role 
of the Bank in implementation support remains an important factor of portfolio performance, and is 
resource intensive given the large share of the portfolio delivering highly decentralized results.   

102. The rapid expansion of the portfolio stretched the country team’s implementation support 
capacity.  Over the previous CAS period, the portfolio grew from 13 projects amounting to US$169.7 
million at the end of FY07, to 20 projects amounting to US$318.3 million.  Although the proposed 
program includes 17 Bank Group projects, as discussed above, these projects build on existing 
engagements (either through the use of additional financing and repeater projects) and are focused around 
several core ministries where relationships are strong and capacity building efforts are well underway. In 
addition, the country team is further strengthening implementation support in a number of ways.  First, we 
conduct integrated supervision of fiduciary and quality aspects throughout the portfolio .  In addition, the 
trust fund portfolio will be managed more strategically, with a focus on multidonor trust funds that 
support core CPS areas and a fewer number of smaller stand-alone trust funds. 

103. The financial management capacity in Lao PDR is very limited in both the public and 
private sectors.  There are currently no accountants with internationally recognized qualifications in the 
public sector and less than 50 in the private sector .  Financial management capacity development is 
therefore required on a broad front including preparers of financial information, internal audit/inspection, 
external audit and National Assembly levels.  Likewise procurement capacity is also limited with no 
professional procurement stream within the administration. 

104. 
In the medium term, the development of the accounting and auditing profession is the key 
to addressing this capacity gap.  If this capacity gap is not addressed in a comprehensive manner it will 
increasingly constrain progress with the PFM reforms (including proper governance accountability at the 
national and sub national levels) and Lao PDR‘s ability to be competitive in international markets.  The 
education system needs to be properly aligned to be able to produce accounting graduates in accordance 
with internationally recognized standards, a professional accounting body needs to be established to 
properly regulate the profession and international accounting and auditing standards need to be adopted. 

105. Given the vulnerability of Lao PDR to natural disasters, particular attention will be paid to 
the ability of the Bank to respond to emergencies.  This is already being tested through the ongoing 
Road Sector Project: a disaster recovery and contingency component has financed retroactively the 
recovery of Typhoon Ketsana damaged roads and is establishing an emergency contingency fund for 
quick response to the impact of natural disasters on the road network.  This contingency fund is now 
being used in response to a new Typhoon, and is expected to be replenished through additional financing. 
Beyond this successful experience under one project, we will explore with the Government of Lao PDR 
whether it is interested in using other projects in the portfolio for applying the new IDA immediate 
response mechanism. 

IDA and IFC Resources 

106. An indicative IDA 16 allocation of SDR 103 million (approximately US$160 million) will be 
available to support Lao PDR’s development in FY12-14.  This allocation includes a firm FY12 
envelope of SDR36 million (about US$55 million) and an indicative envelope of SDR67 million (about 
US$105 million) for FY13-14.1  Furthermore, the IDA resource for Lao PDR is currently provided on 

1 IDA resource envelopes are provided for 3-year replenishment cycles. For the IDA16 (FY12-14) envelope, only the FY12 
envelope is firm while estimates for FY13-14 are indicative only and can change depending on: (i) total IDA resources available 
in the respective fiscal year; (ii) the country‘s performance rating; (iii) the terms of IDA's assistance to the country (grants or 
credits) in the respective fiscal year based on its debt sustainability position; (iv) MDRI debt relief and the redistributio n of the 
MDRI compensatory resources as applicable; (v) the performance and assistance terms of other IDA borrowers; and (vi) the 
number of IDA-eligible countries. Also, the IDA envelopes are provided in SDR terms, and the US dollar equivalent amount is 

30 

 
 
 
                                                      
grant terms based on the high risk of debt distress that the country faces, although the terms of assistance 
will be updated annually based on the debt sustainability analysis. Lao PDR could also receive additional 
resources through its participation in regional projects, such as the proposed Mekong Integrated Water 
Resource Management Project.  The share of policy based operations in the FY12-14 program is 
estimated at about 20 percent, although this may be increased somewhat if warranted by accelerated 
reform momentum. 

107. 
IFC’s current investment portfolio in Lao PDR amounts to US$19.5 million, with an 
additional US$3 million devoted to advisory work on access to finance and investment climate .  IFC 
plans to scale up its investment in Lao PDR significantly in FY12-14, with a pipeline of projects 
amounting to US$70 million for investments in hydropower, SMEs and trade.  In addition, the IFC has a 
pipeline of advisory services in sustainable natural resource management and investment climate in the 
order of US$6 million from FY12-14.   

Trust Funds 

108. Trust funds are an important source of funding for the Bank’s country program in Lao 
PDR and have been integral to country program implementation.  Recipient executed trust funds are 
used to support projects through co-financing or parallel financing.  The bulk of these resources support 
education, trade development and public financial management reform.  Bank executed trust funds 
support work on donor coordination, supervision of IDA-financed projects and analytical work.  Japan, 
Australia and the European Union are the leading trust fund donors in Lao PDR. 

109. Trust funds implementation is well integrated into operational monitoring.  Development 
results achieved through the TF portfolio are captured alongside IDA results.  Annex 12 provides 
examples of such results.  Annual portfolio reviews, done jointly with the Government and ADB, cover 
all sources of funding.  Such integration is even more important given that the share of trust fund financed 
projects in the total portfolio has been increasing significantly in recent years, and now comprise about a 
quarter of total commitments. 

110. Bank executed trust funds play a critical role in work program implementation in Lao 
PDR.  About a third of staff in Lao PDR charges at least some of their time to trust funds, with about 10 
percent charging all of their time.  Additionally, almost a third of work programming costs are funded 
through trust funds.  As a result of the flat administrative budget, funding of country economic work, in 
particular, has come to rely heavily on trust funds.  This funding model may pose a challenge to the 
sustainability of such work as Lao PDR grows and attracts fewer donors.   

Results Monitoring 

111. A streamlined results matrix will serve as a management tool for annual monitoring and 
evaluation.  Past results monitoring efforts coupled with lessons from other country teams demonstrated 
the value of having a small number of well defined results where the Bank group‘s efforts can have a 
measurable impact.  The current portfolio will play a substantial role in achieving the desired results, and 
are included in the matrix.  At the project level, an initial stock taking of monitoring and evaluations 
(M&E) practices across the portfolio has highlighted several good practices in sectors where there is a 
long-standing engagement.  However, M&E arrangements vary widely and could build on a more explicit 
assessment of client M&E capacity (for example, systems reliability, data retrieval, staff availability and 
expertise, demand for data).  While many projects include M&E support (to develop frameworks or to 
improve systems) the intended support is not always mobilized which can compromise data availability 
and quality.  Efforts to further improve these M&E practices will be pursued during the CPS period.

112. To facilitate monitoring, the Lao PDR Country Team will also use the Country Portfolio 
and Results Monitoring Tool (CPRT), a web-based system for monitoring progress toward CPS 
outcomes.  The CPRT is populated with data from ISR Reports and the Bank‘s existing information 
systems, and can provide real-time links between the portfolio performance, AAA and budget to progress 
toward CPS outcomes.  The Country Team will work with sector management and task teams to ensure 
that ISRs are updated in a timely manner, in sync with implementation support missions; particular 
emphasis is placed on projects at risk, and on candor and quality in ISR reporting.   

PARTNERSHIPS 

113. The World Bank has established strong partnerships with Government of Lao PDR and 
other development partners over the past decade, and aims to deepen and broaden these 
partnerships to help achieve the CPS objectives.  The Vientiane Declaration, which follows the 
principles of the Paris Declaration, focuses on partnerships between the Government and development 
partners and among development partners.  The Round Table Process is a platform for aid effectiveness in 
Lao PDR.  There are eight Sector Working Groups co-chaired by Government and development partners.   

114. A programmatic approach, supporting key sectoral objectives and working with other 
development partners, will be critical in implementing the CPS.  During the previous CAS period, an 
increasing percentage of the portfolio was co-financed by other partners, from approximately 14.5 percent 
in FY06 to approximately 26.8 percent in the current portfolio .  Moreover, 91 percent of analytical work 
was jointly carried out with partners (according to the 2011 Paris Declaration Survey - Lao PDR Country 
Report).  A programmatic approach with co-financing or a multi-donor trust fund created opportunities 
for Government and development partners to jointly discuss key strategic issues as well as operational 
issues.  The Bank intends to build on successful examples of operational coordination and policy 
discussions around the program. 

115. While the Bank intends to build on the existing partnerships, it also aims to broaden its 
partner base to others, including emerging and non-traditional donors.  The Asian Development 
Bank and the World Bank have been working closely through joint portfolio reviews and joint missions 
on fiduciary issues, and on joint analytical work.  The two Banks also carried out the joint consultation 
for the respective CPS with stakeholders in the country.  Development partners with priorities similar to 
the World Bank Group‘s, such as Australia and European Commission will remain as key strategic 
partners for implementing the new CPS.  The Bank has worked with emerging donors such as Singapore 
on public administration issues and will continue to strengthen this effort .  The Bank will need to find a 
way to coordinate with other emerging donors and the top foreign direct investors to Lao PDR such as 
China, Vietnam and Thailand as their support and FDI to Lao PDR will have an increased and significant 
impact on the country‘s development path.   

116. 
Significant analytical work has been produced in partnership with domestic institutions, 
and future efforts here will be intensified as part of broader capacity building for effective policy 
development.  The 2011 Investment Climate Assessment was carried out in partnership with the Lao 
Chamber of Commerce and Industry, and with the Investment Promotion Department (Ministry of 
Planning and Investment).  Similarly, significant trade related analytical work has been undertaken with 
partners such as the Economic Research Institute for Trade (Government trade think tank).  

117. 
In public sector management, partnerships have been established with oversight institutions 
to strengthen domestic oversight and accountability mechanisms.  More generally, explicit systematic 
partnerships are envisaged with universities and think tanks through the proposed Lao Statistical Capacity 
Project to strengthen analytical capacity and increase demand for statistics, as well as on a more 
systematic basis through joint AAA. 

118. 
Partnerships with some of the international NGOs based in Lao PDR have been important 
at the operational level, especially in the area of environmental management.  The World Bank has 

32 

 
 
 
also worked closely with some of the Lao mass based organizations, such as the Lao Women‘s Union and 
youth groups.  Under the new CPS, the Bank will continue to partner with international NGOs where 
appropriate, and will also seek to engage with local NGOs as they develop .  NGOs could play an 
important role in building capacity in Lao PDR, particularly at the local level. 

VI. 

RISKS 

Implementation Risk 

119. Limited institutional capacity poses the largest risk to the successful implementation of the 
strategy.  There is a risk of an institutional and governance gap between the demand for natural resources 
and the capacity of the Government to manage their sustainable use will grow as more resources come on 
stream.  In particular, the institutional gap can grow when too many projects are operating at the same 
time in a country where capacity to manage and monitor projects is limited .  This could threaten the 
implementation of the portfolio as government resources are concentrated on coping with the demands of 
complex project implementation with limited fiduciary capacity.   It may also result in a lack of attention 
to environmental and social safeguards, undermining the sustainability of natural resource development.   
More broadly, institutional capacity constraints pose a challenge to efficient use of public sector resources 
for Government priorities.  This would threaten the achievement of the Government‘s ambitious growth 
and investment goals articulated through the NSEDP 7 and supported by the Bank group‘s program. 

120. These risks were the subject of a Lao Development Report in 2010 which will continue to 
form the basis for intensive dialogue around the issue at the highest levels of the Government.  This 
dialogue will continue through a number of instruments including the ongoing NT2, Lao Environment 
and Social, and Hydro and Mining Technical Assistance projects, and the new Poverty Reduction and 
Support Operation series.  A new environmental management project is also being planned .  The new 
program on planning, budgeting and revenue management will also help to ensure that priority programs 
are implemented.  

121. Although largely anecdotal, existing evidence suggests that corruption is a growing problem 
in Lao PDR, and Government has repeatedly expressed its concern about this trend .  Many of the 
features most commonly associated with systemic corruption exist in the country - heavy dependence on 
natural resource revenues, low levels of organizational capacity, constrained information access, poorly 
functioning formal and informal systems of accountability, underdeveloped civil society structures, and 
an opening-up of economic opportunities in an environment with the presence of sophisticated private 
business interests.  This combination of factors presents short-term challenges in how to mitigate 
corruption risks at the same time that it increases resistance to the development of robust systems for 
public administration.   

122. Because many of the governance related risks are linked to public finance management and 
procurement, accounting and auditing reforms will be an essential part of the mitigation strategy .  
The Government is in the process of adopting international accounting and auditing standards, and the 
Bank will support this effort through an IDF Grant and the proposed new PFM reform project .  This work 
will also support the development of the State Audit Organization and National Assembly.  More broadly, 
the country team will expand integrated supervision of fiduciary and quality aspects (piloted under the 
previous CAS), use of ORAF as a framework for managing risks during implementation (with a particular 
focus on projects reaching mid-term reviews), and encourage close cooperation between fiduciary and 
public financial management teams.   

Financial Sector 

123. Weaknesses in the financial sector are a major impediment to competitiveness and threaten 
broad based growth in Lao PDR.  If Lao PDR is to move towards a more balanced economic model 

33 

 
 
 
 
that builds the non-resource sectors, the financial system will have to become more efficient in supporting 
the development of private sector growth.  This is particularly relevant for small to medium sized 
enterprises, which make up over 90 percent of all firms in Lao, since access to finance is identified as the 
second greatest obstacle to firms doing business in Lao and may be a binding constraint to growth.  At the 
same time, limited traction by the Bank group and other development par tners have slowed efforts 
towards commercialization, transparency and sustainability.  Until there is greater demand for 
development partner assistance in the sector, mitigation measures will focus on continued financial sector 
policy dialogue with receptive government counterparts, and raising awareness of issues and 
opportunities available to modernize the sector. 

Global Economic Slowdown  

124. A global economy slowdown or shock would lead to a decline in external demand through 
lower demand for Lao exports and or lower commodity prices, and lower foreign direct investment.  
These would affect Lao exports, especially minerals and agricultural products, as well as FDI inflows, 
even though the country is somewhat relatively less exposed to the global economy fluctuations compared 
to more advanced economies in the region.  Thus, careful macroeconomic monitoring, long term fiscal 
strategy work and continued dialogue around the sustainable use of natural resource revenues are critical 
to mitigating this risk. 

125. A CPS Progress Report will be prepared in mid-FY14, as a mid-term review of CPS 
implementation.  It will assess progress to date toward achievement of CPS outcomes as gauged by 
indicators and milestones in the CPS results framework, and incorporate adjustments as needed to the 
strategy and program in light of changed circumstances.

Strategic Objective 1:  Improving Competitiveness and Connectivity 

Issues and Obstacles:   
 
Increasing integration into the regional (ASEAN) and international economy (WTO) is driving reform, but the regulatory enviro nment remains high cost with lack of 
predictability and consistency. Weak skills, poor access to finance and a landlocked supply ch ain all undermine competitiveness in the key non-natural resource sectors, 
which provide the greatest scope for diversified growth, employment generation and poverty reduction.  
Strong correlation between access to basic infrastructure and incidence of poverty.  Many parts of the country lack year-round road access critical to receiving basic services 
and providing market access. 
Increasing electricity access which will become increasingly difficult and costly as the grid extends into more remote areas and off-grid reaches more difficult to reach 
villages.

Strategic Objective 2:  Sustainable natural resource management 

Issues and Obstacles 
 Hydro/mining is growing in scale and significance to the economy.  Improvements in recent years in regulatory environment, but industry still defined by ad hoc 
approaches.  With increasing number of hydro/mining investments, assisting in introducing better and more standardized approaches to management of the sector 
 Rapid economic growth and increased foreign and domestic investment in NRM pose challenges to quality of investment and sustainability.  
 Newly established Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment (MoNRE) with responsibility for natural resource and environment and social management requires 
long-term capacity development. 
 Much of the NRM legal and regulatory framework is evolving.  Improvements to existing policies, laws and regulations as well as new ones required.  
 
Institutional strengthening and capacity development required at provincial and district levels , particularly to strengthen enforcement of regulations.  
 
Forestry, ecosystem services and biodiversity contribute tremendously to the economy and to the livelihoods of forest dependent communities.  Institutional capacity 
constraints high demand for natural resource use, and competing interests for forested land pose challenges. 
Outcome 2.1:  Strengthened governance and management of hydropower and mining sectors, including sustained Nam Theun 2 implementation 
NSEDP 7 Goals:   
 Develop hydropower sources and renewable energy in order to supply energy to the productive sectors and society, and become t he battery of ASEAN.   
 
Extractive industries should take into consideration the conservation of the resource and protection of the environment 
 
regulate the mining sector to ensure the highest return and benefits for the country, draw up legal measures for the extracti ve industries, and ensure full enforcement of 
prevailing laws and regulations; improve policies, laws, regulations and coordination procedures; and increase effectiveness and transparency in the procedures for the study

Strategic Objective 3:  Inclusive Development 

Issues and Obstacles: 
 
Lao PDR‘s slow and uneven progress in achieving health and nutrition MDGs is due in part to lack of access to quality health service and low utilization rates given 
financial barriers. 
 Direct relationship between poverty and educational status, with low education leading to continued poverty and further low education. 
 Main problem of access in targeted districts is presence of ―incomplete‖ schools which do not provide full five years of elementary schooling. 
 Considerable differences in poverty rates and social indicators persist among different geographic areas and ethnic groups.  Targeted interventions are needed to help reduce 
the risk of growing disparities that threaten the realization of Lao‘s development goals. 
 Government‘s resource constraints limit its ability to implement its poverty reduction priorities. 
 
Policy-making at all levels is characterized as top-down.  Legal space is gradually opening for the development of civil society organizations. 
Outcome 3.1:  Increased utilization and quality of essential maternal and child health services 

NSEDP 7 Goals:   
 Government should create ―conditions for people to access health services and receive quality care …[and] to attain equality in receiving health services…[and] to ensure 
quality nutrition.‖

Date of CAS:  
March 10, 2005 (Report No. 31758-LA) 
Date of Progress Report:  
May 4, 2007 (Report No. 39688-LA) 
Period Covered by the CAS Completion Report:  
March 31, 2005 to June 30, 2011 
Prepared by: 
Jayasankar Shivakumar and Zafar Ahmed, under the guidance of Maria Ionata and with 
inputs from the Lao PDR country team. 

I. 

INTRODUCTION 

This Country Assistance Strategy Completion Report (CASCR) assesses the World Bank‘s assistance 
activities in Lao PDR over the period March 31 1, 2005 to June 30, 2011.  It deals with issues relating to 
the relevance, results, and impact of the Bank‘s activities and also draws lessons for developing the next 
Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for FY2012-FY2016.  It evaluates how the Bank‘s ongoing portfolio 
of projects, new lending, program of Analytical and Advisory Activities (AAA), policy advice, Technical 
Assistance (TA), Trust Funds (TF), IFC, and the activities of other WBG agencies have supported 
selected country goals. 

The report draws on the Bank‘s 2005 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Lao PDR (Report No. 
31758-LA, discussed by the Board on March 31, 2005), and the 2007 CAS Progress Report (Report No. 
39688-LA).  The 2005 CAS for the Lao PDR outlined the Bank‘ engagement for the four year period 
covering FY2005 to FY2008 which supported the goals set forth in the National Growth and Poverty 
Eradication Strategy (NGPES), the country‘s medium-term poverty reduction strategy.  Thereafter, the 
2007 CAS Progress Report (CASPR) determined that the strategy was still relevant and well -aligned with 
Lao PDR‘s National Socio-Economic Development Plan (NSEDP 2006-2010), the Government‘s 
successor poverty reduction strategy, which built on the basic framework of the earlier program.  The 
CASPR recommended the extension of the CAS period to FY2011 with an expanded program of support 
including new lending and non-lending services and engagements. The extension enabled the CAS period 
to align with the Government‘s strategy cycle 

II. 

SUMMARY OF FINDINGS AND RATINGS 

The CAS was supported by four pillars.  These were in alignment with the country‘s goals articulated in 
the NGPES and NSEDP and refined through consultations with the client and other stakeholders:  1) 
sustain growth through improved management of key drivers--regional integration and private sector 
development, rural development and natural resource management; 2) improve social outcomes and 
reduce vulnerability through strengthened public financial management and service delivery capacities, 
and targeted poverty reduction programs; 3) adopt a strategic approach to capacity development and 
partnership in support of better NSEDP results and, 4) support implementation of NT2 as an example of 
an area-based sustainable natural resource development program that contributes to growth, improved 
social outcomes, capacity development and stronger partnerships. 

In terms of achievement of the program performance in influencing of CAS outcomes, the CAS is rated 
satisfactory.  The CAS made good progress toward all major expected outcomes.  The Bank‘s 
performance in designing and managing the implementation of the CAS program is also rated 
satisfactory.  The Bank‘s strategy was well aligned with the country‘s priorities, and sensitive to Lao‘s 
country context.  Implementation accommodated changing circumstances such as the food price crisis, 
cyclone Ketsana, and the global financial crisis.  Indeed, the design of the Nam Theun 2 project 
specifically allowed for adaptation in implementation to respond to changing circumstances.  Experience 

43 

 
 
 
 
 
 
gained from implementation provided direction for the future country programs and lessons for the 
overall strategy.   

III. CAS OBJECTIVES AND OUTCOMES 

Pillar 1:  Sustain growth through improved management of key drivers--regional integration and 
private sector development, rural development and natural resource management 

Progress under the regional integration and private sector development (supported by ICA findings) has 
been mainly driven by initiatives such as the Trade Facilitation Project and Custom and Trade Facilitation 
Project (CTFP) which have contributed to improve the trade environment (including WTO accession) and 
customs modernization using Bank and recipient executed multi donor trust funds and IDA.  These 
activities are examples of how capacity building, partnership development, and focused growth -oriented 
policy reform can be efficiently supported under the CAS.  This would not have been possible without the 
location of staff in the field with the requisite technical expertise as well as relationship skills, reinforcing 
government determination to move forward in this area of reform. 

The improvement of road infrastructure as a result of the Provincial Infrastructure Project (PIP) and the 
Road Maintenance Project 2 played a significant role in regional integration.  According to IEG‘s Project 
Performance Assessment Report for PIP, export to and import from Vietnam for the project provinces 
grew much more rapidly than they did for nation as whole.  The regional integration outcomes were 
further strengthened by the Greater Mekong Sub-region (GMS) Power Trade Projects in Lao PDR, 
Cambodia, and Vietnam to enhance power trade within the GMS with a view to also bringing affordable 
grid-based electricity to selected provinces in Cambodia through import of power from Lao PDR and 
Vietnam.  The Bank was also able to respond quickly to support Lao PDR‘s preparedness to minimize the 
regional threat posed to humans and poultry by highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) infection. 

The Bank Group has been involved in formulation of Lao PDR's long-term financial sector reform 
strategy and worked with the Government to support the development of a sound prudential regulatory 
and supervisory environment for micro-finance.  Financial and banking sector reforms have been slow, 
and effective engagement with Bank of Lao has presented challenges.  These reforms, which were 
supported through the PRSO series, gained traction late in the CAS period.  IFC has been has been 
involved in improving Lao PDR's overall financial infrastructure through advisory services and 
investments to expand access to finance, particularly for small-scale and micro-borrowers.  IFC is 
investing equity in Acleda Bank Lao (ABL), a green-field banking/microfinance operation.  IFC was also 
instrumental in the development of the Law on Commercial Banks and its implementation decree which 
allowed foreign investors to operate in the sector and led to IFC‘s first investment in the sector.  IFC also 
provided advisory support for the development of the implementation decree on the Law on Secured 
Transactions to facilitate broad use of movable assets as collateral.   

The Land Titling Project 2 promoted strengthened property rights by improving the security of land 
tenure and developing institutions at the national and provincial levels through an accelerated program of 
land titling with systematic registration and strengthened policy and regulatory frameworks.  The 
evaluation of the project noted the exemplary progress in reaching out to women in the consultative 
process.   

Work to improve the enabling environment for rural growth has been highly successful.  Rural access to 
electricity has increased dramatically during the CAS period, from 48 percent of the households in 2005 
to 71% in 2010.  This success is in part due to an innovative ―Power to the Poor‖ scheme which allows 
poor households, and in particular female-headed households, to connect to the grid.  Maintenance of 
rural roads was similarly successful, exceeding targets set in the CAS.  83% of the paved national road 
network and 46% of provincial road network are now considered to be in fair to good condition.  Success 
has been based on rapport built over years of association with government counterparts and by the work 

44 

 
 
of current WBG teams who have been able to nurture partnerships and build capacity where it is needed 
through direct implementation support to project officials.  The rural electrification program is also an 
example of close collaboration between the Bank and IFC in addressing rural electrification needs, but 
also leveraging scarce IDA resources.  IFC is also engaged advisory work on rural electrification, 
assisting the Government in addressing off grid electrification expansion through a Public - Private 
Partnership project.  Given both the criticality of these areas and the need to build on success, WBG 
engagement in these sectors will likely remain strong.   

Agricultural productivity has increased in line with CAS outcomes. However,  food security and access to 
diverse source of food remains a problem in many remote areas, with high levels of malnutrition are 
prevalent.  To address this, the Bank redoubled its efforts to increase rice productivity and community 
nutrition through resources made available during the food price crisis.  In addition, an agribusiness 
scoping study has being undertaken jointly with IFC.  The study will provide some more clarity on both 
institutional and firm specific level interventions with the goal to strengthen the agricultural supply chain 
in high potential agri-sectors.  This work will continue into the next CAS period. 

Efforts under the CAS to improve policies and institutional capacities to support more sustainable and 
participatory management and conservation of natural resources have generally been successful.  The 
opportunity offered by NT2 to escalate issues in these areas to the highest levels has been grasped by the 
WBG and supported by sufficient budget resources.  The sequencing of measures to generate political 
will, develop strategies, and implement policies and investment interventions provide lessons that can be 
applied in other areas of the CAS.  CAS outcomes on forest management and conservation have been 
achieved, but work remains to support the Government‘s goal achieving 70 percent forest cover.  This 
work was aided by the increased institutional focus on the role of forests in slowing climate change, and 
further work in this area is anticipated in the next country strategy.   

Pillar 2: Improve social outcomes and reduce vulnerability 

The expected outcomes from CAS initiatives to improve social outcomes and reduce vulnerabilities 
through strengthened public financial management and service delivery capacities and targeted poverty 
reduction programs were: strengthened public financial management capacities; improved access to and 
quality of education and health services, with an emphasis on vulnerable groups; and improved 
approaches for reducing the poverty of the most vulnerable. 

Progress on strengthened public financial management capacities has been significant as demonstrated by 
the improvement in corresponding CPIA scores on governance of public finances.  A combination of 
political will and strong technical leadership on the Government side, matched by appropriate in-field 
expertise on the WBG side, reinforced by successful efforts to promote donor coordination and raise 
resources, has worked well in this area with reforms advanced beyond what the most optimis tic observer 
would have thought possible at the start of the CAS period.  Significant progress has been made under the 
program, particularly in enforcing the revised Budget Law, and strengthening the tax, customs and 
treasury functions.  Bank support, with other donors, has contributed to the implementation of the 
Vientiane Declaration for increased aid effectiveness which allows more donors to channel their resources 
through government systems and improved harmonization of donor practices.  There has been a 
fundamental transformation in the legislative framework governing public finances and looking ahead the 
challenge will be on its effective implementation.  

Improved access to and quality of education and health services have been supported mainly through 
projects, including a Fast Track Initiative project for primary education, a broad health sector support 
project, and a project focused on maternal and child health and nutrition.  In addition, some initiatives 
have been taken under the NT2 RMA arrangements, using policy actions under the PRSOs to help 
identify priority expenditure sectors in education and health.  Progress toward access to primary education 
exceeded CAS goals, with a significant increase in school enrolment in the 19 poorest districts.  Capacity 
building around education policy and staffing met expectations, although capacity and central and local 

45 

 
 
levels remains low.  While CAS outcomes have been achieved, several issues and concerns identified 
over the CAS period suggest areas for future engagement.  These include focus on completion rates, 
quality of education, higher education and skills development, and low levels of government spending.  
Addressing donor fragmentation in the sector in order to move toward a programmatic approach will a lso 
be important to increase the impact of interventions.   

Improved access to health services was achieved during the CAS through the establishment of health 
equity funds and community based health and nutrition programs in the Health Services Improvement 
Project and the Community Nutrition Project.  While Lao has made great progress in child mortality, 
significant challenges remain in other health related MDGs, including high levels of maternal mortality, 
prompting a rethinking of the nature of Bank support to the sector which is already underway but will 
intensify in the next CAS period.  Work in the sector underscored the need to ensure that adequate 
government resources are allocated to health and that these resources are used effectively.  Low 
implementation capacity in the Ministry and poor donor coordination will also need to be addressed.  
These lessons will be incorporated into the design of the next country strategy.    

In both health and education, there has been extensive analytic work and policy dialogue, with a focus on 
teacher deployment and performance, timeliness of salary payments for staff (through a Public 
Expenditure Tracking Survey), and health financing. In response to the financial crisis, the WB also 
undertook analytic work and engaged in policy dialogue around vulnerability and social safety nets. This 
work included collaboration with government to prepare an updated poverty profile, as well as a review 
note and workshop on vulnerability and social safety nets. 

The WBG has pioneered work on improved approaches for reducing poverty among the most vulnerable 
through the Poverty Reduction Fund and community driven development (CDD) analysis.  CAS 
outcomes in this area have been highly successful, and work is underway to scale up this approach, with 
strong Government and development partner support, building on lessons learned from PRF 
implementation and work to promote food security in targeted villages.   

However, reducing vulnerabilities and improving access to service in remote rural areas, and among non -
Lao Thai speaking groups remain a challenge and the reduction in poverty rates varies by area.  Looking 
ahead, there will be a need to expand services into ever more remote areas.  Moreover, with urbanization, 
migration and a young population, the face of vulnerability is also changing and new strategies may be 
needed.   

Pillar 3: Adopt a strategic approach to capacity development and partnership 

The expected outcomes from CAS initiatives to adopt a strategic approach to capacity development and 
partnership in support of better NSEDP results were: strengthened capacity in the Committee for Planning 
and Investment (CPI), the Ministry of Finance, and the line ministries to plan, coordinate and monitor 
NSEDP implementation; strengthened key sector and provincial capacities in support of the CAS 
objectives; strengthened capacity of local partner institutions to support capacity development activities; 
and strengthened donor partnerships for better results. 

During CAS design, capacity was recognized by both the Bank and the Government as a major constraint 
to the implementation of the Government‘s strategy and the CAS program.  Devoting a separate pillar to 
capacity development was an effort to develop more systematic approaches to capacity development, and 
to identify and monitor concrete baselines, indicators and timeframes to link capacity to results.   

The CAS outcomes in this area were largely achieved.  Decentralization of Bank group leadership and 
staff in Vientiane enabled the development of close relationships with the Government and facilitated a 
strong policy dialogue.  There was also been good progress in institutional capacity development.  
Lessons from implementation of NSEDP VI have informed the upcoming NSEDP VII, and greater 
attention has been given to a monitoring and evaluation framework.   

46 

 
 
Cross-sectoral capacity has also improved, aided considerably by the PRSO series.  The PRSOs provided 
an effective platform for dialogue on policy issues with the process becoming increasingly country-led 
during the period.  The framework strengthened the position of reformers, in particular in the Ministry of 
Finance, but also in other agencies, and they adopted the PRSOs to communicate reform intentions, both 
internally and externally.  Government commitment to capacity development varies across agencies, with 
some ministries, notably Finance, Trade, Energy and Mines and Highways making progress in this 
regard, while the social sectors and rural development ministries have lagged.  This was underscored in 
the case of NT2 RMA, where a gap emerged between performance at the level of the Ministry of Finance 
and the sector ministries.   

CAS outcomes on stronger partnerships have also been achieved.  Outreach to civil society increased, 
largely around NT2 preparation and implementation.  The focus on community development in PRF and 
Khammoune facilitated greater involvement in communities.  Private sector engagement also improved 
through the successful launch of the Lao Business Forum.   

Within the Bank-managed Multi-Donor TF for PFM progress has been made towards the implementation 
of the Vientiane Declaration for increased aid effectiveness under which donors channel their resources 
through government systems in a more harmonized manner and aligned with the NSEDP priorities for 
poverty reduction.  PRSOs (co-financed by donors such as the European Community, Australia, and 
Japan) have provided a platform for dialogue between the Government and its development partners. 

In spite of the progress towards CAS outcomes, the implementation of this pillar has highlighted the 
difficulties of capturing, measuring and aggregating data about successful capacity building efforts. The 
lessons learned in this regard will inform the approach to capacity development in the next country 
strategy, where the focus is likely to be on embedding systematic approaches to building capacity within 
individual programs, projects and interventions. 

Pillar 4: Support implementation of NT2 

The expected outcomes from the fourth CAS pillar (support implementation of NT2 as an example of an 
area-based sustainable natural resource development program that contributes to growth, improved social 
outcomes, capacity development and stronger partnerships) include: sustained economic growth, 
including greater regional integration and more sustainable natural resource management; NT2 
mechanisms to ensure that revenues contribute to priority environmental and socia l programs and 
ultimately to strengthened service delivery and improved social outcomes; and, improved management 
capacity for coordination, consultations, participation and effective partnerships among stakeholders. 

Progress under this pillar has been strong, although many of these outcomes will occur over a longer 
timeframe than the last CAS period as targets become due and revenues are spent.   Income targets for 
most resettled households are on track to be achieved in 2013 when they are due, compensation has been 
paid, and livelihood restoration programs are under implementation.  The basic integrity of the Watershed 
protected area has been maintained although the area remains under pressure, and the Watershed 
Protection Management Authority is operational and developing the capacity to fully implement its 
mandate.  Water quality meets internationals standards and continues to be monitored.  A downstream 
program is in place, and impacts are being monitored.  

NT2 revenue management arrangements have exceeded CAS expectations with strong progress in 
strengthening public expenditure management systems.  NT2 revenues are in the budget and have already 
begun to support eligible programs in rural roads, public health, rural electrification and environmental 
protection.  The Ministry of Finance has established a dedicated NT2 revenue management arrangements 
coordination committee to ensure that the commitments under the Government Letter of Implementation 
Policy on revenue management are implemented. Outcomes with regard to stakeholder participation have 
been similarly successful, setting a high standard for consultation with affected people and stakeholders, 
and for disclosure of information.   

47 

 
 
Despite these successes, an unfinished agenda remains consistent with the project‘s continued obligations 
until 2017.  The full benefits from NT2 articulated under the fourth pillar will require many more years of 
hard work and concerted action to ensure the sustainability of social and environmental measures, and the 
effective use of revenues for poverty reduction and environmental protection.    

NT2 has been a transformational project.  It has also provided a platform for a number of projects for 
technical assistance and investments in environmental protection and social development and such 
projects have strong and strategic impact.  While many aspects of NT2 are being incorporated into 
national standards, applying the lessons learned from preparation and implementation of NT2 to future 
hydropower development in a more timely and cost effective manner will be a challenge for the next 
country strategy.  In this regard, IFC has developed a comprehensive strategy in the hydro sector and is 
exploring possibilities for collaboration with world class sponsors.   

IV. BANK GROUP PERFORMANCE 

A. Design  

Alignment:  There was a strong alignment between the long term strategic goals of the government and 
the strategic goals adopted by the CAS.  During the CAS period, Lao PDR‘s long term strategic 
development goals were clearly articulated by the Government and adopted with remarkable 
commitment.  These goals were presented first in the NGPES, and then in the subsequent NSEDP.  The 
clarity and realism of Lao PDR‘s development vision and the concomitant national commitment were 
complemented by strong and stable support from the WBG side.  The Bank‘s decision in 2007 to extend 
the term of the CAS to six years was, in retrospect, a sound one.  Six years of successful implementation, 
marked by capacity improvements and a constructive partnership with government, has raised the level of 
engagement to new heights.   

Consultations: CAS consultations were undertaken both in 2005 and in 2007 for the progress report.  
These consultations benefitted greatly from the consultation process developed for the Nam Theun 2 
project and included a broad range of stakeholders including Government, development partners, civil 
society and the private sector.  This, among other factors, resulted in the CAS having clear strategic 
objectives aligned with country priorities and linked to intermediate goals and to operations in support of 
these goals, backed by an effective system to monitor progress on reaching the milestones. 

Both the appropriateness of the strategic objectives of the CAS and the results from implementation of the 
operational pillars of the CAS reflect strong performance by the WBG through consultations during CAS 
preparation.  Government partners report that sensitivity and responsiveness to their concerns have been 
high.  There was widespread appreciation of the performance of WBG staff and managers among client 
officials at all levels.  A major contributing factor in the success of the dialogue was the strengthening of 
the country office staffing in an effective and cost-effective manner to support WBG operations in the 
country.  In addition, the Bank‘s Bangkok hub and IFC‘s Mekong regional office in Hanoi with its critical 
mass of experts and specialists successfully supported the country office staff including providing high 
level management oversight.   

Equally impressive was the organization of work around teams, with effective leadership, from regional, 
country, and international staff with appropriate blends of global experience, local experience and 
communication skills.  Participation of stakeholders during project preparation has been satisfactory and 
often innovative, especially in the context of NT2 preparation. 

B. Implementation   

48 

 
 
 
 
 
Lending:  At the time of the preparation of the 2005 CAS, the Bank envisaged the base -case IDA 
financing scenario for an indicative amount of US$128 million (including an one -time allocation for the 
NT2 program in FY05) over the four year period (FY05-FY08) with actual IDA allocations to be 
determined on an annual basis by the performance-based allocation (PBA) system.  The 2007 CAS 
Progress Report noted that the Lao PDR IDA program was deliberately front -loaded, mostly to 
accommodate the NT2 project and related activities, and proposed a notional IDA program with exact 
allocations to be determined by the PBA.  In the event, total IDA commitments during the period FY05 to 
FY11 amounted to US$331.3 million, of which US$326.8 was on grant terms, supplemented by US$5.6 
million under the GEF program and US$9.6 of special financing.  The NT2 guarantee was for US$42 
million in IDA.  The IDA commitments included seven PRSO operations for a total of US$83.5 million 
of grants and US$4.5 million of credits.   

Non-lending activities:  Feedback from Government counterparts suggests that AAA products have 
generally been highly valued.  The biannual Economic Monitors provide a solid platform for dialogue 
around economic policy issues and are well received by stakeholders including development partners and 
the media.  The monitoring reports will be increased to three times a year in the next CPS period to meet 
demand from stakeholders for more frequent updates.   The recent Lao Development Report (FY10) on 
natural resource management arose from growing concern about the policy implications of an increasing 
dependence on natural resources for growth.  At the Government‘s request, messages from the report 
were presented to the Prime Minister and the report was also subsequently disseminated to the highest 
levels of government and to the private sector.  The Nam Theun 2 project spawned cross cutting 
analytical work necessary for the project‘s successful implementation, most notable the Lao Expenditure 
and Consumption Surveys.   

Despite the success of the non-lending activities, a number of issues emerged over the CAS period that 
will need to be addressed in future strategies.  First, the growth in the size of the portfolio has put pressure 
on the budget resources available for AAA.  Second, some critical analytical work has been undertaken 
with trust fund resources, leading to concerns about its sustainability.  Finally, although the quality of 
analytical work has been strong, delivery of key products has been slow.  These issues will info rm the 
design of the next strategy.   

Portfolio: The portfolio was well managed, which required sustained efforts given government capacity 
constraints.  All closed projects are rated satisfactory or moderately satisfactory, and there is currently 
only one problem project in a portfolio of 21 projects.  The scrutiny devoted to all aspects of NT2 
preparation and implementation benefitted the whole portfolio.  The role of regional and local staff has 
been proactive and productive, though the client has noted that compliance with Bank fiduciary and 
safeguards requirements imposes a very significant capacity burden on an already capacity stretched 
public sector.  Average disbursement during the CAS period was 30 percent.  The Development 
Objectives of operations have generally been fully aligned with the broad strategic objectives of the CAS.   

There are significant implications of having a large portfolio.  With 21 projects, in particular the smaller 
ones, as well as a similar number of trust fund (TF) operations, significant staff time and administrative 
budget are devoted to supervision.  There is some concern that the large number of projects could diffuse 
the Bank‘s impact in any one sector, limit funds available and further stretch government capacity.  At the 
same time, the client has been appreciative of the additional resources the Bank has managed to mobilize 
for high priority and emerging areas of concern work such as food security.  Nevertheless, in the future, 
the proliferation of trust funds and special financing will need to be considered carefully in light of the 
increased workload they entail.   

In the same light, the size of individual projects could also be rethought to maximize impact and minimize 
demands on government capacity.  The PRSO model is one vehicle that serves this purpose, and a future 
series to cover complementary policy areas is under development.  New lending instruments being 
developed by the Bank also offer scope for such enlargement in the size of projects.   

49 

 
 
Fiduciary management: The fiduciary aspects of the portfolio have been particularly well managed.  
WBG operations have been supported not only by its own staff, but also by government counterparts who 
appreciated the importance of meeting Bank Group standards, while noting that fiduciary requirements 
are a major cost of doing business with the WBG given low government capacity in this area. 

V. KEY LESSONS AND SUGGESTIONS FOR THE NEXT CAS 

The 2005 CAS included some bold and potentially risky activities, most obviously the NT2 project, but 
also commitments to budget support operations, community driven development, and policy reforms in a 
low capacity environment. Given this ambition, the performance of both the Government and the WBG 
on the formulation and implementation of the CAS during the past six years is impressive.  However, 
success in its turn demands raising the level of engagement in the next CAS.  The results assessments 
above have identified a number of lessons going forward. 

 Take calculated risks for transformational project and devote resources to risk mitigation.  
The successful achievement of high social and environmental standards in the NT2 project 
demonstrates what is possible in the Lao context.  However, the Lao context (e.g. investment 
climate, institutional capacity etc.) is evolving and the future hydropower projects may be able to 
achieve high level of sustainability without exactly replicating NT2 experience. Nevertheless, NT2 
will continue to serve as a key benchmark for future projects and the learning platform for 
strengthening Government‘s capacity to manage the sector as a whole.  The World Bank Group is 
well positioned to continue supporting the government and the private sector in building institutional 
and physical capacity for sustainable hydropower development in Lao PDR. 

 Capacity building remains critical but needs to be approached differently.  Identifying capacity 
as a separate CAS pillar was successful at raising the profile and elevating the discussion of the issue 
as a binding constraint.  Implementation of this pillar, however, highlights the need to embed capacity 
interventions within broader sectoral programs rather than separate approaches or activities, and to 
better capture results.  For example, considerable capacity building that took place through the design 
and implementation of the PRSO series is not adequately captured.   In addition, the pillar focuses on 
relatively short-term measures such as individual skill training and away from more systematic 
solutions such as review of roles and responsibilities.  Success in capacity building has been 
concentrated around sectors-- public financial management, rural electrification and roads --where 
there was programmatic, sustained and sizable engagement involving multiple instrument and 
coordinated with donors.   Going forward, capacity building should play a more active role in 
selectivity in the next country strategy, with new activities selected with an eye on strengthening the 
impact on capacity building. 

 Handle the selection of Bank instruments more thoughtfully.  Selectivity is a challenge in a 
country with large needs and a supportive, reform oriented government but the lessons drawn from 
the capacity building successes and the transformative nature of the NT2 project suggest that small 
project with narrow goals, especially when not embedded in a broader program and client 
relationship, may not be the best use of the limited IDA and budget resources.  While the proliferation 
of small projects has provided a platform for deeper engagement in some sectors, given the associated 
costs of preparation and supervision and the demands on government capacity, a smaller number of 
larger projects – or programs including several related and mutually reinforcing activities – that are 
closely aligned with government priorities may have a greater impact in both immediate results and in 
developing institutional capacity.    

 Maximize the use of WBG knowledge products as the basis for a high impact engagement.  The 
results assessment indicates that the Bank group engagements have the greatest impact when the 
activities – be it policy advice, investment lending, budget support, or transformational projects – are 
premised on solid, high quality, and preferably participatory, research, analysis, and diagnostics.  

50 

 
 
Knowledge products are highly valued by the client, and when undertaken in close collaboration with 
local counterparts, builds capacity.  High quality AAA can also facilitate the engagement of other 
donors with financing and projects and reduce the Bank‘s own footprint.  While supplementing AA 
budget through trust funds has made more space for pivotal analytical work, it will be important to 
consider the sustainability of this model. 

 Leave room for flexibility to respond to emerging challenges .  The Bank group‘s nimble response 
to changes in the global and country context allowed it to deliver more than was programmed in the 
original CAS while adhering to the overall strategic direction.  This was not without risks, as 
managing a larger portfolio presents challenges in a small country program.  Nevertheless, the Bank 
group‘s ability to leverage additional resources and analysis was greatly appreciated by the 
Government and helped to solidify the already strong relationship.

Project level capacity development 
efforts were successful in many 
specific areas, but the challenge 
has been to build capacity at the 
sector level. There was some 
meaningful progress in sectors 
where the Bank and partners play a 
leading role (such as Transport and 
Finance) but less so in sectors that 
have many and variable sources of 
assistance. Stand-alone capacity

ANNEX 9:  SUMMARY OF DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS 

According to the most recent debt sustainability analysis (DSA), Lao PDR continues to face a high 
risk of debt distress.4  External public and publicly-guaranteed (PPG) debt stocks remain elevated, but 
the high level of concessionality of official borrowing, which comprises most of Lao's debt, keeps debt 
service ratios relatively contained.  Public external debt stock indicators are expected to remain at or 
above policy-dependant indicative thresholds throughout half of the projection period under the baseline 
scenario, and could increase further in the event of weaker macroeconomic performance or greater 
accumulation of non-concessional debt.  Debt servicing ratios, however, remain below the relevant 
thresholds even under alternative assumptions. 

The debt profile has improved in recent years, in part because the government has generally 
followed a prudent strategy of avoiding the accumulation of non-concessional debt.  Strong 
economic growth, currency appreciation, and prudent debt management contributed to a decline in the 
debt ratio over the past few years—the stock of external PPG debt in nominal terms was US$3.1 billion at 
end-2009, or 55 percent of GDP, down from 82 percent at end-2005.  The nominal debt stock increased 
by US$230 million in 2009.  All the new debt is contracted at concessional terms.  The corresponding net 
present value (NPV) of debt at end-2009was 43 percent of GDP or 129 percent of exports of goods and 
non-factor services.  In terms of composition, nearly 66 percent of PPG debt is held by multilateral 
creditors, mainly the Asian Development Bank and IDA.  About 31 percent is held by bilateral creditors, 
including a large Soviet-era debt to Russia that is currently under negotiation.  Only 3 percent comprises 
external debt incurred by public entities on non-concessional terms, mainly for hydropower development 
and electricity generation.  The increasing presence of emerging market creditors underscores the need to 
strengthen debt management capacity to ensure that debt sustainability considerations are taken into 
account when new debt is contracted.   

Domestic public debt, while still relatively small, rose in 2009 as the central bank extended sizable 
direct credit to local governments.  At end-2009, the stock of recorded domestic public debt amounted 
to 6.1 percent of GDP, up from 3.0 percent of GDP at end-2008, driven mainly by the Bank of 
Lao P.D.R.‘s (BoL) direct lending to finance local government‘s off-budget infrastructure projects, which 
added kip 1,628 billion (US$192 million or 3.4 percent of GDP) to domestic debt in 2009.  Total PPG 
domestic and external debt stood at 61.5 percent of GDP in 2009.  The stock of BoL lending to local 
governments is expected to peak in 2010, with total commitment of over kip 3 trillion likely fully 
disbursed by September and repayments from the central government budget kicking in. 

Under the baseline scenario, the three public external debt stock indicators remain above the 
policy-dependent indicative debt burden thresholds in the first part of the projection period.  Unlike 
in last year‘s DSA, mainly reflecting the recovery of copper prices, the PV of debt-to-exports ratio 
exceeds the threshold level only in 2010 under the baseline scenario.  All three external debt stock 
indicators are projected to be on a declining trend from 2010 onward, reflecting prudent borrowing and 
strong economic growth.  Debt service ratios (both as a share of exports and government revenues) 
remain well below indicative thresholds throughout the 20-year projection period, despite falling 
concessionality. 

External debt sustainability is most vulnerable to a depreciation of the nominal exchange rate and 
lower export growth.5 In the same way that the sustained strong appreciation of the kip over the past

The most recent DSA has been completed jointly by the World Bank and the IMF, in collaboration with the Asian 
Development Bank in June 2010. 

The most extreme stress test is defined as the bound test resulting in the most extreme deterioration of the debt 
burden indicator after 10 years.

couple of years served to bring the debt ratio down considerably, a 30 percent depreciation kip would lead 
to a sharp jump in the NPV of debt-to-GDP and debt-to-revenue ratios which would remain above the 
respective debt stock thresholds through most or all of the projection period.  Under this shock, debt 
levels (both related to GDP and revenue) would only decline below the thresholds over the very long 
term.  Lower export growth (by one standard deviation in 2010-11) would push the NPV of debt-to-
exports up to double its baseline level over the first half of the projection period and in excess of 
indicative thresholds throughout.   

External borrowing should be obtained on concessional terms and fiscal and quasi-fiscal liabilities 
should be carefully managed, to guard against external vulnerabilities and to ensure debt ratios 
remain on a declining path.  Continued prudent debt management as well as cautious assessment and 
monitoring of large-scale projects will be required to mitigate the risks posed to external and public debt 
sustainability.  Fiscal risk could arise if these projects fail to generate the expected returns, including to 
the government‘s own equity stakes.  The BoL‘s exit from direct lending to local governments is a 
welcome development.  Improving debt management capacity and developing a medium-term borrowing 
strategy for the government, including for resource sector activity, as well as greater disclosure of 
borrowing plans, would substantially enhance the assessment of debt sustainability.  In view of the high 
risk of debt distress, recourse to nonconcessional external financing should be strictly limited to viable 
projects. 

Lao PDR external debt indicators 

Source:  Joint Bank-Fund Debt Sustainability Assessment, 2010. 

Lao PDR chose not to avail itself of debt relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) 
Initiative or the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI).  Because Lao PDR is classified as having 
a high risk of debt distress, under the debt sustainability framework Lao PDR receives all IDA assistance 
on grant terms (PRSO 2-6, and the proposed PRSO7 are IDA grants).  Lao PDR is also eligible for up to 
50 percent of grants within its performance based allocation from the ADB. 

In summary, the medium term economic outlook for Lao PDR continues to be optimistic despite 
inflationary risks associated with the recent fuel price shock.  The sustainability of fiscal and 
monetary policies has been strengthened, with a significant reduction in budget deficit (partly due to 
prudent wage and capital spending budgeting), slowdown in credit growth (mainly due to the phasing out 
of BOL‘s direct lending to local projects) and rebound in reserves.  Looking forward, inflation, especially 
coming from food and fuel, will need to be monitored closely to anticipate and mitigate impacts of the 
economy.

ANNEX 11:  EXAMPLES OF RESULTS DELIVERED THROUGH TRUST FUNDS IN LAO 
PDR 

The Trade Development Facility Project (TDFP) in Lao PDR was approved by the Government in 
September 2009 to develop and support the first National Trade Facilitation Strategy and Action Plan.  It 
also constitutes an achieved policy action under PRSO7.   TDFP has supported the establishment of a 
permanent National Trade Facilitation Secretariat as part of efforts to improve inter-agency border 
coordination, establish linkages with the private sector, and contribute towards faster and simpler trade 
facilitation processes and procedures.  Other project outputs to date include: 
 Establishment and launch of a Garment Services Centre now delivering fee-based productivity 
training to operators and line managers in the Lao garments sector as a key contribution to 
improve competitiveness and employment generation, particularly for women.   

 Essential support to WTO accession negotiations, now reaching the final and most critical stage, 
including the financing of a team of analysts including the first full-time trade lawyer employed 
in the Ministry of Industry and Commerce (MOIC), and facilitating dissemination to the public 
and private sectors of progress and commitments made in the negotiation process .   

 Launch and publication of the first two editions of the Lao Trade Research Digest, a key activity 
aimed at stimulating domestically generated trade research and policy analysis, and building civil 
service capacity on research to support policy development.  The journal has an international 
editorial board. 

 Confidence in the implementation capacity of MOIC has grown substantially within the Lao 
Government and among development partners.  Additional contributions have been made to the 
MDTF by new donors, who have aligned themselves with the TDF program, and existing donors 
have made strong commitments to a second phase. 

The Multi Donor Trust Fund financing of the Public Finance Management Strengthening Program in 
Lao PDR, co-financed by EC, AusAID, SIDA, and SDC is one of the Bank‘s main vehicles to support 
the Government of Lao PDR in strengthening its public financial management.   The objective of the 
Program is to improve policy consistency, efficiency, transparency and accountability in public 
expenditure and revenue management by strengthening institutional systems and capacity and making 
progress towards appropriate international financial management standard.  A number of important 
results have been achieved, including the following:  
 Completion of centralization of key PFM functions- Treasury, Tax and Customs Administration 

 Budget coverage was expended through transferring technical revenue accounts into Treasury and 
pilot of TSA implementation launched at the Bank of Lao PDR (BOL) 

 

introduction of VAT from January 2010 

 For the first time in 2010, the summary findings of annual audit reports were published and 
quarterly budget execution report with sector breakdown was produced 

 Budget has become more credible and funds are available to the service delivery units six months 
in advance.
