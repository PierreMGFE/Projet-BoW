TAJIKISTAN 

I. 

INTRODUCTION 

1. 
This Country Partnership Strategy Progress Report 
(CPSPR) assesses 
implementation to date of the World Bank Group’s (WBG) Country Partnership Strategy 
(CPS) for Tajikistan for the period FY10-13.  Prepared in the wake of the 2008-09 global 
economic crisis, the CPS’ objectives were twofold: (a) to reduce the negative impact on poverty 
and vulnerability; and (b) to pave the way for post-crisis recovery and sustained development.  
Governance was a cross-cutting theme in the context of Tajikistan’s Country Governance and 
Anti-Corruption (CGAC) strategy. Progress towards CPS outcomes since mid-2010 has been 
broadly satisfactory, particularly the authorities’ two-pronged crisis management response to the 
global economic downturn.  Most intermediate indicators have been met and nearly all the results 
expected by end-FY13 are on track.   

2. 
The CPSPR proposes that the shift in emphasis already underway—from crisis 
mitigation to the structural reforms needed for inclusive growth—be accelerated, while 
remaining alert to Tajikistan’s chronic vulnerability to external shocks.  Governance will be 
mainstreamed into all operations and gender will be given greater priority. Originally programmed 
for FY10-13, the CPSPR proposes that the CPS be extended by one year, i.e. to end-FY14, which 
will align drafting of the next CPS with the government’s timetable for preparation of its second 
long-term National Development Strategy (NDS), 2016-25. 

II. 

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND FUTURE PROSPECTS 

A. 

Recent Economic and Political Developments 

3. 
Tajikistan withstood the 2008-09 global downturn better than expected, thanks partly 
to prudent economic management and partly to timely budget support from development 
partners.   The main effects of the crisis were twofold: a 30 percent decline in remittances from 
Tajik migrants in Russia—from an estimated $2.3 billion in 2008 to $1.6 billion in 2009; and 
lower international prices as well as reduced exports of aluminium and cotton.  As a result, 
economic growth fell from 7.9 percent in 2008 to 3.9 percent in 2009.  The authorities reacted with 
a two-pronged anti-crisis strategy of increased public spending, including on social programs 
designed to create jobs, and greater exchange rate flexibility to facilitate current account 
adjustment.  At the same time, budget support from several development partners—including the 
IDA-financed Programmatic Development Policy Grants (PDPG) 4 and 5—helped maintain public 
expenditures on education, health, and social protection and supported government efforts to 
mitigate the impact of the crisis on poverty and vulnerability. 

4. 
Growth recovered quickly in the post-crisis period, with real GDP expanding by 6.5 
percent in 2010 and a further 7.4 percent in 2011.  This was due partly to increased exports and 
a full recovery and growth in remittance flows compared to the pre-crisis period—estimated at 
$2.9 billion or 45 percent of GDP in 2011—and partly to services, which accounted for more than 

5 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
half of total growth in 2011.  Agriculture also contributed, with the value of output rising by 7.9 
percent in 2011, owing mainly to the largest cotton harvest in 20 years (up 34 percent over 2010).  
Meanwhile, industry expanded by 5.9  percent, driven largely by chemicals, food, and textile 
processing.  Going forward, most of the average 6 percent annual growth projected over the 
medium term is expected to come initially from construction, trade, and other services, with 
exports of non-cotton agriculture, energy, and mining likely to make an increasing contribution 
over time.  

5. 
Prudent macroeconomic management has been maintained, leading to better inflation 
control and fiscal recovery.  In 2011, government revenues increased by 31 percent over 2010 in 
nominal terms and fiscal policy was tightened during the second half in anticipation of a possible 
regional or global slowdown in 2012.  As a result, the fiscal balance (excluding the externally-
financed public investment program) recorded a surplus equivalent to 0.5 percent of GDP rather 
than the 0.6 percent deficit projected earlier.  After having risen steadily during the first half of the 
year, headline inflation declined to 9.3 percent by end-2011 (year-on-year), reflecting lower 
international food and commodity prices.  During January to July 2012, the consumer price index 
(CPI) rose by 2.9  percent, a modest increase compared to recent trends, which has allowed the 
National Bank of Tajikistan (NBT) to gradually lower the refinance rate from around 10 percent in 
end-2011 to 6.5 percent in August. Since Tajikistan is highly dependent on food grain imports, in 
light of the recent spike in international food prices the government recently signed contracts with 
suppliers in Kazakhstan and Pakistan to replenish its reserves. The Somoni has been stable in 
relation to the dollar, and international reserves accumulation by NBT has been in line with IMF 
program targets. 

6. 
 The ratio of Tajikistan’s public and publicly guaranteed debt to GDP is projected to 
decline from 34.4 percent in 2010 to 32.5 percent in 2011, according to the 2011 joint 
International Monetary Fund (IMF)-World Bank debt sustainability analysis (DSA).  Its external 
debt is largely concessional, shared roughly equally between bilateral and multilateral creditors, 
with China accounting for about 38 percent of the total.  Based partly on a detailed assessment 
undertaken in 2011, the Ministry of Finance’s public debt management strategy for 2012-14 
reaffirms the government’s commitment to: (a) keep public and publicly guaranteed debt below 40 
percent of GDP; (b) only contract new loans with at least a 35 percent grant element; and (c) 
undertake cost-benefit analyses of large investments. 

7. 
Although the poverty headcount dropped from 72 percent in 2003 to 47 percent in 
2009, Tajikistan remains the poorest country in Europe and Central Asia.  Economic growth 
is highly dependent on the external environment: remittances, for example, depend heavily on 
developments in Russia, where 90 percent of all Tajik labor migrants work.  Thus, the risk that 
these flows could decline again is ever present, with the women and children who rely upon 
remittance income being especially vulnerable.  Moreover, there are signs, including from a recent 
World Bank analysis, that 2007-09 growth benefitted better-off urban households more than the 
rural poor, although it is unclear whether this reflects a change in poverty-growth dynamics or 
simply the sharp, temporary decline in remittances in 2009.  Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous 
Oblast (GBAO) and Khatlon are the poorest oblasts: 62 percent and 54 percent of their respective 
populations were living below the poverty line in 2009, compared to 48 percent in Sogd, 39 
percent in RRP, and 34 percent in Dushanbe.  Recognizing that the country’s two main social 
programs have little or no impact on poverty—their budgets are too small and their resources are 

6 

 
 
 
poorly targeted—the government is now taking steps to reform them with World Bank and 
European Union financial and technical support. 

8. 
The country’s political environment, characterized by a strong presidency, remains 
essentially unchanged.  The next presidential election is due in November, 2013 and the next 
parliamentary elections in February, 2014, but neither are expected to alter the political landscape 
significantly.  Meanwhile, deteriorating internal security during the past year, public discontent 
over poor service delivery (especially long winter power shortages), and civil society’s lack of 
voice could potentially trigger social instability.  At the same time, regional cooperation remains 
complicated, resulting in serious physical and policy obstacles to external trade.  Moreover, the 
political and security outlook in Afghanistan beyond 2014 has created new uncertainties, given 
Tajikistan’s long and porous border with its neighbour. 

B. 

Future Prospects 

9. 
To maintain recent high levels of growth, Tajikistan needs to tackle several important 
structural reforms, the effective implementation of which will require more resolute and 
visible political will given the difficulties of the reforms.  These include changes in difficult areas 
such as improving energy efficiency, including energy sector governance, the ongoing 
restructuring of agriculture and related irrigation and water management, the development of the 
financial and private sectors, and implementation of the new tax code.  Continued strong 
development partner coordination and the support of champions in both government and civil 
society will also be crucial.  Meanwhile, the country’s economy remains vulnerable to several 
external factors.  Exports of cotton and aluminum, for example, are unlikely to remain as important 
in the future as in the past.  Similarly, remittances will probably increase more slowly over time 
from their currently high base.  On the other hand, if a greater share of remittances went into 
productive private investment, they could be an important contributor to future growth.  Exports of 
summer surplus electricity could also become significant in the medium and longer term. 

10. 
Tajikistan's biggest economic challenge is to lift its very low rates of private 
investment.  Total investment, dominated by public investment, has averaged around 20 percent 
of GDP during the past decade, of which private investment accounted for one quarter or only 
about 5 percent of GDP.  While the government has undertaken a wide range of legal, procedural, 
and regulatory steps in recent years designed to improve the business environment—reflected inter 
alia in Tajikistan’s ranking among the top 10 most improved countries in the WBG’s Doing 
Business two years in a row (2010 and 2011)—the development of the country’s private sector and 
of an appropriate legal framework for its growth remain a work in progress.  For example, beyond 
the Doing Business indicators (many of which show a differential outcome for male and female 
entrepreneurs), enterprises face numerous practical and structural constraints, such as tax policy 
and administration, energy supply, access to credit, shortages of skilled labor, and corruption in 
dealing with public officials. 

11. 
Achieving higher rates of private as well as foreign direct investment (FDI) will 
require a strengthened banking system and, more broadly, greater recognition of the role 
that financial intermediation can and should play in supporting growth.  In this context, 
although non-performing loans declined from 28 percent of gross loans in early 2010 to 15 percent 
by end-2011, partly due to the government’s cotton debt resolution framework, they remain quite 
high and will continue to require close monitoring and, if needed, remedial action.  Meanwhile, the 

7 

 
 
 
 
 
resolution of a major commercial bank, now under discussion, needs to follow international 
principles to improve governance and strengthen the banking system and credit culture.  Equally 
important, directed lending, which distorts local markets, crowds out private investment, 
undermines banks’ governance, and poses quasi-fiscal risks—needs to be ended without further 
delay. At the same time, continued prudent macroeconomic management and rebuilding fiscal 
buffers and international reserves will also be important in dealing with increased risks in the 
global economy. 

12. 
An overarching requirement will be to address the country’s gender disparities 
which, despite relatively high overall levels of human capital endowment, remain significant.    
Available data indicate that gender disparities in education are small at the primary and secondary 
levels, but substantial at the tertiary level.  Moreover, though women constitute 45 percent of the 
labour force, which is comparable to the average for all low income countries, their average 
monthly earnings are barely half those of men, and the number of female managers and owners of 
enterprises is very low.  (Annex 2 analyses Tajikistan’s gender disparities in more detail.) 

III. 

PROGRESS TOWARDS CPS OUTCOMES 

13. Overall progress towards CPS outcomes since mid-2010 has been broadly 
satisfactory, particularly the authorities’ two-pronged crisis management response to the 
global downturn.  With support from development partners, they maintained public spending on 
education, health, and social protection at 42 percent of the budget, ensured access to key public 
services for the poor, and strengthened social protection for vulnerable groups.  Besides these 
short-term crisis mitigation measures, the authorities also made significant, albeit variable progress 
towards: (a) improving the business environment, thereby facilitating private sector development; 
(b) increasing agricultural productivity through land reform, ‘freedom to farm’, and better water 
management; (c) upgrading energy efficiency and reliability; (d) enriching the quality of education 
and health; and (e) strengthening public administration and public finance management, including 
the piloting of several CGAC-related initiatives (cf. paras. 17-18).  Box 1 below summarizes 
progress towards CPS outcomes as measured by selected intermediate indicators. 

Box 1: Progress towards CPS Outcomes—selected intermediate indicators 1 

Macroeconomic stability and balanced fiscal policy—Achieved   
Tajikistan maintained positive growth during the global downturn and doubled GDP growth from 3.9% in 2009 to 
7.4% in 2011.  Public spending on education, health, and social protection was maintained at the targeted (2008) 
baseline of 42% of total budget, equivalent to 7.3% of GDP. 
Access to critical public services—Ongoing 
IDA/TF-financed basic education and primary health care (PHC) facilities were constructed or rehabilitated as 
planned.  Gross enrollment for basic education was 97% in 2011, including 95% for girls.  The average number of 
PHC visits per capita for Khatlon and Sogd oblasts increased from 2.5 and 3.78 in 2009 to 3.06 and 4.3 
respectively in 2011.  However, countrywide roll-out of health per capita financing and oblast-level pooling 
reforms was postponed to 2014, pending a review by the Ministry of Finance of their fiscal impact.  
Enhanced social protection for vulnerable groups—Ongoing 
 More than 10,500 people have been involved in public works in the most food insecure districts, earning an

to the CPS’ original strategic country-level outcomes.

average income of about $250 equivalent per person. A pilot project targeting social assistance provision to 
vulnerable groups has been launched successfully in two districts, with plans for countrywide implementation in 
coming years.  
Business-enabling environment—Achieved 
Corporate income tax rate was cut from 25% to 15%; the cost and number of procedures required to start a 
business and obtain a construction permit were reduced substantially; and revisions to laws and/or regulations 
relating to the central bank, banking, deposit insurance, and bank liquidation were adopted in line with the 
financial sector action plan (FSAP), though implementation is slow.  In 2011 Doing Business, Tajikistan was one 
of the 10 most improved countries for the 2nd straight year, although its overall ranking (139 of 183) remains low. 
Agricultural productivity—Achieved 
Over 50,000 land-use certificates were issued in restructured farms, covering 158,000 individual land shares. Key 
agricultural reforms are now underway, such as ‘freedom to farm’; agricultural taxation; role of local government; 
access to credit; and institutional arrangements for off- and on-farm water management.  According to a 2011 
rural vulnerability and resilience survey, 45% of households reported less government interference in dekhan 
farms’ cropping decisions.  Improved access to irrigation was provided on over 44,000 hectares, with 74% of 
farmers reporting increased crop yields.  
Energy efficiency and reliability—Ongoing 
Data for power outages and number of days below the (reservoir) dead zone—two end-FY11 indicators—are not 
yet available, and planned electricity tariff increases to cost recovery level were postponed. Barqi Tajik (BT) 
installed 165,000 meters in Dushanbe, increased billing by 50%, and rehabilitated several distribution networks.  
The TALCO energy efficiency audit has been completed. BT and Tajiktransgas are executing financial 
management improvement plans (including migration to IFRS). 
Quality of education and health—Achieved  
Education—per capita financing was rolled out nationwide; the EMIS-2 design was reviewed and 
recommendations adopted; the National Testing Center (NTC) piloted common university entrance examination 
and standardized classroom assessments; and a life skills training curriculum for migrant workers was developed.  
Health—per capita financing for primary health care is in place in 42 rayons in 2 oblasts and 302 doctors and 923 
nurses were trained in family medicine.  
Public administration/civil service performance—Ongoing 
A new performance-based salary grid, including a 35% increase in entry-level salaries, was extended to all civil 
servants effective September 1, 2011.  A new law on public administration organization was approved in 
December 2011 and Resolution 34 of January 21, 2012 authorized the re-organization of 10 ministries.   
Accountability and transparency of public finances—Ongoing  
Since 2010, quarterly budget execution reports have been posted on the Ministry of Finance’s website.  The 
unified budget classification and Chart of Accounts compatible with 2001 GFS was implemented for the 2012 
budget.  A law on external audit was approved in June 2011 and a presidential decree establishing an external 
audit body was issued at end-2011. The two top auditors received parliamentary approval in 2012. A new Tax 
Code with input from the private sector was approved in September 2012. 

14. 
The Bank Group’s response to the crisis, specifically to the country’s needs for 
emergency budget and energy support, was prompt and practical.  It consisted of two single 
tranche PDPGs totalling $35.4 million—$25.4 million in FY10 and $10 million in FY11—as well 
as additional financing of $15 million for energy emergency recovery assistance in FY10.  In 
addition, two Trust Fund commitments totalling $16.3 million addressed the crisis’ impact on 
poverty and vulnerability directly—a $6.3 million Russia Food Price Crisis Rapid Response Trust 
Fund grant for emergency food security and seed imports, and a $10 million EU Food Crisis Rapid 
Response Facility grant for public employment for sustainable agriculture and water management 
in selected districts of Khatlon oblast.  Results on the ground included: (a) the urgent rehabilitation 
of the power grid in Dushanbe and of local district heating systems to ensure supply to hospitals, 
schools, and households during the winter; and (b) employment of more than 10,500 people in five 
of the poorest, most food insecure districts on community-based drainage and irrigation 
infrastructure public works programs.  Meanwhile, a $2.8 million Japan Social Development Fund 
grant, approved towards end-FY09, financed nutrition investments in severely food insecure 

9 

 
 
districts of Khatlon, including micro-nutrient supplements to under five year old children and 
pregnant and lactating women.  Finally, a $13.5 million grant under the Education for All Fast 
Track Initiative Catalytic Fund (FTI-3), approved in FY10, increased access to improved primary 
school infrastructure and more efficient delivery of quality education services.  

15. 
Besides crisis mitigation, the two PDPGs also supported initial progress towards the 
second of the CPS’ two principal objectives—post-crisis recovery and sustainable growth.  
While the larger PDPG-4 in FY10 focused mainly on protecting social spending and the gains 
from earlier reforms, the PDPG-5 in FY11 (and the proposed PDPG-6 in FY13) put progressively 
more emphasis on efforts to promote sustainable growth.  These include reforms in three policy 
areas: first, maintaining delivery of basic social services; second, improving the environment for 
private sector development; and third, increasing the government’s effectiveness, including: (a) 
strengthening the capacity of agencies, committees, ministries, and other public institutions (e.g. 
per capita financing for primary health care); (b) improving public financial management (e.g. 
introducing a single treasury account); and (c) enhancing the transparency of large state-owned 
enterprises (e.g. publishing their audited accounts).  These PDPG-supported reforms complement 
those being carried out under ongoing IDA-financed investment projects in agriculture, education, 
health, and social protection, as well as technical assistance in public administration and public 
financial management.   

16. Meanwhile, progress was made in laying the foundation for stronger growth and key 
structural reforms.  Improving the business environment and enhancing the investment climate 
are two related areas where, with Bank and International Finance Corporation (IFC) technical 
assistance, Tajikistan’s legislation and regulatory environment have progressed significantly 
during the last 2-3 years.  For example, the rate of corporate income tax was reduced from 25 
percent to 15 percent; the number of procedures and days required to start a business fell from 13 
to 5 and from 62 to 24 respectively; and the number of procedures required to obtain a construction 
permit was cut from 32 to 26.  In addition, a one-stop shop for company registration has been 
established and a public-private partnership law and amendments to the customs code have been 
drafted. 

17. 
Tajikistan’s ratings for governance—especially for accountability, transparency, and 
corruption in public services—are among the worst in Europe and Central Asia.  Governance 
is thus an integral, cross-cutting theme of the CPS, backed by a four year (FY10-13) $3.8 million 
Governance Partnership Facility (GPF) grant.  The CPS’ governance strategy focuses on the 
country’s three most important governance challenges: (a) increasing public accountability and 
transparency in key sectors, such as agriculture, banking, and energy; (b) developing institutional 
capacity; and (c) fostering overall demand for good governance.  It also introduces a new project-
specific tool—the governance checklist—designed to ensure that each investment project 
addresses these three challenges throughout the project cycle while at the same time taking 
fiduciary and political economy risks into account.  

18. 
The Country Team is fully engaged in implementation of the CGAC strategy.  
Progress since FY10 includes the following: first, in the area of public accountability and 
transparency, an energy efficiency audit of TALCO, Tajikistan’s largest state-owned enterprise, 
has been completed, governance assessments of agriculture and mining have been finished, and a 
policy note for the banking sector is planned; second, a civil service administration pilot capacity 
building program has been initiated; and third, support for the promotion of demand for good 

10 

 
governance is being provided to the parliament―to help strengthen its finance and economics 
committee’s oversight of the budget and the committee’s overall analytical capacity―and to civil 
society organisations to engage them in the monitoring of IDA-financed projects.  Meanwhile, the 
governance checklist and associated institutional, governance, and political economy analyses 
helped shape the design of the (FY11) 2nd Dushanbe Water Supply and (FY12) Private Sector 
Competitiveness (mining component) projects.   

IV. 

IMPLEMENTATION PROGRESS AND ADJUSTMENTS TO CPS 

A. 

CPS Program and Portfolio Performance 

19. Outcomes to date have been broadly in line with expectations in mid-2010.  IDA 
commitments of $140.5 million in FY10-12 exceeded original CPS plans by $21.1 million, or 
about 17 percent.  Budget support (PDPGs 4 and 5) totalling $35.4 million accounted for 25 
percent of the total and additional financing totalling $43 million—to scale up five ongoing 
operations in education, energy, health, land registration, and water management—accounted for 
31 percent.  The balance of $62.1 million, or 44 percent, was for six new operations: winter energy 
emergency support, a second Dushanbe water supply project, social protection technical 
assistance, regional hydro-meteorological capacity building, municipal infrastructure, and private 
sector competitiveness.   

20. 
Portfolio performance improved during the period, although several systemic issues 
remain.  Disbursements increased, thanks mainly to the increasing number of mature projects and 
in some cases better implementation.  Commitments at risk declined from 29 percent in FY09 to 
13.5 percent in FY13, although the number of problem projects remained at 3.  The most recent 
country portfolio performance review (CPPR), conducted jointly with the government and the 
Asian Development Bank (ADB) in July 2012, piloted a focus on results, using health and 
transport as examples.  Previous joint reviews focused mainly on nuts and bolts of implementation 
of Bank-financed projects. The line ministries concerned demonstrated that a focus on results 
enabled them to view partnership from both a practical and political perspective and the approach 
is becoming more familiar to the State Committee on Investments and State Property Management 
(SCISPM). The government continued moving towards more integrated project implementation 
arrangements—a key area of concern from the previous (2011) CPPR—specifically the 
incorporation of project implementation units (PIUs) into line ministries, thereby facilitating 
institutional impact and project sustainability. During the recent Country Procurement Status 
Review, the Bank discovered that procurement arrangements in Bank financed projects had been 
modified by the SCISPM, resulting in implementation delays and lack of accountability.  The 
Bank is working with the SCISPM to find a solution. 

21. 
Trust Funds were an important supplement to IDA resources in FY10-12, accounting 
for about 30 percent of total combined commitments.  Tajikistan’s Trust Fund portfolio—one 
of the largest in ECA—has 48 active operations with net commitments of $64.5 million.   During 
FY 09-11, more than $57 million were mobilized―mainly for agriculture (51 percent), but also for 
education (22 percent), public law & administration (12 percent) and health (9 percent)―and $19 
million disbursed.  Efforts to limit new trust fund requests only to supplement existing projects or 
activities—which accounted for more than half the 21 grants approved in FY11—will continue 
during the remaining CPS period.  Tajikistan is also one of nine countries chosen by the Climate 

11 

 
 
 
 
Investment Fund (CIF) for implementation of Pilot Programs for Climate Resistance (PPCR).  
Activities under the first phase have been completed and recommendations for the second phase 
have been submitted to the implementing partners.  The recently approved regional hydro-
meteorological project is the first phase 2 PPCR project underway. 

22. 
IFC continued to promote private sector development through a combination of 
investments and advisory activities.  It invested $19.4 million in seven projects during FY10-12, 
including $2 million through its Global Trade Finance Program in Eskhata Bank and $5 million 
through a global agribusiness project in a commodity trading company, ECOM.  Besides a first 
investment in agribusiness, the other operations were loans to, and equity investments in existing 
clients, First Microfinance Bank and Tajik Access Bank, which were accompanied by advisory 
services to strengthen their microfinance activities and assist their transformation into deposit-
taking commercial banks.  Tajikistan also benefitted from a regional financial sector infrastructure 
project, which helped establish the country’s first credit bureau.  Meanwhile, a new Agricultural 
Finance and Regulatory Reform Advisory Project was launched, focused on agricultural 
equipment leasing and finance and key regulatory issues.  The long-standing business enabling 
environment advisory project concluded its next phase, contributing to Tajikistan’s improved 
ranking in Doing Business (2010, 2011 and 2012) and facilitating important progress on permits 
reform.  

B. 

Analytical and Advisory Activities (AAA) 

23. 
Dissemination of analytical and advisory activities, especially the 2011 Country 
Economic Memorandum (CEM) 2, remains an important vehicle for policy dialogue. 
Analytical and advisory activities remained central to implementation of the CPS and fostering 
country dialogue. These focused mostly on economic policy, social protection, poverty and 
agriculture.  A social protection study helped inform the piloting of a poverty targeting mechanism 
for social assistance provision.  Besides the CEM, which helped advance the dialogue on 
macroeconomic management and key structural reforms, a poverty assessment update 3 and two 
studies under the Pilot Program for Climate Change were completed during the period.  A  Khatlon 
regional development study (FY13) and sector-specific activities, such as the feasibility study for 
results-based financing in health, are paving the way for preparation of subsequent operations.  
Meanwhile, gender received specific attention in rural livelihoods, nutrition, and health 
projects―a focus that will be broadened in the remainder of the CPS (cf. para. 27 below). 

C. 

CPS Program FY13-14 

24. Going forward, the shift in program emphasis already underway—from crisis 
mitigation to the structural reforms needed to achieve inclusive, sustainable growth—will 
accelerate and intensify.  The government’s ongoing NDS (2006-15), its upcoming 4th Poverty 
Reduction Strategy (PRS-4) (2013-15), and the recommendations contained in the Bank’s 2011 
CEM will together provide the policy framework for planned operational and analytical and 
advisory activities in FY13-14.  The main goal will be to help stimulate increased private 
investment through private and financial sector development. The other four country-level

priorities are: public administration and governance; human capital development; energy security, 
and food security. Governance will remain a key cross-cutting theme and be increasingly 
mainstreamed into operations, in line with the CGAC strategy discussed above (paras.17-18), and 
gender will be accorded greater focus and priority (cf. para. 27 below).  The emphasis on financial 
and private sector development and public sector management will also address the two weakest 
clusters in Tajikistan’s 2011 Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA).  

25. 
The current CPS would be extended by one year from end-FY13 to end-FY14 to align 
with the government’s medium-term planning process.  The rationale for this is two-fold.  First, 
it would enable design of the next CPS (commencing FY15) to be aligned more closely to the 
government’s timetable for preparation of its second NDS, 2016-25.   Second, given the shift in 
program emphasis for the balance of the current CPS, it would permit more time for both the 
government and the WBG to assess the impact of on-going and planned structural reforms, thereby 
improving the quality of the baseline for the next CPS. 

26. 
Against this background and building on continued government reform efforts, a new 
series of annual development policy operations (DPOs) will be initiated in FY14.  Although 
the crisis mitigation response to the global downturn is now completed, continued budget support 
is justified for the following three reasons: first, the series of six PDPG operations now nearing 
completion has been an important vehicle for policy dialogue and instrumental in catalysing many 
of the structural reforms now in place or underway; second, PDPG operations have complemented 
and reinforced sector-specific reforms supported under other IDA-financed projects (e.g. in 
agriculture, education, health, social protection, and public administration); and third, Tajikistan’s 
CPIA rating has improved  - from 3.2 in 2007 to 3.4 in 2011—indirect evidence of the improving 
policy environment.  The scope and timing of individual DPOs would be proportionate to the 
scope and timing of the government’s reform program, with clear a priori rules of engagement.  
The policy framework would be more selective than the PDPG series and designed to achieve 
results in a fairly short period of time.   

27. Given Tajikistan’s pervasive gender disparities, a gender lens will be incorporated in 
individual projects to ensure that sector-specific issues are addressed―especially in 
agriculture, education, and health.  In this connection, a recent study on access to finance for 
women in rural areas generated important data that will be used to inform future analytical and 
operational work.  With increased migration of men to work outside Tajikistan, women constitute 
an increasing share of the agricultural labor force. The Tajikistan Environmental Land 
Management and Rural Livelihoods Project (FY13)—to be funded by the Pilot Program for 
Climate Resilience (PPCR), GEF, and other partners—provides for planning and screening of rural 
production and land investments to include consideration of issues faced by women and to involve 
them in decision-making, access to project benefits, and associated monitoring.  Ongoing 
educational projects, including a national testing center for access to higher education and a 
proposed skills development project in FY15 will address gender in their design and preparation.  
Finally, a gender assessment and gender monitoring are planned for FY13 and FY14 respectively. 

28. 
The results framework has been revised, streamlined, and updated to reflect the shift 
in program emphasis and the adjustments proposed for FY13-14.  Three examples of what the 
shift in emphasis will entail in terms of planned results include the following.  First, scaling up 
pilots and/or implementing recently-approved structural reforms to support private sector-led 
growth—e.g. ensuring the functioning of one-stop shops, and introducing new public-private 

13 

 
partnership (together with IFC); introducing an integrated land and property register based on the 
recently-approved land code, which will also help protect women's property rights; developing 
links from farm to market and sustainable land management practices, also critical for women who 
account for up to three quarters of the agricultural labor force.   Second, implementing new 
initiatives to strengthen demand side governance—e.g. bringing citizens' voice to bear by 
disseminating a nation-wide scorecard on social services and using this data as a baseline for the 
next PRSP; and using development policy operations and individual projects (e.g. private sector 
competitiveness-mining, health results-based financing, NGO monitoring of IDA -financed 
projects) to focus on other critical governance issues.  Third, from maintaining social expenditures 
to improving the quality of social services—in education, by focusing on content improvement and 
early childhood preparation; in health, by introducing results-based financing for better quality 
maternal and child health services; in targeting social assistance, by scaling up from a 2-rayon pilot 
to 10 rayons and later to a national register; and in water supply, by combining forces with EBRD 
to introduce a national mechanism for investment in safe drinking water.    

Private and financial sector development 

29. 
Private sector development would be supported through a combination of investment 
and associated analytical and advisory activities.  The private sector part of the reform agenda 
and policy dialogue underway in the context of PDPGs 5-6 will be followed up during 
implementation of the new $10 million private sector competitiveness project approved last May.  
Its objectives are to help further improve the business environment, to encourage the development 
of high potential industries such as mining, and to increase access to financial services.  In 
addition, reforms in tax policy and administration—identified as one of the main constraints to 
private sector development—will be supported by a proposed $15 million tax administration 
project later in FY13.   

30. 
The main focus of IFC’s activities is expected to remain unchanged.  IFC will continue 
to provide advisory services for improving the investment climate upon request. These are 
expected to include simplified tax administration, in consultation with the Bank, as well as 
activities designed to strengthen the regulatory environment, especially for climate change, energy, 
and public private partnerships (PPPs).  IFC is currently conducting a study of the Khatlon region, 
jointly with the Bank, which will help chart a path for growth through the combined resources of 
the public and private sectors.  Its contribution will focus on regional comparative advantage and 
competitiveness and attempt to identify sectors or businesses that could be priorities for 
investment.  IFC’s focus on strengthening the real sectors will continue to target agribusiness 
through investments and ongoing advisory work, including continued engagement with a leading 
international cotton trading company on a program to strengthen its supplier network in Tajikistan.  
However, major direct investments in local companies are unlikely, given the widespread under-
reporting that precludes a full appraisal of their true financial condition. 

31. 
In infrastructure, IFC will explore opportunities for advisory work in energy, 
especially hydropower, where the country’s potential is very high.  It is providing PPIAF 
assistance to establish a bankable Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) for the new Sangtuda 
hydropower project and is considering a large investment in this project.  It will remain engaged in 
regional transmission programs for power exchange, such as the proposed Central Asia – South 
Asia power transmission line project (CASA-1000).  IFC has an existing advisory engagement 
with the Government of Tajikistan with regard to structuring a tender for private sector 

14 

 
 
participation in the development of the Konimansur silver mine.  This project requires a substantial 
amount of institutional capacity building and has progressed slowly to date.  If IFC is able to 
secure the necessary level of political commitment from the Government to take the Konimansur 
mandate to completion, the project could have a major impact on Tajikistan’s economic 
development and would position the World Bank Group for greater involvement in mining. 

32. 
In the financial sector, Bank-supported activities include four ongoing grants from 
the Financial Reform and Strengthening Initiative Trust Fund (FIRST). These are designed 
to: (a) strengthen bank regulation and supervision; (b) improve access to credit by modernizing the 
system for moveable collateral; (c) strengthen the payments system; and (d) promote the 
development of a more competitive insurance market.  At the same time, IFC will explore 
opportunities to help strengthen the banking system, encourage the development of microfinance, 
and stimulate leasing.  However, there are presently few institutions that IFC can engage with 
directly, given their limited transparency and/or small asset and equity base. Meanwhile, advisory 
work on financial infrastructure, agricultural finance, and microfinance may pave the way for 
potential IFC investments later.   

Public administration and governance 

33. 
Besides the new series of annual DPOs, the ongoing public expenditure review will 
assess the quality of public spending and make recommendations to strengthen budgetary 
analysis and processes.  In particular, it will address four main issues: (a) whether the 
composition of public spending is consistent with the goals of faster economic growth and more 
rapid poverty reduction; (b) the impact of increased education and health spending on outcomes, 
regional equity, and public satisfaction with service delivery; (c) whether the current sectoral 
distribution of capital expenditure is appropriate, including implications for long-term fiscal 
sustainability; and (d) the quasi-fiscal deficit associated with Barki Tajik (Tajikistan’s largest 
enterprise), especially the measures needed to ensure it operates on sound commercial principles.   
Second, as noted earlier, the governance checklist and associated institutional, governance, and 
political economy analyses will help shape the design of the proposed health results-based 
financing and agricultural competitiveness projects.  Third, analytical work on procurement, the 
TALCO energy efficiency audit, and the institutional governance review planned for FY13 will 
further the governance, public accountability and transparency agendas.  

Human capital development 

34. Human capital development and social protection remain important priorities, given 
the limited progress on several Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).  Greater emphasis is 
particularly needed on maternal and child health and also on the quality of education outcomes.  
Based on a detailed feasibility study carried out last year, a $15 million health results-based 
financing project is currently under preparation for consideration later in FY13.  At the same time, 
the Bank is the supervising entity for a proposed Global Partnership for Education grant currently 
under preparation also for consideration later in FY13.  In addition, analytical work on skills 
development planned for FY14 will draw on the work and experience of GIZ and other 
development partners and inform a proposed FY15 operation.  As for social protection, a European 
Union-funded pilot project to target cash benefits is now being evaluated as the basis for a 
proposed nation-wide system; and, the communal services strategy included in the above-
mentioned $11.9 million additional financing for municipal infrastructure would pave the way for 

15 

 
 
 
the proposed communal services development fund tentatively planned for FY14, together with the 
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD).  Finally, if and when needed to 
address contingencies arising from the country’s vulnerability to natural disasters, IDA would seek 
to mobilize the incremental resources required.   

Energy security 

35. 
Additional financing of $18 million for the Energy Loss Reduction Project approved 
in FY12 will help establish the preconditions necessary for further development of the sector, 
including financial management reforms and improvements in energy efficiency.  It also 
includes financing for studies of the proposed CASA-1000 transmission line and assessment 
studies for the Rogun hydropower project under consideration by the government.  Responding to 
a government request for an independent economic, environmental, social and technical 
assessment of Rogun, the Bank committed to a role designed to ensure credible, transparent 
assessments that will bear international scrutiny and facilitate riparian dialogue.  Per the 
Government’s binding instructions, activity at the site will be restricted to general maintenance and 
construction for safety purposes only, until i) the assessment studies are completed and reviewed 
by the Panel of Experts; and ii) the riparian consultations have taken place.  In particular, there will 
be no activity leading to diversion of the Vaksh River during this period.  An independent panel of 
Bank-financed experts will review the assessment studies and prepare a separate report. The Bank 
will also undertake a comprehensive review of all relevant reports, including on the prospects for 
broadly beneficial regional water management arrangements.  Finally, the ongoing power 
alternatives study, expected to be completed later this year, will examine power alternatives 
(without reservoir storage), as well as efficiency measures, power supply, and regional trade 
options. 

Food security and agriculture 

36. 
A $28 million Global Agriculture and Food Security Program (GAFSP) grant, with an 
additional $18 million grant from IDA, will strengthen food security in the poorest districts 
of the south.  The operation scales up successful experience under the EU grant (cf. para. 14) 
while advancing institutional reforms in water management and land property rights.  Private 
investment in agriculture will be promoted through strengthened property rights as a result of the 
$10 million additional financing for land registration and cadastre approved in FY12.  At the same 
time, to mitigate the risks of spring flooding, the additional financing of $11.9 million for 
municipal infrastructure approved in FY12 also included a special allocation of up to $2 million to 
fortify river embankments and, as a result, an estimated 1,000 rural homes were protected.  
Meanwhile, analytical work in FY13 on Khatlon Regional Development, the role of government in 
agriculture, irrigation and drainage investment planning and management, and a rural investment 
climate assessment will together provide a holistic view of the reforms required to facilitate 
preparation of agricultural competitiveness and water management operations in FY14 and FY15 
respectively. 

Regional issues 

37. 
At the regional level, the Bank will continue to help Tajikistan explore opportunities 
for enhanced cooperation.  For example, the proposed CASA-1000 project (FY14) would enable 
Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan to export summer surplus electricity to Afghanistan and Pakistan.  

16 

 
 
 
 
 
 
Tajikistan is receiving financial and technical advisory services through the ongoing Energy Loss 
Reduction Project.  The next meeting of the Tajikistan Development Forum currently planned for 
December 2012 will focus on multi-donor, cross-sectoral initiatives that may also include stronger 
connectivity through regional linkages. 

Coordination & Partnerships 

D. 
38. Given the limited IDA and other resources available, greater coherence among 
development partners will be a focus of the next meeting of the Tajikistan Development 
Forum.  The Development Coordination Council (DCC) in Dushanbe has played a key role in 
strengthening country ownership and mutual accountability through sector and thematic working 
groups, in line with the 2005 Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness.  In December 2010, it helped 
organize a 2-day high-level meeting of the Tajikistan Development Forum and, in December 2011, 
a 1-day follow-up meeting.  The World Bank is currently chair of the DCC and will lead its 
preparations for the upcoming Development Forum. Meanwhile, it will coordinate with 
development partners having supplementary resources and, in addition, seek to use Trust Funds 
more strategically, i.e. to co-finance ongoing or planned IDA-financed operations rather than to 
finance new, separate activities. 

V. 

RISKS 

39. 
None of the specific contingencies discussed in the original CPS materialized, but two 
of the four risk areas identified—macroeconomic and geo-political―remain valid.  Regarding 
macroeconomic risks, although Tajikistan weathered the 2008-09 global downturn better than 
expected at the time, the risk of possibly slower growth in Russia—and thus of declining 
remittances and even the involuntary repatriation of Tajik migrants—remains.  Second, 
weaknesses in the prudential regulation and supervision of Tajikistan’s banks exacerbate concerns 
about directed lending and the resolution of associated non-performing loans—the accumulation of 
which poses significant quasi-fiscal risks.  These must be reduced while eliminating directed 
lending altogether.  The Bank is working closely with the IMF with the aim of ensuring that 
directed lending is discontinued without further delay and also that the troubled banks concerned 
are resolved according to international principles. Finally, Tajikistan’s public finance management 
system is characterized by insufficient internal controls, inadequate transparency, weak 
governance, low capacity, and poor cash management and budget execution—all of which could 
undermine efforts to enforce fiscal discipline and accountability.  These are being addressed 
through technical assistance in response to key recommendations of the PEFA, CPSR, and IMF 
reports and implementation of the Public Finance Management Modernization Project. The Bank 
sees closer collaboration with other development partners as key to moving this agenda forward as 
well as a high degree of vigilance in its operational activities. However, some risks remain and 
cannot be fully mitigated. 

40. 
The potential for political and social instability as a result of uncertainties in 
neighbouring Afghanistan remains high. Increasing tension between Tajikistan and its 
neighbours over regional issues—especially the management and use of trans-boundary energy 
and water resources—constitutes a continuing risk.  The public consultations among riparian states 
in connection with the Rogun assessment studies will allow for open discussion of national 
viewpoints and potentially contribute 
to a process of evidence-based policy dialogue.  

17 

 
 
 
 
Furthermore, although the government has consolidated its control of the country, sporadic 
incidents could affect political stability. Broader risks related to political-military issues are 
beyond the scope of the WBG’s mandate, and hence, staff will liaise with key bilateral agencies as 
well as the UN Specialized Agencies concerned to monitor political and security developments, 
and to assess their potential impact on the CPS program.   

41. 
Finally, the country’s weak human and institutional capacity and governance remain 
significant risks to CPS implementation.  These weaknesses are partly a legacy of Tajikistan’s 
civil war and partly a function of its political economy and limited financial resources.   Capacity 
constraints also may limit the scope for governance reforms. In addition, weak public financial 
management may pose a macro and governance risk. It was partly for these reasons that Tajikistan 
was one of four countries in Europe and Central Asia selected to pilot the Country Governance and 
Anti-Corruption Framework (CGAC) with, as reported elsewhere in this CPSPR, broadly 
satisfactory initial experience.  Continued implementation of CGAC-related activities, in particular 
the planned mainstreaming of the governance checklist in all ongoing and new projects, as well as 
ongoing and planned analytical activities and technical assistance in public administration and 
public finance management, will be the main instruments for mitigating and managing operational 
risks related to governance.

Annex 2. Gender Disparities in Tajikistan  

Despite relatively high levels of human capital endowment compared to other low income countries and 
progress in several gender-related areas over the last decade, Tajikistan is still affected by significant 
gender disparities―in education, especially in enrollments at the tertiary level, and in health, especially in 
terms of maternal mortality. Access to economic opportunities by women―characterized by low labor 
force participation, depressed wages, and few female business managers and owners―is also limited. 

GENDER GAPS IN HUMAN CAPITAL 

Education.  While enrollment rates at all levels of education are significantly higher in Tajikistan than 
the average for low income countries, net primary and secondary enrollment rates for boys are 
respectively 4 and 5 percentage points higher than for girls.  Moreover, gross tertiary enrollment rates for 
boys are 17 percentage points higher than for girls.  This large gender gap at the tertiary level may be a 
function of the high out-migration of young men and consequently the differential rates of return to 
education and ultimately wages. 

Health. Selected health indicators point to an overall reduction in gender disparities between 2000 and 
2010.  The gender gap in life expectancy is 7 percentage points, which is comparable to the OECD 
average.  Moreover, female life expectancy in Tajikistan is 71 years, compared to 60 years for low 
income countries in 2010.  Maternal mortality is an estimated 65/100,000 births, which, although double 
the ECA developing countries’ average, is about six times lower than the average for all low income 
countries, and reflects the number of women receiving pre-natal care (80 percent in 2008).  Finally, 
fertility rates in Tajikistan remain the highest in Central Asia, despite a decline since 1990, although 
adolescent fertility is in line with the ECA average. 

GENDER GAPS IN ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES 

Labor markets and entrepreneurship. Gender disparities in labor markets and access to economic 
opportunities are large.  Labor force participation (60% for women and 78% for men) is similar to the 
ECA developing countries’ average (58 and 76% respectively), but below the average seen in low income 
countries.  It decreased between 2000-2010 for both women (―2%age points) and men (―1%age point), 
in contrast to low income countries where it increased by 2%age points for women.  

Gender inequalities are also present in terms of female earnings relative to male earnings. According to 
UNECE, women’s average monthly earnings are 49% of men’s in 2011 which places Tajikistan scores 
well below ECA’s average. This wage gap could be due to occupational segregation, differences in hours 
worked and productivity, and/or discrimination. Lastly, the share of formal SMEs with women’s 
ownership in Tajikistan is similar to the ECA regional average at 34%. The share of these firms with 
women in top management positions is low (12%) compared to ECA regional average of 19%. 

Voice and agency.  Women’s political participation in Tajikistan, as in most countries, remains low but 
has shown improvements in recent years.  Women represent a low but increasing share of members of 
parliament (19% in 2010 compared to 15% in 2000, according to UNECE), and an even lower share of 
government ministers (12% in 2006, in line with the ECA average of 13%).
