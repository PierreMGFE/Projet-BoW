EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

Bolivia has undergone a period of profound change since the Government of President 
Morales came to power in January 2006. The Morales administration has implemented an 
array of economic and social policies to empower indigenous peoples and reduce poverty and 
inequality. Macroeconomic results have been positive, with regular fiscal and current account 
balances for the first time in decades, declining public debt and steady 4.5 percent annual growth 
rates over the past seven years. A new Constitution was enacted in February 2009 and President 
Morales was sworn in for a second term in January 2010.  

The country faces numerous development challenges. Bolivia has one of the lowest GDP per 
capita levels in the Latin America and Caribbean (LAC) region. Moderate poverty has declined 
in recent years, but still afflicts nearly 60 percent of the population. Poverty is even higher in 
rural areas, though the rate of improvement has been faster. Income inequality has also 
decreased, but with a Gini index of 0.56 in 2007, Bolivia remains one of the most unequal 
countries in LAC. Recent economic growth is vulnerable to shifts in international commodity 
prices and total investment is low. Social indicators have improved since the 1990s but are still 
well below levels in neighboring countries. And while much abated since the Government’s re-
election, social and political tensions could return, especially if economic development slows.  

The World Bank Group (WBG) and the Government have agreed on this four-year 
Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) as a viable medium-term program for addressing 
upcoming development challenges. The conditions for the implementation of a CPS are in 
place—a new constitutional framework, consolidated policy environment, sound macroeconomic 
situation, good dialogue between the WBG and authorities and improved implementation 
capacities—and the Government has requested Bank support through a medium-term strategy. 

In May 2006 the Government launched its National Development Plan (NDP), which has 
been updated for President Morales’ second administration. The NDP seeks to increase state 
participation in strategic sectors, channel resources to labor-intensive sectors and develop 
specific geographic areas; introduce new social programs while scaling up existing ones; ensure 
greater country ownership of Bolivia’s development process and self-sufficiency in food and 
energy production; and undertake a profound social and political reform through the new 
Constitution. The updated Government Program for 2010-2015 has a strong focus on agricultural 
transformation to reduce rural poverty and ensure food security, and improving infrastructure to 
enhance development.    

In light of Bolivia’s greater institutional and economic stability and in response to 
Government requests, the WBG has developed this CPS around the NDP. After 
implementing two consecutive Interim Strategy Notes (ISN), the situation in Bolivia now allows 
for the preparation and implementation of a four-year strategy. This CPS takes into account 
lessons learned from previous strategies and benefitted from a comprehensive consultation 
process that informed the strategy’s selective approach. The CPS is designed around the 
principles of: (i) alignment with Government priorities; (ii) selectivity and (iii) coordination with 
development partners. A results matrix will track program implementation and its impact on 
country development goals.  

i 

 
 
 
 
 
The CPS proposes a program of lending operations and knowledge activities in four 
prioritized results areas: (i) sustainable productive development; (ii) climate change and 
disaster risk management; (iii) human development and access to basic services; and (iv) public 
sector effectiveness. These results areas respond to Government requests and the priorities 
outlined in the NDP, and make the most of the WBG’s comparative advantage. The Bank will 
also work to improve the execution of existing trust funds while searching for new ones to 
achieve results in these areas.  

Support to rural production and infrastructure will be an important focus of the CPS. 
Several Bank operations will be geared towards helping rural producers sustainably improve 
production and incomes. Infrastructure needs will also be addressed to benefit production and 
national economic integration. The International Finance Corporation (IFC) will focus on export-
oriented clients and fostering greater private sector activity, especially among job-creating small 
and medium enterprises (SMEs). The CPS envisions further support to restore access to basic 
infrastructure damaged by natural disasters, as well as assistance to help the country adapt to 
climate change and integrate climate resilience into public policies.   

Improving access to and the quality of social and basic services will play a major role in 
meeting objectives, as will actions to strengthen the public sector. The Bank portfolio will 
help improve the coverage and quality of health and education services, including maternal and 
infant health, and employment programs for low-income youth. Expanding access to electricity, 
water and sanitation services will also be a priority. The Bank will mainstream public sector 
strengthening actions into all activities and seek to support the decentralization process. Further 
assistance will help improve the availability and quality of data for decision-making.   

The WBG’s portfolio will incorporate gender and governance and anti-corruption as cross- 
cutting themes. All results areas have a gender focus, and most projects undertake participative 
mechanisms to include the voices of women in project design and implementation. The WBG is 
working closely with the authorities to advance the governance and anti-corruption agenda 
through operations and technical assistance. All operations will incorporate transparency 
mechanisms, capacity building measures and consultation processes to strengthen governance.  

This four-year CPS period may involve a transition from the International Development 
Association (IDA) to the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD). 
The Government submitted a formal request to move to IBRD lending. This request will be 
assessed at the CPS midpoint and IBRD lending would potentially be phased in after this point. 
Up to the CPS midpoint review, Bolivia would only access IDA financing. 

Political, economic and institutional issues pose risks to this CPS, but the WBG and 
authorities are working to mitigate them. To mitigate political risks the WBG is targeting 
activities with broad political support. Institutional risks are addressed by a deep program of 
technical assistance in key areas as well as strengthening inclusive civil society oversight and 
accountability mechanisms for WBG activities. Economic risks are foremost mitigated by the 
Government’s ongoing sound macroeconomic management and by close monitoring and 
technical assistance in areas such as debt management.

I. INTRODUCTION 

1. 
In the nearly six years since Mr. Evo Morales was elected as Bolivia’s first 
indigenous president, the country has experienced significant socio-political and economic 
change. Driven by high commodity prices and prudent fiscal and monetary policies, Bolivia’s 
economy has had an annual average growth of 4.5 percent for the past seven years, increasing 
per capita income by 18 percent. Current account surpluses have prevailed since 2003, and the 
fiscal balance turned positive in 2006 for the first time in decades. Thanks to this positive 
macroeconomic performance and debt relief, gross public debt dropped from 96 percent of gross 
domestic product (GDP) in 2003 to 40 percent in 2010 while international reserves increased 
from less than $1 billion to nearly $10 billion over the same time span. Deposits have tripled and 
credits doubled in the last seven years while banks have strengthened their solvency and 
liquidity. The national poverty rate in Bolivia declined slightly, from 63 percent in 2005 to 59 
percent in 2008, but extreme rural poverty dropped 10 percentage points over the same time 
period and income inequality has trended downward.  

2. 
Despite progress, Bolivia faces major development challenges. It has one of the lowest 
GDP per capita levels in the Latin America and Caribbean (LAC) region, moderate poverty 
afflicts more than half of the population and income inequality is still very high. Recent 
economic growth is vulnerable to shifts in international commodity prices and total investment is 
low, limiting economic expansion. Productive enterprises in the rural sector—where one-third of 
the population lives—remain hampered by inadequate infrastructure. Informality is high, which 
translates into lower productivity and tax revenue. Public sector governance is weak, limiting 
policy effectiveness and outcomes. Gender inequalities and social indicators, while much 
improved since the 1990s, are still well below the levels of neighboring countries. And while 
much abated since the Government’s re-election in December 2009, social and political tensions 
could return to the fore, especially if economic development slows.  

3. 
This four-year World Bank Group (WBG) Country Partnership Strategy (CPS), 
agreed upon with the Government, proposes a viable medium-term program for 
addressing some of Bolivia’s challenges. During the consolidation of the reform process 
initiated by the election of the Government of President Morales, the WBG has operated through 
two consecutive Interim Strategy Notes (ISNs), following the recommendation from the 2005 
Country Assistance Evaluation to use shorter-term strategies in the face of high uncertainty. Now 
that the conditions for the implementation of a CPS are in place—a new constitutional 
framework, consolidated policy environment, sound macroeconomic situation, good dialogue 
between the WBG and authorities and improved implementation capacity—and the Government 
has requested Bank support through a medium-term strategy. 

II. COUNTRY CONTEXT AND DEVELOPMENT AGENDA 

A. Social and Political Context 

4. 
After years of political unrest, Evo Morales’ election in 2005 as the first president of 
indigenous origin in Bolivia brought the country a period of institutional stability. In 
December 2009 the Government called for early elections in which the ruling Movimiento al 
Socialismo (MAS) obtained 64 percent of the vote, up from 54 percent attained in the 2005 

1 

elections. The Morales’ Government came into power for a second five-year term in January 
2010. The proposed CPS is intended to cover the rest of the Morales second administration until 
2015.  

5. 
A new Constitution was enacted in February 2009 and the legal framework for its 
implementation is being developed. The Constitution establishes principles such as access to 
public services as a fundamental right, an autonomous regime inclusive of indigenous 
jurisdictions, increased state participation in the exploitation of natural resources and the 
provision of basic public services. The National Assembly, in which the ruling Movimiento al 
Socialismo (MAS) party has a two-thirds majority, has passed some of the laws required to 
implement the new Constitution, including the reform of the electoral and judicial regimes and a 
provisional autonomy framework. The pending legislative agenda includes other important 
initiatives in areas such as labor, foreign investment, public enterprises, social oversight and 
participation, land and forestry. 

6. 
Social demands and demonstrations have not ceased since the Government of 
Morales came into power for a second term, but are now focused on specific claims for 
improvement or changes in public policies, as is common in many LAC countries. 
Previously, opposition to the administration came from more structured regional and political 
sectors, mainly in the lowlands, but now protests come from organizations traditionally more 
supportive of the Morales administration, such as indigenous people’s organizations, labor 
unions and others. For example, following the Government’s December 2010 announcement to 
eliminate fuel subsidies and increase fuel costs by an average of 83 percent, Bolivia experienced 
nationwide street protests. Five days later the Morales administration reversed this decision, 
arguing that “the Government had listened to the people”. This episode demonstrates that the 
Government has realized that it needs to turn more to negotiation to create consensus among 
affected groups to implement public policies.  

7. 
The Morales administration continues to argue that indigenous rights and 
development opportunities for the rural poor are fundamental elements of the public 
agenda. About two-thirds of the population identifies itself as indigenous. The indigenous 
population in rural areas has traditionally suffered from high levels of poverty, limited economic, 
social and political rights, marginalization and exclusion from public services. The new 
Constitution recognizes all 36 indigenous languages as official, alongside with Spanish. Bolivia 
is signatory to both the 1991 International Labor Organization (ILO) Convention, which 
recognizes the territories, languages, communities and cultures of indigenous peoples, and the 
2007 United Nations (UN) Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. 

B. Poverty and Inequality Profile  

8. 
Bolivia has recorded declines in poverty and inequality during the past decade, but 
levels remain among the highest in the LAC region. According to official figures, moderate 
poverty declined from 66 percent in 2000 to 59 percent in 2008, while extreme poverty fell from 
45 percent to 33 percent (Table 1). This decline is more noticeable in rural compared to urban 
areas. A significant proportion of the poor are indigenous, though the gap has reduced 
significantly in recent years. These figures, as well as more recent ones which report even further 
declines in poverty rates, are subject to discussion due to lack of data comparability and other 

2 

methodological problems. Sustained economic growth and the introduction of some innovative 
social programs give credence to the continuing decline of poverty in recent years, but statistics 
need to be improved before valid inter-temporal comparisons are made. The Bank is working 
with the Government to improve the reliability and comparability of poverty statistics.

Despite improvements, high levels of income inequality still persist in Bolivia. 
Although the Gini index decreased from 0.62 in 2000 to 0.56 in 2007 (Table 2), this is still one 
of the highest in the LAC region. Inequality is greater in rural areas, where the Gini stood at 0.64 
compared to 0.51 in urban areas. A 2007 World Bank study on Poverty, Inequality and 
Vulnerability showed that non-monetary indicators reinforce inequality. The dramatic disparities 
in indicators between geographic regions, income groups and ethnic origin reflect the complex 
social structure and history of the country.

The Human Opportunity Index (HOI), a measure of equality of opportunities in 
access to basic services for children and youth, shows improvements in most indicators for 
1998-2008. A forthcoming World Bank HOI study for Bolivia shows that equitable access to 
vaccination, nutrition, assisted birth delivery and primary and secondary enrollment have 
improved significantly. However, equitable access to basic sanitation and adequate housing 
infrastructure still show very low levels and modest advances. National-level HOI averages mask 
important regional disparities. While departments like La Paz and Santa Cruz show leading 
numbers in most indicators, others like Potosí, Chuquisaca, Beni and Pando tend to lag 
significantly behind. 

11. 
Bolivia has made notable progress toward achieving some Millennium Development 
Goals (MDGs) but slow improvements in others, notably several health indicators. The

Sixth MDG Progress Report produced by the Government’s Economic and Social Policy 
Analysis Unit (Unidad de Análisis de Políticas Sociales y Económicas—UDAPE) concluded that 
important advances occurred in some areas such as extreme poverty reduction, malnutrition and 
gender equality, but that further efforts are needed if Bolivia is to reach the MDGs by 2015 
(Table 3). Particular areas of concern include adolescent fertility, maternal and child mortality 
ratios, prevalence of Chagas disease, AIDS and tuberculosis, primary school completion rates 
and access to improved sanitation facilities.

C. Recent Economic Developments 

12. 
Bolivia’s economy has performed comparatively well during the past decade. A 
favorable external environment and prudent macroeconomic policies have generated fiscal and 
current account surpluses, a relatively robust financial system and increased international 

4 

 
 
reserves. This allowed Bolivia to confront the 2008-09 global crisis with good macroeconomic 
fundamentals, which in combination with Bolivia’s relative isolation from international financial 
markets helped the country get through the crisis in good shape. Bolivia had the strongest 
performance in LAC in 2009, with GDP growing at 3.4 percent that year. 

13. Growth has been stimulated through large investments in the gas and mining 
sectors in the late 1990s and early 2000s, combined with an improvement in the terms of 
trade. GDP growth has averaged 4.5 percent annually over the last seven years, which has 
translated into an 18.3 percent rise in per capita income. Mining output has almost doubled since 
2006, due mostly to the foreign-financed San Cristóbal project, which began operations in 2007. 
Households have benefited from higher export earnings, public investment and social transfers. 
Furthermore, remittances have increased from US$170 million in 2003 to around US$1 billion in 
the last three years, representing around 5 percent of GDP. Strong exports and dynamic domestic 
demand have spurred other sectors including construction, manufacturing, finance, transport and 
communications. 

14. 
The country has become more resilient, posting steady fiscal and current account 
surpluses and declining public debt levels. Current account surpluses have prevailed since 
2003, peaking at around 12 percent of GDP in 2006-2008 due to booming commodity prices and 
growing mining export volumes (Table 4). The 2008 international crisis temporarily reduced 
commodity prices and Brazilian gas demand, but the current account surplus nevertheless 
remained at near 5 percent of GDP in 2009 and 2010. International reserves increased from 
US$976 million in 2003 to US$9.7 billion in 2010, equivalent to almost 20 months of imports. 
The public sector maintained fiscal surpluses for five consecutive years due to higher gas 
revenues and tax collections; public expenditure also increased but difficulties in further boosting 
public investment helped maintain the surplus. These fiscal surpluses together with the 
Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) diminished gross public debt from 96 percent of GDP 
in 2003 to 40 percent in 2010. As a result, the 2011 International Monetary Fund (IMF) Article 
IV Consultation for Bolivia concluded that the risk of debt distress is very low, with public and 
external debt indicators below risky levels even in the worse stress test scenario. Over the past 
few years, Fitch has upgraded Bolivia’s risk rating from B- with a negative outlook in 2005 to 
B+ with a stable outlook in 2010, and S&P has upgraded Bolivia’s foreign currency long-term 
debt rating from B- with a stable outlook in 2007 to B+ with a positive outlook in 2011. 

15. While inflation is under control, higher international food prices and natural 
disasters have generated sporadic surges. Bolivia faced two inflation upsurges interrupted by 
the global slowdowns—12-month inflation rose from 4.9 percent in December 2005 to 17.3 
percent in June 2008 and from 0.3 percent in December 2009 to 11 percent in July 2011. Supply 
issues were the main driver of the upsurges, but the Central Bank mopped up liquidity and 
appreciated the exchange rate to control expectations and thus avoid second-round effects. The 
Government has also implemented heterodox policies to control prices, including sales by public 
agencies, export restrictions and price controls, with mixed results. 

16. 
The financial system is strong and expanding coverage. Banks are adequately 
capitalized, return on equity and return on assets average 17 and 1.3 percent, liquidity is around 
35 percent and provisions reach 177 percent of non-performing loans (NPLs). Due to 
appreciation and measures to curb dollarization, dollar-denominated savings and credits dropped 

5 

to 40 and 33 percent respectively. NPLs decreased from 17 percent in 2005 to 1.9 percent in 
August 2011, reflecting efforts to clean up their portfolios, sound credit evaluation standards and 
the good economic context. Solid indicators are also reported for the large supervised non-bank 
financial institutions, which currently account for 27 percent of the sector’s assets. Since 2007, 
the financial system has expanded significantly, with deposits reaching 48 percent of GDP. 
Credit surged 30 percent in the last year with a strong increase in smaller credits. Hitherto 
unsupervised microfinance institutions are being brought under the supervision of the Financial 
System Supervision Authority (Autoridad de Supervisión del Sistema Financiero—ASFI), 
strengthening the overall financial system. 

17. 
Bolivia’s macroeconomic stance has improved, but significant challenges remain. 
Industries such as mining, hydrocarbon and electricity production are operating at almost full 
capacity, thus limiting new sources of growth unless significant investments take place. Despite 
public investment levels around 10 percent of GDP, important infrastructure gaps and weak 
institutional capacity hurts Bolivia’s development prospects. Challenges in health and education 
limit the formation of human capital. Moreover, the country is highly dependent on commodity 
exports, which represented about 82 percent of total exports and 32 percent of total revenues in 
2010. A significant drop in commodity prices has current account and fiscal implications as well 
as a deteriorating effect on growth. 

18. 
Bolivia’s private sector continues to face significant challenges that limit its 
development. Challenges range from the country’s geographical isolation and heavy operating 
costs, to burdensome red tape. Bolivia’s unequal income distribution and widespread poverty 
restrict its domestic market. The Government has created and strengthened public enterprises in 
several sectors including food, mining, manufacturing and banking. Nationalization of some 
firms in the hydrocarbons, smelting, electricity, telecommunications, water and cement sectors 
poses additional challenges, which might be compounded by ongoing reforms of the regulatory 
framework. Both the World Bank Group’s Doing Business Report and the World Economic 
Forum’s Global Competitiveness Report recognize the difficulty of business entry, business 
operations and the investment climate. Six out of every ten urban workers is employed in the 
informal sector (about 75 percent of women and 60 percent of men)—one of the highest 
informality levels in the world—constraining the development opportunities of micro and small 
enterprises and overall economic growth. Foreign direct investment (FDI) and private sector 
investment in Bolivia as percentages of GDP are both lower than the average for IDA countries 
globally and for nearly all other IDA countries in LAC.

D. Economic Outlook 

19. 
External conditions improved during the first half of 2011 and gas export prices are 
likely to drive continued strong macroeconomic results for the year. Higher commodity 
prices and recovering gas export volumes to Brazil and Argentina favor Bolivian exports. The 
current account surplus is expected to rise from 4.6 percent of GDP in 2010 to 6.8 percent in 
2011, increasing international reserves to US$12.4 billion by the end of the year. The fiscal 
surplus is expected to increase from 1.7 percent of GDP in 2010 to 3.7 percent in 2011 as 
hydrocarbon revenues increase and the Government continues to encounter capacity difficulties 
in increasing public investment. Growth should increase to 5 percent in 2011, boosted by internal 
demand and gas export volumes and prices. Inflation is expected to fall to 7 percent this year as 
food prices decrease and contractive monetary and exchange rate policies reduce demand 
pressures.  

20. Growth faces additional challenges going forward. Yacimientos Petrolíferos Fiscales 
Bolivianos (YPFB)—the state oil and gas company—has not been able to boost investment in the 
sector. As a result, Bolivia’s gas production capacity has stagnated, delaying the expansion of 
gas exports to Argentina and other markets. Neighbors are reducing their energy dependence on 
Bolivia by developing their own reserves and building liquefied natural gas (LNG) plants. Due to 
a methodological change in their calculation, Bolivia’s proven gas reserves fell to around 10 
trillion cubic feet (TCF), down from the 27 TCF proven reserves measured in 2005. Mining 
growth prospects are modest as San Cristóbal has already reached its maximum capacity and 
further investments are delayed. Development of the Mutún iron ore reserve and the large 
lithium reserves in Uyuni have been slower than planned due to the lack of energy supply, 
insufficient transport infrastructure and lack of investment. Some labor-intensive sectors, in 
particular manufacturing, could be constrained by the lack of private investment linked to the 
overall business climate environment and uncertainties generated by ongoing legal reforms and 
restrictions on energy supplies. 

21. 
As a result of these challenges and likely external conditions, growth is expected to 
converge to 3.8 percent in the medium term. Private investment is expected to remain low at 
around 7 percent of GDP, while commodity prices are expected to decrease, although modestly, 
in the upcoming years. The current account surplus should decline to 1.4 percent of GDP in 2015 
if mining and gas exports stagnate, remittances decline and imports are boosted by a robust 
domestic demand and real appreciation. International reserves are expected to rise from US$13 
billion in 2011 to US$18 billion in 2015. On the fiscal front, the surplus should gradually 
decrease from 3.7 percent of GDP in 2011 to near balance or a slight deficit in 2013-15, 
assuming hydrocarbon revenues stagnate and expenditures continue growing. The central 
government is also expected to run deficits and accumulate debt, but as a share of GDP gross 
public debt is projected to decrease from 40 percent in 2010 to 37 percent in 2014 as nominal 
GDP grows. This trend would be reversed by the end of the projection period due to emerging 
fiscal deficit.  

22. 
Several downside risks exist to economic growth. A reversal in the international 
recovery may negatively affect Bolivia’s prospects, eroding external and fiscal balances through 
falling commodity prices, reduced gas volume exports to Brazil and Argentina and lower 
remittances from Spain, the US and Argentina. Commodity exports represented about 82 percent 

7 

of total exports and 32 percent of total revenues in 2010, and a significant drop in commodity 
prices has both current account and fiscal implications. If the Government succeeds in securing 
partners to carry out announced investment projects, particularly in the mining and hydrocarbon 
sectors, medium term growth prospects may improve significantly. On the other hand, high 
international reserves may increase the pressure to spend or to consolidate a de facto fixed 
exchange rate affecting the capacity to react to external shocks. The fiscal situation could also be 
eroded by decentralization pressures and costs related to the nationalization process.  

23. 
Longer term growth obstacles need to be addressed in infrastructure, the financial 
sector and the business environment. Important infrastructure gaps and weak institutional 
capacity hurt Bolivia’s development prospects. With regard to the financial sector, the recent 
surge in credit growth as well as the strong dependence on real estate as collateral will have to be 
carefully monitored. Furthermore, the Government must balance measures to foster financial 
inclusion, including the provision of loans through public entities and changes to the regulatory 
framework, with the risk of over-indebtedness and a possible deterioration in the repayment 
culture. The overall business environment is generally not conducive to large private sector 
participation. As a result private investment and productivity are low, particularly in agriculture, 
and informality rampant. Growth prospects are likely to thus remain limited until these important 
challenges are addressed.

E. The National Development Plan and Government Priorities  

24. 
The ongoing National Development Plan (NDP) was designed during President 
Morales’ first administration. In May 2006, the Government launched the NDP, built around 
four pillars. Bolivia Productiva (Productive Bolivia) seeks to increase state participation in 
strategic sectors—primarily natural resources and utilities—channel resources to labor-intensive 
sectors and focus on developing specific geographic areas through financial and technical 
support. Bolivia Digna (Dignified Bolivia) introduces new social programs and scales up 
existing ones, such as redistributive transfers and safety nets, to fight poverty and exclusion. 
Bolivia Soberana (Sovereign Bolivia) seeks greater country ownership of Bolivia’s development 
process while eliminating external influences on policies, a strengthened status in international 
forums through the maintenance of balanced relations with other countries and self-sufficiency in 
food and energy production. Bolivia Democrática y Participativa (Democratic and Participatory 
Bolivia) proposes a profound social and political reform through a new Constitution.  

25. 
During its second administration, the Government is placing renewed emphasis on 
strategic areas of the NDP and has identified additional priorities. The proposed 
Government Program for 2010-2015 was presented in December 2009 and is based on and 

8 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
updates the NDP. Its goals are to boost economic growth through public investment, promote 
productive development and improve infrastructure. In the social sectors, the Government 
proposes to work towards reducing inequality, eradicating exclusion and ensuring the full 
exercise of fundamental rights by increasing the coverage of public social services such as 
health, education and housing. Finally, the program aims to ensure participation and social 
oversight of public policies, and to gradually implement the new autonomy framework through 
programmatic agreements between different levels of government. 

26. 
The NDP and sector strategies share the principles of the MDGs. The Bolivia 
Productiva pillar is aligned with the goal of reducing poverty and extreme poverty by identifying 
and implementing public policies that create opportunities for income generation. The Bolivia 
Digna pillar defines social programs directed at improving human development and increasing 
access to basic social services such as water and basic sanitation, education and health. Activities 
under the Bolivia Digna pillar—several of which are supported by activities envisioned in this 
CPS—will be especially important in addressing the health and education MDGs showing slow 
progress toward the 2015 goals. 

III. WORLD BANK GROUP PARTNERSHIP 

A. Lessons Learned and Stakeholder Feedback 

Past World Bank Experience  
27. 
Since 2004, the WBG has adopted three consecutive short-term strategies in a 
context of high uncertainty. Given a volatile economic and social context, the WBG decided to 
implement consecutive short timeframe strategies to provide flexibility to respond to the 
country’s changing circumstances and needs. The last Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for 
Bolivia covered the period FY04-05, and was followed by two ISNs covering FY07-09 and 
FY10-11. A Completion Report that reviewed the Bank’s assistance to Bolivia for the fiscal 
period 2004-2011 provides relevant lessons for the design and implementation of the new 
strategy (Annex 2). 

Lessons Learned 
28. 
Fragmentation of interventions into small operations is likely to increase transaction 
costs for the Government and the Bank and limit their impact. Eight investment projects for 
an average of US$18 million were approved under the first ISN in many different areas. 
Although the lending program had been agreed upon with the Government, the simultaneous 
preparation of these many programs have proved difficult to handle. Several months were needed 
after project approval to reach readiness for implementation and to enter into effectiveness, 
sometimes due to a lack of agreements in operational issues and approaches. The second ISN 
was therefore more selective and only two key investment operations for a total of US$160 
million were approved. The Bank worked closely with Government counterparts to foster 
ownership for the projects and their implementation. Selectivity and larger projects have the 
potential to yield greater development impacts as well as to contain transaction costs both for the 
Bank and the Government. 

9 

29. 
Anticipation and close attention to implementation challenges coupled with less 
complex institutional arrangements can reduce delays in project execution. To avoid 
cumbersome adjustments and amendment processes, 
institutional and 
implementation 
arrangements have to be kept simple and flexible. Implementation needs to be accompanied by 
close supervision and systematic capacity building activities. An unbiased, balanced and realistic 
risk assessment is needed during the design and execution of the strategy as well as in the 
implementation of individual operations to improve prospects for development effectiveness. 
This is being addressed through tools such as the Operational Risk Assessment Framework 
(ORAF). 

Consultations 
30. 
The preparation of this CPS benefitted from consultations with a large and 
representative sample of civil society, including women’s organizations. A total of about 300 
people participated in nine consultation workshops, which provided spaces to discuss themes 
linked to the strategic areas of the new CPS. Participants included representatives from women’s 
indigenous and peasant organizations, the private sector, non-governmental organizations 
(NGOs), productive organizations, municipal councils, departmental assemblies, youth and 
women’s groups and main donors active in Bolivia. Annex 3 describes the CPS consultation 
process and results in more detail.  

31. 
The consultation process informed and validated the selective approach taken in the 
preparation of the CPS. The process validated WBG efforts to strengthen interventions in rural 
development and to continue work in urban areas with a strong gender focus. Feedback from 
urban and rural women’s groups and among the rural poor strongly supported the overall 
direction of planned CPS activities, and provided valuable perspectives that will inform project 
interventions and Analytical and Advisory Activities (AAA). Based on the feedback received 
from development partners, it was decided to intensify activities to assist the Government 
improve implementation and fiduciary capacity at both the national and sub-national levels. This 
is particularly important in view of the need to advance in the adoption of national systems. 

B. Proposed World Bank Group Partnership Strategy  

Principles of World Bank Group Engagement 
32. 
The proposed four-year CPS is designed around three principles: (i) alignment with 
Government priorities; (ii) selectivity; and (iii) coordination with development partners. 
These principles take into account lessons learned from previous strategies and feedback 
received during consultations with the Government, civil society, private sector, and other 
development partners, and is critical to achieving country ownership and effective development 
results. 

 Alignment with Government strategic priorities: The CPS is consistent with the goals 
of the National Development Plan and is aligned with the pillars Bolivia Productiva, Bolivia 
Democratica y Participativa and Bolivia Digna and the activities envisaged within the 
Government Plan 2010-2015. Operations considered under the CPS target the areas in 
which the Government has full ownership and sufficient implementation capacity, as 
discussed with counterparts during CPS design.  

10 

 Selectivity: The Government and the WBG have identified areas in which the limited 
IDA and IFC resources available and MIGA operations for Bolivia can achieve clear results. 
The WBG has strengthened its engagement with Bolivia in recent years, and implementing a 
CPS will permit the WBG to build on this partnership by moving to a more medium-term 
outlook in areas of comparative advantage. 

 Coordination with development partners: The WBG will continue to actively engage 
in donor coordination mechanisms and undertake joint operation work when appropriate 
notably with bilateral partners such as Brazil, Denmark, Japan, Netherlands, Switzerland 
and the UK and multilaterals such as the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB) and 
the UN system. Consultation with other donors active in Bolivia informed proposed 
portfolio design to avoid duplication of efforts and promote synergies with other ongoing 
and future development projects. 

33. 
Building on these principles, the strategy will support a program of new lending 
operations and knowledge activities in prioritized areas. The WBG’s program will 
concentrate in four results areas: (i) sustainable productive development, (ii) climate change and 
disaster risk management, (iii) human development and access to basic services, and (iv) public 
sector effectiveness. Two cross cutting themes that will be mainstreamed in all Bank activities 
under each of these results areas are: (i) gender and (ii) governance and anti-corruption. Results 
areas and themes support Government initiatives under the NDP’s pillars of Bolivia Productiva, 
Bolivia Digna and Bolivia Democrática y Participativa, and complement the priorities outlined 
in the updated 2010-2015 Government Plan. The program will be initially financed through IDA 
resources, with a possible transition to financing from IBRD to be considered at the midpoint of 
the strategy.  

34. 
This four-year CPS period may 
involve a transition from IDA to IBRD. 
Bolivia has been a blend country since FY01. 
In 2006 its GNI per capita started to move 
decisively above the IDA operational cut-off 
(Figure 1). The Government submitted a 
formal request to move to IBRD lending; this 
request will be formally assessed at the CPS 
midpoint. Until then, an indicative program 
for FY12-14 of SDRs 159.9 million 
(equivalent of US$ 257.2 million) under IDA 
16 has been agreed upon with 
the 
Government.

35. 
Flexibility and simplified operation modalities are built into the CPS to reduce 
implementation obstacles and accelerate execution. The strategy provides flexibility to adjust 
the lending program if the situation merits, for instance to respond to shocks such as sudden 
commodity price shifts or natural disasters. The Government and the Bank agreed to move the 
pipeline towards fewer but larger operations in order to maximize the development impact while 
containing transaction costs for both parties, in line with recommendations from portfolio 
performance reviews and the 2005 Country Assistance Evaluation. In addition, greater attention 

11 

 
 
will be placed on implementation and institutional aspects, avoiding complex arrangements to 
speed up execution. 

36. 
In tandem with the Bank’s approach, IFC will continue supporting Bolivia with a 
strategy that focuses on viable, high-impact private sector-led projects complemented by 
strategic advisory services On the investment side, IFC will maintain its focus on clients with 
sustainable business models that have demonstrated strong past performance and operate 
efficiently within regulatory frameworks mandated by Bolivia’s new Constitution. This includes 
projects primarily in financial markets—small and medium enterprise (SME) banking, 
microfinance and trade finance—agribusiness and forestry, but could also expand to other 
sectors should a conducive environment be in place. As part of its advisory work, IFC will 
continue its work to improve the investment climate by simplifying procedures at the municipal 
and possibly national level, and provide training to SMEs through its business advisory pillar.  

37. 
The proposed strategy will also support the development of a flexible program of 
AAA and convening services tailored to the Government’s needs. An indicative set of non-
lending activities has been defined for FY12, but will be kept open and flexible for the other 
years to ensure that the program can respond to the requirements that emerge during the 
implementation of the CPS. A package of capacity building and knowledge activities would be 
provided to prepare the country for the potential transition to IBRD financing in strategic areas 
such as public debt management. To complement this work, IFC advisory services could provide 
technical assistance and capacity building in investment climate, access to finance, and 
strengthening local royalty management through strategic community investment programs 
(Table 7).  

Cross Cutting Theme 1: Gender 
Main Challenges 

38. 
Bolivian women face multiple challenges, in particular unequal access to productive 
and economic resources and high levels of poverty. Women continue to be mainly employed 
in the informal sector, they face difficulties accessing credit and female wages are lower than 
male ones for similar jobs, according to the 2008 World Bank study “Towards Gender Equity in 
the Economy”. In the cities of El Alto and La Paz, as much as 70 percent of young mothers live 
in poverty, and the majority of those who participate in the labor market are in the informal 
sector. Informal labor often exposes young mothers and their children to accidents, violence, 
abuse and abandonment. Despite gains following the 1996 Land Reform Act, cultural prejudices 
still limit women’s access to land and property titling. Huge data gaps exist regarding poverty, 
inequality and economic development among women that need to be filled in order to ensure that 
gender equality policies can be effective. Preliminary findings from a Bank gender study 
highlights the need to target information and training to rural women, considering their lower 
education and the fact that domestic responsibilities restrict them from participating in 
community capacity building.  

39. Gender indicators in Bolivia are mixed relative to LAC and other lower-middle 
income countries. Bolivia has greater female labor force participation and political participation 
than the average for the region and for lower-middle income countries (Figure 2). It does better 
on average than lower-middle income countries in births attended by skilled health staff and in 

12 

 
the ratio of female to male secondary enrollment, but its performance is worse than the regional 
average. The indicators reveal that more needs to be done to raise contraceptive prevalence and 
lower adolescent fertility, where Bolivia lags. 

40. 
Violence 
against 
women 
remains high and requires greater 
attention. According 
to 
the 2008 
National Demographic 
and Health 
Survey (ENDSA), 38 percent of married 
women reported having been victim of 
psychological violence in the 12 months 
prior to the survey and 24 percent 
reported physical or sexual violence.

Bolivia has taken 
important 
steps to promote equal access to 
human 
capital 
development 
opportunities and to give men and 
women equal status and protection. The new Constitution and sector legislation guarantee 
equal rights and access to social services for men and women. Education enrollment and 
completion rates are almost equal for girls and boys; recent policies aim to improve health and 
nutrition services for pregnant women and small children. In 2008 the Government launched the 
National Plan for the Equality of Opportunities, including policies to favor women in six broad 
areas: (i) economic activity; (ii) education; (iii) health; (iv) violence; (v) institutional 
strengthening and(vi) participation in decision-making. Women now represent almost half of the 
ministerial cabinet, more than 40 percent of municipal councils and 36 percent of the Legislative 
Assembly.  

Areas of WBG Support 

42. Gender will be mainstreamed into the WBG’s portfolio guided by the Regional 
Gender Action Plan FY12-FY14 (RGAP) and the findings of the World Development 
Report (WDR) 2012. The LAC RGAP outlines a strategy for the Bank to work more effectively 
to help client countries identify, understand and address gender issues that constrain 
development. In line with the RGAP and WDR 2012, the Bank will determine strategic 
engagements, attempt to assign resources within each new project to address gender issues, take 
advantage of trust funds to promote a more gender sensitive program, document best practices on 
gender mainstreaming and enhance gender monitoring and evaluation systems. The preparation 
of this CPS benefitted from consultations with women’s organizations that validated the areas 
identified and the gender approach taken. While a large portion of the current portfolio already 
focuses on gender issues, further efforts will be made to ensure that engagement not only sees 
women as beneficiaries, but also attempts to measure and address structural gender challenges.  

13 

 
 
43. 
The ongoing and proposed portfolio on human development and access to basic 
services incorporates a strong gender focus. The Expanding Access to Reduce Health 
Inequalities APL III Project focuses on improving the health of mothers and children through 
culturally-sensitive service provision, while the Investing in Children and Youth Project aims to 
reduce chronic malnutrition in rural children through conditional cash transfer (CCT) to pregnant 
women and mothers of children under two. The youth employment component provides an 
additional financial incentive to promote the insertion of young mothers in the labor market. 
Complementing this project, the Japanese Social Development Fund (JSDF) trust fund will be 
used to reduce childcare constraints for unemployed or precariously employed young mothers by 
improving 149 existing childcare centers in El Alto and La Paz. The ongoing Urban 
Infrastructure Project involves women throughout the preparation, implementation and decision-
making stages, enabling the project to identify and address gender-based constraints and needs 
(Box 1). Women’s economic and domestic activities are most affected by lack of basic services 
such as electricity and water supply and sanitation. The proposed Water and Sanitation in Rural 
Areas Project and Decentralized Infrastructure for Rural Transformation II Project are expected 
to improve the living conditions of women. 

44. 
In collaboration with other donor agencies, the Bank will assist in addressing the 
prevalence of violence against women. The Bank is a member of the Group of Partners for the 
Development of Bolivia (GruS) gender subgroup, which is currently focusing on violence 
against women. The Bank will continue participating in this group and will incorporate measures 
to reduce violence against women into projects and other operations where it can. For example, 
the Urban Infrastructure Project installed streetlights in marginal urban areas, which have 
reduced the number of crimes against women. 

Box 1: Urban Infrastructure, Component on Urban Upgrading in La Paz 

In supporting Bolivia’s Barrios de Verdad project, Bank financing has helped to achieve 
sustainable improvements in the urban infrastructure and living standards in some of the poorest 
neighborhoods of La Paz. Living conditions have improved particularly for women and girls, as 
their exposure to violence has reduced and their opportunities for equality increased: 
 The installation of indoor sanitation facilities and street lighting improves pedestrian mobility 
and women’s security. 
 Childcare facilities, community and recreation centers enhance women’s economic 
opportunities, allowing them to engage in productive activities outside the home.  
 Ensuring that women have land titles and assets increases their social status and provides 
them with access to formal banking systems. 

45. 
Emphasis will be placed on integrating gender into the sustainable productive 
development and the climate change and disaster risk management areas to improve equal 
access to productive and economic resources. The Community Investment in Rural Areas 
Project has a strong gender focus, separating resources for investments identified by women. 
The Land for Agricultural Development Project has also been gender targeted. The Bank is 
making use of a Gender Action Plan (GAP) trust fund to gather gender information and generate 
new knowledge on gender roles in rural Bolivia to guide the inclusion of gender in both the 
climate change and disaster risk management and the sustainable productive development areas 

14 

 
 
of the CPS. Wherever feasible, IFC investment and advisory projects will also seek to actively 
include and benefit women, particularly in rural and peri-urban areas. 
46. 
The Bank will assist the Government in addressing the lack of gender-specific data. 
Through the census and household surveys in the Strengthening Statistical Capacity and the

Informational Base for Evidence-Based Planning Project (STATCAP), accurate up-to-date 
information will become available, allowing for sex-disaggregated data. This will serve to better

Government Strategy 

48. 
Various initiatives exist to promote better governance and to fight corruption. The 
2009 Constitution establishes key principles with respect to transparency, access to information 
and anti-corruption measures. As a result, the Ministry of Institutional Transparency and Fight 
against Corruption was created, a national policy on transparency and anti-corruption was 
approved and the Law to Fight Corruption, Illegal Enrichment and Fortune Investigation was 
passed. This law includes heavy penalties for corrupt contractors and civil servants, reinforces 
the already mandatory declaration of assets for all public officials and establishes retroactivity 
for corruption cases.  

Areas of WBG Support 

49. 
The WBG is working closely with authorities to help move forward the ambitious 
governance, transparency and anti-corruption agenda. The Bank is continuing to assist 
Bolivia’s efforts against corruption under the Stolen Asset Recovery (StAR) initiative, a 
cooperation begun in 2009 with the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) (Box 
2). The Government has expressed interest in reforming the national procurement system, and 

15 

 
 
 
the Bank has indicated its willingness to undertake joint technical assistance with the IADB to 
develop and implement a national procurement strategy. Technical assistance is being considered 
for the institutional framework for tackling corruption, including the Ministry of Institutional 
Transparency and Fight against Corruption. 

50. 
Bolivian authorities have shown a commitment toward greater transparency and 
social oversight to reduce corruption and improve governance, and the WBG is supporting 
this agenda throughout its activities. All projects under the proposed CPS will include 
transparency mechanisms and institutional strengthening measures, and will assess incorporating 
a strategy for corruption risk mitigation. The Bank has begun using social oversight 
mechanisms—including in the Urban Infrastructure Project and the Participatory Rural 
Investment II Project—and will scale up these practices to encourage accountability and 
transparency. Furthermore, the Government has expressed interest in participating in the Open 
Data Initiative and the WBG Access to Information Policy. The WBG is also following the 
Government’s lead regarding greater access to information for civil society. Not only is the 
WBG making more project information available, but it is actively seeking new ways to 
disseminate information via traditional and new media and participation in public events.  

Box 2: Stolen Asset Recovery Initiative (StAR) 

StAR is a partnership between UNODC and the World Bank providing technical assistance for 
international asset recovery. Bolivia requested StAR assistance in 2009. With StAR support, an 
inter-institutional working group (GIRA) was created to coordinate the identification, 
investigation and prosecution of cases. Bolivia has also requested financing for projects related 
to witness protection legislation and in the verification of asset disclosures. 

The witness protection program is managed by UNODC. The asset disclosure program is 
followed by the Bank and has two components: (i) prioritizing asset disclosures to be verified, 
and (ii) launching a pilot program for verification. Both components are already in advanced 
stages. On the Bank side, Financial Market Integrity (FPDFI) and Transparency and 
Accountability (FPDTA) are the main providers of StAR assistance. 
Results Area 1: Sustainable Productive Development 
Main Challenges 

51. One of Bolivia’s key development challenges continues to be generating dynamic 
economic activity to address the country’s high rates of poverty, especially in rural and 
peri-urban areas. As stated in the WDR 2008, the agricultural sector is essential to growth, 
poverty reduction and food security. However, agriculture yields in Bolivia are substantially 
lower than in its neighboring countries, partially due to inferior technology, weak institutions 
dealing with agricultural innovation and limited irrigation areas. Income generation for rural 
producers, in particular women, is often constrained by limited access to land, insufficient 
market integration and difficult access to consumption markets. Despite recent advances, the 
incidence of moderate and extreme poverty in rural areas—especially among women—continues 
well above the already high national average. Public investment in rural development is still 
insufficient when compared to the needs of the sector. 

16 

 
 
 
52. 
Addressing infrastructure needs and promoting economic integration is critical for 
Bolivia’s development. Despite progress during the last decade, huge infrastructure gaps 
remain, in particular in transport and productive infrastructure at the decentralized and 
community levels. Precarious national and rural roads limit access to markets and constrain 
productive development. In addition to being a landlocked country, Bolivia’s difficult 
topographical and geological conditions make infrastructure development expensive and 
challenging. Airports have limited facilities and lack basic safety and security equipment, 
impeding regional development and touristic activity. Poor rural communities lack basic 
infrastructure which, compounded by a lack of coordination among different government levels, 
constrains the provision of productive services such as irrigation. 

53. 
The country’s labor-intensive SME sector requires development support, in 
particular access to finance. SMEs represent over 90 percent of total enterprises in Bolivia, 
employing around 70 percent of the labor force. However, their productivity is very low—in 
particular for those firms managed by women—and they face severe obstacles to development, 
including low access to productive credit, a heavy regulatory and tax burden and insufficient 
vertical and horizontal integration. These limitations reduce the growth potential of the country 
as a whole. 

Government Strategy 

54. 
The Government has laid out a wide-ranging strategy for generating more 
productive opportunities in the Bolivia Productiva pillar of the NDP, with a strong 
emphasis on rural development and the SME sector. The plan proposes agriculture 
transformation to reduce rural poverty and ensure food security, improving distribution of and 
access to land, improving farmers’ access to markets and providing better productive equipment 
and infrastructure. This transformation envisions improving innovation systems to spur 
agricultural productivity and the sustainability of small farmers. The Government also highlights 
that local productive equipment and infrastructure is key for improving agricultural productivity, 
requiring coordination with and the participation of sub-national governorates as well as 
communities and producer organizations.  

55. One of the key goals of Bolivia Productiva is developing transport infrastructure. 
The Government believes that the country requires better transport links to enhance the 
development of regions outside the main road axis and in specific productive sectors, including 
agriculture, mining and tourism. The Government plans to improve or build several roads to 
improve integration with neighboring countries and offer greater export opportunities to isolated 
regions, such as the northern region of La Paz where it is promoting an agro-industrial complex. 
The Government also intends to build or upgrade several airports to promote economic activities. 

56. 
The development of productive SMEs is critical in the NDP’s efforts to diversify the 
economy and boost employment. The Government aims to provide comprehensive support to 
labor-intensive sectors, in particular SMEs. The Government implemented the second-tier 
Productive Development Bank to provide low interest credit to producers in prioritized sectors 
that have limited access to other financial sources. It is also building an institutional development 
framework to improve small producers’ access to local and foreign markets, provide them with 

17 

 
technical assistance and training, promote productive clusters and lift other constrains for 
growth. 

Areas of WBG Support 

57. 
Responding to pressing development needs and Government objectives, the WBG 
will support upgrading sustainable agricultural productivity. The Bank will continue 
assistance to the agricultural sector through the ongoing Rural Alliances Project and the 
proposed Rural Alliances II Project, which promote access to markets. The recently approved 
Agricultural Innovation and Services Project is expected to contribute to the availability of 
improved technologies and other innovations and enhance productivity growth, food security and 
the income-earning potential of Bolivian families dependent on agriculture and forestry. The 
Land for Agricultural Development Project will continue promoting land access for small 
farmers, with a special focus on women. The Participatory Rural Investment II Project enhances 
productivity through the provision of technical assistance accompanied by local infrastructure 
investments. The proposed Integrated Community-Driven Territorial Development for Remote 
Communities in the Amazon trust fund will promote environmentally sustainable land use 
planning and production, working specifically with women’s organizations.  

58. 
The IFC will finance private initiatives in sustainable agribusiness and forestry. In 
the agribusiness sector, IFC expects to remain focused on export-oriented clients able to add 
value to locally produced raw materials as well as generate or preserve jobs in rural areas in a 
sustainable manner. It also hopes to extend its agribusiness activities into new areas such as 
forestry and begin working with new partners such as cooperatives and indigenous groups on 
projects that are both environmentally and economically sustainable, as is the case with the 
Empresa Forestal SLV operation approved in FY11. In addition, IFC is backing a regional 
Responsive Soy program to improve crop productivity and the sales of small and medium 
soybean farmers, and promoting the adoption of environmental and social standards to increase 
the acreage of sustainably managed land. 

59. 
The WBG will continue to promote the economic integration of the country through 
the provision of transportation infrastructure. The Bank will support the development of 
northern Bolivia through the ongoing National Roads and Airport Infrastructure Project, which 
will improve the year-round transit on the San Buenaventura-Ixiamas national road and the 
safety and reliability of the Rurrenabaque Airport. The airport renovation will allow economic 
expansion by facilitating access for higher-income tourism and ecotourism. IFC will be attentive 
to opportunities for private sector participation in infrastructure projects under a conducive 
regulatory framework. This includes potential opportunities in public private partnership (PPP) 
operations on both the investment and structuring side, should there be a demand from the public 
and private sectors for such support. 

60. 
During the CPS timeframe, improving access to productive infrastructure in rural 
areas will be a priority. The Bank is bolstering access to sustainable basic infrastructure and 
services through the recently approved Community Investments in Rural Areas Project through 
which empowered rural communities will identify, prepare, implement and maintain small 
development sub-projects that respond to their priority needs; providing special attention and 
priority to projects benefiting women. The Participatory Rural Investment II Project is scaling 

18 

 
up institutional arrangements between national, departmental and municipal governments and 
civil society for the sustainable management of sub-national public investment in selected 
productive sectors. In addition, the Lake Titicaca Local Sustainable Development Project 
supports the provision of tourism infrastructure. 

61. 
The WBG will foster greater private sector activity, especially among job-creating 
SMEs. The IFC stands ready to widen the range of advisory services it provides to clients in 
Bolivia, such as continuing deployment of its Business Edge SME training program and business 
licensing/permit simplification at the sub-national level. Should the opportunity arise, IFC could 
provide technical assistance as well as investment support for mining and other extractive 
industries activities. Critical areas of support could be environmental and social aspects as well 
as revenue management related to royalties and taxes. To promote access to credit, IFC expects 
to continue focusing on opportunities for SME lending and risk management with banks, and 
fostering further innovation in Bolivia's microfinance sector. The Bank is providing advice on 
access to finance for SMEs through the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) jointly 
prepared with the IMF, and the Financial Sector Review. The Bank remains open to include 
future activities geared toward SME promotion and development. 

62. MIGA has recently received preliminary inquiries by investors and will proceed 
once a strong developmental case can be built and efforts are judged to be complementary 
to broader WBG engagement. At present MIGA has no outstanding contract of guarantees in 
Bolivia. The latest contract in Bolivia covered an equity investment by the Banco de Crédito del 
Peru into its subsidiary in Bolivia; it expired in FY10 at the termination of the contract. MIGA 
has received preliminary inquiries by investors with interests in the financial, infrastructure and 
oil and gas sectors in Bolivia. These inquiries are still at a very early stage and the financing 
arrangements are not yet in place. After years of little activity and many institutional changes in 
the country, there is a need to reach out and explain how MIGA can support Bolivia.  

Results Area 2: Climate Change and Disaster Risk Management 
Main Challenges 

63. 
Improving the capacity for disaster risk management and promoting adaptation to 
climate change are critical challenges for Bolivia. The country is highly vulnerable to natural 
disasters and climate change phenomena such as floods, droughts and glacier retreat, which in 
turn affect water supply, water management, irrigation systems, hydropower generation and 
transportation infrastructure. The impacts on sustainable productive development as well as on 
living conditions for both rural and urban poor can be considerable, as La Niña and El Niño 
weather events have demonstrated. Improving sustainable land and water resource management 
as well as reducing pollution should complement climate change adaptation efforts to ensure 
long-term impact. 

Government Strategy 

64. 
The Government has taken an active role in addressing the risks inherent in 
Bolivia’s vulnerability to natural disasters and climate change. Sector plans on risk 
management are in place in agriculture and water and health, among others, as well as 
contingency plans for events such as droughts, flooding and fires. The Government is currently 

19 

 
 
working on a National Program for Risk Management that will identify strategies and actions to 
mitigate impacts of and respond to natural disasters. Sector programs under the framework of the 
National Mechanism for the Adaptation to Climate Change promote actions for climate change 
adaptation and develop capacities to mitigate risks associated with climate change. Watershed 
management has been identified as a way to introduce a multi-sector climate change approach at 
the local and regional level. 

Areas of WBG Support 

65. 
The Bank is supporting natural disaster and climate change management with a 
mix of project lending, trust fund interventions and AAA. During the CPS period, the 
ongoing Emergency Recovery and Disaster Management Project will continue restoring access 
to basic infrastructure damaged by El Niño and La Niña phenomena, and strengthening the 
Government’s ability to respond to natural disasters. The Bank will continue assisting Bolivia’s 
efforts to adapt to climate change in prioritized sectors through mechanisms such as the two 
phases of the Pilot Program for Climate Resilience (PPCR), which are expected to play a 
strategic role in integrating climate resilience at different levels of governance mainly in the 
water sector and disaster risk management (Box 3). The program will be gender-informed and 
emphasize the collection of gender-disaggregated data. The ongoing trust fund on Rapid Glacier 
Retreat in the Tropical Andes (PRAA), funded by the Global Environment Facility (GEF) and 
other donors, is expected to provide important inputs to the PPCR. In coordination with the 
Government, the Bank will continue looking for trust fund opportunities to strengthen the CPS in 
these areas. Financed by the GAP trust fund, a forthcoming gender study investigating the 
changing gender role in natural resource management and gender-differentiated vulnerabilities to 
climate change is being finalized. Currently the Bank is implementing the Strengthening 
Environmental Management and Institutions NLTA to generate knowledge in the areas of 
mining pollution in watersheds, solid waste management and environmental health. The 
Reducing Risk for Biodiversity Conservation Using Adaptive Fire Management, financed by the 
Development Marketplace (2009), aims to reduce forest fires in a climate change context. 

Box 3: The Pilot Program on Climate Resilience (PPCR) in Bolivia 

The PPCR pilots ways to integrate climate risk and resilience into development planning. Funded 
and managed by the Climate Investment Funds (CIF), it is operated jointly by the Bank and 
IADB and has two phases. Phase I aims to strengthen climate information systems, to 
mainstream climate change resilience in public sector management and to prepare a climate 
resilient investment program for Phase II. 

Phase II will address climate change through a participative and integrated approach to river 
basin management and will include two investment projects: (i) climate resilience of urban water 
supply in La Paz and El Alto; and (ii) climate resilience in the Rio Grande Watershed. Technical 
assistance will also further strengthen Government capacities to pursue climate-resilient 
development and to extend the lessons from the PPCR to other investments, mainly through the 
improvement of the national planning and investment systems.

Results Area 3: Human Development and Access to Basic Services 
Main Challenges 

66. 
As one of the poorest countries in the hemisphere, Bolivia faces tremendous human 
development deficits, due in part to the limited access to social services and safety nets. 
Child and maternal mortality rates as well as adolescent fertility rates are high in comparison to 
other countries in the LAC region and to other lower-middle income countries and disparities in 
health outcomes between rural and urban areas and between different income groups remain 
significant. Chronic malnutrition affects one out of five children under three nationally and one 
out of three children in rural areas (2008). Bolivia has high net primary enrollment rates, but 
completion rates are low. Secondary education is characterized by low enrollment and high 
repetition and dropout rates, due largely to the opportunity cost of schooling and supply 
shortages. Generations of young have migrated to urban and peri-urban areas in the pursuit of 
better opportunities for income generation. However, the open unemployment rate for youth 15-
24 years old was almost 12 percent in 2007, three times that of the general population. More than 
90 percent of the young are employed in the informal sector. The process of urbanization has 
also been accompanied by the disintegration of informal safety nets and the emergence of 
problems such as the abandonment of children.

67. 
Increasing access to basic services 
is critical to improve the living conditions 
of the most vulnerable sectors of the 
population, in particular those living in 
rural areas. Large parts of 
the rural 
population in Bolivia live in remote areas 
and do not have access to basic services 
such as electricity, drinking water and 
sanitation. Indigenous people, who represent 
the vast majority of the rural population, are 
disproportionately affected by the uneven 
distribution and poor quality of basic 
infrastructure. The 
rural population 
is 
comparatively dispersed and unconnected, 
leaving 
communities 
in 
considerable 
isolation. Although coverage of rural basic services and infrastructure has increased significantly 
in recent years, it remains low due in part to high costs. Only half of the population in rural areas 
has access to water and 37 percent to improved sanitation services (Figure 4). The rapid 
urbanization process of the last two decades has generated additional challenges. As cities grow, 
the cost of meeting basic needs increases and cities struggle to meet service demands, especially 
in marginal peri-urban areas where the majority of poor urban dwellers live.

Government Strategy 

68. 
The Government has demonstrated a strong commitment to improve access to social 
services such as health, education and youth employment programs. The Government 
proposes a universal health care insurance system and a comprehensive plan of medical 

21 

 
 
infrastructure and equipment. Special attention will be placed on promoting the use of health 
services by mothers and children in rural and indigenous areas. The ongoing CCT Bono Juana 
Azurduy promotes the use of health services by pregnant women and children under two to 
reduce chronic malnutrition and infant and maternal mortality. In terms of education, the 
Government is working towards expanding coverage and improving the quality of service. 
Additional reforms call for universal and free education and day care, giving prominence to early 
childhood development. In youth employment, the Government seeks to facilitate the insertion of 
young workers into the labor market.  

69. 
The expansion of basic services, such as electricity, water and sanitation, is seen as a 
basic human right. In terms of energy, the Government proposes to increase the coverage of 
electricity in rural areas and peri-urban areas through the use of renewable energy sources. For 
water and sanitation, the Government’s priority is to expand rural and peri-urban coverage for 
consumption and irrigation. The National Plan for Basic Sanitation 2009-2015 seeks to extend 
the provision of sustainable services and strengthen public, cooperative and community service 
providers. The Government’s goal is to increase the coverage of drinking water services to 90 
percent and sanitation services to 80 percent by 2015.  

Areas of WBG Support 

70. 
The Bank will continue supporting improved access to and quality of health 
services. The ongoing Expanding Access to Reduce Health Inequalities Project aims at 
enhancing maternal and infant health in targeted areas so that the current gaps between regions 
and chronic malnutrition among children under two years of age are reduced and health 
insurance coverage is increased. The Investing in Children and Youth Project is reinforcing the 
objectives of reducing chronic malnutrition and improving women’s health during pregnancy in 
rural areas by supporting the implementation of the Bono Juana Azurduy CCT. 

71. 
The Bank will also provide assistance to the education sector as well as to the youth 
employment generation policies and childcare initiatives. The ongoing Secondary Education 
Transformation Project is designed to help increase access to quality primary and secondary 
education in La Paz. The Investing in Children and Youth Project has a component supporting 
Mi Primer Empleo Digno, which is improving the employability of low-income youth via 
vocational in-class training session and internships in private sector firms. This program 
encourages the participation of young mothers by providing a greater stipend. A proposed 
operation under the Japanese Social Development Fund (JSDF) will pilot culturally appropriate 
early childcare in vulnerable urban municipalities. At the Government’s request, the Bank will 
continue providing technical assistance related to its social protection initiatives through the 
ongoing programmatic Social Safety Net NLTA and the proposed Social Protection Beneficiaries 
Registry NLTA. Possible technical assistance in education is also being discussed. 

72. 
A human development project has been programmed to respond to emerging needs 
in this area. The Government has requested that the Bank maintain flexibility to respond to 
emerging needs in the human development sector. As such, the CPS is proposing a human 
development project that will be defined in the future. 

22 

 
73. 
Expanding access to basic services will continue to be a priority. In electricity, the 
GPOBA on Decentralized Electricity for Universal Access is financing the installation of solar 
power in rural areas and the proposed Decentralized Infrastructure for Rural Transformation II 
will expand sustainable rural electricity coverage with diversified options, primarily through 
renewable energy. The ongoing Lake Titicaca Local Sustainable Development Project and the 
Community Investments in Rural Areas Project will help expand water and basic sanitation 
services. The Water and Sanitation Program (WSP) will continue providing technical assistance 
and building capacity in key institutions to enhance the sustainability of investments in both 
urban and rural areas. In addition, the Government has requested the Bank’s assistance in 
developing a new water and sanitation project to improve coverage in rural or peri-urban areas. 
Building on the successful experience of the Urban Infrastructure Project, the CPS proposes the 
Urban Infrastructure II Project to continue urban upgrading, enhanced mobility and expanded 
sewerage coverage in urban areas. All of these operations are expected to have an important 
effect on the well-being of women, since they bear most of the burden caused by the lack of 
basic services. 

Results Area 4: Public Sector Effectiveness 
Main Challenges 

74. 
A key obstacle to development and poverty reduction in Bolivia is the limited 
effectiveness of the public sector. The lack of a clear legal framework based on the new 
Constitution makes coordination among different government 
levels difficult, creating 
disagreements over responsibilities and hampering the design and implementation of public 
policies, especially at the sub-national level. Capacity gaps constrain the central government’s 
ability to manage public policies.  Another key obstacle is the limited amount of timely, reliable 
data with which to design policies and measure results. The last Population and Housing Census 
was carried out in 2001 and the last Agriculture Census in 1984 and household surveys are not 
representative at the departmental level or in the main cities. These challenges create particular 
difficulties when trying to implement programs to address the complex problems of 
multidimensional welfare, for example gender, rural development or adaptation to climate 
change. 

Government Strategy 

75. 
The Government’s objective for this results area is to improve public sector 
efficiency. In July 2010 the Legislative Assembly passed the Law of Autonomies to enhance 
governability by increasing participation and decision-making at the local level. The involvement 
of the affected communities in the design, implementation and oversight of programs and 
projects is a key aspect of the NDP’s Bolivia Democrática y Participativa pillar, and is being 
mainstreamed throughout public sector interventions. The Government intends to pass legislation 
indigenous statutes will be approved and implemented. Aware of the importance of reliable data 
to address contentious issues such as the distribution of fiscal resources and other problems 
created when sub-national legal regulations do not concur with the Constitution, and how 
for public policy, the Government has decided to undertake two censuses and strengthen 
collection techniques and analysis methodologies.

Areas of WBG Support 

76. 
The WBG will continue supporting Bolivia’s decentralization process. The ongoing 
Participatory Rural Investment II Project calls for developing strategies and tools for the 
adequate implementation of the law as well as public policies to improve institutional and fiscal 
decentralization in the short, medium and long term. The Bank will also assist the 
implementation of autonomies through the ongoing programmatic Public Sector Governance 
NLTA that addresses a specific Government request on decentralized public investment. 
Additionally, some sub-national authorities have requested a Sub-National Public Expenditure 
and Financial Assessment (PEFA) to assess the financial management at the regional and 
municipal level. The Bank is also supporting the Government’s efforts to bring a more 
participatory approach to development through community involvement in several current 
projects such as the Urban Infrastructure Project and the Community Investments in Rural 
Areas. 

77. 
The Bank will continue providing technical assistance for key issues requested by 
the Government to strengthen management. Non-lending technical assistance will play a 
major role in the Bank’s relations with Bolivia, addressing capacity constraints that limit policy 
and program effectiveness. The Bank and Government are discussing possible technical 
assistance to address the lack of an independent procurement agency, with a view to maximizing 
the efficient use of limited fiscal resources. The proposed Report on the Observance of 
Standards and Codes (ROSC) in Auditing and Accounting will provide the Government and 
other interested parties with a comprehensive analysis of accounting and auditing standards in 
the public and private sectors. Through the StAR initiative, the international community has 
provided training to the Ministry of Transparency to increase its capacity in verifying assets 
declarations and recovering stolen assets hidden abroad.  

78. 
The informational base for a monitoring and evaluation system will be improved. 
The STATCAP Project is helping prepare the forthcoming Population and Housing Census and 
Agriculture Census as well as improving household surveys. These tools will provide critical 
data to guide decision-making on a wide array of public policies, including the allocation of 
resources to sub-national governments to more effectively implement new autonomy legislation. 
Complementing this activity, the proposed Ensuring Quality in the National Statistical System of 
Bolivia trust fund will help build capacity in the National Statistics Institute. Furthermore, the 
ongoing programmatic Multidimensional Poverty and the proposed Poverty Map Update and 
Poverty Assessment will provide a set of tools to better understand poverty and design public 
policies. 

C. Implementing the Partnership Strategy 

Financial Envelope 
79. 
The IDA16 indicative allocation for Bolivia is Special Drawing Rights (SDR) 159.9 
million for FY12-14. In accordance with IDA’s Performance-Based Allocation system, 
Bolivia’s indicative allocation for the FY12-14 period is SDR153.1 million in credits (equivalent 
to approximately US$246.3 million) and SDR6.8 million in hard term credits (equivalent to 

25 

 
 
approximately US$10.9 million). Two operations for US$79 million originally envisaged under 
the previous ISN have been approved under IDA 16. The allocation for FY12 is SDR56.5 
million (SDR2.6 million in hard terms), while the amounts for FY13 and FY14, SDR55.7 million 
(SDR2.4 million in hard terms) and SDR47.7 million (SDR6.8 million in hard terms) 
respectively, are indicative.2 The CPS proposes a frontloading of IDA resources in FY12 and 
FY13 in order to ensure continuity of ongoing projects that close during the first and second year 
of the CPS. This would be done in accordance with the implementation guidelines of the IDA16 
Resource Allocation Framework.  

80. 
IBRD lending to Bolivia may be envisaged after the midpoint of the CPS timeframe. 
Up to the CPS midpoint review, Bolivia would only access IDA financing. IBRD lending would 
be considered after the midpoint of the CPS timeframe and its phasing in would depend on: (i) 
the continuation of a sound macroeconomic environment, building on recent progress in this 
area, and (ii) progress in improving the investment climate as evidenced by an increase in private 
investment including increasing FDI inflows in connection to the large planned extractive 
industry projects that underpin growth under the Government’s medium term macroeconomic 
framework. Potential lending volumes may be determined at the midpoint of the CPS and will 
depend on IBRD’s lending capacity and demand from other borrowers. 

Managing Program Implementation 
81. 
The current portfolio comprises 13 investment projects for a total of US$444 
million, of which US$354 million remains undisbursed. Four projects, constituting a total of 
US$238 million, have been approved in calendar year 2011 and will soon start implementation, 
while three operations are expected to exit the portfolio in FY12. In addition, a recipient-
executed trust fund in renewable energy for US$5.2 million is expected to close in FY13. Eight 
trust funds for US$3.57 million were approved in FY11, two of them recipient-executed and the 
remaining Bank-executed. The approval and execution of grants will require particular attention, 
given the country’s poor record in the implementation of recipient-executed trust funds.  

82. 
The execution and quality of the portfolio have shown important improvements in 
recent years. The Bank will continue to work with the Government to consolidate these gains in 
portfolio performance. The disbursement ratio reached 23 percent in FY11, a significant increase 
compared to the 12 percent reached in FY08 and FY09. The percentage of projects at risk 
decreased from 45 in FY09-10 to 27 in FY11 and the realism index reached 100 percent. The 
Bank is working to improve the pro-activity index, currently at 50 percent and to support projects 
with implementation delays or those at risk of not achieving their development objectives 
(currently around one-third of the portfolio).  

2 Actual allocations will depend on: (i) Bolivia’s performance; (ii) its performance relative to that of other IDA 
recipients; (iii) the amount of overall IDA resources; (iv) changes in the list of active IDA-eligible countries; (v) 
terms of financial assistance provided (grants or loans); and (vi) the amount of compensatory resources received for 
MDRI. Since Bolivia’s per capita gross national income (GNI) has remained above the IDA operational cut off for 
more than three consecutive years, new terms will now apply for credits effective FY12. These will have a maturity 
of 25 years, with a five-year period of grace and a 1.25 percent per annum interest rate. For hard term credits the 
lending terms are 25 years of maturity with a five-year period of grace and an interest rate based on the IBRD fixed 
rate equivalent minus 200 basis points. In addition to the IDA16 indicative allocation, the MDRI will continue 
providing a notional equivalent of US$40 million per year in budget support. 

26 

                                                      
83. 
The Bank and the Government have been carrying out bi-annual Country Portfolio 
Performance Reviews (CPPRs) to address systemic issues affecting the pipeline and active 
portfolio, as well as project-specific issues. This exercise has proved successful in reaching 
clear agreements on milestones for projects under preparation. It has also helped to identify 
actions aimed at removing obstacles impeding smooth project execution. Frequent meetings with 
the Minister of Development Planning and officials from the Vice Ministry of Public Investment 
and External Financing also take place to further support implementation. During the CPS 
period, the Bank and the Government will continue these detailed revisions on a bi-annual basis 
or even increase the frequency if the situation calls for greater attention.  

84. Greater attention to implementation and institutional capacity as well as to the 
adequate assessment of risks is required to maintain project execution and improve 
development effectiveness. Close supervision is critical in a context of generally weak technical 
capacity and institutional changes in Government counterparts. Capacity building has not always 
been sustainable given the high levels of staff turnover in executing entities. Thus, technical and 
fiduciary teams need to continue providing day-to-day guidance to counterparts. Early and 
complete assessments of risks and identification of mitigation measures are also required to 
promote a smooth implementation. Tools such as the ORAF are helping to address these 
challenges. Improvements are taking place, as evidenced by portfolio indicators such as the 
increase in the disbursement ratio, the drop in the percentage of projects at risk and a recent 
Operations Policy and Country Services (OPCS) review of the country portfolio, but there is still 
much room to improve development effectiveness. 

Fiduciary Aspects and Use of Country Systems 
85. 
Important steps have been taken towards strengthening public financial 
management (PFM) systems in Bolivia, though some weaknesses persist. In 2009 the Bank 
and IADB jointly carried out a PFM assessment following the PEFA framework. The assessment 
showed that important steps have been taken towards enhancing PFM systems in Bolivia, mainly 
in relation to expanding the integrated financial management system (SIGMA) both at the central 
and sub-national level, implementing a well-functioning Treasury Single Account, and 
improving treasury-related functions including debt management. However, budget formulation 
and execution still have weaknesses related to internal control and audit functions as well as 
limited legislative scrutiny over budget bills. Following the PEFA results, the Government 
designed an action plan, which in its first stage is focusing on enhancing revenue-generating 
functions (customs and taxation offices).  

86. 
The Bank will continue to increase its reliance on country systems. The steps taken 
by the Government to upgrade PFM systems have allowed the Bank to increase reliance on 
country systems, and the current portfolio relies widely on existing arrangements related to 
budgeting, accounting, internal processes and procedures through the use of SIGMA and 
Treasury Single Account for fund flow arrangements. Those arrangements are strengthened or 
supplemented only when the nature of a project calls for it, mainly in relation to financial 
reporting and auditing. During the current CPS program, the Bank will continue seeking 
opportunities to deepen the use of country systems, agreeing on certain strengthening measures 
at the institutional or sector level. Given the importance of good quality financial reporting, an 
accounting and auditing ROSC will be carried out as part of the current strategy. In terms of 

27 

procurement, the Government intends to push a reform of the national procurement system. If 
there is interest, the Bank will continue working with the IADB in supporting the application of 
the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development’s Development Assistance 
Committee (OECD-DAC) methodology for assessing the quality and effectiveness of the 
procurement system and in developing and implementing a national procurement strategy. 

Results Orientation and Monitoring 
87. 
A results matrix will track the implementation of the Bank’s program and its 
impact on country development goals. Most of the results will be delivered from projects 
under implementation. Thus, the results matrix (Annex 1) is largely composed of ongoing 
projects for which impact indicators should be available by the end of the proposed strategy. 
New operations will span beyond the CPS period and their final outcomes will materialize in the 
future. However, their expected outcomes have been included in the results matrix. The matrix is 
organized around the results areas of the proposed program and is mainly based on the results 
framework of each individual operation, including a strengthened focus on gender. The 
Government’s NDP establishes the vision and strategic orientation for achieving the country’s 
development objectives, but specifies few development outcomes and indicators. Therefore, 
higher-level results were taken from the Government’s intention to achieve the MDGs and sector 
strategies. The matrix also includes the expected outcomes of the most relevant trust funds. The 
results framework will be updated in the CPS Progress Report to reflect progress in achieving 
goals and to incorporate the results proposed by the operations that will be approved in the next 
two years.  

88. Over the CPS timeframe the Bank will support the Government in strengthening its 
capacity for results-based management. Through the implementation of the STATCAP Project 
the Bank will be better positioned to support the Government build institutional capacity for 
results-based management. The project will also help improve the Government’s informational 
base of reliable, timely, accurate and representative information. Information generated through 
the Population and Housing and Agricultural Censuses will permit tracking some development 
outcomes and assessing core indicators.  

Partnerships and Donor Coordination 
89. 
The streamlined coordination of official 
development aid (ODA) and other financing is 
critical to achieve the objectives set out in the 
Government’s NDP. Although most public 
investment 
is now 
financed with domestic 
resources—72 percent in 2009 compared to 37 
percent in 2005—ODA and other financing remain 
important to implement the NDP. The largest 
development partners measured by commitments 
are the Andean Development Corporation (CAF), 
IADB, the World Bank, Brazil, China and the 
European Union (EU), comprising about three-
quarters of the total (Figure 4 and Annex 4). ODA 
directed towards the health and education sectors

has been reduced considerably over the last decade, while ODA to the transport sector has 
increased substantially. 

90. While some traditional donors are phasing out of Bolivia, a number of new ones are 
increasing their commitments. Whereas traditional donors such as Denmark, the Netherlands 
and the United Kingdom are either phasing out or have terminated their bilateral assistance to 
Bolivia, the Morales administration is making use of new sources of funding and technical 
assistance to implement its ambitious program, including Brazil, Colombia, China, Russia, South 
Korea and Venezuela. The new donors form a highly diverse group and provide a new dynamic 
to the different types of financial support and technical expertise when compared to traditional 
donors. South-South cooperation has become increasingly important for the Government. The 
Bank has provided valuable technical assistance through the South-South Experience Exchange 
Trust Fund on multidimensional poverty, cash transfer programs and education. 

91. 
The Bank makes a special effort to coordinate with other development partners. The 
GruS was established in late 2006 as a platform to better support the Government and its 
development agenda. Most traditional bilateral and multilateral development agencies are 
members of the GruS and many of them have aligned their assistance to the NDP and are 
working towards the implementation of the Paris Declaration and the Accra Action Plan. More 
recently, non-traditional partners such as Colombia, Korea and Brazil have expressed their 
interest in working more closely with the GruS. The Ministry of Development Planning is 
responsible for donor coordination and participates in GruS’s work. In addition, the Bank is an 
active member of the United Nations Country Team (UNCT). Consultations were carried out 
with the GruS and with local representatives of non-traditional donors such as China, Korea and 
Brazil as part of the design of this proposed CPS.  

Trust Fund Program and Strategy 
92. 
Trust funds are an important financing source for the Bank’s country program in 
Bolivia. Trust fund resources are used to support Bank policy dialogue and operations through 
co-financing and background analytical work, and also play an important role in knowledge 
transfers through South-South capacity building activities. The recent work on CCT and rural 
development in the context of the South-South trust fund are good examples of activities 
supported by trust funds. Trust funds also help pilot innovative ideas such as the JSDF Trust 
Fund on Early Childhood Care and Development and Gender. Trust funds can thus help to 
leverage Bank resources further and are used as a unique platform for donors to strengthen 
partnerships and cross-fertilization.  

93. 
Implementation of the WBG trust fund portfolio has been effective, but there is 
room for improvement. These include more strategic alignment and realistic assessment of the 
capacity and time needed for implementation and achievement of results. Selection criteria have 
been developed and will be applied to trust funds more systematically by the Bank’s team. 

29 

A. Political Risks 

IV. MANAGING RISKS 

94. 
Social demands to change specific public policies or projects could escalate, delaying 
implementation of the NDP. Social organizations, including some indigenous groups, have 
started to mobilize seeking public policy changes. Unable to channel their dissatisfaction with 
specific policies through formal institutions, these groups are moving their agenda forward 
through protests and demonstrations. Discontent may spread and intensify if the Morales 
administration fails to build consensus with dissenting social groups and create common ground 
to face policy implementation challenges. Furthermore, the process of aligning the legal 
framework and institutions to the new Constitution could create short-term uncertainty and delay 
the implementation of public policies.  

95. 
The Bank is working to mitigate these risks through the selective, targeted nature of 
interventions proposed under the CPS. The focus of CPS activities—sustainable productive 
development, adaptation to climate change and disaster risk management, access to basic and 
social services for the rural and urban poor, and support for public sector effectiveness—are 
supported by Bolivian society of all political inclinations, as validated during the extensive CPS 
consultation process. Hence these projects are unlikely to suffer setbacks from potential political 
turmoil, and positive project outcomes could work toward reducing some of the causes of social 
tensions and protest. Furthermore, Bank-provided technical and financial assistance on 
decentralization and autonomy legislation, statistical capacity and anti-corruption measures will 
help strengthen governance in Bolivia. 

B. Economic Risks 

96. 
Despite strong recent economic performance and macroeconomic policy, Bolivia is 
vulnerable to a number of short- and medium-term risks. If the global economy recovers, 
inflation may rise due to higher international food prices and foreign exchange inflows, while the 
competitiveness of labor-intensive, non-traditional exports may be affected by exchange rate 
appreciation. On the other hand, lower commodity prices and lower gas export volumes to Brazil 
may erode the strong fiscal and external accounts. The nationalization process and the ongoing 
reform of the legal framework are affecting the investment climate and potentially reducing 
medium-term growth prospects. The hydrocarbons, mining and electricity sectors are close to 
operating at maximum capacity and few large investment projects have taken place in the last 
years. Additional private and public investment is needed to maintain Bolivia’s good 
macroeconomic performance. Public investment is currently hampered by capacity constraints, 
but if the public sector executes its ambitious pipeline investments, the Central Bank’s capacity 
to control inflation may be undermined. Private activities may also be affected by interventions 
in the economy, including price and export controls on food and restrictions on portfolio 
decisions of financial institutions.  

97. 
Short-term economic risks are mitigated first and foremost by the prudent 
macroeconomic management of Bolivian economic authorities. As noted by the IMF’s most 
recent Article IV consultation and as demonstrated during the recent financial crisis, Bolivia is 
well positioned to withstand short-term economic shocks due to restrained fiscal and monetary 

30 

policy and a declining debt profile. The Bank, in tandem with the IMF, will continue to closely 
monitor macroeconomic developments and offer technical assistance when requested by the 
authorities. Some potential areas for technical support include public debt management, in light 
of the projected mild fiscal deficits by 2014 due to increased investment spending and 
mechanisms to manage hydrocarbon income. Looking toward more long-term growth prospects, 
the proposed Bank strategy is focused on productive development—in particular in the rural, 
labor-intensive sector and in productive infrastructure—which will support more dynamic and 
diversified economic activity. 

C. Institutional Risks 

98. 
Bolivia faces numerous institutional challenges, including weak public sector 
capacity, poorly defined responsibilities among different levels of government and stresses 
caused by illegal activity and corruption. Wages are too low to attract and retain skilled 
officials and, as a consequence staff turnover in public sector institutions is high and capacity 
building is difficult. The recently approved Autonomies Law has only partially clarified the 
responsibilities of different levels of government and has left contentious issues unresolved, in 
particular the distribution of fiscal resources. Formal coordination mechanisms between different 
government levels are not in place, hindering the implementation of some projects and programs. 
In addition, the failure to improve the efficiency of sub-national governorates and other levels of 
authority could pose risks to the Bank’s portfolio, especially in terms of financial management. 
Bolivia’s illegal drug trade and contraband problems can—as noted in the WDR 2011—further 
stress institutions through corruption and rent seeking practices. 

99. 
The Bank is working in several directions to reduce the risks posed by institutional 
weakness. Joint semi-annual CPPRs will continue to be carried out with the Government to 
monitor project design and implementation. Bank technical and fiduciary teams will continue 
providing day-to-day guidance to counterparts during the preparation and execution phases of 
projects to improve implementation and ensure the achievement of intended objectives. 
Additionally, the design of operations will follow a more strategic approach, avoiding complex 
institutional arrangements, promptly identifying risks to strengthen institutional capacity 
components and building on existing arrangements and experienced entities whenever possible. 
Transparency issues are being addressed through a number of actions. For example, two of the 
Bank’s rural development projects that transfer funds directly to the community level, include 
increased monitoring processes, disbursements that occur in tranches and public accountability 
mechanisms for the local authorities that manage funds. Guidelines on fraud and corruption in 
Bank-financed operations are intended to contain corruption risk, as is the country’s participation 
in the StAR Initiative supported jointly by the Bank and the UN.

Issues and Obstacles 
Precarious national and 
rural 
roads limit access to markets by 
imposing 
high 
transportation 
costs. 

Airports 
have 
limited 
infrastructure and 
lack basic 
safety and security equipment. 

Small municipalities and poor 
rural communities 
lack basic 
infrastructure and cannot finance 
medium and 
large productive 
infrastructure projects. 

Lack of coordination among 
government levels constrains the 
provision 
of 
productive 
infrastructure.  

Small and Medium Enterprises 
represent over 90 percent of total 
enterprises 
in Bolivia, using 
around 70 percent of its labor 
force. 
However, 
their 
productivity is very low as they 
face severe obstacles to their 
development, 
including 
low

I. 

Introduction 

1. 
This Country Assistance Strategy Completion Report (CASCR) provides an evaluation of the 
Bank Group assistance to Bolivia for FY04-FY11 period. One Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) and 
two Interim Strategy Notes spanned this period. The Joint IBRD, IDA, IFC and MIGA FY04-FY05 CAS 
for the Republic of Bolivia (Report No. 26838-BO) was submitted to the Board in January 2004. The 
Joint IDA and IFC FY07-FY09 ISN for the Republic of Bolivia (Report No. 36095) (ISN I) and the Joint 
IDA and IFC FY10-FY11 ISN for the Plurinational State of Bolivia (ISN II) were submitted to the Board 
in October 2006 and April 2009, respectively.  

2. 
This CASCR was prepared using as background information the CAS, the two ISNs, the latest 
Implementation Status Reports (ISR) for projects in the Bank’s Bolivia portfolio, Implementation 
Completion and Results Reports (ICR) for credits that closed during the period, and by the Bolivia 1999-
2004 Country Assistance Evaluation (Report No. 33493, 2005) prepared by the Bank’s then Operations 
Evaluation Department.  

II. 
Findings of the Self-Evaluation 
Program Performance Rating: Moderately Satisfactory 
Bank’s Performance Rating: Satisfactory 

3. 
Program Performance. It is difficult to rate Program Performance since the CAS and ISN I did 
not provide Results Matrices, per sea. This CASCR retrofit a Matrix for the entire period, based on the 
expected outcomes as described in each of the strategy documents (Annex I). The Program Performance 
during the CAS period achieved its main objective: help maintain macroeconomic stability so as to 
contain the social and economic impact of the crisis. This addressed one of the critical short-term issues 
facing the Government at the time, and allowed the Bank in the next phase of the Program, covered by 
ISN I to focus on and address more structural issues that had led to the country’s difficult social and 
political issues. Performance under ISN I and ISN II, were more long-term in nature, seeking to address 
the long-standing issues that were at the root cause of social, political and economic crisis Bolivia was 
facing. The tremendous changes in Bolivia’s legal, institutional and political environment made progress 
towards the Program’s objectives challenging. On balance, the Program achieved good progress toward 
most major expected outcomes, with some shortcomings in the area of governance and support to the 
public sector, which will undoubtedly be the focus of increased support in the future. Program 
Performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory. 

4. 
Bank’s Performance. The Bank’s Performance over the CASCR period is rated Satisfactory. 
The Bank demonstrated ability to adjust and adapt to the difficult environment in which it was operating, 
flexibility in designing its strategies by preparing short-term CAS and ISN that reflected critical issues, 
ability to respond to changing priorities by the different Administrations and the emergencies they faced, 
and, more importantly, the ability to engage effectively and productively with a Government that from 
the outset had expressed extreme skepticism towards the Bank. Compared with the situation and 
prospects in 2006, the Bank has in place a solid relationship and dialogue with the Government, and a 
program of support to ongoing projects and non-lending services, together with a pipeline of new 

a Results Matrices were not prepared for several reasons: (1) at the time of the CAS, results matrices were not 
required; (2) results matrices are not required for an ISN, although ISN II did include one that spanned the results of 
ISN I; (2) each strategy covered a very short timeframe, which allowed at the most to complete the preparation and 
approval of the interventions included in the strategy, and therefore it would be hard to identify and measure any 
results and indicators during that period.

crisis in Bolivia. 

III. 

Review of the Progress Made Towards Achieving Country Level Goals 

5. 
Bolivia’s country level goals can be divided in two phases over the CASCR period. Although 
some of the Government’s objectives and programs, especially those that addressed promoting rural 
sector, environment, service delivery, were carried over across the CASCR period, the country’s goals in 
2004 and 2005 were very short term in nature, and aimed at addressing the economic, political and social 
issues that Bolivia was facing. The election of President Morales in December 2005 with a clear majority 
and representing previously excluded groups provided a mandate to build a more inclusive society. As a 
result, country level goals became more long term in nature. 

Country Level Goals 2004-2005 

6.  
Goals. In 2004, Bolivia’s situation was difficult and uncertain, the result of the volatile 
confluence of three trends—economic, political and social—that had been building up over several years. 
These had led to escalating social unrest that culminated in the forced resignation of President Sanchez de 
Lozada, and the assumption of Vice President Mesa in October 2003 in accordance with constitutional 
processes. On the economic side, three features stood out--a lack of progress in poverty reduction and 
high inequality, a vulnerability of the economy to external shocks, and a precarious fiscal situation. On 
the political side, there had been growing disenchantment with the overt use of political patronage and 
tolerance of corruption on the part of traditional political parties. Finally, on the social side, there was an 
increasing impatience with the levels of inequality, particularly in land distribution, and indigenous 
groups who felt that they had received little from the exploitation of natural resources in the past, were 
increasingly suspicious of Government plans to export natural gas. The government of President Mesa 
moved quickly to formulate a two phase plan to put the country back on a stable footing: (i) a first phase 
through the planned completion of a Constitutional Assembly, and (ii) a second phase from the end of the 
planned Constitutional Assembly to the end of the Presidential term in August 2007. The first phase 
would pursue three political and three economic objectives. On the political front, the objectives were: (i) 
revising the Hydrocarbons Law; (ii) submitting the decision to export natural gas from new sources to a 
public referendum; and (iii) calling for a Constitutional Assembly to modify the then existing 
Constitution. On the economic front, the objectives were: (i) restoring fiscal balances; (ii) reorienting 
some public expenditure toward high-visibility programs that responded to underlying factors that led to 
social conflict, especially in sensitive geographical areas; and (iii) re-launching anticorruption efforts to 
improve the business environment.  

7.  
Progress. The first phase of President Mesa’s political agenda was never fully completed by the 
time of his resignation in June 2005, when a transitional Government took over until new Presidential 
and Congressional elections were held in December 2005. Of the three political objectives, only two were 
implemented, and with mixed results. The Gas Referendum, which served as input into the new 
Hydrocarbons Law, was approved by a strong majority in July 2004. It provided legitimacy to tackle the 
sensitive gas export issue, abrogate the previous law, recover the property of hydrocarbons at the well-
head, reestablish the state-owned Yacimientos Petrolíferos Fiscales Bolivianos, and use gas to negotiate 
access to the Pacific Sea. However, its ambiguous wording produced different interpretations by political 
parties and social movements alike on how to handle gas ownership and fueled an intense debate that 
resulted in a Law that satisfied neither nationalists nor energy companies. Bolivia’s tax revenues from 
natural gas became significantly higher than those of other countries in the region. In May 2005, 
Congress approved a 18 percent royalty/32 percent non-deductible direct tax that was based on 
production rather than revenue. The law explicitly stated that fiscal revenues could not drop below 50 
percent of the hydrocarbon production value. With increasing tensions between the Government and gas 

40 

 
 
 
 
 
companies, and increasing uncertainty, foreign direct investment plummeted. There had also been little 
progress towards the Constitutional Assembly scheduled to take place during the second half of 2006, 
and no consensus regarding the criteria of representation in the Assembly. On the economic front, 
President Mesa’s administration was largely successful. With fast disbursing assistance from both the 
Bank and the IADB, the Government was able to close the 2004 financing gap, and with the Central 
Bank handling of incipient runs on bank deposits and the exchange rate, macroeconomic stability was 
maintained. Favorable external conditions and the new hydrocarbons tax regime, together with 
constrained spending due to slow execution of public investment contributed to significantly reduce the 
overall 2005 budget deficit to 1.5 percent of GDP down from 8 percent of GDP in 2003. In the fight 
against corruption, results were mixed. The Government enforced a 80 percent reduction in “reserved 
expenditures”, and appointed a Presidential Delegate for Anticorruption, but few actions were taken.  

Country Level Goals 2006-2011 

8.  
Goals. When President Morales assumed office, Bolivia was facing a new political and economic 
reality. The protests and previous instability had diminished the influence of traditional parties (the 
Government had a majority in Congress) and brought new actors, mainly from the social movements. 
Investment, particularly foreign, had been negatively impacted due to unrest and to uncertainty around 
the government’s development agenda.  

9. 
The Government’s May 2006 National Development Plan (the Plan) has a strong focus on 
poverty reduction and inclusion and proposed a profound social and political reform through a new 
Constitution. The Plan is based on four pillars: (i) Bolivia Productiva (Productive Bolivia) that seeks to 
increase the role of the state in strategic sectors—primarily natural resources and utilities—while 
boosting labor-intensive sectors and integral territorial complexes through financial and technical 
support; (ii) Bolivia Digna (Dignified Bolivia) that includes social programs—such as redistributive 
transfers and safety nets—to fight poverty and exclusion; (iii) Bolivia Soberana (Sovereign Bolivia) that 
seeks greater country ownership of Bolivia’s development process without external influences on 
policies, strengthened status in international fora through balanced relations with other countries, and 
self-sufficiency in food and energy production, and (iv) Bolivia Democrática y Participativa that 
redefines power relations, transferring political power to social and indigenous movements. The 
Constitutional Assembly was valued not only for its substantive outcome—dealing with complex issues 
like decentralization, land and territory, and collective rights—but for the process itself, which was 
expected to give voice to all Bolivians and strengthen national unity.  

10. 
Progress. Implementation of the Plan shows significant progress in some key areas while lagging 
in others. Over the last four years, the Government increased its participation in strategic sectors by 
nationalizing hydrocarbons, telecommunications, electricity, and mining companies, and creating several 
small public enterprises. It has also expanded cash transfers to the elderly and launched cash transfer 
programs to promote primary education attendance and the use of health services and neonatal care for 
pregnant women and young children. The new Constitution was enacted in February 2009, and the legal 
framework that will allow its implementation is being drafted, increasing social participation and 
enhancing decentralization. The Government was less effective in boosting labor-intensive sectors, as 
private investment remains sluggish. Public investment has been constrained by institutional problems 
that delayed Government initiatives to increase the coverage of public services, build additional 
infrastructure, industrialize natural resources, and create more public enterprises.  

11. 
There have been several promising developments, although many challenges remain. Due to the 
relative isolation of its financial sector from the global markets, Bolivia’s GDP grew by 3.4 percent in 
2009 (the highest in the region) despite the global crisis, while maintaining a current account surplus and 
near balance in fiscal accounts. Growth in 2010 reached 4.1 percent as hydrocarbons output rebounded as 

41 

 
 
 
 
 
the result of recovering gas demand in Brazil, and other sectors continued robust growth. Overall 
economic growth, together with the introduction or scaling up of cash transfer programs, is likely 
responsible for reductions in moderate and extreme poverty: between 2000 and 2007, poverty and 
extreme poverty dropped from 66 to 60 percent and from 45 to 38 percent respectively. Still, poverty is 
significantly higher in rural areas, calling for differentiated strategies for urban and rural areas, as 
proposed in the Plan, and progress in improving income distribution has been limited. Agricultural GDP 
continues to rise—contributing 20 percent to GDP and employing about 65 percent of the country’s 
workforce it is one of the main drivers of the economy—but has achieved only modest average growth 
due to structural and institutional challenges. Substantial efforts are being made to modernize the sector 
and to enhance productivity.  

12. 
Bolivia is broadly on target towards achieving MDG goals. In education important initiatives 
have been implemented such as the literacy program Yo Si Puedo and the Bono Juancito Pinto cash 
transfer for primary students. As measured by enrollment rates, schooling for children aged 12 and below 
is nearly universal. Still, extending coverage and improving quality remains a challenge, mainly in the 
pre-primary and secondary levels where in 2007, the net enrollment rates were just 38 percent and 57 
percent, respectively. The Assembly has recently passed a new Education Law that will gradually enter 
into force over the coming years. The Government introduced initiatives to expand access to and improve 
quality of health services and to support improved nutrition. The new Constitution and legislation 
guarantee equal rights for men and women, and equal access to social services. Infant mortality in urban 
areas fell from 44 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2003 to 36 in 2008; progress in rural areas stagnated 
during this period, however. There have been some advances for maternal health, but little impact on 
outcomes. The Government has expanded the coverage of the Universal Maternal and Infant Insurance 
Program (SUMI) and introduced a new approach to reduce cultural barriers to access health services. The 
Zero Malnutrition Program (ZMP) and the CCT Bono Juana Azurduy were introduced to prevent and 
tackle malnutrition in pregnant and breastfeeding women and children under two years, and to promote 
increased use of health services. 

13. 
Governance, effective policy coordination and public sector efficiency require more attention but 
there have been important initiatives in terms of anti-corruption and transparency. The Government took 
measures to increase social control and accountability, strengthen transparency and access to information 
and enhance anticorruption measures, including a national policy on transparency and anticorruption 
approved in July 2009, the Law to Fight Corruption, Illegal Enrichment and Fortune Investigation 
approved in March 2010, and the creation of a Ministry of Institutional Transparency and Fight against 
Corruption. President Morales was re-elected with 64 percent of the votes in December 2009. 

IV. 
Highlights of the Detailed Evaluation of the Program Performance in influencing the CAS 
outcomes as laid out in the results matrix 

Objectives of Bank Assistance 

14. 
The Bank Group’s CAS supported the first phase of the Government’s agenda (para. 7) and 
concentrated assistance as follows: (i) support to key economic and political processes; (ii) 
macroeconomic stability and growth; (iii) promoting the rural sector and the environment; (iv) improving 
service coverage and quality in the social sectors, and (v) public sector modernization, governance and 
transparency. ISN I prioritized: (i) good governance emphasizing anticorruption; (ii) fostering job 
creation through inclusive growth; and (iii) social inclusion through improved public service provision. 
ISN II prioritized: (i) productive development and support to production; (ii) sustainable development; 
(iii) human development; and (iv) governance and support to the public sector. This section evaluates the 
Program’s performance according to the retrofitted CAS outcome classifications under the column 
CASCR Evaluation in the Table 4 (Annex 2.4). 

42 

 
 
 
 
 
Progress in Influencing CAS and ISN Outcomes 

15. 
Support to Key Economic and Political Processes. While the Bank’s assistance towards this 
CAS outcome was delivered through technical assistance on the hydrocarbons legislation and an IDF 
grant to support the coordination of the Constitutional Assembly, it is not clear that it provided an impact 
on softening the transition of key economic and political processes, which were by definition, short term, 
and expected to be influenced through other means. Furthermore, through a Nationalization Decree in 
mid-2006, the Government increased its control of the hydrocarbon industry, and the state oil company, 
Yacimientos Petrolíferos Fiscales Bolivianos (YPFB), will hold at least 50 percent plus one of the total 
shares of companies “capitalized” and/or privatized back in the 1990s. To continue operating, oil 
companies had to sign new service contracts with YPFB that will handle all hydrocarbon 
commercialization. While the new Hydrocarbons Law served to increase government revenues, Bolivia 
has faced challenges in realizing investments to increase its gas production capacity, as YPFB has not 
been able to boost sector development. In retrospect, the Bank was and is not well positioned or qualified 
to provide support to political processes of the magnitude that Bolivia faced at the time.  

16. Macroeconomic Stability and Growth. Support from the Bank and IADB was instrumental in 
sustaining macroeconomic balance during 2004, thereby helping contain the social and economic impact 
of the political crisis. Bolivia’s macroeconomic situation was fragile, with a fiscal deficit between 8 and 9 
percent of GDP and a large financing gap. A package of policy-based fast-disbursing assistance including 
an Emergency Economic Recovery Credit, a Social Safety Net Credit, and funding of wages and salaries 
of civil servants under an ongoing Institutional Reform Project provided a rapid infusion of liquidity to 
support the end-of-year US$94 million fiscal gap caused in part by the ongoing social and political 
tensions and episodes of civil unrest and the drop in external financing (amounting to 0.1 percent of the 
overall deficit in terms of GDP) that resulted largely by the difficulties in producing a Poverty Reduction 
Strategy (which in turn led to postponing the Bank’s planned US$30 million Poverty Reduction Strategy 
Credit and the IMF’s Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility). This assistance allowed the Government 
to maintain critical social programs. With the changes in the hydrocarbons regime, Bolivia’s previous 
customary fiscal deficits have turned into surpluses that together with relatively favorable external 
conditions have resulted in improvements in economic growth, even though private investment has 
remained low. 

17. 
The Bank-financed Bank and Corporate Sector Restructuring Program (BCRP) supported 
important financial sector legal, regulatory and institutional reforms—including the confirmation of the 
Superintendency of Banks and Financial Entities as the exclusive authority in matters of prudential norms 
and regulations, strengthening the financial sector and reducing the risk of future systemic financial 
crises. The reforms supported by the first phase are in place, but priorities have focused now on 
broadening and deepening access to credit, particularly to small and medium enterprises and agriculture, 
and not towards corporate restructuring that was to be the focus of a second phase. The Bank 
complemented its financial assistance towards this strategic objective with a strong program of analytical 
and advisory services including a Public Expenditure Review (carried out jointly with the IADB); 
Poverty Assessment which fed into the design of Bank-financed operations; a Country Economic 
Memorandum (CEM) focused on employment-generating economic growth and policies aimed at 
improving investment climate and boosting exports, a Credit Bureau Assessment carried out as part of the 
Western Hemisphere Credit Bureau Initiative, a series of Financial Sector Notes to update knowledge on 
the sector (described in para. 21 below) and a recently-concluded Financial Sector Assessment Program. 
Non-lending Technical Assistance studies on the private sector (on topics such as urban alliances, partial 
credit risk guarantees, moveable assets as collateral) were also delivered to support preparation of a 
project on urban alliances, but the project was eventually dropped due to frequent changes in the 
counterparts. Despite the difficult environment for private sector investments in Bolivia, IFC continued 

43 

 
 
 
 
its effort to implement its support strategy based on the selective provision of financing for viable, high-
impact projects, monitoring its portfolio as well as providing technical assistance and capacity building. 
However, IFC’s outstanding investments have declined from US$235.3 million in September 2005 to 
US$39.4 million in January 2011. 

18. 
Productive Development and Support to Production, including Sustainable Development. The 
CAS recognized the importance of promoting the rural sector in order to reduce poverty (estimated at 
about 90 of the rural population) and inequality and contemplated actions aimed at improving conditions 
for productive activities and creating income-generating opportunities. Infrastructure, mainly rural roads, 
access to basic services and land, sustainable productive initiatives, and biodiversity conservation were 
prioritized. There have been some important initiatives supported by lending, that have made promising 
progress towards improving living and economic conditions in rural areas through improved 
infrastructure, and, at the same time, developed innovative approaches, adapted to Bolivia’s reality, to 
ensure that the rural population would benefit from the jobs generated by the projects. The Participatory 
Rural Investment Project II (PDCR II) is helping to develop practical instruments to ensure coordination 
in public investment and reduce duplication of efforts and has acquired increased relevance within the 
constitutional reform, which intends to clarify inter-governmental relations. Rural municipalities have 
conducted participatory transportation planning that has provided complete information on road 
networks, categorizing each road according to the population served, condition, and maintenance or 
upgrading need. On this basis, mayors and communities have defined their priorities, taking into account 
their budgetary capacity. The PDCR II also helped communities implement spot improvements as the key 
modality of intervention in the road network. This has allowed municipalities and communities to focus 
on year-round accessibility, rather than speed of circulation. The cost of road improvements has fallen by 
approximately half, allowing the project to finance 900 kilometers of roads with just US$4 million, 
directly benefiting close to 220,000 people in the remotest areas of the country that now have access to an 
all-season road. The success of the Rural Alliances Project, has led the Government to create the 
Empoderar program, intended as the main line of action to improve access to markets, production and 
competitiveness on the part of poor rural producers. Success in implementing grants that are managed by 
the producer organizations themselves has served as an example for other rural development programs. 
The project has had significant impact, as it is focused on an important conceptual shift from producer 
support focused on the needs of producers and their organizations, without regard for market 
competitiveness to support for market opportunities of producer organizations, as demonstrated in 
alliances with buyers who express a specific demand. Over 13,000 families received direct benefits from 
296 producer subprojects financed, of which 83 percent have positive financial results. The National 
Land Administration Project (NLAP) obtained important achievements, including legislation and 
regulations necessary for carrying out streamlined land regularization, and the establishment of the 
National Agrarian Tribunal as a special part of the Judicial Branch. After five full years of operation, the 
NLAP had opened 50 tribunals and resolved 1,684 cases of agrarian land rights disputes. In addition, land 
registries in nine departmental capitals and three regional centers transferred to the Instituto Nacional de 
Reforma Agraria (INRA). The Land for Agricultural Development Project (LADP) is establishing a 
decentralized beneficiary-driven land distribution mechanism that is allowing organized landless or poor 
farmers to acquire suitable agricultural loans and implement investment projects which would put them 
on a sustainable, higher income livelihood paths by providing a revolving line of credit to finance land 
purchases and matching grants for infrastructure and productive investments on the purchased lands. 
Productive Associations, established and supported under the project, are responsible for the repayment 
of the land acquisition loans and the acquired lands serve as collateral. The LADP is particularly relevant, 
since land is a high-visibility issue that is the cause of potentially explosive conflicts between 
indigenous/peasant groups and large landowners in the eastern part of the country. Despite 
implementation issues, the Indigenous Peoples Development Project (Indigenous LIL) financed--together 
with indigenous producer groups--40 pilot investments in the areas of community tourism, handicraft 
production and marketing and basic processing of renewable natural resources and both demonstrated 

44 

 
that community groups can manage funds successfully and revealed the institutional and regulatory 
practices that place barriers in transferring resources directly to social organizations.  

19. 
Support to infrastructure development also produced important outcomes, both to promote 
growth and exports and increase access of rural areas to markets and services. The Abapo-Camiri 
Highway within the transport corridor which links Bolivia with Argentina and Paraguay is estimated to 
have reduced transport costs, vehicle operating costs, travel time from Santa Cruz to Yacuiba and traffic 
volumes on this now all-weather road have increased by 138 percent. In addition, access for rural 
communities was provided by the rehabilitation and maintenance of some adjacent access roads. The 
Road Rehabilitation and Maintenance Project has rehabilitated priority sections of the national road 
network resulting in increases in freight transport and passenger transport. Rehabilitation of the priority 
Calamarca-San Pedro and Boyuibe- Yacuiba sections provides continuity to the Abapo-Camiri highway 
and access to Mercosur markets and has contributed to a reduction in freight transport tariffs from 
Bolivia’s lowlands to Argentina, and an increase use of those roads by trucks. Equally impressive, the 
Project introduced a successful results-based routine maintenance program for the entire primary road 
network) by fostering the use of micro-enterprises in the routine maintenance of roads—keeping the 
roads clean and preventing their deterioration. The Decentralized Infrastructure for Rural Transformation 
Project--the second largest Bank-financed renewable energy-based electrification project in LCR--is 
expanding and improving electricity delivery as a catalyst for the development of rural areas. It is 
financing competitively awarded subsidies to the private sector to expand electricity services and 
supporting expansion through solar systems in isolated rural areas and grid densification in peri-urban 
areas. With a new regulatory framework for rural electrification and the establishment of a financing 
mechanism for the program, Programa Eectricidad para Vivir con Dignidad, the Project has installed 
solar home systems in the poorest rural areas, benefiting an estimated 45,000 people. In addition, solar 
home systems have been installed in schools and clinics, benefiting an additional 30,000 people; public 
lighting has been provided for 20,000 in poor, urban areas. The Urban Infrastructure Project has exceeded 
its original targets in providing access to sewage connections, and property values as measured by the 
cost of rent in participating poor neighborhoods in La Paz have increased over four times what had been 
expected due to improved access to basic urban services. The Government has expressed interest in a 
possible additional financing and the Municipal Services Study, currently under preparation, will provide 
inputs towards a larger potential intervention in the provision of basic infrastructure to the urban poor. 

20. 
The Bolivian economy is strongly exposed to natural disaster risks, and these affect mostly the 
poor. A joint Damage and Loss Assessment estimated the La Niña flood of December 2007 alone to have 
caused damages and losses worth US$443 million overwhelming the Government’s ability to respond to 
rehabilitation and recovery needs. The Emergency Recovery and Disaster Management Project and a 
related Additional Financing have supported rehabilitation of the productive capacity in affected 
communities. They respond to the objectives of the Government’s National Plan for Sustainable 
Rehabilitation and Reconstruction (PRESS), and the 2008-2010 Rehabilitation and Reconstruction 
National Plan that aim to strengthen the ability to respond to future disasters by moving from a reactive to 
a proactive approach by investing in risk mitigation measures and by improving risk evaluation in 
planning and reconstruction. The Sustainability of the National System of Protected Areas GEF Project 
has had important results in ten of the 22 protected areas, and has provided minimum infrastructure and 
equipment to ensure effective management and operation of each area. A key achievement is that 
communities within and around the areas are increasingly involved and committed to the conservation 
following environmental education in communities neighboring the areas, and the piloting of sustainable, 
biodiversity-related, income-generating activities within areas and their buffer zones. 

21. 
Bolivia faces important challenges to improve its traditionally weak investment climate to spur 
private sector development, and the Bank’s non-lending assistance focused on providing analysis and 
policy options. A study on Policies for Increasing Firms’ Formality and Productivity assessed the 

45 

 
 
 
productivity constraints faced by Bolivian firms, identifying policies to encourage their productivity and 
formality. These policies vary according to the size of the firm and were prioritized to formulate a 
comprehensive support program. Following from this, the Bank provided several analytical works to, 
inter alia, provide advice on productivity and trade issues (including logistics), evaluate specific issues on 
informality among women entrepreneurs and evaluate the Bolivian trade policy and its effects on non-
traditional labor-intensive exports. A series of Financial Sector Notes followed a modular approach to 
foster dialogue and accommodate topics of interest to the Government. Topics included the transitioning 
of financial cooperatives into the regulatory sphere, and comparing the applicable regulatory framework 
with regional standards. This study, in combination with a South-South Dialogue with Mexico on their 
experience in bringing cooperatives under prudential oversight, has helped the Government refine its 
reform agenda. Another report in this series focuses on outreach to rural areas and assessing the financial 
sector’s potential role in fostering productive sector credit. The Bank and the government are currently 
exploring possible follow-up to implement some of the findings.  

22. 
Human Development. Although it remained among the poorest countries in the Latin America 
region, Bolivia had made considerable progress in social outcomes in the decade preceding the CAS. 
Building on the Social Safety Net SAC, two Social Sector Programmatic Credits protected this 
performance from the political volatility and macroeconomic situation in the 2004-2005 period. Together, 
this policy-based lending resulted in improved sector policy frameworks, congruent with accelerating 
progress towards the MDGs, and promoted results-based orientation and accountability. The only area in 
which advances were limited was for water and sanitation, where political conflicts led to the suspension 
of the Aguas de Illimani water concession in El Alto. This policy reversal led to the withdrawal of the 
water and sanitation sector from the programmatic operation, and a reduction in the amount financed. At 
the time of the ISN I design, Bolivia still faced substantial social inequality. Education coverage had 
shown improvement, but universal coverage remained a considerable challenge—particularly for rural 
and indigenous populations—and the quality of education was very low. Complemented by 
comprehensive sector work, lending was highly successful in promoting decentralized management and 
community participation and produced promising results. Under the Education Quality and Equity 
Strengthening Project the average years of schooling for students in project areas increased from 6.1 to 
7.4, the percentage of students with satisfactory academic achievement in Grade 3 increased from 89.9 to 
91.2 percent, and gender disparities in average years of schooling were reduced. The Secondary 
Education Transformation Project, has so far provided the intended new infrastructure, enrolled 4,500 
students in an incentive program to reduce the risk of drop-out, and supported 178 schools in the 
preparation of School Improvement Plans aimed at improving education quality. Following the 
successful Health Sector Reform Project that closed in 2003, the Second Health Sector Reform Project 
was successful in increasing the coverage of births attended by trained health personnel which increased 
from 54 percent to 57 percent, complete prenatal care attendance from 33 percent to 40 percent; early 
neonatal hospital mortality remained at eight per 1,000 live births; the number of pneumonia cases 
attended in health services increased from 112,000 to 174,000; and the percentage of children with iron 
supplement (third iron dose) increased from 8 percent to 20 percent. Eighty five percent of project 
beneficiaries belong to the two lowest wealth quintiles population, indicating a high pro-poor targeting. 
The Expanding Access to Reduce Health Inequalities APLIII was approved in 2008 but is facing 
implementation challenges. With poverty reduction at the center of President Morales’ agenda, the Bank 
has provided continuous non-lending assistance and evidence-based analysis aimed at informing the 
Government’s social protection strategy under the Programmatic Social Protection AAA. As a result of 
the success of this AAA in terms of its support for client engagement and dialogue to inform strategy, the 
program is now in its fifth year of continuous implementation, providing just-in-time assistance on a 
programmatic basis. Based on priorities identified in this AAA, the Investing in Children and Youth 
Project is supporting two flagship programs of the Government’s Social Protection and Integrated 
Community Development Strategy: (i) the Bono Juana Azurduy, which is under the umbrella of the Zero 
Malnutrition Program and addresses chronic malnutrition through a conditional cash transfer aimed at 

46 

 
benefiting pregnant women and children under two-years-old in the most vulnerable municipalities; and 
(ii) the Mi Primer Empleo Digno (My First Dignified Employment), a skill-development program for low 
income youth living in poor urban areas to enhance their ability to find and maintain a good quality job. 
The Project has developed the information system, including beneficiary registries through which 
financing of cash transfers of the Bono Juana Azurduy will be made, and a pilot phase of Mi Primer 
Empleo has been successfully completed in four cities, and incorporating adjustments based on the pilot, 
has been expanded to six additional ones. 

23. 
Governance and Support to the Public Sector. While an important priority for Bolivia, this was 
the most challenging area of Bank assistance, which required both flexibility on the Bank’s part in terms 
of engaging with the various Governments through a mix of lending and non-lending services, and 
adjustment to redefined priorities for both reforms and their corresponding implementation strategies. 
Based on findings of the 2004 Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA), the Government in 
2005 presented the “Strategic Framework for Strengthening Public Finances” that was endorsed by the 
Donor Community. Although progress was uneven, key actions were implemented, including: the 
expansion of the system for budget control and monitoring (SIGMA) both at the central, and sub-national 
levels and the implementation of a functional classification of expenditures and the implementation of the 
Single Treasury Account. Under the Institutional Reform I Project (IRP I), limited progress was made 
toward the achievement of its objectives, including the vertical reforms introduced in three pilot agencies 
(tax, customs and road agencies). However, the development of a modern, result oriented management 
system failed. Also, in view of the Government’s redefined institutional reform strategy coupled with 
repeated staffing changes, a follow-up to this Project did not advance as planned. Some progress was 
achieved in the preparation of planned operations to support the governance pillar, although these have 
yet to show results. A Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) Report assessed the 
pubic financial management system, and identified and prioritized reforms. In January 2011 a 
Strengthening Statistical Capacity and Informational Base for Evidence-Based Planning Project was 
approved. The planned Strengthening State Efficiency and Transparency Project has been converted into 
non-lending technical assistance to improve the public investment process and the coordination among 
different government levels. The Bank has also supported governance through institutional strengthening 
components in its projects, paying particular attention to improvements in monitoring and evaluation 
systems. Following Bolivia’s participation in the Bank’s 2007 global consultation on “Strengthening 
World Bank Engagement on Governance and Anticorruption” the Government reiterated its strong 
commitment to fighting corruption and increasing transparency in the use of public resources; a mandate 
that has been assigned to the Ministry of Institutional Transparency, and Fight against Corruption.  

V. 
Brief Review of the Bank’s Performance in designing and managing the implementation of 
the program 

Design of the Strategy 

Relevance and Alignment with Country Development Priorities 

24. 
The Bank’s program was relevant and, as it was short-term by design allowed the flexibility 
needed to ensure alignment with the Bank’s comparative advantage, and country priorities in areas where 
there was agreement throughout the period. The short term nature of the CAS, and the timing of the two 
ISNs ensured that the Bank’s assistance responded in the first instance, to the country’s short-term 
macroeconomic needs, and later, to the Morales Administration’s priorities. The timing of ISN I, for 
example, allowed for dropping a Second Bank and Corporate Sector Restructuring Program and the 
Institutional Reform II Project that were not in line with the Government’s priorities, and intensifying 
lending and non-lending assistance in support of the new Government’s focus on poverty, productive 
development and support to production, and human development. Some of the projects in the portfolio 

47 

 
 
 
 
 
(e.g., Institutional Reform) were completed, but lost their relevance due to new priorities; consequently 
their outcome was not satisfactory.  

Selection of Areas of Engagement and Instruments 

25. 
The selection of areas of engagement was appropriate. In 2004-2005, the Bank correctly focused 
on helping maintain macroeconomic stability through policy-based loans, aimed mostly at protecting 
social programs. Starting in 2006, and, with little knowledge of the plans of the new Administration, and 
some concern for future policy directions, the shift on investment lending focusing on productive 
development and support to production and human development was also appropriate. While the Bank’s 
focus on governance and anticorruption was justified---Bolivia’s Corruption Perception Index released by 
Transparency International gave Bolivia a score of 2.5 ranking the country at 114 out of 158 countries—
the Bank may have been ambitious in planning two operations under ISN I that would address difficult 
issues before having established a solid relationship with the Government based on mutual trust. It also 
may have underestimated the intense restructuring that the country would face in implementing a new 
Constitution. In the end, the Bank worked intensively and jointly through non-lending services in order to 
build this trust and a program of lending that responds to the Government’s priorities.  

Realism of the Expected Outcomes and Quality of Results Framework 

26. 
ISN II had a Results Framework including Milestones and ISN Outcomes that together with the 
text of the CAS and earlier ISN have been used to retrofit a Framework for the CASCR period (Annex 
2.1). The Results Framework in ISN II mentioned explicitly that eight of the then active projects would 
only start their implementation in FY2010, several projects identified under the ISN would only be 
submitted to the Board for approval shortly before the completion of the ISN, and that as a result, the 
outcomes were expected to materialize much later than the FY2010-2011 timeframe. In that context, the 
outcomes identified referred to results expected upon or beyond the closing of projects, while the 
milestones were expected to show some progress during implementation of the ISN. 

Identification of Critical Risks 

27. 
There is no question that Bank assistance throughout this period was faced with considerable 
risks. The short duration of the CAS and ISNs was in response to the risky and totally uncertain 
environment. The CAS and the ISNs each highlighted these risks very explicitly and extensively. The 
three main risks identified in the CAS all materialized: (i) Congress was still controlled by traditional 
political parties, (ii) President Mesa did not serve his full constitutional term, (iii) strong demands were 
being placed on the government from different sectors while the government had limited capacity to 
respond, and (iv) there were several groups that wanted to see the government fail. As a result, the first 
phase of President Mesa’s agenda was never fully completed. Perhaps the risk that had not been 
contemplated was that the Bank would not be able to continue to deliver assistance in Bolivia through the 
Country Office and visiting missions due to the increasing violence in the last months of President 
Mesa’s administration. Of the risks identified in the ISNs the main one that materialized related to 
institutional and fiduciary aspects, and the portfolio, that together resulted in delays in new lending, and 
issues with portfolio management. The mitigation strategies identified and implemented to address those 
risks were helpful in reducing their impact. Public sector wage reductions made it difficult to attract and 
retain highly skilled public servants and frequent turnover of project staff, including those working with 
financial management. The recently approved Constitution is having some impact on the institutional and 
other arrangements for Bank-financed projects, including in the definition of responsibilities across three 
levels of government, but so far these have been address through project restructurings.

Adjusting the Program to Changing Country Circumstances and Priorities 

28. 
The very short-term nature of the CAS and ISNs, and their timing, in part contained the need to 
make major adjustments in planned assistance. Yet, when appropriate, the Bank adjusted the planned 
program to changing circumstances and priorities, by proving finance for unexpected emergencies, 
scaling up the impact and results of successful projects through additional financing, and demonstrating 
flexibility in the choice of instruments while still focusing on expected outcomes by converting planned 
lending assistance non-lending technical assistance to accomplish similar assistance objectives.

Performance in Supporting the Implementation of Projects/Programs in the Portfolio. 

29. 
Portfolio Level. The portfolio shrunk from 14 projects at the inception of the CAS to five projects 
in FY2007. A strong lending program in FY2008, together with subsequent approvals and closures 
resulted in a portfolio of 11 projects by end-FY2011. The Table below summarizes the main portfolio 
indicators.

Portfolio Management. The Bank provided strong portfolio support throughout the period to 
ensure both continued relevance and timely attention to implementation issues. Proactivity was high, and 
the number of problem projects has declined. Effectiveness delays still account for the high number of 
projects at risk. Country Financing Parameters were introduced early to help alleviate the fiscal impact of 
the Bank’s assistance by allowing the financing of recurrent costs, local currency costs, taxes and duties 
and other eligible expenditures. Country Portfolio Performance Reviews (CPPRs) were held yearly, and 
served as a forum for the Government and project implementing agencies to work with the Bank’s 
Country Team to identify and agree upon steps to address bottlenecks and issues. Detailed Aide-
Memoires recorded the CPPRs’ findings and agreed follow-up actions. Under this umbrella framework, 
and with follow up under routine implementation support for individual operations, some projects were 
restructured to adjust project objectives and/or descriptions and address implementation issues (e.g., 
increasing financing percentages, modifying institutional arrangements). Despite proactive supervision, 
project implementation in a volatile and changing environment was not easy. Of the twenty projects that 
exited the portfolio, nine were evaluated as either MU or U in the Implementation Completion Reports. 
Several issues affected projects’ implementation, including, frequent changes in implementing agencies’ 
staff, weak procurement, financial management and operational capacity to support implementation, 
hiring difficulties, lack of clarity of the new institutional structure, delays in issuing no-objections, and 
counterpart funding constraints. The Bank intensified the number of seminars and workshops it delivered 
to relevant staff of executing agencies on the subjects of procurement, disbursement, financial 

49 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
management and safeguards. The identification of implementation issues, such as effectiveness delays, 
has led to advancing several tasks during preparation to avoid implementation delays.  

31. 

 Individual Project Level. Individual project progress is presented in Annex 2.1. 

32. 
Financial Management. Starting with a joint Bank and IADB Country Financial Accountability 
Assessment (CFAA) in 2004, the Bank has continuously supported initiatives to strengthen government 
systems to increasingly rely on these for Bank-financed projects. A Public Expenditure and Financial 
Accountability Assessment (PEFA) carried out in 2009 has provided useful information on the strengths 
and weakness of public financial management systems, and the Government is using this to develop an 
action plan that addresses identified issues with the support of the donor community. 

Supporting the Design of New Projects/Programs 

33. 
There were considerable delays in delivering planned lending, in part due to the need to redefine 
projects to the new Administration’s priorities, and in part due to constraints of working in a changing 
institutional environment with weak staffing capacity (Table 2, Annex 2.2). Following the strong 
program of fast-disbursing assistance in FY2004, progress towards preparation of investment lending fell 
short of expectations. Of the US$597.0 planned lending during the period (of which US$125.0 million 
was to be IBRD and US$472.0 million IDA), only US$448.9 million was approved, of which only 
US$15.0 million was IBRD. Additional financing was delivered for the well-performing projects. There 
was no lending in 2006, lending in 2007 was mostly delayed, and there was a near doubling of lending in 
2008 against what had been planned in ISN I, mostly due to delays in preparation caused by the change in 
administration in 2005 and the subsequent bunching of new lending. Most of the new investment lending 
supported the CAS outcomes of Productive Development and Support to Production (69 percent), and 
Human Development (31 percent). Several operations were dropped in view of the new Administration’s 
priorities.  

Relevance of Knowledge-Based Activities 

34. 
The Bank’s program of analytical and advisory services (AAA) (Table 3, Annex 2.3) was 
extensive, well designed to provide support in areas where lending services were neither desired, nor 
justified (e.g., technical assistance for the Hydrocarbons Law), and effective in identifying key issues and 
topics for a policy dialogue. Recommendations of the Bank’s AAA have been used as input to the 
Government’s National Development Plan. Just-in-time Policy Option Notes prepared at the beginning of 
President Morales’ administration served to initiate a dialogue with a somewhat skeptical government, 
and then provided a road map for Bank assistance in areas that responded to the Government’s priorities. 
AAA was designed and used effectively to feed into the development of new programs and projects and 
used a variety of instruments tailored to the particular need, including formal sector work, non-lending 
technical assistance, policy notes, etc. AAA also proved to be an important instrument in sustaining a 
dialogue in areas where the project support lagged. Especially important were the programmatic AAAs 
that provided an overall instrument to adjust to priorities and requests while providing just in time 
support. Finally, Bolivia’s participation in Bank-sponsored global consultations (e.g., Governance and 
Anticorruption) with representatives from Congress, the Administration, the Judiciary, Civil Society, and 
others, resulted in the Government reiterating its strong commitment to fighting corruption and increasing 
transparency, for which the Bank will provide non-lending technical assistance.  

35. 
The WBI also provided important support; throughout most of the period Bolivia was one of the 
WBI’s focus countries in LAC. The WBI’s priority was to address learning and capacity development 
needs in the sectors where the Bank was engaged in lending activities and/or analytical work by 
providing access to international knowledge and experience, both through structured training programs 

50 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and by facilitating “just-in-time” exchange with practitioners from other countries. Sectors/themes of 
focus 
included: governance/anticorruption, decentralization, education, and rural development. 
Consultations, outreach and dissemination through the Country Office were an integral part of the Bank’s 
assistance. Broader dissemination of the analytical work and greater openness in Bolivia have helped to 
position the Bank as an important independent source of information and to improve the Bank’s image in 
the country, and has served to promote wide and transparent debate among civil society groups on issues 
of importance to development. Notes on project and studies were translated and disseminated widely, 
including on the Bank’s Bolivia web page. The Bank’s Country Office also worked to involve civil 
society in the design and implementation of projects financed by the Bank, and promoted conferences to 
exchange experiences and views, often with participation of other countries. 

Bank’s efforts for Enhancing the Effectiveness of Overall Assistance Provided by all Donors 

36. 
Although decreasing as a percentage of GDP, official development aid remains important for 
Bolivia. The Bank participated actively in donor coordination fora to maintain the alignment of its 
assistance with the NDP and the donors’ assistance. The Bank participated directly in the five Mesas de 
Coordinación organized by the Government in late 2006 to discuss sector plans and the NDP 
implementation, co-leading the Mesa Bolivia Digna together with the Netherlands. In addition to the 
Mesas, a Partners Group for the Development of Bolivia (GruS) was created in late 2006 to serve as a 
platform to better support the Government and its NDP. The chair of the GruS is elected on a semi-
annual basis; the Bank chaired in during the second half of 2009. On a more operational level, the Bank 
participates in many of the 16 sector sub-groups that report to the GruS on a regular basis, and is co-chair 
of the Disaster Management and Emergency sub-group and the Water and Sanitation sub-group. The 
Bank is also an active member of the United Nations Country Team--and strengthened its participation in 
2008--in order to promote harmonization and seek synergies to improve the work of the entire system in 
the field. The Bank has also provided valuable technical assistance under the South-South Experience 
Exchange Trust Fund. 

The Effectiveness of the Dialogue and Business Relations with the Authorities 

37. 
The Bank’s dialogue with the Mesa Administration was by design short-term in nature. Dialogue 
with the Rodriguez administration was limited by the short term of his administration and by the 
increasing tensions and violence that resulted in the withdrawal of the Bank’s Country Office Staff and 
the restriction in travel. The Bank was the first major donor to engage with the President Morales’ 
Administration. This rapid engagement helped clear up negative perceptions of the Bank and other 
multilaterals, and contributed to the development of a trusting environment that helped build a positive 
relationship. Starting with technical briefings between the Bank’s Country Team and President Morales’ 
policy team during the campaign period and then after elections, the Bank immediately prepared a series 
of Policy Notes that were discussed at a high-level event in March 2006. The Government and the Bank 
identified assistance priorities in areas where there was agreement, and these discussions provided a 
sound basis for the development of an assistance strategy to the new Government. 

How the Bank mitigated risks and managed the Program when some of the Risks Materialized. 

38.  
Successive strategies had identified extensive risks, many of which materialized. The short-term 
nature of each of the strategies was designed to mitigate these risks. Towards the last months of the CAS, 
the Bank’s involvement was curtailed due to the violence in the country. When President Rodriguez 
assumed power, assistance resumed on a limited scale. During this period, however, the Bank began 
engaging with presidential candidates, including President Morales through targeted workshops, aimed at 
explaining the Bank’s mandate, assistance program and possibilities for future engagement. A strong 
program of AAA in FY2004-FY2006 enabled the Bank to engage productively in discussions with the 

51 

 
 
 
 
 
 
new administration. While the situation was uncertain, the alternative of not engaging could have been 
worse, with the Bank losing a historic opportunity for working pragmatically to help assess alternatives 
with the benefit of international best practices and lessons learned and, thereby, enhancing the prospects 
for positive outcomes. Implementation and program risks were mitigated by demonstrating 
responsiveness to new priorities and emergencies, flexibility in the choice of instrument, willingness to 
provide strong technical and advisory services, including in increased portfolio and program monitoring 
and the project restructuring to address new institutional realities. 

VI. 

Key Lessons and Suggestions for the New CAS 

39. 
There are important lessons of experience for the Bank from its assistance during the CASCR 
period that are relevant to the Bank in general, and to the design of its future strategy for Bolivia. First, 
the Bank’s Performance in Bolivia offers a positive experience of Bank engagement with a Government 
that may not share the same views in all areas. Progress in private sector development and attracting 
private investment may be limited, but by showing flexibility, openness, listening to country priorities 
and strategies and selectively supporting those areas where there is a convergence of views and 
approaches, the Bank has developed a positive engagement with the Government in support of a program 
that is yielding promising results in terms of improving the prospects for its population. Second, although 
the political risk has diminished, at least until when the next pre-electoral period begins, there still exists 
a high degree of social and institutional risk in view of the process to implement the various legal aspects 
of the new Constitution. This risk could come to affect not only new lending, but especially projects in 
the portfolio as their implementing arrangements may need to adjust to a new institutional framework. 
While the provision of both intensive analytical and advisory services and implementation support may 
mitigate this risk, its impact on the program should not be underestimated. Third, the new Country 
Partnership Strategy (CPS) should coincide with the end of the Presidential term. The implementation of 
several projects and a productive program of analytical and advisory services have shown that it is 
possible to make a marked impact on economic and social issues that have affected Bolivia’s 
development, especially of its large rural population. Over the next CPS period, several ongoing projects 
will likely produce important results. The Bank should prepare succinct, informative project “notes” 
highlighting projects’ successful experiences, accomplishments and future challenges to provide 
continuity. Irrespective of a future election’s outcome, Bolivia’s continued progress and social stability 
depends fundamentally on improving the livelihood of its population, especially the rural poor. Many of 
these projects will provide important lessons for future programs and assistance efforts. Finally, results 
monitoring, and showing results, should be an important focus, for both the Government and the Bank. 
Promising ongoing initiatives and programs could offer important knowledge that could be applied in 
countries facing similar challenges. The next CPS should include a carefully articulated Results Matrix 
that will allow the Bank and the Government to review progress at the end of the CPS period. Perhaps, 
given that this will be the first full assistance strategy in several years, the Bank might want to adopt a 
programmatic approach to its CPS. Following the model of programmatic lending and non-lending 
services, the CPS could formulate a broad, framework strategy for FY2012-2015, with a very defined 
assistance program for FY2012 and broader objectives and assistance plans and amounts for the 
subsequent years, flexibility with respect to instruments with a provision for yearly discussions and 
agreement in the context of yearly CPPRs, to adjust and reorient priorities to progress, results achieved 
and emerging priorities, against the Results Matrix.

a more 
inclusive 
development approach can be achieved 
by 
incorporating 
strategic elements 
targeting access for the poor. 
 Well-conceived

Resettlement Action Plan, Community 
Relations Program, and 
Indigenous 
Peoples Development Plan as part of 
any major infrastructure project are 
effective means

enhancing 
community participation and ensuring 
that the project’s interventions reach the 
most vulnerable. 
 It is important to keep the vision of a 
long-term strategic framework provided 
by the Master Plan. 
 Financial sustainability 
is still an 
important bottleneck for protected areas 
management. 
 The implementation of the Master Plan 
in a next phase should give priority to: 
i) support institutional development at 
various 
levels; 
ii) 
support 
administrative decentralization without 
hindering 
the development of 
the 
central

Bolivia's particular cultural and ethnic 
diversity; iv) ensure that conservation 
and sustainable use initiatives result in 
local benefits, and v) relate natural 
resource management 
to 
rural 
development.

Lessons learned: 

 The use of a project implementing unit 
not fully integrated in the ministry’s 
organization 
configuration 
can 
undermine its active involvement in 
project implementation 
 The use of Performance Agreements can 
be a useful tool to consolidate a results-
oriented culture. The use of revolving 
funds 
to manage 
the 
transfer of 
resources can also be a useful tool 
 It 
is 
important 
to address cultural 
barriers created by ethnic diversity in 
order 
to 
further 
improve 
health 
indicators. 

 The programmatic approach provided a

to 
improve 
its 
effectiveness, efficiency and transparency, 
and in particular to strengthen its capacity 
to 
implement economic and 
social 
development programs, and provide

Lessons learned: 

 The project strategy relied squarely on 
the 
strong 
leadership 
role 
of 
personalities, rather than placing the 
project within an institutionally strong 
agency. 
 Neither the project nor its specific 
reform elements were “marketed” (in 
spite of some budget for this) to those 
who might have been prepared to 
support it. 
 The ambitious project agenda made the 
implementation of 
some 
reforms

out 
elsewhere, 
causing

shortfalls in project progress. 
 Strong analytical work could have 
provided information about alternatives 
for reform and reduced the expectations 
generated by the project’s ambitious 
design. 
 It is extraordinarily difficult to compare 
the achievements (and failures) of the 
Institutional Reform Program 
to 
national 
reform efforts elsewhere, 
because public sector reforms are “soft” 
reforms specific to different national 
environments and difficult to categorize 
and quantify. 
 The strength of Bolivia’s approach has 
been to anchor its vertical reforms in a 
common set of rules to control political 
interference in the appointments of top 
managers and of civil servants. 
 The 
indicators faced methodological 
problems: 
a 
lack 
of 
baseline 
measurements; mistakes 
in baseline 
definitions; and a

Annex 3: Consultations with Civil Society, Women’s Organizations and the International 
Development Cooperation 

A consultative process was undertaken to inform the development of the CPS. Nine 
consultation workshops took place across Bolivia, three with civil society, three with women’s 
organizations and three with the Group of Partners for the Development of Bolivia (GruS). A 
total of 300 people participated. The workshops provided spaces to discuss themes linked to the 
results areas of the new CPS and facilitated an understanding of the challenges, priorities and 
obstacles to be considered. The participants included representatives from women’s indigenous 
and peasant organizations, the private sector, NGOs, productive organizations, municipal 
councils, departmental assemblies, youth groups, and women’s platforms and movements.  

I. Consultations with Civil Society: Debates and Recommendations 

A. 
Food crises, security and sovereignty in Boliviaa 
Food security and sovereignty. The participants regarded natural disasters as the root cause of 
lower food production and believed that they are compounded by other aspects ranging from a 
lack of incentives for production to road infrastructure problems. It was agreed that in order to 
secure viable and practical solutions, more reliable information is needed. Measures proposed 
include: food quality control; access to producer markets; supervision mechanisms; strengthened 
consumer protection; irrigation control to avoid contamination; quality services such as school 
breakfasts and subsidized prenatal care; bonds and financial support to microenterprises. It was 
also stressed that more support needs to be given to small producers, from land rights and input 
provision to training and loans for production and industrialization. 

The role of civil society. Participants detected problems with existing public policies, signaling 
that many initiatives are isolated and do not meet their mandates. To overcome this and assure 
that state food support measures reach the most vulnerable groups, they proposed effective social 
oversight. The participants also suggested that more information about food policies, projects 
and programs be made available to increase public awareness. 

B. 
Natural Resource Management and Social Inclusionb 
Need for clear policy. Worries exist over the legal reforms directed at the use of, access to and 
sustainable exploitation of forest resources. The participants argued that different laws contradict 
each other and that clear policies need to be developed to overcome these contradictions. 
Furthermore, while some participants believed that after the land rights and titling process 
changes started to appear in the consolidation of access rights to forests, others felt the changes 
merely exist on paper and have not been transferred into reality. They also identified the 
necessity of training in organizational strengthening as well as in adequate management of their 
resources to responsibly develop the region. They relayed that little information exists about the 
financing received from the international cooperation and the ways in which they invest their 
resources, and they called for more vigorous monitoring of investment projects.

Coordination between different levels of government and civil society to address climate 
change and secure the sustainable management of natural resources. It was considered that 
there is a lack of coordination between government levels and civil society on these issues. 
Moreover, local governorates in the Amazon region have not implemented concrete policies to 
minimize the effects of climate change and do not promote sustainable natural resource 
management. In this regard, the principle proposals were: that all government levels allocate 
resources to the prevention and relief of disasters resulting from climate change; encourage 
different sectors to formulate agreements and clear regulations regarding the use and sustainable 
exploitation of forest resources; a regional platform to raise public awareness about climate 
change and; investigations to prevent and mitigate the effects of climate change. 

Promoting the sustainable management of natural resources at all government levels. 
According to the participants, the promotion of sustainable natural resource management does 
not exist. They also considered that the land rights and titling processes in the Northern Amazon 
have not managed to prevent conflicts over the use and exploitation of natural resources.  

C. 
 Competitiveness and Productivityc  
This event took place in coordination with the Santa Cruz Chamber of Industries, Business, 
Services and Tourism (CAINCO) and discussed how to increase competitiveness in the country. 

External markets. Many participants signaled that the government should decide upon what 
activities they will promote, from small rural peasant enterprises, to medium or large size firms. 
They considered that the search for markets should be a joint effort between private firms and the 
public sector, but that the World Bank should also support.  

Legal security. The country’s lacking legal security and the need for a new investment law were 
discussed. Participants also signaled that they should be included in the discussion of new laws.  

Food sovereignty and security: Private firms in the agricultural sector signaled that the 
biotechnology and transgenic route must be taken to develop agriculture however there was a 
lack of understanding over how the government will handle this issue. They also raised that 
INRA does not adequately resolve land rights and title issues and identified contradictions with 
the Forest and Land Authority’s (ABT) policies, where at the same time ABT looks to reforest 
eroded zones and increase agricultural production, shrinking the area for reforestation programs.  

II. The Voices of Women in the Strategy 

A specific space was created to hear the voices of Bolivian women. The voice and active 
participation of more than a hundred women from various sectors in both urban and rural areas 
was crucial. These women’s workshops highlighted that the challenges of development cannot 
be confronted without the participation of women.  

Women and the new autonomy process. The participants discussed the absence of a gender 
focus in the Autonomy Statutes and Charters and argued that they do not include the agenda of 

c Santa Cruz 31, de mayo 2011.

women. Furthermore, they posed a series of challenges to increasing the participation of women 
in these autonomy statutes and charters as well as in municipal development plans and budgets. 

The participation of women in sustainable development. The women argued that the 
country’s strategic resources should be used to ensure national food security, emphasizing that 
food products should be produced and bought nationally. They believed that the government 
should provide more support to productive sectors to bring production costs down and to enable 
Bolivia to compete with its neighbors. The need for rural producers, particularly rural women 
producers, to better organize themselves was also addressed, as was the need for producers to 
receive training and gain qualifications to secure sustainable change. The Amazonian women 
highlighted that women have to be active in decision making; they represent half of the 
population and need to participate in decisions that affect them.  

III. Consultations with the development cooperation 

Three consultations were held with the international development community. These 
consultations provided the opportunity for the Bank to see where others perceive its comparative 
advantage and how to better coordinate efforts amongst development donors.  

The international community highlighted that the Bank should continue support towards the full 
implementation, as appropriate, of the Paris Declaration. They showed general support for the 
strong focus on sustainable productive development and stressed the need to have a stronger 
focus on urban productivity due to Bolivia’s rapid migration trend. The participants expressed a 
desire to know more about Bank experiences in rural development and for better coordination. 
The importance of the Bank in terms of its capacity to be able to introduce new environmental 
instrument such as “Green Accounting” and payment for environmental and the important role it 
could play in promoting private sector investments were highlighted. Finally, the participants 
perceived the regional PEFAs as an important and strategic support to Bolivia. Several donors 
expressed an interest in coordinating and supporting this process.

Annex 4: Development Assistance in Bolivia 

Bolivia is one of the biggest beneficiaries of 
development aid in Latin America. Aid from 
the international cooperation represents about 
10 percent of Bolivia’s GDP and 28 per cent 
of its public investment budget (Figure 1). 
Despite dependence on external resources 
having fallen since the 1990s, coordination 
between donors and with 
the Bolivian 
authorities is still necessary.

The Vice-Ministry of Public Investment and 
External Financing (VIPFE), part of the 
Ministry of Development Planning (MDP), 
handles the donor community in Bolivia. VIPFE is responsible for the identification and efficient 
and rational routing of donor resources, technical cooperation among developing countries, and 
promoting relations between the international cooperation and the Government. The Government 
has developed an action plan to improve the effectiveness of development cooperation, based on 
three axes: (i) effectiveness of aid, management and outcomes, (ii) capacity development on 
technical assistance, and (iii) regulatory framework.

The CAF has the greatest presence in Bolivia, followed by the IADB and the World Bank 
(Figure 2), and transactions with these three agencies represent approximately 75 percent of total 
external public financing. Bilateral financing represents less than 25 percent of external 
assistance and the percentage of assistance from traditional bilateral partners has diminished. 
Venezuela and Brazil are now the major bilateral cooperation partners (Figure 3).

To strengthen harmonization between international donors, in December 2006 the Partners 
Group for the Development of Bolivia (GruS) was created. The GruS includes all traditional 
bilateral and multilateral agencies, and has a rotating chair and coordinating and facilitating 
team. The GruS has agreed on a work plan with the MDP and the majority of members have 
aligned their cooperation to the National Development Plan and are working towards the 
implementation of the Paris Declaration and the Accra Action Plan.  

In recent years development aid has been directed towards operations in the transport, water, 
agricultural, communications, education, energy and multisectoral sectors. Aid to the transport 
sector has increased considerably. The water and sanitation, agricultural and multisectorial 
sectors are strongly supported by multilateral donors with some assistance from bilateral 
partnersojects are carried out largely on concessional terms or donations. International 
cooperation in the education sector is mainly composed of donations.
