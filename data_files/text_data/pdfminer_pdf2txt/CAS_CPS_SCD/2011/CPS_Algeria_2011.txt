EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

i. 
Algeria is well positioned today to fulfill its large economic potential, play a strategic role in the
region, and contribute to further economic integration between North Africa, Europe and the African
continent. The progress it has made over the past decades in human and infrastructure development, and its
important stock of energy and mineral resources, provide solid foundations to achieve this potential and bid
well for stronger and more diversified economic development.

ii. 
During the past ten years, Algeria has sustained growth and improved social equity through an
ambitious public investment program and market-oriented economic policies initiated earlier in the
decade. Substantial ground had been lost during the crisis that began in the mid 1980s, when low oil prices,
followed by political instability. This led to almost two decades of economic stagnation, slowing the
advancements Algeria had been experiencing since independence. In recent years, however, such trend has
been reversed. As the process of internal reconciliation took hold and the price of oil rebounded, the country
regained stability and the Government began implementing a series of large public investment programs in
infrastructure, housing and social development. These were accompanied by policies further opening up the
country to trade and private investment, building on significant market-oriented reforms carried out in the

1990s.

iii. 
Rapid economic growth over the last decade was driven by the combination of rising oil and
gas exports and prudent macroeconomic management. Active expenditure policy centered on increasing
public 
investment, 
improving 
social services and helping 
the disadvantaged, 
resulted 
in reduced
unemployment and poverty. These active fiscal policies, combined with low external debt and prudent
economic management have allowed Algeria to withstand the impact of the recent global crisis, in spite of
the drop in oil and gas revenues. The brisk pace of economic growth of the non-oil economy continued in
2009 and, despite the sharp drop in the current account position in 2009 during the crisis, the external
position remained strong with reserves equivalent to about 3 years of imports.

iv. 
Despite these achievements, Algeria continues to face major challenges in terms of economic
diversification and the creation of quality jobs. The global economic crisis has reminded Algeria of the
risks associated with excessive dependence on oil and the need to foster much stronger economic
diversification to generate employment for an increasingly skilled young population. Improvements in the
quality of public expenditure and significant reforms in the business environment are prerequisites to enable
such economic transformation and ensure better targeted public services, more effective social assistance
programs, and higher economic returns to public investments, especially in infrastructure. In addition,
Algeria needs to address growing environmental challenges and spatial disparities issues. The CPS program
aims to help the Government implement a program that will deal with these challenges and to support a
successful diversification strategy.

v. 
The Government's economic program for the period 2010-2014 continues to emphasize strong
public investment in infrastructure, housing and social services, together with job creation and
economic diversification as key pillars. The Government program also aims to improve the capacity of the
State and the effectiveness of its policies via more efficient public expenditure and strengthened policy-
making, planning and evaluation capacities. Following a reorientation of policy decisions away from
institutional reforms, driven by the oil windfall in the 90s, the Government has recently engaged in a series
of economic policies aiming at reducing the country's dependence on imports and supporting local economic
actors. Some of these policies include actively regulating foreign investment and foreign trade, partly
reversing the trade and investment openness stance that had been achieved earlier in the decade.

I

vi. 
The Government has asked the Bank to be a key partner in supporting Algeria's economic
development. Based on a long history of cooperation, the authorities value the contribution that the Bank
can make to the implementation of key aspects of their strategy and have requested that the Bank continues
to provide knowledge and advice in key sectors and to selected institutions. The CPS proposes to provide
assistance mainly through Fee-Based Services (Reimbursable Technical Assistance, RTA), supported by
selective Bank economic and sector work activities (AAA), supported through Trust Funds as feasible.

vii. 
The FY11-14 Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) responds positively to this request, building
on the lessons learned during the previous Country Assistance Strategy (CAS). The 2006 CAS Progress
Report and a 2007 QAG review of AAA activities confirmed the value of the Bank's knowledge products to
assist Algeria, including the use of RTAs, and recommended that such assistance be provided within a
consistent framework agreed with the Government. This CPS provides such a framework. The partners have
met periodically over the last two years and have agreed areas of engagement and identified a first set of
RTA operations under this new cooperation framework. The demand-driven nature of the program assures
alignment with Government priorities. Consultations and joint information sessions with civil society and
private sector operators have helped define and reconfirm these priorities.

viii. 
The focus of the Bank's action is on strengthening institutional capacity to support the
Government's overarching objective to increase job creation, through balanced and sustainable
economic growth and diversification. The CPS is developed around three strategic areas of engagement as
follows:

* 

* 

* 

Strengthening growth through diversification of the economy, including modernizing the
financial sector, supporting the implementation of the agricultural and rural development
strategy, and improving 
the 
investment climate, 
in particular for SMEs. This will
complement IFC's strategy, both in its investment and technical assistance activities, where
it has scaled up its engagement over the past years, especially in the financial sector area.

Promoting sustainable development and reducing spatial disparities, including technical
assistance to implement environment protection initiatives, as well as technical support to
Government initiatives that aim at reducing spatial disparities and ensuring balanced growth
across the country, such as the development of competitiveness centers in agro-industry and
other sectors.

Strengthening the institutions of economic planning, monitoring, evaluation and
policy-making, 
in particular by providing technical support to strengthen the planning,
monitoring and evaluation capacity of various sectors in the Government and their statistical
capacity, as well as the capacity to conduct impact evaluations of public interventions.

ix. 
The partners will regularly review and update the partnership program. To reflect on the
flexible nature of this CPS, the list of planned activities includes a set of confirmed (Tier 1) RTA and Bank-
funded activities, as well as a list of expected (Tier 2) activities that will be reassessed as the program
evolves. Within the framework of the agreed areas of engagement, the partners will meet annually to assess
progress in implementation and agree on follow-on operations. New RTAs would be included as they are
identified and budgeted by the Government. The selective use of Bank-funded technical assistance and sector
analysis will continue to allow the Bank to pursue policy dialogue on the reform agenda and to open new
avenues of cooperation. The timing of the reviews will take into account the budgetary approval cycle in
Algeria. To facilitate the dialogue and ensure the quality of its implementation the Bank is also scaling up its
presence in Algiers.

II

x. 
The collaboration between the Bank and Algeria will be one of the first based on a CPS resting
solely on knowledge services. 
It thus carries significant learning opportunities in its implementation and
offers potential to be replicated in other countries. Being strongly demand-driven and primarily client-
financed, the program carries a risk that its developmental impact be limited by the pace of implementation
of the Government's own program and reforms. To minimize these risks, the Bank and the Government have
put in place a process of systematic filtering of the requests to ensure that they fit in the Government's
strategic priorities, that they are sufficiently 
implementation-oriented, and that they carry significant
developmental impact potential. The CPS includes a tailored implementation Quality Monitoring Tool to
carefully track progress in results and outcomes. Finally, to cope with the implementation challenges of a
program based mostly on RTAs, the Bank's MENA region is putting in place additional procedures and
quality assurance measures to guarantee the high quality of these RTA products and to ensure uniformity in
the use of this instrument across the region.

xi. 

This CPS responds to the strategic choice of a Middle Income Country that is currently in no
need of borrowing but that chooses 
to maintain a strong partnership with the Bank based on
knowledge activities. Algeria is at a turning point in its economic development path. In addition to regaining
stability, it has achieved significant economic progress over the past years, raised living standards and
improved its infrastructure. Its main policy challenge for the coming years remains that of economic
diversification, productivity improvements and stronger job creation based on a new growth pattern that is
more immune to oil price volatility. Putting in place the right policy-mix to enable this will require anchoring
policy-making on solid knowledge and strong implementation, evaluation and institutional capacity. The aim
of this CPS is precisely to support the Algerian authorities in this endeavor.

INTRODUCTION

1. 
This document presents the Country Partnership Strategy between the World Bank Group and
Algeria for the period FY11 to FY14 1. This CPS seeks to accompany Algeria's continued efforts to put in
place the institutional basis for long-term economic development, diversify the economy to provide greater
employment opportunities to its young and increasingly educated population, and reduce environmental risks
and spatial disparities. The FY 11-FY14 CPS for Algeria represents an effort by the Bank to develop an
innovative and strategic partnership with a Middle Income Country (MIC), centered on knowledge products
and mostly based on Reimbursable Technical Assistance. No lending operation is included or expected
during this CPS, in line with the current Government policy not to engage foreign borrowing, but the Bank
could consider the resumption of lending within this strategy if the Authorities were to request it. This CPS
represents an opportunity for the Bank to engage with Algeria as a knowledge institution and could serve as
an example for other non-borrowing countries.

II. 

POLITICAL, ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENTS

2. 
Algeria is an important economic player in northern Africa and a key actor in regional economic
integration, particularly between Europe, the Maghreb region, and Sub-Sahara Africa. Algeria's sizeable
endowment of oil and gas, its large, young and growing population (35 million, growing at 1.5 % p.a.) and
the size of its GDP (US$161 billion in 2010), place the country as a solid middle income and the second
largest economy in the MENA region after Egypt. Its GDP per capita (at US$4,400 in 2010) is one of the
highest among non-GCC MENA countries. Algeria shares with the countries of the region several
challenges, starting with the need to generate employment and income for a young and increasingly educated
population. As for other oil producing countries, Algeria faces the challenge to diversify its economy,
especially in terms of non-hydrocarbon exports. Algeria is also important to the further integration of the
Maghreb region, and key partner to the European Union and the Sub-Saharan Africa region.

3. 

After a decade of political instability and economic stagnation, when Algeria suffered from violence
and heavily declining income, the country started to regain stability at the end of the 1990s. The drop in oil
prices in the mid-Eighties led to a long period of economic stagnation (Figure 1). Despite strong growth of
the global economy, the average annual growth rate of the non-oil sectors in the Nineties stood at 1%, in an
environment of rapid labor force growth. The decade of the 1990s was a period of deep political instability
where armed groups challenged the authority of the State. It was also a period of major economic reforms,
while public investment, especially in infrastructure, had to be reduced drastically. Early in the decade, the
authorities had undertaken a series of market-oriented reforms, ending control of most prices, opening-up
trade and investment, and gradually liberalizing the financial sector. These reforms led to the rise of a
dynamic private sector in the trade, services and, to a lesser extent, manufacturing sectors. Specific measures
in favor of private sector development included reduced fiscal pressure, simplification of fiscal procedures,
and development of infrastructure in particular in transport, and the introduction of new financial products,
such as leasing. However, because of the political instability of the 90s and a difficult business environment,
private investment's response to these reforms was insufficient to strengthen growth, compensate for the fall
in the oil economy, and create sufficient jobs to stop the rise of unemployment.

The previous CAS was presented to the Board in FY04 and a CAS Progress Report followed in FY06.

4. 
Algeria started the new century with a drastically different outlook from the previous decade,
offering hopes for catching-up with the "lost decade" of the 1990's and significantly improving standards of
living. As the process of internal reconciliation took hold and the price of oil rebounded, the country regained
stability and the Government started to implement a series of large public investment programs 
in
infrastructure, housing, agriculture and social development (education, social transfers and health). These
were accompanied with reforms further opening-up 
the country to trade and private investment and
strengthening macroeconomic management. Algeria implemented a reform agenda that included reforming
public enterprises, accession to WTO, improving the business environment, and overhauling institutions in
finance. It also initiated sectoral reforms in the telecoms, energy, water, transport and financial sectors. These
policies enabled rapid economic recovery, sustained growth and massive employment creation, especially
outside the hydrocarbon sector.

5. 
The rebound of oil markets since the late 1990s, offered the financial space for the Government to
follow a determined policy of reducing the level of external debt. The Algerian authorities developed and
implemented a strategy of curtailing new borrowing and repaying foreign loans in advance of maturity. As a
result, the level of foreign debt dropped from 41% of GDP in 2001 to around 2.8% of GDP in 2010. Of this,
only 1.3% of GDP was foreign public debt (US$2.1 billion by end of 2009). Declining fiscal revenues in
2009 forced Algeria to post its first fiscal deficit in a decade (-6.8% of GDP). Due to the rebound of
revenues, owing to higher hydrocarbon receipts, the fiscal deficit is estimated to have decreased by end of
2010 to -3.9% of GDP.

A. 

Recent Economic Developments and Medium Term Perspectives

6. 
Algeria's natural endowment of gas and oil determines in large part its economic outcomes. The
hydrocarbon sector accounted for 32% of GDP in 2009 (from 45% in 2008), provided 98% of its foreign
exchange receipts and financed around 57 % of total public spending (this amounted to 43 % of GDP). In
2009, Algeria was the fourth largest crude oil producer in Africa and the sixth largest natural gas producer in

2

the world (after Russia, the United States, Canada, Iran and Norway). Sonatrach, the State-owned
hydrocarbon company, is the largest African Oil and Gas Company, the 2nd largest LNG and LPG exporter
in the world, the 3rd largest natural gas exporter, and the 12th largest global Oil and Gas Company. The rise
in oil and gas prices, together with increasing production since 2001, have further increased the relative
weight of hydrocarbons in the economy. The value of oil and gas exports increased from around US$24
billion in 2003 to around US$79 billion in 2008, but it decreased to US$44 billion in 2009 during the global
crisis, highlighting the Algerian economy's vulnerability to oil price volatility. It increased again to US$56
billion in 2010.

7. 
The rapid increase of revenues from oil and gas over the past years allowed the Government to
finance an ambitious public investment program. In 2009, the Public Investment Program (PIP) 2 represented
close to half of public spending (46%), followed by personnel expenditures (21%), and social transfers
(19%). Despite the decrease in oil revenues in 2009, the Government did not scale down the implementation
of the PIP and was able to finance all its expenditures, including its commitment to raise the salaries of civil
servants, without resorting in any significant way to the Receipts Stabilization Fund. Seventy percent of the
PIP is allocated to housing, infrastructure, irrigation and education projects. The size of the capital budget
has put pressure on the implementing capacity of the Government and public agencies over the past years. As
a consequence, programs are often not fully implemented as planned and there are concerns about the
effectiveness of the investments. For the 2010-2014 periods, the Government has set as a priority to improve
the quality of all investment projects, and to strengthen the capacity of the State to appraise projects and
monitor their implementation.

The PIP, combined with strong growth of domestic demand, has been a major factor behind the
steady and rapid growth of the non-oil economy. The non-oil economy grew at a steady pace at an average of
5.8% p.a. between 2004 and 2008 (average annual growth for the whole economy was 3.5%), and jumped to
9.3% in 2009 thanks to an exceptional agricultural year, to decline again to 5.3% in 2010. This growth has
nevertheless been uneven across various sectors of the non-oil economy. Growth in the hydrocarbon sector
slowed down and has been negative since 2006, partly because of delays in the investment program in the

2009).

energy sector (See Figure 3). Fast growing sectors include services, construction, energy and water.
Agriculture has grown at 2% on average (2004-2008) and in 2009 alone it grew 18%. Manufacturing overall
has contracted; especially food processing and textiles (see Figure 4).

Despite the increase in domestic demand driven by the PIP and public wage increases, Algeria has
maintained a stable macroeconomic environment and inflation remains under control, although an increase
in the price offresh food led to higher inflation.
Inflation increased from 3.5% in 2007, to 4.9% 
in 2008 and 5.7% in 2009. In 2010, however,
inflation decreased to 4.3%. Substantial large 
current account surpluses have meant a rapid
increase in the level of international reserves, 
which stood at US$149 billion at end 2009 (or 
36 months of imports). The trend continued in
2010, 
the 
IMF 
is projecting 
international
reserves to total US$161 billion (or 37 months 
of imports). The exchange rate is a managed

The Impact of the Recent Crisis

10. 

The 2008/2009 global crisis affected Algeria mainly through the slump in oil prices, reducing the
flow of resources to the country and Government revenues. Similarly to other MENA countries, the global
crisis did not affect Algeria through the financial sector as this has limited linkages to the rest of the world.
Economic growth dropped to 2.4% in 2009 owing largely to the contraction of the hydrocarbon sector (-6%),
due to a drop in international prices as well as a reduction in crude oil production volumes. However, this
was counterbalanced by growth on the non-hydrocarbon sector. This grew at a robust 9.3% in 2009 - an
excellent harvest translated into high agriculture growth and the construction and service sectors expanded in
response to high public spending. Inflation remained under control even if supply issues in the agro industry
fueled fresh food price increases. Overall inflation reached 5 .7% at end-2009. Core inflation (excl. fresh
food) declined by 1.9% in 2009 reflecting the Bank of Algeria's efforts to absorb excess liquidity. Declining
fiscal revenues in 2009 forced Algeria to post its first fiscal deficit in a decade (6.8% of GDP).

11. 

As a result of declining demand and prices for petroleum, Algeria's external position dropped from a
current account surplus of 20.2 % of GDP in 2008 to a current account surplus of US$0.4 billion in 2009
(about 0.3% of GDP). With the reverse in oil prices this however again increased to US$13.4 billion in 2010.
This steep drop led the authorities to reinforce measures initiated already in 2008 aimed at reducing imports
and the amount of dividends transferred abroad by foreign investors present in Algeria. Such measures
seemed to have had effect on the trade balance, which increased from US$7.8 billion in 2009 to US$19.7
billion in 2010. Exports, however, saw a drastic decline of 43% with the slump in international oil prices.
Because Algeria still holds a large stock of foreign exchange reserves, the country's external position
remains strong. With the strengthening of international oil prices, the IMF is forecasting a current account
surplus of 8.5 % of GDP in 2010.

Medium to Long-term Prospects4

12. 
The medium-term outlook remains positive, supported by rising commodity prices, but the challenges
of economic diversification and sustained job creation for the educated and young labor force remain severe.
Short of an economic transformation built on stronger private investment growth and diversification of the
industrial and exports base, the challenges faced by Algerian society are likely to remain severe. Also,
reducing economic and spatial disparities, protecting the environment and securing scarce water resources
will continue to be a challenge for Algeria as its population and economy grow.

13. 
Fiscal policy will remain expansionary in 2010-2014, keeping Algeria's fiscal position in deficit for
the medium term. Reserves accumulated over the years and hydrocarbon revenue prospects should provide
the fiscal space to pursue the new Public Investment Program (PIP) for 2010-14. The 2010 budget projects a
reduction of 2 percentage points of the fiscal deficit with a reference oil price of US$ 37 per barrel5 . Current
expenditures increased by 31% in 2010 mostly due to increases in public salaries and maintenance costs
related to the infrastructure financed through the new PIP, with new hiring of about 60,000 civil servants and
higher wages and maintenance costs. The Government plans to continue its policy of significant investment
in infrastructure and social programs over the medium term, while pursuing a certain degree of fiscal
consolidation in order to reach a surplus of 2.6 % GDP in 2014 .

6

14. 
Algeria's economic perspectives continue to be tightly linked to the evolution of oil and gas prices,
the expansion of hydrocarbon production and expected reserves. The high levels of public expenditure

associated with the PIP, salaries increases, as well as the investment plans of Sonatrach will continue to be
feasible only in the context of high prices of oil and gas. The IMF estimates that the non-oil economy will
continue to grow in the short-term (5.3% 
in
2010). In the medium term, current estimates 
of oil price trends ensure that the 2010-2014 
PIP and Sonatrach's investment plans can be

sustained. The hydrocarbon sector growth rate 
is expected to average 0.6% over that period, 
compared to 5.2% for the non-hydrocarbon 

economy. The external financial position of
the country should remain sound (oil is over 
two 
thirds of the energy exports of the

country, due to substantial foreign exchange 
reserves. 

15. 

With high extraction rates and 

average hydrocarbon reserves relatively low 

compared to other oil-rich countries, the need

to diversfy its economy and prepare for the 
"post-oil" era is pressing for Algeria. The 

reserves to production ratio for crude oil and 
natural gas are now estimated at 16.7 years 

and 52.1 years respectively8 . Figure 7 shows
how the reserves to production ratio in Algeria 
is similar to that of Syria and far less than in
Nigeria or Libya, as Algeria seems 
to be 

following a rapid extraction policy.

growing at a steady pace, there are concerns about the content of this growth and its susta inability. Effective

diversification and stronger private sector growth are essential to sustain growth in the medium term and to

generate employment and income opportunities for the rapidly growing labor force. Even if the recent

growth performance is relatively strong, the nature of sectoral growth in the non-hydrocarbon sector needs to

change to enable the Algerian economy to generate enough quality jobs and to sustain growth rates that are
more immune to oil price shocks. High labor force growth (3% per year) adds additional pressure and
requires reforms that elicit a strong private sector response to generate the quality employment and income
opportunities that the country needs. So far, growth has taken place mostly in sectors of low value added,
generating unskilled, low-paying jobs. While unemployment dropped significantly, it remains high among
women, the youth and the educated, and there is a significant mismatch between demand and supply of labor.
Also, growth has been strong mostly in sectors directly linked to the PIP (like construction), raising doubts
about its sustainability. The ability of the Algerian economy to generate productivity 
increases and
endogenous growth in the medium term remains a challenge. (Figure 8)

broad guideline.

17. 

The increase in oil and gas revenues over the decade did not contribute sufficiently to the necessary
transformation of the economy, reducing incentive for further institutional and market-oriented reforms that
the authorities had envisaged at the beginning of the decade. The institutional reforms and improvements to
the business environment that the Authorities had introduced in the early 90s were delayed, with a negative
impact on the pace of the transition towards a market economy and on the development of private
investments. The decision to allocate very substantial resources earned from the oil windfall to the public
budget eventually shifted policy priorities

structural, market-oriented
reforms

to reduce vulnerability to oil price volatility, and be able

improvements and competitiveness 
in world markets. The business and 
institutional
environments affecting incentives of investors should be improved significantly, while continuing to invest
in infrastpcture and by a reduction in fiscal pressure which could not, by themselves, attract private
investments. Faster progress in enhancing the investment climate is needed to increase private investment, in

8

particular FDI, foster more competition and raise productivity, especially among small and medium
enterprises. Looking forward, these reforms should benefit from much higher priority.

20. 
So far, these structural improvements to the investment climate have not progressed as envisaged
since priority attention was given to the implementation of the public investment programs. The necessary
institutional and business-enabling reforms were high on the Government's agenda during the first part of the
decade, and progress was made in some areas. But the reform momentum weakened with the rise of oil
prices as priority was given to delivering the public investment programs and improvement of services to
citizens (social housing, education, water, energy and health). Both the reform of State-owned enterprises
and privatization programs made little progress. As did regulatory simplification, the reform of the
commercial legal framework, industrial land reform and State-owned banks reform. To achieve sustained
diversified growth Algeria should de-link economic reform from the availability of hydro-carbon resources.

21. 
The impact of the recent shift in economic policies towards greater regulation of imports and FDIs,
favoring explicitly local investors, remains unclear. Over the past two years, the Government has enacted
economic measures that partly reverse previous measures in favor of trade and investment openness. The
new measures aim at reducing dependence on imports and strengthening local economic actors by more
actively regulating foreign investment and foreign trade. There has also been an increased reliance on State-
owned enterprises and public financial investment instruments to spur local investment and diversification.
These new policies include: a limit of 49% ownership by foreign investors for all new FDI projects, with the
option of maintaining management under the foreign partner; a preemption right of the Government in sales
of FDI shares; the obligation for every FDI project to maintain a positive foreign exchange transfer balance
over the life of the project (the cumulated outflows of dividends by FDI firms should be less than the
cumulated inflows of cash invested), making it less profitable for a foreign investor to invest in Algeria,
unless it exports a significant share of its production; preferential treatment to local firms in public
procurement contracts, with the price advantage for local bidders increased in 2010 from 15% to 25%.
Additionally, resorting to international bidding is made more difficult when local producers are available and
adjustments were made to the regulatory framework for trade, including the obligation to use the letter of
credit as the exclusive payment instrument.

22. 
The impact of these measures in Algeria is as yet unclear, but international experience shows that
short of deeper reforms of the business environment, the development of local firms, especially SMEs, will
remain constrained and the positive impact the Government expects out of these new policies is unlikely to
materialize. Similar policies in other countries have often proven to be counterproductive when they lack
complementary measures. For instance, favoring local firms and fostering local investments is unlikely to be
reached if the pressing reforms of the business environment are not put in place, in particular in the areas of
regulatory simplification, industrial land market reform, financial sector reform and the strengthening of the
regulatory institutions implementing and enforcing the rules. Furthermore, progress in strengthening non-oil
exports will require lowering logistics costs, which in Algeria are higher than in other MENA countries
despite efforts to improve infrastructure'o

C. 

Social and Vulnerability Outlook

23. 

Social indicators have steadily improved over the five decades since independence, thanks to rising
incomes and significant public investments in education and health. Algeria is well on its way to meet the
MDG targets with particularly strong gains in poverty reduction, universal education, and greater gender
equality. Steady progress also continues to be made in improving health indicators and reducing the spread of
HIV/AIDS. Still, Algeria ranks 104th among 182 countries in the United Nations Human Development
Index11 . The 2010-2014 PIP includes an increased focus on health sector investments compared to previous
plans. While there has been major progress towards gender equality in many areas, Algeria is still lagging
behind other middle income countries in terms of women's economic and political empowerment, according
to the United Nations 2009 Gender Empowerment Measure (GEM)1 2 . In terms of political representation in
Government, women held only 7.7% of seats in the national parliament in 2009. The 2009 Constitutional
provisions, that include measures to promote female political participation and representation, should
improve the situation in the medium-term.

24. 
Poverty rates have come down from the high levels of the 1990s. The poverty rate has fallen from
14.1 % in 1995 to 12.1 % in 2000, and is expected to have declined further over the last decade as incomes
and employment rose significantly1 3 . Algeria is close to the eradication of extreme poverty. Poverty
incidence depth and severity are more pronounced in rural areas. In 2008, the number of rural poor was
estimated at around 10.5% of the population. The highest incidence of poverty is among people in
mountainous areas in the northern part of the country (Hauts Plateaux) and in the South Saharan region-
two regions that benefit from significant public investment plans with the objective to reduce spatial
disparities.

25. 
Unemployment in Algeria has been decreasing steadily from 29% in 2000, to 15.3% in 2005, and
10.2% at the end of 2009 (Figure 10)14 . However, unemployment among women and the youth remains
quite high (Figure 11). Also, the skills mismatch between the opportunities provided by the market and the
supply of labor is a source of growing dissatisfaction among the educated youth.

11 HDI measures three aspects of human development: (1) health measured by life expectancy; (2) education (measured by adult
literacy and gross enrolment in education); and (3) standard of living (measured by purchasing power parity, PPP, income).
12 GEM tracks the share of seats in parliament held by women; of female legislators, senior officials and managers; and of female
professional and technical workers- and the gender disparity in earned income, reflecting economic independence.
13 A nationally-representative household survey will be launched by end of 2010, which will provide more recent estimates of the
poverty rate.

Algeria's education system has made impressive gains since independence. Primary education is
universal and upper secondary and higher education enrollment rates have increased over time. Despite high
expenditures on education, representing approximately 6% of GDP and 19% of Govermment outlays over the
past decade, quality and alignment with the labor market demands need improvement. Gender gaps in
educational enrollment have closed at primary, secondary, and tertiary levels, with women outnumbering
men at the university level. However, educated women suffer higher rates of unemployment.

27. 
Algeria's healthcare system has achieved impressive results in terms of access to services and
improvement in health indicators. Geographic access to health facilities stands at 98% of the population and
the whole population has financial coverage for health care services. Life expectancy increased from 53.5 in
1970 to 74 years in 2008. Child mortality decreased from 134 per 100,000 in 1980 to 30 in 2008. In terms of
gender equality, Algeria performs better than other countries in the region with respect to health indicators.
Fertility rates declined dramatically from 4.6 births per woman in 1990 to 2.4 births per woman in 2007,
which is lower than the MENA average. This is primarily due to the sharp increase in the average age of
marriage to 26 and the contraceptive prevalence rate (61% in 2006 compared to 47% in 1992). Maternal
mortality rate is now 180 deaths/100,000 live births, which is lower than the MENA average. The financial
sustainability of the health system is, however, weakened by extensive benefits, inefficiencies in service
provision, high cost of pharmaceuticals, and changing composition of illnesses due to health transition. In
addition, the absence of a monitoring and evaluation system and critical data for decision-making makes it
difficult to develop a sound national health strategy. The Government has started to address these short-
comings and is planning to invest substantively in capacity building for its human resources and in
infrastructure.

28. 

Algeria has a comprehensive social protection system including social insurance programs, active
labor market policies, and social assistance programs. Social safety net programs are a key component of
Algeria's strategy to combat poverty and protect vulnerable population groups. Yet, they have evolved as ad-
hoc transfers/subsidies with unclear mandates, arbitrary financing mechanisms, and weak management.
There are also concems that the active labor market policies (self-employment support, business creation
subsidies, training programs, wage subsidies and public works) are not as effective as intended. The

11

Government is currently strengthening its capacity to better evaluate such policies-a first step towards the
development of an integrated, modem framework of social protection.

D. 

Algeria's Regional Engagement

29. 
Algeria has historically been an active and central player in regional issues, particularly in Africa
and the Arab World. It is a founding member of the NEPAD and is very active in the African Union on both
economic and political issues. It is also a founding member of the Arab Maghreb Union, which has recently
seen an increase in cooperation between the five member countries. Its strategic geographical location in the
Mediterranean connecting Europe with Africa, and political stance as a partner in global peace and security
initiatives makes it an important partner in various international fora. An Association Agreement (AA) with
the European Union has been effective since 2005, representing the continued strategic importance attached
by Europe to Algeria for its close historical and cultural ties, strategic source of energy and as an important
ally in international security. The AA aims at a free trade zone between Algeria and the EU by 2017.

30. 

With the return of internal stability at the end of the nineties, Algeria returned actively to the
international arena and spearheaded a number of regional initiatives aiming at increasaing economic
intergration in the Maghreb and with Sub-Saharan Africa. Recent projects and initiatives that reflect this
regional re-engagement include:

* 

* 

* 

* 

The soon-to-be-completed 1,216 km-long East-West highway project which connects Algeria
to the east with the Tunisian border and to the west with the Moroccan border and links up to
the highway networks of both countries. A parallel project in the rail sector should double the
capacity of the East-West railway line. In the longer-term, Nouakchott will be linked to
Tripoli by a continuous web of highways across the five countries of the Arab Maghreb
Union.
In energy, a 400 kV electric line between Algeria and Morocco was inaugurated in 2009,
adding to existing two lower-power lines and lines connecting with Tunisia and Libya.
Ultimately, the goal is to foster the development of a regional electricity market with
interconnections to Europe's grid.
On the North-South side, the Algiers-Lagos road through Niger is completed for the Algeria
and Nigeria parts. A pipeline and fiber-optic line is planned to be installed parallel to the
Algiers-Lagos axis (NEPAD initiative).
Another example of Maghreb-wide initiatives was the 2010 launch at a Maghreb ministerial
meeting in Algiers of the Maghreb Investment Bank with headquarters in Tunis.

To foster its integration to global markets, Algeria has made great strides in opening-up to foreign trade
and foreign investment, even if the recent economic policies partly reverse these achievements. Algeria's
main international anchors to trade liberalization are its Association Agreement with the European Union
and its 2005 membership of the Pan-Arab Free Trade Agreement (PAFTA). Advancing towards WTO
accession can be another important catalyst to improving competitiveness, though the process has been
stalled for some years as negotiations on points like the pricing of natural gas for local industry continue to
be difficult. Independently of its international trade agreements, Algeria has significantly reduced tariffs
over the past decade and has opened its economy to trade and FDI, before partially reversing these polices
during the past two years. The expected impact of trade liberalization on the local economy of these
measures is yet to materialize, explaining in part the recent policy reversals, as openness is perceived as not
having delivered on its promises.
THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM AND IMPLEMENTATION CHALLENGES

III. 

12

31. 

After the Presidential election of April 2009, the Government announced a new five-year program
which focused around three themes: (1) promoting economic development by focusing on infrastructure
investments and economic diversification policies, (2) improving services to citizens, access to housing and
human development, particularly in health and education, while reducing spatial disparities and mitigating
the environmental impact of growth, and (3) strengthening good governance and the institutional basis for
economic growth.

32. 

To create the necessary conditions for economic development, the Government agenda seeks to: (i)
reform and modernize the justice system and the public administration; (ii) decentralize decision-making and
strengthen local authorities, in the context of the roll-out of a regional and urban planning master plan; (iii)
further develop physical infrastructure and improve citizens access to housing, water, energy and basic
services; and (iv) improve of the capacity of the State as a regulator of economic activity and pursue the
modernization of the financial sector.

33. 

To foster economic diversification, the Government plans to implement a series of sector-specific
strategies, in particular in agriculture and agro-industry, tourism, mining and energy, ICT (e-Algeria) and
selected manufacturing sectors. In addition, the strategy includes cross-sectoral support to small and medium
enterprises and the development of innovation and entrepreneurship. The authorities emphasize that no
economic diversification is possible without developing human capital and maintaining national solidarity. It
hence gives particular attention to further improvement in education, housing conditions, health and
education, food and energy security, and social protection programs.

34. 

The vision of the Government is anchored on self-standing sector strategies, some of which are
already under implementation. These include: agriculture, environment, industry, and e-Algeria. In addition,
the Government is considering articulating a comprehensive diversification strategy that builds on the
evaluation of achievements under the current initiatives and seeks to benefit from the synergy across the
various interventions. The Council of Ministers approved the PIP for 2010-2014 in May 2010 for US$286
billion equivalent. The PIP finances 
investments 
in support of infrastructure development, human
development, the knowledge economy and employment generation via economic diversification. Investments
for on-going projects carried over from the previous five-year plan will amount to US$130 billion (including
ongoing investment projects in roads and railway development, education and university facilities, health
facilities, housing, household connections to the natural gas and electricity networks, water supply network
improvements and dams, desalination plants, and youth and sports facilities). Financing of new projects
amount to US$156 billion and will be targeted to infrastructure development (road and railway networks,
ports, public transportation, airport infrastructure, local services); economic diversification through support
for SMEs, industrial parks, entrepreneurship and innovation and access to credit; and improved access to
basic services for citizens (health, water, education, etc.) and human capital development (knowledge
economy, universities, research and development).

35. 
The authorities acknowledge that the implementation of the Government program faces important
challenges, and significant emphasis has been put into strengthening policy design and project
implementation capacities. A dedicated institution has been put in place to this effect the National Fund for
Infrastructure and Development (CNED in French) and the prerogatives of existing oversight institutions
have been strengthened, most notably the General Inspectorate of Finances. Implementation of the
government program also faces the challenges of policy coordination; preparing for the implications of
growth and economic transformation in terms of widening spatial disparities and environmental degradation;
and, finally, improving the quality of planning and evaluation functions of the government. These three key
areas of policy-making will be central in the success of the overall government program. It is precisely in
these three areas that the Bank will focus its support during the course of the CPS.

13

36. 

Enabling the structural transformation of the economy requires strong inter-agency coordination to
implement a complementary set ofpolicies to improve the investment climate. The thrust of that effort should
seek to facilitate doing business in Algeria-in particular in the areas of regulatory environment, banking
reform, industrial land markets and opening-up new spaces for private investment, in services in particular,
and a reinforcement of the institutional framework in support of economic policies. The regulatory functions
of the State will need to be strengthened; the administration providing services to firms and investors will
need to be further upgraded (customs, export support agency, tax authority, investment agency); the policy-
making framework will need to be reinforced (consultation processes, planning and evaluation functions,
information systems and statistics); the capacity to implement proactive 
interventions (like industrial
strategies or export support schemes) will need to be improved in terms of effectiveness, evaluation and
accountability; and market institutions (like the judiciary or regulatory agencies) should be made more
effective and independent.

37. 

Sustained growth and economic transformation have implications in terms of spatial disparities and
the environment that need to be addressed. The vision of a more equitable Algeria requires reducing spatial
disparities and ensuring a sustainable development path. In addition to the persistent water scarcity issue,
Algeria increasingly faces environment challenges given the rapid urbanization of the country and the strong
growth rates over the past decades. Also, disparities between urban and rural areas and across the various
regions of the country remain an issue, and these may widen unless proactive policies are put in place in the
context of the Regional Planning Master Plan 2020 (SNAT in the French acronym). In addition, Algeria is
vulnerable to natural shocks, having experienced severe earthquakes within the last decades, as well as
flooding. The country has developed strategies in these areas and faces now the challenge of implementation.

38. 

Finally, the planning and evaluation functions of the Government need to be strengthened to ensure
better policy design as well as effective monitoring and evaluation of policies that are being implemented.
The effectiveness and the development impact of the two sizeable public investments plans launched since
2001, remain to be evaluated beyond their impact on unemployment and growth outside of hydrocarbons (as
the 2008 PER pointed out, the PIP lacks for the most part a strategic Results Matrix). In addition, sector
strategies are the responsibility of Ministries and state agencies that are concerned and dependent on the
initiative they take. Coordination across sectors needs to be improved. Effective public institutions are also
central for the success of any economic diversification strategy. This calls for improving the evaluation
capacity in order to better assess the programs, realign their priorities, if needed, and correct, or cease, failing
interventions and ineffective investments. In response to these challenges, the Government is implementing
numerous policies and interventions that merit careful monitoring and evaluation, in particular trade and
investment policies, interventions to support SMEs, innovation and selected industrial sectors, and social
transfers. In support of its policy planning and evaluation functions, the Government is also strengthening its
statistical capacity.

IV. 

LESSONS FROM THE RECENT WORLD BANK GROUP ENGAGEMENT IN ALGERIA

The availability of substantial additional oil revenues had a fundamental impact on 

39. 
implementation of the FYO4-06 CAS. First, the rapid increase in the price of oil and gas, and the ensuing
increases in revenues, led the authorities to implement a non-borrowing policy and to cancel existing debt.
Hence, no new Bank lending took place during the previous CAS period and most of the operations under
implementation were cancelled or their size reduced ahead of closing. With no lending operations feasible
and no RTA yet in place, the opportunities for cooperation with the different sectors became very limited.
Moreover, the Government launched a large Public Investment Program which required increased attention
of sectoral ministries on its design and its implementation. The focus and drive for institutional and
regulatory reforms hence decreased in most sectors.

the

40. 
Despite these unexpected changes, the CAS program made notable contributions, in part because the
Government continued to implement using its own budget resources, projects that had been started under the
CAS and for which the IBRD loans were later cancelled. The CAS program had a positive impact in the

financial sector, in rural development, in telecommunications, and in the water sector. In these areas, the
Government continued implementing the program envisaged under the CAS through its own budget. Support
was also provided through technical assistance, some of which were later on financed by the Government
using the RTA instrument. Other partners, particularly the European Commission, financed programs that
had been planned in the CAS or designed with Bank support, for example in education and privatization. IEG
rated as satisfactory or moderately satisfactory seven operations completed during the CAS period, despite
substantial cancellations. These operations 
include 
the financial sector, 
telecommunications, 
rural
development, industrial pollution, mortgage market development and post-earthquake reconstruction. Only
one project was pursued until the end of the CAS period-the public expenditure management project-, but
its highly ambitious initial design had to be revised at mid-term. The ICR rated this project as moderately
unsatisfactory as it only partly delivered the results expected after restructuring. The 2004 CAS fell short of
expectations in the energy and transport sectors, where the agenda supported proved excessively ambitious,
even under the most propitious of circumstances (IEG rated two projects in these areas as unsatisfactory).

41. 

The CAS Progress Report (2006) foresaw a shift of strategy that took time to implement. In response

to the policy stance of the Government on foreign debt, the CAS Progress Report suggested to broadly
maintain the areas of engagement, but emphasized delivery through non lending instruments, such as
reimbursable technical assistance and Bank financed advisory services and studies. In the remaining years of
the CAS implementation up to today, the authorities and the Bank attempted to develop new modalities of
engagement. This helped the partners come to an operational understanding of the RTA instrument and of the
circumstances under which this is likely to be most effective. These include the provision of complementary
AAA, a committed Bank team that maintains continued presence, a strong and capable counterpart, and a
multiannual framework of cooperation. Since 2004, the Bank and the Government have signed seven RTA
contracts and all have been completed. (Table 1)

42. 
Notwithstanding the difficult operating environment for the private sector, IFC has been able to
increase its program in Algeria over the previous CAS period. A key lesson is the value of having a strong

local presence and dedicated business development teams on the ground. If some of the key impediments to
private sector growth are removed, IFC, with its decentralized structure, is in a position to increase its
advisory and investment program to help unleash the potential of the private sector in Algeria.

43. 
Continued engagement in Algeria should be driven by the pace of progress set by the authorities, in
order to maintain realistic expectations. A 2007 QAG assessment of Algeria's AAA activities provided a
first stock-taking of the RTA approach, which the CAS Completion Report confirmed. A lesson learnt is that
the Bank can have positive contributions in Algeria, but that expectation of broad impact should be tamed
and replaced by a precise description of the outcomes of the engagement, the complementary work to be
carried out by the authorities, and the impact that both can jointly deliver. The overall slow pace of reform
reflects the difficult transition from planned to market economy, and the disincentive that large hydrocarbon
revenues play on the reform momentum. Providing timely technical advice of high quality - with no pre-
conceived solutions or dogmatic stance - in response to clear demands by the authorities is the most likely
route to have impact.

44. 
Fee-based services supported by selective Bank-financed analytical work has proved to offer the
flexibility and timeliness to respond to Government's requests for advice and to adapt to the pace of reforms
and changing priorities. The overall conclusion is that the RTAs have contributed to: (i) maintaining an
active dialogue with sectoral partners; (ii) providing technical assistance to support the Government reform
agenda; and (iii) complementing larger Government programs with high level advice. This experience
indicates that despite the limited financial scope of the RTA instrument, when a strategic selection of the
areas of intervention is made, RTAs can have a large impact and help leverage the Government's reform
agenda.

45. 
The filtering of activities conducted jointly by the Government and the Bank will have to remain in
place throughout CPS implementation to ensure selection of priority actions included in the Government's
program and supported by counterpart teams. Implementation of RTA programs so far shows that
effectiveness depends on the support, quality, and continuous engagement of the local teams, as sporadic
interventions have not produced results. The success of the RTA approach will however depend on the extent
to which there is ex-ante clarity between the Bank and the Government, and within the Bank, on the
relevance of the action, the objectives of the interventions, the success indicators, and the method of
execution. Another lesson is that the Bank should subject all tasks to a quality enhancing and control process
to ensure delivery of quality products, and should keep expectations realistic.

46. 
Despite the limited opportunities afforded by the RTA instrument, which is demand driven by nature,
the Bank can still maintain a pro-active position. The Bank can play an active advocacy role in various ways.

16

As a key knowledge institution, it can provide access to research and best practice in the design and delivery
of policy reforms in similar contexts around the world. The Bank can also play an active role in linking
Algeria to regional and global initiatives.

V. 

COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY

47. 
An intense dialogue between the Algerian authorities, led by the Ministry ofFinance, and the World
Bank Group in the course of 2009 and 2010 has identified the core areas of engagement for the CPS. The
dialogue has served to fill the gap in information arising from the limited presence of the Bank in the country
and has contributed to a solid appreciation of the Government's strategic objectives, program designs and
implementation plans. This was necessary to articulate the CPS areas of intervention over a four-year span.

48. 
The main instrument to support the Government's program will be the RTA, complemented by
selected analytical products financed by the Bank budget. The CPS describes the areas of intervention and
the activities that are under discussion, while recognizing that the flexible nature of the Bank's engagement
means that these activities still require time to be defined in scope, timing and budget. Dialogue between the
partners during implementation of the CPS will continue to identify new RTA operations, within the
framework set by this CPS. The Results Matrix (RM) reflects only RTA and other activities (defined as Tier
1 activities in Appendix la) that are already well defined and that have been firmly agreed and budget. The
list of Tier 2 activities (Appendix lb) remains to be confirmed and further developed. It will be updated
regularly as new needs arise and priorities are reassessed. Outcomes and indicators will be defined for these
activities as they move to the Tier 1 category.

49. 
The CPS Results Matrix has been adjusted to circumstances where the program is small, AAA
intensive and focused mostly on institution building. The September 2009 CAS Retrospective highlighted the
challenges of designing and tracking Results Matrices in such instances where the Bank program is small and
limited to AAA". 
In these circumstances, not only are the outcomes of the technical assistance hard to
specify but the link between the technical assistance and the final development outcomes is heavily
dependent on the timing and scope of the Government's efforts. Claims of attribution can be difficult to
justify. In addition, in the case of Algeria, the focus of the CPS program lies in part on capacity building at
the institutional level, which makes it inherently hard to measure. This CPS recognizes these challenges and
addresses them by, first, identifying the expected output (intermediate indicators) of each confirmed activity
and the link with the corresponding Government institutional building program. Second, the Government and
the Bank teams will monitor implementation progress in each of the areas of engagement under the CPS.
Lastly, completion reports of each RTA activity will be prepared to assess the evaluation of the contribution
of the program to the development efforts of the country under each results area.

A. 

The Principles for World Bank's Engagement

50. 
The CPS program consists of analytic, advisory and technical assistance activities aimed at the
implementation of the Government program. As Algeria plans to continue its policy of maintaining low
external debt and does not plan to borrow during the period of the CPS, the country proposes to channel
Bank support mainly through the modality of RTA, supported by the Bank administrative budget and by
Trust Fund resources, to the extent that these can be made available to Algeria.

51. 
Responsiveness, coherence, and selectivity are the guidance principles of the Bank's action under
this CPS. While the experience in Algeria and within the Bank with fee-based services is not new, RTAs will

15 Country Assistance Strategies: Retrospective and Future Directions OPCS, September 1, 2009.

17

in the future be developed within the strategic framework provided by the CPS. The Bank will respond to the
demands of assistance by the authorities selectively and take into account its own capacity to deliver. The
Government, the Ministry of Finance in particular, will filter demands from the sector ministries and
agencies to make sure that the RTAs proposed to the Bank are aligned with the national agenda, are
budgeted, and are included in the multiannual Government program. Under the CPS it is planned to employ a
standard RTA model contract which will reflect experience in implementing RTAs in Algeria so far. This
model has been developed over the course of the CPS preparation, in consultation with the government
stakeholders. Its objective is to offer a standard, ready-to-use model contract, to avoid the need for lengthy
negotiations for each individual RTA activity.

52. 
The Bank will strategically use its own funds to complement the program in various ways. First,
Bank budget will be used to deliver timely technical support in priority areas, while the corresponding RTAs
come into place. Second, the Bank can use its own resources to explore new areas of engagement, propose
reform strategies, or conduct diagnostic and evaluation work of strategic importance, for which RTA
resources have not been budgeted or would not be appropriate. The Bank will also use Trust Funds, where
feasible. Under the more strategic framework permitted by the CPS, Algeria will have the opportunity to
participate in global and regional initiatives. These include, among others, the global programs supported by
the Marseille Center for Mediterranean Integration, the Mediterranean concentrated solar power initiative
(CSP), infrastructure and trade studies, and activities developed under the Arab World Initiative. Algeria can
make important contributions to these initiatives with its experience in energy and human development.

B. 

Consultation and Partnership

53. 
The preparation of the CPS benefited from a long and careful process of consultations with
Government counterparts and stakeholders. The extensive discussions with Government stakeholders were
coordinated by the Ministry of Finance, and involved three phases. Initially, most sector representatives were
invited to information sessions where the CPS process and its main financing instrument, in particular the
RTA, were discussed in detail. These included sector-specific discussions to assess the needs and the
potential areas of collaboration. During a second phase, every sector proposed a list of activities and topics
that could be the object of RTA support for inclusion under the CPS. Bank sectoral teams consulted every
Ministry to identify the technical areas where the Bank had comparative advantage, where the proposed
assistance would have most impact and would be the most relevant to Algeria's strategic objectives. Finally,
Bank teams and sector-ministry teams had numerous sessions to define more precisely the content of the
assistance in each area that was selected to be part of the CPS.

54. 
Formal consultations with civil society, private sector representatives, think tanks and academia
were held in February 2010, with the objectives of- (i) informing the CPS preparation process with a deeper
understanding of Algeria's development challenges; (ii) sharing with non-Governmental organizations and
civil society representatives the content of the proposed collaboration with the Government of Algeria; and
(iii) collecting feedback on the relevance of the program. In addition to this formal one-day event,
consultations took place over the past year, where think tanks, entrepreneurs, academia, press representatives
and other civil society members were regularly invited at numerous gatherings to discuss the current
Government strategies, the development challenges that Algeria faces and the policy gaps. The key lessons
that can be drawn from these consultations can be summarized as follows:

(i) 

The areas of intervention proposed by the CPS program are in line with what both
Government and civil society think needs to be strengthened, even if their respective views
on current policies differ. All agree on the need to diversify the economy and strengthen
growth, in particular in sectors like agriculture, industry and tourism. Improved policy
formulation and evaluation capacity, including statistical capacity and better information

18

sharing, 
is also a theme that was repeatedly highlighted as a priority during these
consultations.

(ii) 

(iii) 

Private sector representatives are mostly critical of the current economic policies related to
investment and trade. While many would like to see a number of current policies reversed,
all insist on the need to strengthen the capacity to evaluate policies in order to inform future
policy changes when they're warranted. The agreed activities in the business environment
area of the CPS respond to these shared concerns: support to policy evaluation, technical
assistance work to improve the regulatory environment, and review of enterprise support
policies all respond to the need of a pragmatic, evidence-based analytical support to the
authorities.

The quality of the exchanges during all consultations reflects positively on the level of
openness possible in Algeria, in public policy debates. The variety of views expressed
publicly on the Government's economic policies represents an important and useful
feedback for Government. It also testifies to the potential and usefulness of further
structuring and engaging in public-private dialogue and consultations.

55. 
Algeria takes the lead in the dialogue with its cooperation partners. The Bank regularly consults and
coordinates with other active partners and seeks to cooperate and complement the activities financed by
them, in particular with the European Commission which has an active grant program in almost all economic
and social sectors. The African Development Bank recently opened a field office in Algiers and is preparing
a program of technical assistance using 
its Middle-Income Country Technical Assistance Fund.
Collaboration with these two institutions will be actively sought during the CPS period, and is encouraged by
the Algerian authorities.

C. 

The Country Partnership Strategy Program

56. 
The CPS aims to support the Government of Algeria design and implement policies that will help the
economy in its transition to a new, sustainable and balanced growth model, based on private-led economic
diversification. The main benefit of such a strategy would be to create more and better employment
opportunities. The Bank's interventions under the CPS focus around three areas that support the Government
objectives (see Appendix 5 for details):

I. 

II. 

III. 

Strengthening Growth through Diversification of the Economy, including support to the
implementation of the agricultural and rural development strategy, improving the investment
climate, in particular for SMEs, and modernizing the financial and banking sector.
Promoting Sustainable Development and Reducing Spatial Disparities, including
technical assistance to implement environment protection initiatives, as well as technical
support to Government programs aiming at reducing spatial disparities, such as the
development of competitiveness centers or ecotourism projects.
Strengthening the Institutions of Economic Planning, Monitoring, Evaluation and
Policy-Making, in particular by providing technical support to strengthen the planning,
monitoring and evaluation capacity of various sectors in the Government and their statistical
capacity, as well as the capacity to conduct impact evaluations of public interventions.

57. 
In each of these three areas, activities have been identified through the consultation process with the
authorities. In some areas, TAs/RTAs are already ongoing (e.g. environment and financial sector), others are
ready to be implemented (e.g. agriculture), and some are envisaged to be identified and prepared over the
course of the CPS. Technical assistance activities financed on the Bank budget are also ongoing or planned

19

for the coming years. Some of this work may eventually lead to the preparation of new RTAs. The details
provided below under each area of intervention reflect the current status of the dialogue with each ministry.
Table 2 below reflects the extent of engagement in each area.

58. 
Given the flexible nature of the CPS engagement, it is expected that new activities will develop over
the course of the program within these three broad areas of cooperation. For example, activities in support
of better planning, monitoring and evaluation may develop in the infrastructure or human development
sectors and they would belong to the third pillar, inherently cross-sectoral.

Area of intervention I: Strengthening Growth through Diversification of the Economy

59. 
Since 2000, Algeria has worked on the diversification of its economy with mixed success. While the
private sector has grown over the past decades, and now represents more than 75% of non-hydrocarbon
value-added, Algeria has yet to develop a private sector competitive in global markets and that creates
quality jobs. The 2009 Government program reiterates the commitment to diversification and emphasizes
increases in productivity through innovation. The CPS program seeks to help the Government consolidate
diversification efforts and support employment generation, by promoting pilot actions in agriculture, rural
development, and eco-tourism, supporting the modernization of the financial sector and improving the
business environment. The current Government program also includes selected strategies for industrial zone

20

development, SME support, banking sector reform and development of physical infrastructure. The
authorities propose to work with the Bank to develop a coherent economic diversification strategy within the
coming years. The Bank will center its diversification program around a high-level policy dialogue, in
coordination with the IMF, building on the experience of other countries who have successfully diversified
out of oil.

1.1 Developing a Sound and Stable Financial Sector

60. 
The Government strategy points to improvements in the financial sector as fundamental to the
transformation of the economy. The concerns of the Central Bank and the Ministry of Finance focus on the
stability of the sector, the need to modernize the public banks and increase access to finance by small and
medium enterprises. The strategy to improve the efficiency of the banking system includes strengthening
governance across the banking system to address risk management, internal audit, and accountability issues.
As the bulk of the banking sector remains public, improving governance and protecting against fiscal risks is
one of the priorities of the Government. The Ministry of Finance will strengthen its monitoring and
supervision tools for state owned banks and will put in place the measures necessary to improve SoBs
intermediation capacity. The Bank will continue to support the Bank of Algeria in its efforts to strengthen the
management tools of financial crises, improving banking supervision, establishing a modem and efficient
system of credit information and strengthening information security.

61. 
The Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank have requested the Bank to continue to assist in
financial sector reforms, within the platform provided by the recommendations of the 2003 FSAP, its 2007
update, two TA activities and one RTA (all three delivered). In addition, the Bank plans to assist the Ministry
of Finance assess the current structure of banking oversight of state-owned banks, share lessons learned in
other countries in the same reform agenda and support the implementation of the related action-plan. The
program should include the following four new RTAs:

(i) 

(ii) 

(iii) 

(iv) 

Following the RTA aimed at implementing a Central Credit Registry at the Central Bank
(completed), the Bank plans to assist the Central Bank with a modem credit registry that
fosters access to finance for firms (especially SMEs) and households, which should be fully
operational by the end of the CPS period.
Improvement of financial crisis preparedness. The testing of the preparedness framework in
May 2010 helped identify strengths and weaknesses of the financial crisis arrangements in a
period of simulated financial sector turbulence. Further improvements to the framework will
be required to minimize risks to financial stability and fiscal costs.
Strengthening of banking sector supervision. The Bank plans to identify areas where banking
supervision can be improved (both on on-site and off-site supervision) and assist the Central
Bank in implementing an action plan.
Formalizing the Information Security function of the Central Bank, to assist in establishing a
formal Information Security function and strengthen its business continuity program with a
focus on its Payment Systems, including with the establishment of an Information Security
Office, and the creation of a business-driven business continuity plan.

62. 
The IFC will continue to build on its existing financial sector program in the upcoming CPS period.
The IFC has helped develop Algeria's financial sector by taking equity investments in new private banks,
and was instrumental in establishing the first leasing company in the country. The IFC's investments in
private equity funds that target SMEs in the Maghreb have also facilitated increased access to finance for
SMEs in Algeria. The IFC investments have been complemented by a strong program of Advisory Services
in the areas of risk management, SME financing, corporate governance, among others. In the upcoming CPS
period, IFC is looking at investments in insurance and microfinance and will continue to explore the
possibility of establishing a microfinance institution. A market study, commissioned by the IFC and shared

21

with the Central Bank and Ministry of Finance, has helped shape a business plan for a commercial
microfinance institution. However, this process has been constrained due to the new regulations issued by
the Central Bank requiring an increase in the capital of banks and non-bank financial institutions.

1.2 Strengthening Agricultural Growth and Rural Development

63. 
The Algerian authorities assign a high priority to rural development and the modernization of
agriculture as part of a strategy to raise rural incomes and to diversify economic activity. Previous Bank
work on rural development in Algeria has been rated as successful, especially because of its contribution to
employment generation in rural areas. During this CPS, the Bank will work with the Ministry of Agriculture
(MADR) 
in implementing the Agriculture and Rural Development Strategy, which has two priority
programs: (i) the Rural Renewal Support Program (PSRR) and (ii) the Agricultural Economy Renewal
Program (PREA). The PSRR aims at a harmonized development of the Algerian rural regions, with a view to
enhance their complementarities and ensure social cohesion. The PREA aims at improving food security in
Algeria through: (i) the promotion of an enabling and stable environment (fiscal incentives, strengthening of
professional organizations); (ii) implementation of a regulatory system for mass consumption of food
products so as to better match supply and demand; and (iii) production intensification based on a supply
chain approach for strategic products.

The MADR has asked for Bank's support through three RTAs to be implemented in several phases

64. 
to:

(i) 

(ii) 

(iii) 

Support the Rural Renewal Support Program. Bank's assistance through this RTA will have
the objective of strengthening 
the capacity of all partners 
involved 
in the design,
implementation, supervision and monitoring and evaluation of the PSRR through an
integrated and participatory approach. This will include the development of a tailored
Monitoring and Evaluation system (M&E) for the PSRR, the assessment of current human
resource capacity, the definition of a comprehensive training program for staff, the design
and deployment of a communication plan to inform the Ministry's staff and targeted
beneficiaries of the Ministry's policies of the new programs; and to support the Department
of Forestry (Direction Gindrale des Forts, DGF) in executing and supervising the PSRR
nationwide;

Assist the MADR in selecting, and later creating, fully integrated agriculture development
zones (Integrated Agro-Food Centers (PMles Agro alimentaires Intigris) in selected strategic
sectors, bringing together all concerned stakeholders (farmers, agro-industries, markets,
financial institutions, Research and Development centers, and ITC agencies) in a pilot
activity to attain concrete results, that can be replicated in other sectors. The aim of the
authorities is to have 3 pilot poles over the next three years. This project will involve the
State Pilot Farms for which management will be delegated to public and private operators
based on relevant legislation. Private enterprises will also be called in to participate in the
creation of PAls; and

Support to the development of agricultural statistics, information systems and monitoring
and evaluation (SASISE). The technical assistance will include three components: (i) the
Bank will support the development of agricultural statistics with an RTA in conjunction with
a trust fund under the Trust Fund for Statistical Capacity Building (TFSCB). (ii) A second
component of the technical assistance aims at strengthening the information systems of the
Rural Renewal Support Program and to bridge the two main information systems with a
view to consolidating them into an Agricultural and Rural (SIAR). In addition, the technical
assistance will support the identification of information systems to be set up to integrate the

22

functions of design, management (including financial), of monitoring and evaluation of
projects and programs. (iii) In monitoring and evaluation, the technical assistance will
address the creation of systems similar to the monitoring and evaluation systems of the
PSRR and of the PAI to cover the entire program of renewal of the agricultural economy.

1.3 Improving the Business Environment and Strengthening Economic Diversification

65. 
The Algerian Government seeks to foster an investment climate that opens opportunities for new
business and contributes to competitive diversification. The action plan that develops this objective includes:

(i) an industrial strategy focusing on the development of specialized industrial zones; (ii) grant-based
technical assistance schemes to SMEs; (iii) public investment funds for SMEs completed by credit guarantee
schemes; (iv) export support programs that include promotion activities abroad and targeted direct support to
exporters; (v) an industrial land development strategy that would increase land market liquidity by placing
idle land previously owned by State-owned enterprises; and (vi) other programs to improve the business
environment such as customs and tax authority reforms, reduction in corporate taxes, and reform of the
investment promotion agency.

66. 
During this CPS the Bank support to the development and implementation of the business
environment and economic diversification would, in a first phase include:

(i) 

(ii) 

Diagnostic study of existing export-promotion mechanisms. The Bank has been engaged in
cooperation with the export promotion agency to assess the institutional efficiency of its
export promotion fund, Algex, in the context of the Government's intent to strengthen
import-substitution and foster exports.

Technical assistance on simplifying regulatory requirements in key areas of the business
environment. The CPS plans to support the Ministry of Finance and other ministries in the
simplification of regulations in areas such as tax collection or property transfer. Likewise,
monitoring and evaluation tools would be developed for the Government to monitor the
investment climate with accuracy and evaluate the effectiveness of the industrial strategy of
the SME programs. A short diagnostic study of the existing export-promotion programs and
the 
institutional 
framework 
in which 
they are 
implemented 
is currently under
implementation.

67. 
The IFC has a clear role in the development of the private sector in Algeria, especially in providing
comfort to international investors and helping to revitalize local private enterprises through investments,
sharing of global best practices, and capacity building. The IFC contribution to diversification includes

supporting private sector investments in manufacturing, chemicals, infrastructure, and financial markets.
IFC's strategy in Algeria focuses on (i) supporting improvements in the investment climate; (ii) assisting in
the liberalization and privatization process; (iii) helping develop the financial sector, including housing
finance and SMEs; (iv) helping strengthen the local private sector; and (v) encouraging private participation
in infrastructure and IT. IFC's program in Algeria has picked up over the recent years, 
and it is anticipated
that this trend will continue over the upcoming CPS cycle, if there are significant improvements in the
investment climate, regulatory framework, and liberalization of the economy. The IFC is well placed to share
its expertise in assisting Algeria to develop successful public-private partnerships in infrastructure.

1 With the opening of the IFC Algiers Office in 2005, the portfolio has increased from around US$74 million in FY04 to US$126
million in end-FY09. The committed portfolio declined to $82million at end FY10 due to the closing of two projects.

23

1.4 Supporting the Development of the Telecom Sector, ICT and E-Government

68. 

Algeria's reform of the telecom sector led to greater coverage and lower costs. The Bank supported
this process through several technical assistance operations and has continued to provide support and advice
through its own budget in recent years. The postal and telecom regulatory authority (ARPT) is working on
the modernization of its regulatory practices to allow Algerians access to the latest technologies and to
develop regulatory tools in line with good international practices. The regulator has requested support,
through an RTA, in three areas of its current work: (i) the development of a strategy and action plan to
establish a certification department within ARPT; (ii) a strategy and action plan to increase broadband access
in Algeria through a level playing field; and (iii) the development of postal regulatory tools. The
modernization of the telecom services supports the Government's ICT policy laid out in e-Algeria 2013,
which is expected to lead to a wave of reforms in the telecom sector and promote e-Government activities.

Area of intervention II: Promoting Sustainable Development and Reducing Spatial Disparities

69. 
Growth and economic transformation in Algeria is having an impact on environmental degradation
and the widening of spatial disparities. The Government has been addressing both issues for some time. In
the area of environment protection, the Bank will continue to support the Government in improving the
institutional capacity-building of waste management. To reduce spatial disparities, Algeria is investing major
resources to develop and intensify the highway network across the country, including in the highlands area
whose economic and social development lags behind the rest of the country. Sector-specific strategies,
targeting explicit geographical areas, complement such massive infrastructure undertakings. A Saharan eco-
tourism initiative is under design. The CPS program will provide institutional capacity building and technical
assistance in support of the implementation of some of these sector-specific and region-specific strategies.

11.1 Strengthening Sustainable Development through Environment Protection

70. 
Environmental protection is ranked as a high priority in Algeria. Since 2002, the Government began
putting in place a robust policy and legislative framework, including the 2002 National Environmental
Action Plan (NEAP), the 2003 Environmental Law for Sustainable Development and an Environmental
Impact Assessment compatible with the Environmental Law issued in 2008. The Bank has been an active
participant both in helping set the institutional framework through AAA and through successful investment
and technical assistance operations.

71. 

During the CPS, the Bank will continue assisting Algeria to build further its institutional capacity to
reduce environment risks and improve the quality of life of the populations located near high risk areas. In
addition, the Bank has been helping to build the capacity of the national agency for waste management
through two RTAs recently completed. The IFC has also been helping its clients in Algeria conform to
environmental best practice standards in some critical projects (cement and steel plants, fertilizers).

72. 

Given Algeria's vulnerability, particularly to earthquakes, and its preparedness in responding to
natural disasters, the active participation on regional economic and sector work would be very valuable. The
Bank could also support Algeria's efforts in updating disaster risk reduction and mitigation skills. A future
partnership could focus on perfecting risks using instruments including risk insurance and catastrophe bonds,
building on a 2003 Government's action on asset insurance and indemnification in case of natural disaster.
However, much remains to be done to ensure the development of an adequate compensation system and to
develop the pooling of risks from disasters.

73. 
Energy, low carbon strategy and climate change mitigation. The growth of Algeria's economy will
continue to be shaped by developments in the energy sector. Over the two to three coming decades, the

24

country must maximize hydrocarbon revenues, while reducing the country's vulnerability to oil price
volatility and preparing the economy for the post oil and gas era. The rapid growth in energy consumption
and the heavy reliance on subsidized hydrocarbons will, in the long term, lead to a difficult tradeoff between
domestic consumption and exports, and increase the burden on the budget. Making Algeria more energy
efficient is therefore essential to ensure sustained growth without disruption to the post oil and gas era.

74. 
As far as climate change mitigation is concerned, Algeria already made noticeable progress in
phasing out fuels with higher impacts on the environment, by promoting natural gas and liquefied petroleum
gases. Algeria intends to become a leading nation in the renewable sector, thanks to abundant endogenous
resources (like solar energy) and through targeted policies. However, today's energy production is a high
greenhouse gases (GHG) contributor and energy consumption is growing rapidly and there is a need to
further limit GHG emissions to contribute to climate change mitigation. To address these challenges, the
Government formulated a strategy based on several priority actions that included: (i) the development of the
hydrocarbon potential and related increase in production and export capacity; (ii) the enhancement of the
value of hydrocarbon exports, including through downstream integration, especially for natural gas; (iii)
international deployment to increase the reserve base of oil and gas, and improve access to existing or
emerging markets; (iv) the development of a performing energy infrastructure to meet the fast growing
national demand for electricity, natural gas and petroleum products; and (v) the development of alternative
energy resources, with special focus on solar.

75. 
The CPS will support the strategic planning unit ("Direction Prospective et Strategies") of the
Ministry of Energy of Mines in outlining a roadmap for future energy demand and the identification of
adequate modeling tools, as well as an analysis of demand scenarios (including low carbon energy use,
efficiency improvements, development of renewable energy, etc.). Further work could include a review of
the country energy efficiency strategy, identification of barriers to investments and proposals for adjustments
to the pricing/incentive framework to scale up energy efficiency and cogeneration investments, directly or
through eligible financial intermediaries. The Bank could positively contribute on energy efficiency,
development of renewable energy, reduction of carbon emissions, and private investment in the energy
sector. Moreover, Algeria has joined the Bank's regional CSP scale-up initiative and has proposed three
projects, for an amount of 220-230 MW, to the CTF Investment Plan.

11.2 Spatial Development and Ecotourism

76. 
Algeria's industrial strategy includes development of specialized industrial zones aiming at reducing
regional imbalances by putting in place a local enabling environment to attract investors in certain sectors in
the less privileged parts of the country. Similarly, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development plans
to develop Agribusiness Integrated Industrial Centers, and the Ministry of Tourism and Handicrafts has
developed a master plan of Tourism Development Zones in all regions of Algeria. The proposed Bank
support will consist of providing technical assistance (through RTA) to the Ministry of Territorial
Administration and Environment (MATE) in assessing the viability of developing specific sectors and zones
through the creation of adequate regulatory frameworks. The majority of the new activities in the
environment sector are part of Tier 2.

77. 
Support to the establishment of competitiveness and excellence poles in the wilayas of Bjaia, Setif
Borj-Bou-Arreridj and M'sila. The Bank's assistance would focus on: (i) the feasibility of poles of excellence
in the wilayas of S6tif, Bejaia, Bourdj-Bor-Arreridj and M'sila, and (ii) the assessment of the potential of
pre-identified industrial options; manufacturing of plastic products in Setif, biotechnology for the food
industry in Bejaia as well as Setif, electronics in Borj Bor-Arreridj and the development of new construction
material in M'sila. The analysis would consist in an estimation of growth potential and impact on
employment, and identification of complementary industrial and services activities. In addition, the RTA

25

would include (iii) consultation with all stakeholders (local, national and international firms, local governing
bodies, universities, research and training institutions, chambers of industry and professional/business); and
(iv) assessing 
the institutional requirements for project 
implementation, including 
the mapping and
identification of the Poles.

78. 

The CPS will support MATE through operationalizing their strategy for improving tourism in the

South. This will be implemented through piloting desert ecotourism actions in four tourism centers in the
South (P6les Touristiques d'Excellence du Sud- Saharien, including Tassili N'Ajjer (Djanet), Ahaggar -
Assekrem (Tamanrasset), Oasien (Gharda*fa) and Touat - Gourara (Timimoun - Tinerkouk, Taghit). The
work will be supported though RTA and include: (i) identification of the potential touristic demand; (ii)
identification of the menu of products to offer; (iii) assessment of infrastructure needs; and (iv) assessment of
environmental impact. It is expected that by the end of the CPS at least one of the poles will be operational.
IFC is also exploring possibilities of investing in few hotels and mixed real estate development.

Area of intervention III: Strengthening the Institutions of Economic Planning, Monitoring, Evaluation
and Policy-Making

79. 

Assistance in economic and social sectors monitoring. Keenly aware of the need to enhance its

planning capacity, in 2008 the Government created the General Commission for Planning and Forecast
(CGPP), which was recently transformed into the Ministry of Forecast and Statistics (MPS). The new
ministry still lacks an organizational structure, staff and technical capacity commensurate with its mandate.
The CPS will support the new ministry in its endeavor, by providing technical assistance in the areas of: (i)
macroeconomic forecasting; (ii) monitoring and evaluation of social and economic policies; and (iii) long-
term strategy preparation. The aim is to strengthen the Ministry' capacity to enable it to lead the preparation
of the country's long term social and economic strategy and to improve the Government's planning and
evaluation functions. This support will initially consist of training and technical assistance in the areas of
economic and social monitoring and impact evaluation. Follow-on work through RTAs is planned to support
selected items of the preparation and implementation of a long-term social and economic strategy for
Algeria. As part of its regular economic monitoring, the Bank will also help the MPS upgrade its capacity to
carry out economic monitoring of macroeconomic developments, with emphasis on fiscal performance.

80. 
Evaluation. The Government assigns a high priority to the evaluation of public expenditure
programs. The expectation is that the results of the evaluations and the upgraded capacity of Government
agencies will provide valuable feedback to decide on the course of the Government programs. The CPS
supports efforts at developing stronger capacities in the evaluation at the MPS. This will include capacity
building activities to the Ministry teams in charge of the policy evaluation, including training seminar on
monitoring and impact evaluation tools, and technical assistance in setting up the evaluation function. Initial
work is on-going and may be followed by a RTA to conduct joint impact evaluation of selected policies.

Support to improve the efficiency and the targeting in the delivery of social development programs.

81. 
The Ministry of National Solidarity and Family (MNSF), the Social Development Agency (ADS) as well as
the National Agency for Microcredit Management (ANGEM), are evaluating their core social programs and
have requested Bank support in strengthening their in-house capacity in monitoring and evaluation. These
three institutions together are in charge of implementing social programs that amount to yearly outlays of
more than US$1.5 billion. Bank's support started in early 2010 with a technical workshop that helped assess
the current monitoring and evaluation practices and discusses the most appropriate strategy going forward.
Based on the results of this assessment, the Bank team and the Government have identified the main areas of
a multi-year RTA program to strengthen evaluation practices and assist in the redesign of the current social
assistance system under the responsibility of these three institutions.

26

82. 
Assistance in the evaluation of the targeting efficiency of subsidies. The Ministry of Finance also
seeks to evaluate the efficiency of targeting its program of subsidies for basic commodities. This system is in
place to protect consumers from price increases on certain products with a wide variety of use (milk and two
types of wheat). The Ministry is concerned about the ability of the current system to properly target the
intended population and its sustainability in view of the high fiscal burden such subsidies entail. The CPS
will provide assistance to take stock on the present system and analyze alternative options for improvement,
based on regional and worldwide experiences.

83. 
Statistical Capacity Building TA and RTA to the National Statistical office. The CPS includes
technical support to the National Statistic Office (ONS) in the preparation of the (2010) household survey
and its analysis, including by using LSMS (Living Standards Measurement Study) methodologies. The Bank
will share best practices to design questionnaires that integrate household survey with living standards
measurements, help with sampling design, support to data cleaning and quality control, and train ONS staff
in data analysis and standardization of statistical presentations. Such support will be provided through a
combination of Bank budget, for the immediate help with questionnaire preparation and sampling, and RTA
for the evaluation and analysis of the results.

84. 
Under the CPS the Bank will continue working with the National Economic and Social Council
(CNES), a government think-tank on economic and social issues which conducts regular evaluations of
Government policies. The agenda for the CNES includes areas such as poverty, governance, small and
medium enterprises, competition, knowledge economy and sustainable development. The scope for RTAs
will be developed based on punctual demands to be received from the CNES.

85. 
Macro-economic and Fiscal Policy. To ensure successful macroeconomic management of the
economy, the Bank will continue to support the strengthening of management of foreign reserves through
two RTAs to the Bank of Algeria. The Government is actively engaged in the reform of its public
administration system and the development of a modem public expenditure system is critical in this context.
The authorities have confirmed that they are interested in the Bank to support in this area. The scope and
modalities for such assistance will be explored during the CPS implementation.

D. 

Results

86. 
Knowledge programs to strengthen institutional capacity. The CPS presents a Results Matrix
designed to deliver a demand-driven and knowledge-based program geared to strengthening the institutional
capacity of the Government. In line with recommendations for MIC knowledge-based programs, the Results
Matrix includes both the contribution of the RTA activities and the broader goals of Government programs
they support. Given the small size of RTA financing in comparison to the Government's program, the
development impact of the Bank interventions will depend heavily on the commitment, financing, and
capacity of the Government initiatives. The CPS is aware of the challenge of measuring impact within the
limited time-frame of each individual RTA and therefore includes several activities aiming to strengthen the
Government's own methodologies and evaluating capacity of its programs. The Results Matrix has
monitoring and evaluation capacity as one key outcome of the program, rather than the starting point to
measure impact of Bank's activities.

87. 
The Results Matrix is a living document. The Results Matrix begins by detailing the results from
activities the Government has invited the Bank to contribute to its strategic objectives and programs, but the
partners expect to revise the document regularly as some activities are completed and new ones agreed upon.
The CPS provides the overall framework that responds to the Government's demand for a long-term and
flexible partnership developed around coherent strategic priorities and vetted by the Government upfront to
avoid the emergence of ad-hoc and uncoordinated technical assistance activities. The results chain has been

27

identified only for the ongoing and first phase of activities (Tier 1), for which RTA tasks have already been
fully agreed upon and scoping is completed or ongoing. For the second phase of the engagement, starting
during the second year of CPS implementation (Tier 2 program), Milestones and Outputs will be defined
based on the activities design, and the results chain will be formulated in line with the Government's
Institutional Outcomes.

88. Measuring performance. The Government and Bank will undertake periodic (annual) updating of the
Results Matrix as the programs evolve and the partners agree on new RTA operations. Specific
implementation monitoring tools for each activity will be used for quality review and as an instrument to
track progress in implementing milestones and outputs, jointly with the counterparts. In addition, the Bank
will maintain records of deliverables and, to the extent feasible, of Government outcomes. In addition to the
annual reviews of the program, the CPS Progress report will take stock of progress in two years and the
partners will jointly decide on revisions to the framework presented in the CPS.

VI. 

RISKS AND CHALLENGES IN IMPLEMENTATION

89. 

The collaboration between the Bank and Algeria will be one of the first based on a CPS resting
solely on knowledge services. It thus carries significant learning opportunities in its implementation and
offers potential to be replicated in other countries. The main challenge of this approach is to effectively
deliver development impact. Being strongly demand-driven and primarily client-financed, the impact of the
program will depend on the pace at which government action supported by the CPS are actually
implemented. To ensure that priority activities are targeted and that they have a development impact for the
country, the Bank and the Government will put in place a process of systematic filtering RTA requests to
ensure that they fit in the Government's strategic priorities, are sufficiently implementation-oriented, and
carry significant developmental impact potential. This process of filtering has already been put in place
during the selection of activities included in the Tier 1 of the CPS matrix and budget for these activities has
already been allocated. It will continue to be implemented to ensure that the same selection process is used
for activities selected in the course of CPS implementation. Additional assurances of the relevance of the
program proposed also come from the fact that all RTAs proposed are linked to the Government's action
plan and are itemized in the annual Budget Law. The flexibility offered by Bank-funded activities will allow
the Government and the Bank to identify new areas of cooperation of strategic importance or to initiate
analytical work that could lead to RTAs with high developmental impact. The annual review of the program
will be a useful regular milestone to assess the overall content of the CPS being implemented, the relevance
of its activities and their likely impact.

90. 

This innovative CPS could also potentially face implementation challenges that both the Government
and the Bank need to be prepared for. There is growing, but still limited experience in the Bank to support
the implementation of a country program exclusively grounded on RTA and AAAs. This CPS provides an
opportunity for the Bank to develop a working model to operate in non-borrowing middle income countries.
The CPS Progress Report will provide the first formal opportunity to take stock of the CPS implementation
effectiveness. Progress under the CPS will be regularly monitored and discussed annually with the
Government so as to take early remedial actions, if necessary. Annual progress reports will also be reviewed
by the Bank's Regional Management Team.

91. 

The implementation of the CPS program delivered through the RTA instrument may run into
operational problems which could impair the success of the program. Experience from some of the
previously implemented RTAs has shown that in cases where there were disagreements between the parties,
especially of an administrative and contractual nature, the Bank and the Government had to invest substantial
time and effort to come to an agreement. The Bank had also encountered several delays in payment of

28

services under some RTAs. To reduce this risk, the Government has requested to prepare a standard RTA
model agreement in line with Algerian law and Bank policies and guidelines. This framework is intended to
facilitate both designing the RTAs and implementing them. The model agreement has been prepared and it
was still under review by the Government at the time the CPS was finalized. Additional assurances of the
relevance of the program proposed also come from the fact that all RTA proposed are linked to the
Government strategies and investment plan and are financed through the budget. Moreover, the close
involvement in the RTA identification and screening from the Ministry of Finance and its leadership in
ensuring coordination and commitment among sectors should help ensure the coherence and facilitate the
implementation of the program.

92. 

Finally, advisory services make it more difficult to monitor outcomes and results. Anticipating this
difficulty, the CPS provides a tailored implementation Quality Monitoring Tool to carefully track progress in
results and outcomes. Also, to cope with the implementation challenges of a program based mostly on RTA,
the Bank's MENA region is putting in place standard procedures and quality assurance measures to
guarantee the high quality of RTA products and to ensure uniformity in this instrument across the region.
Only RTAs for which the Government has allocated budgetary resources will be confirmed, which should
facilitate their effective implementation. Selectivity in identifying the RTA activities should ensure that
adequate capacity, ownership and human resources are dedicated to their implementation, both on the
Government and the Bank side. Finally, the Bank's presence in Algeria will be strengthened to increase the
local oversight of the program implementation and continuous dialogue with the authorities.

COMPLETION REPORT

COVERING THE COUNTRY ASSISTANCE STRATEGY 2004-2006

AND THE INTERIM PERIOD 2006-2010

PEOPLE'S DEMOCTRATIC REPUBLIC OF ALGERIA

I. 

Introduction

1. 
This Country Assistance Strategy Completion Report (CAS-CR) reviews the World Bank
Group's program in Algeria over the last six years. It assesses the implementation of the program that was
set out in the original CAS document (for the period FY04-06) as well as the years since the conclusion of
the CAS period to today. In accordance with Bank's internal guidelines on CAS CRs, the analysis
addresses Bank's performance during the complete period including implementation of the CAS and the
following interim period. It also reviews the projects and AAA under implementation and other activities
launched during the same period. Table 1 below lists the activities under consideration, in addition to IFC
activities.

2. 
The CAS-CR is based on the reviews of: (i) portfolio implementation performance reports; (ii)
the last two implementation status and results reports (ISRs) and Aide-Memoires of the projects active
during period under review; (iii) implementation completion reports (ICRs) of projects completed during
the CAS period; (iv) the Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) reviews of ICRs; available Quality
Assurance Group (QAG) Reviews; and (v) the 2005 CAS Progress Report. This CAS-CR has been
developed based on consultation with Government's counterparts; and the self-assessments by the Algeria
Country Team. The lessons learned, including those outlined in the July 2005 CAS Progress Report,
inform the new Country Partnership Strategy for FY10- 13.

II. 

Political and Economic Context

A. 

Context at Design

3. 
The CAS was prepared over a period of 18 months between January 2002 and June 2003, at
a time when Algeria had regained stability and its economy was recovering after a decade of the
1990s made of political unrest and economic stagnation. The reform momentum was strong in all areas
of economic policy, and four consecutive years of rising oil prices offered increased fiscal space to
implement public investment programs to catch-up with lagging infrastructure and social development
investments that had declined drastically since the mid-eighties and throughout the 'lost decade' of the
1990s. GDP growth increased from 2.1 percent in 2001 to 4.1 percent in 2002, and foreign exchange
reserves reached their highest level since independence, growing 27 percent between 2001 and 2002 to
US$23 billion. Still, the reform backlog was significant, in particular in the financial sector area where the
State-owned banks needed yet another recapitalization to reduce their vulnerability to non-performing
loans.

4. 
The Government strategy at the time of CAS preparation aimed at (i) strengthening the basis
for sustainable and rapid growth; (ii) improving the effectiveness of public service delivery; and (iii)
improving living standards and strengthening social protection. The Government reform agenda was
ambitious and included (i) reform of the judiciary; (ii) reform of the education and health systems; (iii)
redefining the role of the State and modernizing 
its administration; (iv) reforming the business
environment, the financial sector and State-owned enterprises; and (v) sectoral reforms in telecoms,
energy, transport, and other infrastructure sectors in parallel to increased public investments.

5. 
The World Bank Group CAS aimed at supporting specific areas of reforms. It was organized
around broad areas which the CAS Progress Report renamed Pillars of intervention. These were:

* Pillar 1: Strengthening the basis for fiscal sustainability and Government effectiveness, aimed
at achieving several goals, such as creating an asset liability management framework, including
management of oil price volatility, and improving Government effectiveness through better
public expenditure management and procurement reforms.

* Pillar 2: Improving the business environment and encouraging private sector participation.
The areas identified for action were: opening-up infrastructure sectors to private participation to
increase competition and improve the delivery of basic services; furthering financial sector
reform to modernize its infrastructure and increase access to investment and working capital for
SMEs; and improving the business environment.

* Pillar 3: Improving public service delivery, including in human development, housing and water,
social protection, education, rural development; and natural resource management.

6. 
To deliver in these areas, the CAS envisaged an ambitious program. It constituted the first full
strategy prepared for Algeria after 10 years (the previous CAS of 1996 had been designed as a transitional
assistance strategy to support the stabilization program of the then newly elected Government). The
Bank's presence in the 1990s had been limited due to the instability and its knowledge of the Algerian
economy and the country's development challenges eroded as a consequence. The CAS program was
designed in a flexible way whereby the main areas of interventions were defined but the program of
activities was left relatively open beyond the first year. The CAS included a substantive AAA program
and a very limited new lending program. However a large portfolio was already active at the time of its
preparation (see Annex 1 for a comparison of planned vs. actual program).

7. 
The CAS design appears to have been too ambitious. It was not revised to adapt to the rapid
changes ongoing in the country, in particular the increase in oil revenues and the policy changes that it
induced. Also, several reforms expected by the Bank appeared to have been too ambitious and not taking
enough into account the actual pace of reforms and the implementation capacity in different sectoral
ministries.

B. 

Context during Implementation

8. 
The CAS was implemented as hydrocarbon prices and production increases eased the
financing constrains of the Government. By the end of 2005, oil prices reached US$55/barrel, against
CAS assumptions of US$23/barrel. Oil revenues totaling $150 billion were invested in a series of public
investment programs aiming at fueling growth, upgrading infrastructure, and generating employment.

40

Higher oil prices and the impact of market reforms and increased public investment led to a double than
expected 6 percent growth between 2003 and 2005, and a drastic decline in unemployment from 25
percent to 15 percent between 2002 and 2005. With the major oil windfall -
reaching amounts not
anticipated at the time the CAS was prepared, the country external financial situation improved
significantly and the need for external financing quickly vanished. Yet, the commitment to opening-up the
economy remained strong, as signaled by the ratification of the Association Agreement with the European
Union in 2005.

9. 
With increased fiscal resources, the Government shifted it economic strategy towards
stronger emphasis on public investments, while drastically reducing its external debt. In 2004, while
the CAS was being implemented, the Government started to increasingly focus on achieving growth and
employment through public investment projects, infrastructure in particular, financed with revenues from
hydrocarbon resources. In 2005, it decided to repay its outstanding public external debt, including with
multilateral financial institutions like the World Bank, and adopt a strict non-foreign-borrowing policy.
Such decision led to a major restructuring of the Bank's ongoing projects, including on projects that had
been planned at the time of CAS design. The impact of rising oil prices-which continued between 2006
and mid-2009-also affected the drive for reforms. While the necessary institutional and business-
enabling reforms were high on the Government's agenda during the first part of the decade, and progress
was made in some areas, the reform momentum weakened with the rise of fiscal resources as priority was
given to delivering on the public investment programs (especially in infrastructure like transport, energy
and water) and the improvement of services to citizens (social housing, education, access to water and
energy, and health).

10. 
The July 2005 CAS Progress Report (CAS PR) was prepared after the decision of the
Government to stop borrowing. While a large portfolio was being implemented, the program was not
revised at the time the CAS PR was prepared. Soon after the Government decided to repay its external
public debt, fourteen Bank loans were cancelled partially or entirely, for a total of US$326 million (Table
2), and only one new project (the Second Rural Employment Project, not included in the CAS) was
approved, before being cancelled soon after its approval. Nevertheless, the Bank did not sufficiently
recognize the new Government policy orientation and the program was not sufficiently adapted to the
evolving policy environment. Nevertheless, the Government proceeded to implement several Bank
projects with its own financing. The AAA program was also affected and the pace of implementation
slowed even if the program grew in scope. At CAS PR stage, the Bank still did not adequately integrate
the major shift occurred in the Government's debt policy by changing its cooperation approach, and only
recognized that "the development of the RTA will be essential to provide in specific areas Bank expertise
of a certain scale". As a result, lending remained a possible scenario in the CAS PR analysis.

11. 
The interim period that followed the CAS PR lasted well over the one year envisaged in the
document. The initial relevance of the CAS ended-up being misaligned with the new focus of public
policy in the country. Cooperation between Algeria and the Bank adjusted to the emerging circumstances
and the Bank's contribution evolved from that of financing partner to being a technical advisor. The Bank
program was reduced in scope and shifted to supporting the modernization of selected areas of public
policy. The analytical program focused on accompanying the Government's massive investment program

42

and the modernization of budget procedures. The role of Algeria's other international partners also
declined, with the exception of the European Commission that maintained a large grant program.
Nevertheless, while the pace of reforms expected in the CAS slowed down after 2005, Algeria still made
progress in areas that were not originally included at the time of its preparation, but where Bank support
was nevertheless provided, as in the area of service delivery to citizens.

12. 
Cooperation with the World Bank shifted to Reimbursable Technical Assistance (RTA) but
was characterized by insufficient structure in the engagement. The Bank continued to maintain a
close dialogue in specific sectors funded either by the Bank or by the Government, based on an
opportunistic approach which built on programs completed and ongoing. This was the case particularly in
agriculture and rural development, health, education and budget modernization. In the absence of a
structured dialogue around a cooperation framework, providing TA and RTAs based on ad-hoc
interventions limited the scope of intervention of the Bank and its potential developmental impact. With
regards to the implementation of RTA activities, the limited knowledge of the instrument which was
being used for the first time in Algeria, led to several challenges: delays in agreeing on the scope of
activities and procurement procedures, difficulties in identifying pilot projects due to limited clarity of
sector priorities, lack of feedback on assessing progress and agreeing on next steps in the course of
implementation, and some considerable delays in processing payments. The impact of the Bank's action
was relatively modest as a result.

13. 
The approach advocated in the CAS, based on the principles of flexibility and selectivity
proved appropriate, especially after the suspension of borrowing. However, the lack of a strategic
framework around the program limited its coherence and impact. The Bank could respond to the
demands for advice by providing TA financed on its own budget or through RTA, which allowed to
maintain continuity in the dialogue in selected critical areas. Such approach, however, took time to
develop, for the reasons explained above. Interactions and feedback on reports and on preliminary Bank's
recommendations remained an issue as such feedback was not perceived as an integral element in the
partnership. Despite such challenges, the program implemented, while modest, was relevant to the needs
expressed by the Algerian counterparts. Also, the Bank was able to react to the changed circumstances,
and the Government carried out much of the program agreed through its own budget. It should also be
noted that, despite the decision to stop borrowing, the Authorities, and the sector ministries in particular,
valued the contribution that the Bank could provide in implementing their program, and attempted to find
new ways of accessing the Bank's knowledge.

14. 
The 2007 QAG review of AAA program in Algeria, which covered RTAs, noted that the
impact of Bank's actions was most notable in areas where the Bank had previously implemented lending
operations. As regards AAA and RTA in particular, the Review recognized the value of this instrument in
the context of Algeria. The Bank's interim engagement (FY07-FY10) led to a strengthened and more
cohesive dialogue, and to the demand for a strategic approach to the partnership.

15. 
The dialogue between the Government and the Bank between 2007 and the end of 2008
lacked structure and was weakened by the departure of the last Country Manager from the Algiers
office at the end of 2007, and senior presence at the end of 2007. For the following year, implementation
of RTAs continued and new requests were presented, although the approach remained ad-hoc and did not
lead to substantive engagement by the Bank.

16. 
The Government and the Bank actively sought opportunities to resume the partnership and
engage in a more structured dialogue, which led to the decision to prepare a CPS. In December
2008, the Minister of Finance officially expressed interest in engaging in a more substantive program,
supported by a full Country Partnership Strategy. For the subsequent year, a comprehensive program
articulated around the Government priorities was discussed, agreed and confirmed through financial

43

commitments in the 2009 budget law. At the same time, RTA contracts continued to be implemented and
new ones prepared, in particular in the agriculture and environment sectors. Advice by Bank staff also
continued to be provided through TA in several areas, such as telecom, finance, and private sector
development.

III. 

Bank Group Contribution to Results

17. 
In the absence of a CAS Results Framework (the CAS was designed before the results approach
was introduced), the CAS CR assesses the Bank's performance based on the contribution made to the
delivery of the Government's outcomes. Such outcomes have been selected among the key areas that the
Bank intended to support through the CAS.

Pillar I: Strengthening the basis for fiscal sustainability and Government effectiveness

18. 
Program summary. The program under the First Pillar was implemented for the most part
during the interim period 2006-2010. Activities under the first pillar aimed at supporting fiscal
sustainability, 
including assistance for public asset and liability management and for improving
Government effectiveness in the use of public funds. Oil revenues totaling $150 billion were invested,
between 2001 and 2005, in a series of public investment programs aiming at fueling growth, upgrading
infrastructure, and generating employment. A first growth stimulus package, the US$7 billion Programme
de Soutien a la Relance Economique (PSRE) was approved for 2001-2004, followed by a larger
Programme Complementaire de Soutien a la Croissance Economique (PCSCE) for 2005-09, initially with
a US$55 billion budget. Algeria improved its management of oil revenues and the Bank provided relevant
assistance in the context of rapidly growing oil prices. The objectives of Bank's advice aiming to
modernize budgetary practices were relevant given the rapid increase in public expenditures.

19. 
Rating Summary. The Bank's contribution to the Government's outcomes as formulated in the
CAS can be rated as Moderately Satisfactory (see Table 3 for the summary of outcomes). A focused
program contributed in particular to create an asset liability management framework, through improved
oil revenue and reserves management. On the other hand, Bank's support for the modernization of public
expenditure management came short of expected goals as only few of the initiatives have been
implemented. The country remains committed to implementing the broad range of initiatives that have
already been prepared and piloted and substantive progress is expected over the next two years. The
impact of the technical assistance in the area of public procurement has been limited so far. Yet, two
Reimbursable Technical Assistance operations helped improve procurement practices at Sonatrach, the oil
and gas State company.

I. Creating an asset liability management framework including management of oil price volatility

20. 
The Bank provided assistance to improve the management of oil resources. The Bank
focused on strengthening fiscal sustainability, hydrocarbon revenue management and Government
effectiveness, with three successive pieces of ESW, 
in coordination with assistance from the
International Monetary Fund. The Macroeconomic Strategy for the Medium Term, the Assessment of the
Programme de Soutien a la Relance Economique (PSRE) and the Public Expenditure Review (PER) all
addressed hydrocarbons management and debt sustainability. They estimated the impact of the oil
windfall revenues on the first phase of the massive public investment program. In addition, a Technical
Assistance mission on oil fiscal revenues was completed. The Central Bank has received assistance from

45

the Bank's Treasury Department since 2007 through the Reserves Advisory and Management Program
(RAMP) in support of capacity management of official reserves.

II. 
Improving Government effectiveness through better public expenditure management and
procurement reform.

21. 
Public Expenditure Management. The Budget System Modernization Project (BSMP)
supported an ambitious initiative to overhaul the public expenditure system. Progress has been slower
than expected, but a stock of reform initiatives have been designed, are ready for implementation and
are expected to be completed by 2012. Algeria has a clear legal and administrative framework for PFM
and a reasonably functioning PFM system which provides for a satisfactory degree of financial controls
and external audit. In addition, Algeria has reasonable PFM staff capacity. However, the PFM system is
based on a legislative framework which required updating to modem standards which the BSMP sought
to address by focusing on (i) budget reform, including budget preparation (Medium Term Expenditure
Framework, performance budgeting, improved resource allocation), budget presentation (program
budgeting, GFS nomenclatures) and a revision of the budget execution cycle, including the expenditure
circuit, the control and auditing functions, as well as Government accounting; (ii) computerization of the
budget activities; and (iii) support to the computerization of the General Tax Directorate. The startup of
this project was delayed by about two years and the 2006 Mid-Term Review sharpened its objectives
and dropped some components (the implementation phase of the IT component) that the Government
undertook and completed with its own resources.

22. Contrary to most other Bank projects which were cancelled at that time, at the suggestion of the
Bank, the BSMP was restructured in 2006 and remained active until its closure in 2009. However, most
of the milestones set under the Mid-Term Review had not been met. Yet, significant achievements, such
as the unification of the capital and recurrent budget, were realized. The bulk of the final outcome of the
project has been a stock of initiatives that the project contributed to design and that will transform the
current expenditure system when implemented. This stock of initiatives include a new budget
classification; a Comprehensive Finance Law (Loi Organique des Finances); strategic planning now in
place in 15 ministries that will support the introduction of programmatic approach to budgeting; an
expenditure management handbook that simplifies the expenditure circuit and an MTEF adopted for the
2010-2014 period. The team has rated achievement of the project development outcomes as Moderately
Unsatisfactory as by the end of the project the expected results set during its restructuration had not
been achieved.

23. 
An RTA supported the newly created Caisse Nationale d'Equipement et de Dveloppement
(CNED) to support its mandate to evaluate large projects in the public expenditure program. Moreover
the Public Expenditure Review (FY08) provided a broad overview and analysis of public expenditure
with emphasis on the Public Investment Program. The PER studied in detail the transport, education,
health and water sectors, and provided numerous recommendations to improve the quality of public
investment spending.

24. 
Improved Monitoring and Evaluation capacity. Additional support for improved effectiveness
of the budgetary procedures and procurement came through an Institutional Development Fund grant
(IDF) on Project Monitoring and Evaluation Capacity Building of the DGREFE (Direction Gindrale des
Relations Economiques et Financieres Extirieures), the Bank's main counterpart in the Ministry of
Finance, aiming at strengthening the DGREFE to coordinate, assess, monitor and evaluate projects funded
by bilateral and multilateral donors. This activity, which was completed within 
its planned
implementation period, was not only instrumental to strengthening the implementation capacity of
DGREFE, but it also allowed the Directorate to acquire an IT platform accessible by intemet allowing to
generate reliable and accurate accounting and financial information, allowing the team to analyze the

46

financing offers received and to base its portfolio management to a results-based approach. It also allowed
the training of a network of trainers to ensure sustainability of the results-based management approach.
Two other activities also focused on improving budgetary practices, in particular the Economic Recovery
Program Evaluation ESW.

25. 

Improved Public Procurement. The IDF on Modernization of Public Procurement System for
the Directorate of Public Procurement in Ministry of Finance was completed but the recommendations
remain to be fully implemented to generate impact on the effectiveness of public procurement in the
country. Two RTAs responded to the demand from the State-owned oil and gas company Sonatrach for
support in improving parts of its procurement system. The first of these initiated in 2005 aimed at
improving the quality of twenty standard technical documents; a second RTA was carried out between
December 2006 and August 2008, to help the preparation of standard bidding documents. Sonatrach
followed most, although not all, the recommendations provided by the Bank.

Pillar II - Improving the business environment and encouraging private sector participation

26. 
Program summary. This pillar focused on: (i) privatization and improving the business
environment; (ii) banking reform; (iii) encouraging private sector participation in infrastructure services.
Removing the barriers to private-sector led growth was highly relevant in Algeria where the private non-
oil economy accounts for 45 percent of the GDP given the weight of the oil economy and the public
sector. The initial program was affected by the cancellation of several loans (Financial System
Infrastructure Modernization, the Privatization Assistance and the Telecommunication and Postal Sector
Modernization, see Annex) and the shift of emphasis of the Government towards State-led development.
Therefore, CAS implementation focused on a narrower set of objectives, which the program helped
deliver with success (see Table 4 below).

27. 
Rating Summary. The Bank's contribution to the Government's outcomes as formulated in the
CAS can be rated as Moderately Unsatisfactory. The CAS helped the country advance the deregulation
of the telecommunications sector, with significant impact on service delivery. In addition, the Bank
helped with the modernization of payment system of the banking sector and putting in place a modem
institutional framework for mortgage financing. Yet, progress in other areas of this pillar were more
modest.

A dynamic private sector contributed significantly to non-oil economic growth since the
early 2000s. The Government made progress toward reforming the governance of public enterprises
during the CAS period, in particular by itemizing subsidies to loss-making public enterprises into the

48

annual budget, strengthening performance contracts for public banks, increasing systematic control, and
increasing the central bank's supervisory capacity. More rigorous requirements for private banks were
also introduced, including higher minimum capital requirements and constraints on lending firms owned
by its shareholders. The Bank provided technical assistance to simplify the regulation of businesses;
however, the assistance had limited impact and Algeria's international rankings of the quality of its
business environment remains low (see, for example, the Doing Business Report or the World Economic
Forum country rankings). Implementation of ambitious programs to reform the regulatory environment to
encourage stronger private sector growth fell short of original expectations. The Bank nevertheless
remained engaged in this area.

29. 
In the business environment and diversification area, a series of studies were prepared and
delivered to the Government with mixed results. Bank's support consisted mainly of analytical studies
and technical assistance to inform the design of regulatory reform. An Investment Climate Assessment
delivered in 2004 helped to shed new light on constraints to private sector development, in particular in
areas of access to industrial land and business entry regulation. This work, together with follow-up TA
activities and policy notes provided a basis from which to initiate reforms in both areas. A Legal and
Business Environment AAA (2004) was used by the Ministry of Justice to inform the work of the National
Commission on Commercial Code reform. Technical assistance started in 2006 to support a Doing
Business reform inter-ministerial committee. It included recommendations to improve Algeria's ranking
in many areas measured by the Doing Business Report, in particular regarding business entry, credit
information, labor regulations and property registration. It also led to a TA led by the IFC to improve the
efficacy of the National Agency for Investment Development (ANDI) one-stop-shop, and to a 2008
Policy Note on the Algerian Labor Market which identified constraints to a more effective functioning of
the formal labor market in Algeria. As a follow-up to the 2004 ICA, the Bank undertook in 2008 a follow-
up enterprise ICA survey which identified the main challenges to stronger private sector development and
competitiveness in the country. Even if its dissemination was limited to the Government, its analysis
remains a strong analytical basis for a future dialogue between the Government and the Bank on
economic diversification. In fact, in late 2007, upon the request of the Government, the Bank developed
detailed terms of reference for the preparation of a long-term diversification strategy. These terms of
reference have later been used as key input to the Planning and Prospective Commission work on
preparing such a long-term strategy. Finally, in April 2009 the Bank delivered to the Government a
complementary Policy Note on "Export Diversification in Algeria."

30. 
A cooperation with the Conseil National Economique et Social (CNES), while not initially
planned in the CAS, was launched and detailed in a Memorandum of Understanding. It encompassed
knowledge transfer and capacity building on governance, business environment, poverty evaluation and
the knowledge economy. Activities also included at training to high-level officials from different
ministries in the impact evaluation of public policies.

31. 
The activities under this pillar did not lead to any significant reform and had limited
impact, even if they informed the ongoing legal reforms (e.g. commercial code). While the program
responded to an initial explicit request to support an ambitious privatization and business environment
reform agenda, the Bank did not sufficiently changed the focus of its work in this area as the drive for the
expected reforms weakened starting in 2005.

II. Banking reform, including privatization of banks, and financial market development

32. 
Algeria has made progress 
in the liberalization of its banking sector, even 
if the
privatization process has been put on hold at the start of the global financial crisis. Algeria's reforms
in the banking sector opened space for private foreign banks that now hold around 10 percent of the assets

49

of the sector. Their networks and operations are steadily growing in size. At the same time, tightening of
regulatory requirements and higher minimum capital requirements led to the closing of most private
locally-owned banks. The implementation of performance contracts with public banks' CEOs and the
introduction of an independent board member chairing the audit committee are steps that are likely to
strengthen State owned banks corporate governance. However, the first privatization ever initiated (Credit
Populaire d'Algerie-CPA) did not take off and no further timetable has been released in light of the
impact of the financial crisis. The expectation is that the public banks will continue to dominate the
banking sector and, as a consequence, a priority should be their modernization as they lack modem risk
management processes, adequate accounting and information systems and modem banking management
practices.

33. 
The Bank has made an important contribution to the modernization of the payment system
and the diagnostics of the banking sector building on an excellent dialogue with the Central Bank

and the Ministry of Finance. The Financial System Infrastructure Modernization project (2001-2006),
ongoing at the time the CAS was approved, helped enhance infrastructure for basic financial services,
including a modem inter-bank payment system, with the support of the central bank, Banque d'Alg6rie
(BA). Although around 70 percent of the original operation was cancelled, the Government implemented
successfully the cancelled components of the Bank Project using its own resources. A modem banking
payment system (RTGS) was implemented, including a supporting telecommunications infrastructure that
allows faster and more secure transactions. The Payment Systems TA (2005) complemented this program.
In addition, a joint World Bank-IMF Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP), carried out in 2004
and updated in 2007, provided a solid knowledge base of the financial sector's vulnerabilities and
development challenges, which informs the dialogue of the Bank and the IMF with the authorities up to
today. A TA program was implemented by the World Bank in cooperation with the French Government
on anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing. This program, completed in February 2006,
was aimed at assisting the Government to put in place an effective AML/CTF regime compliant with
FATF international standards.

34. 
The CAS also helped improve the mortgage market institutional framework which helped
further the development of the Algerian mortgage market. The Mortgage Finance TA (2002-2007)
addressed the most important legal and administrative constraints affecting the mortgage finance market
in the banking system. This small operation helped put in place the main elements of an enabling
environment for a mortgage market. The project was rated as moderately satisfactory by the team and by
IEG because the new institutional framework had not been fully adopted by the time the project was
completed. Progress has nevertheless taken place since then. The Bank has also been assisting with
developing institutions that facilitate access to credit. The Bank of Algeria requested an RTA to
support the development of the credit risk registries. This RTA, done jointly with the IFC, is currently
under progress and should lead to significantly improve credit information.

III. 

Encouraging private sector participation in infrastructure services

Support for regulatory reform in the energy sector produced initial gains that did not

35. 
sustain over the CAS period. The Energy and Mining Technical Assistance project (EMTAL 2001-
2005) helped develop legislation in electricity, hydrocarbon and mining. That legislation was approved
but Government policy shifts in the infrastructure sectors limited the progress in this area. The Bank
operation was cancelled. The ICR rating for development outcomes under this project was unsatisfactory,
as was IEG's rating. In hindsight, the adequacy of using technical assistance to drive deep institutional
change proved to be inadequate in this particular case. In the meantime, the Government has maintained
the original institutional structures in electricity and hydrocarbons and has relied on public investment
plans of considerable size.

50

36. 
The cooperation in transport produced mixed results. A Transport Technical Assistance
(2001-2007), aiming to set up a policy and institutional framework encouraging competition and private
participation in infrastructure was completed but rated as unsatisfactory. This small operation sought
substantial transformation of the transport sector in urban transport, ports, airports and railways, including
the BOT subway concession for the city of Algiers, and the regulation of the sector. In hindsight, it turned
out to be overoptimistic to expect that such a small operation could induce such a broad transformation of
the sector. Still, the program had some impact. In urban transport, the impact has been satisfactory with
the contracting out of operations of the new Algiers metro and urban tram systems. The Bank has also
delivered a policy note on the Transport Road Map in 2005 and made recommendations in the road sector
at the joint request of the Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Public Works in May 2005. Lastly, the
East-West Expressway TA (2006) was also a relative success as most of the report's recommendations
were accepted by the Ministry of Public Works.

37. 
Algeria made significant progress in telecommunications through opening the sector to
competition and engaging the private sector. An important driver of these changes was a regulatory
reform of the sector that the Bank supported through the Telecommunications and Postal Sector Project
(2000-2006.) The regulatory reform opened the sector to competition. The ICR for the operation notes
substantive progress in all of the objectives set under the program. The team rated the results from the
operation as satisfactory; IEG rated it moderately satisfactory as the objective to privatize the public
telecom operator (Algerie Tl&om) was not achieved, as the Government decided to change course in this
area. Yet, substantive achievements were realized. The project helped increase access to efficient and
affordable communication services and opening the sector to competition and private participation.
Algeria's performance in the telecom sector is well placed in the region. Key factors of success behind the
positive outcome in telecoms were: (i) the Government commitment to a comprehensive set of reforms in
a crucial infrastructure sector; (ii) considerable progress on the legal and institutional framework, that
allowed the establishment of a level playing field for private operators to invest; and (iii) rapid
deployment of private capital, especially in the mobile sector, that quickly widened coverage, improved
technology and increased competition. The Bank continued to assist the Government in these areas even
after the loan closed through Bank-financed TA.

Cooperation with the IFC.

38. 
Cooperation between 
IBRD and IFC teams were coordinated during the CAS
implementation, particularly for the ICAs preparation and the Credit Registry RTA with the
Central Bank. IFC's program in Algeria has picked up in the last few years, and contributed to the
private sector development pillar of the CAS. With the opening of the IFC Algiers Offices in 2005, the
portfolio has increased from around US$74 million in FY04 to US$126 million by end-FYO9. In FY10,
the committed portfolio declined to $82 million due to the closing of two projects. The current portfolio
consists of equity investments in the financial sector, and a loan and equity investment in the cement
sector. In FY09, IFC had a record year in Algeria investing US$50 million in the ASEC Algeria cement
plant and a U$10 million guarantee to a leasing company (IFC was instrumental in helping to establish
the first leasing company in Algeria). In FY08, IFC took an equity investment of US$15 million in a
greenfield commercial bank with a focus on housing finance and MSME banking. In addition IFC
invested US$20 million in two private equity funds that target SMEs in the Maghreb and that have been
very active in Algeria. IFC also helped finance other projects that have since been repaid in the steel and
cement sectors.

39. 
IFC also executed a program of advisory services in the following areas: (i) agricultural
linkages; (ii) simplification of business creation; (iii) capacity building and training for business
associations; (iv) capacity building for exporters; (v) SME toolkit installation for SME ministry; (vi)

51

direct technical assistance for Arab Leasing Corporation on management and for Credit populaire
d'Algerie on risk management; (vii) training and information seminars on risk management, non-
performing loans; and (viii) SME financing, with the Central Bank. IFC is also engaging in a joint World
Bank-IFC project in establishing a credit registry at the Central Bank, and providing assistance on
developing a corporate governance code with private sector associations and the SME ministry.

Pillar III - Support the Government's efforts to articulate and implement a strategy for better
service delivery

40. 
Program Summary. This pillar had four focus areas: 
(i) developing human capital and
strengthening social protection; (ii) water and sanitation; (iii) housing; and (iv) strengthening natural
resources management. The program diverted substantially from the CAS and CAS PR plans. The
lending program was reduced from three loans planned (in solid waste management, water resource
management and urban housing) to one operation, the Second Rural Employment Project (US$95
million), cancelled shortly after it was approved, but implemented by the Government with its own funds.

41. 
Rating Summary. Bank's contribution to outcomes for the Third Pillar is rated Moderately
Satisfactory. Progress under this Pillar has been mixed and uneven across the several areas covered (see
Table 5 below). The only sector where CAS expected outcomes were met 
is Water Resource
Management, where a substantive RTA program contributed to institutional strengthening of the sector.
In addition, the Bank contributed to strengthening institutions for disaster preparedness, mainly through
the Ain Temouchent Emergency Earthquake Relief loan, already under implementation at the time the
CAS was approved. Poverty and social analysis received a strong impetus thanks to Bank's analytical
contribution. As an unexpected outcome under this pillar has been the preparation by the Bank, during the
last year of program under review, of a higher education quality enhancement plan, well accepted by the
Government and implemented with financing from the European Union.

Developing human capital and strengthening social protection

42. 
Despite a decline in the unemployment rate from close to 30% in 2000 to around 10. 2 % in 2009,
driven by economic growth and increased public investments, Algeria continues to face pressure in it
labor markets as better quality and more stable jobs are still needed for new job market entrants as well as
for the unemployed or the many that are employed in short term, low quality jobs and in the informal
sector. Indeed, most employment creation over the past years took place in low value-added sectors like
construction, services and the informal sector. Also, unemployment among educated youth and women

53

remains high. Furthermore, Algeria's social protection system is still facing challenges in the areas of
pension, unemployment insurance and labor regulation. Quality of education remains to be improved to
reduce the skills mismatch between the demand and the supply of skilled labor. Yet, impressive gains
were achieved in this sector especially in terms of universal access at all levels of compulsory education,
and in terms of participation of girls and enrollment in higher education.

43. 
The Bank's program has helped Algeria develop tools for the analysis of poverty. The
Poverty update (2004) helped the authorities undertake a household survey that updated the information
about poverty incidence and evolution of poverty in the country. It also helped the authorities build their
in-house statistical capacity. Although the Poverty Dynamics ESW (2005) was cancelled at the
Government's request, the authorities have recently requested support with the new household survey that
will update the information on poverty incidence. There is ample room for cooperation to deepen the
analysis on poverty and further build the local capacity.

44. 

The Bank provided technical assistance on health and education, but it is difficult to
ascertain its impact due to the limited number of activities. The TA on Social Insurance (2006) helped
strengthen institutional capacity of the Ministry of Health. The Bank also provided advisory services to
the Education Sector TA (2004) that included a cost analysis of the planned reorganization of the
secondary education system. In addition, the Bank supported enhancement of the higher education level
by a TA for Building Quality Assurance for Higher Education which concluded in June 2008.

45. 

The Bank supported with success the introduction of community-driven development
practices that helped generate incomes and employment in rural areas. The First and Second Rural
Employment Projects in particular contributed to generating employment among the rural population,
although the second loan was implemented mostly with Government funds after the suspension of
borrowing. Both loans had overall satisfactory ratings (both ICRs and IEG, with a MS for implementation
of the second loan by IEG).

II. 

Water and Sanitation

46. 
Bank assistance to the water sector has had a significant impact. A new water code, stressing
the need for sustainable development and use of scarce water resources, and for greater involvement of
the private sector, was adopted in June 2005. The strategy of the Authorities has been to accelerate
completion of urgent investments with national budget, launch alternatives schemes for water production
(desalination plants under BOT) and improve efficiency in water allocation and distribution (including
management contract with private international operators for water distribution in the largest cities,
starting with Algiers). The Water Resources Management Strategy report completed in June 2003, fleshed
out a detailed strategy for this sector which accounts for one of the largest components of Algeria's public
investment program. The Authorities requested in 2005 a Water sector RTA. The Water and Sanitation
RTA was designed in support of the water agency Algerienne des Eaux (ADE) and the National
Sanitation Office (ONA) to outsource management of public services of water service delivery and
sanitation in the cities of Oran, Constantine, Annaba and El Tarf. With this RTA, the Bank assisted the
Agency in elaborating the bidding documents for management of the water service delivery and sanitation
services for international private sector operators. The activity brought tangible results despite some
difficulties linked to the definitions of the objectives of some of its missions. 
Implementation delays,
including in recovering the payment for the program delivered, and changes in the sectoral orientation of
ADE and ONA, lead to the cancellation of a planned second phase of the assistance.

54

III. 

Housing

47. 

Despite major increases in social housing production over the past years, access to housing
and financing construction in Algeria remains critical, affecting mainly the middle class and the
poor. During the 1990s, this problem had been exacerbated by insecurity in some rural areas, leading to
increased demand 
for urban housing. The Government 
launched a publicly-funded program of
construction of a million new dwellings in response to housing shortages. In complement to this
ambitious program, further reforms of social housing policies are needed to reduce market distortions.

48. 
The Bank has conducted satisfactory project lending and TA in the housing area. Limited
activities were completed during the CAS, after a 2002 multi-stakeholder Housing Seminar and the
closing of the Low-income Housing Project in June 2003. The dialogue later weakened in this area and
did not lead to the expected Housing Market Strategy study (2004) proposed in the CAS. Moreover, the
originally planned Urban Housing Program was never implemented due differences with the approach
adopted by the Ministry of Housing in this sector. However, the satisfactory Mortgage Finance TA
project (2002-2007) addressed the most important constraints affecting the functioning of the mortgage
finance market, even if some of the key actions, particularly on the legislative side, took place so late that
their effect could not be measured by the end of the project.

49. 
The Bank helped Algeria build the institutional capacity to respond to natural emergencies.
In response to the catastrophic flooding that hit parts of Algiers in 2001, the Urban Natural Hazard
Vulnerability Project (2002-2007) provided a comprehensive response to reduce the vulnerability of the
most affected urban zones and improve the ability of Algerian institutions at the national level to cope
with natural disasters. This was originally not envisaged in the CAS. The amount of the operation was
then heavily reduced. Still, the team and IEG rated as moderately satisfactory the achievement of
outcomes and Bank performance. The ICR highlighted an increased awareness in the country to be ready
and prepared to respond timely and effectively to crisis. The authorities have also considered the Ain-
Temouchent Earthquake Emergency Reliefproject, completed in 2005, as best practice including in urban
design. The team and IEG rated satisfactory the achievements of development outcomes as most of the
objectives of the project were met.

IV. 

Strengthening Natural Resources Management

50. 
Despite progress over the recent years, the agricultural sector in Algeria continues to
produce below its potential. The country continues to depend on food imports for many products (such
as cereals, milk, sugar and oils). During the past ten years, the sector has implemented a rural
development strategy and a large agricultural and rural renewal program which improved the standards of
living of the rural population. Despite these efforts, yields remain low by regional standards as a result of
drought, limited use of inputs and fertilizers and limited diffusion of modem techniques. Dependency on
imports is high by regional standards (in 2006 food imports reached 18 percentage of total imports) and
Algeria is among the largest world importers of wheat.

The Bank had an active lending and AAA program in agriculture. In 2004, the Bank carried

51. 
out a Support to the Agricultural and Rural Strategy and financed the Rural Employment Project (REP,
1997-2005) aimed at promoting employment and economic growth in poor rural areas. This project was
in line with the country's rural development strategy and its results were very encouraging, hence the
decision by the Government to pursue a Phase II of the project, the Second Rural Employment Project
(REP-2), which was included in the CAS. Following suspension of external borrowing, the Government
decided nonetheless to implement with its own financing the REP-2 as designed with Bank support.
Following the successes under these two projects, the Government expressed interest in Bank technical
assistance for the modernization of its agricultural sector and the development of an agri-business

55

strategy. An agri-business study was delivered and follow-on studies were carried out with financial
support from the Canadian International Development Agency. Three new RTAs have been designed in
the course of FY09-FY10 
to implement Agri-business 
integrated poles; support 
the Ministry of
Agriculture and Rural Development's ambitious programs under its the rural development strategy; and
in the areas of statistical capacity. The sector has also benefited from Bank's support in reforming rural
credit.

52. 
In the environment area, many issues that the country faces are the legacy of past economic
policies. Despite a significant natural resource base, and substantial investments in physical and human
capital over the years, the country faces major environmental problems. The National Environmental
Action Plan (NEAP), completed with Bank's assistance in 2002, is one of the main instruments for policy
making in the field of environment and sustainable development. Government addressed land planning
with a National Master Plan for Land Use Planning "Le Schema National de l'Amenagement du
Territoire 2025 (SNAT)" following a participatory approach and, coordinated by the Ministry of Land
Use Planning, Environment and Tourism, re-examined by the Government Council beginning in March
2007.

53. 
Bank support included broad environmental management with a comprehensive technical
assistance component under the Industrial Pollution Control Project which closed in 2005. The
projects helped establish a legal and regulatory framework for the environment sector, build up the
capacity of the Ministry of Environment (MATE), and improve the management of the environmental and
pollution abatement Fund. The Bank has also supported MATE with funding from the FEF and the
METAP, until the Ministry requested formal support through four RTAs in the areas of eco-tourism, the
environment and the creation of competitiveness growth poles. All are currently under preparation.
Responding to a request by the MATE, two RTAs were designed and launched in December 2007 on (i)
capacity building and institutional strengthening in the municipal solid waste sector, and (ii) capacity
building in the area of Clean Development Mechanisms. Implementation of the two RTAs has been
welcome by the Government, although implementation has been slow mainly due to the lack of an
existing legal framework and changes in counterparts.

V. 

Measuring Bank's Performance during the CAS Period

54. 
Based on the analysis above, this Completion Report rates Bank performance during the
CAS and the period thereafter as Moderately Satisfactory. The Bank's team faced the challenge of
implementing an ambitious program that for the most part had been designed before 2003, at a time when
the reform momentum was strong and the need for external finance still relevant. Following the decision
to reduce external borrowing, no new project proposed under the CAS was approved and the projects
already in place were heavily reduced or cancelled. The CAS Progress Report took note of the non-
borrowing policy of the Government, however policy shifts (as in the areas of privatization or
infrastructure sectors) happened after the preparation of the Progress Report. Faced with an evolving
policy environment and project cancellations, the Bank maintained a very limited dialogue mainly
through technical assistance financed by the Government and by the Bank. Without a presence on the
ground, with limited resources and a scattered program which led to RTA in only two sectors, the Bank
faced the difficult task of resuming dialogue and supporting the formulation of a more strategic approach
in the partnership.

55. 
The shift in the Government policy impacted substantially the implementation of an already
over-ambitious program. In hindsight, Algeria's development needs in terms of infrastructure and social
services received greater attention and priority by the authorities, when compared to the institutional and
regulatory reforms that were expected at the time the CAS was prepared. Additionally, the economic
recovery and the major increase in fiscal revenues stemming from the rising hydrocarbon exports,

56

provided the Government with the fiscal space to finance from its own budget a large investment plan to
upgrade the infrastructure in all sectors and expand access to basic services to the population. Social
transfers were also increased. These policies, in the context of regained stability and the need to improve
the standards of living and the most pressing needs of the population, clearly took precedent vis-d-vis
market reforms.

56. 
Despite these unexpected difficulties and the scale-down of the program, Bank support to
Algeria's reform process has generally been timely and useful, and in a few instances pivotal. In a
number of cases (Water, Telecommunications, Transport, Solid Waste Management), the diagnosis and
recommendations of the Bank's work were endorsed by the client, but no immediate follow-up involving
the Bank Group was agreed upon. This was most often due to changes in the pace of reforms in these
areas, or shifting priorities for the Government. In some instances (like in higher education) diagnostic
work that was endorsed by the authorities, led to support by other international partners who could
provide free assistance for implementation of reforms using grant funding. The most important of these
was the EU MEDA, a 2001-04 program of £336 million, and a 2005-07 National Indicative Program
(PIN) of E106 million.

A. 

Coordination with other Development Partners

57. 
There was close coordination and consultation with the donor community during the
elaboration of the CAS. Meetings were organized regularly to keep partners informed of the discussion
the Bank was leading with the Government and to exchange on program contents. During CAS
implementation, the Bank worked with the IMF to prepare the FSAP. Cooperation with UNDP and an EU
SME Program materialized through co-financing in 2004 and 2008 to deliver the first and second
investment climate assessments (ICAs). The Bank partnered with the EC on the water resources sector
through the organization in 2005 of a joint international seminar on the reforms and development of the
sector, and through close coordination in other areas of reforms, such as in the telecom sector. Very
limited coordination happened on programs implementation, as all partners were affected by the
Government policy to reduce borrowing. Also, several pieces of analytical work and technical assistance
(Telecommunications, Transport, and Higher Education) were used by the European Union or adopted by
the Government. Some of their recommendations were implemented through Government funding or
through grants of other international partners. The various pieces of work on the business environment
(ICA, Doing Business TA, Judicial and Legal Review, etc.) have either been used by counterparts to
design ongoing reforms (e.g. business entry, industrial land, labor code reform, and company law reform),
or have led to larger technical assistance activities (TA to one-stop-shop, RTA on Credit Registry with the
central bank, EU large TA program in the legal area). In addition, the dialogue with partners continued
and it resumed formally during consultations on the new CPS.

B. 

Program

58. 
Lending. As of end of June 2009, the World Bank had approved 73 projects in Algeria for a total
of US$5,912 million. Only one project was approved during the CAS period under review, the Second
Rural Employment loan, was approved in 2003 for US$95 million, but was later cancelled in 2006 for an
amount of US$87 million. The last Bank project, the Budget System Modernization, closed in February
2009.

59. 
Portfolio Quality. IEG reviews of ICRs indicate that there is no disconnect and that quality
was overall satisfactory, with seven out of nine ICRs rated Satisfactory (See Table 6 as well as annex
2). Portfolio quality was low throughout CAS implementation, partly due to implementation delays
inherited from the ongoing portfolio. A substantial percentage of portfolio commitments, US$47million,
or 7 percent of commitments at the time, was cancelled well before the new debt policy, mainly due to

57

restructuring requirements. Portfolio quality deteriorated further in FY04 with 27.3 percent at risk
projects partly due to insufficient capacity and lack of familiarity with Bank procurement procedures.
Following a Country Portfolio Performance Review in FY04, steps were taken to improve quality at entry
and portfolio performance, particularly through project-specific seminars to disseminate best practices on
procurement and financial management. Of the five problem projects at the beginning of FY04, the Water
Supply and Sewerage project and the Privatization TA project closed in FY04 after being in problem
project status for 18.3 and 7.4 months respectively. Two projects were restructured in FY05 and
upgraded. The Transport TA was upgraded in FY06 but then downgraded again in FY07 due to
implementation delays. The percentage of projects at risk improved to 22.2 percent in FY05 and declined
to zero percent in FY06. It then deteriorated to 33.3 percent in FY07 following the downgrading of the
Transport TA project. The Budget Modernization Support Project was the only operation under
implementation between 2007 and February 2009, and it remained in problem status throughout (based on
the classification of portfolio quality used by the Bank). The ICR rated the project as Moderately
Unsatisfactory.

The IBRD Portfolio has decreased from 11 projects (net commitment of US$515.3 million) in
FY04 to 0 projects as of March 2009. The disbursement ratio declined from 11.3 percent in FY04 to 8.9
percent in FY05 and increased slightly to 9.7 percent in FY06. Disbursement lag has been very high
throughout the period FYO3-07, and was highest in FY06 at 81.4 percent. IEG evaluated a sample of 6
completed projects that exited in FYO3-06. Only one third of the projects were rated Satisfactory in both
outcomes and likelihood of sustainability.

C. 

Reimbursable Technical Assistance (RTA)

61. 
Since 2002, the Bank and the Government have signed seven RTA contracts all completed
by the time the CPS was finalized. As for other AAA tasks, no individual evaluation of the four RTAs
completed is available, although some had been included in the QAG review undertaken in mid 2006.
Modernization of the Credit Registry - Joint WB/IFC Project . The objective of this RTA is to assist
the Central Bank of Algeria to modernize and develop its credit bureau. The RTA has led to the selection
of the most suitable vendor for the modernization and the development of the national Credit Registry.
Co-implementing this RTA with the IFC helped enhance the effectiveness of the project provided a

58

coherent and consistent response. WB/IFC recommendations have been followed by the CBA, although
in the end the approach adopted to implement the recommendations differed from the original advice: the
WB/IFC advocated the implementation of a private credit registry instead of a public credit registry; BA's
original request was for a Public Credit Registry. After Bank/IFC study and findings, a Private Credit
Bureau was recommended as a better solution for Algeria since the market conditions existed; however,
after discussions and in agreement with WB, it was decided to suggest a phased approach, starting with
the establishment of a Public credit registry with full Credit Bureau functionality and moving to the
design of the delegation of the PCR to the private sector. Lessons Learned: despite delays 
in
implementation from this client-funded activity, an element of donor funding in the RTA helps build
consensus and ownership. Future designs should better take into account possible project delays and the
addition of activities that may be necessary to achieve success, and budget for such uncertainties.

62. 
The Water and sanitation RTA aimed to support the Ministry of Water Resources and the
Water Agency (Algerrienne des Eaux, ADE) in the outsourcing the management of water supply and
sanitation services in the cities of Annaba, Constantine and Oran. The agencies have made used of Bank's
advice, used the bid packages and the processes were extremely successful, with a high number of bids
received and the services successfully outsourced. The outcome of the activity is tangible, despite
complex implementation arrangements and delays in recovering the costs of the activities. Lessons
learned: deliverables and timeline should be clearly spelled-out in the contractual arrangements with the
client. Several changes of TTLs on the Bank's side may hinder implementation. This RTA was supported
by the highest level of Government, but 
implementation of the recommendations 
required very
controversial policy and institutional changes to be implemented at level of the administration.
Mechanisms to build consensus among all decision makers and affected parties could be built in the
design of the RTA.

63. 
Procurement advisory assistance 
to SONATRACH. The objective was 
to bring the
procurement documents and practices of Sonatrach in line with international good practice, in two phases.
The RTA prepared procurement documents to help Sonatrach in the drafting of its own guidelines and
procedures through direct advisory of the region's procurement manager and joint workshops. The
guidelines were adopted by Sonatrach and are used in the energy sector overall. Quality of documents and
procedures were significantly improved even if not all recommendations were endorsed and adopted.
Working with the main sector operator and influencing the whole Energy sector, Bank's leverage and
impact went beyond the scope of the activity.

64. 
Public Investment Project Evaluation - Caisse Nationale d'Equipement et de Diveloppement
(CNED) The objective of this RTA was to reformulate the missions and actions of CNED improve the
efficiency of public investments. Guidelines for the selection, implementation and evaluation of large
public infrastructure investments were prepared and have informed the practice of CNED, Ministry of
Finance and infrastructure ministries 
(Public Works, Transports, and Water). The activity was
implemented successfully, despite a delay of over two years Lessons learned: complex bureaucratic
arrangements to put in place the contract delayed implementation of the activity and caused a change in
the design.

VI. 

Lessons Learned

65. 
Flexibility in adapting to Government's evolving priorities paid off The Bank remained
engaged after the suspension of borrowing and in spite the Government's increased attention to
implementing the massive Public Investment Program, financed from oil revenues. While responding to
the evolving demands, the Bank was able to maintain a dialogue only in some sectors, mainly where
engagement had been longer and conducted through lending.

59

66. 
Instruments of cooperation evolved by mutual agreement as the parties sought to continue
cooperation after the suspension of borrowing. The CAS Progress Report foresaw a tactical shift that
maintained broadly the areas of engagement but emphasized delivery through RTA, Bank AAA and other
similar instruments. Although the process of experimentation took time, the partners have come to an
operational understanding of the RTA instrument and the circumstances under which it is likely to be the
most effective: mainly, the provision of complementary AAA, a strong Bank team that maintains
continued presence, a strong and capable counterpart, and a multiannual framework.

67. 
Continuity and commitment. Despite the difficulties the CAS program made significant
contributions, in part because the Government continued the program envisaged under the CAS with its
own resources.

68. 
Dialogue. Several AAA activities have contributed to promoting dialogue between the Bank and
individual ministries/entities. However, they have had little impact on inter-ministerial dialogue in the
absence of coordination on the Bank program, an issue which was significantly improved after 2008.
Moreover, actual dialogue with the client has been relatively weak due to delays in providing feedbacks
on draft report and recommendations. For certain tasks, dissemination beyond the immediate Government
interlocutors has been difficult and for other tasks, broader dissemination within Government has been
through seminars or similar events. For this reason, an unusually high number of Bank reports were not
finalized, and only a few were published.

69. 
Relevance. Although most tasks had policy relevance, many of the key issues of critical
importance for Algeria's future (e.g., decentralization, public administration reform) have remained
outside the dialogue with the Bank, with the notable exception of the Budget Modernization Project.
Moreover, because of the demand-driven and ad hoc way in which the AAA activities were developed
and implemented, there were only limited linkages and synergies across the different tasks.

70. 
Policy Reforms. Various 
factors contributed 
to slowing policy 
reform and structural
transformation. In areas where diagnosis and recommendations provided through Bank's work were
endorsed by the client, the limiting factors were the lack of consensus among stakeholders affected by the
reforms, problems of implementation capacity, a growing complacency that difficult reforms could be
postponed given the oil windfall. Some of these factors 
led to limited follow-up actions and
implementation of recommendations. In addition, limited consultations on reforms, which included only
Governmental stakeholders, and the absence of dissemination of results of analytical work and project
implementation, precluded systematic discussions 
that might have helped 
identify key areas of
cooperation and to gain buy-in by diverse stakeholders.

71. 
Implementation. Contractual arrangements supporting the activities should involve detailed
deliverables, including final outputs as well as intermediate delivery outputs, with clearly defined services
and outputs (including missions) and a detailed calendar of implementation.

Recommendations stemming from the lessons learned:

72. 
Continued engagement should maintain realistic expectations: the review of the last CAS and of
the implementation of recent programs shows that the Bank can positively contribute even within the
confines of a program channeled through RTAs. Expectation of broad impact should however be tamed
and replaced by a precise description of the outcomes of the engagement, as well as the complementary
work of the authorities and the impact that both can deliver. In such environment, the effectiveness of
Bank's assistance will depend on the high quality of its assistance and supporting teams and on ownership

60

by the client. This will be highly dependent on the ability of the counterparts to display sufficient
absorptive capacity and engagement through strong ownership.

73. 
Keep a flexible approach to the design and implementation of the WBG program: Interestingly,
some of the sectors that have proven to benefit from a sustained areas of dialogue between the Bank and
the client country were not included in the original 2004 CAS, pointing to the need of designing the
strategies with enough flexibility to accommodate the shifting of client demand as circumstances change.

74. 
World Bank Group program impact will depend on the quality of the supporting teams: to have
an impact the Bank program approach should be the continuous engagement of high quality teams, as
sporadic interventions have not produced results.

75. 
Limited dissemination and consultations: the opportunities for broad consultations and the wide
dissemination were not sufficiently used in Algeria. Narrower, well tailored dissemination to the relevant
audiences remains feasible and useful to help identify key areas of cooperation and to gain buy-in by
diverse stakeholders. In addition, the Bank can still maintain a pro-active advocacy position by providing
access to global knowledge and acting as catalyst for regional issues of relevance to Algeria.

Appendix 3

Consultations Report

Context

1. 
As part of the preparation for a new framework of strategic cooperation (Country Partnership
Strategy, CPS) between the World Bank and the Algerian Government, which will be based essentially on
repayable technical assistance, targeted consultations were held throughout the strategy preparation process.

2. 

The consultations involved the following phases:

* Domestic consultations and technical sectoral meetings. These meetings were held by the Algerian
Government and together with the Bank with the various sectors that had expressed a wish to see the
Bank support their development efforts. They were intended to lay the groundwork for dialogue on
the strategic partnership framework and led to the formulation of a matrix of repayable technical
assistance projects and analytical studies to be financed by the World Bank over the next three years.
One specific meeting (June 2009), the purpose of which was to reconcile the various actions and
ensure intersectoral coordination concerning a number of projects, was particularly helpful and
facilitated identification of needs for coordination and for the pursuit of synergies.

* External consultations. These consultations were held with the community of donors and lenders
and development agents (November 2009 and February 2010) and enabled participants to share
information on the issues at the core of the strategy and the sectoral activities that the Bank planned
to carry out over the next three years. This exchange of information was intended to enable the
community of donors and lenders to envisage improving the coordination of their individual efforts
and working together so as to provide the Algerian Government with a coherent, coordinated
response in areas of joint interest. Lastly, a day of consultation with Algeria's civil society was
organized jointly with the Algerian Government on February 2, 2010. This report presents a
summary of the discussions that took place during that phase.

3. 
The objectives of the consultations with civil society were to (i) enable staff of the World Bank
Group to have discussions with various segments of society so as to gain a better grasp of the developmental
challenges faced by Algeria; and (ii) present and explain the contents of the new CPS and describe the
themes on which the Algerian Government and the Bank agreed to work together over the next three years.

4. 
The day of consultation on February 2, 2010 was organized jointly with the Government, which
wished to participate fully in the preparations for the day's deliberations. After the formal opening by the
Director-General of External Economic and Financial Relations of the Algerian Ministry of Finance and the
Bank's Country Director for the Maghreb, a brief presentation was made on the new partnership framework,
the key areas of cooperation, and means of providing support, such as technical assistance, analytical studies,
and capacity building (training, etc.).

5. 
That introduction was followed by sessions based on the three pillars of collaboration to be
developed in the new strategy, namely: pillar I: growth enhancement and economic diversification, pillar II:
sustainable development, and pillar III: support for the framework for economic policy implementation,
assessment, and outlook.

6. 
Each session began with a brief presentation of the World Bank's experience in the area and the
themes to be covered. A sectoral representative of the Algerian administration also made a brief presentation

65

on the Government's achievements and priorities with respect to each pillar. The floor was then opened for
discussions.

Pillar 1: Growth 
recommendations

enhancement and 

economic diversification: discussions 

and principal

7. 

Overall, the discussions on this pillar were generally centered on the main obstacles or constraints to
the implementation of a strategy of diversification and non-oil growth, which would pave the way for Algeria
to become less vulnerable to oil price fluctuations. Despite efforts made by the Algerian Government in
recent years to implement a strategy aimed at promoting the productive industrial sector, it would seem that
the financial windfall and the abundance of resources have tended to encourage the importation, rather than
the production, of goods. Oil taxation, on which the Government budget is heavily dependent, means that the
bulk of the State's resources is channeled toward the development of the energy sector, to the detriment of
other sectors, especially the productive private sector that could contribute to diversification of the Algerian
economy. The issues of human resources, capacity building, the transfer of expertise and know-how, and the
development of the banking sector and the ICTs were also raised as equally fundamental to the success of the
diversification of the Algerian economy. Finally, it is important for forums of discussion and analysis, such
as the general planning commissariat, to be given the means to undertake these medium- to long-term
strategic discussions in a coherent and coordinated way.

Pillar 2: Sustainable development: discussions and principal recommendations

8. 
After a lengthy presentation of the main challenges and achievements as regards the environment
and sustainable development, participants specifically stressed the need for a platform for prospective
analysis, aimed at weighing the growth problems that Algeria will have to face in the future and at
configuring, for the long term, the principal parameters that shape sustainable development, including the
environment.

9. 
It is also important to note the value of impact studies on environmental management and of
participation by civil society in the context of a participatory approach.

Pillar 3: Framework for public policy implementation, assessment, and outlook

10. 
Improving policy formulation and evaluation capacity, including statistical capacity and better
information sharing, was 
also a theme that was repeatedly highlighted as a priority during these
consultations to achieve a more efficient use of resources and improve the effectiveness of the public sector,
in particular in delivering public investment programs.

66

Appendix 4

Medium Term Macroeconomic Framework

Growth and Prices

1. 
Over the next four years (2011-2014) the Algerian economy is expected to grow modestly in the
context of stable prices, a comfortable balance of payments surplus and a manageable fiscal deficit. At the
currently forecast prices for oil and gas, Algeria's real GDP should grow at around 3.6 percent per annum on
average during 2011-2014.

2. 
Table 1 provides the key aspects of the growth projection for the medium term. Real GDP will grow
by 2.4 percent in 2010 and then stay between 3.4 and 3.7 percent for the next three years. This is based on
very high investment rates. The gross investment rate is expected to be 45 percent of GDP in 2010 and to
stay around 44 percent over the next three years. High rates of investment are, in turn, based on the
assumption that hydrocarbon prices will stay high and will provide a comfortable stream of revenues to
support public spending. Oil prices are projected to rise from $76.2 per barrel in 2010 to $86 per barrel by
2014. As a result, the role of the hydrocarbon sector will remain very important with an average share of 36
percent of GDP over the next four years. The non-hydrocarbon sector will also play an important role. Non-
hydrocarbon GDP is projected to grow at 5.3 percent in 2010 and at 5.3 percent thereafter till 2014.
Inflation, as measured by the consumer price index, is expected to continue a steady decline from 5 to 3.7
percent per annum by 2014.

3. 
The current account balance, which had fallen to a surplus of only 0.3 percent of GDP in 2009 as oil
prices declined, is expected to climb up to 8.5 percent of GDP in 2010 and rise further to between 9 and 10
percent of GDP in the next three years. This pattern is driven largely by the assumption that merchandise
imports will decline much faster as a proportion of GDP than merchandise exports, partly because of controls
that have recently been imposed on importing activities. Thus merchandise imports are expected to fall from
around 23.9 percent of GDP in 2010 to 22.4 percent in 2014 while merchandise exports will decline by a

67

larger margin from 36.3 percent of GDP to 34.9 percent over the same period. Foreign investment is
expected to decline modestly from 1.4 percent of GDP to 1.1 percent.

4. 
The trade forecasts suggest that gross reserves will continue rising, and are expected to reach almost
US$226 billion in 2014 (or 46 months of imports). Thus Algeria's external position will remain very strong
over the medium term.

5. 
The fiscal balance, which swung into deficit in 2009, will stay in deficit throughout the next three
years as an ambitious public investment plan is pursued. As a percentage of GDP, however, the fiscal deficit
is expected to decline from 6.8 percent in 2010 and turn into a surplus of 2.6 percent in 2014 as the
expenditure ratio declines faster than the revenue ratio. Public expenditures are expected to decline from
42.2 percent of GDP in 2010 to 34.4 percent in 2014 while revenues decline much less from 38.4 percent of
GDP to 37.1 percent. In any case, fiscal deficits are not a source of concern over the medium term because
Algeria has a very low stock of debt of only $5.3 billion (3.8 percent of GDP) as of 2010, which can be
easily financed from domestic or external sources.

6. 
Possible sources of risk to this macroeconomic scenario lie in the volatility of fuel and food prices.
If oil and gas prices decline significantly, Algeria's fiscal and external balances will be affected adversely.
This will also be the outcome if food prices rise significantly as they did in 2008 since Algeria is a significant
importer of food that is provided to the public at considerable subsidy. But such price volatility is not
expected to affect growth substantially because Algeria has accumulated significant reserves to undertake
countercyclical spending for several years.

Employment and productivity concerns in the medium term

7. 
Comfortable levels of reserves and good prospects for sustained revenues from hydrocarbon
resources have, however, delayed reforms that could have strengthened the economy in many ways. The
Algerian economy continues to be dominated by State-owned enterprises. This has limited its employment
generating capacity and resulted in structurally high levels of unemployment. At present, the unemployment
rate is 10.2 percent. When hydrocarbon prices are high and Government spending is high, jobs are created
but mostly in low productivity sectors (e.g., real estate, construction, Government services). Another way of
looking at this relationship is to note that Algeria gets relatively little growth for the very high rates of
investment that it incurs. In other words, its investment efficiency is low.

8. 
Breaking out of the existing pattern of low employment and low productivity growth will require a
renewed emphasis on market oriented reforms. Earlier in the decade, the Govermment had adopted plans for
reforming public enterprises and improving the environment for private businesses by simplifying taxes,
enhancing access to finance, promoting competition, providing imported inputs at low tariffs, and making
labor markets more flexible in terms of hiring and firing. These ambitions were not pursued with much vigor
through the rest of the decade, however, as rising international prices for oil and gas provided an easy source
of revenues to sustain public enterprises, employ people in public investment projects, and fund entitlement
programs such as food and energy subsidies and pensions. As long as hydrocarbon prices stay high, the
incentive to develop a more efficient economy or a more efficient social protection system will remain weak.
This is a structural liability and Algerian policymakers should consider putting incentives and institutions in
place that can mitigate this and prepare the economy for a time when Algeria may not have easy access to
large hydrocarbon revenues and growth may have to come from other sources.

Appendix 5

Challenges to the Transformation of the Algerian Economy

A. 

Strengthening Growth through Diversification of the Economy

1. 

Productivity of the non-oil economy is lower in Algeria than in other middle-income oil producing
countries and that gap seems to be widening. Private investment into the nonoil economy is quite low and is
mostly domestic as the bulk of the FDI goes to the oil and gas sectors. FDI has grown in recent years but
remains worryingly low at 1.5% of GDP in 2010. Sources of growth analysis by the IMF shows that the
factor accumulation has been the main source of the GDP growth from 1981 to 2005 with negative total
factor productivity residual (Source: IMF 2009).

2. 
The evidence seems to suggest that the limited development of the private non-oil economy is due to
a weak investment climate that does not encourage competition, exports and innovation. Compared to other
oil economies, Algeria does not seem to suffer from the Dutch disease. However, it suffers from excessive
vulnerability of oil price variation and over the past decades, Algeria was affected by the largest volatility in
its terms of trade among all countries in the world. More important than the disincentives created by the oil
dominance, the main causes of insufficient private investment and competitiveness reside in the poor
business environment that governs economic activity. A variety of constraints to business development make
it difficult to take advantage of emerging opportunities. In particular, the constraints to open and operate a
company, to access credit or land, and to trade internationally, are particularly severe. The result is that new
opportunities in more sophisticated activities are quite limited and the productivity gap with the rest of the
world continues to increase.

3. 
Algeria's ranking of 124 in the trading across borders indicator in the World Bank 2011 Doing
Business is corroborated by a low ranking in logistics, where the country ranks especially low (130 of the
logistic performance 
index). Efforts at improving infrastructure must be accompanied by institutional
reforms that lower transaction costs for imports and exports. Unfortunately, the absence of export growth
over the past years is often interpreted as a sign that trade liberalizations did not deliver any benefits. In the
face of surging imports, the Government has recently put in place a series of trade restrictions that limit the
progress of the past years in terms of openness.

The need to improve the investment climate

4. 
Despite efforts to reform, Algeria's regulatory environment for businesses lags the region and
middle income countries more generally. According to the 2011 Doing Business, Algeria ranks 136 in the
world, with no change in rank from 2010, however, still lower than most other countries in the MENA and
down from 134 in 2009. Algeria ranks particularly low in registering a company, transferring property and
paying taxes. A survey of a representative sample of manufacturing and services firms conducted in 2007
identified the following constraints to private sector development in Algeria : corruption and uncertainty in
the implementation of regulations and in dealings with public administrations; unfair competition from the
informal sector; access to finance; electricity; tax rates and access to property. Distortions in industrial land
markets, where a small private market coexists with a dominant public market that allocates plots
administratively, lead to artificial shortages. Close to 53 % of firms ranked 'access to land' as a major or
severe constraint in 2007. This is one of the highest rates among developing countries where similar surveys
have been conducted. The distortions in industrial land markets will only disappear if greater space is made
for private sector participation in land development and industrial zone management.

70

Strengthened financial intermediation as a key element of any diversification strategy

5. 
The Algerian financial system remains dominated by public banks and is small given the income of
the country. The banking industry accounts for more than 90 % of financial assets and is dominated by public
banks, which own around 90 % of total banking assets. Liberalization of banking sector brought in 14 new
banks, but with privatization plans put on hold, the Government decision to retain a dominant role for State
banks increases the importance for sound governance structures and operational improvements of public
sector banks as a way to improve efficiency in credit allocation. Up to now the efforts of the Government at
reform and modernization have concentrated on improving the payment system and creating institutions that
make it easier for small and medium enterprises to access credit. The legal framework for the mortgage
market, jointly with acceleration in issuing regular property titles has also improved. In addition, the
Government has taken some steps to improve governance by defining CEO's objectives in performance
contracts and by appointing a skilled independent director in each Board.

6. 
Credit remains insufficient despite rapid growth in recent years. Credit to the economy has been
growing at a rate faster than the economy but it is still only around 30 % of GDP in 2010, a low percentage.
Lack of capital has constrained banks from lending due to stringent capital adequacy rules. Less than 10% of
the bank credit goes to households, of which half finances mortgage loans. Credit to companies remains
highly concentrated. To improve access to credit by the SME sector the authorities have commanded public
banks to expand credit to the SME sector by 20 % per year. However, the lack of appropriate risk
management tools and internal control weakens the effectiveness of this policy. The launching of the new
credit registry expected in 2011-2012 will help banks identify creditworthy borrowers; further strengthening
the legal and regulatory environment and the reduction of legal uncertainty for the private sector to operate,
such as the prohibition of consumer loans in 2009, should improve incentives to lend to the SME sector.

7. 
A major transformation of the banking and financial sectors is needed to launch a process of
significant economic diversification. Looking forward, the modernization of the financial sector to improve
the quality of allocation decisions can be organized around three strategic priorities. The first priority is to
continue focusing on improving the governance and capacity of the public banks. The second will be to use
credit as an effective instrument to provide resources to small and medium companies, including technology
start-ups, especially in the service sector. The third priority centers on setting the institutional basis for the
sound development of the financial sector (banks, insurance companies).

Economic diversification requires sector-specific strategies

8. 

The country has yet to take full advantage of its agriculture potential. Although agriculture growth
has been positive, driven by domestic demand, output has been erratic and highly dependent on the weather.
The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MADR) has been implementing since 2002 a national
agriculture and rural development strategy, the National Agriculture and Rural Development Plan (PNDAR).
The strategy was updated in 2006 and, in 2008 the Government created a legal framework to support such
strategy ("Loin d'Orientation Agricole"). Government's key objectives are to: (i) improve food security
through agriculture production, (ii) increase productivity and competitiveness while protecting the use of
land and water resources; and (iii) promote agriculture as an economically, socially and ecologically
sustainable activity that promotes the development of the rural space and the rural populations. To achieve
such goals, the Government intends to improve institutional and legal framework, rural infrastructure, food
supply chains, and access to finance and credit, markets, information, training, and promote private sector
development. As regards food security and agricultural production, products targeted are cereals, milk,
potatoes, dry vegetable, meat and eggs, olive oil, dates, and seeds and seedlings.

71

9. 

Progress in telecommunications has been substantial but complementary actions are required to
keep the pace with innovation and implement an aggressive strategy of expanding ICT services. Major
reforms were implemented in the telecom sector between 2000 and 2005, with Bank's support, setting the
grounds for the current ICT legal, regulatory, institutional and sector structure in Algeria. This helped sustain
a telecom penetration and teledensity increased from 5.5% in 2000 to 90% in June 200918. Alg6rie T616com
(AT), the incumbent operator, was restructured and corporatized, but a planned privatization transaction was
delayed, and then called off in 2008 due to unfavorable local and global market conditions. At this stage,
most privatization transactions have stopped in Algeria since 2007. AT, as a State-owned company, suffers
from a public sector administrative culture in a highly competitive sector, but enjoys the benefits from public
sector support. Government has recently promulgated a new ICT Strategy, e-Alg6rie 2013, which should
facilitate a new wave of reforms in the telecom sector. The e-Alg6rie 2013 strategy is providing a new
platform and coordinated approach for eGovernment services to improve transparency and governance.
Administrations, enterprises and the population are expected to be the main beneficiaries of this activity.
Generally the sector profitability is decreasing and serious bottlenecks are developing in the broadband
networkl9 . Effective competition in the broadband market will depend of the establishment of a level-playing
field, and the postal and telecom regulatory authority (ARPT), will play a key role there. Quality of service is
also an issue in the form of saturated networks and high call drop rates. ARPT will need to address this for
the telecom and the Internet sectors, but it needs to acquire new tools and capacity in order to improve
effectiveness of its regulation on that sector, and prepare the next reform step which will be full sector
liberalization.

B. 

Promoting Sustainable Development and Reducing Spatial Disparities

10. 
Environmental challenges and spatial disparities issues remain paramount. Key environmental
issues include: (i) water scarcity (water availability comes to a low 350 m3 /inhabitant/year, far less than the
shortage 
threshold of 500 m3 /inhabitant/year); 
(ii) water quality caused by 
inadequate sanitation
infrastructure; (iii) land degradation and deforestation caused by a number of factors (for example, soil
erosion and salinization of soils has degraded approximately 12 million ha, and desertification threatens over
8 million ha of rangelands); and (iv) urban and industrial pollution. Environmental pressures as well as
economic concentration have exacerbated spatial disparities.

18 Teledensity is the ration of fixed and mobile lines per 100 inhabitants.
19 The issuances of 3G (or 4G) licenses and spectrum have been on hold since 2005. This has slowed the growth in the broadband
network, as there is no alternate provider. Only Algeria Telecom provides ADSL services and there is weak presence and competition
from WiMAX operators.

11. 

Together with economic growth and job creation, reducing spatial disparities and ensuring a
sustainable development path are important priorities of the Algerian Government. In line with the national

planning framework ("Sch6ma National d'Am6nagement du Territoire", SNAT 2025), the agricultural
development strategy as well as the industrial development strategy both plan the launch of integrated
sectoral competitiveness centers, starting in particular in lagging regions (Hauts Plateaux). The tourism
strategy also plan for the development of ecotourism in various Sahara regions. Despite a significant natural
resource base, and substantial investments in physical and human capital over the years, the country's
environmental problems are severe (the annual cost of environmental degradation is in the order of 3.6% of
GDP). In recent years, Algeria has developed the institutions and the legal framework to deal with such
challenges, but implementation is slow and the feasibility of the strategy needs to be demonstrated, including
through piloting some priority action.

12. 
The recommendations outlined in the SNAT 2025 indicate how the State intends to assure the
objective of social equity, economic effectiveness, and environmental sustainability. The SNAT spells out

actions necessary to address regional imbalances, including in urban and rural areas. It points out that Algeria
should address issues resulting from previous unsustainable development choices and deal with regional
imbalances and social disparities, constrained ecosystems, and depletion of natural resources due to
population increase and distribution. Major economic activities are concentrated in coastal areas to the
detriment of the higher plains (Hauts Plateaux) and the southern regions (R6gion Sud). These trends have
resulted in an uneven urban development, leading to the rapid growth of urban centers.

13. 
Algeria is also very vulnerable to earthquakes, ranking 18 out of 153 countries in global exposure to
earthquakes. Approximately US$ 30 billion in assets (5% of GDP) and 1.3 million people are estimated to be
exposed to earthquake losses and damages. The country has taken measures to respond to disasters. A
National plan of disaster prevention and organization of intervention and rescue was formulated in 1985.
This includes a program of action for fourteen identified natural and technological disasters. In addition,
national level hazard and risk assessments and national and regional seismic hazard maps are available. A
seismic survey telemetered network has also been installed nationally.

73

C. 

Strengthening the Institutions of Economic Planning, Monitoring, Evaluation and
Policy-Making

14. 
The State plays a prominent role in the economy of Algeria and its presence has been amplified as
oil revenues increased. With the increase in the price and production of oil and gas the share of the oil
economy gradually increased over the last decade. Public enterprises contribute around 20 % of the non-oil
GDP today and the private non-oil sector contributes around 45 % of the value of national production with a
concentration on construction, agriculture and services. The powerful presence of the State translates into a
bias towards State-led development where not only public investment dominates national interests, but it
absorbs complementary resources such as domestic savings through the financial sector. In addition, the role
of the State extends beyond the building of infrastructure and provision of services, into direct leadership
through public enterprises which continue to dominate critical sectors of the economy.

15. 
Algeria's State-led approach to development and transformation risks limiting the contribution of
private agents to economic development. An excessive role of the State introduces various risks to
competitiveness. The State and its agencies may absorb the bulk of the financial and human resources
making it difficult to meet other objectives diversify the economy. Entry in new sectors and innovation may
be penalized to the detriment of increases of productivity and hence depress income. Past experience shows
how limited incentives for reforms in Algeria as put on hold past initiatives intended to move the economy
closer 
to a market economy. In fact, with some significant exceptions, such as 
in mining and
telecommunications, the separation of the State as policy maker, regulator and owner of resources and public
enterprises continue to be too limited.

16. 
The strategic management of oil and gas resources will remain a formidable challenge for Algeria.
Algeria has made major progress in the management of revenues from oil and gas. It has delinked
expenditure from income flows, created an oil fund and channeled substantial resources into infrastructure
and improving human resources of the country. However, like in many other oil countries, the pressure to
spend that emerges during upswing periods is difficult to contain and creates patterns of behavior and
expenditure difficult to maintain during the downswings. Algeria faces this challenge now as the current
fiscal deficit as a percent of non-oil GDP does not appear sustainable over the long-term, hence the
importance of developing clear rules linking decision about public expenditure to the oil wealth, maintaining
a transparent and prudent management of reserves; and selecting public investment strategies compatible
with the absorptive capacity of the economy.

17. 

Looking forward, improvements in the Government capacity to plan, monitor and evaluate its
policies will be essential in all areas of policy-making. This is particularly true in the area of budget
execution and management, given the extraordinary size of the investment budget planned for the coming
years. It is also true in other areas 
like economic policy making, social services and environment
preservation. Algeria's ample budget resources will enable the State to continue to play an active role in all
development areas. Enabling the State to better plan, monitor and evaluate its policies becomes paramount in
this context. This is even more important that some of the recent policy choices-like in the foreign
investment and trade areas-do not fully match current international policy trends, and will therefore require
pragmatic monitoring and evaluation by the authorities to eventually fine tune the policy framework going
forward.

18. 

As part of the efforts to improve the efficiency ofpublic expenditure, Algeria must continue its efforts
to improve the quality of budgetary practice, including the streamlining and prioritizing the Public
Investment Program. Algeria has a clear legal and administrative framework for PFM and a reasonable
functioning PFM system, which provides for a satisfactory degree of financial controls and external audit.
The country has also made progress in merging capital and recurrent budgets providing a credible

74

macroeconomic framework for public finance and has reasonable PFM capacity. However, the system has
major weaknesses in budget formulation and execution, which are mainly of an institutional nature rather
than technical. Budget modernization, partially with the support of a World Bank Project, includes important
reform blueprints which are ready for implementation (most notably the Organic Budget Law, budget
classification, performance monitoring, and multi-year budgeting in place by 2012). When approved and
implemented, these changes would lead to a major improvement in the capacity of the country to align
budgetary allocations with national development priorities. Implementing planned reforms will require
clearing mostly political road blocks related to the relationship between the Ministry of Finance and other
ministries and agencies and between the central Government and regional authorities.

19. 

In terms ofplanning, monitoring and evaluation, the recent creation of a Ministry ofProspective and
Statistics signal the renewed focus of the authorities on these key functions of the State. Strengthening these
aspects of policy making started two years ago with the revamping of the General Commission for Planning
and Prospective, as well as the National Office of Statistics. One of its goals is to encourage Government
entities to think strategically and gradually improve the coherence among the various sector strategies, which
today are widely dispersed across the administration. It also aims to strengthen the statistical capacity of all
State entities and to develop expertise 
in policy planning, monitoring and evaluation. The recent
transformation of the General Commission into a full blown Ministry assisted by a State Secretariat of
Statistics is a sign of the growing importance of this function which is currently relatively weak.
