COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY PROGRESS REPORT  
FOR THE CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC 

1 OVERVIEW 

1. 
This Country Partnership Strategy Progress Report 
(CASPR) assesses 
the 
implementation of the World Bank’s FY09-12 Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for the Central 
African Republic (CAR). The CPS was prepared jointly by the World Bank Group (WBG) and the 
African Development Bank (AfDB) and discussed by the Board on September 3rd, 2009 (Report No. 
49583-CF). The CPS builds upon the Country Re-Engagement Note of mid-2004 which marked the re-
establishment of the WBG’s relationship with CAR, following a period of suspension due to CAR’s 
extended instability and accumulation of arrears, and the subsequent Joint AfDB/WBG Interim Strategy 
(JISN). 1 Given its emphasis on conflict, security and development, the current CPS also represents many 
of the key elements that are emerging from the Bank’s new corporate framework for Fragile States, 
including focusing on partnerships and responding flexibly to emerging needs while also helping to 
develop institutional capacity to ensure sustainability.  

2. 
In line with the new Africa Regional Strategy, the CPS has emphasized partnerships to 
help meet huge unmet needs regarding reconstruction and development. While the total volume of 
aid has increased since 2006, CAR still remains a donor orphan (its ODA per capita is US$41 compared 
to US$91 for Sierra Leone, US$104 for Cameroon and US$186 for Liberia). Significant collaborative 
efforts have been undertaken with partners such as the AfDB, the European Union (EU), the United 
Nations (UN) and the French Development Agency (AFD) to advance support at all levels. Examples 
include (i) the preparation of the CPS with the AfDB, (ii) the establishment of a Memorandum of 
Understanding (MOU) between the Government, the Bank, the EU and the AfDB to provide budget 
support, and (iii) donor coordination at the sector level to facilitate implementation including in transport, 
energy, community development, and urban development. The new IFC presence in the Country Office 
has resulted in an effective joint Bank/IFC collaboration with respect to improving the investment 
climate. Finally, a high level side event of the MDG summit in September 2010 also enabled the 
Government of CAR, the United Nations, the European Union, and the World Bank to focus international 
attention towards the peace building and development needs in CAR. This meeting laid the foundation for 
a donor Roundtable that is planned for June 2011.  

3. 
Frontloading resources in the early years of the CPS and leveraging the relatively small 
IDA 15 allocations to access alternative funding sources have spurred portfolio growth. As reflected 
within the World Development Report 2011 (WDR), the CPS balances the short-term need for results 
with longer-term investments to help institutions emerge. As a consequence, the World Bank’s 
commitments to CAR have grown rapidly from re-engagement in 2006 at around US$17 million to 
US$230 million in 2010 (see Figure 1 below). This amount is significantly higher than what was forecast 
in the CPS, and is all the more striking given CAR’s total IDA 15 allocation was $33 million. To respond 
quickly and flexibly to CAR’s emerging challenges, varied funding sources were tapped, including 
regional IDA, various World Bank-administered trust and vertical funds, and from exceptional IDA 
including the Crisis Response Window (CRW). This strategy has allowed for the initiation of almost all 
of the planned lending operations and knowledge activities, with the exception of one health project 
scheduled for FY12. All IDA financed operations were processed under OP 8.0 (Rapid response to Crises 
and Emergencies) in order to quickly support the Government’s response to the food, fuel and financial 
crises.

2 COUNTRY CONTEXT 

4. 
The CAR authorities continue to focus on efforts to strengthen political stability and 
consolidate the peace process throughout the country. An Inclusive Political Dialogue (IPD) organized 
in December 2008 in Bangui resulted in the adoption of a road map for full reconciliation. Its main 
recommendations included: (i) formation of a coalition government, including members of the opposition; 
(ii) implementation of a Disarmament, Demobilization and Rehabilitation (DDR) program; and (iii) 
setting up of an independent electoral commission to organize general elections in 2010. After three 
postponements, the presidential and legislative elections were held on January 23rd 2011 and results were 
certified by the Constitutional Court on February 12th, with the incumbent president declared the victor 
with 64 percent of the vote. A second round of legislative elections took place on March 27th 2011. 
Success going forward will depend upon effective internal political dialogue and an inclusive 
Government that represents the citizens’ interests. 

5. 
The security situation outside the capital remains tenuous. The Government faces continued 
insecurity outside of its capital, reflecting weak control over their territory and disagreements with rebel 
factions. The main areas of concern are the extreme north-east, where the CAR rebel group, Convention 
des patriotes pour la justice et la paix (CPJP), continues to attack the army, and the extreme south-east, 
where the Ugandan rebel group, the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA), continues to terrorize local 
communities. The withdrawal of the UN mission in Chad and the CAR, MINURCAT, effective since 
mid-November 2010, has further weakened the presence of security forces in remote areas of the country. 
The DDR process has also been slower than expected, further undermining the consolidation of peace.  

6. 
Since the end of conflict in 2003, economic growth has remained at an average of 2.5 
percent per annum, and poverty remains pervasive. CAR still has one of the highest poverty rates in 
Sub-Saharan Africa2, and is unlikely to meet any of the MDG targets3. In addition to the security 

2 The 2009 UNDP Human Development Report ranks CAR near the bottom of its Human Development Index 
(179th out of 182 countries). The overall poverty headcount ratio is 62 percent, with large socioeconomic and 
regional variations.   

3 The proportion of Central Africans living on $1 a day has decreased slightly to 62%  but it needs to be half of that 
in order to reach the 2015 goal, and the prevalence of underweight children under-five has increased since 2003 to 
nearly 30 percent, a rate nearly three times the MDG target.  

2 

 
                                                      
 
situation, low public investment in physical and social infrastructure and an unfriendly business climate 
remain major impediments to sustained growth. In 2008, CAR was also hit by a series of shocks, 
including the breakdown of the major hydro-power plant, followed by the worldwide price hike for food 
and fuel, and the global financial crisis. These events led to an overall reduction of real GDP of 1.5 
percentage points compared to the period 2006-2008. Nevertheless, preliminary estimates show a 
recovery in 2010 with real GDP growth of 3.3 percent and an inflation rate at 1.8 percent (down from the 
9.3 percent observed in 2008).  

7. 
Despite this difficult context, CAR has remained committed to implementing its reform 
program and has made good progress in stabilizing the economy and establishing a consistent 
record of satisfactory macroeconomic performance. In June 2009 CAR reached the completion point 
under the enhanced Highly Indebted Poor Countries Initiative (HIPC) which, together with the 
Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI), provided significant debt relief (59 percent of GDP)4. 
Achievement of the HIPC completion point in June 2009 was based on consistent and sustained 
governance efforts: CAR was the first country to move from decision point to completion point in less 
than two years, meeting twenty-one completion point triggers across eight sectors. The Bank’s 
Development Policy loans and technical assistance projects played an important role by: (i) providing 
space in the government budget for priority sector spending; (ii) strengthening overall public financial 
management and effectiveness of public spending; (iii) supporting transparency and accountability; and 
(iv) promoting institutional development, including enabling mechanisms for improving government 
efficiency. In 2006 CAR also embarked upon a three year program with the IMF. This was completed in 
September 2010 with all the reviews concluded – a first in its history with the Fund.  

3 PROGRESS TOWARD CAS OUTCOMES   

8. 
The CPS is showing results. A November 2010 Country Program and Portfolio Review 
assessed that four out of the eight CPS outcomes are on track, and are expected to be met by the end of 
the CPS period. The following section provides a broad account of progress to date, focused on results 
derived from the roll-out of the planned activities in each of the CPS’ strategic themes. 

A. Strategic Theme 1: Consolidation of Economic Governance and Institutional Capacity 
9. 
Considerable strides have been made in terms of improving Public Finance Management 
(PFM) (Outcome 1). As a result of efforts undertaken through the Bank’s Economic Management and 
Reform Grant (EMGRG III), the fourth in a series of Development Policy Operations (DPOs) as well as  
the AfDB’s Economic Reform Support Program, recent reforms include the review by the Court of 
Accounts of the use of the 2008 budget; the establishment of a single treasury account (down from 73 
accounts); and the publication on the Government website of all tax exemptions, which has led to an 
increase in tax revenues (from 8 percent of GDP to 8.7 percent).  Civil servant salaries are now paid 
regularly and domestic revenues are collected through commercial banks and transferred to the central 
bank (BEAC). The Government has also started to apply the new procurement code, but efforts are still 
needed to strengthen the deployment of the investment budget using competitive bidding. These efforts 
have also been supported by technical assistance provided from the Bank-administered LICUS Trust 
Fund and the Institutional Development Fund (IDF), which have focused on strengthening capacity in 
PFM and public procurement (See Table 1).  

4 Total debt reduction granted to CAR amounted to around Central African CFA 560 billion (US$1 billion 
equivalent) in nominal terms.

*Note: The Economic Management and Governance Reform Grant (DPO IV) was not envisaged within the CPS. The Bank was able to extend its 
support as a result of funds received through IDA’s Crisis Response Window.  

10. 
Good progress is noted with respect to transparency and accountability in natural 
resource management (Outcome 2). Technical assistance from the World Bank helped CAR become 
‘EITI Compliant’ in March 2011, a tremendous accomplishment for a country still emerging from crisis. 
Bank-financed budget support has also focused on strengthening the regulatory framework in the mining, 
forestry, and petroleum sectors in order to boost growth and employment. A new Mining Code was 
adopted by the Parliament in April 2009, and a revised forestry code has been formulated that calls for the 
return of a percentage of revenues to forest communities. Finally, the GoCAR recently signed a Voluntary 
Partnership Agreement (VPA) with the EU as part of the Forest Law Enforcement and Governance Trade 
support process (FLEGT) in December 2010. 

11. 
Establishing the institutional framework necessary to strengthen administrative planning 
and management capacity at central and local level is advancing, but from a very low base 
(Outcome 3). For rural areas, the Community Development Project Targeting Vulnerable Groups (US$20 
million) represents the Bank’s efforts to strengthen support beyond Bangui. After some initial delays, 
emergency funds have begun to be deployed to 102 communes to rehabilitate basic social infrastructure. 
In urban areas, the Emergency Urban Infrastructure Rehabilitation and Maintenance Project has focused 
capacity development efforts on strengthening the institutions responsible for the delivery of urban 
services including monitoring and evaluation, procurement, financial management, and community 
participation. These efforts have also been complemented by additional technical assistance, including 
‘CAR towards Sustainable Urban Management’, funded by the Cities Alliance Trust Fund.  Relevant 
technical assistance and training has also been provided through the AfDB’s Economic Planning 
Capacities Rehabilitation Support Project (PARCPE).  

12. 
Initial efforts to improve the investment climate are showing results, but significant 
challenges remain (Outcome 4). CAR’s private sector is small, hampered by insecurity, low capacity of 
SMEs, a weak business environment and poor infrastructure including unstable electricity. In addition, 
CAR was ranked 182nd out of 183 countries in the 2010 Doing Business Report. To address CAR’s 

4 

 
serious investment climate challenges, IFC helped establish the Joint Committee for the Improvement of 
the Business Environment, presided by the Prime Minister, and mandated to implement priority 
Investment Climate reforms. The Bank and the IFC also collaborated to include some private sector 
development related triggers within the latest DPO (EMGRG III). To date these efforts have resulted in 
reforms designed to reduce the cost of creating businesses (e.g., a reduction by more than half of the 
current business registration tax; from 150.000 to 70.000 CFA, (US$300 to US$140 equivalent) as well as 
in the cost of transferring properties (reduction by 50% of the transfer tax; from 15% to 7.50 %). The 
provision of political insurance through the issuance of MIGA’s guarantee to S.A. Orange in 2008 also 
contributed to helping the company to develop a global system for mobile communications (GSM) 
network and to provide internet services.  

B. Strategic Theme 2: Rehabilitation and Development of Basic Socio-Economic Infrastructure 
13. 
Good progress is being made with respect to improving infrastructure for regional 
economic integration from a very low base, though challenges remain on energy (Outcome 5). In 
transport, the Bank provided additional financing (US$67 million) to the ongoing CEMAC Transport and 
Transit Facilitation Project5 to fund the Boua/Garoua-boulaï road paving works on the border with 
Cameroon, which is the main component of the project in CAR; as well as to strengthen the road 
maintenance component. Despite delays, this outcome is largely on track; the proportion of road in good 
condition on the Douala - Bangui corridor increased from 50 percent in 2007 to 57 percent in 2010. In 
telecommunications, the Bank recently supported the launch of the US$215 million Central African 
Backbone project (CAB) to increase the geographical reach and usage of regional broadband network 
services and to reduce prices to all CEMAC countries. Work is now underway to prepare the second 
phase of the program that will support infrastructure investments to connect the CAB network to Chad, 
Cameroon and CAR. The energy sector presents significant challenges. Through the Emergency Power 
Response Project (US$8.0 million), the Bank, in partnership with the French Development Agency, has 
been working to support the national electric utility company (Enerca) to partially restore the electricity 
supply to its essential customers, by focusing on the rehabilitation of the Boali 1 and 2 hydropower 
facilities and to improve its financial and operational performance. Project efforts are advancing but the 
infrastructure remains in a critical state, the current generation capacity of 15 MW is insufficient to meet 
demand and electricity supply outside of the capital is minimal.  

14. 
Satisfactory progress has been made in relation to improving access to basic urban and 
community infrastructure (Outcome 6). In urban areas, an IDA exceptional allocation and Crisis 
Response Window (CRW) resources of US$24 million towards the Bank’s Emergency Urban 
Infrastructure Project helped to protect 46,600 people against periodic flooding, to provide access to year-
round passable roads to 290,000 people, and provide access to an operational solid waste management 
system to 112,000 people. In the aftermath of the floods, the Bank led an assessment that proposed a 
medium-term flood reduction and mitigation program. IDA is helping to implement this through an 
exceptional allocation of US$5 million aimed at natural disasters.  In rural zones, efforts will be supported 
through the Bank’s Community Development Project Targeting Vulnerable Groups (see paragraph 9) as 
well as the planned Community Reintegration Project (FY11). The latter is designed to strengthen 
community capacity in northern CAR, with particular focus on those areas with a high concentration of 
returning ex-combatants. 

5 This is an ongoing project financed by the AfDB, the French Development Agency and the EU.

15. 
Emergency assistance responded to the food crisis in 2008; efforts are under preparation 
to improve agriculture and livestock productivity (Outcome 7). The World Bank and the AfDB 
responded to the 2008 food crisis with emergency support of US$7 million and UA3.0 million 
respectively to support a school feeding program implemented by the World Food Program (WFP) and to 
prepare for further investments in sustainable food security. All food rations have now been distributed by 
WFP; 120,000 students in 397 primary schools and pre-schools benefited from two meals daily in 2008 
and 2009. Work has recently commenced to advance the second and third components of the grant, 
namely to support activities to increase agricultural production and productivity in targeted zones through 
two field-based NGOs, and to undertake key agricultural studies that will monitor food security, nutrition 
and vulnerability, develop a livestock census methodology, and identify environmentally and socially 
friendly agricultural practices. These studies will inform the new Emergency Agro-Pastoral Recovery 
Project, which is under accelerated preparation in FY11 thanks to the granting of an exceptional IDA 15 
allocation of US$20 million. 

16. 
Good progress has been made in improving the access and quality of education and health 
services but capacity-related challenges remain (Outcome 8). The Education For All-Fast Track 
Initiative Catalytic Fund (US$37.8 million) has supported the Government to finance the first phase of its 
National Education Strategy and to meet its respective MDG goals by 2020. Gross primary enrollment 

6 

 
 
now stands at 84 percent, surpassing the target of 77.4 percent. The number of textbooks to be distributed 
has doubled and the pupil to textbook ratio of 1 to 1 is expected to be met by 2011. In health, the 
HIV/AIDS project has recently been extended in order to allow for the distribution of equipment to clinics 
and the distribution of the 250,000 bed nets. To date 100,000 have been distributed (from a zero baseline).  
A Health Sector Status Review (FY11) is being launched to provide the appropriate analytical 
underpinnings for the forthcoming IDA funded intervention in FY12.  

17. 
Concerted efforts have been undertaken to support the CPS’ four cross cutting themes.  
 
State and Peacebuilding: The World Bank and the AfDB are also supporting the consolidation of 
peace through development efforts at the community level. These include the IDA-funded Support to 
Vulnerable Groups Community Development Project and TDRP- financed Community Recovery Project 
in the north of the country. The Bank is closely collaborating with the United Nations system, which is 
supporting the Inclusive Political Dialogue and security sector reform. 
 
Environment and climate change: Work to date includes: (i) a Country Environmental 
Assessment, (ii) a medium-term flood reduction and mitigation program and (iii) a Readiness Preparation 
Proposal, including a national REDD (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation) 
strategy that will enable CAR to participate in the GEF-supported REDD Project for the Congo Basin.  
 
Capacity development: Support has been provided to strengthen the implementation of lending 
operations. Examples include analytical work aimed at improving national procurement systems, 
implementing EITI, strengthening flood recovery and improving sustainable urban management.  
 
Gender: Several studies are underway to support the Government to update its national gender 
strategy; including a gender profile, supported by the AfDB, and a UNDP- supported national strategy to 
promote female entrepreneurs. The thematic analysis that is being undertaken as part of the PRSP 2 
process will guide the Bank’s support to future interventions on gender equity and economic 
empowerment.  

4 CPS RELEVANCE, IMPLEMENTATION AND ADJUSTMENTS  

A. 
CPS relevance 
18. 
The country’s reform agenda that is supported by the CPS program remains relevant, 
and will contribute to the country’s development goals. The baseline PRSP (PRSP 1), on which the 
CPS was prepared, is built upon four pillars: (1) security, peace and conflict prevention; (2) good 
governance and the rule of law; (3) economic reconstruction and diversification; and (4) human 
development. While the reform agenda remains unchanged, PRSP 2 is expected to be directed towards 
more growth - enhancing structural reforms to address the new challenges emerging from the global 
slowdown. The four pillars are likely to be consolidated into two principal themes that also reflect the 
foundation and pillars of the Africa Strategy, namely: (i) consolidation of peace and security, governance, 
rule of law and human rights (ii) and inclusive growth and human development. Rural development is at 
the core of the PRSP 2 strategy. The Government plans to focus on alleviating extreme poverty, including 
food security, by identifying solutions with rapid results and that will translate into more sustainable 
growth within the agricultural communities.  The monitoring and evaluation process, including the 
management information system, will also be improved, based upon a more participatory approach and 
with greater focus on the MDG targets and indicators. 

19. 
The overall objectives as set out in the CPS remain valid and relevant. The CPS’ two 
strategic themes remain priority areas for the Government of CAR: (i) to consolidate economic 
governance and institutional capacity to ensure an effective management of the country’s resources and 
create an enabling environment for private sector development; and (ii) to rehabilitate and develop 
infrastructure to sustain economic growth and improve basic service delivery and the living conditions of 
the population. In keeping with the Africa Strategy’s primary instrument of partnership, selectivity led the 

7 

 
 
World Bank and the AfDB to commit to sustain and deepen their support to areas where the Banks had 
comparative advantage, including public finance management, transparency and accountability in natural 
resource management, strengthened economic infrastructure, and human resource development.  

20. 
CAR is still seeking support in the priority areas as set out in the CPS. The Government 
continues to signal its full agreement with the areas of support provided by the World Bank and it is 
expected that PRSP 2 will reconfirm the relevance of the existing priority areas of Bank intervention. 
Consolidation of efforts around the government’s reform agenda will be critical for CAR’s economic and 
social development. This agenda includes plans to increase priority spending in MDG-related sectors 
including health, education, water and sanitation, agriculture and rural development, social protection, 
and infrastructure. Emphasis will be placed on priority investment projects, removing key bottlenecks on 
the budget execution chain, enhancing government capacity to implement investments, and improving 
spending efficiency by strengthening the public financial management system and improving governance. 

21. 
The CPS’ lending and knowledge instruments have proven to be appropriate given the 
need to respond quickly to CAR’s emerging development challenges. The CPS chose a blend of 
instruments that focus on achieving tangible results from rapidly disbursing interventions, complemented 
by robust knowledge products to strengthen public policy dialogue and to build capacity. As previously 
indicated, 100 percent of the IDA-funded priority sector investment loans were processed as emergency 
operations in order to provide just-in-time support to emerging needs. DPOs have been critical in 
allowing the GoCAR to sustain critical public expenditures during the global crisis. The IDA and CRW-
financed operations have helped to provide the fiscal space to maintain the public expenditure program. 
Knowledge products have been important to strengthen public policy dialogue and to build capacity, and 
efforts are underway to consolidate the sector based analytical and advisory studies.  For example, a PER 
is being prepared to advise the authorities on how to improve the growth and poverty impact of 
government expenditures. Its recommendations will draw upon analytical work recently undertaken 
including the draft Water Supply and Sanitation Sector PER report, analysis of public financial 
management carried out by the IMF, and the forthcoming Health Sector Assessment.    

22. 
Thanks to creative leveraging of the national IDA allocation, regional IDA, trust funds, 
and exceptional IDA allocations--another theme of the Africa Strategy--the financial envelope 
available to CPS implementation has been adequate to date. Resources available to CAR may 
stagnate for the remainder of the CPS period, as significant alternative sources of financing beyond the 
country’s IDA 16 allocation are not evident at this time. The team will, however, continue to selectively 
seek out trust fund resources that complement ongoing or planned activities, including SPF funding to 
maintain the Bank’s critical support to public finance management, and TFESSD to complement the new 
community recovery program in the north of the country.  

B. 
Implementation and adjustments  
23. 
CPS delivery is on track, and in many cases is progressing quicker than anticipated. As 
Tables 1 and 2 demonstrate, program delivery has largely proceeded as planned, with new lending 
deliverables totaling US$210 million during the CPS period. Planned Analytic and Advisory Activities 
are advancing well, with all activities having either been delivered or under preparation. As described 
above, these activities are beginning to yield tangible results both in the policy sphere and on the ground. 

24. 
Portfolio performance is strong. Despite capacity constraints within the public administration, 
the Bank’s engagement with the government has been robust. There is a strong commitment to 
development. This translates into an impressive degree of political will to move the reform agenda 
forward at the policy level, and to ensure progress that yields tangible results at the project level. It is 
therefore not surprising that CAR’s average annual disbursement rate has stood at over 30 percent during 

8 

 
 
the CPS period. While there are three projects that are at risk, there are none in problem status. In general, 
the government’s teams responsible for project implementation have been proactive in both identifying 
implementation bottlenecks and solving them in a timely manner.  

25. 
Going forward, the CPS will maintain its overall objectives, but will continue to respond 
flexibly to CAR’s emerging needs. The overall objectives as set out in the CPS remain valid and 
relevant. The Government also continues to signal its full agreement with the areas of support provided 
by the World Bank.  Nevertheless, as the PRSP 2 is finalized, the CPS will continue to maintain a flexible 
approach with respect to its strategic direction, including, as specified in the second pillar of the Africa 
Strategy (“vulnerability and resilience”), the ability to respond to shocks. The Bank’s focus during the 
remainder of the CPS will be on: i) the selective roll out of new lending in agriculture and health, ii) 
implementation and quality of portfolio performance, iii) and expanding support beyond Bangui to more 
remote areas of the country.   

26. 
The Fiscal Year 2011 work program deliverables are broadly on track, though there have 
been some slippages into FY12. Preparation of the proposed US$24.0 million Emergency Agro-Pastoral 
Recovery Project was advanced to FY11 thanks to a US$20 million exceptional IDA allocation. The 
project will increase production and marketing of selected food crops and livestock products. It represents 
an important shift in project design in CAR, wherein the proposed project offers a medium- to long-term 
framework for strengthening food production and marketing on a sustainable basis, as opposed to 
providing just-in-time emergency support. Phase 1 (B) of the Central Africa Backbone Project is under 
preparation and will likely be delivered in FY11.The Health Sector Assessment has slipped to FY12 in 
order to allow for the completion of the Multiple Cluster Survey (MICS-4) report in May 2011. The 
review will document key dimensions of the sector, focusing on service delivery, finance and impact on 
the health status of the nation, in order to identify challenges and opportunities for policy dialogue and the 
new lending in FY12. The PER, the flagship AAA, has also been pushed to FY12 in order to allow 
additional time for the task team to undertake analysis that will underpin the report.

27. 
Fiscal Year 2012 will focus on the delivery of an important new health project, which will 
support the implementation of the Government’s National Health Plan (2010-2014). The operation will 
aim at increasing utilization and improving the quality of basic health services with a particular focus on 
child and maternal health. The project will support the Ministry of Health to implement a performance 
based financing system to deliver health services to under-served areas. This operation will be in the 

9 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
range of US$15 to US$20 million, depending on the final IDA 16 allocation to CAR, and the extent of 
frontloading desired by the Government that will be based on the menu of proposed activities.  

28. 
The IFC will be scaling up its SME development operations and other Advisory Services 
activities, funded mainly through IFC’s Conflict Affected States in Africa (CASA) Program (US$ 25 
million for the four CASA countries). In addition, IFC’s SME Ventures Program will be providing risk 
capital finance to SMEs (US$ 2.5 million) and strengthening SME management skills (Business Edge 
training Program).  In November 2009, IFC also received government support to issue a medium-to-long 
term CFA Franc bond in the CEMAC countries.  The proceeds from the bond issuance will be invested in 
projects in the CEMAC region.  IFC's objective is to establish its credit in the market through this 
issuance of the bond and follow this up with Structured Finance Transactions that will allow it to 
efficiently mobilize local currency financing for the private sector in collaboration with local financial 
institutions (i.e., ECOBANK in CAR).  MIGA also remains open in CAR, offering its political risk 
product for investors who are keen to invest in the country, but who remain apprehensive because of 
political risks or governance issues. 

29. 
Where possible, the CPS will try to grow support beyond Bangui. Poverty incidence in 
CAR varies substantially across regions, with the lowest concentration in Bangui, and the highest 
incidences in the most remote, rural areas of the country. Bank support is evolving, and is shifting its 
emphasis to these underserved, albeit difficult to access, areas. The ongoing Support to Vulnerable 
Groups Community Development Project, the recently launched Community Recovery Project and 
planned new investments in agriculture and health signal this geographic reorientation of Bank-supported 
activities in the field. While responding to the country’s most chronic needs related to development, this 
transition also presents challenges to implementation and related Bank support.  

30. 
The portfolio quality will be important to monitor during the remainder of the CPS 
period. As explained earlier, the current portfolio is performing well. On the client side, strong leadership 
and a commitment to development at all levels have led to impressive results under challenging 
circumstances. Bank task teams have been proactive in supporting the government to identify and 
overcome implementation obstacles, including capacity constraints, limited data availability, and 
unexpected cost overruns due to a lack of competition. This joint effort to ensuring development results 
will be critical to sustain for the remainder of the CPS period, particularly given the large increase in 
commitments over the past two fiscal years.  

31. 
The revised CPS results framework (Annex 1) reflects minor changes to reflect 
adjustments in the lending and analytical work programs. Changes to the outcome indicators, as 
summarized in Annex 2, reflect revised project targets in relation to the Emergency Power Response 
Project (Outcome 5), and updated indicators in relation to the water and sanitation components of the 
Emergency Urban Infrastructure Project (Outcome 6). 

5 RISKS 

32. 
The risks highlighted in the FY2009-2012 CPS remain valid. The following section updates 
certain key risks (political, security, macroeconomic), and identifies two new risks (food security and 
portfolio management) that relate to the remainder of the CPS period.  

33. 
Political risk. After three postponements, presidential elections were conducted on January 23rd 
2011. Following the successful re-election of the incumbent president, a new government was  formed 
and officially recognized on April 22nd 2011. The new Government will be tasked with addressing the 

10 

 
challenges associated with peace and security that are essential for political stability and to build upon 
that which has been developed during the first years following the transition. While support to the 
political process and associated transition are outside of the mandate of the World Bank, collaboration is 
underway with the Peace Building Commission to ensure that peace building reforms and investments are 
sufficiently addressed in the PRSP 2 and the upcoming Round Table.  

34. 
Security risk. As outlined in paragraph 5, the Government continues to face insecurity in 
outlying areas, with ongoing rebel attacks in the North-East and South-East. While the election outcome 
may lead to a reduction in security risks on Bangui, the slow implementation of the DDR process 
continues to undermine the consolidation of peace. The President is currently overseeing a second 
campaign to advance the process, including the setting-up of local DDR committees and the distribution 
of food allowances, financed through the national budget. While the DDR program is implemented by the 
government and UNDP, the Bank and AfDB will continue to focus their efforts on community recovery 
in the north to help foster peace building at the local level and mitigate some of the security risk.  

35. 
Macroeconomic risk. CAR continues to remain vulnerable to shocks. While preliminary 
estimates show a recovery in 2010 with real GDP growth of 3.3 percent, a prolonged impact of the global 
economic crisis on exports could lead to slower growth, lower revenue, and deterioration in debt 
indicators. Critical resources available to CAR may also stagnate from donors for the remainder of the 
CPS period, due to concerns relating to the uncertain political situation. Moreover, inadequate progress 
relating to domestic revenue mobilization could cause delays in private sector investment projects that are 
needed to boost CAR’s economy and create jobs. Mitigating factors are CAR’s recent track record in 
macroeconomic management, which has been strong in response to exogenous shocks. The Government’s 
focus on growth enhancing structural reforms as part of its poverty reduction strategy, and support 
provided by the Bank and other donors on this, should help build macroeconomic resilience in the face of 
any new exogenous shocks. 

36. 
Food Security risk. About 30 percent of the population of CAR is currently food insecure, and 
even small internal and external shocks can cause many more to face hunger. Productivity gains for 
small-holder farmers will become critical to any mitigation strategy for this. These productivity gains are 
within reach for the majority of Central African farmers, but strategic investments are needed to make this 
happen. The new Emergency Agro-Pastoral Recovery Project and the associated Emergency Food 
Response Project will provide critical mitigation support through focused efforts to sustainably increase 
production.  

37. 
Portfolio management risk. Supervision of a relatively young and significantly larger 
portfolio (currently at US$230 million in commitments) presents significant challenges. As the portfolio 
expands its geographic scope, supervision remains costly and difficult given the insecurity. Most TTLs 
are not based in the country office, and there are limited flights into the country (there is only one flight 
per week from Europe). Further efforts will be made to decentralize key staff to the country office, 
including TTLs, fiduciary and safeguards staff, and additional resources will be made for implementation 
support. The new Fragile States hub in Nairobi is also expected to provide a complement of expert 
support to the country team and office.
