EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
i.  
Bosnia and Herzegovina (BH) has accomplished a great deal since the 1995 Dayton Peace 
Accords helped bring an end to the worst bloodshed on European soil since World War II.  Most 
important, BH citizens and authorities have restored peace.  Despite intense political debate and lingering 
ethnic division, there is no popular will for a return to violence.  BH is a European Union (EU) potential 
candidate country and moving, though fitfully, toward alignment with EU acquis requirements.  The 
authorities have also established a solid record of economic management.  Between 1998 and 2008, per 
capita GDP nearly quadrupled and poverty dropped from nearly 20 to about 14 percent.  Perhaps most 
impressive, a decade and a half after the end of fighting, BH’s citizens have managed these achievements 
within a decentralized and highly complex political and institutional structure which frustrates decision 
making. 
ii.  
Critical development challenges remain.  First, the country is embarking on a new growth 
model dependent on exports in a period of slow growth and escalating financial volatility in Europe, 
while at the same time its neighbors are undertaking similar strategies.  BH has to become more 
competitive.  This will require upgrading in physical infrastructure, business environment and human 
capital.  It will also require greater coherence in the country’s highly decentralized administrative system 
to create a real “single economic space” within BH.  Second, more needs to be done to complete the 
reform of the mostly “rights based” social benefit policy which diverts assistance from the truly poor and 
weakens the efficiency of the labor market.  Third, BH is rich in natural resources and one of the most 
biologically diverse countries in Europe; but its natural resources need to be used sustainably.  As 
throughout South East Europe, climate change threatens not only BH’s natural beauty but key sources of 
growth, such as agriculture, forestry and hydropower.   
iii.  
Addressing these challenges will require overcoming the current political stalemate which is 
undermining coordination in key sectors and threatens the reform process.  A government coalition 
at the State (i.e. central) level has still not yet been agreed, nearly a year from the October 2010national 
elections.  Still, the Bank Team confirmed during extensive engagement with each Entity and at the State 
level that the authorities at all levels of government agree on the above challenges, and on proposed 
solutions. Moreover, for the past three years the State and Entity governments have been pursuing a 
jointly authored development strategy centered on macroeconomic stability and economic growth, 
employment and social cohesion, and sustainable development.  Explicit in each of these pillars is the 
overarching goal of EU accession, which is identified as the strategy’s guiding principle. 
The Bank Group’s objective during the FY12-15 CPS is to support BH through knowledge 
services and targeted financing, coordination with European financial institutions, and an 
expanding partnership with the EU, including EU co-financing of the Bank financed operations. 
 • Competitiveness:  Interventions in the early years of the CPS would include continuation of a 
Development Policy Operation (DPO) series to support macroeconomic stability, including public 
expenditure reform, and investments in irrigation, land registration, and regional transport, and 
through stimulating SMEs access to capital. In addition, IFC will continue to provide support through 
its advisory services in the areas of regulatory reform and regulatory simplification as well as 
investment policy work. 
• Social Inclusion: The existing portfolio will continue to support improvement in living standards, 
including expanding access to primary health care through family medicine, as well as to basic public 
services; and on-going and new interventions, including, a DPO series, which will help reform the 
social assistance program to target benefits to the truly poor and strengthen pensions.  
• Environmental Sustainability: BH is vulnerable to climate change.  The Bank is supporting projects 
to help ensure the sustainable use of natural resources, such as water and forestry, with which BH is 
extravagantly endowed, and to prepare for growing risk of floods and droughts. 
i 

iv.  

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
v.  
World Bank Group support will be guided by four principles of engagement. 
 • Selectivity: Limited financing and budget will place a premium on the strategic allocation of Bank 
resources.  The CPS will see a major consolidation of the portfolio, which will free up resources for 
timely analytical products. Nevertheless, with fewer Bank-financed projects under implementation, 
staff will be able to meet the growing demand to implement externally (mostly EU) co-financed 
operations. 
• Flexibility: A number of projects postponed from the previous CPS will absorb the bulk of new 
financing in the first years of the new CPS.  The selection of interventions for the outer years will be 
determined at an early CPS progress review as reform priorities for the newly elected authorities 
evolve, and depending upon performance of the ongoing programs and availability of funds. 
• Results: Notwithstanding a challenging environment in BH, the Bank Group is delivering significant 
results, with an efficiently disbursing portfolio meeting clear development objectives.  This CPS has 
been developed to consolidate and build on these results. 
• Partnership: Virtually all assistance will be designed to support BH’s EU accession; and the Bank 
will continue to expand innovative partnerships with the EU and European financial institutions 
active in the Western Balkans to leverage external support and integrate programs.  
vi.  
The CPS is consistent with the Bank Group’s regional strategy for Europe and Central Asia 
(ECA).  The Strategic Pillars of the ECA Strategy are: (i) Deepened Reforms for Improved 
Competitiveness; (ii) Social Sector Reforms for Inclusive Growth; and (iii) Climate Action for 
Sustainable Growth.  This is appropriate as the challenges for ECA as a whole are similar for those in BH.  
The drivers of pre-crisis economic growth are unlikely to return quickly.  Fiscal pressures and an increase 
in poverty have underscored the importance of efficient social spending.  And while climate threats vary 
throughout the ECA region, BH, and southeast Europe in general, is highly vulnerable to climate change. 
vii. World Bank financing will remain constrained.  IDA credits are expected to amount to 
roughly US$148 million, including IDA regional resources, and be allocated to five or six investment 
operations.  Trust funds—particularly those financed by the EU—will complement and expand the scope 
of the WBG’s operations. 
viii. 
IBRD financing during the CPS will focus on policy reform.  At present, IBRD resources 
would be limited to policy lending to leverage reforms initiated under the previous CPS.  The current 
indicative plan, assuming an appropriate governance and macroeconomic policy framework, is to prepare 
the second in the DPO series (US$100 million), which would aim at consolidating reforms in BH’s social 
benefits system and advance reforms in public wages and pensions.  Board presentation of this operation 
is tentatively planned for later in FY12.  Additional IBRD lending to support the third DPO will depend 
on satisfactory country performance, demands from other IBRD borrowers, and IBRD's lending capacity. 
ix.  
IFC expects to increase financing to the private sector to a level of US$80-$100 million.  
Financing will support competitiveness and sustainable development, with planned activities—direct 
financing and advisory services—in the financial sector, agribusiness and the energy sector.  IFC also 
plans advisory services to promote PPPs in infrastructure services and support improvements in the 
country’s business environment.   
x. 
The CPS is subject to two principal risks.  The first is continued political fragmentation; this 
would undermine crucial economic reforms, slow progress toward EU accession and disrupt the Bank’s 
programmatic DPO series.  Second, prolonged volatility and slow growth in the eurozone could stall 
BH’s recovery and weaken efforts 
to 
implement Bank supported activities and undermine 
competitiveness.

A. 

Political Context  

I.  COUNTRY CONTEXT 

1. 
BH has established a solid record of economic and social achievement.  This record has come 
notwithstanding the extraordinarily complex institutional and political system defined under the 1995 
Dayton Accords.  Major accomplishments include more than 15 years of peace and stability; the 
resilience of democratic processes; a heroic reconstruction effort, the transition from a socialist to a 
market based economy; solid economic growth; improved living standards; progress on MDGs; and a 
substantial drop in poverty. 

2. 
However, the country is confronting fundamental questions of whether its highly complex 
political system is adequate to confront emerging development challenges, including EU accession.  
After its successful reconstruction, BH remains stuck in a political, ethnic stalemate.  The constitutional 
framework on which the country was created—the Dayton Accords—ended the conflict by locking post-
war BH into two Entity governments—the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (FBH), made up 
predominantly of Bosniaks (mostly Muslims) and a minority of ethnic Croats (mostly Roman Catholics), 
and the Republika Srpska (RS), populated predominantly by ethnic Serbs (mostly Orthodox Christians).  
It also includes a central—or “State” level—administration headed by a rotating presidency, but with few 
enumerated powers.    This framework has allowed each Entity to undertake important measures 
sometimes in parallel, but generally independently.  The continued effectiveness of the model is coming 
into question.  In its November 2010 Progress Report on BH’s political and economic criteria for EU 
membership, the European Commission (EC) noted that BH’s institutional structure is inefficient, with 
rules that “complicate decision-making, delay reforms and reduce the country’s capacity to make progress 
towards the EU”. 1   

3. 
BH remains under a form of international supervision exercised by the High Representative 
(HR)/EU Special Representative (EUSR), supported by the Office of the High Representative 
(OHR).  The HR/EUSR has been exercising extensive legislative and executive powers (known as ‘Bonn 
powers’) in overseeing the implementation of the Dayton Accords.  Despite broad agreement within the 
international community to transition from OHR to a EUSR-based model, progress towards meeting the 
criteria for this transition has been limited.  The unclear timing of the transition adds additional 
uncertainty to the governance environment in BH.  At the same time, the security situation on the ground 
has remained stable.   

4. 
Political tensions are bringing constitutional issues to the fore.  The key factor is the failure of 
the main political representatives to reach consensus on how political authority and even administrative 
competencies should be arranged to ensure continued progress towards the EU and to create conditions 
for the country’s sustainable economic development.  Bosniak leaders generally favor a stronger central 
government, while representatives from the RS in general resist any accretion of State power, and argue 
that Dayton confers authority to the Entities.  Leaders of Croat majority parties are concerned about their 
level of autonomy, since they share the FBH with the Bosniak majority.  While Dayton envisioned a 
process of negotiation between the Entities toward agreement on additional responsibilities for the State 
level, constitutional negotiations have not yielded major breakthroughs, and the positions of the main 
parties are not converging.  As the 2010 EC Progress Report notes, efforts at constitutional reform have 
produced “no tangible results”. 2

5. 
The costs of the protracted and deepening inefficiencies are increasing.  First, while the 
respective governments have coordinated to draft a development strategy3, BH still lacks coherent 
country-wide sectoral policies in such strategic areas as energy, agriculture, education and transportation.  
The implications of this are significant, not just in deterring foreign investment, but for its effect on 
slowing progress toward EU accession, which remains a key stated objective of both Entities and popular 
with the general public. After signing the Stabilization and Association Agreement (SAA) with the EU in 
2008, BH’s path to EU accession has stalled.  The latest EC Progress Report noted that “a shared vision 
of the direction to be taken by the country remains necessary for smoothly operating institutions, for 
creating more functional and efficient State structures and for speaking with one voice on EU and 
international matters”4. The stakes are clear.  BH risks falling behind its neighbors on the path to EU 
membership. 

6. 
Fragmented governance also has implications for Bank support.  Given BH’s decentralized 
governance structure, most Bank lending is implemented at the Entity level.  In the past, funds were 
allocated by the State to the Entities based on a formula combining GDP, population, and war damage. 
During the previous CPS, the Bank and the authorities moved toward an allocation system based on 
demand and capacity to implement specific projects.  In addition, the Bank has adhered to a principle that 
its financing would not undermine the development of a single economic space within BH nor progress 
toward EU accession. The possibility of allocating funds to the entities based on implementation 
performance was also explored, but the environment in BH has not allowed for progress in this area. 

Recent Developments  

7. 
The political situation is at a stalemate.  The October 2010 elections were in many ways a 
promising moment for BH.  The 56 percent voter participation was the highest on record.  An entire 
generation with little or no memory of the war cast their first ballots.  And civil society played a major 
role in not only turning out the vote but in shifting the campaign to at least some degree away from the 
ethnic politics which has dominated BH in the past.  Almost a year later, however, a State level 
government coalition has yet to be formed.  The RS formed its government in January 2011.  The FBH 
formed a government in March 2011 after the electoral victory of a coalition lead by the Social 
Democratic Party.  But the continued impasse within the FBH among political parties claiming to 
represent ethnic Croats threatens to deepen ethnic politics and delays an agreement at the State level.  In 
September 2011 talks among all the relevant parties continue toward formation of a government coalition 
at State level, but have yet to yield results. 

B.  
Economic Context 
8. 
BH is an open economy with good export potential and a GDP per capita of approximately 
BAM 6,500 (US$4,500) in 2010.  Some 65 percent of value added is created in service sectors (retail 
trade, public administration and financial services, etc.) while the remaining 35 percent is split between 
manufacturing, 25 percent (industry, construction and energy production); and agriculture 10 percent.  
During the five years leading up to 2008, exports climbed more than threefold.  The chief exports are base 
metals (aluminum, iron and steel at 18 percent of total exports); mineral fuels, oils and products (10 

(Sejdic-Finci vs. BH case) that found the provisions that prevent citizens who do not identify themselves as 
belonging to the three constituent peoples from standing as candidates for the Presidency and the House of Peoples 
of the Parliamentary Assembly incompatible with the general principles of the European Convention for the 
Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms 
3 Both entities and state level teams have contributed to the strategy but it remains to date a Working Paper.

percent); machinery and mechanical appliances (9 percent); furniture (8 percent) and other wood products 
(7 percent).  In 2010, BH exported roughly €3.5 billion, with its neighboring former Yugoslav 
republics—Serbia, Croatia and Slovenia and Montenegro—accounting for 40 percent of total exports; and 
Germany, Italy and Austria an additional 35 percent. 

Performance before the late-2000s global financial and economic crisis 

9. 
BH’s pre-crisis growth model, like many transition economies in ECA, relied on foreign 
financing of booming domestic consumption.  Sustained economic growth was driven mainly by 
increases in productivity that relied on private-capital inflows.  The reverse side of this coin meant that 
the transition countries had persistent current-account deficits of the balance of payments, i.e. the excess 
of domestic spending over the country’s total income.  In the period from 2004-2008, BH’s GDP growth 
averaged 5.5 percent, while current account deficits (CAD) averaged 12.5 percent of GDP annually. 

10. 
Some notable progress on structural reform helped BH’s pre-crisis growth performance. 
The completion of privatizations in the metal and wood-processing industries played an important role in 
the growth of exports.  The signing of the SAA further liberalized trade with the EU, paved the way for 
more EU funds and provided a clear road map for reform.  Corporate and personal income taxes were 
lowered and harmonized across the Entities.  Entity Governments took concrete steps to settle domestic 
claims stemming from the 1992-1995 war in order to improve fiscal sustainability. 

11. 
A blend of foreign direct investment (FDI), 
grants and foreign credit financed the CAD. FDI 
averaged 7 percent of GDP per year, covering an average of 
about 44 percent of the CAD between 2004 and 2008, and 
rising capital account transfers covered another 24 percent 
during the same period.  Debt-creating inflows were largely 
channeled through international banks incorporated in BH.  
During this time the authorities built foreign exchange 
reserves which peaked in 2008 at 6.8 billion KM or 5.5 
months of imports.  

Before

After

12. 
Commercial bank credit to both households and firms was instrumental in supporting 
growth throughout this period. The privatization of commercial banks in BH led to a transfer of 
ownership to foreign banks5 with ready access to cheap financing from their parents abroad.  During the 
5-year period prior to the onset of the global economic crisis, commercial bank credit to the private sector 
increased from 37 percent of GDP to 58 percent.  Credit to households increased from 23 to 27 percent of 
GDP between 2004 and 2008.  The quality of banking assets remained strong and non-performing loans 
amounted to less than 3 percent prior to the onset of the economic crisis. 

13. 
Given the complex political structure and incomplete and stalled privatization process, the 
public sector plays a very significant role in the economy.  During the reconstruction period (1996-
2002) public spending hovered around 50 percent of GDP.  Consequently, public employment still 
represents some 18 percent of official employment in the country, even after some reductions in public 
expenditure.  Furthermore, provision of public administration, education and health care services accounts 
for 20 percent of value added in GDP. 

5 90 percent of bank equity and 95 percent of bank assets are BH is foreign owned.

(Percent)

14. 
After a period of improvement between 2004 and 2006, public fiscal management 
deteriorated sharply in 2007-2008 and growing public 
expenditure contributed to the widening CAD.  The share of 
public spending in GDP fell to around 43 percent between 2004 
and 2006 and years of fiscal deficits were turned into surpluses. 
However, following the successful introduction of indirect 
taxation in 2006 and the associated revenue windfall, fiscal 
performance deteriorated 
in 2007 and 2008 as public 
expenditure increased substantially, magnifying the impact of 
the rapid private demand growth on the CAD.  Overall, in the 
lead up to the crisis, public expenditure grew faster than GDP, 
with spending on public sector wages and social benefits leading 
the way.  This resulted in widening current account deficits and 
a spike in inflation.  In 2008, the current account deficit peaked 
at 14 percent of GDP or €1.8 billion.

Impact of the crisis 

15. 
The global economic and financial crisis was transmitted to BH in three ways.  First, the 
slowdown in the EU triggered a collapse in the demand for BH’s exports—some 55 percent of BH 
exports go to EU markets; and nearly all go to countries largely dependent on EU growth.  Second, the 
crisis severely curtailed cross-border financial inflows and the pre-crisis credit boom came to a sudden 
stop.  The rapid credit growth – in excess of 20 percent annually – came to halt and has not returned 
since.  The banking system came under strain, as the spate of negative news about foreign banks with 
subsidiaries in BH triggered a mini-deposit run in late 2008. However, no banks failed as a result of the 
crisis.  Third, the remittances from the diaspora working and living abroad slowed.  In other words, the 
growth model enjoyed during the 2000s largely disappeared. 

16. 
Declines in GDP (2009 real GDP contracted by 
2.9 percent (which represents an almost 9 percentage 
point drop in the GDP growth rate compared to 2008) 
and the associated drop in revenues exacerbated fiscal 
outcomes. Because of expansionary fiscal policies in 2007 
and 2008, the deficit reached 3.5 percent of GDP in 2008 
despite strong revenue growth.  The budget deficit increased 
to 5.6 percent in 2009, as the country entered a recession.

After

17. 
Confronted with 
this 
situation, 
the BH 
authorities recognized that even with a strong adjustment in fiscal policy, continued extraordinary 
financing would be needed to meet the remaining fiscal gap and boost foreign exchange reserves.  
They approached the IMF, the World Bank and the EU for assistance with external financing.  The 
Government has since taken emergency measures to reduce public expenditures and concluded a Stand-
by Arrangement (SBA) with the IMF amounting to US$1.52 billion, which was approved by the IMF 
board in July 2009.  The bulk of the measures in this program pertain to the reduction of the fiscal deficit 
through both short-term cuts and structural reforms, but the authorities also committed to strengthening 
financial sector oversight and reconfirmed their commitment to maintain the Currency Board.

Social Development Context 

18. 
The 2008 economic and financial crisis halted solid poverty reduction, and it is too early to 
determine the lasting impact.  The 2009 Poverty Update showed that positive sustained GDP growth 
over 2004-2007 had been associated with a reduction in the poverty rate from 18 percent to 14 percent6 —
strong progress toward meeting the 2015 MDG target of 9 percent.  The reversal of GDP growth in 2008 
is likely to have eroded some of these achievements.  Despite the lack of recent data, evidence suggests a 
significant slowdown of poverty reduction in BH.  The most recent available poverty data is the 2007 
Household Budget Survey.  While a full assessment of recent poverty trends will have to wait for a new 
HBS currently in the field (first findings are expected in June 2012), available evidence points in the 
direction of a significant impact of the recent contraction on the lower income groups.  Indeed, one survey 
found7 that more than 60 per cent of households reported to have been seriously affected by the crisis.  
This compares with an ECA average of about 50 percent. 

19. 
The crisis is having substantial effect on living standards.  The crisis halted nascent job 
creation in BH, leaving the country with an unemployment rate in 2010 of 27 percent8.  Reduced 
remittances flows are reported by more than 50 percent of the population, and reduced wages by almost 
40 percent of total. These labor market trends put significant strain on household welfare.  A quarter of 
the population (30% in rural areas) reported having reduced the consumption of staple foods such as milk, 
fruits, vegetables or bread, and 10 percent of the population had to delay payment of utilities (3% had 
utilities cut due to non-payment).  Almost 10 percent of the population report having had to delay medical 
visits when sick, and 4 percent of the population report having to stop buying necessary medicines.  
Those changes were undertaken after items more easily dispensed with had been eliminated. 

II. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS, OUTLOOK AND RISKS 

20. 
Following a sharp slowdown in 2009, the BH economy is estimated to have returned to 
growth of 0.8 percent in 2010, with the recovery gaining momentum toward the end of the year.  
The rebound was modest because growth in private consumption was constrained by the legacy of the 
recession in 2009, including increased unemployment, and by the measures taken to rein in the budget 
deficit, such as cuts in public-sector wages and social welfare benefits.  Private investment growth was 
also close to zero.9 The contribution to growth was due, in part, to the recovery in external demand. 

21. 
The current account deficit (CAD) adjusted quickly following the onset of the crisis  and 
was cut in half to 6.2 percent of GDP in 2009, and continues to edge lower in 2010 (estimated 5.6 
percent of GDP).  For 2010, BH recorded a marked improvement in the trade balance as the trade deficit 
contracted by 4.5 percent year on year in local currency terms.  Exports soared by 18.9 percent year on 
year, albeit from a low base, with the rise reflecting both a growth in the volume of foreign sales and the 
impact of higher international prices for some of BH’s main exports, such as base metals and electricity. 

6 Estimates use absolute poverty, i.e., percentage of population living below the poverty line defined as the 
consumption level of 205 BAM per person per month. 
7 The 2010 BH-LITS-II survey which was fielded to update our understanding of the socio-economic trends in BH 
in the absence of other recent nationally representative household survey.  
8  This is the unemployment rate as measured by the annual Labor Force Survey (May 2010) with unemployment 
rate differing between men (25.6 percent) and women (29.9 percent). Unemployment rate was the highest among 
the youth (ages 15 to 24) at 57.5 percent (55.1 percent for young men and 61.3 percent for young women). 
Administrative data show unemployment reaching 43.3 percent at the end-2010.  
9 There are no data on private investment, but nominal growth of long-term credit to the private sector of 1.9 
percent, indicates very small or non-existent private investment growth.  

5 

 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                            
Imports rebounded more modestly, by 9.1 percent year on year, as a result of depressed import demand, 
because of weak economic growth and stagnating levels of domestic consumption.  Rising international 
oil and other commodity prices accounted for the growth in imports, a key vulnerability of BH economy. 
The full-year trade deficit shrank to KM6.5 billion from KM6.8 billion in 2009. 

22. 
Although the measures taken in the context of the SBA have increased confidence in the 
financial system, restoring credit to the private sector has been more challenging.  Household 
deposits have been flowing back into the banking system, and in December 2010 reached a level that is 
24 percent above the low point of two years earlier.  While the banking sector remained stable throughout 
the downturn, banks have seen nonperforming loans rise, and their profitability has dropped which has 
curtailed lending.  In 2010, credit to the private sector grew by a mere 1.9 percent.  The need to maintain 
adequate provisioning and to rebuild capital cushions will likely continue to hold back credit growth. 

23. 
The budget deficit was brought down in 2010 to 4.3 percent of GDP.  The measures 
implemented in the context of the IMF program were critical to deficit reduction in 2010.  In addition, by 
adopting the necessary legislation as a part of the prior actions for the first in the series of three Public 
Expenditure DPOs, the Entities have also taken the first step toward a fundamental reform of the system 
of veteran and civilian cash-transfer benefits. Given the delay in formation of governments following the 
October 2010 general Elections, however, the progress on implementation of these reforms have been 
slow. 

24. 
There have been some recent adverse developments on the fiscal front.  Due to the lack of 
agreement between Entities as well as between the Entities and State on a Global Fiscal Framework for 
2011 (a key requirement under the SBA) and consequent allocation of the indirect tax revenues from the 
single revenue account, the IMF has not been able to complete the fourth review. The combined second 
and third review of the SBA was discussed by the IMF Board in October 2010.  The fourth review was to 
have taken place in early spring 2011, but was delayed.  The disagreements over the Global Fiscal 
Framework and over the sharing of revenues have led to budget plans for 2011 that might not be entirely 
consistent with the SBA deficit targets. 
Outlook over the CPS period 

25. 
Future economic developments depend critically on the willingness and ability of the 
authorities to: i) form a viable State-level coalition following the elections and ii) make appropriate 
policy decisions.  In both Entities efforts to contain fiscal deficits need to be focused on the expenditure 
side instead of the revenue/financing side.  This will require steps to contain the public sector wage bill 
and cash transfer programs.  The remainder of this section and path of macro indicators presented in 
Table 1 are consistent with the IMF program.  They assume the authorities are able to take these steps, 
that there is an agreement on the fiscal framework, and that the IMF SBA remains on track. 

26. 
Under the baseline scenario, the recovery in growth will primarily be export-led, based on 
import demand recovery in the Western Balkans and the EU, although investment and 
consumption growth is also expected to pick up gradually.  The projected rates of growth (see Table 1 
below) reflect a recovery of main export sectors based largely on the prospects for import demand growth 
in the EU and the region. After a strong recovery in 2010, BH export growth is projected to moderate 
from a high of 18.9 percent in 2010 to 11.0 and 5.7 percent 2011 and 2012 respectively.

The current account is expected to continue to adjust gradually over the forecast period 
with the concurrent strengthening of the financial account.  In the near term the CAD will widen on 
the back of higher global food prices (BH is a net food importer).  However, going forward, the CAD will 
continue to narrow driven by dampened domestic demand that will remain below pre-crisis levels and by 
the recovery of global prices for BH’s main commodity exports, mineral fuels, oils and products, metals, 
and wood products.  Remittances will continue to be a major part of the foreign financing as the economic 
recovery takes firmer hold in the US and the EU. Official remittances are expected to stabilize at 12 
percent of GDP.  Foreign Direct Investment is forecast to make a gradual recovery (from 0.1 % of GDP in 
2010 to 3.7 % in 2015) with the resumption of the stalled privatization process and further improvements 
in the business environment. Both bank and private sector foreign borrowing are set to recover from post-
crisis lows as investment and consumption recover in the second-half of the forecast period. 

28. 
Inflation is forecast to remain low on the back of lower than pre-crisis domestic demand. 
However, given that BH is a net food and oil importer, external price shocks could have a significant 
impact on the overall domestic price level as was the case in 2008 when average inflation reached 7.4 
percent.  This is evident once more in May 2011 as the inflation reached 4.2 percent (year on year) as the 
external price shock from increases in global food prices towards the end-2010 was transmitted to BH.

29. 
Fiscal adjustment is the key to this macro scenario and is expected to continue gradually 
over the medium term: from a deficit of 4.3 percent in 2010 to balance in 2015. Revenues are 
projected to remain broadly the same as a share of GDP over the forecast period (around 46.3 percent of 
GDP), while fiscal consolidation, planned structural reforms of social and veterans’ benefits under the 
DPO series, and containment of the public wage bill are expected to generate savings on the expenditure 
side (from 50.1 percent of GDP in 2010 to 46.3 percent in 2015). This adjustment is expected to take 
place in an orderly manner with IMF, WB and EU budget support.  

Debt Sustainability 

30. 
Notwithstanding the need to secure additional external financing as outlined above, the 
macroeconomic framework presented ensures a sustainable debt level over the medium term, 
although some vulnerability to shocks remains.  Largely as a result of the increase in public sector 
borrowing (during the crisis and in the post-crisis fiscal consolidation period), external debt (both public 
and private) is expected to grow from 49 percent in 2008 to 57 percent in 2012, but to fall thereafter. 
External public debt would grow from 17 percent in 2008 to 26 percent in 2011, while total public debt 
would grow from 31 percent in 2008 to 39 percent in 2011 and fall thereafter. The debt appears 
sustainable under the base-case scenario of the IMF debt sustainability analysis embedded in the overall 
macroeconomic framework which assumes sustained fiscal consolidation through the implementation of 
the planned reforms.  The scenario would be vulnerable to (unlikely) currency depreciation, a non-interest 
CAD shock, an unexpected slowdown in GDP growth and inadequate fiscal consolidation.  In particular, 
a depreciation of 30 percent would imply an increase in the debt level to around 85 percent of GDP. 

31. 
As mentioned, the medium-term macroeconomic framework is not yet fully defined and 
there are clear and substantial risks associated with this macroeconomic scenario. External 
economic developments and the pace of economic recovery in key export markets is both uncertain and 
beyond the control of the authorities.  Political tension and lack of viable state-level coalitions following 
the October 2010 General Elections bring clear risks for implementation of reforms including fiscal 
measures that are needed and may even have to be further adjusted over time.  The Fiscal Council needs 
to come to agreement on the fiscal framework, after which the financing arrangements involving the IMF, 
EC and the World Bank can fall into place.  If this is done in a manner that includes the reform measures 
that are envisaged under both the SBA and DPO series, BH debt will remain sustainable. 

III. BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA’S DEVELOPMENT CHALLENGES 

32. 
This CPS builds on an analysis of BH’s key development challenges.  To support its EU 
aspirations and to continue to improve the quality of people’s lives, BH will need to address three critical 
and interrelated development challenges:  (i) sustain growth through improved competitiveness; (ii) 
reform public finances and institutions to improve service delivery and make growth more inclusive; and 
(iii) achieve the sustainable use of the natural resources, including by adapting to climate change.  Lack of 
progress in tackling weakness in governance may undermine any progress on these challenges. 

A.  

 Sustain Growth and Improve Competitiveness 

33. 
The most pressing challenge is to restore sustainable economic growth under dramatically 
changed international conditions.  The economy will need to be more competitive and attractive to 
foreign financing, particularly investment.  This fundamentally means to shift from a model based on 
domestic consumption to one reliant on investment and exports.  From one led by the public sector to one 
where the private sector is the main engine of growth.  And from one based on financing from foreign 

8 

 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
banking sources to one financed more by FDIs and domestic savings10.  However, the highly supportive 
international environment prevalent until 2008 is not likely to materialize in the near future.  The drivers 
of the current modest rebound in economic growth are at best uncertain, if not temporary.  Thus the 
foundations for sustained growth over the medium and long-term are still to be laid. 

Business Environment and Private Sector Development 

34. 
Regulatory quality has improved in recent years, but at a slower pace than in neighboring 
countries.  This has resulted in a relative deterioration of the country’s international competitiveness. 
Indeed, many aspects of the regulatory environment have stagnated in the past three years.  According to 
the 2011 Doing Business report, BH continues to fare poorly in terms of starting a business (160th place 
out of 183 economies); dealing with construction permits (139th place); paying taxes (123rd place); and 
enforcing contracts through the courts (104th place).  The country has made some progress in speeding up 
some of these processes (notably property registration ranking improved from 141st place in 2010 to 
103rd in 2011).  A subnational Doing Business 2011 Report found that construction permits and business 
registration procedure was significantly simplified in Banja Luka and Sarajevo. Banja Luka was one of 
top reformers in the region where the time necessary to register a business was reduced from 51 to 21 
days.  Nevertheless, other countries, including BH’s neighbors, have improved their business 
environment at a faster pace.  According to some indicators, the overall burden the “red tape” places on 
business remains a problem.  The most recent Business Environment and Enterprise Performance Survey 
(BEEPS) indicates that the ‘time tax’ (i.e. share of senior managers’ time spent dealing with public 
officials) increased during 2005-2008 from 5 to 13 percent.  

35. 
In the corporate sector, a key priority for the country is to further reduce the role of the 
state, including through the privatization of important companies particularly in the metals and 
telecommunications sectors.  The sale of publicly owned stakes in companies is expected to resume in 
2011-12, particularly in the FBH, but the Entities still lack a clear and transparent privatization strategy.  
Also, many companies privatized in the past by a voucher system have poor corporate governance and 
need to be either restructured or entered into bankruptcy.  One important consequence of the SAA is the 
reduction or abolition of customs duties on a wide range of imports from the EU.  This is already well 
under way, and will continue to increase competition for many local producers. 

36. 
The authorities have taken important steps to strengthen corporate sector accounting. The 
State and Entity Level Ministers of Finance approved the BH Accounting and Auditing ROSC, which 
was disseminated in Sarajevo in June 2011.  The report contains policy recommendations designed to 
guide the authorities in the further development of the corporate financial reporting system towards the 
requirements in this area for eventual EU membership. The Vienna based CFRR is now working with the 
stakeholders in financial reporting reform to develop a proposed project for potential EU funding to 
support implementation of the ROSC recommendations. 

Governance, Rule of Law and Public Sector Management 

37. 
Political stability and government effectiveness remain the weakest dimensions of 
governance in BH. These weaknesses are closely related to the country’s complex institutional 
architecture and the political dissonances between the Entities, which have repeatedly led to impasses in 
decision-making, have blocked major policy and institutional reforms and have hindered decision-making 
by the national Fiscal Council.  EU accession remains the entry point for governance reform.

38. 
The rule of law has been strengthened, but BH’s courts are slow by sub-regional standards.  
Public trust in the judicial system has improved modestly and is higher than in neighboring countries, as 
shown by surveys of firms and the general public.   However, firms report dissatisfaction with the slow 
judicial process.  According to the 2011 Doing Business report, it takes some 19.5 months to enforce an 
outstanding claim through the court. The latest progress report from the EC states that “the development 
of an independent and effective judiciary in line with European standards remains at an early stage. 
Significant efforts are needed to ensure implementation of the justice sector reform strategy.  The 
fragmented legal framework across the country and the absence of a single budget restrict effectiveness. 
The backlog of cases and political pressure on the judicial system continue to be cause for concern.”11 

39. 
Citizen satisfaction with public services has improved significantly in recent years, but petty 
corruption in public services remains a concern, according to the 2010 Life in Transition Survey.  
On the other hand, the reported frequency of unofficial payments appears to have increased somewhat, 
particularly in the public healthcare system.  According to the 2010 Global Corruption Barometer survey 
conducted by Transparency International, 23 percent of respondents from BH reported paying a bribe in 
the past 12 months (compared to 5% in Croatia; 16% in Kosovo; 17% in Serbia; and 21% in FYR 
Macedonia), placing BH in the group of countries with medium levels of petty corruption. 

40. While BH has undertaken important efforts to increase accountability in government, 
corruption remains a serious problem.  The 2010 EC progress reports notes that BH “has started to 
tackle corruption by adopting an updated anticorruption strategy, and by appointing an acting director 
who is overseeing the implementation and the establishment of the anti-corruption agency.  However, 
corruption remains prevalent in many areas and a serious problem throughout the public and private 
sectors. Anti-corruption policies and measures are not adequately implemented. ”12   Still, the effects on 
firms have declined.  The most recent round of the BEEPS (2008) showed that reported bribe frequency 
had declined significantly since 2005 and was lower than in the ECA and South European averages, 
though it remained above EU 10 levels.  The reported incidence of unofficial payments is highest in 
applying for construction permits (14 percent of firms said such payments were frequent), in obtaining an 
electricity connection (13%), and applying for import licenses (9%).  

41. 
The 2010 SIGMA report13 states that "the Public Procurement Law adopted in 2004 
generally complies with the main principles of the EU public procurement system, although several 
discrepancies remain”.  The implementation of the Public Procurement Law (PPL) needs improvement 
and the central public procurement institutions (Public Procurement Agency and Procurement Review 
Body) are not sufficiently pro-active in disseminating information on the public procurement system and 
in providing contracting authorities (and economic operators) with practical assistance. 
 The 
administrative capacity of contracting authorities and the professional ability of procurement officers to 
properly implement the system remain unsatisfactory.  BH’s business community perceives the public 
procurement practices as frequently unprofessional, prone to corruption and political pressure.  However, 
there has been no significant change in the legislative framework of public procurement, and there has 
been no significant progress in the area of public procurement since the PPL was adopted in 2004.

development (OECD), principally financed by the EU.

42. 
In most areas of public financial management (PFM) progress was made, though 
opportunities remain for further strengthening.  Some priorities brought to the attention of the Bank 
include: knowledge exchange and training on performance auditing for supreme audit bodies; unique 
macroeconomic forecasting tools, particularly for public revenues; improvement in centralized wage 
payment systems; internal audit of program-based activity; capital investment management in the cantons; 
implementation of IPSAS accounting standards; drafting and implementation of the fiscal responsibility 
law.  Weaknesses have been identified in the operation of PFM where targeted technical assistance could 
help. In particular, support for improving the functioning of the global financial framework, improving 
the quality and consistency of financial information and strengthening cross government systems and 
standards offer opportunities to engage in priority areas that could make a significant impact. There would 
also be benefit from efforts to improve financial management, governance and oversight in state owned 
enterprises and concessions building on the findings of the Bank’s 2007 review. 

Transport Infrastructure 
43. 
BH’s Development Strategy recognizes the importance of stepped-up transport capacity.  It 
notes as a top priority: “achieving and increasing mobility of goods and people, and contributing to 
overall sustainable social and economic development.” 14 The country has therefore committed to an 
ambitious agenda of upgrading transport capacity and to meeting EU Transport policy standards. In 2010, 
the Bank produced a Transport Sector Review15 to enhance dialogue inside BH toward the development 
of a national transport policy, and focused on the following areas. 
 Roads: About half of BH’s road network is in good condition.  A large portion of the network 
has been rehabilitated since the end of the war, mainly through external financing, leading to a 
significant improvement of road conditions.  Nonetheless, the emergency nature of the 
interventions led to the use of rudimentary techniques, mainly patches and overlays. This is 
particularly true in rural areas—about one million BH citizens cannot reach other parts of their 
village or town via a paved road.  The institutional structure in the sector is complex and costly. 
There are too many institutions in BH, with separate arrangements for motorways in both entities.  
Another major issue is road safety, with road traffic accidents costing BH 1.5 to 2 percent of 
GDP, representing the second largest cause of death and injury.  The recent adoption of the 2009-
2013 Road Transport Safety Strategy and the RS Law on Road Transport Safety by the RS 
National assembly is a step in the right direction. 
 Rail: Rail can be an important part of BH’s transport system.  Indeed, both passenger and freight 
traffic had been growing, and projections prior to the 2008 crisis pointed to a doubling of freight 
traffic by 2015.  But tracks need to be overhauled, and tunnels and bridges rehabilitated.  Sector 
management is, again, highly decentralized, with a rail company in each Entity; a state-level rail 
corporation was established in 1998, but it has few concrete responsibilities and limited budget 
and staffing.  By contrast, both Entity railway companies are overstaffed. 
Inland Waterways:  BH’s extensive networks of waterways provide an efficient and sustainable 
mode of transporting goods and people within and outside the country.  Before the war, for 
example, the Sava River, running through Slovenia, Croatia, BH and Serbia, played a critical role 
in the region’s transport network.  Total freight carried on the river in 1990 amounted to 5.2 
million tons; by 2008, volumes had dropped to 400,000 tons.  The Bank is currently preparing the 
Sava River Navigability project to increase navigability of River Sava and provide an alternative 
transport corridor linking BH with neighboring Croatia and Serbia.  This regional operation is 
prepared and financed in cooperation with the EC.

Energy 

44. 
The energy sector is characterized by high energy intensity, high carbon emission intensity, 
and significant potential for improving energy efficiency.  BH’s power sector is not only able to meet 
domestic demand in full but also to export substantial electricity to the regional market.  Of about 4,000 
MW installed capacity, one third is hydro and the remaining is thermal.  BH has significant reserves of 
coal, but its mines are inefficient, and, partly due to the decline in demand, coal production is no more 
than half of the production levels in the 1990s.  Almost all oil is imported and about 80 percent is used by 
the transport sector.  For natural gas, used primarily for heating, BH depends on only one supplier, 
making it vulnerable during winter to supply disruptions.  The District Heating utilities supply about 12 
percent of household demand while the remaining is met through electricity, wood biomass, and gas.

45. 
The three power generation and distribution utilities are generally well performing, both 
operationally and financially.  Recent measures have also helped bring the transmission network into 
compliance with its obligations under the Energy Community Treaty.  Challenges remain, however: 
 
Invest in new power facilities.  Over the next eight years, BH needs to invest about €6 billion for 
rehabilitation and construction of new power plants, which will require private sector financing. 
Improve energy efficiency.  Buildings are poorly insulated and savings could exceed 30 percent.   
A “no-regret” action would be to start with energy efficiency in public buildings.  Saved energy 
through end-use efficiency would become available for export. 
 Develop renewable resources.   Exploit the substantial hydro potential as well as wind power by 
adopting appropriate policies, feed-in-tariffs and incentive mechanisms, and take advantage of 
potential revenue from the sale of carbon emission reductions.  However, BH has not yet 
established a Designated National Authority, depriving it of potential carbon revenues.  
 Resolve long-standing dispute about the structure and management of the transmission 
company (Elektroprenos). This will be crucial to attracting significant private investment. 
Introduce climate change mitigation and adaptation measures.  BH is vulnerable to climate 
change. 
 Priority mitigation measures include: energy efficiency, reduction of losses, 
development of water infrastructure, and adaptation measures to improve dam safety.  

 

Agriculture 

46. 
Although its share in the economy is small, the agriculture sector absorbs much of the 
economically active population.  The share of agriculture in the economy decreased from 15.1 percent in 
1999 to 9.8 percent in 2007.  The 2010 Labor Force Survey estimates that the agriculture sector accounts 
for 19.7 percent of employment in BH, compared to 49 percent in the services sector, and 31 percent in 
the industry16. Most of agriculture sector employment is in the informal economy; and subsistence 
agriculture still plays an important role as a social buffer. 

47. 
Fragmented arable land, and poorly defined property rights undermine the development of 
rural markets.  Farms in BH are generally small and fragmented.  Indeed, the average farm size in BH 
today is smaller than it was in Southern Europe in the 1970s.  Smaller farms have greater difficulty 
generating enough production to be commercially viable, to integrate with value chains, or earn enough to 
invest in modern production methods.  Land consolidation is undermined by the poor track record in 
privatizing state owned farms and uncertainties regarding land ownership.

48. 
BH needs to better exploit the considerable potential of the sector, including by taking full 
advantage of the preferred access to European markets.  Agricultural products are increasingly 
valuable due to high international food prices.  Moreover, BH has potential comparative advantages due 
to relatively low costs of land and labor and a strategic location for producing high value products for 
domestic and EU markets.  The authorities have also improved the legal and institutional framework in 
the fields of food safety and veterinary and phytosanitary services, but more needs to be done. 

49. 
High quality rural infrastructure is needed to link producers and processors to domestic 
and foreign markets. Substandard rural infrastructure, including irrigation and drainage, and roads 
constrains development of the agriculture sector.  For example, although BH is a water-rich country, 
insufficient water supply in 2005 resulted in higher losses for agri-food businesses in BH than any 
country in ECA.  And BH, like the rest of South East Europe, needs to plan for climate related challenges. 

Creating Jobs, Skills and Labor Tax Wedge 

50. 
One of the striking features of the BH labor market is how few people are looking for jobs.  
The activity rate—the percentage of the eligible working population looking for work—is 44 percent; this 
is well below the rates of other countries in the region.  The social and psychological impact of the war is 
clear; many people cite post-conflict trauma as the reason for not looking for work.  Additional factors 
include the perceived difficulty in finding work, access to remittances, and the generous cash benefits 
system.  For those looking for work, 87 percent of the unemployed have been jobless for longer than 12 
months.  Here too the effects of the war endure, as more than one-quarter of the registered unemployed 
are demobilized soldiers, members of families of deceased soldiers and persons with war related 
disabilities.  At the same time, and perhaps most worrying, is the high level of youth unemployment—
some 47 percent of 15-24 year olds are jobless.  This number, combined with one of the lowest tertiary 
enrollment rates in ECA, means that large numbers of young people are neither working nor studying.  
This constitutes a significant threat to BH’s long term competitiveness.  

51. 
The data suggest a lack of skills to meet the challenges of a globalized economy.  Higher 
education is being rewarded in BH.  Between 2008 and 2010 the economy actually created jobs for those 
with tertiary education.  This is notable as the sharp decline in unemployed tertiary graduates during 
2006-2008 coincided with an increase in their numbers—in other words, even though more tertiary 
graduates were looking for work, a larger percentage found jobs.  Evidently, however, more graduates are 
needed.  A 2009 survey of firms found that 83 percent of respondents answered they have unfilled need 
for qualified workers.  The reason most firms cite for being unable to fill open positions are skills related 
(soft skills in particular), and not related to wages, labor mobility or flexibility in hiring.  And skills 
deficiencies are most acute in larger firms and those that export. 

52. 
There are significant gender implications as well.  The female labor force tends to be better 
educated than that for males.  In the FBH, for example, where jobs held by women are more skill 
intensive than those held by men, the shedding of jobs at the low end of the skills distribution and the 
creation of jobs at the top means that now there are 20 percent more women with tertiary education 
employed than those with primary education or less. 

53. 
In order to sustain international competitiveness within the Currency Board Arrangement, 
the Authorities face the challenge of reducing the relatively high social contributions rates, but have 
difficulty finding the fiscal space to do so given past surges in the cost of wages and transfers.  
Collection of social contributions has been streamlined and transferred to a single collection point in the 
Entities’ tax authorities.  This aids with tax compliance and fights evasion (i.e. an employer cannot pay 
one tax without paying all social contribution taxes).  However, social contribution rates are much higher 

13 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
than all other taxes in BH and higher when compared to other countries.  For all social contributions 
combined, the rate in the FBH amounts to 41.5 percent of gross salary.  This is higher than in the RS (33 
percent) or the OECD average (29.5 percent) or EU-8 average (38.1 percent).  The Consumption tax 
(VAT) in BH is 17 percent while both corporate and personal income tax rates are at 10 percent.  The 
authorities have been trying to reduce social contribution rates in recent years, and managed to reduce the 
contribution rate for unemployment from 2.5 to 1.5 percent.  However, in the face of increasing current 
expenditures on transfers and the wage bill, there has been no fiscal space for a more serious reduction. 

54. 
One of the consequences of high social contribution rates is a large informal sector in BH. 
The difference between two different measures of unemployment (officially registered unemployed i.e. 
“administrative unemployment” vs. employed as measured by a Labor Force Survey using ILO standards) 
demonstrates the scale of informal unemployment.  Currently, administrative data show an unemployment 
rate of 41 percent while data from the LFS indicate unemployment of 27 percent.  As currently designed, 
incentives are tilted in favor of informality. An employer has an incentive not to register an employee in 
order to save on high social contribution rates, and employees are willing to agree to such an arrangement 
as they can register as unemployed in order to claim a free health insurance benefit. Consequently, the 
rate of “registered” unemployment is significantly higher than that which is measured by Labor Force 
Survey. The ratio of those who work in the formal sector and pay social contributions to those who are 
entitled to healthcare is around 1:5.  A system of health insurance that is entirely financed by social 
contributions, with a large grey economy, is not only unfair, but it also undermines firm competitiveness 
and creates disincentives to formality. 

55. 
Government engagement in active labor market policies is scant and fragmented.  The key 
institutions responsible for labor markets are the Entity and Canton level Employment Funds, with 
budgets financed by employer contributions.  However, these resources are used largely for right based 
cash transfers, which do little to generate employment.  In 2008, for example, the FBH spent 17 times 
more on these cash transfers, mainly to unemployed demobilized soldiers, than on active labor market 
measures.  In the RS, the ratio was 2 to 1 in favor of cash transfers.  Not surprisingly, few job seekers and 
fewer employers use the Entity job-brokerage services. 

B.  

Improve Public Service Delivery and Make Growth More Inclusive 

56. 
Despite a massive reconstruction effort, insufficient local infrastructure and service delivery 
have left many people without access to basic services.  More than one-third of BH citizens have no 
access to running water or waste removal.  Less than a fifth of the rural population is connected to public 
sewerage systems, and one in five rural households rely on latrines or outhouses.  In many areas, 
insufficient trash disposal poses health and environmental threats.  Every year the country generates two 
to three million tons of solid waste, but only two-thirds of households have regular waste removal 
services.  As a result, people burn or dump their waste illegally, polluting land, roadsides, and rivers.    

57. 
Progress is underway at the local level.  Both Entities have adopted Local Government laws 
that clarify functional assignments to municipalities and their revenue sources.  Of particular importance 
was the introduction of a VAT, further revisions to the Indirect Taxation Authority (ITA), and reforms in 
municipal borrowing, which have institutionalized a more stable and autonomous source of revenues for 
municipalities.  The key outstanding challenge is establishing accountability.  Higher level governments 
can work with municipalities to establish minimum service standards—and estimate the fiscal resources 
required to meet them.  Civil society can play a more active role; some municipalities have established 
public hearings, feedback lines and ombudsmen to facilitate input on concerns and ideas.  And 
development partners can promote systematic benchmarking of service delivery and PFM performance.  

14 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
58. 
Political incentives are also improving.  Public services will only improve when users are able 
to send clear signals to those responsible for providing them, and providers see an incentive to respond.  
This has been particularly elusive in BH as ethnic politics have tended to overwhelm other issues.  The 
growth in the number of jurisdiction-based mayors is one source of optimism, as candidates—and their 
political parties—needing votes outside of their ethnic base will be more inclined to campaign on 
effective service delivery.  NGOs and civil society are also well placed to advocate for municipal 
performance.  The emergence of statutory bodies called local communities, established by Local Self 
Governance Laws to liaise between citizens and government bodies are an increasingly effective 
mechanism for signaling user satisfaction.  This in turn is encouraging newly organized citizens groups as 
points of leverage to monitor and comment on municipal public service provision. 
Box 1: Gender Disparities in BH:  Lessons for Bank Support – Land Registration 

There is a widespread perception that gender disparities are less relevant in the ECA region than elsewhere 
because of the region’s socialist legacy.  Looking at a broad range of gender outcomes shows that though 
gender disparities are not as glaring in ECA as elsewhere in the world, gender equality has not yet been 
achieved.  BH is no exception.  Despite a relatively higher enrollment of girls than boys in secondary school, 
overall women are less likely to participate in the labor market (participation is 80 percent of men).  Those 
who are active in the labor market are much more likely than their male counterparts to be unemployed.  Those 
with jobs are often in low quality jobs (11 percent of women compared to almost no men are in unpaid 
employment).  Still in BH as elsewhere the performance of women is very heterogeneous.  In the public sector, 
for example, which in BH typically provides better paid and more secure jobs than the private sector, women 
are just as likely as men to work.  And gaps in labor market indicators for women with tertiary education are 
much smaller than for the rest, suggesting that the present “positive gaps” in enrollment could lead to much 
better results for younger cohorts of women.  But a note of caution in interpreting these finding is needed.  
Consider for example the case of land.  Recent analysis as part of the Bank’s support for a land registration 
project shows that while women’s legal rights are protected (i.e. there are formal institutions supportive of 
gender equality), tradition frequently favors male inheritance of property so that women waive their 
inheritance rights in favor of their brothers (i.e. informal institutions militate against effectively implementing 
the laws).  Therefore, designing projects and reforms that work and that support gender equality requires 
awareness and conscious efforts to identify the barriers that might prevent women’s participation.  Gender 
reviews of other elements of the portfolio are now going to be undertaken regularly as part of the new Regional 
Programmatic Gender Monitoring activity, which has been introduced for the new CPS period. 
As for the specifics of the land registration project review, a follow-on land registration project would support 
a communications campaign to raise public awareness of women’s’ legal rights, IT systems which collect and 
monitor disaggregated data by gender, and the broad involvement of civil society to carry out gender 
assessments to gain a deeper understanding of true impediments to women’s property rights in BH. 

Education 

59. 
The Dayton Accords defines complex governance arrangements for the education sector.  
The state has no authority in educational matters handled at the entity level.  Decentralization is even 
more pronounced in the FBH.  Each of the ten cantons is responsible for all matters in the education 
sector, and there is little coordination among them.   This highly decentralized system, especially in the 
FBH, has resulted in inequitable—and increasingly inefficient—spending on education.  This has been 
exacerbated by a sharply declining school age population in the past decade, which has resulted in small 
class sizes and low student teacher ratios, leaving too many resources for secondary and primary schools 
but too little for upper secondary and tertiary education. 

60. 
Inefficiencies in BH’s education system have undermined competitiveness, but progress is 
underway.  The State and Entity governments are working toward establishing a national standardized 
15 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
student assessment system; and from 2007-2010, BH participated in the Trends in International 
Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS)17.  At the tertiary level, BH in 2007 adopted the Framework 
Law on Higher Education, which provides the legal basis for the establishment of two new state level 
institutions for coordination and support to higher education development and a legal foundation for 
integrating autonomous faculties.  The law also confirms BH’s commitment to the Bologna objectives, 
which include moving toward EU standards. 

61. 
BH must also ensure schools are not exacerbating social tensions.  Another major challenge, 
and one with long terms implications for the country, is how the country manages educating BH’s diverse 
population.  Recent years have seen a worrying trend toward ethnic segregation in the delivery of the 
curriculum.  For example, in the FBH, with its “Two Schools Under One Roof” arrangement in some 
communities, ethnic Croat and Bosniak children attend classes in the same building but are physically 
separated from each other, entering the building through separate doors, taking classes with separate 
curricula at different times of the day or in separate parts of the school.  

Health Sector  

62. 
Health outcomes in BH generally lag behind other countries in the region.  Child and infant 
mortality have declined, but the rates continue to be about twice that of new EU member states.18  BH, 
like many countries in the region, also suffers from high rates of mortality and morbidity stemming from 
non-communicable diseases (NCDs) related significantly to lifestyle choices, such as tobacco and alcohol 
use.  However, the health system, which has retained its focus on specialist curative services (not primary 
health care), is not fully addressing these challenges.  

63. 
Health expenditures are growing at an unsustainable rate and burdening both public and 
household budgets.  Health spending in BH has grown from 6.9 percent of GDP in 2000 to an estimated 
10.3 percent in 2008.  About 60 percent of these expenditures are paid for publicly, and public health 
expenditures over this period have grown from 6.4 to 14 percent of general government expenditures.  
The other portion (41.8%) is financed by households through out-of-pocket payments. Health 
expenditures have an impoverishing effect on a sizeable number of households in BH. The public budget 
for health is almost entirely financed by the social health insurance contributions collected from 
employers and the salaries of employees.  Because of the small proportion of the population formally 
employed, the social health insurance tax rates of 16.5 percent in the FBH and 12.5 percent in the RS 
remain quite high.  The high tax rates on labor are themselves barriers to the creation of more formal 
sector jobs with benefits.     

64. 
The BH health system remains highly fragmented, resulting in inequity, inefficiency and 
weak governance.   Dayton stipulated that the entities should be responsible for health regulation, 
organization, financing and service delivery. In the FBH, the responsibility for health services has been 
further delegated to the cantons, so the FBH health sector includes the FBH Ministry of Health (MoH), 
the 10 cantonal MoHs, the FBH Solidarity Health Insurance Fund (HIF), the 10 cantonal HIFs, and 11 
Institutes of Public Health (IPH). The RS health system is centralized at the entity level, with a single HIF 
(HIFRS), MoH, and IPH.  Brcko also has a Department of Health and a separate HIF.  The FBH spends 
nearly twice the per capita expenditure as the RS with only little differences in benefits offered.  Within 
the FBH, the variation is starker ranging from 608 KM per capita in Sarajevo to between 356 and 227 KM 

17 While the test is offered at the 4th and 8th grade, BH students took it only at 8th grade level. 
18 Child (age under 5) mortality is estimated (2008) to be about 15 children per 1000 live births and infant (age 0-1) 
mortality is estimated to be about 13 children per 1000 live births.  The comparable figures for new EU member 
states are 7.9 and 6.6 respectively.    

16 

 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                            
per capita in the other cantons.  The FBH’s health sector remains weakly governed, not having the tools to 
sufficiently regulate the minimum health system requirements for the cantons, monitor performance and 
reduce the duplication of administration.  While in the case of RS fragmentation is not a critical obstacle, 
there is still significant space for improving coordination and management within and among health 
facilities and the use of information to adjust the service delivery models, to improve the public health 
programs and to upgrade their performance evaluation system. 

65. 
The authorities are implementing strategies to introduce the service delivery model of 
family medicine in order to improve the quality of primary care.  Changing how primary health care 
is financed, however, has not yet significantly changed although there have been attempts to move 
towards a system of capitation.  Authorities of both entities are considering options for improving 
contracting, including use of an international patient classification system for measuring the performance 
of hospitals.  Some other policy directions of the two entities have differed.  The RS has in recent years 
been developing and implementing standards of hospital safety.  The FBH is developing means of 
coordination, such as developing a standardized hospital contracting form and methodology. 

Social Benefits 

66. 
BH spends more on social safety nets than nearly every country in the ECA region.  At 3.3 
percent of GDP, BH outlays on non-contributory social protection cash transfers is more than twice the 
ECA average of 1.6 percent and considerably more than the OECD average of 2.5 percent.  This level of 
spending is fiscally unsustainable, economically inefficient, and socially inequitable.  A key problem is 
the large preponderance of benefits targeted to war veterans and their families on a “rights-based” policy.  
This results in poor targeting and little if any impact on poverty.  Less than 40 percent of the overall 
social assistance budget is targeted to the poorest 20 percent of the population (among the lowest in ECA) 
– and over 16 percent of the benefits are captured by the richest fifth of the population.  Moreover, the 
cash transfers are “passive”—they do not require positive behavioral changes, and are not linked to social 
care services.  In general, they do not provide incentives for transitioning from social assistance to 
employment; on the contrary, they provide a perverse incentive for long-term benefit dependency. 

Pensions 

67. 
BH shares a number of pension system challenges in common with other transition 
economies.  Both entities are affected by aging populations, with longer-lived elderly receiving benefits, 
while low fertility rates and emigration cause the labor force and contribution revenue to shrink.  And 
both are plagued by the problem, common in transition countries, where the beneficiaries receiving 
pensions today are those who were of working age during the socialist period when the majority of 
individuals worked in the formal sector and contributed to, and thus earned rights to, the pension system; 
while the proportion of working age individuals contributing today is considerably lower.  As a result, 
pension expenditures are high while contribution revenue is relatively lower, resulting in a potential 
deficit in the pension system.  Moreover, as in other transition countries, both entities suffer from 
significant levels of early retirement, which has swelled the number of beneficiaries.  In addition, given 
the war history in BH, both entities have higher percentages of disabled and widows and orphans 
receiving benefits, resulting in even more people who are below the retirement age receiving pensions. 

68. 
Additional problems have also evolved as similar constraints have been implemented 
differently in the two entities.  Just after the war, to prevent arrears from accumulating in the pension 
system, a cap was imposed on the pension system limiting benefits in any year to revenues available in 
that year.  Caps were subsequently legally adopted by the two entities and they remain in place to this 

17 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
day.  However, they were implemented differently in the two entities and they have resulted in distortions 
which are particularly strong in the FBH pension system. 

Box 2: Bank Support to Politically Sensitive Reform of Social Benefits: DPO Series 

BH’s unsustainable and regressive system of social benefits has been a key obstacle to improving fiscal performance 
and competitiveness and social equity for many years.  Prior attempts by the Bank to help the authorities reform the 
system were not successful.  Well organized opposition and a surge in revenues after the introduction of the VAT in 
2006 led to abrupt policy reversals.  The 2008 global economic and financial crisis, and the fiscal pressures that 
resulted from it in BH, led the authorities to turn again to the Bank for assistance.  The Bank responded, and in April 
2010 the Board approved the first in what was to be a programmatic series of public expenditure DPOs.  The first 
operation amounted to US$111 million—in a combination of IDA and IBRD resources—and supported Government 
action to fix the long-standing and politically sensitive problem.  

In addition to hard learned lessons from previous unsuccessful attempts at reform, the DPO was based on continued 
policy dialogue underpinned by extensive analytical work, including programmatic poverty assessments, a Public 
Expenditure and Institutional Revue (PEIR), and work on pensions.  And it is being accompanied by a US$15 IDA 
credit to strengthen institutional capacity necessary for implementation of the social protection reforms. 

As part of DPO1, the Governments of FBH and RS took important steps towards rationalizing existing cash transfer 
programs.  First and foremost, they adopted framework laws on Targeting of Cash Benefits to initiate a shift from 
the predominantly rights-based approach to a needs-focused approach in social assistance. The Framework Laws 
strengthen fiscal responsibility by introducing mandatory needs-based targeting that takes into account the actual 
material needs of the applicant or beneficiary.  Key reforms also include assessing the fiscal impact of any new 
commitments, indexing benefits to inflation rather than wages, and improving governance and accountability 
through establishment of beneficiary registries. 

Both Entities have taken steps to establish income tests and other measures—but actual reductions in benefits have 
yet to be implemented.  Reluctance to confront organized opposition ahead of the October 2010 elections, and the 
delay forming new governments that has followed, have slowed progress.   

The Bank and elected authorities plan to follow this with a second DPO in FY12, depending on accelerated 
implementation of policies introduced under DPO1 and the overall macroeconomic framework.  Key actions include 
(i) developing updated tools to improve targeting of benefits to those who are socially and economically vulnerable; 
(ii) improving the cost-efficiency of benefit administration through better institutional management, with the 
ultimate objective of establishing a unified registry.  The second DPO in the series will likely address reforms in 
public sector wage and employment policies and in pension administration. 

C.  

Sustainable Use of Natural Resources and Climate Change 

69. 
BH needs to develop a country-wide strategy to protect its natural riches.  BH’s natural 
treasures—including magnificent forests and abundant bodies of water (“Bosnia” from the ancient word 
Bosana, meaning “water”)—are also critical sources of economic growth, and at risk.  In April 2009 the 
EC presented a framework for adaptation measures and policies to reduce the EU’s vulnerability to 
climate change.  The proposed measures focus on developing supportive institutions for sectors to 
successfully adapt to climate change.  Any forward‐looking planning or growth strategy must take into 
account consequence of global climate change.   

18 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
70. 
The dominant challenge for BH related to Climate Change today is adaptation to already 
on-going changes and the impacts this is likely to pose on the BH economy and livelihoods.19 BH, 
and South East Europe more generally, is vulnerable to climate change in four critical areas. 
 Energy: BH’s reliance on hydropower for electricity generation (30–40%) has implications for 
energy security. The country could experience reduced hydropower generation exacerbated by 
increased urbanization and cooling demand.  Dam integrity and reservoir management could also 
be affected by flooding.  Flash flooding could temporarily impact power supply.  Even non-hydro 
generating facilities could be affected by water availability and/or  restrictions linked to cooling 
water.  Overall this could lead to higher energy prices and less reliable supply. 
 Agriculture: Irrigated small holder farms may be hard hit by droughts and heat waves. Climate 
change is expected to threaten its competitiveness. Projections show that the main maize-growing 
regions in the north of BH could suffer yield declines of 10 to 25 percent.  In the south, where 
fruit and vegetable crops are more common, the projections indicate that, without adequate 
irrigation, crops could suffer even more. 
 Water:  BH is well endowed with water resources though the southern part (Herzegovina) has 
low precipitation and the northern plains along the Sava and Drina face structural drainage and 
flood management challenges   Flash-floods are occurring across the region.  All main rivers are 
shared with neighboring states.  Water and rivers are a high-value resource as they are essential 
for economic growth and jobs in agriculture, hydropower generation, fish culture, and ecosystems 
sustainability (tourism).  BH faces major challenges, notably: (i) the country needs to develop its 
institutional and regulatory frameworks that are compliant with the EU Water Framework and 
Floods Directives, and develop integrated river basin management plans to facilitate cross-
sectoral planning and cooperation–building on the experience with the on-going Neretva-
Trebisnjica Management Project; (ii) much of the water infrastructure needs to be rehabilitated or 
modernized after two decades of maintenance backlog; and (iii) climate change will induce 
different patterns of rainfall and droughts demanding adaptation of institutions and infrastructure. 
 Forestry: Forestry remains important for  rural livelihoods both through direct employment and 
through ecosystem services.  Forests face tree loss and degradation from extreme events and from 
the combination of earlier snowmelt and hot, dry summers.  Regional droughts and shifting wind 
patterns have already increased the frequency and intensity of wildfires.  Strong winds, which are 
projected to increase as climate changes, can not only spread wildfires but also  spark the initial 
conflagration.  A changing climate can also redistribute tree species, with warming causing shifts 
to higher latitudes. The new patterns can also provoke outbreaks of insect infestations, as seen in 
the northern march of damaging pests in boreal forests around the world.20 

71. 
Energy efficiency is a priority.  More than half of the CO2 emissions in BH are generated in the 
energy sector (52 percent).  Coal accounts for 75 percent of BH emissions.  Adopting and enforcing key 
EU environmental regulations are key steps towards more sustainable energy mix, reduced emissions, and 
further integration with the rest of Europe.  In particular, compliance with the EU Directive on large 
combustion plants by 201721, and the Europe 2020 Initiative on energy efficiency.  

19  According to the 2009 World Bank ECA flagship report “Managing Uncertainty: Adapting to Climate Change in 
Europe and Central Asia” – BH is ranked in the middle among ECA countries in terms of the impact index which 
captures the relative strength of future climate change relative to today’s natural variability. 
20 Easterling et al. 2007. 
21 The EU Large Combustion Plant Directive sets emission standards for member countries for nitrogen oxides, 
sulfur dioxide and particulates from all power stations with an installed capacity greater than 50 megawatts. Under 
the directive legislation power stations that do not meet the specified emission standards must either retrofit 
appropriate pollution control equipment or close down.  

19 

 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                            
IV. COUNTRY RESPONSE TO CHALLENGES AND PRIORITIES  

72. 
BH drafted a Country Development Strategy. 22  As might be expected, the strategy is the 
product of coordination among the different administrative levels and stakeholders.  While the current 
draft has not been adopted and it may require more work to become a "countrywide" strategy, it reflects 
the contributions of all levels of government (the state level Council of Minister, FBH, RS, and Brcko 
district) and it reflects development objectives and activities that are broadly followed by all levels of 
government in BH.  

73. Moreover, while ethnic divisions continue to shape political alignments and undermine 
governance efficiency, there are no fundamental ideological or even significant technocratic 
differences among the authorities at the Entity and State level on most macroeconomic and sectoral 
issues.   Policymakers at all levels of government see BH’s future as an open, export oriented market fully 
engaged with the EU, and understand that improved transport and communications infrastructure are 
critical for economic growth and integration in South East Europe.  There is consensus on seizing the 
country’s rich potential in forestry and water, but in a sustainable fashion.  And there is universal 
agreement that BH must strengthen its human capital through better education outcomes and intensive 
worker training.  Underlying all of this, even on the toughest issues, most acknowledge that a reduced 
economic role for the state is necessary for improved competitiveness.  By and large, BH policymakers, 
civil society and the private sector share a vision for the priority development challenges in their country; 
however, the vision is far less clear with respect to how these priorities should be achieved and the degree 
of coordination between Entities, and Entities and the State level that is desirable to achieve. 

74. 
EU Integration:  There is a broad consensus that EU integration should be the guiding principle 
of every segment of social and political community in our country.  Progress toward EU membership will 
require a less cumbersome governance system, and that the key challenge in the near future is the 
development of a single methodological approach for meeting acquis requirements and ensuring 
implementation is the same in the whole country.  The Development Plan also, however, stresses that this 
will have to be undertaken in BH’s unique context: “reforms require the need to strengthen 
administrative and institutional capacities….in accordance with the existing constitutional structure”23. 
 Macroeconomic Stability: The authorities acknowledge 
that BH can only achieve 
macroeconomic stability by reducing the size of the public sector and redirecting reduced 
spending from public administration and social transfers to infrastructure and social investments. 
In addition, the Strategy notes the importance of the investment climate and trade. 
 Competitiveness:  BH is among the least competitive economies in ECA, and it is moving in the 
wrong direction according to the 2009-2010 World Economic Forum survey.  Major problems 
include inadequate infrastructure, an underdeveloped legal system, which contributes to poor 
contract enforcement, and a fragmented regulatory framework.  BH’s Strategy notes that 
simplified and harmonized regulations would contribute to the establishment of a single economic 
space, which would stimulate growth and competitiveness.  The Strategy also commits to increase 
the number of students with technical training, encourage on-the job training, and to stop the 
brain drain out of BH, which accelerated during the war, and to bring expatriate talent back home. 
 Employment: To increase employment, the authorities have prioritized increasing SME’s access 
to financing for capital investment, human resources, and for encouraging the development of

Planning, 2010

business incubators.  The Strategy also looks at introducing greater flexibility in the regulations 
governing the hiring and firing of workers, hours, wages, and types of work arrangements.  As 
mentioned above, it calls for more effective and responsive labor market institutions to help those 
who are unemployed and seeking work back into the labor market.  
 Sustainable Development: BH is a predominantly rural country, and while agriculture 
production represents a great area of potential for economic growth and employment, and must be 
modernized, the country’s rural areas must be developed “holistically,” based on a versatile use of 
natural resources, and their protection for future generations.  In agriculture, the Strategy calls for 
investments in technology to improve the efficiency of primary production, and to move toward 
secondary production, or processing, to boost employment.  It also looks beyond farming to 
improve living conditions and diversify the rural economy and job opportunities.  The Strategy is 
also explicit about stronger integration of environmental protection, particularly by adopting EU 
policies, and focuses significantly on stimulating renewable sources of energy. 

 Social Inclusion: The strategy aims to “increase participation of the inactive, discouraged 
population and their reintegration into social life, the labor market, and the equity of opportunities 
for employment”.  This will reduce the fiscal burden of social transfers and increase the 
contributions and talents of more BH citizens, particularly women. 

V. WORLD BANK GROUP STRATEGY 

A.  
Experience and Lessons Learned 
Current portfolio 
75. 
The World Bank supports a portfolio of 12 operations with commitments totaling US$302.3 
million (June 30, 2011).  These operations are financed by seven IDA credits totaling US$154 million, 
three IBRD loans of US$130 million, and three GEF grants of US$18.3 million.  The FY11 disbursement 
ratio exceeded 25 percent.  This robust disbursement performance, sustained over the last three FYs, and 
the continued reductions in effectiveness delays, achieved in the context of a uniquely complex 
institutional environment, testify to ownership of the Bank supported program and concerted efforts from 
all local stakeholders.  Indeed, the disbursement ratio improved significantly throughout the CPS period.  
In the first year of the CPS it was at 13 percent, well below ECA and Bank average, and in FY10 it 
peaked at 26 percent (see Table 2).  Moreover, the time between Board approval and effectiveness was 
reduced from 11 months in the period 2007-2009, to seven months in 2010.  Most operations maintained 
satisfactory ratings in Implementation Progress (IP) and Development Objective (DO) during the CPS.

Lessons from the CPS Completion report 

76. World Bank Group support over the FY08-FY11 CPS was highly relevant under both 
pillars of the FY08-11 CPS: (i) improving the environment for private sector led growth and 
convergence with Europe, and (ii) improving the quality of Government spending and the delivery 

21 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
of public services for the vulnerable.  Both areas have remained central to BH’s development agenda, 
and Bank Group activities have provided direct, timely support. 
77. 
The FY08-11 CPS Completion Report (CPSPR) identified a number of lessons related to the 
overall strategy, project implementation, and Bank and borrower performance that are helping to 
guide the new CPS.  Key lessons are noted below: 
 The Bank can support structural reforms in BH’s politically complex environment, but 
long-term commitment is needed. Bank support to structural reforms—e.g, business 
environment reform through the Business Enabling Environment Structural Adjustment Credit—
suggests structural reforms in BH take time to implement, and desired outcomes may be achieved 
only in stages and over the medium term.  Thus, a longer-term commitment and a combination of 
financial and advisory services are needed to achieve lasting results. 
It is crucial to build consensus during project preparation. In a politically complex 
environment such as BH, it is necessary to reach basic consensus on all aspects of institutional 
and implementation arrangements during the project preparation. 

 

 Limited World Bank group resources should be allocated strategically to maximize 
development outcomes in key sectors.  The Bank’s portfolio has been consolidated from 16 
projects worth US$300 million in 2008 to 12 projects worth US$300 million in June 2011.  
Further consolidation will continue in the new CPS, focusing on fewer but larger operations. 
Small stand-alone operations should be avoided.  Additional financing and project restructuring 
should be considered in sectors where there is need to scale up operations or where new 
circumstances require a different approach.  This will require making tough strategic choices in 
consultation with the local authorities and in some cases even exiting certain sectors.

 The Bank’s decision to maintain flexibility to adapt to changing circumstances while 
pursuing “core” and “non-core” program areas has proven successful.24  This enabled the 
Bank to pursue investment lending in “core” areas while maintaining policy dialogue and 
opportunity for engagement in the “non-core” areas.  For example, when the opportunity 
emerged, the Bank played a lead role in helping the Governments achieve the objective of 
reviewing and streamlining social spending schemes with a view to improving their effectiveness.  

 Results are possible even in BH’s politically difficult environment when interventions are 
well aligned with investment priorities of the government.  The Bank applied lessons learned 

24 The CPS defined as “core” those activities for which the political commitment and ownership by the various 
administrative level of BH has been tested, and  as “non-core” those important areas for investment and/or reform 
for which political commitment needs testing or for which commitment is apparent but ceilings on available 
resources  prevent implementation at a given time.

during the FY05-FY08 CAS period and fully aligned its portfolio to the investment priorities of 
the governments in BH.  Whereas in the previous CAS, the portfolio included structural 
adjustment credits and associated TA projects for which there was little commitment, the 
structure of the portfolio during the last CPS period mainly included investment operations for 
which there was high level of commitment and readiness for implementation.

 The Bank should continue to strengthen ties with development partners.  Important 
collaboration is underway with the EU and IFIs (IMF, EBRD, EIB, CoEDB) in particular, but 
also with bilateral donors, as with Swedish SIDA, an important partner in activities related to 
business climate and export competitiveness.  The IMF has been the key partner in structural 
reforms in the social sector as these reforms are central to the IMF’s stabilization program.  
Successful partnerships are also ongoing with EBRD and EIB in the transport sector and energy 
sector, and with CoEDB in the health. 

78. 
Donor assistance in BH has been dominated by funding from European institutions, 
including assistance through the EU IPA mechanism.  In 2010, the EIB approved contracts of €205 
million to BH to improve the quality of health care, strengthen emergency flood relief, and provide credit 
lines for SME growth—bringing its total portfolio to €848.7 million.  The EBRD supports an active 
portfolio of €1.03 billion through 25 public and private sector projects, mainly in municipal, 
environmental and transport infrastructure.  BH’s funding from IPA and EU sources equaled nearly €440 
million in the period from 2007 to 2011, and assistance was directed at virtually all development sectors.  
The Bank remains an important player with annual disbursements averaging US$83 million during 
FY09–FY11 as discussed above.  More modest funding is provided from other international institutions, 
including the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), which supports projects in achieving 
MDGs and reducing human poverty, fostering democratic governance, improving energy infrastructure, 
and environment.  The Global Fund to Fight AIDS and Tuberculosis has also been active in Bosnia and 
Herzegovina, providing US$3.6 million in 2010.  Key bilateral donors including, inter alia, Germany, 

23 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
France, Sweden, Austria and the United States, have also engaged in a number of sectors such as 
infrastructure, private sector development, housing construction, water and sanitation, health and justice.

79. 
The Bank remains active in efforts to improve aid effectiveness and coordination in BH.  
For example, the Bank is leading an initiative aimed at strengthening the coordination between the BH 
authorities and the European multilateral and bilateral lenders on the implementation of a sizeable 
outstanding project portfolio in transport, energy and local infrastructure.  The partnership with the EC is 
described in Box 4 (page 37). 

80. 
This CPS is the product of intensive dialogue with BH authorities, civil society, and donor 
partners.  Given the highly decentralized nature of BH, and particularly in light of the fluid dynamics 
leading up to and following October’s elections, special effort was required to ensure the CPS would be 
informed by the authorities and civil society.  The Bank organized a series of six policy roundtables 
during the period June 2010-June 2011.  The purpose of these roundtables, organized in partnership with 
local think-tanks and academia, was to gather a broad group of stakeholders (government officials, MPs, 
CSOs, academia, private sector, international organizations, and media) to discuss key issues affecting 
economic development in BH as the country moves towards EU accession.  The overarching theme was 
how to improve the competitiveness of the economy.  In addition to generating policy dialogue about 
development priorities in the key sectors, the roundtable discussions provided input for the CPS design.  

B. CPS Objectives, Pillars and Expected Outcomes 

81. With the overall objective of supporting  BH’s European integration goal, it is expected that 
this CPS will: (i) support economic growth,  by tackling some of the bottlenecks to faster 
productivity and competitiveness; (ii) improve social inclusion by strengthening the targeting and 
fiscal sustainability of social benefits and improving the delivery of basic public services; and (iii) 
strengthen the sustainable use of key natural resources, such as water and forests, and improve 
climate change adaptation.   The CPS recognizes that the goals of competitiveness, social inclusion and 
environmental sustainability are fundamentally interrelated, and that planned interventions will support a 
24 

 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
range of development objectives.  For example, increasing access to basic services such as water and solid 
waste sites impacts all three areas—we know, for example, that access to such services expands social 
equity; it also reduces obstacles to investment and promises a cleaner, healthier country going forward.  
Equally, the DPO is listed below under “competitiveness”, but could easily be included under “social 
inclusion”.  The mapping of CPS outcomes to the Bank’s ongoing and planned interventions reflects their 
cross cutting nature.   Activities under this CPS will consider and capitalize on these linkages. 

82. 
Planned lending during the CPS period is underpinned by AAA activities carried out over 
the past 2-3 years and new AAA activities (both country-specific and regional).  Design of each of 
the major lending activities foreseen for the CPS builds on recently-completed or ongoing AAA activities.  
New AAAs will aim to supplement the lending program to achieve specified CPS outcomes. The public 
expenditure DPO series, for example, builds on a major study on how BH fared in protecting the poor 
during the crisis; similarly, planned lending in irrigation and land registration will be fundamentally 
informed by a 2010 Agriculture Sector Policy Note which has provided the basis for engagement with the 
authorities.  Looking forward, the Bank Group envisages continued engagement.  For instance, to help 
establish a stronger, more competitive business climate, work will continue on regional analysis in the 
area of financial sector development and private sector accounting and auditing, including through the 
Vienna based REPARIS activities, following the recommendations of the 2010 ROSC.  This will be 
followed in the second year of the CPS with a regional study on innovation and analytical activities.  IFC 
will complement this work with advisory services, particularly to promote public-private partnerships in 
infrastructure.  To support new approaches to social inclusion, intensive work has been underway in the 
Western Balkans on poverty and gender analysis—this will continue with studies during FY13-15; and to 
better understand both the fiscal and demographic challenges facing BH, a pension study is planned for 
FY12 to support the DPO series.  To help BH better protect its natural resources, work will continue on 
an integrated water study for the Vrbas river; and in FY14 on an energy strategy to help the country reach 
consensus for both productivity and environmental purposes.  

83. 
The program will benefit from analytical work on climate change undertaken elsewhere in 
the region.  The Bank, with support from Sweden and Norway, is undertaking a major study in FYR 
Macedonia on how to reduce its high energy intensity, strengthen the dependability of energy supply, and 
meet EU green house gas emissions standards.  The study, which follows similar work in Poland, is 
designed to help FYR Macedonia balance the challenge of ensuring continued economic growth and 
competitiveness with fuller consideration of climate change and environmental quality. Meeting the EU 
environmental acquis, promoting efficient use of natural resources, preserving biodiversity, and 
enhancing tourism opportunities are increasingly important to national development concerns.  As all of 
the Western Balkans confront similar challenges, this work can inform development choices in BH. 

 84. 
Underlying progress in all these areas will be a more efficient and effective public 
administration, not just in each Entity, but across the country.  The Bank will be supporting this with 
a Public Expenditure Review as well as through regional work in public financial management.  The 
Bank hopes to use this work in the broader area of governance to build on ongoing engagement with 
respect to the administration of Bank financed (and externally financed) projects in PFM. 

85. 
To strengthen governance and anti-corruption policies in BH the Bank will align its efforts 
with the EU accession process.  The EC, several European donors, USAID and UNDP continue to lead 
the efforts in public administration reform, training of journalists, and the Governance Accountability 
Project.  The Bank will complement these efforts in its areas of expertise:  the strengthening of 
government effectiveness and regulatory quality—two important dimensions for the creation of the 
European administrative space.  DPO financing will continue to focus on improving the efficiency and 
effectiveness of public spending.  IFC and the Bank, supported by grant financing from SIDA, will focus 
25 

 
 
 
 
 
on improving the regulatory quality of governance.  The on-going program supporting the delivery of 
basic public services at the municipal level, which will be complemented by a significant grant program 
provided by the EC, will continue to strengthen local governance based on the recommendations of the 
2009 local governance and service delivery study25. The IFC Southeast Europe Regional Trade Logistics 
Project will be funded under the EU Multibeneficiary IPA funding and support regional integration as a 
step towards EU accession.

Finally, officials are supportive of a Bank managed Public Expenditure and Financial 
Accountability (PEFA) project focusing on the State, Entities and Brčko District financial 
management.  A grant funded PEFA assessment could provide a useful, independent perspective on

PFM performance and complement EC efforts in this area.  It could also provide the foundation for 
further efforts to strengthen public financial management and may be a catalyst for drawing the attention 
of government and development partners to priority areas that need attention.  Other international 
organizations have been providing support to public financial management but this support is likely to 
shrink during the term of this CPS. 

87. 
Gender remains an important challenge in BH.  Designing projects and reforms that support 
gender equality requires awareness and conscious efforts to identify the barriers that might prevent 
women’s participation.   The Bank has invested significantly in the Western Balkans in both gender and 
poverty analysis.  During the CPS period, thematic reviews of how gender has been mainstreamed in 
different sectors in the portfolio, to be conducted under the Western Balkans Programmatic Gender 
Monitoring, will identify how to increase the gender inclusiveness of the existing portfolio and inform the 
design of future lending operations.  

Expected Outcomes 

88. 
The contribution of the CPS to the country development goals (CPS outcomes) are 
described in Annex 1.    The following is a description of how the various activities planned under the 
CPS will produce the expected outcomes.  

I: Competitiveness   

89. 
BH confronts a large competitiveness agenda.  While the investment and reform agenda is vast, 
the Bank Group plans to continue to focus on reducing key bottlenecks to increased productivity, and to 
work with BH’s other development partners to establish a coordinated approach in this area.  The Bank’s 
support will be focused primarily on reducing restraints to productivity, such as transport, local public 
services, energy, land registration and agriculture, and enhancing SME’s access to capital.  These 
investments are being complemented by TA in corporate accounting and regional work on science and 
innovation.  IFC is providing technical assistance in regulatory reform, reduction of administrative burden 
and attraction of FDI, as well as direct financing and advisory services in the financial sector, agribusiness 
and energy sectors.  The overall competitiveness of the economy will also be supported by the DPO 
program aimed at strengthening the quality of public expenditure, particularly in the social sectors, thus 
supporting macroeconomic stability.  The proposed Public Expenditure DPO programmatic series will 
support (i) increased social assistance to the poor, while reducing the fiscal deficit and creating fiscal 
space for poverty-reducing growth; (ii) improved structure and efficiency of public expenditure; and (iii) 
reduced pressures on private sector wages from faster wage growth in the public sector, thereby 
enhancing private sector competitiveness.  In addition, the program aims over the medium term to revise 
pension formulas in both entities to make the benefits more predictable and the financing sustainable, and 
limit the burden on the private sector imposed by the fiscal deficit, the pension and health insurance 
system and public sector wages.  

 
CPS Outcome: Improved Business Environment:  IFC assistance will focus on reducing the 
costs and risks of doing business and increase competitiveness of BH’s decentralized economic space at 
the sub-national and national levels.  At the sub-national level, IFC will help to reduce administrative 
barriers and increase competitiveness through regulatory simplification to create more uniformity and 
transparency in regulations as well as facilitate development of a single economic space through 
regulatory reform at the local, cantonal, entity and national levels.  At the national level, IFC will support 
the country’s efforts to streamline international taxation treaties and avoid double taxation of entities, as 
well as to attract FDI by improving the regulatory, policy and institutional framework for investment.  
27 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
IFC will also explore options to deepen work in the agribusiness sector and increase competitiveness and 
attraction of investments.  IFC will also support BH to further improve trade logistics' related regulatory 
and administrative constraints, harmonize border clearance with other countries, and further aligning rules 
on EU practices linked to the CEFTA regional trade agenda. BH is benefiting from IFC’s regional 
approach in the Western Balkans including regional Trade Logistics project and Energy Community of 
South East Europe program. 

 
CPS Outcome: Improved investment climate and reduced costs and risks of conducting 
business in BH.  Sweden is continuing support to BH through two Trust Funds—executed by the Bank 
and IFC—designed to further strengthen BH’s export competitiveness.  The World Bank Group has been 
supporting BH’ business environment reforms for many years through policy advice and lending 
operations.  In 2002, the Bank in collaboration with the Swedish International Cooperation Development 
Agency (SIDA) launched the BAC (Business Environment Adjustment Credit).  The BAC initiated a 
number of reforms which were further supported by IFC advisory services and other technical assistance.  
A follow-up Swedish TF of some US$5 million will build on the result of previous activities by 
streamlining and reorganizing inspections in accordance with EU requirements; speeding up business 
registration and reforming the bankruptcy process.  IFC is proposing to carry on a project during FY12 - 
FY14 that provides support at the national and sub-national level to reduce administrative barriers and 
increase competitiveness through regulatory simplification to create more uniformity and transparency in 
regulations; assist in improving competitiveness of agribusinesses sector and reduce double taxation 
burden to businesses. At the national level, the project will support the country’s efforts to improve its 
low levels of FDI attraction, and address its strategic goal of EU accession by improving the regulatory, 
policy and institutional framework for investment. Finally, the project will look at administrative barriers 
to export in key sectors in BH and help government to streamline the processes.  In particular the project 
will improve transparency and quality of information on bilateral and international taxation agreements 
legally binding in BH.  Finally, IFC plans to continue its work in promoting good corporate governance 
through an ECA-wide regional project (intended to include BH), principally through focusing on the 
capacity building of local institutions to offer advisory services in corporate governance.  Activities will 
aim to help companies attract new investors and improve business processes through better corporate 
governance. 

 
CPS Outcome: Improved access to finance for small and medium enterprises. The FY09 
Enhancing Small and Medium Enterprise Access to Finance project was developed during the depth of 
the global economic and financial crisis to address one of the chief constraints to growth in BH’s 
enterprise sector—access to term capital.  The main component of the project is a credit line to be 
extended through participating financial institutions to creditworthy private enterprises for viable projects. 
The eligible financing will cover investments and/or incremental working capital in industry, agro-
processing and the related service sectors.  The project, which is scheduled to close in FY15, will seek to 
increase the number of loans and the amount of medium and long-term credit extended to SMEs; 
strengthen payment performance of the sub-borrowers in the project and reduce the number and volume 
of non-performing sub-loans; and, ultimately, improve the investment and export performance of the sub-
borrowers, and bolster employment generation.  

 
CPS Outcome: Stronger and broader financial sector: IFC will continue its support for the 
banking sector with a focus on broadening access to finance, especially for micro, small and medium 
enterprises (SMEs).  IFC will provide a wide verity of products tailored to needs of local banks including 
credit lines for SMEs, energy efficiency and renewable energy products.  In addition, IFC will continue to 
contribute to strengthening of the microfinance institutions, addressing the economic disparity between 
rural/semi-urban and urban development. As in the past, in addition to financing, IFC will provide 
advisory assistance to strengthen the microfinance institutions, and support the transformation of 

28 

 
 
 
 
microfinance institutions into sustainable for-profit financial intermediaries in the FBH by clearing 
bottlenecks in existing regulation. Also, IFC will explore with the entity ministries of finance the 
mechanisms to address the over indebtedness of micro entrepreneurs in BH. 

 
CPS Outcome: Increased private investment in infrastructure.  IFC will continue to explore 
innovative ways of crowding-in private sector financing for infrastructure projects in view of the need to 
achieve better infrastructure integration both regionally and within the country. As in the past, IFC 
remains interested in providing advisory services to help the Government create a more commercial 
approach and generate greater involvement of the private sector in the infrastructure sectors through PPPs 
in the energy, transport, and health sectors. However, private sector participation in the infrastructure 
sectors is hampered by the limited role for commercially oriented players and the lack of cost-
effectiveness. Also, the regulators in the roads and railways sectors need to be strengthened and further 
unbundling is a priority in the power sector. Therefore, IFC contribution to successful PPPs will depend 
on market demand, government progress with privatization/concessions, institutional reforms, and 
improvements in the legal framework. 

 
CPS Outcome: Improved the competitiveness of local companies in sectors that can 
successfully compete with their exports in the regional market.  Since most of the companies in the real 
sector are MSMEs, IFC will provide its support mainly through the banking sector. However, IFC will 
selectively look for a few direct SME financing to have a good demonstration affect in the financial 
market. IFC is committed to support strategic FDI in BH by encouraging good regional companies to 
expand their operations in BH.  Priority sectors include agribusiness, wood and metals processing, 
energy, property and tourism. In addition, IFC will provide advisory services to the agribusiness sector 
companies, particularly in the food safety.  Though its Regional Cleaner Production program IFC plans to 
work with private sector clients directly on improving resource efficiency in various sectors in BH. 

 
CPS Outcome: BH’s participation in the South East Europe Energy Market, and eventual 
integration into the EU energy market.  The on-going ECSEE APL3 project is improving dam safety; 
reducing adverse environmental impacts at thermal power stations; replacing ageing facilities and 
equipment at hydropower and thermal power stations; rehabilitating distribution systems; establishing a 
market operation system, and improving corporate governance through implementation of pilot projects 
in financial management information system.  Progress to date has been solid.  Generation and export of 
electricity have reached record levels; environmental compliance has improved with the installation of 
emissions controls at the Kakanj thermal plant near Sarajevo; and dam safety measures are being assessed 
which will form the basis for the European Investment Bank to finance the necessary investments to 
improve dam safety at seven facilities; one of the power companies (EPHZHB) used its own resources to 
scale up the financial management information system throughout the company and seeing the benefits 
the other two power companies (EPBiH and EPRS) have also decided to implement these systems 
throughout their companies.  The project was restructured in late 2010 and until the new scheduled 
closing date in mid 2012, will focus on implementation of remaining measures for improvement of 
environmental performance at Tuzla, Kakanj, Ugljevik and Gacko thermal power plants.  The Bank is 
working closely with other providers of funding, including EIB, EBRD, and KFW. 

 
CPS Outcome: Stronger State and Entity institutions to deliver more efficient and effective 
agricultural services.  Increasing the competitiveness and productivity of farmers and agro-processors is 
paramount to ensure the viability of the agriculture sector and improved rural livelihoods. The project has 
contributed to the increased institutional capacity and agricultural information essential to making BH’s 
agricultural sector more competitive.  For example, pest inspections using standard risk analysis are 
increasing, rulebooks on phytosanitary requirements have been completed, and food safety reference 

29 

 
 
 
 
 
laboratories are being constructed.  Activities in FY12 are designed to help build systems that will bring 
BH into compliance with EU Agricultural and Regional Development standards.  

 
CPS Outcome: Improved irrigation systems and institutional framework to support increased 
agricultural production for farmers and agricultural producers.  Crop yields, and potential options for 
growing high-value crops and double-cropping, are restricted without irrigation primarily due to 
prolonged dry spells during the summer season.  In most locations in the country the transition from 
subsistence and marginal farming to commercial agriculture would rely on the timely availability of 
irrigation water.  Key results would include (i) functioning irrigation schemes growing higher-value 
irrigated crops; (ii) schemes with significantly changed cropping pattern; (iii) total production (crop areas 
and yields) increased by 20 percent in the project areas; (iv) service fee collection rates at 70 percent of 
the agreed tariff within two cropping seasons after the start of the irrigation service; and (v) conducive 
regulatory framework for irrigation management.  Project preparation is to be supported by EU funds. 

 
CPS Outcome: Upgraded road network to reduce traffic accidents and accommodate yearly 
hikes in traffic volumes.  The 2007 Road Infrastructure and Safety project, co-financed with EBRD and 
EIB, (scheduled to close in mid 2012), will rehabilitate some 220 km of roads, reducing user costs, 
cutting injuries and fatalities, and making the country more competitive as a transit route.  Road 
rehabilitation has been complemented by institutional progress, with Entity level road safety strategies 
and the establishment in the RS of a road safety agency.  During FY12, the project will complete the civil 
works for the remaining road sections to be rehabilitated and focus on strengthening the collection of road 
user costs and road condition data, as well as seeing the outputs of the road safety technical assistance. 

 
CPS Outcome: Improved commercial use of Sava River Corridor across boundaries of Croatia, 
BH and Serbia.  The 1992-1995 war severely damaged the Sava River, which had served an important 
role in the region’s transportation network.  The Sava River Navigability project, scheduled to be 
presented to the Board in FY13, will support the removal of debris, dredging, strengthening river banks, 
and other infrastructure repair. It will also modernize navigability on the river through an information and 
tracking system, strengthened institutional management, and support to generate investment in mine 
clearance.  It is part of a sub-regional initiative, with the Bank financing the rehabilitation works in BH, 
with the works in Croatia and Serbia likely to be funded by the EU.  The project was originally included 
in the FY08-FY11 CPS, but was postponed in part because of the financial crisis.  

 
CPS Outcome: Orderly development of transparent land markets through registration of real 
estate rights and complimentary policies that enable transactions to be made with security and 
efficiency.  With less than half a year until its closure, it is expected that the project will complete the 
reduction of what was an enormous backlog of cases (80,000 in 2006).  Impressive progress has been 
achieved in large courts, such as Sarajevo, Banja Luka, Tuzla and Mostar. Renovation works will 
continue to improve the working conditions and service provision in land registration and cadastre 
offices.  Digitizing of records has proceeded well, both for the digitizing of land book folios and the 
cadastral maps.  The expected outputs for the whole project are already over 90 percent achieved, and it is 
expected that all targets will be achieved before the end of the project period.  A potential follow on 
operation would further improve the quality and accuracy of land records and support local development 
by helping to solve the problems that investors experience in the land market and in obtaining 
construction permits. 

30 

 
 
 
 
 
 
II: Inclusion 

90. 
This CPS will support the country goal of improved social inclusion by focusing on 
increasing the targeting and fiscal sustainability of cash transfers, strengthening job services, and 
improving the delivery of local level basic public services such as waste management. 

 
CPS Outcome: Increased share of social benefits reach the poorest, with more effective job 
services.  Despite extraordinarily high expenditures on social assistance, benefits for those with very low 
incomes, for child benefits and for people with non-war related disability are either small or non-existent.  
The Bank supported the Government in the ambitious reform of its social benefits system, to make it both 
more sustainable and effective in reducing poverty.  The 2010 Social Safety Net and Employment project 
will continue throughout the CPS to provide BH with technical assistance toward establishing a targeting 
system, improved transparency and reporting about beneficiaries, and the provision of job brokerage 
services to vulnerable active job-seekers. 

 
CPS Outcome: Reduced incidence of non-communicable disease through increased access to 
quality family medicine primary health care.  The 2005 Health Sector Enhancement project, which has 
been extended until 2014 through additional financing, is supporting both Entities in developing primary 
health care strategies to increase the number of qualified primary health care practitioners and the 
physical infrastructure necessary for their practice; improved management capacity; and strengthened 
evaluation of the sector.  In 2010, the authorities requested additional financing to scale up project 
activities in both Entities to enhance the development impact, covering the education of more family 
medicine doctors, the retraining of more existing primary health care teams and reaching more 
communities through the upgrade of the family medicine offices.  The project will provide this support 
throughout the CPS period.  To address the larger sectoral policy issues, the Bank is providing analytical 
support through a review of public expenditures including health.   

 
CPS Outcome: Improved availability, quality, environmental soundness, and financial viability 
of solid waste management services in participating utilities/regions.  The Second Solid Waste 
Management project, which became effective in late 2009 and is expected to close in early 2014, is 
designed to achieve the following outcomes: reduce by half the number of BH households not served by 
the formal waste management system; close a quarter of the dangerous wild dump sites that scar the 
countryside; improve ground water quality at disposal sites; strengthen cost recovery of solid waste 
utilities; and improve environmental monitoring of the sector.  EU co-financing for landfills in Banja 
Luka and Mostar will further improve the quality and expand the scope of solid waste management 
services.  Additional EU co-financing (€5.7 million) will also be available during this CPS period to 
finance investments in five more regional landfills and consequently further increase the scale of the 
ongoing Second Solid Waste Management Project.  

III: Environmental Sustainability 

91. 
The CPS aims to ensure that natural resources important for the country’s economic and 
social development, such as water and forests, are managed sustainably. 

 
CPS Outcome:  Reduction in the population's exposure to, and reliance on, highly polluted 
water from the Miljacka and Bosna Rivers; and improved efficiency of waste water collection in the 
Sarajevo Canton.  The Sarajevo Waste Water project, a co-financing partnership between the World 
Bank and the EU, is expected to close at the end of the CPS period.  The project will support the 

31 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
reduction of river pollution through treatment of waste water treated at the primary level and the 
upgrading of waste water infrastructure in the project area.  

 
CPS Outcome: Reduced pollution from municipal sources into the Neretva and Bosna Rivers, 
and ultimately reduced municipal pollution and nutrients in the Adriatic Sea and the Danube Basin. 
The GEF Water Quality Protection and GEF Neretva and Trebisnjica projects are strengthening water 
management, 
including regional cooperation with Croatia, Montenegro, and Serbia 
toward a 
comprehensive water improvement plan.  Before its closure in August 2012 and December 2013 
respectively, the project will continue to rehabilitate waste water treatment plants in participating cities 
and identify achievable annual reductions in nutrient and effluent discharge and movement toward 
compliance with the EU water law.  EU grant co-financing for GEF Neretva and Trebisnjica Management 
project will allow for additional investments to rehabilitate the sewerage network in Ljubuski.  

 
CPS Outcome:  Improved sewerage and water treatment at municipal level.   A planned 
partnership with the EC is likely to mobilize additional EU IPA grant funds to support the improvement 
of sewerage and waste water treatment under the IPA 12-13 allocations. 

 
CPS Outcome: Expanded network of protected forest and mountain areas, and strengthened 
institutional and technical capacity for their sustainable management.  The GEF Forest and Mountain 
Protected Areas Project, which is expected to close in mid-2013, is supporting protected area 
development through local initiatives in biodiversity conservation.  To date, both Entities have allocated 
budget for protected area management—with protected areas having nearly quadrupled since the project’s 
approval—and management plans are underway for new national parks. 
Box 3: IFC - Renewable Energy in BH 

Renewable Energy (RE in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BH) is part of the larger regional Balkan Renewable Energy 
Program (BREP) with a focus on small hydro power plants. The Project in BH expected to facilitate more than 
US$120 million in financing, including US$15 million from IFC, to support the construction of 40 small 
hydropower plants with a total installed capacity of 80 MW and potential for green-house-gasses emission reduction 
of 0.5Mt CO2/year. Through this project IFC will contribute to improving the existing regulatory framework to 
enable financing in renewable energy projects, assist to the sponsors to strengthen their designs and business plans, 
and improve the capacities of selected financial institutions to evaluate and finance small hydropower plants and 
other renewable energy projects. These activities would be complemented with workshops and seminars targeting 
sponsors, financial institutions and wider public to create a comprehensive framework to support the development 
and implementation of renewable energy projects. IFC will provide long-term financing to the local banks interested 
in financing renewable energy projects. Also, as an IDA country, BH can benefit from IFC’s Infra Venture facility 
that assumes joint work with a sponsor on project development and/or financing. 

 
CPS Outcome: Greater Energy Efficiency: In the infrastructure sector, financing renewable 
energy projects remains one of IFC’s priorities in BH.  IFC’s strategy is to contribute to a more 
environmentally sustainable and efficient energy sector by supporting private investments in greener 
energy with a particular focus on supporting the construction of new hydro power plants. IFC expects to 
play an increasing role through its advisory services as well as its financing to facilitate private financing 
for PPP transactions for new hydro power generation facilities.  Although the Government has recently 
passed a new concessions law that is generally consistent with international best practice, the by-laws and 
regulations have yet to be adopted. The Government has limited experience implementing PPP projects 
and IFC expects to play an important role through both financing and advisory services.  Financial 
support for the key corridors remains also a priority for BH and PPPs would be an effective and 
sustainable solution for their financing and maintenance.  IFC will look for opportunities to engage with 
financial institutions interested in providing lending to industrial/commercial and residential housing 
sector clients with a focus on energy efficiency projects.  
32 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
CPS outcome: better insurance coverage for BH businesses and households in the event of a 
natural or climatic disaster. The Bank plans to provide investment support to facilitate BH’s 
participation in the Regional Southeastern Europe and Caucasus Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility 
(SEEC CRIF).  The objective of the SEEC CRIF is to increase access to financial protection for the 
Government as well as homeowners, farmers and small and medium enterprises (SMEs) from losses due 
to weather extremes caused by climate change and relevant geo-hazards, such as earthquakes, landslides, 
droughts, floods, etc.  The Government has requested the Bank to provide a small (US$5 million) IDA 
credit to finance its participation in this regional facility, which would be provided out of both the 
country’s allocation and regional IDA resources. 

 
CPS Outcome: better flood preparedness and management along the Drina river basin.  The 
Western Balkans Flood and Drought Initiative would bring a GEF grant to develop cross-border 
cooperation between BH, Serbia and Montenegro for integrated river basin planning and management on 
the Drina—the Sava's largest tributary—which saw major floods twice in 2010.  The Initiative will 
address flood protection, early flood warning capability, drought mitigation, hydropower operation and 
eco-system management.  It will introduce best-practices in river management at a regional scale in 
compliance with the EU Water Framework Directive (WFD), and help apply measures for adaptation to 
climate change.  The Initiative would generate substantial national as well as regional benefits, with an 
important role for the International Sava and Danube Commissions.  Additionally, BH would use this 
planning and capacity building to seek incremental Regional IDA credits to reduce vulnerability against 
floods along the Drina.  This could include investments for rehabilitation and improvement of dyke and 
related infrastructure, and restoration of flood plains and river channels, to improve flood security.  Policy 
options and designs will be informed by the integrated river basin management analysis resulting from the 
Regional GEF Initiative.  The BH flood and drought investments may potentially attract IPA funds. 

C.  
Operational Principles and Partnerships 
92. 
Four principles underlie the operational approach in this CPS: (i) selectivity, (ii) flexibility, 
(iii) result focus, and (iv) partnerships. These principles are derived from the lessons of experience in 
the previous CPS and consistent with best practice in Middle-Income Countries.  Additionally, there will 
be an emphasis, whenever the conditions allow it, to promote the use of regional projects to support the 
further integration of the BH economy with neighboring economies and cooperation in the region. 
 Greater selectivity will lead to portfolio consolidation.  Lending for fewer, larger projects and 
greater selectivity in new lending are key elements of the Bank strategy in the ECA region.  It 
represents a critically important change necessitated by limited lending envelopes and constrained 
administrative budgets, and will free up Bank internal resources for more analytical and advisory 
work to provide timely knowledge to address the country’s emerging challenges. 26 
 The framework will be applied flexibly over the course of the CPS.  An initial selection of 
programs for FY12-FY13 is proposed below (table 7).  The technical analysis and a good part of 
preparation for these programs were completed during the FY07-FY11 CPS.  However, the 
selection of interventions—particularly for the outer years of the CPS—remains open to 
modification at an early CPS progress review, as reform priorities for the newly elected 
authorities evolve and based upon performance of the ongoing programs and availability of funds.  
 The operational framework will focus on the impact of WBG supported activities.   The 
emphasis on results contributing to the achievement of the program’s development objectives will 
guide the implementation of the CPS and joint reviews of the program with the local authorities. 

26 Additionally, with fewer Bank-financed projects under implementation, the Bank will in a better position to meet 
the growing demand to implement externally (mostly EU) co-financed operations. 

33 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                            
 Partnerships with other development partners will be developed and strengthened.  In 
particular the partnership with the EU will continue to be strengthened on the principle that 
Bank’s assistance should be aligned almost entirely with and support BH’s EU accession effort 
93. 
This CPS builds on an analysis of BH’s key development challenges, and proposes support 
and expanded coordination with European partners to help advance EU accession.  The EU has 
established clear criteria for BH’s accession and the EC identifies the strategic objectives of the 
Instrument for Pre-accession Assistance (IPA) on the basis of a Multi-annual Indicative Planning 
Document (MIPD)27. The EU is supporting the MIPD agenda with some €108 million per year IPA funds.  
Further it monitors progress in each potential candidate country along three key areas: Political Criteria; 
Economic Criteria; and ability to assume the obligation of membership in various sectors, and issues 
annual reports on the progress achieved.   Proposed Bank Group assistance is informed by these reports, 
with specific interventions determined by where there is a comparative advantage.   

94. 
The Bank strategy supports some key EU MIPD goals.  Under the MIPD political criteria the 
priority is the strengthening of administrative capacity in BH to achieve a more sustainable and functional 
public sector.  Social inclusion of vulnerable groups and the implementation of a vigorous anti-corruption 
strategy are also priorities.  The Bank is contributing to these goals with the DPO program and the Social 
Safety net project, and other project and AAAs activities targeted at technical issues of governance.  The 
MIPD economic criteria focus on macroeconomic stability, business environment and competitiveness for 
economic growth and job creation, particularly through the strengthening of regulatory capacity, the 
development of the SMEs sector and local economic development, as well as through the strengthening of 
active labor market measures.  The EC’s 2010 progress report noted some areas of progress, including 
adherence to the IMF SBA and the reform of social expenditures supported by the Bank’s DPO, the 
maintenance of monetary and financial stability, and overall market integration with the EU.  Areas of 
concern relate to high unemployment and the structural rigidities such as the high rates of social 
contributions and low labor mobility that hurt job creation and labor market participation.  It further notes 
high and poorly targeted social transfers that reduce the propensity to work.  These are all areas in which 
the Bank is active and will continue to provide support during this CPS.  Finally, with respect to BH’s 
capacity to adopt European standards, the MIPD supports among other priorities the strengthening of a 
single economic space in BH, the expansion of quality infrastructure, the enhancing of agriculture, food 
and rural development, the prioritization of environmental infrastructure, and cross-border cooperation 
with Croatia , Montenegro and Serbia.  Again, Bank Group assistance proposed in this CPS strategy is 
fully aligned with these goals. 

95. 
The Bank Group and the EC have also agreed to develop a program of co-financing in the 
area of environmental infrastructure. Box 4 describes this program mostly focused on water and water 
treatment and solid waste management at local level and the table below illustrates where the Bank has 
and will continue to complement and leverage the EU investments.

D. 

The CPS Financing Program 

96. 
New World Bank financing during the CPS period will be constrained.  The majority of 
financing during FY12-FY15 will likely come from completion of operations started under the previous 
CPS.  Total remaining disbursements of the active portfolio are expected to amount to some US$200 
million. 

97. 
Total new IDA credits are expected to amount to roughly US$148 million, including 18 
million designated for regional projects28.  The proposed CPS lending program indicates that the IDA 
resources will be allocated to five or six investment operations, including an irrigation project, a regional 
inland waterway project (Sava River), a follow-up land administration project, and a small operation to 
support BH's participation in a regional catastrophe risk insurance program (CRIF).  Each of these 
operations represents continuity with the previous CPS since the delivery of these operations was delayed 
to respond to the global economic and financial crisis with the first DPO and the line of credit for SMEs.  

28 Actual allocations will depend on:  (i) the country’s own performance; (ii) its performance relative to that of other 
IDA recipients; (iii) the amount of overall resources available to IDA; (iv) changes in the list of active IDA-
eligible countries; (v) terms of financial assistance provided (grants or loans); and (vi) the amount of 
compensatory resources received for MDRI. 

35 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                            
Preliminary discussions with the authorities have also identified interest in municipal development, 
forestry, energy/energy efficiency, health sector computerization, corporate restructuring of voucher 
privatized companies, and regional flood control for the latter period of the CPS.  Continued engagement 
ahead of the CPS Progress Report will determine which of these sectors to support, taking into 
consideration portfolio consolidation, its performance, and available resources. 

98. 
IBRD financing will also be highly selective.  At present, IBRD resources would be limited to 
policy lending to leverage reforms initiated under the previous CPS.  The current indicative lending plan, 
assuming an appropriate macroeconomic policy framework, is to prepare the second in the DPO series in 
late FY12 (US$100 million), to consolidate reforms in BH’s social benefits system and advance reforms 
in public wages and pensions.  Given the uncertainty in the political situation and macroeconomic 
framework, this schedule will remain highly flexible.  Consideration of the 3rd operation of the 
programmatic DPO series will depend on satisfactory country performance, particularly a sound 
macroeconomic framework, demands from other IBRD borrowers, and IBRD's lending capacity in BH.

*The 3rd DPO is presented here as the last in the programmatic series, but will depend on the availability of IBRD financing, along 
with sustained sound macroeconomic framework. 
**The Number of investment operations in FY14 and FY15 will be revisited in  the CPS Progress Report and will depend on the 
progress in consolidating the portfolio and client priorities.  Annex 3 describes the on-going and planned Trust Fund program that will 
complement above Bank financing 

99. 
Portfolio consolidation will not result in disengagement.  The Bank will support fewer but 
larger projects during this CPS.  This will free up internal Bank resources for timely analytical products.  
It will also free up staff time to help meet increasing demand from the EC and other partners for project 
implementation assistance from the Bank through IPA and donor financed trust funds.  

100. Trust Funds managed or implemented by the WBG total US$60 million and provide 
additional financing to support the CPS goals.  There are three GEF grants helping to improve water 
and sanitation in urban infrastructure, and enhancement of ecosystem protection.  As indicated in Box 4, 
the EC has approved EU IPA €23.6 million for Bank managed TFs in the environment and regional 
waterway transportation.  Among bilaterals, Sweden is a particularly important development partner, with

Trust Fund support in agriculture, business climate and water management. Recent TF programs, such as 
the ones agreed with the EC and SIDA, were designed to cover the WB costs to manage their 
implementation.  Future new TFs will also abide to this principle.  Several multi-donor TFs are 
supporting country specific and regional analytic work which will benefit BH in a number of areas:  (i) 
integrated development and management of water resources and hydropower in river basins; (ii) science, 
R&D and innovation; and (iii) accounting standards in the private and public sectors; (iv) public financial 
management; (v) Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility.  The work supported by these TFs will continue 
during the FY12-15 CPS period.  Details of each of the TFs and the amounts allocated are included in 
Annex 3. 

Box 4: A successful partnership - EC and the WB in BH and the Western Balkans 

The European Commission (EC) and the World Bank have been cooperating in BH for many years, most recently on 
the implementation of EU Instrument for Pre-Accession (IPA) grants in the environmental infrastructure sector. This 
has allowed the Bank to even better align its operations in BH to the EU agenda while expanding the scope and 
impact of Bank supported operations. For the EC, this cooperation offers the possibility of strengthening 
implementation of IPA funds in a complex environment, while benefitting from technical analysis and project 
management during design and implementation.  The EC and the National IPA Coordinator (NIPAC) approved EU 
IPA €22.6 million for TFs to be managed by the Bank, which provide co-financing resources for five investment 
operations supported by the Bank: Solid Waste Management - landfills in Banja Luka and Mostar; Water Quality 
Protection GEF - waste water treatment plant in Zivinice; Neretva and Trebisnjica GEF - sewerage system in 
Ljubuski; Sarajevo Waste Water Management; and Sava Navigability - feasibility studies and demining. 
Administrative agreements with the Bank will be signed in early FY12 (see Annex 3). Strong partnership with the 
EC will continue to be pursued in the area of water management and environment under this CPS.  

Further possibilities for cooperation between the EC, European IFIs and the Bank in the Western Balkans have been 
opened by the agreement in June 2011 to grant associate membership of the World Bank Group to the Western 
Balkans Investment Framework (WBIF).  The WBIF is a financing mechanism designed to pool grants, loans and 
expertise from the countries of the Western Balkans, the EC, IFIs and bilateral donors to prepare financing for a 
common pipeline of priority investment projects.  This framework provides for the possibility to allocate some of 
the funding to analytical, policy reform and sector strategy work as well as capacity building. This new type of 
project, called a "sector development project" would be complementary to the other types of support currently 
provided by the WBIF (mainly technical assistance and co-financing).  These grants would be linked to future 
investment plans and open possibilities to finance projects through the blending of grants and loans. Similarly, the 
policy based work and sector strategies funded in this way could also lay a solid foundation for sector based 
approaches to be implemented under national IPA envelopes, such as in BH, as well as to improve the overall 
policy, institutional and regulatory environment for all domestic and IFI investment projects. 

101. 
IFC expects to increase its financing to the private sector to a level of US$80-US$100 
million.  IFC seeks to improve the competitiveness of the country and contribute to its sustainable 
development through direct financing and advisory services in key sectors including financial sector, 
agribusiness and energy sectors.  Also, through its advisory services IFC will provide its support to 
improve country’s business environment.  IFC’s priorities are to: (i) support access to finance for SMEs 
through financial intermediaries and for the most vulnerable through microfinance institutions; (ii) 
continue to promote markets for energy efficiency and renewable energy; (iii) promote PPPs in 
infrastructure sectors; and (iii) provide advisory services to governments to improve the business enabling 
environment for SMEs and to help strengthen financial sector infrastructure.  

102. The current net exposure of the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) as of 
March 31, 2011, amounted to US$60.1 million in 9 projects.  The majority of these projects provide 
guarantees to support equity investments and shareholder loans from Western financial institutions into 
their local subsidiaries in Bosnia and Herzegovina.  One project involves a guarantee supporting the 
37 

 
 
 
 
 
 
establishment of a greenfield manufacturing facility for high-grade processed steel components for export 
to the automobile industry abroad. MIGA’s continuing support to these projects signals the Agency’s 
efforts to continue to underwrite projects in the country, encourage inward FDI despite the challenging 
business environment, and add to the World Bank Group’s strategy of encouraging private sector 
development by addressing real and perceived bottlenecks in the country’s operating environment. 

VI. RISKS 

103. The principal risk in BH is continued political fragmentation and stalemate. Based on the 
Bank’s previous experience with policy lending in BH, the risk of policy reversal is significant.  In 
particular, failure to advance with sensitive reforms in social assistance benefits agreed to under DPO I or 
an overall deterioration of the macroeconomic framework would lead to postponing or even cancelling 
DPOII.  In this case the Bank will consider reallocating the remaining IBRD resources (about US$50 
million) to investment operations.  Moreover, should completion of the reform of the social benefits 
system languish, fulfillment of expected outcomes in competitiveness and social inclusion would also be 
put at risk.  It would undermine progress toward gains in fiscal stability and stall reductions in the labor 
tax wedge; and, most important, the goal of targeting scarce resources to the truly poor will be once again 
postponed.  To help mitigate this risk, the Bank will engage in policy reforms under the DPO series only 
if there is demonstrated political willingness to undertake them.  Technical assistance on benefit targeting 
is underway, and social inclusion is fully integrated into the Government’s dialogue with the IMF.  
Finally, specifically related to Bank resources, the Bank is ready to reallocate the original amount of 
IBRD financing remaining from the FY08-FY11 CPS to high impact investment operations.  The Bank 
will help mitigate the negative impact of a prolonged political stalemate to the operations through: strong 
partnership with the EC, in primis, the IFIs, and other development partners, and by adhering to the 
principle of the single economic space. 

104. 
Prolonged volatility and slow growth in the euro zone and neighboring countries may 
undermine BH’s economic recovery.  In light of the concentration of BH’ trade with Europe and 
neighboring countries, the implications of slow growth in these regions or of a deepening of the sovereign 
debt crisis in the Euro zone, may be great for the BH  economy and put pressure on the currency board 
arrangement.  While the mitigation of these risks is largely beyond the scope of this CPS, the Bank 
remains focused on monitoring the evolution of the crisis in Europe and in the ECA region to provide 
timely advice on the implications for the BH economy.  Additionally, the CPS program is focused on 
removing some of the bottlenecks to competitiveness and productivity and on creating an effective and 
affordable safety net.   

105. Third, extreme weather events and growing variability in rainfall and temperature are 
already affecting the ECA region, and BH is among the most severely affected countries in the 
region.  Intensifying flooding and drought could undermine growth in a number of critical areas to BH’s 
development, including agriculture, forestry and hydro-power.  Planned operations in irrigation, regional 
flood control and catastrophe risk mitigation should help BH prepare for these potential challenges.

Lack of institutional capacity 
and coordinated policy 
interventions limit productivity 
and undermine the achievement 
of country’s full export potential 
in agribusiness, particularly 
towards the EU.  The on-going 
Agriculture and Rural 
Development Project aims 
precisely to strengthen 
institutional capacity for 
agriculture and rural 
development.  Furthermore, the 
strengthening of agricultural 
production will be supported 
with new investments in 
irrigation systems. 
Various on-going and planned 
operations under the new CPS 
will support the country goal of 
further developing transport 
infrastructure.   BH participation 
in the development  of a regional 
energy market in South Eastern 
Europe is being supported under 
the ECSEE APL3 operation, 
while the reduction of roads 
users costs and the improvement 
of road safety are pursued 
through the on-going Road

Project.  Expanding the Sava 
river potential for commercial 
use is going to be supported by 
the planned regional Sava River 
Navigability Project (FY12) 
prepared with the support of a 
EU grant TF. Development of 
the renewable energy sector in 
BH has been supported by the 
IFC.

Pillar II - Inclusion: Improve the delivery of public services for the vulnerable and the targeting and fiscal sustainability of social benefits to the poor 

Improve social inclusion, 
access to basic services, 
increase participation of 
inactive, discouraged 
population and their re-
integration in social life, 
labour market, and 
equalisation of 
opportunities for work.  

 

Six specific strategic sub-
goals include: 
 
Social policy 
aimed at 
employment; 
Improve position 
of families with 
children;  
Improve 
education;  
Improve health 
protection;  
Improve pension 
policy; and 
Improve position 
of persons with 
disabilities. 

 

 

 

 

Social inclusion is the sixth 
strategic goal outlined in the 
CDS, and the main theme of a 
separate Social Inclusion 
Strategy.  This goal will be 
primarily supported under the 
three year programmatic DPO 
series. DPO I, which was 
approved and disbursed in 2010, 
helped develop a legal 
framework necessary to improve 
targeting of non-insurance based 
cash transfers (both veteran and 
civilian categories). DPO II 
(FY12) will continue to support 
development of effective, 
efficient and equitable social 
protection policies. In addition 
to this, the DPO II will likely 
support pension reforms.  A 
third phase of the DPO program 
will continue to focus on 
improving the safety nets, 
facilitating pension and public 
wage reforms.  By improving 
targeting of cash transfers – thus  
generating some fiscal space - 
the DPO program will also 
contribute to the first strategic 
goal of the CDS - 
macroeconomic stability.  
Simultaneously, the on-going 
Social Safety Net and 
Employment Support Project 
will provide technical assistance 
to strengthen institutional 
capacity for implementation of 
effective social protection 
policies.    
With recently approved 

Increased share of social benefits 
reach the poorest. Fiscal savings 
resulting from reforms of cash 
transfers equal 1.8% of GDP . 
More effective job brokerage 
services extended to the vulnerable 
active job-seekers.  
Baseline (2011):t will be established 
with the 2011 Extended Household 
Based Survey. Job-brokerage 
services extended to 1,468 
vulnerable active job-seekers. Legal 
framework in place for 
implementation of means/income 
testing for non-insurance cash 
transfers. Bylaws regulating 
means/income thresholds need to be 
adopted.  
Target (2014): Improved targeting 
accuracy by 25%. Job-brokerage 
services extended to 10,000 
vulnerable active job-seekers, 35% 
are employed one year after 
receiving the services. Mean/income 
testing underway for selected 
vulnerable categories. Fiscal savings 
equal 1.8% of GDP.  
Reduced incidence of non-
communicable diseases through 
increased access to quality family 
medicine primary health care. 
Baseline (2010): about 58% of 
population covered through family 
medicine (FBH: 1,000,000; RS

and Mostar sanitary landfills, 
and  will expand the scope 
and impact of the WB 
financed project.  SIDA 
financing – focusing on 
collection – will complement 
WB financed activities in 
waste management. 

Pillar III - Environmental Sustainability: Ensure a sustainable use of natural resources, such as water and forestry, which are key to economic growth in BH, 
and adapt to climate change. Promote the sustainable development of basic municipal services  

Promote sustainable 
development through, inter 
alia, supporting measures for 
environmental and 
biodiversity protection, and 
sustainable use of natural 
resources.  

The CPS program will 
contribute to promoting the 
concept of “sustainable 
municipalities”, mainly 
through investments waste-
water management.  This 
strategy is co-financed by the 
EC and SIDA. The World 
Bank will also continue to 
assist BH to conserve its 
globally significant 
biodiversity in critical forests 
and mountain ecosystems.  
Depending on available 
financing – the CPS will 
support sustainable forestry in 
BH.  Through these activities, 
the CPS program will help the 
country meet the EU 
requirements for water quality 
and biodiversity policy.  
Finally, the Bank will explore 
possibility of mobilizing GEF 
grant resources to strengthen

Annex 2: FY08 – FY11 CPS COMPLETION REPORT 
This report is a self-evaluation by the World Bank of the experience in implementing the FY08 – FY11 
Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BH).  The main purpose of this report is 
threefold:  

i) assess progress towards achieving country goals and in that light examine the development 
outcomes and overall performance of the CPS program;   
ii) assess the performance of the World Bank in delivering the CPS program; and  
iii) derive lessons from the implementation of the CPS program that will be taken into consideration 
for the design and implementation of the new CPS for the period FY12 - FY15.  

I. 

SUMMARY OF FINDINGS 

1. 

Overall, the CPS program achieved expected outcomes in both core and non-core areas.  
The CPS program and consequently its expected outcomes were divided into “core” and “non-core” 
program areas. Core program areas were related to sectors in which there was strong demand for 
investments along with clear commitment for reforms by the authorities, while the non-core program 
referred to reform areas where political commitment needed to be verified prior to engagement. Under the 
core program, all major outcomes were either fully or partially achieved. In particular, all core program 
indicators were fully achieved in Pillar II of the CPS which aimed at improving the quality of public 
spending and the delivery of public services for the vulnerable. Progress was also made in non-core 
program areas where three out of four non-core program goals were partially achieved. An indicator 
related to Sava river navigability was dropped as the project, which would lead to that particular outcome, 
was postponed to the next CPS.  An increase in formal employment was the only outcome which was not 
achieved. In spite of the progress made during the first two years of the CPS program implementation, 
performance in this area was severely affected by the economic crisis,   

2. 

World Bank performance in delivering the CPS program has been satisfactory. Based on the 
lessons learned from the implementation of the previous Country Assistance Strategy FY05 - FY07, the 
World Bank followed the principles of result orientation, flexibility, and partnership in delivering the 
program. In particular, the World Bank demonstrated flexibility in adjusting its lending program in 
response to the impact of the global economic crisis.  Given the rapidly changing economic environment, 
the BH authorities and the World Bank pursued an urgent reprogramming of the CPS program to help 
mitigate the impact of the crisis with focus on maintaining macroeconomic stability, protecting the 
vulnerable through improved targeting of social benefits, and mitigating the effects on the real economy, 
and small and medium enterprises in particular.  Consistent with these priorities, in FY10 the World Bank 
approved four projects for a total amount of US$231 million, a record amount since the period of post-
conflict reconstruction. 

3. 

Key lessons and recommendations for the new CPS can be summarized as follows:  

 The World Bank can support structural reforms in BH’s politically complex environment, but 
a long-term commitment is needed.  
 Policy dialogue in key areas should be maintained even in the absence of lending, as it 
provides valuable input and forms a basis for future policy making. 
 Build consensus around institutional arrangements to be pursued under the project during the 
project preparation.

FY08‐FY11 CPS Completion Report 

 Maintain flexibility in allocation of resources.  
 Results are possible even in the politically tensed environment when interventions are aligned 
with investment priorities of the government.  
 Reinforce operational cooperation with development partners, IFIs, and the EC in particular.     

II. 

PROGRESS TOWARDS ACHIEVING COUNTRY GOALS 

4. 

In the absence of the formal Country Development Strategy, the declaration entitled 
“Platform for Action” from October 2007, which outlined key reform areas that governments at all 
levels in BH will pursue, served as the basis for the CPS design.  A new Country Development 
Strategy for the period 2008 - 2013, was still under preparation at the time when the CPS was agreed.  
The Platform for Action outlined the commitment by the authorities to take collective and coordinated 
action in the following three areas: i) improve fiscal coordination and stability; ii) create a more 
conducive business environment; and iii) promote other reforms that ensure sustainable 
development.  

Improving Fiscal Coordination and Stability 

5. 

Satisfactory progress was made in terms of improving fiscal coordination and stability. The 
state level Law on Fiscal Council was adopted in 2008 and the BH Fiscal Council was subsequently 
established.  The Fiscal Council was the key forum for discussion related to  the IMF Stand-by 
Arrangement in the amount of about EUR 1.1 billion (600 percent of the quota) which was approved in 
July 2009.  The Fiscal Council agreed to an overall fiscal envelope for 2009 and 2010, which was an 
explicit condition under the IMF’s Stand-by Agreement.  The World Bank was not directly involved in 
activities related to establishment and performance of the Fiscal Council.  

6. 

Entity governments launched structural reform of the social protection schemes. Reviewing 
and streamlining the social spending scheme with a view to improving its effectiveness was an explicit 
objective in this area of the Platform for Action. Recognizing that the system of social protection in BH 
was poorly targeted, inequitable, and fiscally unsustainable, entity authorities partnered with the World 
Bank in designing a reform program that would improve targeting of social benefits and ensure provision 
of services to the most vulnerable on a sustainable basis. A policy matrix developed for the First Public 
Expenditure Development Policy Operation (DPO I) contained a set of policy measures that initiated the 
process of structural reforms in the area of social protection.  Legislative changes that were adopted in 
late 2009 in the RS and early 2010 in the FBH as a part of the DPO I supported policy reforms, were 
possibly the most significant structural reforms pursued in BH over the last five years.  

7. 

The economic crisis halted any promise of BH reducing public expenditure as a share of 
GDP.   Due to the impact of the global economic crisis, GDP in BH was reduced for the first time since 
the war.  At the same time, governments in BH tried to maintain the same level of expenditures during the 
crisis.  Consequently, the public expenditure increased from 49.5 percent of GDP in 2008 to 50.4 percent 
of GDP in 2010.  Simultaneously, there was a drop in public revenues from 46 percent of GDP in 2008 to 
45 percent of GDP in 2010. Resulting fiscal deficit was partially closed by the IMF stand-by arrangement 
and the World Bank’s DPO I.

Creating a Better Business Environment 

8. 

Modest progress was made in improving the business climate in spite of significant progress 
in property registration. While progress was made in simplifying business registration, starting a 
business is still slow and complex. The World Bank’s Doing Business 2011 report ranks BH at 110th 
place.  BH is the second lowest ranked economy in South East Europe, and only Kosovo is ranked lower 
at 118th place.  However, progress was observed in terms of property registration.   The time it takes to 
register property has been reduced from 84 days in 2009 to 33 days in 2010.  Doing Business 2011 
recognized this progress and BH moved from 139th to 103rd place in terms of registering property 
indicator.  While the Bank correctly recognized that there was little commitment to pursue reforms in the 
area of business environment (“non-core” program), there were positive outcomes in this area where there 
was substantial Bank engagement, particularly through the Land Registration Project.   
Promoting sustainable development 

9. 

Accelerated implementation of investment projects lead to satisfactory outcomes in the 
transport and energy sector, while the development of competitive agriculture was only partially 
achieved. Sustained and coordinated efforts by IFIs (EBRD, EIB and the World Bank) resulted in 
substantially improved road maintenance, and an increasing level of investments in new road sections. 
Overall, IFIs (EBRD, EIB, and the World Bank) approved about EUR 848 million for investments in the 
transport sector over the last 5 years, and EUR 336 million was disbursed mainly for road rehabilitation 
during the period 2009-2010. In the energy sector, export of power reached record levels in 2009, and the 
three power management companies maintained strong performance both in terms of profitability and in 
terms of quality of services over the last four years. However, in the agriculture sector absence of political 
agreement about the role of different levels of government has prevented coordinated action to improve 
competitiveness of the sector.  

III. DEVELOPMENT OUTCOMES AND PERFORMANCE OF THE CPS PROGRAM 

10. 

The CPS program was well aligned with the priorities outlined in the Platform for Action. 
Pillar I of the CPS aimed at improving the environment for private sector led growth and convergence to 
the EU. Activities under Pillar I responded to two sets of priorities outlined in the Platform for Action: i) 
create a better business environment; and ii) promote reforms that ensure sustainable economic 
development. Pillar II which focused on the quality of public spending and the delivery of public services 
for the vulnerable, responded to the Platform for Action goal of improving stability and fiscal 
coordination by, inter alia, reviewing and streamlining social spending schemes with a view to improve 
their effectiveness.   

11. 

Overall, the CPS program achieved projected development outcomes in “core” program 
areas, while projects outcomes in “non-core” areas were partially achieved. As mentioned earlier, the 
CPS program and its outcomes were divided into “core” and ”non-core” program areas, whereby core 
areas were related to sectors with strong demand for investments along with clear commitment by the 
authorities, while non-core areas were characterized by less clear political commitment to reforms. In 
particular, projected outcomes in the core program areas such as land registration, electricity generation, 
water supply and sanitation, primary health care, and small scale agriculture, were fully achieved. CPS 
outcomes were partially achieved in other core program areas such as business registration, agricultural 
policy, energy market integration, and protected areas. Outcomes were also partially achieved in all non-
core areas except in the case of non-core indicator related to an increase in formal employment. This goal 
was not achieved due to the economic crisis.  A summary of the CPS outcomes is schematically shown in

Internal and external factors affecting CPS program performance 

12. 

BH’s complex and fragmented governance structure and political polarization between the 
key political parties undermined the advancement of a single economic space. As recognized in the 
CPS document, heightened political tensions in the BH’s complex governance structure represented the 
main risks for the policies aimed at strengthening the single economic space, and coordinated 
implementation of economic reforms. Project activities that required a degree of political consensus about 
the role of different levels of government were negatively affected (for example Agriculture and Rural 
Development Project -ARDP- see para 17 below).  

13. 

In spite of the unfavorable political environment, the necessity to respond to the impact of 
the global economic crisis provided strong incentive to initiate reforms.  BH authorities and the 
World Bank recognized that an effective response to the crisis would require macroeconomic stability, 
adequate protection of the most vulnerable, and acceleration of investments. In this context, satisfactory 
results were achieved even in the politically complex environment. Macroeconomic stability was 
maintained, reforms were initiated to improve targeting of social benefits to the vulnerable, and 
implementation of investment projects was significantly accelerated.

Pillar I: Improving the environment for private sector led growth  

14. 

Substantial results were achieved in reducing business registration in courts. The time 
needed for courts to process business registration fell from 17 days in 2007 to 6 days in 2010 in the RS, 
and from 23.7 to 10.4 days in the FBH.  The Business Enabling Environment Structural Adjustment 
Credit, which closed in December 2007, contributed to achievement of these results.  However, progress 
in court registration was not followed by streamlining in other areas of business registration.  Thus, in 
spite of recent progress particularly in the RS, business registration in BH remains complex. As indicated 
in Doing Business 2011, business registration takes on average 55 days and involves 12 procedures. The 
World Bank delivered a Doing Business Reform Memorandum in 2008 outlining actions to improve the 
overall business environment. After successful streamlining of business regulations including business 
registration in the RS, the IFC currently supports a “guillotine” initiative in the FBH in an effort to reduce 
excessive business rules and procedures. 

15. 

Registration of property has been streamlined, and the backlog of cases has been reduced.  
The time required to register property has been reduced from 84 days in 2009 to 33 in 2010. A substantial 
backlog of property registration cases (80,000 in 2006) was significantly reduced to 18,305 in November 
2010.  As mentioned above, the Doing Business 2011 report recognized this progress and BH has moved 
from 139th to 103rd place in terms of the registering property indicator.  The World Bank has supported 
reforms in this area through the Land Registration Project.  Design of this operation has proven to be 
sound; and it envisaged the need for a follow-up operation, which will be considered in the new CPS. 
Design of a follow-up project should inter alia include a communications campaign to raise public 
awareness of women’s legal rights, and develop an IT system to collect and monitor data by gender. 
Namely, recent analysis showed that while women’s legal rights are formally protected, tradition 
frequently favors male inheritance of property so that women waive their inheritance of land in favor of 
male family members 

16. 

The Investment Climate Assessment (ICA) found that the private enterprise sector in BH 
has been on an upswing but its full potential remains constrained.   The ICA report, which was 
delivered in June 2008, identified the main obstacles for private sector development, and recommended 
actions that should be considered in the enterprise sector, business environment, and corporate 
restructuring if private sector-led growth is to become a significant influence in the expansion of the BH 
economy.    

17. 

Lack of political consensus affected EU related reforms in the agriculture sector. Activities 
related to building the institutional capacity and agricultural information systems are progressing well, 
while the activities related to establishing the EU compatible payment system remain behind schedule due 
to the lack of agreement as to the role and authority distribution between the various levels of 
government. Acknowledging that such an agreement is unlikely to be reached over the short-term, the 
World Bank is currently restructuring the ARDP to reallocate resources to well performing components, 
and in response to the flooding crisis in late 2010 in BH which had severely negative effects on farmers in 
affected areas.   

18. 

Investments in the transport and energy sector led to satisfactory outcomes.  The Road 
Infrastructure and Safety Project made strong progress against the target of rehabilitating 240km of roads.  
The intermediate outcome indicator of 120 km of road rehabilitation in each entity has already been met 
in the RS, while 89% completed in the FBH.  It is expected that outcomes related to road safety and 
reduction in road user costs will be achieved by the end of the project.  In the energy sector, continued 

50 

 
 
 
 
 
 
FY08‐FY11 CPS Completion Report 

support of the World Bank (currently ECSEE APL3 is under implementation), and other development 
partners has contributed to achieving record levels of power generation in 2009. The alignment of 
investments with the priorities of the Entity governments and the implementing agencies led to successful 
outcomes.  Export of power by BH helped alleviate shortages in the region, deepen integration of regional 
electricity market, and was commercially attractive for BH power utilities. Convergence of national and 
regional interests helped strengthen regional power trade and is the building block of regional market 
development in the early stages. These results were partially offset by the failure to promote integration of 
the power sector into the regional market due to disputes on the functioning of the national transmission 
company (TRANSCO).  

19. 

IFC financing was well distributed to support SMEs, microfinance, banks, and medium size 
local companies. IFC's strategy was to actively support the restructuring and modernization of local 
companies in BH, to improve their competitiveness, encourage broader intra-regional collaboration and 
provide financing to local and regional investors with focus on export-oriented companies. For example, 
IFC financing for CIMOS company helped to revive the automotive industry in BH, and has contributed 
to about 1,000 jobs. In addition, the project helped the company to develop management and technical 
skills, transfer knowledge, improve productivity, and promote efficient use of raw materials and labor, 
which in turn helped to strengthen the competitiveness of the domestic automotive industry in the 
country. IFC supported micro-entrepreneurs and SMEs through credit lines to two local banks as well as 
through its financing to two microfinance institutions. Financing to MFIs “EKI” contributed to 
disbursement of 84,000 new loans during 2009-2011, increased loan portfolio financing for women to 
US$80.0 million by the end of 2011 from US$47.0 million as of December 31, 2007, and is expected to 
reach an estimated 5,000 new micro-entrepreneurs during the life of the loan. IFC loan to MFI “MI-
Bospo” will help reach an estimated 3,000 new micro-entrepreneurs. 

20. 

Partially satisfactory outcomes were achieved in protecting the critical forests and 
mountain areas, while the objective of strengthening capacity to respond to avian influenza and 
other similar outbreaks was fully accomplished.  Although the total area under formal protection 
increased from 0.55% in 2007 to 2.1% in 2010, delays in formation of Una national park affected overall 
progress against the target of 3% of protected areas by 2010.  The perceived reduced risk of avian 
influenza outbreak has reduced demand to adhere to strict and safe poultry handling procedures.  
Nevertheless, it is estimated that 50% of the at-risk population practice safe handling procedures. 

21. 

Privatization and corporate restructuring made only moderate headway. Only six strategic 
enterprises were privatized during the period of the CPS implementation (2 in the FBH and 4 in the RS). 
Commitment to privatization remains elusive, particularly in the FBH, as privatization goals did not 
feature prominently in the programs of political parties in the campaign for October 2010 general 
elections.  The World Bank correctly decided to extend limited support in these “non-core” areas through 
the EC financed Trust Fund for corporate restructuring and through non-lending services such as the 2008 
ICA.  Companies which adopted recommendations provided under the EC Trust Fund improved their 
operations and profitability in 2010. After a successful Turkish company privatized a soda ash plant, one 
of the largest employers in Tuzla area, IFC supported its turnaround and increased competitiveness 
through economies of scale. Through its investment IFC contributed to help alleviate the adverse effects 
of the global financial crisis on BiH and sent an encouraging signal to other foreign investors in the 
region.

Pillar II: Improving the quality of public spending and the delivery of public services for the 
vulnerable 

22. 

All core program outcomes under Pillar II were achieved. World Bank supported programs 
were successful in improving local infrastructure, enhancing primary health care, and extending support 
for small scale agriculture in less developed areas.   

23. 

Results were particularly noteworthy in improving local infrastructure and services.  The 
Urban Infrastructure and Services Delivery Project helped reduce water losses in all participating 
municipalities and extend 24h water supply to some 300,000 inhabitants for the first time. Under the 
Solid Waste Management Project the Bank supported six regional sanitary landfills that are now fully 
functional.  The number of wild dumpsites was reduced by 15%.  The Second Solid Waste Management 
Project, which is currently under implementation, will expand the number of regional landfills and 
improve their effectiveness.  

24. 

The Health Sector Enhancement Project was successful in promoting the family medicine 
model of primary health care.  Targets related to utilization of family medicine in primary health care 
were exceeded in the FBH, and fully achieved in the RS.  Most importantly, the percentage of the 
population registered with family medicine teams increased from 5% before the project started, to about 
58% of the population in early 2011.  Additional financing in the amount of US$10 million approved in 
Q3 FY11 will build on this successful implementation and further expand the coverage of the family 
medicine model of primary health care to 70% of the population.  

25. 

The IFC support for the BH Heart Center in Tuzla has increased access to essential 
cardiovascular services. The Center was the first private hospital and thus has helped establish quality 
benchmarks for the delivery of private health services.  Also, the project is an example of successful 
public-private partnership in demonstrating the viability of public financing of privately provided 
services. The Center is expected to reach 4,500 in-patients and 20,000 outpatients per year by 2012  

26. 

Reforms were initiated in the non-core program area of improving targeting of social 
benefits. Continued policy dialogue underpinned by the Bank’s analytic work (Social Transfers in BH: 
Moving Toward a More Sustainable and Better-Targeted Safety Net), laid the groundwork for the reform 
of the system of non-insurance based cash transfers.  In late 2009 and early 2010, as a part of the reform 
agenda agreed under the DPO I, the entities adopted legislation that should substantially improve the 
targeting of non-insurance based cash benefits. In addition to this, the Social Safety Net and Employment 
Support Project was designed to provide technical support for implementation of reforms of the social 
protection system, and extend job-brokerage services to vulnerable active job seekers.  However, 
legislation remains pending to introduce the principle of means testing for all non-insurance based cash-
transfers except for war veterans with a disability of 60% and above. Newly elected governments are 
facing significant pressure by interest groups to maintain the current levels of spending with no 
improvements in targeting.  At the same time, Entity governments need further budget support and a 
follow up DPO II will be considered in the new CPS. In this context, prior to embarking on a new set of 
reforms that would be supported under the DPO II, the World Bank and the Entity governments will 
ensure that there was no backtracking and that there continues to be satisfactory progress in implementing 
the DPO I reforms.

IV. WORLD BANK PERFORMANCE 

27. 

Overall, the World Bank performance in delivering and implementing the CPS program 
was satisfactory.  The Bank delivered the program that was aligned with the country priorities, 
realistically achievable, and which incorporated principles of flexibility, partnership and results 
orientation based on lessons learned from the earlier programs. The two pillars of the CPS were consistent 
with government priorities, and aimed to accelerate the country’s progress toward the EU membership. 

28. 

The Bank made the right decision to attune its program to a “Platform for Action”.  In the 
absence of a formal country development strategy, the Platform for Action represented the minimum 
common denominator of development priorities jointly pursued by all levels of government in BH.  The 
fact that the new Country Development Strategy has still not been adopted by all levels of government 
suggests a shortcoming in commitment among different levels of government in BH to jointly address key 
development priorities.  Tensions surrounding the constitutional reform process created an environment 
whereby development programs and even the process of EU integration were treated as less important by 
the key policy makers.  In such an environment, the Bank acted pragmatically, aligning its program 
behind the single available platform that aimed at accelerating the implementation of urgent reforms to 
attract investment, accelerate job creation and improve overall living standards in the country.   

29. 

The Bank demonstrated responsiveness in allocating resources based on the strong demand 
and commitment, and flexibility to adjust the lending program in response to the economic crisis. 
During the first phase of CPS implementation (FY08-FY09) the Bank approved projects in the “core” 
areas of transport, local infrastructure and environmental protection for which there was a strong demand 
and commitment for reforms by the authorities. During the second phase (FY10-FY11), the Bank and the 
BH authorities agreed that the rapidly changing economic environment required urgent reprogramming of 
certain planned investment operations and careful consideration of the DPOs. Consequently, the Bank’s 
lending program for 2010 included support for the country’s budgets under stress by the drop of revenues 
caused by the global economic slow-down, through the Public Expenditure DPO I (US$111 million), and 
a line of credit to enhance access to finance for small and medium enterprises (US$70 million).  This also 
meant that the Sava River Navigability Project that was originally scheduled for this CPS period had to be 
postponed to the next CPS cycle. 

30. 

IFC maintained satisfactory performance combining its investment operations with advisory 
services to improve access to finance and competitiveness of micro-entrepreneurs and SMEs, develop 
trade finance to help trade flows during the global financial crisis, and to explore opportunities for public 
private partnership (PPP) projects. IFC currently has 9 projects in its BH portfolio, with total commitment 
of US$ 128.4 million.  Projects in the financial sectors represent 35%, general manufacturing 61%, and 
health 4% of the IFC portfolio 

31. 

The delivered lending program was in line with maximum planned lending.  A total of nine 
operations, eight investment projects and one DPO, were delivered during the CPS period (see Table 1). 
Maximum planned lending was US$317 million, and the total amount approved over the CPS period was 
US$315.4 million of which IDA credits - US$131, IBRD loans - US$175 million, and GEF grants - 
US$9.4 million.  IFC committed over US$76 million for six projects (3 in the financial sector, 1 in health, 
and 2 in chemicals).

Over the 
last year there has been significant progress 
in accelerating project 
implementation and reducing effectiveness delays.  In the period 2006-2009 it took on average 10-12 
months for projects to become effective upon Board approval. Consequently, many projects were affected 
in the initial stages of implementation, which led to suboptimal outcomes. In 2010, this processing time 
was reduced to 6.7 months on average.  Further reducing the time required for project effectiveness to 6 
months is the target agreed with counterparts from all project teams and the ministries of finance. It is 
expected that elimination of effectiveness delays will greatly accelerate implementation and achievement 
of development outcomes.   

33. 

Strong disbursement performance.  The disbursement ratio in FY10 was 25.9% which was the 
best result of all Southeast European Countries (ECCU4) and among the best in the ECA region.  The 
current disbursement ratio (June 2011) of 24.5% means that strong disbursement performance was 
maintained in FY11 (see Figure 2 below). The main reasons behind the strong recent disbursement 
performance are a mix of internal and external factors including: i) the urge to accelerate implementation 
in response to the economic crisis and political cycle (general elections in 2010); ii) maturity of larger 
projects in the portfolio (for example: Road Infrastructure and Safety, ECSEE APL3, and Solid Waste 
Management I); and iii) the project design attuned to the domestic priorities and implementation capacity.

As of June 2011, the active portfolio consisted of 14 projects, with total commitments of US$ 
332.3 million, of which about US$200 million remains available for disbursement.  The current 
portfolio is healthy.  The amount of commitment at risks, a measure of the likelihood that projects will 
not meet their stated development objectives on time, represents 6.3% of the portfolio which compared 
favorably with ECCU4 (8.7%) and ECA averages (12%).  Only one project is currently considered to be 
at risk.  Implementation progress for ARDP is rated as moderately unsatisfactory and the project 
restructuring is pursued to address identified weaknesses.  Implementation progress of all other projects is 
rated moderately satisfactory to satisfactory (see Figure 2 below).  

35. 

Analytical and Advisory Activities provided strong input for the policy dialogue, and helped 
the authorities develop responses to the economic crisis.  The analytical work delivered during the 
period of the CPS implementation was aligned with the country demand and economic concerns.  A 
Policy Note on Social Assistance Transfers in BH (FY09), and Poverty update (FY10) provided analytical 
underpinning for the reforms of the social protection system that were initiated in late 2009 and early 
2010.  An Investment Climate Assessment (FY08) responded to the need to analyze performance and 
structural constraints in the enterprise sector and provide recommendations on how to address identifies 
challenges.  A Transport Sector Review (FY10) provided a framework for future development planning in 
the transport sector. Finally, a series of policy notes on competitiveness, which jointly present the 
Country Economic Memorandum for BH, informed the policy dialogue about the relevant aspects of 
competitiveness.  These Policy Notes and the policy dialogue generated during and after their 
presentation contributed to the design of the new CPS.

IFC advisory services in BH focused on four business lines: i) sustainable business advisory- 
with programs on corporate governance, renewable energy, integrated solid waste management and 
international standards and technical regulations and Balkan hotel market access; ii) investment climate- 
with programs on alternative dispute resolution, and sub-national competitiveness (investment generation 
as a part of sub-national competitiveness); iii) access to finance-with programs on micro-finance; and iv) 
infrastructure-promoting private sector participation (PSP) in all infrastructure sub-sectors. 

Highlights of the results achieved through IFC advisory services include: 

 BH’s first initial public offering of a private company with the listing of Fratello Trade at the Banja 
Luka Stock Exchange.  
 Corporate governance codes and corresponding scorecards for the Sarajevo and Banja Luka Stock 
Exchanges.  
 Working with the University in Sarajevo IFC helped to set up the first Masters program in Corporate 
Governance in the region with 127 postgraduate students being graduated so far.  
 Advisory services to 6 local SMEs helped them to get US$ 13 million in financing from the local 
banks and other investors, and US$2 million from IFC.  
IFC supported 6 local companies in construction materials and food processing sectors to implement 
international standards needed for export to international markets. Companies received US$2.4 
million in financing and increased their exports by US$15.6 million. 
Integrated solid waste management advisory services contributed to the finalization of a €7.5 million 
PPP investment into a biomass district heating plant in Gracanica. 
 Sub-national competitiveness project contributed to direct and indirect savings for businesses of 
more than US$54 million.  Out of about 1,400 administrative procedures more than 820 were 
improved, 90 procedures were changed, more than 1,700 businesses went through the reformed 
procedures, and about 900 people were trained.

V. 

LESSONS AND SUGGESTIONS FOR THE NEW CPS 

37. 

The World Bank can support structural reforms in BH’s politically complex environment, 
but a long-term commitment is needed. Bank support to structural reforms—e.g, business environment 
reform through the Business Enabling Environment Structural Adjustment Credit—suggests structural 
reforms in BH take time to implement, and desired outcomes may be achieved only in stages and over the 
medium term.  Thus, a longer-term commitment and a combination of financial and advisory services are 
needed to achieve long lasting results. 

38. 

Policy dialogue in key areas should be maintained even in the absence of lending, as it 
provides valuable input and forms a basis for future policy making. Despite failure to push forward 
much needed structural reforms in the area of social and veteran benefits, and cancellation of US$51 
million for the Second Social Sector Structural Adjustment Credit (SOSAC II) in 2006, the Bank 
continued policy dialogue in this sector. The dialogue culminated with the presentation of findings of 
2009 study on social benefits in BH which revealed that the system was inequitable, inefficient, and 
fiscally unsustainable. Continued policy dialogue and the Bank’s analytic work provided basis for the 
initiation of reforms that were supported under the DPO I. These reforms will have a greater chance of 
success since the BH authorities had access to the right mix of financial (DPO and SSNESP) and advisory 
services from the Bank.  It is still preferable in BH to continue to pursue a degree of reform though 
investment lending, and to rely on not overly complex or ambitious DPOs opportunistically, in line with 
domestic capacity, and in areas where there is clear commitment for reforms. At the same time, policy 
dialogue should be maintained in selected key areas where the Bank’s analytic work may serve as a basis 
for the future reforms.  

39. 

Build consensus about institutional arrangements to be pursued under the project during 
the project preparation. Institutional reforms envisaged under several projects designed during the 
previous CAS did not enjoy political support and implementation was consequently delayed. For 
example, under the ARDP, the activities related to establishing an EU compatible payment system are 
behind schedule due to the lack of agreement as to the role and authority distribution between the various 
levels of government. Furthermore, several projects have experienced delays at the beggining of the 
implementation since implementation arrangements are not firmly agreed (for example SSNESP in the 
RS did not start 4 months after effectiveness). In a politically complex environment such as BH, it is 
necessary to reach firm agreement about all aspects of institutional and implementation arrangements 
during the project preparation.    

40. Maintain flexibility in allocation of resources.  The Bank demonstrated much needed 
responsiveness and flexibility in adjusting its lending program in response to the impact of the global 
economic and financial crisis. Although flexibility may involve postponement of some operations, it 
should be maintained in the next CPS cycle as it allows the Bank to respond to emerging economic 
concerns by the Government.  

56 

 
 
 
 
FY08‐FY11 CPS Completion Report 

41. 

The Bank’s decision to divide the CPS program into “core” and “non-core” program areas 
has proven successful.  Such an approach allowed much needed flexibility to the Bank to simultaneously 
pursue investment lending in “core” areas while maintaining policy dialogue and opportunity for 
engagement in the “non-core” areas.  For example, when the opportunity emerged, the Bank played a lead 
role in helping the Governments achieve the objective of reviewing and streamlining social spending 
schemes with a view to improving their effectiveness.  

42. 

Results are possible even in the politically difficult environment when interventions are 
aligned with investment priorities of the government.  The Bank applied lessons learned from the 
previous CAS period (FY05-08) and fully aligned its portfolio to the investments priorities of the Entity 
governments. Whereas in the previous CAS, the portfolio included structural adjustment credits and 
associated TA projects for which there was little commitment, the structure of the portfolio during this 
CPS period mainly included investment operations for which there was high level of commitment and 
readiness to implementation. This principle should be maintained in the next CPS cycle. Furthermore, 
limited World Bank resources should be allocated more strategically. While some streamlining of the 
portfolio has been achieved, from 16 active projects worth US$300 million at the time of CPS approval to 
12 projects worth US$302.3 million at the end of the CPS cycle (June 30, 2011), greater selectivity will 
be needed in the new CPS, focusing on the fewer larger operations. Small stand-alone operations should 
be avoided. Additional financing and project restructuring should be considered in sectors where there is 
need to scale up operations or where new circumstances require a different approach. This will involve 
making some tough strategic choices and even exiting some sectors.  

43. 

The Bank should continue to strengthen partnerships with other development partners, 
International Financial Institutions (IMF, EBRD, EIB, CoEDB), and the European Commission 
(EC) in particular.  During implementation of the CPS program the Bank’s activities were harmonized 
with activities of other development partners.  The IMF has been the key partner in supporting reforms in 
the social sector as these reforms complemented the IMF’s stabilization program. Successful partnership 
was maintained with EBRD and EIB in the transport sector and energy sector, and with CoEDB in the 
health sector. Informal coordination among IFIs (EBRD, EIB, IMF, IFC, CoEDB, KfW) was initiated by 
the Bank. Cross cutting portfolio issues were examined and it was agreed that IFIs will make a joint 
presentation about the key issues affecting implementation of investment projects to the new State level 
government.  SIDA remains an important development partner in activities related to business climate, 
agriculture and local infrastructure.  Finally, given that support for the process of BH’s EU accession is 
likely to remain the key cross cutting theme in the new CPS, strategic partnership with the EC will be the 
key in maximizing the development outcomes.  In 2010, a new form of partnership was introduced 
between the EC and the Bank in BH with the EU approving EUR 22.6 million of IPA funds as co-
financing for five Bank financed investment operations in two sectors: transport, and environment (water 
management). Implementation of this co-financing arrangement will be an important guide for any future 
partnership with the EC.     

44. 

Synergy between the IBRD/IDA and the IFC should be further improved.  The CPS period 
was marked by satisfactory cooperation within the World Bank Group.  However, BH counterparts will 
benefit from a more fully integrated approach by the World Bank Group in pursuing country development 
goals. In this regard, the Result Matrix of the new CPS should reflect outcome indicators that will be 
achieved by all agencies of the World Bank Group (IDA/IBRD/IFC) and its main development partners.

CORE PROGRAM GOALS  
Reduction in the duration and 
number of procedures required 
to register a business. 
 Baseline:  June 2007: New 
Business Registration System 
(BRS) launched – Average 
registration time 54 days (DB) 
 Target: 30 days in the FBH, 
23 days in the RS (2008) 

Development of transparent land 
markets through registration of 
real  estate 
Baseline: 2006: 150,000 
registry folders completed in 
the automated database,  
80,000 backlog cases, several 
months to complete real estate 
transactions 
Target: 2 million folders 
completed, full reconciliation, 
no backlogs (2011) 

PARTIALLY ACHIEVED: Court 
registration improved but start up 
process is still slow. In 2010, all 16 
courts used the new business 
registration system; average court 
registration takes 6 days in the RS 
and 10.4 days in the FBH. Overall 
start up process takes 55 days in the 
FBH and 22 days in the RS. 

ACHIEVED: As of June 2011, 
1.45 million folders were 
completed. Backlog has been 
reduced to 18,305 and 80% of cases 
is now resolved in 5 working days 
in 16 Land Registration Offices (10 
in FBH and 6 in the RS). Current 
progress in implementation of the 
Land Registration Project provides 
assurance that the program goal 
will be fully achieved as planned by 
the end of 2011.  

Business Environment Structural 
Adjustment Credit (P071001 - 
BAC) - the credit was closed on 
December 15, 2007 after meeting the 
outcome based conditions related to 
business registration.  

Land Registration Project 
(P096200) - project closing on March 
31, 2012. The project document was 
clear and realistic about what could 
be achieved during the project 
implementation as well as what would 
be needed in the subsequent five year 
period. Thus, there was the big 
picture and specific achievable 
outcomes for a project. These 
estimates have turned out to be 
accurate and during the last year of 
the project the counterparts have been 
preparing the follow-up program for 
the next five years. 

Structural reforms take time in BH, and 
desired outcomes may be achieved only 
in stages and over the medium term 
(BAC implementation lasted 5 years, 
very unusual for a SAC). The main 
lesson from this and other attempts at 
structural reforms in BH, is that the 
country and its fragmented governance 
structure present unique challenges to 
building commitment for the reform 
agenda.  DPOs may be successfully used 
to pursue reforms in areas (currently not 
many) where the commitment to reform 
– and a certain level of consensus about 
the path to follow - is evident in both 
Entities and at the State level. Or where 
the external environment, be it a global 
economic crisis or the EU accession 
agenda, is creating the opportunity to 
build commitment where it was 
previously lacking.  Thus it is preferable 
in BH to continue to pursue a degree of 
reform though investment lending, and to 
rely on not overly complex or ambitious 
DPOs opportunistically, in line with 
domestic capacity, in areas where there 
is commitment for reforms.

Activities related to building the 
institutional capacity and agricultural 
information systems are progressing 
well. Activities related to establishing 
a EU compatible payment system 
remain behind schedule due to the 
lack of agreement as to the role and

FY08‐FY11 CPS Completion Report 

Lessons for the new CPS  

The ARDP was prepared at a time of 
optimism for BH moving towards 
building functional state systems 
including a State-level Ministry of 
Agriculture. However, resistances to 
centralized state structures were well 
apparent. Consequently, project 
preparation conservatively foresaw 
initial entitiy-level structures but with the 
ultimate aim of linking entity systems to 
an emerging functional State level 
system. However, during 
implementation, the main external 
stakeholders, incl. EC and SIDA, 
developed a position favoring a single 
Paying Agency at the state level. At mid-
term, the emerging lessons from this are: 
- the exclusive insistence on the 
establishment of a unified, state-level 
Paying Agency prevented progress 
towards the target of an EU-compatible 
payment system, which could also have 
been achieved though state-level 
coordination of entitiy-level program and 
payment structures; 
- the target of a EU-compliant payment 
structure was overly ambitious. A target 
of an EU-type payment structure would 
have offered more implementation 
choices towards an identical target.

lending far outweigh the Bank’s lending 
in this sector. These IFIs are expected to 
maintain or increase investments in road 
and railway infrastructure. Therefore, the 
Bank should consider focusing on other 
segments of the transport network to 
facilitate regional trade and cooperation 
(for example: Sava river navigability). 

Technical assistance for creation and 
institutional development of the

political disagreements between the two 
Entities, this component could achieve 
the targeted outcome only partially. State 
level policy and sector structure issues 
that require political resolution and close 
collaboration among the State and the 
Entities should not be included in 
investment projects but should be 
supported through technical assistance 
with the involvement of key donors. 

Flexibility was one of the three key 
operating principles of the CPS (other 
two being results, and partnerships). The 
Bank demonstrated flexibility in 2009 to 
adjust its lending program in response to 
the impact of the economic and financial 
crisis. Although this meant 
postponement of some operations (such 
as Sava River), flexibility principle 
should be maintained in the next CPS

FY08‐FY11 CPS Completion Report 

Lessons for the new CPS  

This project was designed in response to 
the threat of avian flu pandemia. 
Although the project has achieved its 
development objectives and has build 
institutional capacity to respond to 
pandemias, this relatively small 
operation (US$ 5 million) was overly 
complex in terms of implementation 
arrangements. In future, such small 
stand-alone operations should be 
avoided. Instead, additional financing for 
successful projects and proactive 
restructuring of less than satisfactory 
projects should be promptly pursued.    

Bank’s decision to divide the CPS 
program into “core” and “non-core” 
program areas was the right one. Prior to 
engagement in non-core program areas 
the Bank required strong signals of 
commitment for reforms by the 
authorities. Privatization was identified 
as important but still non-core area as 
government commitment was 
indefinable. Indeed, ambitious original 
plans in both entities were not followed 
by concrete actions (particularly in the 
FBH). Thus, the Bank’s engagement was 
limited and in the form of EC funded 
grant for enterprise restructuring. Given 
the lack of commitment by the 
authorities, stronger involvement by the

Improved delivery of water 
supply, sanitation and urban

Baseline: Water supply in 
five participating 
municipalities (92%, 0%, 
100%, 90%, 94%) (2004) 
Target: 100% in 4 large 
municipalities 

Administration of solid waste at 
municipal level improved  
Baseline: 2003: 1 regional 
(not sanitary) landfill 
operational,  numerous wild 
dumpsites 
Target:  Six regional sanitary 
landfills established and 
operational (2009); 20% 
reduction in wild dumpsites 

ACHIEVED: Current values for 
water supply in four target large 
municipalities are: Banja Luka - 
100%; Posusje - 100%; Cazin - 
100%; and Pale - 96%. By the end 
of the project (June 30,2011) the 
target will be fully achieved.  

ACHIEVED: Six regional sanitary 
landfills have been established and 
are now fully operational. The 
recent assessment suggests that 
15% reduction in the number of 
wild dumpsites was achieved. This 
result is somewhat below projected 
20% due to lack of counterpart 
financing for this activity. 
However, the achieved result is 
seen as satisfactory given the actual 
very high number of wild 
dumpsites.

global economic crisis made policy 
decisions to reform more urgent - 
commitment to reform was more evident. 
A DPO with realistic targets was 
designed in parallel with a capacity 
building operation (SSNESP) to support 
the reform efforts over the medium term.  
The main lesson is that important steps 
forward in reforms can be achieved also 
in a complex institutional environment 
such as the one in BH.  However the 
Bank needs to be already engaged with 
analytical work and country dialogue to 
be effective.  Also, reforms efforts in BH 
need to be supported over the medium 
term to build capacity and avoid policy 
reversals. 

PARTIALLY ACHIEVED: The 
state-level Fiscal Council Law was 
adopted in 2008 and the Fiscal 
Council (FC) was established. The 
FC agreed on the overall fiscal 
envelope for the state and the two 
entities for 2009 and 2010.  These 
were an integral part of the Stand-

have largely been observed. 
However, given the October 2010 
General Elections, the FC failed to 
adopt the overall fiscal envelope for 
2011 as this decision was 
postponed for the incoming 
governments.  

NOT ACHIEVED: Formal

Annex 4: Gender Assessment 

Comparisons of selected indicators for which data are available for BiH, the Western Balkans and  
the ECA region as a whole suggest that economic empowerment and political representation are 
two major areas where women achievements lag behind regional comparators (Table 1). In terms of 
labour market indicators, women’s performance partly reflects structural problems of the country (high 
unemployment and low activity rates for both men and women). The gap in labour market participation 
between women and men in Bosnia, however, is more marked than in ECA as a whole even if not as 
pronounced as for other countries in the Western Balkans.  Other indicators such as the gender gap in life 
expectancy suggest that women are at least on par with the region in terms of this summary indicator of 
life opportunity. In addition, fertility rates and the adolescent fertility rates suggest that women have 
significantly more control of their reproductive decisions than elsewhere in the region. 

In terms of political representation in Parliament, in 2007 (the year for which comparative data was 
available) it was lower than both the Western Balkans and ECA averages (14.3 percent) and declined 
even further in 2008 when women constituted 10.5 percent of the delegates in the Parliament of BiH (9.5 
percent of representatives in the House of Representatives of BiH and 13.3 percent in the House of 
Peoples of BiH).  A decline was also seen between 2004 and 2008 in the participation of women in the 
Council of Ministers in BiH – from 10 percent to zero in 2008 at the ministerial level. Representation at 
the level of deputy ministers stayed constant over the period (20 percent).30

Focusing on national data provides an opportunity to look more closely at other differences between 
women and men. Poverty data do not capture significant differences across genders given that these 
indicators are constructed on a household basis. Restricting the focus on female versus male headed

households shows that, as it is often the case, female headed households are not poorer than male headed 
ones.  

Looking at different access to factors of production shows however a more interesting story. As far as 
labour market performance is concerned, the LFS 2010 shows that the relative equality between men and 
women in terms of labour market participation is really the result of a low participation rates for both 
sexes (57 percent for men and 33 percent for women).31  Disaggregating by age cohort shows that the  age 
profile of the employment rate for women and men is quite similar so that, with the exception of workers 
65+ and older, women’s employment rate is always around 55-60 percent of men’s. Further, while 
unemployment rates of different age groups are quite similar across gender, for young workers (15-24) 
they are significantly higher for women than for men (68 percent vs. 59 percent). In line with these 
findings recent work by Hartgen and Klasen (2010) contrasting the levels of the unemployment rate as 
well as the ratio of the unemployment rate between men and women disaggregating by welfare group, 
area of residence and gender of the household head using MICS data concluded that “the critical gender 
issue in Bosnia appears to be linked to low labor force participation and high unemployment for women, 
particularly poorer women”. 

The quality of jobs held by women and men is also another important dimension of the gender 
disadvantage in Bosnia. Certainly there is a perception that “women suffer discrimination in the 
workplace - receiving lower salaries than men for the same type of work and earning promotions far less 
frequently”32. But also in terms of type of jobs that women can access in the first place there are 
differences between women and men. While roughly ¾ of women and men workers are employees, men 
are more likely to be in self-employment than women and almost none of them (against 11 percent of 
women) works in unpaid employment.  Looking more closely at segments of the labour markets which 
are typically sources of good jobs, such as the civil service and large firms, shows however that there is a 
lot of heterogeneity across women. In the civil service women’s representation appears to be almost equal 
to men’s (48 percent in 2008).33 Similarly, evidence from the Business Enterprise Surveys (BEEPS), 
shows that Bosnia does not lag behind the ECA average according to indicators typically used to assess 
the extent of female participation in large firms (firms with female participation in ownership, percentage 
of full time female workers), though it scores below average in terms of firms with female top manager.  
Gaps in education are important determinants of women’s performance in the labour market, as well as of 
the heterogeneity between different groups of women workers. While 59% of men of working age have 
completed secondary education, only 40 percent of women are in a similar position. For tertiary education 
the gaps are much more contained (9 versus 7.4 percent). Note however that while the unemployment rate 
of those with primary education exhibits a less than 1 percentage point gap, for secondary education it is 
much higher for women than for men (36 versus 29 percent). 

If differences in the labour market performance for men and women can be well documented, there is at 
least some evidence on differences in access to other factors of production. Analysis from the BEEPS 
2009 suggests significant differences in the perceived access to credit in firms depending on the gender of 
the owner and top management. The Bosnian data show a large gender gap in the percentage of firms 
which consider access to credit a serious obstacle (45 percent for firms where the top manager and the 

31 Note that these data result in a lower ratio of women to men participation rates than those reported in the WDI. the 
two are not directly comparable as the WDI indicators have been standardized for international comparisons, 
unlike the LFS 2010 ones.

owner are female versus 22 percent for male owned/managed firms) – this is the largest gap recorded for 
the Western Balkans (data available for all countries but Kosovo).  

Access to land is reported as a severe problem by fewer female managed and owned than male (5 percent 
report it as a severe problem, against 13 percent for male owned and managed firms). This is likely to 
reflect more the specific nature of the business women’s engage in and their land needs than an easier 
access land. Indeed the evidence suggests that while women’s property rights are legally protected, 
tradition frequently favors male inheritance of property, and men tend to play the lead role. Ownership of 
property is traditionally registered to male family members and it is customary for sisters to waive the 
right to their share of property inherited from parents for the benefit of their brothers. Women are little 
aware of their rights and even though a recent Family Law provides the legal framework to encourage 
married women to register themselves as co-owners of the property acquired through marriage, they do 
not appear to avail themselves of these rights often. Further, while Gender Centers were instituted at the 
entity level to promote awareness of women’s rights, they are understaffed and not actively involved in 
the land registration process.

The 3rd DPO is presented here as the last in the programmatic series, but will depend on the availability of IBRD financing, along with sustained 
sound macroeconomic framework. 

The Number and volume of investment operations in FY14 and FY15 will be revisited in CPS Progress Report and will depend on the progress in 
consolidating the portfolio as well as IBRD financing capacity.
