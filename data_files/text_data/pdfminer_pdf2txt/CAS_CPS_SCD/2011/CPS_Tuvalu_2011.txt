EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

i. 
This is the first Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Tuvalu, the World Bank’s 187th 
Member.  The World Bank has been scaling up its assistance throughout the Pacific and has 
decided to transition from the previous umbrella approach characterized by a regional strategy, to 
individual country strategies that permit a more detailed analysis of a country’s specific 
development challenges.  This CAS aims to assist Tuvalu in: (i) mitigating the effects of 
economic isolation; and, (ii) building resilience against exogenous shocks.  The CAS 
accompanies the country’s first IDA investment and initiates the World Bank’s relationship with 
Tuvalu. 

ii. 
Tuvalu is one of the world’s smallest, most isolated and most vulnerable nations and is 
already beginning to experience the impact of climate change.  Tuvalu, comprised of 9 islands 
and atolls, has a total land area of just 26km2 although this is spread across an area of ocean 
around 757,000 km2.  With a population estimated at less than 10,500, only the sovereign states 
of Vatican City and Nauru are less populous.  At its highest point, the country is just 4.5 meters 
(15ft) above sea level making it the second lowest-lying nation in the world after the Maldives 
and highly vulnerable to sea level rise.  Few atolls are more than 800m wide.  The country has 
already begun to experience “king tides” that raise the normal sea level and cause flooding in 
low-lying areas, and it suffers regularly from severe water shortages.   

iii. 
To help address the country’s geographic isolation, the World Bank will seek to assist 
Tuvalu in taking fuller advantage of the opportunities from closer regional and global 
integration.  Tuvalu will participate in a regional IDA operation designed to rehabilitate the 
country’s aviation infrastructure, bring the facilities into compliance with international safety 
regulations and safeguard Tuvalu’s principal connection to the outside world.  The World Bank 
will also focus on measures to help Tuvaluans take full advantage of temporary employment 
opportunities in New Zealand and Australia.   

iv. 
Tuvalu is on the margins of the global economy, heavily reliant on external assistance 
and volatile sources of revenue.  Fishing licenses, external assistance, income from the Tuvalu 
Trust Fund and the lease of the country’s “.tv” internet domain name make up the majority of 
government revenues but are, by their very nature, prone to volatility and often determined by 
factors outside the control of the Government.  Tuvalu’s fiscal position is parlous and the country 
faces uncertain prospects in 2012.  The Government has requested budget support to help 
strengthen fiscal management and undertake urgent fiscal adjustment and the World Bank has 
been in initial dialogue with development partners, to outline the coordinated interventions that 
will anchor the World Bank’s program in this CAS period. 

v. 
World Bank support to Tuvalu will require an adaptive and flexible approach that is 
closely aligned with aid effectiveness principles.  The application of Paris Declaration 
principles in Tuvalu poses a formidable challenge. The 2009 Cairns Compact committed the 
Pacific countries and their development partners to coordinate their resources more effectively 
and to accelerate progress towards the MDGs.  A recognition of these principles and an 
appreciation of the country’s extraordinary capacity challenges will guide all World Bank 
interventions in Tuvalu.

I.   

INTRODUCTION 

1.  The World Bank has been scaling-up analytical and financial support throughout the 
Pacific and is now well-positioned to provide IDA support to Tuvalu.  Tuvalu joined the World 
Bank (IBRD and IDA) in June 2010, becoming the World Bank’s 187th and smallest member.  
Despite a GNI per capita that exceeds the IDA operation cutoff, Tuvalu is characterized by many 
of the factors that warrant the country’s access to IDA16 under the small island economies 
exception and will receive IDA-only resources with effect from FY12.  This Country Assistance 
Strategy (CAS) will be presented together with the first phase of a regional aviation safety 
investment program in which Tuvalu, Tonga and Kiribati will participate, and which is supported 
with regional IDA resources and by the Government of Australia through the Pacific Regional 
Infrastructure Facility (PRIF)1. 
2. 
This country strategy outlines a World Bank program that is directly responsive to 
Tuvalu’s needs and that is informed by the broader themes guiding the World Bank’s 
engagement in the Pacific.  The decision to move to individual country strategies in the Pacific 
reflects an acknowledgement that while Pacific island countries face many common challenges, 
development performance across this region is mixed.  Through this CAS, the World Bank aims 
to adapt its program and instruments carefully to Tuvalu’s singular country context and to signal 
the institution’s long-term commitment to supporting Tuvalu’s development.  Notwithstanding 
the World Bank’s recent expansion across the Pacific, strategies for “micro-states” such as 
Tuvalu will necessarily be concise, highly flexible and will draw upon the range of available 
instruments—but the future program cannot be detailed with the same level of precision as that 
might be expected of the World Bank’s larger clients.  The Government of Tuvalu is strongly 
supportive of the preparation of an individual CAS and of the program outlined. 
3. As the World Bank deepens its knowledge of Tuvalu’s context and priorities, the CAS 
and the program proposed will draw on the analytical work and operational experience of 
Tuvalu’s more established development partners.  Tuvalu’s application for IMF and World 
Bank membership has initiated a close collaboration with all missions to date having been 
undertaken jointly.  Similarly, the World Bank program has been shaped through consultations 
with the Asian Development Bank (ADB), AusAID, the New Zealand Aid Program, the 
Government of Japan, the European Union, the UN System and others. 

II.  COUNTRY CONTEXT AND DEVELOPMENT CHALLENGES 
Sociopolitical Context 
4. 
Tuvalu is a Polynesian Island nation with a history of settlement stretching back 3,000 
years when the islands were first inhabited by Samoan and Tongan voyagers.  The country was 
first sighted by a Spanish explorer in 1568, but was not claimed for Great Britain until 1819 
when the Captain of an armed brigantine sailing under British colors named it the Ellice Islands 
after the Member of Parliament Edward Ellice who owned the vessel’s cargo. 

1  PRIF is a Regional partnership whose main development objective is to provide a framework for better 
engagement of countries and development partners to ensure more effective use of available funding and deliver 
better infrastructure service.

5. 
Tuvalu became fully independent in 1978, since which time it has been governed as a 
Parliamentary democracy.  From 1892-1916, Tuvalu was administered as a British protectorate 
and later as part of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands (1916-1974).  In 1974, Ellice Islanders voted 
for separate British dependency status and to separate from the Gilbert Islands (now the 
independent Republic of Kiribati).  There are just 15 Members of Parliament in the unicameral 
legislature, each serving a four-year term.  There are no formal political parties and floor 
crossing by MPs is always possible.   
6. 
Tuvalu is one of the world’s smallest, most isolated and most vulnerable nations and is 
already beginning to experience the impact of climate change.  Located in the Pacific Ocean 
between Australia and Hawaii and neighboring Kiribati, Samoa, and Fiji, the country is 
comprised of 9 islands (4 reef islands and 5 atolls).  Tuvalu has a total land area of just 26km2 
although covers an ocean area of 757,000 km2.  With a population estimated at less than 10,500, 
only the sovereign states of Vatican City and Nauru are less populous.  About half the population 
lives on the main atoll, Funafuti.  At its highest point, the country is just 4.5 meters (15ft) above 
sea level making it the second lowest-lying nation in the world (after the Maldives) and highly 
vulnerable to sea level rise.  Few atolls are more than 800m wide.  The country has already 
begun to experience “king tides” that raise the normal sea level and cause flooding in low-lying 
areas.  It is estimated that a rise in sea level of between 8-16 inches over the next century might 
submerge the nation entirely2.  Drinking water is primarily collected from rainwater and stored in 
tanks.  In September 2011 the Government declared a state of emergency after “la Niña” weather 
patterns resulted in severe water shortages.  In October 2011 desalination plants and water 
supplies were airlifted to the country to help alleviate the situation. 
7.   Tuvalu’s development outcomes are mixed: 
 Poverty.  Tuvalu’s Gross National Income (GNI) per capita of $4,6703 identifies the country 
as one of the more prosperous Pacific island countries, but does not acknowledge the sharp 
differences in income that exist between the main population center (Funafuti Atoll) and the 
less-developed outer islands where formal employment opportunities are extremely limited.  
While extreme poverty remains a rare phenomenon, the 2010 Household Income and 
Expenditure Survey, indicates that the proportion of the population living in poverty has risen 
significantly from 17.5 percent in 2005 to 25 percent.  

 Education.  Despite substantially meeting the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) of 
universal primary education (99%), significant issues of educational quality persist.  Lack of 
basic skills and insufficient opportunities for vocational skills development are constraining 
the competitiveness of young Tuvaluans and their ability to access seasonal employment 
opportunities overseas.  Moreover, recent analysis indicates that government spending on 
tertiary level scholarships (AUD2.1m; US$2.1m equivalent) is not cost-effective, not always 
applied strategically, and is generating uneven results.  The emphasis on scholarships has 
significantly reduced the level of government resources available for early childhood, 
primary (AUD1.3m) and secondary education (AUD1.5m).

 Health.  The Tuvalu Medical Treatment Scheme (TMTS) that provides Tuvaluans with 
access to critical care overseas when unavailable domestically, has expanded rapidly in 
recent years.  Expenditure has increased substantially from AUD0.5m in 2005 to AUD2.8m 
in 2010 (53 percent of the total health budget) and is acknowledged by Government and 
donors to be unsustainable at its current level.  TMTS expenditure is placing a substantial 
fiscal burden on Government and will need to be addressed as a matter of urgency. 

 Gender.  Tuvalu is a signatory to the Convention for the Elimination of All Forms of 
Discrimination Against Women, and the Constitution provides equal opportunities for men 
and women to contest elections.  This notwithstanding there is currently just one female MP, 
only the second woman have ever won in Tuvalu’s Parliament.  Gender Parity Index(GPI)4  
scores for the period 2000-2009 indicate parity in terms of girls’ enrolment at the primary 
and secondary levels (long-term average 1.07) and is even more pronounced in favor of 
women at the tertiary level (long-term average 1.46). 5  Women account for 47 percent of the 
civil service cadre, but hold only 19 percent of senior positions and make up only 11 percent 
of Board Members in Public Enterprises, Boards and Government Committees.6  Of 
particular concern is the high level of violence against women recorded in the Demographic 
Health Survey (2007) which indicated as many as 4 out of every 10 women have been the 
subject of physical abuse and 1 in 5 the victim of sexual violence.7 

Economic Context 

8. 
Like other small, remote economies, Tuvalu has a relatively undiversified economic base, 
and has experienced uneven economic growth. In the past five years, real GDP growth ranged 
from -1.7 percent to +7.6 percent. Agriculture contributes approximately 23.5 percent of GDP8. 
Subsistence farming and fishing are the main economic activities, although these are constrained 
by poor soil quality, limited access to fresh water and the high cost of imported fuel. The recent 
drought situation (September 2011) is expected to have a significant negative effect on crop 
yields.  The services sector dominates the economy, with retail trade and the public sector 
services accounting for the remaining two-thirds of GDP, as well as a majority of formal sector 
employment. 

9. Expenditure by the Government is a key driver of economic activity. Government 
expenditure has averaged 90 percent of GDP in the past five years. On average, total expenditure 
is split 1:7 between capital and non-capital expenditure. Of the non-capital expenditure, 40 
percent is spent on wages and salaries, 30 percent is used to purchase goods and services (mostly 
imported), and 25 percent spent on subsidies and transfers. Subsidies and transfers in particular, 
doubled from around 12 percent of GDP in 2006 to an estimated 25 percent of GDP in 2010. 
This can partly be explained by the expansion of the TMTS.       

4 Gender Parity Index is calculated by dividing the Gross Enrolment Rate (GER) for females by the GER for men. A 
score of less than 1 indicates a gender disparity against females and a score of above 1 indicates a disparity in favor 
of females.

10. Government revenue is dependent on a few volatile sources. Total revenue and grants 
represented on average 76.5 percent of GDP in the past five years. Of this, 22 percent came from 
tax revenues, 50 percent from non-tax revenues, and 28 percent came from aid. Fishing license 
fees contributed to over two-thirds of non-tax revenue (or a quarter of non-capital expenditure). 
Income from the Tuvalu Trust Fund (TTF; see Box 1) and the lease of the country’s “.tv” internet 
domain name are other sources of non-tax revenue. By their very nature, these revenues are 
prone to volatility and often determined by factors, such as exchange rates (much of Tuvalu’s 
offshore revenue is US dollar denominated) and catch volumes that are beyond the control of the 
Government.  

Box 1: The Tuvalu Trust Fund 

Established in 1987, the Tuvalu Trust Fund (TTF) is considered one of the better managed 
national trust funds in the Pacific.  The TTF was set up by the government to contribute to 
Tuvalu’s financial stability by providing an additional source of revenue for recurrent 
expenditures and to set the country on a path towards greater financial autonomy.  The fund’s 
capital initially came from donors (Australia, New Zealand, Japan, the Republic of Korea and 
the United Kingdom), and the Government.  In subsequent years, the TTF also benefited 
from contributions from windfall revenues, such as those from the lease of the “.tv” internet 
domain and fishing license sales.  

The TTF’s capital is held in the primary trust fund, which aims to generate a real rate of 
return of 4.5 percent in excess of the Australian Consumer Price Index.  In years when the 
market value of the TTF exceeds its real maintained value, the surplus is transferred to the 
Consolidated Investment Fund (CIF).  The CIF, which also serves as a repository for 
windfall revenues, can be used for budget financing as well as capital reinvestments that 
are back-transferred to the primary trust fund.  In the past five years, the CIF has financed 
on average 1/5 of non-capital expenditure.  The CIF targets a minimum balance equivalent 
to 16 percent of the TTF’s real maintained value (or approximately 45 percent of GDP).  
This target aims at covering up to four years without transfers from the TTF.  

To date, in line with the international deed that governs the TTF, no capital withdrawal has 
been made by the Government.  The TTF’s market value is projected to fall to 235 percent 
of GDP at the end of 2011, down from around 288 percent of GDP at the end of 2010.  The 
TTF’s market value has been below its real maintained value since 2008.  In addition, the 
CIF balance as a percentage of GDP fell from 46 percent in 2009, to 21 percent in 2010 
and, without corrective measures, faces depletion by 2012. 

11. Tuvalu faces a structural trade deficit and is vulnerable to international price 
fluctuations.  Merchandise exports amount to 1.7 percent of GDP, and prospects for increasing 
these are limited. Given very limited domestic production, Tuvalu is heavily dependent on 
imports (48 percent of GDP).  All petroleum products and a very high proportion of food are 
imported, leaving the country extremely vulnerable to international commodity price shocks.  
The trade deficit in the past five years averaged 37 percent of GDP. Tourist arrivals, unlike many 

4 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
other Pacific island countries, are very low (just over 300 visitors per year) due to poor 
infrastructure and very limited passenger capacity. The trade deficit is largely financed by 
seafarer remittances, investment income from the TTF, fishing license fees, as well as official 
grants. In the last five years, grants have amounted to nearly 36 percent of GDP.  Reserves have 
remained adequate, above 8 months of imports.  

Recent Economic Developments and Issues 

12. Despite its remoteness, the global economic crisis has affected Tuvalu’s economy. The 
impact of the crisis was felt most acutely through falling external income. Remittances from 
seafarers, traditionally one of the most important sources of household income, fell sharply from 
around 10 percent of GDP to 6 percent of GDP since the onset of the global crisis.   The TTF lost 
an estimated 9 percent of its value in 2009 following a slump in international financial markets 
and, as a result, investment income fell from 15 percent of GDP in 2008 to 9 percent of GDP in 
2009. The overall economy contracted by 1.7 percent in 2009, followed by a further 0.5 percent 
contraction in 2010. Annual inflation on the other hand has been negative since mid-2009 due to 
lower global food prices and the strong Australian dollar (the national currency).  

13. The Government has supported the economy by increasing spending, but the fiscal 
situation is becoming precarious. Spending pressures were exacerbated by the Government 
having to make payments on guaranteed debt for an airline company. Owing to weak domestic 
revenue and offshore income, as well as increased spending, the fiscal deficit increased sharply 
from 3 percent of GDP in 2009 to almost 38 percent of GDP in 2010. As a result, CIF resources 
(see Box 1) were substantially reduced, bringing it to the verge of exhaustion.  In 2011, 
expenditure as a percentage of GDP is expected to remain elevated, but the fiscal deficit is 
estimated to narrow to 23 percent of GDP due to increased aid flows.  

14. Tuvalu requires continued access to grants to finance key development expenditures. A 
debt sustainability analysis suggests that in the absence of substantial grant financing, Tuvalu 
faces a high risk of debt distress.  The Present Value (PV) of external public debt stood at 28 
percent of GDP as at the end of 2010, close to the indicative threshold of 30 percent.  It is 
projected that, by 2021, the PV of external public debt will exceed the threshold were grant 
financing to be substituted by concessional debt.  In particular, given Tuvalu’s negligible export 
base, the PV of external public debt as a percentage of exports is currently more than twice the 
indicative threshold and likely to remain above this level for the foreseeable future.  

15. In order to ensure sustained increases in living standards, Tuvaluans need to be better 
prepared for overseas job opportunities. With limited domestic employment opportunities and 
demand for Tuvaluan international maritime seafarers declining in the face of greater 
competition from other countries, education and vocational training systems need to be 
strengthened to enable Tuvaluans to compete effectively.  

16. Assessments of the quality of governance in Tuvalu present an uneven picture.  
Compared against its 11 Pacific neighbors and 8 other East Asian economies on the six broad 

5 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
dimensions of governance9 measured in the latest World Governance Indicators10, Tuvalu rates 
in the 90th-100th percentile in two indicators (political stability, a metric that measures the 
likelihood of government overthrow, and the rule of law); in the 50th-75th percentile for two other 
indicators (voice and accountability; control of corruption); in the 25th-50th percentile for one 
indicator (government effectiveness), and in the lowest percentile (0th-10th) for regulatory 
quality. The relatively weak performance on the measure of regulatory quality is not surprising  
as this is intended to assess perceptions of a government’s ability to formulate and implement 
sound policies and to promote private sector development.  In this comparison, of Tuvalu’s 
Pacific neighbors, only the Solomon Islands and Kiribati are rated lower. 

Government Priorities and Development Framework: Te Kakeega II 

17. The Government of Tuvalu’s vision for achieving sustainable development and “a 
healthy, educated, peaceful and prosperous Tuvalu” is outlined in Te Kakeega11 II: National 
Strategy for Sustainable Development 2005-2015.  The strategy was endorsed in 2005 and is 
rooted in a commitment to attaining the MDGs.  Te Kakeega II provides the basis for this CAS.  
The strategy is underpinned by eight strategic areas: (i) good governance; (ii) economic growth 
and stability; (iii) social development; (iv) Falekaupule12 and outer islands development; (v) 
employment and private sector development; (vi) education and human development resources; 
(vii) natural resources; and, (viii) infrastructure and support services.  A wide ranging review of 
the implementation progress of Te Kakeega II is underway and is scheduled to be completed at 
the end of November 2011.  In discussions with the World Bank and development partners, the 
Government has identified economic growth and stability and infrastructure development as 
priorities for World Bank assistance. 

Development Partner Engagement 

18. Given the geographic and economic constraints the country faces, development 
assistance is unlikely to be a transitional phenomenon in Tuvalu. Tuvalu, in common with 
other small island states, is heavily reliant on overseas development assistance with net flows to 
Tuvalu in recent years reaching slightly under US$13m13 per annum equivalent to about 40 
percent of GDP.  The objective for the World Bank should be to support and sustain a strong 
policy environment in which well-targeted and predictable levels of foreign assistance help 
enhance living standards and service delivery.  Of equal importance will be assisting Tuvalu in 
harnessing the benefits of closer economic integration with the metropolitan countries in the 
region, increasing the returns from the sustainable management of Tuvalu’s pelagic fish stocks, 
and by providing greater opportunities for young Tuvaluans to access overseas employment 
opportunities. The World Bank has collaborated closely with Tuvalu’s development partners and 
hopes to continue to draw on their expertise and experience as the Bank looks to align its 
assistance with existing programs and Tuvalu’s development priorities.  

9 These are: Voice and accountability; political stability and absence of violence; Government effectiveness; 
regulatory quality; rule of law; and, control of corruption.

 Asian Development Bank.  The Country Operations Business Plan for Tuvalu (2012-2014) 
maintains the strategic focus of ADB assistance to Tuvalu on strengthening public sector 
management. Tuvalu’s 2012-2014 Asian Development Fund (ADF) grant allocation will 
total US$2.35m, which includes a carryover of US$1.36m from the previous period and will 
be provide in the form of budget support.  In addition, Tuvalu is expected to receive an 
allocation of around US$300,000 for technical assistance that is likely to focus on 
strengthening public financial management and the implementation of public enterprise 
reforms supported through previous ADB assistance.   

 Australia.  Australia is one of Tuvalu’s larger development partners whose 2011-2012 
country program is estimated at AUD7.4m, (US$7.5m equivalent).  Tuvalu also benefits 
from a proportion of the AUD2.5m that AusAID provides in regional assistance. The 
priorities for Australia’s assistance to Tuvalu are set out in the Partnership for Development 
signed with the Government of Tuvalu in August 2009.  The Partnership identifies three 
areas of priority: economic governance, education and human resources, and climate change 
and the environment.  Australia has also contributed approximately AUD6.93m to the Tuvalu 
Trust Fund over the period 2008-2010. Australia provides substantial support for tertiary 
education through a program of overseas scholarships to institutions in the Pacific and in 
Australia, as well as emergency assistance in response to natural disasters such as the 2011 
drought emergency.  In 2010, Australia established Tuvalu’s first Women’s Crisis Center to 
provide shelter and counseling to victims of domestic violence.  Australia has also taken a 
lead role in assisting the Government to outline a Policy Reform Matrix that will inform 
future budget support operations by development partners. 

 European Union (EU).  The European Union has been active in Tuvalu since the country’s 
independence in 1978.  The current program under the ACP-EU 9th European Development 
Fund (EDF; 2003-2007) totaled €5.2m (US$7.2m equivalent) and reflected the EU’s 
longstanding focus on outer islands development.  Activities supported included: primary 
school construction and provision of equipment and supplies, waste collection and disposal 
in Funafuti, and household and municipal water storage improvements.  Under EDF 10, EU 
assistance will focus on water and sanitation with an indicative allocation of €5m.  In 
recognition of the impact of the global financial slowdown, the EU’s Vulnerability FLEX 
program is providing an additional €1.5m in general budget support tied to the ADB’s 
ongoing program of public enterprise reform. 

 Government of Japan.  Japan provides development assistance to Tuvalu on a rolling basis.  
The current program (2009-2014), envisages providing support through regional and national 
programs and focuses on areas including: climate change and disaster risk management; 
environmental conservation; health and education services; economic development; and, 
governance.  Japan provides Tuvalu Electricity Corporation (the state-owned electricity 
utility) with an annual fuel grant that in 2011 was equivalent to three months fuel supply.  
JICA is the largest single donor in education through its support for the rehabilitation of the 
national secondary college. 

 New Zealand.  New Zealand is one of Tuvalu’s longstanding development partners and has a 
2011/2012 allocation for Tuvalu totaling NZ$5m (US$2.8m equivalent), which includes 

7 

 
 
 
 
 
NZ$1m carried over from the previous fiscal year.  Assistance identified under Tuvalu and 
New Zealand’s Joint Commitment for Development focuses on sustainable economic 
development (SED) and human resource development (HRD).  Within the scope of the SED 
focus, emphasis will be given to improving the efficiency and safety of inter-island shipping, 
increasing renewable energy use, and better management of fisheries resources.  HRD 
encompasses workforce skills development.  Tuvalu also receives assistance through New 
Zealand funded regional health, environment and disaster risk reduction and management 
programs – usually delivered by regional agencies.  New Zealand (along with Australia, the 
United Kingdom, Japan, South Korea, and Tuvalu) was an original contributor to the Tuvalu 
Trust Fund (see Box 1) and has made periodic contributions to the Trust Fund.  In recognition 
of the impact of the global financial crisis, New Zealand provided NZ$4.4m in direct budget 
support to the Government for the period 2009-2012.   

 Taiwan, China.  Taiwan, China is a longstanding donor partner of Tuvalu and provides a 
range of technical assistance including in the areas of household agriculture and medical 
assistance.  Financial assistance is provided in the form of general budget support at an 
annual level of US$5m.  Taiwan, China provided an additional US$1.5m in 2011 in response 
to a government request, although support is expected to revert back to US$5m in 2012.    

 United Nations.  UN System agencies continue to provide support to Tuvalu in a range of 
areas.  In response to the recent drought situation, OCHA and UNICEF have provided 
Tuvalu with emergency assistance.  UNDP is providing support to implement the National 
Adaptation Plan of Action with a GEF-funded project that aims to increase the resilience of 
coastal areas and communities to the impact of climate change. 

 Civil Society.  In addition to Church groups that have a traditional and important role in their 
communities, the Tuvalu Association of Non-Governmental Organizations (TANGO) is also 
active throughout Tuvalu in such areas as: promoting good governance; assisting 
communities in managing conservation and coastal areas, fauna and reef preservation; 
supporting regional HIV/AIDS initiatives at the community level; and acting as a focal 
organization for the Global Environment Facility.  TANGO is affiliated with the Pacific 
Island Association of NGOs (PIANGO) which has members in 21 Pacific countries and 
territories.  PIANGO receives funding from New Zealand and Australia among other 
development partners. 

III.  WORLD BANK ENGAGEMENT IN THE PACIFIC 
Transforming World Bank Engagement in the Pacific Region 

19. The World Bank’s engagement in the Pacific island countries reflects the fact that these 
clients’ development trajectories will be shaped – perhaps more than any other nations in the 
world – by their economic geography.  The World Bank’s Pacific island member countries14 
have a total population of about 2 million, spread across hundreds of islands, and scattered across 
an area equivalent to 15 percent of the globe’s surface.  Given their extreme vulnerability to 

14 Fiji, Kiribati, Palau, Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu and Vanuatu.

economic shocks, natural disasters and the effects of climate change, achieving sustained 
development progress is a long-term proposition requiring collaboration with international 
partners. 

20. The World Bank has significantly expanded its presence and program throughout the 
Pacific as a part of a renewed commitment to the region.  In recent years, IDA (as well as IFC – 
although Tuvalu is not currently a member) has expanded its engagement and activities in 
established clients (for example Samoa and Tonga) and has been placing particular emphasis on 
deepening engagement in new or less-established clients such as Tuvalu.  Reflecting the common 
challenges faced by many Pacific countries, World Bank engagement across the Pacific has been 
tightly focused on four overarching themes:  (i) strengthening regional/global integration; (ii) 
building resilience to economic shocks, natural disasters and climate change; (iii) encouraging 
economic reform and private sector development; and (iv) improving education, health and the 
social services.  The way in which these objectives are interpreted will vary according to country 
circumstances, the government’s development priorities and the extent to which World Bank 
assistance can complement existing development programs.  Translating these themes into a 
program that responds to Tuvalu’s needs is the purpose of this CAS. 

21. The World Bank is committed to the Cairns Compact agreed by Pacific leaders to ensure 
better use of all development resources, and will work closely with clients and partners to 
improve development effectiveness.  The total level of aid from all donors to the Pacific is 
increasing substantially, a fact that underscores the need for effective coordination (in terms of 
co-financing as well as in coordinating mission schedules) and collaboration between clients and 
donors.  As part of Cairns Compact monitoring, Tuvalu benefitted from a peer review (by other 
Pacific Islands Forum members) of MDG progress that has helped identify target areas for future 
assistance.  Tuvalu, although small, has not been immune to aid fragmentation.  A recent 
assessment of donor support to the health and education sectors in Tuvalu15 reports a total of 
nearly 90 projects, indicating considerable scope for further harmonization and alignment.  The 
value of the World Bank’s engagement in Tuvalu is not principally defined in terms of its size, 
but rather by the extent to which the World Bank can bundle its expertise and funding, 
collaborate with other development partners, transfer global knowledge, develop capacity and 
support changes that will improve the lives of Tuvaluans.  

Translating the Pacific Themes into the Tuvalu Program  

22. Reflecting the Government’s development priorities and the themes underpinning the 
World Bank’s engagement in the Pacific, the program in Tuvalu will focus on: 

 Strategic Area 1: Mitigating economic isolation by encouraging regional and global 
integration; and 
 Strategic Area 2: Building resilience against exogenous shocks 

23. Tuvalu’s extreme vulnerability to climate change and sea level rise makes the systematic 
consideration of these issues an imperative in all World Bank activities.

Strategic Area 1: Mitigating economic isolation by encouraging regional and global 
integration 

24. The initial focus of the World Bank’s program will be Tuvalu’s inclusion in a regional 
Pacific Aviation Investment Program (PAIP).  Whereas many other Pacific island countries’ air 
links serve to bring tourists to their country, Funafuti International Airport provides a critical 
lifeline for Tuvaluans whose strategic significance is hard to overstate.  A shortage of 
employment opportunities in Tuvalu has resulted in a migrant work culture where Tuvaluans 
travel overseas for extended periods and a significant proportion of Tuvalu’s tertiary students 
receive their education in overseas institutions.  Critically ill patients that cannot be offered 
treatment in Tuvalu depend on reliable air travel to access specialist care in Fiji or New Zealand.  
Air travel also serves a Tuvaluan Diaspora that extends through the Pacific and beyond, as 
Tuvaluans seek employment, education and other opportunities overseas.  This intervention 
responds directly to the CAS objective of facilitating Tuvalu’s deeper integration with their 
larger Pacific trading partners. 

25. The investments proposed under PAIP, which mobilizes regional and national IDA 
resources, will safeguard Tuvalu’s principal connection to the outside world.  These 
investments are expected to promote regional integration (with additional funding provided by 
the Pacific Regional Infrastructure Facility, PRIF), expand markets for goods and services, and 
facilitate trade and labor mobility.  The program will also support the Government in 
strengthening their aviation regulatory oversight and operations.  Mindful of the technical 
complexity of the operation and Tuvalu’s unfamiliarity with World Bank processes, particular 
care has been given to simplifying project design and to ensuring an appropriate level of 
implementation support – considerations that will be applied to all future World Bank operations 
in Tuvalu. 

26. Across the Pacific, the World Bank Group will work with clients and partners to help 
island states derive greater benefits from regional cooperation and from closer integration 
with larger metropolitan countries.  In common with its Pacific neighbors, there are significant 
potential benefits from closer regional cooperation in improving the sustainable management of 
pelagic fish stocks and opportunities for temporary labor migration. 

27. A fisheries management strategy for the Pacific is being developed, following a request 
for support from the Parties to the Nauru Agreement (PNA) Office.  Tuvalu and the other 
seven Pacific island members of the PNA collectively account for approximately 40 percent of 
the world’s tuna stocks.  This group, for whom fisheries remain their primary resource, is 
undertaking measures to improve the management of the tuna resource and to ensure that 
members receive a more equitable share of benefits.  These include: agreements to cut licensed 
fishing days by 30 percent in 2011; the closure of high seas pockets that previously complicated 
the control of fishing activities in the Pacific; improved vessel monitoring systems to reduce 
illegal, unregulated and unreported fishing; and preferential treatment for domestic vessels or 
those that comply with specific requirements for local crew and unloading.  In formulating a 
fisheries strategy, the Bank will work closely with the existing regional architecture managing 
fisheries in the Pacific, including the Forum Fisheries Agency (FFA), Secretariat of the Pacific 

10 

 
 
 
 
Community (SPC) and the Western Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC), as well as 
other donor partners (including Australia and New Zealand who are already active in the sector). 

28. 
The World Bank will continue to work closely with Tuvalu, other Pacific island 
countries and partners, to help expand seasonal and other international employment 
opportunities.  Labor is one of Tuvalu’s few viable exports.  New Zealand’s Recognized 
Seasonal Employment (RSE) scheme, for which Tuvalu is eligible, has already provided over 
9,000 Pacific islanders with opportunities to work for up to nine months in the horticultural 
industry.  Tuvalu’s participation in the RSE scheme has been limited to date with around 200 
workers having been recruited in the first three seasons of the scheme – a reflection of the higher 
barriers to participation that Tuvaluans face.  Transportation costs are high (often by Government 
vessel to Fiji and then by air to New Zealand), and made more so as the Government seeks to 
provide Tuvaluans in the outer islands with these opportunities.  More than a logistical challenge 
however, Tuvaluans have little experience of formal employment and are less competitive than 
applicants from other countries.  In September 2011, the Australian Government announced the 
eligibility of Tuvaluans to participate in an expanded Pacific Seasonal Workers pilot scheme. 
The World Bank will work closely with donors already working on education and skills 
development programs to help enable Tuvaluans – particularly women – to take full advantage of 
this and similar schemes. 

Strategic Area 2: Building resilience against exogenous shocks 

29. Tuvalu has requested budget support to help strengthen fiscal management and 
undertake urgent fiscal adjustment.  Despite its isolation, Tuvalu continues to feel the effects of 
the global slowdown and remains highly vulnerable to exogenous shocks.  Tuvalu’s fiscal 
position is parlous.  With the CIF likely to be exhausted in 2011, and with few additional sources 
of external financing anticipated, the country faces uncertain prospects in 2012.  The World 
Bank has been in initial dialogue with both the Government and development partners (several of 
whom have valuable experience with budget support operations in Tuvalu), a reform program 
that will likely anchor the World Bank’s program in this CAS period. The Australian High 
Commission in Suva, Fiji will host a meeting of Government and development partners in 
December 2011, the first such meeting since 2008, to discuss a policy matrix prepared by 
Government with Australian support.  Policy actions might include measures to: reduce 
government expenditure on tertiary education; reorient expenditures to correct underinvestment 
in primary, secondary and post secondary skills development; reducing unsustainable 
expenditure on the TMTS; rebalance investment in national primary and preventative health 
services; contain budget expenditures and manage public debt more efficiently; and increase 
levels of revenue collection. Wherever possible, the monitoring the achievement of prior actions 
will be linked to existing processes and development partner missions. 

30. Tuvalu faces an existential threat from the impact of climate change and will need 
sustained and coordinated assistance to mitigate these challenges.  Climate change concerns 
cut across all aspects of Tuvalu’s development.  A majority of Tuvalu’s established development 
partners identify climate change as a central focus of their programs of support.  Australia and 
the European Union have provided water storage tanks throughout Funafuti and in communities 
in the Outer Islands.  Tuvalu’s National Adaptation Plan of Action provides the framework for 

11 

 
 
 
 
 
coordinated development assistance for climate change around which the ongoing multi-donor 
program supported by UNDP, the Secretariat of the Pacific Community, Australia, and the 
Global Environment Facility is organized.  The Government of Japan is pioneering technology to 
increase foram sand production to help island formation and to prevent sea level rise, and the 
Asian Development Bank is including Tuvalu in its regional climate change interventions.  The 
scope of the challenge will require the World Bank to develop an appreciation of the 
Government’s priorities before undertaking more complex activities. The World Bank will also 
seek to work with other partners to mobilize grant financing for climate change investments.  All 
planned World Bank activities will incorporate climate resilience measures such as the 
introduction of efficient water resource management practices, rain water harvesting and water 
storage measures as integral elements of project design. 

31. The frequency of drought conditions in Tuvalu underscores the need for a systematic 
assessment of water resource management practices.  The World Bank aims to support the 
preparation of a drought management plan that will identify practical mitigation measures at 
government and household levels.  These might include maximizing rainwater capture and 
storage, improving weather forecasting, and to outline local planning measures such as water 
rationing and securing alternative water supplies.  The World Bank would seek to coordinate and 
collaborate with technical agencies already active in this area such as the Secretariat of the 
Pacific Community Applied Geoscience and Technology Division (SPC/SOPAC) an approach 
that would also facilitate exchange with Kiribati and other countries that are confronting similar 
challenges.  If identified by the Government as a priority, the World Bank and development 
partners could include broader disaster risk management and climate change measures in future 
development policy operations.     

Implementation: Coordination, Selectivity and New Ways of Doing Business  

32. In Tuvalu, the operational experience of established development partners argues for 
coordinated dialogue.  Pacific clients have required development partners to reassess and adapt 
their conventional operational approaches.  In the Solomon Islands, the Core Economic Working 
Group (CEWG), established in 2009 and led by the Ministry of Finance, has brought together 
government officials across ministries with representatives of the ADB, AusAID, New Zealand 
Aid Program, European Union, the Regional Assistance Mission, IMF and the World Bank.  
Originally convened to support the Government’s efforts to improve spending, promote 
economic growth and sound public financial management, the CEWG has provided a forum in 
which Government and partners have jointly developed a three-year reform matrix that is 
effectively aligned to the Government’s budget processes.  The Government of Tuvalu is seeking 
to establish a model for donor coordination similar to the CEWG that should assist both 
Government and donors to make progress in fulfilling their Paris, Accra and Cairns Compact 
commitments. 

33. While World Bank experience with Development Policy Operations (DPO) in the Pacific 
is limited, the instrument has been shown effective in supporting reform and in strengthening 
Pacific countries’ resilience.   The successive impacts of the food and fuel crises together with 
those caused by a prolonged global economic downturn have placed severe strains on highly 
vulnerable Pacific countries.  In this context, budget support operations have helped to provide 

12 

 
  
 
 
 
predictable resources in a relatively rapid manner while sustaining reform momentum that might 
otherwise have stalled in the face of further economic and fiscal stresses.  The Government of 
Tuvalu has welcomed the proposal to develop a coordinated budget support operation, and to 
work together with the World Bank and existing development partners, to structure a DPO that, 
if successful, could lead to further operations. 

34. In providing support to Tuvalu, the World Bank will exercise a high degree of selectivity. 
As Tuvalu’s newest development partner, the World Bank does not yet have the depth of country 
experience that would enable it to contribute equally to all Tuvalu’s development priorities.  The 
program outlined in this CAS is, thus, closely focused on activities that are either directly 
relevant to the themes guiding the World Bank’s engagement in the Pacific (for example 
strengthening regional and global integration through the PAIP), or that aim to replicate 
successful experience elsewhere in the region (such as the experience with budget support 
approaches in the Solomon Islands, Tonga and Samoa).  Acknowledging the risks of aid 
fragmentation or overreach, initial activities will be carefully designed and sequenced with the 
aim of building credibility with the Government. 

35. Selectivity will be accompanied by close collaboration with development partners.  
Development partners have asked the World Bank to provide an overview of experience with 
budget support in the Pacific as this is being considered in Tuvalu.  In particular, the World Bank 
has been invited to outline the processes, approaches and principles that have characterized 
successful budget support operations elsewhere in the Pacific.  The World Bank also expects to 
make available its regional analyses where these can inform and enhance overall support to 
Tuvalu.  Equally, the World Bank will also look to draw on or contribute to analysis being 
undertaken by other partners in areas where the World Bank may have a useful role to play. 

36. A targeted program of World Bank analytical work is proposed in sectors where the 
World Bank is initiating engagement and in collaboration with the analysis being undertaken 
by other partners.  Analytical and technical assistance anticipated during the first part of the 
CAS period is set out below:

FY12 
 (Regional) Fisheries Engagement Strategy: Support to the PNA Secretariat 
 Drought Risk Management Strategy 
FY13 
Participation in the IMF 2012 Article IV 

37. With deeper understanding of the country context, the World Bank will be able to play a 
more active role collaborating closely with donors in areas where it has a comparative 
advantage.  This is likely to be particularly significant in addressing the existential threat that 
Tuvalu faces from climate change.  Whereas in the 2011 drought crisis, donors such as Australia, 
New Zealand, United States, the IFRC and UN system have been well-placed to respond to the 
humanitarian needs, the World Bank is exploring possible interventions in the area of water 
resource management that may serve to address the structural and medium-term challenges 

13 

 
 
 
 
 
 
Tuvalu faces and to complement the ongoing work of AusAID, SOPAC and the European Union 
(among others). 

38. Developing leadership and institutions in Tuvalu capable of successfully implementing 
reform demands the World Bank’s commitment to a long-term capacity enhancement effort.  
Tuvalu—and governments throughout the Pacific—face significant challenges in recruiting and 
retaining domestic expertise.  In micro-states such as Tuvalu the absolute size of the population 
and the pull of overseas opportunities only increase this challenge.  By being selective and by 
adopting a pragmatic approach to these constraints, the World Bank will place a premium on 
coordination, intensive implementation support, and on projects whose design is carefully 
calibrated to the country’s capacity. 

39. Anticipated outcomes of the World Bank engagement in Tuvalu are set out in the results 
matrix in Attachment 1.  Given the initial nature of the World Bank’s dialogue with Tuvalu, the 
results matrix will be augmented and revised as implementation proceeds, and updated in the 
CAS Progress Report. 

Financing Terms and Sources 

40. The indicative IDA resource envelope under the FY12-FY15 CAS amounts to SDR9.6 
million (equivalent to US$14.4 million). The CAS covers the three years of IDA16 (FY12-14) 
and the first year of IDA 17 (FY15).  It is assumed that the allocations to Tuvalu for FY13-FY15 
will be equivalent to the FY12 level.  The amounts for these fiscal years are indicative only.  
Actual allocations will depend on:  (i) the country’s own performance; (ii) its performance 
relative to that of other IDA recipients; (iii) the amount of overall resources available to IDA; 
(iv) changes in the list of active IDA-eligible countries; (v) terms of financial assistance provided 
(grants or loans); and (vi) the amount of compensatory resources received for MDRI.

IV. MANAGING RISKS 
41. Risks to the success and impact of the World Bank’s engagement in Tuvalu are high.  
Belying its small size, Tuvalu is confronting a complex range of development challenges that 
threaten the country’s sustainability, and for which there are few precedents.  These risks are 
magnified by the extreme limitations on capacity that exist when engaging in a sovereign state 
with a population of fewer than 11,000 people.

14 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                            
42. Institutional capacity could constrain program 
implementation. 
 World Bank 
interventions will be informed by the pace of reform and designed to account for the present 
level of institutional capacity.  As an example, arrangements have been made for a Technical and 
Fiduciary Service Unit, located in Tonga to assist with PAIP procurement recognizing its limited 
familiarity with World Bank procurement guidelines.  This experience will help build capacity in 
Tuvalu to undertake future Bank-financed interventions.  The initial experience with PAIP and 
budget support operations may also provide entry points for dialogue on public procurement and 
as a means to mitigate risks stemming from anticipated weaknesses in the public financial 
management system.   

43. Tuvalu remains extremely vulnerable to external shocks and subject to many factors 
outside the country’s control.  Tuvalu is highly reliant on imported food and the country’s 
electricity supply also depends upon imported petroleum products and has been significantly 
affected by recent global price shocks.  While Tuvalu’s economic geography cannot be fully 
overcome, the World Bank will assist Tuvalu in reaping the benefits of closer regional and global 
integration.  Confronting climate change will require sustained and coordinated support.  All 
World Bank activities will incorporate climate resilience measures. 

44. To mitigate the above risks, the World Bank will draw on the experience and expertise of 
longstanding partners and find ways of adapting its approaches and operational models to the 
realities on the ground.  The World Bank is proposing a pragmatic and flexible program that 
will draw on global and regional experience as well as that of partners with a longer track record 
in Tuvalu.  Risks will also be managed through use, wherever possible, of regional approaches 
and replication of successful experience from elsewhere in the Pacific.  Given development 
partners’ limited in-country representation, donor coordination also presents a challenge that will 
need to be carefully and creatively managed. 

45. Given the potential difficulties of sustaining reform commitment in Tuvalu, new 
activities will be carefully sequenced and linked to areas where there is demonstrated reform 
momentum.  Decisions on subsequent operations will only be taken after an analysis of the 
World Bank’s initial interventions.  The Government’s expressed support for this CAS and the 
program outlined will be critical in ensuring effective implementation.
