EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

i. 
Background. Albania has continued its strong performance in achieving high economic 
growth through the implementation of its National Strategy for Social and Economic 
Development (NSSED). During the implementation of the previous CAS, Albania enjoyed 
macroeconomic stability and average real GDP growth rates of over 5 percent – the highest in 
Southeastern Europe - underpinned by rising exports (albeit from a low base), and continuing 
improvements 
in factor productivity. However, maintaining 
this performance will be 
increasingly difficult, and Albania will need to attract much needed foreign direct investment 
(FDI), increase public and private savings, accelerate accumulation of physical and human 
capital, and improve governance structures to maintain its impressive progress to date. Despite 
GDP per capita reaching an estimated US$ 2,040 in 2004, widespread poverty, high 
unemployment, and wide regional disparities remain daunting challenges.  

ii. 
Much has been achieved towards establishing a market-based economy in Albania 
since the beginning of transition in 1992. The last CAS period saw major progress especially in 
privatization, trade liberalization and building a sound financial sector in the aftermath of the 
pyramid schemes crisis of 1997 which profoundly interrupted Albania’s social and economic 
progress. Institutional capacity at central levels has improved, although problems of poor 
governance and state capture persist and constitute substantial barriers to investment. Albania 
has also begun to decentralize government functions but the pace of devolution has been slow 
due to political constraints and limited capacity at the municipal and local Government levels. 
Nonetheless, the decentralization process holds great promise, given Albania’s characteristics, to 
improve the delivery of services to the poorest Albanians, especially in health, education and 
water supply. 

iii. 
The Stabilization and Association process (SAp) with the European Union (EU) is 
crucial to Albania. Eventual membership in the EU remains an overarching long-term vision in 
the country, and negotiations on a Stabilization and Association Agreement with the EU have 
been a national priority. However, progress has been slow, due in part to a lack of progress in 
improving perceptions of poor governance. Albania has recently completed the third progress 
report of its NSSED, and has begun to implement a new Integrated Planning System (IPS) in an 
ambitious effort to streamline its policy development processes and integrate numerous planning 
frameworks such as the NSSED, the SAp, the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) 
framework, and the NATO Partnership for Peace. The IPS offers much promise with respect to 
aligning government decision-making behind a coherent and coordinated long-term vision, and 
ensuring that investment decisions are made within the framework of a sound Medium-Term 
Budgeting Process (MTBP). The IPS also promises a framework to consolidate recent 
improvements in donor coordination. 

iv. 
The World Bank Group (WBG) continues to be a strong development partner with 
Albania. The WBG has provided strong support to Albania since 1991, including IDA 
commitments totaling US$ 820 million, IFC commitments of US$ 125 million, and MIGA 
guarantees totaling US$ 8.6 million. The quality of the active portfolio has continued to improve, 
with an increasing focus on long-term capacity development and implementation through 
Government structures. A CAS Completion Report for the 2002 CAS, informed by evaluations 
by OED and QAG, concluded that the Bank’s assistance has been satisfactory, although 

Albania Country Assistance Strategy

vi

outcomes in the areas of governance have not been as positive as anticipated. 

v. 
The new Results-Based Country Assistance Strategy. This fourth World Bank Group 
CAS for Albania (a joint product of IDA/IBRD and IFC), covering the period FY06-FY09, 
outlines a program of support including financing on modified IDA terms of up to US$ 86 
million as well as IBRD financing of up to US$ 110 million. Albania is expected to fully 
graduate from IDA to IBRD by the end of FY08. The timing of the CAS coincides with the 
political cycle in Albania -- parliamentary elections in July 2005 resulted in the formation of a 
new Government with a four-year mandate in September 2005.  

vi. 
The CAS program seeks to support Albania’s efforts in improving governance while 
increasing selectivity. The new CAS recognizes that more coherent efforts need to be made to 
address the challenge of poor governance in Albania, and introduces a ‘Governance Filter’ 
compromising of four core principles which will be used to ensure that governance 
considerations are mainstreamed into all of the Bank’s interventions. The CAS program is also 
more selective, focused on two pillars:  

(I) Continued Economic Growth through Support to Private Sector Development, with 
expected outcomes including (a) macroeconomic stability; (b) improved business climate 
through better quality of business regulations and improved public-private sector dialogue; (c) 
improved public infrastructure; (d) increased operational efficiency of financial institutions; (e) 
improved functioning of the land market; (f) improved corporate governance; (g) increased 
transparency and efficiency in the management of public spending and stronger institutions for 
planning, tendering and providing infrastructure and services; (h) better accountability in 
public administration; and (i) better management and planning for Albanian coastal resources. 

(II) Improving Public Service Delivery, particularly in the Social Sectors, with expected 
outcomes including: (a) improved educational attainment and quality of basic education; (b) 
improved efficiency and equity of health financing; (c) better quality of health care; (d) 
improved fiscal sustainability of the social insurance system and increased access to well-
targeted, sustainable, and effective assistance; and (e) improved access to safe rural water 
supply and sanitation. 

vii. 
A focused lending and ESW program is planned. Up to 11 new IDA/IBRD lending 
operations are proposed in FY06-FY09, of which three would be a Programmatic Development 
Policy Loan (DPL) series building on the success of the PRSC series in the previous CAS. A 
lending range (US$ 75 – 196 million) is proposed for the CAS, with actual lending to be 
determined by progress against a set of key milestones specified in the monitoring framework for 
the CAS. A CAS Progress Report is planned for FY08. 

viii. The program is designed to mitigate risks that could limit the effectiveness of the 
proposed program and impede achievement of outcomes. The new CAS recognizes that 
achieving the outcomes articulated in the Results Framework will be subject to risks, particularly 
in the form of internal or regional political instability and external economic shocks. Strong 
political commitment in the region to EU integration and flexibility in the proposed support 
program will serve to reduce these risks.

THE REPUBLIC OF ALBANIA: COUNTRY ASSISTANCE STRATEGY 

I. INTRODUCTION 

1. 
Albania’s record since it embarked on its transition in the early 1990s has been 
impressive. The country has successfully built the foundations of market-based economy, created 
democratic institutions and gradually built capacity in the public administration to cope with 
political and economic transformation. These efforts have resulted in a track record of 
macroeconomic stability, as well as achievement of the fastest rates of GDP growth in South 
Eastern Europe (SEE). Such achievements notwithstanding, Albania remains one of the poorest 
countries in Europe with an income per capita estimated at US$ 2,040 (Atlas method) in 2004, 
widespread poverty, high unemployment rate, substantial regional disparities, and weak 
governance structures. 

2. 
The proposed CAS for FY06-FY09 builds on the experience of the World Bank Group 
(WBG) since the early 1990s (through three CASs).1 It is oriented towards results, is based on 
systematic WBG collaboration, and was prepared in consultation with country authorities, 
development partners and other stakeholders. The CAS aims to support Albania’s National 
Strategy for Social and Economic Development (NSSED) and the European Union (EU) 
Stabilization and Association process (SAp) with the ultimate objective of EU integration and 
the attainment of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The proposed activities of the 
CAS are clustered around two pillars: (i) fostering economic growth through support to private 
sector development; and (ii) improved service delivery, particularly in the social sectors. 
Governance will be mainstreamed in all programs and projects supported by the CAS through 
the use of clearly defined criteria for evaluating the design and impact of all Bank interventions. 
The CAS will employ a selected mix of Bank and IFC financing and a targeted program of WBG 
Analytical and Advisory Activities (AAA) support.  

II. COUNTRY CONTEXT

Political and Social Context  

3. 
For the fifth time since 1990 Albanian citizens successfully selected 140 members of 
Parliament, through national elections held in July 2005.2 The elections process was conducted 
in line with the Electoral Code and adhered to fundamental democratic principles.3 The voting 
process itself was peaceful and demonstrated improvements over previous parliamentary 
elections, but the vote counting process and finalization of results witnessed considerable delays 
and faced technical and administrative problems. The Democratic Party (DP), led by ex-
President Sali Berisha, emerged as the largest party in the new Parliament with 56 seats and 
consequently formed the new Government in a broad coalition with other smaller parties. The

DP platform for the elections and its current program focus on improving governance and the 
rule of law, reducing corruption and breaking monopolies, improving the business environment, 
accelerating rural development and fostering human capital development. Dr. Berisha was 
elected as Prime Minister in September 2005. The transfer of power was smooth and the new  
government has since consolidated the number of ministries in an effort to rationalize public 
spending and to improve coordination within the public administration. The new government 
confirmed its strong commitment to accelerating Albania’s efforts towards integration in the EU 
(through the SAp) and NATO structures, the implementation of the NSSED (Albania’s PRSP), 
and the integration of the various existing policy frameworks into a single medium term 
development plan through the Integrated Planning System (IPS).  

4. 
The Socialist Party (SP) now forms the major opposition party. Though the SP-led 
governments changed four times during 1997-2004, a good record in economic management and 
in the formulation and implementation of the NSSED was maintained. The split in the leadership 
of the SP and the formation in September 2004 of the independent Socialist Movement for 
Integration (SMI), by ex-Premier Ilir Meta, contributed partly to the loss of the SP’s majority in 
the 2005 parliamentary elections. Following the resignation of the former prime minister, Mr. 
Fatos Nano, from the leadership of SP, the party elected the Mayor of Tirana, Mr. Edi Rama, as 
its new leader in October 2005 and reviewed its platforms in preparation for the local elections in 
2006. Political polarization and strong rivalry between the two largest parties (DP and SP) 
remain sources of potential instability, and represent hurdles for forging a national consensus for 
necessary reforms to accelerate the pace of economic development and successful integration in 
the EU. 

5. 
The decentralization process gained considerable momentum in the last five years.4 
Although Albania started on a path of political decentralization in 1992, the pace of devolution 
picked up markedly in the last five years because of the strong demand for improving public 
service delivery, governance and accountability in the use of public resources, and strengthening 
local autonomy. Following the ratification of the European Charter for Local Self-Local 
Government and the adoption of the Law on the Functioning and Organization of Local Self-
Government in 2000, a Government Decentralization Implementation Strategy was approved, 
and good progress has since been made in establishing institutional arrangements for 
implementation of the strategy. The major achievements in the last three years include: (i) 
completion of the basic legislative framework for territorial administration; (ii) implementation 
of the existing regulation on local government property rights; (iii) assignment of specific 
responsibilities and authorities to local governments—including those concerning shared-
functions; (iv) assignment of an adequate degree of revenue autonomy to local authorities, and 
establishment of an equalization transfer mechanism to minimize bureaucratic and political 
influence; and (v) adoption of a training strategy for local public officials. 

6. 
However, the decentralization process is still hampered by several constraints. Though 
confidence in local governments is increasing and a few municipalities and communes have been 
able to achieve tangible results in service delivery and urban development (e.g., the Municipality 

4  For a detailed review on progress in decentralization in Albania and the remaining challenges, see World Bank 
(2004) “Albania: Decentralization in Transition”. Report No. 27885-ALB, Poverty Reduction and Economic 
Management Unit, Europe and Central Asia Region, the World Bank; February 2004.

of Tirana), the implementation of reforms to successfully decentralize fiscal and administrative 
decisions has been uneven and is lagging behind schedule. There are still institutional 
weaknesses and low implementation capacity which limit the voice and participation of citizens 
in local affairs as well as the transparency, and accountability of local governments. Political 
resistance and bureaucratic stumbling blocks also continue to delay the pace of decentralization. 
The specific competencies of regions, municipalities and communes need more clarification, 
especially for shared functions, to avoid inefficiencies and duplication or under-provision of 
services. The drafting of the new Law on Local Budget and the new Law on Local Finance 
(including the badly needed national tax sharing arrangement) is still pending. The fragmentation 
of local government units and the undefined role of the regions complicate a uniform attribution 
of responsibilities and affects local public service delivery efficiency, fiscal transparency and 
fiduciary accountability.  

7. 
Albania has also made good progress in improving social sector outcomes. In addition 
to economic and political transformation, Albania is also on track to meet the MDGs particularly 
those related to social sector outcomes, although data constraints precludes comprehensive 
analysis of the post-transition trends (Box 1). Albania’s current demographic profile is 
characterized by three main phenomena: large internal and external migratory waves, improving 
mortality rates and declining fertility rates. The population’s age structure has changed 
significantly in the past decade. The population below 15 years of age is now decreasing and the 
population over 65 years is growing faster than the rest of the adult population. Though 
population growth and fertility rates have been falling, Albania still has one of the highest 
fertility rates and the youngest population in Europe.5 The Albanian population remains 
predominantly rural, although the cities, particularly Tirana, have grown very rapidly over the 
past 15 years. The labor force began the transition balanced by gender but has shown a growing 
preponderance of males. It is mostly rural (65 percent) and 62 percent have less than secondary 
education. Labor force participation rates dropped by 14 and 19 percentage points for males and 
females respectively between 1993 and 2003. Unemployment remains widespread (officially 
estimated at 14.4 percent in 2004, down from 15 percent in 2003) especially in urban areas 
despite marked declines in registered unemployment in the last decade.6 

8. 
Most health and education indicators have continued to improve over the past decade. 
Current health outcomes compare favorably with those of lower middle income countries outside 
Europe and Central Asia (ECA) region, but lag behind those of other countries in SEE. Despite 
recent progress, Albania still has the lowest healthy life expectancy and the highest infant 
mortality rates in SEE. Albania achieved universal enrollment rate in basic education at the start 
of transition, but began with among the poorest enrollment rates in secondary and tertiary 
education in the region. Between 1990 and 2002, gross enrollment rates declined at all levels of 
education except for higher education.7 In the last three years, modest improvements in 
enrolments rates at all education levels have been recorded. 

5  Albania’s total population is estimated at 3.1 million in 2004 and is projected to increase to 3.7 million by 2025. 
An estimated 0.8 – 1.0 million Albanians currently live outside of Albania.  
6  Between 1993 and 2003, registered unemployment fell by 46 percent.  
7  Between 1989 and 2002, gross enrollment rate declined from 103 percent to 99.6 percent for basic education, and 
- more drastically - from 78.5 percent to 43.6 percent in secondary education (mainly due to the closure of many 
secondary vocational training schools). During the same period, gross enrollment rates in higher education rose 
significantly from 6.6 percent to 17 percent mainly as a result of expansion in part-time enrollments.

The SEE countries have already achieved or are likely to achieve over half of the MDGs, though some countries 
have vulnerability with regard to meeting few of the MDGs. The MDG on HIV/AIDS and other diseases is the 
major regional concern.  
Albania is on track to meet all of the MDGs, though data constraints renders this assessment tentative.  
MDG1 (Eradicate poverty and hunger): Albania is on track to meet the poverty MDG. However, the country 
has only one nationally representative survey in many years (LSMS, 2002) to provide the first reliable estimate 
of poverty (with a consumption module). The LSMS 2005 will enable better assessment of the trend next year. 
MDG2 (Achieve universal primary education) and MDG3 (promote gender equity and empower women): The 
official national enrollment rates and primary completion rates tend to suggest that the MDG target for 
education is likely to be met. The most recent LSMS, however, produces an enrolment rate of 93 percent. On 
the basis of the most recent data, the Gender MDG target is also likely to be met. The high girl/boy completion 
rate (grade 8), however, indicates that there may be a problem with boys leaving school early. 
MDG4 (reduce child mortality – U5MR) and MDG5 (improve maternal health-MMR): While the apparent 
downward trend in U5MR is encouraging, there is not enough data and evidence to conclude that the MDG 
target for child mortality will be met. Immunization rates for measles and DTP3 are showing slight increases. 
Administrative MMR data point to a declining trend over recent years (though estimates of UNICEF, UNFPA 
and WDI point to increases in MMR). Static health spending along with poorly performing prenatal care, 
hospital network and referral systems makes achievement of these goals less certain than others. 
MDG6 (Combat HIV/AIDs, Malaria and other diseases-HIV infection rates and Tuberculosis incidence): 
Albania is on track to meet the MDG target regarding Tuberculosis. However, while the current HIV/AIDS 
levels appear low, Albania is a high risk population and the number of cases is rising rapidly. 
MDG7 (ensure environmental sustainability – proportion of people with access to improve water sources): 
While WHO-UNICEF data indicate that this target is likely to be met, the most recent LSMS data implies that 
there is still some way to go to meet it.

Economic Developments since the Last CAS 

9. 
Albania succeeded in sustaining high rates of economic growth and pursuing 
structural reforms in the last three years. After a slowdown in 2002 caused by electricity 
shortages and floods, output growth recovered to 5.7 percent in 2003 and 5.9 percent in 2004.8 
Aggregate demand (consumption and investment), supported by external aid flows and 
remittances, have been the driving forces behind GDP growth. Export growth also accelerated, 
underpinned by favorable weather conditions, which benefited both agriculture and agro-
processing, and by a pick-up in tourism. Favorable weather conditions also resulted in 

8  See the CAS Completion Report (Annex 1) for economic developments during 1990-2002. Albania has also been 
benefiting from IMF support in the form of post-conflict emergency assistance program (November 1997) and two 
ESAF/PRGF arrangements (1998-2001, 2002-2005).

improvements in power generation. In the last three years, structural reforms have progressed, 
particularly in areas of privatization, financial sector development, energy reforms and trade 
liberalization. The privatization process advanced significantly with the successful privatization 
of the Savings Bank in December 2003, followed by steps to privatize public enterprises in the 
insurance, telecom and oil sectors expected to be completed in 2006. Electricity sector reforms 
have substantially reduced the vulnerability of the economy to external shocks, including 
through increased production and improved collection. Albania continues to implement its 
commitments under the WTO and has signed and ratified Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) with 
all neighboring countries. In other key areas of structural reforms however, progress remains 
slower than desired, including reforms in the business environment for the private sector, 
infrastructure services, and the quality of public sector management.

10. Macroeconomic stability in Albania has been maintained since 2002. Monetary and 
financial policies have curbed inflation, fostered confidence in the national currency and spurred 
credit to the private sector. Monthly inflation rates have been maintained within the 2–4 percent 
target range. Confidence in the national currency has improved as reflected in the steady 
appreciation of the Lek. This was mainly driven by the favorable macroeconomic outlook, large 
inflows of official assistance, private remittances and growing, though limited, foreign direct 
investment (FDI). The Savings Bank’s privatization and the easing of the monetary policy stance 
through a steady lowering of interest rates, has contributed to a rapid pick-up in private sector 
credit growth, albeit from a low base. 

11. 
Nonetheless, the quality of fiscal adjustment has not seen marked improvements. First, 
the efficiency of public spending remains low particularly in the social sectors. Second, while 
fiscal consolidation has been successful in reducing large public sector deficits, expenditures on 
priority areas have often fallen short of the stated objectives under the NSSED. The overall 
budget deficit (after grants) declined from 7.9 percent of GDP in 2001 to 5.1 percent in 2004. In 
parallel, the total public debt to GDP ratio fell from nearly 67 percent to about 56.6 percent 
during the same period. Sustained economic growth, falling interest rates, and the use of

privatization proceeds to retire public debt have all contributed to the decline in debt ratios. This 
improvement notwithstanding, the reduction in the deficit resulted largely from a decline in 
capital spending, and has slightly affected spending on education, which declined from 3.3 
percent of GDP in 2001 to 3.1 percent in 2004. In almost every year, revenues fell short of 
projections, remaining almost constant as a share of GDP. Weak tax and customs administration 
capacities and a large informal sector and lack of tax compliance, resulted in a tax to GDP ratio 
among the lowest in transition economies. The Government has recently redoubled its efforts to 
address these problems, and achieved a current surplus for the first time since transition. The 
2005 budget also included measures to reduce public sector borrowing requirements and improve 
the realism of revenue forecasting. The program of the new Government focuses on widening the 
tax base and reducing tax evasion as well as improving tax administration.9 

12. 
A broad-based export-driven output growth has not yet taken root. Improvements in the 
external position notwithstanding, Albania’s trade deficit remains at relatively high levels and 
the country is lagging behind other SEE countries in terms of openness as measured by the ratio 
of trade to GDP. Exports picked up with an annual real growth rate of 19 percent in 2003-2004. 
This expansion, however, has a narrow base and is heavily concentrated in low value added 
exports, despite productivity gains resulting from an increasingly open trade regime and greater 
economic liberalization.10 Consequently, the trade deficit remains relatively large at 22 percent 
of GDP. Remittances, at around 14 percent of GDP, still constitute the main source of financing 
the trade deficit. FDI remains among the lowest in the region (less than 3 percent of GDP). 
While the current account balance declined from 7.0 percent of GDP in 2002 to 3.8 percent in 
2004, expectations of a reduction in concessional external financing, and the hardening of 
borrowing terms, remain key challenges. The sustainability of FDI trends remains fragile, as the 
privatization program is nearing completion and improvements in the business climate have been 
slow.  

C. 

Albania’s Poverty Profile 

13. 
Poverty is still widespread 
despite more than a decade of 
sustained GDP growth. About 25 
percent of the Albanian population 
(780,000 
individuals) 
had 
consumption 
levels below 
the 
poverty line in 2002 (Figure 1). 
The distribution of consumption 
suggests that a large number of 
individuals are clustered around 
the poverty lines. In the event of an 
exogenous shock increasing the

9  Tax revenues range from 30 percent to 50 percent of GDP in the region. In Albania, the level of tax rates is in line 
with regional and international standards. However, collection of the personal income and the social security taxes 
has been the lowest performers [IMF (2002) “Albania: Selected Issues in Tax Design”. IMF -February 2004]. 
10  The vast majority of Albanian exports and imports have been destined to or originating in the EU (around 90% 
and 70 % respectively), while exports to SEE countries accounted for only 0.8 percent of total exports in 2003.

Lek 4,891 per capita per month to Lek 5,380) the proportion of the population counted as poor 
would be expected to increase from a quarter to a third. However, little extreme poverty - defined 
as the proportion of the population with a monthly income of no more than Lek 3,050 (the food 
poverty line) - exists. In 2002, only 5 percent of the population was estimated to be extremely 
poor. Inequality in Albania is also modest - an observation confirmed by a moderate Gini 
coefficient of 0.28 and a ratio of 90th to 10th percentile consumption of 3.6.11 

14. Most of the poor people are concentrated in the Mountain region. The 2002 Living 
Standard Measurement Survey (LSMS) and detailed poverty mapping, using the Population and 
Housing Census of 2001, lead to three conclusions regarding the spatial dimensions of poverty. 
First, rural poverty is significantly higher than urban poverty, by a factor of at least 10 
percentage points. Rural residents comprise more than two-thirds of the two poorest 
consumption quintiles. Second, the Mountain region (the North and the North-east agro-
ecological area) has the worst poverty outcomes of four well-defined regions (Tirana, Coastal, 
Central and Mountain). Almost one-half of the population in this area is poor and one in five (20 
percent) cannot meet basic food needs (Figure 2). Finally, within prefectures, Dibra, Kukes, 
Lezhe and Shkodra exhibit the highest levels of head count poverty, with more than one-third of 
the population living below the poverty line.  

FIGURE 2: SPATIAL DIMENSION OF 
POVERTY IN ALBANIA, 2002 

15. 
Unemployment and low level of education 
attainments are the main factors driving poverty. 
While household size is a strong indicator of 
poverty, 
employment 
status 
and 
education 
attainment are important determinants of poverty in 
Albania. Households with unemployed heads of 
household have poverty rates that are twice as high 
as in those in which the head of the household is 
employed. In Tirana, 32 percent of the unemployed 
heads of households are poor, compared to 16 
percent among employed heads of households. In 
rural areas the corresponding figures are 51 percent 
and 28 percent respectively. Among the poor, only 
20 percent of children enroll in secondary education 
compared to 50 percent among the non-poor. 
Individuals 
employed 
in 
agriculture 
had 
significantly higher poverty rates (29 percent), 
compared to the self-employed and wage earners 
(11 percent and 14 percent respectively). Poverty 
affects women more than men and is widespread among minorities in Albania. The small 
communities of Roma and self-identified "Egyptians” have been negatively affected by the 
transition. They are now the poorest and most marginalized people in the country.12

16. 
Non-income dimensions of poverty are also pervasive. There are significant differences 
in access and quality of basic social and infrastructure services. In rural and Mountain region 
areas, both basic coverage and quality of services, such as education, health care, transportation, 
running water and sanitation, are low. Less than 50 percent of rural households have running 
water or toilets. While coverage of these services is nearly universal in urban areas, there is 
evidence of quality failures, especially in peri-urban areas where families moving from deprived 
regions have overcrowded already inadequate school systems and health facilities. The dynamics 
of poverty in the last three years cannot be accurately determined. The additional LSMS data sets 
collected in 2003 and 2004 did not include a consumption module, making it difficult to follow 
consumption and poverty trends since 2002. However, a new LSMS is currently being finalized 
with a consumption module. This will provide information to infer the recent poverty dynamics.  

III. ALBANIA’S LONG-TERM VISION, MEDIUM-TERM PLANS, AND OUTLOOK  

A. 

Albania’s Long-Term Vision and European Integration 

17. 
Albania has articulated its long-term vision of joining the EU since it began its 
transition. Since 1991, successive Albanian governments have placed the prospect of European 
accession at the top of their agendas (Annex 9). The country is currently engaged in a 
Stabilization and Association process (SAp) with the EU.13 Primary aspects of the SAp dialogue 
include provisions for: (i) strengthening of the judicial system, rule of law and public 
administration; (ii) fighting against organized crime, trafficking and corruption; (iii) ensuring the 
proper functioning of democracy (including elections) and preserving political stability; (iv) 
improvement in human and minority rights; (v) further formalization and reform of the economy, 
as well as increased fiscal sustainability through more efficient customs and tax administrations; 
(vi) regional cooperation and reduced barriers to trade and foreign investment; and (vii) 
approximation of Albanian legislation to EU legislation in a wide range of areas.  

B. 

The National Strategy for Social and Economic Development (NSSED) 

18. 
The NSSED is an inclusive development strategy. The NSSED, adopted in 2001, aims to 
bring Albania’s living standards and income levels closer to the levels of its neighboring 
European countries. It represents Albania’s serious effort to use a comprehensive medium-term 
national development strategy to move from short-term crisis management to creating the 
conditions that promote long-term growth and poverty reduction. The NSSED has strong 
government ownership and was prepared through an unprecedented participatory process. It is 
based on three pillars: (i) improving governance, (ii) promoting private sector development, and 
(iii) fostering human resources development. The NSSED recognizes that weak governance and 
institutions are at the root of Albania’s developmental problems, and acknowledges that 
economic growth will be the main instrument to reduce poverty, raise standards of living, and 
accelerate the attainment of the MDGs. It also contains improved poverty diagnostics and an 
ambitious plan for monitoring and evaluation.  

13  See Annex 9 for more detail of Albania’ relations with the EU and progress under the SAp.

19. 
Good progress has been made in implementation of the NSSED in the last three years. 
The third Annual Progress Report of the NSSED, submitted to the World Bank and the IMF in 
FY06, highlighted progress with regard to the increased focus on poverty reduction and support 
to the social sectors, improved alignment of the NSSED with the SAp and the MDG frameworks, 
and efforts to improve the linkages between the strategy, the Medium-Term Budget Process 
(MTBP) and the annual budget. It underlines the need to continue structural reforms aimed at 
maintaining economic stability and improving public service delivery. However, challenges 
remain including weaknesses in the overall system of public expenditure management, persistent 
weaknesses in the identification of priority projects by line ministries, and poor capacities for 
implementation, monitoring and evaluation.14 The recent adoption of the IPS confirmed the 
Government’s commitment to modernize and upgrade strategic planning, and strengthen public 
expenditure management by linking resources to outcomes and gradually moving towards 
performance based budgeting. The third NSSED progress report outlines the details of the new 
planning architecture as the basis upon which the new NSSED will be built. 

BOX 2: THE INTEGRATED PLANNING SYSTEM (IPS) 

Albania’s Integrated Planning System (IPS), approved by the Council of Ministers in April 2005, was the result of a 
10-month collaborative process between the Government and donors. Initially, the mutually-agreed objective was 
to increase the effectiveness of external assistance. The government’s assessment, however, endorsed by donors, 
concluded that external assistance problems could not be treated in isolation from design and execution flaws in the 
broader government planning system. In preceding years, numerous planning frameworks, including the NSSED, 
SAp, MTBP, NATO accession, the Government Program, and the annual legislative plan were implemented as 
separate exercises, each with its own set of priorities, procedures and reporting requirements. Not surprisingly, this 
produced multiple priorities, overlapping processes, an excessive reporting burden in ministries, and public 
confusion. The overriding goal of the IPS is not to overlay yet another new planning system; rather it was designed 
to serve as a unifying framework for existing systems. Key elements include: 
• Creation of a political mechanism - the Strategic Planning Committee - chaired by the Prime Minister, to provide 
strategic policy and fiscal planning directions; 
• Establishment of a Government Modernization Program that may eventually include related initiatives, such as 
functional reviews, e-government and service quality improvement; 
• Transformation of the NSSED into a government-wide, strategic planning process, incorporating EU and NATO 
integration, MDGs, the Government Program, decentralization and other cross-cutting strategies; 
• Restoration of the MTBP as the exclusive process through which all cross-cutting and sector strategies compete 
for funding and are translated into concrete plans, budgets, and expected results; 
• Establishment of more strategic and comprehensive public investment and external assistance planning and 
financial management processes; 
• Restructuring of central institutions with planning mandates: moving NSSED to the Council of Ministers; 
transferring public investment and external assistance functions from the Ministry of Economy to the Ministry of 
Finance; creating an integrated delivery function (planning, budgeting, monitoring) within line ministries; 
• Institutionalization of the Government-donor coordinating mechanisms to ensure ongoing collaboration and 
effective deployment of external assistance. 
Implementation of the IPS is a daunting task and will confront a range of challenges despite the firm commitment 
of the new government on its implementation and the strong support of all development partners. If, however, IPS 
is implemented at a measured pace over the next 3-5 years, a more coherent and stable policy environment will 
emerge. For decision makers, the IPS will identify a series of clear decision points, where similar decisions (e.g., 
setting strategic priorities) are taken concurrently and competitively across all planning frameworks. For donors, the 
IPS will create a single point of initial contact and a demand-driven system where external assistance proposals 
flow from stated government priorities. For the public, the IPS will produce a single, annual published plan and 
corresponding set of results for each ministry.

20. 
The NSSED program for 2005-2006 focuses on pro-poor growth. Based on the pillars 
of improving governance and sustaining high economic growth— the NSSED program for the 
next two years focuses on economic growth to foster demand for labor as a key to broader 
participation in the benefits of economic growth. It underlines the need to promote private sector 
development by improving the investment climate and strengthening governance structures. It 
places heavy emphasis on education, health care, and infrastructure as priority areas for 
addressing key non-income dimensions of poverty, and to provide a sound basis for long-term 
growth and competitiveness. It also recognizes the need for stronger public accountability and 
increased public participation in decision making to empower the poor.  

21. 
The program of the new Government builds on the SAp and implementation of the 
NSSED and the IPS (Box 2). In the short-term, the new Government program (‘me duar të 
pastra’ – with clean hands) will focus on governance reforms including reduction of corruption 
and organized crime, breaking monopolies, improving the business climate, and continuation of 
administrative reforms. The Government program also accords special attention to preserving 
macroeconomic stability, supporting rural development and social sectors and upgrading of 
infrastructures. It gives special attention to the reforms of the education and health services and 
social inclusion particularly for the Roma people. It also seeks to deepen reforms in the energy 
sector, address the electricity shortages and rapidly open up the telecommunications markets. 

C. 

The Medium-Term Economic Outlook 

22. 
Albania could achieve relatively healthy growth in the medium-term. Despite stiffer 
international competition, the prospects for high and sustained growth are good, provided that 
structural reforms are stepped up in various areas. During the CAS period, macroeconomic 
performance is assumed to be sustained, predicated on the following assumptions: (i) continued 
fiscal consolidation and improvements in the quality of fiscal adjustment conducive to private 
investment; (ii) acceleration of structural reforms aimed at improving the business environment, 
the quality of infrastructure and public sector governance; and (iii) a relatively favorable external 
environment that would help boost export growth. In the medium-term, sustaining high GDP 
growth rates is conditional on an increase in aggregate demand, coupled with higher productivity 
and exports. The combination of prudent macroeconomic policies and strong structural reforms 
is projected to facilitate a rise in gross domestic investment (both public and private) from 23.8 
percent of GDP in 2004 to 27.1 percent in 2009. This increased investment would be supported 
by higher public and private domestic savings, with most of the increase taking place on the 
public sector side. Current transfers from abroad (remittances) and factor incomes will continue 
to be a major contributor to private national savings, but will increasingly be replaced by 
domestically-generated private sector savings, thus reducing Albania’s current over-reliance on 
external inflows. The increasing capacity to save and invest will be facilitated by bank and 
enterprise sector reforms, fiscal consolidation, and increased competitiveness.  

23. 
The overall budgetary balance will continue its gradual improvement. Through the 
pursuit of prudent fiscal measures, the overall fiscal deficit is projected to improve from 5.1 
percent of GDP in 2004 to 3.1 percent of GDP in 2009. The public sector contribution to growth

would result from a gradual reduction in current spending, primarily due to reduced subsidies 
and operational costs, broadly matched by an expansion in capital expenditure, from 5.2 percent 
of GDP in 2004 to 6.1 percent in 2009. Expenditure policies would also focus on improving 
efficiency in the use of resources, and better prioritization of investments. On the revenue side, 
improved tax collection and a gradual expansion of the tax base (the major thrust of the program 
of the new government) would increase revenues by at least 1 percentage point of GDP by 2009.   

24. 
Financing needs are projected to increase, and will gradually rely on access to non-
concessional financing. Total gross external financing needs are on average slightly above US$ 
1 billion per year during 2006-2009. These are required to finance: (i) large annual current 
account deficits amounting to roughly US$ 2.7 billion over the period; (ii) amortization of 
external debt of around US$ 502 million, and (iii) US$ 818 million of increases in net foreign 
reserves. With the envisaged improvement in the fiscal balance, these financing needs will be 
increasingly driven by private sector activity, as the expected fiscal retrenchment will leave more 
room for the private sector. The base case scenario envisages a steady inflow of FDI resources, 
although the pace will depend critically upon maintaining privatization efforts and further 
improving the environment for doing business. Net FDI is projected to finance up to 41 percent 
of total financing needs in 2006-2009, while long-term loans from multilateral, bilateral, and 
other creditors are projected to account for 20 percent (Table 2).

25. World Bank analysis concludes that Albania can gradually increase non-concessional 
borrowing without worsening debt indicators over time. Albania needs to implement economic 
and financial policies measures in order to mobilize internal resources and to allow the country 
to achieve creditworthiness and gradually tap market-based external resources. To maintain 
fiscal and external sustainability in the medium term, the country has to focus on: (i) furthering 
fiscal consolidation and improving the quality of the ongoing fiscal adjustment, (ii) substantially 
improving the strategic management of debt, to reduce rollover risk for domestic debt and 
smoothen out repayment flows, and (iii) deepening structural reforms aimed at increasing 
exports and investment flows. Under the base-case scenario Albania could secure its financing 
needs while maintaining solvency and liquidity indicators below standard sustainability 
thresholds over the next decade. By gradually replacing short-term and higher cost domestic 
borrowing with longer-term and lower cost external financing, while lengthening the maturity of

domestic debt stock, the ratio of total public debt to GDP would decline from around 55.9 
percent in 2005 to 53.5 percent in 2009. The ratio of external debt to GDP would decline only 
marginally to stay at a reasonably low level of 18.5 percent by 2009, while that of domestic debt 
would be reduced from 37.7 percent to 35 percent over the CAS period (Annex 8).  

IV. ALBANIA’S DEVELOPMENT CHALLENGES 

A. 

Improving Governance Structures  

26. 
Further progress in poverty reduction, attainment of the MDGs and EU integration 
will largely depend on addressing governance concerns. Despite continued efforts and some 
recent progress, overall indicators of governance for Albania are at very low levels compared to 
other countries in the region and other lower middle-income countries. Governance problems 
continue to cloud Albania’s recent achievements and impact on the prospects of sustained 
economic growth (e.g., low investment) and improved public service delivery. Corruption, for 
example, has a direct impact on economic growth, FDI and quality and access to service delivery 
in Albania. The Government’s performance on combating corruption and crime has become a 
yardstick by which Albania’s readiness to progress towards EU accession will be measured.  

27. Weak governance is the major obstacle to improving the business climate. Pervasive 
corruption, weak enforcement of the rule of law, limited government effectiveness and 
inadequate regulatory quality are the main factors inhibiting private sector development. 
However, recent governance data collated from various sources do point to modest 
improvements in governance indicators in the period 2002 to 2004.15 Most positive is further 
strengthening of the public space that allows civil society and the media to voice their views. 
Regulatory quality is another dimension of governance on which Albania has made modest 
improvements, bringing it closer to comparator countries. Administrative reforms at the central 
government level are also beginning to have some positive impact. Recently, however, party 
politics appear to have become increasingly competitive, and Albania continues to perform far 
worse on political stability dimension of governance than other countries in the region. 

28. 
Control of corruption is the most pressing governance challenge for Albania. Survey 
results indicate that customs, courts and hospitals are the institutions with the highest perceived 
incidence of corruption, with analysis indicating that corruption of officials in Albania exceeds 
the levels experienced in other countries in the region.16 State capture is pervasive, and likely 
includes the infiltration of criminal elements in state entities. Respondents to opinion surveys in 
Albania identify corruption as a primary cause of the lack of growth in jobs, and express a 
general mistrust in political, legal and public sector institutions. Among public services, views 
about corruption in the health sector are particularly bleak.

B. Maintaining High Rates of Economic Growth 

29. 
Future sustainability of output growth hinges on export expansion, increased 
productivity and higher levels of factor accumulation. While Albania’s economy has been 
growing over the past decade at an average annual growth rate of 7 percent, the outlook for fast 
and sustained GDP growth, which is critical to bringing living standards closer to those of new 
EU member countries, faces several pivotal constraints.17 Poor governance in general is 
pervasive across all sectors of the economy. Inefficient public sector hinders improvements in 
the business environment. Quality of public services to support business is poor. Heavy reliance 
on remittances and weak export performance constrain macroeconomic stability. Educational 
attainments are lower than in most transition countries. Structural bottlenecks in infrastructure 
lead to high input costs and also reduce effectiveness of service delivery.  

30. Heavy reliance on remittances and weak export performance are the main economic 
challenges. A broad based expansion of tradable output has not yet taken place and non-tradable 
sectors have contributed to most of the growth since the beginning of transition. Despite far 
reaching measures to liberalize trade and integrate Albania with the regional and world markets, 
private investment, FDI and exports remain among the lowest in the region. Continuing high 
trade deficits reflect the poor climate for competitive production and also point to an over-
reliance on remittances for financing the persistent high current account deficit. While 
macroeconomic stability has been maintained, additional efforts are needed to reduce 
uncertainties and policy volatility. Public sector performance, and tax administration in 
particular, remains weak. This will entail addressing constraints to efficient expenditure 
management and prioritization, efficient tax administration and sustaining the steady increase in 
tax revenues which started over the past 5 years. And while the current levels of external 
indebtedness are moderate, the expected decline in concessional financing and access to 
international financial markets may gradually change in the medium term, requiring reforms to 
enhance competitiveness, export promotion and addressing risks posed by reliance on 
remittances.  

31. 
Future growth will increasingly rely on higher investment levels. With the recent 
slowing of total factor productivity growth from post-transition reallocation, future growth will 
have to increasingly rely on increased factor accumulation and sectoral increases in total factor 
productivity (as opposed to productivity gains from resource reallocation). Albania’s investment 
to GDP ratio declined from 21 percent in 1995 to around 16 percent in 1998. It then picked up 
gradually until it peaked in 2001 at about 29 percent. However, the ratio continued to decline in 
the last four years until it reached 23.8 percent in 2004. Continued economic stability and 
concerted efforts to enhance the investment climate are critical for raising foreign and domestic 
investment levels. 

32. 
Investment and growth prospects in Albania largely hinge on improvements in the 
business climate. A weak business environment is undermining future growth prospects as the 
private sector is expected to take a more prominent role in ensuring sustainable growth and job 
creation. The business environment is plagued with considerable administrative barriers, weak 
governance, corruption, ambiguities in property and land rights, poor quality and high cost of

Memorandum; Washington D.C.; December 2004.

infrastructure and utilities combine to increase the cost of doing business and limit access to 
credit and financial services. These constraints represent major barriers for firms to grow despite 
improvements in entry/exit regulations.18 In the past few years, with the support from FIAS, the 
Government has undertaken a number of measures which has reduced administrative barriers in 
2004 compared with 2002. This progress notwithstanding, design flaws, corrupt practices and 
harassment in tax and custom collection contribute to unfair competition between firms by 
providing incentives for evasion. Instability and poor enforcement of laws and regulations in 
most areas of business activity reduce government accountability and increase the scope for 
discretion. The information available on regulations is inadequate and of poor quality. An 
ineffective competition policy regime contributes to the proliferation of monopolistic behaviors 
and unfair practices. Weak capacity of the ex-ante sectoral regulators, delays in establishing 
secondary legislation and regulations for the utilities sector, and lack of coordination between 
sectoral regulators and the Competition Authority continue to impede the efficient operations of 
markets, and reduce the benefits of market liberalization. Albania’s competitiveness also suffers 
from a national Metrology, Standardization, Testing and Quality (MSTQ) system that is obsolete 
and not in line with the European norms. 

33. 
Financial intermediation remains weak. Albania has made significant progress towards 
the adoption of a market-based economy and almost the entire financial sector is in private 
hands. Despite recent increases in bank lending, with a loan-to-GDP ratio of 8.1 percent in 2004, 
the level of banking intermediation in Albania remains the lowest in Europe. Although the legal, 
institutional and supervisory framework for the financial sector is in line with international 
practices, implementation is weak, especially in the insurance sector. Financial intermediation 
suffers from a business environment not conducive to robust and sound lending practices. The 
poor transparency and management practices and unreliable financial reporting of private 
enterprises coupled with uncertainty over property rights hinder secured lending. 

34. 
Despite recent efforts, difficulties in land tenure and title registration persist. Land 
privatization, registration of ownership rights, and urban and coastal land use planning have been 
addressed by the Government and donors in a piece-meal fashion. Key laws such as the Law on 
Land Restitution and the Law on Legalization of Informal Settlement have been passed during 
the last 12 months but implementation is likely to be difficult due to a lack of consultation with 
stakeholders and absence of detailed implementation guidelines. Since the completion of a 
USAID-financed Land Registration Project, progress in the land registration process has been 
slow. While registration of land in rural areas has advanced over the past years, land and 
property registration has been particularly slow in valuable urban and coastal areas, resulting in 
tedious, costly, and time consuming transactions. Legal and administrative procedures for 
resolving ownership disputes are inadequate, contributing to a lack of secure and unambiguous 
property rights. The capacity of the Immovable Property Registration Service (IPRS) remains 
weak despite progress in reforming it since 1990. There also remains a serious problem in urban 
and coastal areas with illegal construction and dubious zoning practices. These factors all 
contribute to high transaction costs, inefficient resource use, and a preponderance of informal 
land and property markets. They also constitute a major impediment to access to finance.

35. 
Poor infrastructure lowers the marginal productivity of private capital in Albania. In 
the transport sector, the overall quality of the infrastructure is poor, raising the time and money 
costs of transportation, reducing competitiveness and increasing poverty. The identification and 
selection of projects in the sector remains non-transparent and in many cases does not reflect 
NSSED priorities. Limited capacity, absence of a clear accountability framework in many of the 
public institutions within the sector, and insufficient emphasis on maintaining existing transport 
networks has resulted in an inappropriate balance between recurrent and capital expenditures. 
The responsibilities for managing and maintaining the local road network were decentralized to 
the 36 administrative districts, communes and municipalities in 1996, but the capacity, resources 
and finances necessary to undertake this role are still inadequate. This has resulted in growing 
concerns over road safety in the country. In the energy sector, recurrent power shortages still 
represent a pivotal impediment for private sector activity. Inadequate and unreliable electricity 
supply continues despite marked improvements in the energy situation, due to the poor stock of 
electricity 
infrastructure 
(generation, 
transmission and distribution), over-reliance on 
hydropower, and poor cost recovery for electricity supply. 

36. 
A lack of policy response to rapid urbanization is becoming a major threat to 
sustainable development. Albania does not yet have an urban development strategy or plans to 
define urban management tasks at the central, regional and local levels. Urban areas suffer from 
serious deficiencies in essential infrastructure, causing considerable environmental damage and 
decreasing productivity. At the same time, capacity and governance at the municipality level 
remains inadequate and results in inefficient use of resources. The challenge is compounded by 
emerging large informal settlements around urban areas in the central region and in the coastal 
areas, which threatens good tourism potential.  

37. 
Productivity in the agricultural sector is low. The agricultural sector employed 58 
percent of the labor force in 2004. It has high potential for increased productivity, exports and 
consequently for reducing rural poverty. Currently, agricultural activities are hampered by farm 
fragmentation, limited irrigation services, weak institutions managing water resources, poor 
quality of extension services, an overly restrictive regulatory framework for seeds, and poor 
market infrastructure. In the fisheries sub-sector, infrastructure is dilapidated and the institutional 
framework for the management of fishery resources remains weak, preventing the exploitation of 
aquaculture potential and the utilization of fishery resources in a sustainable manner. 

38. 
Improvements in Albania’s living standards thus require implementation of a 
comprehensive reform agenda. The recent Country Economic Memorandum19 concluded that 
sustained output growth in Albania would require adoption and implementation of a 
comprehensive reforms program based on the following major themes: 

• Maintaining a stable macroeconomic framework, notably through continued adherence to 
fiscal discipline, creation of fiscal space while pursing fiscal consolidation, reduction of 
debt stock aimed at raising public savings and the quality of public investment. This would 
require a focus on efficiency of current and planned spending and priority to recurrent and 
maintenance costs of existing infrastructure, and improving revenue mobilization efforts;

• Mobilizing human resources, by improving the quality, relevance and access to education, 
training and health care and facilitating the movement of labor to more productive and 
higher paying jobs; 
• Boosting trade and accelerating regional and European integration, in order to create a 
more favorable environment for FDI and to boost export prospects; 
• Upgrading public infrastructure, mainly by strengthening allocative efficiency through the 
systematic use of economic analysis in the prioritization of expenditures on infrastructure; 
price-setting to ensure cost recovery for public infrastructure services; sustained 
implementation of the Power Sector Action Plan, and implementation of the national and a 
rural water sector strategies; and, 
• Improving governance and strengthening institutions to ensure managerial integrity 
within the public administration; reliable, predictable and fair enforcement of the rule of 
law; and building mechanisms that can strengthen good governance by facilitating more 
effective ‘voice’ (feedback and monitoring) in service delivery. 

C. 

Improving Public Service Delivery 

39. 
The quality of, and access to, social services in Albania lag behind other countries in 
the region. Expenditures in the social sectors represented about 45 percent of total budgetary 
spending in 2004 (the largest part of the budget), with social protection attracting the largest 
share (25 percent), followed by education (10 percent) and health (9 percent). Despite these 
allocations, results have fallen below the objectives stated in the NSSED, and expected outcomes 
have not materialized. Previous and ongoing sector reviews, point to several shortcomings along 
the ‘service delivery production chain’, beginning from government policies and strategies, 
down to the translation of policies into budgetary allocations and delivery of services at the local 
level. 

40. 
Labor market outcomes – unemployment and migration – reflect skills mismatch and 
education inadequacies. The education system needs to prepare school leavers to effectively 
function in labor markets that contribute to strengthening Albania’s competitiveness. With an 
average school attainment of 8.5 years, the Albanian population lags substantially behind that of 
its neighbors and falls almost 6 years below the OECD average. Low average educational 
attainments are compounded by marked variations across regions and income groups. Gross 
enrollment rates at the primary and secondary levels declined in the rural and peri-urban areas in 
the post-transition period. Albanian students compare unfavorably with their peers in 
international achievement tests, pointing to the overall low quality of education. Key challenges 
facing the education sector are: (a) poor quality and weak relevance of education; (b) lack of 
access to educational establishments, especially in rural areas;20and (c) inadequate sectoral 
financing and lack of transparency in the resource allocation and budget execution.21 

41. 
The Albanian health sector requires fundamental reforms in service delivery, 
financing and sectoral governance. The health care system is ill prepared to face the increasing 

20  Almost 16 percent of the children between the ages of 14-17 years attributed their non-attendance at school to 
distance.

incidence of non-communicable diseases while also continuing to control infectious diseases. 
Physical and human resources are poorly aligned with the population’s health needs, productivity 
in the sector is low and resources are used inefficiently. The quality of health service delivery is 
low due to the combination of a highly centralized delivery system, weak technical skills, 
absence of appropriate governance structures and inadequate provider incentives. Despite recent 
progress, the sector continues to be afflicted by deteriorating physical infrastructure due to 
reduced spending on operations and maintenance, and, lack of clarity in the process of 
investment decision making. Public expenditure on health remains low (2.5 percent of GDP or 
US$ 51 per capita/year) by regional and international standards and is highly fragmented, with 
frequent shifts in financing responsibilities between central and local governments. Uncertainty 
in financing responsibilities provides ample room for abuse. Informal payments have 
proliferated, with substantial impact on the poor.22  

42. 
Coordinated policy reforms across the social insurance system are now critical. The 
financial stability of the social insurance system and the coverage and targeting of the social 
assistance system require attention. The social protection system absorbs almost one quarter of 
public expenditures. Social insurance contribution rates are high compared to other countries in 
the region (41.9 percent), which substantially increases labor costs and hampers the 
competitiveness of Albanian labor.23 The social insurance system’s fiscal imbalance is driven by 
large deficits in the rural pension system, a high dependency ratio and substantial uncertainty 
with respect to the contribution base. Despite its deficit, the rural pension system affords limited 
financial protection to its beneficiaries. Substantial contribution evasion is likely to lead to a 
decline in the pension system’s coverage in the medium to long run. The social insurance 
system’s fiscal fragility is further compounded by continuous pressures to reallocate 
contributions from social protection towards health insurance, although the capacity does not 
exist to assess the fiscal impact of such changes. Reforms of the social insurance system need to 
be synchronized with reforms of health financing. The effectiveness of the social assistance 
system is constrained by limited coverage, small benefits and ineffective targeting.  

43. 
Access and quality of water supply and sanitation services are also problematic. 
Although 80 percent of Albania’s urban population has access to piped water, supply is 
intermittent, and the quality of drinking water is far below internationally accepted standards. 
Inadequate maintenance and repairs and the absence of metering and operational control have 
resulted in water losses of over 50 percent of water production in cities. Despite recent progress 
in decentralization, governance and accountability in the sector remain in flux. The pace of 
transfer of water utilities’ assets and management responsibilities to local governments has been 
slow, and weak capacities of local governments for planning, implementing and monitoring 
performance of water companies constrain improvement in service delivery and quality.24 While 
the size of subsidies to water supply and sanitation services remains lower than 1 percent of 
GDP, poor cost recovery, combined with the slow pace of reform within the sector could 

22  Out-of-pocket health expenditures increase Albania’s poverty incidence by more than one third. 
23  World Bank (2004) “Albania: Social Safety Net Review”. Report No. 31011-AL; Human Development Sector 
Unit; Europe and Central Asia Region; the World Bank, Washington D.C.; 29 December 2004. 
24  The law assigns responsibility for water and sanitation services as an exclusive function to the local level, making 
municipalities and communes responsible for investment and operational decision-making of water and wastewater 
services in their jurisdictions. The central government retains responsibility for managing water resources, water 
quality, and regulation of water supply and wastewater services (e.g., service standards).

increase fiscal risks from arrears accumulation to the electricity company. Tariffs are far below 
cost recovery levels and are not based on metered consumption, encouraging thus over-
consumption. While most of the 52 utilities are running operational losses, the current subsidy 
system does not reward well-performing utilities and therefore does not make the most efficient 
use of scarce resources. Poor households are generally not connected to the water network and 
therefore do not benefit from subsidies to the sector. The situation in rural areas is worse: access 
to piped water supply has decreased from 75 percent in 1989 to 50 percent today, and areas 
without piped supply often rely on heavily contaminated sources. 

V. WORLD BANK GROUP’S CURRENT PORTFOLIO 

A. 

Past Bank Assistance and Quality and Management of the Existing Portfolio 

44. 
The World Bank Group partnership with Albania has continued to strengthen.  The 
WBG is the second largest donor to Albania after the EU. Since Albania joined the World Bank 
in 1991, IDA commitments to the country through 57 operations total approximately US$ 820 
million; IFC commitments have reached US$ 125 million, while MIGA’s net exposure totaled 
US$ 8.6 million. The WBG assistance to Albania during FY02-FY05 has been evaluated as 
satisfactory (see Annex 2 on the CAS Completion Report, Annex 3 and 4 on IFC and MIGA 
support program respectively). The proposed strategy both builds on the lessons of the previous 
CAS and relies on the existing portfolio of 15 projects to achieve the expected outcomes and 
results in the next four years. 

45. 
The quality of IDA’s current portfolio in Albania continues to improve. The portfolio 
has witnessed significant consolidation with the decline in the number of projects from 25 in 
FY02 to 15 by the end of FY05. Currently the portfolio does not contain any problem project and 
none of the projects is at risk (Table 3). For projects exiting between FY97 and FY04, OED rated 
89 percent of the project outcomes (by value) as satisfactory; 47 percent had substantial 
institutional development impact and 77 percent were considered to have likely sustainability.

From FY05, capacity is being mainstreamed with all new projects designed to be 
implemented through existing government structures. As highlighted by the recent OED CAE 
and the CAS Completion Report (Annex 1), the implementation of projects through Project 
Implementation Units (PIUs) has reduced the potential impact of projects on institutional

19

development and sustainability. An agreement was reached with the Government in late FY04 to 
implement, to the maximum extent possible, all new projects inside existing government 
structures. A key change is that a project authorizing person from government (at level of 
Director, Director General or Deputy Minister) is now assigned to oversee the implementation of 
each project. When necessary skills are lacking in the public administration, they will be 
externally contracted to assist in the project implementation (e.g., financial management, 
procurement, etc). Such expertise, however, will report to the project authorizing person and the 
concerned government agency or ministry. 

B. 

Albania’s Country Financing Parameters (CFPs) 

47. 
Country Financing Parameters (CFPs) for Albania were established in March 2005 
after consultation with the Government (see Annex 7).25 The CFPs for Albania provide for 
added flexibility in allowing Bank financing of up to 100 percent of project costs, although the 
level of Bank financing will be considered on a case by case basis. In aggregate it is expected 
that past financing patterns would continue broadly unchanged. The CFPs also allow recurrent 
cost financing on a selective basis, and Bank financing of local and foreign costs in any 
proportion. The CFP will greatly facilitate Bank operations in Albania and reduce the transaction 
costs of implementing Bank financed projects by allowing the avoidance of the complex regime 
for ensuring taxes and duties are not paid that has hitherto created major difficulties. The 
additional flexibility will support project implementation and is fully consistent with the 
approach of the CAS in emphasizing Government ownership of the underlying project 
objectives. The maximum flexibility allowed by the CFPs will nonetheless be applied 
selectively, in reflection of the different levels of mutual agreement on sector reforms and 
approaches across different areas, and with due regard to sustainability and fiduciary oversight.

A. 

Key Features and Pillars of the Results Based Assistance Strategy  

48. 
The WBG will support Albania in its efforts to meet its development objectives through 
various instruments. The proposed program is based on the NSSED, the priorities of the 
European integration and the SAp, the program of the new Government approved by Parliament 
in September 2005, and the results of consultations with the Government and other stakeholders. 
The CAS aims to support the Government around two core pillars: (i) continued economic 
growth through support to private sector development; and (ii) improved public service delivery. 
Improving governance and strengthening accountability mechanisms will be the main cross-
cutting objective and thematic focus of the entire support program which includes investment 
projects, a series of programmatic Development Policy Loans (DPLs),26 and a focused program 
of analytical support. 

25  Pursuant to the Bank’s policy on financing for investment projects (OP/BP 6.00, Bank Financing). 
26  While it is intended that the first two of the series would be IDA-financed Development Policy Credits, the 
Bank’s planned programmatic support is referred to collectively as Development Policy Loans (DPL) throughout 
this document.

(i) Mainstreaming Governance  

49. 
A ‘Governance Filter’ has been developed to ensure that the Bank consistently takes 
all opportunities to improve governance. In conjunction with the Results Matrix, the Bank will 
use four guiding principles to ensure governance considerations are mainstreamed into all its 
interventions in Albania: 
Principle I: Seek greater transparency in the use of public resources. This principle implies 
the need to work on strengthening the lines of accountability, improving transparency and 
participation in resource allocation and enabling better access to information by all 
stakeholders. Specific attention needs to be given to the functioning of oversight bodies, to 
procurement, to internal and external audit, to transparent financial reporting, to public-
private partnerships, and to the functioning of integrated planning and budgeting processes 
and their execution by government. In all WBG efforts, explicit attention will be paid to how 
well the annual and medium–term budget allocations are aligned with NSSED priorities and 
the transparency in the allocations and use of resources and project selection. 
Principle II: Support increased autonomy and de-politicization of key public sector 
counterpart organizations. Delineation between the political and administrative spheres in 
government is vital for improved public sector performance and the creation of a professional 
administration. Checks and balances between political and administrative institutions need to 
be effective. The Bank’s strategy to date of supporting initial civil service reform on a small 
scale has proven to be effective. These results need to be safeguarded and the practices of a 
merit-based bureaucracy need to be expanded to encompass a larger numbers of officials 
with direct involvement in service delivery, in particular in line ministries and in local 
governments. 
Principle III: Analyze the formal (and likely future) roles of local governments, and  
develop capacity -- and local mechanisms of accountability -- to enable local governments 
to effectively take on these roles. Local government needs to play a central role to improve 
service delivery, and there are opportunities to improve governance by strengthening local 
government. Albania has made progress in laying the foundations for decentralization and 
ongoing reform at the central level and in sectors will be implemented at the local 
government level in the next four years. Implementation of these reforms needs to be 
accompanied by a solid understanding of the constraints faced at this level of government.  
Principle IV: Strengthen mechanisms for advocacy and increased involvement of citizens 
(including nongovernmental stakeholders) to encourage improved performance of public 
service delivery and policy-making bodies. ‘Voice and accountability’ is a dimension of 
governance in which Albania performs well. There is a vibrant civil society and press, as 
well as demand and opportunity to express and discuss views publicly. The existing 
mechanisms need to be harnessed and strengthened by empowering communities, especially 
in service areas such as the management of schools and service delivery by hospitals. 
Strengthened stakeholder involvement is required as a corollary to decentralization.

BOX 3: STRENGTHENING GOVERNANCE IN THE BANK PORTFOLIO  

With significant concerns about weak governance in Albania and increased perceptions of corruption in recent 
surveys and public opinion polls, the World Bank Group is taking steps to improve monitoring and strengthen 
governance in its own portfolio. The following mitigation measures will be reinforced and enhanced during the 
implementation of the CAS to minimize such risks: 
A. Existing Measures to Minimize Corruption Risks in the Bank Portfolio: 
(i) Decentralization of more functions and responsibilities to the Country Office particularly in portfolio 
management (with gradual building of capacity in procurement and financial management). 
(ii) Continuous support to the auditing, procurement, supervisory and regulatory agencies. 
(iii) Continuous support to the demand side of governance and citizen-based mechanisms of transparency and 
accountability through CDD approaches and involvement of beneficiaries in development planning and the 
design, implementation and supervision of projects (e.g., irrigation, fisheries, public works, etc.). 
(iv) Assistance to the Government to institutionalize and scale-up the positive lessons from successful pilot 
projects that aim to enhance governance (e.g., Tirana Transparency Project) into more sectors and agencies. 
(v) Vigorous investigation and follow-up to any allegations of fraud and corruption in Bank projects through 
Department of Institutional Integrity (INT) and public disclosure of the results (e.g., debarment of 
individuals and companies in 2005 with regard to fraudulent practices in the Water Supply Urgent 
Rehabilitation Project). 
(vi) Capacity and risk assessments for each project at appraisal are undertaken to determine appropriate 
procurement thresholds for prior review. Action plans are prepared to build capacity of the implementing 
agencies during project implementation and subject to improvements, prior review thresholds may be 
increased. Extensive post reviews are conducted by procurement staff to ensure compliance. 
B. New Measures to be implemented during the CAS Period to Minimize Corruption Risks: 
(i) Diligent and consistent application of the “Governance Filter” and its four principles in all new programs. 
(ii) Consolidation of the portfolio by reducing the number of projects and increasing resources for supervision 
to ensure increased attention to fiduciary, procurement and financial management aspects of lending. 
(iii) Close linkages between the AAA program (particularly the Programmatic PER and Poverty Assessment) 
and lending support to ensure adequate attention to the efficient and transparent use of public resources and 
monitoring and evaluation of outcomes. 
(iv) Discontinue further support to sectors or agencies that do not make satisfactory progress towards necessary 
reforms and remedial measures. 
(v) Frequent use of pre-emptive audits and joint Government-Bank portfolio reviews. 
(vi) Increase the assistance to implementing agencies particularly in the case of difficult (e.g., complex 
technical specifications, multiple stage bidding) and significant (e.g., multiple packages, high value 
contracts) tenders. The evaluation committee could be assisted by international experts in the relevant field 
(possibly selected and/or funded by the Bank) in their review and recommendations for award.  
(vii) Implementation of the revised procurement guidelines which promote greater transparency in the bidding 
process by application of new disclosure policy on contract awards.  

50. 
The entire WBG support program will address governance weaknesses. The use of the 
four principles of the ‘Governance Filter’ will underpin the design of the projects, the substance 
of AAA support, the reform agenda to be supported by the DPL, and the supervision, monitoring 
and implementation of projects (Box 3). In addition, new projects will build on the existing 
project portfolio to continue the support to the core public sector systems at the central levels. 
The Public Administration Reform Project (FY00) will continue to strengthen public 
administration, policy planning and efficient management of public resources. It will be 
supplemented by the Business Environment Enhancement and Institutional Reform Project 
(FY06), DPLs (FY07-FY09), programmatic PER (FY07-FY09), CPAR/CFAA (FY06 and 
FY09) and the IDF grant for the support of the decentralization process.27 The Bank will

encourage the Government to build on the positive lessons from Participatory Budgeting Pilot 
initiatives (FY04) to encourage active participation of citizens in the local budget process as well 
as in overall planning, execution and monitoring of the use of public resources. The Bank will 
also strengthen its partnership with other leading development partners (see Annexes 1 and 7) 
that are supporting key public sector reforms (e.g., public procurement, tax and custom 
administration, civil service reforms, rule of law and public expenditure management).28  

51. 
To ensure the effectiveness of poverty reduction efforts, the WBG support program will 
continue to focus on inclusive development and reduction of regional disparities.29 The 
specific vulnerable groups (including the poorest, the Roma, youth, and vulnerable women) will 
receive special attention in the design and implementation of the new projects, through social 
analysis, inclusive operational arrangements and appropriate monitoring and evaluation. The 
Bank has developed some innovative approaches in supporting Community Driven Development 
(CDD) in many of its investment projects (e.g., microcredit, irrigation, drainage, fisheries, and 
small local infrastructure) that rely on establishing beneficiary associations to manage projects 
and resources. The use of these bottom-up approaches will be expanded to other sectors and in 
new projects wherever feasible.  

(ii) Pillar I: Continued Economic Growth through Support to Private Sector Development  

52. 
Sustained growth of 
the Albanian economy 
is predicated on maintaining 
macroeconomic stability, improving the investment climate, and raising exports and 
productivity levels. The WBG support program, under this pillar, will aim to: (i) maintain 
macroeconomic stability and ensure the efficient use of resources; (ii) strengthen financial 
intermediation and support the privatization of strategic companies; (iii) enhance the business 
climate by removing administrative and regulatory barriers to investment and building an 
effective competition policy regime; (iv) establish a functioning land market and institutions; (v) 
build the infrastructure necessary for growth; (vi) improve management of the coastal zone; and 
(vii) raise agricultural productivity. 

53. Maintaining macroeconomic stability. Future macroeconomic stability will be critically 
dependent on pursuing structural and institutional reforms with particular emphasis on fiscal and 
external sustainability. The Bank will support measures for enhancing stability and the quality of 
fiscal adjustment through a proposed program of DPL support through FY07-FY09 and a 
programmatic Public Expenditure Review (PER). On the expenditure side, reductions in both 
current (notably operations and maintenance) and capital spending, which have been the main 
lever for reducing the overall budget deficit since 1998, need to be assessed and reversed to 
increase productivity of capital investments. Expenditures on priority areas, as identified by the 

responsibilities attributed to local governments; (ii) estimation of the local own revenues capacity and the tax effort; 
(iii) regulated access of local government to borrowing for local infra-structure investment; (iv) consistent design of 
a transfer system which factors in national tax-sharing; and (v) drafting Local Government Finance Law. 
28  See Annex 1 for the CAS Results and partnerships towards achieving the CAS outcomes. In particular close 
coordination with the IMF, EU, USAID, DFID and UNDP is envisaged. 
29  The Second Community Works (FY04), the Water Resources Management (FY04) and the Natural Resources 
Management (FY05) projects cover or have a focus on the northern areas. The planned projects in health, education, 
transport and the GEF Lake Shkodra projects during FY06-FY09 will have special focus on Mountain region and 
other areas with high incidence of poverty.  

 
 
 
 
                                                                                                                                                             
Albania Country Assistance Strategy

23

NSSED, should also be sustained. The programmatic PER will support building robust 
institutional arrangements for the analysis and evaluation of public investment projects. Support 
to improving the business environment through the Business Environment Enhancement and 
Institutional Reform Project (FY06) will also contribute to increased export competitiveness and 
attract FDI. IFC has also identified the promotion of external competitiveness through support to 
local export-oriented and import-substitution companies as a high priority for its support. MIGA 
will be available to support investments in the agribusiness, manufacturing and tourism sectors, 
which are most likely to attract increasing levels of FDI inflows.  

54. 
Strengthening financial intermediation and finalizing the privatization of strategic 
companies. The WBG will assist the Government in the completion of the financial sector 
reform agenda and support the implementation of the recommendations of the recently 
concluded Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP).30 The Business Environment 
Enhancement and Institutional Reform Project (FY06) in conjunction with the DPL will support 
policy measures associated with financial sector development, including: (i) strengthening 
governance of banks and insurance companies; (ii) adoption of a legal, institutional and 
supervisory framework enabling sound development of the insurance sector; (iii) strengthening 
banking supervision and exit mechanisms for credit 
institutions; (iv) adoption and 
implementation of an EU-compatible legal and institutional framework for accounting and 
auditing; (v) strengthening enforcement of the collateral regime; and (vi) efficient and 
transparent completion of the privatization program. An Access to Credit Review (FY07) will 
assess progress towards those objectives and inform the design of the DPL II and DPL III (FY08 
and FY09). IFC will continue its technical assistance and financial support to the financial sector 
particularly to financing of SMEs, introduction of new financial products (e.g., leasing, factoring, 
etc.), and privatization of the remaining state holdings in insurance. MIGA would also consider 
supporting projects in the financial sector which are expected to result in improved SMEs’ access 
to finance. 

55. 
Enhancing the business climate. The WBG will use a combination of instruments to 
support improvements in the business climate, removal of administrative and regulatory barriers 
to investment and building an effective competition policy regime. These include the Business 
Environment Enhancement and Institutional Reform Project (FY06) and the DPL program, an 
Accounting and Auditing ROSC (FY06), and IFC/FIAS technical assistance.31 The interventions 
aim to support the: (i) design and implementation of a comprehensive approach to regulatory 
reforms enabling systematic improvement of quality of business sector and consultation 
mechanisms with the business community; (ii) strengthening the MSTQ system infrastructure; 
and (iii) strengthening the institutional and regulatory framework for EU-oriented competition 
and industrial policies. An Investment Climate Assessment (FY08) will be undertaken to assess 
the effectiveness of these interventions on the business climate. In close cooperation with the 
Bank, IFC will facilitate privatization of strategic sectors and will provide technical assistance 
and advisory services aimed at improving the investment climate and advising on strategic 
privatizations. MIGA’s European Investor Outreach Program (EIOP) aims to encourage higher 
investment flows into Albania and other Western Balkan countries (Annex 4).

during FY06-FY09 (Drini River, Shkodra Lake, Butrinti National Park and Karavasta Lagoon).  

56. 
Improving security of land tenure and establishing a functioning land market. The 
Bank has begun to assist the Government to develop a coherent and consistent framework for 
addressing land management through the Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) and 
Clean-up APL (FY05) and a Land Policy Note (FY05). The ICZM project focuses on policy and 
institutional reform, and finances priority regional infrastructure and provision of public services 
in southern coastal villages. The second phase of this APL project (FY09) would aim to foster 
regulated and sustainable tourism development in hinterland areas on the Albanian coast. It will 
place more emphasis on infrastructure investments (e.g., solid waste, wastewater, roads, water 
supply, and typical tourist infrastructure) as well as on promoting protected areas management in 
coastline and marine ecosystems and reducing health risks associated with additional coastal 
polluting hot-spots. The project will also include a youth employment component particularly in 
the tourism sector to address the large youth unemployment rate. The second phase will be 
coordinated closely with the proposed Land Management and Urban Development Project 
(FY07). This project, which will be informed by an Urban Development Strategy (FY06), will 
assist in the development of an overall land administration and management strategy and an 
implementation plan to improve land tenure security. It will accelerate the title registration 
process, especially in the urban and coastal areas, and will also build on the reforms supported by 
the Agricultural Services Project (FY00) to reduce the costs of registering property transactions. 

32  A number of projects are identified as high priority in FY09. These include a Rural Water Supply and Sanitation; 
a support to Decentralization and Local Government, a Social Insurance Reform project, an Agricultural 
Competitiveness or a second Energy project.  The CASPR FY08 will define the nature and context of this project.

25

The project will also directly target urban and suburban growth centers and work directly with 
local governments towards improving governance and service delivery in secondary cities.  

57. 
Building the infrastructure necessary for growth. Constrained availability of financing 
for infrastructure (fiscal space) and modest institutional reform progress remain as bottlenecks to 
growth and private sector development. The WBG will support the provision and maintenance of 
reliable and efficient transport infrastructure through a number of interventions. An Urban 
Transport Study (FY07) will precede the proposed Transport project (FY08) which will aim to 
reduce transport costs, improve traffic flow and contribute to an improvement in road safety on 
the priority corridor(s) identified by the new Government, such the Durres-Kukes-Morine road. 
The new Government aims to improve access to the impoverished northeastern part of the 
country, to alleviate poverty, to integrate the region with the rest of the country and the wider 
region, and to facilitate trade with neighboring countries. A Rural Infrastructure Study (FY08) 
will inform policy and strategy development in the context of sustainable and affordable rural 
infrastructure services, with a primary emphasis on the local road network. In the energy sector, 
the current portfolio already comprises three operations that aim to improve electricity 
generation, transmission and distribution.33 A second Energy Community of South Eastern 
Europe (ECSEE) APL project for Albania (FY08) would further support Albania's participation 
in ECSEE, thereby providing additional impetus to sector restructuring. The project will include 
technical assistance aimed at continuing successful efforts at capacity building to date and 
improving governance in the sector.34  

58. 
IFC and MIGA will work closely with the Government and the Bank to attract private 
sector financing in the infrastructure sectors. IFC’s will focus on promoting private sector 
investments through public-private partnership (PPP) in power, transport, and water and 
sanitation sectors (see Annex 3). IFC and the Bank plan a joint comprehensive approach to 
transparency and competition policy in infrastructure including close coordination between the 
regulators and the anti-monopoly authority. In cooperation with a number of donors, IFC has 
established the Private Enterprise Partnership Southeast Europe (PEP-SE) to help public sector 
entities in Western Balkans, including Albania, attract private investment, particularly in energy, 
transport and water and sanitation. To support regional integration, IFC will facilitate private 
sector involvement in port and pipeline projects. MIGA will also assist foreign investors seeking 
to begin or expand operations in Albania, particularly in the infrastructure sectors through the 
provision of sovereign and sub-sovereign political risk guarantees (Annex 4).  

59. 
Raising agricultural productivity. The existing Bank portfolio consists of several 
projects that aim to support rural development, expansion of agricultural value-added and natural 
resources management. They build on innovative bottom-up CDD approaches that have focused 
on establishing water users association (WUAs) and fishery management organization (FMOs). 
The Agricultural Services Project (FY00) supports land consolidation, seeds, extension and 
technological improvements, and establishment of wholesale markets. The Water Resources 
Management Project (FY04) aims to complete the rehabilitation of all irrigation and drainage 

33  The Power Sector Rehabilitation and Restructuring (FY02), Power Sector Generation and Restructuring (FY04), 
and ECSEE APL2-Albania (FY05) projects. 
34  An IBRD guarantee or IBRD loan (under established guidelines, both as part of the overall CAS envelope) for the 
second stage a thermal power plant will be considered in the CASPR (FY08). The guarantee operation would aim  to 
support private investment for additional thermal units.

infrastructure in the country following the completion of two prior successful projects, and to 
improve institutional and regulatory reforms for water resources management. The Natural 
Resources Management project (FY05) aims to establish and maintain sustainable, community-
based natural resource management in 218 communes in erosion-prone upland and mountainous 
lands. This will lead to enhanced productivity and incomes derived from sustainable resource 
management, reduced soil degradation, 
improved water management, conservation of 
biodiversity, and strengthened public sector management of these resources. Finally, an 
Agricultural Export and Competitiveness Study (FY07) is planned to inform the DPL program 
and ensure support to raising agricultural productivity.

 (iii) Pillar II: Improving Public Service Delivery, particularly in the Social Sectors 

60. 
Improved service delivery is critical for fostering human capital formation, poverty 
reduction efforts and for Albania to meet its MDGs. The Government of Albania has an 
ambitious program to improve service delivery in the social sectors through concerted reforms in 
the education, health and social welfare systems as well as in the provision of public utilities. 
Through the DPL program, social sector investment projects and AAA support (including 
programmatic PER and poverty assessments and an IDF grant for 
the support of 
decentralization), the Bank will support evidence-based policy making, to enhance pro-poor 

35  The World Bank Institute (WBI) will also support the WBG program in Albania during FY07-FY09 when the 
global and regional programs will be finalized. Albania is currently not a WBI focus country.

allocation of public resources and improve the targeting of social assistance and delivery of 
public education and health services, particularly at the local levels. 

61. 
The Government aims to shift from a centralized and supply driven education system to 
a demand-based system with increased levels of accountability. This shift will be supported by 
the Education Excellence and Equity Project (FY06) which aims to address equity and quality of 
education in Albania. Responsibility for delivery of pre-university education will gradually shift 
to local Governments and schools as the ultimate service delivery units. This will be facilitated 
by the introduction of a performance-based management system (initially in the Ministry of 
Education with subsequent expansion to local governments and schools),  a shift from input-
based to formula-based financing of pre-university education, a system of performance 
monitoring and benchmarking at the school, regional and national levels, continued publication 
of the national education system score card, establishment of school maintenance standards, and 
expansion of the education information system. Capacity in school management and oversight 
will also be strengthened through the establishment of school boards, which will work with local 
communities. Schools will be granted increased autonomy to adapt curricula to local needs and 
to choose among alternative teaching materials, as well as greater freedom to use own locally 
raised resources. A far reaching curriculum and textbook reform has also been initiated and a 
revised basic education curriculum will be completed by 2010 (and of secondary education by 
2015). Efforts to improve the quality of teaching include the development of competencies for 
teachers, a teacher accreditation system and introduction of an in-service training program. 
Reforms in basic education will need also to be complemented with efforts to improve the 
quality and relevance of secondary and tertiary education. The education project will be 
supported by the DPL program and the programmatic PER and Poverty Assessments, and a 
Secondary/Tertiary Education Policy Note (FY07).  

62. 
The Health System Modernization Project (FY06) will support strengthening of the 
technical competency of medical staff, sectoral financing, and performance monitoring. 
Medical skills will be enhanced through the introduction of systems for continuous medical 
education and re-licensing for medical personnel, development of clinical practice guidelines and 
substantial changes to the sectoral governance structure. Sectoral financing will shift from the 
current input-based system to a performance-based provider payment system, with measures to 
enhance lower income groups’ access to health care, and will be streamlined to pass through one 
financing agent. Providers will gradually be granted more autonomy and enter into direct 
contractual relationships with the health financing agency. A system of regular sectoral 
performance monitoring, with public discussion of sectoral achievements will be established. 
The Government will also be assisted to improve its resource allocation mechanisms through the 
development of a health map and the adoption of a national hospital services development plan. 
To assess the evolution in access to care, a health sector access analysis will be carried out as 
part of the Programmatic Poverty Assessment (FY06-FY09). Progress in effectiveness of service 
delivery and governance will be assessed as part of the proposed AAA on Governance and 
Accountability in Social Sector Services Delivery (FY08). Policy reforms in the areas of health 
finance and governance will also be supported under the proposed programmatic DPL series. 
Additional opportunities to explore private sector participation in the health sector will also be 
explored. The government has also initiated a dialogue with IFC to explore such opportunities.

Reforms to the social insurance system are being designed to improve the fiscal 
sustainability of the system, while allowing a reduction in payroll tax contributions. The latter 
will be an important element in improving the competitiveness of Albania’s labor market. The 
Government will continue to develop the capacity of the Social Insurance Institute (SII) to model 
medium- and long-term impacts of policy changes on fiscal sustainability of the pension system 
and the larger social insurance system, and begin to implement a medium-term pension policy 
reform program. With regard to social assistance, the highest priority is the establishment of an 
improved accountability framework for the delivery of social assistance schemes by local 
governments. Areas which require attention include the need to: (i) establish service standards 
and a monitoring and evaluation system for social assistance and social care services provided by 
local governments; (ii) improve targeting and expand coverage of the cash social assistance 
system in a fiscally affordable manner; (iii) strengthen the effectiveness of the cash disability 
benefits system; (iv) evaluate the potential for linkages between cash social assistance and 
subsidies for basic services such as utilities and health care and; (v) support the decentralization 
and deinstitutionalization of social care services. The Bank will support the Government’s efforts 
through a Social Insurance Finance Review (FY07) to cover unemployment, pensions, health and 
other parts of the social insurance system. Policy changes on the social insurance finance front 
will be supported through the proposed DPL program (FY07-FY09). The Bank is also supporting 
the Government’s efforts to strengthen delivery of social care services at local levels through the 
ongoing Social Services Development Project (FY01) which aims to improve access and quality 
of social care services in a cost effective manner by local Governments. 

64. 
The Bank will support improvements in the provision of water supply and sanitation 
services in both urban and rural areas. The Bank will support the implementation of the Rural 
Water Supply Strategy, and will also continue to support the provision of improved water supply 
and sanitation services in urban areas through the Municipal Water and Wastewater Project 
(FY03), the Integrated Water and Ecosystem Management Project (FY04), and the Community 
Works II Project (FY03). In addition, the new ICZM APL phases I and II (FY05 and FY08) will 
finance priority investments including water and sanitation infrastructure as earlier described. 
IFC will explore ways to approach municipal financing also through public-private partnership to 
attract private operators with a focus on the city of Tirana. 

B. 

The Framework for Bank Assistance and Financing Scenarios 

65. 
The CAS proposes a lending range, with actual lending to be determined by the pace of 
reform in key sectors. This design reflects the reality that discrete lending ‘cases’ defined by 
hard triggers often do not allow sufficient flexibility to accommodate different rates of progress 
across sectors. A lending range of US$ 75 – US$ 196 million is envisaged, with actual lending to 
be determined according to progress in achieving key milestones outlined in the monitoring 
framework (Table 6). The proposed lending program would be financed by a blend of IDA and 
IBRD resources, with gradual transition from IDA to IBRD beginning in FY06. Albania’s 
exceptional and temporary eligibility for IDA resources on modified terms has been extended 
through FY06-FY0836 with an indicative envelope of up to US$ 86 million.37 IDA lending is 

36  Through IDA13 Albania had access to IDA resources despite its GNP per capita exceeding the IDA operational 
cut off due to its lack of creditworthiness for IBRD lending. Albania will graduate from IDA support by the end of 
IDA14. 
37  Annual allocations will be determined through the Performance-Based Allocation system.

29

planned to be front-loaded to allow a smooth transition to IBRD throughout the CAS period (on 
a commitment basis).38 An assessment conducted in FY05 concluded that Albania is 
creditworthy for limited IBRD lending, with a first IBRD financed (or blend) operation planned 
for FY06. With strong performance and consistent implementation of the reform agenda, Albania 
is expected to benefit from up to US$ 110 million of IBRD lending, and should fully graduate to 
IBRD-only support in FY09.  

66. 
Key milestones will be used as a core monitoring framework against which progress 
would be collectively assessed for base lending or moving to the higher lending range. The 
envisaged lending support assumes strong policy performance in critical areas (Table 6). 
Progress in undertaking the necessary reforms would be collectively assessed (as opposed to 
each milestone being a hard ‘trigger’). Development policy support targeting private sector 
development, public sector and institutional reform, and improved service delivery in key social 
and infrastructure sectors forms the core of the program. For the DPL program to proceed as 
planned in FY07, remaining weaknesses in the privatization, concession, and public procurement 
frameworks will need to be addressed satisfactorily in FY06, inter alia, to ensure appropriate 
treatment of unsolicited proposals for private provision of infrastructure, especially those that are 
not consistent with the NSSED/MTBP framework. The Business Environment Enhancement and 
Institutional Reform project (FY06) is planned to assist in addressing these weaknesses.  

67. 
Enhanced IBRD creditworthiness is required for high lending support levels. Although 
recent economic growth and inflation trends have been encouraging, incremental measures are 
needed to maintain fiscal and external sustainability. External indebtedness is currently 
moderate, but the conditions that resulted in that outcome, a combination of concessional 
financing and lack of access to the international financial markets, will be gradually changing in 
the medium term, and continuous vigilance is required, particularly since both the fiscal deficit 
and the current account deficit remain relatively large. In addition, the prevailing weaknesses in 
governance, weak revenue mobilization efforts, pervasive poverty, and the combination of heavy 
dependence on remittances and a narrow and undiversified export base, will continue to pose 
development 
challenges, necessitating 
continuous 
close monitoring of Albania’s 
creditworthiness.  

68. Lending levels in the last two years of the CAS will be assessed in the FY08 CASPR. The 
mid-term CAS Progress Report (CASPR FY08), which will assess performance against CAS 
results, will also review the milestones for enhanced lending and IBRD creditworthiness. The 
outcomes and milestones in Table 6 would be used to assess the structure of the lending program 
as events warrant. Higher lending levels, to be implemented by augmenting the size of planned 
operations within the lending envelope contemplated in Table 4,39 would require the 
implementation of a clearly identified reform agenda that raises the long term growth potential of 
the country and markedly improved governance. GDP growth prospects will critically depend on 
a demonstrated increase in private sector investment accompanied by a broadening of the narrow 
export base. Sustained improvements in governance, public sector management, procurement 
and financial management would also be required. Should the pace of reform implementation 

38  Regional project funds (which are not counted against country allocations) under IDA14 will also be requested to 
support regional energy projects. 
39  IBRD resources will not be used to finance any IDA-programmed shortfalls.

slow, as adjudged against the milestones outlined in Table 6, the proposed DPL program and 
associated infrastructure investments would be delayed resulting in slippage of operations from 
this CAS to the next, which would imply lending towards the lower end of the support program 
(US$ 75 million). In the unlikely event that policy reversals result in the macroeconomic 
framework (as outlined in this document) going off track, the Bank would as justified move 
forward only with two social sector projects planned in FY06 and annual lending of about US$ 
15 million in subsequent years (all IDA) for social sector and social assistance support and an 
updated approach would be prepared in the CASPR.

C. 

The Development Policy Lending Program 

BOX 4: SOME LESSONS FROM THE 
POVERTY REDUCTION SUPPORT CREDITS, 

FY02-FY04 

69. 
A program of three Development Policy 
Loans 
(DPLs) will 
complement planned 
investment operations and AAA 
support 
program. The DPL program 
(FY07-FY09), 
building on the achievements of the PRSC series 
of the previous CAS (Box 4), will be a microcosm 
of the whole CAS supporting most of its major 
policy goals and results. It will assist 
the 
implementation of a clearly identified reform 
agenda that raises the long term growth and job 
creation potentials of Albania through private 
sector investment, broadening of the export base, 
fostering 
human 
capital 
formation 
and 
strengthening governance structures. The program 
will be informed by recent and ongoing analytical 
work, especially the Public Expenditure and 
Institutional Review (FY06-FY09), the Social 
Assistance Finance Review (FY06), the Private Sector Development Policy Note (FY05), the 
Financial Sector Assessment Program (FY05), the Land Policy Note (FY05), and the Health 
Sector Note (FY05). It is anticipated that each DPL would focus on the core principal themes of 
the CAS to provide continuity of reform actions across the program.  

The ongoing work on 
the 
Implementation 
Completion Report for the PRSCs (expected to be 
completed in 2006) draws several lessons from 
their experience. First, although 
the PRSCs 
resulted in significant achievements on several 
fronts, more focused policy-based operations may 
be more appropriate in the future, to help focus 
and prioritization. Second, the twinning of policy-
based operations with 
investment operations 
worked particularly well and should be continued. 
Third, performance monitoring indicators should 
be limited to a core set of indicators that reflect 
the key objectives of the program and then be 
tracked and monitored closely. Fourth, future 
operations should have a stronger link with 
analytical work.

70. 
The First DPL. DPL I (FY07) is intended to dovetail with FY06 investment projects and 
the existing portfolio and target further progress in governance and public sector reforms. It will 
support reforms to improve the overall efficiency of public sector expenditures, make public 
administration more effective, and further advance the decentralization agenda. It will assist the 
Government in revising the public procurement framework to plug the loopholes that allow 
unsolicited and non-transparent bids. It will help to improve capacity to prioritize public 
investment projects, including through development of an action plan to implement the IPS that 
aligns different policy frameworks. It will address the issue of professionalism of public 
administration by seeking an expansion of coverage of the Civil Service Law and begin 
implementation of pay reform. DPL I will also maintain the PRSCs’ momentum on 
decentralization, including developing capacity and mechanisms of accountability at the local 
level.  

71. 
The Second DPL. DPL II (FY08) is intended to continue the support for improvements 
in governance, public sector performance, public expenditure management and decentralization. 
In addition to these core reforms, DPL II will support government efforts that would improve 
social service delivery. In education, the focus would be on implementation of the education 
sector decentralization strategy. In health, the DPL would support implementation of a new 
system of financing, managing and governing health care delivery. In social protection, reforms 
would aim at further improving the fiscal sustainability of the social insurance system and 
ensuring adequate targeting of social assistance benefits.

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 

32

72. 
The Third DPL. DPL III (FY09) would also assist the Government to implement reforms 
to enhance governance, public sector reforms and improvements in service delivery. It will focus 
on the attractiveness of Albania as a destination for domestic and foreign investment through the 
strengthening of administrative capacity to improve the quality of the regulatory framework for 
business entry and operations, continued development of the land market, and improving the 
regulatory and institutional frameworks for the implementation of an effective competition 
policy regime. DPL III, which will be informed by an Access to Credit Review (FY07) and an 
Investment Climate Assessment (FY08), will consolidate progress made in reforming the 
financial sector by further strengthening the legal and supervisory frameworks and strengthening 
the corporate governance of financial sector institutions. Further, it will support implementation 
of the financial reporting according to the new accounting law as well as the implementation of 
International Standards on Auditing (ISA) for the financial and non-financial sectors. A decision 
to proceed with DPL III would be made in the CASPR (FY08). Key benchmarks underpinning 
this decision will be the satisfactory implementation of public procurement, concessions and 
privatization legislation to be undertaken in FY06 and the satisfactory implementation of 
governance reforms (see Table 6 and Annex 1). DPL III is expected to be on IBRD terms.  

D. 

Regional Dimensions of the Support Strategy 

73. 
The CAS aims to strengthen Albania’s prospects for EU Accession by supporting key 
aspects of the SAp, the NSSED and the IPS. Albania is committed to advance its integration in 
the SEE region and in the EU, and has signed FTAs with all its neighboring countries. It has also 
been actively engaged in a number of regional initiatives and programs (e.g., the Stability Pact, 
the Infrastructure Steering Committee in SEE (ISG), and the ECSEE). The support program of 
the CAS aims to further Albania’s integration in regional trade and investment as key dimensions 
for enhancing private sector and economic growth. A number of programs and projects have a 
regional perspective, particularly in energy, transport, water resources management and 
environment. The current portfolio has an energy regional project (ECSEE- Albania APL2) and a 
new regional energy project is planned in FY08. The transport project (FY08) will also aim 
mainly to link the northeastern region of Albania with neighboring countries, building on the 
successful implementation of the regional Trade and Transport Facilitation in Southeastern 
Europe Project (TTFSE). The planned AAA program also supports regional integration and 
dimensions. For example, the Country Economic Memorandum in FY08 will review Albania’s 
EU accession agenda, and a regional Growth and Competitiveness study is planned to support 
prospects for increasing trade and investment flows towards and within the region. 

E. 

Partnerships and Participation  

74. 
Extensive consultations underpinned the preparation of the CAS (Annex 5). The 
country office has embarked on consultations with all stakeholders since late 2004. A CAS 
government counterpart team was formed to guide the preparation of the strategy. The 
Government consultations concluded in a joint retreat with the new Government on 12 
September 2005. Consultations with parliamentary commissions and groups enabled the team to 
assess the national priorities as presented by representatives of all political parties. Two 
workshops were organized in north Albania (Kukes) and south Albania (Fier) for representatives 
of local governments and civil society organizations in the respective regions. An advisory 
committee from civil society organizations has advised the Bank’s team throughout the 

 
 
 
 
Albania Country Assistance Strategy 

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 

33

preparation process. Two rounds of consultations with private sector representatives were also 
organized, and an Open House for Youth in March 2005 was held to examine youth priorities 
and their expectations for the new CAS. Two rounds of consultations were organized for donors 
focusing on the CAS priorities and donor coordination. A Client Assessment Survey was 
undertaken in December 2004 (see CASCR) and a special CAS Electronic Discussion Forum has 
been established to ensure wider participation of all stakeholders in the CAS preparation.  

75. 
The Country Office will continue to expand its outreach to strengthen partnerships in 
the implementation of the new CAS. A communication strategy for the Country Office has been 
formulated to expand and enhance the Bank’s outreach activities. A partnership agreement 
between the Bank and the Faculty of Economics (University of Tirana) resulted in the transfer of 
the Public Information Center (PIC) to the Faculty’s library in March 2005. In its new location, 
the PIC will be the venue for launching most of the Bank AAA dissemination and other related 
activities. A quarterly newsletter is now published and disseminated by the Country office and 
efforts are underway to strengthen links with the Global Distance Learning Network (GDLN). 
Furthermore, the Bank will continue to support civil society organizations through the Small 
Grants Program. 

76. 
Emphasis on selectivity in the CAS support program relies on strong partnerships with 
other development partners.  First, a satisfactory macroeconomic framework underpins the 
Bank’s program. The Bank and the IMF cooperate closely in these areas.40 Second, close 
coordination with the European Commission (EC), UNDP, and OSCE (which together with the 
Bank have shared responsibility with regard to donor coordination) will be enhanced to support 
the Government’s implementation of the IPS. Third, the Bank also intends to increase its 
coordination with the EC to facilitate European integration which is the overarching long-term 
vision in Albania. To this end, the Bank program is synchronized with the EC CARDS program 
which will lead donor efforts in a number of important areas such as judicial reforms, fight 
against organized crime, trade, customs and taxation (Annex 9). Fourth, the Bank will also 
continue to work closely with EBRD, EIB, IsDB, OPEC Fund, and Kuwait Fund in co-financing 
projects and programs (particularly in infrastructure and private sector development). Finally, the 
Bank also intends to reinforce and strengthen its partnerships and coordination with bilateral 
donor, including, among others, the Italian Cooperation, The Netherlands, USAID, GTZ, DFID, 
SNV, SIDA, Swiss Cooperation, and Austrian Cooperation. Under the newly implemented donor 
architecture the Bank will continue to provide support to 9 thematic groups in the areas of social 
and economic development.  

77. 
Joint Analytical and Advisory Services. The Bank will continue to prepare its economic 
sector work (ESW) in partnership with the concerned government agencies. In FY05, the Bank 
has started the preparation of AAA activities (e.g., the Public Expenditure and Institutional 
Review) in partnership with other development partners. Efforts will be made to foster this joint 
approach in the provision of technical assistance and policy advice to the Government to ensure 
better harmonization among donor approaches and sustained capacity building in concerned 
government agencies. 

40  Agreement on a new three-year IMF PRGF-EFF program has been reached between the Government of Albania 
and the IMF on November 21, 2005. IMF Board discussion of the new program is scheduled for early 2006.

VII. RESULTS-BASED MONITORING AND EVALUATION  

78. 
The measurement of results is an essential component of improving accountability. 
Box 5 aggregates the major results and outcomes to be influenced by the Bank and achieved by 
the Government during the CAS period, and Annex 1 provides the details of the results and 
outcomes expected from the various interventions. The Bank will primarily depend on 
government systems and agencies for the compilation and verification of results and milestones. 
A Statistical Master Plan (SMP) will be developed in an effort to raise statistical capacity 
building, in collaboration with other donors to assist the authorities in this regard given the lack 
of consistent Household budget and labor force surveys and reliable national accounts. In 
addition, the Bank will undertake a strategic AAA program to ensure good tracking of results, 
including: (i) macroeconomic monitoring; (ii) programmatic poverty assessment (FY06-FY09); 
(iii) programmatic PER (FY07 -09); (iv) An Access to Credit Review (FY07) and an Investment 
Climate Assessment (FY08).

VII. RISKS AND MITIGATION REMEDIES  

79. 
Regional Stability. While Albania is striving to foster its integration in the SEE region 
and in the EU, the external environment poses some risks for sustained economic development. 
Political instability and uncertainty in the region affects the investment climate in Albania and 
adverse developments in the region could spill over to Albania, as was the case with the Kosovo 
crisis in 1999. The political consensus in the country on fostering peaceful cooperation and non-
interference in political developments of neighboring countries demonstrated by Albania in the 
last decade and a half indicates that such risks are manageable. Strong political commitment 
across the region to EU integration will further serve to mitigate political risks. The Bank will 
monitor regional developments closely and make necessary adjustments to the support strategy if 
warranted. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Albania Country Assistance Strategy 

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 

35

80. 
Exogenous Shocks. Economic prospects in Europe and hydrological variations pose the 
two most important exogenous risks. Economic prospects in Europe (and Italy and Greece in 
particular) will impact directly on Albania’s economic prospects due to its high reliance on 
remittances. Government efforts to diversify its sources of foreign exchanges both in terms of 
diversification and promotion of its merchandise exports and labor markets, as well as the Bank 
support program, will mitigate this risk. The high vulnerability of the country to variations in 
hydrology due to Albania’s existing over-dependence on hydropower poses a significant risk to 
economic activity and macroeconomic stability. As a result of concerted action by the 
Government and KESH, aided by favorable hydrology over the last two years, Albania is slowly 
emerging from a major electricity crisis, caused by shortage of electricity supply, which 
adversely affected both its macroeconomic performance and the quality of life of its inhabitants. 
During a dry cycle, Albania will again have to rely heavily on imports, and regional shortages 
may emerge causing a rise in the prices of electricity imports. This risk will be mitigated by 
consistent implementation of the energy strategy (reduction in technical losses, etc.) and the 
diversification of domestic generation capacities (e.g., thermal power plants). 

81. 
Political Risks. There are also potential risks to the implementation of the reform 
program stemming from domestic political developments. First, political polarization between 
the two largest parties represents a potential source of instability and may result in delays in 
reaching national consensus around critical reforms necessary for EU integration. Second, the 
new Government is composed of coalition with a number of smaller parties which may results in 
delays in reaching agreements and thus limiting the government’s ability to pursue necessary far-
reaching governance reforms. Flexibility in the CAS program will enable the Bank to adjust its 
support strategy should the political conditions warrant. 

IX. CONCLUDING REMARKS 

82. 
Albania is well poised to continue its strong economic performance and make significant 
strides towards its goal of full European integration in the next four years. However, the 
government must make inroads against the governance problems that remain pervasive, and also 
attract investment and develop its human capital. A key challenge will also be to ensure that the 
benefits of continued economic prosperity accrue equitably across Albanian society, with 
particular attention to the poorest. The Bank will continue to be a strong partner with Albania as 
it faces these challenges in the coming four years and is committed to helping the government to 
achieve the results described in this CAS. A mid-term review of the CAS (CASPR in FY08) 
would take stock of progress towards achieving the CAS outcomes and results and propose 
appropriate adjustments to the support strategy for FY08-FY09.

ANNEX 2: ALBANIA’S CAS COMPLETION REPORT, FY02-FY05 

Date of the CAS: 28 May 2002  
Date of the Completion Report: June 2005 

Period Covered by the CAS: June 2003-June 2005 
Prepared by: Nadir Mohammed, Country Manager and 
Tim Gilbo, Country Officer 

A. 

INTRODUCTION 

1. 

This CAS Completion Report evaluates the impact and effectiveness of the Bank’s assistance, 
and the outcomes achieved, through the implementation of the World Bank’s Country Assistance Strategy 
(CAS) for Albania during FY02-FY05 (hereafter referred to as CAS02). While CAS02 was not prepared 
using a Results-Based methodology, this report attempts to retrofit a results-based framework to it as a 
basis for a new CAS covering FY06-09 (hereafter CAS06). The retrofitted CAS02 Results Matrix has 
been prepared as if it had been done when the CAS was originally prepared in FY02. 

2. 

A number of diagnostic studies, assessments and reports have informed the preparation of this 
report: (i) Quality Assurance Group (QAG) “Albania: Country Lending Assessment” (April 2004); (ii) 
QAG review of the AAA program (2004); (iii) two Joint Staff Assessments of the National Strategy for 
Socio-Economic Development [NSSED – Albania’s PRSP (2003 and 2004)]; (vi) Country Economic 
Memorandum (2004); (v) the Clients Assessment Survey in December 2004; and (vi) OED’s Country 
Assistance Evaluation (2005).12 Annex A compares actual and planned CAS lending. Annex B reviews 
the implementation of the non-lending support envisaged by the CAS02. Annex C presents a retrofitted 
Results Matrix for CAS02, which has been used to assess progress in achieving outcomes over the period 
FY02-FY05. 

3. 

The CAS02 Completion Report concludes that the Bank’s assistance to the implementation of 
Albania’s NSSED program through FY02-FY05 was Satisfactory.3 The NSSED process did create an 
improved framework for poverty reduction and policy reform by strengthening country ownership of the 
reform program, reinforcing a long-term vision, engaging in partnerships, and focusing on results. 
Positive outcomes have been recorded towards poverty reduction, institution building, improving public 
administration, upgrading infrastructure, supporting agriculture, advancing financial sector reforms, and 
preserving macro-economic stability. Outcomes were relatively less positive in strengthening the 
governance environment, advancing the efficient delivery of social services and environmental 
sustainability. While most programs and projects contributed to satisfactory outcomes, impacts on 
sustainability and institutional development are rated by this report as relatively modest.  

4. 

Overall, the Bank’s performance in the delivery of the assistance to Albania through CAS02 is 
also rated as Satisfactory. The Bank’s CAS02 support was relevant to the country’s priorities and built on 
successful interventions that had either been completed or were ongoing at end FY02. In addition to 
financing numerous priority programs and projects, strong policy dialogue and analytical work helped to

Relations Group, Operation and Evaluation Department; Washington DC, 30 March 2005. 
2 World Bank (2004) “Albania: Sustaining Growth Beyond the Transition”. A World Bank Country Economic 
Memorandum; Report No. 29257-AL; Washington DC, 21 December 2004. 
3 The ratings and assessments of the Bank’s assistance to Albania in this CASCR are overall in conformity with 
those of the OED’s CAE as well as the lessons drawn from previous programs. There are, however, differences in 
some ratings due to two considerations: (i) the CAE covers FY98-FY04, while this CASCR covers FY02-FY05 
(including 4 project approved in FY05); and (ii) the CASCR makes use of recent data on governance that became 
available in May 2005 (e.g., WBI governance indicators).

improve the focus on poverty reduction, building of institutions and maintaining macroeconomic stability. 
Successful experience with community-driven development (CDD) approaches from previous 
interventions was replicated and extended to new sectors and operations. 

Box 1: OED’s Country Assistance Evaluation 

A 2005 Country Assistance Evaluation (CAE) by OED assessed IDA’s assistance to Albania during FY98-FY04. 
The CAE concluded that the overall development impact of IDA’s assistance is rated “moderately satisfactory”. 
OED ratings of projects completed during the period indicate that Albania ranks higher than the Bank and ECA 
region in terms of satisfactory outcomes but lower in terms of institutional development impact and 
sustainability. The CAE indicates that the Bank’s assistance was effective when the government adopted, and 
donors supported a sector strategy that laid out a reform agenda (e.g., energy sector). It also underscored the 
importance of developing the analytical underpinning and strategy, the long-term objectives of institutional 
development and project sustainability and sustained efforts for donor coordination. 
The CAE suggests that the new CAS06 should move the strategy and projects towards an outcome oriented 
approach and be more selective. It also suggests filling knowledge gaps in health, infrastructure and urban 
development and the importance of working with the present administrative structure of government and 
gradually phase out the project implementation units.

The Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy (GPRS), completed by the Government of Albania 
(GoA) in 2001, expressed Albania’s long-term vision of European integration and was intended to 
complement the Stabilization and Association process (SAp). The GPRS, which was subsequently 
renamed the National Strategy for Social and Economic Development (NSSED), demonstrates the 
country’s serious effort to use a comprehensive national medium-term development strategy to move 
from managing short-term crises to creating the conditions that promote long-term growth and poverty 
reduction. The NSSED has strong government ownership and was prepared through a participatory 
process of unprecedented scope. It also contains improved poverty diagnostics and an ambitious plan for 
monitoring and evaluation. 

II. 

Economic Developments, Growth and Poverty Trends Until 2002 

6. 

Albania’s record of economic and social development in the first 12 years of economic transition 
was impressive. From 1990 to 2002, Albania realized the highest rates of economic growth among all 
transition economies, averaging 6 percent per annum. As a result real GDP per capita reached US$ 1,380 
in 2002, up from US$ 640 in 1990. Initially, real GDP contracted sharply by a cumulative 39 percent 
between 1990 and 1992, however recovery began in earnest in 1993 with the successful institution of a 
macroeconomic stabilization program, price and trade liberalization, and privatization of agricultural land. 
Between 1993 and 1996, the economy grew at a rapid annual rate of 9.3 percent. In 1997, the collapse of 
the pyramid schemes resulted in a sharp contraction in real output. Albania was, nonetheless, able to 
recover swiftly from this crisis, and between 1998 and 2001, the economy grew at an average annual rate 
of 7.4 percent. In 2002, an energy crisis and poor weather lowered GDP growth to 4.7 percent.  

7. 

Despite the rapid rates of economic growth, poverty in Albania remains widespread. A World 
Bank’s Poverty Assessment completed in 2002 based on real Living Standards Measurement Survey 
(LSMS) data estimated that one-quarter of the population, or close to 780,000 individuals, was below the 
poverty line in that year. Extreme poverty affected about 150,000 persons, or about 5 percent of the 
population, who were unable to meet even the basic food requirements. A large number of individuals

50

were clustered around the poverty lines, suggesting that even modest shocks could lead to a substantial 
increase in poverty. However, inequality has been moderate with a consumption-based Gini index of 0.28.  

BOX 2: THE VIEWS OF STAKEHOLDERS ON THE BANK’S EFFECTIVENESS 

The World Bank Office in Tirana undertook a Clients Assessment Survey in December 2004 to inform the design of 
the new CAS. Survey Questionnaires were distributed to 350 stakeholders. Some 137 respondents (39% response rate) 
from the Presidency, Cabinet as well as Parliamentarians (7.7% of respondents); civil servants and public sector 
employees including implementation units (31.2%); local governments (14.9%); bilateral and multilateral donors 
agencies (10.0%); private sector (9.0%); civil society organizations (11.0%); media (9.0%); academic and research 
institutions (3.7%) and other stakeholders (2.5%) responded to the survey. The results were compared with a similar 
survey that was undertaken in 2001 for the CAS02 formulation.  
Overall, clients’ perceptions about the importance of the issues addressed by the Bank and its effectiveness in 
addressing them are high and showing marked increases since 2001. In particular, the Bank’s effectiveness in poverty 
reduction, public sector reforms, adoption of sound macroeconomic and trade policies and assistance in EU 
integration were the most important aspects of the Bank work in Albania and the Bank has been very effective in 
addressing them. The Bank’s effectiveness in promoting economic growth, improving governance and private sector 
environment, promotion of investment and social inclusion were also considered important aspects of the Bank’s 
support but the Bank’s effectiveness in addressing them has not been as high as the first category of support areas. 
Finally, Bank’s support to Albania has been rated as very effective in concentrating on Albania’s realties and 
priorities. The Bank has been characterized as being flexible to adjust to changing country conditions and for giving 
realism to Albania’s situation and constraints.

CAS02, which was presented to the Board in May 2002, supported the three NSSED pillars of 
improving governance, promoting private sector development and fostering human resource development, 
with institution building as a crosscutting theme to be imbedded in all interventions. CAS02 also 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Albania Country Assistance Strategy: CAS Annexes 

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 

51

emphasized the importance of selectivity within sectors, and made comprehensive assessments of 
challenges, opportunities and constraints in each sector. CAS02 made a convincing case for the selection 
of specific Bank operations and activities, which aimed to address root development problems, especially 
weak governance and institutions, tenuous rule of law and enormous infrastructure deficiencies, 
especially in the power sector. CAS02 also aimed to support the prospects of closer ties to European 
structures in the context of impending negotiations of a Stabilization and Association Agreement (SAA) 
with the EU.4 

9. 

Objectives of CAS02, and the retrofitted Results Matrix. CAS02 outlined a three pronged 
strategy based on: (i) Improving the governance and strengthening the institutions; (ii) Promoting 
sustainable private sector activity; and (iii) Fostering human development. While CAS02 did not outline 
the expected outcomes from the Bank’s past and proposed interventions,5 it did seek to systematically 
track specific indicators that could be used to assess progress towards key objectives. In the interests of 
establishing a robust results framework as a basis for the next CAS, a Retrofitted Results Matrix has been 
developed for CAS02, based on the original articulated CAS indicators as well as conditionality and 
monitoring indicators that were subsequently developed in the context of individual CAS02 operations 
(Annex C). The text below describes progress in achieving these retrofitted outcomes, with Columns III 
and IV of the retrofitted results matrix reproduced in the text to facilitate discussion. 

Objective I: Improving Governance and Strengthening Institutions 

10. 

CAS02 recognized that Albania’s public institutions had been unable to keep pace with the 
country’s economic transformation. It considered weak governance and institutions and tenuous rule of 
law as a core constraint to development. Thus, improved governance was highlighted as one of three 
inter-related objectives of CAS02, as was the case for the NSSED, while institution building was a 
crosscutting theme. In addressing this objective, CAS02 specifically sought to: (a) strengthen public 
administration and civil service; (b) strengthen the judiciary and reduce corruption; and (c) strengthen 
local government and build social consensus. Numerous programs and projects in the portfolio in 2002, as 
well as interventions in CAS02, supported government efforts to achieve this objective: Public 
Administration Reform Project, Tirana Transparency Project, the PRSC program, as well as the Legal and 
Judicial Reform Project (Annex C). 

11. 

Program Assessment: Outcomes with regard to the overall governance/institution building 
agenda are assessed as partially achieved. Overall outcomes have varied substantially across various 
aspects of the governance and institution building agenda. 

12. 

Outcome 1: Reforming the Public Administration and reducing corruption in Government. 
Civil service and public administration reform outcomes have been particularly satisfactory, with 
successful establishment of a legal framework for the civil service and substantial progress made in the 
implementation of the Civil Service Law (CSL). The Civil Service Commission has become an 
increasingly effective mechanism for protecting the due process requirements of the CSL. A professional 
and increasingly merit-based civil service has become a new domestic constituency promoting effective 
implementation of the law, as they derive benefits and increased job security from it. However, anti-
corruption efforts have, with some exceptions, yielded fewer results. Good governance initiatives such as 
strengthening policy monitoring and evaluation and increasing transparency and accountability in the 
management of public resources, supported by the PRSC program, are still in their inception phase. The

enactment of internal audit and procurement laws allowed for establishing a basic financial accountability 
system, and the state budget became increasingly comprehensive and transparent, with marked 
improvements in its preparation, implementation and monitoring. The opportunities for corruption in 
public administration have been reduced with the enactment and implementation of the law on ethics and 
public administration, and by a reduction in the size of government through privatization. The Tirana 
Transparency Project (FY01-FY04) provided further support to efforts to increase transparency in public 
administration. These interventions and non-lending activities (e.g. anti-corruption technical assistance) 
contributed to advancing and updating the Government’s anti-corruption strategy. Recent government 
surveys point to a mixed picture of governance and corruption indicators (either deterioration or modest 
improvements)6 (Table 1.1).

INTERMEDIATE PROGRESS 
INDICATORS 

RESULTS 

• All Civil Service positions are 
advertised (and regularly 
tracked); 
• Increased competitive filling of 
civil service positions (Baseline: 
52% in 2001; Target: 75% in 
2004); 
• Reduced contractual services in 
the civil service (Baseline: 16% 
in 2001; Target: 1% in 2004); 
• Increased coverage of Civil 
Service performance evaluations 
(Baseline: 0% in 2001; Target: 
75% in 2003); 
• Application of the Civil Service 
Law (CSL) extended to cover 
tax and custom administration; 
• Enforced code of ethics and 
income/asset declarations; 
• Adoption of new laws on 
internal audit and procurement, 
and evaluation criteria for public 
procurement and outcomes are 
established and published. 

Political interference in the hiring and firing of civil 
servants has been reduced. At the end of FY05, all positions 
are being advertised (and regularly tracked). Competitive 
filling of positions has increased from 52% in 2001 to 80%
in 2004. Contractual services to the Government – which 
have been used as a mechanism to bypass new CS laws -
were reduced from 16% of total CS recruitment in 2001 to 
0.9% in 2004. Performance evaluations covered 76% of 
employees in 2003. The application of the CSL was 
extended to cover tax and custom administration by 2004. 
Improvements in the wage system – as assessed by a further 
five criteria (salary grade compression, competitiveness 
etc.) have also been made. A code of ethics and mandatory 
income/asset declarations has been legislated and are being 
enforced. The Law on Organization and Functioning of the 
Council of Ministers (Law No. 9000) and the Law on 
Ethics in Public Administration (Law No. 9131) were 
enacted in January and September 2003, respectively. Basic 
financial accountability system is in place with the adoption 
of laws on internal audit and procurement. Evaluation 
criteria for public procurement and outcomes have been 
established, with publication of the final results. Internal 
audit units have been established and the computerization 
of the Treasury in Tirana has been largely completed.  

13. 

Outcome 2: Strengthening management of public expenditure. Good progress has been made 
with the implementation of the NSSED and the integration of the planning and budgeting systems.7 
Implementation of the NSSED gained momentum after a slow start in 2002 due to political instability 

6 The most recent WBI governance indicators (May 2005) show overall improvements in governance indicators in 
Albania in 2004 in comparison with 2002 (5 out of 6 governance indicators have improved though still problematic 
in comparison with other countries). The second Business Environment and Enterprise Performance Survey 
(BEEPS) pointed to concerns about weak governance structures and poor business environment in Albania during 
1999-2002. It indicated perceptions of increased corruption and state capture in comparison with the first BEEPS 
that covered the period 1996-1999. 
7 Largely due to these reforms, the International Country Risk Group (ICRG) index for bureaucratic quality show an 
increase from 1 to 2 between 1997 and 2004 (see World Bank, OED Report 2005).

resulting from three government changes. In 2003 implementation improved and the GoA prepared its 
first annual progress report. This coincided with the availability of data from the first representative 
Living Standards Measurement Survey (LSMS), which further strengthened poverty diagnostics. While 
efforts to more closely link the NSSED and the medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF) have been 
consistent, real progress has been slow, as noted by Bank and IMF Joint Staff Assessments of the NSSED 
Annual Progress Reports. Progress was more evident towards establishing capacities for monitoring and 
evaluation in line ministries and the creation of the Department for the NSSED within the Ministry of 
Finance. Additionally, there has been some progress in linking the implementation of the strategy with the 
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), the SAp as well as other policy frameworks,8 and in 
strengthening coordination through active engagement with the donor community. The Public 
Administration Reform Project from the pre-CAS02 portfolio (FY00) and the PRSC program in CAS02 
addressed priority issues in public expenditure management, human resource management, and policy 
formulation (Table 1.2).

• MTEF is developed based 
on the GPRS priorities and 
used as primary source for

• Approval of National 
Training Strategy for Local 
Government and 
establishment of a Training 
Agency; 
• Identification of revenue 
sources for local govern-

common and shared 
functions; 
• Regulations established for 
fiscal autonomy of local 
governments; 
• Revised 2002 provisional 
formula for allocation of 
unconditional transfers to 
the local governments. 

RESULTS 

While the MTEF is now the primary budgetary tool, it is 
not satisfactorily 
linked with 
longer-term objectives 
outlined in the NSSED or driven by policy. The conformity 
between annual budgets and 
the MTEF has been 
improving, but needs to be strengthened further. A new tax 
reform law was made effective in 2003. The capacity of the 
MoF to provide input into the fiscal impact of policies has 
been increased, however such advice is not routinely 
provided during the policy planning stages. A National 
Training Strategy for Local Government was approved and 
a Training Agency established. Progress has been made 
with fiscal decentralization, supported by Bank ESW and 
the PRSC program. The Land Tax was reinstated as a local 
tax; the former Small Business Tax was split into the Local 
Small Business Tax and the Simplified Profit Tax, and both 
became local own taxes; the law on local taxes and fees 
was reviewed and other taxes transformed in "own tax” act. 
The 2002 provisional formula for the distribution of State 
unconditional transfers to the local self-governments was 
revised in 2003. Progress was also made in finalizing the 
education and health sector strategies and accompanying 
implementation action plans 
that delineate 
service 
provision responsibilities between the local and central 
governments. Progress in delineation of functions between 
central and local governments has been slow and remains 
contingent upon a new 
law on financing of 
local 
governments which is in preparatory stage. The Bank is 
currently supporting this work through an IDF grant.

14. 

Although the legal framework for decentralization is in place, there was limited progress towards 
effective decentralization during the CAS02. Local self-government was founded on the principle of 
decentralization defined 
in 
the new Constitution of 1998, and a corresponding Strategy of 
Decentralization and Local Autonomy was completed in 1999. To support implementation of the 
decentralization strategy a National Committee for Decentralization, advised by a technical secretariat 
called the Group of Experts on Decentralization (GED), was also established. Despite these initial 
regulatory and institutional achievements, further implementation of the Government’s decentralization 
strategy has not proceeded rapidly due to: (i) the fragmented structure of local administrative units; (ii) 
weak administrative capacity (both at local and central levels); (iii) remaining uncertainties in the 
assignment of responsibilities and competences to the local authorities; (iv) the absence of clear standards 
of services and measurement criteria of performance in service delivery; and (v) an inadequate degree of 
revenue autonomy and predictability. While the Bank was able to provide timely advice through ESW,9 
significant outcomes were not achieved in the CAS02 period due to a lack of synergy and fragmentation 
in the support provided by various projects.10

court 
administrators has been established in 2003. 
A Judicial Inspection Office was established 
and is fully operational. A new transparent 
court and case administration system has been

15. 

Outcome 3: Increasing the effectiveness of the judicial system. The Legal and Judicial Reform 
Project (LJRP - FY00) also contributed by strengthening legal education, strengthening courts, 
establishing alternative dispute resolution mechanisms and improving the legal information infrastructure. 
However, compared to public administration reforms, support to the legal and judicial system has yielded 
fewer concrete results. While good progress has been made towards building institutional foundations in 
some areas, the cumulative effects of numerous initiatives by the Bank and other donors have not 
translated into marked improvements in the rule of law, law enforcement and measurable reductions in 
corruption and incidence of state capture according to anecdotal evidence and recent surveys. For 
example, while on paper Albania now has one of the best procurement frameworks in the Balkans, large 
infrastructure contracts in some sectors are still finalized without transparent and competitive bidding 
(Table 1.3 above). 

Objective II: Promoting Sustainable Private Sector Growth 

16. 

Under this pillar, CAS02 emphasized the importance of: (a) maintaining macroeconomic 
stability; (b) improving the environment for private investment; (c) reforming the financial sector; (d) 
completing enterprise privatization; (e) sustaining agricultural growth; and (f) fostering broad-based rural 
growth. CAS02 also noted the need to improve infrastructure and create institutional environments 
conducive to infrastructure sustainability, especially through community or private sector participation, 
and to promote environmental sustainability and the sustainable use of natural resources. Outcomes under 
this objective were supported through various lending and non-lending activities in both the pre-CAS02 
portfolio as well as new activities in CAS02, including: Private Industry Recovery Project, Financial 
Sector Institution Building TA Project, the PRSC program, Recovery Program TA Project, FSAC, 
Microcredit Project, Forestry Project, Irrigation and Drainage II, Pilot Fishery Development Project, 
Water Resources Management, Municipal Water and Wastewater Project, Agricultural Services Project, 
Power Transmission and Distribution Project, Power Sector Rehabilitation and Restructuring Project, 
Power Sector Generation and Restructuring Project, Energy Community of South East Europe APL 
Project, Road Maintenance Supplemental and Urban Land Development Project (Annex C). 

17. 

Program Assessment: Outcomes with regard to the overall promotion of sustainable private 
sector growth during CAS02 have been achieved. Outcomes have varied substantially across different 
areas of the private sector agenda. Outcomes have been highly satisfactory in infrastructure (especially in 
the energy sector), financial sector reforms, agricultural development and rural development. However, in 
the areas of environment and natural resource development positive outcomes have been generally slow 
to materialize.  

18. 

As noted earlier, macroeconomic performance, and the private sector contribution to it, has 
remained strong during CAS02. The period was characterized by sound monetary and financial sector 
policies, fiscal consolidation, successful privatization, and a substantial improvement in the performance 
of the electricity sector that has significantly reduced the macroeconomic risks posed by Albania’s 
reliance on hydroelectric power generation. Private sector contribution to GDP and growth continued to 
increase in the last three years. Private investment picked up from about 17 percent of GDP in 2002 to 
more than 20 percent of GDP by 2004 while public investment declined by 2 percentage points during the 
same period.  

19. 

Outcome 1: Improving the facilitating environment for investment, production and export 
by the private sector. Although significant progress has been made in reducing the administrative 
barriers to investors’ entry, a survey conducted in 2004 shows that there are still some impediments to be 
overcome (e.g. unfair practices, tax rates, electricity supply, corruption and frequent changes to the 
regulatory framework). With the support from the World Bank’s FSAC project, a new accounting law has

been enacted and accounting standards are improving. Some progress, albeit partial, was observed in 
improving the legal framework and alternatives for resolving commercial disputes (Table 2.1).

RESULTS 

A Study on the Administrative Barriers was completed in 
2003 with support from FIAS, and an Action Plan to 
address them is under implementation. About 80% of the 
actions envisaged under the Action Plan have been 
implemented or under implementation. According to a 
survey in 2004, the severity of most of the administrative 
barriers was reduced compared to 2002, in particular those 
related to the customs administration. However, the survey 
shows 
that 
the general perception of 
the business 
community is that the major impediments to business 
growth still continue to be: (i) unfair practices, (ii) tax 
rates, (iii) electricity supply, (iv) corruption, and (v) 
frequent changes of regulatory framework. A new 
accounting law was enacted in April 2004 and an 
institutional development plan for bankruptcy enforcement 
and secured financing has been 
implemented. The 
business plan for the Bank Asset Resolution Trust 
portfolio has been completed with support from the 
Bank’s FSAC project, and implementation is under way.
An Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) institution for 
commercial disputes has been formed and its staff trained, 
and is ready to accept cases. No disputes have been 
referred to the ADR to date however, and thus this 
outcome has not been fully achieved. 

20. 

Outcome 2: Strengthening the financial sector and supporting robust private sector growth. 
CAS02 successfully supported the final phase of the transition of the role of the state in the financial 
sector from that of owner to one of regulator. The Bank supported this transition by helping to improve 
the legal and institutional framework necessary for functioning of a market-based financial sector and 
strengthening of the independence and capacity of the Central Bank. Driven by strong government 
commitment, and facilitated by the considerable credibility that the Bank has built with relevant 
stakeholders, the Financial Sector Adjustment Credit (FSAC) and the Financial Sector Institution 
Building Technical Assistance (FSIBTA) successfully supported the State’s divestiture of its bank 
holdings, and the establishment of a legal, institutional and supervisory framework for sound financial 
sector development (including non-banking sector such as insurance). The Savings Bank was privatized 
and the moratorium on its lending activities has been lifted and the state insurance company (INSIG) was 
partially privatized. The Bank of Albania (BoA) has substantially strengthened its supervisory capacity 
through the implementation of a more risk-based supervision process. The legal, regulatory and 
supervisory framework for non-financial institutions has been modernized, and the bankruptcy, collateral, 
debt resolution frameworks have been strengthened. These achievements have been particularly 
noteworthy in consideration of the financial sector crisis that engulfed Albania in 1997 (Table 2.2).

(Financial Sector Reforms) 

CAS OUTCOMES 
THE BANK 
EXPECTED TO 
INFLUENCE  
A STRENGTHENED 
FINANCIAL SECTOR 
SUPPORTING 
ROBUST PRIVATE 
SECTOR GROWTH 
THROUGH: 

• Increased financial 
intermediation and 
extension of credit 
to the private 
sector; 
• Better financial 
regulation and 
prudent controls;  
• Liberalized 
financial markets 
and reduced 
government 
ownership in the 
sector;  
• Improved 
availability and 
reliability of other 
financial services 
such as insurance; 
• Development of 
non-bank financial 
institutions. 

INTERMEDIATE 
PROGRESS INDICATORS

• Increase credit to the 
private sector by 30% 
per annum (Baseline: 35 
billion in 2001; Target: 
Lek 56 billion by 2004);
• Introduce payment of 
public sector wages 
through banking 
system; 
• Implementation of a 
large value (RTGS) 
payment system; 
• Satisfactory banking 
regulations adopted and 
enforced by BoA; 
• Implementation of the 
Supervisory 
Development Plan and 
introduction of risk-
based supervision; 
• Establishment of a 
Deposit Insurance Fund;
• Complete privatization 
of Savings Bank and 
INSIG; 
• Establishment of 
Insurance Regulator. 

RESULTS 

Volume of credit increased from Lek 35 billion in 2001 
to Lek 55 billion in June 2004, indicating that financial 
sector reform are beginning to play a greater role in 
fostering private sector led growth. Public sector wages 
began to be paid through the Banking system in 
2004/05. With Bank’s support, the BoA has established 
an Automated Clearing House (ACH) and a large value 
(RTGS) payment 
system 
is now operational. 
Satisfactory banking regulations have been adopted and 
are being enforced by BoA. The Supervisory 
Development Plan was adopted by the BoA in March 
2002, defining long-term strategy and institutional 
development program 
for banking 
supervision. 
Supervisory strategies, the risk analysis, management 
evaluations, and supervisory plans 
therein have 
improved quality and comprehensiveness. A Deposit 
Insurance Agency (DIA) was established under the 
Deposit Insurance Law, which was effective in October 
2002. By June 2004, the total accumulated assets of the 
Agency were Lek 1.7 billion, representing a fund-to-
insured deposit ratio of 1.1%. The Savings Bank was 
privatized in 2004 (for a record FDI of US$ 126 
million). This reduced government ownership in the 
banking sector to 40% shareholdings in 2 small Banks. 
40% of INSIG is privatized, and preparations are 
underway 
to 
fully privatize 
it. The 
Insurance 
Supervisory Agency (ISA) was established in December 
2004, in line with the budgetary and operational 
independence 
requirements of 
the 
International 
Association of Insurance Supervisors.  

21. 

Outcome 3: Improving rural productivity and higher incomes in rural areas. Management 
responsibility for almost all irrigation networks has been transferred to farmers associations, which are 
also gradually becoming involved in flood protection. The concept of community-managed resources has 
been expanded in fisheries and forests, with Fishery Management Organizations (FMOs) established to 
manage fishery resources and ports and forest management transferred to over 100 communes. Access to 
finance in rural areas has also improved through increased coverage of the credit associations and 
increased bank lending. Microcredit schemes have been extended to both urban and rural areas, and the 
institutions providing them have matured in terms of both financial and operational sustainability. 
Agricultural productivity in rural areas has increased, with the annual income for a typical farmer 
benefiting from the Bank supported irrigation rehabilitation increased by about US$ 600.11 (Table 2.3). 

11 The first irrigation and drainage project helped rehabilitation of 58,000 hectare of irrigation and 130,000 hectare 
of drainage and promoted the formation of about 200 water users associations (WUAs).

for 
immovable property 
registration system was finalized and Law No. 
9235 
(July 
2004) 
for 
private 
property 
compensation and restitution was enacted. Time to 
register 
land was reduced and 
the cost of 
registration was halved, but notary fees are 
significant and have not been changed. First time 
registration of land was completed in 80.6% of 
rural cadastral zones. 
Immovable property 
registration offices are now functional with land 
registration transactions rising from 14,000 in 
2002 to 20,000 by end of 2004. Seed certification 
process has been established and multiplication 
and trade are now fully private sector based. 
Agricultural 
research 
institutions have been 
restructured, and breeder seed production has 
increased by 8% to 43.2 tons per research station. 
Seeds regulations were adjusted to international 
standards by enactment of laws No. 8800 and No. 
8732. Freshwater aquaculture was introduced in 
more than 70 irrigation reservoirs. 11 Fishery 
Management Organizations were established and 
the rehabilitation of ports in Vlora and Saranda 
completed. A hatchery for Lake Ohrid Trout was 
rehabilitated and its staff trained. A total of 550 
WUAs were created to manage irrigation facilities 
and 
their representatives have been 
trained. 
Management 
of 
irrigation 
schemes 
by 
communities reached 60% of total irrigated area 
and will reach 100% by end of 2006. Agricultural 
land with functioning irrigation and drainage 
systems increased to 50% and 70% of total 
irrigated land respectively by rehabilitating 50,000 
ha of irrigation facilities and 93,000 ha of 
drainage and flood facilities (2/3 of Albania 
irrigated land) benefiting more than 100,000 
farmers. Lushnja and Korca markets were 
established with market use information points for 
traders and farmers, and connections with EU 
Aminsnet and markets in Italy and Greece were 
established. Annual revenues of the Lushnja 
municipal markets increased by 50% between 
2002 and 2004, reaching US$30,000 in 2004. A 
survey of rural income is being completed.

Outcome 4: Improving environmental conditions and more sustainable use of natural 
resources. With the transfer of forest management to communes, the illegal logging of forests has been 
reduced. The establishment of the Environmental Inspectorate allowed for improvements in the 
enforcement of environmental regulations, while there are on-going efforts to reduce urban sewerage 
pollution with works currently undertaken in several cities in Albania. However, the general progress in 
this area has been slow, and two Bank projects supporting further results in this area were not approved 
until the last quarter of CAS02 (Table 2.4).

• Reduction in illegal logging by 
10% in 2002; 20% in 2003 and 
20% in 2004; 
• Rehabilitation of 5,000 ha of 
forests and 200 ha of pastures;  
• Protected areas increased from 
6% of total surface area in 2002 
to 15% by end of 2004;

for sewage treatment plant in 
Pogradec in 2005 and wetlands 
in Durres, Lezhe & Saranda; 
• Complete feasibility studies for 
remediation work at three 
‘hotspots’ by FY04. 

RESULTS 

A reduction of 52% 
in 
illegal 
logging 
occurred between 2001 and 2004 (12% in 
2002; 37% in 2003 and 13% in 2004). Some 
5,100 ha of forests and 270 ha of pastures 
have been rehabilitated. Protected areas have 
increased by 11% between 2002 and end of 
2004 (from 165,000 ha to 183,000 ha). An 
Environmental Inspectorate was established in 
2002 and the number of inspections and fines 
has continued 
to 
increase. The National 
Environmental Action Plan (NEAP) was 
updated in 2002. Few structures in line 
ministries 
dealing with 
environmental 
considerations have also been established. 
Work is currently ongoing to construct the 
wastewater treatment plant at Ballsh Refinery 
and a feasibility study for a hazardous waste 
landfill is also ongoing. Construction of the 
sewage treatment plant in Pogradec is planned 
in 2005, and feasibility studies are currently 
ongoing for wetlands in Durres, Lezhe & 
Saranda. Feasibility studies 
for hotspots 
including Sharra landfill, Porto Romano and 
remediation of PVC in Vlora were finalized 
during 2003/05. 

23. 

Outcome 5: Reducing macroeconomic risks associated with the energy sector and 
improving reliability of power supply. Energy sector performance improved significantly over the 
CAS02 period, through the sustained implementation of a multi-year Power Sector Action Plan developed 
under the Bank’s leadership. Quantitative performance targets outlined in the Action Plan were met in 15 
out of the 16 quarters since its adoption in 2001. Illegal electricity usage has been progressively reduced, 
collections have increased, and tariffs are being gradually raised, while at the same time a scheme to 
protect socially vulnerable consumers from the impacts of price rises has been introduced. These 
achievements, coupled with favorable hydrology in 2003 and 2004, have resulted in diminished 
macroeconomic risks from the energy sector, improved electricity supply as well as a significantly 
improved financial performance by KESH (the Albanian electricity utility). Although significant 
electricity imports may still be necessary in the future, no subsidy from the Government budget will be 
required from 2005 onwards. Substantial governance-related improvements were also achieved, including 
improvements in the management structure of KESH, stronger internal financial controls leading to

60

increased transparency in the financial transactions undertaken by KESH, the establishment of an 
independent electricity regulator, the effective implementation of new laws to facilitate payment 
discipline by household and private consumers, and enforced payment discipline among budgetary and 
non-budgetary entities (Table 2.5).

• Implementation of the 
first phase of the 
energy reform plan; 
• Improvements in 
governance in areas 
relevant to energy. 

INTERMEDIATE PROGRESS 
INDICATORS 

• Power losses reduced to 42% in 
2002 and to the targets indicated 
in the Action Plan for 2003/04; 
• Bill collection increased to 90% 
in 2002 to the levels agreed in the 
Action Plan for 2003/04; 
• Number of consumers without 
meters reduced to levels 
indicated in the updated Action 
Plan; 
• Establishment of Transmission 
System Operator, develop a 
Transitional Market Model; 
• Implement an energy subsidy 
scheme to protect poor from 
effects of price rises; 
• Enact and implement new laws to 
facilitate payment discipline by 
households. 

RESULTS 

Load shedding has been reduced. Collection and 
losses targets specified in the Power Sector 
Action Plan were met in 15 of the 16 quarters 
since the start of 2001. Losses during 2004 were 
36.6%, and collections increased to 94.7% 
during the year (from Lek 8.1 billion in 2000 to 
Lek 27 billion in 2004). As a result, import 
subsidies to KESH progressively declined from 
US$ 22 million in 2002 to US$ 2.5 million in 
2004. No subsidy is envisaged for 2005 and 
beyond particularly after the establishment of an 
Equalization Fund. All existing household 
consumers have been provided with meters. A 
Transmission System Operator is established, 
and a Transitional Market Model developed. A 
subsidy is being provided to socially vulnerable 
consumers to mitigate the impact of electricity 
price 
increases. Laws 
to enforce payment 
discipline were strengthened and enforcement 
was strengthened. 

24. 

Outcome 6: More efficient operation and management of transport and water 
infrastructure. Tremendous bottlenecks in water and roads have been recognized as representing major 
constraints to the further development of private sector, sustained economic growth and poverty 
alleviation. CAS02 introduced various lending and non-lending activities resulting in significant progress 
in the transport sector. Numerous road investments were completed, focused on the main East–West12 and 
the North-South Corridor. Maintenance works were also completed to remediate damage caused by heavy 
trucks during Kosovo crisis, and institutional changes to increase the efficiency and targeting of road 
maintenance were effected. The functioning of the vital Durres port was improved through rehabilitation 
of infrastructure, establishment of an autonomous port authority, privatization of some port operations 
and overall improvements in custom procedures. In the railway sub-sector, the Albanian Railways 
Company (HSH) was transformed into a joint stock company, but a badly needed restructuring and 
rationalization of HSH in line with EU guidelines is yet to be undertaken, and the railway sub-sector 
continues to be financially unsustainable while providing extremely limited services. Other improvements 
have been made including lowering the non-tariff costs of trade and transport, reform of customs 
procedures, and improvements in border crossing facilities.13 However, institutional development in the 

12 Pan-European Corridor VIII. 
13 By March 2005, TTFSE project contributed to: (i) significant decrease in Customs' and border agencies' 
processing times at all pilot sites - by 55% on the average; (ii) improvements in revenue collection by Customs 
(about 20% overall), and (iii) increases in regional trade volumes by about 30%. The project also contributed to

61

transport sector has been notably less successful. Although nascent reforms of the General Road 
Directorate have been initiated, much remains to be done to implement approved legislation, prioritize 
investments and build the capacity of institutions in the sector. The completion of the Albanian National 
Transport Plan (ANTP), with the support of the EU, provides a much-needed overall strategy on which a 
long overdue program of prioritized investments in transport can be developed. However, despite the 
Bank’s long-term involvement in the sector, the Government proceeded in FY05 with large projects and 
concessions of dubious economic and social benefit that are not transparently planned and procured, and 
are not in line with the ANTP and NSSED priorities (Table 2.6).

A pavement management system was introduced in 
2005 and the restructuring of the National Road 
Administration will be completed by the end of 
2005. Bank 
road 
projects 
supported 
the 
construction/rehabilitation of 1,700 km of rural 
roads, and 1,300 km of national roads. The function 
of the vital Durres port was improved through 
rehabilitation of infrastructure, establishment of an 
autonomous port authority, privatization of some 
port operations and overall 
improvements 
in 
custom procedures, safety and port operations. The 
TTFSE project also assisted 
in 
improving 
infrastructure 
improvements 
at 
two border 
crossings as well as connectivity between border 
positions and the Center. Improvements in water 
services were achieved (average use, connections, 
safety compliance, increased collections of water

cities by management contracts. 
Essential infrastructure was constructed (water and 
power supply, roads, sewerage and street lighting) 
in 19 neglected/under-serviced areas affecting 
18,000 families, and engineering designs for 7 
additional areas have been completed. An 
Infrastructure Management Plan for Greater Tirana 
was adopted and approved in principle by the 
National Council of Territory Adjustment. The 
Law on Legalization of Illegal Settlements was 
adopted in 2004. Registration of illegal settlements 
(family houses/surrounding land) was completed 
for 2,548 families in Bathore and Lapraka (Tirana),

25. 

In the water supply and sanitation sector, there has been progress in improving infrastructure, 
governance, private sector participation as well as in strengthening of institutions. The Bank’s policy 
advice and lending assisted the preparation of a comprehensive National Water Supply and Sanitation 
Strategy and a Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Strategy. However, the government has made little 
progress in implementing the rural water supply strategy, and in rural areas water supply and sanitation 
services have further deteriorated during CAS02. In urban areas, urgent rehabilitation measures have been 
implemented, which were successful in bridging a gap in maintenance and rehabilitation services until a 
management contract was implemented in four cities. Municipalities were empowered to control water 
supply and wastewater services and investments, and institutional arrangements have been established for 
the municipalities to have arms-length relationships with private service providers. Consumer panels have 
been initiated as a mechanism for strengthening governance of service delivery (Table 2.6). 

26. 

Outcome 7: Improving access of the poor to urban infrastructure. The NSSED also aimed to 
provide essential urban infrastructure in participating municipalities, supported by the Bank’s Urban Land 
Management project (FY98). This has led to the adoption of more efficient methods of providing 
community infrastructure (where beneficiaries decide on the priorities and contribute to its financing), 
supported by land tenure reforms. However, poor urban land planning and enforcement remains a serious 
obstacle for cost effective investment decisions, and hampers service improvements. Also, delays in 
enacting the laws on land restitution and legalization of informal settlement have reduced the potential 
impact of the interventions of the Bank and other stakeholders (Table 2.7). 

Objective III: Fostering Human Development 

27. 

Social sector indicators place Albania at the bottom of European countries in the area of social 
development. The country faces a formidable agenda, with high levels of unemployment and high poverty 
prevalence). Net education enrollment rates, the quality and quantity of health infrastructure and access to 
health services have actually declined in the post-transition era. CAS02 represented a shift in the Bank’s 
approach from emergency-type interventions towards a focus on infrastructure and institution building at 
the central level. Outcomes towards this objective were also largely supported by interventions initiated 
prior to 2002, namely: Education Reform Project, Social Services Development Project and Health 
Recovery Project, as well as a strong policy reform element addressed through the CAS02 PRSC program 
(Annex C). 

28. 

Program Assessment: Outcomes with regard to fostering human resource development during 
implementation of CAS02 are assessed to have been achieved. Again, outcomes have varied substantially 
across various aspects of the social sector reforms.  

29. 

Outcome 1: Improving the educational outcomes. Despite the minor progress, the overall 
condition of the Albanian education sector remains quite poor at the end of the CAS02 period. However, 
the completion of sector strategies and policy papers on decentralization were critical milestones in the 
reforms of the sector, and concrete steps towards institutional reforms, preparation of actions plan for the 
implementation of the strategy and strengthening of assessment and examination capacities were initiated 
in this period. Albania has also completed its submission for the Education For All (EFA) initiative, 
which outlines specific targets to be met. However, other efforts aimed at increasing the enrollment and 
attainment level in primary and secondary education, introducing curriculum reforms in order to improve 
education quality and improving the monitoring of performance of the education sector, are in their 
nascent stage and yet to yield substantial results (Table 3.1).

Target: 17.8 in 2005 (for basic 
education); 
• No of teacher not meeting 
minimum qualifications reduced 
(Baseline: Primary 19%, 
Secondary 5.2% in 2002, Target: 
Primary 14.3 %, Secondary 3.8% 
in 2005); 
• Publication of the First Annual 
Education Performance Report in 
2004; 
• MoES regularly publishes data 
showing progress in meeting 
targets for gross enrollment. 

Although education spending as a percentage 
of total public expenditure increased over the 
CAS period, total spending declined from 
3.3% of GDP in 2001 to 3.1% in 2004. NER 
in 2005 for 8-year education increased to 
97%. The NER for secondary education 
reached only 46% in 2004 and thus fell short 
of the CAS target. A revised textbook policy 
was adopted and free textbooks provided for 
all basic education, plus free working books 
for the 80 poorest communes. Competitive 
bidding in the production of books led to 
major cuts in costs and improvements in the 
quality of books. The pupil/teacher ratio in 
basic education declined from 19 in 2002 to 
18 in 2004, and subsequently to 17.8 in 2005 
(for basic education, it was reduced from 19% 
in 2002 to 12.2% in 2004, while for secondary 
it was reduced from 5.2% in 2002 to 3.4% in 
2004). The number of 
teachers without 
adequate qualifications was reduced to 12.2%
in 2004 for basic education and 3.4% in 2004 
for secondary. The first Annual Education 
Performance Report was published in fall 
2004, and the MoES now regularly publishes 
data showing progress in meeting targets for 
gross enrollment 
rates. The process of 
curriculum reforms has also started. 

• Raising public 
education spending;  
• Increasing education 
attainment by 
increasing average 
schooling; 
• Increasing 
enrollment in both 
primary and 
secondary 
education; 
• Introducing 
curriculum reforms 
to improve 
education quality; 
• Reducing number of 
pupils per teaching 
personnel; 
• Reduce number of 
teachers without 
adequate education; 
• Better monitoring of 
performance of the 
education sector. 

30. 

Outcome 2: Improving the accessibility and quality of preventive/curative health services. 
The situation in the health sector has improved modestly, although from very poor initial conditions, and 
against a backdrop of a significant budget constraint. The quality of basic preventive and curative health 
services has improved, and the number of trained doctors and nurses has increased. A national HIV/AIDS 
strategy has also been adopted and there is an on-going effort to implement the health sector strategy and 
policy paper on decentralization of health services (Table 3.2).

2004; 
• Health expenditures increase 
(Baseline: 2.3 % of GDP in 
2002, Target: 2.6%of GDP in 
2004);

Full national coverage with health 
centers was maintained, and the quality 
of basic preventive/curative health 
services has been improved through the 
financing of construction/equipping of 
115 centers 
in poor areas. Health 
expenditures increased from 2.3% of 
GDP in 2001 to 2.6% in 2004, which 
was a modest 
increase, but an 
achievement against a backdrop of 
overall fiscal contraction. The number 
of doctors/nurses/ pharmacists increased 
from 20,862 in 2000 to 21,092 in 2004. 
A system for budget 
tracking and 
reporting now exists (e.g., budget law 
and other guidelines issued by MoF), 
institutionalization 
of 
the 
budget 
tracking and a reporting system, such as 
a system of regular health national 
accounts, is still lacking. A Health 
sector strategy and a policy paper on 
decentralization of health services have 
been completed, and an action plan for 
implementation has also been finalized, 
supported by the Bank PRSC program. 
Adequate Government resources made 
available 
to support priority Public 
Health Programs. Contract between 
TRHA and the HII was revised; but did 
not 
include 
performance-based 
remuneration system. 

• Increasing the proportion of 
the country covered by 
health centers, especially in 
poor areas;  
• Financing rehabilitation and 
equipment for health 
centers, particularly in poor 
areas; 
• Increased public financing 
of health services; 
• Increasing budget 
allocations for child 
vaccination and Female TT 
and Rubella coverage; 
• Increasing number of 
doctors, nurses, and 
pharmacists;  
• Institutionalizing a system 
for tracking health 
expenditure and reporting 
on health sector 
performance;  
• Ensuring that the Health 
budget is targeted towards 
priority needs identified by 
a health sector strategy. 

31. 

Outcome 3: Improving the sustainability and targeting of the social safety net. Despite 
implementation delays, improved overall delivery of social services through demand-driven community-
based services is being successfully piloted, while a policy paper on decentralization of social services 
was adopted in late 2004. A series of parametric reforms to the pension system supported by the PRSC 
program have contributed to improving the sustainability of the urban pension system. However, the 
pensions system (particularly the rural system) is not yet actuarially sound and its financial integrity is not 
yet ensured (Table 3.3).

RESULTS 

A Pension Policy Package was 
enacted in May 2002, and the agreed 
upon schedule of parametric changes 
was 
implemented 
(excluding 
indexation). A satisfactory policy for 
sustainable financing of community-
based 
services was adopted 
in 
September 2004 and a policy paper on 
decentralization of social services was 
adopted in late 2004. A 3-year work 
and investment program for the SII 
was adopted in May 2004. Targeting 
of NE has been 
substantially 
improved, with 
the Bank’s FY05 
Social Safety Net Review Study 
indicating 65.2% of recipients are 
poor. The contributor / beneficiary 
ratio of social insurance reached 1.08 
in 2003 and 1.15 by 2005.

D. 

Overall Bank Performance 

32. 

Overall, the Bank’s performance is rated as Satisfactory. Bank assistance to Albania was well 
aligned with key priorities identified in the country’s NSSED. Through lending and non-lending 
interventions, the Bank advanced reforms in numerous sectors and did achieve tangible results and 
outcomes. It has also played a key role in donor coordination, as well as attracting co-financing in most of 
its projects and programs. The Government considers the Bank as a valued and trusted partner, 
particularly in policy formulation. The Bank has also built considerable credibility with stakeholders, 
including external partners, the Parliament, the business community, representatives of the local 
government and NGOs, as documented by successive client surveys.  

33. 

The CAS02 employed an appropriate and effective mix of Bank instruments (development policy 
and investment lending as well as ESW/AAA) and achieved significant synergies between projects. For 
example, the PRSCs supported far-reaching institutional reforms in the social sector as well as the 
development of policies for delivery of social services while investment operations supported the 
upgrading of infrastructure and facilities within those sectors. Similarly linkages were also critical to 
successful outcomes in civil service reform and building of capacity in public financial management and 
accountability. However, while implementation of the CAS saw remarkable progress in fostering CDD 
projects (community works, fisheries, irrigation and drainage, etc.) that are now recognized as best 
practices in the ECA region and elsewhere, the small size and dispersion of such initiatives resulted in 
them having limited institutional impact. In these parts of the portfolio there was not substantial linkage 
between the ‘top down’ and ‘bottom up’ activities supported by the Bank. 

34. 

There are other areas in which the Bank could have done more work, including promoting the 
private sector development agenda, and environmental sustainability. The lending/AAA program also did 

 
 
 
 
 
 
Albania Country Assistance Strategy: CAS Annexes 

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 

66

not adequately address emerging issues such as those resulting from the rapid migration from rural areas. 
More coherence could also have been achieved in efforts to improve governance, by ensuring that sectoral 
governance consideration were mainstreamed into all lending/AAA products, and linked to top level 
reforms being supported by the PRSC program.  

35. 

The quality of the Bank’s project preparation, supervision and ESW was satisfactory.14 While the 
proportion of the Bank’s resources devoted to knowledge products was lower than the regional average, 
this allowed for enhanced supervision effort, which was appropriate in the Albanian context. At the outset 
of the new CAS lending program there are no problem or risky projects in the portfolio, due largely to the 
level of supervision effort. 

36. 

Bank Performance – Objective I. Overall, the Bank’s performance in strengthening governance 
and building institutions through CAS02 is judged as Satisfactory. In addition to strategic ESW,15 this 
pillar was directly supported by (i) the Public Administration Reform Project (PARP); (ii) the Legal and 
Judicial Reform (LJRP); and (iii) the Poverty Reduction Support Credit program of three adjustment 
credits (PRSCs). The mix of lending and AAA for support on governance and institutional building is 
judged to be appropriate. The Bank’s projects and programs were informed by substantial core diagnostic 
work (such as the CFAA, PEIR and CPAR) that had been undertaken prior to the CAS02. Throughout 
implementation, the monitoring and evaluation built into the PARP provided many of the inputs required 
for public administration reforms. The Bank also supported the NSSED process through AAA on poverty 
analysis as well as guidance on the annual progress reports in 2003 and 2004.  

37. 

The Bank’s interventions in support of strengthening governance and building institutions, 
particularly with regard to elimination of corruption and support to decentralization, have not led to fully 
satisfactory outcomes due to numerous design and implementation factors and to unanticipated changes in 
the policy environment that delayed and/or halted some reforms. Particularly relevant factors included: 
• Political commitment to the implementation of some laws lagged behind in areas such as improving 
the contestability of policy formulation, fighting corruption and procurement reforms. This 
contributed to perceptions of increased state capture in Albania; 
• The institutional framework for implementing the Anti-Corruption Plan (ACP) and other 
governance reforms remained weak, and many public sector reforms suffered from internal capacity 
constraints; 
• Some reforms in public financial management were delayed due to the delay in completing the 
modernization of the treasury system until 2006; 
• The Bank’s support for decentralization has not been comprehensive, and different projects have 
tackled the issue in an uncoordinated manner, despite the preparation of a comprehensive report on 
the subject; 
• Selectivity in institution building across sectors, and within sectors, proved to be difficult despite 
the intentions of CAS02; 
• Weak donor coordination and Government leadership delayed some reforms measures when Bank 
programs were designed on expectations of prior key reforms supported by other donors.16 

14 For projects exiting between FY97 and FY04, OED rated outcomes of 89% of the projects (by value) as 
satisfactory; 47% had substantial institutional development impact and 77% were considered to have likely 
sustainability.  
15 For example, the lessons learned from the 1997-02 institutional and governance reform program (covering anti-
corruption measures, public administration, tax and customs and the legal and judicial system) were taken into 
consideration in the design of the CAS02. 
16 In other public sector reform programs, improved donor coordination facilitated the implementation of Bank' 
programs and provided additional flexibility. For instance, budget reallocations in the PARP were possible because 

 
 
 
 
                                                 
Albania Country Assistance Strategy: CAS Annexes 

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 

67

• The lack of broad sector approaches as a base for some investment lending operations has been an 
obstacle to achieving changes in policies outside the scope of these projects.17  

38. 

Bank Performance – Objective II. Overall, the Bank’s performance in supporting sustainable 
private sector growth is rated as Satisfactory. Focusing on this area of Albania’s NSSED was appropriate, 
as confirmed by the Bank’s FY04 CEM that outlined the critical importance of attracting private 
investments. However, while the Bank’s support included a number of successful single operations that 
fully met their development objectives, the somewhat fragmented approach did not constitute a 
comprehensive private sector development strategy. The interventions of the Bank and other partners had 
limited success in leveraging structural reforms and produce a significant impact in private sector growth 
– with the exception of the financial and energy sectors. While the CAS did support a Rural Development 
Strategy (FY02), the broader private sector development agenda was not sufficiently supported by ESW, 
and the Bank’s role in facilitating dialogue between the government and the private sector was limited. 
Finally, while the CAS emphasized that high growth depends on increasing exports, only limited analysis 
was carried out to assess the business environment and sectoral constraints to export development. This 
dearth of analytic work can be at least partly explained by the need for selectivity during the formulation 
of the CAS02. 

39. 

Support to agriculture and rural development through pre-CAS02 and CAS02 operations has been 
innovative and effective.18 Various operations have helped strengthen communities as the key 
constituencies to form a counterpart to the local governments and other related decision-makers (bottom-
up CDD approaches) and resulted in tangible outcomes and results. Towards the end of the CAS period 
the Bank’s focus has shifted to long-term local government capacity building through institutionalizing 
citizen participation in all phases of infrastructure investment with considerable tangible impacts. Bank 
support has adopted an "incremental approach" where sub-sector strategies have been developed during 
implementation of the projects through intensive policy dialogue and provision of technical assistance. 
The overall impact of the Bank’s interventions on sectoral reforms and policy formulation remained 
limited, however, due to their small size, dispersion, and the lack of emphasis on institutional and policy 
change within the relevant line ministries. The environmental sub-sector has also fallen short of achieving 
substantial institutional and policy strengthening, in part due to the decision to delay the envisaged 
projects until the last year of CAS02. 

40. 

Bank support to the energy sector has been highly satisfactory. CAS02 recognized the precarious 
power situation as a major threat to continued macroeconomic stability and sustained growth. It 
emphasized the importance of policy and institutional reforms necessary for improved sector 
performance, privatization and sustainability. The Bank financed and played a critical role in supervising 
a comprehensive Energy Sector Study during 2002, which served as the basis for an Energy Strategy, 
adopted by the GoA in 2003, as well as a basis for the power sector reforms and for power sector 
investment projects.19 The Bank supported the preparation of a Power Sector Policy Statement providing 

of close cooperation with DFID and SIDA, who took over parts of financial management reform. Cooperation with 
UNDP and EU has also been good in the support of policy formulation processes. 
17 For instance, the reforms in the irrigation sub-sector had little impact the way government did its business. 
18 At the beginning of CAS02 projects under implementation included: Microcredit, Irrigation and Drainage II, 
Fishery, Forestry and Community Works. New operations under CAS02 included Water Resources Management 
Project, Natural Resources Management project, and Community Works II. A few important non-lending TA 
activities have also been identified to develop the policy dialogue into concrete action programs and supplement the 
on-going projects. These included the Rural Strategy and the Poverty Study (both in 2002) as well as the 
Participatory Budgeting Pilot and the decentralization study. 
19 Bank financing to the power sector included the Power Sector Rehabilitation and Restructuring and the Power 
Sector Generation and Restructuring Projects. Both projects addressed the most critical deficiencies in power 
infrastructure, which contributed to the crisis in the sector and its macroeconomic fallout.

the framework for sector restructuring, strengthening of the regulatory agency, creation of a new 
electricity market, and fulfillment of Albania’s commitments under the Energy Community of South East 
Europe. The Bank was then actively involved in the development of the Action Plan, its annual updates, 
and in close monitoring of the achievement of the quarterly targets specified in the Action Plan. The 
synergistic combination of investment lending, sector dialogue and sector work was key for successful 
power sector reform, and the Bank has played a leadership role in donor coordination and the sector 
dialogue with the Government, and in facilitating co-financing by other donors.20 

41. 

Bank Performance-Objective III. The Bank’s performance 
in supporting 
the human 
development agenda is rated as Satisfactory. Despite relying to some extent on an overly optimistic 
timetable for improving extremely weak institutions, the Bank was able to achieve lasting outcomes and 
build the basis for further enhancements to service delivery. Wavering political commitment to reforms 
coupled with the political decision to decentralize responsibilities for service delivery quickly, in the 
absence of a coherent strategy for decentralization, did reduce impact, as did occasional sub-optimal 
donor coordination in the sector.21 

42. 

A 2005 Client Assessment Survey also addressed the effectiveness of the Bank support in project 
preparation and implementation. Overall, Bank’s stakeholders appreciate the technical expertise of the 
Bank in Project design and implementation. The results show marked improvements in perceptions of the 
Bank’s effectiveness in 2004 compared to 2001. Stakeholders also rated bank non-lending services as 
very important, and indicated that the Bank’s delivery of these services has been highly effective (Box 2).  

E. 

LESSONS LEARNED – IMPLICATIONS FOR THE NEW CAS 

43. 

(ii) 

Experience since 1991 through the preparation and implementation of three CASs points to some 
clear lessons for the design of future lending operations. The implementation of the CAS02 pointed to 
additional lessons to inform and improve the design of the new strategy. These include:  
(i) Clear sector strategic frameworks should precede Bank financing: The Bank’s financial support 
should be directed towards sectors in which there is a clear strategy and manifest commitment of 
stakeholders to its implementation. The NSSED (PRSP) needs to be augmented by such sector 
strategies. Where such sectoral strategies do not exist, or ownership is lacking, the support of the 
Bank should be directed towards strengthening analysis, policy reform and strategy development 
through economic sector work; 
Increased selectivity (fewer and larger projects and programs) in the assistance program: 
While the role of IDA in initiating reforms in almost all sectors was relevant in the early 
transition years and during crises, more selectivity is necessary in the new strategy. The lending 
portfolio of the Bank in the last CASs has been characterized by a large number of small projects, 
in almost all sectors, with a relatively large number of repeat operations. With around half of the 
Bank’s direct budgetary resources allocated for project supervision, ESW has been crowded out 
and the analytic underpinnings of the Bank’s work weakened. The Bank should resist pressures to 
become involved in more sectors; 
(iii) Creation of long-lasting and effective institutions: A gradual shift from implementation of 
projects through autonomous Project Implementation Units (PIUs) towards implementation 
through regular administrative structures of government is warranted to ensure strengthening of 
the public administration, capacity building, and the sustainability of interventions; 

20 Cofinancing and parallel financing with EBRD, EIB, KfW and Italy supported the various energy projects as well 
as technical assistance support from a number of other bilateral donors. 
21 Some co-financiers failed to deliver support to key activities resulting in cancellation of some project components 
(e.g. the Health Reform Project). 

 
 
 
 
 
                                                 
Albania Country Assistance Strategy: CAS Annexes 

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 

69

(iv) Creating and crowding-in constituencies for changes: Change can be achieved and made more 
endurable by creating or crowding in stakeholders (e.g., with civil service reforms). By creating 
new categories of stakeholders with the real incentives to change not only their behavior but the 
behavior of other influential groups such as politicians; 
(v) Governance should permeate all development interventions: Governance cannot be effectively 
addressed as a ‘sector’, but needs to be mainstreamed into sectoral interventions and into the 
detailed design of projects. Increased efforts to collaborate across sectors and maintain an overt 
focus on governance – especially on service delivery – is likely to achieve better outcomes; 
(vi) Improved donor coordination require Government leadership: even with a PRSP, the 
Government needs to take an active role in the process of donor coordination, and in order for this 
to happen donors must be prepared to truly align their assistance to national priorities; 
(vii) Adopt an outcome-oriented approach: Design new interventions with clear outcome targets and 
establish monitorable and realistic indicators in line with the national priorities; 
(viii) Incorporate investment lending into Sector-Wide approaches: Some sector investment lending 
has had a narrow focus, which has not adequately addressed urgent needs for sector-wide change 
in policies, sector efficiency, corruption and transparency. Investment lending can have an 
important impact on budget formulation in line ministries if attention is paid to the usage of the 
government's own funds as well as those of the Bank. This implies that the sector assistance 
should depart from a ‘project’ approach towards a more sector wide and integrated approach; 
(ix) Addressing fiduciary issues requires a systematic approach: Project-specific fiduciary controls 
can be effective in minimizing fiduciary abuses in Bank-funded projects but they fail to address 
broad fiduciary issues that undermine sustainable development. The Bank should take a more 
comprehensive approach to fiduciary safeguards in addition to project specific controls; 
(x) More support to areas with high poverty rates: An analysis of the portfolio reveals a 
concentration in Central and Southern Albania. With the detailed poverty data now available 
highlighting the Northeast of Albania as the poorest area, the new CAS should place special 
emphasis on addressing the known profile of poverty.

ANNEX 3: IFC STRATEGY IN ALBANIA, FY06-FY09 

1. 

IFC’S ACTIVITIES TO DATE 

As of September 2005, IFC has committed about US$ 125 million in Albania, allocated to the financial 
sector (7%), general manufacturing (37%), infrastructure (33%), and oil and gas (23%). In the current 
portfolio, IFC has committed US$ 69 million and has mobilized about US$ 6 million as syndicated loans 
in 6 projects. IFC’s disbursement factor is very high-about 90% of total commitments. In terms of IFC’s 
committed portfolio per capita, Albania ranks the fourth in the ECA region. 

2. 

IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PAST CAS 

The World Bank’s Country Assistance Strategy for Albania, approved in May 2002, outlined the 
following IFC’s strategic priorities: (i) strengthening the financial sector; (ii) supporting SME 
development; (iii) acting as a catalyst in key privatizations; and (iv) providing support for private sector 
investments in infrastructure. Overall, IFC has achieved good results during the last CAS period, 
supporting private sector development through direct investments and donors-funded technical assistance 
programs. During FY02-05, IFC has committed US$ 66 million, or about 95% of current portfolio 
projects. In addition, IFC has completed or is in the process of implementing 9 technical assistance 
projects focusing on institutional and capacity building in the financial sectors including insurance, 
leasing, access to information for SMEs, preparation of domestic companies for EU accession, 
administrative barriers to FDI and housing finance. Slow privatization in infrastructure, corruption, 
corporate governance issues and reputation risks, however, have limited IFC to act as a catalyst in 
privatization of strategic sectors and related investment program in infrastructure, as well as in financing 
projects with local sponsors. 

• 

During FY03-05 IFC has financed, in coordination with the EBRD, three projects in insurance, 
manufacturing, and telecom sectors:  
• 
In 2003, IFC acquired 20% stake of INSIG, one of Albania’s leading insurers. During the second 
stage, with the assistance of the IFC and EBRD, the Government of Albania will complete the full 
privatization of INSIG by divesting its remaining stake and relinquishing its controlling interest to a 
reputable technical partner; 
In 2003, IFC has also committed € 42.5 million (€ 7.5 million syndicated loan through local banks), 
to support further development of the second nationwide digital GSM cellular network in Albania, 
which is owned and operated by Vodafone Albania. The project is expected to increase competition, 
lower costs, and provide approximately 95% of the population with the ability to access Vodafone 
Albania’s mobile telecommunications network by the end of 2005; 
In 2005, IFC signed a US$ 130 million project to establish a new modern production line in Fushe 
Kruja Cement Factory, with aggregate annual cement capacity of 1.3 million tons. The project will 
reduce Albania’s dependence on imported cement, enhance the domestic market for construction 
materials and facilitate rapid reconstruction and development of Albania’s infrastructure. IFC has 
committed US$ 30 million from its own account. The financing represents the largest foreign direct 
investment in Albania’s manufacturing sector since the country’s transition to a market economy in 
the early 1990s. 

• 

Most of IFC’s technical assistance program in Albania is delivered through its Southeast Europe 
Enterprise Development (SEED) facility. During FY03-05, SEED activities in Albania included: 
• Addressing some of the crippling problems of SME financing through the development of, and 
advocacy for, new financing solutions. A law on financial leasing was introduced in 2005 which has 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Albania Country Assistance Strategy: CAS Annexes 
81
_____________________________________________________________________________________________ 

proved to be a valuable financial tool to supplement conventional lending to SMEs. In addition, a 
large Housing Finance TA program is being developed for the region, including Albania; 
• Working in supply chains has led to the introduction of international food safety standards at the 
company level to add to the work on the distribution chains currently operating in the country; 
• Strengthening the ability of business associations to successfully advocate for regulatory changes that 
affect the business enabling environment. SEED helped to introduce the Business Advisory Council 
as a leading voice in the public-private dialogue; 
• Build awareness about the importance of implementing EU standards and systems as well assisting 
export-oriented SMEs to implement them; 
• Helping SMEs cut through judicial red tape and reduce the cost of litigation, SEED introduced 
Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) mechanisms in the region including in Albania. 

In 2002, the Foreign Investment Advisory Service (FIAS) conducted a study of the administrative barriers 
to investment. The study included detailed policy and institutional recommendations, which were 
incorporated in an Action Plan on Removing Administrative Barriers to Investors approved by the 
Council of Ministers in August 2003. A high-quality self-assessment report, made available by the 
Government in March 2005, provided evidence of progress, but also identified remaining gaps and 
challenges to improve the regulatory business environment. FIAS is currently involved with assisting the 
Government to broaden regulatory and institutional capacity for reforms. 

3. 

IFC STRATEGY DURING FY06-FY09 

Development constraints: At an average annual growth rate of more than 6% per year over the past 
decade, Albania’s performance has been impressive. Yet, there are concerns about the sustainability of 
high rates of economic growth in the future. The total factor productivity growth has slowed in recent 
years, and thus future economic growth will depend in a major way on the contribution of the private 
sector in capital accumulation. Remittances do not constitute a solid basis for long-term economic 
development and export-driven growth expansion is not taking place. In addition, the government has a 
limited fiscal space and donor-provided funds cannot fill the investment needs in infrastructure. So far, 
FDI has been among the lowest in the region.  

The domestic market is small, domestic credit to enterprises is limited and the bulk of financing is short 
term up to 1-year maturity. Entrepreneurs often lack much of the expertise needed for a modern market 
economy. Corruption is high and the judiciary lacks experience with commercial disputes, and there is 
poor law enforcement. Now that the country has made significant progress on macroeconomic 
stabilization, policy issues affecting fair competition are among the most significant impediments to 
private sector development. Underdeveloped infrastructure sector is holding back the private sector 
growth, including in sectors with huge potential for growth such as in tourism.  

IFC’s Objectives: In this environment, there is a clear role for the IFC to play in Albania through 
promoting private sector development (one of the two pillars of the current CAS). However, given the 
difficult business environment, close coordination with the Bank and building on the Bank’s efforts to 
address many of the constraints is even more important. IFC’s development objectives in Albania during 
the current CAS (FY06-FY09) are to:  
(i) 
facilitate privatization of strategic sectors and promote private sector investments in infrastructure 
sectors through PPP - in close cooperation with the Bank;  
(ii) 
facilitate financial intermediation through introduction of new financial products in the market;  
(iii) promote external competitiveness of the economy through promotion and support to local export-
oriented companies to become more competitive in the regional market;  
improve investors’ confidence and help increase foreign investment flows;  

(iv) 

 
 
 
 
 
 
Albania Country Assistance Strategy: CAS Annexes 
82
_____________________________________________________________________________________________ 

(v) 

contribute to reducing petty corruption through facilitating outsourcing of services from public to 
private sector; 
(vi) promote market liberalization through encouraging fair practices and effective competition and 
discouraging monopolistic behaviors. 

IFC’s strategy targets a broad range of sectors such as financial markets, telecommunications, 
infrastructure, social sectors, tourism, and general manufacturing. IFC support will include technical 
assistance and advisory services components aimed at improving the investment climate and promoting 
private sector development particularly in drafting legislation and advising on strategic privatizations.  

In the past, close IDA-IFC cooperation has been instrumental in helping Albania move forward and 
achieve impressive results with financial sector privatization. Further collaboration and effective 
cooperation between IFC and the Bank will be important for the WBG to play a catalytic role in key 
privatizations of strategic sectors and infrastructure development and in implementation of a regulatory 
framework enabling sound market competition. 

3.1. Manufacturing and Corporate Sector 

Manufacturing remains a priority for IFC operations in Albania. This sector is one of the potential engines 
of growth in Albania, as well as other Balkan countries, as became evident from the recent globalization 
trends and the shift of manufacturing activities towards developing countries. Manufacturing sector is 
likely to attract increasing levels of FDI and in turn will enhance transfer of technology, modern 
management, corporate governance, and innovative logistical methods. Albania is expected to improve its 
competitiveness to attract FDI into the sector not only because of its labor cost advantages but also 
because of the expected improvements in the business environment and political stability.  

IFC’s strategic objective is to support competitive export-oriented and/or import-substitution companies 
through post-privatization support and through improved access to finance for SMEs. IFC will facilitate 
FDI in Albania through debt and equity investment with strategic partners, particularly when a greenfield 
project is envisaged. IFC will support post-privatization restructuring in key sectors such as export-
oriented companies in agribusiness/food processing and light industry and construction materials. IFC 
will continue to play an important role in improving corporate governance, environmental standards and 
sharing best practices.  

Export promotion is vital for future economic growth and reduction of the large trade deficit. One area in 
which IFC and the Bank would jointly explore is the possibility of turning the numerous industrial sites 
that were previously owned by state enterprises (and currently privately/publicly owned) into industrial 
parks. Many of the sites have existing industrial infrastructure, and with relatively less complicated in 
property rights; but they lay idle today. In the meantime, new greenfield investments, including small and 
medium sized export oriented manufacturing industries (e.g., textile, food-processing, leather goods, etc.) 
that are critically needed cannot take place without availability of specific earmarked sites. This is a 
potential area in which Albania could benefit from international best practice (Ireland, Czech Republic, 
Singapore, China, etc.) that the WBG (IFC, IDA/IBRD and MIGA) can bring to Albania.  

Technical assistance to SME clients in the region is handled increasingly through SEED (Southeast 
Europe Enterprise Development), which has been leading IFC's effort to develop and promote the SME 
sector in the region. SEED, replaced with the Private Enterprise Partnership Southeast Europe (PEP-SE) 
in July 2005, will continue to work on improving the business environment for SMEs and helping them to 
gain access to finance, developing technical and managerial skills and improve their access to 
information. Also, PEP-SE will continue to work on strengthening the institutional and regulatory 
framework for EU-oriented competition and industrial polices (See box 1). 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Albania Country Assistance Strategy: CAS Annexes

_____________________________________________________________________________________________ 

BOX A3.1: SEED (PEP-SE) ALBANIA 
The Southeast European Enterprise Development Facility (SEED) is a multi-donor partnership, led by IFC, in 
support of SME development in Western Balkans. In 2004, SEED was fully integrated into the IFC regional strategy 
by focusing on local implementation of new financing solutions, SME supply chain management advisory work, 
supporting the development of business membership organizations, and supporting selected institutions critical to 
the development of the private sector. This approach ensures integration of SEED’s products with the needs of key 
partners and IFC’s investment strategy. With SEED's mandate completed in June 2005, IFC is currently planning 
programs through PEP-SE (started operations in July 2005) that target key private sector development issues such 
as: (i) introduction of commercial mediation; (ii) development of a regional recycling supply chain; (iii) introduction 
of International and EU manufacturing standards; and (iv) a targeted company level corporate governance program 
in the region, whose performance will contribute to improvements in their corporate governance standards. PEP-SE 
will continue to place a strong emphasis on the development of sustainable local capacities to support SME 
development initiatives in the longer term. Furthermore program roll out will be focused on a specific number of 
sectors of critical importance and where the TA has the best opportunity to complement IFC investment activities. 

3.1. 

Financial Sector 

The financial sector in Albania is in private hands. Despite recent increases in bank lending in 2004, the 
level of banking intermediation in Albania remains one of the lowest in Europe. While the legal, 
institutional and supervisory framework for the financial sector is in line with international practices, 
implementation remains weak, especially in the insurance sector. Financial intermediation suffers from a 
business environment not conductive to robust and sound lending practices. Enterprises are characterized 
by poor transparency and disclosure of financial information. Financial reporting is generally unreliable. 
Uncertainty of property rights hinders secured lending. Judicial procedures for collateral enforcement are 
weakened by poor performance of court bailiffs and auction procedures. Lack of credit information on 
borrowers continues to be an impediment to access to finance.  

Banks appear to be very liquid. IFC, rather than providing just financing, will thus focus on encouraging 
and helping financial institutions to develop new products. IFC intents to help the banks with leasing, 
renewable energy finance products, housing finance, and derivative products involving swaps to support 
long-term local currency loans, just to mention a few. Further to the strengthening of the INSIG position, 
IFC will also work with the Government and the EBRD to identify a strategic partner so as to privatize 
the Company as soon as possible.  

The expansion of private sector credit especially to SMEs has been slow. Midsize companies, new 
entrepreneurs, and small businesses remain largely dependent on self-finance, while the banking sector 
still offers limited products, short maturities and at relatively high costs. IFC will continue to support 
SMEs through helping the financial sector to develop new products targeting SMEs, through provision of 
micro finance, local capacity building, and business environment improvement conducive to SME 
development. IFC has so far invested directly in a number of micro-finance banks and will continue to be 
in the forefront of promoting micro-finance in the region. In Albania, IFC supported ProCredit Bank 
which has been successful in helping the microfinance business for entrepreneurs with limited access to 
credit from the banking system. 

3.2. 

Infrastructure  

Improving infrastructure in Albania will be important to support the country’s economic growth and its 
regional integration. Infrastructure development through private sector participation will be a key priority 
of IFC’s strategy. Lack of financing to infrastructure and lack of reform in the sector add to the existing 
bottlenecks to sustainable growth and private sector development. Albania’s competitiveness and 
sustainable development is being undermined due to high transport costs, still recurrent power shortages, 
and problematic access and quality of sanitation. So far, private sector interest in investing in 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Albania Country Assistance Strategy: CAS Annexes 
84
_____________________________________________________________________________________________ 

infrastructure in Western Balkans, including in Albania, has been limited. Therefore, IFC will work 
closely with the Government and the Bank to attract private sector financing in the infrastructure sectors 
through public-private partnership (PPP). The PPP structure might be helpful in improving the risk 
perception of infrastructure transaction in Albania by mitigating different components of the risk in a 
project. IFC and the Bank will have a joint comprehensive approach to transparency and competition 
policy in infrastructure including close coordination between the regulators and the anti-monopoly 
authority.  

IFC’s will focus on promoting private sector investments in power, telecom, transport, and water sectors. 
Pursuing the opportunities to implement the PPP approach, as a way to attract private sector in 
infrastructure, IFC expects to see some tangible results in Albania in the near future. In cooperation with a 
number of donors, IFC established PEP-SE infrastructure to help public sector entities in Western 
Balkans attract private investment, particularly in energy, transport and water and sanitation (see Box 
A3.2). In addition, the recent grants from PPIAF to the Ministries of Transport and Territorial Adjustment 
to design the framework for public-private partnerships in the highway and water supply sectors will 
assist private provision of infrastructure.  

BOX A3.2: BALKAN INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT 

A poor and unreliable infrastructure continues to discourage private investors and hinder economic growth in the 
Balkan region. In turn, slower economic growth reduces the availability of government funds to improve 
infrastructure. To break this cycle, IFC established PEP-SE Infrastructure in cooperation with a number of donors. 
The activity will help public sector entities in the Southeast Europe to attract private sector investments in 
infrastructure, focusing on the energy, transportation, and water and sanitation sectors. It reflects the World Bank 
Group strategy to broaden engagement in this sector to ensure efficient, affordable, and sustainable delivery of 
infrastructure services. The activity will help identify, develop, structure, and reach financial closure on 
infrastructure projects, so that committed public sector entities can engage more effectively with the private sector 
and attract investments critical to the region’s economic development. This activity will start operating in FY06. 

3.3.1. Power Sector: 

Despite the substantial progress achieved since 2001 in improving the performance of the power sector, 
the sector still suffers from significant inefficiencies linked to electricity theft, high technical losses, and 
non-payment of dues. In addition, electricity supply is constrained by insufficient domestic capacity and 
import transmission constraints.  Notwithstanding recent progress made in initiating restructuring of the 
sector, the state power company (KESH) still needs further institutional and managerial support. The 
power sector has been capital-constrained for many years and needs significant investment for 
rehabilitation, upgrading and addition of new capacity. Continuing financial assistance by donors, which 
has been substantial so far, will continue to be necessary but by itself will be inadequate to meet total 
capital needs. Neither KESH nor GoA has adequate resources to meet these capital needs. Traditional 
solutions to this situation include the restructuring of the sector to attract private sector involvement in 
both generation and distribution thorough appropriate legal and regulatory frameworks, restructuring of 
KESH through unbundling into separate distribution, transmission and generation enterprises and 
establishing a modern and competitive electricity market with clear rules for financial settlements.  

The GoA, with support from the World Bank and other donors, has been implementing reforms under the 
Power Sector Policy Statement, adopted in April 2002. Some of the major achievements have been the 
establishment of the Transmission System Operator (TSO) as a joint stock company, development of a 
Transitional Market Model, and Market Rules approved by the Regulator. In addition, the Government 
and the Regulator are proceeding with implementation of the commitments agreed to under the Athens 
MOU in terms of primary and secondary legislation, electricity market implementation, environmental 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Albania Country Assistance Strategy: CAS Annexes 
85
_____________________________________________________________________________________________ 

legislation, and other measures necessary for market opening to support Albania’s integration within the 
Energy Community of Southeast Europe (ECSEE) and interconnection with the Union for the Co-
ordination of Transmission of Electricity (UCTE) system. The restructuring process of KESH has already 
started with allocation of existing assets and liabilities of KESH to the successor companies. The average 
tariff has been adjusted annually (estimated at about US$70/per 1,000 kWh in 2005), KESH’s financial 
performance for 2004 has been strong with a pre-tax profit (unaudited) of US$ 83 million, compared to 
US$ 51 million in 2003, and the collection and losses targets have been met.  

IFC shares the Government’s objective of increasing private sector participation in the power sector as 
soon as conditions permit to do so. A study, financed by IDA, is underway and this will provide 
recommendations on a number of critical issues, such as the number of distribution and generation 
companies to be created on unbundling of KESH, degree of separation of the wire and supply side of the 
distribution functions, developing appropriate incentive mechanisms to ensure that the required 
investments are made after privatization, nature of privatization (sale of assets, concessions, management 
contract), sequence and schedule of privatization, etc. The Government will embark on preparation of a 
detailed privatization strategy of the sector after consideration of the recommendation of the study.  

IFC will look for opportunities to support the privatization in power sector offering its advisory service as 
well as its financing, possibly combined with a guarantee instrument from the Bank to cover for political 
and regulatory risks. In addition, IFC would consider financing new power generation investments, 
subject to being satisfied with the strategic investor as well as financial and economic viability of the 
investments.  

3.3.2. Telecommunications:  

During the last CAS period, IFC has showed its commitment and readiness to help the government with 
the restructuring and privatization of the state run company Albtelecom. With the Government re-
launching of the privatization of Albtelecom, IFC would consider post-privatization financing for 
Albtelecom, subject to satisfaction with the strategic investor as well as with the financial and economic 
viability of the investments. 

Improving legal and regulatory framework is crucial for the future development of the sector and 
successful privatization of Albtelecom. Key to success in opening telecommunications markets to 
competition is the establishment of an independent regulatory body. Accordingly, IFC has initiated and 
mobilized, 
in coordination with 
the Bank and EBRD, a 
technical assistance 
to support 
Telecommunications Regulatory Authority (TRA). IFC is helping to implement a needs assessment of the 
additional skills, human resources and organizational changes necessary to ensure that TRA has the 
capacity to effectively oversee policy changes and structural reforms leading to the liberalization of the 
sector. This work is expected to be followed by other technical assistance support and will be monitored 
closely by the relevant government bodies. 

3.3.3. Transportation: 

Albania is a natural transit route between Western Balkans and EU Member States. The elimination of 
border crossing obstacles in land transport, ports, as well as oil/gas pipeline projects calls for harmonized 
regional investments with potential involvement from the private sector. With a regional integration 
approach strategy in mind, IFC will follow any developments and look for opportunities to facilitate 
private sector involvement especially in port and pipeline projects. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Albania Country Assistance Strategy: CAS Annexes 
86
_____________________________________________________________________________________________ 

3.3.4. Water and Sanitation: 

Although 80% of Albania’s urban population has access to piped water, the supply is intermittent, and the 
quality of drinking water is far below internationally accepted standards. Inadequate maintenance and 
repairs and the absence of metering and operational control have resulted in water losses of over 50% of 
water production in most cities. The situation in rural areas is worse: access to piped water supply has 
decreased from 75% in 1989 to 50% today, and areas without piped supply rely on heavily contaminated 
sources. Unreliable water supply and the pollution of beach areas by raw sewage is a major obstacle for 
the development of tourism. 

IDA has been helping the government to develop its National Water Supply and Sanitation Sector 
Strategy and to focus on increasing private provision of these services. IFC will explore ways to approach 
municipal financing also through public-private partnership to attract private operators with a focus in the 
city of Tirana, the capital of Albania. 

3.4. 

Outsourcing Services to the Private Sector  

In an effort to bolster quality and efficiency of services, Albanian Government is currently considering 
outsourcing certain services to private companies. The first major candidates include the customs 
administration and payment systems. The Government hopes to outsource revenue collections and 
payment systems services to private contractors to facilitate trade, increase the transparency and reduce 
corruption. It is currently looking into successful models implemented in other countries. Similarly, IFC 
can help the outsourcing of services to the private sector through methodical and transparent approaches 
in areas such as land titles and certification, issuance of ID and passports, income tax calculation and 
collection, payroll management, motor vehicle registration and licensing, driver license issuance etc. The 
outsourcing of some of these services can invigorate the service market in Albania and will reduce public 
spending, red tape, corruption and  will increase the satisfaction of citizens and clients.  

Also, Albanian government is exploring ways to make best use of country’s scarce resources to improve 
health care services for public patients under the national health insurance system. The government 
strategy is to explore the additional opportunities that the private sector offers through public-private 
partnership in the health sector. Albania has some experience in this area, having previously outsourced 
limited ancillary services at several hospital locations. Following IFC’s successful PPP advisory mandates 
for outsourcing selected healthcare services and strengthening of the strategic purchasing capabilities of 
the national health insurance house, the government initiated a dialogue with IFC to explore opportunities 
to further develop PPPs in the health sector. This dialogue is ongoing.

MIGA’S NON-GUARANTEE TA: THE EUROPEAN INVESTOR OUTREACH PROGRAM (EIOP) 

The European Investor Outreach Program has been established by MIGA to promote Foreign Direct 
Investment (FDI) in the Western Balkans (Albania, Bosnia & Herzegovina, Croatia, FYR of Macedonia, 
Serbia and Montenegro). Under this initiative, a project office has been established in Vienna, staffed 
with MIGA’s investment promotion specialists. Acting as a partner to potential investors, the office 
provides full support to companies through all phases of their investment. It delivers information and 
investment facilitation services on a confidential basis and free of charge.  

2.1. 

EIOP Information and Research Services 

The Western Balkans is a dynamic region for investment with an improving economic outlook and 
overall business climate. However, up to now, the lack of relevant, sector-specific information about 
investment opportunities and conditions in the region has been a major challenge for companies interested 
in investing in the region. 

To overcome this lack of information, EIOP has conducted an extensive study on doing business in the 
region. The study will provide potential investors with the kinds of information they find most useful 
when making site selection decisions: high-quality information on operating cost and conditions in each 
country. Moreover, the countries of the region will be benchmarked as site locations, both against each 
other and against the most important competing countries, for example, the new EU member states. 

The findings of this study will be available in the form of sector briefs for selected sectors with the 
highest potential for investment. EIOP will present these findings to interested investors free of charge. 
Moreover, EIOP can assist potential investors in identifying site options and in assessing the optimum site 
location within the region. 

2.2. EIOP Facilitation Services 

The EIOP offers a number of investment facilitation services to help potential investors in making their 
investments in the target region a success: 
• Close cooperation with investment promotion agencies: The EIOP works very closely with the 
national and local investment promotion agencies in the region to help ensure a top quality 
support service to prospective investors at all stages of the investment process; 
• Network of key contacts in the target region: The EIOP draws upon a network of high-quality 
contacts in all the countries of the target region. EIOP uses this network to ensure that the needs 
of a potential investor are fully understood by government officials at the national and local 
levels; 
• Assistance in risk mitigation tools: The EIOP can provide potential investors with access to risk 
mitigation tools via its extensive network of contacts among national and international providers 
(MIGA) of political and commercial risk insurance; 
• Assistance in the sourcing of finance: The EIOP can introduce potential investors to additional 
sources of finance, if required. The program links companies to national as well as international 
providers of finance (e.g. European Development Finance Institutions, EBRD and IFC).

ANNEX 5: CAS CONSULTATIONS AND OUTREACH 

1. 

CONSULTATIONS AND OUTREACH 

1. 
Extensive consultations underpinned the preparation of the CAS. Internally, the whole country 
team (both in headquarters as well as in the Country Office) has been actively involved in the preparation 
of the strategy including IFC and MIGA members of the team. This was assisted by the support of OPCS, 
PREM, SFRCR, FRM, OED and various other networks. 

2. 
In Albania, the Country Office has embarked on consultations with all stakeholders since late 
2004. The team started the consultation process by preparation and completion of a Clients Assessment 
Survey in December 2004 (see Annex 2 CASCR for the main results of the survey). Some 137 
stakeholders from government, parliament, civil society, private sector, media and academic institutions 
responded to the questionnaire. The results show increasing appreciation of the World Bank in Albania 
(compared with a previous survey in 2001) and overall endorsement of the priority areas of the Bank and 
its effectiveness in delivering the support. A special CAS Electronic Discussion Forum has been 
established to ensure wider participation of all stakeholders in the CAS preparation. The consultation 
meetings have considerably informed both the CASCR and the new strategy.  

3. 
A CAS government counterpart team (comprising most central and line ministries) has been 
formed to guide the preparation of the strategy. The Government team conducted a thorough review of 
Bank operations in Albania, their effectiveness as well as the lessons drawn from the decade-and-a-half of 
IDA support. They reviewed government’s challenges and priorities in light of the NSSED and presented 
a list of priority program of interventions to be supported in the CAS (FY06-09). The Government team 
also made an effort to prioritize the various proposals of support presented by line ministries. The final 
list of programs and projects were presented to the Bank prior to the July elections. After the finalization 
of the results of the elections, the CAS has also been discussed with new Government. These 
consultations concluded in a joint retreat with the whole Cabinet in Durres on 12 September 2005. The 
new Government endorsed the CAS program and made several requests and suggestions which have been 
incorporated in the final version of the CAS.  

4. 
Consultations with parliamentary commissions and groups have markedly sharpened the focus 
of proposed interventions under the CAS06. These consultations started with a large consultative 
meeting under the auspices of the Economic Commission, where all members of the commissions, heads 
of other commissions as well as leaders of party groups attended. The meeting enabled the team to assess 
the national priorities at various stages of CAS preparations as presented by the representatives of all 
political parties in Parliament. A special meeting on agriculture, environment and natural resources was 
organized on May 9, 2005 under the auspices of the Agriculture Commission of the Parliament. 
Parliamentarians praised the Bank’s contribution to the sector in the last 14 years and agreed it was 
effective, sustainable and innovative. They stressed the importance of improving donor coordination in 
the sector, of integrating various projects to ensure greater synergy in the interventions and to consolidate 
or eliminate PIUs. In future, they recommended increased support to rural roads, fisheries, forestry, and 
increased coverage of “protected areas”. Finally, the Parliamentarians agreed that the agro-processing 
sector has huge potentials for growth and export promotion, subsequently urging the Bank to increase its 
support to the sub-sector.  

5. 
Extensive consultations with major political parties on the CAS program took place in the first 
half of 2005. With the parliamentary elections concluded in July 2005, these consultations were critical to 
ensure that the support program is focused on national priorities and has the support of all stakeholders. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Albania Country Assistance Strategy: CAS Annexes 
91
_____________________________________________________________________________________________ 

Despite the differences in party platforms during the election campaign, the consultations demonstrated 
wide consensus on the effectiveness of the Bank support and the priorities of the NSSED. All political 
parties stressed on the importance of focusing the new program on governance, rule of law, public 
administrative reforms, enhancing the business environment, upgrading of infrastructure (particularly 
roads and energy), ensuring establishment of efficient land market and resolving land tenure issues, 
natural resources management and further support to the social sector (education, health and social 
assistance). Following the announcement of official results of the parliamentary elections, close contact 
and consultations with the Democratic Party (DP) also took place. 

6. 
Two workshops were organized in north Albania (Kukes) and south Albania (Fier) for 
representatives of local governments and civil society organizations in the respective regions. The first 
consultation meeting with the local government and civil society at the regional level took place on March 
18, 2005 at the Municipality of Kukes. Representatives from municipalities, communes, civil society, 
media as well as forestry association representatives from northern regions of Albania attended the 
meeting. The priorities identified by participants from northeastern Albania include (by order of 
priorities): (i) road infrastructure (Durres-Kukes-Morine road in particular); (ii) health services; (iii) 
education (all levels from pre-primary levels to secondary education); (iv) urban development;(v) job 
creation; (vi) strengthening the citizens’ voice in the decision making process; (vii) natural resources 
management (fisheries and forestry in particular) and tourism development and (viii) trade – links to 
neighboring countries and country integration. The second regional workshop was organized in Fier on 
April 1, 2005. It was attended by representatives of the local government, civil society, women and youth 
organizations and media representatives of the major cities of southern Albania. The participants stressed 
the importance of more direct support to local government, including fiscal decentralization and direct 
crediting, increased support to urban and rural infrastructure, greater emphasis on job creation and 
strengthening of administrative capacities of local government, re-forestation and flood protection, 
investment in environment protection (in particular in urban areas), greater support to youth, cultural 
heritage protection and tourism development as well as feasible efforts for business development and 
private sector growth.  

7. 
An advisory committee from civil society organizations has advised the Bank’s team 
throughout the preparation processes. This group was composed of representatives of think tanks, youth, 
women, environmental organizations, media associations and regional development agencies (e.g., 
Human Development Promotion Center, Institute of Contemporary Studies, Gender Alliance, Regional 
Environmental Center, Albanian Media Institute, Partners-Albania, Youth Council, Majaft Movements, 
etc.). Thanks to their long standing cooperation with the Bank and their good understanding of the Bank 
mission, policies and operations, group participants provided extended advice and support to the CAS 
preparation and the consultation process. The representatives of the group expressed their readiness to 
disseminate to various civil society networks the information about new CAS and obtain the necessary 
feedback. They appreciated the Bank contribution to the NSSED, governance reforms, and development 
efforts in the country. The group stressed the importance of further involvement of their bodies in the 
future Bank programs at initial stages starting from the preparation, implementation to the monitoring of 
the project results.  

8. 
Two rounds of consultations with private sector representatives were organized in February 
and April 2005. The first meeting on private sector development was organized jointly by the World 
Bank Country Office and IFC (including SEED). The participants in the meeting praised the efforts of the  
World Bank and exchanged views on actual impediments in the current business environment. They 
stressed that limited access to credit and lack of credit information bureau, were among the major 
impediments for growth in the private sector. Other participants emphasized the difficulties with regard to 
land titles, while few others complained about bureaucratic harassment of tax, custom and other 
government authorities. Finally, there were some participants that stressed the impact of increasing state 

 
 
 
 
Albania Country Assistance Strategy: CAS Annexes 
92
_____________________________________________________________________________________________ 

capture and the cost of corruption. The second consultative meeting with the private sector representatives 
took place on April 25, 2005. Participants in this meeting emphasized the importance of export and trade 
promotion for the private sector growth. They underscored the importance of improving the business 
environment to attract FDI and domestic investment. Representatives of the Banking sector again 
suggested that the Bank should support the establishment of a credit bureau. They cited the difficulties 
with regard to the bankruptcy and execution of foreclosures that prevent faster provision of credit to the 
private sector. Other participants raised concerns about unfair competition and high cost of doing business 
stemming from poor infrastructure (transportation, communications and energy). Participants agreed that 
tax administration needs be improved. Other impediments that ought to be removed include land 
registration, lack of quality and standard certification as well as smuggling. 

9. 
An Open House for Youth on March 21, 2005 focused on youth priorities and their 
expectations for the new CAS on the occasion of the Launching of the Youth, Development and Peace 
(YDP) Network. About 29 Youth representatives (from 17 different youth organization; all in the 18-31 
age bracket, two-thirds female, 7 from rural areas, as well as youth from Tirana, Fier, Tepelene, Kukes, 

Peshkopi, Durres) attended the event. They included representatives from the main Youth 
umbrella organizations: the Balkan Youth Link Albania, "Majaft (Enough) Movement", Albanian 

Youth Council (representing 99 youth organizations), Albanian Youth Parliament, Women for Global 
Action, Center for Integration and Development, Youth Women Christian Association, Regional 
Environmental Center, PASS, and YMCA. With regard to the role of the World Bank in Albania in the 
new CAS (FY06-FY09), participants suggested the following: (i) increasing support to all levels of 
education and revisions of curriculum for quality improvements; (ii) improving health services (both in 
term coverage, access and quality); (iii) providing greater support to rural area, to the Northeastern 
regions and to local infrastructure particularly roads; (iv) increasing support to urban poor in the informal 
settlements; (v) cleaning up of environmental "hot spots"; (vi) supporting the implementation of the 
National Youth Strategy and direct support to strengthen youth organizations; (vii) providing greater 
outreach to youth organizations in rural area and youth that are not organized; (viii) direct involvement in 
employment creation and reversing the brain drain; (ix) efforts to protect youth and children from 
trafficking and crime; (x) creating of separate prisons for juveniles; and (xii) paying special attention to 
the integration of migrants from the North East in coastal and urban communities. 

10. 
Two rounds of consultations were organized for donors specifically for the CAS priorities and 
donor coordination. On April 21, 2005, development counselors and representatives of most bilateral and 
multilateral agencies discussed the new World Bank Country Assistance Strategy for Albania. They all 
appreciated the role of the Bank in supporting the process of socioeconomic development in Albania and 
the achievements that have been made since early days of transition. The donors also elaborated on the 
possibilities for improved coordination among donors, country priorities and the focus of the programs of 
each of 
the participating donors. The participants agreed on 
the 
importance of selectivity, 
complementarily and information sharing to avoid duplication of efforts and wasting financial resources. 
They also stressed the importance of supporting the Integrated Planning System (IPS) and the importance 
of encouraging the government to take lead in donor coordination. Donor representatives agreed to 
furnish the Bank team with data and information about their development support in Albania. The second 
meeting was organized on 21 July 2005 and focused specifically on the results framework and the draft 
new result CAS Matrix for FY06-FY09 and the partnerships with regard to the implementation of the 
CAS. Participants expressed their agreement to the proposed results, the pillars of the CAS and 
particularly the heavy emphasis on governance (Governance filter). They also requested the Bank to play 
an active role in donor coordination, the implementation of the IPS and alignment of the NSSED with the 
SAp. A number of donors emphasized the importance of collaboration to resolve land registration and 
titling issues 

 
 
 
 
Albania Country Assistance Strategy: CAS Annexes 
93
_____________________________________________________________________________________________ 

11. 
The Country Office will continue to expand its outreach and communication to strengthen 
partnerships in the implementation of the new CAS. The Public Information Center (PIC) has been 
relocated to the Library of the Faculty of Economics, University of Tirana in 2005, following the signing 
of a partnership agreement with the Faculty. Most of the dissemination activities of the Bank AAA 
activities, and the CAS06, will be launched in the new PIC. A quarterly newsletter is now published and 
disseminated by the Country office and efforts are underway to establish affiliations with the Global 
Distance Learning Network (GDLN). The Bank has also completed an assessment of the legal framework 
for civil society organizations and will continue to support its activities through the small grant program 
as well as direct involvement in project preparation and monitoring. A communication strategy for the 
Country Office has been formulated to expand the Bank outreach activities. 

2. 

PARTNERSHIPS 

12. 
In addition to building strong partnership with Albanian stakeholders, the Bank has built 
effective partnerships with development partners and donor organizations active in Albania, mainly 
through the country office. The European Commission (EC), UNDP and OSCE are the Bank’s key 
multilateral partners in Albania with shared responsibilities in donor coordination (joint responsibility in 
the Donors Technical Secretariat). As the pace of Albanian integration with the European Union 
accelerated, the Bank has started to coordinate most of its activities with the European Commission both 
in Albania and in Brussels and specific meetings for CAS preparations have been undertaken to ensure 
better alignment of the CAS with the SAp (see Annex 9). The relations with the IMF have been very 
effective and strong. The Bank also has worked closely with EBRD and EIB and has co-financed a 
number of projects and programs with them. Coordination with the ISDB, OPEC Fund, and Kuwait Fund 
has been strong. 

13. With the widening of the circle of Albanian friends, the Bank has also build strong 
partnerships with most bilateral donor agencies in Albania. These include, among others: the Italian 
Cooperation, The Netherlands, USAID, GTZ, DFID, SNV, SIDA, Swiss Cooperation, and Austrian 
Cooperation. 

14. 

The Bank intends to provide increased support to the implementation of the integrated 
planning system (IPS) that the Government of Albania adopted in April 2005 (see Box 2). The IPS calls 
for the consolidation of the various policy formulations (NSSED, Sap, MDGs) into an integrated medium 
term plan in 2007 with a comprehensive functional classification of the role of the various government 
agencies and a consolidated scheme for donor coordination and harmonization. Under the IPS, the GoA is 
expected to take leadership role in donor coordination particularly in face of expected decline in 
concessional financing to Albania. Under the new donor architecture the Bank will continue to provide 
support to 9 thematic groups (education; health; social assistance; infrastructure (transport, energy and 
water supply); agriculture and natural resources; private sector development and financial sector; public 
finance; and tourism and coastal development). The new Government adopted, in November 2005, a 
decision to embark on the implementation of the IPS (including formation of two cabinet committees for 
the Strategic Planning and Government Modernization and setting up an IPS Department in the Councils 
of Ministers).

ANNEX 7: ALBANIA’S COUNTRY FINANCING PARAMETERS 

Date: March 23, 2005 

The Country Financing Parameters (CFPs) for Albania set out below have been approved by the Regional 
Vice President, Europe and Central Asia, and are being posted on the Bank’s internal website. 

ITEM 

Cost Sharing: Limit on 
the 
proportion of individual project 
costs that the Bank may finance. 

Parameter 
Up 
to 100 
percent 

Recurrent Cost Financing: Any 
limits that would apply to the 
overall 
amount of 
recurrent 
expenditures that the Bank may 
finance. 

No country-
level limit on 
recurrent cost 
financing. 

Local Cost Financing: Are the 
requirements for Bank financing 
of local expenditures met, namely 
that: (i) financing requirements 
for 
the countries development 
program would exceed the public 
sector’s own 
resources 
and 
expected domestic borrowing; 
and (ii) the financing of foreign 
expenditures alone would not 
enable the Bank to assist in the 
financing of individual projects. 
Taxes and duties: Are there any 
taxes and duties that the Bank 
would not finance? 

Yes 

None. 

Remarks 
Individual projects may be financed up to 100 percent. 
The level of Bank financing will be considered on a 
case by case basis. In the aggregate, it is expected that 
current financing patterns would broadly continue – 
with significant financing by the Government and other 
donors, and Bank financing continuing at the current 
level of about 55 percent of project costs.  
In determining Bank financing of recurrent costs in 
individual projects, the Bank would take into account 
sustainability issues at the sector and project levels. 
Accordingly, where 
individual projects 
include 
significant recurrent costs, a detailed assessment will be 
conducted addressing the sustainability of project 
achievements, the implied future budgetary outlays, and 
the sustainability of proposed Bank-financed recurrent 
costs. 
The two criteria are met. The Bank may finance local 
costs as needed in individual projects.  

The Bank may finance all taxes and duties in Albania. 
At the project-level the Bank would consider whether 
taxes and duties constitute an excessively high share of 
project costs. Should taxes or duties that the Bank 
considers unreasonable be introduced, the CFP will be 
updated.

ANNEX 8: ALBANIA’S DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS 
This Annex updates Albania’s Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA). It concludes that, under a base case 
scenario of sustained growth, fiscal prudence and low interest rates, public and external debt sustainability 
could remain manageable over the medium term. Both solvency and liquidity indicators remain below 
standard threshold however, proving that strong and sustained growth and export expansion along with 
improved track record of implementing structural reforms would allow Albania to access debt on non-
concessional terms without worsening its solvency or liquidity indicators.  

1. 

EVOLUTION OF DOMESTIC AND EXTERNAL DEBT 

Albania’s external and domestic debt indicators have improved considerably over time. Overall 
public debt has been declining from 71 percent in 2000, to 56.6 percent of GDP at end-2004. Recent 
declines have been accelerated by the lek’s appreciation. The public external debt to GDP ratio has 
declined from 29 percent in 2000 to a relatively low level of 18.8 percent in 2004. Domestic debt declined 
recently largely driven by the use of the proceeds of Savings Bank privatization in 2004 to write off part 
of the accumulated domestic debt stock. The latter remains however sizeable at 37.8 percent of GDP at 
end 2004. 

Substantial forgiveness of external debt in arrears has been the main driver of declining public debt 
ratios. Arrears on external debt reached 1 percent of GDP at end 2004 down from a high of 22 percent in 
1997. The reduction in arrears took largely the form of debt forgiveness, with a small part being 
regularized and converted to external debt. Debt rescheduling agreements have been reached with both 
Paris Club creditors (1993, 1998 and 2000) and commercial banks. This was compounded by 
improvement in macroeconomic performance under IMF supported programs which helped maintain a 
declining trend in the public debt/GDP ratio.

Albania’s overall indebtedness indicators compare favorably to those of its regional peers. The 
Government debt to GDP ratio is more relatively in line with that of other countries in the region. It is 
also considerably lower than other IBRD countries. Both solvency and liquidity external debt indicators 
are much superior for example to those of Serbia and Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina, FYROM, 
Bulgaria, and Romania. Total external debt service amounts only to 2.4 percent of total exports of goods 
and services (including remittances), while the ratio of NPV of external debt to GNI and to exports is

much lower than other neighboring countries. In addition to the low debt level, Albania is characterized 
by a relatively high ratio of concessional debt to total external debt of 72 percent. Most of the external 
debt is due to multilateral creditors, the largest being the World Bank, followed by the IMF and EIB.

2. 

MAIN RESULTS OF DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS.  

Under the base case scenario, public debt sustainability continues to improve, albeit at a slow pace. 
Fiscal financing needs are primarily driven by the rolling over of existing short-term domestic debt. 
However, with increased reliance on longer-maturity domestic debt and increasing fiscal consolidation 
over time, the gross financing gap decreases and financing sources become increasingly dominated by 
government revenue. This positive picture is reinforced by the improving public debt ratios over this 
period. In particular, total public debt/GDP ratio declines from 56.6 percent in 2004 to 53.5 percent in 
2009. The decline in the debt trajectory is moderate since Albania continues to run fiscal deficits, though 
at lower levels, and needs to finance its capital investments with higher cost new borrowing.  

External debt sustainability is maintained at relatively stable levels over the CAS period, only 
worsening slightly in outer years, and both solvency and liquidity indicators remain well below 
standard sustainability thresholds. The ratio of total external debt to GDP is projected to remain stable 
between 18 to 19% by 2009, but remains significantly below standard solvency thresholds,25 suggesting 
that the base case macroeconomic framework satisfies the long-run sustainability condition. Liquidity 
pressure remains at low levels due to a small external debt stock and prolonged grace periods currently 
applied. The ratio of TDS to exports is projected to stabilize at around 2.5 percent in 2009.  

Given that IBRD’s current and projected exposure to Albania is very limited, and that Albania has 
established a strong record of servicing Bank debt, exposure indicators are projected to improve 
over the CAS period. IBRD exposure is low measured on a per capita basis or as a share of GDP or 

25 The World Bank uses two ratios to classify countries annually based on their external indebtedness: the NPV of external debt-
to-GDP and the NPV of external debt service to exports of goods and services. If either ratio exceeds its critical value (80 percent 
and 220 percent respectively), the country is classified as heavily indebted. Moderately indebted means either of the two key 
ratios exceeds 60 percent, but does not reach the critical levels. All other classified low- and middle-income economies are listed 
as less indebted. See also Part III of the IMF (2003)” “External Debt Statistics: Guide for Compilers and Users”, International 
Monetary Fund, Washington DC.

exports, and IBRD debt accounts for a negligible share of Albania’s total debt outstanding. Debt service 
ratios are also favorable. IBRD debt service to exports of goods and services is projected to increase 
moderately over the CAS period but remains low at less than 0.1 percent. Bank debt service as a share of 
total public debt service is projected to increase from 10.6% in 2004 to 16% in 2009. The share of IBRD 
debt in Albania’s total debt outstanding is projected to reach 2.3 percent in 2009 and 5 percent of total 
World Bank portfolio.  

These projections rely on continued strong macroeconomic management and policy performance, 
conservative assumptions regarding privatization proceeds, and a medium-term balance of payments 
outlook based on moderately favorable assumptions regarding trade growth and capital inflows. Albania’s 
fiscal and external sustainability in the medium term under the base-case lending scenario depends on: (i) 
furthering ongoing fiscal consolidation efforts, improving the quality of fiscal adjustment and raising 
revenue collections; (ii) substantially improving the strategic management of debt; (iii) strong policy 
reform supporting improved export performance, especially through removing administrative barriers to 
investment and improving public sector governance, and (iv) a relatively favorable external environment 
that would help boost export growth. 

Sensitivity Analysis:  

Public debt sustainability indicators were found to be most vulnerable to a loose fiscal stance. A 
higher fiscal deficit due to lower tax revenues (unmatched by expenditure cuts) leads to close to doubling 
the overall fiscal deficit compared to the base case scenario (5 percent compared to 3 percent of GDP). 
Since public borrowing increases, solvency indicators for public debt deteriorate markedly over time. 
These results emphasize the need for continued fiscal consolidation that, combined with a reduced 
reliance on domestic financing, will help ease the pressure on the domestic credit market and facilitate a 
reduction in domestic rates.  

The effect of higher interest rates on overall indebtedness levels is less strong. Everything else 
staying the same, a one percentage point increase in the domestic interest rate compared to the base case 
scenario widens the overall deficit only slightly and raises public sector borrowing requirements. With a 
smaller share of the deficit being financed by domestic borrowing, the impact of the shock would taper 
off gradually. Without deteriorating, solvency and liquidity indicators do not improve as fast as in the 
base case. Other risks that have not been simulated, but that constitute sources of vulnerability on the 
domestic debt side are the short maturity structure of public debt, the high concentration of debt 
ownership (in the banking system), the low quality of the fiscal adjustment, and lack of market 
arrangements for public debt management. These give rise to liquidity and rollover risk that need to be 
mitigated.  

External debt sustainability indicators are most sensitive to an adverse shock to exports. Due to the 
high historical variability in export growth, a temporary reduction by half in annual base case export 
growth during 2007-2008 would sharply deteriorate external sustainability leading to a one-off increase in 
the external debt/GDP ratio that approaches critical thresholds. External sustainability would decline from 
both a solvency and liquidity perspective. Debt service ratios would deteriorate markedly, with an 
increasing share of the lower export earnings going to service the debt. This shock confirms the 
imperative to significantly raise exports, including through diversifying its export base, in view of 
boosting growth, and reducing reliance on migrants’ transfers.  

Other potentially important determinants of debt sustainability were also examined, but were 
found to be less significant on the external debt side. Variables such as the level of foreign interest 
rates and the proportion of future non-concessional financing were also analyzed. Given the relatively low

share of external debt, these shocks were found to be relatively less important sources of vulnerability 
within a 10-year horizon.

b. “XGS" denotes exports of goods and services, including workers' remittances.  

For Albania to minimize its exposure to external shocks and ensure sustainability of its public and 
external debt, it will need to improve the quality of its fiscal adjustment by further strengthening its 
revenue generation capacity and improving the efficiency of its capital spending; improving the business 
environment, and removing obstacles to exports stemming from poor infrastructure and institutional 
quality. This will need to be accompanied by a financing and debt management strategy that would alter 
the size, terms and composition of its domestic debt, improve the functioning of government securities 
markets and actively take measures to gradually access market based lending on favorable terms.

ANNEX 9: ALBANIA’S RELATIONS WITH THE EU AND PROGRESS ON THE SAP  

Relations between Albania and the European Union (EU) have been developing in the context of the 
Stabilization and Association process (SAp). As such, the SAp is a framework in which a new contractual 
relationship (Stabilization and Association Agreements) and an assistance program (CARDS)26 help each 
country in the Western Balkans to progress, at its own pace towards EU membership.27  

The idea of a SAp as a new and genuine tool of anchoring the countries from the Western Balkans 
towards the EU was born at the Zagreb Summit in November 2000, after the Feira Council of June 2000 
that addressed the future of the Balkans countries is in Europe.28 In Zagreb, the Western Balkan countries 
made a pledge to abide by the EU rules and conditionality, receiving in return the prospect for EU 
accession based on the Treaty of the European Union (TEU) and the Copenhagen criteria as well as on 
assistance program to promote and support this ambition.29 They also agreed that when signed, the 
Stabilization and Association Agreements (SAAs) would be the principal means to begin preparing 
themselves for the demands that the prospect of accession to the EU entails.30 In addition, the countries 
agreed (once they meet the necessary rules and conditions) to receive financial assistance (CARDS), 
which would focus on supporting necessary reforms and institution building, and thus facilitate their 
approximation with the EU. 

Since 1991, successive Albanian governments have placed the prospect of European integration at the top 
of their agendas. In fact, integration in the EU has been the only overarching national interest in Albania 
because of lack of broader national consensus on other development challenges, due to political rivalry. 
Although Albania signed a Co-operation and Trade Agreement with the EU in 1992, the civil unrest in 
1997 (the so-called “pyramid schemes crisis”), delayed further development of relations between the EU 
and Albania. In 1999, the European Commission (EC) presented a Feasibility Report, which concluded 
that, despite progress made since the 1997 crisis, Albania was not yet in a position to take on the far 
reaching contractual obligations with the EU.31 

In November 2000, the EU decided at the Zagreb summit to set up an EU/Albania High Level Steering 
Group (HLSG), with the objective of stepping up cooperation between the EU and Albania, and 
identifying and supporting reforms to be carried out by Albania in preparation for negotiation of a SAA. 
The EU/Albania HLSG was asked to assess progress, to recommend necessary reform measures and to 
provide advice and guidance in the areas of concern outlined in the 1999 Feasibility Report, and to report 

26 Community Assistance for Reconstruction, Development and Stabilization. 
27 European Community CARDS Programme - Albania Country Strategy Paper, 30 November 2001. 
28 The European Council in Feira confirmed that its objective remained fullest possible integration of the countries in the region 
into the political and economic mainstream of Europe through the SAp, political dialogue, liberalization of trade and cooperation 
in Justice and Home Affairs. http://www.euoparl.eu.int/summits/fei1_en.htm. 
29 The European Council in Copenhagen 1993 spelled out the Copenhagen criteria, by which candidate countries would be 
judged for accession on: (i) stability of institutions guaranteeing democracy, the rule of law, human rights and respect for and 
protection of minorities; (ii) existence of a functioning market economy, as well as capacity to cope with competitive pressure 
and market forces within the EU; and (iii) ability to take on obligations of membership, including adherence to the aims of 
political, economic and monetary union – i.e. the acquis communautaire.  
30 Engineered similarly to the Europe Agreements that were signed between the EU and the 10 countries of Central and Eastern 
Europe at the beginning of 1990, the SAAs focus on respect for democratic principles and integration of the countries of the 
region into the EU single market. They foresee the establishment of a free trade area with the EU and set out rights and 
obligations in areas such as competition and state aid rules, intellectual property and establishment, which will allow the 
economies of the region to begin to integrate with the EU. The conclusion of such Agreements represents the signatories’ 
commitment to complete over a transition period a formal association with the EU, tailored to the circumstances of each country 
but based on the implementation of the same core obligations.

to the European Council by mid-2001. Based upon the report prepared by the HSLG, the EC concluded 
that, taking into account political, economic, regional and SAA-related technical factors, it is appropriate 
to proceed with negotiations for a SAA with Albania.32 The Gothenburg European Council of June 2001 
welcomed the EC’s report and invited the EC to present draft negotiating directives to the Council for the 
negotiation of an SAA with Albania. The directives were finally adopted 2002. On January 31, 2003 the 
President of the European Commission, Romano Prodi, officially launched the negotiations for a SAA.  

Negotiations on a draft SAA began in early 2003. Since then three official rounds (including member 
states representatives) and five technical rounds of negotiations have been held with the Albanian 
authorities. Agreement in principle has now been reached on most elements of the text of the draft 
agreement.33 However, actual implementation of reforms has been insufficient to properly address many 
of the shortcomings identified in the 2001 High Level Steering Group report, subsequent SAp reports, and 
in the framework of the regular dialogue between the EC and Albania.34 In fact, the SAp reports reveal 
that most of the recommendations from 2002 were not implemented and thus carried over to 2003, while 
only a limited number of policy recommendations in the 2003 SAp report and the various Consultative 
Task Force meetings have been fully implemented.35 According to the 2004 SAp report, Albania does not 
yet offer a sufficient guarantee that it will be capable of correctly implementing the future SAA36 

The 2005 SAp Progress Report, however, highlighted that progress been made in Albania on economic 
and political developments and in meeting European standards. It recognized that Albania has made 
progress in reinforcing its democratic, judicial and public administration institutions but needs to 
implement strategies and laws with more vigor to improve their functioning. It assessed Parliamentary 
elections as been conducted in line with the Electoral Code and that they adhered to fundamental 
democratic principles, leading to smooth transfer of power. The 2005 Progress Report also recognized 
that Albania made progress in improving the oversight, recruitment and training of the civil service and 
taken steps to enhance its legal framework and to make public administration more robust. Proper 
implementation of the existing legislative framework and the overall effective functioning of the judicial 
system remain a matter of concern to the EC despite some efforts made to fight corruption.37 

The 2005 SAp Progress Report also concluded that Albania operates to some degree within the 
framework of functioning market principles. Further vigorous reform efforts are, however, necessary to 
address the shortcoming in competitiveness of the economy (weak infrastructure, poor legislation, weak 
implementation of tax legislation, unfair competition by business operating in the grey economy, etc.). 
The report also recognized that Albania has made progress towards meeting European standards. Progress 
has been mainly through adoption of new legislation and establishment of new institutions. But in a 
number of cases, more commitment and resources are needed for further progress and implementation. 

In order for Albania to make meaningful progress in the SAp, the progress reports assess that major 
reforms are necessary in the following areas: (i) fighting organized crime, trafficking and corruption; (ii) 
strengthening the judicial system and public administration; (iii) ensuring the proper functioning of 
democracy (including elections) and preserving the political stability necessary for speedy reform 
implementation; (iv) improvement in terms of human and minority rights; (v) further formalization and 
reform of the economy, as well as increased fiscal sustainability through more efficient customs and tax 
administrations and a strengthened legal framework.

The SAp was further deepened with the Thessaloniki Council of June 2003, which reiterated the EU’s 
determination to fully and effectively support the European prospects of the Western Balkan countries. 
The Council also introduced a new tool aimed at approximating the countries in the region with the EU – 
the European Partnership. The Council decision approving a European Partnership for Albania was 
published in June 2004. The Albanian Government adopted its Action Plan for the Implementation of 
European Partnership Priorities in September 2004 and provided the Commission with updates on its 
progress in implementing the Action Plan in December 2004 and March 2005.  

The European Partnership for Albania is based on the provisions of Council Regulation (EC) No. 
533/2004. It is modeled on the Accession Partnerships developed to prepare past aspirants to EU 
membership. It defines short and medium term priorities for Albania’s preparations for further integration 
with the EU identified in the EC’s 2004 Annual Report, and serves as a checklist against which to 
measure progress. The priorities specified in the European Partnership are adapted to Albania’s specific 
needs and stage of preparation and will be updated as necessary. The European Partnership also provides 
guidance for financial assistance to Albania through the CARDS program.38  

The 2005 SAp Progress Report also made an assessment about progress in implementation of the 
European Partnership. It concluded that “overall, Albania had made some progress in implementing the 
European Partnership’s short-term priorities, but has not yet began to address concertedly those set out for 
the medium term”.39 While new laws have been enacted and new institutions been created, slow 
implementation, and in few cases lack of political will, have been the main factors behind the slow pace 
of progress. The main remaining challenges facing Albania include: 

• 

• 

In the political field, priority should be given to better parliamentary rules and creation of a more 
constructive political climate. Judicial transparency should be fostered and the civil service law 
should be fully implemented. Albania should ensure that its strategy to fight corruption is realistic 
and precise. Further efforts are required also to complete the legal and administrative framework 
for the protection of minorities.  

In the area of economic management, priority should be given to certainty of property 
ownership. Albania also need to secure that it will be able to fulfill its future SAA obligation with 
regard to non-discriminatory application of business law for EU companies, improve commercial 
legislation and provide more resource to its SME agency and make progress in the business 
environment.   

• Finally, in the area of European Standards, measure to increase awareness of the importance 
European standards among economic actors needs to be adopted. Fighting corruption, smuggling 
and trafficking by the custom service should receive a higher priority. Public procurement need to 
be improved both legislatively and in terms of building administrative capacity. Albania also 
needs to raise awareness of intellectual property rights among economic operators and law 
enforcement agencies.   

The EU is currently rationalizing the pre-accession aid. In September 2004, the European Commission 
proposed a Regulation that creates a single framework for assistance: the Instrument for Pre-Accession 
(IPA). Under the draft IPA Regulation, assistance for potential candidate countries such as Albania will 
remain very much the same as currently under CARDS, i.e., similar sectors and same kind of operations: 
(i) institution building and democratization; (ii) economic and social development; (iii) regional and 
cross-border cooperation; and (iv) partial alignment with the acquis communautaire, in particular where

this is in the mutual interest of the EU and the beneficiary country. Project management responsibilities 
under IPA may be decentralized to the local administration, but this is likely to be done gradually. 

Over the period 1991-2004, the EC assistance to Albania had totalled about € 1.2 billion, of which € 635 
million was delivered through the Phare program. Since 2001, CARDS has been the main EC financial 
instrument for Albania. The support provided through CARDS in 2005 (€ 44.2) is mainly focused on 
European partnership priorities.
