I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

i. A small, poo r , and landlocked economy, h igh ly dependent on Sou th Africa, 
Lesotho faces the challenge of achieving strong, sustainable and job -c rea t ing g row th 
tha t benefits the poo r wh i le f i g h t i n g the H I W A I D S pandemic, the mos t urgent and 
po ten t ia l ly devastating adversity con f ron t ing the country. Lesotho’s v i s i o n o f i t s future 
and h o w t o address these challenges i s se t ou t in the Pove r ty Reduc t ion Strategy (PRS), 
w h i c h was endorsed by the B a n k and IMF Execu t ive Boards in September 2005. With 
the ove ra rch ing a im to imp rove the we l fa re o f the current generation w i t h o u t 
comp rom is ing opportunities f o r future generations, the PRS delineates a comprehensive 
agenda w h i c h places private-sector-led economic g r ow t h and emp loymen t creation at i t s 
core, a long with the be t te rmen t o f human conditions, no tab ly as they relate t o HIV/AIDS. 

. . 

11. 

Prepared i n pa ra l le l w i th the PRS and th rough a process of extensive and 
broad-based consultations w i t h development partners, th is Country Assistance Strategy 
(CAS) proposes tha t the Wo r ld Bank G roup ma in ta in a strong bu t ino re focused and 
results-orierztedpartnership w i t h the Government of Lesotho d u r i n g FYO6-09. The 
overarching ob jec t ive o f this strategy i s t o make full u s e o f the B a n k G roup ’s 
comparative advantage in Lesotho, Le., comb in ing ana ly t ica l strength and conven ing 
powe r w i t h f inanc ing capacity and leverage in support o f the PRS t o achieve stronger, 
sustainable and job -c rea t ing growth, t o ensu re that the poo r bene f i t , and t o j o i n forces 
with other stakeholders and development partners in the fight against HIV/AIDS. 

iii. To achieve enlzaizced impact, the CASproposes a results framework tha t sets 
ou t desired outcomes and defines key intermediate indicators. This i s a m a j o r change 
f r om the past. While a l l ac t iv i t ies w i l l be assessed and selected acco rd ing to their 
po ten t ia l fo r ach iev ing the outcomes, the results f ramewo rk p rov ides f l e x i b i l i t y t o 
respond to changing circumstances and demands f o r ana ly t ica l and f inanc ia l services. 
Th rough better mon i to r ing , t h i s r e s u l t s f ramewo rk w i l l a l l ow e a r l i e r iden t i f ica t ion o f 
issues , be t te r - in fo rmed decisions, and p ro -ac t ive p rob lem so lv ing . 

iv. 
Predicated oil continued macroeconomic stability and the p romo t ion of good 
governance, th is CAS proposes tha t four key strategic objectives f rame the B a n k 
Group’s assistance over the com ing years: 

0 Fighting HIV/AIDS. H I V I A I D S components w i l l be inc luded in a l l future B a n k 
programs in Lesotho, i n c l u d i n g in transport, p r iva te sector development, education, 
and pub l ic service de l ive ry . Techn ica l assistance w i l l also b e p rov ided t o s t reng then 
the capacity o f the N a t i o n a l AIDS Comm iss ion t o access available grant funding, 
update strategies, and coordinate, m o n i t o r and evaluate programs. 

0 Employment and Income Generation through Higher Economic Growth. B a n k 

support w i l l b e directed towards t h r e e key areas: (i) creation o f an enab l ing 
environment f o r p r iva te sector development, exports, and investment; (ii) enhancing 

g r ow t h po ten t ia l o f the r u r a l economy and im p r o v i n g access t o infrastructure and 
basic services; and (iii) sustainable use o f na tu ra l resources and the environment. 

0 

Im p r o v i n g H u m a n Deve lopment Outcomes. B a n k assistance w i l l b e directed 

towards im p r o v i n g hea l th status and learning outcomes. Focus w i l l be o n im p r o v i n g 
hea l th systems, the education sector, transport, wa te r supply, and skill development in 
the p r i v a t e sector. In health, the focus w i l l be o n inc reas ing the e f f ic iency o f p u b l i c 
expenditures, exp lo r ing ways to imp rove equity, and designing mechanisms f o r mo re 
e f fec t ive de l ive ry o f hea l th care. In education, quality, efficiency, service delivery, 
and management capacity w i l l be at the center o f Bank support. 

0 Decen t ra l iza t ion , Public Service De l ive ry , a n d M o n i t o r i n g a n d Eva lua t ion . The 

Bank w i l l support the Government’s decentralization e f fo r t by con t r ibu t ing t o 
in te rgove rnmen ta l f isca l architecture, im p r o v i n g capac i ty and incentives f o r l o c a l 
governments t o de l ive r services, and empowe r ing commun i t ies and users. In 
co l labo ra t ion with other partners, the Bank w i l l assist the Government in putting in 
place adequate mechanisms fo r m o n i t o r i n g the PRS and i n i t i a t i n g impac t evaluations. 

v. 
I n terms of instruments, the Bank w i l l continue to invest in high quality 
analytic work to underpin a strategic I D A lendingprogram. IDA lending, with a to ta l 
ind ica t ive a l loca t ion o f US $ 4 7 m i l l i o n under ID A 1 4 , w i l l inc reas ing ly focus o n 
p rog ramma t ic and sector-wide approaches, i n c l u d i n g Pove r ty Reduc t ion Support Credits 
(PRSCs), w h i c h w i l l b e preceded by s ign i f ican t analytic p repa ra t ion and support. This 
w i l l a l l ow a better a l ignmen t with government systems, but requ i re greater attention t o 
ins t i tu t iona l dimensions, as w e l l as a strengthening o f Lesotho’s f iduc ia ry systems. 

vi. 

Theproposedprogram draws on the lessons of the last CAS and is designed to 
mitigate risks that could hinder the effectiveness of B an k support. Imp lemen ta t ion o f 
the last C A S was h inde red by p o l i t i c a l ins tab i l i ty at the beg inn ing o f C A S period, 
compounded by capacity constraints, and the l a c k o f a core set o f measurable outcomes. 
The prospects for the current C A S a re s ign i f ican t ly im p r o v e d due t o (a) p o l i t i c a l stability; 
(b) a high l e v e l o f owne rsh ip o f and comm i tmen t t o t h e PRS and CAS; and (c) 
ma ins t ream ing capacity building ac t iv i t ies in a l l B a n k p ro jec ts t o strengthen the capacity 
o f government o f f ic ia ls . T o m i t iga te the economic and capacity r i s k s fac ing Lesotho and 
the Bank program, the Bank w i l l support, in partnership with others, p r iva te sector 
development, p u b l i c sector reforms, and the sca l ing up o f H I V / A I D S p reven t ion and 
treatment. F ina l ly , closer Bank engagement o n the g round and strengthened c l ien t 
comm i tmen t t o the development agenda w i l l support imp lemen ta t ion o f the program. 

v i i . 

The following issues are suggested for Boa rd discussion: 

0 Does the C A S adequately address t h e g r ow t h and human development challenges 
w h i c h w i l l enable Leso tho t o m o v e towa rds ach iev ing the MDGs? 
Does the B o a r d agree that the approach taken in t h e C A S with respect t o the 
HIV/AIDS pandemic i s appropriate?

A. POL IT ICAL ECONOMY AND SOCIAL CONTEXT 

1. 

Leso tho was established as a B r i t i s h protectorate in 1868 and became an 
independent cons t i tu t iona l mona rchy in 1966 after h o l d i n g i t s f i rs t democratic elections 
in 1965. Howeve r , Lesotho’s democratic process has been ma rked by c o n f l i c t between 
p o l i t i c a l parties and powe r struggles between c i v i l i a n and military regimes. Since 
independence, there have been fou r military coups and 23 years o f authoritarian r u l e , 
i n c l u d i n g seven years o f military government. Fragmentation o f p o l i t i c a l parties 
characterizes the p o l i t i c a l landscape, with 19 p o l i t i c a l pa r t ies cu r ren t ly contesting fo r 
p o l i t i c a l o f f ice . 

2. 

The 1990s saw p o l i t i c a l upheavals escalate. After the 1993 election, a n ew 
cons t i tu t ion was introduced, but the lops ided v i c t o r y o f the Basotho Congress Party 
(BCP) l e d t o tensions between the n e w l y elected government and the m i l i t a r y . In the 
M a y 1998 parliamentary elections, the Leso tho Congress f o r Democ racy (LCD ) w o n a l l 
but one o f the seats contested, as a resu l t o f the ‘ f i rs t past the post’ electoral system. 
Soon after, the r e s u l t s we re challenged and considerable c i v i l unrest ensued, resu l t ing in 
widespread destruction o f p rope r ty . Troops f r o m the Southern A f r i c a n Deve lopmen t 
C omm u n i t y (SADC ) intervened, con t r ibu t ing t o the unrest, but even tua l ly c a lm was 
restored. The government and oppos i t ion parties agreed o n a n ew e lec t ion in April 2000, 
but delays in r e f o rm i n g the electoral system and reg is te r ing voters led t o a further 
rescheduling t o M a y 2002. The L C D was re-elected with a clear ma jo r i ty . A l t h o u g h the 
elections we re peaceful, Lesotho’s past p o l i t i c a l f r a g i l i t y remains a concern t o investors 
and also influences the manner in w h i c h the government tackles k e y development 
challenges. The current electoral framework, based o n a b lend o f the “ f i r s t past the post” 
electoral system and p ropo r t iona l representation o f a l l pa r t ies , seems t o o f fe r the best 
comp rom ise f o r ma in ta in ing p o l i t i c a l s tab i l i ty . 

3. 
In accordance with Lesotho’s Constitution, the Government passed a L o c a l 
Government A c t in 1997. The A c t confers o n commun i t ies respons ib i l i ty f o r the i r own 
a f fa i rs and development. E lec t ions f o r the n e w l y created l o c a l assemblies we re 
conducted o n April 30,2005, w h i c h was the f i rs t ever multi-party l o c a l government 
election. The l aw reserved 3 0 percent o f constituencies f o r women, but in fac t 58 percent 
o f the elected councilors ended up b e i n g women . The h o l d i n g o f the l o c a l e lec t ion 
presents a p r om i s i n g scenario f o r inc reas ing soc ia l inc lus ion and enhancing service 
delivery.

With a popu la t ion o f 2.2 m i l l i o n ’ and gross na t iona l income o f US $ 7 4 0 per 
capita, Leso tho i s a small, poor, land locked economy, comp le te ly surrounded by the 
Repub l ic o f Sou th A f r ica (RSA). Two - th i rds o f i t s land area i s comp r ised o f moun ta ins 
and sma l l valleys, with less than 10 percent suitable f o r c rop cu l t iva t ion , and o n l y a

Because o f i t s l im i t e d na tu ra l endowments - c h i e f l y clay, sandstone, and water, with t h e

sk i l led labor, increased efficiency, and a better investment climate. 

5, 
The economy i s la rge ly based o n l im i t e d ag r icu l tu ra l and pastoral p roduc t ion and 
o n light manufacturing. A b o u t 70 percent o f Lesotho’s popu la t ion l i v e s in the r u r a l 
regions and mountainous areas where income i s generated f r om traditional, la rge ly 
subsistence, low-value-added agriculture and herding. The average househo ld p l o t 
h o l d i n g i s about h a l f a hectare, o n l y two - th i rds o f households have access t o land, and 70 
percent o f the p lo ts are sharecropped in fo rma l ly . Domes t ica l ly generated income i s 
supplemented by re la t ive ly large, though over the past decade declining, remittances 
f r o m Basotho mine wo rke rs in South A f r ica ; roya l t ies f r o m the supp ly o f wa te r t o South 
A f r i c a f r o m the Lesotho H igh lands Water Project (LHWP); o f f i c i a l development

latter exports m o s t l y t o the U .S . market, but i s exposed t o the r isks o f e rod ing trade 
preferences. 

6. 
Leso tho has a r e l a t i v e l y open trade reg ime because o f i t s membe rsh ip in the 
Southern A f r i c a Customs U n i o n (SACU), w h i c h generates s ign i f ican t revenue f o r the 
government budget. I t also has easy access t o Sou th A f r ica ’s superior infrastructure. 
Lesotho trades m o s t l y with Sou th A f r ica , w h i c h accounts f o r 90 percent o f i t s impo r ts 
and 65 percent o f i t s exports. A s a member o f the C omm o n Mone ta ry A r e a (CMA ) ,

7. 

Measured by the H um a n Development Index,2 Lesotho i s ranked 149 out of 1 7 7 
countries - low on a global scale, but relatively favorable compared to other sub- 
Saharan African countries. Lesotho has achieved a re la t ive ly high adu l t l i te racy rate o f 
84 percent. Howeve r , there a re s ign i f ican t differences be tween r u r a l and urban areas. 
W h i l e the gross p r im a r y en ro l lmen t rate i s about 125 percent, the ne t en ro l lmen t rate i s

Poverty i s widespread in Lesotho, and ava i lab le evidence, although inadequate, 
suggests tha t poverty and inequality may have increased over the past two decades. 
Based o n the 1994/95 Househo ld Budget Survey, almost two - th i rds o f the country’s 
popu la t ion l i v e b e l ow the na t iona l pove r ty l i n e and mo re than one - th i rd are classified as

C . 

R e c e n t E c o n om i c D e v e l o pm e n t s 

12. 
Lesotho’s economy has undergone a fundamental transformation and 
structural change over the past 1 5 years. GDP g r ow t h accelerated s ign i f ican t ly since 
2000/01 despite dec l in ing wo rke r remittances. T h e g r ow t h ra te achieved during 2001/02 
- 2003/04 was 3.4 percent, compared t o -0.4 percent in the p rev ious three years. This i s 
exp la ined by three impo r tan t changes in the external environment. F i rs t , the garment and 
c lo th ing indus t ry has evo lved f r om a nascent artisan indus t ry in the la te 1980s t o a m a j o r 
source o f expo r t earnings. Starting in the la te 1980s and ga in ing momen tum with the 
duty and quota-free access t o the U .S . ma rke t p rov ided under the 2000 A f r i c a n G r ow t h 
and Oppo r tun i ty A c t (AGOA), the indus t ry attracted s ign i f ican t levels o f FDI, primarily 
f r o m East Asia. With garment exports jumping f r o m about US$100 m i l l i o n in 1998 t o 
about U S 4 5 0 m i l l i o n in 2004, corresponding t o an average annual g r ow t h rate o f m o r e 
than 50 percent, the sector has been the m a i n source o f g r ow t h ove r the past five years. 

13. 
Second, Lesotho experienced an exceptional increase in FDI, m a i n l y f r o m South 
A f r ica , f o r the Lesotho H igh lands Wa te r P ro jec t (LHWP). Conceived as an enclave 
project, with re la t ive ly l i m i t e d sp i l love rs i n t o the l o c a l labor and goods markets, the 
cons t ruc t ion phase o f th is highly capital-intensive p ro jec t was associated w i th large 
cap i ta l in f lows , peaking at almost 2 0 percent o f Lesotho’s gross na t iona l investments in 
the ea r ly 1990s. 

14. 
F ina l ly , until the late-1980s’ close t o 50 percent o f Lesotho’s na t iona l income was 
generated th rough remittances f rom Basotho wo rke rs emp loyed in Sou th A f r i c a n mines, 
w h i c h emp loyed almost h a l f o f the ma le labo r force. In contrast, in 2003/04, about 80 
percent o f Lesotho’s GNP was p roduced domestically, w h i l e remittances f r o m miners 
(and other migrants) h a d fa l len t o about 2 0 percent o f GNP. W h i l e the share o f 
agriculture in GDP has been shrinking and that o f services has stagnated, the g r ow i n g 
share o f manufacturing and cons t ruc t ion has transformed Lesotho i n t o a m o r e m o d em 
and m o r e export-oriented economy. P r iva te investment in manu fac tu r ing and 
cons t ruc t ion increased t o 2 0 percent o f GNP in the f i r s t h a l f o f this decade ( f r om v i r t u a l l y 
nil in the la te 1980s), and the share o f exports has g r ow n steadily t o n o w a lmos t 40 
percent o f GNP. 

15. 
Th e Government’s stabilization policies during 1998-2002 in response to 
external shocks were largely successful. With mone ta ry and exchange ra te po l ic ies 
c lose ly t i e d t o that o f R S A and bo ls te red by re la t ive ly p ruden t f isca l policies, i n f l a t i o n 

4 

was kept under con t ro l at s ing le -d ig i t levels. Largely d r iven by FDI and t h e strong export 
performance o f the garment and c lo th ing sector, rea l GDP g r ow t h averaged about 3% 
percent p e r annum during the p e r i o d 1991-2003, compared t o the average SSA g row th 
rate o f 2% percent during the same period. The ove ra l l f isca l balance ( inc lud ing g ran ts ) 
has tu rned f r o m a de f ic i t t o an increasing su rp lus in the last t w o f isca l years. 

16. 
The current account d e f i c i t has na r rowed s ign i f ican t ly , f r o m 11 percent o f GDP in 
2003-04 t o less than 3 percent in 2004-05, m a i n l y ow i n g t o considerable export g r ow t h 
and a sharp r ise in S A C U customs receipts. Expo r ts were boosted by strong g r ow t h in 
the garment sector, as a foreign-funded den im m i l l started operations and a d iamond m i n e 
was re-opened in 2004. Desp i te ongo ing layo f fs in mining, remittances f r o m South 
A f r i c a also grew thanks to wage increases. These pos i t ive effects m o r e than offset the 
adverse impac t o f a wo rsen ing o f the t e rm s o f trade, w h i c h since 2001 has been 
re in fo rced by the rea l appreciation o f the Rand vis-a-vis the U S do l la r . 

17. M o r e recently, as a resu l t o f the erosion in the competitiveness o f manufacturing, 
the garment sector in particular, and the adverse impac t o n ag r icu l tu re o f the drought, rea l 
GDP g r ow t h s lowed t o about 2 percent in 2004 and i s expected t o weaken even further in 
2005. W h i l e keep ing i n f l a t i o n in check, the L o t i ’ s p e g t o the Rand has resu l ted in a 30- 
percent appreciation o f the rea l e f fec t ive exchange rate over the past 3 years. Mo reove r , 
the phas ing ou t o f t h e quotas under the U ruguay Round’s Agreement o n Tex t i les and 
C lo th ing (ATC ) f r o m the start o f 2005 has begun t o erode Lesotho’s trade preferences in 
textiles and garments, and there i s increased compe t i t ion f r o m lower-cost producers such 
as Ch ina and Ind ia . Six factories we re thus closed in the f i r s t quarter o f 2005, and about 
10,000 jobs were los t o n that account alone. The f a l l in exports t o the U n i t e d States in 
2005 i s estimated at about 10 percent. 

D. Medium-term Outlook and Debt Sustainability 

18. 
I n the medium term, Lesotho is vulnerable to the H I V /A ID S p a n d em i c and to 
regional and global developments that can adversely affect 
its growth prospects. In the 
short and medium term, key adverse developments include: (i) the e ros ion o f trade 
preferences th rough the phas ing ou t o f tex t i le quotas under the A T C ; (ii) the expected 
remova l o f the AGOA p r o v i s i o n a l l ow i n g the use o f th i rd -coun t ry fabrics in 2007; (iii) 
the anticipated dec l ine in S A C U tariff revenues due t o trade l ibe ra l iza t ion ; and (iv) the 
l i k e l i h o o d o f a reduc t ion in remittances as Basotho wo rke rs con t inue t o b e retrenched 
f r om Sou th A f r i c a n m ines and as they are affected by recent changes in Sou th A f r ica ’s 
imm i g r a t i o n leg is la t ion . These changes favo r sk i l led workers, making i t d i f f i c u l t fo r a 
new generation o f m ine rs t o enter the Sou th A f r i c a n labo r market. Ove r the m e d i um 
term , the mos t wo r r isome and po ten t ia l ly mos t devastating development i s the impac t o f 
H I V / A I D S , which, i f n o t adequately addressed, c o u l d have serious impacts. P re l im ina ry 
cost estimates t o t h e economy and the p u b l i c sector o f the HIV/AIDS pandem ic a r e v e r y 
high. S lowe r labo r force g r ow t h and a l ow e r savings rate, w h i c h reduces cap i ta l 
formation, c o u l d l ow e r ou tpu t g r ow t h by an average o f 0.4 percent per year between 2005 
and 2014. The impac t o f HIV/AIDS on the f isca l p o s i t i o n o f the government i s also 

5 

expected t o be considerable - an add i t iona l deterioration o f the ove ra l l f isca l balance o f 5 
percent o f GDP by 2010.7 

19. 
Du r ing the period covered by this CAS (FYO6-09) real GDP growth i s expected 
to recover from the 2005/061ow but remain weak a t about 2percent. The dampening 
effect o f e rod ing competitiveness and phase-out o f quotas under the A T C i s expected t o 
b e o n l y p a r t i a l l y offset by strengthened g r ow t h in non-garment manu fac tu r ing and 
d iamond mining. This scenario also assumes an imp rovemen t in p u b l i c investment and 
imp lemen ta t ion capacity beg inn ing in 2005/06, while p r iva te investments are expected t o 
rema in at about 2 4 percent o f GDP throughout the period. The large f isca l surplus o f 9.1 
percent o f GDP in 2004/05 ( inc lud ing grants), w h i c h re f lec ted m a i n l y temporary factors, 
pa r t icu la r ly t h e r ise in receipts f r om SACU , i s p ro jec ted t o stay hea l thy in 2005/06 and 
2006/07, aga in m a i n l y o n account o f higher than expected S A C U receipts and lowe r 
expenditure than budgeted, pa r t icu la r ly o n inves tmen t projects. W h i l e the n ew S A C U 
windfall w i l l b e p a r t i a l l y saved and the Government plans t o make ea r ly repayment o f 
some non-concessional external debt, the f isca l p o s i t i o n i s expected t o sw i t c h t o a de f ic i t 
in subsequent years. The f isca l weakening re f lec ts b o t h a downwa rd t rend in revenues, 
due t o a reduc t ion in the corporate income tax rates f r o m 35 percent t o 25 percent and the 
anticipated d rop in S A C U receipts resu l t ing f r o m l ow e r im p o r t duties due t o trade 
l ibe ra l iza t ion , and the proposed large increase in spending (by 10 percent o f GDP) and 
budgetary allocations f o r PRS as w e l l as non-PRS related expenditures. 
Re f lec t ing 
these developments and the adverse impacts f r o m wo rsen ing trade prospects, the current 
account d e f i c i t (exc lud ing o f f i c i a l transfers) i s expected t o deteriorate somewhat in 
2005/06 and w i d e n h r t h e r in subsequent years. 

20. 
Lesotho’s debt indicators have improved markedly in the last two years. With 
the strengthening o f the f isca l position, the Government used t h e f isca l surplus in 2003/04 
and 2004/05 t o repay i t s domestic debt. The stock o f treasury bills f e l l f r o m 17 percent o f 
GDP in 2002/03 t o 8 percent o f GDP in 2004/05. Lesotho’s external p u b l i c debt as a 
share o f GDP dec l ined f r o m 83 percent at end 2002/03 t o 53 percent in M a r c h 2005, 
re f lec t ing the comb ined effect o f strong GDP growth, ve ry l im i t e d government 
bo r row ing , and exchange rate appreciation. The la t te r factor alone accounted f o r a 2 0 
percentage p o i n t decline. 

21. 
V i r t u a l l y a l l p u b l i c and p u b l i c l y guaranteed external debt i s h e l d by the Cen t ra l 
Government, w h i c h has taken over the debt incu r red by p u b l i c entities. In n om i n a l terms, 
as o f end -Ma rch 2005, Lesotho’s p u b l i c and p u b l i c l y guaranteed external debt stood at 
US$721.6 m i l l i o n , equivalent t o US$485 m i l l i o n in ne t present value terms. A lm o s t 80 
percent o f t h i s debt was owed t o mu l t i la te ra l creditors, m a i n l y IDA (37 percent) and the 
A f r i c a n Deve lopmen t Bank (26 percent). The remainder o f the debt i s sp l i t between 
b i la te ra l and comme rc ia l creditors (13 percent and 9 percent, respectively). Conce rn ing 
p r iva te sector debt, o n l y the obligations towards countries outside the C omm o n Mone ta ry 
A rea ( C M A ) a re recorded. At end -Ma rch 2005, these ob l iga t ions were estimated at 
US$2.2 m i l l i o n .

Overall, Lesotho presents a moderate risk of debt distress, assuming annua l

Country Priorities and Development Challenges 

23. 

A s a r t icu la ted in Lesotho’s V i s i o n 2020 document, the long - te rm v i s i o n i s that by 
the year 2020 “Lesotho shall be a stable democracy, a united andprosperous nation at 
peace w i t h itselfand its neighbors. I t shall have a healthy and well-developed human 
resource base, a strong economy, a well-managed environment and an established 
technological base ”. * The k e y elements o f th is v i s i o n are re f lec ted in Lesotho’s Pove r ty 
Reduc t ion Strategy (PRS), w h i c h was endorsed by the Bank’s and the IMF’s Execu t ive 
Boa rds in September 2005, f o l l ow i n g a highly consultative and pa r t ic ipa to ry preparation 
process i n v o l v i n g mos t o f the country’s k e y stakeholders and communities. 

24. With the ove ra rch ing development goa l “ t o p rov ide a broad based improvement 
in the standard of welfare fo r the current generation of Basotho, without compromising 
opportunities fo r future generations”, the PRS groups p r i o r i t y areas o f actions within 
three k e y p i l la rs o f p o l i c y objectives: (i) employment and income generation th rough

education standards and the conservation o f the environment; and (iii) im p r o v i n g 
governance and p u b l i c sector p e r f ~ r m a n c e . ~ Within these three pillars, the PRS iden t i f ies 
eight p r i o r i t y areas o f action, i n c l u d i n g creation o f emp loymen t opportunities; 
imp rovemen t o f ag r icu l tu ra l p roduc t ion and food security; in f ras t ruc tu re development; 
deepening o f democracy and governance and strengthening o f safety and security;

T o reverse the downward trend in health outcomes, the Government proposes to 
promote access to high-quality essential health care, reduce malnutrition, and improve 
access to social welfare services. These objectives a re re f lec ted in the ongo ing hea l th 
sector r e f o rm and sector-wide approach l e d by the Government and supported by i t s

32. 

T o achieve education for all, the Government introduced free p r ima ry 
education (FPE) in 2000, including the cost of textbooks and school feeding in all FPE 
classes. The governnient intends t o ensure that each c h i l d spends at least t e n years in 
school t o increase the chances o f finding employment. The government v iews 
investment in appropriate education as the single mos t impo r tan t con t r ibu t ion i t can make 
t o Lesotho’s long - te rm socio-economic development. F o r this reason, the education 
budget remains t h e highest o f a l l sectors, and i s set t o g r ow even further over the n e x t

t w o percent o f the recurrent budget was comm i t ted towards HIVIAIDS prevention. 
Ma ins t ream ing o f HIV/AIDS in a l l government departments has also been undertaken. 
The a la rm ing ly high prevalence o f HIV/AIDS calls f o r a strong and coordinated e f fo r t by 
the Government, the p r iva te sector, c i v i l society, and development partners t o fight the

The U n i t e d Na t ions Deve lopmen t P rog ram (UNDP), together with the 
Government, prepared a second Lesotho Status Repo r t o n the M i l l e n n i u m Deve lopmen t

Th e CAS Completion Report (CASCR) assesses the implementation of the 1998

implementation and outcomes are considered satisfactory. The C A S was f a i r l y c lose ly 
a l igned t o the Government 's development program," w h i c h focused o n two m a i n 
objectives: (i) reduc t ion o f pove r ty ( th rough j o b creation, pove r ty programs, social

and (ii) reg iona l and g loba l in teg ra t ion (by enhancing external competitiveness). The 
C A S contained a numbe r o f ac t iv i t ies a imed at con t r ibu t ing t o the achievement o f b o t h 
these overarching objectives. In particular, the C A S p rog ram inc luded support t o

T h e implementation of the CAS suffered from a setback at the outset, as well as 
from a number of dejiciencies. First, the o r ig ina l C A S was envisioned f o r the t h r e e 
years FY98 -00 , but i t s imp lemen ta t ion was extended until 2005 due t o p o l i t i c a l ins tab i l i ty 
soon after the C A S was approved and the delayed preparation o f the PRS. Second, the 
C A S did n o t i d e n t i f y a core set o f measurable outcomes. Therefore, spec i f ic outcomes t o 
assess progress we re extracted f r o m a generalized fo rmu la t ion o f outcomes o r goals. The. 
assessment o f outcomes was further limited by a l a c k o f re l iab le data b o t h f o r the coun t ry 
as a w h o l e and f o r the C A S and Bank - funded projects. A l t h o u g h the 1998 C A S 
i d e n t i f i e d m o n i t o r i n g and evaluation as a k e y issue, l i t t l e progress was made t o address 
the deficiencies. 

42. 
Th e outcome of the CASp rog ram in support ofpoverty reduction was 
unsatisfactory. The imp lemen ta t ion comp le t ion reports (ICR) o f the C omm u n i t y 
Deve lopmen t Support P ro jec t (CDSP) and t h e A g r i c u l t u r a l P o l i c y and Capac i ty Building

Desp i te the i r d isappo in t ing outcomes, the two p ro jec ts p r o v i d e impo r tan t lessons fo r the 
future. T h e CDSP was the f i rs t attempt by the B a n k t o address the demand side o f

Task Fo rce o n Capac i ty Deve lopmen t in A f r ica , e f fec t ive de l ive ry o f p u b l i c goods 
requires an engaged society as m u c h as i t requires an e f fec t ive state. Hence, while the 
f i r s t attempt o n the demand s ide o f service de l ive ry and capac i ty development failed, 
better mechanisms t o rea l ize bene f ic ia ry and commun i ty pa r t ic ipa t ion need t o be found. 
Similarly, w h i l e the APCBP did n o t w o r k as expected, ins t i tu t iona l issues in agriculture, 
pa r t icu la r ly in re la t ion t o the extension service, land reform, ma rke t ing and p r i c i n g

ways than cen t ra l m in is t ry -cen te red capacity development has t o b e found in the future.

Lessons f r om OED Eva lua t ions and C l ien t Surveys 

46. 
Th e Operations Eva lua t ion Department (OED) undertook a Country Assistance 
Eva lua t ion in 2001 arid noted several weaknesses in the implementation of the CAS. 
O E D no ted that the Bank ’s assistance in the 1990s had evo lved f r o m an emphasis o n 
s tab i l iza t ion and growth, t o a focus o n pove r ty reduc t ion and p r iva te sector development, 
but that p lanned ana ly t ica l w o r k was o n l y p a r t i a l l y implemented, l i n k s between ana ly t ica l 
w o r k and lending were weak, and that the re had been n o p u b l i c expenditure reviews. O f 
the f ive p lanned AAA p rog ram activities, o n l y t w o ( the F inanc ia l Sector Review and the 
Private Sector Deve lopmen t Study) were completed. OED ra ted Bank assistance ove ra l l 
to be mode ra te ly unsatisfactory, ins t i tu t iona l development modest, and sustainability 
uncertain. I t considered d o u b t h l whether the Bank ’s ana ly t ica l w o r k had helped shaped 
p o l i c y and in te rven t ions in Lesotho. 

47. 

The B a n k responded ac t ive ly t o the recommendations o f the O E D evaluation, 
demonstrating flexibility. I t launched a new u t i l i t i e s r e f o rm p ro jec t sho r t ly thereafter, 
w h i c h has de l ive red tang ib le r e s u l t s . In the e lec t r ic i ty sector, access has mo re than 
doubled, g r ow i n g f r om 5 t o 11 percent between 2000 and 2005. In the 
te lecommun ica t ion sector, telephone density has also increased s ign i f ican t ly , f r om 14,000 
subscribers in 2000 to 240,000 in 2005. The aggregate telephone density increased from 
1 to 10 percent b e tw e e n 2000 and 2005, with a high ra t io o f m o b i l e t o f ixed - l ine 
subscriptions (5: 1). The number o f telecenters doubled, reaching 1,200 in 2004, thus 
p r o v i d i n g add i t iona l access to end-users. S im i la r ly , w h i l e absent in the 1998 CAS , the 
B a n k responded t o the HIV/AIDS pandemic in 2001 by i n c l u d i n g a ma jo r HIV/AIDS 
component in the hea l th p ro jec t . 

48. 
A c l ien t survey was conducted in Lesotho in August 2005. Government, the 
p r iva te sector, c i v i l society, the loca l donor commun i ty , and B a n k s ta f f participated. The 
r e s u l t s showed that stakeholders we re quite interested in the Bank ’s know ledge and 
advice, as we l l as in the Bank ’s f inanc ia l resources. The respondents valued the Bank ’s 
straightforwardness and consistency o f message. The r e s u l t s support an increasing r o l e 
fo r the B a n k t o generate and disseminate know ledge that i s relevant, responsive, and 

15 

timely. The respondents expressed a desire that the Bank focus o n pove r ty reduction, 
f o l l ow e d by j o b creation, government effectiveness, infrastructure, and PSD. 

49. 
In high p r i o r i t y areas o f pove r ty reduction, strengthening the p r iva te sector, and 
agriculture, the Bank’s effectiveness was seen f a i r l y l o w compared t o other ratings. The 
survey results suggest that the Bank shou ld reassess the w o r k i t i s do ing in these areas 
and demonstrate results o n the ground. There was considerable f rus t ra t ion in n o t being 
able t o deal with issues o n the g round as opposed t o headquarters, and stakeholders 
w o u l d l i k e the Bank t o d o a better j o b commun ica t ing in terms o f projects, programs, and 
analytic wo rk . This p rov ides an oppo r tun i ty f o r the Bank t o develop a commun ica t ion 
strategy that conveys h o w i t s programs are l i n k e d t o the development p r io r i t ies o f the 
country. A recen t ly established Deve lopmen t I n f o rm a t i o n Center at the N a t i o n a l 
University o f Lesotho and the Deve lopmen t D ia logue series w i l l go a l o n g w a y towards 
this objective.

Partnership and Consultations on the CAS 

5 1. 

Th e Bank undertook recently a review of alignment and harmonization of 
development assistance in Lesotho. W h i l e the recommendations o f the rev iew , such as 
j o i n t rev iews and missions, regu la r meetings o f the Government and development 
partners, movement towards sector-wide programs, and j o i n t ana ly t ica l wo rk , are 
cu r ren t ly be ing implemented, m o r e remains t o be done. L o o k i n g ahead, t h e focus w i l l be 
p laced o n mo re upstream co l labo ra t ion o n assistance strategies with b i la te ra l donors, the 
A f r i c a n Deve lopmen t B a n k (AfDB), the EU, and the United Na t ions (UN) system, 
greater ha rmon iza t ion o f procedures, ca r ry ing ou t j o i n t analytic w o r k in k e y areas o f 
poverty, decentralization, and service delivery, and the use o f sector-wide programs in 
health, education, and transport. Annex 4 shows areas where development partners are 
cu r ren t ly p r o v i d i n g support t o Lesotho. T h e Bank w i l l also continue t o collaborate 
c lose ly with the In te rna t iona l M o n e t a r y Fund (IMF), w h i c h conducts regu la r m o n i t o r i n g 
missions, and inc reas ing ly with the In te rna t iona l Finance Co rpo ra t ion (IFC), f o l l ow i n g 
the example o f the hea l th sector. 

52. 

S im i la r ly , the PRS p rov ides the basis f o r donor ha rmon iza t ion and a l ignmen t with 
coun t ry systems. Some mechanisms are already in place t o ha rmon ize development 
assistance at the sector leve l . F o r example, there i s an expanded UN Theme G roup o n 
HIV/AIDS, j o i n t l y cha i red by a UN agency and a b i la te ra l development pa r tne r on a 
ro ta t ing basis. Dono rs mee t b i -m o n t h l y and have recen t ly ins t i tu ted regu la r meetings 

16 

with the M i n i s t e r o f Finance. However, c r i t ica l aspects o f development assistance 
commitments, disbursements, and m o n i t o r i n g are n o t yet in sync with the government 
budget cycle. The Government’s capacity t o lead and coordinate development assistance 
w i l l also requ i re strengthening. The U N D P has agreed t o take the lead in supporting 
Government in t h i s respect, with assistance f r om the Bank and other development 
partners. 

53. 

This CAS has been prepared through aprocess of extensive and broad-based 
consultations conducted during and after the production of Lesotho’s PRS. 
Consultations were ca r r ied ou t during a Coun t ry P o r t f o l i o Performance R e v i ew (CPPR) 
held in April 2005 and l e d by the Government, a P SD forum, also in April 2005, a c l ien t 
survey conducted in Augus t 2005, and a C A S retreat held in September 2005. Fu r the r 
consultations o n the d ra f t C A S were h e l d with the Government, c i v i l society, NGOs, 
development partners, and t h e p r iva te sector. These was a s t rong consensus o n 
development challenges and p r io r i t ies among various stakeholder groups, while i t was 
c omm o n l y agreed that actual imp lemen ta t ion o f policies, programs, and projects w i l l 
determine h o w successfully they w i l l be met.

Proposed Assistance Strategy 

54. 

The experiences and lessons learned in imp lemen t ing the 1998 C A S and the 
various consultations o n the n ew C A S suggest a number o f considerations t o be taken 
i n t o account in the Bank ’s support t o Lesotho in t h e c om i n g years: 

0 Th e a la rm ing progression of H IV /A IDSp reva lence needs to be addressed as a 
matter of highestpriority. A l l IDA -suppo r ted undertakings in Leso tho - projects, 
programs, and, whe re appropriate, AAA - shou ld hence fo r th inc lude a s ign i f ican t 
HIV/AIDS component. In addition, free-standing techn ica l support w o u l d seem 
warranted t o he lp ensure Lesotho’s access t o substantial grant finance available 
g loba l ly . A reg iona l H I V / A I D S p rog ram w i l l support peer learning. 

0 Stronger growth and j o b creation are required to make significant inroads in 
reducing poverty and inequality. A focused emphasis on competitiveness th rough 
ins t i tu t iona l reforms, s k i l l s development and a m u c h m o r e conduc ive environment fo r 
p r iva te business, investment, and exports in job -c rea t ing sectors i s warranted, 
i n c l u d i n g further reg iona l in teg ra t ion and economic d ive rs i f ica t ion . A thriving and 
reg iona l ly compe t i t ive p r iva te sector i s essential f o r high economic g r ow t h and 
employment creation. 

0 F u l l exploitation of the productive and job-generating potential of the ru ra l 
economy is critical in reaching a larger share of Lesotho’s poor and under- 
employed. T h i s requires a strengthened focus o n addressing the inadequate economic 
and social in teg ra t ion o f Lesotho’s r u r a l and mountainous areas in terms o f imp roved 
infrastructure, access t o p u b l i c services, and p r o v i s i o n o f adm in is t ra t ive and technical 
support f o r subsistence p roduc t ion . The strategy w o u l d also p romo te comme rc ia l 
agriculture where ma rke t opportunities exist (such as in ho r t icu l tu re , apple and che r ry 
trees) th rough establishing linkages with the Sou th A f r i c a n producers and buyers, and 

17 

w o u l d assist in the development o f new, mo re market-oriented activities such as 
tou r ism . 

Improved and more client-focused public service delivery in education, health care, 
and other areas i s of critical importance to achieve progress in human development 
and the growth and jobs agenda. Emphasis o n governance, pub l ic sector 
management, and f inanc ia l accountability are a con t inu ing p r io r i ty . Building o n 
ex is t ing in i t ia t ives and enhancing reg iona l co l labo ra t ion in service de l ive ry w i l l b e 
part o f the solution. 

Mainstreaming capacity building in the Bank program, with a l l projects including 
specific elements to build the capacity of local officials to undertake their 
responsibilities, w i l l strengthen implementation. 

Improved ability to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of policies, programs, 
and projects, i n c l u d i n g j o i n t donor support t o strengthen t h e Government’s capacity 
t o gather and analyze data, i s o f c r i t ica l importance. 

Dono r harmonization in earnest and use of 
instruments of aid delivery that are 
conducive to capacity development, i n c l u d i n g j o i n t analytic wo rk , SWAPS, 
p rog ramma t ic assistance, and phasing ou t o f p ro jec t imp lemen ta t ion u n i t s , w i l l go a 
l o n g w a y t o im p r o v e a i d effectiveness, sustainability, and p o r t f o l i o performance. 

55 . 

L o o k i n g ahead, the Bank’s comparative advantage in Lesotho l i e s in i t s ana ly t ica l 
strength and conven ing powers, comb ined with development finance and i t s a b i l i t y t o 
leverage other development partners. The Bank’s c r e d i b i l i t y - b o t h as a f inanc ia l partner 
and center o f know ledge - remains solid. I t can hence p l a y an impo r tan t r o l e in 
addressing the c r i t i c a l g r ow t h and pove r ty issues fac ing Lesotho, as w e l l as in tack l ing 
k e y challenges in p u b l i c service delivery, capacity development, and ensuring appropriate 
m o n i t o r i n g and eva lua t ion o f results. 

56. 

F l e x i b i l i t y and selectivity, as demonstrated during t h e p rev ious C A S cycle, i s 
c r i t i c a l and w i l l b e achieved th rough use o f a results f ramewo rk that sets ou t desired 
outcomes and defines key intermediate indicators. The results f ramewo rk p rov ides 
f l e x i b i l i t y t o respond t o changing circumstances and e v o l v i n g demands f o r ana ly t ica l and 
f inanc ia l services, and th is C A S proposes n o t t o f i x a p rede f ined mix o f instruments and 
sectors, even i f tentative outlines are ventured. Rather, n ew activities w o u l d b e assessed 
acco rd ing t o the i r po ten t ia l f o r ach iev ing the outcomes sought. By ensuring better 
m o n i t o r i n g o f progress towards these outcomes and their intermediate indicators, a w e l l - 
de f ined results f ramewo rk w i l l also a l l ow earlier iden t i f ica t ion o f issues, be t te r - in fo rmed 
decisions, and p ro -ac t ive corrections and p r o b l em so lv ing . 

57. 
Although not a blueprint, the results framework provides strong strategic 
directions, while leaving sufficient flexibility to respond to evolving country priorities 
and adequate scope for dialogue to appropriately design future project and program 
lending as well as analytic work. Prepared in close consu l ta t ion with Government, c i v i l 

18 

society, the p r iva te sector, b i la te ra l and mu l t i la te ra l development partners, and other 
stakeholders in Lesotho, the C A S w i l l b e imp lemen ted in co l labo ra t ion w i th these 
partners with a view t o m i n im i z e overlap and duplication, strengthen synergy, and 
op t im ize the leverage and use o f Bank resources. W e expect t o achieve the f o l l ow i n g 
fou r strategic objectives and C A S outcomes. They are fblly consistent with the three 
PRS pillars discussed above, w h i l e one o f the cross-cutting themes in the PRS, the fight 
against HIV/AIDS, i s elevated as IDA’S f i r s t strategic objective. 

Strategic Objective 1: F igh t ing H I V I A I D S pandemic (CAS outcome 1) 

58 . 

At 2 4 percent, Lesotho has one o f the highest adult H I V / A I D S prevalence rates in 
the wo r ld , m u c h h ighe r than the 7.5 percent f o r sub-Saharan A f r i c a ove ra l l . The 
epidemic has already h a d a p r o f o u n d effect in Lesotho, pos ing s ign i f ican t - and, i f 
unchecked, disastrous - development challenges t o the country. In retrospect, b o t h 
government development plans and the Bank ’s 1998 C A S attached too l i t t l e a t ten t ion t o 
th is enormous challenge. A s said earlier, th is C A S singles ou t the H I V / A I D S pandemic 
from the cross cu t t ing themes in the Government’s PRS as i t s top p r io r i ty . A s ign i f ican t 
H I V / A I D S component w i l l be inc luded in a l l fu tu re Bank projects and p rog rams in 
Lesotho. T o avo id dup l ica t ion o f effort, this w i l l b e done in close co l labo ra t ion with t h e 
N a t i o n a l AIDS Comm iss ion (NAC). The focus w i l l be o n results o n the g round and less

Strategic Objective 2: Sustainable Pro-Poor Growth and Job Creation 

60. 

F o l l ow i n g the fad ing g r ow t h impe tus f r o m LHWP and dwindling remittances, 
g r ow t h has recovered in the past f ew years thanks t o the expansion o f FDI-driven 
exports. Lesotho, however, i s faced with the dua l and urgent challenge o f deve lop ing 
new g r ow t h areas and emp loymen t opportunities. T o he lp address th is challenge, the 
C A S supports Pillar 1 o f the PRS and w i l l focus i t s support o n three areas: (i) c rea t ion o f 
an enab l ing environment f o r p r iva te sector development, exports, and inves tmen t ( fo re ign 
and domestic); (ii) exp lo i ta t ion o f g r ow t h po ten t ia l in the r u r a l economy and im p r o v i n g 
access t o infrastructure and basic services; and (iii) ensuring sustainable use o f na tu ra l 
resources and the environment. 

Creation of an Enab l ing Environment for Private Sector Development and 

61. 
Investments (CAS outcome 2.1). The p r iva te sector i s constrained by a weak business 
environment and inadequate ins t i tu t iona l support. M o r e recently, changes in p re fe ren t ia l 
t rad ing arrangements have eroded some o f the compe t i t ive advantages experienced by the 

19 

la rge ly FD I - d r i v e n garment export sector. The C A S proposes t o support government 
efforts t o address demand-side as well as supply-side constraints t o export-oriented

Infrastructure and Access to Basic Services (CAS outcome 2.2). Access t o basic 

infrastructure such as roads, water, sanitation, energy and I C T f o r g r ow t h and economic

Strategic Objective 3: Improve H um a n Development Outcomes 

67. 
As described in paragraphs 7 th rough 9, Leso tho i s faced w i th p o o r education, 
hea l th and n u t r i t i o n outcomes. There have been pos i t ive developments in the education 
sector, however, the qua l i ty o f education and management o f the sector continue t o pose 
problems. The hea l th status o f the popu la t ion appears t o have declined ove r the past 
decade - average l i f e expectancy at birth has declined, and infant mo r ta l i ty , unde r - f ive 
c h i l d mo r ta l i ty , and ma te rna l m o r t a l i t y rates a re high. M o r b i d i t y and m o r t a l i t y f r o m 
commun icab le diseases have increased in recent years as we l l . The HIV/AIDS pandemic 
has obv ious ly con t r ibu ted t o these negative trends, but there i s also an ove ra l l sense that

fully engaged in the process, but intends t o p rov ide future support th rough a PRSC 
(FYOS) t o fac i l i ta te the decentralization process.

Based o n t h e results f ramewo rk defined above, the Bank’s proposed f inanc ia l 

support t o the Government o f Lesotho i s summarized in Table 2 below, including an

ind ica t ive amount f o r FY07 -08 i s US$31.3 m i l l i o n , o f which US$13.9 million would be 
p r o v i d e d on a grant basis. Ac tua l allocations for FY 0 7 - 0 8 w i l l depend on: (i) the 
country’s performance as assessed annually by the Coun t ry P o l i c y and Ins t i tu t iona l

T o address PFM weaknesses, the government has adopted a comprehensive PFM

Unde r the n ew parameters, the Bank w o u l d have greater flexibility in f inanc ing

Leso tho faces several r isks in ach iev ing i t s development objectives. The largest

Such p rob lems affected imp lemen ta t ion o f the p rev ious CAS, pa r t icu la r ly during i t s 
ea r l ie r phase. T o address the problems experienced in the 1990s, the B a n k has made 
several k e y changes. M o s t impo r tan t ly , the Bank ’s presence in Leso tho has been 
s ign i f ican t ly strengthened, with senior s ta f f resident in the capital. In addition, the 
decentralization o f Bank coun t ry management and sector s t a f f t o Sou th A f r i c a has made a

capacity t o conceptualize and p r i o r i t i z e a clear p rog ram and i t s comm i tmen t t o the

CAS ’S focus o n results, the establishment o f the PRS’s f ramewo rk f o r development, and 
the Bank’s presence o n the g round - w i l l a l l encourage earlier iden t i f ica t ion o f issues,

5. 

T h e objectives and p i l la rs o f the CAS were aligned with Lesotho’s na t iona l development 
objectives and strategies as re f lec ted in GOL ’s ma in po l icy documents, inc lud ing the S ix th 
Na t iona l Development P lan (SNDP) fo r 1996 /97-1998 /99 and the 1997 Strategic Economic 
Options Repor t (SEOR). The p o l i c y documents cen tered on two m a i n programs: pover ty 
reduc t ion and economic integration. 

T h e GOL’s po v e r t y r edu c t ion p r o g r am focused on: 

(ii) 

(i) imp rov ing employment and income opportunities for poor people, including support fo r 
the in fo rma l sector, development o f special employment programs, and enhancement o f 
the pover ty impac t o f the Lesotho H igh lands Revenue Fund (LHRF); 
imp rov ing social services fo r the poor, inc lud ing strengthening pr imary , vocational, and 
non- forma l education, undertalung hea l th sector reform, and expanding public assistance 
(safety ne t) programs; and 
managing poverty-related environmental degradation, inc lud ing the development o f ru ra l 
environmental programs and waste management. 

(iii) 

I n t e g r a t i o n i n t o t h e reg iona l and g loba l economy focused on: 

(iv) 
(v) 
(vi) 

ma in ta in ing external competitiveness; 
p romo t ing pr iva te sector development; and 
bu i ld ing ins t i tu t iona l capacity (especially in the public sector) t o support these efforts. 

6 . 

T w o CAS p i l la rs supported the Government’s program: (i) pove r ty reduc t ion through 
investment in human resources, and (ii) support fo r closer in tegra t ion in to t h e reg iona l economy. 
The CAS proposed a base-case lend ing scenario o f four credits to ta l ing $50 m i l l ion : (i) a Social 
Fund Learn ing and Innova t ion Credit, (ii) the Second Education Sector Development Project, 
Phase 1 (ESDP), (iii) the Hea l th Sector Re fo rm Project (HSRP), and (iv) the Ma lo t i-Drakensberg 
Transfrontier B iod ive rs i ty Conservation Project (MDTBCP), which was funded by the G loba l 
Env ironmen t Fac i l i ty (GEF). T h e high-case scenario envisaged, in add i t ion t o these projects, two 
credits: (i) a Pr iva te Sector Deve lopmen t Project, and (ii) a Water Supply Project. The U t i l i t i e s 
Sector Re fo rm Project (USRP) was added upon the Government’s request, as was the H I V / A I D S 
Capacity Building Pro jec t (HCBP). The CAS envisaged f ive p ieces o f ana ly t ica l w o r k ( a Pub l ic 
Expenditure Review, an Educa t ion Review, a Hea l th Review, a Pover ty M o n i t o r i n g Support 
System, and a Reg iona l Rev iew o f Labo r Ma rke t Dynamics. The CAS p i l la rs and their supporting 
programs are analyzed fo r their outcomes in Section I1 o f this report. 

Political and Macroeconomic Background 

7 . 

N a t i o n a l elections w e r e h e l d in M a y 1998 , the same m o n t h t h a t th e CAS was 

presented to th e Bo a rd . The Lesotho Congress fo r Democracy (LCD ) w o n a l l but one 
parliamentary seat, which l e d to protests by the opposition, fo l lowed by a mutiny by m i l i ta ry 
o f f icers and general unrest in the country. Troops f r om Southern A f r ican Development 
Commun i ty (SADC) intervened and ca lm was subsequently restored. However, a po l i t ica l 
stalemate endured until new elections we re he ld in 2002. In add i t ion to the human and economic 
loss, the po l i t ica l crisis affected the imp lemen ta t ion o f the newly adopted CAS . Essentially, 
Lesotho’s agenda during the pe r iod was focused o n the reso lu t ion o f the po l i t ica l crisis, and, in 
retrospect, the Bank should have wa i ted before f ina l iz ing t h e CAS . 

8. 

No tw i th s t and ing t h e po l i t i c a l d iff icu lt ies , th e r e was n o substantial shift in 

government policies. F o l l ow i n g the 2002 elections, the Na t iona l Deve lopmen t Goals and the 

39 

V i s i o n 2020 documents were prepared, and a medium-term PRS was completed in 2004. The 
government’s development focus was redefined under the PRS to be (i) rap id ly expanding 
employment 
through private-sector-led economic growth; (ii) de l iver ing poverty-targeted 
programs tha t empower poor and vulnerable people; and (iii) deepening democracy and 
imp rov ing public sector performance. 

9. 
I n genera l , th e macroeconom ic po l icy env i ronmen t has b e en conducive f o r g row th . 
The G O L pursued an export-led economic g row th strategy documented in the Poverty Reduc t ion 
and G row th Fac i l i ty (PRGF) program signed in co l labora t ion with the IMF. Lesotho has 
performed re la t ive ly well over the past decade, except fo r 1998 when c i v i l u n r e s t after the 
election p rac t ica l ly brough t the country to a standstill. The country’s Gross Domestic Product 
(GDP) grew f r om 0.2 percent per annum in 1999 to 3.8 percent in 2002, but slumped slightly to 
3.3 percent in 2003. Gross Na t iona l Income (GNI) g row th has averaged 0.8 percent per annum 
over the same period. T h e export-led g row th has mos t ly taken place as a resu l t o f the United 
States’ A h c a G row th and Opportunities A c t (AGOA), which encouraged s ign i f ican t and rap id 
g row th in the t e x t i l e manufacturing sub-sector. Expor ts to the United States more than 
quadrupled, f r om $100 m i l l i o n in 1998 to $450 m i l l i o n in 2004, and employment in the sector 
jumped f r om 26,000 in 2000 t o 50,000 in 2004. 

10. 
A l t h o u g h Lesotho’s r e a l annu a l average GDP g r ow t h since 1 9 8 0 has been 3.4 
percent , a series o f po v e r t y m a p p i n g exercises c a r r i e d o u t in 1990 ,1993 , and 1 9 9 9 con f i rms 
that this g r ow t h has n o t r edu c ed poverty . The number o f u l t ra poo r households (defined as 
those living at o r be low h a l f the l e v e l o f the na t iona l pover ty l i n e ) increased f r om 35 percent to 39 
pe rcen t during the period, while the percentage o f households be low the na t iona l pover ty l i n e 
remained at 58 percent. The number o f households with a wage earner ( inc lud ing in the in fo rma l 
sector) declined f r om 59 percent in 1990 to 49 percent in 1999;’ during the same period, the 
number o f adults with wo rk f e l l f r om 30 percent to 23 percent. The coun try also experienced a 
decline in the Human Deve lopmen t Index, f r om 120 in 1999 to 145 in 2004. Progress in pover ty 
reduc t ion has been hampered by t h e highly skewed d is t r ibu t ion o f wea l th (with mos t g row th 
concentrated in the capital), the impac t o f the HIV/AIDS pandemic, and the reduc t ion in 
remittances f r om m ine workers. However, some progress has occurred in some sectors. Ru ra l 
water supply coverage increased f r om 52 percent to 74 percent by 2002 according to WDI 
figures, and access t o sanitation fac i l i t ies increased f r om 3 1 percent to 49 percent dur ing 1990- 
1999.’ The most impressive performance i s recorded in the education sector, where the ne t 
p r ima ry school enro l lmen t rate increased f r om 65 percent t o 85 percent between 1998 and 2002 
(See Table 1). 

Retrospective Assessment of CAS Contribution 

1 1. 
I n retrospect , t h e C A S should h a v e h igh l igh ted and addressed th e po ten t ia l imp a c t 
o f HIV/AIDS o n th e country ’s deve lopment e f fo r t . Acco rd ing to the Operations Eva lua t ion 
Department’s Coun try Assistance Eva lua t ion Repor t (OED, CAE , 2001), despite the fact that 
statistical data o n the prevalence rate fo r Lesotho was unavailable at the time, the imp l ica t ions o f 
high prevalence o f a AIDS and lowe r popu la t ion g row th o n p e r capita income g row th and pover ty

o f the country dialogue and help develop the most basic integrated hea l th in fo rma t ion system and 
ins trumen ts necessary to mon i to r H IV /ADDS was missed, and this led to an 
underestimation o f i t s rising prevalence and consequently i t s g row ing impac t on social and

economic development in the country. However, an H I V / A I D S component was added to two on- 
go ing Bank financed projects: (i) the HSRP, dur ing negotiations, and (ii) the Ag r icu l tu ra l Po l icy 
and Capacity Building Project (APCBP), at mid-term. A subsequent H I V / A I D S Capacity 
Building Project, which had n o t been envisaged under the CAS, was prepared to support G O L 
e f for ts in the fight against t h e pandemic, and became effective in 2005. 

Monitoring, tracking outcomes, and managing an operation rely on having clear 

12. 
baseline data and appropriate targets. In their absence, the management process and eventual 
performance evaluation i s considerably undermined. Lesotho i s severely deficient in statistical 
data across sectors, frustrating efforts to establish re l iab le baseline data for mon i to r ing - a key 
constraint to measuring development outcomes. T h e CAS correc t ly identified the problem. 
However, one o f the proposals to re fo rm and develop t h e country’s capacity fo r pover ty 
mon i to r ing through the Commun i ty Development Support Project (CSDP), a social fund learn ing 
and innova t ive loan (LE), underestimated the problem. In hindsight, the Bank should have 
p rov ided leadership through a full TA pro jec t to s treng then the capacity o f the Bureau o f 
Statistics (BoS) to improve i t s statistical database and promote mon i to r ing and evaluation systems 
in collaboration with other donors that have been active in t h i s f ie ld (e.g. EU, UNDP , DFID). 
The generation and use o f data i s o f par t icu lar importance in the context o f the PRSP, wh ich 
requires a na t iona l M&E system fo r a proper implementation. A l though th is i s s u e was raised by 
OED, C A E in 2001 ,3 no th ing substantial was undertaken. 

The environment for addressing development issues in Lesotho i s generally a 

13. 
formidable challenge. T h e country has acute management constraints and s ta f f ing deficiencies, 
due large ly to b ra in dra in and po l i t ic iza t ion o f the c i v i l service. Inadequate administrative and 
ins t i tu t iona l capacity in many m i n i s t i e s and government agencies make po l icy formu la t ion 
d i f f icu l t , and make coordination, implementation, and ins t i tu t iona l re forms almost impossible. 
The Coun try Po r t fo l io Performance Rev iew (CPPR), conducted in 2002 and 2005, noted 
centralization o f dec is ion-mahng at the highest l e v e l s o f administration as constraining in ter- 
m in is te r ia l communication mak ing i t d i f f icu l t to imp lemen t programs spanning across two or 
more agencies. These factors have adversely affected CAS outcomes. In response t o these 
issues, a Pub l ic Sector Improvemen t and Re fo rm Program (PS IRP ) was proposed in 2003, but the 
factors i t was intended to address have contributed to delaying pro jec t preparation beyond the 
extended CAS period.

Assessment o f CAS Outcomes 

Pillar 1: Poverty Reduction through Investing i n Human Resources 

12. 

The pillar was aligned with the Government’s goal o f improving social services by 
strengthening primary, vocational, and non-formal education, reforming health services, 

and providing safety nets. The Bank’s program focused strongly o n education and health, while 
safety n e t s - apart f rom the LE to enhance the pover ty impac t o f the Lesotho H igh lands Revenue 
Fund (LHRF) - were no t par t o f the Bank program. Substantial r e s u l t s were achieved in p r ima ry 
education in t e rm s o f imp rov ing access. In hea l th care, sector po l icy , a strategic plan, and a 
budget were formulated in an integrated fashion, while f inanc ia l management and procurement 
were improved. Table 1 summarizes some o f the outcomes and key performance ind ica tors fo r 
measuring performance. Appendix 2, constructed o n t h e basis o f Annex B 9 f r om the 1998 CAS, 
includes a l l performance indicators and comments o n specific progress made. F o l l ow i n g the 
OED rev iew , the Bank he lped to scale up Lesotho’s response to the H I V / A I D S pandemic. But

in hea l th sector reforms, in fan t and c h i l d mo r ta l i ty increased slightly during t h e CAS pe r iod and

13. 

T o r edu c e income pove r ty , th e Go v e rnm en t focused on job c rea t ion as a k e y 

outcome. T o achieve this goal, i t proposed support to the in fo rma l sector and special 
employment programs and to enhance the poverty impac t o f the Lesotho H igh lands Revenue 
Fund (LHRF). The Bank d i rec t ly contributed on ly to t h e LHRF, in add i t ion t o p rov id ing 
financial and pro jec t supervision services to the Highlands Project i tse l f . The Bank support to 
road construction and water supply ind i rec t ly buttressed j o b creation through tra in ing o f loca l 
contractors. However, the Bank LE, CDSP, intended to p i l o t demand-driven s e r v i c e delivery to 
be subsequently adopted by the LHRF and ensure systematic pover ty mon i to r ing in t h e country, 
was unsuccessful. Overall, i t appears that pover ty remained at the previous levels, wh i le ex treme 
pove r ty slightly worsened, however, household survey evidence i s n o t available t o con f i rm 
Lesotho’s pover ty trends. T h i s i s an urgent matter to be addressed by the Government, and

Outcome 1.1: Poverty Reduction in Ru ra l Areas 

14. 

I t i s doub t fu l wh e th e r p rog r am s designed to reduce po v e r t y du r ing the r e v i ew 

p e r i o d ach ieved t h e i r goals. OED rated the CDSP and the APCBP on their outcomes as 
Unsa t is fac tory and Modera te ly Unsatisfactory, respectively (Table 4). However, although 
APCBP did n o t achieve i t s development objectives over the pro jec t timeframe, i t c l e a r l y 
advanced the p o l i c y and ins t i tu t iona l framework that supports the de l ivery o f agr icu l tura l services 
to the poor through decentralization. In add i t ion to the preparation o f a Na t iona l Ag r icu l tu ra l 
Strategy (NAS) and d i s t r i c t economic strategies, an agr icu l tura l subsidy p o l i c y and a land po l icy 
were drafted, and a framework was prepared for marke t ing fac i l i ta t ion with recommendations for 
deregulation o f 13 commodities. Moreover, the extension sys tem was un i f ied and operationalized 
in a l l 10 districts o f the country and the Ministry o f Ag r icu l tu re and Food Security (MAFS) was 
streamlined through restructuring o f the central and d is tr ic t o f f ices and functions decentralized fo r 
better extension service de l ivery t o the ru ra l poor . Fou r agr icu l tura l enterprises were l iqu ida ted 
and one was privatized, creating opportunities fo r pr iva te sector par t ic ipa t ion in the de l ivery o f 
agr icu l tura l services. 

15. 

T h e CDSP, a LIL, was designed to test n ew mechan isms f o r d i rec t suppo r t to 
commun it ies t h r o u g h a commun i ty -d r iven deve lopment (CDD) app roach and t o mon i to r 

po v e r t y t rends in Lesotho . A ma jor lesson o f the LIL was h o w serious a challenge i t i s to reach 
poo r people in ru ra l communities in a highly centralized, bureaucratic, and stratified environment. 
E l i t e capture became t h e n o rm when parliamentarians became invo lved in dec id ing o n fac i l i t ies 
fo r the poor. T h e non-performing LHRF was re formu la ted with the in ten t o f supporting C D D 
projects with a pove r ty reduc t ion focus, g iv ing pre feren t ia l attention to five pre- iden t i f ied poor 
d i s t r i c t s as well as peri-urban Maseru. The new entity, the Lesotho Fund fo r Commun i ty 
Development (LFCD), was established through a Lega l No t ice in M a r c h 1999 and began 
operating in 2000. The L H W P inc luded support fo r the L F C D after the closure o f the CDSP in 
order to ensure pro-poor choices; however, the L F C D has become v i r tua l ly moribund. These 
po l icy and ins t i tu t iona l changes requ i res long- term and continuous support, and their con tr ibu t ion 
toward pover ty reduc t ion takes some time to materialize. 

Outcome 1.2: Investing in H um a n Resources 

16. 
Cons ide rab le progress was m a d e in address ing the human resource constra ints in 
Lesotho, and th e Bank’s assistance con t r ibu ted s ign if icant ly to th e outcomes. Consistent with 

the government p o l i c y t o p rov ide 10-year basic education, the ESDP Phase1 contributed to 
pr imary , secondary, and technical/vocational education. 
In p r ima ry education, the pro jec t 
financed classroom construction, tex tbook provision, bursaries to orphaned student and other 
vulnerable children, school management development, and a distance teacher education program. 
The p r ima ry n e t enrolment rose from 65 percent in 1998 t o 85 percent in 2002; and there was 
increased school comp le t ion rates as we l l . In techn ica l and voca t iona l education, t h e pro jec t 
f inanced s tud ies and p o l i c y development to support a reor ien ta t ion o f the system toward a more 
demand-dnven approach responsive to the labor market. The pro jec t also supported po l icy 
development in higher education and i s attempting to in troduce a h igher education incen t ive fund 
to energize t h e subsector.

17. 

Although high-level health indicators have not yet improved, substantial progress 
has been achieved in the health sector. The HSRP Phase 1 and APL financed by IDA (as well 

as by others donors) contributed to the achievement o f the fo l low ing resu l ts : (i) formu la t ion and 
imp lemen ta t ion o f a comprehensive hea l th sector po l icy ; (ii) development o f a performance- 
based mu l t iyea r p lan and budget linked to sectoral priorities; (iii) improvement in f inanc ia l 
management and procurement systems and procedures within the sector; and (iv) scaling up 
Lesotho’s response to HIV/AIDS through support fo r nongovernmental and pub l ic sector 
institutions. T h e s e achievements have l a i d the basis fo r an enhanced focus o n hea l th service 
delivery and outcomes during the HSRP Phase 2. 

Outcome 1.3 Promotion of a Comprehensive Approach to the Na tu ra l Env ironment 

18. 

The Bank’s support to natural environment challenges was articulated through 
three operations whose combined impact was rather limited. T h e M D T B C P project, 

undertaken j o i n t l y with a s im i lar pro jec t in South A fhca , focused o n b iod ive rs i ty conservation 
and eco-tourism development. The recent m id - te rm review concluded that the commun i ty- 
managed na tu ra l resources component i s progressing we l l . The APCBP p rov ided support on 
range management and land re fo rm issues, in add i t ion to agnculture sector reform, but i t closed 
w i thou t ach iev ing any o f i t s objectives. The Water Sector Improvement Project (WSIP) focused 
o n imp rov ing sanitation and water qua l i ty and ava i lab i l i ty in bo th peri-urban and ru ra l areas. The 
WSIP became effective in 2005. Overall, p romo t ing sustainable na tura l resource management in 
Lesotho remains a challenge that will need t o be more aggressively tackled dur ing the nex t CAS 
pe r iod and beyond. 

Pillar 2: Supporting Closer Integration into the Regional Economy 

This pillar i s in line with the Government’s strategy of maintaining external 

19. 
competitiveness. The Bank supported Lesotho’s 
external competitiveness 
through 
macroeconomic analytic w o r k in g row th and employment, pr iva t iza t ion o f state-owned 
enterprises, pub l ic sector reforms, pub l ic expenditure management reforms, and f inanc ia l sector 
reforms. The Bank’s support was essentially in two forms: assisting the country t o improve i t s 
macro-po l icy framework and support t o the Government’s in ten t ion to pr iva t ize state-owned 
enterprises and strengthen pr iva te sector development. Table 2 presents some key macro- 
performance indicators fo r measuring outcomes.

The economic performance o f the country using GDP and GNI as indicators has 
improved over the period. The enactment o f the F inanc ia l Ins t i tu t ions A c t in 1999 created a 
more conducive environment fo r the f inanc ia l sector to contribute s ign i f ican t ly to the general 
economy. Losses in two u t i l i t i e s - Telecommunications and E lec t r ic i ty - have declined, large ly 
because o f the re forms embarked upon under the U t i l i t ies Sector Re fo rm Pro jec t (USRP), wh ich 
was o r ig ina l ly n o t inc luded in the CAS . I t i s wo r th no t ing that the LHWP has had direct impact 
o n the economy over the years, con tr ibu t ing about 13.6 pe rcen t and 5.9 percent to GDP in 1998 
and 2002, respectively. 

Outcome 2.1 Improve Macro-Policy Environment 

2 1. 
The Bank’s program supported improvement in the macro-policy environment 
through a series of economic and sector work @SW). The B a n k supported this objective 
through a j o i n t Pub l ic Expenditure Management Rev iew (PEMR) completed in 1999 with the 
government and the po l icy dialogue accompanyng the preparation o f that report. F r om 1997- 
2000, there was a lapse in IMF assistance to Lesotho; since t h e resump t ion o f t h e program the 
Bank has wo rked in close cooperation with the IMF, giving more consideration to the 
ins t i tu t iona l and administrative problems, sustained growth, j o b creation, and pove r ty reduction. 
The Bank focused i t s advice o n sectoral structural reforms, including p r iva t iza t ion and pr iva te 
sector development as w e l l as the PRS, public sector reform, pub l ic expenditure management 
reform, and f inanc ia l sector re form . 

Outcome 2.2 Privatization and Private Sector Development 

22. 
Privatization o f public sector companies was initiated through the APCBP and the 
USRP . O f the 16 enterprises iden t i f ied t o be pr iva t ized under the APCBP, on ly 1 was pr iva t ized 
(leased); four were l iqu ida ted and a further two pa r t ia l ly l iqu ida ted at the close o f the project.6 
The USRP, in i t ia ted in 200 1, successfully supported p r iva t iza t ion o f Lesotho Telecoms and the 
placement o f the Lesotho E lec t r ic i ty Company (LEC) under a management contract, leading to 
the turnaround in the fortunes o f t h e two enterprises. The e lec tr i f ica t ion rate in Lesotho grew 
from 5 pe rcen t t o 11 percent between 2001 and 2004, wh i le revenues rose f r om M98 .5 m i l l i o n to

in troduc t ion o f compe t i t ion in the 
telecommunications sector has also resu l ted in a ten- fo ld increase in aggregate teledensity and 
d ive rs i f ica t ion o f services to end users . T h e to ta l number o f f ixed and mob i le subscribers rose 
f r om 36,000 in 2001 to 287,000 in 2005 (248,000 mob i le and 39,000 f ixed l i n e s ) and the number 
of telecenters f r om 628 t o 2605 between 2003 and 2005. 

The 

23. 
Although progress has been made in the privatization o f major utility companies, 
the Bank’s effort at supporting PSD was delayed. In addressing concerns raised in the O ED 

report, t h e USRP was designed, and three more A A A s , namely, the I n v e s tm e n t Climate 
Assessmen t 
(FY05), 
the Private Sector Development (FY05) and Coun try Economic 
Memo randum (FY05) were a l l completed during the extended period. In addition, a Country 
Framework Repor t on infrastructure development was completed in (FY04). T h e Bank also 
con tr ibu ted t o t h e preparation o f the Diagnostic Trade Integrated Study fo r Lesotho, j o i n t l y with 
DFID, t h e EU, and IMF. Private sector f i r m s face numerous constraints to g row th and 
development, inc lud ing a res tr ic t ive bus iness environment, weak enterprise s k i l l s , and inadequate 
ins t i tu t iona l support t o PSD. As a resu l t , the pr iva te sector in Lesotho i s characterized by high 
transaction costs, l o w labor produc t iv i ty , and l o w ab i l i ty to compete. In addition, the almost 
complete l a c k o f economic d ivers i f ica t ion and weak market linkages put at risk the sustainability 
o f economic grow th . In the next th ree years, the Government w i l l need to p lay a more active and 
supportive ro le to achieve the fo l low ing three objectives: (i) re ta in fore ign investors beyond the 
phasing-out o f trade p r i v i l e g e s and attract larger amounts o f FDI; (ii) d ivers i fy t h e economy f r om 
i ts heavy re l iance on one ac t iv i ty (apparel manufacturing) and one market (the United States) and 
(iii) be t te r in tegra t ion o f the domestic pr iva te sector with that created through FDI and with the 
RSA. T o do so, the Government must remove binding constraints to PSD; prov ide necessary 
support to the pr iva te sector; and exp lo i t the economy’s complementarities with South A fk ica and 
the investment po ten t ia l in other sectors, inc lud ing services. 

Outcome 2.3 Bu i ld Institutional Capacity 

24. 

Institutional and capacity building was an overarching goal in the CAS and 
mainstreamed in all projects executed during the period. I t i s an area where some successes 

were recorded in some sectors and l i t t l e progress made in more ambitious areas. Capacity issues 
were addressed in the education sector through distance learn ing fo r teachers and tra in ing o f 
School Adv iso ry Committees, Management Committees, Secondary School Boards, and the 
Ministry through the preparation of a PER and a MTEF. Consequently, the performance o f 
school f inanc ia l management systems and mon i to r ing have a l l improved. In the hea l th sector, 
where t h e bulk of the program was focused on capacity and ins t i tu t iona l development, notable 
achievements at the close o f the pro jec t were the capacity to coordinate and mon i to r the re fo rm 
program by the D irec tora te o f Planning; preparation o f an MTEF; improvement in f inanc ia l 
management and in forma t ion systems; and development and ins t i tu t iona l iza t ion o f a 5-year 
strategic p lan for M&E, with quarterly ac t iv i ty mon i to r ing and annual j o i n t rev iews .

The FY 9 8 CAS was intended t o be completed over a three-year period, FY99-00.

projects, were successfully completed, one new project, the APCBP, was also completed, while 
the Maloti-Drakensberg and Lesotho H igh lands projects are s t i l l ongoing. The WSP became 
e f fec t ive in late FY05 , and the pr iva te sector pro jec t i s under preparation. The fo l low ing ESW 
products were completed during the rev iew period: the Pub l ic Expenditure and Management 
Review (FY99), the Country Economic Memorandum (FY05), the Pr iva te Sector Development 
Strategy (FY05), and a F inanc ia l Sector Review (FY99). A l l o f these were discussed with the 
Government. A second pub l ic expenditure management review i s also under way. T w o new 
projects, the USRP and HIV/AIDS Capacity Building Project, no t o r ig ina l ly envisaged under the 
CAS, were prepared. An Integrated Transport Sector and Ins t i tu t iona l Re fo rm Project, also n o t in 
t h e CAS, has been under preparation since FY03 . 

26. 

The portfolio's focus o n results and the quality o f project M&E has been mixed. 

Several findings emerge f rom a recent M&E rev iew o f the country portfolio,8 such as that the 
pro jec t development objectives were e i the r too ambitious o r too modest, that there i s a substantial 
absence o f baseline data, and that the results matrices were ove r ly complex. The focus o n 
capacity building and better ins t i tu t iona l performance by several o f the projects posed a ma jo r 
p rob lem fo r identifying key performance indicators, as measuring progress and performance in 
capacity building i s generally d i f f icu l t . A l l these issues create s ign i f ican t challenges fo r 
managing fo r r e s u l t s - i.e., fo r using in fo rma t ion to improve decision-making and steer country- 
l e d development processes toward c lear ly defined goals. 

27. 

H a l f o f the exiting projects during the 1998-2004 periods have been rated as 

unsatisfactory. M o s t o f the exiting projects are n o t attributable to the CAS period, since they 
were active in the 1990-1999 per iod . O f n i n e ex i t ing projects, five were ra ted either as 
unsatisfactory or moderately unsatisfactory by OED regarding the ir outcome achievement. Wha t 
i s more important, on ly one o f the projects' has a substantial ra t ing in i t s ins t i tu t iona l 
development impac t (see Table 4) - i.e., 
the extent to which the pro jec t improves Lesotho's 
ab i l i ty to make more efficient, equitable, and sustainable u s e o f i t s human, financial, and na tura l

Overall quality at entry and quality o f supervision were rated satisfactory. The 

qua l i ty at e n t r y fo r the Hea l th and Education projects were rated satisfactory by QAG . In general, 
supervision qua l i ty has been satisfactory, as evidenced by p roac t iv i ty and rea l ism indices (see 
Table 5). Bank supervision and management support fo r the CDSP was also deemed satisfactory. 
The I C R no ted that management me t with team members to agree o n minimum actions needed to

The disbursement rat io and the annual amount o f funds being disbursed ro s e 
steadily from 12.5 in FY99 t o 30.6 in FY04 but declined to 26.5 in FY05. The lowe r rate o f 

disbursement in F Y 0 5 i s explained by two new operations (H I V / A ID S Capacity Building Project 
and the WSIP) that entered the po r t fo l io during the year and the l o n g duration o f the LHWP, as 
well as by a generally poo r disbursement performance o f the projects in the po r t fo l io . T h e 
LHWP and the USRP a re expected to close o n December 3 1,2005, but have disbursed on ly some 
60 percent, while MDTBCP , after 3.5 years and c los ing in 2 years, has disbursed 16 percent. 
None are o n track t o fully disburse. Because the absorptive capacity fo r Lesotho i s low , a number 
o f projects were closed and outstanding balances cancelled. Ex tens ion o f c los ing dates i s also 
common, large ly because o f inadequate capacity fo r implementation, inab i l i ty to meet D C A 
conditionalities, s low disbursement, and s low decision-making. 

The average cost of doing business i s among the 10 highest in the Region. The 

31. 
average cost o f supervision i s $117,000 per pro jec t compared to a Reg iona l average o f $91,000. 
This i s partly a f imc t ion o f the higher cost associated with the supervision o f the L H W P and 
pa r t ly o f centralized supervision f r om Washington. Despite i t s p rox im i ty , the Bank’s Pretoria 
Office had l i t t l e ro le in managing programs. The high cost o f do ing bus iness i s also linked to the 
l o n g dura t ion invo lved in t h e processing o f projects in the coun try and the appreciation over the 
last 3 years o f the South A f r i c a Rand, to wh ich Lesotho’s currency i s linked l - t o - I . Preparation 
of the APCBP, fo r example, was started in 1993 and i t was n o t until 1999 that the project was 
declared effective, after one year o f effectiveness delay. The Road Rehab i l i ta t ion Project, wh ich 
also started in 1991, became e f fec t ive in 1997 and closed in 2003 after a two year extension o f i t s 
c los ing date, with more than $12 m i l l i o n cred i t cancelled. In general, i t takes several years fo r 
new projects to be prepared, except fo r successor projects such as the education and hea l th 
projects that were designed as adaptable program loans (AP L s ) .

revenue generating mechanisms (through

recurrent costs and to ensure sustainability, 
Bank f inanc ing o f recurrent costs a re 
expected t o be the exception rather than the

infrastructure sectors w i l l be considered 
based o n p ro jec t and sector needs and

f inanc ing o f recurrent costs in ind iv idua l

sustainability i s s u e s at t h e sector and pro jec t

The C A S comp le t ion repo r t (Annex 2) rev iewed the performance o f the p o r t f o l i o 
during 1998-2005 imp lemen ta t ion p e r i o d and p rov ides detailed analysis o f p o r t f o l i o 
performance. The qua l i ty o f the p o r t f o l i o has im p r o v e d over the years as the number o f 
p r o b l em projects has been decreasing w h i l e disbursement r a t i o has consistently increased 
ove r the years. Qua l i ty at and en t ry f o r the H e a l t h and Educa t ion p ro jec ts we re ra ted 
satisfactory by QAG but there are challenges in mee t ing effectiveness deadlines. The 
CPPR r e v i ew o f 2005 agreed t o a minimum numbe r o f effectiveness cond i t ions in fu tu re 
projects. Compliance with f iduc ia ry requirements w i l l b e the m a i n cond i t ions for 
effectiveness in n ew lending. 

3. 
Currently, the Bank’s financing share o f projects in Leso tho i s t y p i c a l l y about 80- 
9 0 percent, with the government cove r ing the balance o f 10-20%. The government has 
been able t o sustain th is con t r ibu t ion due t o a hea l thy f isca l p o s i t i o n w h i c h has seen the 
current account de f ic i t ( inc lud ing o f f i c i a l transfers) na r rowed f r o m 11 percent o f GDP in 
20031’04 
t o less than 3 percent o f GDP in 2004/05. Th is i s la rge ly the resu l t o f tempo ra ry 
factors, m a i n l y a sharp r ise in Southern A f r i c a n Customs U n i o n (SACU ) receipts due t o 
rev ised im p o r t data f o r 2002, as w e l l as strong vo lume growth in the garment sector in 
the f i rs t h a l f o f the year, w h i c h i s n o t expected t o b e repeated in the second h a l f o f the 
year. 
In t h e ou t look p e r i o d however, Lesotho’s a b i l i t y t o sustain th is impressive 
performance i s m o r e than doubtful. I t i s vu lne rab le t o a range o f po ten t ia l ly permanent 
adverse developments i n c l u d i n g but n o t l i m i t e d to: (a) the erosion o f trade preferences 
th rough the phas ing ou t o f tex t i le quotas unde r the U r u g u a y Round Agreement o n 
Tex t i les and C l o t h i n g (ATC ) w h i c h commenced in ea r ly 2005; (b) the expected r em o v a l

A f r i c a n mines. Thus, as with other deve lop ing countries, donor funding w i l l con t inue t o 
be necessary f o r Leso tho t o achieve i t s MDG targets. 

4. 
W e propose t o a l l ow B a n k f inanc ing o f up t o 100 percent o f i n d i v i d u a l p ro jec t 
costs. The proposed enhanced f l e x i b i l i t y in expenditure eligibility w i l l n o t cause the IDA 

67 

a l loca t ion limits t o b e exceeded, but ensures f l e x i b i l i t y in the context o f ex is t ing and 
p lanned projects and programs. As the FY06 -08 IDA a l loca t ion f o r Leso tho i s fixed, 
f inanc ing up t o 100 percent o f ce r ta in projects w o u l d au toma t ica l ly mean f inanc ing less 
o f the other projects. Cost-sharing arrangements in i n d i v i d u a l projects w i l l be determined 
taking i n t o account aspects such as the government’s financing o f the development 
p rog ram f o r the sector concerned f r o m i t s o w n resources, the p ro jec t cost estimates; and 
co - f inanc ing by other partners. Bank financing share i s expected to be typically l ow in sector- 
wide approaches (SWAps), and would be moderate in infrastructure projects. W h i l e in the 
immed ia te term, the Bank ’s f inanc ing share o f to ta l expenditure m a y increase ma rg ina l ly , 
this i s expected t o reduce ove r t im e by greater use o f SWAps, especially in the social 
sectors.

In a l l cases, the emphasis o n bo r rowe r comm i tmen t and owne rsh ip w o u l d 
continue, 
In the absence o f a f inanc ia l contribution, government comm i tmen t t o the

Government’s con t inued support t o activities p rev ious ly supported by IDA (e.g., in the

Recurrent Cost Financing 

6. 

Ove r the last few years, recurrent expenditures represented about 80 percent o f 
to ta l p u b l i c expenditures in Lesotho. Cu r ren t ly in Lesotho, the Bank finances l im i t e d 
recurrent costs in l i n e with the ex is t ing p o l i c y (ma in ly f o r p ro jec t operating costs). 

7. 

In Lesotho, increased f inanc ing o f recurrent costs pe r se does n o t jeopa rd ize f isca l 
o r debt sus ta inab i l i ty as recurrent costs are already well integrated i n t o the budget 
preparation and execu t ion processes, and f inanc ing o f these costs by t h e Bank w o u l d n o t 
in t roduce any special considerations f o r f isca l sustainability. 
The Government 
recognizes that p u b l i c sector re fo rms are essential in the m e d i um t e r m t o bring resources 
in l i n e with the p r io r i t ies o f the PRSP. The Bank w i l l con t inue t o ca r ry ou t sector-focused 
and general P u b l i c Expend i tu re Reviews, and other ana ly t ic and adv iso ry activities, t o 
highlight m a j o r issues re la t ing t o f isca l and debt sustainability. 

8. 

We propose f inanc ing recurrent costs as needed t o meet p ro jec t development 
objectives, i n c l u d i n g salaries o f P I U staff, consistent with sus ta inab i l i ty and f iduc ia ry 
concerns. 
F inanc ing o f recurrent costs, 
i n c l u d i n g salaries, w o u l d fac i l i ta te the 
imp lemen ta t ion o f ce r ta in projects, especially those in the env i ronmen ta l and social 
sectors. M o s t sectors have ongo ing d i f f icu l t ies with re ta in ing qua l i f ied staff, and receipt 
o f adequate and consistent funding f o r extension services, and imp lemen ta t ion and 

68 

maintenance o f l o c a l development programs. Therefore, i t i s impo r tan t f o r IDA to re ta in 
flexibility t o fund recurrent costs as needed in i n d i v i d u a l projects especially with l o n g 
t e rm im p a c t o n human cap i ta l and p roduc t iv i ty . Under current Bank po l icy , c i v i l servants 
w o u l d have t o res ign f r o m their pos i t ions in order t o w o r k o n Bank - f inanced projects. 
T h i s i s n o t seen as a v iab le option, however, since pensions are n o t transferable from the 
p u b l i c t o the p r iva te sector. C i v i l servants are thus o n l y ma rg ina l ly i n v o l v e d in the 
management o f projects, and opportunities f o r capacity building within the government 
are lost. Enhanced f l e x i b i l i t y in recurrent cost f inanc ing w o u l d be bene f ic ia l in the case 
o f f inanc ing service de l ive ry o f p u b l i c entities, pa r t icu la r ly decentralized ones. Funding 
o f recu r ren t expenditures under investment operations imp roves the l i k e l i h o o d o f 
a t ta in ing development objectives w h i l e im p r o v i n g sustainability o f the country’s 
developmental programs in the medium t o l o n g term. 

9. 
In in f ras t ruc tu re sectors, revenue generating mechanisms (through u s e r fees, 
ta r i f fs ) t o cover recurrent costs and t o ensure sustainability are in place, and are b e i n g 
imp roved . These mechanisms w i l l b e u t i l i z e d t o achieve f inanc ia l sustainability. Thus in 
the in f ras t ruc tu re sectors, f inanc ing o f recurrent costs are expected t o b e the excep t ion 
rather than t h e no rm . 

10. 
The t rack reco rd o n sustainability o f p ro jec ts closed in the last f ew years has b e e n 
gene ra l ly good: since 2001, f i v e closed p ro jec ts h a d ICR sustainability ratings o f l i k e l y 
(Hea l th Sector R e f o rm project, R o a d Rehab i l i ta t ion and Maintenance Project, Second 
Educa t ion Sector Deve lopmen t Project, A g r i c u l t u r a l P o l i c y and Capacity Building and 
PrivatisationRestructuring projects), and one h a d a highly unlikely r a t i n g (Commun i ty 
Deve lopmen t Support Project). I t i s acknowledged that recurrent cost f inanc ing carries 
with i t r isks o f sustainability. F o r that reason, we propose that the recurrent cost f inanc ing 
shou ld b e app l ied o n a selective and case-by-case basis. In de te rm in ing B a n k f inanc ing 
o f recurrent costs in i n d i v i d u a l projects, the Bank w i l l take i n t o account sustainability 
issues at the sector and p ro jec t levels. 
In addition, at coun t ry leve l w e propose t o 
regu la r ly m o n i t o r such r i s k s th rough the CPPR exercises. As men t ioned above, there w i l l 
also b e general and sector-specific Pub l ic Expend i tu re Reviews, where issues o f 
sus ta inab i l i ty w i l l b e i d e n t i f i e d t o p rov ide a basis f o r an ove ra l l dialogue with the 
government, and changes w i l l be made i f needed accordingly. 

111. 

Lo c a l Cost F inanc ing 

11. 
The to ta l f inanc ing requirement f o r Lesotho’s development p rog ram i s M 1 . 2 
b i l l i o n (12 percent o f GDP), o f w h i c h M 5 2 5 m i l l i o n (5.2 percent o f GDP) are 
domes t ica l ly financed. The remainder i s f inanced ex te rna l ly th rough a mix o f g r a n t s and 
loans. The imp l ica t ions o f imp lemen t ing the PRS are n o t fully reflected in these 
estimates. The PRS has been costed at ove r US $ 6 0 0 m i l l i o n ove r the three year period. 
T a k i n g the cost o f imp lemen t ing the PRS i n t o account, i t i s clear that the f inanc ing 
requirements f o r Lesotho’s development p r o g r am exceed the p u b l i c sector’s ow n 
resources generation capacity. The Leso tho p o r t f o l i o inc ludes projects in the soc ia l 
sectors, safety nets, c omm u n i t y development, H I V / A I D S , road rehab i l i ta t ion and 
maintenance whose m a j o r i t y expenditures are l o c a l as opposed t o foreign. On average, 
57% o f IDA disbursements f o r FY 0 2 - 0 4 we re towards l o c a l costs. The lend ing ac t iv i t ies 

69 

foreseen f o r 2006-08 are expected t o continue t o require substantial con t rac t ing o f l o c a l 
goods and services. Hence the f inanc ing o f l o c a l expenditures alone w o u l d n o t be 
su f f ic ien t . Lesotho meets the requirements f o r Bank f inanc ing o f l o c a l costs; and 
therefore the Bank m a y finance l o c a l costs and fo re ign costs in any p ropo r t ions as needed 
for i n d i v i d u a l projects. 

IV . Financing o f Taxes and Duties 

12. 
Lesotho’s tax system i s generally efficient, with a broad-based value-added tax 
(VAT) w h i c h i s supplemented by corporate and personal income taxes, and excise duties. 
Domes t ic tax revenues are app rox ima te ly 2 0 percent o f GDP and tax adm in is t ra t ion i s 
considered e f f ic ien t . Customs duties are shared within the S A C U f ramewo rk . Ad va lo rem 
rates (39 bands) range f r o m zero t o 55 percent with mo re than h a l f o f the l ines bea r ing a 
zero rate. The highest rates are app l ied t o luxury consumer goods w h i c h are n o t 
applicable in Bank - f inanced projects. Personal income i s taxed at the ra te o f 25 percent 
f o r the f i rs t M33,075 of taxable income and 35 percent thereafter. Corporate taxes range 
f rom 5 percent (manufacturing) t o 25 percent f o r (non-manufacturing income). The VAT 
has been set at fou r d i f fe ren t rates applicable t o d i f fe ren t categories o f goods and 
services: there i s n o VAT o n goods and services exported f r om Leso tho and o n basic 
staples as well as ag r icu l tu ra l inputs; 5 percent VAT o n e lec t r ic i ty and telephone 
services; 14 percent o n other supplies o f goods and services and 15 percent o n a lcoho l 
products and tobacco products. Bank f inanced projects are taxed at the same rate as the 
country’s n o rm a l rates. Lesotho’s taxes have been assessed as l o w to moderate and are 
n o t considered excessive, thus there are n o taxes o r duties that the Bank w o u l d n o t b e 
able t o finance. At the p ro jec t - leve l however, the Bank w o u l d consider whether taxes 
and duties constitute an excessively high share o f p ro jec t costs and w i l l make any 
necessary adjustments during p ro jec t preparation.
