Executive Summary 

(i) This three-year Country Partnership Strategy builds on Bulgaria’s considerable 
achievements over the last eight years which have brought i t to the threshold o f EU 
accession. Fo l low ing a d i f f icu l t transition which culminated in a severe financial and social 
c r i s i s in 1996-97, Bulgaria established macroeconomic stability and accelerated structural 
reforms. Fiscal discipline was introduced and debt brought well within Maastricht criteria. Mos t 
non-infrastructure enterprises and virtually a l l banks have been privatized or liquidated, trade 
and p r ices were liberalized, and the investment climate improved. As a result, growth has 
accelerated to about 5 percent per year during 2000-05, in f la t ion slowed to single digits, 
unemployment declined to 10.7 percent in 2005 from 18 percent in 2000, and poverty levels 
dropped during t h e period. The private sector share in the economy at 75 percent o f GDP i s now 
in l i n e with the share in the eight EU new member states (EU-8). Bu i ld ing on these major 
achievements, Bulgaria completed formal negotiations on EU membership in April 2005 and i s 
expected to realize i t s goal o f EU membership on January 1,2007, fo l low ing a f ina l go-ahead b y 
the European Commission in mid-2006. 

(ii) At the same time, key challenges remain fo r Bulgaria’s successful integration with 
the EU. Bulgaria’s per capita income, at PPS in 2003, was 31 and 56 percent o f the average 
level o f EU-25 and the EU-8 countries respectively. To narrow this large income gap, Bulgaria 
w i l l need to improve efficiency o f the economy and set i t on a higher growth path leading to 
sustained improvements in l i v i n g standards. Bulgaria also faces an investment gap in both 
human and physical infrastructure capital as a resu l t o f years o f relatively l o w investment which 
i s only now catching up. To accelerate convergence with the EU, Bulgaria faces four major 
challenges. First, and foremost, to push ahead with reforms to promote productivity and 
employment for sustained high private sector led growth. T h i s i s particularly pressing for 
Bulgaria as i t has the worst demographic conditions in Europe and i t s employment rate i s well 
below EU average. Second, to strengthen institutional capacity and public finance management 
for improved se rv ice delivery, fiscal sustainability and effective absorption o f EU grant fimds 
which could reach about 3.7 percent o f GDP in 2007-09 i f managed well. Third, to address 
poverty and social exclusion aimed at wider participation in growth. And fourth, to maintain 
macroeconomic stability and manage risks related to the widening cu r ren t account de f ic i t and the 
rapid increase in private sector credit as the foundation for continued strong economic growth. 

(iii) The CPS seeks to help Bulgaria meet these challenges and facilitate Bulgaria’s 
economic and social integration with the EU . The Government has requested that t h e Bank 
continue to stay involved in Bulgaria with a full-service, yet focused, assistance program over 
the coming years o f EU accession and integration. In l i n e with the directions o f Government’s 
medium t e r m program, and bu i ld ing on Bulgaria’s development priorities and the Bank’s 
comparative advantage in Bulgaria, the CPS w i l l support th ree overall priorities: (i) p roduc t iv i ty 
and employment - implementation o f unfinished structural reforms and investments to strengthen 
productivity and employment in support o f private sector led growth along the l i n e s o f the EU 
Lisbon agenda; (ii) f i s c a l sus ta inab i l i ty and abso rp t ion of EU funds - capacity building for 
improved public expenditure management, investment planning, and development o f project 
pipelines eligible for EU funds, coupled with development o f effective mechanisms to combine 

i i 

Executive Summary 

EU, l o c a l and IF1 financing; and (iii) soc ia l inc lus ion - po l ic ies and investments t o reduce 
reg iona l imbalances and imp rove social inc lus ion fo r pove r ty reduction. 

(iv) Within this broader strategic framework, the consultations with Government 
resulted in a focused set o f priorities f o r initial Bank involvement. The strategic 

consultations o n the Bank’s f u t u r e invo lvemen t p rov ided a strong preference f o r i n i t i a l Bank 
invo lvemen t in addressing the un f in ished r e f o rm agenda in health, education and social 
protection, and in implementing f isca l ly sustainable investment programs in roads, mun ic ipa l 
infrastructure, social inc lus ion and regional development, coupled with an e f fec t ive absorption o f 

EU funds. 

(v) 
I n line with Bulgaria’s achievements, the Bank will adjust its business model in 
future country assistance and move towards a partnership model with greater flexibility. 

The n ew business mode l w i l l invo lve (i) a mo re f lex ib le approach t o defining lend ing and non - 
lend ing ac t iv i t ies within the b road CPS strategic priorities, with an agreed assistance p rog ram f o r 
F Y 0 7 and an ind ica t ive p rog ram fo r FY08 -09 t o be revisited by an annual consultation process 
with Government; (ii) lending up to an agreed c e i l i n g based o n continued sound macroeconomic 
performance and prudent country risk assessment and IBRD exposure management, inc lud ing 
greater choice in lend ing ins t rumen ts and t h e share o f fast disbursing operations; and (iii) a move 
towards programmatic approaches in lend ing coupled with gradual alignment o f Bank 
procedures with country systems while ensuring compliance with prudent Bank f iduc ia ry 
standards. 

(vi) 

The proposed lending program up to U S 3 0 0 million per year would involve three 
operations per year based on a series o f Development Policy Loans @PLs) and 
programmatic investment loans in support o f the above priority areas. A series o f three 

programmatic DPLs o f about U S $ l S O m i l l i o n each w o u l d focus o n advancing t h e un f in ished 
re fo rms in health, education, and social protection, in support o f growth, employment, f isca l 
sustainability and social inclusion. The DP L s w o u l d be Complemented by up t o t w o investment 
operations per year t o help with imp lemen ta t ion o f p r io r i t ized investment programs and 
absorption o f EU b d s in roads and mun ic ipa l infrastructure, social inclusion, and reg iona l 
development. They w o u l d build o n sound med ium - te rm sector expenditure frameworks. 

(vii) The AAA program agreed with the Government would be front loaded to provide 
analytical support and advice in co re policy areas and underpin the design o f lending 

operations. The CPS includes up f ron t core AAA o n strengthening the investment c l ima te f o r 
p r iva te sector g r ow t h and employment, and a second phase Pub l ic Finance P o l i c y Rev iew . A

while a f iduc ia ry ( C F A N C P A R ) update w i l l unde rp in the D P L series.

sector where IFC i s gradually shifting i t s focus to the non-bank financial sector; (ii) the corporate 
sector where i t w i l l continue to support the rehabilitation and modernization o f post-privatized 
companies and promote foreign investments to foster technology t rans fe r for productivity gains; 
and (iii) infrastructure where i t w i l l support public-private partnerships and catalyze FDI. The 
Bank and IFC w i l l collaborate in developing a j o i n t program in financing water and waste water 
investment needs in selected municipalities. M I G A i s open for opportunities to support foreign 
investors through the provision o f po l i t ica l risk guarantees, also on a sub-sovereign level. 

The proposed strategy faces a number o f risks. The main risk wou ld be a possible

slow down in the reform agenda fo l low ing EU accession which in turn could trigger a slowdown 
in growth. This risk i s mitigated b y the external discipline provided by the EU accession and 
integration agenda. T h e r i s k s to macroeconomic stability, particularly from the widening cu r ren t 
account de f ic i t and external developments in in te res t rates, o i l prices and FDI flows, a re reduced 
b y the government’s strong record o f sound macroeconomic and fiscal management and t h e 
su rve i l lance roles played b y the I M F and the EU’s Stability and Growth Pact upon Bulgaria’s 
EU accession. 

Board members may wish to discuss the following aspects: 

0 Does the CPS adequately respond to the needs o f Bulgaria, balancing f lex ib i l i ty and 
client responsiveness with a strategic framework to guide and focus the program? 

0 A r e the suggested principles for Bank lending engagement appropriate? 

BULGAR IA 
COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY F Y 2007-2009 

I. Introduction 

1. 
This three-year Coun t ry Partnership Strategy fo r Bu lga r ia (FYO7-09) w i l l cover the 
pe r iod when the country i s expected to jo in the EU. The CPS builds on Bulgaria’s 

considerable achievements over the last eight years and proposes a Bank program in support o f 
Bulgaria’s integration and convergence with the EU. I t follows completion o f the previous CAS 
which covered the period FY02-05,’ and which included the completion o f the P A L ser ies in 
support o f Bulgaria’s broad structural reform agenda. The CPS would evolve the Bank’s 
relationship with Bulgaria towards a flexible arrangement within a th ree year strategic 
framework, also drawing on the Bank’s agenda for well-performing Middle Income Countries 
(MICs). T h e proposed Bank involvement draws on a number o f strategic consultations with the 
Government which requested a renewed partnership with the Bank - including a lending 
program up to US$300 m i l l i o n per year - focused on a limited se t o f priorities for in i t ia l Bank 
involvement: (i) the unfinished reform agenda in the human development area, and (ii) 
implementation o f fiscally sustainable investment programs in infrastructure, social inclusion 
and regional development to help absorb t h e considerable EU grant funds which accompany 
Bulgaria’s EU accession. 
I t builds on the lessons from the previous CAS and the Bank’s 
involvement in the EU-8 new members states. 

A. Po l i t ica l Deve lopments 

11. Country Context 

2. 

EU accession on Janua ry 1,2007, i s the cen t ra l focus o f the Government. Bulgaria 

signed i t s EU accession treaty in April 2005, fo l low ing completion o f the formal negotiation 
process. Since then, the European Commission has tracked Bulgaria’s progress on a few key 
outstanding areas. The EU monitoring report o f last October highlighted shortcomings in j u s t i c e 
and organized crime, fraud and corruption, and the preparation o f administrative s truc tures for 
channeling EU funds, which would need to be resolved b y the time a f ina l monitoring report i s 
prepared in M a y this year to keep accession in 2007 on track. I f readiness i s judged insufficient, 
a “safeguard clause” in the treaty may be invoked to delay membership by a year.* In the 
meantime, the ratification process o f t h e accession treaty b y EU member states has been 
underway to permit Bulgaria’s timely accession. Government in the meantime has been 
singularly focused on meeting i t s commitments in the remaining areas o f EU concern. 

3 . 
T h e new three-party coalition government has a la rge ma jo r i ty , but i t s stability w i l l 
be tested by the fo r thcom ing Presidential elections. The coalition government i s made up o f 

the th ree largest pa r t ies to emerge from the elections last June and has a comfortable two-thirds 

’ / FY06 was treated as an interim year between the previous CAS and the CPS to allow preparation o f the CPS in 
consultation with the new government which took office in August 2005 following the June 2005 general elections.

majority in Parliament. 
I t i s led b y the center-left Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP) wh ich 
emerged with most of the votes, and i s fu r the r made up o f the two partners in the previous 
coalition government - the centrist Simeon I1 National Movement (NMS2) and the mainly e thn ic 
Turkish Movement for Rights and Freedoms (MW). The program o f the new government 
centered on EU accession shows a h igh degree o f continuity from the previous government, with 
a focus on economic growth and stability. I t supports a continued conservative fiscal po l icy and 
maintenance o f the currency board which l i n k s the local currency to the Euro. The forthcoming 
Presidential elections in November may complicate the relations in t h e coalition with an SNM2 
candidate possibly running against the incumbent socialist President. A possible delay in EU 
membership may also tes t the strength and resolve o f the coalition. W h i l e such developments 
may affect the pace o f reform, the risk o f major deviations from the current reform path i s 
reduced b y Bulgaria’s EU accession agenda and the strong record o f reform established in the 
last eight years. 

B. Economic Developments 

4. 
Over the last eight years, Bulgaria has made impressive progress towards long-term 
stability and sustained growth. Fo l low ing a d i f f icu l t transition which culminated in a severe 
c r i s i s in 1996-97, macroeconomic stability was reestablished and has been maintained b y 
prudent fiscal policies and strict discipline in incomes po l icy anchored in the Currency Board 
Arrangement (CBA) adopted in 1997. Fiscal consolidation reduced the overall fiscal deficit 
from 15.2 percent o f GDP in 1996 to a balanced budget in 2003 and generated a fiscal su rp lus in 
2004 (1.7 percent o f GDP) and 2005 (2.3 percent). The external and public debt to GDP ratios 
declined from nearly 100 and 107 percent o f GDP respectively in 1997, to about 68 and 32 
percent respectively in 2005. As a resu l t o f these policies and deep structural reforms, average 
growth reached the levels o f the eight EU New Member States (NMS-8) at about 5 percent per 
year in 2000-05. (estimated at 5 .5 percent in 2005) and in f la t ion has declined to single digits from 
hyperinflation levels (estimated at 5.0 percent in 2005). Unemployment also declined f rom 18 
percent in 2000 to 10.7 percent b y end-2005, but masks a continued l o w labor market 
participation rate. 

5 . 

A broad structural reform agenda has contributed to solid economic performance. 
The severity o f the 1996-97 c r i s i s and the prospect o f EU accession changed the po l i t ica l 
economy in the direction o f reforms. Be tween 1998 and 2002, most o f the non-infrastructure 
enterprises and banks were privatized or liquidated, trade and prices were liberalized, energy 
reforms made important progress, and the f i r s t steps were taken in regulatory re form to improve 
t h e investment climate. As a resu l t , growth i s led by the private sector wh ich now accounts for 
75 percent o f Gross Domestic Product (GDP) with an equal share o f total employment. 
Integration with external markets expanded with trade in goods and serv ices increasing relative 
to GDP from 94 percent in 1998 to almost 140 percent in 2005. Foreign direct investment (FDI) 
flows increased during the period, but remained broadly constant as a share o f total investment. 
Investor confidence improved over time - both domestically and externally. Bulgaria’s long- 
t e rm foreign currency debt was upgraded to an investment grade rating in the s umm e r o f 2004.

6. 

Despite the positive developments over the last eight years, important gaps in 
reforms and performance remain relative to the EU New Members States. Despite a well 

diversified trade partnership and a l ibera l trade regime which provide Bulgarian producers with 

4 

Bulgaria: Country Partnership Strategy 

easy access to global markets, i t s economy has yet to benefit more fully from i t s integration with 
the EU and external markets. Bulgaria’s export capacity remains l im i ted compared to the E U - 8 
countries. Competitiveness remains mostly limited to unsk i l led labor-intensive and energy- 
intensive activities. This can be explained b y the remaining gaps in structural reforms in 
Bulgaria relative to the E U - 8 as shown in Figure 2 below for two phases o f the reform agenda.

Economic growth i s expected to remain strong. Based on continued growth o f 

domestic demand and a recovery in exports, GDP i s estimated to have grown b y 5.5 percent in 
2005. Du r ing 2006-08, growth i s expected to remain strong and stay in the 5.5 to 6 percent 
range per year (see Annex B 6 for t h e medium-term macroeconomic fiamework). So far 
economic growth has been supported b y h igh private consumption and to lesser extent b y 
intensified investment activity. Over the medium-term, private consumption growth i s forecast 
to slow down, while investments in the real sector and FDI flows are expected to remain h igh 
and the trade balance expected to improve due to the forthcoming EU accession. 

8. 
The widening current account deficit remains a serious concern and poses a 
considerable macroeconomic risk. T h e de f ic i t has been rap id ly increasing in the past few 
years, reaching an estimated 11.8 percent o f GDP in 2005. The Government has responded b y 
tightening the fiscal stance and by taking measures to control the growth o f credit to the private 
sector. The f i s c a l s u r p l u s was over two percent o f GDP in 2005, and i s expected to r i s e to about 
th ree percent o f GDP in 2006 to help control the current account deficit. Over the medium-term, 
fiscal surp luses are projected to continue. T h e impact o f these measures has been limited 
though. Further restructuring and consolidation o f the budget w i l l also be required to 
accommodate the forthcoming flows o f EU grant funds wh ich are estimated to have a n e t fiscal

impac t o f about two percent o f GDP during 2007-093. The fiscal stance w i l l also need t o rema in 
su f f ic ien t ly 
f lex ib le t o respond t o possible external shocks (also see 
the section o n 
creditworthiness and risk management below). So far the current account de f ic i ts have been 
la rge ly covered by FDI in f lows , w h i c h are projected to remain high g iven the expected EU 
accession. However, sustaining high fo re ign i n f l ow s w i l l require continued improvements in the 
business climate, inc lud ing the needed re fo rms in the jud ic ia ry . 

9. 
T o meet the criteria fo r entering the eu ro zone, Bulgaria would also need to further 
curtail inflation. 

I n f l a t i o n i s projected t o p i c k up to about 7 percent in 2006 as a result o f 
increases in excise taxes, impact o f floods last year and this year o n ag r icu l tu ra l prices, and 
possible impac t o f further o i l p r ice increases, but t o decline in the f o l l ow i n g years.

The IMF has completed the second review o f the Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) in 

early Ap r i l 2006. A precautionary 25-months SBA with access o f SDRlOO m i l l i o n was 
approved b y the IMF Boa rd o n August 6, 2004, and the f i rs t review was completed o n M a y 18, 
2005. T h e SBA-supported p rog ram seeks t o reduce Bulgaria’s increased external vu lne rab i l i ty 
and t o achieve sustainable high g r ow t h through: (i) continued tight f isca l p o l i c y and measures t o 
reduce bank liquidity in order t o reduce excess demand in the short run; and (ii) structural 
re fo rms t o boost output and export capacity in the medium-term. The current arrangement may 
be extended beyond September 2006 to support satisfactory p rog ram imp lemen ta t ion in light o f 
Bulgaria’s continued high external vu lne rab i l i ty . Once Bu lga r ia j o i n s the EU, i t s pa r t ic ipa t ion in 
the EU’s S tab i l i ty and G r ow t h Pact (SGP),4 with related mu l t i la te ra l surveillance, w o u l d he lp t o 
sustain Bulgaria’s prudent macroeconomic policies. 

C . Developments in Poverty Reduction, Gender and MDGs 

11, 
Continued growth since the 1996-97 economic c r is is has led to improvements in 
living standards generally, although deep pockets o f poverty persist. Per capita income has 

increased f i o m US$1,200 in 1997 t o US$2,740 in 2004 (GNI, A t las method). Nevertheless, per 
capita GDP, at PPS in 2003, was j u s t over 30 percent o f EU average w h i c h makes continued 
g r ow t h and convergence o f living standards towards EU standards a core p o l i c y goal. As 
incomes in Bu lga r ia have risen, pove r ty has fallen. Poverty, measured at two - th i rds o f average 
per capita consumption in 1997, f e l l by two - th i rds between 1997 and 2001. The depth and 
severity o f pove r ty also improved. A l t h o u g h there are n o comparable surveys fo r the pe r iod after 
2001, a mo re recent study that used econometric techniques t o estimate comparable numbers 
showed that pove r ty had fa l len f r om 24 percent in 2001 t o 21.9 percent in 2003. T h i s study 
showed that the decline was mos t ly o n account o f improvements in r u r a l areas, where pove r ty 

/ The impact o f EU grant f lows o n the country i s estimated at 3.7 percent o f GDP during 2007-09. T h e net f isca l 
impact estimated at about two percent o f GDP during 2007-09 also takes i n t o account Bu lgar ia contributions to EU 
budget, and co/pre-financing requirements o f EU financed investments. 
/ T h e m a i n objective o f the S tab i l i ty and G row th Pact (SGP) i s to enforce discipline in the Euro-zone as a means to 
support pr ice stability and sustainable growth. Budgetary discipline i s gauged w i t h respect t o two criteria: a general 
government deficit-to-GDP ra t io be low three percent, and a debt-to-GDP ra t io be low 60 percent. Func t ion ing o f the 
SGP res ts o n two pillars: mu l t i la tera l surveillance and corrective mechanisms, As regards surveillance, EU member 
states are required t o prepare a Convergence Program and update i t annually. T h e European Commission (EC) 
prepares an assessment o f such convergence programs o n the basis o f wh ich the Counc i l o f the EU issues an 
opinion. As regards corrective mechanisms, the Excessive D e f i c i t Procedure iden t i f ies and forces corrections o f 
excessive deficits, defined under non-exceptional circumstances as a de f ic i t over three percent o f GDP. 

6

continues to be higher than in urban areas. At the same time, inequality in urban areas increased. 
The study showed that extreme poverty i s l ow at 4.8 percent o f households, while food poverty 
(a proxy for malnutrition) i s virtually non-existent. As poverty has fallen, the nature o f poverty 
has evolved with poverty increasingly concentrated among vulnerable groups. Analysis o f the 
2003 data establishes that the poverty pro f i le in Bulgaria has come to resemble poverty patterns 
in other CEE countries more closely - key determinants o f household welfare and poverty are 
household size, number o f children, education or occupation o f the head o f household, gender, 
ethnicity and location (see B o x 1). 

Box 1: Bu lgar ia - Who a re the Poor? 
The poor are more likely to be found outside Sofia. T h e poverty rate in ru ra l areas was estimated at 29.1 
percent in 2003, compared t o 18.7 percent in urban areas. Welfare differences b y location, however, become 
sharper when Sofia c i t y i s compared to other - urban or rura l - areas. Even taking in to account the differences in 
characteristics (such as education, f am i l y size, etc.) between ru ra l and urban households, the per capita 
consumption o f households l i v i n g outside Sofia i s 10 to 25 percent lower than that fo r households l i v i n g in the 
capital c i ty . 

People living in large households with two or more children are more likely to be poor. On ly a fifth o f the 

population lives in households w i t h f ive or more members, but they account fo r about 41 percent o f the poor. 
People l i v i n g in households w i t h two or more children account fo r over a third o f the poor. 
A strong correlate of poverty is ethnicity. Roma. households account f o r about 6 percent o f the population 
according to the survey, but f o r over a fifth o f the poor. Per capita consumption in a Roma household i s on ly 
h a l f o f t h e consumption o f a similar non-Roma household. 

Human capital is a strong policy lever for reducing poverty. Over two- th irds o f the poor consist o f people 

l i v i n g in households where the head has l e s s than high-school education. Per capita consumption i s 30-35 
percent higher in households where the head has completed high school o r technical education and 4 5 percent 
higher when the head has completed un ivers i ty s tud ies (relative t o a household where the head has on ly 
completed pr imary education). 

Private entrepreneurs and employed individuals are relatively protected from paver@. T h e poverty rate i s 

significantly lower in households headed by employers, self-employed or employees, wh i le t h e risk o f poverty i s 
tw ice as high in households headed b y the unemployed and inactive (other than pensioners) compared to the r e s t 
J f the population. 
Poverty is not gender neutral. The risk o f poverty i s slightly higher in households headed b y women, usually 
jingle parent households. When differences in education, location and other characteristics are taken in to 
%ccount, per capita consumption in these households i s 10 percent lower than in those headed by men. 
iurce: Bu lgar ia MTHS data, 2003. 

12. While Bulgarian men and women have equal legal status, individual and family 
rights, and protection under the law, a gender gap persists in the labor market and 
participation in political l i f e and decision making, while serious imbalances continue 

among Roma women and girls. Equal rights o f men and women are guaranteed by the 
Constitution and reinforced by the recent adoption o f the L a w o n Protection against 
Discrimination and o f special provisions for non-discrimination and equal labor opportunities in 
the Labor Code. In education, female participation rates a re higher at basic and te r t ia ry level and 
lower at secondary level. However, women benefit l e s s than men fkom professional education 
and life-long learning opportunities. In the labor market, despite legal safeguards women ea rn 
less, are concentrated in l o w paid sectors and under-represented in managerial positions. T h e 
wage gap for comparable positions i s comparable with EU member states. Roma women and 

Bulgaria: Country Partnership Strategy

girls experience pa r t icu la r hurdles despite the increasing efforts to increase Roma women's 
l im i t e d pa r t ic ipa t ion in the labor market and economic and social l i f e in general and t o cu rb the 
early drop-out by R om a girls f r om the education system. 

13. 

Bulgaria i s on track to meet the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). After 

2000, improvements are more pronounced in school enrollments and smaller with respect t o 
health indicators. 
I t i s impo r tan t that 
improvements include gains among the mos t 
disadvantaged: gaps in access t o health care and education appear to be narrowing. But gaps in 
Bu lga r ian attendance rates in primary and secondary education rema in among the h i g h e s t in the 
ECA region. As with education, f inanc ia l constraints ( fo rma l and i n f o rm a l out-of-pocket costs) 
and differences in qua l i ty o f services accessed a re in part responsible fo r lowe r health outcomes 
among poo r and disadvantaged groups. M ino r i t ies , R om a in particular, are more likely t o f a l l 
th rough the cracks o f the education and health systems with their lowe r access compounded by 
social exclusion. Such disparities, unless addressed, w i l l increase differences in future welfare 
and result in lowe r pove r ty reduction.

111. Government Priorities and Development Challenges 

A. Government Priorities 

14. EU membership in 2007 and successful EU integration and convergence for 
improved prosperity are the key priorities o f the new Government as laid out in its political 
program and the National Strategic Reference Framework for 2007-2013.5 I t s v i s i o n fo r 

Bu lga r ia b y 2013 i s a coun t ry with a high living standard, based o n sustainable socio-economic 
g r ow t h in the process o f full integration in the EU. Acco rd ing ly , i t has ca l led i t s e l f “Government 
o f EU Integration, Econom ic G r ow t h and Social Responsibility”. 
In the economic sphere, the 
Government seeks t o promote sustainable economic g row th in the range o f 5 .5 t o 6 percent per 
year and reduce unemployment permanently b e l ow 10 percent, based o n improvements in 
p roduc t iv i ty and competitiveness th rough increased investment, innova t ion and exports, while 
ma in ta in ing a stable macroeconomic f ramewo rk with prudent pub l ic finances and f isca l 
sustainability. I t i s comm i t ted t o ma in ta in ing the currency board until Bu lga r ia j o i n s the Eu ro 
zone and envisages continued cooperation with the international f inanc ia l institutions, inc lud ing 
the W o r l d Bank. The strategic p r io r i t ies l a i d ou t in the draft N a t i o n a l Strategic Reference 
F ramewo rk (NSRF) 
f o r 2007-20 13, focus o n increased competitiveness o f the economy, 
development o f human capital, imp rovemen t o f basic infrastructure, sustainable and balanced 
reg iona l development, development o f m a l areas and agriculture, and p ro tec t ion o f the 
environment. Based o n these priorities, the Government i s preparing six Operational Programs 
(OPs) and tw o Na t iona l Strategic Plans in these p r i o r i t y areas t o fac i l i ta te future access t o EU 
f h d s (see B o x 3 for an ove rv iew o f these OPs and NSPs, and para 32 f o r details o n EU funds). 

B. Key Challenges fo r Successful EU Integration 

Bulgaria’s immediate challenge i s to meet the remaining EU requirements to enable 

15. 
membership in January 2007. As noted, Bu lga r ia w i l l have t o demonstrate s ign i f ican t progress 
over t h e com ing months in a few key r e f o rm areas t o receive a pos i t ive assessment o f the EU 
before i t makes a final decision o n Bulgaria’s readiness fo r EU membership o r consider i n v o k i n g 
the accession treaty’s safeguard clause w h i c h cou ld delay membership by a year. The k e y areas 
h igh l igh ted by the EU mon i to r ing report o f October, 2005 include: (i) foremost, accelerated 
j u d i c i a l r e f o rm to ensure a transparent, honest and e f i c i e n t jud ic ia ry ; (ii) further strengthening o f 
the ins t i tu t iona l capacity fo r programming, m o n i t o r i n g and con t ro l o f EU structural funds; and 
(iii) im p r o v i n g the readiness o f the agriculture sector, inc lud ing the structures f o r channeling o f 
EU funds f o r agriculture, the integrated adm in is t ra t ion and con t ro l system (IACS), and 
veterinary con t ro l systems. W h i l e Bu lga r ia has made progress in these last t w o areas, r e f o rm o f 
the j u d i c i a r y i s likely t o rema in a s ign i f ican t hurdle. 

/ In accordance w i t h EU guidelines, the Na t iona l Strategic Reference Framework replaces the previous Na t iona l 
Development Plan as the strategic document fo r programm ing EU funds f o r 2007-20 13.

Box 3: National Strategic Reference Framework 2007-2013- 
Directions o f Operational Programs and National Strategic Plans in Pr ior ity Areas a/ 

Improv ing Competitiveness o f the Bulgarian Economy: The ma in goal i s development o f a dynamic economy 
wh ich i s competitive in European and international markets. T h e ma in pr ior i t ies are development o f a knowledge 
based economy and innova t ion potential, development o f a favorable business environment, increased produc t iv i ty 
and f inanc ia l access by SMEs, and strengthening Bulgaria’s external market position. 
Human Resources Development: T h e objective i s to enhance the qua l i ty o f l i f e through employment, access to 
high qua l i ty education and l i fe long learning, and social inc lus ion b y (i) creation o f more and better jobs through 
enhancement o f labor force adaptability, m o b i l i t y and competitiveness; (ii) access to education and training, 
imp rov ing i t s quality, and strengthening links be tween communities and education, and (iii) social integration and 
employment through development o f the social economy. 
Transport: T h e program aims to achieve balanced and sustainable development o f the national and urban transport 
systems o f national, trans-border and European importance. T h e program aims at the full integration o f the national 
transport system in to the EU transport network, as w e l l as at improv ing the qua l i ty and safety o f transport services. 
Environment: The m a i n goal i s improvement o f t h e qua l i ty o f l i f e and favorable environment and protection o f the 
r i c h natural inheritance through sustainable environmental management. The strategic objectives o f the program are: 
(i) protection and improvement o f the cond i t ion o f water resources; (ii) improvement o f waste management and so i l 
protection; (iii) improvement o f air qua l i ty and reduction o f noise po l lu t ion , and (iv) conservation o f b iod ivers i ty 
and protection o f nature. 
Regional Development: T h e strategic goal o f the program i s to enhance the qua l i ty o f the l i v i n g and wo rk ing 
environment w i t h be t ter access and opportunities 
for increased regional competitiveness and sustainable 
development. The two program objectives are: (i) developing sustainable and dynamic urban centres connected w i t h 
their less urbanized hinterlands, thus enhancing their opportunities fo r prosperity and development, and (ii) 
mob i l iz ing ins t i tu t iona l and f inanc ia l resources fo r implementation o f regional development po l ic ies and programs. 
Agricultural and Ru ra l Development: T h e strategic objectives are: (i) development o f a competitive agriculture 
and forestry sector w i t h focus on innovations in the food-processing sector; (ii) conservation o f natural resources 
and protection o f the environment in ru ra l areas; and (iii) employment promo t ion and improvement o f t h e qua l i ty o f 
l i f e in rura l areas. 
Administrative capacity: T h i s hor izon ta l Operational Program aims at bu i ld ing a strong, effective and modern 
m b l i c administration, capable o f meeting the high expectations o f Bulgarian citizens, the business sector and the EU 
in t e rm s o f enhanced service de l ivery and high professional ethics, and e f f ic ien t and effective use o f EU funds. 

a/ Based on draft Operational Programs and National Strategic Plans prepared in the context o f the draft National Strategic 
Reference Framework, 2007-20 13. OPs cover competitiveness, human resource development, transport, environment, regional 
development, and administrative capacity. NSPs cover agriculture and rural development, and f isher ies (under preparation). 

16. 

Despite a good growth record over recent years, Bulgaria’s income gap with the EU 

remains large. Bulgaria’s pe r capita income, at PPS in 2003, was 3 1 and 56 percent o f the 
average leve l o f EU -25 and the eight EU new member states (NMS -8 ) , respectively. Given 
Bulgaria’s large income gap with the EU, im p r o v i n g the e f f ic iency o f the economy and setting i t 
on a higher g row th pa th w i l l be required to ensure that fo r thcom ing EU accession w i l l rap id ly 
na r row the gap and result in sustained improvements in living standards. 

17. 

The recent experience o f the EU-8 new member states provides important lessons 

f o r Bulgaria. First, the importance o f setting clear p r io r i t ies and unde r tak ing as m u c h r e f o rm as 
possible before accession. Po l ic ies and re fo rms should be anchored in a clear long - te rm v is ion 
and strategic national development plan f o r the country. Securing macroeconomic stability, 
s t imu la t ing the investment climate, strengthening human capital, and enhancing labo r market 
f lex ib i l i ty , are core prerequisites f o r high and sustainable growth rates. Second, an e f f ic ien t and 
technically competent p u b l i c adm in is t ra t ion i s essential t o manage r igo rous and p rope r ly 
sequenced reforms and ensure e f fec t ive de l ive ry o f p u b l i c services. Third, t h e need fo r 

10 

Bulgaria: Country Partnership Strategy 

ambitious public finance reform before accession to rationalize expenditures, focus on economic 
growth and create space for absorption o f EU f inances . The re are difficult trade-offs between the 
need for fiscal restraint and meeting demographic challenges, and additional investments needed 
especially in infrastructure and the environment. Four th , in tandem with public finance reform, 
a special focus on effective absorption o f EU funds w i l l require capacity bu i ld ing at both central 
and local levels for preparation and implementation o f needed project pipelines, based on 
prioritized sector 
investment programs w i th in a sustainable medium-term expenditure 
framework. Fifth, greater effort i s needed to address early on the issues o f poverty, social 
exclusion and regional disparities, including the need for better targeted social policies to ensure 
wider participation in growth. 

18. 

T o accelerate convergence and building on NMS-8 lessons, four major challenges 
f o r Bulgaria emerge: 

0 First, and foremost, to push ahead with the needed reforms to promote productivity 
and employment f o r sustainable high private sector led growth. T h e s e reforms are 

particularly pressing for Bulgaria, as i t has the worst demographic conditions in Europe 
with a rapidly declining working age and graying population as a resu l t o f a negative 
natural rate o f population growth (-0.7 percent per year) and out-migration (-0.1 percent 
per year). At the same time, Bulgaria’s employment rate (55.8 percent for population 
aged 15-64 years in 2004 ) i s well below the EU average and the EU’s Lisbon 
employment target o f 70 percent. Also, a large share o f the population i s in unproductive 
segmen ts o f the economy or in areas where labor productivity i s largely stagnant - 
agriculture in particular where productivity has fallen sharply. To grow, Bulgaria w i l l 
need to get the young to s tar t working ea r l ie r in productive jobs and to keep the older 
population work ing longer than i s currently the case. And Bulgaria needs to raise 
investment to upgrade i t s lagging capital stock fo l low ing years of relatively l o w 
investment. 

0 Second, to strengthen institutional capacity and public finance management f o r 
improved service delivery, fiscal sustainability and effective absorption o f EU funds. 

Over the last few years, Bulgaria has implemented a ser ies o f reforms aimed at improving 
the functioning o f t h e public sector. T h e next stage o f public administration reform w i l l 
need to focus on fu l ly implementing the new legislative framework to strengthen delivery 
o f public services, promote transparency and accountability, and root out corruption. 
Public f inance reform w i l l need to address fiscal vulnerabilities in view o f Bulgaria’s 
difficult demographic situation, and prudently adjust f i s c a l policies and build capacity to 
make room for growth-oriented public investments and effective absorption o f EU funds 
estimated at about 3.7 percent o f annual GDP during 2007-09, in support o f long-term 
growth. 

0 Third, to address poverty and social exclusion to ensure wider participation in 

growth. As mentioned, Bulgaria continues to have a large income gap w i t h the EU and 
despite overall poverty reduction deep pockets o f poverty pe rs is t . W h i l e the growth 
agenda i s expected to have a positive impact o n poverty, accompanying initiatives to 
address regional disparities, increase employment and lift the l i v i n g standards o f 

Bulgaria: Country Partnership Strategy 

11 

vulnerable groups - Roma in particular - w i l l be needed to support the pove r ty reduction 
agenda. 

And fourth, to address macroeconomic risks and vulnerabilities and maintain 
macroeconomic stability as the foundation for future growth. In the short run there 

are the p ressu res f r om the w iden ing current account de f ic i t and the r a p i d g row th o f 
p r iva te sector credit. T o date, these risks have been partly offset by prudent fiscal 
policies. L o o k i n g forward, t h e f isca l stance needs t o rema in su f f ic ien t ly flexible to 
respond to possible external shocks. 

(0 Raising productivity and employment for sustaining high private sector led growth 
The business environment needs further deregulation to reduce the costs o f doing 

19. 
business in Bulgaria. W h i l e m u c h progress has been made in recent years in reduc ing the cost 
o f do ing business, the regulatory r e f o rm agenda i s far f r om complete. In 2005 mo re than h a l f o f 
businesses report uncertainty over regulatory po l ic ies as a p rob lem o f do ing business in Bulgaria, 
and the regulatory f ramewo rk continues t o place bus inesses in Bu lga r ia at a disadvantage 
compared t o the i r regional peers. The number o f procedures t o open a bus iness i s mo re 
numerous, and Bu lga r ia has the highest minimum capital requirements in Europe as share o f per

remains mo re expensive than in other countries in the region. Contract enforcement i s ove r ly 
comp lex - i t takes 34 procedures t o enforce a contract in Bulgaria, compared t o 25 in Estonia, 21 
in Hungary, and 16 in Ireland. Cou r t ine f f ic ienc ies magn i fy the problem. E n f o r c i n g a simple

Increasing labor market performance and employment w i l l be critical f o r sustained 
growth and convergence to EU income levels. The current share o f long - te rm unemp loyed i s 

large (60 percent o f jobless are unemp loyed f o r mo re than a year) due t o competency and s k i l l s 
mismatches and l o w employability, w h i l e the share o f i n f o rm a l employment remains high. K e y 
reforms in this area include: (i) reduc ing the high p a y r o l l taxes t o decrease disincentives t o 
employment creation - a s ign i f ican t cut o f social security contributions in 2006 f r om 2 9 percent 
t o 23 percent o f the p a y r o l l already made these taxes compatible with the C E E countries; (ii)

system faces three ma jo r challenges. First, the qua l i ty and relevance o f sk i l ls i s inadequate fo r 
today’s labor market. Acco rd ing t o recent international comparative assessments (P ISA 2002 
and TIMSS 2003), there i s a decline in Bu lga r ian secondary school students’ competencies and 
s k i l l s f o r the knowledge economy b o t h in terms o f reading p ro f ic iency and mathematics and 
science achievement. This requires the establishment o f an e f fec t ive na t iona l system fo r

Imp roved 
in fo rma t ion and qua l i ty assurance, stronger l i n k s with industry, and accountability systems t o

countries and the EU L i s b o n targets, and ch i ld ren f r om l o w income f am i l i e s , ru ra l areas, and 
R om a in particular, have unacceptably l o w pa r t ic ipa t ion rates. Targeted interventions w i l l be 
needed t o inc lude t h e hard-to-reach groups. At tertiary level, p r iva te p rov is ion and finance 
should p lay a larger r o l e in ra is ing participation. Third, mo re e f f ic ien t resource use i s needed in 
v i ew o f the con t inu ing reduc t ion in school-age population. Down -s iz ing school infrastructure 
and s ta f f ing t o reallocate resources w i l l require p o l i t i c a l w i l l t o adopt and imp lemen t the long - 
t e r m Program fo r Deve lopmen t o f School Education (2006-201 5), strong communication and 
incentives. L o w student-teacher ratios and the large number o f sma l l ins t i tu t ions pose s im i la r 
challenges in higher education. 

The poor state o f transport infrastructure i s a major bottleneck f o r trade 

22. 
integration and competitiveness. Due t o inadequate investment, the existing transport ne two rk 
i s in poo r shape - an estimated 60 percent o f the road ne two rk i s in fa i r o r poo r cond i t ion and 
needs urgent rehab i l i ta t ion and maintenance; ra i lways a re in a s im i la r poo r cond i t ion with l o w 
s ta f f p roduc t iv i ty and high track access charges; and p o r t e f f ic iency i s l ow . Comb ined with an 
ine f f ic ien t trade fac i l i ta t ion system, this results in high transport costs f o r Bulgarian exports and 
impo r ts and transit trade, and limits Bulgaria’s external competitiveness. 
Bu lga r ia has 
comm i t ted to comp le t ing t h e upgrade o f i t s ma in road ne two rk t o EU standards by 2014, and has 
also proposed a mo tonvay construction p rog ram that requires s ign i f ican t investment. EU funds 
fo r transport infrastructure estimated at €1.2 b i l l i o n f r om 2007-13 (0.6 percent o f GDP per year) 
p rov ide an opportunity, but w i l l require development o f a p r io r i t ized road investment program 
that f i t s within government’s med ium - te rm expenditure framework. 
In parallel, r e f o rm o f 
ma r i t ime ports i s needed with separation o f operational and comme rc ia l functions, p r iva t iza t ion 
o f p o r t services, and concessioning o f terminals t o p r iva te operators. 
In addition, the sector 
needs imp roved trade fac i l i ta t ion at border crossings. 

23. 

Reform o f the energy sector has advanced, but energy efficiency remains weak and 
sector restructuring and market opening need to be completed. S ign i f ican t advances have 

been made in mee t ing sector EU accession needs, especially in sector leg is la t ion and regu la t ion 
and in reducing p r ice distortions. But sector restructuring and ma rke t opening have been delayed 
w h i c h may hinder Bulgaria’s in teg ra t ion i n t o the European energy ma rke t and limits the benefits 
from regional ma rke t l ibe ra l iza t ion . The un f in ished sector agenda includes: accelerating the 
l ibe ra l iza t ion o f b o t h e lec t r ic i ty and gas markets; comp le t ing the restructuring o f the Na t iona l 
E lec t r ic i ty Company (NEK) t o stimulate compe t i t ion in the wholesale market; opening o f the 
natural gas market th rough restructuring o f Bulgargas; p romo t ing energy e f f ic iency in view o f 
Bulgaria’s high energy in tens i ty w h i c h i s mo re than tw ice EU average; and p romo t ing renewable 
energy sources in l i n e with the EU directives w h i c h set a target o f renewable sources mee t ing 12 
percent o f to ta l energy consumption by 201 0. 

Agriculture remains largely underdeveloped with low productivity. In contrast t o the 

24. 
NMS-8 countries, t h e share o f agriculture in employment rose f i o m 18.5 t o 25.5 percent f r om 
1990-2003. At the same time, agriculture’s share in GDP f e l l f r om 18 t o 11 percent. As a result, 
sector p roduc t iv i ty f e l I sharply. W h i l e past po l ic ies have successfully focused o n market 
stabilization and liberalization, the supp ly response has been weak in v i ew o f a fragmentation o f

ac t iv i ty and r u r a l infrastructure. The two ma jo r challenges fo r the sector invo lve : (i) adopting an 
ag r icu l tu ra l p o l i c y and ins t i tu t iona l framework compatible with the EU’s Common Ag r icu l tu ra l 
Po l icy (CAP); and (ii) the implementation o f po l ic ies and programs t o enhance sector investment 
and competitiveness. The former w i l l invo lve a t rade -o f f between direct income support

investments, and d ive rs i f ica t ion to o f f - fa rm activities. 

Improving governance and strengthening institutions 

(ii) 
25. 
Bulgaria’s institutional development and implementation capacity w i l l be central to 
growth prospects but need to catch up with EU standards. The importance o f ins t i tu t ions 

and governance t o g r ow t h and economic development has l o n g been recognized. The process o f 
EU accession has contributed ma rked ly to the ins t i tu t iona l f ramewo rk in Bulgaria. Y e t in 2004, 
selected governance indicators fo r Bu lga r ia were lowe r than fo r the EU - 8 (see F igu re 3). The 
agenda invo lves further strengthening o f pub l ic adm in is t ra t ion capacity, im p r o v i n g t h e qua l i ty o f 
service delivery, reduc ing corruption, strengthening accountability and transparency, and, 
importantly, increasing the e f f ic iency and effectiveness o f the j u d i c i a l system. Together with the 
need fo r j u d i c i a l reform, co r rup t ion remains a concern despite adoption o f legislative acts, 
strategies and ac t ion plans to address the p rob lem (see Box 4). Imp roved capacity in b o t h central 
and loca l l e v e l s also w i l l be c r i t ica l f o r e f fec t ive absorption o f the post-accession EU funds. 

26. Moving towards a transparent, honest and efficient judiciary i s one o f the key 
requirements f o r improving the business environment and meeting EU accession 

requirements. Despite progress over the last years, j u d i c i a l r e f o rm remains one o f the serious 
challenges 
in im p r o v i n g Bulgaria’s 
ins t i tu t iona l f ramewo rk and i t s readiness f o r EU 
membership. P reva i l ing pub l ic perception i s that magistrates a re subject to undue in f luence f r om 
parties and the i r attorneys, other magistrates, and government o f f ic ia ls . Enforcement o f c iv i l 
judgments continues t o be a ma jo r issue . As mentioned, procedures fo r contract enforcement are 
s ign i f ican t ly mo re comp lex than other countries. E f f ic iency o f Bulgarian courts i s low , and 
business perceives courts as slow. T h e r e i s limited use o f ou t o f cou r t settlement, n o specialized 
commercial courts, and extensive opportunities f o r debtors t o appeal and delay the process. 
F ina l ly , the comp lex i ty and e f f ic iency o f the pena l structures has been h igh l igh ted by the EU as 
one o f the m a j o r shortcomings in the j u d i c i a l system. Key re fo rms and actions focus o n 
imp lemen ta t ion o f already enacted changes, pa r t icu la r ly in the areas o f anti-corruption, 
im p r o v i n g court organization, and reducing cou r t delays; s ign i f ican t improvements in the 
func t ion ing o f courts; speeding up reso lu t ion o f comme rc ia l disputes; adoption o f a new Penal 
Procedural Code; and establishment o f specialized adm in is t ra t ive courts.

27. While there have been significant reforms in Bulgaria's fiduciary systems, 
implementation continues to lag in key areas. The Bank's diagnostic wo rk , such as the 

Coun t ry F inanc ia l Accoun tab i l i ty Assessment (CFAA), Coun t ry Procurement Assessment 
Report (CPAR) and Pub l ic Expenditure and Ins t i tu t iona l Review (PEIR), has shown 
considerable progress in Bulgaria 's 
f iduc ia ry environment but also po in ted at rema in ing 
weaknesses and r i s k (with C P AR 2004 ra t ing procurement as a high risk and C F A A ra t ing 
f inanc ia l management as average risk). The C F A A h igh l igh ted strong features in several aspects 
o f the Pub l ic F inanc ia l Management (PFM) environment, such as a w e l l func t ion ing automated 
treasury system, sound pub l ic in te rna l f inanc ia l con t ro l framework, and independent external 
audit. Moreover, Bu lga r ia has developed a sound lega l f ramewo rk fo r p u b l i c procurement and 
has made progress in the imp lemen ta t ion o f the CPAR ac t ion plan. No tw i ths tand ing this 
progress, the Government w i l l need t o continue the r e f o rm process by deepening c i v i l service 
reforms, strengthening accountability o f the administrative j u d i c i a r y system, strengthening 
management o f capital expenditures and p rog ram budgeting, and imp lemen ta t ion o f procurement 
reforms beyond the regulatory f ramewo rk . The EU and the Bank w i l l continue t o support t h e 
government th rough further ana ly t ica l w o r k and TA f o r strengthening f inanc ia l management and

Surveys and assessments b y national and international organizations con f i rm that corruption remains a cause fo r 
concern in Bu lgar ia and affects many aspects o f society. T h e EU has highlighted corrup t ion as one o f the key 
prob lem areas as Bu lgar ia prepares fo r EU accession in 2007. There has been a pos i t ive trend as far as 
administrative corrup t ion i s concerned, although recent s u r v e y s show a slight deterioration between 2004-05. 
Transparency International’s 2005 corruption perception index ranks Bu lgar ia in 55” place among 159 countries. T I 
had shown steady improvements for Bu lgar ia between 1998-2002 w i t h a leve l ing o f f thereafter. T h e EBRD -W o r l d 
Bank Business Env ironmen t and Enterprise Performance Survey (BEEPS) o n t h e other hand shows a marked 
decline in corrup t ion as a prob lem o f doing business in Bu lgar ia f rom 2002-05, even though the so-called bribe tax 
(bribes as a share o f sales) remains comparatively high (see below). As m a i n areas for uno f f ic ia l payments b y f i rm s , 
BEEPS shows ob ta in ing government contracts, obtaining business licenses and permits, dealing w i t h customs, and

Wh i le the European Commission’s 2005 Comprehensive monitoring report (CMR) on Bu lga r ia identified an overa l l 
improvement in administrative corruption, i t highlighted Bulgaria’s weak enforcement record w i t h very limited 
results in the investigation and prosecution o f high leve l corrup t ion cases. Pub l ic works contracting, inc lud ing t h e 
health sector, was c i ted as par t icu lar ly vulnerable to corruption. The EU acknowledges the considerable 
administrative efforts by the Government in implementing i t s Na t iona l Strategy fo r Combating Corrup t ion combined 
w i t h an updated action p lan implemented b y the Commission f o r the Coord ina t ion o f the Fight Against Corruption, 
but notes that i t s capacity remains weak and action plan implementation delayed. 
The 2006 Corrupt ion Assessment Report prepared b y Bulgaria’s Center fo r t h e Study o f Democracy (CSD) 
attributes the observed increase in corrup t ion transactions in 2005 fo l low ing the gradual dec l ine during 1998-2004 t o 
t h e impact o f the electoral cycle. T h e report shows that Bu lgar ian pub l ic perceptions o f corrup t ion are widespread 
and reflect a l ow l e v e l o f t r u s t in state institutions. A f ter low incomes and unemployment, corruption i s t h e third 
ranked concern in 2005. W i t h a reduction in administrative corruption, p o l i t i c a l corruption - state capture and 
po l i t ica l ly connected business - i s ga in ing attention as it shifts f r om pr iva t iza t ion and i l lega l t ra f f ick ing t o the 
spheres o f pub l ic procurement, concessions and the use o f EU funds. The repor t argues that the potential o f ‘‘soft” 
measures against corruption (e.g. awareness campaigns, tra in ing c i v i l servants, codes o f ethics) i s being exhausted 
and that more effective po l i t ica l and ins t i tu t iona l mechanisms need to be put in place. 
The government has responded by developing and implementing i t s anti-corruption strategy and related action plans, 
mov ing towards a merit-based and depo l i t ic ized c i v i l service, in troduc ing legal provisions fo r con f l ic t o f interest, 
asset declarations, and freedom o f in forma t ion regulations, and starting re fo rm o f t h e jud ic iary , inc lud ing improved 
accountability and more transparent and merit-based appointment o f judges. M o r e recently, Parliament adopted a 
new Penal Procedural Code, and t h e Counc i l o f M in is ters approved an amendment o f the L aw on Judiciary to 
introduce mandatory compe t i t ion in the appointment o f magistrates. W i t h the legislative and ins t i tu t iona l 
foundations for anti-corruption mos t ly in place, implementation and enforcement i s n ow the ma in challenge.

28. With regard to corporate financial reporting, Bulgaria has worked towards meeting 
compliance with EU standards. The Bank’s Accoun t ing and Auditing Report o n the 

Observance o f Standards and Codes (ROSC) o f end-2002 concluded that Bulgaria’s leg is la t ion i s 
largely in l i n e with the EU acquis communautaire, but that shortcomings rema in in 
imp lemen ta t ion and enforcement o f t h e acquis, International F inanc ia l Repo r t ing Standards, and 
In te rna t iona l Standards o n Auditing. Since then, Bulgarian stakeholders have wo rked o n 
enhancing imp lemen ta t ion w h i c h has been challenging g iven the s ign i f ican t changes t o the 
acquis f o l l ow i n g Europe’s response t o recent accounting scandals. In support o f t h i s effort, the 
Bank p rov ided TA t o the Na t iona l Accoun t ing Counc i l in developing a comprehensive Coun t ry 
A c t i o n Plan f o l l ow i n g the ROSC, and has continued t o p rov ide assistance th rough a reg iona l TA 
program. 

(iii) Strengthening fwcal sustainability and absorption of EU funds 

29. With about 40 percent of the economy’s resources in the public sector, improving 
the efficiency and effectiveness of public expenditures i s central to Bulgaria’s growth 

prospects. In addition, Bu lga r ia has a unique oppo r tun i ty in putting fo r thcom ing EU funds, 
estimated at an average 3.7 percent o f annual GDP during 2007-09, t o best use in support o f 
long - te rm g row th . T o make r o om f o r growth-oriented p u b l i c investments and e f fec t ive 
absorption o f EU funds, and contain spending in the face o f a d i f f i c u l t demographic situation, 
Bu lga r ia w i l l need to contain and imp rove e f f ic iency o f spending o n the hea l th care system, 
pensions, and the social assistance system. R e f o rm in these areas should be d r iven by im p r o v i n g 
the qua l i ty o f services while increasing the e f f ic iency o f expenditures and their f isca l 
sustainability. In addition, e f fec t ive absorption o f EU funds w i l l require urgent development o f 
p ro jec t pipelines t o meet the high investment needs based o n p r io r i t ized investment programs in 
key sectors (transport, mun ic ipa l services, and environment). T h i s w i l l need t o be accompanied 
by capacity building at central and l o c a l levels. 

The health sector needs cost containment f o r financial sustainability, while at the 

30. 
same time improved quality and access. Eight yea rs after in t roduc t ion o f t h e mandatory hea l th 
insurance system, hea l th outcomes are beg inn ing t o reverse f r om the negative trends in the 
1990s. Ye t the reforms rema in unfinished, and Bulgaria’s demographic and ep idem io log ica l 
profile w i l l generate additional pressures o n hea l th spending. The t w o most s ign i f ican t problems 
are: (i) s low progress in im p r o v i n g e f f ic iency and cost containment w h i l e at t h e same time 
securing qua l i ty care; and (ii) inequa l i ty in access due t o lack o f alternatives fo r those w h o 
cannot pay fo r services. F inanc ia l sustainability o f the system i s threatened by a comb ina t ion o f 
poo r mon i to r ing o f t h e payment system fo r inpa t ien t care, the oversized hosp i ta l infrastructure, 
and high pharmaceutical spending. The focus o f care w i l l need to sh i f t f r om hosp i ta l iza t ion and 
curative care towards p reven t ion and outpatient care. Pharmaceutical spending needs t o be 
contained th rough regu la t ion in prices and volumes. And conso l ida t ion in hospitals w i l l requ i re 
the imp lemen ta t ion o f the hosp i ta l restructuring strategy developed in 2002. The EU as part o f 
i t s recent mon i to r ing report has also raised concerns about access t o the system, and equ i ty 
considerations w i l l have to be part o f any discussion o n res to r ing f inanc ia l balance t o the system. 

31. 
The challenges of the social security system. Desp i te substantial re fo rms since 1999 
when Bu lga r ia m o v e d t o a three-pillar pens ion system, i t s social security system i s n o t a l igned 
with the adverse demographic trends. As a result, p a y r o l l taxes are high and p rov ide incentives 
fo r i n f o rm a l w o r k as well as under-reporting o f income, b o t h o f w h i c h lead t o even h ighe r 

Bulgaria: Country Partnership StrategV

dependency ratios. The pub l ic pension pillar has needed budget transfers in the order o f three 
percent o f GDP in recent years. This i s exacerbated by the r i s e in d isab i l i ty pensions w h i c h has 
been prone to abuse and has further deteriorated dependency ratios. The dua l challenges o f the 
pension system invo lve : (i) reduc ing p a y r o l l taxes to boost employment w h i l e im p r o v i n g the 
system’s f inanc ia l sustainability; and (ii) reconc i l ing wide-spread non-compliance with long - 
te rm negative we l fa re considerations o f exclusion. The r e f o rm pa th has been t o contain f inanc ia l 
imbalances by increasing retirement ages and tightening the c r i te r ia f o r access t o the system. 
Add i t iona l reforms should inc lude s t r ic t discipline in the use o f d isab i l i ty pensions and the 
co l lec t ion o f contributions, increasing the link between bene f i ts and con t r ibu t ions t o the system 
by further re fo rms t o the funded pension system. The pension system w i l l need t o have a basic 
pension t o keep some segments o f the o l d age popu la t ion out o f poverty. Given the f inanc ia l and 
p o l i c y challenges involved, detailed w o r k i s needed t o assess the feas ib i l i ty o f alternative 
reforms. 

32. 
Effective absorption o f EU funds will require further public expenditure 
restructuring and capacity building. With k t u r e EU accession, the EU has comm i t ted about 

€4.6 b i l l i o n o f EU grant funds t o Bu lga r ia over the pe r iod 2007-09. The bulk o f these funds are 
expected t o go 
to 
imp lemen ta t ion o f the European common ag r icu l tu ra l p o l i c y and 
environmental standards, upg rad ing o f roads and other infrastructure, and support human 
resource development (see Table I). The ove ra l l f inanc ia l effect o f expected EU funds i s 
projected t o be highly positive o n Bulgaria, about 3.7 percent o f annual GD P o n average during 
2007-2009 if t h e coun t ry takes a l l available funds. At the same time, however, Bulgaria’s f isca l 
pos i t ion w o u l d deteriorate by about t w o percent o f GDP during the period, i f the government 
absorbed a l l available funds and there was n o restructuring o f the f isca l f ramewo rk . Since the 
Government intends t o keep p u b l i c expenditures at their current l e v e l o f 40 percent o f GDP or 
below, f isca l adjustment equivalent t o the projected impac t o f EU funds (about two percentage 
po in ts o f GDP) w i l l be required. 

33. 
At the same time, Bulgaria’s performance on absorption o f EU pre-accession funds 
has been below potential and will require development o f needed capacity to prepare and 
implement high return investments which can support future growth and improve service 

delivery. There i s a l o n g lead t im e in p ro jec t preparation and the readiness for imp lemen ta t ion 
o f some projects i s no t ve ry high, w h i c h leads t o delays in contracting and subsequently in 
disbursement o f pre-accession funds. Fo r example, under the I S P A instrument f o r transport and 
environment investment support o n l y 25 percent had been contracted by the end o f 2005 while 
actual disbursement levels are substantially lowe r . At t h e same time, experience f i o m EU-8 
countries indicates that, i f e f fec t ive ly used, the EU funds can contribute t o economic g row th b o t h 
in the short and l o n g run. In the short run they w i l l increase domestic demand. In the l o n g run, 
if invested in the improvement o f the phys ica l and human cap i ta l with high economic returns, 
they have the po ten t ia l o f making an impo r tan t con t r ibu t ion t o economic g r ow t h th rough the 
supply side. But experience also shows that, i f bad ly used, these resources m a y have o n l y a 
short-term pos i t ive demand effect o n the economy, and in the l o n g te rm lead t o rea l appreciation 
o f the loca l currency and reduced competitiveness, a i d dependency, and unde rm ine the e f fo r ts t o 
imp rove governance. E f fec t ive use o f these funds therefore w i l l requ i re building the needed 
capacity f o r ca re fu l advance planning and development o f a pipeline o f high re tu rn projects in 
the areas e l ig ib le fo r EU funds.

IV . Past World Bank Group Assistance and Lessons Learned 

From 1990, the Bank has actively supported Bulgaria’s transition. D u r i n g the 1990s, 

37. 
Bank support was focused o n Bulgaria’s t rans i t ion f i o m a highly centralized socialist state to 
building the foundations o f a market economy and a stable macroeconomic framework. Th is 
was on ly partly successful as witnessed by the severe 1996-97 economic crisis. F r om 1998 on, 
Bank support was associated with the structural and ins t i tu t iona l re fo rms started by the post- 
crisis Government, w h i c h fo rmed the basis fo r Bu lga r ia recent strong g r ow t h record. Bank focus 
i n i t i a l l y moved t o r e f o rm o f the f inanc ia l and enterprise sector, agriculture, social security, and 
environmental protection, 
th rough a series o f sector adjustment 
loans accompanied by 
investment lending. The previous C A S w h i c h covered FY03 -05 broadened Bank support t o the 
reforms and the EU accession process th rough a series o f three multi-pillar P A L S together with a 
number o f investment p ro jec ts and AAA. As o f today, to ta l lend ing t o Bu lga r ia amounts t o 
US$2.1 b i l l i o n equivalent, o f w h i c h 64 percent in adjustment lending. 

20

38. 
Implementation o f the ambitious three-year PAL program has been successful, 
although an unfinished reform agenda remains. The three P A L s fo r a to ta l o f US$425 
m i l l i o n during FY03 -05 supported the Government’s comprehensive program, organized around 
f i v e complementary and mu tua l ly re in fo rc ing pillars: (i) sustaining structural re fo rms in t h e 
enterprise sector, with emphasis o n infrastructure; (ii) establishing a ma rke t - f r iend ly business 
environment; (iii) deepening the f inanc ia l system; (iv) im p r o v i n g pub l ic sector governance; and 
(v) inves t ing in human capital and strengthening social protection. By the end o f the program, 
t w o o f the three broader country outcomes t o w h i c h the P A L program was expected t o contribute 
had been surpassed and 28 o f the o r ig ina l 31 p rog ram triggers fulfilled. GDP g r ow t h averaged 
5.2 percent during 2002-05 compared with the ove ra l l PAL country goal o f 4.5-5.0 percent, and 
unemp loymen t at 10.7 percent by end-2005 was well b e l ow the Government’s goal o f 12-14 
percent. The coun t ry goal to halve pove r ty during 2002-05 has been more elusive, though 
pove r ty ce r ta in ly declined during the pe r ioda6 The Government’s strong ownership o f the P A L 
agenda and i t s e f fec t ive mon i to r ing and evaluation capacity were key success factors. Despite 
the impressive progress o n the ove ra l l PAL agenda, some o f the reforms in the human 
development area p roved mo re challenging than o r ig ina l ly foreseen - education and health care 
r e f o rm in pa r t icu la r - and have been h igh l igh ted by the Government as needing continued 
attention with B a n k assistance. The l ow e r unemployment rate also masks Bulgaria’s l o w labo r 
force pa r t ic ipa t ion rate, w h i c h has become a core challenge to sustaining growth. 

39. 

At the same time, fewer investment projects than had been foreseen in the CAS 
moved forward. The C A S program inc luded a p ipe l ine o f seven investment loans to ta l ing 
US$300 m i l l i o n o f w h i c h just th ree were approved f o r a to ta l o f U S $ l l S . 4 m i l l i o n (district 
heating, social investment and employment, and revenue administration reform). 
In addition, 
fou r G E F P C F grant investment projects were approved fo r a to ta l o f US$17.0 m i l l i o n . The 
reasons f o r n o t pursuing the rema in ing IBRD p ro jec ts included: (i) Government’s conservative 
debt management w h i c h restricted external b o r r ow i n g f o r a l l investment projects while leav ing 
f isca l space f o r a few p o l i t i c a l l y important projects (e.g. B e l e n e nuclear plant); (ii) comp lex i ty o f 
underlying sector reforms (forestry); and (iii) fa i lu re o f a precursor p ro jec t (education APL2 ) . 
Ac tua l C A S lend ing amounted t o US$543.4 m i l l i o n (73 percent o f the US$750 m i l l i o n C A S 
lend ing target), o f w h i c h 78 percent fo r the fast disbursing PALs . 

40. 
Performance o f the investment lending portfolio picked up following concerted 
efforts to address key issues and accelerate implementation. Despite the Bank’s close 
p o r t f o l i o mon i to r ing efforts, o n average one o r t w o projects o f the to ta l eight t o ten investment 
projects in the p o r t f o l i o during the CAS pe r iod was show ing problems with imp lemen ta t ion 
and/or achievement o f development objectives. A numbe r o f projects showed considerable 
delays and the ove ra l l p o r t f o l i o disbursement ra t io f e l l t o 9.7 percent in FY 0 4 . At the same time, 
other projects pe r fo rmed well and have had impo r tan t impacts o n ins t i tu t ion building and 
re fo rms (e.g. revenue administration reform, trade and transport facilitation, c h i l d welfare 
reform, d is t r ic t heating). The semi-annual j o i n t p o r t f o l i o reviews (JPRs) with Government 
flagged project-specific as well as cross-cutting imp lemen ta t ion issues, inc lud ing s low and 
insu f f ic ien t delegation o f decision making, and weak capacity and d iscon t inu i ty in p ro jec t 

/ Comparable pover ty data over the PAL pe r iod i s no t available, and different approximations g ive different 
resu l ts . An econometric study (Tesliuc 2004) finds that the f a l l in pover ty be tween 2001-03 was a l i t t l e more than 
tw o percentage points ( f rom 24 percent to 2 1.9 percent), and thus the PAL goal no t likely to have been met. But 
simulations using growth-poverty elasticities find that the target o f h a l v i n g pover ty m a y have been possible.

management and procurement. Subsequently, a focused review o f projects at r i s k l e d t o specific 
recommendations fo r p ro jec t restructuring and speeding up implementation. As a r e s u l t o f close 
j o i n t fo l low -up , mos t projects demonstrated imp roved performance and some even managed t o 
catch up with earlier delays. S ign i f ican t ly , the average disbursement ra t io nea r ly t r ip led in one 
year to reach 27.9 percent by end-FYOS. 

41. 
The Government has generally valued the Bank’s AAA wo r k and QAG’s 
assessment found the quality o f the CAS AAA program to be satisfactory. The AAA 

p rog ram was built around a set o f core p o l i c y pieces (Public Expenditure and Ins t i tu t iona l 
Review, CEM , fiscal decentralization), diagnostic and f iduc ia ry reports (FSAP, CPAR, CFAA , 
accounting & aud i t ing ROSC) and a number o f high impact sectoral reports, p o l i c y notes and 
workshops (energy, r u r a l development, water and waste water, 
roads and mo to r ways 
investments reviews, infrastructure strategy review). The M i n i s t r y o f Finance also appreciated 
the debt management TA p rov ided by the Bank’s Treasury Department, w h i c h tu rned in to a fee- 
based arrangement in 2003. Q A G judged t h e program’s strategic relevance, in te rna l quality, and 
likely impac t as satisfactory. As areas fo r improvement i t unde r l ined the importance o f c l ien t 
ownership, integration across AAA activities, and dissemination and dialogue with non -o f f ic ia l 
stakeholders to enhance ove ra l l impact. 

42. 

IFC has been active in the corporate and financial sector. A s o f M a r c h 2006, IFC has 

15 projects in i t s Bu lga r ia p o r t f o l i o with to ta l comm i tmen t o f US$267 m i l l i o n f o r i t s o w n 
account and an additional US$75 m i l l i o n syndicated with partner banks. Projects in the 
manu fac tu r ing and services sectors represent about 80 percent o f IFC’s coun t ry po r t fo l io , with 
investments in a number o f key projects in electronics assembly, w o o d panel and board 
production, post-privatization restructuring o f a steel mill, tw o m a j o r glass processing plants, a 
re ta i l start-up operation, and a first-class hotel. 
In the f inanc ia l sector, I F C supported two 
specialized SM E banks, established Bulgaria’s f i rs t m ic ro - lend ing bank, supported country’s 
largest bank, and invested in a venture capital fund that also targets the S M E sector. T o support 
the design o f a compe t i t ive wholesale energy market in Bu lga r ia , I F C p rov ided technical 
assistance t o the Ministry o f Economy and Energy and t o the N a t i o n a l E lec t r ic i ty Company 

(NEK). 
43. MIGA’s outstanding guarantee portfolio in Bulgaria consists o f four contracts in the 
infrastructure sector and one contract in the manufacturing sector. As o f end-March 2006, 

MIGA’s gross exposure in Bu lga r ia i s US$391 m i l l i o n (7.0 percent o f t h e Agency’s gross 
exposure), while the exposure ne t o f reinsurance amounts to US$140 m i l l i o n (4.2 percent o f 
MIFA’s n e t exposure). A b o u t 83 percent o f MIGA’s net exposure in Bu lga r ia i s in the 
infkastructure sector and the balance in manufacturing. 
In the infrastructure sector, M I G A ’ s 
coverage includes the M a r i t z a East 3 and the M a r i t z a East 1 powe r plants. 

44. A number o f lessons emerge from the implementation of the previous CAS, with 
implications for the design and implementation of the CPS. F i rs t , the Bank should move 

towards a partnership approach with a we l l -pe r fo rm ing M I C c l ien t such as Bulgaria, with 
demand-orientation in design and de l ive ry o f assistance and f l e x i b i l i t y in adjusting the Bank’s 
p rog ram t o the client’s needs. Second, the Bank should engage in n e w investment lending o n l y 
i f i t has strong client demand and meets i t s expectations o f s imp le r designs, shorter preparation 
and implementation periods, enhanced f lex ib i l i ty , reduced reliance o n freestanding PIUs, and 
increased leverage o f other resources, inc lud ing EU grant funds. Third, swift ac t ion i s needed t o

address p o r t f o l i o imp lemen ta t ion issues as they arise. This w i l l require t ime ly Government 
action and f o l l ow - u p o f p rob lem areas, coupled with proactive p ro jec t supervision o n the Bank 
s ide t o turn around and restructure poo r ly pe r fo rm ing projects. Fou r th , Bulgaria’s un f in ished 
human development agenda remaining f r om the P A L se r ies w i l l need to be addressed to make up 
fo r delays and t o support Bulgaria’s g row th agenda and readiness f o r EU accession. Reforms in 
education, healthcare and 
labor markets are u rgen t ly needed 
t o 
increase Bulgaria’s 
competitiveness and broaden pa r t ic ipa t ion in the country’s growth. B o t h p o l i t i c a l w i l l and pub l ic 
attitude make these reforms n o w more feasible. A k e y outcome should be an increase in the 
labor force pa r t ic ipa t ion rate w h i c h remains l o w by international standards. Fifth, effective 
Government coo rd ina t ion and M&E systems are c r i t ica l fo r successful implementation o f 
reforms and Bank support. The successful P A L coo rd ina t ion arrangements linked t o a 
comprehensive M&E system implemented with strong c l ien t support, was one o f i t s key success 
factors. And sixth, p o l i t i c a l economy aspects need wa tch ing in the design and implementatian o f 
the ove ra l l CPS p rog ram and reforms supported by the Bank. The examples o f the fa i led 
p r iva t iza t ion o f Bulgartabak (PAL2 conditionality) and stalled forestry 
reforms w h i c h 
underpinned the dropped forestry p ro jec t come to mind.

The new Government has requested a continued full-service, yet focused, assistance 
program w ith the Bank over the coming years o f EU accession and integration. In the 

consultations held with the Government last Novembe r and December, i t has expressed a 
preference fo r a continued relationship with Bank i n v o l v i n g b o t h f inanc ia l and non - f inanc ia l 
assistance focused o n h e l p i n g Bu lga r ia achieve a successful in teg ra t ion with the EU. Am o n g t h e 
various options discussed, rang ing f r om a fee-based know ledge sharing relationship t o a full- 
service assistance program, i t s preference i s fo r the latter - i n c l u d i n g a lend ing p rog ram up t o 
US$300 m i l l i o n per year. At the same time, i t has requested the Bank’s i n i t i a l lend ing focus f o r 
the com ing years o n selected p r io r i t ies linked t o the un f in ished re fo rms in the Human 
Development (HD) sector and to infrastructure investment support, with a special focus o n 
effective absorption o f EU funds. 

The Government recognizes the Bank’s value added and comparative advantage 
v i s - h i s Bulgaria’s other development partners, which also draws on the lessons from the 

46. 
EU-8 countries. Bu lga r ia has access t o extensive external assistance - b o t h f inanc ia l and non - 
financial. Foremost th is includes support f r om the EU in the con tex t o f accession, as well as the 
IMF, EBRD, EIB, UNDP and various active bilaterals (see pa ra 65 f o r the focus o f various 
external partners in supporting Bulgaria’s development challenges). The Bank’s value added 
and comparative advantage i s seen in i ts expe r t ise and assistance in th ree d is t inc t areas: (i) 
design, capacity building and imp lemen ta t ion support fo r s truc tura l and institutional reforms 
that promote g row th and p roduc t iv i ty , facilitate EU convergence and social inclusion, and cover 
areas n o t addressed by the EU such as health and education po l ic ies and reform; (ii) design and

j n a n c i n g of funds w i th EU and other IFIs, and p repa ra t ion of pro ject p ipe l ines to absorb 
ava i lab le funds. The Bank’s strengths a re seen in developing systemic, rather than one-off, 
solutions, and in sharing lessons f r om g loba l and EU/EU-8 experience. Recogn i t ion o f the 
Bank’s r o l e in these areas builds o n the imp lemen ta t ion o f the PAL program, the ins t i tu t ion 
building efforts in investment projects, and appreciation o f the Bank’s analytical and advisory 
wo rk . 

47. 

At the same time, the Bank i s adjusting its business model in Bulgaria to remain 

relevant in its current environment. Bu lga r ia today i s a d i f fe ren t country f r om j u s t fou r years 
ago at the start o f the last CAS. I t has established a strong reco rd o f r e f o rm and sustained 
growth, built o n prudent macroeconomic policies. Based o n these achievements, Bu lga r ia i s n o w 
o n the threshold o f EU accession. And i t established investment grade status with access t o 
capital markets. 
In th is new environment, the Bank i s continued t o be seen as relevant - 
inc lud ing a recogn i t ion that Bank f inanc ia l products and i n s t r um e n t s have evo lved and rema in 
compe t i t ive with Bulgaria’s alternative f inanc ing sources. T h e CPS aims t o re f lec t these new 
realities. 

48. 
Accordingly, Bank support will move towards greater flexibility within a strategic 
framework that reflects Bulgaria’s priorities, also building o n the Bank’s agenda f o r well- 

performing M ICs . The new partnership w i l l p rov ide greater f l e x i b i l i t y than the previous CAS 
approach, and a l l ow fo r adjustment in the Bank’s assistance p rog ram based o n the evo lv ing 
p r io r i t ies o f the client. W h i l e responsive and flexible, Bank assistance w i l l be anchored in a 
strategic f ramewo rk that builds o n Bulgaria’s development p r io r i t ies and o n the Bank’s 
comparative advantage in Bulgaria. Acco rd ing ly , the evo lu t ion f r om the previous C A S t o the 
new CPS w i l l invo lve : (i) a more f lex ib le approach t o defining lending and non-lending activities 
within a set o f broad p r io r i t ies f o r the CPS pe r iod with an agreed p rog ram f o r FY 0 7 and an

B. 

Implications o f Client Survey Feedback f o r the CPS’ 

49. Most respondents o f the survey felt that the Bank should focus on economic growth 
and jobs, followed by infrastructure development, education, poverty reduction, and health 

sector issues. They ranked the Bank’s invo lvemen t in these areas higher than in EU integration, 
even though effective EU in teg ra t ion was v iewed by stakeholders as Bulgaria’s ove r r id ing 
development p r io r i ty . The feedback po in ts t o a preference f o r the Bank’s invo lvemen t in basic 

/ Annua l consultations are proposed to take place b y December each year to precede the Government’s budget 
formulation process for Bulgaria’s subsequent f isca l year (e.g. the December 2006 consultations wou ld focus on 
Bank activities in Government FYO8 which coincides w i th calendar year 2008). 
* / The survey included a quantitative survey invo lv ing 300 responding stakeholders, in-depth interviews w i th 32

(economic reform, education, health and infrastructure).

development issues. At the same time, i t was f e l t that the Bank should ta i lo r i t s approach to 
Bulgaria’s EU in teg ra t ion needs. The Bank’s financial resources were seen as the Bank’s 
greatest value, f o l l ow e d by i ts p o l i c y and economic advice and a b i l i t y t o build implementation 
capacity. As weaknesses respondents c i ted the Bank’s perceived disregard o f coun t ry realities in 
proposing solutions and the bureaucratic nature o f operational po l ic ies and procedures. At the 
same time, impressions o f Bank effectiveness did no t always ma tch impo r tan t areas highlighted 
fo r i t s f b t u r e attention. The survey showed higher effectiveness gaps in areas such as health and 
education. These impressions m a y be l i n k e d t o the well pub l ic ized past imp lemen ta t ion problems 
o f investment projects in these areas - education in particular. 

50. 

The qualitative survey respondents emphasized the importance of the Bank’s 
involvement beyond EU accession and identified a number of recommendations for 
enhancing the Bank’s relevance in the future. These inc luded an enhanced partnership 

approach and dialogue that builds o n Government priorities; Bank support in the p r i o r i t y areas o f 
education, healthcare, 
infrastructure 
investments, and strengthening o f ins t i tu t iona l and 
administrative capacity; and a m o v e t o co - f inanc ing with the EU.

I n line with Government’s overall objectives for the coming years, the strategic 
framework that i s proposed to guide the three-year CPS program i s focused on facilitating 
Bulgaria’s successful economic and social integration with the EU. 

In support o f th is 
overarching objective and f o l l ow i n g the directions o f the Government’s med ium - te rm program, 
the CPS directions are proposed t o be guided by the f o l l ow i n g three m a i n p r io r i t ies : 

(i) Productivity and employment: Imp lemen ta t ion o f unfinished structural reforms and 

investments t o strengthen p roduc t iv i ty and employment in support o f strong p r iva te 
sector-led g row th a long the lines o f EU’s L i s b o n agenda; 

(ii) 
Fiscal sustainability and absorption of EU funds: Capacity building f o r imp roved

(iii) Social inclusion: Policies and investments t o reduce reg iona l imbalances and imp rove

52. 

These priorities would help guide the selection of future Bank financial and non- 

financial activities. The annual consultations with Government as pa r t o f the f lex ib le CPS 
p rog ramm ing approach (also see para 48) w o u l d rev iew current and planned ac t iv i t ies in the 
context o f the strategic framework, mod i@ them as needed, and define add i t iona l activities as 
appropriate. In the u n l i k e l y event that Bulgaria’s EU accession i s delayed by a year, the above 
strategic p r io r i t ies are considered su f f ic ien t ly robust to continue t o guide the Bank’s activities 
over the com ing th ree years. 

53 . Within this broader strategic framework, the consultations with Government 
resulted in a focused set of priorities for initial Bank engagement under the CPS. The 

strategic consultations o n the Bank’s fu tu re invo lvemen t p rov ided clear guidance f o r i n i t i a l Bank 
invo lvemen t in: (i) addressing the unfinished r e f o rm agenda rema in ing after the successful PAL 
program, (ii) developing a f isca l ly sustainable med ium - te rm expenditure f iamewo rk and

p r io r i t ized investment programs fo r key sectors, in comb ina t ion with (iii) a goal o f effective 
absorption o f EU funds. The k e y p r i o r i t y sectors proposed fo r the Bank’s immediate attention 
are health care, education and infrastructure. Specifically, Government seeks the Bank’s 
immediate he lp in addressing the rema in ing re fo rms in health, education and social protection, 
and in imp lemen t ing a f isca l ly sustainable investment p rog ram in roads and mun ic ipa l

The proposed lending program up to US%300 million per year would involve 2-3 
operations per year based on a ser ies o f DPLs and programmatic investment loans in 
support o f the above priority areas. 
In l i n e with Government’s p r io r i t ies fo r Bank 
involvement, a series o f three programmatic DPLs o f about US$150 m i l l i o n each w o u l d focus o n 
advancing the unfinished reforms in the HD sectors - health, education and social p ro tec t ion in 
particular, in support o f growth, employment, f isca l sustainability and social inclusion. T h e 
Government has requested that the DP L s wou ld be complemented by one t o tw o investment 
operations per year t o help with implementation o f p r io r i t ized investment programs and 
absorption o f EU funds in roads and mun ic ipa l infrastructure, social inclusion, and reg iona l 
development. These investment projects w o u l d be designed t o incorporate lessons o n investment 
lend ing f r om the p rev ious CAS (see paras 44 and 62 ) . They w o u l d build o n sound medium-term 
sector expenditure frameworks, and, where feasible, be designed as full o r pa r t ia l programmatic 
based approaches (PBAs).

The AAA program would be front-loaded to provide analytical support and advice 
in core policy areas and underpin the design o f lending operations. The CPS has benefited 
greatly f r om the recen t ly completed core AAA work, pa r t icu la r ly the C E M and PFPR w h i c h

In addition, the proposed p rog ram

The proposed CPS program i s balanced t o support the three strategic priorities o f 
the CPS while facilitating the overall goal o f Bulgaria’s successful economic and social 

integration with the EU. Table 3 shows how the proposed Bank lending and AAA instruments 
support the th ree strategic priorities o f the CPS. As can be seen, many o f the ins t rumen ts address 
more than one o f the strategic priorities. The D P L ser ies would support aspects o f a l l th ree 
p r io r i ty areas. At the same time, the Government has requested the Bank to focus i t s 
interventions in selected areas o f Bulgaria’s remaining development agenda where i t values the 
Bank’s comparative advantage and expects to achieve complementarities with the Government’s 
own interventions and involvement o f other external partners. Accordingly, Bank support wou ld 
no t necessarily address a l l aspects o f Bulgaria’s remaining agenda. Examples o f areas where 
Bank assistance i s not foreseen at this stage are agriculture and jud ic ia l reform. At the same 
time, these areas remain central to the Government’s program and continue to receive support 
f i om other external partners (also see para 65 below which shows how various external partners 
support Bulgaria’s broader development agenda). Bank support for the th ree CPS strategic

Poverty Reduction and Social Inclusion: 

T h e DPLs w o u l d support po l ic ies that 
p romo te further pove r ty reduction and social inclusion, by granting the poor, Roma in particular, 
equitable access to basic social services and supporting their inse r t ion i n t o the labo r force, and

(Roma, people with disabilities, ins t i tu t iona l ized children, vulnerable j o b seekers), in support o f 
mee t ing the goals o f the Joint Inc lus ion Memo randum (JIM) signed with the EU. The proposed 
reg iona l development pro jec t (FY09) w o u l d address regional imbalances by strengthening

d imens ion on living standards. These e f fo r ts are expected t o contribute to reduc ing r u r a l pove r ty 
and l ow e r i n g the gap between urban and r u r a l pove r ty . 

F. Lending Principles 

61. 
Annual lending volumes w i l l be determined in consultation with the Government 
and consistent with policy performance for Bank lending engagement and with prudent 
IBRD risWexposure management within the agreed envelope. W h i l e the mos t l i k e l y scenario 

w o u l d i n v o l v e lend ing up to US$300 m i l l i o n per year during FY07-09, inc lud ing D P L s w h i c h 
are expected to cover up to US$lSO m i l l i o n per year, annual lend ing volumes and ins t rumen ts 
w o u l d be agreed with the Government in accordance with the CPS strategic f ramewo rk and 
priorities, and consistent with conducive po l ic ies and prudent IBRD risMexposure management 
within the agreed lending envelope o f US$300 m i l l i o n pe r year. T o the extent the Government 
m a y seek higher levels o f fast disbursing lend ing operations (eg DPLs) than cu r ren t ly envisaged, 
the ove ra l l envelope w o u l d be reduced t o ensure exposure remains within the levels 
commensurate with the mos t likely scenario above. This i s fu r the r based o n t h e expectation that 
Bu lga r ia w i l l continue t o pursue sound macroeconomic po l ic ies and that macroeconomic r isks d o 
no t worsen. Should macroeconomic performance deteriorate, w h i c h may be evidenced by an 
increase in external imbalances beyond current levels, increased inflation, continued appreciation 
o f the rea l effective exchange rate, l e s s prudent f isca l policies, a dev ia t ion f r om Government’s 
sound debt management, or by downg rad ing o f creditworthiness ratings by comme rc ia l r a t i n g 
agencies, the lend ing p rog ram and compos i t ion w o u l d be rev is i ted and revert t o a lowe r level, 
w h i c h in the case o f a s ign i f ican t deterioration (i.e. a l o w case scenario) w o u l d comprise o n l y 

30

investment projects. 
In the proposed lending program, the DPLs w i l l require a sound 
macroeconomic framework. Sectoral lending in turn would be modulated b y the need for a 
satisfactory sector po l icy framework and expenditure program. Accordingly, the lending 
program would be adjusted for significant adverse changes in the macroeconomic or sector 
po l icy environment. A se t o f po l icy performance indicators shown below (Table 4) will provide 
a framework for judg ing the presence o f a suitable environment for Bank lending engagement. 
In the event o f significant changes in the proposed strategy, a CPS progress report would be 
prepared for discussion b y the Board.

62. 

Building on the lessons from the previous CAS, the choice and design o f lending 
operations w i l l follow several principles. The Government has indicated a preference for 
f u t u r e lending to involve a combination o f DPLs and investment operations which move toward 
programmatic based approaches (PBAs) and help absorb EU fbnds. Mo re particularly for 
investment lending, the fo l low ing principles wou ld be applied for f u t u r e Bank engagement: (i) 
finance pr ior i ty activities within a sustainable medium-term fiscal/expenditure framework and 
based on prioritized investment programs; (ii) help set up financing mechanisms and bu i ld 
capacity that facilitate absorption o f EU funds and co-financing with IFIs where appropriate; (iii) 
provide systemic solutions with lasting impact on institutional capacity and development, rather 
than one-off interventions; (iv) avoid design complexity and limit implementation periods up to 
four years; (v) mainstream implementation arrangements within existing Government structures, 
while ensuring sound fiduciary safeguards for project implementation; and (vi) where feasible, 
move towards programmatic support based on gradual adoption o f country fiduciary and 
safeguards systems in accordance with EU standards while ensuring compliance with Bank 
fiduciary standards based on fiduciary assessments o f the sectors and institutions involved in 
such lending. The Bank i s preparing Country Financing Parameters for Bulgaria in consultation

In the f inanc ia l sector, IFC’s strategy aims at increasing efficiency and sustainability o f 
the sector through appropriate financial products and ins t rumen ts . Such support w i l l 
continue to remain consistent with policies pursued b y the Government and the Bulgarian 
National Bank (BNB). IFC i s gradually shifting i t s focus to the non-bank financial 
sector. Secu r i t ies markets, local bond market, and contractual saving institutions are s t i l l 
underdeveloped and significant opportunities e x i s t to support f b t u r e development in these 
areas. 
IFC w i l l seek opportunities to introduce i t s guarantee, risk management and 
structured finance instruments. Given Bulgaria’s h igh energy intensity, energy efficiency 
products and renewable energy w i l l be another area o f pr ior i ty . To develop such a 
product, IFC w i l l provide financing combined with technical assistance programs to 
selected banks. In addition, IFC w i l l explore opportunities for TA to support 
improvement o f financial infrastructure which i s critical to market discipline. 
In the corporate sector, IFC w i l l continue to support the rehabilitation and modernization 
o f post-privatized companies in sectors where Bulgaria has a comparative advantage 
and/or export-oriented sectors. In addition, IFC w i l l continue to play an important role in 
promoting foreign investments in the areas where the technology transfer through FDI i s 
a prerequisite for productivity gains. IFC w i l l support possible s e l l offs o f locally owned 
industrial enterprises to European majors as we l l as help local companies in their 
international establishment. Support for local and international private investments in t h e 
health and education sectors w i l l be another area where IFC expects to have an increasing 
role. 
In the infrastructure sector, IFC’s objectives are to be innovative, foster public private 
partnerships and catalyze FDI. 
IFC pays special attention to support infrastructure 
development in coordination with the Bank, EIB, EBRD and the Stability Pact. The Bank 
and IFC w i l l collaborate closely in the infrastructure sector, particularly in developing a 
j o i n t program in municipal infrastructure financing o f water and waste water sector needs 
in selected municipalities. 
IFCs’ Private Enterprise Partnership - Southeast Europe 
Infrastructure (PEP-SE Infrastructure), recently established in Sofia, wou ld lead IFC’s

o f local private f i rm s to increase competitiveness and prepare them for EU entry and compliance 
with EU regulations, and supporting foreign direct investment - particularly green-field; (ii)

wastewater sector, where i t finances regional water companies with ISPA co-financing; and 
opportunities in railways and the road sector, and (iii) power and energy efficiency including 
support to the energy sector, energy efficiency and renewable energy resources, and 
improvements to the sector legal and regulatory framework.

The UNDP continues to be active in Bulgaria, while some o f the bilateral partners 
are starting to pull back in view o f the forthcoming EU accession. UNDP’s 2006-2009 

country program approved in June 2005 focuses on: (i) social inclusion and local economic 
development for poverty reduction; (ii) good governance for equitable local and regional 
development; and (iii) conserving energy and preserving the natural environment for sustainable 
development. The p r io r i ty areas o f USAID’S Graduation Strategy 2003-2007 a re r u l e o f law,

I. CPS Results M o n i t o r i n g 

71. 

The CPS results monitoring w i l l build on the successful PAL monitoring in the 
previous CAS and track progress towards achieving outcomes influenced by Bank 
interventions agreed to be undertaken as pa r t o f the CPS. Annex 1 shows a CPS results 

m a t r i x based o n agreed activities fo r i n i t i a l Bank involvement. Results mon i to r ing w o u l d be 
undertaken j o i n t l y with Government as part o f the annual consultation process fo r assessing 
progress o f the CPS and possible adjustments to the Bank program. These discussions w o u l d 
also p rov ide inputs i n t o upda t ing the resu l ts ma t r ix t o re f lec t adjustments to the Bank program. 

VI. Creditworthiness and Risk Management 

72. 

Bulgaria’s active debt management has achieved a gradual reduction in the share o f 
public debt t o GDP by limiting new borrowing and early repayment o f more costly debt, 
while improving the currency and interest rate structure o f debt. Bu lga r ia reached the 

Maas t r ich t p u b l i c debt c r i te r ion already in 2002, and by end-2004 the p u b l i c debt to GDP ra t io 
had declined t o 4 1 percent o f GDP and was estimated t o have reduced t o 32 percent by end- 
2005. Ex te rna l p u b l i c debt also declined f r om 77 percent o f GDP in 1999 to 33 percent o f GD P 
in 2004 and an estimated 25 percent in 2005. The considerable reduc t ion in pub l ic external debt 
was accompanied by increased p r iva te sector b o r r ow i n g (Figure 4). 
In l i n e with i t s debt 
management strategy, the Government carried ou t a numbe r o f early debt-buyback operations, 
i n c l u d i n g selected loans f r om t h e W o r l d Bank and IMF, and buyback o f the rema in ing Bu lga r ian 
B rady bonds. Bulgaria’s pub l ic debt management strategy further seeks t o ma in ta in a stable 
nom ina l amount o f debt, lead ing t o further reductions o f p u b l i c debt as a share o f GDP, while 
increasing the share o f domestic debt and im p r o v i n g currency compos i t ion o f debt with a sh i f t 
f r om U S do l la r towa rd Euro-denominated debt. T h e Government’s efforts in deve lop ing 
domestic debt markets w i l l he lp t o absorb considerable liquidity in the banking system, 
strengthen domestic capital markets, and p rov ide investment alternatives fo r p r iva te pension 
funds and insurance companies. 

Bulgaria’s creditworthiness has improved significantly over the last few years. 

73, 
Thanks t o the imp roved macroeconomic and structural policies, Bulgaria’s sovereign c red i t 
ra t ing was upgraded several times to investment grade over the pe r iod 2003-05. L o w sovereign 
bond spreads also indicate continued investor confidence.

I n the absence o f substantial adverse shocks to the economy and if‘ current 
structural and prudent macroeconomic policy i s maintained, medium-term external 
sustainability i s expected to remain reasonably assured and the external debt to GDP ratio 

relatively stable. However, the w iden ing current account de f ic i t and increasing consumption 
and investment fueled b y the p r iva te sector c red i t b o om pose vu lne rab i l i t ies in the context o f 
Bulgaria’s currency boa rd arrangement. Ca re fu l mon i to r ing o f the s i tua t ion i s thus warranted. 

75. 

Under the proposed lending scenario, IBRD’s exposure to Bulgaria would increase 

but i s expected t o remain manageable. Bank exposure t o Bu lga r ia w o u l d increase f r om about 
US$1.4 b i l l i o n in 2005 t o about US$1.8 b i l l i o n in 2009-10. This w o u l d represent a slight 
increase in Bulgaria’s share o f to ta l IBRD p o r t f o l i o f r om 1.3 percent in FY05 t o 1.7 percent in 
FY09-10. IBRD’s share o f Bulgaria’s to ta l external debt w o u l d stay in the 7-8 percent range, 
w h i l e IBRD debt service as share o f exports w o u l d fa l l to 0.7 percent by 2009 (Table 6). B o t h 
the preferred creditor exposure and I BRD ’ s debt service as share o f ove ra l l external pub l ic debt 
service w o u l d r ise in view o f IBRD’s increased exposure combined with the projected continued 
decline o f Bulgaria’s external p u b l i c debt re la t ive t o GDP as a resu l t o f Government’s prudent 
debt management. As part o f active debt management, Bu lga r ia recen t ly pre-paid some o f i t s 
outstanding commitments t o IBRD and the IMF, w h i c h explains the increased exposure 
indicators in 2006. Government’s decision t o continue bo r row ing f r om IBRD i s based o n i t s 
assessment o f the merits o f a continued engagement with the Bank in addressing i t s rema in ing 
challenges o f EU in teg ra t ion and convergence.

Bulgaria: Country Partnership Strategy 

76 . 
There are several r i s k s to the successful implementation o f the strategy - the main 
one would be a slowdown in the reform agenda which in turn would trigger a slowdown in 

economic growth. As po in ted ou t earlier, sustained high g row th w i l l require continued vigorous 
reforms in the business environment, human and phys ica l capital investment, strengthening o f 
labor markets, and f isca l adjustment. Given Bulgaria’s d i f f i c u l t demographic conditions, 
sustaining these re fo rms w i l l be c r i t ica l f o r keeping up p roduc t iv i ty improvements fo r enhanced 
growth. At the same time, the reforms n o w touch more sensitive areas w h i c h are meeting greater 
p o l i t i c a l and social resistance. The Bank program i t s e l f i s focused o n some o f these more 
d i f f i c u l t areas, such as health and education re fo rm w h i c h have lagged fo r insu f f ic ien t pub l ic 
support. The pressure f r om the EU accession agenda w i l l he lp t o m i t iga te the risk o f delays in 
the k e y r e f o rm areas. In the n o w u n l i k e l y event o f a delay in Bulgaria’s EU accession, the risk 
o f p o l i c y slippage i s low , given continued p ressu re f o r Bu lga r ia t o meet accession requirements. 
In terms o f the Bank program, the link t o continued satisfactory progress o n macroeconomic 
po l ic ies in case o f the D P L series and t o progress o n sectoral reforms in case o f b o t h DP L s and 
investment lend ing w o u l d help t o modulate the p rog ram to progress o n the needed policies. A 
proactive e f fo r t by the Government and the Bank to engage stakeholders o n the costs and 
benefits o f the re fo rms w o u l d also m i t iga te the risk o f slippage. 

77 . 

Further, the reforms and growth w i l l be subject to r i s k s to macroeconomic stability. 

In the short run, r isks t o the country’s external debt pos i t ion inc lude increases in interest rates, 
con t inu ing g row th in o i l prices, and reduc t ion in FDI f lows . Mac roeconom ic management cou ld 
be further complicated i f there were greater capital f l o w v o l a t i l i t y induced by the g row ing 
reliance o n short-term cap i ta l f lows . A reduction in domestic in te res t rates relative to 
comparable returns in the euro zone w o u l d magn i fy the r i s k s o f such vo la t i l i ty . The w iden ing 
external current account de f ic i t remains a serious concern as stated earlier, and raises questions 
about the competitiveness o f Bulgaria’s economy. Rea l e f fec t ive exchange rate and unit labor 
cost dynamics suggest that competitiveness remains adequate f o r the t im e being. In the med ium - 
term, the in ten t ion towards j o i n i n g the exchange rate mechanism ( E M - 2 ) and monetary 
integration with the EU after accession w i l l raise add i t iona l challenges in p i l o t i n g the economy 
towards full adop t ion o f the euro and ma in ta in ing i t within the s t r ic t Maas t r ich t criteria. The task 
w i l l be complicated by the large structural differences, b o t h rea l and financial, between Bu lga r ia 
and the other euro zone countries. These r i s k s are m i t iga ted by government’s strong reco rd o f 
sound macroeconomic management since t h e 1996-97 crisis anchored in the currency board and 
a prudent f isca l po l icy . T h e current Government has demonstrated i t s in ten t t o ma in ta in ing the 
past policies in this regard. A continuation o f the IMF program, at least th rough the f a l l 2006 
and possibly longer, w o u l d p rov ide support f o r ma in ta in ing prudent macroeconomic policies. 
Once Bu lga r ia j o i n s the EU, the EU’s S tab i l i ty and G r ow t h Pact (SGP) w o u l d help p rov ide 
fu r the r d isc ip l ine in support o f macroeconomic s tab i l i ty and g r ow t h (para 10).

1. 
The last Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) fo r Bulgaria was discussed by the World 
Bank’s Executive Directors in June 2002 and covered the period FYO3-FYO5. T h i s CAS 
Completion Report evaluates the effectiveness o f the Bank’s program in achieving i t s expected 
results as set out in the CAS and as further elaborated in the performance benchmark matrices o f 
the ser ies o f three Programmatic Adjustment Loans which formed the core o f the CAS program. 
The CAS Completion Report also identifies lessons learned, with implications for the forthcoming 
Country Partnership Strategy covering the period FY06-FY09. 

2. 
This CAS Completion Report i s based on a review o f the CAS, other documentation, 
and interviews. The documentation includes assessments o f implementation o f the CAS lending 
and non-lending programs, Joint Portfolio Review reports prepared during the CAS period, reports 
prepared by the Bank’s Quality Assurance Group and Operations Evaluation Department, and 
resu l ts from a World Bank Client Survey conducted in Bulgaria in May-June 2005. The las t 
Country Assistance Evaluation covered 199 1-2000, prior to the FY03-FY05 CAS. Interviews were 
held with government counterparts, other stakeholders, partners, and members o f the Bank’s 
Bulgaria Country Team during the CAS implementation period. The discussion o f progress toward 
country goals and CAS outcomes re f lec ts the findings o f the Bank’s recently completed Country 
Economic Memorandum, Public Finance Policy Review, and Education and Hea l th Policy Notes, 
as well as the preliminary findings o f the PAL I11 Implementation Completion Report (ICR) team. 

A. Political and EU Accession Context 

3 . 
Parliamentary elections in June 2001 resulted in the replacement o f the UDF-led 
coalition with a new government coalition led by the National Movement o f Simeon the 
Second (NMSS) , and headed by Prime Minister and former King Simeon the Second Saxe- 
Coburg Gotha. 
In addition to the N M S S , the coalition included the Turkish minority-based 
Movement for Rights and Freedom (MRF). With unmet promises o f improved prosperity leading 
to voter dissatisfaction and skepticism, the socialist candidate, Georgi Parvanov, won the 
presidential run-off election i n November 2002. In response to declining public support for the 
ruling coalition, there was a reshu f f le i n July 2003 at the M in is te r ia l and Deputy Prime M in is te r ia l 
level that resulted in changes i n a number o f the Bank’s key counterparts. Surviving a no- 
confidence vote held in February 2005, t h i s political leadership remained in place for the duration 
o f the CAS period. 

4. 
When the FYO3-FYO5 CAS was prepared in 2002, EU accession enjoyed broad 
popular support in Bulgaria and was a central theme o f the Government’s agenda. Accession 
negotiations had been under way s ince February 2000, as with Romania, Lithuania, Latvia, the 
Slovak Republic, and Malta.’ 

B. Alignment o f CAS and PAL Program with Country Goal 

5. 
Soon after taking off ice in mid-2001, the coalition government issued i t s Executive 
Program o f the Republic o f Bulgaria which set out a longer term strategic goal that remained 
in place fo r the duration o f the CAS period: to move Bulgaria closer to EU accession by (i) 
sustaining economic growth through creation o f an investment climate that promotes private

had begun accession negotiations in March 1998.

Page 4 o f 46 
sector investment, restructuring, and productivity; and (ii) reducing poverty and creating 
employment through empowerment o f the population, especially the poor, to participate in 
economic growth. 

6. 
This strategic goal fo r Bulgaria was very closely aligned with the CAS’s stated 
objectives and outcomes o f the CAS and its core instrument, a series o f three Programmatic 
Adjustment Loans (PALs). (See Table 1 .) The CAS’S stated overarching objectives were to: (i) 

reduce poverty and ra ise living standards; and (ii) support Bulgaria’s move towards EU accession. 
And the CAS’s stated outcomes were: (i) per capita national income growth; (ii) reduced poverty 
rate; (iii) reduced long-term unemployment; and (iv) reduced total unemployment. The Bank’s 
PALs, investment lending, and analytical and advisory ( A M ) work i n support o f the CAS 
objectives and outcomes were organized around three themes consistent with Bulgaria’s longer 
term strategic goal: 

(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 

promoting competitive private sector-led growth; 
strengthening public administration and anti-corruption initiatives; and 
investing i n human capital and strengthening social protection.

Page 5 o f 46 
The series o f three PALS was designed to support the Government’s reform program 
aimed at the achievement o f the following three outcomes aligned with the three CAS 
outcomes: 

7 . 

(i) 
(ii) 

(iii) 

average annual GDP growth rates o f 4.5 to 5.0 percent during 2002-2005; 
reduction o f the poverty rate by 50 percent by 2005 compared t o the rate in 2001; 
and 
reduction o f the unemployment rate to 12 to 14 percent in 2005 compared t o 17.5 
percent in 2001. 

8 . 

Underpinning these outcomes was a multitude o f outcomes specific to each o f the five 
pillars under the PAL program and spanning the Government’s four-year time horizon. 
These outcomes were articulated in the Program Document and the Government’s Le t te r o f 
Development Po l icy fo r P A L I, and carried through the two subsequent P A L S w i t h some 
adjustments as the program proceeded. 

11. PROGRESS TOWARD COUNTRY GOAL AND CAS OUTCOMES 

9. 
I n October 2002 (four months after the CAS was finalized), the European 
Commission (EC) concluded that Bulgaria had a functioning market economy but separated 
Bulgaria and Romania from the other ten candidate countries by putting them on a slower, 
unspecified timetable f o r accession. This contributed to a greater sense o f urgency fo r the 
Bulgarian Government to meet EU accession requirements, and served as an incentive fo r the 
Government to accelerate its pace o f implementing structural reforms and institutional capacity 
building. 

10. 
The Government’s goal o f moving Bulgaria closer to EU accession by the time o f the 
national elections in June 2005 was achieved. In M a y 2003 the EU set a tentative accession date 
o f January 2007 fo r Bulgaria and Romania. By mid-2004 Bulgaria had provisionally closed 
negotiations an the 3 1 chapters o f the EU acquis communautaire. In April 2005, as the CAS 
period was drawing to a close, Bulgaria signed the EU Accession Treaty. 

11. 
Notwithstanding this important milestone, more progress was s t i l l needed on a 
number o f fronts, such that in October 2005 the EU’s Comprehensive Monitoring Report 
concluded that accession might be postponed by one year. The shaded areas in Table 2 indicate 
those aspects o f the EU’s po l i t ica l and economic criteria, relevant t o the CAS, that were cited in the 
EU’s annual reports as needing accelerated progress p r io r to accession. The reports also evaluated 
progress in areas covered by the acquis. Although Bulgaria had succeeded in closing negotiations 
on a l l 31 acquis chapters in June 2004, the EU’s October 2005 report flagged areas o f “serious 
concern” in need o f further progress p r io r t o accession (e.g., EU funds absorption, anti-corruption 
initiatives, food safety). T h e report also noted that “ L i t t l e progress has been made in improving 
labor market f lex ib i l i ty , which, together with a comprehensive re fo rm o f the education system, 
wou ld be crucial fo r dealing with s k i l l s mismatches and imp rov ing t h e adaptability o f t h e 
Bulgarian economy.”

A. Sustaining Economic Growth 

12. 
During the CAS period, Bulgaria performed well against i t s objective o f sustained 
economic growth. (See Table 3 and Figure 1 .) When the CAS was designed, Bulgaria’s economy 
was performing reasonably we l l . Sound policies had maintained macroeconomic stability. 
Fo l low ing Bulgaria’s economic and financial crisis in 1996-1 997, a Currency Board Arrangement 
(CBA) was put in place, and the Central Bank could no longer exercise monetary or exchange rate 
policy. Macroeconomic adjustment could be achieved on ly through strict discipline in fiscal and 
incomes policy. By 2001 this cautious fiscal management had brought the external debt t o GDP 
ratio down to 79 percent f rom 100 percent in 1997. But g row th had slowed (from 5.4 percent in 
2000 to 4.1 percent in 200 l ) , per capita income was about 28 percent o f the EU-25 average, and the 
current account de f ic i t remained large, at 7.3 percent o f GDP in 2001. 

13. 
During the CAS period, strict fiscal discipline induced by the CBA strengthened 
Bulgaria’s financial position. The fiscal deficit was maintained at 0.6 percent o f GDP in 2002 
and was eliminated altogether in 2003, The fiscal balance was in s u r p l u s (1.7 percent o f GDP) in 
2004 and was estimated at 2.3 percent in 2005. This fiscal adjustment has been accompanied by 
reductions in tax rates and significant reductions in public debt. Bu lga r ia reached the Maastricht 
Treaty target o f a pub l ic debt to GDP ratio o f less than 60 percent in 2002, and t h e ratio estimated 
fo r 2005 i s 32.4 percent, less than h a l f o f the 2001 ratio o f 69.9 percent. This stabilization 
contributed to lower in f la t ion during the first several years o f the CAS period, averaging 4.1 
percent during 2002-2003, down f rom 7.4 percent in 200 1 .

Bulgaria’s strengthened financial position has helped to stimulate accelerated 

economic growth. Bulgaria’s GDP growth rate has increased f rom i t s 2001 leve l o f 4.1 percent to 
an estimated 5 . 5 percent in 2005, w i t h an estimated 2002-2005 annual average o f 5.2 percent. 
With annual growth rates exceeding the average o f the EU-25, Bulgaria’s per capita income has 
grown f rom about 28 percent o f the EU-25 average in 2001 to an estimated 3 1 percent in 2005. Per 
capita income (at purchasing power parity) has increased f rom US$6,483 in 2001 t o US$8,007 in

The private sector has led Bulgaria’s growth. I t accounted fo r an estimated 75 percent 

o f GDP in 2005 compared w i t h 70 percent in 20012, about the same as the average o f the EU New 
Member States (NMS), 75.6 percent. Private sector g row th has been stimulated largely by private 
consumption, wh ich has accounted fo r more than two-thirds o f GDP during the CAS period. By 
contrast, investment accounted fo r on ly about 20 percent o f GDP, with domestic investment growth 
slowing by h a l f during the CAS period. W h i l e consumption levels a r e high, savings rates are l ow 
relative to those o f CEEC3, in part due t o per capita income differentials.

16. 
Heavier consumer spending, higher international o i l prices, and higher food prices 
following heavy floods in the spring o f 2005 exerted inflationary pressure in the latter part o f 
the CAS period. Inflation i s estimated to have increased to an average o f 5.6 percent during 2004- 
2005 from 2.3 percent in 2003. 

17. 
Foreign direct investment (FDI) flows have grown substantially during the CAS 
period, from 5.9 percent o f GDP in 2001 to an estimated average o f 8.5 percent during 2002- 
2005, in response to improved macroeconomic stability resulting from implementation o f 
structural reforms. Cumulative FD I per capita has surpassed the US$500 mark and i s 
approaching the c r i t ica l mass needed to help improve Bulgaria’s ability to compete in external 
markets. However, this i s s t i l l well below cumulative FDI per capita levels o f strong trade 
performers among the N M S - about US$3,700 in Hungary and nearly US$3,800 in the Czech 
Republic. 

18. 
This gap vis-a-vis some N M S reflects the heavy concentration o f Bulgaria’s FDI in 
domestically oriented activities, due not only to the attractiveness to foreign investors o f 
sectors that serve primarily the domestic market, but also to impediments to export-oriented 
investment. Such impediments include inadequate basic infrastructure, complex regulatory 
frameworks, and an institutional framework that i s not sufficiently reliable or rules-based. The 
costs o f these ine f f ic ienc ies in Bulgaria’s economy can be transferred to domestic consumers via 
higher prices, but not to consumers i n external markets where there i s stronger competition. This 
phenomenon, combined with a growing share o f the population in agriculture (25 percent in 2004) 
despite the sector’s declining share o f GDP ( 1 1 percent i n 2004), are reflected in Bulgaria’s f l a t 
productivity levels during the CAS period. 

19. 
Bulgaria’s continued inefficiencies are reflected in not only its investment and 
productivity levels but also its current account balance during the CAS period. Through f isca l 
tightening the Government was able to bring the external current account deficit down from 7.3 
percent in 2001 to 5.6 percent in 2002. But i t widened in 2003 to 9.2 percent, due to a large 
in teres t rate differential with Western Europe and t h e resulting growth i n credit. F isca l tightening 
and measures to reduce growth in credit brought the external current account deficit down to 5 . 8 
percent in 2004, but higher prices and volume o f o i l imports, together with the impact o f t h e floods, 
pushed it up to an estimated 11.8 percent o f GDP in 2005. Bulgaria’s large FD I flows have been 
financing the current account deficit, and this i s projected to continue. These large external 
imbalances make Bulgaria vulnerable to external shocks and adjustments. Hence the current 
account deficit i s a serious concern and poses a considerable macroeconomic risk. 

B. Reducing Poverty and Creating Employment Through Empowerment 

20. 
Bulgaria’s sustained economic growth has in turn led to a significant drop in 
unemployment. According to the Employment Agency data (the basis for the Government’s 
reform program targets referenced in para. 7 above), t h e unemployment rate f e l l from 17.5 percent 
in 2001 to around 11 percent i n 2005. Labor Force Survey data (used in Table 4 because annual 
f igu res are available) indicate somewhat lower unemployment rates for the same period, but they 
also show a s ign i f ican t decline in unemployment, The Government’s active labor market programs 
have also had an impact. 

2 1. 
Progress in lowering the share o f long-term unemployment and increasing the labor 
force participation rate has been disappointing, however. (See Table 4.) Bulgaria’s labor force 
participation ra te i s one o f the lowest in the region. This may partly r e f l e c t Bulgaria’s labor market 
policy, which mandates large benefits (e.g., seniority premiums, regardless o f relevance o f skills to 
current job) for those with long-term, full-time employment contracts and does not allow for 

Annex C 
Page 10 of 46 
flexible hiring through the use o f temporary or part-time contracts. In addition, Bulgaria’s highly 
fragmented social assistance system o f more than 34 programs i s largely ineffective at alleviating 
p ~ v e r t y . ~ 
Instead, poverty alleviation in Bulgaria i s heavily dependent on pensions, which are not 
means-tested and therefore not an efficient or effective instrument for poverty a l l e ~ i a t i o n . ~

22. 

The lack o f comparable and timely data on poverty reduction makes i t difficult to 
assess progress against the poverty reduction outcome o f the CAS. The Bank conducted a 

Poverty Assessment Update in 2002 based on 2001 data, which formed the Bank’s baseline for the 
CAS period. An JDF grant approved during the previous CAS period aimed to build the 
Government’s capacity in poverty monitoring. In late 2003 t h e Government conducted a survey 
using a methodology more aligned w i t h that used by the EU’s EUROSTAT, and no t comparable t o 
the Bank’s 2002 Poverty Assessment Update. The Government’s next planned survey (2006), a 
Survey o f Incomes and L i v i n g Conditions, w i l l also lack comparability for methodological reasons. 
(EUROSTAT measures poverty in t e rm s o f income, wh i le the Bank does so in t e rm s o f 
consumption.) 

23. 

As a proxy f o r assessing progress against the CAS outcome o f poverty reduction, 
Bank staff simulated a poverty headcount index, with the 2001 poverty rate o f 12.8 percent 

shown in the CAS as a baseline. W i t h average household consumption data available fo r a l l 
relevant years, the concept o f elasticity was used fo r poverty approximation. The degree to wh ich 
poverty responds to growth i s captured in t h e no t ion o f row th elasticity o f poverty wh ich 
measures the change in poverty fo r a given change in growth. Given the experience w i t h poverty 
and growth linkages in neighboring countries, there i s a strong possibility that Bulgaria’s growth 
elasticity o f poverty i s greater than 1.5.7 Therefore, although direct measurement o f poverty in 
2005 i s not possible due to lack o f comparable data, i t i s highly l ike ly that the CAS outcome o f 
poverty reduction was achieved, w i t h a reduction in the poverty headcount index by at least one-

I n general the growth elasticity o f poverty would be negative, as growth and poverty tend to move in 
opposite directions. For example, i f poverty elasticity o f growth i s 2, then a 1 percent increase in growth w i l l

During 1998-2003, according to the ECA Regional flagship report, “Growth, Poverty, and Inequality in 
ECA” (2005), average growth elasticity ofpoverty for South Eastern Europe (SEE) was estimated at 2 . 5 . 
Assuming t h e SEE countries (including Romania and Serbia) are good proxy for Bulgaria with regard to 
poverty and growth linkages, i t i s reasonable to expect that growth elasticity o f poverty in Bulgaria would be

III. CAS PROGRAM DESIGN 

A. 

Instrument M i x and Linkages to CAS Outcomes 

27. 

The CAS program was designed around tw o lending scenarios, a base (most likely) 
case and a low case, with 14 triggers to be met f o r Bulgaria to remain in the base case. These 
tr iggers focused on f i v e areas o f per formance :

a satisfactory macroeconomic framework 
po r t fo l io - a disbursement ratio o f not less than 20 percent and satisfactory 
performance ratings o f not less than 80 percent o f Bank-financed projects 
structural reforms and private sector development - satisfactory progress against 
specific benchmarks fo r privatizations, railways restructuring, and approvals o f 
company registration and construction perm i ts ; establishment o f a Unified 
Revenue Information System; completion o f hnc t iona l reviews fo r c i v i l servants 
in two ministries; and amendment o f the bankruptcy law 
social sustainability - satisfactory progress in several aspects o f pension reform 
and implementation o f winter energy subsidy programs 
fiduciary capacity bu i ld ing - completion o f the C F A A in FY03 and satisfactory 
progress in implementing the action plan set out in the FYOO CPAR. 

28 . 
The centerpiece o f the CAS base case program was a series o f three Programmatic 
Adjustment Loans (PALs) totaling US$450 million equivalent, designed to support Bulgaria’s 
structural reform agenda and path to EU accession. The PALs supported the Government’s 

comprehensive program, organized around f ive complementary and mutually reinforcing pillars, 
each o f which was to contribute t o achievement o f the country goal and the three CAS outcomes: 

sustaining s t ruc tu ra l reforms 

in the enterprise sector, with emphasis on 

restructuring o f the infrastructure sectors (energy, railway, telecommunications, 
and water); 

establishing a market-Ji.iendly business environment by focusing on en t ry and exit 

poIicies, regulatory costs, delivery o f public services, competition, and jud ic ia l 
reform; 

deepening the f inanc ia l system by addressing the constraints to increased lending 

by the banking system and the development o f financial markets; 
improv ing pub l ic sector governance by implementing the anti-corruption strategy, 
strengthening local governments, and reforming pub l ic administration and 
thejudiciary; and 

investing in human cap i ta l and strengthening soc ia l p ro tec t ion by reforming the 

education, health, and pension systems and 
effectiveness. 

imp rov ing social assistance 

2 9 . 

I n addition to the base case triggers, the CAS spelled out several negative 
macroeconomic and structural developments that would trigger reconsideration o f 

proceeding with P A L III.” There were also f rom nine t o twelve triggers specific to each o f the 
three PALs, reflected in their respective Program Documents. 

30. 
A policy framework of triggers, Board conditions, and benchmarks organized around 
the five pillars was presented in the context of the first P A L and remained in place 

throughout the P A L series. As stated in the CAS, w i th in this framework each P A L was to have 

i t s own strategic focus as w e l l as continue support for po l icy measures in areas supported under the 
previous PAL(s). P A L I wou ld advance structural, regulatory and institutional re fo rm in the real

CAS; (ii) a lack o f improvement in the spreads on Bulgaria’s sovereign borrowing vis-&vis countries with 
similar risk rating, or deterioration in i t s own risk rating; (iii) a material deviation from the improving trend 
in the f isca l balance projected in the Government’s medium-term program, reaching fiscal balance by 2005; 
(iv) a material slow-down in the present trend o f increasing SMEs’ share in total employment; and (v) 
inadequate progress in reducing a r rea rs in tax payments, social insurance contributions, and energy b i l l 
payment as set out in the Government program. 

Annex C 
Page 15 o f 46 
sectors key to reforms, including energy. PAL I1 would focus on reform in areas taking longer to 
prepare, such as public administration, the legal and judicial system, and anti-corruption measures. 
And PAL I11 would focus on labor market and social sector policies, including long-term 
sustainability o f t h e social protection system and restructuring o f t h e health and education sectors. 

3 1. 
The design o f the PAL program was complex and multi-sectoral. Across the three-year 
program there were 3 1 triggers, and the number o f benchmarks went from 173 in the PAL I 
Program Document up to 246 in t h e PAL I1 Program Document, and down slightly to 232 in the 
PAL I11 Program Document. 

32. 

The PA L program was complemented by a pipeline o f seven sector investment loans 
totaling US$300 million equivalent, balanced across the major sectors: energy, municipal 
services, education, employment promotion and investment in social capital, tax administration, 
forestry, and rural finance. These were supplemented by three GEF operations and one PCF 
instrument. With the social sectors not specifically addressed in the EU acquis communautaire, 
investment lending i n these areas was informed more by the Bank’s global knowledge and i t s 
poverty reduction agenda. Ongoing loans in the portfolio also covered a broad range o f sectors, 
including those not addressed by the CAS pipeline, such as health. 

3 3 . 

Adjustment lending accounted fo r 60 percent o f total lending in the CAS program. 
During CAS discussions the Bulgarian authorities had requested a program consisting o f PALs and 
l i t t l e to no investment lending. However, Bank management set a ceiling o f 60 percent for fast- 
disbursing loans in light o f Bulgaria’s already high level o f indebtedness to the Bank, which would 
r i s e even further once the PALs began to disburse. During the CAS period, the ratio o f rSRD debt 
service to public and publicly guaranteed debt service was projected to increase from 8.9 percent in 
2002 to 1 1.9 percent and the Bank’s share o f total debt disbursed and outstanding was projected to 
increase from 9.9 percent in 2002 to 1 1 .O-11.8 percent. 

34 . 
The centerpiece o f the non-lending program in the CAS was to be the Country 
Economic Memorandum focusing on the policy agenda f o r Bulgaria’s successful EU 
integration. This was delayed from FY04 delivery to FY06 (so after CAS period), and while the 
previous Government was disappointed not to receive it, i t was well timed to launch dialogue with 
the new Government. A Public Expenditure and Institutional Review preceded the CAS period, 
although i t was successfully disseminated in the f a l l o f 2002. (See para. 114.) This was to be 
followed by a fiduciary report (Country Financial Accountability Assessment), technical assistance 
in energy and private sector development, and a combination o f sector reports (environment, 
energy, and transport) and policy notes (pension, f isca l decentralization, and agriculture). The third 
year o f the non-lending program (FY0.5) was fairly thin, but it was expected that this would be 
fleshed out later in the CAS period, once lending priorities for FY06 and beyond were better 
known. 

35 . While the CAS program instruments were not specifically designed to help Bulgaria 
fulfill acquis requirements per se, they were well aligned with the Bank’s institutional 
priorities and the CAS outcomes, and consistent with the CAS objective o f moving Bulgaria 
closer to EU accession. Attachment E shows these linkages. I t also i l lus t ra tes the extent to which 
instruments were concentrated more heavily on the CAS outcome o f per capita national income 
growth, with fewer focused on the CAS outcomes o f reduced poverty and unemployment. The 
Government and the Bank believed that sustained per capita income growth i n i t s e l f would lead to 
reduced poverty and unemployment, and so all CAS outcomes would be realized i f the CAS 
program were focused disproportionately on the growth outcome. 

Annex C

36. 
I n the event o f an unsatisfactory macroeconomic framework, Bulgaria would be in 
the low case. The low case CAS program would be limited to investment loans in the areas o f 
community-based development, ru ra l development, and poverty reduction, and not to exceed 
US$180 million equivalent during the three-year CAS period. Non-lending services would be 
limited to analytical work on poverty, social assistance, and energy and environment issues with 
s ign i f ican t impact on EU accession. The probability o f the low case was considered low in light o f 
Bulgaria’s strong performance and commitment to reform. 

B. Gaps in CAS Program 

37 . 

There were no gaps i n the design of the wide-ranging CAS lending program, but the 
non-lending program proved to be incomplete, with the result that there were gaps in its 
linkages to the lending program. The number o f non-lending instruments in the program more 
than doubled relative to what was originally envisioned in the CAS (from 12 to 25). This was 
partly in response to client demand for advice in additional areas such as public debt and public 
utility regulatory frameworks, as well as g r a n t s to address problems faced by ethnic minorities (the 
Bank helped launch a multi-country initiative focused on the Roma a year after the CAS was 
prepared). And it was partly at the Bank’s initiative, to underpin planned and potential lending 
operations for rural development, roads, and infrastructure financing in the energy and water 
supply and sanitation sectors. The CAS program should have included a Poverty Assessment in 
2005, to gauge progress against the CAS outcome o f poverty reduction. (See paras. 22-23.) In 
hindsight the Bank’s non-lending program should also have addressed the issue o f capacity 
building for effective absorption o f pre- and post-accession EU grant funds, which would prove t o 
be a critical issue la ter in the CAS period as well as for the forthcoming FY06-FY09 Country 
Partnership Strategy. In addition, the design as well as Government ownership o f the education 
and health investment loans already i n the portfolio during the CAS period (see paras. 121 and 128) 
would likely have been strengthened, had there been sector work prior to design o f those operations 
during the FY99-FYO1 CAS period, to analyze sector issues and recommend policy options. (The 
2002 PEIR addressed education and health sector issues, but several years a f ter the education and 
health investment loans had been designed and approved.) 

C . Monitoring and Evaluation 

38. 
The system f o r monitoring and evaluation (M&E) progress toward the CAS outcomes 
was successful because i t was embedded in the PAL program negotiated with the 
Government. The Performance Benchmark matrix for each PAL spelled out measurable 
benchmarks and the corresponding specific, expected outcomes. Unlike those in a CAS, PAL 
benchmarks and outcomes are legally negotiated and agreed with the Government, and so are more 
meaningful. This approach o f detailed, multi-sector benchmarks and outcomes has subsequently 
been used in the design o f PAL programs in Romania and Croatia with good success. Progress 
toward achievement o f t h e Bulgaria CAS outcomes i s therefore measured to a good extent within 
the M&E framework o f PALS I - 111. (See Attachment F.) 
39 . M&E was also successful because i t was institutionalized within the Government. T h e 
high-level Council for Structural Policy, la ter called t h e Council for Economic Policy, coordinated 
and managed implementation o f the reforms supported by the PAL program. The Council was co- 
chaired by the Deputy Prime M i n i s t e r and Minister for Economy and was supported by an e f f i c i e n t 
secretariat with access across the Government at the ministerial level. Several other committees 
were formed to focus on specific components o f reform, and feedback mechanisms were 
established fo r tracking progress toward outcomes. 

Annex C 
Page 17 o f 46 

40. 

Measurement o f performance against one o f the PAL program outcomes, poverty 
reduction, was hindered by the lack o f timely poverty data comparable to the 2001 baseline 
data in the Bank’s 2002 Poverty Assessment Update. Poverty rates for 2003 were measured by 

the Poverty Monitoring Unit within the Ministry o f Labor and Social Policy, using a new multi- 
topic household survey. Capacity building o f the Poverty Monitoring Unit was supported by an 
Institutional Development Fund (IDF) grant.” The 2003 survey resu l ts , which t h e Government 
chose not to publish for political reasons i n the pre-election cycle, were not directly comparable to 
the Bank’s 2001 data. The Government now plans to conduct a survey in 2006, aligned with 
EUROSTAT’s income-based methodology. I n the future, the Bank w i l l need to conduct i t s own 
poverty assessments i n view o f methodological issues and political factors. 

I V . CAS PROGRAM IMPLEMENTAT ION AND OUTCOMES 

41. 

By the end o f the CAS period, the broad CAS outcomes o f per capita national income 
growth, poverty reduction, and reduced total and long-term unemployment had all been 

achieved And as quantified in the Government’s program and the corresponding PAL program’s 
overall outcomes, the specified poverty reduction outcome was likely achieved, and the specified 
growth and unemployment outcomes were not only achieved but surpassed. (See Tables 3 and 4.) 

42. 
The CAS outcomes are inter-related. Poverty i s reduced as unemployment declines and 
for both, sustained economic growth i s a strong driver. A Bank instrument aimed at sustained 
growth therefore has an impact on reduction o f poverty and unemployment as well, and a Bank 
instrument aimed at reduced unemployment has an impact on poverty reduction. Because they are 
more distinct one from another, and at the same each contribute to the achievement o f a l l th ree 
CAS outcomes, the three themes o f the CAS and PAL programs - (i) promotion o f competitive 
private sector-led growth, (ii) strengthening o f public administration and anti-corruption initiatives, 
and (iii) investment in human capital and strengthening social protection - are the framework for 
the following assessment o f the impact o f Bank instruments. See Attachment F for detailed 
assessment o f progress against desired PAL program outcomes within this thematic framework. 

A. 

Impact o f Bank Instruments 

Theme I : Promo t ing Competitive Pr iva te Sector-Led G row th 

. 

43. 
Complemented by several investment loans and a sector adjustment ioan, the 
primary vehicle f o r the Bank’s supporting increased competitiveness and private sector-led 
growth was the cluster o f the first three pillars o f the PA L program: Sustaining S truc tura l 

Reform (Pillar I), Establishing a Market-Friendly Business Environment (Pillar 2), and Deepening 
the Financial System (Pillar 3). Bulgaria’s successful implementation o f reforms i n these areas 
supported by the PAL program contributed to the expansion o f t h e private sector to an estimated 75 
percent o f GDP in 2005 compared to 70 percent in 2002. As a result, EBRD upgraded Bulgaria’s 
transition indicators for large-scale privatizations in 2004, infrastructure and banking reform in 
2004, and competition policy in 2005. (See Table 7.) This progress i s also reflected in Bulgaria’s 
FD I inflows over t h e period, averaging US$1.6 billion a year between 2001 and 2004 (60 percent 
more than the PAL program’s target) and comparing favorably with those o f N M S .

44. 

The objectives of reforms supported by Pillar 1 were largely met. These objectives 

were to ra t iona l ize the ro le o f the state through privatizations while mitigating associated 
environmental r isks ; improve efficiency i n the energy, railway, and water sectors; prepare the 
energy sector for EU accession; and liberalize the telecommunications market. 

45. 

The goal o f privatization and restructuring of SOEs was successfully achieved under 

the P A L program. Mo re than 80 percent o f t h e remaining SOEs in which the Government had 
majority control in 2002 were sold or liquidated, and most companies in which the Government 
had minority shares were also divested. These privatizations contributed to t h e increase i n the 
private sector’s share o f GDP, from 7 0 percent to 75 percent during the CAS period. Bulgaria’s 
performance in large-scale privatization i s now on a par with the best performing transition 
countries. The main outstanding and unfinished agenda in the PAL program’s large non- 
infrastructure privatization i s Bulgartabak. As PAL I1 was being prepared, i t became clear that the 
privatization o f Bulgartabak, originally envisioned as a PAL I1 Board condition, would be delayed 
due to changing market and domestic political conditions, This privatization was therefore shifted 
to a second-tranche condition, which made PAL I1 the only multi-tranche operation in the PAL 
series. I n the end, Bulgartabak was not privatized, and the second tranche o f EUR 20 million was 
cancelled. The significance to the international markets of t h e Government’s privatizing 
Bulgartabak diminished over the course o f the PAL program, in light o f s ign i f ican t progress i n 
other privatizations as well as political factors affecting this particular sale, widely publicized in the 
pre-election period. (The Minister o f Agriculture was a member o f MRF, a minority party within 
the governing coalition, with Bulgaria’s tobacco growers forming part o f the party’s constituency.) 
As a compensating measure, the privatization o f BTC was added to the PAL 111 Board conditions. 

46 . 

Bulgaria’s energy intensity (measured in terms of kg oil equivalent per € 2000 PPP) 
was reduced by 10 percent from 2001 to 2004, and while data are not yet available, a further 

reduction in 2005 i s likely. Several reform measures supported by the PAL program contributed 
to this outcome, including: (i) energy prices brought to cost recovery levels; (ii) an improved legal 
and regulatory framework through enactment o f a new Energy Act consistent with EU energy 
directives (informed by PPIAF on new gas distribution networks); (iii) upgrading o f the 
institutional capacity o f the State Energy Regulatory Commission (SERC); and (iv) spin-off o f 
electricity distribution and generation companies from the former monopoly electricity company 
(NEK). The PAL program supported s ign i f ican t private sector entry in t h e energy sector, through 
100 percent privatization o f electricity distribution with the sale o f a l l seven distribution companies 
and seven (compared to the target o f five) district heating companies. 

47. 
The energy reforms supported by the P A L program were complemented by several 
investment operations, sector work, and technical assistance during the CAS period. PAL 

Annex C 
Page 19 o f 46 
benchmarks were informed by the Bank’s In fras truc ture and Energy Strategy Review (FY03). The 
IBRD-financed District Heating project aims to improve the quality o f the Sofia and Pernik D is t r ic t 
Heating Companies’ service provision and f inanc ia l viability, as well as to increase their energy 
efficiency and reduce pollution. Results thus far from this project show that more consumers are 
returning to the district heating services o f both companies, f inanc ia l viability i s increasing which 
has allowed t h e phase-out o f operating subsidies, and heat consumption per apartment i s decreasing 
due to t a r i f f increases and demand-side measures supported by the project. The roject builds on 
the successfully implemented district heating component o f an ear l ier operation,” which financed 
the procurement and installation o f heat meters in buildings in 15 district heating systems. In i t s 
Project Performance Assessment Review (PPAR), IEG rated the development impact o f this 
component high in light o f achieved pumping cost savings and water loss reduction. 

48 . 
Bulgaria i s undertaking a number o f Bank-supported initiatives to help reduce the 
energy intensiveness o f its economy and meet its obligations under the UN Framework 
Convention on Climate Change. A GEF Energy Efficiency Grant (informed by the Bank’s 
earlier National Energy Efficiency Study) aims to support a large increase in energy efficiency 
investments for reduced greenhouse gas emissions, through development o f self-sustaining, 
market-based financing mechanism, an energy efficiency revolving fund that reduces investor risk, 
independent o f public subsidies. Implementation i s still at an early stage. Complementing this 
GEF grant and the District Heating loan are three Prototype Carbon Fund Emission Reduction 
Purchase Agreements (ERPAs), to help Bulgaria meet i t s obligations under the Kyoto Protocol: 
one for a wood residue to energy project (for minimum o f US$1.75 million) aimed at reducing 
dependence on imported coal through conversion to stockpiled wood, and two signed with t h e 
Sofia and Pernik District Heating Companies (for a total value o f close to U S 3 . 0 million). These 
ERPAs were not planned at the time o f the CAS. In addition, Bulgaria implemented a small 
Forestry Fuel Switch Pilot (approximately US$900,000 in Bank-administered PHRD grant funds) 
to tes t the installation, operation, and resulting carbon credits o f two fue l -e f f ic ien t , low-polluting 
heating systems, switching from fossil to wood f u e l in two municipal buildings. The project 
increased public awareness. As these various initiatives indicate, Bulgaria has been a leader within 
the region in making use o f the Bank’s “green” instruments. 

49. 
PAL restructuring o f the railway sector was successful. The Government’s targets for 
f inanc ia l sustainability established for end-2005 had been met by end-2004: operating subsidies 
(excluding funds for investment) f e l l from 0.5 percent o f GDP in 2000 to 0.2 percent; f inanc ia l 
working ratios o f the operating and infrastructure companies were close to 100 percent (not 
including government subsidies); and productivity increased by 12 percent. These outcomes were 
achieved through actions supported by the PAL program, including the establishment o f a new 
railway operating company and a new railway in fras truc ture state enterprise, termination o f loss- 
making passenger services, and reduction o f the railway labor force by 13 percent from end-2001 
to end-2004.20 

50. 
The telecommunications sector was successfully liberalized. Substantial progress was 
made toward the P A L benchmarks for increased digitalization o f the trans fer network, transit 
exchanges, and fixed subscribers, the target that 94 percen t o f households with telecom services 
have in terne t access was met, and telephone connection waiting time was reduced. These resu l ts 
were achieved through actions to liberalize the sector, consistent with EU requirements and 

’’ The Water Companies Restructuring and Modernization loan, to which t h e district heating component was 
added when the loan was restructured in 1997 (see para. 51) . 
*’ Aithough l e s s than the 20 percent envisioned at the outset o f the PAL program, as a trigger relating to 
railway reform was changed from focusing on labor force reduction to include improved financial 
performance through changes in ta r i f f s t ruc tu re and other s truc tura l reforms. 

Annex C 
Page 20 o f 46 
supported by the PAL program, including establishment o f the Communications Regulation 
Commission, enactment o f a new Telecommunications Law consistent with best practice and EU 
requirements, and privatization o f BTC and elimination o f i t s monopoly. The Bank’s technical 
assistance for telecommunications regulator capacity enhancement, together with a PHRD-funded 
assessment o f Bulgaria’s telecommunications market and policy, helped to inform the sector 
reform agenda. 

5 1. 
E f fo r ts under the PAL program to modernize the water sector were less successful, in 
part owing to challenges in coordinating private sector entry with the flow o f EU grant funds 
to utilities which have concessions o r management contracts. W h i l e the reduction in the water 
companies’ operating ratio did not likely meet the PAL program benchmark o f 86 percent by end- 
2005, i t did decline to 88 percent in 2004 from 90 percent in 2002. Under the PAL program, the 
Government adopted a new Water Sector Strategy emphasizing public-private partnerships for the 
provision o f adequate water service for a l l citizens, wastewater treatment in line with EU 
directives, and rehabilitation and construction o f water and sewerage networks. A new Water 
Regulatory Law was enacted in January 2005, supported by technical assistance from the PPIAF. 
PAL benchmarks in the area o f water sector reform were informed by tw o pieces o f analytical 
work in FY04 (Financing the Water and Wastewater Sector and Environmental Sequencing 
Strategies for EU Accession) and preceded by the Bank’s Water Companies Restructuring and 
Modernization loan from an ear l ier CAS and which closed i n December 2002. T h e loan financed 
primarily (i) water and sewerage investments aimed at improving water quality i n urban areas, 
operating efficiency and cost recovery, and transparency i n procurement; and (ii) institutional 
strengthening o f Regional Water Companies (RWCs). The original project objectives were only 
partially achieved i n terms o f scale, because nearly half o f the US$98 million loan amount was 
cancelled due to Bulgaria’s financial crisis in 1996-1997, which reduced the RWCs’ willingness to 
take on sub-loans. 

52. With respect to environmental mitigation, the Government has been implementing 
provisions o f the EU Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control (IPPC) Directive and 
extending issuance o f integrated permits. A new Environmental Protection Act, harmonized 
with EU requirements, was adopted. B y end-2004, the Government had issued only 7 integrated 
environmental permits under the IPPC directive, against the program’s goal o f approximately 225 
to cover a l l enterprises under the IPPC directive by end-2007. With applications pending for 90 
more, the Government needs to move more swiftly if it i s to meet i t s end-2007 goal. Given i t s 
good track record i n addressing privatization-related environmental issues, there i s a good chance 
the Government w i l l be able to meet i t s goal. 

53. 
Two environmental mitigation loans from the previous CAS program, aimed at 
promoting growth, were in the portfolio six to twelve months into this CAS period before 
they closed. 
The Environmental Remediation Pilot financed successful clean-up o f an 
environmentally hazardous industrial site, MDK Copper Smelter. Discharge o f heavy metals and 
other pollutants was reduced, and a monitoring system was installed. The project has served as a 
model for addressing past environmental damage and liability in the context o f privatization and 
laid the groundwork for t h e Environment and Privatization Support Loan (EPSAL). Under the 
EPSAL the Government established norms, good by regional standards, for dealing with 
environmental liability ensuing from privatizations. The privatization law was amended to clarify 
state liability for environmental damages. The loan supported t h e establishment o f a framework for 
integrating environmental liabiliaties into privatization o f th ree industrial SOEs. The Government 
subsequently applied this framework to complete the privatization o f ten additional industrial 
SOEs. 
In addition, there was substantial progress in harmonizing with EU environmental 
requirements, An ongoing GEF Wetlands Restoration and Pollution Reduction project was 
approved just prior to the CAS period. I t aims to support the adoption o f sustainable natural 

Annex C 
Page 21 o f 46 
resource management practices by local communities and local authorities in a nature park area and 
a protected s i t e area. The wetlands restoration component i s stalled (see para. lll), but the 
protected areas management component i s proceeding well, w i th management plans more than 50 
percent completed, w i t h the active participation o f local stakeholders and park administration. 
Project outcomes are t o be achieved by project closing in 2008. 

54. 
The objectives o f Pillar 2 to reduce firm entry constraints and regulatory costs, 
improve the Government’s business service delivery, ensure competitive and functioning 
markets, and improve the efficiency of the insolvency regime were met, while the objective to 
promote flexibility in the labor market was partially met. Competition in the domestic market, 
wh ich had been l im i ted by an overly complex regulatory environment and inefficient contract 
enforcement, improved fo l low ing regulatory and jud ic ia l reforms supported by the P A L program. 
The SME share o f employment increased t o 56.7 percent in 2003 from 50.6 percent in 2000 and i t s 
share o f value added increased to 36.2 percent in 2003 f rom 29.5 percent in 2000. The 
Government streamlined regulatory regimes to reduce private sector transaction costs. Mos t 
centrally managed regulatory regimes fo r licensing, permission and registration were eliminated or 
modified. An Internet-based public register o f a l l current operative regulatory regimes was put in 
place fo r greater transparency and accessibility. A new L a w on Administrative Regulation and 
Administrative Control on Economic Activities, the enactment o f wh ich was a P A L benchmark, 
controls and codifies the principles needed to underpin introduction o f new regimes. This was a 
contributing factor in the substantial decline in the shares o f f i r m s indicating business licensing and 
pe rm i ts and uncertainty o f regulatory policies and bribery as problems in doing business. (See 
Figure 3.)

Enactment o f a new Law on the Bulstat Register (a P A L III trigger) enabled 
businesses to use the Bulstat number as the single-identification number for registration as 
well as tax and social security payments. This established a un i f ied national register t o help 
facilitate shifting the registration system f rom the courts t o a non-judicial administrative process. 
The release o f judges f rom routine administrative procedures is reducing delays associated w i t h the 
resolution o f commercial disputes. The Bank’s Private Sector Assessment (FY04) helped lay the 
groundwork fo r this reform. 

56. 
Bulgaria’s efforts to promote competition and functioning markets were supported 
by the P A L program as well as the ongoing Registration and Cadastre loan, approved during 
the previous CAS. Under the P A L program, the Government upgraded the capacity o f i t s 
Commission fo r the Protection o f Competition through enactment o f amendments t o the L a w on

the Protection o f Competition (a P A L benchmark). Indicators o f progress include SMEs’ steadily 
increasing share o f employment ( f rom 51.6 percent in 2001 to 56.7 percent in 2003) and value 
added ( f rom 31.2 percent in 2001 to 36.2 percent in 2003), and a near doubling o f a n t i t r u s t 
decisions during 2003-2004. The Registration and Cadastre loan supports the establishment o f a 
Cadastre Agency and a property registration unit w i th in the M in is t ry o f Justice, to create a unified 
cadastre and property registration system that includes information technology, l o t creation, 
digitalized mapping, survey, and adjudication. Although the loan was approved nearly f ive years 
ago, i t s impact to date has fallen far short o f expectations. (See para. 128.) Successful completion 
o f this project w i l l be critical to the development o f a f k c t i o n i n g land market in Bulgaria. 

57. 
The PAL program supported amendments to the Commercial Code to improve the 
insolvency regime and accelerate resolution o f insolvency cases. These changes included 
gua ran tee ing the r i g h t s and independence o f trustees, s t reng thened p r o t e c t i o n o f t h e r i g h t s 

o f private creditors, more stringent criteria fo r licensing and dismissal o f trustees, and strengthened 
monitoring and control by the Ministry o f Justice and the courts. Figure 4 shows that t h e 
Government was successful in accelerating the insolvency process and facilitating the ex i t o f non- 
viable en terpr ises . The P A L objective had already been achieved in 2004 in that the average time 
fo r resolving insolvency cases f e l l by six months between 2003 and 2004, close to that found in 
other advanced transition economies.

made due t o the po l i t ica l d i f f icu l t ies o f implementing labor market reforms in an election year and 
in l igh t o f international comparisons indicating Bulgaria’s labor regulations were not overly 
restrictive. However, these comparisons d id not take in to account Bulgaria’s Currency Board 
Arrangement, l ow employment rate, and aging population, a l l o f which point to Bulgaria’s need to 
outperform other countries in labor market f lex ib i l i ty in order to be competitive. Furthermore, the 
BEEPS resu l ts indicate that a less restrictive labor code could have a significant impact on 
employment. 
(See Figure 5 . ) 
Mo re limited enhancements to labor market f lex ib i l i ty were 
achieved than in i t ia l ly planned under the P A L program. These included enactment o f amendments 
to the Labor Code to strengthen anti-discrimination provisions,21 amendments to the Health Act to 
reduce abuse o f sick leave provisions, and removal o f regulatory barriers to the private provision o f 
employment services. 

59. 
The objectives of Pillar 3 to improve the legal framework for lending, complete 
banking reform, and develop the financial markets and regulatory framework for private 
pension funds were met. Bu i ld ing on progress prior to the P A L program, some 98 percent o f 
bank assets were privatized by the end o f the P A L program, leading to a well-capitalized, well- 
supervised and profitable banking sector, and 100 percent o f Bulgaria’s insurance sector was also 
privatized. In addition, the legal framework has been strengthened against terrorist financing and 
money laundering, and to introduce global custodianship as we l l as more f lex ib i l i ty in the 
investment regime to facilitate the movement o f pension fund members among funds. As a resu l t 
o f these actions, P A L outcomes were met or surpassed, w i th credit to the private sector increasing 
to an estimated 36.9 percent o f GDP in 2004 from 15 percent in 2001. Access to and cost o f

60. With the cancellation o f several planned Bank loans aimed at stimulating economic 
growth in rural areas, the one remaining Bank instrument with this objective was the Survey 
on Rura l Development Needs. 

(See paras. 116, 123-124.) This had been envisioned as an 
Ag r icu l tu re Sector Note when the CAS was prepared, but when the Rural Finance loan was 
replaced by a Rural Development loan, the scope o f t h e sector wo rk was mod i f ied accordingly. 
The Survey served as a basis fo r Bulgaria’s “National Program fo r development o f Agriculture and 
the Ru ra l Regions 2007-20 13,” a requirement fo r EU accession.

The primary CAS 
instruments aimed at strengthening Bulgaria’s public 
administration and anti-corruption initiatives were Pillar 4 o f the PAL program (Improving 
Public Sector Governance), the Revenue Administration Reform Loan, and the Trade and 
Transport Facilitation in South East Europe (TTFSE) loan. The Bank’s fiduciary AAA (the 

Country Financial Accountability Assessment and Country Procurement Assessment Report) were 
also intended to support these efforts. The Bank also provided technical assistance on to strengthen 
the Government’s capacity in debt management. (See B o x 2.) 

62. 

The objectives o f Pillar 4 o f the PA L program were wide-ranging, as public 
administration reform and anti-corruption efforts had not been previously tackled. By 

contrast, the structural reforms supported by Pillars 1-3 were bu i ld ing on those initiated under 
sector adjustment loans during the previous CAS period. Actions supported by the P A L program 
included Parliament’s approval o f amendments t o the C i v i l Service Law, and the Government’s 
adoption o f a Public Administration Reform Strategy, launch o f fknctional reviews, introduction o f 
performance standards, 
improvement o f budget management systems, adoption o f a legal 
framework governing the accountability o f judges, and preparation and implementation o f an Anti- 
co r rup t ion Strategy and Ac t ion Plan. Much o f the reform agenda fo r Pillar 4 was informed by 
studies funded by a PHRD grant, including a comparative analysis o f c i v i l service pay and a 
proposal fo r a results-based compensation system. 

Box 2: Debt Management Technical Assistance Program and U s e o f IBRD Financial Products 

In mid-2002 the Ministry o f Finance requested technical assistance in public debt management from the Bank’s 
Treasury staff, to address Bulgaria’s high proportion o f external debt coupled with currency and interest ra te risk. A 
three-year Government Debt Management Strategy was approved by the Council o f Ministers in March 2003, and 
several months later Bulgaria signed a Master Derivatives Agreement“ (MDA) with the Bank. T h e MDA provided 
the contractual framework for a swap between the Bank and the Government to change the currency o f Bulgaria’s 
net obligation on a VSL (Variable Spread Loan) o f $96 million, €?om USD to EURO, in l i n e with Bulgaria’s strategic 
objective to reduce i t s share o f USD-denominated debt. The swap took place in November 2003 and was the f i r s t 
IBRD currency swap under an MDA. 

I n December 2003 the Bank’s Treasury s t a f f entered into a fee-based technical assistance agreement with the 
Bulgarian authorities, with the fee paid by t h e Bulgarian National Bank (BNB) through the Bank’s Reserve Asset 
Management Program’s technical advisory program for international reserves management. T h e technical assistance 
has focused on public debt and cash management, with the objective o f strengthening the institutional capacity o f the 
Bulgarian State Treasury, in particular i t s governance and decision-making arrangements and the techn ica l s k i l l s o f 
staff below the management level. 

During i t s technical assistance program with the Bank, Bulgaria has successfully implemented i t s debt management 
strategy and strengthened t h e organizational s truc ture o f the Debt Management Office. Intensive s t a f f training has 
taken place, both in Sofia and abroad, and the techn ica l assistance program i s nearing completion, 
“ Bulgaria was the second country to do so, after Tunisia.

K e y desired outcomes o f Theme 2 were achieved. These included implementation o f 
merit-based recruitment and pay, with 100 percent o f the c iv i l service affected in some way; a l l 
new recruitment conducted through external recruitment processes in accordance with new 
requirements; c iv i l service pay increases exceeding inflation to narrow the gap with the private 
sector; and introduction o f a new public procurement framework aligned with EU requirements. 
Public administration reforms exceeded expectations and were implemented in a relatively short 
period o f time. There was progress in certain aspects o f governance as well. Anti-corruption 
public councils were established in 21 o f 28 regional administrations. There was a 213 percent 
increase i n applications to government bodies for access to public information in 2003 compared to 
2002. A standing commission was formed within t h e Supreme Judicial ‘Council to address 
corruption within the judiciary. Independent reviews indicate that issues o f public governance 
have improved, but important challenges remain. This i s reflected in BEEPS r e s u l t s indicating that 
custom tax regulation and corruption have eased as problems in doing business, but Bulgaria s t i l l 
fares worse than the N M S in terms o f corruption more generally. (See Figure 7 . )

Pillar 4 o f the PAL program was complemented by the Revenue Administration 
Reform investment loan and informed by the Bank’s report on Issues in Intergovernmental 
Relations. The Revenue Administration Reform Project (RAW) i s financing the establishment o f 
a sustainable public revenue collection system that facilitates private sector development and 
complies with EU accession requirements. I t aims to (i) maximize the level o f taxpayer voluntary 
compliance, (ii) promote effectiveness and efficiency - thereby enabling tax rate reductions that 
would stimulate economic growth, (iii) establish a professional workforce at the Na t iona l Revenue 
Agency established by Parliament in 2002, (iv) reduce the potential for corruption, (v) improve 
equity i n system administration, and (vi) reduce the taxpayer’s compliance burden. To date, 
indicators show significant improvements in revenue collection and compliance rates, with some 
efficiency and effectiveness gains due to the separation o f cen tra l and municipal revenue collection 
functions and transfer o f responsibility for local revenue collection to municipalities. These gains 
are reflected in tax rate cuts introduced i n 2005. The National Revenue Agency began operations 
on January 1, 2006, so i t s longer term impact i s not yet known, but thus far the loan i s meeting i t s 
objectives, and implementation i s proceeding well despite i t s inherent institution building 
challenges. 

65. 
The TTFSE loan was prepared during the previous CAS and remained in the 
portfolio for all o f this CAS period and closed on September 30,2005. The loan was part o f a 
regional program that was a collaborative effort among Bulgaria and other countries in South East 
Europe, and the EU, with financing by t h e Bank and the U S Government aimed at reducing non- 

.

t a r i f f costs to trade and transport and smuggling and corruption at border crossings. Performance 
against outcomes was impressive, with border trade volume significantly increased, as are t a r i f f 
revenue collections, while the cost o f collection has declined. 
In light o f this successful 
experience, the Government has requested a seque l operation wh ich i s expected to feature in the 
new CPS. 

66. 

A Bank study on Issues in Intergovernmental Relations on fiscal decentralization was 
completed early in the CAS period to in fo rm the subsequent RARP as w e l l as t h e public 
expenditure management component o f P i l la r 4 in the P A L program. Country Financial 
Accountability Assessment and Country Procurement Assessment Report (the latter not included in 
the CAS program) informed P i l la r 4 po l icy actions as well. 

Theme 3 : Investing in Human Capital and Strengthening Social Protection 

67. 

The primary CAS instruments aimed at investing in human capital and strengthening 
social protection were Pillar 5 of the P A L program and the Social Investment and 
Employment Promotion loan. These were supplemented by t h e Pension Reform Note, the IDF 
Grant fo r Integration o f Ethnic Minorities, 
the JSDF Grant fo r Ch i ld Development in 
Disadvantaged Communities, and the Poverty Assessment Dissemination and Disclosure Pilot. In 
addition, there were loans for Education Modernization, Health Sector Reform, and Ch i ld Welfare 
Reform plus an IDF Grant for Poverty Monitoring, Evaluation, and Policy D e s i g n (see paras. 22 
and 40) in the portfolio, approved during the previous CAS. 

68 . W i th some o f these instruments successful and others less so, the objectives o f Theme 
3 were partially achieved. P i l la r 5 supported reforms in each o f the social sectors. I t s objectives 
were t o (i) improve the governance, efficiency, quality, and equity o f the education system; (ii) 
improve the governance, financial sustainability, quality o f service delivery, access to the health 
care system; (iii) improve the administration and targeting o f disability bene f i ts and empower the 
disabled t o integrate in to society; (iv) ensure successful implementation o f pension reform; (v) 
improve the effectiveness o f social assistance programs; and (v i ) reduce institutionalization o f 
children through community-based initiatives. A PHRD grant financed technical assistance in t h e 
areas addressed by P i l la r 5 . 

69 . 
I n the education sector, the main achievement of the P A L program was the 
implementation of reforms to improve equity. These included the strengthening o f policies to 
increase opportunities fo r children from poor families and ethnic minorities, integration o f 
disadvantaged groups (particularly Roma children) in to primary and secondary education, and 
integration o f children w i t h special needs into mainstream schools. Building on efforts under 
earlier P A L S t o increase incentives fo r 
school attendance fo r children f rom 
poor families, the Government further 
strengthened social benefits, including 
provision o f f r e e textbooks t o a l l 
primary school children, introducing 
school feeding in primary schools, and 
p rov id ing transportation 
to enable 
children f rom remote ru ra l areas to 
attend school. The monthly ch i ld 
allowance 
benefit was made 
conditional on school attendance b y 
eligible school-age children starting 
f rom the school year 2002-03. As a

result, school non-attendance rates for among 7-18 year olds from the poorest quintile f e l l by 20 
percentage points between 2001 and 2003. (MTHS, 2003) But while t h e gap between poor and 
non-poor enrollment has narrowed, especially at the primary school level, i t remains s ign i f ican t at 
the secondary and te r t ia ry levels, with gaps o f 38.7 and 3 1.9 percentage points, respectivelf. 
In 
addition, education sector actions supported by the PAL program were not sufficiently robust to 
address the governance, efficiency, and quality o f the educational system, particularly at the 
tertiary level. (See Table 6 and Figure 8.) Quality outcomes were not in terms o f improved 
curricula but increased public expenditure on education as a percentage o f GDP to align with that 
o f OECD countries, not taking account o f Bulgaria’s shrinking school-age cohort or f isca l 
constraints stemming from the CBA. And efficiency outcomes were in terms o f higher student- 
teacher ratios rather than the overall budget system and cost s truc ture o f the education system, 
including administration and schools. 

70. 
The first o f a three-phase Education Modernization APL, designed under the 
previous CAS but ongoing during the implementation o f PAL I reforms, was very broad in 
scope. 
It aimed to enhance both quality and efficiency at the primary, secondary, and tertiary 
levels. Components included introduction o f a new curriculum and student assessment system, 
new teaching approaches, and more e f f ic ien t resource use. The scope o f objectives proved to be 
too ambitious, given that (i) the Government’s implementation capacity was severely compromised 
by high turnover both at the highest level in the Ministry o f Education and in the Project 
Coordination Unit, and (ii) public and political support for education reform was not sufficiently 
developed. Two-thirds o f the loan amount was cancelled when the loan closed in March 2004, the 
subsequent two APLs in the series were dropped, and the ICR as well as IEG’s ICR Review rated 
achievement o f project outcomes as unsatisfactory. 

71, 
Some but not all desired outcomes in the health sector were achieved under the PA L 
program. T h e Government increased the share o f the Ministry o f Health’s operating budget going 
to national public health programs, and health outcomes for l i f e expectancy, infant mortality, polio 
immunization rates, and incidence o f tuberculosis improved. (See Box 1 .) The National Assembly 
enacted amendments to the Health Act allowing for earmarking o f 1 percent o f the tobacco excise 
tax to fund t h e national tobacco control program, and legislation to harmonize tobacco control and 
regulations with EU directives. The National Health Insurance Fund’s administrative costs were 3 
percent of i t s total expenditures in 2004, in line with t h e PAL program goal, and a National Health 
Map was updated. As with the education sector, the PAL program’s health sector benchmarks 
(some o f which were in terms o f developing a strategy, preparation o f standards, and launching o f 
ministry restructuring) did not go far enough to ensure achievement o f objectives. The re are s t i l l 
outstanding issues in the health sector that need to be addressed in order for Bulgaria to attain 
health care quality and efficiency o f EU standards. The country i s far behind the EU in dealing 
with the ownership and management o f hospitals, financial sustainability o f i t s health insurance 
system in view o f i t s growing arrears, managing demand for healthcare services, defining the role 
and development o f private supplementary health insurance, and defining the role o f social 
assistance in health care. 

72. 
The Health Sector Reform loan, under implementation since the previous CAS, i s 
financing investments and technical assistance aimed at improving access to quality health 
services and ensuring their financial and operational sustainability. Two-thirds o f the loan 
proceeds a r e financing information technology and related training. Successful implementation i s 
dependent on the pace o f the health sector reforms i t i s designed to support. (See para. 128.) The 
new CPS includes development policy loans (DPLs) to support health sector reforms, which should 
improve the likelihood that this investment loan w i l l achieve i t s objectives.

Page 28 o f 46 
Actions to improve targeting o f disability benefits and promote social integration o f 
the disabled were successfully implemented under the PAL program. Legislation was enacted 
to disallow disability benefits to those over retirement age and therefore eligible to receive 
pensions, and to establish a frameworks for improved disability needs assessments to facilitate 
integration into the labor force and society, as well as for fraud detection and accountability o f 
medical practitioners. 

74. 
Reform measures supported by the PAL program to further develop a multi-pillar 
pension system were also successfully implemented. Legislation was enacted to establish a 
benefits indexation formula, including maximum and minimum benefits, as well as contribution 
rates with a timetable for changing the ratio o f employer to employee contributions from 70:30 in 
2005 to 5 0 5 0 in 2009. As a result, f isca l sustainability o f the pension system has been 
strengthened, and there i s greater predictability for beneficiaries, contributors, and investors, 
although some concerns regarding long-term sustainability remain. PAL benchmarks were 
informed by the Policy Note on Bulgarian Pension Legislation (FY04). 

75. 

Reforms supported by the PAL program to improve the coverage and targeting o f the 
Guaranteed Minimum Income (GMI) benefits, child allowances, and energy subsidies in view 
o f tariff increases resulted in positive trends, but further progress i s needed, especially in the 
targeting o f child allowances. GM I and energy subsidy coverage increased 2.7 and 2.5 times, 
respectively from 2001 to 2003. Over the same period, the share o f funds channeled to t h e poorest 
quintile increased from 60 percent to 75 percent for GMI, and from 47 percent to 54 percent for 
energy subsidies. The share o f child allowances going to the poorest quintile increased from 20 to 
3 5 percent, while the share going to the r iches t two quintiles f e l l from 40 percent to 23 percent. 

76. 

The PAL program also supported enactment and implementation o f legislation to 
shift to family and community-based alternatives to institutional care o f children. These 
changes are being implemented over several years, with desired outcomes defined for 2007. W h i l e 
there a re improvements at the margin in terms o f inter alia the number o f institutions (3.5 percent 
drop from 2001 to 2003) and the number o f institutionalized children (9.5 percent drop over the 
same period), i t i s too early to assess the adequacy o f progress. The Child Welfare loan 
(cofinanced by the EU PHARE program, the UK, and Japan) was in the previous CAS program 
and has complemented the PAL component addressing this issue, by financing inter a l i a capacity 
building i n monitoring and evaluation, public awareness and training campaigns, daycare centers 
and other community-based services for children from families at risk, and services for s tree t 
children. With a prolonged implementation period, it was in the portfolio during the FY03-FY05 
CAS and i s due to close at the end o f FY06. As o f mid-2005 the project indicators were on track 
toward desired outcomes, in terms o f absolute as well as rate reduction in child institutionalization, 
with a dramatic increase in the number o f children from high-risk communities benefiting from 
pre-school services. As with a number o f other investment loans, insu f f ic ien t implementing agency 
budget allocation for counterpart funding has been a major source o f implementation delay. T h e 
loan was complemented by an associated Japan Social Development Fund (JSDF) grant which 
supported community-based child development programs in disadvantaged ethnic minority 
communities and, significantly, has triggered the introduction o f an obligatory pre-school year for 
a l l six year-olds nationwide. 

77. 

The Social Investment and Employment Promotion (SIEP) loan aims to improve the 
standard o f living o f those locked in persistent “pockets” o f poverty in Bulgaria: certain 
regions, the long-term unemployed, and specific ethnic minorities (Roma and Turkish, in 
particular). With two interventions, the project addresses their social exclusion, weak social 
capital, poor access to markets and basic services, low employment, and low income. These 
interventions are the (i) Community Infrastructure for Development Initiative, to finance 

Annex C 
Page 29 o f 46 
development investments identified and managed by such communities themselves; and (ii) the 
Bulgarian Active Labor Market Initiative to facilitate employment creation for disadvantaged 
individuals i n poor communities. Progress against development objectives and indicators thus far 
has been positive, but slower than planned. 
I n the f i r s t three years o f a planned five-year 
implementation period, less than one-half o f the loan has been disbursed, mainly due to insufficient 
implementing agency budget allocation for counterpart funding under the Bulgarian National 
Budget framework. 

B. Exogenous Factors 

78. 
There were a number o f exogenous factors that contributed to the achievement o f the 
CAS outcomes, with the prospect o f EU accession first and foremost among them. Bulgaria’s 
being on the EU accession track gave i t s political leaders the incentive as well as the justification 
for implementing difficult reforms needed to meet EU requirements. When in May 2003 the EU 
set a tentative accession date o f January 1, 2007, this added momentum to the ongoing accession 
negotiations. Joining NATO in March 2004 further spurred this momentum, as the Government 
and the Bulgarian population considered NATO membership a precursor to EU membership. With 
this tangible external encouragement, the pace o f implementation o f reforms called for in the EU’s 
Regular Reports, i n line with accession requirements, accelerated as reflected i n the s ign i f ican t 
reforms achieved during the CAS period under Pillars 1-4 o f the PAL program. By contrast, 
however, in those sectors not as specifically addressed by EU accession requirements, the pace o f 
reform was slower (e.g., education and health under Pillar 5), as the lack o f external pressure meant 
less political w i l l and popular consensus. 

79. 
Bulgaria’s momentum f o r reform was also due in part to coordinated external 
support, in particular from the Bank and IMF. Support for s truc tura l reforms in the two 
institutions’ respective PAL and SBA programs was designed to be mutually reinforcing and 
complementary. (See Attachment G.) Reform progress was most significant where Bulgaria’s 
three primary external partners - the EU, the IMF, and the Bank - were closely aligned in the 
policies and programs they supported. External support was also coordinated with IFIs (e.g., 
EBRD) and bilateral partners (e.g., USAID, DFID, and The Netherlands). (See Attachment H.) 

80. 

A third important factor contributing to the achievement of the CAS outcomes was 
the legacy of Bulgaria’s financial c r i s i s o f 1996-1997. The CBA, in place since the c r is is and 
until Bulgaria joins the Euro zone (likely sometime between July 1, 2009 and January 1, 2010), 
imposed a strong discipline on macroeconomic management, and this created a relatively stable 
macroeconomic environment in which to be implementing sectoral reforms. 

C. Ro le o f Partners 

8 1 . 

Development partners played an important r o l e in CAS program implementation and 
achievement of the CAS outcomes o f growth and reduction o f poverty and unemployment. 
They have actively supported the PAL program as well as individual investment operations, as 
summarized in Attachment H. 

82. 

Japanese PHRD grants played a critical role by funding analytical work and 
technical assistance that helped build Government support for reforms. (See paras. 48,50,62, 
68, and 124.) This was especially important for the reform program, because as a matter o f policy 
Bulgaria does not borrow for technical assistance. 

83. 

Cooperation between the Bank and the IMF during the CAS period was strong. This 
cooperation was focused primarily on support of complementary structural and institutional 

Annex C 
Page 30 o f 46 
reforms. A 24-month Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) i n the amount o f SDR 240 million was 
approved by the IMF in February 2002 and extended to mid-March 2004 when i t was successfully 
concluded. This was followed by a 25-month precautionary SBA in the amount o f SDR 100 
million, approved by the IMF in August 2004. The SBA programs have focused on medium-term 
fiscal challenges and s truc tura l reforms with s ign i f ican t macroeconomic, notably fiscal, 
implications. Attachment G shows the close complementarity between structural and institutional 
reforms supported by the PALS and those specified in the Government’s Memoranda o f Economic 
Policies (including Supplementals) under the two SBAs. 
This coordination contributed 
significantly to the successful completion o f the reform programs being supported by the Bank and 
the resulting achievement o f the CAS outcomes. 

84 . 
The EU played an important r o l e in the achievement o f the CAS outcomes through its 
large pre-accession grant programs and its annual Regular Reports. Both the PHARE and 

ISPA programs contributed to the achievement o f higher growth by supporting investments in basic 
infrastructure. Aimed at the modernization o f agriculture and ru ra l development, SAPARD funds 
helped address unemployment and poverty levels, both o f which have been higher in r u r a l areas. 
The EU’s continuous monitoring and public disclosure o f conclusions in its Regular Reports kept 
the pressure on the Government to make further progress in meeting the political and economic 
c r i te r ia and acquis requirements for accession, including i n areas directly relevant to the CAS. 
(See Table 2.) 

8 5 . 

Government-led partner coordination during the CAS period was a daunting task, 

given (i) t h e large amounts o f pre-accession grant funds and other partner financing to be 
coordinated, and (ii) the Government’s constrained capacity to undertake i t and lack o f a champion 
for such an initiative. In Apr i l 2002, shortly before the FY03-FY05 CAS was finalized, the f i r s t 
Government-led partner coordination meeting was held in Sofia, chaired by one o f the Deputy 
Prime M in is te rs . A t the meeting a new coordination mechanism was established with the aim o f 
maximizing effective absorption o f partner assistance, organized into four priority areas aligned 
with the Government’s priorities: (i) business climate; (ii) l iv ing standards improvement; (iii) 
governance and public administration; and (iv) infrastructure and natural resources management. 
Various working groups were established in each o f these thematic areas, with each working group 
led by the relevant deputy minister and a development partner. Serving as secretariat, the Council 
of Ministers’ Directorate for European Integration and Relations with the I F I s established excellent 
working relationships with the partner community. 

86. 

The Bank was one o f the lead partners providing technical assistance to the Bulgarian 
Government to strengthen i t s partner coordination during the CAS period. With the 

Government’s introduction o f a new coordination mechanism in 2002, the Bank took on t h e role o f 
lead partner for four o f the Government’s working groups.23 The Bank also provided support and 
advice to the Partner Coordination Secretariat at the Council o f Ministers and continued i t s ongoing 
coordination with the EU, including jo in t meetings with the EC Delegation in Sofia, as well as with 
UNDP, to further enhance the coordination and integration o f programs. 

87. 

Implementation o f the Government-led coordination mechanism during its first year 

and a half was mixed. The mechanism i t s e l f was rather complicated, with many working groups 
but no binding administrative procedures to support it. I t suffered from insu f f ic ien t attention and 
ownership at senior levels, lack o f capacity at ministerial and central levels, and inadequate 
understanding and commitment at the level o f deputy ministers. As a result, the working groups 

~ 

23 Poverty/Social Sectorhlinority IssuedAccess to Health Services, Education and Culture, 
Agriculture/Forestry, and Energy. 

Annex C 
Page 3 1 o f 46 
did not make much progress. Despite this, information sharing and coordination among Bulgaria’s 
partners worked well. 

8 8 . 

Initial experience with the new Government-led partner coordination process 
prompted Government to l o o k f o r ways to enhance the mechanism and to make i t more 
effective. The Council o f M in is te rs , jointly with UNDP, developed a Development Cooperation 
Information System database to facilitate Government i n external assistance planning and 
coordination. The CEP adopted a decision which provides for updating the database on a regular 
basis. The working group arrangement continues to be in a state o f flux. Successful Government- 
led partner coordination w i l l require more high level attention within the Government, to ensure 
that Bulgaria i s able to make the best use o f the EU grant funds. 

D. Government’s’ Ro le 

89 . 

The Government played a critical ro le in the successful achievement o f the CAS 
outcomes. There were five key elements o f t h e Government’s role in connection with the PAL 
program, which was closely linked to the CAS outcomes: (i) coordination, (ii) participation and 
consultation, (iii) implementation, (iv) monitoring, and (v) communication. 

90 . 

Perhaps the most successful aspect o f the Government’s ro le in implementation o f the 
PAL program was the effective mechanism i t put in place to coordinate the comprehensive 
e f fo r t . During preparation o f PAL I the Government gave the Council for S truc tura l Policy, 
subsequently renamed the Council for Economic Policy (CEP), responsibility for coordination o f 
the PAL program. I t was chaired by the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister o f Economy and was 
under the decision-making body, the Council o f M i n i s t e r s . The CEP was comprised o f high-level 
representation from the l i n e ministries responsible for key s t ruc tu ra l reforms: the Deputy Prime 
Minister and Minister o f Labor and Social Policy, the Deputy Prime M in is te r and Minister o f 
Regional Development and Public Works, the Minister o f Finance, four other Ministers, two 
Deputy Ministers, and the Executive Directors o f the Privatization Agency and Foreign Investment 
Agency. Several committees were formed to focus on specific components o f reform. An eight- 
person team i n t h e Directorate for EU Integration and Relations with IFIs, under t h e Council o f 
M in is te rs , served as i t s secretariat and provided continuity despite a reshuffling o f the Cabinet i n 
July 2003. The EU Directorate staff collected information for tracking progress against the 
benchmarks in the PAL matrix for weeks prior to each PAL mission, accompanied the Bank’s PAL 
mission teams to meetings with the l i n e ministries, and ensured post-mission follow-up. 

91. 

As the PAL program was being developed and implemented, the Government 
consulted with the private sector and ensured i t s participation in a public dialogue on the 
reform program. The Government consulted private sector organizations such as the Chamber o f 
Commerce and Industry, the Industrial Association, and the Employers’ Association. I t established 
several public/private discussion fora, including the Council on Economic Growth and the Tax 
Council. 

92 . With strong Government ownership and commitment to reform, implementation o f 
the PAL program was completed on a timely basis, with the exception o f the Bulgartabak 
privatization which was shifted from PA L I to the trigger for P A L 11 second tranche release. 
(See para. 105.) Borrower performance was rated highly satisfactory for PAL I in the ICR as well 
as IEG’s ICR Review. In light o f the Government’s failure to privatize Bulgartabak or implement 
labor market reforms as envisioned at the outset o f the PAL program, the IEG ICR Review 
downgraded the PAL I 1 ICR rating o f borrower performance from highly satisfactory to 
satisfactory, in l i n e with IEG’s guidelines disallowing highly satisfactory ratings if all covenants 
and commitments are not fully met. 

93. 

Annex C 
Page 32 o f 46 
The Government put in place a number o f feedback mechanisms f o r timely tracking 
o f progress toward PAL outcomes. These mechanisms included the Administrative and 
Regulatory Cost Survey (ARCS), the Living Standards Survey, and the Judicial System Survey. A 
jo in t EBRD/World Bank Enterprise Survey was also used. T h e Labor Standards Measurement 
Survey (LSMS) Un i t in the National Statistical I n s t i t u t e and the Poverty Monitoring Unit i n the 
Ministry o f Labor and Social Policy monitored progress as well. 

94. 

A second weak element o f the Government’s ro l e in the context o f the PAL program 
was its public communication effort. Believing that democratic elections ensured su f f ic ien t 
engagement with stakeholders, the Government did not give enough priority to communications 
strategies or public information campaigns i n support o f the reform program. The Bank made a 
strong effort to help build capacity in this regard, including with an IDF grant, but without a high- 
level champion, the effort was not successful. Funding for such activities was not systematically 
included in l i n e ministries’ budgets. The resulting lack o f understanding o f the reform program 
and the public’s expectations for a rapid increase in the standard o f living, fueled by the prospect o f 
EU accession, led to the electorate’s frustration and eventually a change o f government, despite the 
impressive achievements under the PAL program. 

95. While much o f the achievement o f CAS outcomes i s linked to the Government’s 
successful implementation o f the PAL program, Bulgaria would likely be better positioned 
f o r post-accession convergence, had the Government implemented more o f the investment 
lending program with equal success. 
(See paras. 115-129 for discussion o f investment loan 
portfolio and pipeline issues. See also para. 140.) 
Implementation o f a number o f loans in the 
portfolio has been significantly delayed, in part due to weak capacity, high turnover, and 
insu f f ic ien t counterpart funding reflecting a lack o f ownership (in some instances, resistance to 
reforms), particularly o f loans prepared with the previous government under the previous CAS. In 
addition, much o f the CAS investment lending pipeline was dropped due to lack o f Government 
ownership. This partly r e f l e c t s l e s s o f a sense o f urgency and pressure on the Government to 
reform in areas not immediately relevant to accession and therefore where the EU was less directly 
engaged. By contrast, implementation o f RARP, which was prepared during the CAS period and i s 
well aligned with the EU agenda, i s proceeding well. 

E. Sustainability o f CAS Outcomes 

96. With widespread political support fo r Bulgaria to continue i t s progress toward 
accession in January 2007, sustainability of the CAS outcomes i s likely. T h e prospect o f EU 
membership clearly motivated the NMSS-led Government, as well as the preceding and succeeding 
Governments, to stay t h e course with an accession-oriented reform agenda aimed at private sector- 
led growth, poverty reduction, and employment creation. Political support for success fu l EU 
integration a f ter accession i s also likely, such that i t i s expected that future governments w i l l 
continue to stay the course with reforms post-accession. This political support i s partly based on 
the public’s perception that EU membership w i l l bring economic stability and w i l l therefore 
prevent another economic crisis. However, to the extent there are political risks to sustainability, 
more effective government communications on the reform program would help to mitigate them. 

97. 

I n addition, the CAS outcomes are likely to be sustainable because the structural and 
macroeconomic reforms implemented to achieve them were fo r the most part deep and 
systemic. They were generally effected through the enactment o f legislation by Parliament (as 
opposed to Government decrees or ordinances), affer a painstaking review process by multi-party 
Parliamentary commissions, which makes the laws difficult to reverse or amend. The legislation 
was typically followed by regulations that were then implemented. As a result, t h e overall policy 
environment has changed, such that reversal i s unlikely. Bulgaria’s prudent macroeconomic 

Annex C 
Page 33 o f 46 
management and the resulting stability also fac i l i ta tes sustainability o f the structural reforms that 
have led to achievement o f the CAS outcomes. One exception, however, i s the Government’s 
Active Labor Market Program, which provides shorter-term oriented interventions to address the 
longer term challenge o f increasing employment within an aging population with skills gaps vis-&- 
vis the EU labor market in which Bulgaria w i l l be competing more intensely post-accession. 

98. 
A third factor contributing to the sustainability o f CAS outcomes i s the 
institutionalization o f an effective coordination and monitoring mechanism within the 

Government’s structure. Originally established by the previous government inter alia to carry 
out these functions during implementation o f the PAL program, the Council for Economic Policy 
remains in place as an active tool o f the Council o f M in is te rs for coordinating and monitoring the 
curren t government’s program. 

99. 
Fourth, Bulgaria’s partnership with the Bank during the next CPS period should 
contribute to the sustainability o f CAS outcomes. Bank support i n the areas o f Bulgaria’s 

unfinished reform agenda (e.g., education, labor market, and health reform) can help sustain 
momentum for reforms aimed at EU accession and post-accession convergence with member 
states. 

100. Finally, Bulgaria’s continued partnership with the Bank during the next CPS period 
should contribute to the sustainability o f CAS outcomes. Bank support in the areas of 

Bulgaria’s unfinished reform agenda (e.g., education, labor market, and health reform) should help 
sustain momentum for reforms aimed at EU accession and post-accession convergence and 
competitiveness with member states. 

V. Bank Performance 

10 1. 
The Bank’s overall performance in supporting the achievement o f the CAS outcomes 
and supporting CAS and PAL themes was satisfactory. 

I t s performancg with regard to 
promoting competitive private-sector led growth (Theme 1 ) and strengthening public 
administration and anti-corruption initiatives (Theme 2 ) was highly satisfactoly, while i t was 
moderately unsatisfactory with regard to investing in human capital and strengthening social 
protection (Theme 3). 

A. Quality 

102. The design o f the PA L program was complex and multi-sectoral, with 31 triggers and 
232 benchmarks and actions taken by many ministries and agencies across a wide range o f 

sectors. However, the Bank team took into account a number o f factors that mitigated the risks o f 
this complexity, and in the end 28 o f the 3 1 program triggers articulated at the outset o f the PAL 
program were completely fu l f i l led . One factor was strong macroeconomic management 
throughout t h e program, in part due to continuation o f the Currency Board Arrangement (CBA) in 
place s ince the financial c r i s i s o f 1996-1997. A second factor was strong government ownership o f 
and commitment to the PAL-supported reforms, aligned with Bulgaria’s EU accession agenda. 
Third, the multi-sector PAL instrument was an effective vehicle for inter-ministerial coordination 
o f reforms within a coalition government. Fourth, there was strong complementarity between the 
PAL program and the IMF program. 
(See Attachment G . ) This alignment among three o f 
Bulgaria’s key development partners gave the PAL program added credibility and leverage. And 
fifth, specific outcomes for measuring progress toward overall program outcomes over the th ree - 
year period were built into the policy framework. 

Annex C 
Page 3 4 o f 46 
103. 
Following a series o f SECALs during the previous CAS period when the focus was on 
stabilization following the financial crisis, the flexibility afforded by the P A L instrument was 
better suited to bringing about structural reform across multiple sectors. The PAL program 
was informed by these predecessor sector reform operations, as well as by a number o f Bank 
studies and reports (e.g., the FSAP, Poverty Assessment, Public Expenditure and Institutional 
Review, Issues i n Intergovernmental Relations, and three Poverty and Social Impact Analyses24). 
Throughout the P A L program, the full Country Team was actively engaged - indeed, 
i t was the P A L Team. Critical to the effort was the role played by the Country Office staff, i n 
terms o f substance based on their local knowledge as well as day-to-day coordination with 
Bulgarian counterparts. 

104. 

105. The Bank’s performance in PAL I was rated highly satisfactory i n the I C R and in 
IEG’s ICR Review, while both gave a rating of satisfactory to P A L II. One reason for the 
lower rating o f PAL I1 was the way the Bank handled the condition related to t h e privatization o f 
Bulgartabak. (See para. 92 . ) When the privatization met with political and market constraints 
during PAL I, i t was shifted to PAL I1 which accordingly was split into two tranches to allow more 
time. The condition called for the privatization outcome, which i s subject to political and market 
forces beyond a government’s control, rather than the execution o f an appropriate privatization 
process. And as noted earlier, the market significance o f this particular privatization had 
significantly diminished over time, especially in relation to over-performance with other 
privatizations. The Bank should have taken these factors into account i n the design o f PAL 11. 

106. 
There were three additional weaknesses in the Bank’s design and implementation of 
the P A L program, all o f which relate to Theme 3, which accounts f o r this report’s moderately 
unsatisfactory rating of Bank performance. One was the lack o f poverty monitoring data with 
which to gauge progress against the CAS and PAL outcome o f poverty reduction. The 
Government’s shift to an EU-oriented methodology was not unexpected, and to ensure 
comparability with the Bank’s previous poverty data using i t s preferred consumption-based 
methodology, the CAS should have included a Poverty Assessment to be conducted at the end o f 
the CAS and PAL periods. 

107. A second weakness was the backloading to P A L III of politically difficult reforms in 
the social sectors (labor market in Pillar 2 and education and health i n Pillar S), thereby 
putting them on a collision course with an election year and making them even less politically 
viable, In the end, the Bank did not define the benchmarks for education and health as rigorously 
as needed (see paras. 69 and 7 I), and compensating for the downgrading o f the politically difficult 
Labor Code amendment trigger by upgrading an important, but less politically difficult action 
related to business environment, diminished the outcome o f Pillar 2. The social sector reforms 
would likely have been implemented more successfilly, had they been included more consistently 
throughout the PAL program, rather than held for PAL 111. Building support and consensus for 
them takes time, as does their implementation. I t i s important to allow su f f ic ien t time a sustained 
effort for this during a government’s tenure. 

108. 

The third weakness relates to the CAS more broadly, as well as to the P A L program. 
Increasing the labor force participation ra te should have been made an explicit CAS and PAL 
outcome, to focus the reform effort more directly on Bulgaria’s exceptionally low labor force 
participation. This would have reinforced achievement o f Bulgaria’s goals o f private sector-led 

24 These analyses assessed the poverty and social impact o f privatization o f Bulgartabak on tobacco farmers, 
restructuring o f the railway sector, and energy pricing. 

Annex C 
Page 35 o f 46 
growth and employment creation. A stud? conducted for the 2002 Poverty Assessment flagged 
low labor force participation as an issue, which was then highlighted in the PAL I Program 
Document. But neither the CAS nor the PAL took this on as an explicit outcome and instead 
focused on reducing unemployment and long-term unemployment. Although total and long-term 
unemployment declined during the CAS period, this did not make a significant dent i n Bulgaria’s 
low labor force participation ra te which, notwithstanding an increase o f 4.3 percentage points from 
2002 to 2005, still remains very low at only slightly above one-half (52.7 percent). Experience has 
shown that growth alone i s not a su f f ic ien t antidote. Labor market reforms are needed as well. 

109. 

There were no Quality at Entry Assessments o f the three investment loans prepared 
during the CAS period. During CAS implementation the Social Investment and Employment 
loan (see para. 77) was rated satisfactory until la te FY05, when the implementation progress rating 
was downgraded to moderately satisfactory due to insufficient implementing agency budget 
allocation for counterpart funding that halted project spending less than half-way through 2005 .26 
The Revenue Administration Reform loan (see para. 64) has performed especially well, with highly 
satisfactory and satisfactory ratings. Nearly a l l procurement procedures have been completed. The 
D i s t r i c t Heating project (see para. 47) has had satisfactory ratings s ince it became effective in 2003. 
The GEF Energy Efficiency project, approved three months before the end o f the CAS period, i s 
o f f to a promising s tar t , with the Government having made i t s f i l l contribution o f US$2 million in 
seed capital.

development. Ratings o f Bank performance shown in Table 8 above correlate with project impact,

Three investment loans prepared during the previous CAS are s t i l l under

completed, has consistently been rated satisfactory. See para. 128 regarding implementation issues 
with the Health Sector Reform and Registration and Cadastre loans. One GEF operation, Wetlands

implementation. (See para. 53.) During the f i r s t three years o f implementation, disbursement was 
relatively slow due to cumbersome, centralized contract approval procedures and lack o f consensus 
among stakeholders regarding the wetlands restoration component. B y the end o f the CAS period, 
the project was rated moderately unsatisfactory on development objectives as well as 
implementation progress grounds. An upcoming Midterm Review may lead to restructuring.

112. QAG’s Country AAA Assessment found the quality o f the delivered Bulgaria AAA 
program to be satisfactory overall, and specifically in terms o f strategic relevance, internal 
quality, likely impact, and Bank inputs and processes. QAG ‘assessed ten o f 32 AAA tasks 

completed during FY02-FY04. O f these ten, i t found e i g h t to be satisfactory, one highly 
satisfactory, and one marginally satisfactory. 

, 

113 . A number o f AAA tasks were added to the program, many o f them frontloaded in the 
first tw o years o f the CAS period, and were a timely, effective response to new opportunities. 

Technical assistance in debt management i s one such example. (See Box 2.) This was added to the 
program at the request o f the Ministry o f Finance early i n the CAS period and was highly valued 
by the client, such that a fee-based arrangement was launched in la te 2003. T h e Bank team was 
comprised o f s ta f f from i t s Treasury, Legal Finance and Accounting Loan Client and Financial 
Services units. This inter-disciplinary team carried out i t s work i n cooperation with the IMF, as 
well as with the EU to ensure coherence with the ongoing PHARE programs and to help the 
Bulgarian authorities move towards standard E U practice. A number o f infrastructure studies2’ 
were added to the program as well, several o f which were done quickly at the request o f the 
Government as it weighed investment needs and financing alternatives for the roads sector. An 
especially s ign i f ican t addition to the CAS program was the Bank’s techn ica l advice and support i n 
connection with the launch o f the Decade o f the Roma, which focused more attention on policy 
i s s u e s and dialogue related to social inclusion o f Roma communities.

Page 37 o f 46 
114. While the QAG AAA Assessment found that the Government had a high regard fo r 
the Bank’s analytical and advisory work, i t also flagged a number o f weaknesses: (i) 
inadequate attention to the reality o f implementation issues in view o f capacity constraints, when 
making policy recommendations; (ii) a striking disparity between the sustained macroeconomic 
and infrastructure sector dialogue based on robust analytical work on the one hand, and a dearth o f 
A A A to sustain dialogue in the health and education sectors on the other; and (iii) a tendency on 
the part o f the Bank to gear i t s AAA work to macroeconomic issues while crowding out important 
sector work. I n addition, QAG found that several pieces o f AAA were supply-driven and therefore 
lacking i n c l ien t ownership. A case in point was the CPAR, given that Bulgaria’s procurement 
reforms were entirely geared to compliance with EU standards. As a result, the Bank waived the 
CAS base case trigger calling for implementation o f the action plan developed in the previous 
CPAR. QAG also cited a lack o f integration among the three fiduciary reports completed during 
CAS implementation (the CPAR, CFAA, and PEIR). QAG’s rating o f the AAA program’s 
coherence and integration was therefore marginally satisfactory. The QAG report also concluded 
that while the PEIR and Poverty Assessment2’ (both o f which were delivered in FY02) were 
exceptions, for the most part dissemination beyond non-official stakeholders was a weakness in the 
A A A program, with the development impact o f t h e Bank’s AAA therefore falling short o f its 
potential. QAG therefore rated the A A A program’s dissemination unsatisfactory, and concluded 
that while this was understandable due to Bulgarian public officials’ top-down management 
approach and Bank budget constraints, i t should be explicitly addressed in the delivery o f the AAA 
program o f the next CAS. I t should be noted, however, that the Survey on Rural Development 
Needs was successfully disseminated through a well received workshop and publication. 

B. Dialogue and Portfolio Management 

115 . 
The Bank’s country dialogue during the CAS period was mixed. On the one hand, the 
Bank enjoyed a favorable reputation for i t s technical expertise and international knowledge, as 
evident from Client Survey Results (see paras. 135-138 and Attachment I) as well as stakeholder 
and counterpart interviews held by QAG, CAS Completion Report, and PAL I11 ICR missions. 
The QAG AAA Assessment rated dialogue as satisfactory. Policy dialogue on Themes 1 and 2, for 
which the Bank’s main counterpart was the Ministry o f Finance, was substantive and fruitful. On 
the other hand, there were a number o f areas in which the Bank’s dialogue was difficult, mainly 
where line ministries were the primary counterpart. As a result, one year 
into CAS 
implementation, the sector investment lending program was dropped, while the Bank’s PAL 
program and associated AAA were proceeding as planned and achieving objectives. 

116. Dialogue over the CAS investment lending program was difficult. As noted ear l ier , t h e 
Government wanted a much higher share o f adjustment lending than was acceptable to Bank 
management due to IBRD exposure considerations. In addition, for political reasons there was a 
lack o f consensus within the Government, especially between the Ministry o f Finance and the 
Ministry o f Agriculture, regarding the Bank program in the agriculture and rural sectors. One 
month after the Board discussion o f the CAS i n mid-2002, the Minister o f Agriculture asked that 
the Rural Finance loan be replaced with a Rural Development loan. The Bank agreed to this 
change and undertook a Rural Development Assessment to underpin the loan. Early in preparation, 
the Bank proposed several options, including an innovative sector-wide approach (SWAP) to 
facilitate the Government’s accessing SAPARD funds by financing the needed counterpart 

28 Although the FY02 PEIR and FY02 Poverty Assessment were disseminated very e f fec t ive ly (including 
through the inclusion o f the Poverty Assessment in OPCPD’s Bankwide information disclosure pilot) several 

months a f ter the FY03-FY05 CAS was launched, their impact i s not assessed in this report because they were 
in the previous CAS program and were prepared and delivered to the Government during the previous CAS 
period. 

Annex C 
Page 3 8 o f 46 
funding. The Government opted for a SWAP with the possible inclusion o f a component focused 
on building capacity o f micro-finance institutions in ru ra l areas. Preparation continued until mid- 
2004, a turning point i n t h e CAS program dialogue. (See para. 124.) 

1 17. Early in the CAS period, portfolio performance was a cause o f concern. Six portfolio 
reviews were conducted during FY03-FY05. Continuing the semi-annual Joint Portfolio Review 
(JPR) cycle o f the previous CAS period, a mid-year JPR was done in the f a l l o f 2002, followed by 
a full JPR i n the spring o f 2003, and another mid-year JPR in the f a l l o f 2003. Following an 
agreement to shift to quarterly portfolio monitoring, additional reviews were done i n the spring and 
summer o f 2004, and a limited portfolio review was completed in October 2004. The Mid-Year 
Joint Portfolio Review (JPR) i n October 2002 concluded that while portfolio management had 
improved i n some respects (e.g., better alignment o f projects with Government priorities and 
strengthened coordination by the Council o f Ministers’ Directorate for EU Integration and 
Relations with the IFIs as well as by the IF1 Department o f the Ministry o f Finance), a number o f 
problems c i ted in the February 2002 JPR remained. These included slow decision-making 
processes resulting from coordination problems and, in some instances, insu f f ic ien t buy-in and 
disconnect between policy oversight and implementation. The resulting delays were reflected in 
slow disbursements. The 2002 Mid-Year JPR Report recommended that the Bank and Government 
jointly establish an outcome-based monitoring mechanism and capacity to ,ensure alignment o f 
current and planned projects with the Government’s reform program and the Bank’s CAS. The 
report’s findings were discussed with the Council o f Ministers’ Directorate for EU Integration and 
Relations with the IFIs, with the Council for Structural Policy, and with the Council o f Ministers. 
Project oversight was intensified, with monthly meetings by the Council o f M in is te rs with Project 
Implementation Units (PIUS). 

118 . Despite efforts by the Bank and the Government to improve portfolio performance, 
the pace o f project implementation slowed further. T h e JPR Report o f March 2003 cited 
continuation o f the problems cited a year earlier, as well as issues with capacity and continuity in 
project management, budget planning to ensure sufficient allocations for counterpart funding o f 
project implementation, and partner coordination on multi-partner projects. By end-FY03 the 
disbursement ratio had declined to 15.2 percent. (See Table I O . ) Specific actions were agreed for 
improving implementation o f individual projects, and plans were put in place to address the generic 
portfolio issues, including through the establishment o f outcome-based monitoring systems at the 
project level.

119. 
The Bank’s Mid-Year Portfolio Review o f October 2003 called for the Government to 
address continued poor portfolio performance. The review found that the generic issues flagged 
i n previous portfolio reviews continued to persist, with the resu l t that nearly a l l active projects were 
experiencing implementation delays, some by as much as two years. A t any given time during the 
CAS period, one or two o f four projects2’, out o f an investment portfolio o f eight to ten investment 
projects, were showing problems with implementation and/or achievement o f development 
objectives. As a result, one or both o f the portfolio performance triggers for the CAS base case 
was not met during t h e f i r s t two o f the th ree FYs o f the CAS. (Bank management decided to waive 
these triggers in view o f Bulgaria’s strong performance vis-a-vis the other 12 base case triggers, 
especially those for s truc tura l reforms supported by the PAL program.) 

120. 
I n December 2003, the Government responded that poor portfolio performance was 
largely due to problems with the Bank’s procedures during preparation and implementation. 
They believed that (i) a number o f investment loans were no longer in line with current government 
priorities due to long preparation periods and insufficient flexibility i n investment project des ign 
compared with the PAL instrument (Le., benchmarks for successor PALS may be changed prior to 
their approval at the Board, and procurement r u l e s do not apply because funds are for budget 
support); and (ii) implementation periods were unrealistic, given the time required for Bank 
approval o f procurement procedures and the time required for c iv i l works. Actively working to 
reduce Bulgaria’s debt, the Government noted that implementation delays were costly due to the 
additional commitment fees. They also criticized the Bank’s PIU model for not building 
sustainable project management capacity and called for a review o f the s truc ture o f Bank assistance 
to Bulgaria, including consideration o f approaches involving budget support and implementation 
arrangements aimed at building sustainable capacity. W h i l e acknowledging some serious 
management errors on its part, the Government considered the objectives o f the Education 
Modernization loan too ambitious and complex and called for i t s cancellation, and for pursuing the 
sector policy dialogue through the ongoing PAL program. 

121. 

I n response to the Government’s observations, the Bank agreed to cancel the 
Education Modernization loan. The ICR and IEG’s ICR Review concurred in their 
unsatisfactory ratings o f this project. While design and preparation were considered satisfactory, 
this was quickly overtaken by unsatisfactory supervision (infrequent supervision and frequent 
turnover in the Bank’s Team Leader), combined with lack o f Government ownership, weak 
capacity, high turnover in project management, and ineffective oversight. After three and a h a l f 
years o f implementation, the loan was closed with two-thirds o f the loan amount cancelled. (See 
para. 70.) 

122. Also in response to the Government’s feedback, the Bank committed to some key 
actions to be jointly monitored and reviewed on a quarterly basis: (i) closely monitor potential 
problem projects in the portfolio, (ii) develop disbursement targets for March and June 2004 and 
monitor progress on a monthly basis, (iii) monitor turnaround times on procurement decision- 
making and approvals by both t h e Government and the Bank, (iv) include i n the planned Country 
Procurement Assessment Review (CPAR) recommendations for enhancing procurement capacity 
in support o f the Bank’s lending program, (v) reduce reliance on freestanding PIUs, and (vi) review 
proposals for 
fu tu re Bank-financed projects with simplified implementation, accelerated 
disbursement profiles (including through the use o f SWAPS), and leverage o f other resources, 
including EU grant funds.

Restoration and Pollution Reduction (GEF). 

Annex C

123. 
I t was about this time that the Government asked the Bank to convert the 
Community Services loan shown in the CAS to a Roads loan. In i t ia l dialogue over this issue 
was complicated for several reasons. One was that Bank management wanted to retain PHRD 
grant eligibility (which i s limited to loans included in CAS programs), and so was prepared to 
reorient the loan to a Community (Secondary) Roads project aimed at rehabilitation and 
maintenance for low-income communities. The Government wanted to consider other options as 
well, including investment to enhance i t s motonvay network in anticipation o f increased t ra f f ic 
associated with EU accession. Yet a Motonvays Study prepared by the Bank at t h e Government’s 
request concluded that t ra f f ic volume would not be high enough to generate a minimum 
satisfactory economic internal ra te o f return, and the Government challenged the underlying 
assumptions o f the analysis. Soon after these issues came to light, the Bank proposed a SWAP for 
this operation as well. The Bank’s proposing fast-disbursing SWAP’S for both the Rural 
Development and Community Services loans was an effort to respond to the Government’s 
feedback in December 2003 that Bank-financed projects needed to be prepared and implemented 
more quickly, with greater flexibility and less complexity. Toward the end o f the CAS period, the 
Bank prepared a Policy Note on Road Investment Financing Options (FYOS), which w i l l inform 
Bank support in the roads sector under the new CPS. 

124. Four loans were dropped from the pipeline in 2004. A second phase APL in the 
education sector was dropped in March, once the f i r s t phase loan was cancelled at the 
Government’s request due to poor performance. (See paras. 120-121 .) The proposed Forestry loan 
with an accompanying GEF grant was fully prepared and negotiated, when it was dropped in May 
due to political constraints (stemming from vested interests) to institutional reforms supported by 
the proposed loan. Preparation o f the Rural Development and Community Services loans was well 
advanced with support from PHRD g ran ts when i n June, without prior notice to the Bank, the 
Government decided not to approve s ta te borrowing for either project. The loans were eventually 
dropped, and the unused portion (US$969,300) o f the two associated approved PHRD grants (one 
o f which was not yet signed) totaling US$1.34 million was never disbursed. The Government’s 
decision was the outcome o f i t s making trade-offs, in light o f debt management considerations, 
among state loans and guarantees for various public investment priorities, including these two 
Bank loans and funding o f politically more important projects (e.g., Be lene nuclear power project). 
I n the end, two state guarantees were granted, one for construction o f the Calafat Bridge to 
Romania and the other for the Be lene nuclear plant. Political considerations underpinned this 
decision. By end-FY04 the disbursement ratio for Bulgaria had fa l len to an all-time low o f 9.7 
percent. 

125. With five partially prepared projects (four IBRD and one GEF) dropping out o f the 
lending program, the Bank incurred U S $ l million in “drop costs.” In the end, the Government 
declined any investment lending a f ter the f i r s t year o f CAS implementation, only three investment 
loans were delivered (vs. seven planned), and actual investment commitments were only 39 percent 
( U S $ I 18.4 million) o f the planned base case volume (US$300 million) and 22 percent o f total 
actual lending. The resulting 78 percent share o f adjustment lending exceeded the 60 percent 
ceiling Bank management had set due to exposure concerns during CAS discussions. However, 
Bulgaria’s active debt management program, particularly i t s buy-back o f Brady bonds, 
strengthened Bulgaria’s IBRD exposure indicators, such that in retrospect a 78 percent share o f 
adjustment lending might have been more acceptable. (See Table 11 .) A t the same time that the 
investment lending pipeline was drying up one year into the CAS period, the investment portfolio 
continued to be a cause for concern.

126. 
I n August 2004 (ten months before national elections) a joint high-level meeting was 
held in Plovdiv to discuss Bulgaria’s future engagement with the Bank. A number o f strategic 
directions emerged from the discussions: (i) while Bulgaria no longer has an external financing 
gap requiring Bank financing, Bank funds can play a u s e f b l role in debt management by 
substituting for more costly sources o f financing; (ii) the Government w i l l continue to value the 
Bank’s advice on the next generation o f reforms to accelerate growth and competitiveness, ensure a 
seamless entry into the EU, reduce poverty and regional disparities, and deepen reforms i n key 
sectors such as education and health; (iii) the PAL instrument i s highly valued, but fu tu re reforms 
may be best supported through single-pillar DPLs; (iv) there i s a critical need to support capacity 
building to improve management o f Bulgaria’s investment programs and improve absorption o f EU 
funds by harmonizing Bank support with Bulgaria’s increasingly EU-oriented procurement and 
financial management systems; (v) future investment loans need to focus on systemic solutions and 
as part o f a unified budget, move towards programmatic budget support, with shorter 
implementation periods and cofinancing o f SWAp’s by the Bank, EU, EBRD, and EIB; and (vi) 
Bank should collaborate with IFC and M IGA to fac i l i ta te public-private partnerships. 

127. 
To address the persistent portfolio problems, the Bank hired a retired Bank staff 
member from the ECA Region’s Quality Unit to undertake a review o f projects at risk o f not 
achieving their development objectives by their closing dates. The review, conducted in 
September 2004, was to consider cancellation o f any project components that could not be 
completed within one year a f te r closing dates. The resulting repo r t presented several options for 
each project at risk. The f i r s t option in each instance was to close the loan as scheduled and cancel 
the undisbursed proceeds, while the alternative options involved closing date extensions and some 
changes in approach, i n some instances through restructuring. When faced with the option o f 
cancelling, however, the Government opted not to do so (perhaps in light o f elections less than a 
year away) but to res t ruc tu re t h e projects. Most o f them subsequently demonstrated improved 
implementation performance and focus on achieving development objectives, and some even 
managed to make up for ear l ier delays. Through joint efforts and intensive monthly monitoring o f 
disbursements and implementation on a project-by-project basis, the average disbursement ratio 
nearly tripled in one year to 27.9 percent in FY05. 

128. 
Tw o o f the projects at risk were the Health Sector Reform loan and the Registration 
and Cadastre loan. The Health Sector Reform loan had a slow start due to delays in health sector 
reforms and consequently was rated unsatisfactory in meeting i t s development objectives during i t s 
early years. Although a QAG Assessment found project quality at entry satisfactory, the pace o f 
sector reform slowed considerably, particularly i n the area o f hospital restructuring. The loan was 
restructured at the end o f the CAS period to strengthen complementarity with health sector reforms 
under PAL I11 by increasing financing o f investments in hospital reform and the information 
system o f the National Hea l th Insurance Fund (NHIF). The Registration and Cadastre loan was 
problematic from the start more than four years ago and suffered from significant implementation 

Annex C 
Page 42 o f 46 
delays. A threat o f suspension was lifted shortly before the time o f this writing, after the new 
Government implemented actions that had been outstanding for several years and which would 
allow more rapid coverage o f the country with the cadastre map and property register. 
retrospect, the Bank should have issued a threat to suspend much earlier. In unsatisfactory status 
for nearly two years, this project i s now being restructured. Although a QAG Assessment found i t s 
quality at entry to be satisfactory, it appears that the project design, which requires cooperation 
among three ministries and several agencies, was too ambitious for the available administrative 
capacity and, as i t turned out, not supported by t h e Government that had been elected just four days 
before the loan was approved by the Bank’s Board. 

In 

129. 
I n sum, the Bank’s country dialogue met with varied results, The results were better 
on issues relating to s truc tura l reforms and ana ly t ica l work for which the Ministry o f Finance was 
the primary counterpart. The Bank’s dialogue on issues where the line ministries were the main 
counterpart was more problematic, as evidenced by the erosion o f the sector investment lending 
pipeline a f ter the f i r s t year o f CAS implementation. This disparity was due to fractious coalition 
dynamics within the Government, weaker capacity in a number o f line ministries, and despite 
energetic efforts by the Bank to strengthen the dialogue in mid-2004, the effect o f the looming June 
2005 elections. 

C. CAS Consultation Process 

130. 
I t was expected that the CAS would be completed shortly after the June 2001 
elections. I t was to serve as a roadmap for the Bank’s engagement with the new government over 
the next three fiscal years. The previous CAS had covered FY99-FYO 1. 

131. 
I n early 2001 members o f the Bank’s Country Team held CAS consultations through 
a series o f nine “town meetings” across Bulgaria at which a draft o f the CAS was discussed. 
I n all, there were more than 500 participants from local administrations, NGOs, the private sector, 
business associations, civic groups, and the Bulgaria offices o f development partners. Discussions 
were also held with the European Commission in Brusse ls , to coordinate assistance to be provided 
in support o f Bulgaria’s progress toward fu l l compliance with the requirements o f the acquis 
communautaire. To broaden the consultation process further, the draft CAS was posted on the 
Bank’s Bulgaria website. This generated a good deal o f interest, as more than 2,500 individuals 
and organizations visited the Bulgaria CAS website. 

132. 

Feedback during CAS consultations showed broad consensus with the Bank on needs 
and how to address them. Priority areas identified were decentralization, municipal finance, 
unemployment, HIV/AIDS, social safety net, SME development, ru ra l development, water quality, 
earthquake preparedness, and restructuring o f the coal, district heating, and railway sectors. 
However, stakeholders generally did not share the Bank’s views on needed reforms in the 
education and health sectors for cost effectiveness. They also did not share the Bank’s view that 
having supported a policy tkamework for efficient investment in the transport and water sectors, the 
Bank should leave financing o f such investments to EBRD and EIB, consistent with the ir 
institutional mandates. 

133. 
The Bank made some revisions to the CAS to take account o f the public consultations, 
and the revised draft was the basis fo r high-level discussions with the newly formed 
Government. The re was basic agreement between the Bank and the Government on t h e country’s 
priorities. There was also agreement on the Bank’s comparative advantage in support for urgent 
reform measures and public sector programs aimed at private sector development and improved 
social service delivery. This support would take the form o f the PAL program in the FY03-FY05 
CAS. 

Annex C 
Page 43 o f 46 

F o r a number o f reasons, i t was another year before the next CAS went to the Board. 

134. 
First, i t took the newly formed, somewhat fractious coalition Government some months to organize 
i t s e l f and engage with i t s partners. Second, given the urgency o f the EU agenda, the Government 
was focusing initially on i t s relationship with the EU and EC. Third, following the success fu l 
completion o f a Stand-By Arrangement by the previous Government i n June 2001, the new 
Minister o f Finance was keen to build on Bulgaria’s progress since the financial c r is is o f 1996- 
1997 and so focused on developing the next SBA program with the IMF. The Bank collaborated 
with the Government and the IMF in these discussions, which led to complementarity between the 
SBA and CAS programs (specifically the PAL program) and the structural reforms they supported. 
(See Attachment G.) The next SBA began in February 2002, and finalization o f the next CAS 
followed several months thereafter. But in hindsight, launching CAS preparation and consultations 
prior to the June 2001 elections was probably premature and may have weakened the new 
Government’s ownership o f the CAS program. 

D. Client Survey 

135 . A Client Survey was conducted in June 2005 as input to the preparation o f the CPS. 

The exercise consisted o f a quantitative survey o f stakeholders, to which there were 300 
respondents (84 percent response rate), and in-depth interviews with 32 public officials 
experienced i n working with the Bank and four focus groups on major themes o f Bank involvement 
(economic reform, education, health, and infrastructure). Respondents to the quantitative survey 
included high-level government officials, Parliamentarians, local government officials, multilateral 
and bilateral development partners, private sector organizations, NGOs, t h e media, academia, 
think-tanks, trade unions, the judiciary, and employees i n ministries, departments, and agencies. 
(See Attachment I.) 

136. Most respondents to the quantitative survey felt that the Bank should focus on 
economic growth and jobs, followed by infrastructure development, education, poverty 

reduction, and health sector issues. They ranked the Bank’s involvement in these areas higher 
than in EU integration, even though effective EU integration was viewed by stakeholders as 
Bulgaria’s top development priority . The feedback appears to prefer the Bank’s involvement in 
basic development areas, rather than EU integration per se. A t the same time, it was f e l t that the 
Bank should adjust i t s policies with the EU integration needs o f the country. Interestingly, the 
Bank’s financial resources were seen as the Bank’s greatest value, followed by i t s policy and 
economic advice, and ability to build implementation capacity. Disregard for country realities and 
bureaucratic operational policies and procedures were cited as the Bank’s greatest weaknesses. 

137. At the same time, perceptions o f Bank effectiveness were not always aligned with 
perceived priorities fo r future Bank involvement. The survey showed wider “impact gaps” in 

areas such as strengthening the health and education sectors. These impressions may be linked to 
the fairly well publicized implementation problems o f t h e Bank-financed investment projects in 
these sectors. While respondents ranked poverty reduction very high as a development priority, the 
rating o f the Bank’s positive impact on poverty reduction was quite low. The lack o f timely and 
comparable poverty data may be a factor in this perception. Similarly, while stakeholders 
identified greater transparency i n governance and strengthening o f the judicial system as c r i t ica l to 
EU integration, they did not see much positive impact in these areas on the part o f the Bank. This 
implies that if the Government wants the Bank’s assistance in these areas, more effective 
dissemination and communication could play an important role in increasing development impact. 
This i s in l ine with the findings o f the QAG Country A A A Assessment. 

138. 
The qualitative survey respondents stressed the 
importance o f the Bank’s 
involvement beyond EU accession and identified a number o f recommendations for 

Annex C 
Page 44 o f 46 
enhancing the Bank’s relevance in the future. These included: (i) a c l ien t relationship 
characterized by more partnership and dialogue that takes into account the views o f the 
Government, including on the need to address the social costs o f structural reforms; (ii) Bank 
support in the priority areas o f education, healthcare, in fras truc ture investments, and strengthening 
o f institutional and administrative capacity; and (iii) joint EU/Bank financing. 

A. 

R o l e o f CAS in Progress Toward Country Goal 

VI. CONCLUSIONS 

139. The additionality o f the CAS program i s an important consideration in assessing i t s 
impact on the achievement o f Bulgaria’s goal o f moving closer to EU accession by sustaining 
economic growth, reducing poverty, and creating employment. One could argue that the 
Government would have undertaken many o f the IBRD-supported reforms and investments i n any 
event, because they were aligned with Bulgaria’s EU accession agenda and because IBRD 
financing was not that important with the upgrading o f Bulgaria’s risk rating and the Government’s 
resulting enhanced access to capital markets. However, the consensus among consulted 
stakeholders, including government counterparts, on this question was that the Bank len t credibility 
to Bulgaria’s reform program and therefore played a direct ro le in the risk rating upgrade, and the 
PAL program in particular provided useful external pressure for politically difficult reforms, as 
well as an effective framework fo r mobilizing support and coordinating and monitoring 
implementation o f multi-sector reform for EU accession across a coalition government. The CAS 
program also provided support fo r reforms i n areas the specifics o f which were not covered by the 
EU acquis, such as public administration, education, health, and labor market reform. W h i l e the 
Bank’s international experience i n public administration reform was highly appreciated by the 
client, the Bank’s support i n the latter three areas was not sufficiently effective. This underscores 
the linkage between pressure from the EU and government commitment to reform. Where EU 
’ attention was relatively low, the Government’s appetite fo r reform was generally low as well. 

140. With so much accomplished with Bank support through the PALS and AAA, one 
could ask whether the sector investment lending program envisioned in the CAS but fo r the 
most part subsequently dropped, was actually necessary. I f the Rural Development Project 
were now underway, more pre-accession grant funds would have been channeled to low-income 
areas than has been the case to date. Education sector reforms for enhanced labor market 
competitiveness, a major priority in t h e new CPS, would be more advanced, had t h e education S I L s 
been implemented. The IBRD and GEF Forestry operations would have increased the contribution 
o f the forestry sector to Bulgaria’s GDP while enhancing sustainability through improved 
conservation in forest management. Overall, however, implementation o f the FY03-FY05 CAS 
likely served t o accelerate the pace o f reform implementation and Bulgaria’s associated progress 
toward EU accession. 

B. Lessons Learned and Implications f o r New CPS 

141. 

A number o f lessons emerge from the Bank’s experience during implementation o f the last 
CAS, with implications for both design and implementation o f the next CAS. 

142. 
First, the Bank should ensure a partnership-oriented relationship with Bulgaria, 
given that it i s a well-performing M I C with an investment grade credit rating and therefore 
access to alternative sources o f financing. The Bank has already signaled this change by calling 
the next CAS a Country Partnership Strategy. Partnership w i l l call for the Bank’s working to find 
ways to deliver requested services in a timely manner. In keeping with the need for responsiveness 
to client demand, the Bank should engage in new investment lending only i f i t has strong c l ien t 

Annex C 
Page 45 o f 46 
demand - at the highest levels within the Government and with a high-level “champion” in the 
relevant l i n e ministry - and meets the c l ien t ’s expectations for design focus, shortened preparation 
and implementation time, management by l i n e ministry staff, and u s e o f country systems. Care 
w i l l need to be taken i n addressing the fiduciary aspects o f any SWAPS to ensure that they do not 
result in the very delays that they are intended to avoid. I t w i l l also be important to prepare a 
Bulgaria CPS Progress Report in FY08 or FY09 to facilitate needed adjustments to the Bank’s 
partnership program in light o f changing circumstances. 

143. Second, timely monitoring mechanisms with time se r ies comparability need to be 
included in a CPS program to ensure rigorous measurement o f progress toward CPS 
outcomes at the end o f the CPS period. T h i s w i l l also apply to a future series o f DPL operations. 
Methodology, timing, and responsibility should be explicitly agreed between the Government and 
the Bank a t the beginning o f the CPS program, since a good deal o f lead-time for preparation i s 
required. 

144. 

Third, successful implementation o f a multi-sector reform program requires an 
effective, sustained, coordination mechanism with a high-level champion in the Government. 
This w i l l be important to carry forward from the PAL program to a DPL program focused on 
education and health, to ensure coordination with those two ministries as well as other agencies and 
stakeholders. 

145. 

Fourth, swifter action i s needed to address implementation issues with the existing 
investment loan portfolio as they arise. One o f the reasons for the success o f t h e PAL program 
was that accommodation for adjustment over time was built into i t s design from the outset. When 
project implementation runs into problems, the Bank team should be more proactive ear l ier . In 
addition to the restructuring option, teams should seriously consider issuing a threa t to suspend 
disbursements if a loan has been in unsatisfactory s ta tus for more than 9-12 months. Portfolio 
performance triggers are not appropriate in a well-performing M IC CPS, and although there i s no 
indication this was the case with Bulgaria, could potentially create incentives for Bank s t a f f to 
in f la te project supervision ratings. 

146. 

Fifth, several “do’s and don’t’s’’ have emerged regarding the architecture o f a 
programmatic development policy matrix: (i) by backloading Bulgaria’s human development 
agenda within the PAL program, the Bank and the Government postponed much needed reforms, 
the delay o f which has cost Bulgaria time i n terms o f i t s readiness for successful EU integration; 
(ii) i f offsetting changes (“trades”) are made between triggers and benchmarks in light o f 
unforeseen realities as a DPL program evolves, the actions i n play should be o f comparable 
political “weight” within the same pillar, in order to ensure sustained reform momentum across the 
full reform agenda (accordingly, the new CPS w i l l need to give high priority to development policy 
lending (DPL) instruments to support overdue education, health, and labor market reforms not 
adequately addressed in the PAL program); (iii) t h e sequencing o f benchmarks should be designed 
with the borrower’s political economy in mind (e.g., there i s typically more scope for bolder reform 
ear l ier rather than la ter during a government’s tenure); (iv) a key outcome for the CPS and the DPL 
instrument should be an increase in the labor force participation rate; and (v) any benchmarks 
relating to privatization should not be defined in terms o f transaction outcomes, but rather, 
execution o f an appropriate, transparent process - beyond which market forces, and not policy- 
based loan benchmarks, should dictate. 

147. Sixth, investment project design should be commensurate with government 
commitment, the enabling sectoral policy environment, and the administrative capacity o f the 
implementing unit, and every effort should be made to mainstream project implementation 

Annex C 
Page 46 o f 46 
functions within line ministries and agencies. This should help to build sustainable capacity, 
urgently needed by Bulgaria in this c r i t ica l pre- and post-accession period. 

148. Seventh, the AAA program should be aligned with Government and CAS priorities 
and as experience and feedback from stakeholders and QAG have indicated, dissemination 
should be built into the design o f the Bank’s AAA instruments. Indeed, dissemination should 
be considered a standard phase o f AAA service delivery, much in the same way as preparation and 
supervision for lending instruments, and this w i l l require budget planning at an early stage. And 
analytical and advisory services should be strategically sequenced, 
to inform lending. 
Programmatic AAA should be considered for the new CPS to keep t h e Bank’s advice focused, 
timely, and relevant. 

149. And finally, the Bank’s support to Bulgaria during the new CPS period should 
emphasize the Bank’s ro le as “the Knowledge Bank” and draw on the experience o f the EU8, 
the EU25, and Part I countries elsewhere. T h e las t CAS and the Government Program i t 
supported identified desired outcomes in terms o f the evolution o f Bulgaria’s continued progress 
s ince Bulgaria’s f inanc ia l c r i s i s o f 1996-1997. To ensure strategic relevance going forward, the 
Bank’s investment lending pipeline w i l l need to focus on issues more specific to Bulgaria’s 
eventual EU integration and convergence. Some o f the new CPS outcomes should therefore be 
defined in terms o f Bulgaria’s relative performance vis-a-vis that o f other countries. The Bank’s 
knowledge o f EU NMS experience has grown i n recent years and according to the Client Survey i s 
perceived to be a s ign i f ican t share o f its value added, so the Bank i s well positioned to make a 
contribution in this regard.
