1. 
The FY2003-06 C A S supported and f o l l ow e d the structure o f the Hondu ras ’ Pove r ty 
Reduc t ion Strategy (PRS). During this per iod , macro-econom ic s tab i l i ty was restored, s ign i f ican t 
progress was made in im p r o v i n g the business c l ima te and the pe r fo rmance o f the f inanc ia l sector, 
and a sound framework for p u b l i c sector f inanc ia l management was put in p lace . These 
achievements a l lowed Hondu ras t o reach H I P C Comp le t ion P o i n t in April 2005 and benefit f r o m 
the Mu l t i la te ra l D e b t R e l i e f I n i t i a t i v e (MDRI) in Ju ly 2006. Desp i te these achievements, l i t t l e 
progress has been made in pove r ty reduc t ion and k e y s truc tura l constraints o n growth have s t i l l t o 
be addressed, no tab ly as regards the p o o r per formance o f pub l ic u t i l i t i e s and the p o o r qua l i ty o f 
pub l ic se rv ices , pa r t icu la r ly education. In recent months, an agreement with teachers awa rd ing 
s ign i f ican t pay rises ove r a fou r year pe r iod and the moun t ing losses o f the e lec t r ic i ty utility have 
intensified f isca l pressures . This creates unce r ta in ty rega rd ing the mac ro -econom ic ou t look f o r 
FY2007-10 C A S p e r i o d and raises concerns regard ing the sus ta inab i l i ty o f debt r e l i e f gains 
achieved under H I P C and MDRI. 
The key deve lopmen t challenges fo r Honduras are t o accelerate i t s recen t g r ow t h

increased educa t iona l attainment;

Progress in

Honduras ’ deve lopmen t v i s i o n i s l a i d ou t in i t s Pove r ty Reduc t ion Strategy, o r i g i n a l l y 
prepared in 2001, and subsequently endorsed by President M a d u r o in 2003 and by President JosC 
M a n u e l Ze laya Rosales sho r t ly a f ter tak ing o f f ice in 2006. The Gove rnmen t i s cu r ren t ly upda t ing 
the PRS to re f lec t Pres iden t Zelaya’s governmen t p rog ram by giving greater a t ten t ion to p u b l i c 
sector transparency, emp loymen t generation, env ironmen ta l p ro tec t ion and a stronger r e s u l t s 
o r ien ta t ion across the p u b l i c sector. 
The FY2007-10 C A S has been a l igned w i t h the b road f ramewo rk o f the PRS and the

The last Country Assistance Strategy for Honduras was discussed by the Board on

24 June 2003. The FY2003 -06 CAS supported and fo l lowed the structure o f the Hondu ras ’ 
Pove r ty Reduc t ion Strategy (PRS). D u r i n g this per iod , macro-econom ic s tab i l i ty was restored,

I n this challenging environment, the FY2007-10 CAS has been aligned with the 
broad framework o f the PRS and the priorities identified by President JosC Manuel Zelaya 
Rosales, whilst retaining the flexibility needed to adjust the Bank’s assistance in line with 

performance. The fou r p i l la rs iden t i f ied o f the FY2007 -10 C A S are: equ i tab le econom ic 
g r ow t h fo r emp loymen t generation; good governance th rough state mode rn iza t ion and c i v i c

The C A S w i l l address measures t o strengthen transparency, accoun tab i l i ty and the demand for 
good governance as a cross-cu t t ing i s s u e . A PRSC series w i l l p rov ide the f ramewo rk f o r B a n k

Honduras has undergone a successful transition from an authoritarian military 
regime to a pluralistic democracy. The seventh consecutive elections, held in N o v em b e r 2005, 
resulted in a t rans i t ion f r om a N a t i o n a l Pa r ty adm in is t ra t ion to a L i b e r a l Pa r ty adm in is t ra t ion led 
by President Ze laya with 3 - 7 percen t m a r g i n over the Na t iona l Pa r ty p res iden t ia l candidate, a lbe i t

that recent e f for ts to targe t co r rup t ion are hav ing some impac t : while o n l y 26 percent o f

Progress has been made in the control and transparency of public financial 
management, administrative simplification and establishing the institutional framework

to budge t 
execu t ion reports; budget execu t ion repor ts are n o w published o n the Ministry o f F inance 
(SEF IN) website. Adm in is t ra t ive s imp l i f ica t ion has led to s ign i f ican t reduc t ions in business 
reg is tra t ion times and the transfer o f the mercan t i le register t o the Chamber o f Commerce . 
Congress passed leg is la t ion es tab l ish ing an independent A n t i -C o r r u p t i o n Comm iss ion in 
M a r c h 2005 and r a t i f i e d the UN Conven t ion Aga ins t C o r r u p t i o n in M a y 2005. The

While recent changes in the electoral process have strengthened accountability o f

BOX 2: MITIGATING THE I M P A C T OF EXTERNAL SHOCKS 

Natural disasters have had a significant impact on Honduras’ growth and poverty 
reduction performance, not least because poor a r e at higher risk and more adversely 

impacted. Honduras i s susceptible t o both hurr icanes and droughts. Hu r r icane M i t c h in 
1998, resu l ted in 5,750 dead, nea r ly h a l f a m i l l i o n d isp laced persons, ag r icu l tu ra l losses o f 
around 70-80 percent o f p roduc t ion and damage amoun t ing to nea r ly 40 percen t o f GDP . 
Asset losses averaged 18 percent among the poores t fifth o f Hondu ran households, compared 
with 3 percen t amount the r iches t quintile. C l ima te change i s causing a s ign i f ican t increase in 
hurr icane risks (the number o f ca tegory 4 and 5 hurricanes in the Car ibbean doub led du r ing 
the past t h i r t y years), while the i r impac t i s aggravated by con t inued de fores ta t ion and 
uncon t ro l led settlement in high risk areas. In te rven t ions since Hu r r icane M i t c h , suppor ted by 
t h e Bank , have focused o n s treng then ing l a n d use management to reduce risks, as w e l l as 
strengthening disaster m i t i g a t i o n and response capac i ty at the l o c a l leve l . 
Honduras i s also susceptible to trade shocks. The ag r icu l tu ra l sector has los t abou t one- 
third o f i ts purchas ing powe r in the pas t t w o decades, la rge ly due t o the dec l ine in p r ices fo r 
expor t crops, pa r t icu la r ly bananas and co f fee . The impac t o f the co f fee crisis, f r o m 1997 to 
200 1, was pa r t icu la r ly severe. A l t h o u g h co f fee ou tpu t was l i t t l e affected, expo r t earnings 
dropped by nea r ly a third f r o m 1999 to 2001. Sma l l farmers (accoun t ing f o r 90 percen t o f 
co f fee producers and 45 percent o f p roduc t ion ) were hardest hit. The comb ined impac t o f 
M i t c h and the commod i ty cr is is con t r ibu ted to a surge in m ig ra t ion t o the USA . 

Measures to mitigate the impact o f these shocks a t the household level a re primarily 
geared to strengthening ex-ante risk management and developing effective safety nets. A 

stable macro-econom ic env ironmen t , coup led with a f lex ib le labo r market, helps so f ten the 
b l o w o f an economic shock. At the househo ld leve l , the p r i o r i t y i s to imp rove econom ic 
adap tab i l i ty th rough inves tmen ts in educa t ion as w e l l as improvemen ts in access to finance, 
marke ts and in fo rma t ion . Deve lopmen t o f weather-based insurance and ma rke t based risk 
management mechanisms m a y also he lp some farmers. We l l- targe ted safety nets are also 
needed. These are best built o n ex is t ing programs . These in terven t ions app ly equa l ly for 
he lp ing farmers adjust to the imp lemen ta t ion o f D R - C A F T A (see B o x 3). 

in 2001-02. G r o w t h i s expected to reach 5 .1 percen t in 2006, thanks t o an excep t iona l year for 
coffee, sustained g r ow t h in exports and a boos t in tou r ism and cons truc t ion . Co re i n f l a t i o n has 
s tab i l ized b e l ow 10 percent (8.8 percen t in 2005), though the pr ices o f non-core components 
(energy, f u e l s and per ishab le foods) have p roved m u c h mo re vo la t i le . The ex terna l pos i t ion has 
also improved , w i th the curren t account de f ic i t (before grants) dec l in ing f r om 7.5 percen t o f G D P 
in 2003 to 5.5 percent in 2005. 
In te rna t iona l reserves have increased rap id ly , keep ing up with 
the acceleration o f im p o r t g r ow t h t o ma in ta in a ra t io o f be tween 4.5 and 5 mon ths im p o r t 
coverage. 
At the same time, the rea l exchange rate has rema ined f a i r l y stable. 
These 
improvemen ts are la rge ly a t tr ibu tab le t o the con t inued g r ow t h in remittances, as we l l as s trong 
expor t performance. Ove r the las t five years i n f l o w s o f remittances have increased by a round 30 
percen t a year. In 2005 remittances amoun ted t o US$1 .77 bn - becom ing the largest source o f 
fo re ign exchange - and are expected t o top U S $ 2 bn in 2006. 
8. 

There has been a gradual shift away from traditional exports which have been 
superseded by the rapid growth in maquila exports. The share o f the three m a i n t rad i t iona l 

expo r t commod i t ies (coffee, bananas and shrimp) has fa l len f r o m over 50 percen t in the ear ly 
1990s to around 20 percent at present, in pa r t o w i n g t o dec l in ing commod i ty p r ices but la rge ly 
due to the r a p i d g r ow t h o f maqu i la (ma in ly tex t i le) exports. M a q u i l a va lue added grew f r o m 9 
percen t o f exports in 1995 to 25 percen t in 2005. This has been accompanied by a shift in t rad ing 

4 

partners, since t rad i t iona l exports have la rge ly been destined f o r European ma rke ts whereas the 
maqu i la industry has stronger links with USA. Honduras ’ maqu i la industry has con t inued t o 
g r ow despite the end o f WTO quotas in ea r ly 2005 and the in tens i f ied compe t i t ion f r o m low -cos t 
As ian producers. Fo re ign d irec t investment (FDI) has helped f inance the shift in p roduc t ion and 
expor ts . Be tween 1994 and 2004, FDI grew by a lmos t 400 percent as a percent o f GDP. 
9. 
Changes in structure o f production mirror the evolving composition o f exports, 
Agr icu l ture ’s share o f G D P in curren t pr ices has dec l ined f r o m 22 percent in the m id -1990s t o 
l e s s than 14 percent in 2005, w h i l e the share o f services increased f r o m 4 2 percen t t o 5 5 percen t 
and manu fac tur ing f r o m 16 to 2 0 percent. In constant p r ices , however , the share o f ag r icu l tu ra l 
p roduc t ion has fa l len o n l y s l igh t ly - f r om 28 to 24 percen t o f G D P over f i f teen years - and the 
wo rk fo rce emp loyed in ag r icu l tu re has rema ined constant at a round 3 9 percen t . This suggests 
tha t there has been limited oppo r tun i ty to shift labo r and cap i ta l f r o m ag r icu l tu re t o o ther sectors. 
Despite rap id g row th in maqu i la exports, the sector s t i l l on ly emp loys abou t 5 percen t o f the 
wo rk fo rce . Increas ing access to educa t ion and deepening o f the f inanc ia l ma rke t w i l l be essential 
f o r im p r o v i n g fac tor mobility. 
10. 
The financial sector in Honduras i s gradually recovering from the external shocks 
that have hit the economy since 1998. The comb ined e f fec ts o f Hu r r icane M i t c h in 1998 
fo l lowed by the dec l ine in commod i ty prices, resu l ted in sharp increase in the p o r t f o l i o o f n o n - 
pe r fo rm ing loans and de te r io ra t ion in f inanc ia l sector performance. Since 2002, progress has 
been made in strengthening the regu la to ry f ramewo rk and supervision, as w e l l conso l ida t ing the 
bank ing sector (reduc ing the numbe r o f banks f r o m 20 t o 16), increas ing cap i ta l iza t ion in r e l a t i o n

sector has stagnated since 2002 . 
1 1, 
F isca l balances have improved significantly over the past three years. There has been 
a ma rked e lec tora l cyc le in Hondu ras ’ f isca l balances, with surges in spend ing p r i o r t o e lec t ions 
in 1993, 1997 and 2001. Be tween 1999 and 2003, the comb ined p u b l i c sector f isca l de f ic i t 
increased f r o m 0 .2 percent o f G D P t o 5.1 percent. G r ow t h in spending ove r this pe r iod was 
driven by increases in the cen t ra l governmen t wage bill, w h i c h increased f r o m 7.5 percen t o f 
G D P in 1997 to nea r ly 11 percen t in 2003, la rge ly due the in t roduc t ion o f spec ia l p a y regimes f o r

Realization o f these benefits requires the implementation of policies that w i l l support

BOX 4: PROGRESS AGAINST PRS TARGETS AND THE MDGs 
I f current trends continue Honduras w i l l attain on ly three Millennium Development 

Goals (MDGs). Progress i s on- track against MDGs fo r : un ive rsa l p r im a r y enro l lmen t ; 
reduc ing ma terna l m o r t a l i t y by three-quarters; and reduc ing the share o f the popu la t ion 
w i thou t access t o imp roved water source by ha l f . However , curren t trends f a l l shor t in f o u r 
areas: reducing extreme pove r ty by ha l f , reduc ing under f i v e m a l n u t r i t i o n by ha l f , and 
reduc ing under f i v e and in fan t mo r ta l i ty by two- th irds . The evo lu t ion o f MDGs in Hondu ras 
has been s lower than the L a t i n Ame r ica reg iona l average, w h i c h shows good progress against 
f i v e ou t o f seven MDGs (with the excep t ion o f extreme pove r ty and ma te rna l mo r ta l i ty ) . 

Making further progress in achieving the MDGs i n Honduras will require improved 
quality o f PRSP spending and an acceleration in economic growth to at least 5 t o 6 
percent accompanied by productivity growth in a l l economic sectors. Estimates f o r 

Honduras suggest tha t an 8 percent G D P g row th rate f r o m 2005 t o 2015 w o u l d be needed 
(w i thou t changes in the income d is t r ibu t ion ) to reduce extreme pove r ty by h a l f . I f there i s an 
imp rovemen t in the income d is t r ibu t ion tha t reduces the Gini by 10 percent, then a 6 percen t

though the rate o f imp rovemen t in these ind ica tors has s lowed in recen t years. Mo reove r ,

test scores in Spanish and Ma thema t ics at third and s ix th grade have shown n o imp rovemen t 
since 1998: in 2005, the med ian percentage o f correc t response in Spanish in third grade was just 
39 percent and f o r ma thema t ics 44 percent. P r ima ry schoo l comp le t ion rates imp roved f r o m 68

The Government has requested that the Bank proceed with the presentation o f the

The fourth priority of President Zelaya’s administration i s to expand and 
consolidate PRS programs supporting the development of human capital, focusing on basic 
education, primary health c a r e and social protection for vulnerable groups. In the educa t ion 

sector, the Governmen t in tends to proceed with the gradua l expansion o f basic educa t ion f r o m the

B. PROGRESS UNDER THE FY2003 -06 CAS 
The FY2003-06 CAS was aligned and structured following the Poverty Reduction

Strategy published in 2001. The Bank ’s assistance strategy inc luded support, in va ry ing

Although the CAS’S c o r e goal of reducing extreme poverty was not achieved, 
progress was made across the program, warranting an ove ra l l moderately successful rating, 
with the strongest performance related to 
improvements in the macro-economic 
environment, business climate and financial sector. The prospect o f subs tan t ia l debt r e l i e f 

under the H I P C in i t ia t ive was undoub ted ly one o f the k e y factors behind measures to con t ro l the 
g r ow t h in p u b l i c sector pay and the res to ra t ion o f macro-econom ic s tab i l i ty in 2003 -04 . The 
PRSC, approved in June 2004, supported this process by p r o v i d i n g a f ramewo rk f o r p r i o r i t i z i n g 
and mon i to r ing re fo rms as w e l l as budge t support f inanc ing . Honduras f i n a l l y reached H I P C

Significant progress has also been made in strengthening the public financial 
management system, supporting decentralization initiatives and developing participatory 
mechanisms for delivering basic education and health services. A comprehens ive p u b l i c

Bank assistance should focus on a narrower range o f sectors and reform objectives. 

Po l icy discussions with Gove rnmen t have been too broad, m a k i n g i t d i f f i c u l t f o r the 
Governmen t t o focus o n a manageable r e f o rm agenda. S im i la r ly , p ro jec ts have been dispersed

The Bank should take political constraints into account when supporting reform 
programs and encourage the authorities to build constituencies f o r reform. Pressures

Linking policy reform, investment projects and analytical wo r k tends t o bring the best 

results. The PRSC ins t rumen t has p r o v e d a m u c h mo re e f fec t ive ins t rumen t fo r sustained

reduc t ion ob jec t ives and are p rom inen t on the agenda f o r the FY2007 -10 C A S .

The FY2003-06 CAS' proposed lending program was delivered in a timely manner 
and the quality of lending was satisfactory. The C A S Base case scenario p lanned ten new 

inves tmen t projects, t w o techn ica l assistance pro jec ts and t w o PRSCs (in add i t ion , a H I P C Deb t 
R e l i e f Pro jec t n o t envisaged in the 2003 C A S was approved in April 2005). A l l but one o f these 
pro jec ts began within the C A S pe r iod : the exception, f inanc ing f o r the Educa t ion f o r A l l program, 
was rep laced by B a n k assistance in the f o rm o f adv isory services. Pro jec ts tha t closed du r ing the 
C A S pe r iod were ra ted satisfactory o r pos i t ive in a l l measures and these ra t ings were con f i rmed 
fo r the tw o pro jec ts evaluated by the Independent Eva lua t ion G r o u p (see Annex F). The number 
o f p rob lem pro jec ts was reduced f r o m tw o t o zero over FY2003 -05 , even as the p o r t f o l i o grew 
f r om 13 t o 22 pro jec ts . Ove r the same per iod , the disbursement ra t io increased f r o m about 19 
percent to about 30 percen t - disbursements d rop sharply f o l l o w i n g changes in Governmen t when 
s ta f f are rep laced and then gradua l ly p ick -up as s ta f f are t ra ined and ga in experience - and the 
p ro -ac t iv i ty index reached 100 percent, suggesting s trong lending f l ow s and qu ick reso lu t ion o f

42 . Whilst recognizing the PRS as the framework f o r external assistance in Honduras, 
future Bank assistance w i l l be selective, focusing on a few priority areas within PRS’ broad 

development agenda. The Ministry o f F inance and the Presidency have taken the lead in 
p r i o r i t i z i n g the Bank ’s assistance. The se lec t ion o f p r io r i t ies f o r B a n k f inanc ing and ana ly t ica l

representing c i v i l society and the p r iva te sector o n the C A S results f ramewo rk (see Annex E). 
K e y considerations in de te rm in ing the areas f o r fu tu re B a n k support are: (i) the Bank ’s 
compara t ive advantage as an ins t i tu t ion p r o v i d i n g qua l i ty p o l i c y advice, lead ing to the Bank ’s 
focus on pressing r e f o rm issues ( inc lud ing u t i l i t y res truc tur ing , governance re fo rms and 
imp rovemen t in the qua l i ty o f education); (ii) the recommendations o f the IEG Coun t ry 
Assistance Eva lua t ion and the C A S Comp le t ion Repo r t to focus a na r rowe r range o f p r io r i t ies 
d i rec t ly suppor t ing the g r ow t h and pove r ty reduc t ion agenda; and (iii) the ove ra l l a l loca t ion o f 
ex terna l assistance and the d i v i s i o n o f labo r w i th k e y partners, pa r t icu la r ly IDB, lead ing t o the 
focus o n r u r a l development in fu tu re lend ing , w h i c h i s cu r ren t ly under f inanced re la t ive t o o ther 
sectors. Fo l low ing , a j o i n t p r i o r i t i z a t i o n exercise with the Governmen t , i t was agreed that new

B a n k and IDB w i l l con t inue to co l labora te c lose ly in state modern iza t ion , energy, roads, water, 
education and disaster m i t iga t ion .

The Bank’s results-oriented CAS complements the Government’s efforts to define 
and monitor the results i t intends to achieve during its mandate. The resu l ts f ramewo rk 

ou t l ines the med ium - te rm ob jec t ives a r t icu la ted in the PRS and the Gove rnmen t program , the 
measurable results supported by the B a n k tha t con t r ibu te to the achievement o f these na t iona l 
objectives, and the Bank-suppor ted ac t iv i t ies con t r ibu t ing to these r e s u l t s . The r e s u l t s f ramewo rk 
p rov ides a mo re strategic and f lex ib le f ramewo rk f o r a l loca t ing Bank resources and determining 
the appropriate mix o f assistance to ach ieve deve lopmen t ob jec t ives . In this context, the resu l ts 
f ramewo rk shou ld be seen as se t t ing the strategic d i rec t ion ra ther than serving as a b luep r in t . 

44. 
The Bank w i l l coordinate closely with other development partners, collaborating 
where feasible through joint analytical wo rk and by channeling its support together with 
other partners in support o f Government-led sector programs. The B a n k w i l l build o n the 

strong partnerships w i t h ex terna l partners in the design and imp lemen ta t ion o f i ts operations and

BOX 7: STRENGTHENING TRANSPARENCY, ACCOUNTABILITY AND DEMAND FOR GOOD 
GOVERNANCE AS A CROSS-CUTTING I S S U E 
The FY2007-10 CAS proposes a shift in the Bank's focus on governance issues from the 
project t o the sector leve l , whilst taking steps to strengthen fiduciary management 

standards for a l l Bank operations. There are three k e y e lemen ts o f this strategy: first, a sector 
l e v e l focus f o r ins t i tu t iona l and f iduc ia ry assessments; second, s treng then ing o f na t iona l 
management systems fo r p ro jec t f inanc ia l management, procuremen t and mon i to r ing ; and th ird , 
measures to strengthen transparency, accoun tab i l i ty and demand f o r g o o d governance. 

The focus of institutional and fiduciary assessments currently undertaken for a l l Bank 
projects w i l l shift from the project to the sector so as to support the Government's 
governance reform agenda, pave the way for sector programs and promote the use of 
national systems for managing and monitoring Bank assistance. These assessments w i l l be 

undertaken in close coo rd ina t ion with the SEFIN, imp lemen t ing agencies, and overs igh t 
ins t i tu t ions . I n p u t f r o m the in tended p ro jec t bene f ic iar ies w i l l be sough t with a view to 
strengthening governance close to the field l e v e l . Assessments w i l l i d e n t i f j the risks and 
oppor tun i t ies at b o t h the sector and the p ro jec t l e v e l . The B a n k and Gove rnmen t w i l l deve lop a 
set o f governance ind ica to rs fo r pro jec ts a imed at mon i to r ing progress in strengthening 
imp lemen t ing agencies' management and mon i to r ing systems. These w i l l i n i t i a l l y be app l ied o n 
a p i l o t basis with a view t o g radua l ly im p r o v i n g the fo rmu la t ion o f ind ica to rs and expand ing 
the ir app l ica t ion sys tema t ica l ly . The governance ind ica tors w i l l be inco rpo ra ted i n t o the ove ra l l 
resu l ts f ramewo rk o f selected pro jec ts and w i l l be mon i to red in their respec t ive Imp lemen ta t ion 
Status and Results repor ts . The impac t o f these ind ica tors in terms o f p romo t ing good- 
governance w i l l be assessed during the mid-term reviews o f those selected pro jec ts . Pro jec t 
f iduc ia ry superv is ion w i l l f o l l ow - u p o n the deve lopmen t o f sec tor- leve l f inanc ia l management 
and procuremen t systems. The status o f agency systems w i l l be taken i n t o account when 
assessing p ro jec t - leve l risk. 

Reduced fiduciary risk and good-governance at the sector l e v e l w i l l require the continued 
improvement of the national systems at the cross-government, sector and l o c a l leve ls . The 

Bank w i l l support the deve lopmen t o f sector and l o c a l l e v e l sys tems 
th rough i t s selected 
projects, comp lemen t ing support 
to cross-government systems unde r the on -go ing and 
fo l low -up PRS -TAC and the P H R D f o r Aid Coo rd ina t ion . There are three p r i o r i t y areas: 
f inanc ia l management, using S I A F I as a p l a t f o rm f o r sector and p ro jec t management systems; 
procurement, focus ing o n the deve lopmen t o f the e-procurement system, Honducompras ; and 
mon i to r ing , where 
the p r i o r i t y i s to strengthen na t iona l and agency l e v e l in fo rma t ion 
systems. The u l t ima te goa l i s to strengthen these na t iona l systems to the p o i n t where they meet 
the Bank's and o ther ex terna l partners' f iduc ia ry requirements. 

Complementing these selected sector-level initiatives, the Bank w i l l seek to strengthen 
ove ra l l governance, such as in transparency and accountability across the portfolio. I n l i n e 

w i t h t h i s ob jec t ive the B a n k w i l l : con t inue to fac i l i ta te ex tens ive d isc losure o f p ro jec t

Development policy operations will support the Government’s reform agenda, with 
analytical w o r k and investment projects aligned to facilitate reform implementation. Given

G. PARTNERSHIPS AND OUTREACH 
The Bank w i l l continue to work c lose ly with development partners through formal 
coordination structures and joint analytical and operational wo rk . As pa r t o f the C A S

The Bank w i l l also expand its outreach efforts, improving access to information and 
strengthening communication with key national stakeholders. A Pub l ic I n f o rm a t i o n Center 
was established in 2004 , j o i n t l y f inanced with CABEI, UNDP and USAID. The PIC w i l l

H. RESULTS-BASED MONITORING AND EVALUATION 

80. 
The CAS Results Framework w i l l provide the basis for monitoring Bank 
performance and program adjustments. Results Based P o r t f o l i o Rev iews w i l l be under taken 
on an annual basis, in order to assess progress towards the ach ievemen t o f the ob jec t ives fo r B a n k

I. R I S K S , RISK MITIGATION AND RESPONSE 

82. 

Macro-economic stability and debt sustainability a r e threatened by fiscal pressures. 

The immed ia te risk arises f r om the award o f s ign i f ican t pay r i s e s f o r teachers over a fou r year 
pe r iod and ENEE’s moun t ing losses. These risks c o u l d be exacerbated by con t inued wage 
pressures in the p u b l i c sector and fbr ther increases in pe t ro leum p r ices shou ld these n o t be passed 
th rough to consumers. The proposed Bank p r o g r am addresses these risks th rough i t s p o l i c y

Interest groups could undermine the Government’s efforts to advance key reforms. 

M a n y o f the issues tha t f igu re p rom inen t ly in the r e f o rm agenda are already con trovers ia l .

by s treng then ing d ia logue with key stakeholders and, th rough access to in fo rma t ion , help build 
constituencies in favo r o f re fo rm . 

84. 

As a small, open economy Honduras i s particularly susceptible to trade shocks. The 

dec l ine in commod i ty pr ices in 1999 to 2001 had a s ign i f ican t impac t o n r u r a l incomes and 
caused an overhang o f b a d debt in the f inanc ia l sector w h i c h cu r ta i ls ag r icu l tu ra l c red i t t o th is

to expand and d ive rs i fy exports, Honduras w i l l need t o make considerable progress in im p r o v i n g 
p roduc t iv i ty i f this oppo r tun i ty i s t o be realized. The proposed C A S addresses these risks by 
suppor t ing re fo rms and investments needed to imp rove competitiveness, d ive rs i f ica t ion o f r u r a l 
p roduc t ion and the econom ic adap tab i l i ty o f r u r a l households. 

8 5 . 

Honduras w i l l suffer natural disasters during the CAS period, with potentially 

devastating impact. Ev idence po in ts to increas ing frequency and in tens i ty o f storms in the 
Caribbean. The impac t o f these events i s aggravated by de fores ta t ion and uncon t ro l led settlement 
in high risk areas. In terven t ions since Hu r r icane M i t c h have focused o n strengthening land u s e 
p lann ing , disaster m i t i g a t i o n and response capac i ty in the sixty h ighes t risk mun ic ipa l i t ies . The 
response o f these mun ic ipa l i t ies during the 2005 hu r r icane season demonstrates the effectiveness 
o f this approach. During the C A S per iod , the in ten t ion i s t o expand these in terven t ions in

C o u n t r y : H o n d u r a s 

D a t e o f CAS: May 29 ,2003 

D a t e o f P rog ress Repo r t (s ) : N o n e R e q u i r e d 

P e r i o d C o v e r e d by t h e CAS-CR: FY2003 - 2006 

A. INTRODUCTION 
1. 
This CAS Completion Report assesses the effectiveness o f the FY2003-07 Country 
Strategy for Honduras in achieving the expected results and highlights the lessons learned. The 
repor t constitutes a se l f-eva lua t ion by the Bank ’s coun try team. The C A S C R takes i n t o accoun t 
consultations on ear l ier dra f ts o f the report, in December 2005, sho r t ly a f ter elections, with members 
o f the ou tgo ing adm in is t ra t ion and representatives o f c i v i l society. F o l l o w i n g these consultations, the 
reports conclusions and recommenda t ions were discussed w i t h members o f the Honduras coun t ry 
team. Fur ther consu l ta t ions o n the Bank ’s per formance took p lace during consu l ta t ions f o r the 
FY2007 -10 C A S and these have also been re f lec ted in the f i n a l repo r t . The conc lus ions o f this repo r t 
have been taken in to account in the design o f the FY2007 -10 CAS . 
2. 
The country team has also benefited from a detailed evaluation o f the Bank’s 
performance in Honduras ove r the period FY1995 to FY2005 prepared by the Independent 
Evaluation Group. IEG consu l ted the Bank ’s coun t ry team during the p repa ra t ion o f their repo r t and 
has par t ic ipa ted in coun t ry team meetings o n the C A S and subsequent R O C rev iews . These exchanges 
have helped the coun t ry team v i ew Honduras ’ deve lopmen t challenges and the Bank ’s performance in 
a longe r - te rm perspective. This has been pa r t icu la r ly impo r tan t in i d e n t i f y i n g areas where progress has 
been made and the in terven t ions that have been mo re successful, as w e l l as the s t ruc tu ra l challenges 
that Bank in terven t ions have fa i led to address e f fec t ive ly . The ana lys is and recommenda t ions 
under taken by the IEG has i n f o rm e d the p repa ra t ion o f the FY2007 -10 CAS . 

B. HONDURAS’ DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVES 
3. 
The 2003 CAS was designed to support Honduras’ development objectives as outlined in 
the Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS) Paper presented in October 2001. The PRS ’s ob jec t ive i s 
t o reduce pove r ty by 24 percen t over the p e r i o d 2001 t o 2015. Linked to this ove ra l l ob jec t ive , the 
PRS also presents 11 targets re la ted to the achievement o f the M i l l e n n i u m Deve lopmen t Goals. The 
PRS presents a coherent and c red ib le strategy to b r i n g the coun t ry ou t o f i t s p o s i t i o n as one o f the 
poorest countries in L a t i n Ame r ica . The strategy i s s truc tured a round six p i l la rs : (i) acce lera t ing 
econom ic grow th ; (ii) reduc ing pove r ty in r u r a l areas; (iii) reduc ing u rban pove r ty ; (iv) inves t ing in 
human capital; (v) s treng then ing soc ia l p ro tec t ion f o r spec i f ic groups; and (vi) ensuring the 
sus ta inab i l i ty o f the strategy. In each o f these areas, the PRS ou t l ines p o l i c y measures, programs and 
spec i f ic pro jec ts suppo r t ing imp lemen ta t ion o f the strategy. Three ove ra rch ing themes cu t across 
these s ix p i l la rs : gender equity, env i ronmen ta l sus ta inab i l i ty , and decen tra l iza t ion . 
4. 
The Bank’s assistance strategy included support to a l l six o f the PRS pillars and many o f 
the pillars’ sub-components. The C A S documen t p rov ides a de ta i led assessment o f each o f the PRS 
p i l lars , de ta i l ing the curren t status and proposed p o l i c y in i t ia t ives . The p rog ram imp lemen ted unde r 
the C A S p rov ided assistance, i n c l u d i n g lending and adv isory services, t o a l l six o f the PRS p i l la rs . 
Assistance was concentrated under the “reduc ing r u r a l pove r ty p i l lar” , accoun t ing f o r mo re tha t one 
third o f p rog rammed lending. App rox ima te ly one s ix th o f the Bank ’s assistance was p rog rammed 
th rough cross-cu t t ing in terven t ions , no tab ly th rough a PRSC, suppor ted by a PRS Techn ica l 
Assistance Cred i t . 

43 

5 . 

The Bank adapted individual operations to adjust to the refocusing of priorities in 

successive PRSP Progress Reports. Ad jus tmen ts t o the PRS were presented in Progress Repor ts 
prepared after approva l o f the C A S in June 2003: the f i s t progress repo r t in December 2003 and the 
second in January 2005. Progress reports ma in ta ined con t inu i ty in the PRS whilst slightly shifting 
emphasis to mee t chang ing p o l i c y needs: (i) focus ing mo re a t ten t ion o n emp loymen t generation and 
small-scale p roduc t ive ac t iv i t ies as a means o f acce lera t ing b o t h g r ow t h and pove r ty reduc t ion ; (ii) 
striking a better balance be tween longe r t e r m human cap i ta l inves tmen t and measures a imed at 
imp rov ing the qua l i ty o f l i f e fo r the poor ; (iii) addressing sp i ra l ing c r ime and persona l security i s s u e s , 
pa r t icu la r ly the r ise o f j u v e n i l e gangs (maras) ; (iv) strengthening transparency and crack d o w n o n 
corrup t ion ; and (v) im p r o v i n g competitiveness and econom ic services t o take advantage o f C A F T A - 
DR. These rev ised p r io r i t ies c o u l d be accommodated by adjustments in the des ign o f the proposed 
po r t fo l io and so n o rev is ion o f the strategy was requ i red f o r the C A S pe r iod . F o r example, the f i n a l 
design of the B a r r i o C iudad p ro jec t inc luded a componen t o n c r ime and v io lence p reven t ion a imed at 
im p r o v i n g safety in poo r ma rg ina l ne ighborhoods and the Trade Fac i l i ta t ion and Compe t i t iveness 
Pro jec t inc luded investments in p o r t services. 
6. 

The selection of Bank lending was appropriate, though there a r e two areas where the 
Bank could, perhaps, have focused greater attention: addressing structural problems in the 
energy sector and supporting rural business development. In the case o f the energy sector, the 

C A S acknow ledged the s truc tura l prob lems fac ing the energy sector but underes t ima ted the f r a g i l i t y o f 
the utility. The Bank ’s assistance in this sector was limited t o p r o v i d i n g p o l i c y support a imed at 
res t ruc tu r ing the utility th rough the PRSC, w i th limited techn ica l assistance th rough the associated 
PRS T AC , while IDB p rov ided the inves tmen t funds. Suppo r t ing the utility res t ruc tu r ing agenda with 
B a n k investment lend ing m a y have p roved mo re e f fec t ive (this i s the approach adopted under the 
FY2007 -10 CAS) . 
I n the case o f r u r a l business deve lopmen t , the B a n k has p rov ided assistance 
th rough several projects, though the assistance has been o n too sma l l a scale and too dispersed to have 
had any s ign i f ican t impac t . A Ru ra l Competitiveness Project has been inc luded in the FY2007 -10 
C A S t o p romo te improvemen ts in p roduc t iv i ty and emp loymen t genera t ion in agro- fores try and off- 
f a rm ac t iv i t ies f o r the r u r a l poo r . 
7. 

I n the case o f Bank analytical work, the selection of analytical wo rk was appropriate but 
the sequencing of wo rk could have been improved, particularly as regards the Poverty 
Assessment and the Public Expenditure Review. The Pove r ty Assessment constitutes a key t o o l f o r 

mon i to r ing progress in pove r ty reduc t ion and i n f o rm i n g pove r ty reduc t ion p o l i c y . Schedu l ing the 
LSMS and Pove r ty Assessment ear ly in the C A S p e r i o d w o u l d have p rov ided a baseline to measure 
progress in PRS imp lemen ta t ion as well as an inpu t to the PRS updates prepared during the C A S 
pe r iod . A f o l l ow - u p LSMS and Pove r ty Assessment are n o w scheduled f o r F Y 2 0 0 8 and F Y 2 0 0 9 
respec t ive ly . A fo l low -up to the 2002 Pub l ic Expend i tu re Rev iew was o r ig ina l ly p rog rammed f o r 
FY2006 , but has been rescheduled in FY2007 . A PER w o u l d have p rov ided va luab le input to the 
incom ing adm in is t ra t ion in p repa r ing i t s p rog ram and expenditure p lans in early 2006. Under the 
FY2007 -10 CAS , a f o l l ow - u p P ER w i l l be prepared in F Y 2 0 0 7 and an update ea r ly in F Y 2 0 1 0 so as t o 
be ava i lab le t o the new adm in is t ra t ion f o l l o w i n g the 2009 elections. 

C. 
PROGRESS AGAINST CAS OUTCOMES 
8 . 
This assessment focuses on the country-level key results indicators identified in the 
FY2003-06 CAS. 

These ind ica tors are c lose ly l i n k e d t o the ou tcome ind ica to rs fo r the PRS . 
A t t r i b u t i o n o f the Bank ’s con t r ibu t ion to the achievement o f outcomes at this l e v e l i s d i f f i c u l t . This i s 
pa r t icu la r ly so in the case o f Honduras, where the PRS has become an o rgan iz ing f ramewo rk for 
p r inc ip le f o r assistance and var ious ex terna l partners have con t r ibu ted assistance in each area o f the 
program . Tab le C - 1 presen ts a summary o f progress against the key resu l ts indicators, w h i c h are 
analyzed in the rema inder o f this section. Readers shou ld no te that the team has used these ind ica to rs

The benchmark indicator for the CAS to reduce extreme poverty from 45 percent in 
2002 to 42 percent has not been met; indeed, using this indicator the incidence o f extreme

The Poverty Assessment suggests a number of explanations f o r this poor poverty

Bank ana ly t ica l work during the CAS period has provided a sounder framework for

The Bank has also supported efforts to improve the business climate by improving the 
performance of economic services, though progress in this a rea has proved disappointing where 
Bank support has primarily been delivered through policy dialogue focusing on legislative

Owing to the lack of data, i t i s not possible to assess progress in achieving the benchmark 
indicator of increasing non-farm rural employment by 5 percent. Da ta f r o m the L iv ing Standards

The Bank has directly supported off-farm rural employment generation through its 
investments in road maintenance and micro-enterprise development, though much of the Bank’s 
investment in rural employment during the CAS period was directed at small scale agro-forestry 

businesses. Under the Road Recons truc t ion a n d Improvemen t P ro jec t (e f fec t ive Novembe r 200 l),

modest and dispersed to have any impac t o n na t iona l l e v e l outcomes. 
18. 
The importance o f expanding off-farm employment in rural areas has been highlighted 
in recent Bank analytical work, while initiatives supported by the Bank and other partners 
provide the basis for a more strategic approach to addressing this issue under the FY2007-10 
CAS. The D r i v e r s of R u r a l G r ow t h study (delivered in December 2004) and the reg iona l Shocks a n d

The benchmark indicator for increasing the coverage of basic education from 85 percent

20 . While the initiatives supported by the Bank have undoubtedly had an important impact 
in expanding the coverage of basic education, there has been little improvement in education 

quality. Standardized Test Scores have shown l i t t l e imp rovemen t du r ing the C A S pe r iod : the

BOX 2: PROGRESS UNDER EDUCATION FOR ALL 
Education for All provides a framework for donor support to a sub-sector plan aimed at 
achieving universal primary education by 2015. EFA has adop ted a pa r t ia l sub-sector wide 

approach, f o l l ow i n g the p r inc ip les o f sub-sector wide p lann ing and f inanc ing , coun t ry leadership 
and ha rmon iza t ion o f ex terna l assistance. 
Twe lve ex terna l partners pa r t ic ipa te under a 
Memo randum o f Unde rs tand ing signed in 2005. Five partners channe l their assistance th rough a 
poo led fund, disbursing against an agreed annua l wo rkp lan and budget, using common f inanc ia l 
management arrangements and procuremen t procedures. The B a n k has assisted in the design o f 
f inanc ing and repo r t ing arrangements and has con t inued to p rov ide techn ica l adv iso ry services to 
EFA. The Bank - f inanced Commun i ty Based Educa t ion P ro jec t covers some EFA-eligible 
expenditures. The B a n k has also adm in is tered a Trust Fund f o r Gove rnmen t o f Sweden 
con tr ibu t ions to the EFA program . 

While significant progress has been made in donor harmonization under EFA, the program 
has been hampered by the lack of a strategic vision for the sector and the limited engagement 

with key stakeholders. In the absence o f a strategic f ramewo rk i t has p r o v e d d i f f i c u l t to link the 
EFA in i t ia t ive to the ins t i tu t iona l and governance re fo rms needed to imp rove per formance in the 
education system. Progress 
in deve lop ing ins t i tu t iona l deve lopmen t p l a n has been s low . 
Consequently, a t ten t ion and d ia logue has tended to focus o n annua l opera t iona l p lans and budgets 
rather than the key p o l i c y issues fac ing the sector. 
There has been l i t t l e d ia logue with c i v i l 
society, parents and teachers o n the fu tu re d i rec t ion o f educa t ion re fo rms .

mathematics, despite the fact that they come f r o m genera l ly poorer commun i t ies than the “ t rad i t iona l ”

Mo reove r , little progress has been made in implementing the structural reforms in the

Macro-economic Stabilitv and F isca l ManaPement 
27. 
Notable achievements during the CAS period were the establishment and maintenance 
o f a sustainable macro-framework and a reduction in the share o f central government spending 
on wages as a share o f GDP. During the period 1998-2002, Honduras' macroeconomic performance 
was affected by external shocks, notably Hurricane Mitch and the decline in commodity p r i c e s . Public 
spending increased unsustainably, largely driven by the growth o f public sector pay, particularly the 
salaries of teachers and health workers benefiting from a privileged pay regime, and a surge in 
spending prior to the 2002 e lec t ions . The incoming Maduro administration faced a public sector wage 
b i l l o f 13.2 percent o f GDP and a combined public sector deficit o f 5.1 percent o f GDP i n 2003 (see 
In December 2003, the Government secured passage o f a Public Salary Law through 
Table 2). 
Congress, restoring executive control over pay policy and bringing pay r i s e s broadly in l i n e inflation. 
B y the end o f 2005, public sector pay had fallen by 1 percent o f GDP and the consolidated public 
sector deficit had f a l l e n to 1.9 percent o f GDP. There was no surge o f spending prior to the 2005 
e lec t ions , indeed to pre-election period was marked by its f i s c a l constraint. Total external public debt 
f e l l from around 71 percent o f GDP in 2000 to 50 percent in 2005 while external debt s e r v i c e f e l l from 
10.3 percent o f exports o f goods and services (including remittances) in 2003 to an estimated 7.2 
percent in 2005. Macro-economic performance improved from 2004, growth accelerated to over 4 
percent, despite a generally benign external environment (while there were no na tura l disasters, low 
commodity prices in the early part o f the period and rising o i l prices in 2005 limited the expansion o f 
the economy). The external balance improved significantly, largely due to resumed growth in growth 
in exports and rapid increases in rem i t tances , and inflation stabilized in 2005 following a sharp 
inc rease the previous year driven b y o i l prices.

The restoration o f macro-economic stability was driven by the Government's 
commitment t o securing H IPC debt relief and the need t o ensure a stable macro-economic 
environment in the run up to Honduras' accession to DR-CAFTA. A three-year Poverty 
Reduction and Growth Facility was approved by the I M F in February 2004, supporting a program 
designed to lower the f i s c a l deficit and growth in the share o f resources allocated to poverty reduction 

5 3 

and investment. W h i l e the I M F has taken the lead in policy dialogue on macro-economic stabilization 
and the reduction o f the public sector wage b i l l , Bank support has been closely aligned w i th this 
agenda. Key areas o f Bank-Fund collaboration have included: f inanc ia l sector re fo rm , strengthening 
o f public sector f inanc ia l management, poverty monitoring and the assessment o f poverty spending, 
and the restructuring o f public u t i l i t ies . The Bank supported this agenda w i th i t s Pover ty Reduc t ion 
Suppor t C red i t (approved June 2004). Progress in macro-economic stabilization and the reform 
agenda ultimately led to t h e approval o f the HIPC I n i t i a t i v e for Honduras in Ap r i l 2005. 

29. 

Povertv Spending 
The results indicator o f increasing poverty spending in line with PSR Progress Report 
benchmarks has been met: poverty reduction spending has increased from 7.5 percent of GDP 
in 2002 to 8 .9 percent in 2005, with a target o f 9.4 percent in 2006. During the CAS period, the 

Government implemented wide-ranging re fo rms in the f inanc ia l management system to improve 
transparency and the linkage between expenditures and PRS programs. A n executive decree o f 2004, 
replaced the “real” poverty reduction fund with a “virtual” f i n d which tags programs and expenditures 
that are considered to have a significant poverty reduction impact as PRS spending within the overall 
budget. HIPC and other debt-relief f inds must be allocated to PRS programs and expenditures, 
complementing national resources and external assistance. PRS spending i s defined in an annex to the 
PRS Progress Report. The 2006 budget makes changes in PRS arrangements that seek to strengthen 
the r o l e o f municipal authorities in PRS implementation. 

30. While poverty spending has increased, a significant share o f this spending benefits the 

non-poor. A beneficiary inc idence analysis undertaken in the Pove r ty Assessment (delivered June 
2006) has highlighted the need to improve targeting i f spending i s to have a significant impact o n 
poverty reduction. The poor, who account for 5 1 percent o f the population, benefit from 54 percent o f 
PRS spending. Twenty four percent o f PRS spending benefits the poorest quintile, with the share 
dropping steadily as t h e level o f a f f l u e n c e r i s e s . However, the fourth and fifth quintiles receive 30 
percent o f PRS spending, equivalent to approximately U S $ 5 8 per capita annually. The Poverty 
Assessment ranks PRS programs in t e r m s o f their concentration indices, identifying PROHECO as the 
program that most benefits the poor, and including primary education, immunization, soc ia l t rans fe rs 
under PRAF as programs that are pro-poor. 
31. 

Given the prominence o f the share o f poverty spending as a results indicator, the Bank 
should have allocated more resources to expenditure monitoring and tracking during the CAS 

period. Policy advice on the composition o f spending was provided in the context o f the PRSC 
(approved June 2004), the HIPC I n i t i a t i v e (completion point reached in Ap r i l 2005) and Bank 
advisory work o n the preparation o f the second PRS Progress Report, as reported the Jo in t Staff 
Adv isory No te (delivered Ma rch 2005). This advice was informed b y the June 2001 study P u b l i c 
Expend i tu re Managemen t fo r Pover ty Reduc t ion a n d F i s c a l Sus ta inab i l i ty . Timely updating and 
further analysis o f the beneficiary incidence, e f f i c i e n c y and effectiveness o f the PRS programs 
(drawing on a poverty assessment and an updated expenditure review) would have helped strengthen 
policy discussion on these i s s u e s during the CAS period. S ince the poverty reduction impact of 
spending continues to be an i s s u e o f concern, notably in the context o f the M u l t i l a t e r a l Deb t Relief 
I n i t i a t i v e (effective July 2006), public expenditure analysis figures prominently in the FY2007- 10 
CAS, 

32. 

Governance 
Significant progress has been made in the first o f three governance performance 
indicators: 
improving the public financial management system 
in 
line with 
the 
recommendations o f the Country Financial Accountability Assessment. Box 4 outlines the 

progress made in strengthening public expenditure management systems during the CAS period. The 
Bank and IDB collaborated in the preparation o f a Coun t ry F i n a n c i a l Accoun tab i l i ty Assessment 

54 

(delivered June 2003) and a Coun try Procuremen t Assessment Report (de l ivered September 2004). 
B o t h o f t h e s e studies have been commended in a recent IEG rev iew for their presen ta t ion o f w e l l 
structured, opera t iona l ac t ion w o r k plans. A CFAA Update was de l ive red in June 2006, aga in in

Box 4: STRENGTHENING PUBLIC FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT 
There has been significant progress in public financial management since ea r ly 2004, when 
the Government launched a comprehensive program to reform public financial management 
following the approval of a new Finance L a w . Budget c lass i f ica t ions are n o w a l igned with the

serious secur i ty weakness. 
At the same time, the Ministry of Finance has improved the quantity and quality of publicly 
available information, while the oversight functions of the Audit Court have been 
strengthened. I n f o rm a t i o n pub l ished on the Ministry’s webs i te includes: sem i-annua l and annua l

The Bank has supported PRS monitoring and c iv i l soc ie ty engagement, with a particular

engagement o f c i v i l society in PRS m o n i t o r i n g under the Pover ty Reduc t ion Suppo r t C r e d i t (approved

Results monitoring i s handicapped by the poor quality of statistical information in key 
PRS sectors, an issue which merited greater attention under the FY2003-06 CAS. W h i l e SIERP

sectors that absorb a subs tan t ia l share o f pove r ty spending, as ev idenced by the data gaps and 
inconsistencies in these sectors. In this context, the lack o f a t ten t ion given t o suppor t to adm in is t ra t ive 
statistics systems across the Bank ’s p o r t f o l i o represents a missed oppo r tun i ty . Under the Commun i ty

Vulnerable Groups 
Information constraints prevent an assessment of the benchmark results indicator for 
improvements in the status of women and indigenous groups, including ownership of lega l 
assets, access to services and income-earning opportunities. The Pover ty Assessment reveals tha t 

pove r ty rates are higher among indigenous peoples than the o ther popu la t ion groups: 7 1 percen t live

Portfolio Assessments and Oualitv o f Products and Services 
By the end o f FY2006, thirteen o f the fourteen lending operations scheduled under the

In add i t ion to the p rog rammed operations, the Bank approved assistance under the 
Enhanced H I P C I n i t i a t i v e in April 2005.

The quality o f I D A lending was rated satisfactory. This status was ach ieved despite a l l

The number o f problem projects was reduced from t w o to ze ro ove r FY2003-06, even as 
the portfolio grew substantially from 13 to 22 projects. Over the same per iod , the disbursement 

ra t io increased f r o m about 19 percen t t o abou t 30 percent, and the p ro -ac t iv i ty index reached 100 
percent, suggesting strong lending f lows and q u i c k reso lu t ion o f p ro jec t imp lemen ta t ion constraints. In 
FY2006 , two pro jec ts were c lass i f ied as "po ten t ia l p rob lem pro jec ts" : the First P rog ramma t ic 
F inanc ia l Sector Deve lopmen t P o l i c y C red i t (FSDP) and Trade Fac i l i ta t ion and P roduc t iv i ty

delays re f lec t the comp lex design and multiple agencies engaged in implementing p ro jec t ac t iv i t ies . 
These d i f f icu l t ies have been aggravated by the change o f key personne l in the pa r tne r agencies

Stakeholders rated Bank supervision and performance as generally satisfactory. During 

consultations, stakeholders cons idered the FY2003 -06 B a n k p rog ram reasonab ly well a l igned with

though some stakeholders argued tha t imp lemen ta t ion was h indered by the comp lex i ty o f B a n k 
procedures and the lack o f ha rmon iza t ion be tween deve lopmen t partners.

Bank analytical and advisory work has informed the design of the Bank’s assistance 
program, whilst also serving a wider Government and donor audience. A l l p lanned core

Countrv Dialopue, Aid Coordination and Outreach 
Country dialogue has focused on PRS implementation, notably through the discussions

Complementing the G16 arrangements, the Government established working groups

Engagement with civil soc iety and outreach improved during the CAS period. The 
FY2003 -06 C A S consu l ta t ions engaged a b road spec trum o f c i v i l society. W h i l e c i v i l soc ie ty 
appreciated the oppo r tun i ty to commen t o n the strategy, some expressed f rus t ra t ion rega rd ing the 
limited in fo rma t ion p rov ided beforehand, and argued tha t the consu l ta t ions shou ld have been f o l l o w e d 
up during C A S imp lemen ta t ion . Respond ing to these concerns, consu l ta t ions with the Consu l ta t ive 
C o u n c i l f o r the PRS were held in December 2005 t o discuss an ea r ly d ra f t o f the C A S C om p l e t i o n 
Repor t . This has been f o l l ow e d by an extended consu l ta t ion process a round the FY2007 -10 C A S (see 
Annex F). Annua l mee t ings to rev iew progress in C A S imp lemen ta t ion have been proposed f o r the

a s ign i f ican t increase in press-coverage o f the B a n k during FY2006 . These e f fo r ts w i l l con t inue under 
the fo r thcom ing CAS. 

F. K E Y CONSIDERATIONS FOR THE FY2007-10 CAS 

67. 
Bank assistance should focus on a narrower range o f sectors and reform objectives. 
P o l i c y discussions with Governmen t have been too broad , m a k i n g i t d i f f i c u l t f o r the Gove rnmen t t o 
focus o n a manageable r e f o rm agenda, S im i la r ly , p ro jec ts have been dispersed a round a la rge number 
o f sectors, suppor t ing the PRS o n too b road a f ron t . D ispe rs ion o f the Bank ’s assistance has hampered 
coo rd ina t ion e f fo r ts and led t o the B a n k in te rven ing in areas that are n o t c lose ly linked to the Bank ’s 
compara t ive advantage. D ispe rs ion o f the Bank ’s f inanc ing has also limited the Bank ’s capac i ty t o 
bring a c r i t i c a l l e v e l o f resources to bear to address constraints in Honduras ’ development. Tha t said, 
the p i l o t in i t ia t ives suppor ted under the B a n k - no tab ly as regards P i l o t L a n d Access P ro jec t and 
hea l th serv ice decen tra l iza t ion - have had an impo r tan t demons tra t ion e f fec t by show ing h o w 
inves tmen ts in these areas c o u l d have a s ign i f ican t impac t if app l ied sys tema t ica l ly . Fur thermore , the 
B a n k p ro jec ts have p rov ided a veh ic le f o r p o l i c y adv ice as well as f inanc ing w h i c h has been 
recogn ized by the B a n k and other stakeholders as an impo r tan t element o f B a n k assistance. F o l l o w i n g 
this assessment, the Bank ’s FY2007 -10 C A S w i l l focus o n a na r rowe r range o f p o l i c y issues and 
pro jec ts . Future B a n k f inanc ing w i l l be focus address the k e y constraints to g r ow t h and pove r ty 

65 

reduc t ion cons is ten t ly identified in B a n k ana ly t ica l w o r k no tab ly : improvemen ts in r u r a l p roduc t iv i ty , 
in fras truc ture prov is ion , the qua l i ty o f education, and governance and ins t i tu t iona l per formance . 

68. 
The Bank should take political constraints into account when supporting reform 
programs and encourage the authorities to build constituencies for reform. Pressures f r o m vested 

interests have managed t o s ta l l some o f the mos t press ing re fo rms . The B a n k w i l l need a mo re 
e f fec t ive commun ica t ion strategy to s t imu la te pub l ic debate and i n f o r m k e y stakeholders about p o l i c y 
options i f the r e f o rm agenda i s to succeed. At the same time, p o l i c y d ia logue shou ld take in to account 
p o l i t i c a l constraints. The PRSC r e l i e d o n leg is la t ive instruments t o advance many o f the key re fo rms . 
Th is m a y n o t a lways be the mos t e f fec t ive means o f suppor t ing r e f o rm in Honduras . P o l i t i c a l factors 
may be re levan t when selecting the ins trumen ts f o r ach iev ing p rog ram ob jec t ives . 

69 . 
Linking policy dialogue, investment projects and analytical w o r k tends to bring the best 
results. 

I t has p roved easier t o make progress in the r e f o rm agenda where re fo rms have been 
grounded in we l l-d issem ina ted ana ly t ica l wo rk , p o l i c y d ia logue has been focused o n a we l l -de f ined 
program, such as the PRSC, and imp lemen ta t ion i s supported by techn ica l assistance and inves tmen t 
lending. The PRSC instrument has p roved a m u c h mo re e f fec t ive ins trumen t f o r sustained d ia logue o n 
p o l i c y p r io r i t ies and f o r assisting the Governmen t address the challenge o f r e f o rm imp lemen ta t ion 
than the a l terna t ive o f standalone pro jec ts and ana ly t ica l wo rk . O ther ex terna l partners appreciate the 
oppo r tun i ty fo r structured p o l i c y d ia logue p rov ided by the PRSC. 
Imp lemen ta t ion o f the r e f o rm 
p rog ram has required s ign i f ican t techn ica l assistance inputs. In th is con tex t , the PR SC - T AC has 
p roved a f lex ib le t o o l f o r de l ive r ing techn ica l assistance to support re fo rms . Where the re are 
s ign i f ican t investments requ i red to imp lemen t re forms , these m a y be de l ive red mo re e f fec t ive ly 
th rough re la ted inves tmen t pro jec ts . 

70. 

Institutionalization and continuity a r e critical for achieving development objectives. A t 

the cross-government leve l , the PRS has ensured p o l i c y con t inu i ty , n o t least because the strategy has 
been based o n extensive consu l ta t ions . A t the same time the PRS o f fe rs su f f ic ien t f l e x i b i l i t y to 
accommodate Government’s chang ing p r io r i t ies and lessons learned. L i m i t e d progress has been made 
in deve lop ing such instruments at the sector leve l . Deve lopmen t o f sector strategies w o u l d p rov ide a 
mo re coherent, coun t ry - led f ramewo rk f o r the de l ive ry o f B a n k assistance. This i s an area where the 
B a n k w i l l need t o co l labora te with Government, c i v i l society and other ex te rna l partners in the 
fo r thcom ing C A S pe r iod . Progress in this area w i l l also p rov ide an oppo r tun i ty to g radua l ly a l ign 
B a n k assistance with sector p lans and programs . At the same there i s a need t o ensure con t inu i ty in 
B a n k projects. O f pa r t icu la r concern i s the replacement o f p ro jec t s ta f f f o l l o w i n g changes in 
adm in is tra t ion , con t r ibu t ing to imp lemen ta t ion delays and increas ing f iduc ia ry r i s k s . At the p ro jec t 
leve l , measures shou ld be taken t o imp rove con t inu i ty o f s ta f f ing th rough the adm in is t ra t ion trans i t ion . 

71. 

Projects tend to be more effective where there i s close coordination across Bank sector 
teams and projects build on the results of other interventions. A no tab le success in th is con tex t 

has been FHIS V’s inves tmen t in m u n i c i p a l p lann ing which has p rov ided a founda t ion fo r the R u r a l 
In fras truc ture , B a r r i o Ciudad, D isas ter Vu lne rab i l i ty and Fores try and R u r a l P roduc t iv i ty Pro jec ts . 
There i s po ten t ia l f o r greater in teg ra t ion o f p ro jec t team w o r k i n g o n the competitiveness, r u r a l 
deve lopmen t and in fras truc ture agendas. 

72 . 

Bank performance monitoring systems should use and support national systems. The 

ou tcome ind ica tors o f the 2003 C A S shou ld have been linked mo re c lea r ly t o B a n k in terven t ions to 
fac i l i ta te per formance eva lua t ion . The f u t u r e C A S shou ld exp l ic i t ly link targe t ind ica to rs and baseline 
data to the Bank in terven t ions . The B a n k shou ld support the deve lopmen t o f na t iona l s ta t is t ica l 
in fo rma t ion systems. A t the p ro jec t leve l , a t ten t ion shou ld tu rn t o s treng then ing execu t ing agencies’ 
in fo rma t ion systems to pe rm i t m o n i t o r i n g o f sector per formance ra ther than simply building 
standalone p ro jec t m o n i t o r i n g systems.

A recent Bank assessment concluded that 62 percent o f Honduran territory and 92

Emergency response and damage assessments in the wake of a disaster a r e generally 
coordinated by other UN agencies and international NGOs which specialize in emergency rescue 

and assistance operations. Post-disaster damage assessments are best ca r r ied ou t by agencies with 
expertise n o t linked to f inanc ing ins t i tu t ions , whose recommenda t ions to governmen t can, therefore, 
b e s e e n to be ob jec t ive . In prev ious na tu ra l disasters in Cen t ra l Ame r ica these assessments have often 
been conduc ted by E C L A C . I t i s recommended that in the case o f Honduras the B a n k and the IDB, 
w h i c h w i l l be w o r k i n g c lose ly together o n a m u t u a l l y suppor t ive disaster management program , agree 
t o j o i n t l y f inance such damage assessments by a third pa r ty that w o u l d be chosen by a m u t u a l l y agreed

The FY2007-10 CAS has been prepared through a broad participatory process involving 
representatives of a wide range o f government and non-governmental organizations. The C A S 

Consu l ta t ions in Honduras were ca r r ied out over an extended p e r i o d (see B o x 1). This annex p rov ides 
a summary o f the i s s u e s ra ised du r ing consultations, concen tra t ing o n the discussions during the f i n a l

were selected in consu l ta t ion w i t h Government. In each o f the consu l ta t ion sessions, the B a n k 
presented a b r i e f summary o f the ra t iona le and objectives o f the CAS , the purpose and scope o f the 
consultations. F o l l o w i n g the presentation, sessions were g iven ove r t o a modera ted discussion. The

Participants in the consultations were universally supportive o f the consultation Drocess 
and appreciated the quality o f the information shared in advance, but argued that follow-up 
consultations would be needed to monitor implementation. The consu l ta t ion process was 

considered m u c h mo re systematic and open than par t ic ipan ts had experienced in p rev ious B a n k 
consultations. Par t ic ipan ts pa r t icu la r ly appreciated the fac t tha t the d ra f t Resu l ts M a t r i x was made

were adamant that the B a n k and other ex terna l partners’ assistance shou ld b e de l ive red within the

Representatives o f civil society, regional and the

The Bank’s assessment that macro-economic stabilitv and accelerated growth was a 
significant achievement was questioned by some as being o f limited value without progress in 
poverty-reduction, while others voiced concern regarding the fragility o f the economic situation. 

In severa l sessions, d iscuss ion turned t o the apparent con t rad ic t ion be tween the recent progress in

s tab i l iz ing the macro-econom ic s i tua t ion and imp rovemen t in econom ic pe r fo rmance and lack of 
progress in pove r ty reduc t ion . M a n y par t ic ipan ts argued tha t g r ow t h has been driven, in large 
measure, by the surge in remittances and questioned the sus ta inab i l i ty o f these resource i n f l ow s and 
the long - te rm soc ia l and econom ic impac t o f massive m ig ra t ion . Severa l pa r t ic ipan ts men t ioned the

Both civil society and the private sector regard DR-CAFTA as a threat as much as an

C. 
PARTICIPANTS’ VIEWS ON THE BANK’S PROGRAM 
10. 
There was broad agreement on the priorities identified for the Bank program, 
particularly the proposed focus on rural development, but participants sought assurance that 
the Bank’s assistance would be targeted to the rural poor and small-farmers in particular. Some 

par t ic ipan ts were concerned that the proposed focus o n “rura l bus inesses ” w o u l d end up exc lud ing 
those mos t in need, a rgu ing instead tha t the poorest farmers needed support in increas ing p roduc t iv i ty 
o f staple crops be fo re diversifying i n t o higher risk, mo re inpu t in tens ive marke t-or ien ted agr icu l ture . 
O ther par t ic ipan ts endorsed a business-oriented approach to suppor t increases in r u r a l incomes but 
po in ted ou t tha t special measures w o u l d need to be taken to ensure tha t the r u r a l poo r h a d access to 
c red i t and techn ica l assistance. Representatives f r o m the organ ized small-scale producers and o ther 
groups po in ted to var ious attempts at rev i ta l iz ing the ag r icu l tu ra l sector in Honduras ’ recent h is to ry , 
pa r t icu la r ly ag r icu l tu ra l mode rn iza t ion programs imp lemen ted in the ear ly 1990s . These groups argued 
tha t the B a n k shou ld take i n t o account the lessons learned f r o m this experience. 

11. 
Participants encouraged the Bank to continue programs related to improving access to 
land and land securitv, which a r e seen as major constraints to the rural poors’ efforts to escape 

poverty. Par t ic ipan ts f r o m a w i d e range o f c i v i l soc ie ty organ iza t ions and f r om Congress highlighted

underlined the impor tance o f the Bank - f inanced L a n d Adm in is t ra t ion Program, a rgu ing tha t this 
p rog ram shou ld be accelerated and ex tend ing i t s reach i n t o r u r a l areas. Par t ic ipan ts also no ted tha t the 
regu la r iza t ion o f land tenure was n o t enough to redress the inequa l i ty in land access. The P i l o t L a n d 
Access P ro jec t was re fe r red to as one o f the few p ro jec ts to address this p rob lem , by assisting the 
landless purchase l a n d as pa r t o f a package o f inves tmen ts that assisted bene f ic iar ies establish sma l l -

ANNEX G : DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS 

1. 
This Annex summarizes the preliminary findings of a debt sustainability analysis @SA) 
that i s being carried out by a joint Bank-Fund team using the joint Low-Income Country Debt 
Sustainability Framework (LIC-DSF). The full D S A analysis w i l l be made publicly ava i lab le a t the 
http:www.worldbank.org/debt. The resu l ts de r ived f r o m this DSA analysis do no t impac t IDA ’S

Honduras’ debt burden declined significantly since the H I P C D e c i s ion point in 2000 as a 
result o f H IPC and MDRI debt relief. The to ta l ex terna l debt in n om i n a l terms (pub l ic and p u b l i c l y 
guaranteed) represented 80.8 percen t o f GDP at end-1999 and was b rough t d o w n t o 50 .1 pe rcen t at 
end-2005, f o l l o w i n g the H I P C Comp le t ion Po in t . This ra t io has been fu r the r reduced o n accoun t o f

Summary. The p re l im ina ry resu l ts o f th is DSA suggest tha t a l l deb t ra t ios rema in b e l o w the

Parameter 
100 percent 

l e v e l limit 

Remarks / ExDlanation 
The Bank may selectively finance up to 100 percent o f 
ind iv idua l pro jec t costs. T h i s w o u l d b e determined 
based o n the IDA f inanc ing envelope, the pro jec t 
context, and any co- f inanc ing by other partners. 
Counterpart funding w i l l be encouraged. Examples o f 
t h e t y p e o f projects where 100 percent f inanc ing i s l i k e l y 
include: operations with strong l o c a l commun i ty 
participation, environmental pro tec t ion and b iod ive rs i ty 
conservation, reg iona l programs (e.g.; HIV/AJDS). 
Techn ica l assistance projects and ins t i tu t iona l 
development grants may also be candidates f o r 100 
percent financing. Cost-sharing i s l i k e l y to b e the r u l e in 
inftastructure projects. The Bank expects to m o v e 
increasingly towards SWAPS (especially in the soc ia l 
sectors), where IDA f inanc ing i s expected t o be a sma l l 
share o f to ta l program cost.

that: (i) financing requirements for 
the country’s development

expected domestic borrowing; and 
(ii) the financing o f fore ign

N o n e 

N o taxes or duties are currently iden t i f ied as unreasonable

consider whether taxes and duties constitute an 
excessively high share o f project expenditures.
