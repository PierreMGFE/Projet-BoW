Execu t ive Summary 

1. 
This Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) i s being presented at a time when 
Romania i s a t the threshold o f European Union (EU) membership. The Accession 
Treaty was signed on April 25, 2005 and entry i s expected to take place on January 1, 2007. 
Romania faces the challenge o f convergence with EU countries in terms o f both incomes and 
living standards - i t s per capita GDP in 2004 i s about one-third o f EU - 1 5 ' and i t lags in 
several social indicators. To meet this challenge, Romania w i l l have to build on i t s 
achievements and at the same time address risks to macroeconomic stability. 

2. 
EU accession aspirations have enhanced macroeconomic stability and spurred 
renewed commitment to reforms in recent years. The economy grew robustly at 4 to 5 
percent per year during 2000-05, with inflation declining from above 40 percent in 2000 t o 
8.6 percent in 2005, the lowest level since the start o f transition. Structural and institutional 
reform accelerated during the same period - private sector share o f GDP has moved closer to 
EU -8 * levels, more than 90 percent o f banking asse ts are now held by the private sector, 
energy reform has resulted in a substantial reduction o f quasi-fiscal deficits, and 
independence o f the judiciary has been strengthened. 

3 . 
Nonetheless, Romania still has to complete the ongoing reform agenda which i t 
w i l l have to pursue to underpin growth and improve living standards. The restructuring 
of the enterprise sector i s by no means complete. Financial intermediation i s still low 
compared to that o f EU -8 . Increasing productivity in the agriculture sector remains a major 
development challenge. Further improvements i n the business environment include 
increasing labor market flexibility and reducing labor taxation., A skills mismatch with 
market needs w i l l require a reorientation o f the educational system. Poor governance and 
weak institutional capacity continue to be key concerns. 

4. 
Fiscal r i s k s to macroeconomic stability w i l l have to be addressed and monitored 
closely by the Government, especially 
in a situation where there i s no Fund 
arrangement in place. Maintaining financial discipline, sustaining energy sector 
restructuring, reforming the social security system, and properly managing the substantial 
costs o f upgrading infrastructure and environmental standards to meet EU requirements are 
priorities to reduce f i s c a l vulnerabilities. I n addition, to improve allocational efficiency o f 
public spending, bold reform o f the expenditure planning and management systems i s 
required. Finally, there i s a need to upgrade the ability to mobilize revenues to co-finance the 
absorption o f EU funds and provide resources fo r the reforms envisaged in several sectors. 

5 . 

While there has been significant progress in poverty reduction, benefits o f 
renewed growth have to fully filter through to all segments o f the population. The gap 
between urban and rural living standards as well as regional disparities w i l l have to be 
narrowed. The restructuring o f the agriculture sector, which i s likely to result in excess 
labor, w i l l have to be accompanied by measures to mitigate the adverse social impact. 
Sustainable policies and programs supporting rural and regional development w i l l have to be 
designed and implemented successfully. Coverage o f social assistance programs needs to be 
improved and targeted poverty reduction measures w i l l have to be well designed to ensure 
sustainability and impact.

Execu t ive Summary 

6. 
The CPS aims to support Romania in addressing the above challenges to 
facilitate its integration with the EU. The Government has requested the Bank for support 
based on the recognition o f the Bank’s value added and deep knowledge o f Romania. The 
strategic framework o f the CPS, developed with the Romanian Government, builds on the 
Government Program, lessons from the EU-8, and Bank analytical work. The CPS has th ree 
pillars: (a) accelerating structural and institutional reforms to support sustainable growth; (b) 
addressing f i s c a l vulnerabilities and modernizing the public sector; and (c) targeting poverty 
reduction and promoting social inclusion. The CPS lists a set o f principles that w i l l govern 
the choice and design o f Bank lending operations. 

7. 
Bank support w i l l be characterized by greater flexibility and responsiveness 
within the strategic framework. This means an evolution from the previous CAS to a new 
CPS that en ta i ls : (a) a more flexible approach to lending and non-lending activities in which 
broad priorities are established with a defined program during the first phase corresponding 
to the EU accession period and an indicative program to be more clearly defined by end- 
FY07 for the second phase covering the post accession period; (b) the use o f policy 
performance benchmarks to trigger lending up to a ceiling and to define a minimum set o f 
standards for sec tora l engagement; and (c) movement towards alignment o f Bank procedures 
with country systems. Bank programs in Romania w i l l continue to incorporate elements o f 
the Middle Income Country (MIC) agenda, including reducing project preparation time, 
accelerating project completion, and introducing new products and approaches. 

8 . 

Bank lending w i l l use a mix o f instruments with strategic use o f Development 
Policy Loans (DPLs) and programmatic approaches. The program w i l l be anchored to 
the ongoing Programmatic Adjustment Loan (PAL) s e r i e s and the successor Fiscal and 
Governance DPL both o f which w i l l underpin the sectoral reforms supported by other 
operations. The Analytic and Advisory Activities (AAA) program w i l l be frontloaded and 
w i l l contribute important inputs to the design o f lending operations. In addition, the Bank i s 
offering a full array o f financing and risk management products. To enhance assistance for 
institution building, the World Bank Institute (WBI) w i l l include Romania as one o f i t s focus 
countries in FY07. The CPS has a results framework accompanied by a monitoring and 
evaluation mechanism. 

9 . 

A flexible lending program o f $450 to $550 million per year i s proposed to 
support the strategic objectives o f the CPS. Base case lending w i l l be investment projects 
which are subject to pre-conditions o f appropriate sector policy and acceptable medium term 
sector expenditure framework. High case lending w i l l be a combination o f investment and 
development policy lending where the latter w i l l require maintenance o f an appropriate 
macroeconomic framework as per Bank guidelines. A periodic assessment o f the 
macroeconomic framework and performance w i l l be done by the Bank in consultation with 
the Fund and the EU. This i s especially important without a Fund arrangement in place. 
Should the assessment indicate that the macroeconomic framework has deteriorated such that 
investment lending would not achieve i t s objectives, there would be a low case scenario o f 
AAA and global goods lending. Bank exposure i s manageable and even at maximum 
lending, the Bank exposure w i l l remain below the guideline thresholds with some exposure 
indicators declining. 

10. 
I F C and M I G A will support Romania’s EU accession and integration agenda. 
IFC’s main goal in Romania i s to support private sector development, helping local 
companies benefit from opportunities and meet challenges during the EU accession and 
integration period. 
IFC w i l l further increase i t s volume and scope o f investment and 

Executive Summarv 

i i i 

advisory services in order to strengthen market forces and help Romania’s economy integrate 
into the EU’s single market, especially through support o f large national-level privatizations 
in infrastructure, where IFC support and private sector involvement w i l l help increase 
reliability and affordability o f services for consumers. When feasible, IFC w i l l complement 
the Bank’s work in the energy sector. Also, Romania i s a large market with a banking sector 
among the least developed in the region. 
IFC w i l l seek to introduce new financing 
instruments and to develop non-bank financial institutions. M IGA w i l l be open for 
opportunities to support foreign investors, particularly in the infrastructure sectors through 
the provision o f sovereign and sub-sovereign political risk. 

11. 
The proposed program faces a number o f risks. First, failure to promptly address 
emerging weaknesses in the macroeconomic framework including f isca l vulnerabilities, 
especially in the absence o f a Fund program, could a f f e c t adversely the absorption o f EU 
funds and result in a deterioration o f the policy environment o f the proposed Bank 
operations. Second, slippages in the implementation o f the reform agenda - due for example 
to the political impact o f a delay i n EU membership - would have an adverse impact on 
sustained growth and poverty reduction, and consequently on convergence with the EU 
members. Third, lack o f attention to strengthening institutional capacity would put at risk 
program implementation. These risks are mitigated by the consensus on the EU accession 
and convergence objectives as well as the provisions o f the Growth and Stability Pact, which 
would help focus Government attention on critical structural and institutional reforms. 

Board members may wish to discuss the following aspects: 

0 Does the CPS adequately respond to the needs o f Romania, balancing flexibility and 
client responsiveness with a strategic framework to guide and focus the program? 

0 Are the suggested principles for Bank lending engagement appropriate? 

COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY FY 2006 -2009 

I. Country Context 

A. 

Political Developments 

1. 
En t ry into the European Union (EU) i s expected to take place on January 1, 
2007, and this expectation drives Government policies and actions. Negotiations were 
formally concluded i n December 2004 and the signing o f the Accession Treaty o f Romania 
took place on April 25, 2005. Nonetheless, the EU w i l l continue to monitor Romania’s 
progress to ensure completion o f a l l necessary reforms and commitments undertaken as part 
o f the acqu is communau ta i re . A safety clause was introduced in the Treaty, specifying that 
entry may be delayed by one year i f Romania does not comply with key requirements. 
Fourteen E U members have already ratified the Accession Treaty, but the ratification by a l l 
current 25 EU national parliaments i s by no means assured. An updated progress report w i l l 
be issued by the European Commission (EC) in May 2006. The report i s perceived as a 
decisive signal on whether Romania w i l l achieve accession in 2007, and w i l l be discussed 
during the June summit o f EU leaders. 

2. 
The E C Comprehensive Monitoring Report, issued in October 2005, reconfirms 
the functioning market economy status o f Romania and underscores the need to tackle 
high level corruption and address the low level o f preparedness for absorbing EU 
funds. The Report acknowledges that the country continues to meet the political 
requirements for membership. The assessment notes the recent decisive steps to reform the 
judiciary, at the same time drawing attention to the need to accelerate public administration 
reforms and implement effectively the new judicial legislation, with focus on the fight 
against corruption. The Report also recognizes that macroeconomic stability has been 
broadly maintained, although the imbalances have widened recently, and c a l l s for the 
vigorous implementation o f the structural reform agenda. The subsequent dialogue between 
the E U and Romania largely r e f l e c t s the findings and recommendations o f the Monitoring 
Report. 

3. 
Parliamentary elections held on November 28 ,2004 brought to power a coalition 
government led by the National Liberal Party (NLP) and Democratic Party (DP) 
Alliance, and consisting o f t w o other smaller parties. Traian Basescu, the NLP/DP 
candidate, was elected president in a second-round run-off against the Soc ia l Democratic 
Party (PSD) candidate, former Prime Minister Adrian Nas tase . The elections failed to result 
in a clear majority - defections or new allegiances could tip the balance o f power. A 
government reshuffle took place in August 2005. The polls continue to indicate high popular 
support for the N LPDP Alliance, which may be able to form a government on i t s own in the 
case o f early parliamentary elections, which remain a possibility. 

4. 
Government policies continue to be driven by EU accession requirements. 
Implementing the unfinished accession agenda i s central to the program o f the Government. 
Delays in the implementation o f the pre-accession commitments for EU membership could 
jeopardize timely entry in 2007. Postponed E U membership, in turn, could engender a 
political backlash, perhaps reviving the influence o f extremist voices, and discourage 
investors, who are increasingly attracted by the E U accession prospects o f the country. 
Nonetheless, messages coming from the EC in recent weeks have been largely positive, 
praising the progress made, especially i n the area o f judiciary, giving hope for accession on 
schedule. 

2 

Romania Country Par tnersh ip Strategy 

5 . 
Achieving EU membership in 2007 i s the main priority fo r a l l parliamentary 
parties, in spite o f differences in political orientation and approach to reforms. This 
reflects the strong support for EU accession, manifested at a l l levels o f the Romanian society. 
Surveys constantly show that more than 80 percent o f the Romanian population desires rapid 
integration into the EU structures. The accession process and the implementation o f the 
related commitments to reach EU standards, some o f which w i l l extend significantly a f t e r the 
accession date, w i l l therefore remain the strongest anchor for structural reforms, irrespective 
o f the party configuration o f the governments which come to power i n the future. 

B. 

Economic Developments 

6. 
EU accession aspirations have enhanced macroeconomic stability and spurred 
renewed commitment to reforms in recent years. Un t i l 2000, Romania was one o f the 
poorest performing economies o f Central and Eastern Europe (CEE). The turnaround in 
2000 was preceded by a protracted and precipitous decline i n GDP, a peaking o f the poverty 
rate to 36 percent, and inflation o f 54 percent per year. By contrast, during the last five years 
the economy grew robustly at 4 to 5 percent per year, led primarily by investment and 
exports, and occasionally by consumption in response to improved confidence in banks and 
macroeconomic consolidation. Inflation declined from above 40 percent in 2000 to 8.6 
percent in 2005, the lowest level since the start o f the transition. Good macroeconomic 
performance contributed to a record level o f o f f i c i a l reserves, which have increased several- 
fold s ince 2000, exceeding Euro 18 billion recently equivalent to about 6 months o f 
prospective imports. 

7 . 

Romania has been pursuing a broad structural and institutional reform agenda 
which has accelerated in recent years. The pace o f privatization o f commercial companies 
picked up sharply i n 2004 though i t slowed down somewhat i n 2005. FD I has substantially 
picked up in 2004 and 2005, with inflows exceeding 5 percent o f GDP yearly. Important 
energy sector privatizations have been completed: privatization contracts were signed for 
four electricity distribution companies, the s ta te petroleum company Petrom, and the two gas 
distribution companies. Firm bids have been submitted for another electricity distribution 
company, and the authorities have moved forward with the appointment o f advisors for the 
privatization o f thermal electricity generators. I n addition, the state owned Commercial Bank 
o f Romania (BCR), the largest bank, has been privatized and binding bids are expected to be 
submitted for the privatization o f the Savings Bank (CEC). 
Institutional and governance 
reforms are advancing, with the first generation measures - the establishment o f the legal 
framework and the redesign o f the institutional architecture - e i ther already adopted or in the 
process o f being implemented. 

8. 
While overall the macroeconomic and structural reform performance i n recent 
years has improved compared to the 1990s, Romania continues to lag the EU-S3 New 
Member States (NMS) in some areas. While Romania’s growth rate during the past five 
years compares well with the EU-8, Romania has the lowest GDP per capita at PPP and lags 
in several soc ia l indicators. Improvements in competitiveness have been limited, while parts 
of the economy remain unrestructured. Subsidization o f the enterprise sector through arrears 
accumulation, while substantially declining in 2005, has not been fully eliminated. 
Agricultural productivity i s low and only slowly improving, while employment in 
subsistence agriculture remains much larger than anywhere e lse i n Europe. Labor market

flexibility w i l l have to be increased and administrative barriers faced by businesses further 
reduced to improve the business climate. Implementation o f programs to upgrade public 
administration, strengthen the judiciary, and reduce corruption w i l l have to be accelerated to 
achieve impact and meet EU accession commitments. Table 1 compares Romania’s 
performance with the EU-8.

9. 
I n 2005 macroeconomic weaknesses have begun to surface. Real GDP growth 
was 4.1 percent in 2005, down from 8.3 percent in 2004. A lower agricultural output and a 
slowdown in industrial production, partly related to the appreciation o f the currency against 
the Euro and the impact o f floods, are the explanations for the deceleration o f growth i n 
2005. The 2005 year-end inflation was 8.6 percent, down from 9.3 percent i n 2004, but 
above the target o f 7.5 percent. The consolidated budget deficit was, at around 0.8 percent o f 
GDP, below the 1 percent target. However, revenues to the budget have increased by around 
8-9 percent in rea l terms, driven by strong VAT collection. Preliminary figures show a 
substantial increase, o f over 10 percent in real terms, o f the revenues to the consolidated 
budget in Q1 2006. The current account deficit widened to 9.2 percent o f GDP, compared to 
government’s 7.5 percent target, owing to the stubbornly high aggregate demand which 
increased by 9.4 percent, driven by consumer credit growth. 
I n an attempt to restrain 
resurging inflationary expectations, the cen tra l bank resumed, since November, large-scale 
sterilization o f foreign exchange inflows, and hiked the policy interest rate to 8.5 percent in 
February, up from 7.5 percent. 

10. 
Economic policy measures introduced in 2005 have triggered additional short- 
run macroeconomic challenges. The prevailing economic challenges are related to some 
pre-election measures, such as the increase in c iv i l service wages, but compounded by the 
f i s c a l measures adopted at the beginning o f 2005. The two most important measures were 
the introduction o f the f la t tax (16 percent) on incomes and corporate profits and the 
concomitant launch o f an adjustment i n the state pension levels for some categories o f 
pensioners. The underlying revenue loss due to such f isca l measures was around one percent 
o f GDP, but the Government i s optimistic that the f i s c a l package would help reduce the large 
informal economy, with a positive impact on revenues and investment in the medium to long

term. I t i s too early to assess the impact o f the f i s c a l package. Furthermore, the reduction o f 
enterprise arrears and quasi-fiscal deficits remains a challenge, although the energy related 
quasi-fiscal deficits have declined substantially s ince 2002. Added to this was the 
liberalization of the capital account, an EU accession commitment, which prompted the 
central bank to rapidly lower interest rates in 2005 to reduce speculative inflows and slow 
down exchange rate appreciation. This fueled private consumption, which was already on 
the upturn due to the increase in disposable income. 

11. Most of the recent surge in aggregate consumption above its long term trend 
comes from the private sector and has affected the savings - investment balance. The 
strength o f private sector demand, up over 9 percent year-on-year in 2005, ca l ls for the 
containment o f deficit-financed public expenditure to avoid macroeconomic instability. 
Un t i l the private sector pressures abate, additional public expenditures w i l l have to be tax 
financed, including through improved compliance, or compensated through expenditure 
savings elsewhere. There i s also an issue o f what the optimal level o f spending i s from the 
perspective o f sustainable growth. While Romania’s levels o f revenue collection and 
spending as percent o f GDP are among the lowest compared to EU members, they are not 
low relative to other middle income countries that have experienced sustained high growth 
largely driven by the private sector. An assessment o f how the situation evolves w i l l be 
made in the context o f the periodic review o f the macroeconomic framework and the 
monitoring o f the CPS. 

12. 
Despite a widening current account deficit, the external financing position o f the 
country has remained comfortable, though vulnerabilities remain. Romanian bond 
spreads show a continuing decline and the average maturity o f the foreign debt portfolio has 
increased. While there i s no expectation o f difficulty in financing the current account and 
budget deficits in the foreseeable future, risks and vulnerabilities triggered by credit 
expansion growth and exchange rate volatility continue. I n addition, the liberalization o f the 
capital account has opened the window to large speculative foreign exchange inflows, 
attracted by the relatively high nominal interest rates. These inflows have put a significant 
additional upward pressure on the exchange rate, threatening the external competitiveness o f 
the economy. A t the same time real in te res t rates have remained negative which has added 
stimulus to credit-based consumption expenditure. 

13 . 
Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) i s expected to r ise following EU accession, but 
will subsequently decline due to the completion of privatization. Significant progress i n 
structural reforms including the acceleration o f privatization especially in banking and the 
energy sectors, and the improvement in the functioning o f the business environment are 
expected to bring important FD I inflows, particularly within the next two years. FD I w i l l 
therefore contribute substantially to financing the large current account deficit, which i s 
likely to remain above 5 -6 percent o f GDP over the medium term. However privatization 
w i l l eventually come to completion within a few years time, with impact on the FD I inflows, 
which are expected to decline. 

14. 
Romania’s gross external financing requirements are expected to increase over 
the medium term, driven by the obligation to co-pay for the absorption o f the EU funds. 
Under the assumption o f sustained economic growth and access to the EU Structural and 
Cohesion Funds (SCF) after 2007, the external financing needs, including a further build-up 
in foreign exchange reserves, are projected to expand from around US$9.0 billion currently 
to over US$12 .5 billion in 2009. This dynamic assumes continued access o f Romania t o the 
private international capital markets. The bulk o f the financing w i l l be required in order to 

Roman ia Countvy Par tnersh ip Strategy 

5 

co-finance and pre-finance capital expenditure projects eligible fo r funding under the SCF. 
The amount o f grants coming under the SCF w i l l be up to 4 percent o f GDP per year. The 
fu l l absorption of the SCF w i l l undoubtedly prove a tremendous challenge, as the experience 
o f the NMS indicates. The situation i s exacerbated by the requirement that Romania, as an 
EU member state, contribute to the EU common budget. Preliminary estimates indicate that 
this contribution i s expected to be around Euro 800 - 900 million per annum i n the early 
years, or around 1 percent o f GDP, an important revenue loss for the budget, which needs to 
be compensated. 

15 . 

Improving the capacity to co-finance EU SCF grants requires increasing the 
revenue collection rate. The government has established a medium term goal o f enhancing 
revenue as a percent o f GDP by 3-4 points, bringing i t closer to other CEE countries. 
Revenue collection i s expected to improve gradually through the widening o f the tax base 
and improvements in revenue administration and tax compliance, including by taking a 
tougher stance against non-payers. However, due to the existing rigidity o f public 
expenditure, mainly in recurrent spending, i t w i l l prove difficult to rationalize and reallocate 
resources in the short run in order to make space for the co-financing o f EU grants. As l e v e l 
o f capital expenditures i s currently low at around 2.7 percent o f GDP, Romania w i l l need to 
resort to borrowing in order to be able to absorb greater shares o f the SCF available to the 
country after 2007. 

16. 
Against this background, the IMF confirmed publicly that the Stand By 
Arrangement (SBA) that was approved on July 7, 2004 was o f f track at end-October 
2005. The Fund’s Executive Board concluded the 2006 Article I V Consultation on Apr i l 26, 
2006 and a Press Information Notice (PIN) was published on May 4. In his statement to the 
Board, the Romanian representative reported that the Romanian Government did not intend 
to continue discussions on the SBA. The arrangement w i l l therefore expire in early July 
2006 without completion o f any reviews beyond the first one (on September 22, 2004). The 
main divergence o f positions between the IMF and the Government concerned the direction 
of fiscal policy, and i t s role in helping the authorities address Romania’s sizeable 
macroeconomic imbalances. The Fund expressed concern about the government’s recent 
decision to increase the consolidated 2006 budget deficit target t o 0 .9 percent o f GDP, and i s 
skeptical that the 5 (+I- one) percent year-end inflation target can be met. While the Fund 
recommended wage restraint in the public sector as a means o f dampening inflationary 
pressures, i t observed that Romania’s government revenue i s considerably below levels in the 
EU and regretted the sizeable revenue loss resulting from the introduction o f the f la t tax. 
Thus, i t emphasized a need for revenues to be increased permanently to provide counterpart 
funds for EU grants, cover Romania’s contribution to the EU budget, and meet other pressing 
developmental needs. Moreover, although the Fund welcomed the recent tightening o f 
monetary policy, they observed that the relaxation o f f i s c a l policy may significantly 
complicate the ability o f the central bank to achieve i t s goals, especially i n light o f substantial 
capital inflows and its efforts to establish a credible inflation targeting regime. The Fund 
predicted a further widening o f the current account deficit to 9 percent o f GDP i n 2006 and 
expressed concerns an overburdened monetary policy could lead to rapid currency 
appreciation undermining the current competitive advantage o f firms i n the tradable sector. 
Both the Fund and the Romanian authorities indicated that, even without the formal 
framework o f a SBA, they would like to continue an active and close dialogue on policy 
matters.

Developments in Poverty Reduction, Gender Equality, and MDGs 

17. 
Poverty dynamics confirm the robust relationship between growth and poverty 
r e d ~ c t i o n . ~ The general poverty rate declined from 3 5 . 9 percent in 2000 to 18.8 percent in 
2004 due mainly to the resumption o f growth during the period. Poverty reduction i s being 
pursued through a two-pronged strategy: (a) improving the targeting and coverage o f the 
social protection programs; and (b) establishing the fundamentals fo r economic growth. 
While rural poverty also declined from 47.8 to 27.3 percent during 2000-04, there continues 
to be significant disparity between urban and rural areas (1 1.6 vs. 27.3 percent poverty in 
2004). 
I n Romania, there i s a strong association between economic growth and poverty 
reduction - the 2003 Poverty Assessment projected that maintaining an annual growth ra te o f 
5 percent in GDP per capita during 2002-07 would reduce poverty by almost half. While 
growth has tended to increase inequality, these increases have been modest, suggesting that 
growth needs to be a central component o f the poverty alleviation strategy. However, the 
benefits brought by restored growth have failed to fully f i l t e r through to some large 
categories o f population, such as the Roma, the disabled, or single-parent families. 
Improvements in their situation w i l l continue to require s ta te support, but with more 
emphasis on targeting and coverage than in the past. 

18. 
The restructuring o f agriculture i s likely to result in significant labor 
retrenchment and requires careful management, Agriculture necessitates special 
attention in Romania because o f its high contribution to employment. While i t s share i n 
GDP i s around 11-14 percent, agriculture continues to be the largest employer in Romania, 
accounting for more than 30 percent o f the labor force, most o f which are i n subsistence 
agriculture. Because o f the reliance on self-employment in agriculture, unemployment in 
rural areas i s much lower than among the urban population. These numbers are 
unsustainable, as the experience o f the EU countries suggests, and a sharp decline in 
agricultural employment should be expected in the coming years. The high average age o f 
the population working in agriculture and its reduced skill levels limit the transferability o f 
workers to alternative jobs. One can thus expect the productivity-driven reforms o f the 
agricultural sector and the adoption o f the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) regulations to 
trigger a strong push effect, sending labor from agriculture out o f the labor force. Mitigating 
the anticipated adverse consequences o f this phenomenon w i l l require paying attention to the 
social assistance needs o f those with a high chance o f being displaced from agriculture. The 
success in reducing extreme poverty through the Minimum Income Guarantee program 
introduced in 2002 sets a good example o f effective instruments fo r this type o f assistance. 
Encouraging alternative employment opportunities and supporting income-generating 
activities in the rural areas, away from agriculture, should reduce the restructuring costs for 
the sector. 

19. 
Statistical evidence indicates a large degree o f gender equality in Romania and 
there i s no evidence o f restricted access fo r women to public services such as health o r 
education. For instance, enrollment rates across education levels are similar for men and 
women, and so are the soc ia l returns t o education. However, there are differences regarding 
labor participation and remuneration. The employment rate o f women (52.1 percent in 2004) 
i s around 10 percent lower than that o f men and around 4 percent lower than the EU-15 
average, The decline in both male and female employment participation seems to have 
bottomed out i n 2003. Females have better chances o f finding a job. This occurs primarily 
due to the expansion o f the services sector, where job creation seems to favor s k i l l s which are 

~~

Roman ia Coun t ry Pa r tne rsh ip Strateav 

9 

more associated with women, such as secretarial positions. A t the same time the pronounced 
decline o f mainly mining and manufacturing industries has affected men more than women. 
Consequently, unemployment i s higher among men than among women. 
In 2003, for 
example, the overall unemployment rate was 7.4 percent, while for females it was only 6 .8 
percent. Youth and long term unemployment appears to affect men and women similarly. 

20. 

Reaching the Millennium Development Goals. The Millennium Development 
Goals (MDG) are expressed as improvements targeted fo r 2015 relative to performance in 
1990 . Because o f the weak economic growth in much o f the 1990s when social indicators 
worsened, Romania might have difficulty achieving some o f the MDGs. School enrollment 
rates were already high at the end o f the Ceausescu period and the 100 percent primary 
enrollment MDG target 
i s reachable, but even this modest increase w i l l require 
improvements in school financing mechanisms and efforts to enhance quality and equity. 
Similarly, the trends in health are such that the MDGs can be reached, but serious issues o f 
budgeting, finance and hospital management must be addressed to keep the progress on 
track, HIV/AIDS and child mortality targets are within reach, but the incidence o f 
tuberculosis has risen sharply. The MDGs for water access are likely t o remain elusive, 
reflecting significant challenges in infrastructure and service provision more broadly.

11. EU Accession and Development Challenges 

A. 

Country Objectives and the Priorities o f the Government Program 

2 1 . 
The overarching long term objective o f Romania i s to achieve convergence with 
the EU in terms o f income and living standards. With a GDP per capita o f around 3 3 
percent o f the EU -15 average, Romania has a large unfinished development agenda, 
Reaching the standards o f the current EU members represents the main long term challenge. 
These standards re fe r not only to achieving comparable income levels and economic 
performance, but also to establishing the quality o f the governance framework and the 
robustness o f the institutions that form the foundation o f democracy and functioning markets, 
Ensuring that growth f i l t e r s through to the poor and vulnerable, especially i n the rural areas 

I O 

Romania Coun try Par tnersh ip Strategy 

and backward regions, and that there i s equitable access to quality public services (health, 
education, roads, water) are key pillars o f Romania’s EU integration agenda. 

22. 
The political agenda o f the current administration i s articulated in the 
Government Program f o r the period 2005-08. The Program i s centered around the 
objective o f joining the EU in 2007 and meeting the obligations deriving from the status o f 
member o f the Union. This entails, first, the need to accelerate the implementation o f the 
pre-accession commitments assumed as part o f the acquis, and, second, the need to pursue 
priority reforms which would place Romania on a sustained and accelerated convergence 
path with the current EU members. 

23. 
The Government strategy o f accelerating convergence with the EU has three 
main components. First, the Government acknowledges the need t o enhance 
competitiveness and establish a business environment conducive to private sector-led 
high economic growth in order to catch up with EU members. The Government Program 
recognizes the linkage between infrastructure and human capital development and economic 
growth, and highlights the requisite o f broadening the growth base by ensuring the 
participation o f vulnerable categories o f population in growth. I n this context, the main 
priorities presented in the Program are 
infrastructure modernization; improving the 
competitiveness o f agriculture and addressing the rural development challenge; and 
enhancing human capital development, with emphasis on education, health and soc ia l 
inclusion. 

24 . 

Second, the Government views reforming the mechanisms f o r f isca l management 
to be central to improving the efficiency, transparency and accountability o f public 
spending and the absorption o f the EU structural and cohesion funds. The absorption o f 
EU funds poses significant challenges for the f isca l system in terms o f both prioritizing 
expenditure and channeling the resources where the needs are, and for mobilizing the 
necessary counterpart funds, which could be i n the range o f 1-2 percent o f GDP per year. 
The Government Program recognizes these challenges and envisages a bold reform o f the 
revenue collection and administration and expenditure management mechanisms. Enhancing 
f isca l discipline by improving tax compliance and reducing quasi-deficits i s an integral part 
o f this agenda. 

25. 

Third, the Government Program emphasizes the need to modernize the public 
sector by strengthening governance and the capacity o f public institutions to effectively 
fight corruption. The Program envisages a set o f public administration reforms aimed at 
consolidating the institutional capacity o f the central and local administration, promoting 
f isca l and administrative decentralization and reforming the delivery o f public services. An 
integrated national anti-corruption strategy i s being implemented. The strategy i s built on 
several pillars: strengthened independence and accountability o f the jus t ice system; enhanced 
c iv i l society participation in decision-making; reform o f the public sector management 
mechanisms; and improved regulatory framework for the enterprise sector.

Box 2: EU Accession vs. EU Integration 
Bo th the Romanian Government Program and the World Bank CPS distinguish between two 
concepts: accession and integration. Accession i s the process through which Romania jo ins the E U 
by meeting the membership criteria. Integration i s the process o f catching up w i th the current E U 
members and successfully reaping the benefits o f membership by pursuing the necessary structural 
reforms i n a stable macroeconomic environment. To accede in to the EU, Romania needs t o meet a 
number o f specific criteria, la id down by the 1993 Copenhagen European Council: 
0 Political criteria: Stability o f institutions guaranteeing democracy, the rule o f law, human rights 
and respect for and protection o f minorities. 
Economic criteria: Existence o f a functioning market economy, as we l l as the capacity t o cope 
w i th competitive pressure and market forces w i th in the Union. 
Institutional criteria: Ab i l i ty to take on the obligations o f membership by transposing into 
national legislation and effectively implementing the acquis communau ta ive (the core body o f 
E U regulations). 
Fulfillment o f the political criteria i s a prerequisite fo r the initiation o f accession negotiations 
between a candidate country and the European Union. The E U regularly assesses the progress made 
by a candidate country through Progress Reports or Comprehensive Mon i tor ing Reports. 
Through the CPS, the Bank supports both accession and integration. Although there i s no t always a 
clear distinction at the level o f individual projects between the two objectives, some projects are 
designed w i th the view t o pr imar i ly support accession by meeting the acquis commitments (e.g. the 
Judicial Reform Project, P A L 2, P A L 3 or Municipal Services Project), while others are intended t o 
enhance integration, by improving the allocational efficiency o f public resources and increasing the 
competitiveness o f the economy (e.g. the Revenue Administration Reform Project, the Transport 
Project or the Fiscal and Governance DPL).

Challenges of EU Integration 

Lessons from EU-8 NMS

There are several lessons from the experience o f the EU-8 New Member States 

(NMS) applicable to Romania. First, ear ly and substantial progress in f isca l conso l ida t ion 
and re fo rms i s necessary t o mee t the f inanc ia l demands o f EU accession, such as EU - re la ted

Accelerating Structural and Institutional Reforms 

28 . 
Strengthening governance and upgrading institutional capacity are areas of 
concern to the Government and stakeholders, especially in public administration, fiscal 
management and judiciary. While governance and institutional capacity issues have been 
flagged in the FY2002-04 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), both the CLER’ and the CAE6 
recommend that these should continue to be addressed i n future Bank programs. Romania 
has lagged behind other CEE countries i n terms o f level o f institutional development as 
measured by EBRD Transition Indicators. Romania also lags the East European regional 
average on six governance indicators tracked by the WBI. I n addition, several chapters o f 
the acquis focus on governance and institutional strengthening (e.g., Chapter 24 -Justice and 
Home Affairs; Chapter 2 8 - Financial Control; Chapter 29 - Financial and Budgetary 
Provisions), with progress in these areas being critical to meeting the current timetable fo r 
accession. The following areas, which are consistent with Romania’s EU aspirations, have 
been identified by both the OED and QAG reports as priorities: 
C iv i l service reform i s needed to establish a meritocratic, professional, and 
depoliticized c i v i l service, funded with a sustainable public wage b i l l and transparent salary 
setting mechanisms. 
The decentralization agenda w i l l have to be supported by institutional strengthening 
o f municipalities and addressing current misalignment between f i s c a l decentralization and 
fknctional devolution. 
Public expenditure management 
requires strengthening to mitigate 
f i s c a l 
vulnerabilities, improve ability to absorb and strategically a l loca te post accession EU funds, 
and meet EU membership obligations on budget aspects. 
Judicial reform w i l l have to be sustained to strengthen the independence o f the 
judiciary, increase the efficiency o f courts, upgrade the professional level o f judges and court 
personnel, and improve quality o f judgments. 

a 

29. 
The capacity of the justice system to cope with the rigors o f EU accession 
requires further improvements, and the successful implementation and enforcement o f 
the acquis have to be accelerated. The 2004 EC Progress Report identifies the functioning 
o f the judiciary as one o f the main vulnerabilities o f Romania in its quest for EU 
membership. While substantial steps have been taken lately in strengthening the institutional 
independence o f the judiciary by enhancing the oversight role o f the Superior Council o f the 
Magistracy (CSM), the efficiency o f the courts remains low. Increasing the accountability o f 
the judiciary, developing effective mechanisms for monitoring and evaluating performance, 
increasing the professionalism and integrity o f judges and enhancing the budgetary autonomy 
o f the courts continue to be core priorities o f the justice reform agenda. I n the fight against 
corruption, efforts have focused so far on promoting legislative measures and l e s s on their 
effective implementation. 

30. 
Slow and inefficient enterprise reform o f the past has left Romania with a legacy 
of a number o f enterprises to be privatized o r liquidated compared to other CEE 
countries. Public enterprises are the core o f the un-restructured part o f the economy, 
especially in energy, mining and railways. I n the last few years, the share o f new firms, 
weighted by employment, i s high and compares well with other CEE countries and thus

1 3 

many new firms have started operations. 
In contrast, the share o f exits, weighted by 
employment, i s very low compared to new entries. This reflects the dominant role o f 
unrestructured public enterprises over a competitive fringe o f private businesses, Key 
actions to address the situation include the following: 
Energy sec tor restructuring, especially the privatization o f the remaining distribution 
and generation companies, needs to accelerate, following a slowdown in recent months. 
Concomitant with the gradual liberalization o f the energy market, this would ensure the 
private investment inflows necessary to upgrade the obsolete technology and reduce energy 
production costs and losses in networks. The Government has recently prepared a new 
Energy Sector Reform Strategy for the period 2006-2008, which aims t o address the 
remaining challenges facing the sector. 
The privatization program o f commercial companies w i l l have to be accelerated and 
completed. As important, the modes o f privatization should enable restructuring and establish 
good governance. 
Strengthening the financial discipline o f the enterprise sector i s fundamental. 
While 
both direct and indirect subsidies have been declining, the reforms should be sustained to 
ensure continued declining trend. 
3 1 . 
Financial intermediation in Romania remains low compared to other CEE 
countries and capital markets are thin and short term. Developing efficient financial 
intermediation requires sustaining the structural and institutional reforms, more specifically 
the completion o f the privatization o f the banking system and the strengthening o f the 
regulatory and supervisory infrastructure, especially for non-bank financial institutions 
(NBFIs). Privatization t o foreign strategic investors i s expected to improve governance, 
strengthen the capital base, and increase activity in the banking system. Capital market 
development requires a series o f reforms, including issuance o f secondary legislation in line 
with EU directives, modernization o f the capital market infrastructure, and increasing the 
supply of domestic securities, in particular, the development o f a government bond market. 
The municipal bond market i s on an upwards trend (Bucharest, the capital, successfully 
issued in 2005 i t s first bond on the international market), but the regulatory framework needs 
further strengthening.

Improving the business environment will be a key driver o f growth. The 
elimination o f administrative barriers to private enterprise development, the success fu l 
implementation o f anti-corruption initiatives, and the simplification o f the Labor Code have 
been identified by investors as areas to be addressed. Discretionary practices in the 
enforcement o f legislation lead to concerns about a lack o f level playing field. Although 
rising since 2004, FD I levels are low compared to other CEE countries, especially in 
greenfield investment. There i s also a large informal economy. More specifically: 
While Romania has made important progress in reforming its business licensing 
regime, notably with the introduction o f the silent consent rule, the pace o f reform w i l l have 
to be sustained. Bankruptcy legislation needs to be enforced expeditiously and without 
discrimination. 
Businesses report that rigid employment laws are a significant obstacle to their 
performance. The Labor Code adopted in 2003 added more rigidities in the labor market and 
w i l l require substantial changes to enhance flexibility and reduce transactions costs for 
companies. 
The statutory rates o f labor taxation remain high, despite some reductions i n soc ia l 
insurance contributions. The combination o f high labor tax rates and inflexible labor market 
rules contributes to a relatively large informal sector as a percent o f GDP and employment.

Increasing investment i n human capital and addressing the s k i l l s mismatch with 
market needs are necessary fo r successful integration with the EU. Although Romania

15 

has significantly advanced in reforming i t s education system, average education outcomes 
continue to be relatively low, indicating that there are s t i l l many problems to be addressed. 
I n international evaluations (Trends in International Mathematics and Sc ience Study - 
TIMSS - and Program for International Student Assessment - PISA), Romania continues to 
have mean scores lower than OECD averages and lower than the scores o f Bulgaria and the 
EU-8 NMS. The fundamental changes that have occurred in the economy throughout 
transition have led to a shift in the demand for skills o f graduates. This indicates a need for 
the reorientation o f the education programs, both for pre-university and university levels, to 
respond to the new labor market needs. The education reform strategy needs to shift towards 
a student centered teaching, flexible feedback rules to link the education system and labor 
market conditions, and stronger competition among education institutions, including 
universities, for public resources and private sector funding.

3 5 . With more than 50 percent of the national road network in poor condition 
primarily due to inadequate financing of road maintenance, road transport costs are at 
present 30-60 percent higher than what they should be. I n addition, Romania lacks high 
standard roads along the major trade corridors, resulting in a road t r a f f i c injury rate that i s 
more than three times the EU average. I n the railway sub-sector, the significant f a l l in freight 
and passenger volumes during 1990s requires rationalization o f the network and services, as 
well improvements in labor productivity. Romania also needs a longer term strategy for 
railway to ensure the financial viability o f the railway infrastructure company and to 
modernize the infrastructure. For improved trade facilitation, the measures already 
implemented at border crossings for road transport need to be extended to other modes, in 
particular railway and inland waterway. For fu l l implementation o f the ucquis, there s t i l l 
remain technical compliance issues that need to be addressed to improve trade logistics. The 
estimated investments required to upgrade the major transport corridors and to maintain the 
existing infrastructure amount to Euro 20 billion over the 15-year period 2006-2020. 

Addressing Fiscal Risks and Enhanc ing EU Funds Absorption 

36 . 
The energy sector has been central to the persistently large quasi-fiscal deficits, 
although there has been significant progress in addressing arrears, due to reforms, 
Energy subsidization - in the form o f low energy b i l l collection rates and pricing o f energy 
services below fu l l cos t recovery - was extensively used i n the past to support loss making 
enterprises with adverse impact on the basic energy infrastructure. Since energy company 

16 

Romania Country Partnership Strategy 

losses were often financed with tax arrears and unpaid loans, these have added to the rising 
stock o f public debt. Romania has progressively addressed f i s c a l and quasi-fiscal deficits in 
the energy sector and major breakthroughs have been achieved. Table 5 shows Romania's 
progress. 
Electricity and gas tariffs have been adjusted to cost recovery levels, 
B i l l 
collection has been improved over several years and i s currently highly satisfactory, These 
accomplishments enabled Romania's electricity and gas distribution privatizations. As part 
o f energy privatizations, arrears built up in the past are being written off, in a process t o be 
completed when thermal generators are privatized and units remaining in the public sector 
are closed or restructured possibly including bankruptcy proceedings. T h e district heating 
sector continues to accumulate new arrears. The situation i s becoming increasingly c r i t i c a l 
as central government subsidy support i s being reduced without measures to improve the 
operational and financial performance o f the heating companies.

The social security system could be a source o f long-term fiscal risk. The high 
statutory levels o f social contributions (at 47.5 percent o f the gross salary) discourage 
participation and push workers into informal employment. Despite the introduction o f the 
flat income and profit tax, and several reductions o f the social assistance contributions in 
recent years, the number o f contributors remains lower than the number o f beneficiaries, 
leading to an endemic deficit o f the public pension fund. Pension system deficits are likely 
to grow substantially without further reform. With financing gaps mainly covered by the 
state budget, overall government deficits and public indebtedness w i l l tend to r i s e . Despite 
recent reforms, including a two-year inc rease in the statutory retirement age and a widening 
o f the contribution base to include the self-employed, farmers and the unemployed, the 
pension system remains unsustainable. The urgency for reform i s increasing, because o f the 
projected slowdown o f population growth and the steady aging o f the population, which w i l l 
increase the demands on the system. 

3 8 . 
There continues to be a significant gap in terms o f health outcomes and financial 
resources compared to EU countries. Further improvements are needed to improve the 
quality o f service delivery and strengthen governance, including the development o f an 
accreditation body for health services and amendments to the legal framework for health 
f a c i l i t i e s . 
Increasing the efficiency, equity and transparency o f financing - including the 
containment o f pharmaceutical costs and better definition o f the benefit package covered by 
health insurance - would help to rationalize services and control costs. Key actions to 
enhance use o f service capacity include developing models o f care adapted to rural and 
remote areas, closing or converting underutilized hospital facilities i n accordance with 
national and regional strategies, and investing in complementary services such as home care 
and ambulatory and daycare services. There should also be an increased focus on resolving 
the problem o f informal payments.

39. 
The high cost of upgrading environmental standards will have to be managed 
with an appropriate expenditure policy and strengthened institutional capacity. 
I n 
relation to the EU-8 N M S , Romania i s starting out with a poorer state o f the environment. 
The estimated cost o f environmental investments needed to meet EU standards i s therefore 
comparatively large - about Euro 30 billion during the period 2004-15, the highest among 
CEE countries. A large proportion o f these costs are expected t o be financed by local 
governments and the private sector. There are significant f i s c a l and institutional challenges 
in the water and waste water sector as well as in solid waste management. Population with 
access to water supply i s 6 8 percent and to sewerage 52 percent. At present, about 5 5 
percent o f wastewater i s treated and the untreated water creates environmental risk. The 
demands for solid waste management are equally daunting - an estimated 30 percent o f the 
population does not have access to an organized system o f solid waste collection and 
management. A proper sequencing o f the investments i s needed to ensure that those with the 
highest benefits are given priority. A systemic and sustained effort i s required to build 
capacity at a l l administrative levels to facilitate absorption o f EU environment related funds. 

40. Mobilizing the revenue necessary to cofinance the absorption o f EU grants, 
finance Romania’s contribution to the EU common budget, and provide the resources 
for the reforms envisaged in several sectors i s likely to prove a major challenge. 
Revenue collection as percent o f GDP i s lower than those o f EU member states, although 
higher than in some fas t growing countries with a similar GDP per capita as Romania. The 
recent introduction o f the 16 percent flat income and corporate profit tax has opened an 
additional gap in revenue collection. Relatively high expenditure rigidity makes spending 
reallocations difficult i n the short run. The requirement to cofinance EU structural and 
cohesion funds and the obligation to contribute to the EU common budget place additional 
burdens on public spending. The unification o f the collection and administration 
responsibilities fo r income and profit taxes and health, unemployment and social insurance 
contributions under the National Authority for Fiscal Administration i n 2004 has brought 
further challenges in terms o f institutional and operational consolidation o f revenue 
administration. 

41. 
Improving the allocational efficiency o f public spending requires a bold reform 
o f the expenditure planning and management systems. Developing the capacity to absorb 
and efficiently a l loca te the EU post-accession grants necessitates a better prioritization o f 
public spending, where the strategic policy directions from the Government are reflected in 
the formulation o f the budget. Better alignment o f spending allocations with performance 
should help create additional f i s c a l space. The capacity for strategic planning has to be 
enhanced, especially i n the social sectors, as increases in public spending i n some areas i n 
recent years, such as in health, have not led to significant improvements i n related economic 
and social indicators, signaling important inefficiencies in expenditure management or the 
need for sector reform. The National Development Plan, under which the structural and 
cohesion funds w i l l be allocated, ought to be integrated into the budget process and the move 
towards the establishment o f a medium-term budget framework needs to be accelerated. 
Fiscal decentralization reforms should be better correlated with functional devolution. 
Updating accounting, internal and external &dit and control systems i s required in order to 
assess to what extent resource distribution i s reflected in improved results. 

42. 
Public expenditure management i s undergoing major reforms. Following the 
recommendations o f the 2003 Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA), the 
overall management and coordination o f these reform e f f o r t s and the capability o f public 
sec tor managers to apply them effectively have been enhanced. This has been done through 

18 

Romania Country Partnership Strategy 

the establishment o f an Inter-Ministerial Committee for Public Financial Management (PFM) 
Reform and by implementing training programs fo r public sector managers and professional 
certifications o f 
internal auditors, expected 
to effectively promote management 
accountability. The Inter-Ministerial Committee has produced, as part o f the PAL agenda, a 
Strategic Development Plan for PFM Reform, which was formally endorsed by the 
Government in July 2005. The agenda includes the introduction o f a medium term 
perspective to the state budgeting process, the modernization and upgrading o f the Treasury 
systems, the introduction o f accrual-based accounting, and internal audit and external 
financial audit by the Court o f Accounts in line with internationally accepted standards. 
Many reform actions have been and continue to be supported by large scale technical 
assistance projects funded by the EU PHARE program, most notably in the fields o f financial 
control and audit. Reforms o f the budgetary process are currently being implemented with 
technical and analytical assistance from the World Bank. 

Reducing Poverty and Promoting Social Inclusion 

43 . 
Ru ra l development w i l l be an important component o f the poverty reduction 
strategy. The rural poor account for two-thirds o f the total poor in Romania with s e l f - 
employment i n agriculture as the main source o f income. Formal employment provides an 
escape from low productivity self-employment, but two constraints to formal employment 
are educational attainment (only one percent o f the rural population has achieved higher 
education compared to more than 7 percent in urban areas) and poor physical infrastructure 
(the rural road network i s extensive but poorly maintained). There i s poor water quality and 
lack o f water access in the rural areas, which contribute to the low health outcomes (infant 
mortality i s 22 per 1000 live births compared t o 1 5 in urban areas). Poor water and sanitation 
conditions in Romanian rural villages have recently been highlighted by the World Health 
Organization (WHO) as a high risk factor in control o f avian bird f lu transmission to humans. 
Developing the rural sector requires addressing the following issues : 

b 

Non-farm employment generation w i l l be important in absorbing the labor that w i l l 
be shed as the farm economy becomes more efficient. A vibrant rural non-farm economy 
requires a market-friendly business environment fo r SMEs, good physical infrastructure, and 
investment in human capital. 

b 

Increasing productivity on small and medium sized farms requires sustained efforts in 
several areas, including improved legal environment for land transactions, agricultural 
extension, and marketing infrastructure. 

44. 

Government policy promotes social inclusion and poverty reduction measures, 
targeted at disadvantaged groups. This policy w i l l contribute to the country’s continued 
stability, social cohesion, wider participation in growth, and economic integration. A Jo in t 
Inc lus ion Memorandum (JIM) was signed by the Romanian Government and the European 
Commission on June 20, 2005. 
I n the JIM, the following vulnerable social groups are 
identified: the Roma minority, children in state institutions, persons with disabilities, and 
youth over 1 8 leaving the state child protection system. In addition, victims o f domestic 
violence are identified as needing assistance. 

45. 
T o address the poverty o f the large Roma population, the Government has 
developed a social inclusion program. Significant gaps persist in school attendance rates 
for Roma children compared to national averages. Socio-economic conditions have made 
many highly vulnerable to diseases such as tuberculosis and H IV infections. Almost 21 

Romania Coun try Partnership Strategy 

19 

percent o f Roma live in houses for which they have no title. Only 12.9 percent o f the active 
Roma population i s formally employed, while 33 .6 percent are part o f informal employment. 
About half o f the recipients o f the Minimum Income Guaranteed (MIG) benefits are Roma. 
The Government has prepared the Decade Action Plan outlining the goals, targets, and 
indicators which it w i l l commit to achieving and monitoring in 2005-2015. 

46. 
The poverty risk of children i s still high: around 30 percent o f children under 
the age o f 15 are poor, compared to 23 percent o f the total population. Romania has the 
highest infant mortality rate (1 8.4 percent) o f a l l EU member states and candidate countries. 
The availability o f early childhood development (ECD) services has dramatically declined 
during the transition period; during 1990-2003, the number o f crkches has decreased to one 
third and the number o f enrolled children has decreased to one sixth o f the previous levels. 
The Ministry o f Education and Research (MER) has developed an Early Childhood 
Education (ECE) Strategy (2005-201 1) as part o f an envisaged Convergent Early Childhood 
Development (ECD) Strategy. 

47. 
A passive and non-inclusive protection system was inherited from the communist 
era, with poor quality care, delivered in large, obsolete, state institutions. Most s ta te 
institutions for Persons with Disability (PWD) have unacceptable conditions, due to financial 
constraints. The Government approved in September 2005 a Strategy for the Social 
Protection, Integration and Inclusion o f Persons with Disabilities (2006-201 3), as well as 
related action plans but institutional capacity to implement this strategy needs strengthening. 
Children leaving the care o f the s ta te institutions are not prepared for an independent l i f e and 
lack housing and employment. The Government has a program o f building multi-functional 
centers to temporarily ass is t these young people, but this program requires support fo r 
implementation. 

111. Bank Program and Past Strategy 

A. 

Past Bank Assistance 

48 . 
The Bank played a major r o l e in Romania’s transition. 
The Bank resumed 
lending in 1991 during the beginning o f Romania’s transition to a market economy. Between 
FY91 and 43 FY06, the Bank approved a total o f 50 IBRD financed operations with 
commitments o f US$ 5.0 billion, about $300 million a year. Lending volumes were higher in 
the 1990s at $ 3 3 5 million a year, compared to FY00-05 at $288 million per year. Adjustment 
operations accounted for about 40 percent o f total lending since 1991. The Bank’s financial 
assistance accounted for about 30 percent o f a l l net multilateral assistance over the 1992- 
2004 period, and 16 percent o f a l l net inflows, public and private. A t end-2004, debt to 
IBRD represented about 1 5 percent o f a l l external debt outstanding. Table 6 provides an 
indication o f the effectiveness o f Bank lending based on the 2005 Country Assistance 
Evaluation by the Operations Evaluation Department (OED).

The CAS Completion Report (CCR) which evaluated the previous CAS covering 
FY2002-04 cites several lessons applicable to the design o f the CPS. First, linking Bank 
support to EU priorities and improving coordination with the EU introduced synergies and 
increased government commitment to reforms. Second, the complementarity o f the Bank 
and Fund programs reinforced each other and c lose coordination helped ensure consistency 
o f approaches to issues. Third, institution building and governance reforms and outcomes 
have lagged those o f other CAS objectives, and the CPS would have to determine 
mechanisms t o strengthen political commitment to these reforms. Fourth, the agriculture 
interventions required a supporting policy framework and would have benefited from linking 
with an adjustment operation. Fifth, the AAA program should have been frontloaded and 
more tightly linked to the lending operations. Sixth, a stronger CAS focus on results, a more 
systematic monitoring and evaluation system o f program outcomes, and greater program 
flexibility would help improve effectiveness and relevance o f Bank support. Annex C 
contains the CAS Completion Report. 

50. 
The performance o f the active lending portfolio continues to be satisfactory, but 
the pace of project implementation has been slowing down. The current IBRD Romania 
portfolio o f active projects totals about US$1690 million and i s represented by 20 loans, 
three GEF financed projects, one guarantee operation, and seven grants. Romania’s 
disbursement ratio has continued its decline from a record high o f 27.4 percent i n FY03 to 16 
percent (vs. ECA average o f 23 .8 percent) in FY05. This decline reflects, in addition t o loan 
effectiveness delays7 and fiscally driven shortfalls in project funding, a combination o f 
several other factors: (a) the high level o f new commitments s ince May 2004; (b) 
depreciation o f dollar-denominated IBRD VSLs, which account for 73 percent o f $1.2 billion 
in undisbursed funds; and (c) implementation delays due to elections (a slow-down in the 
activity o f line ministries and high turnover o f Project Management Unit s ta f f) . Portfolio 
management efforts have intensified recently with the introduction o f quarterly reports on 
actions agreed with the government during the Joint Portfolio Review completed this 
calendar year, and the initiation o f a set o f key arrangements to accelerate project 
implementation and improve the management o f closing dates. 

51 . 
IFC’s strategies in Romania have tracked the trajectory o f the country’s 
progress from socialism to the f r e e market and EU candidacy, all within the past 
decade.* Romania became a member o f IFC i n 1991. Since then, IFC has committed about 
$720 million o f i t s own hnds i n 39 projects and has arranged $241 m i l l ion in syndications to 
support projects in the financial markets, telecommunications, food and beverage, general

sectors. 

manufacturing, o i l and gas, and infrastructure sectors. IFC has been directly involved i n the 
privatization and restructuring o f large state-owned enterprises i n the banking and u t i l i ty 
IFC has played an active role i n developing the f inanc ia l markets, including 
improving access to finance fo r small and medium enterprises and helping two large bank 
privatizations, Banc Post and Banca Comerciala Romana (BCR). After t w o failed 
privatization attempts i n 2002, with the financial and advisory support o f EBRD and IFC, 
BCR, the country’s largest bank, was successfully sold to Austria’s Erste Bank in December 
2005 at a record high price. IFC has also helped enterprises increase their competitiveness 
and attract foreign investors. Investments include financing o f the largest private placement 
for a Romanian risk (Romania’s first mobile phone company) and investing alongside 
foreign technical partners in general manufacturing - both greenfield and post-privatization. 
In addition, IFC has invested in regional projects that benefit Romania: Medicover in the 
health sector, Raiffeisen Bank International, and private equity funds. 

52 . 
S im i lar to IFC’s operations in other early transition economies, IFC’s Roman ia 
operations correctly emphasized the importance o f delivering a significant technical 
assistance and advisory services (TAAS) component ahead o f and alongside i t s investment 
operations to develop the soft infrastructure o f a market economy, especially in recognition 
o f Romania’s investment climate weaknesses. The bulk o f TAAS activities were in 
improving investment climate, private sector advisory and privatization transactions, which 
included innovative projects such as a concession for the first municipal water u t i l i ty and a 
health care delivery public-private partnership. 

5 3 . 
The level o f I FC activity picked up more recently as the prospects f o r EU 
accession and the attendant re fo rm momentum led to improvements i n Romania’s 
investment climate. From FY03 to FY06 (as o f end-April 2006), IFC has invested more 
than $529 m i l l ion o f i t s own funds, averaging $ 1 3 0 m i l l ion a year. As o f end-April 2006, 
IFC’s total investment portfolio in Romania stands at $540 m i l l ion (32 percent i n equity and 
68 percent in loan), o f which 78 percent i s in the financial sector, 12 percent i n infrastructure, 
7 percent in o i l and gas, and 3 percent in general manufacturing. This represents the 9th 
largest committed portfolio across IFC and the second largest in the Southern Europe and 
Central Asia region after Turkey. 

54 . MIGA’s outstanding guarantee portfolio in Roman ia consists o f eight contracts 
in the financial sector and four contracts in the services sector. M IGA ’s exposure i s 
predominantly in the financial sector. As o f end-March 2006, the Agency’s gross exposure 
in Romania i s about US$262 m i l l ion (equivalent to 4.7 percent o f M IGA ’s gross exposure), 
while the exposure net o f reinsurance amounts to about US$121 m i l l ion (equivalent to 3.6 
percent o f M IGA ’s net exposure). 

B. 

Rat iona le for and Principles o f B an k Support 

5 5 . 
Bu i ld ing on the experience accumulated i n the NMS and wor ldw ide , the Bank i s 
in a distinctive position to support Romania’s overarching objective o f achieving 
convergence w i th the EU. The Government i s cognizant that the unfinished agenda o f 
reforms remains large, and has requested Bank support in recognition o f the value-added o f 
the Bank’s broad expertise i n addressing development challenges. The Bank has been a 
valued partner throughout the country’s transition in almost a l l sectors, with a large portfolio 
o f existing projects and strong working relationships w i th policy makers and other 
government o f f ic ia ls . In recent years, the Bank has refocused or accelerated work in several 
areas critical to Romania’s E U integration process, 
including judicial and public 

22 

Romania Coun try Par tnersh ip Strategy 

administration reforms, revenue mobilization and public expenditure management. This 
work has already yielded useful results for the country and has been reflected in the EC 
Progress Reports. As Romania moves towards EU membership, there w i l l be a shift o f 
emphasis from legal and institutional harmonization to EU integration, which requires 
implementation o f structural reforms and institutional strengthening. These are areas where 
the Bank can provide value-added through i t s global expertise, l o c a l knowledge, and past and 
current involvement in Romania’s transition. 

56 . 

Stakeholder consultations and surveys in Ap r i l -May 2005 give an indication o f 
areas o f public concern, which are consistent with Government priorities. Insufficient 
infrastructure development and inadequate access to quality healthcare and education are 
considered the main obstacles to the sustainable development o f Romania (see Annex E). 
The need for successful EU integration i s viewed as the key development priority, followed 
by reduction o f corruption, improving the business climate, improving government and 
justice system effectiveness, and reducing poverty. I n general, Bank support i s positively 
rated with almost a third o f survey respondents highlighting the importance o f financial 
resources from the Bank, 17 percent emphasizing analytic and advisory activities, and 15 
percent valuing the Bank’s knowledge. 

57 . 
The nature o f Bank engagement in Romania has been evolving and there are 
several factors that point towards a new approach in supporting the country’s 
development. First, Romania has completed the negotiations o f the acquis communautaire 
and expects to be a member o f EU from January 1, 2007. Second, over the past two to three 
years, Romania has established a track record o f sustained reforms and macroeconomic 
stability, in contrast to the inconsistency o f the 1990s. Third, Romania i s a Middle Income 
Country (MIC) with an investment grade and access to external sources o f funds. Finally, 
with Romania not extending the current SBA or entering a new one, the Bank could play an 
expanded role. Building on the lessons from the EU-8 NMS, the Bank w i l l have to define i t s 
role in a changed and changing environment i n Romania. 

5 8 . 

Bank support should move towards greater flexibility and responsiveness within 
a strategic framework, anchored on the EU integration process. This means an evolution 
from the previous CAS to a new CPS that entails: (a) a more flexible approach to lending and 
non-lending activities in which broad priorities are articulated for the CPS period with a 
defined program during the first phase corresponding to the EU accession period and an 
indicative program to be more clearly defined by end-FY07 for the second phase covering 
the post accession period; (b) the use o f policy performance benchmarks to trigger lending up 
to a ceiling based on creditworthiness and exposure limits and to define a minimum set of 
standards fo r sectoral or thematic engagement; and (c) movement towards alignment o f Bank 
procedures with country systems in line with the “Use o f Country Systems” initiative and the 
concept o f entity and sector accreditation contained in the Framework for EU8 countries, 
Bank programs in Romania w i l l continue to incorporate elements o f the M IC agenda, 
including reducing project preparation time, accelerating project completion, and introducing 
new products.

The strategic framework that guides the future Bank program in Romania 
focuses on facilitating economic integration and social cohesion with the EU. Building

on both the lessons from EU-8 NMS and Government program, the CPS framework has three 
pillars: (a) accelerating structural and institutional reforms to support sustainable growth; (b) 
addressing f i s c a l vulnerabilities and modernizing the public sector; (c) targeting poverty 
reduction and promoting soc ia l inclusion. The outcomes to be generated from this 
framework are summarized in the results matrix attached as Annex B9. Several Bank studies 
provide more detailed analysis o f the main issues and priorities within each pillar, and the 
AAA program w i l l complement or update the work done so far. Periodic consultations with 
the Government w i l l review the priorities and initiatives, modify them as needed, and if 
necessary change the mix o f operations and instruments. 

60. 

The choice and design o f lending operations follows several principles. First, 
Bank lending should finance priority Government programs that are already included in the 
expenditure envelope and avoid generating unnecessary additional public spending. Second, 
the lending program would ass is t the Government in increasing revenues and improving the 
efficiency and effectiveness o f public expenditures. Third, Bank support would focus on 
systemic solutions and programmatic approaches, including the move towards use o f EU 
consistent country systems. Fourth, the client would have increased flexibility in the choice 
o f appropriate lending instruments. Fifth, the Bank projects would help Romania absorb 
optimally the EU hnds that would become available post accession. Sixth, Bank projects 
would improve Government capacity to mobilize various funding sources such as EIB and 
Council o f Europe Development Bank. Finally, Bank projects would include institution 
building components, including reforms to improve transparency and contribute to the anti- 
corruption objective o f the Government. The indicative lending program i s attached as 
Annexes B3a, and the links to the outcomes are described in the results matrix in Annex B9. 

D. 

Key Components of Bank Support 

P i l la r 1: Accelerating Structural and Institutional Reforms fo r Sustained Growth 

61. 
The Bank w i l l continue to support the implementation o f structural and 
institutional reforms to underpin private sector led growth and increased productivity. 
There i s an ongoing reform agenda, including completing the privatization program covering 
manufacturing SOEs and the banking system, improving the business climate, sustaining 
energy sector restructuring, increasing agricultural sector productivity, improving the 
educational system to upgrade skills, and meeting EU environmental standards. 

Completing the Privatization Program and Other Structural Reforms 

62. 
Programmatic Development Policy Loansg (FY07-08). The PAL program includes 
components o f structural reform in the financial and enterprise sectors as well as actions to 
improve the business environment, including the reform o f the labor code. The measures 
supported by the PAL program are expected to contribute to the following outcomes to be 
achieved by the end o f the CPS period: (a) completion o f the'privatization o f manufacturing 
SOEs; (b) increase i n private sector share o f banking assets to 100 percent; (c) liberalization 
o f electricity and gas markets to meet EU requirements including 100 percent liberalization 
o f the electricity market; (d) reduction in the rigidities in hiring and firing as measured by the 
Cost o f Doing Business indices compared to 2005; (e) decline i n regulatory uncertainty 
compared to 2005 as measured by BEEPS; and (0 increase in the employment rate o f

population aged 15-64 from 5 8 percent i n 2004 to 60 percent i n 2009. The PAL program 
w i l l be accompanied by investment loans in the areas o f energy and business environment. 

63. 

Energy Loans (FY08-09). Continued energy reform i s a key component in 
Romania's integration process into the European Union. Two energy operations are included 
in the CPS to support the privatization o f electricity distribution and generation, compliance 
with EU environmental standards in particular desulphurization, and implementation o f 
market liberalization in line with EU directives and regional market integration within the 
Energy Community o f South East Europe. The operations w i l l contribute to the outcome o f 
100 percent electricity market liberalization by end-2009, as well as to the privatization 
program and the reduction o f quasi-fiscal subsidies. IFC w i l l continue to work with the Bank 
to introduce private sector participation in a transparent, competitive, and sustainable 
manner. 
IFC i s ready to provide financing and advisory services and can help mobilize 
private sector funding. 

Business Environment Loan (FY09). 

64, 
The focus o f this operation w i l l be on 
fostering the competitiveness o f the enterprise sector to enable l o c a l companies to overcome 
the significant competitive pressures which w i l l emerge once Romania joins the EU. The 
objective o f this operation i s consistent with the Lisbon revised agenda, articulated in the EC 
"Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Program" fo r 2007- 13 . The project, together 
with WBI's program, w i l l contribute to enhancing and leveraging the use o f the EU funds for 
implementing the competitiveness agenda o f the Government. Bank A A A work in FY06-07 
and .IFC's Competitiveness Study w i l l help define the components o f the Business 
Environment Loan. I n 2004, the Romanian Government asked IFC for a comprehensive 
study to measure competitiveness o f Romanian industry and recommend any measures 
needed to improve it. Funding for this Competitiveness Study w i l l come from IFC 
($500,000), the Government o f Spain ($400,000) and the Government o f Romania 
($300,000). The study w i l l begin implementation this calendar year. These initiatives w i l l 
support the outcome o f improving the business climate as measured by BEEPS and the Cost 
of Doing Business indices (the quantification o f the outcome targets w i l l be determined 
during loan preparation). 

Upgrading Skills and Reducing Labor Taxation 

Human Development DPL Se r ies (FY07-09). 

65. 
The HD DPL series includes 
components to support: (a) development o f human capital to help achieve accelerated 
economic growth and increased competitiveness; and (b) reduction o f labor taxation through 
reform o f the pension system. Education reform w i l l build on past and current Bank 
operations and w i l l focus on improving quality assurance and accountability. The DPL series 
w i l l assist the Government's program o f implementing the multi-pillar system by 2008. The 
DPL s e r i e s w i l l contribute to the following outcomes: (a) improvement i n education quality 
by 2.5 to 5 percent during the CPS period as measured by assessments and examination 
results; (b) reduction in secondary education drop-out rate from 1.7 percent in 2004 to 1.2 
percent in 2009; and (c) reduction in labor taxation by 2 percentage points between 2005 and 
2009. 

Improving Agricultural Productivity 

66. 
Fa rm Restructuring Loan (FY07). The proposed Farm Restructuring Loan w i l l 
support improvement in the competitiveness o f family farms, their absorption capacity for 
EU Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) funds, and the integration o f Romanian farmers into 

Roman ia Country Partnership Strategy 

25 

the European market for agricultural products. The loan w i l l build on recent reforms 
implemented by the Ministry o f Agriculture and assist the Government i n addressing 
structural constraints, in particular the rigidities in land markets. The expected outcomes o f 
the operation are: (a) increased activity in land markets as measured by number o f land 
registrations and lease contracts (the quantification o f the outcome targets w i l l be determined 
during loan preparation); and (b) decrease in the share o f agriculture employment to total 
employment from 32 percent in 2004 to 28 percent in 2009 . 

Reducing Transport Costs 

67. 
Transport Sector Support Loan (FY07). The objective o f this operation i s to 
provide support to the implementation o f the Government’s program for infrastructure 
development as well as rehabilitation and maintenance o f road and rail networks. The loan 
w i l l focus on maintenance and rehabilitation o f national roads and railway lines as well as 
improvements in the capacity and efficiency o f the agencies responsible for transport 
infrastructure in Romania. The loan includes a component piloting the implementation o f 
improved management and financing for Judet (county) roads. IFC can potentially help with 
the increase o f access to financing o f sub-sovereign entities. WB I support w i l l assist in 
promoting public-private partnerships in the road sector. The loan w i l l help the Government 
meet the transport related commitments under the acquis, including the commitment to raise 
road user f e e s to reflect marginal cost o f road use, and reduce costs o f road maintenance. 
The project w i l l contribute to the outcome o f reduction o f transport costs by: (a) increasing 
the percentage o f national roads in good or fair condition from 67 percent in 2005 to 75 
percent in 2 0 0 9 ; and (b) increasing railway track utilization (in thousand traffic units per 
route kilometer) from 2,223 in 2005 to 3,000 in 2009 . 

Upgrading Environment Standards 

68 . 
Environment Management Loan (FY07). The project w i l l make investments and 
build capacity in institutions coordinated by the Ministry o f Environmental Protection and 
Waters to implement the environment acquis and effectively absorb EU Funds. The loan 
w i l l focus on three technical pillars: (a) promotion o f nitrate reduction in line with the EU 
Nitrates and Water Framework Directives; (b) development o f institutional capacity and a 
project pipeline for EU Structural funds targeting contaminated lands; and (c) institutional 
support to a new National Agency for Protected Areas and Biodiversity Conservation. The 
loan w i l l also support equipment and training to help certify environmental laboratories. As 
EU membership brings obligations fo r fu l l integration o f global environment issues into 
national policies, a program o f Global Environment Facility (GEF) support w i l l complement 
technical pillars o f the Environment Management Loan. The grant program intends to target 
GEF focal areas o f biodiversity, international waters, and persistent organic pollutants. The 
expected project outcome i s a 2 0 to 30 percent improved s o i l and water quality in the areas 
covered by the project. IFC w i l l be exploring the potential for sustainability finance and 
associated technical assistance programs with selected banks. Programs being considered are 
in energy efficiency finance, biodiversity finance, and cleaner production finance. 

P i l la r 2: Addressing Fiscal Vulnerabilities and Modernizing the Public Sector 

69. 
The Bank w i l l support efforts by the Government to maintain macroeconomic 
stability by focusing on three major fiscal issues. First, the subsidies t o enterprises, though 
declining, remain high and arrears to the state owned enterprises, in particular in energy, 
mining and railways, have t o be contained. Second, the inflow o f substantial post EU 

26 

Romania Coun t ry Partnership Strategy 

accession funds requires appropriate f i s c a l policies and systems to enhance absorption and 
allocate resources to where the needs are. Third, the revenue to GDP ratio w i l l have to 
increase to support the f i s c a l demands o f EU accession. 

70. 
The Bank w i l l sustain public administration and judicial reforms, including 
support to improving transparency and anti-corruption initiatives. Professionalizing the 

c iv i l service and improving efficiency o f the judicial system continue to be important items 
in the EU accession agenda. With respect to i t s anti-corruption e f fo r ts , the Government w i l l 
focus on effective implementation o f the revised Anti-corruption Strategy and Action Plan. 
Bank support in these areas i s anchored in the PAL program and the Fiscal and Governance 
DPL, but other operations w i l l pursue public administration reform and anti-corruption 
initiatives at the sector level, in particular in the judicial, health, and revenue administration 
areas. 

Addressing Fiscal Vulnerabilities and Improving Expenditure Systems 

Programmatic Development Policy Loans (FY07-OS). The PAL program includes 

components that aim to reduce subsidies and enterprise losses by focusing on the 
restructuring o f the mining, energy, and railway sectors in addition to the privatization or 
liquidation o f manufacturing SOEs. 
I n addition, the PAL program has a strong public 
expenditure management component which includes the introduction o f medium term 
budgeting, the modernization and upgrading o f the treasury system, and improvements in the 
system o f audit. The PAL program w i l l contribute to the following outcomes: (a) reduction 
o f enterprise subsidies as percent o f GDP from 2.2 in 2002 to l e s s than 1.5 in 2 0 0 9 ; and (b) 
reduction o f quasi-fiscal energy subsidies as percent o f GDP from 1.7 in 2004 to l e s s than 1 .O 

71. 

in 2009 . 

72. 
Fiscal and Governance DPL (FY09). This operation w i l l build on the PALS and 
provide support towards establishing appropriate f i s c a l policies and efficient expenditure 
management systems. I n particular, the loan has the following objectives: (a) to integrate the 
budget process with the National Development Plan; (b) to improve strategic planning and 
policy development and review; (c) to enhance budget preparation, execution, accounting, 
and audit systems i n line with the Public Expenditure Management Strategic Development 
Plan; and (d) to develop a decentralization framework that clarifies functional assignments 
and relationships between the central government and each t i e r or type o f local 
administration. WB I w i l l complement the objectives (a) and (b) above by sharing global best 
practices in budget programming, Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) design, 
and strategic planning. The specific outcomes from this DPL w i l l be defined after the 
completion o f the Public Finance Studies in FY06 and FY07. 

73. 

Human Development DPL Se r ies - Pension (FY07-09). 

The Government has 
implemented measures towards f i s c a l consolidation o f the public pension system, as a 
prerequisite for the secure implementation o f the fully funded mandatory private pension 
scheme (2nd pillar). However, the system continues to remain vulnerable, for example the 
number o f contributors i s lower than that o f beneficiaries and the system i s subject to ad hoc 
political decisions, which may hamper i t s medium- and long-term financial sustainability. I n 
addition, the public system provides low benefits t o the majority o f its beneficiaries. The 
proposed HD DPL s e r i e s aims to support further consolidation o f the public pension system 
by strengthening the regulatory framework and capacity, to develop conditions for the 
provision o f decent pension benefits, and to help manage the transition to mandatory private 
pensions within an affordable f isca l envelope. The outcome i s the maintenance o f the public 

Romania Country Partnership Strategy 

2 7 

pension deficit at less than 1 percent o f GDP during the CPS period, or the identification o f 
funding sources i f the deficit temporarily widens as a result o f appropriate policies. IFC w i l l 
look for opportunities to participate in the establishment o f private pension funds by 
providing technical assistance and financing. 

74. 

Human Development DPL Series - Health (FY07-09). Building on the past and 
current health operations, the HD DPL series w i l l continue to address quality o f service and 
f isca l sustainability issues in the health sector by rationalizing health services and f a c i l i t i e s , 
as well as supporting improvements in health service financing, access, and provider 
payment methods. I t w i l l also contribute to the Government Anti-corruption program by 
reducing the incidence o f informal payments. Progress on these fronts i s considered essential 
to the creation o f a sustainable health system. The DPL ser ies intends to ass is t Romania in 
addressing the key problems that are contributing to the health-related f i s c a l deficit and avoid 
the problems that are currently preventing a number o f the New Member S ta tes from meeting 
the Maastricht criteria. The loan can also be structured to fac i l i ta te the utilization o f EU 
structural funds in the health sector. The DPL series w i l l contribute to the following 
outcomes: (a) reduction in amount o f arrears by health care providers by more than 50 
percent between 2005 and 2009 ; and (b) reduction in the incidence o f informal payments as 
percent o f health sector expenditures from 10 percent in 2005 to 5 percent in 2008. IFC w i l l 
seek to help stimulate the growth o f the private healthcare sector in Romania, as well as 
support the delivery o f higher quality and better reach o f services by offering advisory 
services and introducing private sector participation. 

Improving Revenue Collection and Administration 

75. 

Revenue Administration Reform Loan (FY06). The CPS w i l l support Romania’s 
medium-term goal o f enhancing revenue collection through a Revenue Administration 
Reform Loan. A sizable informal sector, a history o f arrears accumulation, and a large and 
essentially untaxed agricultural sector have contributed to Romania’s low revenue-to-GDP 
ratio compared to both old and new EU member states. The development objective o f the 
proposed project w i l l be to implement a sustainable revenue collection system for Romania 
that w i l l : (a) deepen revenue collection to ensure a sustainable level o f public expenditure; 
(b) improve governance; and (c) reduce potential for corruption. The project w i l l enhance 
the business climate by improving client services and reducing burden o f taxpayer 
compliance. The project w i l l contribute to the outcome o f increased tax compliance rates by 
four percentage points between 2 0 0 5 - 0 9 . 

Improving Absorption of EU Funds 

76. Municipal Services Loan (FY06). This operation w i l l help Romania comply with 
the EU’s environmental directives by completing necessary investments in the water and 
wastewater sector in two urban areas - Bucharest and Arad. These investments have been 
identified as environmental priorities in the country, and the Bank‘s intervention w i l l help to 
improve and increase the coverage o f water supply, reduce groundwater contamination 
through the construction o f sewerage networks, and reduce transboundary pollution through 
the construction o f sewerage and stormwater networks. I n addition, this activity o f the Bank 
w i l l help Romania prepare projects which w i l l be eligible to receive EU Cohesion and 
Structural grants. The lack o f a project pipeline has been a key bottleneck to absorb EU grant 
funds and this activity o f the Bank w i l l address this issue . The loan aims to achieve an 

28 

Roman ia Coun try Pa r tne rsh ip Strategy 

outcome o f more than 75 percent absorption o f EU funds by end-2009 fo r the water and 
wastewater sector in the counties targeted by the project. 

Mode rn iz ing Public Administration 

77. 
The P A L series (FY07-08) and the Fiscal and Governance D P L (FY09) support 
civil service reform. The aim i s to establish a more meritocratic, professional, and 
depoliticized c iv i l service funded with a sustainable public sector wage b i l l and transparent 
salary settings. I n addition, the DPLs w i l l support implementation o f Government’s Anti- 
corruption Strategy and Action Plan, including a review o f i t s effectiveness. The existing 
Private and Public Sector Institution Building Loan (PPIBL) continues to provide technical 
assistance in designing and implementing these reforms. The PAL program has se t up a set 
o f indicators to monitor progress towards the following outcomes: more meritocratic c iv i l 
service management, increased quality o f c iv i l servants, enhanced attractiveness o f c iv i l 
service career, and c i v i l service wage b i l l affordability. Specific outcomes include: (a) 
incidence o f formal evaluations for civil servants exceeding 95 percent each year during the 
CPS period; and (b) increase in the percentage o f c iv i l servants with university degrees to 77 
percent for central administration and 50 percent for local administration by end-2009. 

78. 
Judicial Reform Loan (FY06). 
The Judicial Reform Loan ass is ts 
in the 
implementation o f the strategy articulated in the PAL program and focuses on improving the 
organization o f the court system and upgrading transparency and budgeting. Both the PAL 
and the Judicial Reform Loan provide support to implementing the commitments under the 
acquis, including addressing the weaknesses in the judicial area contained i n the EU 
monitoring report. Both the PAL program and the Judicial Reform Loan contribute to the 
outcome o f 30 percent reduction o f time spent by courts on administrative matters by 2009. 

P i l la r 3: Targeting Poverty Reduction and Promoting Social Inclusion 

79. 
The Bank’s targeted poverty reduction initiatives focus on addressing living 
standard disparities and empowering disadvantaged groups. Growth remains the 
cornerstone of Bank e f fo r ts to reduce poverty, but at the same time the CPS addresses the 
major disparities in rural and regional development as well as the constraints faced by certain 
groups in reaping the benefits o f economic growth. I n particular, the CPS w i l l a s s i s t the 
Government in addressing rural poverty through a more comprehensive approach, reducing 
regional disparity by enabling the Government to utilize the tools and funds available i n the 
EU for this purpose, and supporting certain disadvantaged groups - i n particular the Roma, 
children and youth in state institutions, the disabled, and the victims o f domestic violence - 
towards both economic and social inclusion. 

80. 
Human Development DPL Se r ies (FYO7-09). The DPL series w i l l include 
measures to improve health outcomes o f disadvantaged groups, such as by restructuring 
health care services in underserved areas. 
I t w i l l also focus on reforms to eliminate the 
practice o f informal payments for health services thereby reducing the number o f poor people 
who forgo medical treatment fo r financial reasons. The DPL se r ies w i l l also include 
measures to increase coverage o f the Minimum Income Guarantee scheme. The DPL s e r i e s 
w i l l contribute to the following outcomes: (a) halving o f extreme poverty rate between 2003 
and 2009; and (b) reduction by 10 percent o f the number of people who forgo medical care 
for financial reasons between 2004 and 2009.

R u r a l and Regional Development Loan (FY08). To address the high disparities 

81 . 
between urban and rural areas as well as among and within regions, the Bank w i l l support 
systemic solutions through the Rural and Regional Development Loan . The Rural and 
Regional Development Loan w i l l support a systemic approach to decentralization and 
capacity-building o f decentralized government institutions to strengthen their planning and 
programming capacity. The loan w i l l also help improve institutional capacity to absorb and 
coordinate development and investment programs across EU Structural (regional and rural) 
and Cohesion funds, and to support stakeholder initiatives (Leader programs). The Loan w i l l 
build on the positive capacity-building results o f the Rural Development Loan and w i l l be the 
primary instrument for strengthening county level capacity for absorbing EU funds. This 
loan w i l l support the outcome o f increased availability and condition o f infrastructure in rural 
and economically depressed areas (the quantification o f the outcome targets w i l l be 
determined during loan preparation). 

82. 

Social Inclusion Loan (FY06 ) . This loan w i l l support improvements in the living 
conditions and the soc ia l inclusion o f the most disadvantaged and vulnerable people in the 
Romanian society by: (a) improving the living conditions and social inclusion o f Roma living 
in poor settlements; (b) increasing the inclusiveness o f Early Childhood Education services in 
targeted areas; and (c) improving the quality o f services for Persons with Disability (PWD), 
youth in state institutions, and victims o f domestic violence. The loan aims to upgrade 
capacities in line ministries to design and implement soc ia l inclusion programs, ass is t local 
authorities in implementing social programs, and strengthen capacity o f community groups. 
The Social Inclusion Loan w i l l help implement commitments under the social inclusion 
chapter o f the acqu is and the recently signed Joint Inclusion Memorandum with the EU. The 
loan w i l l contribute to the following outcomes to be achieved during the CPS period: (a) 20 
percent reduction o f gaps between selected depressed areas and neighboring communities as 
measured by living conditions index; (b) 70 percent o f Roma i n targeted settlements 
acknowledging an improvement in basic living conditions; (c) 5 percentage point increase in 
children from targeted communities participating in Early Childhood Education program; (d) 
25 percent o f services for PWD scoring at least 80 percent on the standards compliance index 
for each category o f quality standards; and (e) 40 percent increase i n the ra te o f employment 
o f youth 18+ benefiting from multi-functional centers. 

Av ian F l u Loan (FY07 ) . 

83 . 
Romania has requested assistance under the Global 
Program for Avian Influenza and Human Pandemic Preparedness and Response (GPAI). 
GPAI assistance to Romania i s being prepared under the technical lead o f F A 0 and WHO. 
Romania was the first European country to confirm an outbreak o f the Highly Pathogenic 
Avian Influenza with the H5N1 virus being first discovered in the Danube De l ta i n October 
2005. Two factors expose Romania to a particular risk for HPA I outbreaks. First, the 
Romanian Danube Delta i s a central resting place for migratory birds on their routes from the 
Eurasian to the African continents. Second, backyard operations with low bio-safety 
standards and c lose multi-species interactions are the dominant form o f poultry holding in the 
county. To improve Romania's response and preparedness capacities fo r a potential increase 
in the number o f outbreaks, the Avian Flu Loan w i l l support investments which enhance the 
authorities' ability to more proactively address fac tors contributing to further spread o f the 
disease among poultry and further reduce the risk o f human infections. Outcomes w i l l be 
determined during loan preparation.

Bank Instruments 

84. 
B an k lending w i l l use a mix o f instruments w i th strategic use o f DPLs and 
ut i l izat ion o f programmat ic approaches. The programs in FY06-08 w i l l be anchored to 
the PALS which focus on core public sector and first generation structural reforms as well as 
underpin the sectoral reforms supported by other lending operations. I n FY09, the Fiscal and 
Governance DPL w i l l provide the anchor for the Bank program. The HD DPL series planned 
to support education, health and pension reforms w i l l focus on policy and structural issues as 
recommended in the CLER and build on and complement existing investment operations in 
these sectors towards a comprehensive program o f reform. Annex B3a contains the lending 
program under two scenarios. 

8 5 . 

The AAA program w i l l be frontloaded and w i l l provide impo r tan t inputs to the 
design o f lending operations. The Public Finance Studies are critical inputs to the lending 
operations, and to the design o f the second phase o f the CPS. Policy notes on regional 
development, private sector development and municipal finance feed into planned operations 
in these areas. A n Agriculture Note has been completed. 
Instead o f a major report on 
poverty every three years, an annual Poverty Monitoring Note i s planned. Monitoring o f the 
macroeconomic environment and related issues continue to be important, more so in the 
absence o f a Fund arrangement. The A A A program w i l l emphasize short policy notes to 
improve responsiveness and w i l l emphasize dissemination and consensus building. This 
requires a certain amount o f flexibility in defining the composition and delivery o f the policy 
notes. I n addition, there are ongoing discussions on the possibility o f non-lending T A to be 
provided by the Bank in the areas o f public debt management and l o c a l currency bond 
issuance. Annex B4 con ta ins the A A A program. 

86. 
The Government i s also considering support in the fo rm o f pa r t ia l risk 
guarantees in the energy sector. There are tw o concrete possibilities: (a) support to the 
Turceni project which i s part o f power generation privatization i n the PA L program; and (b) 
support to the Tarnita Hydroelectric Project in conjunction w i th an Energy Loan, which 
would help to extend the commercial financing terms for Hidroelectrica. I n addition, other 
partial credit guarantee possibilities could be explored in the transport sector and for 
financing requirements o f Transelectrica or Transgaz. U s e f u l n e s s o f PRG instruments for 
strengthening the municipal finance system i s also being evaluated. 

87. 

The Bank offers a fu l l a r ray o f financing and risk management products 
associated w i th capacity-building support. These instruments provide the flexibility to 
change the f inanc ia l characteristics o f the loans throughout their l i f e , and offer Romania the 
option to manage financial risks related to currency, interest rate and commodity price 
volatility. Bank loans, guarantees and risk management products can be applied both at the 
country portfolio level and project level. A t the country level, the financial products can be 
used to support Romania’s debt and risk management strategy through: (a) structured Bank 
lending terms, as needed; and (b) intermediation o f long-dated derivatives transactions to 
enable the government to better manage financial risks, mainly interest rate, currency and 
refinancing risks. For new projects, the Bank can assist the Government by providing the 
techn ica l expertise to prepare, f inance and execute programs earmarked to receive EU grant 
funds, such as infrastructure projects, community based programs, and improvement to 
governments systems per EU directives.. A t the same time, the Government can use the 
flexibility i n repayment terms o f Bank loans to provide bridge financing for the portions that 
w i l l be reimbursed by E U grants and long-term financing fo r the portions to be financed by 
the Government.

88 . 
IFC expects to continue its involvement in supporting Romania with its EU 
accession and integration. When feasible, IFC w i l l complement the Bank's work especially 
in energy. 
IFC's main goal i s to support private sector development, helping local 
companies to benefit from opportunities and meet challenges during the EU accession and 
integration period. 
IFC w i l l further increase its volume and scope o f investment and 
advisory services, especially through support o f large national-level privatizations in 
infrastructure, where IFC support and private sector involvement w i l l help increase reliability 
and affordability o f services for consumers. Areas o f priority include: 

0 

In collaboration with the Bank, IFC w i l l continue to support new investors i n the 
power sector (generation and distribution) and other network utilities (water, gas, 
district heating), where emerging regulatory frameworks are not yet well-tested and 
constitute an element o f uncertainty and "political risk" which may otherwise 
constrain investor interest. 
IFC i s actively promoting public-private partnerships 
(PPPs) through private investment in a l l infrastructure sectors with advisory services 
to be provided by the Private Enterprise Partnership Southeast Europe Infrastructure 
(PEP-SE Infrastructure) program. 
IFC w i l l also continue to ensure that, 
i n 
accordance with Romanian law, the privatization transactions in which i t i s 
participating, either i n an investment or advisory capacity, are done on the basis o f a 
satisfactory environmental assessment. 

0 Although gradually improving, the 
financial sector 
i n Romania remains 
underdeveloped and cannot yet provide effective intermediation between savers and 
investors. IFC w i l l continue working w i th local banks on introducing new products 
and services such as local currency-linked products, structured finance, securitization, 
housing finance, energy efficiency lending as well as developing non-bank f inanc ia l 
institutions in leasing, pension, and insurance. IFC w i l l also provide credit l i n e s for 
on-lending to micro and SME sector - the driving force o f the Romanian economy. 

0 

In agribusiness, IFC w i l l support investments that utilize local inputs efficiently to 
enhance industry competitiveness. The agribusiness sector i s steadily evolving from 
post-privatization restructuring w i th government support and incentives, to attracting 
FDI, especially in dairy and meat processing. Opportunities for IFC investments 
include assisting in the development o f an efficient poultry and pork farmers 
networks, financing joint-venture partnerships with leading enterprises from nearby 
countries (i.e. Turkey), and improving environmental and social standards i n the 
industry. 

0 

IFC w i l l continue to support commercially productive enterprises in Romania 
with strong foreign exchange earnings and employment opportunities, and help w i th 
cross-border investments. 
IFC w i l l selectively invest in general manufacturing 
projects and support regional private equity funds which (a) provide scarce equity 
financing 
fo r the development o f commercial and industrial companies; (b) offer 
managerial and strategic support to improve enterprise competitiveness; and (c) help 
position companies as attractive acquisition targets. 

0 With the traditional telecom sector reaching maturity, IFC w i l l consider 
investment opportunities in new communication technologies (e.g. VOIP and 

3 2

Broadband), media (cable T V 
(e-Government). 

in particular), and 

information 

technologies 

89. M I G A w i l l be open to opportunities to support the CPS and help improve 
investors’ confidence through the provision o f political risk guarantees. In particular, 
M I G A can play a role, in c l o s e coordination with the Bank, in support o f the privatization in 
the energy sec tor by providing guarantees. I n addition, as M IGA can provide political risk 
insurance on a sub-sovereign level, M IGA can help promote private sector investment in the 
water and wastewater sectors. Also, M IGA w i l l be available to support investments in the 
general manufacturing and agribusiness sectors. M IGA w i l l coordinate i t s involvement with 
the World Bank and, particularly in the infrastructure sector, with IFC. 

90. 
The Wo r ld Bank Institute (WBI) will include Romania as one of its focus 
countries in FY07 . Although Romanians have benefited from WB I programs i n the past, 
W B I w i l l now move away from spontaneous events to targeted multi-year knowledge sharing 
programs and skills building activities that w i l l complement the outcomes o f the CPS. The 
W B I program w i l l target: (a) support to SMEs to improve their business sustainability and 
competitiveness; (b) capacity building utilizing international best practices in f i s c a l 
management and reforms; and (c) public private partnerships in highways. As i n a l l focus 
countries, WB I w i l l customize the global knowledge and expertise i t brings to Romania 
through partnerships with local institutions and agencies, and close collaboration w i th 
operational colleagues. The overall FY07-09 program w i l l be designed using the following 
principles: (a) selectivity to ensure that resource envelopes support customization; (b) results 
focus through closer WBI/IFC/operational collaboration; (c) sustainability through the 
establishment o f local and international delivery and content partners; and (d) relevance by 
sharing EU-centric knowledge and expertise w i th Romania. 

F. 

Partnerships 

91. 
The EU plays a central ro l e in defining Romania’s development agenda. The 
Bank enjoys a close relationship w i th the E U - this relationship has not only ensured a good 
fit between EU and Bank activities, but has also facilitated the Government’s interface w i th 
the two institutions. For example, a jo in t Bank/EU Country Procurement Assessment 
Review was carried out in February 2005 which made recommendations regarding the 
implementation o f the new E U procurement directives in the context o f national public 
procurement legislation. As part o f the CPS preparation process, Bank and EC 
representatives held a “Romania day” meeting in July 2005 to explore ways to deepen 
operational collaboration. 

92. 
The Bank w i l l maintain coordination with the Fund, which i s expected to 
continue to monitor the macroeconomic framework even without a Fund arrangement. 
The PAL program was developed in close cooperation with the Fund while relevant lending 
operations - such as the Revenue Administration Reform Loan - continue to be coordinated 
w i th Fund s ta f f . Without a Fund arrangement, the Bank w i l l have to take a bigger ro le on 
macroeconomic issues , 
in particular by making periodic assessments o f Romania’s 
macroeconomic framework and performance. 

93, 
Developing operational synergies with other development partners, in particular 
with the EC, EIB, and EBRD, i s a critical element o f the CPS implementation strategy. 
The need to leverage the techn ica l and financial resources o f the development partners i s 
warranted by Romania’s relatively large requirements across sectors, including the demands 

Romania Coun try Partnership Strategy 

3 3 

arising from EU membership obligations. Accordingly, the Bank intends to design programs 
and projects that integrate the comparative advantage o f the development partners and ensure 
an optimal investment impact for Romania. I n this framework, the Bank w i l l continue to 
offer i t s international expertise and design systemic approaches which w i l l enable other 
partners to participate in financing and cost sharing. The experience derived from ongoing 
joint projects in Romania, such as the Health Sector Reform APL 2 co-financed together with 
EIB, or i n the New Member States, such as Poland or the Baltic states, w i l l form the 
foundation o f this approach. 

94. 
I n building partnerships, the Country Office (CO) w i l l continue its proactive 
wo rk in outreach and communication. The CO plays a lead r o l e in the dialogue with the 
Government on key policy aspects and in resolving day-to-day implementation issues. I t 
functions on a highly decentralized basis, with a large number o f supervision and project 
preparation tasks delegated to the loca l s t a f f across the sectors. Currently ten projects are 
being supervised and three are being prepared by TTLs in the CO. The Government highly 
appreciates the just-in-time service which was further improved with the relocation and 
strengthening o f the procurement and financial management functions and disbursement 
services in the CO. 

G. 

Lending Scenarios 

9 5 , 
For FY06-09, a flexible lending program o f between $450 to $550 million per 
year i s proposed to support the strategic objectives o f the CPS. The base case lending 
(Annex B3a) would be investment projects most o f which are subject to pre-conditions o f 
appropriate policy and acceptable medium term expenditure framework as described in Table 
7. High case lending (Annex B3a) would be a combination o f investment and development 
policy lending where the latter would require maintenance o f an appropriate macroeconomic 
framework as per OP 8.60 and the indicators in Table 7. A periodic assessment o f the 
macroeconomic framework and performance would be done by the Bank in consultation with 
the Fund and the EU. Should the macroeconomic assessment indicate that the environment 
i s such that investment lending would not achieve i t s objectives, there would be a low case 
scenario o f A A A and global goods type o f lending such as the Avian F lu operation. Bank 
exposure i s manageable and even at maximum lending, the Bank’s exposure w i l l remain 
below the guideline thresholds, and some indicators w i l l continue to decline. 

96 . 
Country financing parameters have been prepared and agreed with the 
Government. Bank financed projects are fully integrated into the budget and are well 
aligned with the Government’s priorities and development program. The Bank’s lending 
program represents a small share o f the Government’s overall spending with the EU 
providing the bulk o f external sources o f funds post accession. Whatever the sources o f 
funds, public expenditures are subject to the same overall government f i s c a l rules and 
policies. I n light o f these factors, and provided that lending stays within the overall CPS 
envelope, the Bank could finance up to 100 percent o f costs o f individual operations. 
Annex D summarizes the Country Financing Parameters for Romania.

Results Based Monitoring and Evaluation 

97 . 
The CPS results monitoring and evaluation will be done by the existing P A L 
structures that manage and coordinate multi-sectoral programs, together with the 
Department for Program Implementation and Structural Adjustment, part of the 
Chancellery o f the Cabinet. The PAL program monitoring and evaluation i s done by a 
PAL Implementation Unit (PIU) established in the Chancellery o f the Prime Minister’s 
Office and a Public Policy Unit established as permanent body in the office o f the General 
Secretary o f Government. The P IU w i l l expand its work to the CPS in monitoring and 
evaluating a set o f performance indicators, producing quarterly reports on progress in 
implementation and outcomes, and highlighting areas 
that necessitate Government 
intervention. The Department for Program Implementation and Structural Adjustment 
monitors the implementation o f the programs financed from external sources, including from 
EU pre-accession funds. The statistical capacity at the ministry l e v e l established under the 
PAL program w i l l be strengthened and expanded to other offices. I n addition, the lending 
operations w i l l include components to ensure capacity for program and results monitoring 
and evaluation at the ministry level. There w i l l be bi-annual meetings o f a CPS monitoring 
committee composed o f Government and Bank representatives t o review the CPS progress, 
including the updating the results matrix to reflect new information and developments. The 
results matrix w i l l be updated and extended as part o f the CPS Progress Report. 

I V . Risk Management and Creditworthiness 

9 8 . 
Sustained progress in implementing the reform program w i l l be affected by both 
political risk and weaknesses in institutional capacity. A delay in EU membership could 
result in political turmoil that could adversely impact the implementation o f the reform 
program. I n addition, strengthening institutional capacity would have to be an important part 
of the government agenda to ensure effective absorption o f EU funds. Nonetheless, the EU 
accession process has been the strongest incentive fo r structural and institutional reforms and 
achieving membership remains the main priority fo r a l l parliamentary parties. This would 
focus Government efforts on c r i t ica l reforms, especially those identified in the EC Progress 
Reports as lagging in terms o f implementation. The EC closely monitors progress on 
reforms, and w i l l continue to do so after accession. 
I n addition, the periodic Bank 
assessment o f the macroeconomic environment and review o f compliance with policy 
performance benchmarks to govern the l e v e l o f Bank lending provide a mechanism for 
dealing with risks to the Bank program. 

99 . 
Failure to promptly address emerging weaknesses 
in the macroeconomic 
framework could affect adversely the absorption o f EU funds and structural reforms. 
As discussed in Section I.B, macroeconomic imbalances have widened and the Bank shares 
the concern - articulated by the Fund during the Article I V Board - about the size o f the 
budget deficit and its impact on the current account and the disinflation process. 
Nonetheless, 
the Government 
recognizes 
that sustaining strong growth requires 
macroeconomic stabilization and further economic adjustment. After accession, the EU 
Growth and Stability Pact (SGP) and other EU mechanisms and instruments applicable to a l l 
member states, as well expectations o f future EMU (Euro-zone) membership which requires 
meeting the Maastricht economic convergence criteria, provide a 
framework for 
policymaking. Nonetheless, the Maastricht and SGP conditions may not be as detailed and 
finely tuned to individual country circumstances as Fund arrangement conditionalities and 
advice. 

36 

Romania Country Partnership Strategy 

100. The Romanian banking sector seems well-positioned to absorb adverse shocks, 
but attention needs to be paid to medium-term vulnerabilities. Romania made 
substantial progress in consolidating i t s financial sector since 1999, when bank restructuring 
took hold. With the recent privatization o f BCR, the share o f private ownership in the system 
exceeds 90 percent. The sector i s dominated by the branches o f important European banks, 
which account for over 70 percent o f total assets in the system. The Financial Sector 
Assessment Program (FSAP) which evaluated the banking sector in 2003 concluded that the 
Romanian banks were well capitalized, rates o f return on equity and capital-adequacy ratios 
were high, and the s ize o f non-performing loans - at l e s s than 3 percent o f total loans - was 
manageable. Nonetheless, the risks o f a strong credit expansion would have to be managed. 
Bank vulnerability indicators require close and constant scrutiny, especially given the large 
and growing exposure o f some European banks to the fast-expanding Eastern European 
market. 

101. Creditworthiness of the country has improved significantly in the last few years. 
Driven by the modernization requirements o f EU accession, total external debt outstanding 
and disbursed i s projected to increase from around U S $ 3 3 billion in 2005 to around U S $ 5 2 
billion at the end o f 2009. However, as economic growth w i l l likely continue to remain 
robust, the ratio o f total external debt to GDP i s expected to only slowly increase from 
around 33 .5 percent currently. During this period, total debt service i s likely to grow 
moderately to around US$6 .5 -7 billion per year in 2009. FD I inflows, remittances from 
Romanians working abroad (estimated at a steady flow o f over Euro 3 .5 billion per year) and 
moderate public borrowing should easily cover debt servicing during 2005-09. 

102. 

I n the absence o f substantial adverse shocks to the economy, no servicing 
problems are envisaged fo r the country's foreign debt obligations. Official reserves have 
reached record highs, driven by the need o f the central bank to sterilize large capital inflows 
to prevent a massive domestic currency appreciation. Short term debt, although fast growing 
in 2005, i s s t i l l below 6 percent o f GDP," limiting the country's vulnerability to unexpected 
reverses in capital flows. As domestic interest rates have been on a steep downward trend in 
2005, the Government's intention i s to resort to larger extent than in the past to domestic 
savings to finance the f i s c a l deficit, which, ceteris paribus, should reduce the need to seek 
external capital. 

103. The share of the public and publicly guaranteed debt in total external debt (now 
around 4 4 percent) i s expected to continue to decline, despite the large financing 
requirements to meet EU accession standards. Because o f the major role the IFIs played 
as lenders o f last reso r t in Romania's external financing in the late nineties and the country's 
constrained access to capital markets at the time, preferred creditors still account for a 
relatively high percentage o f the public and publicly guaranteed debt service. This share 
fluctuates around 20-25 percent, with a peak o f 34.6 percent in 2004. However, the ability o f 
Romania and Romanian companies to raise public and private debt on the international 
markets at a reasonable cost has improved remarkably in the l a s t few years, as reflected by 
the more than halving o f the yields o f the Romanian debt since 2001, now traded only 
slightly above the EU benchmarks. A rapid increase i n private debt i s projected, concomitant 
with a decline in the share o f public and publicly guaranteed debt, which should come below 
40 percent o f total debt outstanding by 2009.

Notes: DS = debt service; XGS = exports o f goods and services; TDO = total debt outstanding. 

104. The Bank’s exposure to Romania w i l l continue to remain manageable, with no 
major downside risks foreseeable in the medium term. The Bank remains a large creditor 
to Romania, accounting for about 7.6 percent o f the to ta l debt outstanding and 10.6 percent 
o f the public and publicly guaranteed debt service at the end o f 2005 . The EU integration 
process, through the commitments assumed under the acquis as well as the obligations 
deriving from membership post accession such as those coming under the Growth and 
Stability Pact, i s expected to provide an anchor for continued macroeconomic consolidation. 
Consequently, even if the Bank continues to remain engaged on a significant sca le in the 
reform process in Romania, i t s re la t ive exposure, as defined by the standard benchmarks, w i l l 
remain below the guideline thresholds and some w i l l continue to decline (see Table 8). Debt 
service to IBRD i s projected to decline to around 0.7 percent o f GNFS exports by 2009 , from 
around 0.8 percent currently. The share o f IBRD debt i n total public and publicly guaranteed 
debt w i l l decline to 13.6 percent by 2009 (5.3 percent o f total debt outstanding), as other 
large preferred creditors, especially European banks, w i l l play a more active role in financing 
Romania’s EU integration.

CAS COMPLETION REPORT 

Country: Romania

A. 

LONGER TERM STRATEGIC GOALS 

1 . 
The Comprehensive Development Framework (CDF) initiative in 1999 w i th 
extensive consultations held through 2000 revealed a consensus in Romania around 
two strategic goals: (a) poverty reduction and (b) EU accession. A t the same time, the 
fo l low ing development priorities and constraints were highlighted: (a) ineffectiveness 
o f public institutions in particular the legal system; (b) integration w i th Western 
Europe; (c) lack o f access to economic and social opportunities; (d) poverty in the 
midst o f substantial natural endowment; and (e) a poorly functioning market 
economy. 

2. 
The CDF process helped shape the agenda o f a new government which was 
sworn into o f f ice in December 2000 and which obtained Parliamentary approval o f its 
“Governing Program 2001 -2004.” The major objectives o f the program were: (a) 
restoration o f economic growth; (b) reduction o f poverty and unemployment; (c) 
fighting corruption; and (d) acceleration o f integration i n the EU and N A TO . The 
main program pillars were: (a) ensuring macroeconomic stability; (b) improving the 
quality o f government services, including the regulatory functions and the judiciary; 
and (c) creating a business environment which attracts foreign and domestic investors 
in both emerging SMEs and privatized enterprises. 

3 . 
The areas o f focus o f the FY02 -04 CAS were strongly aligned w i th the 
Government’s strategic goals o f poverty reduction and growth. The CAS, which was 
endorsed by 
the Government, had three ma in themes: (a) 
targeted poverty 
interventions aimed at improving delivery o f key social services and revitalizing the 
rural economy; (b) accelerating growth through private sector development; and (c) 
strengthening public sector institutional capacity, including governance reform. Table 
1 below illustrates the responsiveness o f the CAS to the CDF Strategic Goals and 
Government Program.

4. 
While the CAS d id not target exp l ic i t ly EU accession and integration as 
specific goals, the program nonetheless supported Romania‘s E U aspirations. The 
CAS did not have strong and systematic linkages w i th the E U accession agenda and 
priorities. I n part, this was due to the l a c k o f a we l l defined E U framework f rom the 
government at that time. There was neither an analysis o f E U accession priorities nor 
a review o f Bank-EU complementarities as inputs to the preparation o f the CAS. 
Consequently. the design o f projects generally d id not incorporate EU accession as a 
major criterion although some projects, especially during the latter part o f the CAS, 
indicated complementarity w i th or support to the E U agenda. Nonetheless, the lack o f 
systematic EU links in the CAS d id not diminish the importance o f the themes 
chosen, which mainly reflected Romania’s development needs and the Bank’s 
corporate priorities. The CAS focused more on fundamental poverty, social and 
economic growth issues wh ich are important to the process o f EU integration. 

5 . 
I n the course o f the CAS implementation, the E U accession agenda began to 
dominate Government priorities and actions. 
I n response to this development, 
towards the latter part o f the CAS period, the Bank strengthened synergy w i t h the EU 
in the areas o f special interest to the E U - such as public administration and jud ic ia l 
reforms - mainly through the preparation o f the P A L program. There were intensive 
and extensive consultations between the Bank and the EU on the P A L program, 
ensuring maximum complementarity as we l l as consistency. Thus, the cooperation 
and coordination between the EU and the Bank evolved into a more systematic one 
towards the end o f the CAS period, and subsequently the operations i n FY05 were 
deliberately chosen and designed w i th E U accession and integration as a major 
considerat ion. 

Annex C 
Page 3 o f 26 

6 . 
The regular progress reports issued by the E U on the status o f progress o f 
Romania towards accession increasingly became important signals and determinants 
o f government priorities. These reports became important inputs to the design o f 
Bank operations, such as the governance reforms in the P A L program and the Judicial 
Reform Project which was approved by the Board in December 2005. The current 
Government indicated that the immediate priority i s achieving EU accession by 2007, 
which places importance on ensuring that the issues in the E U progress reports are 
being adequately and expeditiously addressed. 
The current Government has 
requested support from the Bank to enable the achievement o f the E U accession goal. 

7. 
The Fund and the Bank worked we l l together i n setting the preconditions for 
macroeconomic stability. After f ive failed programs, Romania completed an SBA in 
2003 and the Fund approved a new precautionary SBA in July 2004 which would help 
ensure that the macroeconomic environment remains stable. PSAL-2 complemented 
the Fund arrangements by continuing the process o f enterprise and banking reforms, 
which were critical 
to 
the 
imposition o f financial discipline and ensuring 
macroeconomic stability. Moreover, PSAL-2 also focused on energy reforms, which 
sought to reduce arrears that subsidized s ta te owned enterprises. The PSAL-2 reforms 
continued w i th the preparation o f the First Programmatic Adjustment Loan (PA L - I ) , 
which was approved in September 2004. The Fund and the Bank programs were 
closely coordinated throughout the CAS period. 

8 . 

The SBA that was negotiated during the CAS period contains several 
benchmarks that were also core reforms in the P A L program. While i n some 
countries, such an SBA design had been a source o f tension w i th respect to Bank- 
Fund relations, in Romania the overlapping conditionalities improved synergies and 
coordination between the two institutions. More important, the SBA design signalled 
a common front between the Fund and the Bank and impressed on the authorities the 
importance o f the reforms, as we l l as strengthened the 
l i n k between the 
macroeconomic stability objective o f the SBA w i th the structural and institutional 
reforms supported by the Bank. The Fund relied on the Bank for the provision o f 
expertise on the structural and institutional reforms rather than u t i l iz ing Fund staff or 
consultants, and i n the process helped ensure a consistent approach to issues. Table 2 
shows the overlapping conditionalities between the Bank and Fund programs.

Romania made substantial progress towards achieving the longer term goals 
se t through the CDF process and the medium term objectives set by the new 
Government. Two o f the notable achievements related to the EU accession goal were 
the conclusion o f negotiations with the EU in December 2004 and the signing o f the 
Accession Treaty in Ap r i l 2005. Entry to the EU i s expected to take place on January 
1, 2007. In addition, during the past four years, the economy grew robustly at 4.5-5.0 
percent per year, with inflation declining from 40 percent in 2000 to 9 . 3 percent in 
2004. Poverty has been declining, although the rate remains high relative to EU-8 
countries. Structural reforms accelerated during the CAS period, mainly during the 
latter part. Figures 1-6 track the performance o f Romania in several key areas. 

10. 
However, progress in institution building and governance reform, including in 
the area o f anti-corruption, has been slow. Political commitment to governance 
reforms was weak during most o f the CAS period. In addition, capacity to design and 
implement comprehensive institution building programs was limited. Both the Bank 
and the EU had been pushing for both public administration and judicial reforms, but 
the Government began moving on these reforms only towards the end o f the CAS 
period when the pressure o f completing the acqu is communau ta i re increased and risk 
o f delayed EU entry became more real. In particular, the negative evaluation in the 
EU progress reports moved the Government into action. Despite the completion o f 
negotiations, entry to the EU was conditioned on the fulfillment o f eleven actions, o f 
which seven were related to governance reforms. Nonetheless, there was progress in 
institution building in selected sectors or ministries supported by Bank projects, 
including in the education, health, and energy sectors. 

1 1 , 
I n retrospect, linking the institution building theme o f the CAS w i th the EU 
accession process should have been done earlier and more systematically. 
In 
particular, the issue o f capacity to absorb EU funds could have been addressed by the 
CAS and incorporated more deliberately into the design o f the operations although 
two rural operations dealt with absorption o f EU funds. 
I n addition, the Public 
Expenditure Review could have looked into both f i s c a l policy and institutional 
implications o f the investment requirements o f EU accession and the absorption o f 
EU funds. Using the EU accession lens would have focused the attention o f the 
Government on institution building and provided a framework for developing 
priorities. The current Government has solicited Bank support towards improving 
capacity to absorb EU funds, but with the accession date looming, initiatives to both 
upgrade capacity as well as design appropriate policies may not achieve their impact 
in a timely manner. 

12. 
Despite major achievements o f late, Romania continues to lag the EU-8 in 
many areas and the reform agenda remains formidable. Romania has the lowest GDP 
per capita at PPP and lags in several social indicators. 
Improvements in 
competitiveness are limited to a few activities while large parts o f the economy are 
un-restructured. A large number o f enterprises continue to be in state hands, which i s 
a major constraint to improving productivity in the economy. Subsidization o f the 
enterprise sector through arrears accumulation has not been eliminated. Financial 
intermediation i s low, although state presence in the banking system has dramatically 
declined due to an aggressive privatization program. Agricultural productivity i s low 
and only slowly improving, while employment in subsistence agriculture remains 

large. Labor market flexibility w i l l have to be increased and administrative barriers 
faced by businesses further reduced to improve the business climate. Table 3 puts 
Romania's performance in a regional perspective.

The CAS was unable to deal effectively w i th the deteriorating agriculture and 
rural development policy environment. The agriculture sector in Romania includes 45 
percent o f the population l iv ing in the rural area, and 67 percent o f the poor. A poor 
policy framework and the slow pace o f restructuring have resulted in low productivity 
in the sector. Nonetheless, Romania's moderate climate and availability o f land point 
towards potential competitiveness o f the sector, which could be unleashed with the 
appropriate policies and strong institutions. A review would have to be undertaken to 
determine whether the mix o f Bank interventions would need to be modified to 
achieve the desired results o f a more competitive agriculture sector and improved 
l iv ing standards in the rural areas. 

14. 
The A A A should have been frontloaded and could have been strengthened by 
including work on relevant and important areas. The CAS would have benefited from 
an earlier completion o f the Country Economic Memorandum and the Poverty 
Assessment. As mentioned earlier, the Public Expenditure Review should have 
included sections on policy impact o f EU accession and institutional strengthening to 
absorb EU funds. Analytical work in both agriculture and rural sectors would have 
led to development o f a strategic framework for the choice and design o f projects. I n 
some important areas, there may have been too much reliance on work by other 
donors, as in the case o f decentralization where staff had to contend with issues o f 
coordination, quality, and timeliness. There has been no substantive work on business 
environment and private sector development (w i th the exception o f the financial 
sector), despite the importance placed by the CAS on private sector led growth. 
While the CEM provided the analytical work in many o f the abovementioned topics, 
i t came too late to be o f use in the implementation or modification o f the CAS 

Annex C

program. The CEM i s currently being utilized as a basis for the development o f the 
new Country Partnership Strategy. 

Bo x 1: IFC FY02-04 Activities 

During FY02-04 CAS period, IFC invested $265 m i l l ion o f its own funds (43 percent 
in equity and 5 7 percent in loans) in 1 1 projects. IFC indicated that i t would 
complement the Bank’s efforts in private sector development by focusing on key 
areas such as restructuring o f municipal infrastructure, mobilizing financing for post- 
privatization restructuring, and supporting financial markets and SMEs. 
I t has been difficult for IFC to work a t the municipality level as there has been 
increasingly competing availability o f grant funds from various multilateral and 
bilateral sources. IFC supported three post-privatization restructuring transactions by 
financing the modernization o f a cable manufacturing plant ( ICME ECAB), by 
helping with the revamping o f Romania’s only producer o f refrigerators (Arctic), and 
by supporting Banc Post (a previously state owned bank). IFC was very active in 
developing the financial sector and small businesses. During this period, 91% o f IFC 
investment was in the financial sector which included a financing package o f $186 
m i l l ion to support the future privatization o f BCR (the largest bank in the country), 
tw o credit lines to expand mortgage lending, and financing to Pro Credit and the 
Romanian-American Enterprise Fund (RAEF) for on-lending to micro and small 
businesses. On the technical assistance side, IFC advised Romania’s Ministry of 
Health on the use o f PPPs in public hospitals to improve care, designed a capacity 
building program for Banca Romaneasca, helped local insurer Garanta t o convert 
from loca l to international accounting standards and carried out an assessment study 
of the mortgage bonds and securitization markets. 

B. 

CAS OUTCOMES 

1 5 . 

The CAS did not clearly articulate the expected outcomes,’2 and did not put in 
place a working monitoring and evaluation system to track progress o f benchmarks 
with the exception o f the high case triggers. Nonetheless, the CAS objectives were 
quite well understood, and progress in achieving results could be measured in terms o f 
improvements in certain indicators both over time and in comparison w i th EU-8. 
Some o f these indicators are included in the discussion o f the main thematic areas o f 
the CAS below. The CAS did have performance benchmarks but these were not 
monitored on a systematic and consistent basis. The focus o f attention was the high 
case triggers, which were mainly process indicators. 

16. 
The CAS objectives were aligned with the long term strategy o f poverty 
reduction. Two o f the three objectives - targeted poverty reduction and private sector 
led growth - formed the core o f the poverty reduction strategy o f the Government. 
The third CAS objective - institution building and governance reforms - was intended 
to improve delivery o f soc ia l services and improve the business environment. The 
third CAS objective was important to the achievement o f the first two objectives: the 
CAS emphasized that delays in building the needed administrative capacity had “an 
acute impact on the delivery o f health care and s o c i a l assistance, especially to the 

’’ This was prior to the results based CAS initiative. 

Annex C 
Page 9 o f 26 

poor, and on the business environment needed to attract foreign direct investment and 
private sector development, in turn to promote growth.” 

17. 
The CAS contributed to macroeconomic stability, growth, and poverty 
reduction, but was not as successful in upgrading governance. The private sector led 
growth objective saw some progress in actual outcomes due to the groundwork l a i d 
by PSAL-1 and the approval o f the PSAL-2 early in the CAS period which enabled 
the implementation o f certain critical reforms. There was also progress in poverty 
reduction from the resumption o f growth during the CAS period (2003 Poverty 
Assessment). However, there were delays in governance reforms, which began to 
make progress only towards the end o f the CAS period when the conditionalities o f 
the PAL-1 were being completed prior to Board presentation o f the loan. The fac t 
that the first PAL was approved after the CAS period - during which two PALS were 
envisioned - i s indicative o f slow progress in reforms. I n addition, the QAG Country 
Lending Enhance Review (CLER) in 2004 identified institutional capacity as 
continuing to be a major constraint to development. 

18 . 
The EU accession process, the current SBA, the Bank PA L program and CPS 
under preparation would help sustain the CAS reforms. The drive towards EU 
accession by 2007 puts on the front burner the public administration and judicial 
reform agenda o f the PAL program. In addition, the need to create fiscal space to 
support EU driven investments focuses government e f fo r ts to improve the efficiency 
o f public expenditure management, including the elimination o f quasi-fiscal deficits. 
The upgrading o f capacity to absorb EU post accession funds provides an impetus 
towards 
institutional development 
in major areas - such as environment, 
infrastructure, and soc ia l sectors - and i n particular at the sub-national level. The 
SBA and the PAL program support continued progress in major structural and 
institutional reforms, including privatization and energy sector restructuring. The 
CPS would utilize the lessons learned from the CAS and from EU-8 in defining new 
priorities and improving instrument m ix and design. 

B. I 

Targeted Poverty Reduction 

19. 
The rationale behind this component o f the CAS was the recognition that 
while growth would result in general poverty reduction, certain groups would get left 
behind, in particular those in the rural areas. Hence, the CAS designed a set o f 
operations focusing on strengthening the soc ia l safety net, improving soc ia l assistance 
targeting, and developing the rural sector. I t has been documented that the poor have 
l e s s access to health services, and poor children fare much worse when i t comes to 
school enrollment. I n the case o f rural poverty, increasing opportunities for non-farm 
employment for subsistence farmers and increasing productivity for medium and large 
farms would be key. 

20 . 
The CAS objective o f targeted poverty reduction had the following intended 
results: (a) improved targeting o f social benefits; (b) improved primary health care in 
poor and remote areas; and (c) a decline in rural poverty. These results were to be 
achieved by focusing on: (a) a selected set o f social sector operations; and (b) a group 
o f rural sector interventions. Education and health investments, i f properly channeled 
to benefit the poorer segments o f the population, would both reduce inequality and 
ensure satisfactory long term economic performance. 

Annex C 
Page 10 o f 26 

21. 
The results i n this component o f the CAS are mixed. The general poverty rate 
declined f rom 30.6 to 18.7 percent between 2001-2004 due ma in ly to the restoration 
o f grow th . However, certain groups continue to be l e f t behind - inc lud ing the Roma 
popu la t ion . Primary health care i n poor and remote areas has not improved, w i th the 
Hea l th Sector Project coming on stream on ly towards the latter part o f the CAS . 
However, support from the Social Development Fund i s seen to be effective i n 
a l lev ia t ing pover ty . I n addition, the introduction o f the M i n im um Income Guarantee 
Scheme improved targeting and coverage and was a factor in the reduction o f extreme 
pover ty . 

Social Sector Interventions 

22. 
The Social Sector Development Project approved i n 2000, wh ich was to be the 
major vehicle to support reforms i n major areas, had to be restructured i n early 2004. 
The project components - M & E for poverty po l icy , social insurance system reform, 
labor market adjustment, and social assistance strengthening - were w e l l aligned w i th 
the CAS and government program. The project had good analytical underpinning i n 
the form o f A A A , inc lud ing the 2002 PEIR. However, the CLER rated the overall 
qua l i ty at entry and implementation oversight o f the project as Unsatisfactory. The 
project was restructured i n early 2004, w i th current disbursement at only 20.6 percent, 
achieved almost entirely after restructuring. 
The CLER concluded that the 
restructuring d id not respond to the design weaknesses and i s ra t ing as low probab i l i ty 
the completion o f the project on t ime despite i t s be ing extended by one year to m id - 
2007. However, the latest (end-March 2006) ISR rates the project as moderately 
satisfactory w i th a l ike l ihood o f meeting the Development Objectives. 

23. 
The planned second Health Sector Re fo rm AP L came after the CAS period, 
but reforms were supported i n the meantime by the f irs t AP L . The f irs t Health Sector 
Reform A P L had as one o f i t s main development objectives the improvement o f 
health services in selected poor and remote areas. The loan was designed on the basis 
o f the experience o f an earlier operation and was consistent w i th a sector strategy 
approved by the Government. E f fec t ive support to and oversight o f implementation 
was provided by the Coun try O f f ice . However, supervision focused too much on 
project implementation aspects and l e s s so on results. Hence, the mon i tor ing and 
evaluation system lacked a results orientation, mak ing i t d i f f icu l t to determine 
progress i n achieving the development objectives. The second Health Sector Reform 
AP L corrects several o f the deficiencies o f the f irs t A P L and ensures sustainability o f 
the reform. 

24. 
The Second Social Development Fund Project i s recognized as a mode l for 
direct poverty a l lev ia t ion . The project i s rated by the CLER to be H igh ly Satisfactory 
i n terms o f both Qua l i ty at En try and Implementation. The objectives o f the SDF are 
to 
improve the 
l ive l ihood o f beneficiaries 
f rom poor ru ra l communities and 
disadvantaged groups; and to promote social capital enhancement and c iv ic 
engagement among project beneficiaries. There i s strong government ownership and 
c i v i l society support w i t h a strong team f rom the Coun try O f f ice overseeing 
implementation. Project objectives are l i k e l y to be met. However, longer term issues 
relating to decentralization and the ro le o f loca l authorities in the setting o f the SDF 
pr ior i t ies are not addressed. 

Annex C 
Page 1 1 o f 26 

25. 
The Rural Education Project pursues quality improvement, equity and 
efficiency, but the lack o f a rural development strategy constrains the exploration o f 
greater synergies that may be associated with a coherent and comprehensive 
approach. Nonetheless, the operation i s a solid piece o f work in preparation and 
design, good partnership arrangements, incorporation o f pilot experience, and a 
realistic and sensible approach to the difficult issue o f linkages to the longer term plan 
o f decentralization. The CLER has rated the project as Satisfactory in terms o f both 
Quality at Entry and Supervision. This project has major linkages w i th both rural 
development and decentralization o f public services, though these linkages have not 
been fully explored. 

26. 
The abovementioned lending operations were supported by a solid piece o f 
analytical work in the Poverty Assessment, as well as by a good poverty monitoring 
program. The Poverty Assessment confirmed the soundness o f the poverty reduction 
strategy o f the CAS by focusing on growth with targeted interventions in education, 
health, and soc ia l assistance. The findings o f the Poverty Assessment were used as 
inputs to the national anti-poverty strategy and the development o f a system o f 
monitoring and evaluating progress in the outcomes o f the anti-poverty program. 

27 . 

The above 
interventions are sustainable due 
to successor operations 
envisioned in the CPS. The objectives o f the S o c i a l Sector Development Project 
remain important and relevant, and an HD Programmatic DPL series i s being 
contemplated to move the reforms forward. The second Health Sector Reform APL 
was approved in December 2004 and w i l l sustain as well as improve on the reforms 
started in the first APL. The results from the Rural Education Project w i l l be assessed 
and further education reforms are contemplated as part o f the planned HD 
Programmatic DPL series. A Soc ia l Inclusion Loan under preparation w i l l build on 
the work under the SDF and the Social Sector Development Project.

labor intensive and the land plots are small with little incentive towards concentration. 
The different rural and agriculture interventions in the CAS were built on a prior 
SECAL, but policy back-tracking limited the effectiveness o f the CAS interventions. 
In retrospect, the investment operations should have been linked to the PAL program. 

29. 
The Rural Development Project supports the decentralization framework by 
involving the communities i n developing rural infrastructure. The project provides 
support towards the development o f national rural strategies for loca l roads and for 
water supply and sanitation. The project has c lose linkages w i th the PAL program in 
the areas o f governance and f i s c a l decentralization which w i l l help in the achievement 
o f the project development objectives. The Rural Development Project i s closely 
linked to the EU SAPARD and the Bank SDF programs, w i th the project having a 
more targeted coverage. I n the initial stage, the project had suffered from important 
implementation problems, which have been subsequently resolved. Currently, the 
project i s rated Satisfactory. 

30 . 
The Irrigation Rehabilitation and Reform Project i s a bold attempt at 
implementing a desirable irrigation and drainage strategy. The irrigation system i s 
inefficient with l e s s than 1 5 percent utilization. The project has proposed that the 
government formulate an effective exit strategy to abandon the systems that are not 
economically justified. The project i s pursuing the goa l o f establishing democratic 
and viable Water Users Associations. However, the lobby to resist reforms i s strong 
since the national irrigation agency i s unwilling to shrink the existing system causing 
hesitancy on the part o f the government to pursue the reforms. The achievement o f 
the development objectives w i l l depend on the ability o f the project to ensure 
sustained government commitment and to design a viable and acceptable program for 
restructuring the SNIF (national company dealing with arable land). 

3 1 . 
The Rural Finance Project was designed to introduce and f a c i l i t a t e market 
related rural finance intermediation. The project was based on a good review and 
analysis o f rural finance in Romania and was launched after the elimination o f 
concessionary lending, paving the way for the introduction o f market lending rates. 
The CLER rated the project as Satisfactory in terms o f Quality at Entry. However, 
the project suffered from implementation difficulties, resulting in an Unsatisfactory 
rating during the first two years. The CLER concluded that the rush to lend generated 
seriously flawed implementation arrangements and resulted in poor ownership by the 
borrower. In addition, the financial system i s quite liquid which would adversely 
impact the demand for project funds. I t i s too early to determine whether the project 
would achieve i t s development objectives although the team i s optimistic. 

32 . 
I n retrospect, there should have been a major ESW covering the agriculture 
and rural sectors as well as regional development to underpin Bank support. The 
CEM had a chapter on agriculture but came towards the end o f the CAS. The Jiu 
Valley Development ESW provided an analysis on how to promote econqmic 
recovery in a region devastated by restructuring o f its major industry, but the ESW 
was more region-specific rather than o f general applicability to regional development. 
Work on agriculture A A A was recently completed and submitted to government as 
well as discussed in a workshop, and this w i l l be an input to a future operation. 
3 3 . 
The rural and agricultural sector interventions should have been linked to the 
PAL program w i th conditionalities relating to privatization o f state farms and state 

Annex C 
Page 13 o f 26 

owned land, creation o f land markets, imposition o f hard budget constraints on state 
farms, and rationalization o f government support to the sector. This would have 
required up front analytical work and high level dialogue with the government. 

3 4 . 
Borrower performance was not satisfactory. Rural sector projects went 
through an unsatisfactory status. More important, the policy environment in the 
agricultural sector deteriorated during the CAS period. There was a general increase 
in aggregate nominal protection level, including and in particular exportables. There 
was also a dramatic worsening o f the composition o f public expenditures favoring 
input subsidies at the expense o f growth enhancing expenditures. 

3 5 . 

The sustainability o f the current set o f operations in the agriculture and rural 
sectors w i l l depend on the effectiveness o f the next set o f operations. The CPS 
provides an instrument for helping the government design a program that would 
address the same objectives as the previous CAS. The main lessons from the previous 
CAS are: (a) the need for solid analytical underpinning; and (b) the importance o f 
appropriate choice o f instruments. An Agriculture Sector Note has recently been 
drafted which w i l l underpin an Agriculture Loan, and a RuraVRegional Development 
ESW has begun to serve as a basis for the design o f a RuraVRegional Development 
Loan. 

B.2 

Pr ivate Sector Development 

36. 

The restoration o f growth led by private sector initiative was a major objective 
o f the government program. Growth was a lso intended to result in poverty reduction, 
another major objective o f the government as well as one o f the two strategic goals 
articulated during the CDF consultation process. The Poverty Assessment estimated 
that the achievement o f a five percent growth rate starting 2003 would reduce the 
poverty rate by ha l f by 2007. To achieve private sector led growth, the government’s 
immediate priority was to ensure macroeconomic stability, and hence the policy 
agenda during first part o f the CAS was dominated by measures to contain the f i s c a l 
deficit. To ensure sustained efforts towards macroeconomic stability, the government 
negotiated a new SBA with the Fund in 2002 and a successor SBA in 2004. The 2002 
SBA was successfully completed. 

37 . 
The CAS supported the government’s private sector led growth objective with 
a m ix o f instruments with PSAL-2 as the flagship operation. The areas o f focus were: 
(a) privatization o f remaining SOEs with emphasis on infrastructure and energy 
sectors; (b) adoption o f market oriented energy pricing policies and ta r i f f collection 
mechanisms; (c) reform o f the financial sector through privatization and strengthening 
o f supervision; and (d) expansion o f labor redeployment programs to support 
privatization. These measures complemented the SBA since many o f these reforms 
were necessary to deal with the sources o f f i s c a l vulnerabilities. Privatization, 
financial discipline, and dealing with quasi fiscal arrears were major themes o f PSAL- 

2 . 

3 8 . 
PSAL-2 was to be followed by a series o f Programmatic Adjustment Loans 
(PALs) and accompanied by A A A . The PALs would sustain the reforms initiated in 
the PSALs while supporting the needed institutional and governance reforms. A 
planned Regional Development Loan would support private sector development in an 

Annex C 
Page 14 o f 26 

area hard hit by economic transition - Jiu Valley which i s almost completely 
dependent on coal mining. I n addition, A A A would provide analytical underpinning 
to the post PSAL agenda, including the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) 
report, the Capital Market Assessment, and the Jiu Valley Regional Development 
Study.

39 . 
During the CAS period, there has been substantial improvement in private 
sector development related outcomes. Positive growth has been re-established at 4.5 
to 5 .0 percent, led primarily by investment and exports. Private sector share o f GDP 
increased from 65 to 70 percent between 2002-2004 as a result o f progress in 
privatization and new entry. FD I inflows picked up in 2003 and 2004, although 
privatization receipts continue to be a major component o f FD I w i th limited 
greenfield investment. Domestic credit to the private sector as share o f GDP also 
increased from 8.3 to 10.0 percent during the same period. The EBRD transition 
indicators show an overall improvement in the second phase o f reforms during the 
CAS period. 

40 . 
Progress in privatization was slow during the early part o f the CAS, but picked 
up starting 2003. Progress was impeded by the requirements that investors provide 
guarantees to preserve employment and make sizeable investments. 
I n 2003, the 
authorities implemented a large scale voluntary employment reduction program which 
facilitated the privatization o f some large loss makers. Outside o f the banking and 
energy sectors, since 2001 the government privatized 112 large companies w i th about 
1 12,000 employees in many cases w i th substantial employment reductions. Generous 
severance payments for laid o f f workers and write-offs o f liabilities have facilitated 
the privatization process considerably. 

Annex C 
Page 1 5 o f 26 

41. 
The soundness o f the banking system improved significantly. There was a 
discontinuation o f the use o f state owned banks for directed lending - mainly to SOEs 
- and financing o f enterprise losses . Out o f 39 banks, only one remains in State hands 
accounting for l e s s than 5 percent o f the banking system in term o f assets. The 
privatization o f the remaining bank i s underway. The 2003 FSAP review found the 
banks to be well-capitalized and liquid, although the reported high capital adequacy 
ratios may be somewhat overestimated because o f valuation problems.

Energy reforms have reduced related arrears and se t the stage fo r sector 
modernization. Electricity prices were brought closer to cost recovery levels and 
heating and domestic gas prices were 
increased although the 
latter remains 
substantially below import parity. U t i l i ty b i l l collection rates in the electricity and gas 
sectors have increased significantly and reached levels similar to those in industrial 
countries. However, wholesale electricity collection rate remains problematic and 
heating collection rate has risen only marginally. Estimated energy sector losses 
(including implicit subsidies) f e l l from 4 .8 percent o f GDP in 2001 to 1.7 percent o f 
GDP in 2004.

PSAL-2 achieved i t s stated objectives and contributed to the PSD outcomes. 
The PSAL-2 operation built on the successful PSAL-1 and its design i s closely linked 
to Fund conditionalities. The c l o s e linkage to the IM F program was a major success 
factor for PSAL-2. The overlap between the Bank and Fund conditionalities was 
substantial, especially in areas which have 
important f i s c a l and quasi-fiscal 
implications. This has led to stronger pressure on the government to maintain the 
reform momentum, and enabled the Bank and the Fund to coordinate more 
effectively. The Fund relied on the technical work o f the Bank in areas where the 
Bank had the expertise, including privatization and energy sector reforms. Each 
institution consulted the other on i t s conditionalities, including participation in each 
other's missions. The Fund's Ex-Post Assessment gives a favorable view o f the cross 
conditionalities in the context o f the Romanian SBA. I n addition, jo in t Bank-Fund 
communications w i th authorities have contributed to a successful policy dialogue. 

44 . 
The use o f an accompanying T A to support PSAL-2 helped enable 
implementation o f the program reforms. This i s based on the lessons from the 
FESAL, where absence o f administrative and managerial capacity was a major 
impediment. A Private Sector Institution Building Loan (PIBL) was approved to 
provide technical, assistance towards implementation o f the measures called for in the 
PSAL-1. A second T A support package - the Private and Public Sector Institution 

Annex C 
Page 16 o f 26 

Bu i ld ing Loan (PPBIL) - was approved to sustain and expand the work o f PPIBL, this 
time linked to PSAL-2 but intended to support also the planned Programmatic 
Adjustment Loans. The TA provided for privatization led to provision o f skilled 
investment bankers which produced buyers where none had been previously 
forthcoming, and introduced greater transparency to the process. 

4 5 . 
Nonetheless, given the slow pace o f disbursement o f the PPIBL, i t s approval 
may have been premature. While the PPIBL became effective in November 2002, by 
the end o f FY04, disbursement was l e s s than six percent. I n addition, the P IB L was 
only 43 percent disbursed at the time o f PSAL-2 approval, and the case could be made 
for using up the P IBL before embarking on a second TA loan. 

46 . 
The Government o f Netherlands provided a trust fund amounting to $3 m i l l ion 
to support the PSAL program. This trust fund was managed by the Bank and 
augmented the Bank TA resources. The existence o f this fund slowed the 
disbursements from the PIBL, since the Government understandably gave preference 
to the use o f grant funds. Nonetheless, the availability o f both grant and Bank 
resources to support implementation o f the reforms was a major factor in the 
successful implementation o f PSAL-2. 

47. 
Borrower performance has been satisfactory overall. 
I n the case o f 
privatization, changes in policy and TA support from the Bank helped move the 
process forward. Though there were delays from original program schedules, the 
difficult enterprise and banking reforms envisioned in the PSAL program were 
completed demonstrating high government commitment. The close collaboration 
between the Bank and the Government was a major success factor 
in the 
implementation o f the program. 

4 8 . 
The PALS, the SBA, and EU accession help ensure sustainability o f the major 
reforms from the PSAL program. 
I n particular, the design o f the P A L program 
established important linkages with the two PSALs, as shown in Table 6. The SBA 
approved in July 2004 includes benchmarks on privatization and other structural 
reforms, in addition to ensuring f i s c a l discipline. Coordination w i th the EC on both 
policy and technical assistance helped further the sustained implementation o f 
reforms, Consistent and coordinated messages and actions from the EC, IMF, and 
Bank helped break the stop-go cycle o f reforms which characterized the 1990s i n 
Romania.

Institution Building and Governance Reform 

49. 
The CAS intended to support institution building and governance reform by 
focusing on key areas. Some o f these critical areas included strengthening public 
expenditure management, developing regulatory and 
judicial 
reforms, and 
implementing anti-corruption strategies. The broad aim was to develop a culture o f 
accountability in the public sector. An important component o f the government 
capacity building was 
to ensure 
the proper design and execution o f the 
decentralization o f service delivery across a range o f sectors. There were a number o f 
inter-governmental issues: the need to create the appropriate incentives for sub- 
national levels o f government, as well as the need to strengthen capacities for sub- 
national governments to respond to the new demands o f the devolution process. 

50. 
Two Programmatic Adjustment Loans were envisioned to be the primary 
vehicles to support the Government e f f o r t s in institution building, supported by A A A . 
The programmatic approach would provide greater adaptability for step-by-step 
institutional reforms, capacity building that involves significant policy content, and an 
economy wide scope that goes beyond existing projects. The PALs would be 
underpinned by analytical work, 
including a Public Expenditure Review, a 
LegaliJudicial Diagnostic Review, and Country Financial Accountability Assessment. 
The PPIBL would support the PALs and the other investment operations programmed 
in the CAS would include institution building components focusing on specific 
sectors. The planned mix o f instruments was appropriate. 

Figures 8-13: Governance Indicators 

Annex C 
Page 19 o f 26 

Annex C 
Page 20 o f 26 

5 1 , 
The outcomes in the area o f institution building and governance reform were 
disappointing. 
The CLER highlighted “weak 
institutional capacity 
for 
the 
development and adoption o f policies, making timely and effective use o f external 
resources, and project implementation at a l l levels o f the GOR, especially at the 
increasingly important sub-national levels.” The review also noted that the donors 
saw institutional capacity as a significant problem area, and the perception was that 
‘7n Romania too much money i s chasing too little administrative/implementation 
capacity”. The governance indicators show that Romania continues to be lagging the 
EU-8 (see Figures 8 -13 ) . 

52 . 

However, i t should be noted that project l e v e l institution building e f f o r t s have 
been generally satisfactory. The investment projects in Romania have institution 
building components thus ensuring that capacities are established or strengthened in 
institutions that affect project implementation and outcomes. The technical assistance 
loans that supported the adjustment operations also helped ensure the institutional 
strengthening. 
I n particular, the work done with 
institutions dealing with 
privatization, banking supervision, energy, health and education has resulted in visible 
progress in capacity building. 

5 3 . 
The most important exogenous factor was EU accession. 
I n particular, the 
progress reports on the status o f EU accession provided the impetus for the 
Government to eventually focus - towards the latter part o f the CAS period - on the 
public administration and judicial reforms. Both the EU and the Bank gave consistent 
messages to the government and coordinated their efforts to support reforms. 

54 . 

Borrower performance during most o f the CAS period was disappointing, 
resulting in delays in implementation o f the PAL program. While two PALs were 
planned under the CAS, none was delivered during that period with the first PAL 
approved by the Board in September 2004. Movement in governance related reforms 
started late in the CAS period, mainly in the context o f EU accession. Only when the 
pressure o f EU accession began to intensify - in particular the need to close the acquis 
negotiations - did the Government begin to ac t on the difficult reforms i n the 
governance area. The PA L program was developed earlier but Government action 
came towards the end o f the CAS period. 

5 5 . 
EU accession 
requirements remain the major driver o f the public 
administration and governance reforms. While the acquis negotiations have been 
concluded, entry to the E U i s dependent on fu l f i l l ing certain specific requirements, 
including in the judicial area. Bank support w i l l be needed in both the design as well 
as implementation o f the reforms as embodied in the commitments o f the government 
in the context o f EU accession. 

56 . While the pace o f public administration and judicial reforms was slow, 
sustainability i s ensured by the EU accession and integration process. Support in 
these areas was requested as part o f the upcoming CPS. The PAL program was 
endorsed by the government that came in after the November 2004 elections. The 
PALs are to be accompanied by the Judicial Reform Project and the Revenue 
Administration Reform Project, while other investment operations are expected to 
have strong institution building component. I n addition, current and planned ESW 
w i l l support the reforms, including the Public Finance Study that i s under way. 

Annex C 
Page 2 1 o f 26 

57. 

The most important lesson in the context o f the next CAS i s the need to l ink 
public administration and judicial reform with the EU accession and integration 
process, Governance issues are given priority by the Government since slow progress 
in related reforms would result in a delay in the EU accession. The need to improve 
institutional capacity to absorb EU funds would focus Government attention on 
expenditure management and sub-regional institution building. Finally, the links 
between anti-corruption and business environment - as well as pressure from the EU - 
would push the Government to accelerate e f fo r ts in this area.

The CLER finds that the assistance provided under the CAS was relevant to 
the development objectives o f Romania, although with degrees o f success varying 
from project to project. The report concludes that the policy dialogue and the 
operations contributed to Romania’s economic turnaround post-2000 and that the 
focus o f the portfolio has brought the country closer to EU accession. PSAL-2 and 
P A L - I have been singled out as key drivers for structural change, while the CEM and 
the Poverty Assessment have been central to setting the policy agenda. This CAS 
Completion Report (CCR) concurs with the general findings o f the CLER. 

5 9 . 

The CCR rates the sustainable private sector growth component o f the CAS as 
satisfactory, that o f the targeted poverty interventions as moderately satisfactory, and 
the institution building and governance outcome as unsatisfactory. The OED Country 
Assistance Evaluation (CAE) in 2005 assesses as satisfactory or moderately 
satisfactory the outcomes o f a l l three CAS development objectives. Table 7 
summarizes and compares the QAG and CCR ratings.

The CLER rated the PSAL-2 as a successful operation in terms o f both Bank 
performance and achievement o f outcomes. PSAL-2 took into account the lessons o f 
past failed SECALs by dovetailing neatly its conditionalities with the Fund program 
and focusing on the CAS objectives. PSAL-2 drew on an effective m ix o f technical 
and strategic expertise, and achieved synergies between local and H Q s t a f f in project 
preparation and implementation. Client engagement during both preparation and 
supervision stages was effective, with a team that basically remained the same 
throughout the project. This contributed to achieving the results intended - there was 
significant progress in enterprise privatization, financial sector reform, reduction o f 
energy related quasi-fiscal deficits, and improvements i n the business environment. 

Annex C 
Page 2 2 o f 2 6 

61. 
The CEM, completed in 2004, was the main piece o f analytical work ca r r ied 
out during the FY 2002-04 CAS period and was well received. The CEM provided a 
comprehensive diagnostic o f the Romanian economy, seen from an EU integration 
perspective. I t s focus was on the enterprise sector restructuring, trade integration, 
energy sector reforms, competitiveness o f agriculture, flexibility o f the labor market, 
and the efficiency o f the financial sector. At the same time, the CEM identified the 
main risks and vulnerabilities to which the Romanian economy i s likely to be exposed 
in 
i t s quest 
for EU membership and provided a series o f substantive 
recommendations. The CLER rated the CEM as being o f “excellent quality”. 
However, the report came too late to integrate its conclusions into the F Y 2002-04 
operational program. I t is , however, extensively used in the preparation o f the CPS. 

62. 
The Poverty Assessment (PA) assessed the way economic growth and the 
Government-run soc ia l protection programs 
impacted poverty dynamics and 
composition. The PA covered the period 1995-2002 and was completed in 2003. 
While, just like in the case o f the CEM, the results o f the PA came too la te to be used 
as an input to the design o f the lending agenda, it has nevertheless been instrumental 
in triggering and providing the technical anchor for a series o f decisions subsequently 
taken by the Government. The findings o f the PA were used in the preparation o f the 
National Anti-Poverty and Promotion o f Social Inclusion Action Plan and have 
helped improve the formulation o f social policies. I t was also central to the initiative 
o f the Government to develop poverty evaluation capacities in the Anti-Poverty and 
Soc ia l Inclusion Commission (CASPIS), and has been a vehicle for stirring c iv i l 
society and private sector involvement in the anti-poverty debate and agenda. The PA 
brought, at the same time, into closer strategic alignment the agendas o f the Bank, 
EU, UNDP and bilateral donors. 

63 . 
Safeguard and fiduciary dimensions were addressed in the design o f a l l the 
projects launched under the FY 2002-04 CAS and in the supervision o f the projects i n 
the portfolio a t the time. 
In addition, the PAL included conditionalities related to 
financial management, building on the findings and recommendations o f the AAA , 
such as the recommendations related to public financial management from the first 
Romania Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) and the Romania 
Accounting and Auditing Report on the Observance o f Standard and Codes, both 
completed in 2003. 

64. 
The World Bank i s viewed to be responsive to clients, and i s held in high 
regard in Romania and most stakeholders appreciate the value added i t brings to the 
country in terms o f expertise. The CLER assesses that “Romanian Government 
officials almost universally expressed appreciation o f the conceptual and 
implementation assistance provided by Bank staff. They often contrasted this helpful 
attitude to the more limited engagement o f other donors.” Both the CAE and the 
CLER recommend ensuring s t a f f continuity, especially i n project management, to 
warrant the same degree o f effectiveness in the future. 

C.2 

Portfolio Assessment 

65, 
The Bank’s Romania portfolio i s the largest one in the ECA region in terms o f 
number o f projects and the third in terms o f commitments (after Turkey and Russia). 
Figure 14 presents the structure o f the lending portfolio by sectors as o f end-March 
2006. Since 1991, the Bank has approved 50 operations, w i th a total commitment o f 

US$ 5.0 billion, thus positioning i t s e l f as Romania’s prime development partner. B y 
end March 2006 the WB portfolio (lending and non-lending) totaled 3 1  operation^,'^ 
with an aggregated net commitment o f US$ 1,690 m i l l ion (including the PRG for 
privatization o f Banat and Dobrogea Electricity Distributors o f US$ 76.7million).

I n FY2002-04 the structure and s ize o f the portfolio reflected the improved 
macroeconomic framework and the strategic focus on supporting structural reforms 
and the development o f the private sector. About 41 percent o f net commitment in the 
period FYOl-04 was concentrated in a structural adjustment operation (PSAL-2), 
complemented by TA dedicated to support market-oriented and private sector friendly 
reforms. The agricultural sector was supported by 19 percent o f the to ta l net 
commitments through projects which included important institution building and 
community development components (Irrigation Rehabilitation, Rural Development) 
and 
recognized 
the 
importance o f environmental friendly behavior (Forest 
Development). The infrastructure sector received 1 1 percent o f the net commitment, 
targeted toward the development o f a well-functioning wholesale electricity market; 
in fac t the operation was added to the CAS approved program, to mitigate non- 
materialized expectations o f private sector financing. Two operations addressing high 
priorities in rural education and governance improvement (Rural Education and SDF 
11) absorbed 1 1 percent o f the net commitment, while the remaining 19 percent o f the 
net commitment addressed the need for reducing the environmental, social and 
economic vulnerability t o natural disasters and strengthening the institutional capacity 
for disaster management. 

67. 
During the CAS period the Bank delivered a US$ 775 m i l l ion program, higher 
than previous CAS programs although short o f the planned lending target o f US$995 
million due to the delays in the PALS . Only one loan was cancelled - the US$ 25 
m i l l ion TA loan for public institution building. However, the delivery o f some

projects (see Annex C/iia) was postponed by one calendar year on average. 
I n 
particular, both PSAL-2, scheduled for delivery in 2002, and PAL-1, scheduled for 
2003, were delivered with a one year delay. As described above, the slower than 
estimated 
launching o f the enterprise and bank restructuring agenda and 
implementation o f the institutional and governance reforms delayed the delivery o f 
the lending operations. 

68 . 
The A A A program was marginally in terms o f implementation, though those 
that were completed were generally o f good quality. The program cuts across sectors 
and themes and included a series o f analytical studies - the PA, the CEM, the Energy 
Sector Study, the CFAA, and the FSAP - which formed the framework for 
subsequent government reforms. About 60 percent o f the non-lending services were 
delivered as planned (see Annex C h i ) . Six A A A products were dropped, either 
because their original themes were addressed elsewhere, such as the Labor Market 
Analysis which was incorporated into the CEM, or because they lost relevance from 
the perspective o f the direction o f the reform. The CEM and the PA were viewed as 
quality products w i th important value added to both the country dialogue and the 
design o f the upcoming CPS. 

69. 

The performance o f the portfolio i s satisfactory. 
Due to the pro-active 
management approach jo in t ly implemented by the Government and the WB, the large 
majority o f Romania's lending portfolio performs well, and the risk indicators 
improved, as shown in the Table 8 . Commitment at risk decreased from over US$250 
m i l l ion at the beginning o f the CAS period to around US$80 m i l l ion in FY 06 . The 
latest status o f each ongoing project i s presented in Annex C/iv.

The portfolio review process, jo in t ly carried out with the Government on a 
yearly basis, has contributed to improving the performance o f the projects. To assure 
the full developmental impact o f the WB financed projects, the portfolio i s jo in t ly 
managed by the Romanian Government and the WB. A JPR was carried out between 
May - June 2005 to review a selected number o f projects which either experienced 
implementation bottlenecks, or were at risk o f becoming problem projects in the 
future, although they remain relevant for the country’s program. The three key 
objectives o f the JPR were to ( i ) review the implementation status o f the selected 
projects to identify the major constraints and to prepare time-bound action plans; ( i i ) 
identify mature projects which may need to be closed/restructured and ( i i i ) assess the 
relevance o f the projects against the EU imperatives and changing national 
development objectives. The findings o f the JPR were discussed w i th the Ministry o f 
Public Finance followed by a high level meeting led by the Prime Minister (PM) and 
the Country Un i t Director (CD), w i th key Cabinet members participating. Portfolio 
management efforts have intensified since, w i th the introduction o f quarterly reports 
on actions agreed with the government during the jo in t portfolio review meetings. I n 
addition, a se t o f key arrangements to accelerate projects implementation and the 
management o f closing dates has been agreed w i th the Ministry o f Public Finance, i n 
Ap r i l 2006. 

72 . 
The Joint Portfolio Review has identified several cross-cutting issues which 
a f fec t the disbursement performance o f projects: 

I s Disbursement ra t io : the ra t io o f disbursements du r ing the f isca l year to the undisbursed balance at 
the beg inn ing o f the fiscal year ( fo r investment loans on ly) . 

Annex C 
Page 26 o f 26 

Cumbersome approval procedures o f small rural investments. The practice o f 
high level approval by the Government and the Inter-Ministerial Committees o f 
small value demand-driven investment sub-projects has specifically impacted the 
DO o f projects targeting capacity building at local level. This issue i s now 
resolved through simplification o f the approval process o f small demand-driven 
investments at the level o f the project Steering Committee. 

Lengthy decision-making process. This i s particularly serious when coordination 
among different Government institutions i s required. This issue affects projects 
whose activities imply inter-ministerial cooperation or clearances from multiple 
government bodies (i.e. General Cadastre and Land Registration). 

Lengthy loan approval procedures. The lengthy decision making process for 
getting a loan approved or amended i s a major constraint, and often delays the 
completion period which i s now, on average, planned for 4 years. 

Financial management aspects. Two issues requiring attention are: (i) the 
imposition o f ceilings for withdrawals from loans; and ( i i ) problems w i th the 
timely availability o f counterpart contribution. Both these issues relate to the r ig id 
f i s c a l stance assumed by the Government. The Government and the Bank have 
recently agreed on specific ways to mitigate the negative impact o f such issues. 

C.3 

Country D ia logue and A id Coordination 

73. 
The Country Office plays a lead role in the dialogue with the Government on 
key policy aspects and in resolving day-to-day implementation issues. The Romania 
Country Office functions on a highly decentralized basis, w i th a large number o f 
supervision and project preparation tasks delegated to the national officers, across the 
sectors. Currently ten projects are being supervised by CO staff and one operation 
has been prepared by local TTLs. The Government highly appreciates the just-in- 
time service o f the Bank. These services have been further improved w i th the 
relocation and strengthening o f the procurement and financial management and 
disbursement services in the CO. 

74. 
The Bank enjoys a close relationship with the EC Delegation in Bucharest 
which has not only ensured a good f i t between E U and Bank activities, but has 
facilitated the Government’s interface w i th the two institutions. A first-ever jo in t 
BanUEU Country Procurement Assessment Review was carried out in February 
2005, and recommendations were made to harmonize the requirements o f the two 
institutions in the National Procurement Standards under preparation. 

75. 
The World Bank agenda and the I M F program became increasingly integrated 
during the CAS period. Collaboration between the Bank and the IMF i s a central 
pillar o f the assistance to the Romania structural reform agenda. The Bank provides 
the technical inputs in monitoring the progress o f actions common to the SBA and the 
PA L operation, as we l l technical assistance and expertise for the implementation o f 
the measures agreed w i th the IM F .

Sector-wide approaches, i n which the Bank’s financing 
share i s typically low , are expected to increasingly become 
xominent in the Romania program, for example i n the 
.ransport, environment, social protection, agriculture 
-estructuring, education and health areas. I n some projects,

1 . 

As part o f the elaboration o f the Country Partnership Strategy, a public 
consultation campaign was conducted to improve Bank responsiveness to the client 
needs. The campaign consisted o f a Client Survey and a series o f public consultation 
meetings in six towns throughout the country. The consultations included small, 
medium and large towns as well as 
localities at different levels o f economic 
development. Through these two instruments, valuable information on public 
perception and priorities was collected as input to the design o f the partnership 
strategy. The consultation process was implemented during Ap r i l and May o f 2005. 

2 . 

A t the end o f the public consultation process, the general conclusion was that 
there i s a general perception that Romania still has a relatively low ability to absorb 
the EU funds associated with the accession. Accordingly, most participants 
welcomed Bank’s assistance in knowledge-sharing and possibly even training i n areas 
such as project identification and management as well as the provision o f matching 
funds necessary to access the EU funds. The key messages are summarized below. 

M a i n findings f r om the C l ien t Su rvey 

3 . 
The Client Survey was a two-step process including a questionnaire and i n 
randomly selected cases, a follow-up interview. The surveyed population included 
representatives o f Government, Agencies and Ministries; members o f the Parliament; 
Project Management Unit representatives; and members o f the academia, c iv i l 
society, business sector and media. The data collection was done by a leading 
Romanian opinion poll company that interviewed a total number o f 3 2 2 respondents.

4 . 

The Client Survey found that a significant majority o f respondents are familiar 
with the work o f the World Bank in Romania. An interesting fac t i s that this 
awareness i s translated to a positive attitude towards the Bank with a majority 
appreciating the involvement o f the institution on the ground. The most valuable 
contributions brought by the Bank were viewed to be the financial resources, policy 
and economic adv ice , and the Bank’s international knowledge. 

5 . 

The research survey identifies the public perception o f the main challenges 
and development priorities that Romania faces . 
EU integration, inadequate 
infrastructure development and inadequate access to quality education are considered 
as the main challenges for Romania’s sustainable development. The key development 
priorities for Romania are grouped around almost familiar themes: successful EU 
integration, reduced corruption, better business and investment climate, more 
effective government, better functioning law and judicial system, and reduced 
poverty. Respondents consider that the Bank should focus most o f i t s resources on 
support for EU integration, infrastructure development, health sector reform, and 
poverty reduction measures. 

M a i n findings f rom Pub l ic Consultation Meetings 

6. 
Six meetings were organized in the cities o f Timisoara, Ias i , Galati, 
Alexandria, Craiova and Sibiu. Overall, about 170 people participated representing a 
diverse group o f c iv i l society. Participants were selected to represent a wide a range 
o f interests, occupations, and involvement in key areas - public administration, 
businesses, NGOs, public service, the Church, minorities, public communications, 
public health, education system, media, e tc . The broad objective was to validate the 
existing knowledge and obtain an updated assessment o f the public perception on 
economic and soc ia l issues at loca l community level. To ensure objective feedback 
the Bank team assumed a listening mode. 

7. 

The discussions raised sensitive themes and made a reality-check against 
World Bank’s and Government’s perceptions. The main findings were to a great 
extent similar t o the ones already identified by the Bank in partnership with the 
Government. While the ranking may vary from region to region, participants were in 
agreement about the main issues that need immediate attention: infrastructure, 
environmental concerns, health services, education, soc ia l protection, measures for 
disadvantaged groups, the disparities between urban and rural areas, problems relating 
to the business environment and the good functioning o f the public administration, as 
well as problems related to the EU accession. 

8 . 

Under in f ras t ruc tu re for instance, the discussions raised the issue o f the low 
quality o f roads as well as the degradation o f other systems such as irrigation or dams 
and land improvement operations which can a f f e c t the env ironment . Water sewage 
systems and deterioration o f urban housing (apartment buildings) were also quoted as 
affecting the l iv ing standards. 

9 . 
On both education and health there was consensus that the poor state o f 
facilities (schools and hospitals) as well as the low quality o f services need more 
attention. Emphasis was given to access to quality education and good medical 
services as main factors for addressing the disparity between r u r a l and u rban 

Annex E

areas. Despite the steady economic growth o f the past years, there i s public 
perception that large categories o f Romanians - such as the elderly, minorities, and 
the people w i th disabilities - are disadvantaged, and social gaps need to be bridged 
through better social inclusion and/or social protection. 

10. 

The debate also focused on areas that may become obstacles for improving 
l i v i n g standards. Corruption and red-tape were indicated as problems impinging on 
the healthy development o f the business sector. Public administration was also 
perceived as bureaucratic, lacking professionalism and often embracing corrupt 
practices. 

1 1 . 
Concerns were expressed that Romania i s s t i l l w i th a low level o f 
preparedness for the E U accession and membership. As a consequence, the country i s 
not benefiting in f u l l from the access to E U funds. 

Ove ra l l Conclusions. 

0

0 

Bank i s a valued partner, both for its financial but also for its international 
expertise and analytical work; 
M a i n priorities o f Romania in which Bank should assist are related to the E U 
integration process; 
I n view o f the Romanian public most important i s to address disparities 
between urban and rural population. 
Key areas for development w i th Bank assistance in future years are education, 
health and infrastructure.
