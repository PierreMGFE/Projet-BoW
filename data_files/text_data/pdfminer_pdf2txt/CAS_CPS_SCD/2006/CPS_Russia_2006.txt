EXECUT IVE SUMMARY 

i. 
The last World Bank Country Assistance Strategy (CAS ) for Russia was prepared in 
2002 for cooperation along three main pillars: (a) imp rov ing the business environment and 
enhancing competition, (b) strengthening pub l ic sector management, and (c) m i t iga t ing social and 
environmental risks. In retrospect, this appears t o have been an appropriate choice o f p i l lars , and 
W o r l d Bank Group cooperation w i t h the Russian government was substantial and produc t ive 
throughout the CAS per iod . 

ii. Du r ing the CAS implementation period the economic and political context for World 
Bank Group cooperation with the Russian government changed considerably. Since the 
preparation o f the CAS , Russia has experienced f i v e years o f strong economic g row th and 
pover ty reduction. Furthermore, sharp increases in the prices o f Russia’s ma in expor t 
commodities, most pa r t icu la r ly o i l and gas, have f i l l e d the co f fers o f the federal government, and 
p rov ided fo r the accumulation o f over US$300 b i l l i o n in monetary and f isca l reserves. Russia’s 
g loba l ro le as G-8 member, re-emerging donor, and p rov ide r o f w o r l d energy has expanded 
notably. Accord ing ly , recent years have witnessed the beg inn ing o f a ma jor trans i t ion in the 
nature o f cooperation between the W o r l d Bank Group and the Russian government. The Coun try 
Partnership Strategy (CPS) fo r 2006-2009 outlines a p lan fo r comp le t ing this trans i t ion to a 
qua l i ta t ive ly new and no l e s s produc t ive re la t ionsh ip that i s based on new moda l i t ies o f 
cooperation. 

iii. 
This Country Partnership Strategy reflects a strong commitment by both the World 
Bank Group and the Russian government to continue a close and productive relationship that 
i s suitable to the new conditions. W h i l e the federal government n o longer needs the f inanc ia l 
support o f the W o r l d Bank , i t s t i l l values h igh ly W o r l d Bank knowledge, experience, and pro jec t 
management s k i l l s . N e w bo r row ing b y the federal government w i l l be quite limited over the 
pe r iod o f this CPS, whereas the use o f guarantees, subnational bo r row ing and new fee-for-service 
arrangements fo r investment and po l icy advice are l i k e l y to g row . I F C and MIGA operations w i l l 
rema in substantial (Russia i s IFC’s and MIGA’s largest exposure). The successful full trans i t ion 
to new moda l i t ies o f cooperation w i t h the Russian government w i l l depend on strong 
coord ina t ion among IBRD, I F C and MIGA. 

i v . 
Remaining developmental challenges in a large number of Russian regions suggests 
an enlarged role for the Bank Group in direct assistance at the subnational level. This i s 
par t icu lar ly the case fo r the pe r iod o f this CPS, as most far-reaching structural re forms w i l l l i k e l y 
take the f o rm o f reg iona l in i t ia t ives o r p i lo ts . Russian regions exh ib i t an enormous amount o f 
economic, geographic, and ethnic d ivers i ty . The federal government has encouraged the Bank 
Group t o deepen i t s d irec t invo lvemen t in the regions. Correspondingly, a central theme o f this 
Strategy i s the focus o f Bank G roup ac t iv i t ies in select regions, inc lud ing economic analysis 
(g row th and business environment diagnostics), reg iona l development strategies, and related 
investment projects. 

v. 
This CPS envisions a partnership with the Russian government for the realization of 
four primary objectives: (a) sustaining rap id growth, (b) imp rov ing pub l ic sector management 
and performance, (c) imp rov ing the de l ivery o f social services, and (d) enhancing Russia’s g loba l 

i 

ro le . The f i r s t three p i l la rs correspond closely to the p i l la rs o f the prev ious CAS, and channel 
support d irec t ly toward the development challenges and po l ic ies elaborated in the government’s 
Med ium -Te rm Econom ic Program, w i t h a par t icu lar focus on the regions. The fou r th p i l la r forms 
the basis fo r a new area o f assistance, and concerns Russia’s in tegra t ion in the w o r l d economy 
and donor community. 

v i . 
Sustaining rapid growth (p i l lar 1 ) w i l l require reducing the current high dependence of 
the economy on energy prices. 
I t w i l l also depend o n sustained macroeconomic stability, a 
business c l ima te consistent w i t h more compe t i t ion and ease o f do ing business, h igher rates o f 
pr iva te investment, and measures t o ensure adequate infrastructure and qua l i f ied labor supply. 
The Bank Group w i l l o f fe r a w ide range o f po ten t ia l assistance products under this p i l la r , 
inc lud ing support fo r macroeconomic po l icy , reserve management, supporting key state 
investments and PPPs fo r g row th and d ivers i f ica t ion , iden t i f ica t ion and a l lev ia t ion o f barriers to 
g row th at the reg iona l level, investment and technical assistance t o support the development o f 
f inanc ia l markets, and d irec t support t o the pr iva te sector. 

v i i . 
Reforms in the public sector (pillar 2), most particularly in government administration 
at federal, regional and local levels, remain high priorities in the government’s agenda. 
Despite enormous progress since 1999, the most recent experience in Russia in the ba t t le w i t h 
corrup t ion and administrative barriers t o business has been rather m ixed . The Bank w i l l continue 
on-going cooperation fo r modern iz ing key pub l ic sector institutions, and fo r re fo rm ing the 
government apparatus and budgetary framework. 
I t w i l l also step up cooperation in jud ic ia l 
re fo rm and cou ld become more invo lved in loca l self-government o r na t iona l an t i-corrup t ion 
in i t ia t ives . 

v i i i . 
The development of effective social services in health, education, housing and utilities, 
and social assistance (pillar 3 ) has lagged behind economic growth in Russia. This poses an 
obstacle t o sustaining rap id we l fare increases and pover ty reduc t ion in the country. The 
improvement o f social services i s therefore a ma jor foca l po in t o f current budgetary re forms and 
p r io r i ty Na t iona l Projects in Russia. As the respons ib i l i ty and in i t ia t ives f o r imp rov ing social 
services l i e s at the reg iona l leve l o f government, they are a na tura l focus o f Bank reg iona l wo rk 
fo r developing e f fec t ive systems o f social assistance, hea l th care, and education. Hous ing and 
communa l services i s another possible area o f Bank invo lvemen t through a na t iona l pro jec t 
implemented in the regions. 

i x . 
Working with Russia as a donor (pillar 4) forms a new area for cooperation. Russia i s 
in the process o f deve lop ing i t s ODA strategy. The Bank can support this process b y p rov id ing 
access to i t s development expertise and know ledge o f the new a id architecture, as w e l l as through 
the use o f Bank instruments fo r channeling Russian developmental assistance. In addition, the 
Bank Group i s a partner in the fulfillment o f Russia’s in terna t iona l obligations re la ted to g loba l 
public goods. The la t ter includes s ign i f ican t po ten t ia l opportunities in the carbon market. 

x . 
Possible instruments of cooperation consist of direct support to the private sector ( IFC 
and M I G A ) , a small number of 
loans to the federal government with a high share of co- 
financing, subnational loans without sovereign guarantees, grants, partial risk guarantees, 
conventional and reimbursable T A or project management (fee-for-service), carbon finance, 
and asset management (prov ided b y the Bank ’s Treasury Department). G iven Russia’s healthy 
f inanc ia l position, ove ra l l Bank lending w i l l be modest over the 2007-2009 CPS period. 

x i . 
The CPS i s very much in line with the major tenets of 
the Bank Group’s recently 
approved strategy for engagement with Middle Income Countries, as re f lec ted b y (i) f lex ib le , 
demand dr iven nature o f the CPS; (ii) p r ima ry focus on p rov id ing g loba l know ledge to Russia 
w i t h active invo lvemen t o f loca l academia and think tanks; (ii) development o f a business mode l 

11 

fo r fee-based services and TA implementation; (iii) selective use o f IBRD f inanc ia l services in 
support o f c r i t ica l ins t i tu t ion building and p i lo t ing o f investment finance frameworks at federal 
and reg iona l levels; ( iv ) increasing emphasis on sub-national f inanc ing w i thou t sovereign 
guarantees; (v) engagement w i t h Russia as a G8 member and emerg ing donor in support fo r 
g loba l development; and (v i ) enhanced Bank G roup synergies though closer Bank - IFC 
co l labora t ion on investment c l ima te assessments and sub-national f inanc ing . 

The proposed strategy faces some implementation r i s k s . The s ign i f ican t strengthening 

x i i . 
o f Russia’s economic and debt pos i t ion has greatly reduced macroeconomic risks at the federal 
leve l , and the f inanc ia l risks in many regions. However , the full shift towa rd new moda l i t ies o f 
cooperation, and the expansion o f programs at the subnational level, present s ign i f ican t 
challenges. N ew moda l i t ies im p l y the need fo r a number o f procedura l adjustments fo r bo th the 
Bank and the Russian government. 
In order to generate a s ign i f ican t impact, and create 
opportunities fo r scaling up, the Bank w i l l need t o concentrate i t s l im i t e d resources p r ima r i ly in a 
sma l l select group o f care fu l ly chosen regions. I f Russia’s economic and po l i t ica l conditions 
limit the use o f trad i t iona l Bank instruments faster than anticipated, the t ime fo r developing 
e f fec t ive new moda l i t ies o f cooperation cou ld prove insu f f ic ien t . As 
the procurement 
environment fo r Bank projects in Russia remains complex, the Bank w i l l need t o pay close 
attention to safeguarding i t s operations. F ina l ly , Russia’s quest f o r economic d ivers i f ica t ion 
po in ts towa rd some po ten t ia l ly con trovers ia l areas o f econom ichndus tr ia l po l icy that w i l l require 
care fu l attention. 

The period covered by this CPS is one of great opportunity for Russia. Macroeconomic 

x i i i . 
performance has never been stronger. F isca l and monetary reserves are accumulating at a rap id 
rate. 
Increasing in tegra t ion w i t h w o r l d markets i s v is ib le . Po l i t ica l s tab i l i ty and cooperation 
w i t h i n the government and regions have reached unprecedented levels. The Russian government 
now has bo th the f inanc ia l and po l i t ica l means t o boost economic po l ic ies and re forms t o new 
levels in tack l ing the s t i l l form idab le developmental challenges fo r the country. Movemen t to 
new moda l i t ies o f w o r k and the rea l iza t ion o f the proposed p rog ram present a number o f 
strategic, log is t ica l , and technical challenges t o the W o r l d Bank Group and the Russian 
government. Yet, the progress that has already been achieved i s sound evidence o f the poss ib i l i ty 
o f success. 

x iv . 

Board members may wish to discuss the following questions: 

0 I s the Russia CPS consistent w i t h the Bank Group’s emerg ing strategy f o r engagement in 
M I C countries? 

A r e the CPS strategic p i l la rs chosen appropriately, g iven Russia’s current development 
challenges, po l icy pr ior i t ies , and the Bank ’s comparative advantages? 

Does the CPS strike an appropriate balance between federal leve l and reg iona l leve l 
engagement? 

0 Does the CPS appropriately address the risks and possible obstacles to comp le t ing a 
transition o f the Russia p rog ram t o new moda l i t ies o f operation w i t h i n the CPS period?

COUNTRY CONTEXT 

C o u n t r y B a c kg round 

1. 
Russia i s an exceptionally large middle-income country which has undergone a 
dramatic transition from a centrally planned to a market economy. Russia’s gross na t iona l 
produc t in 2005 amounted to US$764 b i l l i o n (US$5,342 per capita), p lac ing i t in the mid range o f 
middle income countries. F r o m v i r tua l complete state ownership in the Sov ie t period, rough ly 80 
percent o f a l l enterprises in Russia n ow operate in the pr iva te and corporate sector, and rough ly 
70 percent o f the housing stock has become p r iva te ly owned. The terr i tory o f the coun try i s vast 
and accounts fo r 13 percent o f the wor ld ’s land mass. The Russian Federation i s d iv ided i n t o 88 
regions (Subjects o f the Federation), wh ich d isp lay very d i f feren t socio-economic, c l ima t ic and 
geographic conditions. Russia’s popu la t ion o f about 143 m i l l i o n people includes 140 recognized 
nationalities and 4 0 ethnic groups. Russians comprise the ove rwhe lm ing ma jo r i ty o f the 
popu la t ion (80 percent), but a number o f non-Russian e thn ic groups dominate on a reg iona l basis 
in republics and d is tr ic ts (Okrugs) o f the country. The enormous reg iona l and ethnic d ivers i ty in 
Russia complicates the task o f ensuring an e f f ic ien t and harmonious development o f the entire 
country. 

2. 
Owing to its r ich resource base, Russia plays a crucial role in global energy and 
resource markets. Russia has almost 30 percent (47 t r i l l i o n cubic meters) o f the wor ld ’s proven 
na tura l gas reserves, and proven o i l reserves o f 60 b i l l i o n barrels. Russia curren t ly accounts fo r 
22 percent o f the wo r ld gas market, i s one o f the two largest o i l producers (along w i t h Saudi 
Arabia), and i s the fou r th largest producer o f e lec tr ic i ty . Russia also boasts s ign i f ican t wea l th in 
coal, uran ium ore, iron-ore (around fo r ty percent o f wo r ld reserves), copper, gold, tin, n icke l , 
platinum, tungsten, mo lybdenum . In addition, Russia i s excep t iona l ly r i c h in non-me ta l l ic m inera l 
resources. Russia’s forests con ta in an estimated quarter o f the wor ld ’s t imber .

3. 
Most of the positive macroeconomic trends in Russia identified in the 2002 CAS have 
continued and strengthened. Russia i s in i t s eighth year o f robust economic growth; GDP 
expanded b y an estimated 48 percent between 1999 and 2006. G r ow t h resumed fo l low ing the 
sharp depreciation o f the rub le and hardening o f budget constraints in the wake o f the 1998 c r i s i s . 
I t has been subsequently sustained b y large terms-of-trade gains, responsible macroeconomic 
po l icy , and some key structural reforms. H i g h o i l revenues and export g row th have led t o large 
and g row ing current account surpluses 
(over 10 percent o f GDP in 2005). Prudent 
macroeconomic po l ic ies and ac t ive debt management can be associated w i t h high f isca l su rp luses 
and the achievement o f investment grade creditworthiness ratings since 2004.

The strong recent performance of the Russian economy owes to a number of factors. 
In the immed ia te aftermath o f the c r i s i s , the comb ina t ion o f an exceedingly weak ruble, 
substantial excess indus tr ia l capacity, and cheap energy resources supported an indus tr ia l 
recovery and expansion that was broad ly based across Russian regions. In this context, many o f 
the poorer Russian regions exh ib i ted the highest rates o f grow th . As the rub le appreciated 
steadily in rea l terms and produc t ion costs increased, g row th rates in industry, and in the 
economy as a whole, began to decline in 2001 and 2002 (Tab le 1). A number o f enterprises that 
had become p ro f i tab le under conditions o f a weak ruble and excess capacity began to struggle, 
thereby ra is ing questions about the sustainability o f the economic expansion.

I n 2003, Russia received another impetus to growth from sharp increases in the 
prices of 
its commodity exports, most notably oil and gas. The o i l sector responded t o h igher 
market prices w i t h an i n i t i a l rap id expansion, although capacity constraints and po l icy 
uncertainties have slowed g row th in o i l output since the second h a l f o f 2004. Nevertheless, 
higher o i l and gas prices have continued t o stimulate domestic demand, wh ich has recen t ly 
become the p r ima ry driving force o f economic grow th . At the same time, the huge o i l and gas 
revenue in f lows have placed strong upwa rd pressure on the Russian ruble, thereby further 
increasing compe t i t ive pressures on the tradable and manu fac tur ing sectors o f the economy. 
Since the second h a l f o f 2004, economic g row th has become increasingly concentrated in trade, 
construction, and services, wh i le many sectors o f manu fac tur ing have exh ib i ted much slower 
grow th . 

6. 
Responsible macroeconomic policy 
has 
supported Russia’s 
impressive 
accomplishments. The accumulation o f f isca l surpluses has been a c r i t ica l factor in ma in ta in ing 
ove ra l l macroeconomic s tab i l i ty and a slower pace o f rea l currency appreciation. The Russian 
government and Central Bank have shown notable restraint in macroeconomic po l icy , and have 
avoided po ten t ia l ly des tab i l iz ing f isca l expansions, bo th du r ing the economic c r i s i s in the late 
1990s and during the pe r iod o f huge surplus o i l revenues s ince 2003. The t igh ten ing o f 
macroeconomic po l icy f o l l ow i n g the cr is is hardened budget constraints, and was the catalyst fo r 
p u l l i n g Russia out the “v i r tua l economy” syndrome o f escalating arrears, debt, and mu tua l offsets. 
W h i l e federal budgetary revenues have soared to w e l l over 20 percent o f GDP since 2004, federal 
expenditures have remained lowe r than 18 percent o f GDP. S ign i f ican t improvements are also 
v is ib le in budgetary practices at the federal and subnational levels, including the e l im ina t ion o f 
non-cash operations and most unfunded federal mandates.

Although domestic 
and 
foreign 
direct 
investment are s t i l l somewhat low relative to Russia’s 
needs, investment has been growing even more rapidly 
than GDP in recent years, and has become an 
increasingly important source of economic growth. F r om 
a very l o w base in the late 1990s, f ixed cap i ta l investment 
has g rown at any average ra te o f 9 percent since 2000, as 
compared to 6 percent average GDP grow th . A large share 
o f investment (27 percent) i s concentrated in energy and 
pipelines. But substantial investment has been impor tan t 
in some other sectors as we l l , and can be associated w i t h 
substantial res truc tur ing in many service industries, the food indus try and some areas o f machine- 
building. I n f l ow s o f d irec t fore ign investment have p icked up no tab ly in recent years, reaching 
an estimated US$13 b i l l i o n in 2005.

Private sector development has benefited from far reaching tax reforms and the 
reduction of some administrative barriers to business. Among a number o f structural re forms 
that have imp roved the bus iness environment in Russia in recent years, tax re fo rm stands out as a 
key accomplishment. The comp lex i ty , ins tab i l i ty , and excessive fo rma l burden o f the Russian tax 
system created ma jor problems fo r business development throughout the 1990s. The consistent 
and determined pursuit o f tax r e f o rm has decreased the number o f taxes, lowe red the overa l l tax 
burden considerably, and greatly alleviated (although no t yet solved) the p rob lem o f perceived 
ins tab i l i ty in the business environment. Russia was one o f the first countries to pioneer a f la t 
income tax o f 13 percent, and has been steadily reduc ing the rates o f some o f the other ma jor 
taxes. The un i f ied social tax was reduced f r o m 35.6 to 26 percent in 2005, and the p r o f i t tax rate 
declined f r om 35 to 24 percent. The VAT rate was reduced f r om 20 t o 18 percent, and i t s further 
reduc t ion i s curren t ly under discussion. In add i t ion t o taxation, surveys o f entrepreneurs c o n f i rm 
pos i t ive results f r om a campaign s ince 2001 to target “administrative barriers to business” in 
registration, licensing, inspections, customs, and other areas. M a n y ind ica tors o f Russia’s 
investment c l ima te have imp roved in recent years, and Russia n ow compares favorab ly w i t h other 
transition and B R I C countries b y some o f these indicators.

Expanded profit opportunities, structural reforms, and harder budget constraints 
have further accelerated the development of market institutions in Russia. One o f the most 
notable changes has been the emergence o f an active market in corporate con tro l , and a 
corresponding strong shift in ownership o f the ma jo r i ty o f Russian f i r m s f r om employees to 
outside shareholders. A number o f sectors o f the economy, pa r t icu la r ly the food industry, have 
attracted s ign i f ican t investment, undergone ma jo r restructuring, and achieved rap id p roduc t iv i ty 
growth. F r o m the verge o f collapse in 1998, the Russian bank ing sector has rebounded and i s 
g row ing rap id ly , a l though leve ls o f f inanc ia l in termed ia t ion rema in l o w re la t ive to Central 
Europe. A number o f larger Russian f i r m s have become increas ing ly interested in tapp ing 
international markets, and have thus pursued a higher degree o f openness and transparency. The 
number o f recent Russian IPOs i s impressive. In 2005, Russia witnessed a surge o f IPO ac t iv i ty 
in bo th vo lume and value t e rm s : 11 IPOs took place in 2005 ra is ing to ta l cap i ta l o f US$4.9 
b i l l ion .

Assuming that the Russian government sticks to its basic economic policies, the 
Russian economy should continue to exhibit healthy growth throughout the CPS period. O i l 
p r ices present the p r ima ry source o f uncertainty fo r bo th the pace and nature o f g row th in the near 
future. In the medium te rm , capacity constraints may increas ing ly limit the pace o f the economic 
expansion wh i le overa l l g row th prospects continue t o depend greatly on economic po l icy .

11. 
Growth since 1999 has been strongly pro-poor, and can be associated with rapidly 
rising income, declining unemployment, and fa l l ing poverty rates. Rea l incomes o f the 
popu la t ion have been increasing faster than GDP, expand ing b y an estimated 86 percent between 
1999 and 2005. The unemployment rate ( L O de f in i t ion ) continues t o fa l l , reaching an estimated 
7.6 percent in 2005 - down f r o m over 12 percent in 1999. The recent W o r l d B a n k Pover ty 
Assessment noted a reduc t ion in the pover ty headcount f r o m 41.5 t o 19.6 percent between 1999 
and 2002, and subsequent o f f i c i a l data suggests that these trends have continued through 2005.

Following the halving of poverty

stated an objective to halve the poverty rate

this

The World Bank poverty monitoring confirms that economic growth and the 
associated creation of higher-paying jobs have been the primary factors behind success in 
poverty reduction. Indeed, wo rk ing fam i l ies w i t h ch i ld ren have the highest incidence o f pover ty 
in Russia. In add i t ion to h igher-pay ing jobs created b y growth, increases in wages in the 
budgetary sphere have had a pos i t ive impac t on pover ty reduction. However , i t w i l l be d i f f i c u l t

a m idd le income coun try w i t h well-developed public education and l o w child mo r ta l i ty , Russia 
has already achieved o r i s close to ach iev ing some o f the M i l l e n n i um Deve lopmen t Goals. The 
pr imary areas o f concern f o r mee t ing the MDGs in Russia are in the spread o f in fec t ious diseases 
and environmental sustainability. A summary i s g iven be low (Box 1). 

Box 1. Russia and the Millennium Development Goals 

The status o f Russia ach iev ing the M i l l e n n i um Deve lopmen t Goals can be summarized as fo l lows : 

On the eradication of extreme poverty and hunger , Russia reduced absolute pove r ty (be low US$2 a 
day) to 6.3 percent in 2002 at the t im e o f the Pover ty Assessment. I t has mos t l i k e l y dec l ined even 
further since then. 

Universal pr imary education has already been v i r tua l ly achieved in Russia w i t h 97-98 percent o f the 
popu la t ion rece iv ing p r im a r y education. 

O n gender equality and the empowerment of women , Russia boasts ind ica tors fo r education, health, 

and social services that are comparable t o those o f O ECD countries. S t i l l , d iscr im ina tory attitudes 
toward women in the labor marke t are s t i l l prob lema t ic . 

Ch i ld mortality f e l l to an estimated 11 per 1000 b i r ths in 2004, and materna l morbidity i s also 
dec l in ing and w e l l o n track t o meet the MDG goals. 

H lV /A lDS i s no t yet widespread in Russia, but i s nevertheless expand ing at a r a p i d rate. The number 
o f reported cases o f H IV quadrupled between 2000 and April, 2006, m o v i n g f r om less than 80,000 t o a 
reported 342,500 cases. The number o f cases o f TB mo re than doub led du r ing the same per iod . I n 
addition, TB remains a serious challenge, and a h i g h p r i o r i t y f o r the government. 

Environmental degradation i s increasing in many areas in Russia a long w i t h economic g row th . 

Russia’s new p o l i c y p r io r i t ies and Na t iona l Projects in the soc ia l sphere may have a pos i t ive impac t o n 
rema in ing MDG challenges. H a l f o f the spending fo r the Na t iona l Pro jec ts i s devoted t o health, and 
contains a specific H I V / A I D S - T B component. Y e t a stronger na t iona l campa ign w i l l mos t l i k e l y be

p r ima ry p r io r i t ies in recent years, b u t w i l l no doubt requ ire mo re a t ten t ion as prob lems accumulate. 

A number o f serious social problems in Russia are no t f u l l y re f lec ted in the usual MDG breakdown. 
A l though average pover ty rates have declined, concentrated pockets o f severe pove r ty rema in . W h i l e c h i l d

Average male l i f e expectancy in Russia i s o n l y 59 years, as opposed to 7 2 fo r women. Thus, adu l t health in 
Russia can also be considered a gender issue. The education system suffers f r o m a number o f weaknesses 
for a country o f Russia’s income level. See Annex 2 fo r a discussion o f these and other c r i t i c a l social 
issues . 

Regional Dimensions 

15. 

The 88 regions of the Russian Federation exhibit considerable geographic, ethnic, 
economic and political diversity, and challenges in regional development are becoming 

increasingly important. The factors that supported reg iona l ly broad-based g row th since 1999 (a 
weak ruble, cheap energy and labor, excess produc t ive capacity) have n o w essentially 
disappeared. Strong differences among Russian regions, re f lec t ing the Soviet legacy o f 

6 

settlements that bear l i t t l e re la t ion to economic comparative advantage, suggest that reg iona l 
inequa l i ty w i l l l i k e l y become an increas ing ly acute problem. These prob lems are spelled out in 
de ta i l in Annex 2. 

The Political Context 

16. 
The 2000s have witnessed a significant consolidation of power in Moscow. In this 
context, an unprecedented degree o f po l i t ica l s tab i l i ty and cooperation between the federal 
government, Parliament, and reg iona l administrations has replaced the former environment o f 
sharp po l i t ica l con f l ic t and impasse. A trend toward the devo lu t ion o f powe r f r o m Moscow to the 
regions in the 1980s-1990s has been reversed. Since 2000, the government has pursued 
in i t ia t ives to b r ing subnational leg is la t ion and po l ic ies in l i n e w i t h federal laws and pr ior i t ies . 
The most s ign i f ican t such measure was probab ly the in t roduc t ion o f the d irec t presidential 
appointment o f reg iona l governors in 2004. W h i l e enhanced po l i t ica l s tab i l i ty and the ro le o f the 
federal government o f fe r advantages and opportunities fo r Russia, these developments can also 
be associated w i t h concerns in some circles that the g row ing po l i t ica l centralization and 
government par t ic ipa t ion in the economy may be becom ing excessive. Recen t popular surveys 
show a m i x o f bo th support and skep t ic ism about current directions o f economic development and 
po l icy (see B o x 2).

17. 
While the appetite for national reforms has weakened at the federal level, there i s 
increasing interest in launching major structural reforms as pilots or local initiatives in 
selected regions, particularly in the area of public services. A pe r iod o f re la t ive ly rap id 
structural re fo rm fo l lowed the 1998-99 f inanc ia l crises. Subsequently, the rap id g row th o f the 
Russian economy, high o i l prices, and the v i r tua l comp le t ion o f many “ f i r s t generation” re forms 
have understandably s lowed the pace o f structural re form . An increas ing ly cautious attitude 
toward re fo rm in Moscow was re in forced by social unrest that fo l lowed the mone t iza t ion o f 
social benefits in early 2004. O n the other hand, there remains po l i t ica l momen tum beh ind some 
prev ious ly launched na t iona l reforms, inc lud ing loca l self-government, pub l ic administration, 
budgetary reform, and e lec tr ic i ty sector. 
I n t e r e s t in Moscow fo r launch ing reforms at the 
subnational leve l has been increasing. The appointment o f reg iona l governors has eased fears on 
po ten t ia l con f l ic ts o f interest in the delegation o f au thor i ty . The pre-e lec t ion environment also 
creates a p rem ium f o r sh i f t ing respons ib i l i ty f o r d i f f i c u l t social re forms to lowe r levels o f 
government. F ina l ly , as the 2005 mone t iza t ion r e f o rm made apparent, Russian regions are 
su f f ic ien t ly heterogeneous t o suggest that a single un i f ied na t iona l approach to every re fo rm may 
no t be op t ima l . 

18. 
Russia has assumed a more prominent international role. I t hosted the G-8 in 2006, 
has completed the vast ma jo r i ty o f b i la tera l negotiations fo r WTO entry, has ra t i f ied the K y o t o 
Protocol, and has been assuming increasing in terna t iona l ob l iga t ions as an emerging donor. 
Russia has recently j o i n e d the Mu l t i la te ra l Debt Reduc t ion In i t ia t ive , and plans to w r i te o f f 
US$700 m i l l i o n o f debt in 16 enhanced H P IC countries in 2006. Par t o f this debt w r i te -o f f i s t o

w i t h various beneficiary countries in A f r i c a and the W o r l d Bank . Russia has also agreed to 
con tr ibu te to several in terna t iona l development partnerships, inc lud ing the A v i a n Flu Trust Fund, 
Educa t ion F o r A l l E a s t Track In i t ia t ive , and the G loba l V i l lage Energy Program. Russia has also

Key Development Challenges 

19. 
Despite the many recent positive developments in the Russian economy, the country’s 
developmental challenges remain formidable. The investment c l ima te in Russia s t i l l suffers 
f r om uncertain property rights enforcement, inadequate competition, barriers to m igra t ion , and 
problems in pub l ic governance. These problems find re f lec t ion in s t i l l l o w p r iva te investment 
leve ls and a marked s lowdown in the g row th o f manu fac tur ing in recent years. The i r so lu t ion 
becomes increasingly c r i t ica l to ma in ta in ing rap id g row th as capacity and labor supply constraints 
increas ing ly bind in high g row th regions and the rub le appreciates. Russia’s high dependence on 
o i l and gas, coupled w i t h re la t ive ly l o w average p roduc t iv i ty in manufacturing, complicates the 
rea l iza t ion o f d ivers i f ied g row th and the e f fec t ive in tegra t ion in to w o r l d markets. 

20. 
A successful development strategy needs to address a highly complex set of 
challenges. 
They inc lude rema in ing hurdles in economic trans i t ion t o a market economy 
(judiciary, regulatory institutions, etc.), i s s u e s common t o developed market economies (such as 
aging population, eradication o f poverty), problems stemming f i o m the dominance o f extractive 
industries and the effects o f “Du tch Disease,” and Russia-specific tasks (more e f f ic ien t 
development o f i t s vast mu l t i -e thn ic terr i tory , o f wh ich a large par t functions under harsh c l ima t ic 
conditions). 

21. 
Russia’s primary development challenges are described in detail in Annex 2 . B e l ow 
i s a summary o f key i s s u e s grouped in to fou r categories: sustaining rap id grow th ; pub l ic 
governance; p rov is ion o f social services; and in tegra t ing Russia in the wo r ld economy. 

A ) Sustaining rapid growth 

Ma inta in ing macroeconomic stability 
in the context of 
large foreign 
inflows. 
Macroeconomic s tab i l i ty remains c r i t ica l fo r economic growth, and depends on 
s ter i l iz ing a large par t o f the current large fo re ign in f lows through reserve accumulation. 
Yet po l i t ica l and social pressures are moun t ing fo r a f isca l loosening. 

Diversification. The economy remains h igh ly dependent on o i l prices, economic g row th 
i s s low ing no tab ly in most “tradable” sectors o f the economy, and Russia has yet t o 
develop distinct comparative advantages in manufacturing. Con t inued upwa rd pressure 
o n the rea l exchange rate f r o m resource exports complicates the development o f these 
comparative advantages. 

Investment climate. The investment c l ima te remains difficult, wh ich pa r t icu la r ly hinders 
investment growth, the development o f entrepreneurship and a dynamic, d ivers i f ied , and 
knowledge-based economy. A l though f ixed cap i ta l investment has been g row ing no tab ly , 
i t i s s t i l l l o w (18 percent o f GDP) re la t ive t o other dynamic emerging marke t economies. 
On the one hand, recent W o r l d Bank surveys indicate that, according t o a number o f 
business c l ima te indicators (registration, taxation, customs, inspections) in Russia have 
reached, o r even surpassed, leve ls achieved in Ch ina and Ind ia . Nevertheless, despite 
progress made in some areas the Russian business c l ima te s t i l l suffers f r om weak 
competition, a weak jud ic ia ry , the common capture o f markets at the reg iona l leve l , 
problematic access to land and premises, rema in ing uncertainty over proper ty rights, and 

8 

various other administrative barriers. W h i l e Russia made rap id progress between 2000 
and 2003 in imp rov ing the investment climate, the results have been much more m ixed in 
more recent years. Russia’s rankings 
in the W o r l d Econom ic F o r um G loba l 
Competitiveness Repor t and Transparency In terna t iona l also dec l ined no tab ly in 2006 
re la t ive to 2005. 

Infrastructure needs. Over the trans i t ion period, Russian in fras truc ture has deteriorated 
and suffered 
f r om underinvestment. 
Transportation bottlenecks are becom ing 
increasingly acute and there i s a g row ing concern about the ava i lab i l i ty and re l iab i l i ty o f 
e lec tr ic i ty supply. Strong economic g row th has also created a rap id ly g row ing demand 
fo r infrastructure services. Shortages o f hous ing infrastructure limit m ig ra t ion f lows that 
are essential fo r sustaining rap id g row th and pover ty reduc t ion 

Labor supply. As the popu la t ion shrinks and ages, labor supply, pa r t icu la r ly sk i l led labor 
supply, i s becom ing an increas ing constraint on economic grow th . T ra in ing and 
vocational education are inadequate. The dependence o f fu ture g row th on substantial 
external m ig ra t ion poses d i f f i c u l t po l i t ica l and economic questions w i t h respect t o current 
m ig ra t ion po l icy and i t s enforcement. The government has adopted a number o f recent 
measures t o promote and regulate e f fec t ive ly m ig ra t ion f lows . 

F inanc ia l intermediation. Russia’s bank ing sector remains small, dom ina ted by state- 
owned banks, and po ten t ia l ly vulnerable to external shocks. D e s p i t e the impressive 
g row th o f Russia’s bank ing and f inanc ia l sectors in recent years, external f inanc ia l 
constraints f o r Russian f i r m s con t inue t o f o rm impor tan t limiting factors to Russia’s 
continued rap id expansion. 

Environmental degradation. In recent years, env ironmen ta l i s s u e s have no t received top 
po l i t ica l p r io r i ty in Russia. As a result, accumulating env ironmen ta l problems may 
present g row ing threats in many areas. B o t h changes in federal administrative 
arrangements and fur ther decentralization o f env ironmen ta l management can be 
associated w i t h increasing reg iona l d i f feren t ia t ion in the qua l i ty o f env ironmen ta l 
oversight. The current indus t r ia l expansion, increases in veh ic le ownership, l o w energy 
e f f ic iency , and insu f f ic ien t a t ten t ion to the sustainable use o f Russia’s vast na tura l 
resources, represent impor tan t env ironmen ta l challenges that cannot be neglected.. . The 
government i s n ow vo ic ing concerns over the current lack o f c la r i ty in arrangements fo r 
na tura l resource pro tec t ion and broader environmental oversight. 

B ) Public governance 

Public administration. During the trans i t ion period, Russian c i v i l service has suffered 
f r om the Soviet legacy o f l o w pay, weak economic (performance based) incentives, and 
an administrative apparatus riddled w i t h ine f f ic ienc ies and redundancies. The re fo rm o f 
public adm in is tra t ion and the c i v i l service has been a top p r io r i ty f o r the government in 
recent years, although progress has thus far been l im i ted and m ixed . 

Intergovernmental fiscal relations. The Russian system o f in tergovernmen ta l f isca l 
relations can be associated w i t h d is tor ted incentives and ine f f ic ienc ies at lowe r levels o f 
government. Reforms in f isca l federa l ism and loca l self-government are curren t ly be ing 
implemented in Russia, tack l ing a set o f impor tan t rema in ing challenges. 

Judiciary. The Russian jud ic ia ry s t i l l suffers f r om l o w t r u s t o f the population, 
corruption, and l im i ted capacity. Jud ic ia l re fo rm has jus t i f iab ly rece ived more attention 
f r om the government in recent years. 

9 

Ant icorrupt ion Efforts. Recent studies ( inc lud ing the Bank ’s BEEPS survey) suggest 
that the dec l in ing trend in corrup t ion registered between 1999 and 2002 has been 
reversed. A sharp increase in pub l ic revenues and in pub l ic investments at least pa r t ia l ly 
contributes t o such trends, as in other countries w i t h s im i la r resource w ind fa l ls . The 
issue o f corrup t ion i s recognized as a p r io r i ty at the highest levels o f Government and a 
number o f an t icorrup t ion measures are be ing put in place. An t ico r rup t ion e f for ts are also 
an important segment o f the adm in is tra t ive re forms agenda o f the M i n i s t r y o f Economic 
Development and Trade and re f lec ted in the Government’s M i d - T e rm Program. 

Inc lus ion and civil society involvement. C i v i l society ins t i tu t ions are no t f u l l y 

developed, and this presents a challenge to the process o f c i v i l engagement in decision- 
making, and in ensuring public accountability 
f o r a l l leve ls o f government. The 
rea l iza t ion o f the current r e f o rm o f loca l-se l f government cou ld p lay a c r i t ica l ro le in 
creating a founda t ion fo r the development o f grass roots c i v i l society. 

C ) The Social Sector and Social Services 

Poverty and social services a t the subnational level. The respons ib i l i ty fo r most social 

po l icy has been delegated t o the reg iona l and loca l levels. Yet huge reg iona l inequalities, 
regressive social assistance, and l im i t e d government capacity poses ma jo r challenges. 

Extremely unfavorable demographic/health indicators and trends. Fo r a m idd le 

income country, Russia has excep t iona l ly high ind ica tors o f mo r ta l i ty and mo rb id i ty . 
The threat o f AIDS and tuberculosis epidemics continues t o grow . An ageing popu la t ion 
places an increasing burden on the pension and hea l th systems. 

Education. The pub l ic education system in Russia i s in need o f modern iza t ion and a 
greater or ien ta t ion toward the needs o f a modern market economy t o imp rove the qua l i ty 
o f school education and student’s learn ing outcomes in Russia. 

Access to social services for the poor. Rap id ly g row ing fo rma l and in fo rma l costs o f 
qua l i ty hea l th and education services place a par t icu lar burden on the poor. The Bank ’s 
recen t Poverty Assessment and other studies show Russia’s social assistance system t o be 
one o f the most regressive among trans i t ion countries. Be t ter measurement o f pover ty 
and i t s structure at the reg iona l leve l w i l l be key tasks in m o v i n g forward . 

Hous ing and communal services. Poo r ly developed markets in hous ing and communal 
services represen t barriers t o welfare improvements and much needed m igra t ion . 
Hous ing and communal service markets in Russia su f fer f r o m inadequate compe t i t ion 
and various regulatory distortions. 

0 ) Russia’s Global Role and Integrat ion into the Wo r ld Economy 

W T O accession and free trade agreements. Russia stands to p r o f i t s ign i f ican t ly f r om 
deeper in tegra t ion in to the w o r l d economy. In add i t ion to the d irec t bene f i ts f r om gains 
f r om trade, rap id in tegra t ion i n t o the w o r l d economy o f fers the po ten t ia l fo r rap id 
ins t i tu t iona l development, the improvemen t o f corporate governance and other standards, 
and benefits f r o m competition. 

Emerg ing donor and G - 8 member . Russia’s g row ing economic strength has boosted i t s 
importance, and created a need f o r deve lop ing capacity, in i t s g loba l roles as emerging 
donor and G-8 member. The 2006 G8 Presidency granted Russia a un ique oppor tun i ty 

10 

f o r active invo lvemen t in the po l icy d ia logue on impor tan t g loba l and reg iona l issues, fo r 
p rov id ing ma jo r inputs, and f o r tak ing the lead o n specific themes and agendas. 

Russia’s environmental significance on a global scale. Russia’s env ironmen ta l 
resources are o f national, regional, and g loba l importance. Addressing issues l i k e i l lega l 
logg ing , b iod ivers i ty conservation and reduc t ion o f carbon emissions can p rov ide loca l 
and g loba l benefits. 

The Medium-Term Social-Economic Program o f the Russian Government 

22. 
Russia’s 2006-2008 Mid-term Program, approved in early 2006, addresses many of 
the country’s most important development challenges. I t encompasses the ma in objectives of 
“ imp rov ing the welfare o f the popu la t ion and reduc ing pover ty through dynam ic and sustained 
g row th and higher competitiveness.” The p rog ram embodies the strategic goa l o f doub l ing GDP 
and cu t t ing pover ty in h a l f in t e n years as set b y President Putin and endorsed b y the Russian 
Parliament. I t reflects intensive debates over the right m ix between bu i ld ing marke t ins t i tu t ions 
and s t imu la t ing g row th through pub l ic investments. The f ina l mid-term p rog ram i s consistent 
w i t h the basic re fo rm orientation o f the f i r s t years o f Putin’s Presidency. 
I t advocates a 
comb ina t ion o f measures to promo te p r iva te sector development and competition, 
the 
improvemen t o f social services, and specific comm i tmen ts to state investments in infrastructure 
and d ivers i f ica t ion , 
including pub l ic-pr iva te partnerships, state 
investment 
funds, state 
development banks and support fo r special economic zones and I T parks. Subsequent t o the 
adop t ion o f this program, President Pu t in ’s annual address to the Federal Assembly p laced 
emphasis on some add i t iona l pr ior i t ies , most no tab ly reversing the prob lema t ic demographic 
trends. 

23. 
The Government’s Program targets the key problems of the absence of 
incentives 
and opportunities for the development of human capital, low efficiency of state governance, 
low levels of competition and a high share of the %on-market economy,” weak diversification, 
problems in the mobility of factors between regions, a low level of 
integration of Russia in the 
world economy, infrastructure constraints, and an uneven record in reform at the subnational 
leve l of government. Special p r io r i t ies in the p rog ram are: 

The realization of 
the four National Projects in health, education, housing, and 
agriculture. These projects w i l l allocate a planned 382 b i l l i o n rubles ( U S $ 14 b i l l i o n 
equivalent) in add i t iona l government money to these areas. The pro jec t in hea l th 
accounts fo r rough ly h a l f o f this spending, to be directed towa rd salary increases, 
modern iza t ion o f equipment, and creation o f new health fac i l i t ies . Add i t iona l resources 
devoted to education w i l l go mos t ly towa rd pay increases, inc lud ing incen t ive pay f o r 
teachers, and grants fo r p rom is ing students. M u c h o f the na t iona l hous ing pro jec t o f fers 
assistance t o fam i l ies fo r purchasing housing, e i the r through redeemable certificates, 
subsidized mortgages, o r guarantees. The agriculture program also has a strong soc ia l 
orientation, and consists large ly o f various subsidies fo r farmers. 

Increasing the efficiency of social policy, services and assistance. The M e d i um T e rm 
Program also targets a number o f s truc tura l deficiencies in health, education, housing, 
and social assistance. Pr ior i t ies inc lude developing performance-based budge t ing t o 
measure and imp rove service de l ivery , increasing incen t ive pay fo r doctors and teachers, 
rea l loca t ing resources toward preventive and pr imary care, re fo rm ing hea l th insurance, 
modern iz ing programs in education, expand ing relevant professional training, fac i l i ta t ing 
the entry o f pr iva te business in hous ing and communal services, deve lop ing targeted 
social assistance, and rea l iz ing (rev i ta l iz ing) pension re form .

The continuation of reforms in government administration and the civil service. The 
new wave o f administrative re fo rm expands the p rog ram t o the reg iona l leve l o f 
government. The p r ima ry current focus i s the in t roduc t ion o f best practices in basic 
organization, standardization, e l im ina t ion o f redundancies, performance-based pay, as 
w e l l as measures to limit the unwarranted interference o f state bodies in economic affairs, 
fight corruption, and disclose more in fo rma t ion t o the pub l ic . Concerns over corrup t ion 
have mo t iva ted more recent attention to this area. A comprehensive rev iew i s underway 
o f Russian leg is la t ion w i t h an eye to correc t ing loopholes f o r corrup t practices. 

Promoting competition, entrepreneurship, and diversification through measures to 
strengthen market institutions, improve the business climate, and alleviate barriers to 
the movement of capital between sectors. Specific measures concern the strengthening 
o f property r igh ts (disclosures, cour t protection), corporate governance ( imp rov ing 
standards, pro tec t ion o f m ino r i ty shareholders, disclosures), bank ing sector ( improved 
mon i to r ing and tighter pruden t ia l norms to force mergers o f smaller banks), land and rea l 
estate 
(cadastre, 
registration, p r iva t iza t ion o f land under enterprises), 
taxa t ion 
p r iva t iza t ion (requiring subnational governments t o se l l un i tary enterprises and other 
property), compe t i t ion po l icy , and in tegra t ion w i t h the w o r l d economy. 

Realizing the knowledge-based potential for growth and innovation in Russia. The 
Program emphasizes a number o f po l icy directions a imed at igniting the “ innova t ion 
economy” in Russia, inc lud ing a greater state comm i tmen t t o research and development, 
better pro tec t ion and enforcement o f in te l lec tua l proper ty rights, and the fo rma t ion o f I T 
parks and state venture funds. 

Alleviating infrastructure constraints to growth. The government i s increasing i t s own 
f inanc ia l comm i tmen t to building infrastructure, par t icu lar ly in transportation, but also 
plans to re ly increasingly on Pr iva te Pub l ic Partnerships. 

Realizing a transition in regional policy away from equalizing growth potential to 
supporting points of economic growth. Government assistance in in fras truc ture and 
finance w i l l p r io r i t ize areas w i t h the po ten t ia l t o become o r expand as g row th po in ts in 
the economy. This includes the placement o f Special Econom ic Zones in high g row th 
areas. The welfare imp l ica t ions o f unequal reg iona l development w i l l be met to a larger 
degree through po l ic ies t o promo te m ig ra t ion t o areas o f g row th agglomerations. 

Zmplementing effectively the ongoing far reaching reforms in inter-budgetary relations 
and local self-government. The former delegate a much greater degree o f expenditure 
autonomy to regions and localities, wh i le leav ing the determination o f the revenue s ide o f 
subnational budgets qu i te centralized. The latter r e f o rm promises t o trans form loca l 
mun ic ipa l i t ies 
in to genuine budgetary 
e n t i t i e s w i t h we l l-de f ined autonomy, 
responsibility, proper ty ownership, and electoral responsibilities to the popu la t ion . 

24. 
Problems in demography and migration are receiving particular attention. This 
became a pr imary po in t o f emphasis in President Putin’s address to the Federal Assembly o f M a y 
2006. President Putin announced a p lan that wou ld substantially increase state c h i l d and 
maternity support f o r fam i l ies w i t h t w o o r more ch i ldren and also ca l led fo r measures t o fac i l i ta te 
lega l m igra t ion to Russia f r om the former Soviet Un ion . The Medium-Term P rog ram contains 
proposals fo r s imp l i fy ing reg is tra t ion and other procedures f o r lega l migrants, as w e l l as fo r 
attracting h igh ly qua l i f ied workers f r o m abroad.

THE WORLD BANK GROUP’S PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY 

Past Bank Assistance and Lessons f rom the Previous CAS 

25. 
The World Bank Group’s relaiionship with Russia has transformed over time, as the 
Bank developed from a partner of necessity to a partner of choice. Russia jo ined the Bank in 
1992, soon after the d isso lu t ion o f the Soviet U n i o n and at the outset o f economic transition. 
Broad ly , the Bank ’s focus has been on he lp ing build the ins t i tu t ions o f a market economy, 
developing the pr iva te sector, and m i t iga t ing the social costs o f transition. Since 1998 crisis, 
Bank assistance moved towards support fo r pub l ic adm in is tra t ion re fo rm and anti-corruption, 
budget management‘, tax co l lec t ion ; federal-regional f isca l relations; improvements in the 
business environment; pr iva te sector investments; and rehab i l i ta t ion o f education and hea l th 
systems w i t h e f for ts t o address the tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS crises. B y the time o f the 2002 
CAS , the Bank’s re la t ionsh ip w i t h Russia was already chang ing considerably. As the 
government n o longer requ ired budget support and was more interested in the Bank ’s know ledge 
and technical expertise, the 2002 C A S inc luded a shift in emphasis towa rd more ana ly t ica l and 
advisory ac t iv i t ies (AAA). At the same time, I F C and MIGA increased their invo lvemen t 
considerably in l i n e w i t h g row th o f the pr iva te sector. The attached C A S Comp le t ion Repor t 
o f fers a more complete assessment o f the experience and lessons o f the imp lemen ta t ion o f the 
prev ious CAS . A summary i s g iven be low . 

26. 
The design and implementation of the previous CAS closely followed the priorities of 
the Russian Government, which strengthened ownership of the Bank program. In l i n e w i t h 
Government’s medium-term program, the 2002 C A S focused B a n k support t o Russia a long three 
strategic p i l lars : (i) imp rov ing the business environment and enhancing competition, (ii) 
strengthening pub l ic sector management; and (iii) m i t iga t ing social and env ironmen ta l r i s k s . The 
C A S also projected seventeen investment projects in support o f the three C A S p i l la rs f o r a to ta l 
amount o f about US$1.8 b i l l ion . G iven much h igher government revenues due t o rising o i l 
prices, the actual lend ing vo lume was less than pro jec ted - t e n projects to ta l ing US$1.2 b i l l ion . 
These projects, together w i t h AAA and TA, helped the government realize key objectives in 
budgetary re fo rm (par t icu lar ly at the reg iona l level), land cadastre and registration, customs, 
pub l ic administration, infrastructure, education, health, environment, and capacity bu i ld ing . 

27. 
The Bank contributed to progress under each of 
the three strategic CAS pillars, 
although its role was not equally strong in a l l areas. O n the f i rs t C A S pillar, improv ing the 

business environment and enhancing compe t i t ion , Bank instruments appropriately emphasized 
AAA rather then lending, wh i le W o r l d Bank G roup direct support to the pr iva te sector expanded. 
The Bank made considerable ana ly t ica l con tr ibu t ions to economic development and investment 
c l ima te mon i tor ing . While the accomplishments in these areas were significant, the structural 
re fo rm agenda fo r imp rov ing the business c l ima te i s far f r om complete; administrative barriers to 
business and investment rema in significant, par t ic ipa t ion o f SMEs in the economy continues to be 
l o w and progress in the area o f na tura l monopolies has been l im i ted . The Bank’s con t r ibu t ion to 
the second CAS p i l la r , improv ing pub l ic sector management, has been s ign i f ican t . AAA focused 
on federal functions where there was appetite bo th fo r re fo rm and Bank support (tax, treasury, 
customs and f isca l federalism). A re la t ive ly sma l l vo lume o f lend ing resulted in a s ign i f ican t 
scaled up impact. The goals o f the third p i l la r , m i t iga t ing soc ia l and environmental risks, were 
expansive in scope and address issues that are long t e r m in nature - hea l th care, education, 
ins t i tu t iona l care o f children, pover ty reduction, and the Sov ie t environmental legacy. The 

13 

Bank ’s e f for ts were more successful when focused on po l icy analysis and consensus building, or 
responded t o a clear government request such as in c h i l d welfare, adult health, HJY /A IDS , 
pover ty assessment and forestry studies. 

28. 
A QAG review noted the very significant impact of the Bank’s AAA work during the 
CAS period. As noted, the C A S placed increased emphasis on AAA, wh ich inc luded a Coun try 
Econom ic Memorandum, a Pover ty Assessment, investment c l ima te assessments (Adm in is t ra t ive 
barr ier mon i to r ing b y FIAS, Business Env i ronmen t and Econom ic P roduc t iv i ty Survey (BEEPS), 
a study on the po ten t ia l impac t o f AIDS, f iduc ia ry reports, po l icy notes, and sector reports. The 
Bank also launched a regular pub l ica t ion , the Russian Econom ic Report, wh ich made s ign i f ican t 
contributions to the po l icy dialogue and public debate in Russia. A Q A G assessment 
acknowledged the high qua l i ty o f the Bank ’s independent judgmen t and perspectives, and i t s 
success in b r ing ing g loba l know ledge to Russia. Acco rd ing to in terv iews w i t h clients, many 
changes in legislation, policies, design o f institutions, and prac t ica l measures re f lec ted the 
pos i t ive impac t o f Bank analysis, advice o r fac i l i ta t ion . Q A G rated the strategic relevance, 
in terna l quality, and dialogue and dissemination o f Bank AAA in Russia as h igh ly satisfactory. 

29. 
Portfolio management has improved. The Bank po r t fo l io as o f end-FY06 consists o f 
22 projects to ta l ing US$1 .9 b i l l i o n in ne t commitments. 
Impo r tan t steps were taken during the 
C A S pe r iod to imp rove po r t fo l io management and coordination, wh ich focused o n c los ing o lder 
projects and imp rov ing qua l i ty at entry and ex i t ( imp rov ing the “disconnect” on f i n a l pro jec t 
ratings). A Bank-Government Jo in t W o r k i n g G roup (JWG) now regu lar ly rev iews po r t fo l io and 
pro jec t performance, including proposed pro jec t extensions, and decides on actions t o address 
s ign i f ican t problems and accelerate implementation. A number o f po r t fo l io mon i to r ing too ls have 
been created to track imp lemen ta t ion o f “next steps” agreed in missions’ aide-memories fo r b o t h 
ongo ing projects and projects under preparation. M o s t recently an on- l ine procurement 
mon i to r ing system has been in troduced that rates projects based on the timeliness o f procurement 
steps under procurement packages. The Bank has strengthened supervision e f for ts through the 
fur ther decentralization o f operations, increasing commun ica t ion w i t h imp lemen t ing agencies, 
P IUs and relevant Government agencies. As a result, the share o f satisfactory pro jec ts has 
improved and curren t ly stands at 95 percent; w e l l above the 77 percent satisfactory ra t ing at the 
start o f the CAS . Project imp lemen ta t ion pace has p icked up and the disbursement ra t io 
improved f r om an average 11 percent over the last 6 years to 15.7 percent in FY06 . 

30. 
At the same time, portfolio management in Russia remains a challenging and 
management-intensive task. Projects o f ten requ ire leng thy Government consideration p r i o r t o 
approval and s t i l l take s ign i f ican t ly longer to imp lemen t in the Russian context - the average 
pro jec t age now stands at 4.8 years. Desp i te improvements, the disbursement pace tra i ls the 
Bank -w ide and E C A averages o f 24.0 and 17.1 percent respectively in FY06 . An ac t ion p lan fo r 
further strengthening po r t fo l io qua l i ty includes: re- focus ing the Bank-Governmen t J W G on 
outcomes and strategic decisions, including management o f c los ing dates; ho ld ing a strategic 
country po r t fo l io performance rev iew ; ho ld ing an annual rev iew o f pro jec t Imp lemen ta t ion Status 
Reports w i t h an emphasis on outcomes; mov ing further towards m in is try-based pro jec t 
imp lemen ta t ion f o r new projects that leaves PIUs on ly w i t h administrative and f iduc ia ry 
functions; and imp roved supervision practices. Further discussions are underway t o s imp l i fy the 
government grant approval procedure. O n i t s side, the Bank i s also comm i t ted t o con t inue i t s 
e f for ts in exped i t ing pro jec t preparation, decentralizing i t s operations, ra is ing t o the extent 
possible t h e f inanc ia l threshold per procurement methods and p r io r rev iew thresholds, and 
responding in an e f fec t ive way t o client’s needs. 

31. 
ZFC significantly increased its activities in Russia. IFC’s average comm i tmen t leve l 
f o r the CAS pe r iod reached U S $ 5 8 8 m i l l i o n pe r year, almost six t imes the FY00 -02 average. 
Russia i s now IFC’s largest coun try exposure, w i th a comm i t ted po r t fo l io o f almost US$2 b i l l i o n 

14 

as o f end-FYO6. Investments in f inanc ia l ins t i tu t ions represented b y far the largest share - about 
h a l f o f new commitments. This r e f l e c t s the objective stated in the prev ious C A S to increase 
effective f inanc ia l in termed ia t ion and opportunities fo r en try and g row th o f new f i r m s . In l ine 
w i t h the d ive rs i f ica t ion objectives o f the CAS , manu fac tur ing and services remained a s ign i f ican t 
area o f focus w i t h 26 percent o f new commitments. 
In infrastructure, transport became a 
significant new sector fo r I F C in Russia w i t h nine investments in pr iva te companies (a l l Russian- 
owned), operating in ra i l , sea, and a ir transport. The remainder o f new comm i tmen ts went to the 
o i l , chemical and mining sectors, agribusiness, and IT /med ia , and funds. 
In general, a 
s ign i f ican t ly increasing po r t ion o f IFC ’s f inanc ing went t o funding Russian-owned companies. 

32. 

ZFC continued providing technical assistance through the Moscow-based Private 
Enterprise Partnership ( P E P ) to promote the development of Russia’s private sector. Du r ing 

the CAS period, I F C completed a large program in corporate governance, through wh ich i t 
supported 2,000 companies in imp rov ing their corporate governance practices. O n the na t iona l 
level, the p rog ram worked w i t h Russia’s Federal Securities Comm iss ion to dra f t and disseminate 
Russia’s first na t iona l corporate governance code and w i t h the Russian Parliament on d i f feren t 
laws and regulations related t o corporate governance. This w o r k was done in coord ina t ion w i t h 
the Bank, OECD , and the G loba l Corporate Governance Forum . The p rog ram also sought to 
raise pub l ic awareness o f the importance o f good corporate governance and the pro tec t ion o f 
shareholders’ rights and wo rked w i t h educational ins t i tu t ions t o in troduce corporate governance 
topics in to law and management courses. 

33. 

The Foreign Investment Advisory Service (FZAS), a jo in t unit of ZFC and the World 
Bank, increased i t s specialized assistance in monitoring the investment climate of Russia.

35. 

A number of 
lessons emerge from the implementation of 
the previous CAS, with 
implications for design and implementation of the new strategy: (i) in v iew o f Russia’s large 

f isca l surplus, the Bank ’s value added i s no t in p rov id ing f inanc ia l support but rather in he lp ing 
Russia ga in access to g loba l know ledge and s k i l l s through ana ly t ica l and advisory support and 
through bringing together d i f fe ren t stakeholders and parts o f government in fo rg ing consensus on 
key po l icy issues; (ii) g iven Russia’s rap id ly changing environment, the Bank should continue to 
move towards a partnership approach w i t h a strong demand-orientation in design and de l ivery o f 
assistance and f lex ib i l i ty in adjusting the Bank ’s program and moda l i t ies o f assistance t o c l i e n t 
needs, mak ing full use o f the Bank ’s f lex ib le arrangements f o r w e l l pe r fo rm ing M I C s and 
spearheading new instruments o f assistance wh ich also draw on increased co l labora t ion w i t h I F C 
and MIGA; (iii) w i t h the g row ing gap between prosperous and lagg ing regions, the ma jo r 
challenge fo r the Bank i s to address the development challenges at the sub-national and reg iona l 

15 

levels; ( iv ) g iven Russia’s enormous size, measures t o increase the Bank ’s impac t through 
enhanced dissemination, outreach and sca l ing up w i l l be important; (v) recent progress in 
imp rov ing po r t fo l io qua l i ty and speeding up imp lemen ta t ion has been encouraging, but bo th the 
Bank and the Russian authorities w i l l need t o be d i l igen t in staying the course g iven Russia’s 
d i f f icu l t operating environment (bureaucracy, s low dec is ion making); (v i ) Russia w i l l continue to 
be a h i g h cost country in wh ich to operate, wh ich re f lec ts Russia’s size, the s ign i f ican t t ime taken 
t o build consensus on fu ture policies, and the slow pace o f government dec is ion-mak ing 
invo lv ing mu l t ip le rev iews o f new projects and delays in pro jec t implementation. At the same 
time, Government counterparts o f ten pre fer long - te rm B a n k engagement on projects to p ro long 
the use o f Bank s k i l l s on pro jec t management and techn ica l expertise; and (v i i ) decentralization 
has improved b o t h the qua l i ty and timeliness o f the Bank ’s wo rk in Russia and should be 
sustained in fu ture operations - par t icu lar ly as our w o r k in the Russian regions intensifies. 

The Rationale fo r Fu tu re Cooperation 

36. 

The World Bank Group’s current relations with Russia are unique. I t has been a 

partner t o Russia in i t s ga in ing a more prom inen t g loba l ro le as emerging donor and G-8 chair. 
The Bank has also been coord ina t ing and imp lemen t ing substantial donor programs in poorer 
regions and elsewhere in Russia. The reasons fo r the un ique and special relations l i e in b o t h the 
h is tory o f Bank-Russia engagement, and in Russia’s rap id ly changing economic cond i t ions and 
g row ing g loba l ro le . The Bank continues t o be v iewed b y the government as an impor tan t 
credible and neu tra l partner in economic development. The Bank Group’s programs in Russia, 
despite many challenges in implementation, en joy a high degree o f ownership. W h i l e the strong 
f isca l pos i t ion o f the federal government l im i t s i t s bo r row ing needs, the coun try ’s immense 
reg iona l d ivers i ty and rema in ing development challenges speak fo r the expedience o f ma in ta in ing 
cooperation w i t h the Bank in many areas. The Bank i s also un ique ly pos i t ioned t o fac i l i ta te 
Russia’s g row ing ro le in the donor commun i ty . As the p r iva te sector in Russia has expanded, so 
have the opportunities fo r constructive engagement b y IFC and MIGA. 

37. 

The rapidly evolving economic and political situation in Russia has necessitated a 

transition to new modalities of cooperation. N o longer needing external financing, the federal 
government i s demanding new and more d ive rs i f ied services in accordance w i t h i ts status as one 
o f the most sophisticated M I C c l i e n t s o f the Bank Group . The success w i t h wh ich the Bank and 
the Russian government can deepen relations on the basis o f new moda l i t ies o f opera t ion have 
significance no t on ly fo r the Russia program, but fo r the ove ra l l emerging strategy o f the Bank 
fo r wo rk in m idd le income countries. Russia i s an example o f a m idd le income coun try that has 
ma jo r significance fo r the entire E C A region, and can p rov ide many lessons o f value fo r 
developing and trans i t ion countries throughout the wo r ld . 

38. 
Relations between the World Bank and Russia are already in transition, and this 
transition w i l l continue throughout the CPS period. Consistent w i t h current trends in the 

Bank ’s operations in Russia, future relations w i l l be b u i l t p r ima r i ly upon (i) the Bank ’s 
independent “on-time” po l icy advice on impor tan t issues fac ing the country; (ii) assistance in 
management o f projects o r pub l ic investments in p r io r i ty areas w i thou t high lend ing amounts; 
(iii) continued strong levels o f f inanc ing t o the pr iva te sector, and increased f inanc ing to reg iona l 
governments w i thou t sovereign guarantees, and ( iv ) 
the development o f fee-for-service 
arrangements fo r the p rov is ion o f technical and ana ly t ica l wo rk . The strategy o f this CPS i s 
designed to support the comp le t ion o f the current transition. 

39 . 
The government recognizes that the World Bank has comparative advantages in 
many areas that have high relevance for Russia. During i ts 13 year h is tory o f engagement in 

Russia, the Bank has developed a s ign i f ican t capacity fo r bringing extensive know ledge and 
experience t o bear in the country. This includes ana ly t ica l wo rk that places the Russian 

16 

experience in international perspective, ins t i tu t iona l development in the pr iva te sector, pub l ic 
sector governance, and pro jec t management s k i l l s that rema in valuable in the country at a t ime 
when the government i tse l f i s just beg inn ing t o develop capacity fo r mu l t i -yea r pro jec t 
development, finance, and imp lemen ta t ion . As a source o f experience and knowledge, the W o r l d 
Bank engages in regular extensive mon i to r ing o f s truc tura l issues, and ho lds the most extensive 
databases on investment c l ima te issues, governance, and pr iva te-pub l ic partnerships. The Bank 
has enormous relevant experience in the design and imp lemen ta t ion o f infrastructure projects, and 
in bu i ld ing governance and budge t ing capacity at the central and subnational levels o f 
government. F ina l ly , the Bank p lays a lead ing ro le wo r ldw ide in the donor commun i ty , as w e l l 
as in addressing g loba l challenges as c l ima te change, b iod ivers i ty , and in fec t ious diseases. 
Annex 3 describes the Bank’s comparative advantages in more detail. 

Principles o f Engagement and Modalities o f Cooperation 

40. 
Bank support w i l l be demand-driven and f lex ib le within a strategic framework that 
reflects the government’s medium-term program, and also builds on the Bank’s agenda for 
well-performing MZCs.’ Accord ing ly , key pr inc ip les that w i l l d r ive the or ien ta t ion o f Bank 
programs in Russia over the com ing years are: (i) a strong demand or ien ta t ion and f lex ib i l i ty o f 
the Bank program in response t o Russia’s evo lv ing needs; (ii) support fo r p r io r i ty ac t iv i t ies 
addressing Russia’s key development challenges in accordance w i t h the CPS strategic 
framework; (iii) use o f the comparative advantages o f the three parts o f the W o r l d Bank G roup 
(IBRD, I F C and MIGA), wh i le fur ther increasing the ir collaboration; ( iv ) support fo r systemic 
solutions w i t h las t ing impac t on ins t i tu t iona l capacity and po ten t ia l fo r scaling up; (v) ba lanc ing 
federal leve l cooperation w i t h selective, but increasingly deep, engagement w i t h a sma l l group o f 
Russian regions and mun ic ipa l i t ies ; (v i ) leveraging scarce Bank resources w i t h Russia’s ow n 
budgetary resources, pa r t icu la r ly as Bank lending volumes decrease; and (v i i ) e f fec t ive 
partnerships w i t h Russian ins t i tu t ions , inc lud ing the p r iva te sector, think-tanks and c i v i l society 
organizations, as w e l l as w i t h external partners (EBRD, OECD , the UN system, and b i la te ra l 
donors w i t h active programs in Russia). The Bank ’s lend ing and non- lend ing ac t iv i t ies w i l l be 
assessed as par t o f an annual consu l ta t ion process w i t h government in the context o f 
government’s budget fo rmu la t ion process wh ich also se ts out Russia’s bo r row ing p rog ram f o r the 
com ing year. Selection o f ac t iv i t ies fo r Bank support w i l l be guided b y government’s demand fo r 
Bank services, the above key pr inc ip les fo r Bank engagement, and the Bank ’s capacity t o respond 
to new assistance demands. 

41. 
The current dynamics of the Bank’s program is characterized by a gradual shift 
towards new modalities of operation and instruments. W i thou t in t roduc t ion o f such new 
modalities and instruments, g iven Russia’s ample f isca l surpluses, future Bank lending, wou ld be 
h igh ly limited. At the same time, a p rog ram based on deve lop ing new moda l i t ies o f cooperation 
as envisaged in the CPS can expand and compensate fo r a shr ink ing trad i t iona l core program. As 
the Bank and the Government wo rk towards reso lv ing i s s u e s curren t ly imped ing w ide r 
app l ica t ion o f proposed new instruments as discussed be low , the Bank p rog ram in Russia wou ld 
evolve in to an “expanded” scenario. 
In this scenario, the Bank p rog ram wou ld be shifting 
towards greater use o f “new instruments”, wh ich in turn cou ld f o rm the new core o f Bank 
activities in the post-CPS per iod . Thus, the CPS o f fers a f lex ib le , yet cautious approach fo r Bank 
operations, ma in ly focus ing on trad i t iona l instruments fo r a core program o f ac t iv i t ies in l i n e w i t h 
the planned available resource envelope fo r Russia, wh i le inves t ing l im i t e d resources in to 
developing new areas o f cooperation under the new instruments. 

* 1 The CPS supports the ma jo r tenets o f the Bank ’s recen t ly approved strategy fo r engagement w i t h M i d d l e 
Income Countries en t i t led “Strengthening the W o r l d Bank ’s Engagement w i t h IBRD Partner Countries”, 
September 2006. 

17 

42. 
The I B R D program for the period of the CPS can be viewed as a combination of 
certain (shrinking) core activities that would be maintained even under a “low case” scenario 
of engagement, and expanded activities that depend on new business opportunities and 
modalities. The degree to wh ich new bus iness opportunities substitute fo r trad i t iona l lending to 
the federal government over the pe r iod o f the CPS w i l l depend on the po l i t ica l and economic 
environment in the country. 
In the event that this env ironmen t w i l l be less conducive than 
expected to the creation and expansion o f new moda l i t ies o f operation, core ac t iv i t ies w i l l shrink 
over the pe r iod o f the CPS, and the post-CPS ro le o f the IBRD cou ld be reduced p r ima r i ly to 
servicing Russia as an emerg ing donor and shareholder; At the same time, I F C and MIGA w i l l 
continue their s ign i f ican t engagement in support o f the p r iva te sector and fo re ign investment. 

43. 
The CPS builds on the important adjustments already made to the Bank’s program 
in Russia to facilitate a fu l l transition to new modalities of operation. Recent projects w i t h the 
federal government have invo lved a h igher share o f Government f inanc ing (e.g. Hydrome t , 
Cadastre), wh i le other such projects are in preparation. Bank ac t iv i t ies have been mov ing 
increasingly to the reg iona l leve l . The Bank has begun a special p rog ram o f assistance to the 
Southern Federal Okrug. The focus o f much o f the Bank ’s TA and AAA work , inc lud ing the 
Country Econom ic Memorandum, has sh i f ted t o the reg iona l and loca l levels. The f i r s t sub- 
na t iona l pro jec t w i thou t a sovereign guarantee, developed in cooperation between I F C and the 
Bank, was recently approved f o r the Chuvashia Repub l ic . A fee-for-service TA assignment fo r a 
PPP h ighway pro jec t was imp lemen ted w i t h the c i ty o f Saint Petersburg. A special AAA 
Adv isory Counc i l was created in 2005, consisting o f the leaders o f prom inen t Moscow and Saint 
Petersburg think tanks. This Counc i l gives advice on, and c r i t ica l evaluations of, the Banks AAA 
work, and facilitates the establishment o f j o i n t projects. The Bank has conducted a s ign i f ican t 
restructuring o f i t s Moscow o f f ice , including a realignment o f s k i l l s , fur ther decentralization o f 
decision-making, enhanced mu l t i-sec tora l cooperation, and the in t roduc t ion o f an internship 
program fo r graduate students f r om Russian universities. T o support i t s enlarged program, I F C 
has increased capacity in the field to imp rove c l ien t responsiveness and has organized the 
Moscow o f f ice along sectoral l i n e s to ensure a comprehensive v iew on each sector o f interest. 

44. 
Focused engagement in selected regions and high eo-financing in federal projects 
also provide opportunities for scaling up and maximizing the impact of the Bank’s resources. 
Successful cooperation at the reg iona l leve l though integrated programs that includes general 
analysis, diagnostics, and operations wou ld prov ide models that can be expanded to other regions 
at a later date, w i th or w i thou t the d irec t par t ic ipa t ion o f the Bank . In some areas the assistance 
that the Bank can o f fe r the regions already represents a scaling up o f lessons and experience o f 
Bank cooperation at the federal leve l . A lso , h i g h co- f inanc ing o f federal projects a l lows fo r their 
expansion beyond what Bank resources alone wou ld de l iver . Recently, the government has 
increased i t s co- f inanc ing o f a number o f on-go ing projects as a means o f scaling up the project’s 
scope o r range. 

45. 
The Bank’s AAA work aims to ensure continued capacity to contribute to important 
policy debates in the country, both in regards to domestic issues and Russia’s global role. The 
Bank has successfully served as a depository o f in terna t iona l experience f o r the highest leve l o f 
government on various issues. The government has p ro f i ted f r om ana ly t ica l wo rk in many areas, 
and has referred t o the Bank f o r advice ( in , the f o rm o f bo th in-depth diagnostic reports and b r ie f 
notes) on i s s u e s rang ing f r o m imp l ica t ions o f various tax policies, establishment o f domestic 
development institutions, and arrangements f o r donor funding. P rov id ing h i g h qua l i ty advisory 
services w i l l be essential t o the Bank ’s value to Russia in a time when the government and 
Russian think tanks are demanding more specific and nuanced in terna t iona l expertise. As such 
inquiries are expected to continue, the Bank aims to ma in ta in a minimum p rog ram o f core 
diagnostic AAA along the l ines o f economic mon i to r ing (Russian economic report, pover ty work, 
strategic sector dialogue), and advisory services in low - income regions t o the extent possible. 

18 

Reg iona l AAA i s expected in deve lop ing reg iona l strategies and loca l investment c l ima te 
assessments, especially fo r regions where the Bank Group may be expanding i t s lending services. 
In the interest o f strengthening government capacity, “staff secondment” arrangements to engage 
Russian experts more ac t ive ly in the Bank ’s w o r k in other c l ien t countries and in terna t iona l 
events are envisaged. In addition, WB I w i l l continue to support B a n k w o r k w i t h specific capacity 
building ac t iv i t ies in the regions (see below). 

46. 
As in other well-performing MICs, AAA work i s expected to move increasingly 
towards reimbursable fee-for-service arrangements. T o con t inue de l ivery o f a comprehensive 
ana ly t ica l and advisory program, the B a n k w i l l wo rk w i t h federal and reg iona l authorities in 
mov ing towards a more streamlined approach in deve lop ing such fee-for-service arrangements 
a long the lines o f developments in other we l l -pe r fo rm ing M ICs , inc lud ing the signing o f a 
framework agreement between the Bank and government that wou ld inc lude pr inc ip les o f cost 
recovery. Under this instrument, the Bank reaches agreement w i th a non-commerc ia l en t i ty t o 
de l iver ana ly t ica l wo rk on a fee-for-service basis. The assistance wou ld inc lude know ledge 
transfer in the in te res t o f developing loca l capacity. The Bank wou ld on ly o f fe r such services i f 
the requested expertise i s no t available in the market. A large par t o f reimbursable TA p rov ided 
b y the Bank in various countries has invo lved consultative services fo r large-scale infrastructure 
investments, especially those based on pr iva te-pub l ic partnerships. The f i r s t such experience in 
Russia was w i t h the C i ty o f S t . Petersburg f o r construction o f the high-speed diameter ring-road. 
I n i t i a l discussions w i t h various regions suggest interest in other types o f wo rk in add i t ion t o 
pub l ic 
investment projects, 
including diagnostics o f reg iona l g row th and economic 
competitiveness, investment c l ima te mon i to r ing and benchmarking, re forms in the social sector, 
and asset management services. The scope o f the Bank ’s “reimbursable TA ” program in Russia 
cou ld reach about U S $ 1 m i l l i o n per year towards the second h a l f o f the CPS period. 

47. 
Along the same lines, the Bank and the government are developing an instrument to 
allow the application of the Bank’s project design and management skills to federal projects 
without Bank lending. W h i l e projects in the current pipeline are be ing developed w i t h a high 
share o f f inanc ing by the Russian government, even this approach has impor tan t drawbacks in the 
current Russian po l i t ica l context in the light o f huge f isca l surp luses . G iven the Government’s 
interest in tapp ing the Bank‘s s k i l l s in pro jec t design and management, a new ins trumen t i s be ing 
j o i n t l y considered that wou ld p rov ide such s k i l l s fo r government f inanced programs and projects 
on a fee-for-service basis. 
I t wou ld a l low Bank advisory support in a larger number o f 
government programs - either at the federal leve l or in regions on the basis o f federal funding. 
Such instrument must accommodate the Bank ’s f iduc ia ry po l ic ies and preempt possible 
repu ta t ion risks. 
In general the Bank and the government w i l l continue discussions f o r 
deve lop ing add i t iona l instruments that can bo th exp lo i t the Bank ’s experience and know ledge 
w i thou t much reliance on federal borrow ing . 

48. 

The World Bank Group intends to maintain current levels of finance for the private 
sector and expand regional lending without sovereign guarantees. 
I F C and MIGA w i l l 
ma in ta in strong support fo r p r iva te sector development b y focus ing on p r io r i ty areas a l igned w i t h 
overa l l Bank Group strategy, in par t icu lar investments in f inanc ia l institutions, infrastructure, and 
services and produc t ion where Russia has a compe t i t ive advantage, o r where investment w i l l 
contribute t o the d ivers i f ica t ion o f the economy. I F C w i l l continue to emphasize the development 
o f good corporate governance in i t investments, and an increasing area o f focus in bo th 
investment and advisory wo rk w i l l be env ironmen ta l sustainability. 
In addition, i t i s expected 
that the new j o i n t IFC /Bank Sub-Na t iona l Development Program w i l l finance 1-3 projects (about 
US$25-100 m i l l ion ) per year in support o f ma in ly infrastructure investments in cred i twor thy 
regions and pub l ic u t i l i t ies . Care wou ld be taken that such sub-national projects are in l ine w i t h 
federal p r io r i t ies and f isca l considerations, and based on p r io r consultations w i t h federal 

19 

authorities fo r each such proposed transaction. B o x 3 prov ides fur ther details on the IFC /Bank 
Sub-National Development Program. 

Box 3: The Joint IFC/Bank Sub-National Development Program 

The j o i n t IFC /Bank Sub-Na t iona l Deve lopmen t Program o f fers a new f inanc ia l instrument: sub-national 
loans w i thou t sovereign guarantees. The B a n k G roup responded t o the demand fo r such new sub-national 
f inanc ia l products in 2003 b y establishing a M u n i c i p a l Fund w i t h i n I FC . 
I n June 2006, the Bank ’s 
Execu t ive D i rec to r approved a Jo in t I F C B a n k Sub-Na t iona l Deve lopmen t P rog ram that builds o n the 
experience o f the M u n i c i p a l Fund and s im i la r in i t ia t ives o f other IFIs. The P rog ram taps i n t o the 
comparative advantages o f IBRD in suppor t ing re forms o f l o c a l government, u t i l i t ies , inves tmen t planning, 
and pub l ic expenditure management, and IFC ’s experience in manag ing a diverse set o f f inanc ia l 
instruments and investment operations. Thus, the Program prov ides techn ica l assistance fo r f inanc ia l 
management, support o f reforms, p u b l i c inves tmen t through p r o v i s i o n o f guarantees, loans, or equ i ty 
finance, ma in ly in loca l currency. The P rog ram has been approved f o r a three-year p i l o t per iod , co inc id ing 
w i t h the CPS, w i t h comm i tmen ts o f US $ 8 0 0 m i l l i o n f o r f inanc ing and US $ 6 m i l l i o n f o r technical 
assistance. The Program i s t o b e managed j o i n t l y b y the IBRD and I FC . A f i r s t sub-national opera t ion in 
Russia has been approved, and a number o f other proposals f r om regions are curren t ly under discussion. I t 
i s expected that lend ing f r om the P rog ram in Russia w i l l amount to about US$25-100 m i l l i o n per year 
du r ing the CPS period. The highest demand f o r sub-national f inanc ing w o u l d be f o r cap i ta l investments in 
mun ic ipa l or ru ra l in fras truc ture and u t i l i t ies , w i t h some regions interested in other sectors, such as tou r ism 
o r forestry. 

49. 
The administration of grants and development of 
the carbon market could also 
become important parts of the Bank’s activities in Russia, p rov ided processing at the federal 
leve l can be accelerated. With the in t roduc t ion o f the GEF Resource A l loca t ion Framework in 
2006, Russia cou ld access a coun try a l loca t ion o f about US$50 m i l l i o n in the c l ima te change 
foca l area and US$ lO -20 m i l l i o n in the b iod ivers i ty foca l area du r ing the 2006-2010 GEF 
replenishment period, as w e l l as add i t iona l funds fo r other areas. The Bank ’s Pos t-Con f l ic t Grant 
Fac i l i ty also offers development opportunities to con f l ic t-a f fec ted terr i tor ies (e.g. the No r the rn 
Caucasuses). Federal processing o f such grants has been slow, and w i l l requ ire more e f f ic ien t 
procedures fo r preparation, approval, and mon i to r ing o f grants at the na t iona l leve l , a long w i t h 
mechanisms fo r j o i n t imp lemen ta t ion and supervision o f grants b y federal and reg iona l 
authorities. Russia has s ign i f ican t po ten t ia l opportunities fo r tapping in to the carbon market, bo th 
in the use o f i t s ex is t ing carbon a l loca t ion and through a “green investment scheme” fo r 
expanding i t s allocation. Lend ing to regions and the pr iva te sector cou ld be comb ined w i t h 
carbon finance revenues, wh ich wou ld make Bank f inanc ing even more attractive and p rov ide 
incentives fo r the adoption o f low -ca rbon technologies f o r increasing energy e f f ic iency . 

Bank Instruments by Clients 

50. 
There are four main “constituency” groups for Bank assistance in Russia: (i) the 
federal government, sectoral m in is tr ies and agencies, wh ich value the Bank ’s ove ra l l assistance, 
inc lud ing that in g loba l affairs and the support o f Russia’s expanding donor role; as w e l l as the 
Bank ’s sectoral know ledge b o t h in regards to fo rmu la t ion o f impor tan t po l ic ies and 
implementation o f long te rm public investment programs; (ii) reg iona l governments, wh ich want 
to cooperate w i t h the Bank on b o t h deve lop ing their re fo rm agendas and accessing the Bank ’s 
f inanc ing products; (iii) the p r iva te sector, wh ich receives f inanc ia l and techn ica l assistance f r om 
I F C and guarantees f r om MIGA fo r expanding operations in Russia and abroad; and ( iv ) Russian 
think tanks, experts, and NGO commun i ty , wh ich h igh ly value the Bank ’s independent op in ion 
on important po l icy and r e f o rm processes in the country, and access the Bank ’s in terna t iona l 
knowledge and experience. The Bank ’s p rog ram over the CPS pe r iod w i l l seek to address key

52. 
The World Bank Group’s program for the coming years will be guided by the 
priorities of Russia’s medium-term program, and be directed at areas where the Bank’s 
comparative advantages can help in addressing Russia’s outstanding development challenges. 
Accord ing ly , the strategic p r io r i t ies fo r the CPS correspond closely t o the p i l la rs o f the previous 
CAS in supporting Russia’s ove ra l l goa l o f imp rov ing the w e l l be ing o f i t s popu la t ion and 
decreasing poverty, wh ich w i l l be rea l ized p r ima r i ly through dynam ic and sustained economic

W o r l d Bank Group ac t iv i t ies in Russia over the com ing three years w i l l be d irec ted t o achieve 
progress in four areas: (i) sustaining rap id g row th ( inc lud ing d ivers i f ica t ion) (ii) imp rov ing public 
sector management and governance; (iii) imp rov ing the de l ivery o f social and communal 
services, and ( iv ) enhancing Russia’s g loba l ro le . The W o r l d Bank Group ’s invo lvemen t in a l l o f 
these areas wou ld correspond to i t s specific comparative advantages, as no ted above (also see 
Annex 3). 

53. 
Given the need for significant flexibility in Bank cooperation in Russia, the Country 
Partnership Strategy outlines a broad menu of activities that may become focal points of the 
program during 2006-2009 at both the federal and sub-national l e v e l s . N o t a l l o f these 
ac t iv i t ies or operations w i l l l i k e l y be implemented du r ing the CPS period. The actual program 
w i l l depend on how demand f o r and supply o f Bank s k i l l s and services correlate, as w e l l as on

Sustaining Rapid Growth 

54 . 

The World Bank Group w i l l assist Russia in various ways in meeting the challenges 
of sustaining rapid growth. This includes active pa r t ic ipa t ion in macro-po l icy debates, 
mon i to r ing the investment climate, supporting pub l ic investment and PPPs fo r g row th and 
d ivers i f ica t ion , wo rk ing w i t h regions t o iden t i fy and overcome barriers to growth, supporting 
investments in p r io r i ty areas at the reg iona l level, and p rov id ing d irec t assistance t o the pr iva te 
sector: 

Macroeconomic policy and the effective management of Russia’s large external 
inflows: The Bank w i l l con tr ibu te to the macro-po l icy debate in Russia through the 
Russian Econom ic Report, on-demand po l icy notes and know ledge sharing. Adv iso ry 
services can inc lude tra in ing and impac t mon i to r ing ac t iv i t ies re la ted t o W T O accession. 
In addition, there i s strong interest in the Bank ’s technical assistance in adv is ing on 
alternative uses fo r the w ind fa l l o i l revenues, including the development o f an 
ins t i tu t iona l framework fo r the e f fec t ive management o f a g row ing d ive rs i f ied po r t fo l io 
o f fo re ign assets. The W o r l d Bank Treasury has experience and expertise that can be 
valuable t o Russia in this area and has held i n i t i a l discussions w i t h the authorities on 
possible support. 

Investment climate monitoring and policy advice: The Bank w i l l continue per iod ic 
BEEPS surveys, reg iona l investment c l ima te assessments, and adm in is tra t ive barriers 
s tud ies undertaken b y FIAS fo r interested regions. The Bank and MIGA can wo rk at the 
reg iona l leve l on capacity building and the development o f investment p romo t ion 
programs f o r attracting FDI, s im i lar to the in i t ia t ive curren t ly underway in Ros tov 
Region. WB I w i l l continue capac i ty-bu i ld ing ac t iv i t ies re la ted t o investment c l ima te 
assessments. 

Supporting Government investment and PPPs for growth and diversification: T w o 
separate projects in support o f deve lop ing Special Econom ic Zones and I T Parks (bo th in 
FY07) have the goal o f p romo t ing the d ivers i f ica t ion and the agglomeration o f economic 
ac t iv i t ies in Russia. A m icro f inance infrastructure development pro jec t (FY08) focuses 
on f inanc ia l cooperatives and their in tegra t ion i n t o the f inanc ia l system o f the country. 
On-go ing investment projects support land reg is tra t ion and the development o f a na t iona l 
cadastre fo r securing proper ty rights and the development o f land markets. Possible 
pa r t ia l risk guarantees o f the Bank t o the power sector cou ld he lp attract investment to the 
e lec tr ic i ty sector fo r modern iza t ion and substantial increases in capacity. And another 
pa r t ia l risk guarantee instrument may be used to support the cons truc t ion o f an a lum inum 
complex (SUAL) in Russia’s K o m i Republic, possibly alongside an I F C investment in 
the a lum inum comp lex . Other areas fo r possible IBRD projects relevant to sustaining 
rap id g row th include support f o r science and technology development, modern iza t ion o f 
the chem ica l sector, and forestry. In addition, regular and reimbursable TAs w i l l support 
development o f PPPs across sectors. 

Working with regions to identifv engines of growth, develop growth strategies, and 
remove barriers to growth: The Bank w i l l continue thematic Coun try Econom ic 
Memo randum focused o n re l iev ing barriers t o g row th at the subnational leve l and on 
questions o f reg iona l agglomerations. The development o f fee-for-service arrangements 
w i t h the regions wou ld p rov ide another p rom is ing avenue fo r supporting preparation o f 

24 

reg iona l investment strategies and g row th analyses, and p rov is ion o f other ana ly t ica l 
services. 

Supporting investments in priority areas at the regional level: The I F C B a n k Sub- 
Na t iona l Development Program w i l l support impor tan t reg iona l pub l ic investments. The 
government i s par t icu lar ly keen on deve lop ing this f inanc ing mechanism further, as i t 
invo lves direct lending to we l l -pe r fo rm ing reg ions and mun ic ipa l i t ies w i thou t sovereign 
guarantees. One t o three such sub-national operations per year are contemplated over the 
CPS. 
In fras truc ture i s also an impor tan t area o f I F C investments. 
This concerns 
p r ima r i ly transport and logistics, but also includes mun ic ipa l infrastructure. MIGA can 
p lay a ro le in supporting fore ign d irec t investment in infrastructure at the sub-sovereign 
level, inc lud ing in the water and so l id waste sectors. 

Providing direct support to the private sector: I F C w i l l continue t o support Russia’s 
pr iva te sector g row th agenda through a comb ina t ion o f f inanc ia l and advisory services t o 
promote the g row th o f the pr iva te sector and the d ivers i f ica t ion o f the Russian economy. 
I F C w i l l finance projects (1) w i t h impor tan t sp i l l-over effects to other companies, such as 
infrastructure and f inanc ia l markets, ( 2 ) in sectors where Russia may have a comparative 
advantage, fo r example the processing o f na tura l resources and those that promo te the 
know ledge economy, and (3) those increas ing the range and qua l i ty o f products and 
services available in the Russian market, par t icu lar ly outside o f Moscow . 
I F C w i l l 
increasingly look fo r opportunities t o par t ic ipa te in equity f inanc ing . In the rea l sector - - 
inc lud ing infrastructure, extractive industries, manufacturing, high-tech, media./IT, and 
agribusiness -- I F C w i l l continue to support m id-s ized loca l companies w i thou t other 
access to long - te rm financing. Even w i t h larger corporates, I F C has a ro le in selected 
projects where there are key env ironmen ta l and social i s s u e s and scope t o imp rove 
corporate governance practices. M u c h o f IFC ’ s ac t iv i t ies w i l l rema in concentrated in the 
f inanc ia l sector, where pr ior i t ies w i l l be: 

bu i ld ing long - te rm relationships w i t h medium-sized independent p r iva te reg iona l 
banks, so as to increase compe t i t ion and the range o f services available to the 
population. I F C financing, p rov ided in the f o rm o f long - te rm senior loans and, in 
selected cases, subordinated loans, w i l l help to strengthen the banks’ balance 
sheets, reach new clients ( inc lud ing SMEs), attract more depositors, and 
consolidate their pos i t ion as lead ing reg iona l banks; 
supporting the in t roduc t ion o f specialized bank ing products, inc lud ing mortgage 
financing, consumer finance and leasing; 
supporting the process o f p r iva t iza t ion o f state-owned banks, as and when 
requested by the Russian Government; and 
supporting development and use o f new f inanc ia l instruments, such as pa r t ia l 
guarantees o f loca l currency bonds and securitization. 

Continuing I F C advisory work through the Private Enterprise Partnership and F I A S : 
This technical assistance w i l l address the f o l l ow i n g objectives: (a) increasing the 
development impac t o f investments through strengthening loca l suppliers and engaging in 
commun i ty development wo rk around large investments; (b) building the capacity o f 
pr iva te banks t o deliver new produc t lines, such as mortgage f inance and f inanc ing f o r 
energy e f f ic iency ; and 
imp rov ing corporate governance and env ironmen ta l 
sustainability through wo rk w i t h banks and rea l sector clients, inc lud ing I F C investees. 
FIAS w i l l continue to wo rk w i t h select regions to improve the business c l ima te b y 
assisting in imp lemen ta t ion o f policies/instruments to k ick-s tar t func t ion ing markets o f 
land and commerc ia l rea l estate. Other opportunities fo r FIAS t o support improvemen ts 
in the business climate include: mainstreaming D o i n g Business ind ica tors in Russia on

basis in be t te r -o f f Russia’s regions; and imp lemen t ing market-based Corporate Social 
Respons ib i l i ty ac t iv i t ies in sectors o f g loba l importance (e.g., p romo t ing sustainable 
forest management b y assisting in in t roduc t ion o f vo lun tary ce r t i f ica t ion schemes). 

MZGA w i l l continue to support foreign investors through the provision of political risk 
guarantees: Suppor t ing fo re ign investment in infrastructure, in close coord ina t ion w i t h 
the Bank, w i l l rema in an impor tan t area o f MIGA’s ac t iv i ty in Russia. In the f inanc ia l 
sector, the Agency w i l l continue to exp lore opportunities t o support cap i ta l markets 
transactions, inc lud ing asset-backed securitizations. MIGA may also continue to promote 
the ro le and assist in the expansion o f fore ign banks in the Russian bank ing sector. Areas 
f o r po ten t ia l fur ther invo lvemen t in Russia inc lude the manufacturing, agribusiness and 
services sectors. 

Improving Public Sector Management and Performance 

55 . 
Public sector management has been a particular area of strength of World Bank 
work in Russia, which will be further deepened in coming years. The Bank w i l l rema in 
engaged in supporting programs f o r modern iz ing selected pub l ic sector ins t i tu t ions , imp rov ing 
government administration, the jud ic ia ry , loca l self-government, and budgetary management at 
federal and sub-national levels. The Bank w i l l expand i t s engagement in regions in these areas, in 
accordance w i t h the federal p r io r i ty fo r imp rov ing pub l ic sector performance at the subnational 
level. 

Modernizing selected public sector institutions: The comp le t ion o f on-go ing projects, 
together w i t h a new pro jec t in the pipeline, w i l l contribute to the modern iza t ion o f pub l ic 
ins t i tu t ions and imp roved public services. These inc lude tax modernization, customs 
development, cadastre and registration, f isca l federalism, performance-based budgeting, 
treasury development, and a statistical development pro jec t (FY08). 

Supporting the government program in administrative reform: The B a n k w i l l continue 
i t s close engagement w i t h the government in the area o f adm in is tra t ive re fo rm at the 
federal and subnational levels, inc lud ing the coord ina t ion and imp lemen ta t ion o f 
substantial donor funds. The p r ima ry goa l w i l l continue to be bringing Bank and 
in terna t iona l expertise t o bear on the imp lemen ta t ion o f the government’s p rog ram f o r 
administrative reform, wh ich curren t ly places a strong emphasis on encouraging 
in i t ia t ives at the subnational leve l . So far, the Bank has concentrated subnational w o r k in 
the Southern Federal Okrug and regions in the Nor th-Wes t . A possible pro jec t cou ld be 
also developed to promote administrative re fo rm in lagg ing regions. 

0 Stepping up engagement on jud ic ia l reform: Assistance on jud ic ia l r e f o rm also invo lves 
the coord ina t ion o f donor funds and special cooperation at the reg iona l leve l . A new 
project i s curren t ly under development fo r jud ic ia l re fo rm (FY07) w i t h a focus on 
imp rov ing dispute resolution, the enforcement o f laws, and the transparency o f 
in fo rma t ion 

Support for budgetary reforms: The Bank w i l l continue to respond t o the demands o f 
the federal and some reg iona l governments f o r assistance in budgetary r e f o rm and the 
development o f performance-based budgeting. 
In addition, the B a n k w i l l rema in a 
partner t o the government in the continued scaling up o f the F isca l Federa l ism Project 
(now financed by the Russian government) and i t s expansion t o the mun ic ipa l leve l . 

26 

Supporting the reform of local self-government: The Bank w i l l continue i t s dialogue 
w i t h the government in this area, and in b r in ing in terna t iona l experience to bear o n this 
v i ta l area o f re fo rm in Russia. A study has been launched f o r mon i to r ing and assisting 
the development o f loca l-se l f government in ru ra l areas in the Perm, Penza, and Adygeya 
regions. The Bank w i l l seek to engage d i rec t ly w i t h reg ions and mun ic ipa l i t ies in this 
area on the basis o f new modalities, including a discussion o f rep l ica t ing the pos i t ive 
experience o f the F isca l Federalism Pro jec t mode l f o r building capacity at the mun ic ipa l 
leve l . 

Investments in municipal development: On -go ing and possible fu ture reg iona l projects 
have significance fo r overa l l mun ic ipa l development and the qua l i ty o f mun ic ipa l 
services. This includes the current Kazan and Saint Petersburg mun ic ipa l development 
projects, a hous ing and communa l services pro jec t under preparation (FY07 , also see 
below), and possible reg iona l projects on water and hea t ing system upgrades. 

Supporting anti-corruption initiatives: As a coherent na t iona l- leve l an t i-corrup t ion 
program may beg in to take shape, the Bank w i l l exp lore avenues o f possible constructive 
con tr ibu t ions t o such an t i-corrup t ion in i t ia t ives . 

Improving the Delivery of Social and Communal Services 

56. 
In add i t ion to continued general cooperation w i t h the federal government, the Bank 
w i l l concentrate much o f i t s support f o r imp rov ing social service de l ive ry at the subnational leve l . 
As no ted above, the Government has p r io r i t ized the soc ia l sector and social services in i t s 
med ium- term program. G iven that the p r ima ry respons ib i l i t ies and in i t ia t ives fo r r e f o rm in the 
area o f social and communa l services w i l l be at the subnational level, the Bank w i l l concentrate 
i t s focus on the regions. M a i n ac t iv i t ies inc lude the con t inua t ion o f wo rk in the areas o f poverty, 
education, and hea l th in cooperation w i t h the regions. Add i t iona l ac t iv i t ies inc lude the 
mon i to r ing o f social trends and service de l ivery qua l i ty (joint w i t h USAID) and special 
employment-related ac t iv i t ies in the Southern Federal Okrug (the development o f decentralized 
employment services, and labor in tegra t ion o f youth). Ano ther c r i t ica l area fo r imp rov ing l i v i n g 
standards i s p rov is ion o f hous ing and communa l services. The government places h i g h 
importance on imp rov ing the performance o f the hous ing and communa l services (HCS) sector 
and on the de l ivery o f high qua l i ty services b y communa l enterprises, and closely links service 
p rov is ion w i t h imp rov ing the qua l i ty o f l i fe . In this context, modern iza t ion and re fo rm ing o f 
HCS was inc luded in the recently approved Med ium -Te rm Government Program f o r 2006-2008. 

Continuation of the poverty work: In add i t ion to con t inued cooperation w i t h Rosstat and 
federal m i n i s t r i e s , the emphasis o f the Bank pover ty wo rk (in cooperation w i t h DFID) 
has moved t o the reg iona l leve l . The Bank i s work ing , and w i l l continue to work ,

K a lm y k i a and three other regions w i l l be developed w i t h Bank assistance. Successful 
models o f cooperation can be scaled up to s im i lar regions. 

Zmproving the health of the population: The Bank w i l l continue i t s engagement w i t h

Enhancing Russia’s Global Role 

57. 
The Bank has a strong commitment to support Russia’s increasing global role, and 
assist the country in fu lf i l l ing its global commitments. The Bank w i l l con t inue cooperation w i t h 
the Russian government in support o f i t s emergence as an in terna t iona l donor and active member 
o f mu l t i la te ra l organizations. In addition, the Bank w i l l assist in establishment o f mechanisms and 
imp lemen ta t ion o f specific actions ar is ing f r o m Russia’s g loba l engagements, such as the C l ima te 
Change 
and 
B iod ive rs i ty 
Conventions, 
and 
pandemic 
diseases 
in i t ia t ives . 
D u r i n g the CPS period, the Bank w i l l also seek t o share w i t h Russian experts i t s analysis (and 
advocacy) that i s currently directed towards the trad i t iona l D A C donors. Specific areas fo r 
Bank ’s engagement in Russia are: 

Assistance i n the formulation of an O D A strategy for Russia as emerging donor: The 
Bank w i l l continue t o assist Russia as an emerging donor, and w i l l cooperate o n the design 
o f Russia’s development a id strategy and the establishment o f a na t iona l O D A system. 
Specific Bank support includes tra in ingbapac i ty events, in fo rma t ion sharing, and advisory 
services. The Bank w i l l rema in engaged w i t h Russia on in terna t iona l po l icy in i t ia t ives 
developed under Russia’s G-8 presidency, including on Russia’a p r io r i ty themes fo r 
in terna t iona l assistance - qua l i ty o f education, energy pover ty , and the spread o f in fec t ious 
diseases. 

Providing access to the Bank’s instruments for channeling Russian developmental 
assistance: The Bank w i l l he lp in arranging an A f r i c a debt-for-development swap, the 
establishment o f an A v i a n Flu Trust Fund, the imp lemen ta t ion o f the Educa t ion Fo r 
A l l E a s t Track In i t ia t ives and Russia’s par t ic ipa t ion in the G loba l V i l lage Energy 
Partnership. I t w i l l also fac i l i ta te expanding Russia’s ro le in IDA. Beg inn ing w i t h a h igh - 
leve l Eme rg ing Dono r Mee t ing in April 2006, the Bank i s assisting Russia in organ iz ing 
development a id seminars and in terna t iona l events. The Bank w i l l also seek opportunities 
fo r increased engagement o f Russian experts in development po l icy debates, their 
par t ic ipa t ion in the Bank ’s w o r k in other countries, and “staff secondments” fo r bu i ld ing 
capacity w i t h i n the Russian Government fo r a id a l loca t ion and management. 

Fu lf i l l ing international obligations related to global goods: The Bank w i l l assist Russia 
in developing procedures and mechanisms fo r imp lemen t ing specific ac t iv i t ies in the 
framework o f the C l ima te Change and B iod ive rs i ty Conventions. TA i s curren t ly be ing 
prov ided on the in t roduc t ion o f low -ca rbon technologies and c l ima te change m i t iga t ion . I f 
the government moves ahead w i t h the in t roduc t ion o f f inanc ia l instruments fo r low-carbon 
technologies in Russia, the Bank wou ld be ready t o support the preparation and 
imp lemen ta t ion o f a number o f carbon-finance projects. There are t h r e e GEF projects in the 
Bank’s p ipe l ine awa i t ing the establishment o f a lega l and ins t i tu t iona l framework fo r their 
in troduc t ion at the reg iona l leve l w i t h federal oversight. Add i t iona l projects on b iod ivers i ty 
and c l ima te change cou ld also be prepared. The Bank w i l l con t inue pa r t ic ipa t ion in the 
M in is te r ia l Conference on Forest L a w Enforcement and Governance in Europe and N o r t h 
Asia. 

L ink ing Russian companies to global markets: I F C and MIGA ac t iv i t ies are also relevant 
to the expansion o f Russia’s g loba l ro le . In keeping w i t h i t s g loba l strategic ob jec t ive to 
encourage investment across emerg ing markets (South-South investment), 
IFC w i l l 
continue t o ac t ive ly support strong, reputable Russian clients in investments elsewhere in 
emerging markets. 
Consistent w i t h i t s strategic ob jec t ive t o support South-South 
investments through the p rov is ion o f guarantees, MIGA w i l l con t inue t o proac t ive ly engage 
Russian companies p lann ing t o inves t in emerging markets.

Focus on regions 

58 . 

A greater focus of the Bank’s work on the regions requires a concerted approach and 

coordination. The Bank has ongo ing ac t iv i t ies and projects in a large number o f Russian regions, 
i n v o l v i n g close cooperation w i t h the federal government. The number o f regions in the Russian 
Federation i s too large fo r e f fec t ive coord ina t ion and fund ing o f Bank ac t iv i t ies in regions across 
the entire coun try . M o r e e f fec t ive co l labora t ion at t h e sub-national leve l requires deep loca l 
know ledge and a strong mu tua l commitment. To b o t h interest Russian regions and have an 
impact, the Bank w i l l need t o o f fe r an integrated package o f ana ly t ica l and advisory wo rk 
comb ined w i t h f inanc ing where feasible. A deeper reg iona l engagement du r ing the CPS pe r iod 
therefore makes i t impera t ive that the B a n k focus i t s attention on a more l im i t e d number o f 
regions where i t can concentrate i t s work . Such a more focused approach wou ld also a l low the 
scaling up o f successes achieved in par t icu lar regions to other regions. 

5 9 . 
Based on the above principles, the Bank i s working with the federal government, in 
identifying a small sub-set of 6-10 regions that may become the target of concentrated work 

programs with the Bank. Regions are be ing chosen f r om wealthier, m idd le income, and poorer 
areas. Impo r tan t cr i ter ia fo r the selection o f regions fo r Bank engagement are (i) the w i l l ingness 
and comm i tmen t o f the reg iona l adm in is tra t ion to wo rk w i t h the Bank ; (ii) a past h is tory o f 
successful cooperation; (iii) the 
re form-or ien ta t ion and competence o f 
the 
reg iona l 
administration; ( iv ) strategic importance o f the reg ion f o r Russian development and the existence 
o f other s i m i l a r regions fo r possible scaling up o f successful cooperation; and (v) the region’s 
creditworthiness and po ten t ia l interest in Bank operations ( fo r wealthier o r m idd le income 
regions). F o l l ow i n g i n i t i a l engagement o f selected regions, the strategic directions and moda l i t ies 
o f cooperation w i t h the Bank w i l l be inc luded in a j o i n t Memoranda o f Understanding, t o be 
signed w i t h the leaders o f the focus regions. As noted, Bank invo lvemen t at the reg iona l leve l 
wou ld invo lve a comb ina t ion o f targeted AAA o n diagnostics o f the loca l economy and 
investment climate, and development o f reg iona l strategies, coupled w i t h selected lend ing 
operations to address key challenges. 

60. 
The World Bank Group intends to concentrate some work in poorer Russian regions, 
which are often in most need of development assistance. The l i s t o f p r io r i ty regions w i l l inc lude 

some such poorer regions. IBRD engagement in poorer regions that lack creditworthiness w i l l 
depend s ign i f ican t ly on opportunities fo r pa r t ic ipa t ion in federal programs o r the coord ina t ion o f 
donor funds. I F C w i l l make special e f for ts to support pr iva te sector ac t iv i t ies in poorer areas. 
F o r some poorer Russian regions wh ich have achieved creditworthiness, po ten t ia l opportunities 
exist 
fo r 
fee-for-service ac t iv i t ies or subnational 
lend ing w i thou t sovereign guarantees. 
Discussions o n the development o f new instruments w i l l g ive par t icu lar attention to fac i l i ta t ing 
Bank wo rk in poorer areas. 

Expected Bank Group Financing Volumes and Principles 

61. 
Annua l I B R D lending projects and volumes w i l l be determined in consultation with 
the Federal Government as part of the consultations on its annual borrowing program. In 

accordance w i t h Government’s preferences, a l l IBRD lend ing i s foreseen in the f o rm o f 
investment projects. Curren t ly , there are eight Bank projects in the Government-approved 
bo r row ing program, o f wh ich s ix lend ing operations (Hous ing and Communa l Services, Jud ic ia l 
Reforms, State Statistics Systems 11, I T Parks, Special Econom ic Zones, M ic ro f inance 
Infrastructure) and t w o guarantees. A se t o f broad pr inc ip les wou ld be fo l lowed in the selection 
and design o f fu ture Bank projects: (i) finance p r io r i ty ac t iv i t ies in accordance w i t h the CPS 
strategic 
framework ; (ii) finance ac t iv i t ies as par t o f the Government’s med ium - te rm 
fiscallexpenditure framework; (iii) p rov ide support fo r systemic solutions w i t h las t ing impac t on 
ins t i tu t iona l capacity and po ten t ia l fo r scaling up and rep l ica t ion ; ( iv) avo id design comp lex i ty ; 

30 

and (v ) mainstream imp lemen ta t ion arrangements w i t h i n ex is t ing ins t i tu t ions , wh i le ensuring 
sound f iduc iary safeguards fo r pro jec t imp lemen ta t ion . Annex B 3 prov ides details o f the i n i t i a l 
Bank lending program. W h i l e the IBRD lending volumes are expected to be very modest fo r a 
country o f Russia’s size and economic performance, somewhat reduced lend ing may be 
warranted in case o f unforeseen severe adverse developments on the macroeconomic o r po l icy 
front. In the event o f s ign i f ican t changes t o the proposed strategy, a CPS progress repor t wou ld 
be prepared fo r discussion b y the Board. 

Zn addition, Bank Group f inanc ing and guarantees w i l l be provided by ZFC, MZGA, 

62. 
G E F and the Carbon Finance Fac i l ity . IFC ’s s ign i f ican t commitments in Russia over the CPS 
per iod are expected t o be in the order o f US$700 m i l l i o n per year. Expected lend ing f r om the 
Sub-National Development Program i s expected t o be in the order o f US$25-100 m i l l i o n per 
year. MIGA’s po r t fo l io i s expected to rema in high. Po ten t ia l GEF allocations are US$ lO -20 
m i l l i o n per year (the Bank i s prepar ing a US$20 m i l l i o n renewable energy project), w i t h Carbon 
Finance projects possibly reaching US$lOO-300 m i l l i o n depending on the regu la tory framework 
Russia i s curren t ly preparing. As ind ica ted earlier, successful and t ime ly preparation o f projects 
w i l l require streamlining the Government procedures fo r pro jec t approval. 

Fiduciary Environment fo r Bank Lending 

63. 

The procurement environment for World Bank projects in Russia continues to be 
complex despite recent efforts to improve the legal framework. 

In the past, a vast amount o f 
o f ten uncoordinated procurement leg is la t ion and norms complicated the rea l iza t ion o f many Bank 
projects. A long-awa i ted ma jo r procurement law f o r the federal, regional, and mun ic ipa l levels o f 
government was f ina l ly passed and entered in to force in January 2006. On the pos i t ive side, the 
new law : (i) regulates pub l ic procurement at a l l leve ls -federal, regional, and mun ic ipa l - thereby 
p rov id ing the basis fo r a single economic space, (ii) substitutes a single leg is la t ive act fo r 
previous disperse, confusing, and sometimes contradictory regulations, (iii) prov ides fo r 
advertisement and full disclosure o f a l l procurement processes b y electronic means on o f f ic ia l 
websites, and ( iv ) creates the basis f o r electronic procurement in the future. The L a w also 
provides mechanisms o f con t ro l and rev iew o f complaints. Yet, in an e f fo r t to make the L a w 
‘‘corruption-proof” 
i t also prescribes a series o f rigid procedures that are at the expense o f 
f lex ib i l i ty and compe t i t ion and in contrast t o in terna t iona l best practice. 

The Bank will need to remain vigilant in safeguarding sound procurement in Bank- 

64. 
financed projects. Even more so, as Bank projects w i t h the federal government w i l l be carried 
out w i t h increased co-financing. In th is context, the Bank plans to ma in ta in in tens ive supervision 
o f procurement in Bank- f inanced projects. The Bank w i l l also ma in ta in a strong d ia logue w i t h 
Government in the interest o f imp rov ing the na t iona l procurement system and g i v i n g care fu l 
consideration t o the poss ib i l i ty o f using acceptable features o f current o r mod i f ied na t iona l 
leg is la t ion on procurement. Due to rema in ing s ign i f ican t differences between the new 
procurement l aw and the Bank ’s procurement guidelines, insu f f ic ien t practice under the new lega l 
framework, and the upward trend in corrup t ion in Russia, the use o f the na t iona l procurement 
system i s no t yet an op t ion fo r Bank operations in Russia. 

65. 

Thanks to concerted efforts, f inanc ia l management risk for most projects has been 

reduced. 

In 2001, the Coun try F inanc ia l Accoun tab i l i ty Assessment (C F A A ) assessed the 
f iduc iary environment o f the Russian po r t fo l io as high risk and recommended ma in ta in ing r ing - 
fenc ing arrangements f o r f iduc ia ry functions. 
Since then, the Russian government has 
accelerated the pace o f re forms in public f inanc ia l management. M a i n achievements and ongo ing 
reforms inc lude : (i) in the area o f budget preparation, fo rmu la t ion o f a three-year federa l budget; 
strategic p lann ing and gradual in t roduc t ion o f performance-based budgeting; (ii) progress in the 
in troduc t ion o f a new GFS-based chart o f accounts, and (iii) persistent delays associated w i t h the 

3 1 

manual clearing procedures are expected to b e overcome w i t h the full imp lemen ta t ion o f the 
Treasury Single Accoun t mechanism and i ts related in fo rma t ion system. In add i t ion on the Bank 
side, risk m i t iga t ing measures in f inanc ia l management (FM) have been incorporated in to project 
design and implementation, inc lud ing : (i) development o f a risk management framework and 
adoption o f a risk-based approach fo r FM work, wh ich helps focus attention and resources on 
particular areas o f vu lnerab i l i ty ; (ii) close wo rk w i t h c l ien t agencies at the pro jec t preparation 
stage to iden t i fy measures t o m i t iga te f iduc ia ry risks, strengthen con tro ls and develop borrower 
capacity; and (iii) at the pro jec t imp lemen ta t ion stage, mon i to r ing the con t inu ing adequacy o f the 
FM arrangements and satisfactory imp lemen ta t ion o f ac t ion plans and con tro ls ’ performance. As 
a result, the FM risk f o r most projects i s n ow considered t o be moderate. 

66. 
Additional actions are planned over the CPS period to further reduce FM-related 
fiduciary risks and improve portfolio quality, including: (i) t igh ten ing some core FM practices 

and increasing emphasis o n qua l i ty and effectiveness o f FM work , especially on aspects that have 
significant bearing on an t i-corrup t ion e.g., more r igorous fo l low -up on aud i t reports and 
management letters, and more intensive rev iew o f in terna l con t ro l systems; (ii) enhancing 
supervision activities, inc lud ing close mon i to r ing o f iden t i f ied high risk areas; (iii) extending 
consultations w i t h FM qua l i ty assurance on pro jec t design and supervision o f projects w i t h high 
corrup t ion potential; and ( iv) l i n k i n g FM supervision plans and resources w i t h FM risk ratings. 
The impac t o f the re forms on the f iduc ia ry env ironmen t w i l l need to b e assessed before 
contemplating greater use o f country systems in Bank- f inanced projects. In addition, as the Bank 
moves towards sub-national lend ing w i thou t sovereign guarantee there w i l l be a need to ga in 
and/or update know ledge o f the f iduc iary environments surrounding the f l o w o f funds, inc lud ing 
bo th the central and sub-national governments. 

67. 
To improve governance in the corporate sector, we expect the Government may 
request a comprehensive F inanc ia l Sector Assessment (FSAP ) , wh ich wou ld be conducted 

j o i n t l y w i t h the IMF. The F S A P wou ld be complemented and preceded by a Repor t on the 
Observance o f Standards and Codes (ROSC) in Accoun t ing and Aud i t ing . The ROSC w i l l . 
support re forms in the coun try ’s accounting and aud i t ing f ramewo rk and practices. I t i s expected 
to prov ide the recommendations to the Russian Government on: (i) fac i l i ta t ing trans i t ion to the 
international standards in accounting and auditing, wh ich shou ld support fo re ign d irec t and 
po r t fo l io investment in l ine w i t h the country development goals; (ii) a l low ing investors to 
evaluate corporate prospects and mak ing in fo rmed investment and vo t ing decisions; and (iii) 
enhancing professional accounting education and thus the qua l i ty o f accountants in the coun try . 

Partnerships 

’ 

68. 

Russia has benefited from a range of assistance from its various external partners. 

In terna t iona l donors have been ac t ive ly invo lved in assisting Russia in the trans forma t ion 
process. In terna t iona l experience was ac t ive ly shared and assistance p rov ided on a broad set o f 
macroeconomic management and business development issues, f isca l and public administration, 
ins t i tu t iona l and structural re fo rm and social po l ic ies . In terna t iona l donors p layed a key ro le in 
developing c i v i l society and Russian domestic NGOs . But the scope o f in terna t iona l donor 
assistance i s becom ing mo re l im i ted and selective as Russia economic performance i s imp rov ing . 
I t i s concentrating n ow o n issues o f good governance, budget and mun ic ipa l reform, hea l th sector 
and in fec t ious disease con tro l , inc lud ing H I V / A I D S , pover ty reduction, c h i l d we l fare and social 
services development. A strong reg iona l focus continues to be impor tan t fo r ma jo r donors l i k e 
EU, USAID, DFID, C I D A and SIDA, w i t h emphasis on the regions o f the No r the rn Caucases, 
N o r t h West and Ka l in ingrad . 

69 . 
Given the absence of a program, the IMF’s role in Russia has been reduced to a 
surveillance and advisory function. 

In this context, the IMF has continued an active dialogue 

32 

w i t h the government on macroeconomic po l icy and the regu la t ion o f the f inanc ia l sector. The 
Bank w i l l continue t o coordinate i t s w o r k in these areas closely w i t h the IMF w i t h the goa l o f 
reaching consensus and consistency in po l icy advice. The IMF has also continued valuable 
ana ly t ica l wo rk on the macroeconomic s i tua t ion in Russia, wh ich examines changing r i s k s and 
vulnerabilities, and opportunities fo r a med ium- term f isca l adjustment. 

The E B R D has continued its strong involvement in Russia, primarily in the private 

70. 
sector. Since 2002, the EBRD has ma in ta ined annual investment levels in Russia o f over EUR 1 
b i l l ion , 80 percent o f wh ich has gone t o the p r iva te sector. The EBRD has been par t icu lar ly 
active in the f inanc ia l sector, energy, infrastructure, manufacturing, and, through the Russia Sma l l 
Business Fund, the SME sector. Like IFC , the EBRD has been in troduc ing new f inanc ia l 
instruments in Russia, inc lud ing ruble-denominated bond issues and loans in 2005, and wo rk ing 
increasingly w i t h reg iona l administrations. Enhanced w o r k in Russia i s consistent w i t h EBRD’s 
general strategic goal t o comm i t a larger po r t ion o f i t s wo rk t o the East and South o f the E C A 
region. In fras truc ture and PPP-related projects w i l l be an increasing p r io r i ty in the near future. 
The EBRD remains a v i t a l wo rk ing partner fo r the W o r l d Bank Group, par t icu lar ly f o r IFC . T o 
date, I F C and EBRD have j o i n t l y supported more than 20 projects in Russia. M o s t o f these 
projects are in f inanc ia l markets, general manufacturing, and pr iva te equity funds. This 
cooperation i s par t icu lar ly valuable w i t h larger projects, where neither organization can absorb 
the full exposure needed, and w i t h loca l partners, where bo th can p lay a ro le in deve lop ing the 
company’s capacity. 

71. 
The Bank developed close working relationships and partnerships with various 
donor organizations in support of Russia’s economic reform agenda. One prom inen t example 

i s the p rog ram on pub l ic adm in is tra t ion and budget r e f o rm supported b y DFID, C ID A , S IDA , EU 
and a Bank-hosted j o i n t Dono r Secretariat. The Bank has collaborated closely w i t h the O ECD on 
i s s u e s o f ter t iary education. The Bank and W H O j o i n t l y coordinated a partnership fo r wo rk on 
imp rov ing governance in the Southern Federal Okrug, wh ich inc luded the active pa r t ic ipa t ion o f 
USAID, EU, and DFID. A mu l t i-sec tor Finnish trust fund i s curren t ly supporting a diverse set o f 
reg iona l development ac t iv i t ies in the regions o f the N o r t h West. DFID has also supported the 
Bank’s pover ty wo rk in Russia. 
IFC’s Pr iva te E n t e r p r i s e Partnership in Russia i s curren t ly 
funded b y the Governments o f Austria, Canada, Denmark, F in land , Sw i tzer land and Saxony ( o f 
Germany) as we l l as b y GEF. Meanwh i le , USAID, EU, EBRD, DfID and SECO have supported 
FIAS operations in the coun try .

CPS results monitoring will be undertaken jointly with the Government. M o n i t o r i n g

Government as par t o f the annual consultation process fo r assessing progress o f the CPS and 
possible adjustments to the Bank program. These consultations wou ld also p rov ide inputs fo r 
upda t ing the CPS results framework to re f lec t such adjustments.

CREDITWORTHINESS AND RISKS 

Creditworthiness and Bank Exposure 

73. 
Russia’s creditworthiness has improved significantly over recent years in tandem 
with a reduction in its external debt. The high o i l p r ices o f recent years have built up reserves, 
strengthened the f isca l pos i t ion and b y end-July 2006 a l lowed f o r the accumulation o f US$67.2 
b i l l i o n in the S tab i l iza t ion Fund. Russia became a ne t external cred i tor in 2004. In 2005 Russia 
pa id o f f i t s outstanding US$3.5 b i l l i o n t o the IMF, as w e l l as some US$20 b i l l i o n in Soviet-era 
debt, including US$15.6 b i l l i o n in prepayments t o the Paris C lub . This brough t the to ta l public 
external debt stock down t o US$71.4 b i l l i o n at the end o f 2005 (or 9 .4 percent o f GDP), 
compared w i t h US$97.4 b i l l i o n (16.5 percent o f GDP) at the end o f 2004. In 2006 Russia prepa id 
a l l o f i t s rema in ing debt t o the Paris C lub (U S 21.3 b i l l ion ) , wh ich shou ld b r i n g Russian 
sovereign fore ign debt down to 4.5 percent o f GDP b y the end o f the year. The federal domestic 
debt stock i s small, amoun t ing to 4 percen t o f GDP at the start o f 2006. The sovereign’s 
commitment to pay i t s external creditors remains strong. B y the end o f April 2006, Russia 
became the fourth-largest ho lder o f g o l d and foreign-currency reserves in the wo r ld . With o i l 
prices expected to rema in broad ly at current levels over the forecast period, Russia wou ld have n o 
problems servicing i t s debt. 

es 

74. 
A t the sub-national leve l , the creditworthiness of Russia’s strongest regions also 
guarantees by the Bank Group’s Sub-National Development Program . High economic g row th 
continues to improve and offers expanding opportunities for 
lending without sovereign

I n line with the modest CPS lending scenario, I B R D ’ s exposure i n Russia’s w i l l

Risks 

Macroeconomic risks associated with Russia’s o i l dependency are considered low

dur ing the CPS period. The repayment o f fore ign debt and the rap id accumulation o f reserves 
have insulated Russia t o a s ign i f ican t degree f r om external shocks. A very sharp decline o f o i l 
prices cou ld send r ipp les through Russian f inanc ia l markets. Even in this event, government 
finances wou ld be protected during the CPS period b y the large accumulated f isca l reserve 
(S tab i l iza t ion Fund). The S tab i l iza t ion Fund ( f isca l reserve) has accumulated resources t o the 
po in t that i t cou ld sustain the government budget at curren t expenditure leve ls w i t h o i l prices 
under US$20 a barre l du r ing the CPS period. G iven that the Russia’s dependence on fore ign 
money concerns p r ima r i ly sales o f o i l and gas, as opposed t o i n f l ow s o f fore ign investment, i t s 
immediate macroeconomic vu lne rab i l i ty to changes in inves tor sentiment i s lowe r than in many 
other emerging market economies. The immediate r i s k s f r o m a sharp f a l l in o i l prices, together 
w i t h a s ign i f ican t depreciation o f the ruble, wou ld l i k e l y be con f ined t o the non-government 
f inanc ia l sector in the short run, and cou ld be contained through responsible macroeconomic 
po l icy and bank regulation. Simulations reported in Annex 1 ind ica te that s ign i f ican t economic 
g row th and macroeconomic balances should be ma in ta ined over the CPS pe r iod even in the event 
o f l o w o i l prices. A possible imp l ica t ion o f Russia’s high f isca l reserves f o r the Bank’s p rog ram 
may be a further reduc t ion o f IBRD’s lending p rog ram be low the already modest levels foreseen. 
Future Bank lending i s focused on leveraging Russia’s o w n funds through increased na t iona l co- 
financing. U l t ima te ly , the Government w i l l decide o n bo r row ing f r o m the Bank based on f isca l 
conditions and the alternative options f o r ava i l ing the Bank ’s value added, such as fee-for-service 
arrangements. 

77. 

Wh i le macroeconomic risks are considered low, there are implementation risks 
related to the pace and the direction of economic reforms. Russia’s po l i t ica l environment i s 

curren t ly stable. President Putin has a strong mandate and enjoys a cons t i tu t iona l ma jo r i ty in the 
Duma. The executive branch has more leverage over reg iona l and loca l governments than in the 
past. The nex t presidential e lec t ion in 2008 i s no t expected t o lead to s ign i f ican t changes in 
po l icy . Nonetheless, there remains some uncertainty about the pace and the d irec t ion o f 
economic reforms. While the current medium-term development p rog ram fo l lows the general 
trans i t ion goals o f the 2000 program, they also inc lude more con trovers ia l areas o f economic 
po l icy wh ich have a m ixed w o r l d experience. These inc lude ac t ive state interventions along a 
‘new indus tr ia l po l icy ’ wh ich a im at s t imu la t ing d ivers i f ica t ion and the innova t ion economy. The 
Bank ’s invo lvemen t in areas such as the new economic zones and indus t r ia l parks help to bring 
best g loba l practice to Russia fo r development o f such po l icy areas. D i f f e r i n g v iews cou ld also 
exist w i t h i n the government on administrative and budgetary re form , par t icu lar ly on the degree to 
wh ich these reforms should o r should no t concentrate attention o n increasing con t ro l o f the 
federal center over sub-national bodies. In these areas, the Bank can p lay a valuable advisory ro le 
in transferring g loba l experience and the state o f know ledge o n po ten t ia l advantages and r i s k s 
f r om the pursuit o f one o r another specific po l icy . 

F ina l ly , there are implementation risks in the Bank moving to a more regional 

78. 
approach and to the new modalities of operation. Some o f the proposed moda l i t ies such as sub- 
na t iona l lend ing and the development o f a fee-for-service adv isory p rog ram are either re la t ive ly 
new fo r the Bank o r limited in terms o f p r io r experience, and operational details are s t i l l evo lv ing . 
T o address these r i s k s , the Bank w i l l be selective in how i t approaches the evo lv ing wo rk in the 
regions to ensure a c r i t ica l mass and impac t o f i t s interventions. In mov ing t o the new moda l i t ies 

35 

of operation, the Bank can b u i l d on the s ign i f ican t progress achieved w i t h successful p i lo ts 
already completed in many o f the new areas. A comp l ica t ing factor may be the recent pub l ic 
procurement and compe t i t ion laws wh ich appear no t t o exempt I F I s f r om compe t i t ion w i t h 
p r iva te market participants when seeking to p rov ide pa id services to a l l levels o f government o r

apparent bottleneck, through expeditious amendments t o the laws and/or the execution o f a stand

Assuming that 
the Russian government sticks 
to 
i t s basic economic po l icy 
commitments, the Russian economy should continue to exh ib i t s ign i f ican t g row th throughout the 
CPS period, although capacity constraints may increasingly limit the pace o f expansion. F o r the 
CPS period, o i l prices present the p r ima ry source o f uncertainty f o r b o t h fo r the pace and nature 
o f fu ture growth. Three scenarios considered be low are pro jec ted fo r d i f feren t o i l p r i c e 
trajectories. In the med ium and longer term, g row th prospects w i l l depend greatly on economic 
po l icy and reforms. This especially concerns the e f fec t ive maintenance o f macroeconomic 
stability, the development o f infrastructure and energy, and measures to imp rove the c l ima te fo r 
pr iva te investment, competition, and entrepreneurship. G r ow t h prospects also depend on external 
factors other than o i l . Higher in terna t iona l interest rates, fo r example, cou ld deprive Russian 
enterprises o f their current sources o f re la t ive ly cheap finance, w i t h imp l ica t ions fo r p ro f i tab i l i ty 
and growth. As most fore ign in f lows come f r om o i l and gas, Russia’s macroeconomic pos i t ion i s 
no t as vulnerable in the short te rm re la t ive t o most other countries in the reg ion to changes in 
investor sentiment about emerging markets.

A l l three scenarios are consistent w i t h the con t inua t ion o f economic growth, macro- 
s tab i l i ty , and bo th f isca l and current account surp luses . Yet, they pose d i f feren t sorts o f po l icy 
challenges. Under the l o w case scenario, f isca l and current account surpluses large ly evaporate 
b y 2009. This scenario wou ld most l i k e l y also be accompanied b y a substantial weakening o f the 
cap i ta l account. Qu i te probably, such a decline in o i l prices wou ld shake up the Russian f inanc ia l 
sector and create serious problems in some commerc ia l banks. The Central Bank should manage 
to isolate these problems in a hand fu l o f p rob lem banks w i t h h i g h o i l p r ice o r fore ign exposure, 
and thereby prevent a general f inanc ia l crisis. In this l o w o i l pr ice scenario, the manufacturing 
sector o f the economy wou ld receive a much-needed boost in competitiveness, but might also 
find i tse l f more l iqu id i ty constrained in the short due to the problems in the f inanc ia l sector. Due 
to th is factor and slower g row th in domestic demand, economic g row th wou ld be lower . In f la t ion 
wou ld be higher than in the base case o i l scenario due in part to rub le depreciation and higher 
prices f o r impor ts . 

4. 

The h i g h o i l pr ice scenario presents a challenge in the f o rm o f even larger balance o f 
payments in f lows . In order to keep in f la t ion under con t ro l (at s t i l l 10 percent) and protect 
tradable sectors o f the economic f r om an extremely rap id rea l exchange rate appreciation, the 
government wou ld be compe l led to generate ever greater federal budgetary surpluses, up t o 14 
percent o f GDP in 2009. In this scenario, economic g row th accelerates s l igh t ly to 6.5 percent o f 
GDP, bu t this wou ld b e accompanied b y an even more rap id decline in employment in 
manufacturing, w i t h the movement o f labor and other assets t o non-tradable sectors. Res tr ic t ive 
macroeconomic po l icy wou ld be essential fo r ma in ta in ing macroeconomic s tab i l i ty and 
preven t ing the overheating o f the economy. An extremely rap id accumu la t ion o f reserves (By 
2009, US$ 690 b i l l i o n in gross currency reserves and a S tab i l iza t ion Fund o f over US$ 600 
b i l l ion ) wou ld challenge the government t o m in im ize the oppor tun i ty costs o f delays o r 
ine f f ic ienc ies in the investment o f this money in a d ive rs i f ied in terna t iona l po r t fo l io . 

5. 

In the base case scenario, the current account and balance o f payments moves gradually 
toward equilibrium, and pressure on the rub le subsides somewhat. Annua l GD P g row th continues 
at f i v e percent through 2009, and in f la t ion fa l ls t o 5 percent. Thus, o f the three scenarios, re la t ive 
s tab i l i ty in o i l prices presents the best oppor tun i ty fo r reduc ing in f la t ion .

Russian Federat ion: Deve lopmen t Challenges a n d Reg iona l Issues 

1. 

Russia’s rapid growth, increased wealth and political stability since 1999 provide 
opportunities for tackling a unique and di,fficult set of development challenges. They encompass 
rema in ing hurdles in economic trans i t ion to a market economy (judiciary, regulatory institutions, 
etc.), issues common to developed market economies (such as aging population, eradication o f 
poverty), problems stemming f r om the dominance o f extractive industries and the effects o f “Dutch 
Disease,” and Russia-specific tasks (more e f f ic ien t development o f i t s vast terr i tory , o f wh ich a 
large part functions under harsh c l ima t ic conditions). 

Sustaining Rapid Growth 

2. 

Wh i le the Russian economy should continue to grow over a wide range of possible 
scenarios, maintaining or accelerating the current pace of growth w i l l be a challenge. Current 
annual GDP g row th i s projected to be 4.5 - 6.5 percent over the nex t 5 years. W h i l e this i s a very 
respectable pace f o r a m idd le income country, this average g row th fa l ls short o f the 7 percent target 
necessary to double GDP in t e n years in accordance w i t h the government’s objectives. Ach iev ing 
and sustaining high g row th requires that the Russian government maintains macroeconomic 
stability, wh i le at the same t ime rea l iz ing key structural and spatial policies. 

3. 
Macroeconomic stability remains essential for growth. S trong comm i tmen t t o budget 
d isc ip l ine and huge surplus revenues associated w i t h high o i l prices have transformed the 
macroeconomic environment, fac i l i ta t ing the e l im ina t ion o f budget deficits, the accumulation o f 
reserves, and a major reduc t ion in outstanding debt. But w i n d f a l l o i l revenues also im p l y new 
challenges. They underpin the f inanc ia l strength o f the government, but also present tw o types o f 
impor tan t macroeconomic risks: (i) upwa rd pressures on in f la t ion and the real exchange rate and 
(ii) a risk o f potential vo la t i l i ty due to the high dependence o f the economy and government finance 
on o i l prices. 

W ith regard to the f irst risk, the Russian government has shown notable monetary and 
fiscal restraint at a time of heated domestic demand, p r ima r i ly b y generating high f isca l 
surpluses and accumulating w i n d f a l l revenue in a S tab i l iza t ion Fund. Even so, annual 
i n f l a t i o n has remained rather h i g h at over 10 percent. 

W ith regard to the second risk, f ew experts expect a sharp fa l l i n o i l prices at the present 
time. Nonetheless, o i l prices have h is tor ica l ly been quite vo la t i le and d i f f i c u l t to predict, 
and this i s a source o f risk t o Russia. A sharp f a l l in o i l prices, and an associated 
depreciation o f the Russian ruble, wou ld l i k e l y cause problems f o r a number o f Russian 
banks, as we l l as f o r some Russian f irms that have accumulated s ign i f ican t foreign- 
denominated debt. 

4. 

Rapidly growing reserves place a new and increasingly important demand for quickly 
developing asset management capabilities in the government and the Centra l B an k . 
In the 
context o f high o i l prices, Russia has been accumulating f isca l and monetary reserves at an 
extremely r a p i d rate. So far, the corresponding f isca l S tab i l iza t ion Fund i s s imp ly h e l d as an 
account b y the government at the Central Bank . As the size o f this fund increases, the oppor tun i ty 
costs o f not inves t ing these reserves in a d ive rs i f ied p o r t f o l i o are mounting. The fact that the f isca l 
reserve i s not so invested also increases pressures to use i t f o r domestic purposes, w h i c h c a r r i e s a 
high in f la t ionary risk and cou ld undermine macroeconomic s tab i l i ty . T o counter these pressures 
and ensure more effective use o f the accumulated resources, the Government has decided t o set up a 
fund f o r future generations b y inves t ing a po r t ion o f the S tab i l iza t ion Fund in a longer- term 
d ivers i f ied por t fo l io . The fund has the potential to g row in to an impor tan t source o f income fo r 
Russia, p lay ing a ma jor r o l e in mee t ing fu ture social obligations and creating a large d ivers i f ied 
source o f income that w i l l protect the budget against vo la t i l i t ies in o i l and gas revenues. T o achieve 

A n n e x 2 

Page 2 o f 13 

this potential, Russia w i l l need to make an investment in the nex t couple o f years i n t o institutions o f 
oversight and governance f o r po r t fo l io management in correspondence w i t h best international 
practice. 

5. 

Diversification occupies more and more of a prominent place in Russian policy 
debates, as economic g row th in Russia has become increasingly concentrated in non-tradable 
sectors o f the economy. The inher i ted Soviet economic structure o f fered Russia few initial 
opportunities f o r international competitiveness outside o f resource-related industries. 
The 
exhaustion o f temporary factors that supported broad-based g row th in the immed ia te post-crisis 
period, along w i t h much h igher o i l and gas prices, once again favor the development o f resource 
sectors and non-tradables re la t ive to manufacturing. The strong appreciation o f the Russian rub le 
can be associated w i t h domestic labor costs that are, f o r example, rough ly double those o f 
ne ighbor ing Ukra ine , wh ich has comparable labor produc t iv i ty . The recent Investment C l ima te 
Assessment suggests that, b y contrast, Russian p roduc t iv i ty in manu fac tur ing i s close to that o f 
Ukraine, as w e l l as t o Ch ina and I n d i a where labor costs are many times lowe r .

Diversifcation and development of 
the knowledge-based economy can be critical to 
Russia’s future prospects. While Russia’s current development mode l as a ma jor energy supplier 
w i t h a th r iv ing and pro f i tab le domestic market i s consistent w i t h continued g row th and welfare 
improvements f o r the population, this mode l also poses s ign i f ican t r i s k s and arguably constrains 
Russia’s economic potential. A h i g h dependence on o i l and gas makes Russia h igh ly vulnerable to 
changes to commod i ty prices. Na tura l resource supplies in Russia are also no t un l im i ted . 
Increasing evidence f r om the recent experience in economic g row th suggests ma jor advantages fo r 
countries that succeed in developing h i g h l y compe t i t ive manufacturing and innova t ion industries. 
Russia has po ten t ia l advantages f r om a generally high leve l o f human capital. A strong rub le and, 
consequently, high labor costs in Russia re la t ive to many other m idd le income countries, suggest a 
natural specialization in h igh ly -sk i l led labor. Thus, the degree to w h i c h Russia can succeed in 
igniting a competitive innovation-based economy w i l l determine much f o r i t s prospects fo r 
sustaining high rates o f g row th over the longer term. 

7 . 

Wh i le Russia has made some important strides in improving the investment climate, 
further improvements w i l l be needed for realizing the ambition of a dynamic, diversified, and

competition, a weak jud ic iary , the common capture o f markets at the reg iona l level, problematic 
access to land and premises, and rema in ing uncertainty over property rights. W h i l e the W o r l d Bank 
Group’s D o i n g Business Report and recent I C A Surveys c o n f i rm that Russia may have, f o r 
example, reached or surpassed I n d i a and Ch ina b y many o f basic investment c l ima te indicators 
(registration, taxes, permits, customs, inspections), many problems remain. Concentration in 
Russia i s high. Evidence collected in the Coun try Economic Memorandum o f 2003 suggests that 
almost h a l f o f a l l sales in the economy in 2002 may have been associated w i t h 22 large business 
groups. W h i l e more recent comparable data i s no t available, par t ia l evidence suggests that the 
concentration in ownership has g rown s t i l l further in the last few years. This i s par t icu lar ly true f o r 

A n n e x 2

the share o f government par t ic ipa t ion in the economy, w h i c h has been the cause o f some concern. 
The process o f “creative destruction,” i n v o l v i n g high leve ls o f entry and exist in fluid markets, 
w h i c h i s v i ta l f o r “the innova t ion economy,” w i l l need to be fostered in Russia through reforms that 
improve incentives at the subnational leve l f o r good governance (see be low) and a fur ther 
strengthening o f market institutions. 
In recent years, more Russian businesses have been c i t ing 
corrup t ion and un fa i r compe t i t ion as s ign i f ican t problems f o r their operations. 

8. 
The share in employment of small businesses and individual entrepreneurs remains 
quite low i n Russia (26 percent) by international standards. This appears d irec t ly related t o 
problems in concentration and un fa i r compe t i t ion discussed above. M a n y o f the rema in ing 
administrative barriers t o business in Russia f a l l disproportionately on small business. Results f r om 
the I C A survey suggest that f irms in Russia fac ing the greatest degree o f compe t i t ion ( inc lud ing 
SMEs) also face the highest reported investment c l ima te constraints. A recent F I A S study on 
Russia highlights in particular problems in access to land and premises f o r entrepreneurs. 

9 . 

Increasing private investment rates is essential to ma inta in ing rapid growth. F i x e d 
capital investment has been g row ing at double digit annual rates, although f r om a very l o w base. 
But i t remains l o w in absolute terms re la t ive t o Russia’s development needs. F i x e d capital 
investment amounts to rough ly 18 percent o f GDP in 2005, wh ich can be compared t o rates o f over 
25 percent in most emerging market countries that have sustained rap id g row th over a number o f 
years. Potential investment growth, including FDI, su f fered in the context o f the Yukos a f fa ir and 
other m i x e d signals com ing f r om the government concerning the appropriate ro le o f pr iva te capital 
i n the Russian economy. The year 2005 witnessed progress in the c lar i f ica t ion o f these issues, but 
regulatory and other problems continue to limit investment, par t icu lar ly more r i s k y investments in 
the manufacturing sectors o f the economy. 

10. 
H ighe r investment is needed throughout the economy: in extractive industries, 
manufacturing, transportation, electricity, and the social sectors. Investments in manufacturing 
are c r i t ica l f o r d ivers i f ica t ion , and yet they are par t icu lar ly l ow . O n l y 17 percent o f f i x e d capital 
investment currently goes t o manufacturing industries in Russia, ra is ing concerns over the ab i l i ty o f 
these industries to increase produc t iv i ty at a pace that w o u l d ensure their future competitiveness. A 
pr imary source o f produc t iv i ty increases in indus try in recent years has been labor-shedding. Y e t 
this source may n ow be reaching i t s l i m i t s . W h i l e the o i l and gas sectors have attracted a large 
share o f Russian investment in recent years, the estimated needed investment f o r exp lora t ion and 
the exp lo i ta t ion o f new deposits i s much larger. In fras truc ture in transportation, e lec tr ic i ty , and the 
social sectors has suffered f r om neglect and l o w investment throughout the trans i t ion period. The 
government now has bo th the w i l l and the resources t o increase investment in infrastructure. 

11. 
Infrastructure is very important for Russia’s economic development. There i s a g row ing 
demand f o r infrastructure services such as new roads, urban transportation, e lec tr ic i ty and heat 
supply. At the same time, the extensive networks o f ex is t ing infrastructure - inc lud ing power, 
telecommunications, communal services and transportation developed dur ing the Soviet time - - 
have no t been properly maintained during the transition, wh ich i s lead ing to deterioration o f service 
qua l i ty and g row ing l iab i l i t ies fo r rehabilitation. Acco rd ing to federal government estimates, the 
one-time rehab i l i ta t ion needs o f the communal services sector amount to around US$33 b i l l i o n . In 
this context, the government has been increasing infrastructure investment, and i s also malung 
s ign i f ican t efforts to fac i l i ta te private-public partnerships in the prov is ion o f infrastructure services. 
Some recent examples inc lude establishment o f an Investment Fund to support PPP projects, the 
adoption o f a concession law , the preparation o f a conceptual framework and d ra f t leg is la t ive 
package f o r t o l l roads and the development o f a mechanism f o r guaranteeing pr iva te investments in 
e lec tr ic i ty generation. 

12. 
The problem of 
infrastructure development i s related to a more general dilemma that 
makes economic transition and sustaining rapid growth in Russia much more complicated than 
in many other former socialist countries, namely the spatial misallocation of people and capital. 
As a legacy o f Soviet planning, a substantial part o f the Russian popu la t ion and capital stock 

A n n e x 2

Wh i le Russia has made substantial progress in many areas of economic reforms, 
housing and communal services, gas, and, to certain extent, electricity reforms a re still far from 
realizing their true potential. This poses significant impediments f o r creating market mechanisms 
f o r the de l ivery o f housing and u t i l i t y services. Currently, the most ambitious r e f o rm program i s in 
the e lec tr ic i ty sector, w i t h tw o d is t inc t and equally c r i t ica l parts: the structural and market r e f o rm

the potential to resu l t in a more e f f ic ien t and compe t i t ive market structure. Russia i s one o f the 
most energy intensive economies on the planet. In 2004, Russia’s economy had consumed about 0.9 
k g o f o i l equivalent per one U S do l lar o f GDP, measured b y purchasing power pa r i ty (PPP), wh i le 
the same rate in developed and even developing countries stands at 0.1-0.2 k g o f o i l equivalent per

Both the growth potential and possibilities for increasing efficiency in the Russian 
natural gas sector are very large . The sector i s dominated b y Gazprom, the state-controlled 
company (5 1 % state-owned after the recent acquisition o f shares b y the Government) w h i c h 
controls the Unified Gas Supply System (UGSS) and holds a monopo ly f o r gas exports f r om 
Russia. Despite the remarkable g row th in gas prices on international markets, Gazprom’s 
produc t ion levels have been increasing at a much slower rate than the Russian economy as a who le 
(1.5% per annum over the last f i v e years, as against an a l l- indus try average o f over 6.7%.). L a c k o f 
investment in the development o f new gas f ie lds and related infrastructure i s a par t icu lar ly pressing

As the Russian population shrinks and ages, labor supply i s becoming a n ever greater 
constraint on economic growth. The most recent Investment C l ima te Assessment o f the W o r l d

s k i l l e d labor, i s already a ma jor p rob lem fo r many f irms . Furthermore, the t ra in ing o f labor in 
Russian f irms appears to be inadequate, wh i le bo th forma l and i n f o rm a l education systems are no t 
oriented toward s k i l l s to support h igher produc t iv i ty . M e d i um te rm demographic trends are 
par t icu lar ly unfavorable. Over the med ium term, the loss in wo r lung popu la t ion w i l l become even 
more acute. A recent W o r l d Bank report, “Dy ing to Young,” emphasizes the re la t ionsh ip between 
labor supply issues and the acute problems in the poor health o f the popu la t ion and premature 
morb id i ty . Thus, imp rov ing the health o f the popu la t ion i s a pr imary challenge in this area.

current and insufficient qua l i ty o f m ig ra t ion leg is la t ion and i t s weak enforcement pose substantial 
po l i t ica l and other r i s k s to the country labor supply in the future. The government has been g i v i n g

The Russian banking sector is still small relative to the needs of 
the economy but

Development of the rural and small-town economy presents a particular challenge. 27 
percent o f the popu la t ion l ives in ru ra l areas and 10 percent are employed in agriculture. This 
compares w i t h EU 15 countries where 22 percent o f the popu la t ion are ru ra l but on ly 4 percent are 
employed in agriculture. Especially in the more densely populated areas, there are substantial 
opportunities f o r strengthening and d ive rs i fy ing the economy through the creation o f more f lex ib le 
land markets, imp roved access to f inanc ia l services, enhanced landscape management, and 
improved p rov is ion o f basic infrastructure and social services. In this context, small businesses 
cou ld assume a more prominent ro le in produc t ion and the processing o f h igher quality, h igher 
value added food and agricultural products. 

18. 
The rura l economy still largely depends on agriculture, which still faces major 
structural challenges. Since strong grow th o f agr icu l tura l output f o l l ow i n g the devaluation o f 
1998, the sector g row th has since contracted, and has been g row ing at 2% t o 3% over recent years. 
The food processing sector, large ly privatized, appears to be undergo ing a gradual transformation in 
response to the increasing compe t i t ion caused b y a re la t ive ly open trade po l icy , changing patterns 
o f consumer demand, and changes in the prices and sources o f raw materials. Yet, rema in ing 
challenges inc lude s low l iqu ida t ion o f unpro f i tab le farms and the transfer o f the ir assets to more 
e f f ic ien t enterprises, ine f f ic ien t input subsidies fo r fer t i l izer , credit (interest rates), and machinery, 
and some regressive trade and p r i c e policies. These s low d ow n the shedding o f loss mak ing

o f loss-making enterprises i s f a l l i n g s low ly , 37% o f agr icu l tura l enterprises are s t i l l loss-making 15 
years after r e f o rm began. Overa l l budget subsidies to agr icu l ture and ru ra l development are much 
lowe r in Russia than in OECD countries. However there i s substantial potential to reorient these 
programs to focus more on de l ivery o f public goods rather than o n market interventions. Removal 
o f rema in ing trade barriers and produc t ion quotas, r e f o rm o f the present machinery leasing

some areas, a l though m u c h new indus tr ia l development uses modem , less p o l l u t i n g technologies. R a p i d 
urban redevelopment, w i t h d isorder ly land-use p lann ing and p o o r l y func t ion ing land markets, impedes the

threat to longer t e rm sustainability, and tou r ism development needs t o incorporate landscape management. 
Water resource and water qua l i ty management rema in inadequate, and agr icu l tura l land management does n o t 
always take sustainability approaches in to account. A clear, 
transparent system o f env ironmen ta l

Pub l i c Governance 

20. 
Weak public sector governance remains a key impediment to accelerating Russia's 
growth and improving the provision of social services. T o a large degree Russian c i v i l servants 
s t i l l operate under distorted incentives i n an ine f f ic ien t system o f government adm in is tra t ion that 
was large ly inher i ted f r om the Soviet Un ion . So far there have been modest results f r om e f for ts to 
implement a far-reaching pub l ic administration re form , a im ing to reduce the interference o f the 
government in the func t ion ing o f the economy, imp rove the qua l i ty o f administrative services, and 
increase the accountability o f c i v i l servants to the public. There exits an abundance o f evidence 
that problems in pub l ic administration and the jud ic ia ry continue to be ma jo r obstacles t o 
improvements in the business climate. Intergovernmental f isca l relations have also been a primary 
source o f distorted 
incentives 
f o r governmental o f f ic ia ls and budgetary 
ine f f ic iency . 
Correspondingly, they have been the subject o f ma jor re forms that are s t i l l in the process o f 
implementation.

21. 
Russia has been working to build a modern civil service and government 
administration, although these reforms are f a r from complete. During the trans i t ion period, the 
Russian c i v i l service has suffered f r om the Soviet legacy o f l o w pay, weak economic (performance- 
based) incentives, and an administrative apparatus r i d d l e d w i t h ine f f ic ienc ies and redundancies. 
This has been a source o f corrup t ion and a thorn in the side o f the business climate. Recent years 
have witnessed some improvements. In particular, the pay f o r federal and many sub-national c i v i l 
servants has been increased closer to market rates, the organization o f the federal government 
apparatus has been streamlined, and evaluation and recru i tmen t processes have been transformed. 
A strong emphasis has been placed o n a better ar t icu la t ion o f goals and the measurement o f results 
in the evaluation o f c i v i l servants. Part o f the current stage o f the administrative r e f o rm 
concentrates on the reg iona l leve l . Recently, the M i n i s t r y o f Econom ic Trade and Development 
conducted a compe t i t ion among Russian regions and federal executive bodies f o r federal f inanc ia l 
support o f regional programs. 29 out o f 46 par t ic ipa t ing regions, and 19 out o f 22 par t ic ipa t ing 
federal executive bodies, were awarded f inanc ia l support o n the basis o f the strength o f their 
proposed programs. Yet, the transformation o f government adm in is tra t ion in Russia i s l i k e l y t o be 
a slow and complicated process. This was i l lus tra ted w e l l in 2004, when an attempt at a rap id leap 
forward in the re-organization o f the federal government proved very d isrup t ive to government 
operations in the short term. 

22. 
Intergovernmental fiscal relations have undergone major changes since the 1990s, and 
significant reforms are still at the implementation stage. The f isca l federalist system o f the 1990s 
featured a high degree o f b o t h forma l centralization and i n f o rm a l decentralization. Saddled w i t h 
excessive federal expenditure mandates and lack ing their ow n exp l ic i t revenue sources, subnational 
governments created “shadow budgets” on the basis o f i n f o rm a l b i la tera l relations w i t h f i rms 
operating on i t s terr i tory , and w e l l as through debt offsets and various money surrogates. A system 
o f soft interbudgetary transfers gave weak incentives f o r responsible f isca l management o r 
performance in the fo rma l system. Reforms since 2000 have in troduced a more ra t iona l formu la- 
based transfer formula, greatly reduced unfunded expenditure mandates, created a clearer and more 
stable d iv is ion o f revenue and expenditure assignments among d i f feren t leve ls o f government, and 
delegated more expenditure autonomy to lowe r levels o f government. A cen tra l iza t ion o f po l i t ica l 
power has granted the federal government greater leverage over many o f the activities o f 
subnational administrations. A very ambitious r e f o rm in loca l self-government has created 1000s 
o f new mun ic ipa l i t ies in Russia, and aims to establish genuine budgetary ins t i tu t ions at the loca l 
(municipal) leve l o f government. M a n y regions are also f o l l ow i n g the federal lead in developing a 
med ium- term budgetary framework and performance-based budgeting. A number o f regions are 
pursuing and ob ta in ing in terna t iona l debt ratings. Nevertheless, survey evidence suggests that 
problems rema in in funding imbalances, continued budgetary pressures in the f o rm o f in fo rma l 
mandates (as recommendations), and perceptions at the subnational leve l that imp roved budgetary 
performance w i l l be inadequately rewarded b y the federal center. The imp lemen ta t ion o f the loca l 
self-government r e f o rm has been par t icu lar ly complicated, due in part to problems o f inadequate 
loca l capacity and unforeseen imbalances in revenues and expenditure responsibilities. 

23. 
Judiciary reform remains central to building ru le of 
law in Russia. Recent Bank wo rk 
on Judicial Systems in Trans i t ion Economies highlights the fact that building a strong demand and 
capacity fo r an independent and e f fec t ive jud ic ia ry system has been among the most d i f f i c u l t 
ins t i tu t iona l reforms in most trans i t ion countries. Russia i s n o exception. A l though the jud ic ia ry 
has become increasingly impor tan t fo r reso lv ing economic con f l ic ts in Russia since the 1990s, i t 
s t i l l needs to imp rove i t s c red ib i l i ty among the population. Serious problems rema in in the 
competency, training, and compensation schemes f o r judges, and in the a b i l i t y o f courts t o enforce 
decisions. 
In fo rma t ion disclosure on court cases i s insu f f ic ien t . The government has made 
in forma t ion disclosure ( inc lud ing computerization o f the jud ic ia ry ne twork) and better conditions 
f o r judge’s particular pr ior i t ies in the current stage o f j u d i c i a l reform. 

24. 
The Russian government has demonstrated a concern over the new evidence of 
corruption. A f te r a per iod o f decline dur ing 1999-2002, recent evidence f r om business surveys 
(BEEPS in particular) indicates that corrup t ion has taken an upward turn and appears to be a 

A n n e x 2 

Page 8 o f 13 

g row ing obstacle t o business. W h i l e survey evidence suggests that levels o f corrup t ion in Russia 
are no t extremely high re la t ive to other m idd le income countries, there i s evidence f r om a number 
o f sources that progress in ba t t l ing corrup t ion in Russia may have stalled or even reversed in the 
last few years. The per iod f r om 1999 to 2002 witnessed impor tan t successes in economic re fo rm in 
Russia, inc lud ing comprehensive tax re fo rm and campaigns to combat “administrative barriers to 
business.” The reduction o f corrup t ion as a barr ier to business appeared par t icu lar ly strong in 
Russia. In 1999, rough ly h a l f o f a l l Russian entrepreneurs in the BEEPS survey c i ted corrup t ion as 
a serious imped imen t t o the ir business. B y 2002, this average f o r Russia f e l l to 29 percent. B y 
2005, however, the frequency o f citations o f corrup t ion as a s ign i f ican t imped imen t to business in 
Russia increased again to 39 percent. The causes o f the apparent recent deterioration in indicators 
o f corrup t ion in Russia in BEEPS data, wh ich i s m i r ro red in a number o f other recent surveys, are 
no t obvious. 
In fact, some o f the important measures taken b y the government to combat 
administrative barriers to business date f r om the 2002-2005 period. Other measures dur ing this 
time in the budgetary sphere have increased the f isca l transparency at the federal and subnational 
levels, as documented in the 2004 ROSC o f the IMF. 

To address these indications of 

increased corruption, the government is putting i n 

25. 
place a number of initiatives. An an t i-corrup t ion program o f sorts i s beg inn ing to take shape. One 
in i t ia t ive i s a comprehensive examination o f ex is t ing leg is la t ion in many areas f r om the po in t o f 
v iew o f c los ing loopholes f o r corrupt practices. The President has recently in i t ia ted ma jo r 
administrative shakeups in the Customs Service and some reg iona l administrations. 
The 
administrative reform, wh ich had been stalled since problems in imp lemen ta t ion emerged in 2004, 
has received some new momen tum in 2006. The re fo rm in loca l self-government also has po ten t ia l 
importance fo r strengthening accountability t o the public and c i v i l society at the loca l level. 

Cha l lenges i n t h e So c i a l Sector a n d Soc ia l Services 

26. 

Russia’s ma in challenges in the social sphere w i l l be sustaining the momentum in 
poverty reduction under less favorable conditions, and improving the delivery of social services, 
particularly i n health, education, housing, and social assistance. These tw o goals are closely 

related. An impor tan t dimension o f Russian poverty i s an increasingly problematic access to 
qua l i ty social services f o r poorer segments o f the popu la t ion due t o sharp increases in fo rma l and 
in fo rma l costs. Russia’s new strategic orientation toward the active support o f g row th points brings 
new challenges f o r ensuring m in ima l welfare and opportunities f o r citizens in less fortunate 
regions, wh i le the feas ib i l i ty o f m igra t ion to wealthier areas depends on improvements in hous ing 
and other social services i n high g row th areas. The terr i tor ia l concentration o f poverty i s expected 
to increase. Poverty i s already s ign i f ican t ly concentrated in the republics o f the Southern Federal 
Okrug, where po l i t ica l and social ins tab i l i ty i s a c r i t ica l prob lem . (In the republics o f the Nor thern 
Caucusus, per capita GRP in 2004 was be low US $ 1560, and unemployment rates are common ly in 
the range o f 20 percent.) Un favorab le demographic trends place an additional burden on health and 
pensions. Russia s t i l l has far to go in developing a social safety net, p rov id ing e f fec t ive social 
services, and assisting the resettlement and re tra in ing o f a large part o f the labor force. Thus, the 
social sector has become a very h i g h p r io r i ty fo r the government in i t s current Na t iona l Projects and 
planned reforms in the government Med ium -Te rm Program. 

Poverty and social services are particular challenges for regional and local levels of 

27. 
government. The d iv is ion o f budgetary responsibility delegates respons ib i l i ty fo r most o f the 
social sphere to the reg iona l and loca l levels o f government. T h i s can be associated w i t h a basic 
f inanc ia l tension, as r icher regions typ ica l ly have more resources f o r social support than do poorer 
regions. The government corrects this, to some degree, through a transfer system that gives special 
p r io r i ty t o the poorest regions. W h i l e federal programs are impor tan t f o r lead ing reforms i n the 
social sphere, reg iona l and l o c a l in i t ia t ives are, and w i l l con t inue to be, c r i t ica l f o r addressing 
poverty and imp rov ing social services. Th is i s par t icu lar ly t r u e as the new r e f o rm in f isca l 
federalism gives regions and mun ic ipa l i t ies considerably more f l e x i b i l i t y o n the expenditure sides 
o f their budgets. In this context, a number o f regions are already fo rg ing ahead in social re form , 

Annex 2

inc lud ing N i z h n y i Novgorod, Samara, Tomsk, and Chuvashia. Federal re forms in the social sphere 
w i l l most l i k e l y be increasingly focused o n reg iona l pilots, in i t ia t ives , and co-financing. 

28. 
Russia’s unfavorable demographic trends present threats to future welfare and the 
provision of social services in add i t ion t o the labor supply issues emphasized above. Fo r i t s leve l 
o f income and development, the Russian Federation s t i l l exh ib i ts d is turb ing ly l o w indicators o f l i f e 
expectancy and mo rb id i ty . Furthermore, these indicators have yet shown l i t t l e improvement over 
the per iod o f economic g row th since 1999. N e w epidemics o f H I V / A I D S and tuberculosis present 
ma jor additional threats. An aging and dec l in ing popu la t ion promise to place an ever greater 
burden on the already strained pension and hea l th care systems. 

29. 
Concern about the health system h a s led government to p lac ing it among its major 
priorities. M a j o r structural weaknesses in the health care system inc lude an overemphasis on 
hospitals re la t ive t o pr imary care and disease prevention, poor mon i to r ing o f health risks and the 
qua l i ty o f services, an ine f f ic ien t d is t r ibu t ion o f health workers across geographic areas, l o w pay 
for a large number o f medical professionals, a shortage o f modem equipment, l i t t l e budgetary 
f l e x i b i l i t y at the mun ic ipa l level, and an under-funded na t iona l insurance system. Indeed, increases 
in mo r ta l i ty and mo rb id i ty rates are par t icu lar ly concentrated among the poor. Russia exceeds most 
other countries, including those o f the EU, in per capita numbers o f doctors, nurses, other hosp i ta l 
personnel, hospital beds, and average lengths o f hospital stays. Yet i t lags beh ind in most other 
areas, most par t icu lar ly in health p romo t ion and disease prevention.

Access to quality education may be declining for a large segment of the population for 
similar reasons to that of health care. The public education system in Russian i s burdened no t 
on ly w i t h insu f f ic ien t funding in many areas, but w i t h a large ly out-of-date adm in is tra t ion and 
structure inherited f r om the Soviet period. The government has so far created insu f f ic ien t 
incentives and opportunities f o r im p r o v i n g and modern iz ing education programs. There i s s t i l l a 
specialized public education and the needs o f the market. Government i s also turn ing i t s attention 
t o the need fo r imp rov ing the qua l i ty o f school education and student’s learn ing outcomes, and to 
evidence o f a decline in qua l i ty education f o r poorer segments o f the population. N ew government 
in i t ia t ives address such impor tan t issues as the social status o f teachers and the in troduc t ion o f I C T 
in education. Finance f o r education i s grow ing . But the e f fec t o f the additional money w i l l be 
l im i t e d i f Russia does not succeed in modern iz ing i t s large ly out-of-date adm in is tra t ion and 
curriculum 

31. 
The social assistance system remains regressive. The recent WB Russian Poverty 
Assessment and other studies based on new (Nobus) data reveal Russia’s system o f social 
assistance t o be one o f the most regressive among trans i t ion countries. The vast ma jo r i ty o f 
benefits accrue to particular social groups o f the popu la t ion that have a rather l o w corre la t ion to 
true re la t ive needs in social support. First attempts t o address this prob lem though the mone t iza t ion 
o f in kind benefits in early 2005 met w i t h strong social resistance f r om the groups that had been 
rece iv ing such benefits, most par t icu lar ly pensioners. Thus, the creation o f a more e f f ic ien t 
targeted system o f social assistance i s l im i t e d no t on ly b y technical, but b y soc io-po l i t ica l 
complications. Better measurement o f pover ty and the iden t i f ica t ion o f the poor at the reg iona l 
leve l are key tasks in this regard. 

32. 
Hous ing and communal services in Russia represent a complex web of subsidies, local 
government control, and entry barriers to private business. The qua l i ty o f services i s o f ten 
exceedingly low , and shortages o f affordable hous ing appear to be a pr imary constraint to v i t a l l y 
needed m igra t ion to areas o f high g row th and potential. T h e massive pr iva t iza t ion o f i n d i v i d u a l 
apartments to occupants in the 1990s distributed enormous benefits to those l i v i n g in modem urban 
areas and centers o f economic growth. Ye t those l i v i n g i n l e s s attractive o r p rom is ing areas are 
common ly trapped b y the unava i lab i l i ty o f hous ing elsewhere that i s affordable to them. 

33. 
Wh i le Russia stands well relative to many other countries with respect to gender 
equality, the most prominent political and professional positions in the country are still male 

A n n e x 2 
Page 10 o f 13 
dominated. Russia’s accomplishments are par t icu lar ly v is ib le in education. As many Russian 
women today obtain a h igher education as men. In the labor market, despite clear constitutional 
guarantees and other lega l safeguards, women eam less , are concentrated in l o w pa id sectors and 
under-represented in managerial positions. A recent comprehensive study o f b y the Amer ican Bar 
Association, supported b y U S A I D , concludes that Russian women also s t i l l face a re la t ive ly h igh 
degree o f domestic violence and harassment o n the job . A new government in i t ia t ive greatly 
expands guaranteed ma tern i ty benefits f o r women, although this cou ld actually have problematic 
side effects f o r d iscr im ina t ion against women in employment. 

Russia’s G l o b a l Ro l e a n d I n t e g r a t i o n in to t h e World E conom y 

Russia’s prospects depend very much on i t s integrahon into the world economy. The 

34. 
recent wo r ld development experience strongly supports the no t ion that deep in tegra t ion i n t o w o r l d 
markets i s a key to achieving and sustaining rap id economic grow th . The speed and degree o f 
integration should have a d irec t effect o n the pace o f ins t i tu t iona l development in Russia, 
particularly w i t h regards to competition, the development o f the know ledge economy, and the 
transparency and openness o f business practices. 
In tegra t ion w i t h w o r l d markets i s also a key 
cond i t ion f o r attracting fo re ign investment. The degree o f in tegra t ion o f Russia in the w o r l d 
economy has g rown considerably in recent years, and shou ld continue to g row f o l l ow i n g the 
country’s accession i n t o the WTO , although the structure o f Russia’s in tegra t ion in w o r l d trade i s 
s t i l l strongly skewed toward energy and metals exports. 

35. 
Fore ign competition has been a primary motivating factor for 
restructuring, 
productivity increases, and innovation in the Russian economy. G i v e n the high domestic 

concentration o f production, and l im i t e d domestic compe t i t ion in many markets, a pr imary source 
o f competitive pressure in Russia has come f r om fore ign markets. 
In the 1990s, this pressure 
created a dilemma f o r many f inanc ia l constrained and un-restructured Russian f irms . Yet, the 
Investment C l ima te Survey con f irms that Russia f irms fac ing more compe t i t ive pressures, including 
fore ign competition, are l i k e l y to be more productive and more innova t ive than other Russian f irms . 
The knowledge-based ( innova t ion) economy i s very much a g loba l marketplace, where very high 
integration i s w o r l d markets i s a necessary cond i t ion f o r success. 

WTO accession is a n important step towards integration. 

36. 
In recent years, preparation 
f o r WTO accession has been a pr imary mo t iva t ing factor f o r Russia t o a l ign i t s leg is la t ion and 
standards w i t h w o r l d requirements in many areas. The effect has already been quite pos i t ive on 
Russia’s markets and in tegra t ion w i t h the w o r l d economy. A recent W o r l d Bank study estimates 
that benefits f r om pursuing and achieving W T O accession cou ld amount to as much as U S $ 19 
b i l l i o n dollars in med ium te rm benefits. 
In add i t ion to direct benefits, W T O accession i s an 
important stepping stone towa rd f r e e trade and other agreements that promise to deepen Russia’s 
integration in w o r l d markets. 

Zmproving corporate governance significantly depends on economic integration. 

37. 
Russia boasts generally progressive standards and laws in the area o f corporate governance that 
m i r ro r best international practice, and the improvement o f standards and laws i s continuing. 
Nevertheless, Russia continues to suffer f r om problems in the openness o f in forma t ion , the 
protection o f m ino r i ty shareholder rights, and the overa l l transparency o f business. Prospects f o r 
the greater in tegra t ion o f Russia in the w o r l d economy, and the related need f o r a favorable 
international business reputation, prov ide quite strong incentives f o r Russian corporations to 
improve their corporate governance practices, even above and beyond what i s prescribed b y l aw 
and recommended national standards. 

Russia’s role as G8 member and donor is growing, and is in the process of developing 

38. 
capacity for effective development a id . Improved economic performance and g row ing in terna t iona l 
concerns over energy security have elevated Russia’s ro le as a G-8 member and emerging donor. 
The 2006 G8 Presidency has granted Russia a unique oppor tun i ty f o r active invo lvemen t in the 
po l icy dialogue on impor tan t g loba l and reg iona l issues, f o r p rov id ing ma jo r inputs, and f o r tak ing 

Annex 2 
Page 11 o f 13 

the lead on specific themes and agendas. Russia has par t ic ipa ted in full in the H IPC in i t ia t ive and 
announced additional debt reduc t ion through A f r i c a debt f o r development swap (in collaboration 
w i t h the W o r l d Bank). I t has made contributions to the A v i a n F l u e G loba l Program, E F M I and 
GVEP programs, and has made a comm i tmen t to scale up i t s development support. However, 
Russia i s s t i l l in the stage o f de term in ing i t s ow n strategic pos i t ion in the donor commun i ty , and 
w i l l continue to build relevant capacity. 

39. 
Russia’s size gives it a unique role in the global economy, including the management 
of environmental, energy and forest resources. A l though Russia presently uses energy much less 
e f f ic ien t ly than most indus tr ia l ized countries, 
i t has ra t i f ied the K y o t o Protocol, 
thereby 
demonstrating i t s comm i tmen t to combat g loba l c l ima te change. There i s great scope f o r Russia to 
reduce carbon emissions through e f f ic iency gains and reduced energy losses, resulting also in gains 
to the loca l economy. Russia accounts f o r 22% o f the wor ld ’s forest area. Russian forest p o l i c y 
states a commitment to balance conservation and development goals. Russia cou ld p r o f i t 
s ign i f ican t ly f r om an e f fo r t t o increase transparency and reduce i l lega l activities in the forestry 
sector, and the government has articulated such goals. There are also opportunities f o r imp roved 
coordination w i t h Western Europe and the timber impo r t ing countries o f East Asia. 

Regional issues 

40. 
The 88 regions of the Russian Federation exhibit considerable geographic, ethnic and 
economic diversity. Poverty headcount rates vary f r om 3 percent o f the popu la t ion (Saint 
Petersburg) t o 56 percent (Dagestan). Among the 88 Russian regions (Subjects o f the Federation) 
as o f 2004, 60 had gross regional product (GRP) levels that w o u l d qua l i fy them f o r status as l ow - 
middle income countries, wh i le 14 w o u l d have I D A - l i k e status. H a l f o f these I D A - l i k e regions 
correspond to the ethnic republics o f the Nor thern Caucuses. Poorer regions also inc lude the non- 
Russian ethnic republics o f Tyva (Eastern Siberia), A l t a i (Western Siberia), Marii E l (Vo lga area), 
and Chuvashia (Vo lga area), as w e l l as other agr icu l tura l or indus tr ia l regions in various parts o f the 
country (such as Ivanovo, Penza, Kurgan, Pskov). W h i l e many o f the poor ethnic republics o f the 
Nor thern Caucuses have strong g row th potential (agriculture, surplus labor, tourism) that i s 
curren t ly constrained b y po l i t ica l and ethnic conflicts, other c o l d and geographically remote 
settlements in the N o r t h and East o f Russia arguably face an even more problematic economic 
future. 

41. 
Since the m id- I990s , the cities of Moscow and Saint Petersburg have emerged and 
strong points of growth and agglomeration, which has spilled over to some surrounding regions, 
most particularly to the Moscow and Leningrad oblasts. Other regions that have achieved GRP 
and income levels s im i lar to Moscow and Saint Petersburg are p r ima r i ly those r i c h in resources or 
ma jor metals producers. The tw o richest regions in Russia are the o i l and gas r i c h autonomous 
Okrugs o f Khan ty-Mans isk and Yamal-Nenetsk. Other leaders in GRP per capita inc lude resource- 
r i c h Chukotka, Sakha (Yakun t i ia) , Sakhalin, Tomsk, and K om i , as w e l l as steel-producing Vo logda 
and Lipetsk. In recen t years, wh i le a number o f regions have exh ib i ted notable dynamism, n o c i t y 
has yet distinguished i tse l f as an alternative g row th agglomeration po in t to M o s c ow or Saint 
Petersburg. The emergence o f other such cities w i l l be an impor tan t milestone in Russian economic 
development.

42. 
The collapse of the Soviet Un ion in the 1990s led to enormous regional differentiation 
within Russia, but the in it ia l period of economic recovery from the 1998 crisis favored rapid 
growth and poverty reduction i n many poorer Russian regions. The huge decline in Russian 

industry o f the 1990s brough t substantial pover ty and hardship t o indus tr ia l regions, wh i le those 
regions r i c h in natural resources fared much better. F o l l ow i n g the 1998 c r i s i s , however, a 
depreciated ruble, huge excess capacity, and cheap labor supported broad-based economic growth, 
par t icu lar ly in the indus tr ia l regions that had experienced very rap id decline in the 1990s. Loss- 
mak ing indus tr ia l firms w i t h excess capacity suddenly became pro f i tab le . During this time, on 
average, poorer regions had even more success in poverty reduc t ion than their richer counterparts. 
M a n y the poorest regions experienced average annual g row th rates above 6 percent dur ing the 

per iod 1998-2002.

However, a strong trend toward regional inequality w i l l likely resurface. The factors 

43. 
that supported this rap id and reg iona l ly broad-based g row th (a weak ruble, cheap energy and labor, 
excess produc t ive capacity) have n ow disappeared. S trong differences among Russian regions, 
re f lec t ing the Soviet legacy o f settlements that bear l i t t l e re la t ion t o economic comparative 
advantage, suggest that reg iona l inequa l i ty w i l l l i k e l y become an increasingly acute problem. 

 
A n n e x 2 
Page 13 o f 13 
Recent indus tr ia l produc t ion data c o n f i rm a rather unequal p ic ture in this regard, and are consistent 
w i t h possible g row ing reg iona l disparities. W h i l e almost a l l regions experienced strong industrial 
g row th dur ing the per iod o f economic recovery, 11 o f 88 regions experienced indus tr ia l grow th o f 
less than 1 percent in 2004, and 9 o f these regions showed negative indus tr ia l growth. In 2005, 23 
regions reported indus tr ia l g row th o f less that 1 percent, and 15 Subjects o f the Federation 
experienced industrial declines re la t ive t o the same pe r iod o f the prev ious year.

44. 
An emerging national strategy for regional development places emphasis on creating 
and supporting points of agglomeration and growth. The Russian government recognizes that 
achieving d ivers i f ied g row th w i l l requ ire the forma t ion o f g row th agglomerations in urban areas 
other than Moscow and Saint Petersburg. Re la t ive to other indus tr ia l ized countries, Russia has too 
few large cities. G iven the inher i ted Sov ie t legacy, the new strategy, as re f lec ted in the Medium- 
Term Government Program, acknowledges that reg iona l ly equitable g row th throughout the Russian 
Federation i s un l ike ly , and the fac i l i ta t ion o f more r a p i d internal m ig ra t ion w i l l be c r i t ica l to the 
g row th and welfare prospects o f the coun try in years to come.

INTRODUCTION 

1. 
The FYO3-05 C A S presented a comprehensive program o f assistance at a t ime when the Bank’s 
relationship w i t h the Russian Federation was undergoing a s ign i f ican t transformation. At the start o f the 
CAS preparation process, there had been very good progress in a t ta in ing macroeconomic s tab i l i ty and the 
economy was show ing signs o f sustained growth. The Government indicated that i t n o longer needed 
budget support but wished to ava i l i tse l f more o f the Bank ’s knowledge and technical expertise. 
Accord ing ly , in the CAS , the Bank proposed considerable changes in the way we did business in Russia, 
among them a greater shift to analytical and advisory ac t iv i t ies (AAA). A number o f reports were 
produced and w ide ly disseminated that helped the Government to shape i t s development agenda, 
inc lud ing the quarterly Russia Econom ic Report, a study o n the economic impac t o f A IDS , a Coun try 
Economic Memorandum and a w ide rang ing Poverty Assessment. A Q A G rev iew o f the Bank ’s AAA 
noted the very s ign i f ican t impac t o f a l l this w o r k (see be low) . The CAS also projected a shift in the 
Bank’s lend ing to the Russian Federation f r om budget support operations to a comb ina t ion o f investment 
and technical assistance loans. Under the Base Case scenario, the CAS projected seventeen projects and a 
lend ing volume on the order o f $1.8 b i l l i o n . Russia’s extraordinary growth, sound macroeconomic 
management, and substantial o i l revenues du r ing the C A S period, however, obviated the need f o r this 
leve l o f bo r row ing (see below), and thus Bank lend ing was somewhat lowe r than projected, i.e. 10 
projects to ta l ing $1.2 b i l l i o n (or 12 projects f o r $1.4 m i l l i o n f o r the extended C A S per iod inc lus ive o f 
FY2006). Consistent w i t h the imp roved economic prospects in Russia dur ing the C A S pe r iod and the 
need iden t i f ied in the CAS f o r pr iva te sector investments in support o f d ivers i f ica t ion , b o t h I F C and 
MIGA s ign i f ican t ly increased their presence; Russia i s n ow IFC ’ s and MIGA’s largest coun try exposure.

RUSSIA’S LONG TERM STRATEGIC GOALS 

2. 
Russia’s current formu la t ion o f i t s l o n g term strategic goals dates f r om 2000 when President-to- 
be -V lad im i r Putin asked a group o f Russian reformers to prepare a strategic plan. T h i s became k n ow n as 
the “Gref Plan” (after German Gref, later the M i n i s t e r o f Econom ic Development and Trade), and 
identified a series o f reforms in v i r tua l ly a l l areas o f the economy (and in many instances f o l l ow i n g the 
recommendations o f S A L IV, wh ich was appraised b y the Bank , but no t imp lemen ted due to Russia’s 
imp roved f isca l stance). A key milestone was l a i d in Ju ly 2001, when the Government began to 
imp lemen t i t s M e d i um T e rm Program o f Social and Econom ic Development f o r 2002-2004 (MTP ) , 
essentially a con t inua t ion o f the Gref Plan. T h e M T P was appropriate f o r addressing Russia’s 
development challenges: i t was w e l l conceived, d raw ing on the v is ion o f the G r e f Plan but o f fe r ing 
concrete proposals, and i t had the support o f Government. The Program had also been w ide ly discussed 
(and w e l l received) in Russia. Subsequently, Mr. Pu t in w ide ly announced the strategic goa l o f doub l ing 
the GDP in 10 years and ha lv ing o f pover ty b y 2007 that at the end o f the C A S per iod were f o l l ow e d up 
w i t h the so called national projects in health, education, hous ing and agriculture that are financed b y the 
Government.

The Medium Term Program was implemented during - and benefited f r om - a per iod o f 
unprecedented g row th and transformation in the Russian economy. Econom ic g row th and overa l l 
macroeconomic performance in Russia since 2002 have w e l l exceeded even the C A S high case scenario 
(Table 1). Three factors p r inc ipa l ly exp la in this performance. First, high commod i ty export prices, 
par t icu lar ly f o r o i l and gas augmented investment resources, stimulated domestic demand, prov ided the 
government w i t h w i n d f a l l revenues, and prevented a weakening o f the current account in the context o f 
rap id impo r t growth. Second, sound macroeconomic management also p layed a c ruc ia l role. In 2005, the 
federal budget w i l l register a surplus f o r the s ix th consecutive year. The federal and consolidated budgets 
have generated sizeable surpluses, and gross fore ign reserves o f the Central Bank soared f r om US$35 
b i l l i o n to US$182 b i l l i o n between January 2002 and December 2005. Third, monetary and exchange rate 
po l icy kep t b o t h in f la t ion and the real appreciation o f the rub le at moderate leve ls The consumer pr ice 
in f la t ion has fa l len throughout the period, f r om 15 p.a. in 2002 to 10.9 p.a. in 2005.

The M e d i um Term Program was a prescription f o r deep structural change in fou r key areas o f the 
economy. The ma jor objectives o f the Program were: (a) reduce pover ty levels and income differentials; 
(b) achieve economic modernization and improvement in enterprise e f f ic iency ; (c) imp rove f isca l 
efficiency; (d) reduce reg iona l d i f feren t ia t ion in social and economic development. The areas o f focus fo r 
the FYO3-05 C A S were strongly aligned w i t h the Government strategic goals o f g row th and pover ty 
reduction. T h e C A S had three ma in themes: strengthening public sector management, im p r o v i n g the 
business environment, and m i t iga t ing social and environmental risks. In retrospect, these strategic p i l lars 
o f the CAS were correc t ly iden t i f ied , wh ich contributed to a high degree o f Government ownership, and 
remain relevant f o r the future Bank 's wo rk in Russia. 

5. 

Progress was achieved in a l l areas targeted b y the Government, but, as cou ld be expected, these 
advances were uneven and a sustained l o n g term implementation e f fo r t i s s t i l l needed. Throughout this 
period, the Government wou ld norma l ly p i c k up one theme as a focus fo r a certain per iod o f time wh ich 
facilitated achievement o f specific results. However , eventually some o f the re forms fa i led to achieve 
their full benefits due to incomplete implementation, bureaucratic opposition, o r other imp lemen ta t ion 
bottlenecks. Examples wou ld include, but are no t l im i t e d to the pension re form , administrative reform, 
reducing administrative barriers f o r business, tax and housing reforms. M o r e specifically, these reforms, 
accomplishments and failures inc lude : 

Reduce poverty levels and income differentials. D u r i n g the CAS per iod l i v i n g standards increased 
along w i t h grow th . Labor income suffered in particular f r om the 1998 crisis, but recovered qu ick ly 
and has been g row ing strongly s ince 2000. The real disposable income o f households surpassed pre- 
c r i s i s levels already in 2003. G r ow t h has been pro-poor. O f f i c i a l statistics ind ica te that the poverty 
headcount declined f r om a peak o f 30 percent in early 1999 to just b e l ow 16 percent in 2005. 
However, these improvements concentrated in more economically v ibran t parts o f Russia and

Achieve economic modernization and improvement i n en terpr ise efficiency. Macroeconomic stability, 
combined w i t h key reforms in areas such as taxation and de-bureaucratization, have supported an 
improvement in enterprise e f f ic iency and created m u c h more favorable conditions f o r pr iva te 
investment. A l l three leading ra t ing agencies have granted Russia an investment grade rating. 
Greater investor confidence i s evident in an acceleration o f f i x e d cap i ta l forma t ion ( f r om 2.6 percent 
grow th in 2002 to 10.5 percent in 2005) and in an expansion o f fore ign direct investment (FDI) b y 70 
percent in 2003, 39 percent in 2004, and another 39 percent in 2005. A l though the h igher leve l o f 
capital investment and FDI in particular have con tr ibu ted to economic modernization the re la t ive 
investment leve l remains rather l o w compared to other emerging and developing economies, 

Improve f i s c a l e f f ic iency . A considerably imp roved f isca l management has been one o f the most 
impor tan t achievements o f the Government wh ich greatly assisted the macroeconomic stabilization 
and l a i d ou t a foundation f o r the future re fo rm . S tr ic t f isca l d isc ip l ine has been enforced at a l l levels 
and an ever g row ing S tab i l iza t ion Fund, curren t ly standing at U S $ 67.2 b i l l ion , has been established 
that fortunately has no t been used as a substitute f o r imp lemen t ing reforms required to achieve long- 
term f isca l sustainability. Progress has also been made w i t h the in troduc t ion o f performance based 
budgeting, a reduc t ion in unfunded federal mandates, a f isca l federalism framework, imp roved tax 
administration, a new customs code and a modern federal treasury system. A comprehensive pension 
re fo rm was in i t ia ted in 2003, w i t h a gradual trans i t ion f r om a pay-as-you-go to a two -p i l la r system. 
The pension re form , however, d i d no t address the social and po l i t ica l v iab i l i ty o f l o w replacement 
rates, wh ich raises concerns about the long - te rm sustainability o f the system. The e f f ic iency o f public 
investment remained l ow . W h i l e the p rob lem was realized b y the Government, l i t t l e has been done to 
correct i t . T h i s i s becom ing even more impor tan t as the Government i s about to considerably increase 
public investments. 

Reduce reg iona l d i feren t ia t ion i n social and economic development. F o l l ow i n g the 1998 crisis, the 
combination o f a weak ruble and huge excess capacity supported broad-based g row th in the vast 
ma jor i ty o f Russian regions. Under these conditions, many poorer regions achieved g row th in output 
and l i v i n g standards w e l l above the national average. A new transfer formu la also succeeded to 
concentrating a larger share o f federal transfers in the poorest regions. Nevertheless, reg iona l 
disparities in Russia rema in enormous and, b y some indicators, even increased during the C A S 
period. N o w that the ruble i s n o longer weak and capacity constraints have become tighter, the 
developmental problems in many depressed regions have become greater. This w i l l continue to pose 
ma jor p o l i c y challenges in Russia fo r years to come. 

6. 
Overall, the assessment o f the program imp lemen ta t ion should be reasonably realistic in te rms o f 
h ow much can be achieved in each particular section o f the program under the p reva i l ing po l i t ica l 
conditions in Russia. 

111. 

CAS OUTCOMES 

7. 
A l though the C A S was prepared under more conservative expectations about macroeconomic 
conditions and g row th than proved to be the case, Russia’s m a i n challenges ou t l ined in the latest C A S 
rema in h i g h l y relevant. T h e C A S posited Bank support to the Russian Federation along three “strategic 
pillars”: strengthening public sector management, imp rov ing the business environment, and m i t iga t ing 
social and environmental r i s k s . Progress o n a l l these pillars has been significant, albeit uneven, and 
important un f in ished w o r k i s w ide ly acknowledged. 
8. 
There was n o exp l ic i t mon i to r ing and evaluation embedded in the CAS, and key progress 
benchmarks were no t quantified. There was, however, impor tan t mon i to r ing and evaluation in several 
sub-components, e.g. poverty, c i v i l service reform, and the business environment. And the Russia 
Economic Report, wh ich was introduced as par t o f the CAS , became a reference document f o r Russian 
and international analysts.

9 . 

This strategic p i l l a r was d irec t ly l i n k e d to the longer t e rm goa l o f im p r o v i n g economic 
modernization and enterprise e f f ic iency . Secondarily this p i l l a r had links to pover ty a l lev ia t ion . An 
expansion o f pr iva te sector ac t iv i ty - and the resu l t ing increases in g row th and employment - was seen as 
a key instrument in addressing the pover ty in Russia. Fou r C A S objectives (see be low ) were iden t i f ied . 

10. 
G iven the comb ina t ion o f the Government's desire to design and imp lemen t several p o l i c y 
reforms and i t s strong f isca l position, Bank instruments appropriately emphasized AAA. T h i s AAA 
(wh ich took several forms) had s ign i f ican t impact, in the p o l i c y realm, ins t i tu t iona l support and d irec t 
assistance to firms. W h i l e some Bank lend ing took place (partial risk guarantee, St Petersburg Econom ic 
Development and Cadastre loans), the Government indicated less interest in using i t s sovereign guarantee 
in areas where i t f e l t the guarantee was no t needed, e.g. S M E development, power sector and ra i lway 
re form . Commensurate w i t h this approach, b o t h I F C and MIGA, increased the ir activities s ign i f ican t ly . 
I F C was active in promo t ing SM E development through investment an in the f inanc ia l sector and 
technical assistance (see below). 

Progress benchmarks: 
( i ) s ign i j c an t progress towards WTO accession; 
( i i ) subsidies to na tu ra l 
monopolies decrease s ign i jcan t ly ; ( i i i ) share of FD I and SMEs in GDP and employment increases 
s ign i jcan t ly ; ( i v ) volume of commerc ia l bank lending to SMEs increases s ign i jcan t ly ; ( v ) share of 
manufacturing and services in GDP increases; ( v i ) deregu lat ion package improves the regu latory 
environment as measured in en t eq r i s e survey; ( v i i ) Go v emm en tK en t r a l Bank p rog r am j n a n c i a l sector 
reform p rog ram on track . 

11. 
Remove administrative barriers to business ac t iv i ty and investment. Evidence o f progress i s 
somewhat contradictory. Surveys o f small businesses on administrative barriers indicate noticeable 
progress. In recent years, Russian firms needed to apply f o r a fewer number o f licenses. Licenses have 
also become easier to obtain, and rema in v a l i d f o r a longer per iod o f time. However , the number o f 
i l leg i t ima te licenses s t i l l remains h igh , accounting f o r 33% o f the total. The number o f various inspections 
to wh ich Russian firms are subjected has declined b y over 20 percent. Registration o f new businesses has 
become easier. The average number o f o f f ices v is i ted f o r registration decreased f r om 5 to 4, and the 
average leng th o f the registration process has become shorter. The monetary costs o f registration have 
increased, however. T h e W o r l d Bank Group's D o i n g Business 2005 Report places Russia in the top (best) 
40 percentile o f a l l countries. Russia rates par t icu lar ly w e l l re la t ive to other countries in the reg ion in the 
ease o f registering a new business, reso lv ing a bankruptcy, and hiring and firing workers. However , the 
D o i n g Business data also suggest particular weaknesses in the disclosure o f in fo rma t ion and in indicators 
related to access to credit. A lso , as F I A S reg iona l surveys illustrate, procedures related to access to land 
and real estate do no t yet show any improvement in transparency o r e f f ic iency , and instead show 
considerable evidence o f inconsistent application o f complex procedures, w h i c h appear to deter land 
pr iva t iza t ion in practice. 

12. 
No tw i ths tand ing progress o n many components o f the business environment, Russia's re la t ive 
standing relative to other transition economies in the reg ion worsened between 2002 and 2005. In 2002, 
out o f 21 indicators mon i tored b y the Bank /EBRD Business Env ironmen t and Enterprise Performance 
Survey (BEEPS), Russia was lowe r than average f o r the rest o f the reg ion in on ly f i v e (licensing, access 
to land, registering land t i t le , tax administration, and labor s k i l l s ) . B y 2005 Russia had no t on ly fa i led to 
improve on these indicators but scored lowe r than the r e s t o f the reg ion o n f i v e add i t iona l indicators: 
po l icy uncertainty, macroeconomic risk (exchange rate), theft, organized cr ime and corrup t ion 

13. 
T h e Bank prov ided extensive support f o r investment c l ima te mon i to r ing through a survey (run b y

Country Economic Memo randum (CEM ) 2004 F r om Trans i t ion to Development, was devoted to the 
analysis o f constraints o n economic development and compe t i t ion in Russia. The Bank also regu lar ly 
published the Russia Econom ic Report (RER). Due to i t s broad dissemination, the RER’s views o n 
economic developments and re forms have received ma jo r attention f r om federal and reg iona l authorities, 
the business community, think-tanks and academia, and the media. 

14. 
At the macro level, there has also been good progress in negotiations f o r WTO accession, wh ich 
i s currently envisaged in 2007. T h e Bank prov ided support t o the Government, especially in developing 
economic models o f the impac t o f WTO membership. WB I aided this e f fo r t through h igh- impac t tra in ing 
activities such as Trade and W T O course, to organ iz ing top- leve l p o l i c y events w i t h the Cabinet o f 
M in is ters aimed at fos ter ing p o l i c y dialogue o n the competitiveness and d ivers i f ica t ion o f Russian 
economy.

En terpr ise support. No tw i ths tand ing the Government’s e f for ts at making the business 
environment more favorable t o SMEs, their par t ic ipa t ion in the economy i s s t i l l qu i te l ow . Some evidence 
( fo r example, f r om surveys in St Petersburg, Russia’s second largest c i ty ) suggests that the number o f 
SMEs i s increasing, albeit f r o m a very l o w base. Other studies c i te poor links between universities, 
research centers and firms as a reason f o r the l o w par t ic ipa t ion o f SMEs. T h i s l ow e r than expected 
presence o f SMEs in the economy may also be due to the circumstances surrounding recent economic 
growth, where a h i g h l y undervalued ruble and excess capacity con tr ibu ted to strong expor t demand and 
gave new l i f e to new ly restructured, yet w e l l established, large enterprises. The rema in ing soft budget 
constraints to large incumbent enterprises also helped many o f them t o stay afloat. The l o w enterprise ex i t 
rate distinguishes Russia f r om other transition economies, depr iv ing Russian start-ups o f po ten t ia l access 
to cheap assets, and thus hiders their creation and growth. 

16. 
Project support to enterprise development b y the Bank has been less successful. The Enterprise 
Support project inher i ted f r om previous C A S periods was closed in 2003 w i t h substantially reduced scope 
despite rad ica l project res truc tur ing after the 1998 f inanc ia l crisis. Later, the Bank prov ided a par t ia l risk 
guarantee f o r the coal and forestry sectors, however approval delays made t h i s f a c i l i t y n o t very attractive 
to businesses as access to pr iva te capital had s ign i f ican t ly imp roved during that per iod and the guarantee 
had to be eventually cancelled. At the same t ime b o t h I F C and MIGA substantially expanded the ir 
activities in Russia. 

17. 
I F C increased i t s ac t iv i t ies in Russia, w i t h an average comm i tmen t leve l f o r the C A S per iod 
reaching $588 m i l l ion , almost six t imes the FYOO-02 average. Russia i s n ow IFC ’s largest coun try 
exposure, w i t h a comm i t ted p o r t f o l i o o f 1.97 b i l l i o n (as o f June 30, 2006). 
Investments in f inanc ia l 
institutions have represented b y far the largest share o f this investment (on average h a l f o f new 
commitments each year). T h i s reflects IFC ’s strategy t o reach a broad number o f companies across a 
diverse number o f sectors, in particular SMEs, through f inanc ia l intermediaries as described further 
below. In the real sector, I F C catalyzed fore ign direct investment and supported loca l companies in a w ide 
range o f sectors, re f lec t ing the C A S objective to create conditions f o r d ivers i f ica t ion o f the economy in 
order to reduce over-reliance o n the natural resource sectors. Manu fac tu r ing and services remained a 
significant area o f focus, w i t h 26% o f new commitment vo lume supporting twe lve projects i n v o l v i n g 
fore ign investment in manu fac tur ing sectors rang ing f r om forestry-based construction materials to wh i te 
good productions and service sectors inc lud ing re ta i l and ho te l services. Addressing the C A S objective o f 
upgrading infrastructure, transport infrastructure became a s ign i f ican t new sector fo r I F C in Russia during 
the CAS per iod w i t h 11% o f new commitments f o r n ine projects w i t h pr iva te companies (a l l Russian- 
owned), operating transport b y ra i l , sea, and air. Abou t 8% o f new commitments went to the o i l , 
chemical and mining sectors, w i t h a comb ina t ion o f fore ign and loca l companies. T h e rest o f new 
commitments were in agribusiness, IT/media, and funds. In general, a s ign i f ican t increase in the po r t ion 
o f funding go ing to Russian-owned companies reflects the recommendation made in the Coun try Impac t 
Review to increase e f for ts to finance Russian companies. 

18. 
I n technical assistance, as planned in the CAS , I F C supported enterprises through the Pr iva te 
Enterprise Partnership’s (PEP’) wo rk w i t h almost 2000 companies in St. Petersburg, Rostov-on-Don,

Yekaterinburg, Samara, and Moscow to imp rove their corporate governance practices. PEP surveyed 129 
o f these clients and found that 80% had made at least one corporate governance improvement, and those 
surveyed had already attracted more than $280 m i l l i o n in add i t iona l investment and attributed this 
substantially to corporate governance improvements. O n the na t iona l level, the program worked w i t h 
Russia’s Federal Securities Comm iss ion to dra f t and d is tr ibu te Russia’s first national corporate 
governance code and w i t h the Russian Parliament on six d i f feren t laws and regulations related to 
corporate governance. T h i s w o r k o n the federal leve l was done in coord ina t ion w i t h the OECD, W o r l d 
Bank and G loba l Corporate Governance Forum. The program also sought to raise public awareness o f 
the importance o f good corporate governance and the pro tec t ion o f shareholders’ r igh ts and worked w i t h 
24 educational ins t i tu t ions to introduce corporate governance topics i n t o l aw and management courses. 
Through PEP, I FC also supported companies in key sectors, inc lud ing forestry, IT, automotive 
component suppliers, and mining to better meet the need o f their buyers and to attract investment. 

19. MIGA prov ided guarantees to support investment in the financial, water, mining, manufacturing 
and agribusiness sectors. I t also worked w i t h several regions o f Russia o n the development o f the ir 
investment promo t ion capacity. Russia i s curren t ly MIGA’s largest exposure. As o f June 2006, the 
Agency’s net exposure in Russia was US$211 m i l l ion , or about 6.4% o f the total net exposure. 

20. 
MIGA has been wo rk ing w i t h loca l o f f ic ia ls and reg iona l investment p romo t ion agencies t o 
iden t i fy opportunities to stimulate FDI and increase loca l economic benefits through supporting image 
building f o r the regions, investor servicing and investor outreach and targeted marke t ing to rev i ta l ize 
ex is t ing industry. A MIGA p i l o t pro jec t to generate projects f r om Russian companies inves t ing in C IS 
countries was implemented to build a p ipe l ine o f South-South guarantees. The project aimed at 
s t imu la t ing pr iva te business ac t iv i ty o f Russian companies and strengthening their compe t i t ive advantage. 

2 1. 
Restructure p r io r i ty sectors (infrastructure monopolies, hous ing and communal services) and 
pr iva t ize agr icu l tura l land. Progress has been m ixed . The Government launched a housing and communa l 
services r e f o rm in 2003 that i s n ow ga in ing momentum. In general there has been good progress in land 
and rea l estate markets, w i t h impor tan t support f r om Bank loans in support o f land registration and the 
real estate market. B o t h urban and agr icu l tura l land can n ow be sold, and land markets are emerging in 
large cities. As a result o f the L A R I S pro jec t (US$SO m i l l ion ) , some 14 percent o f a l l the rayons in Russia 
were supplied w i t h automated land registration systems and about 90 percent o f a l l land in those rayons i s 
now inven tor ied fo r purposes o f the state cadastre. Over 60 percent o f a l l cadastre enterprises were 
supplied w i t h modem d ig i ta l equipment. The recently approved Cadastre project (US$lOO m i l l i o n ) and 
Registration project (US$50 m i l l i o n ) w i l l extend these achievements throughout Russia and w i l l link 
them w i t h modernized property registration. In the same vein, the St. Petersburg Econom ic Development 
project (US$161.1 m i l l i o n ) i s supporting the development o f the land and real estate market in the c i ty . 

22. 
Progress in the area o f natural monopolies, however, has been more l im i ted . Though ta r i f fs are 
be ing gradually increased toward long - run marg ina l costs, p r ice subsidies rema in substantial. A strategy 
was been approved f o r re fo rm ing the e lec tr ic i ty sector in wh ich po ten t ia l ly compe t i t ive parts o f the 
generation and d is tr ibu t ion systems are to be unbundled f r om RAO UES (Un i ted Energy Systems - the 
national e lec tr ic i ty monopoly), but implementation, though w i t h some TA assistance f r om the E lec t r ic i ty 
Sector R e f o rm Project, has been slow due to po l i t ica l reasons and oppos i t ion in the Parliament. A s im i lar 
restructuring has been developed f o r the ra i lway system, and i s in the i n i t i a l stage o f implementation. 
However , there i s s t i l l n o progress in the re fo rm o f Gazprom, the natural gas monopo ly . T h e Bank 
prov ided advice on these restructurings, through imp lemen ta t ion o f ex is t ing loans and p o l i c y notes. W h i l e 
new loans in support o f the sectoral reforms were discussed w i t h the Government (though no t in the case 
o f Gazprom), the Government decided no t to seek Bank financing. 

23. 
Bottlenecks o f the communal services sector has been dealt w i t h through the already closed 
Enterprise Hous ing D ives t i ture project and on-go ing M u n i c i p a l Hea t ing and M u n i c i p a l Water projects. 
However, the implementation progress has been slow due to the design susceptible to reg iona l 
creditworthiness risks, cumbersome on- lend ing arrangements w i t h m u l t i p l e medium and small size cities, 
in troduc t ion o f pr iva te operators f o r water fac i l i t ies in the m idd le o f the project, etc. A lso , recent federally 
mandated caps on t a r i f f increases created certain r i s k s f o r the cost recovery o f these large ly mun ic ipa l

enterprises. The implementation o f the hous ing re fo rm w i l l be further supported b y the Hous ing and 
Communa l Services project that w i l l comb ine a competitive grant scheme f o r more r e f o rm oriented 
regions w i t h the subsequent imp lemen ta t ion o f investment programs in w i n i n g regions. 

24. 
Imp rove f inanc ia l intermediation. 
During the CAS the Bank sought to develop a stronger 
relationship w i t h the Central Bank o f Russia, in a j o i n t FSAP w i t h the IMF, and fo l low -up p r ima r i ly 
through in forma l , “just-in-time’’ advice. T h i s was appropriate g iven the state o f the f inanc ia l sector in 
Russia and the lack o f in te res t in the Government fo r a f inanc ia l sector loan. 

25. 
T h e Government’s bank ing sector r e f o rm program i s n ow in i t s fou r th year. The program 
accelerated substantially after the approval o f an ambitious revised r e f o rm agenda b y the Government in 
Ju ly 2004. T h i s was fo l lowed b y the Duma’s approval o f several impor tan t amendments to laws, 
inc lud ing changes in bankruptcy procedures fo r banks, the strengthening o f the Central Bank ’s 
enforcement powers, and measures to smooth the transition to a deposit insurance system. In general, the 
Russian ban lung sector has been deve lop ing at a rap id pace. G row th in commerc ia l bank assets, capital, 
and credit has w e l l outpaced GDP grow th . Accord ing to the CBR, between January 2001 and January 
2005, commercial bank assets increased f r om 32 to 42 percent o f GDP, aggregate bank capital f r om 4 to 6 
percent, and outstanding credit to the non- f inanc ia l sector f r om 11 to 18 percent ( to be updated - 
S.Ulatov). A par t icu lar ly rap id expansion o f longer- term lend ing reflects g row ing ac t iv i ty o f commercial 
banks in f inanc ing f i x e d capital investment, although the share o f bank cred i t in investment finance i s s t i l l 
be low 6 percent. 

26. 
Despite the recen t growth, the leve l o f f inanc ia l intermediation in Russia remains l o w in absolute 
terms, and creating a stable and e f fec t ive pr iva te bank ing sector w i l l requ ire substantial add i t iona l e f fo r t 
and determination o n the part o f the C B R and the Government in future years. This includes addressing 
the weaknesses o f the bank reso lu t ion process, con t inu ing strengthening o f the supervisory framework, 
and imp rov ing the balance between pr iva te and state-owned banks. De lays in the p r iva t iza t ion o f state- 
owned banks rema in a cause f o r concern, as these delays slow improvements in the e f f ic iency o f f inanc ia l 
intermediation in Russia. 

27. 
I n spite o f the con t inu ing dom ina t ion o f the sector b y state-owned ins t i tu t ions , I F C was able to 
p lay a s ign i f ican t ro le in the development o f pr iva te f inanc ia l institutions. I F C comm i t ted $850 m i l l i o n to 
20 bank ing and leasing projects during the C A S period. As planned in the CAS , most o f these projects 
were w i t h medium-sized banks, par t icu lar ly those w i t h SME c l ien ts . 
I F C was able to introduce more 
advanced f inanc ia l products to loca l banks, such as subordinated debt and loca l currency finance. I F C i s 
also p rov id ing the smaller reg iona l banks w i t h advisory services on corporate governance through PEP 
w i t h a focus on special topics such as Base1 2 and operational risk management. A number o f the p i l o t 
banks in the I FC PEP program are already imp lemen t ing key corporate governance changes and attracting 
investment. I n addition, the project has p rov ided advisory assistance to the M i n i s t r y f o r Econom ic Trade 
and Development fo r the development o f a new l aw on the corporate registrar system. 

28. 
The promo t ion o f new products, inc lud ing housing finance and leasing, has also fo l lowed the 
l i n e s o f the CAS . During the CAS period, I F C also began to p lay a large ro le in the hous ing finance 
market, supporting banks w i t h b o t h f inanc ing and TA, as w e l l as p rov id ing advice to create the conditions 
f o r securitizations. The hous ing finance TA prov ided through PEP has consolidated indus try e f for ts b y 
creating a wo rk ing group o f over 74 stakeholders to iden t i fy key issues in the Russian mortgage indus try 
and j o i n t l y develop solutions. The PEP hous ing finance project, f o r example, has created the first standard 
mortgage note wh ich i s presently being tested b y p i l o t banks and government agencies. 

29. 
Technical assistance f o r leasing i s mos t ly completed, but investments have continued, w i t h f i v e 
investments in the CAS per iod inc lud ing one focused on the Russian Far East and Siberia. In leasing, 
consumer lending, and hous ing finance, I F C made tw o large loans to in terna t iona l banks to expand the 
operation o f their Russian subsidiaries, bringing international expertise and best practice to the market. 
One area that was no t i n i t i a l l y iden t i f ied in the CAS, but later became part o f IFC ’s strategy in the 
Russian f inanc ia l sector, was to support the pr iva t iza t ion o f state-owned banks through pre-pr iva t iza t ion 

A n n e x C 

Page 8 o f 17 

investments. Unfortunately, these privatizations did no t proceed, and I F C has discontinued this strategy 
f o r the t ime being. 

30. 
Another new area o f advisory w o r k in the f inanc ia l sector i s energy e f f ic iency ; PEP has launched 
a program comb in ing dedicated I F C cred i t l ines f o r energy e f f ic iency w i t h technical assistance. The f i r s t 
credit l i n e f o r energy e f f ic iency allocated under the program in Southern Russia in FY06 i s already f u l l y 
disbursed to sub-projects. A number o f banks are expected to become a part o f this program dur ing the 
new CAS period. 

Pillar 2 : Improve Public Sector Management 

31. 
This strategic p i l l a r was linked to the Government’s goals o f economic modernization and f isca l 
efficiency. T h e Government was clear in i t s in ten t ion to strengthen and trans form government as an 
integral par t o f a modem market economy. The correctly focused o n k e y federal leve l agencies where 
there was an appetite f o r r e f o rm and a need f o r sound pro jec t imp lemen ta t ion . K e y C A S objectives are 
h igh l igh ted be low . 

32. 
B o t h Bank lend ing and AAA p layed an impor tan t role. O n the former, the Bank correctly focused 
on a number o f federal leve l functions (tax, treasury, customs, and f isca l federalism) where there was bo th 
an appetite f o r re fo rm and a desire f o r Bank loan. A re la t ive ly small. amount o f lend ing resulted in a large 
(scaled up) impact. With respect to tax r e f o rm and f isca l federalism this w o r k built on prev ious ly 
successful Bank loans that p i lo ted r e f o rm in selected regions. AAA was also impor tan t , but the Bank 
probably underestimated the d i f f i c u l t y and very l o n g term ho r izon o f the most s ign i f ican t e f fo r t at 
imp rov ing pub l ic sector management, i.e. c i v i l service re form . 

Progress benchmarks: ( i ) implementation of c iv i l service reform: action p lan published before end-2002; 
( i i ) allowance fo r c iv i l service reform costs in 2003-05 budgets; ( i i i ) enterprise and household surveys 
demonstrate s ign i jkan t improvement in transparency and quality of pub l ic services; ( i v ) continues 
improvements in tax and customs administration as measured by tax receipts and pub l ic perception; ( v ) 
decrease in the amount of unfunded mandates over time; ( v i ) regional f isca l reforms on track 

33. 
Strengthen and modernize c i v i l service and governance capacity. The Government undertook a 
massive restructuring during the C A S period. Fo r sheer scope the change i s notable though i t w i l l b e 
several years before the r e f o rm can be considered complete. T h e federal program f o r Re fo rm ing C i v i l 
Service in Russia (2003-2005) comprised a comprehensive set o f measures a imed at strengthening the 
c i v i l service. I t led to the adoption o f the federal laws, e.g. O n the System o f the C i v i l Service o f the 
Russian Federation (2003) and O n the C i v i l Public Service o f the Russian Federation (2004), wh ich 
introduced a number o f new principles, such as a performance-based pay scheme, merit-based promotion, 
and a contractual system. A re fo rm o f the remuneration system in the c i v i l service was launched in 2002- 
2004, and i s w e l l financed b y the federal budget. The GR ICS ind ica tor o f Government effectiveness has 
revealed a steady improvemen t in Russia over the last three years. The Bank, together w i t h DFID, 
provides extensive TA support to the ongo ing re fo rm e f for t . 

34. 
However , large scale restructuring o f the government attempting to delineate po l icy , supervision 
and implementation functions among respectively m i n i s t r i e s , services and agencies, in a short run created 
a havoc in government administration b y complicated already quite leng thy bureaucratic processes, w i t h 
resulting d i f f icu l t ies f o r the imp lemen ta t ion o f the Bank supported po r t fo l io . Subsequently, some o f these 
teething implementation d i f f icu l t ies had dissipated, however the pr inc ip les o f the re forms were in some 
cases sacrificed as m in is tr ies res is ted re l inqu ish ing implementation functions, w h i l e some agencies and 
services re-acquired leg is la t ive and p o l i c y functions. 

35. 
Imp rove fiscal management at national and subnational leve l . The Government has undertaken a 
major improvement in subnational finance, and has developed an e f fec t ive federal leve l f isca l instrument 
f o r supporting economic, budgetary and f isca l improvements at the reg iona l leve l . T h i s includes broad- 
ranging re forms in f isca l and asset management, budget execution, and more transparent transfer and tax 
sharing systems. T h i s has been supported b y an innova t ive Fiscal Federa l ism and Reg iona l F isca l R e f o rm 

A n n e x C 

Page 9 o f 17 

loan (US$120 m i l l ion ) , in wh ich the Reg iona l F isca l R e f o rm Fund p rov ided incentive-based f isca l grants 
to f i f teen par t ic ipa t ing regions that have imp lemen ted broad-ranging re forms in f isca l and asset 
management, budget execution, and more transparent transfer and tax sharing systems At the national 
level, performance based budgeting i s being in troduced w i t h support f r om the Bank . WB I aided this e f fo r t 
through i t s on-go ing capacity building program o n intergovernmental f isca l relations, and expanded i t 
further to Russian regions, shifting the emphasis to the mun ic ipa l finance and budget execution issues. A 
recen t first investment b y the I FC M u n i c i p a l Fund in the f o rm o f par t ia l cred i t guarantee to support a 
bond issued b y Chuvash Republic f o r i t s key infrastructure investments w i l l further support the 
development o f subnational finance. 

36. 
The government has also worked to reduce un funded mandates. A special new federal transfer 
fund, the Compensation Fund was created in 2001 to p rov ide f inanc ia l support to regions f o r carry ing out 
impor tan t federal mandates rang ing f r om transportation, healthcare, hous ing and communa l services 
bene f i ts . The number o f mandates covered b y this fund has steadily increased. N e w amendments to the 
Budget Code n ow require any l aw that mandates expenditures to be the f inanc ia l respons ib i l i ty o f the 
leve l o f government f r om wh ich the l aw emanated. O n the other hand, an ambitious r e f o rm in inter- 
governmental relations, due f o r imp lemen ta t ion in 2005 and 2006, increases the f inanc ia l (expenditure) 
responsibilities o f sub-national governments. A l though the under ly ing p r inc ip le o f this r e f o rm i s t o g ive 
regional and loca l authorities con tro l over these expenditures, the new laws also contain some ambiguous 
sections that m igh t be interpreted as limiting this con tro l . 

37. 
Tax, Treasury and Customs are three Government agencies that received Bank loans to assist the 
Government in the development and upgrade o f i t s administrative, me thodo log ica l and human capacity to 
de l iver core Government functions. Ove ra l l f inanc ing f o r these core functions totals US$470 m i l l i o n and 
includes technical support to three key federal agencies. The Tax Modern iza t ion loan (US$99 m i l l i o n ) i s 
helping the authorities to launch a coun try-w ide modern iza t ion e f fo r t that i s based on an earlier p i l o t 
program (also supported b y the Bank), w h i c h reduced taxpayer wa i t ing t ime b y a factor o f 5 and a rep ly 
per iod f r om 2 weeks to 1-4 days. The Customs Development loan (US$140 m i l l i o n ) p i lo ts ways to 
accelerate customs clearance -- and hence imp rove trade fac i l i ta t ion b y Customs -- w h i l e im p r o v i n g the 
e f f ic iency o f co l lec t ing f isca l revenues. The Treasury Development loan (US$23 1 m i l l i o n ) assists the 
Government in increasing the e f f ic iency o f processing budget f lows and in im p r o v i n g f inanc ia l con t ro l 
over them. 

38. 
The Bank assistance to pub l ic expenditure management resulted in a better qua l i ty o f the federal 
budget preparation in terms o f proper accounting f o r and costing o f ex is t ing expenditure commitments. 
The outcomes o f this wo rk included: (i) amendments t o the Budget Code that p rov ided the lega l basis f o r 
expenditure budgeting inc lud ing a revised approach to ex is t ing and new expenditure commitments; (ii) 
M O F in terna l regulations on the revised budge t ing procedures; (iii) a core group o f senior and middle 
leve l M O F o f f ic ia ls trained in modem budgeting techniques. Assistance has also been p rov ided in support 
o f the performance budgeting r e f o rm implementation. 

P i l lar 3: M it igat ing social and environmental risks 

39. 
This strategic p i l l a r was linked to the l o n g te rm goals o f poverty a l lev ia t ion and reduc t ion in 
reg iona l differences. Progress has been m i x e d f o r each o f the four C A S objectives (see be low) . B o t h the 
goals and the pillar are expansive in scope and thus suffer to some degree f r om a lack o f specification. 
They also address a large range o f topics that are deeply sensitive in Russia, e.g. the p rov is ion o f health 
care b y the state, the nature o f the education system, the des irab i l i ty o f in terna l and in terna t iona l 
m igra t ion , ins t i tu t iona l care o f children, alcoholism, stranded populations (especially in the Nor thern 
Siberia), and the Soviet environmental legacy. The degree o f d i f f i c u l t y in so lv ing these problems i s 
s ign i f ican t ly greater and longer term in nature than either o f the other strategic p i l lars in the CAS . 

40. 
In retrospect, the very large and d i f f i c u l t environmental agenda and the d i f f i c u l t ins t i tu t iona l 
relationship w i t h one key actor (Ministry o f Na tu ra l Resources) should have l e d the Bank to focus more 
on the p r i o r consensus b u i l d i n g and p o l i c y analysis o f the sort done in the Bank’s C h i l d We l fare and 
Adult Health, H I V / A ID S , Poverty Assessment, and Forestry studies. Bank lend ing was more successful

when based o n a well-established dialogue (Education) or when responding to a specific, w e l l conceived 
reques t f r om the Government (Hydrome t Modern iza t ion loan). 

Progress benchmarks: ( i ) reduction of incidence and depth of poverty; ( i i ) equity of access to and quality

M i t iga te environmental risks and support the g loba l commons. Though evidence o f progress i s 
beg inn ing to emerge, development and imp lemen ta t ion o f clear po l ic ies was impeded b y frequent 
administrative changes and decentralization o f key oversight functions w i t h inadequate planning. T h e 
new service f o r environmental compliance and enforcement remains fundamentally understaffed and the 
system works unevenly. However, an environment management rev iew completed b y the Bank in 2004 
concluded that most environmental indicators (water quality, emissions) have imp roved over the last f i v e 
years w i t h the exception o f those related to the increase in use o f automobiles and accumulation o f 
wastes. T h e energy in tens i ty o f GDP i s un l ike ly to decrease as vehicle ownership rises, though imp roved 
energy e f f ic iency in heating systems w i l l have a pos i t ive impact. 

42. 
Through AAA the Bank has been assisting w i t h p i l o t i n g a r i v e r basin management and water

The Bank i s supporting an operation to imp rove weather forecasting in Russia w i t h a U S $ 80

reduce the economic and social costs o f weather-related events. The Forestry loan i s also assisting w i t h 
improved forest f i r e management and better forest management and cer t i f ica t ion . There have been l o n g 
delays, however, in processing tw o GEF grants, one wh ich wou ld address f i r e management in g loba l ly

are underway on ways to s imp l i fy the Government approval procedures f o r grants to a l low Russia to 
benefit f r om these available grant resources and TA. 

44. 
Concerning the g loba l environmental agenda, there has been some progress though there i s s t i l l 
much to be done. Russia, wh ich used to be one o f the world’s largest producers o f ozone depleting 
substances, successfully phased out the ir produc t ion and consumption w i t h the he lp o f a GEF grant and a 
mu l t i-donor trust fund o f US$ 7 1 m i l l i o n . With regard to g loba l warming, Russia signed the K y o t o 
Protocol, a major step forward, b u t has yet to put in place the ins t i tu t iona l mechanisms w h i c h w i l l perm i t 
enterprises to invest in reduced emissions technologies w i t h the bene f i t o f carbon trad ing schemes. The 
Bank i s wo rk ing closely w i t h Russian authorities and en te rp r ises on the development o f Green Investment 
Schemes.

Imp rove health status, services and finance. S ign i f ican t progress was achieved in the design o f 
pub l ic health insurance and the res truc tur ing o f the health service de l ivery system. B a n k support to 
Government re fo rm in health sector focused o n tw o m a i n themes: (i) he lp ing Russia establish a health 
care system that i s accessible, affordable, and e f f ic ien t , and (ii) strengthening the pub l ic p o l i c y response 
to premature mor ta l i ty and the r i s k s o f H I V / A ID S . These came after earlier W o r l d B a n k support to the 

A n n e x C 
Page 11 o f 17 
health sector that was aimed at i n i t i a l rehab i l i ta t ion and arresting the hea l th sector decline. A lso , 
discussions were in i t ia ted on the design o f public po l icy response to demographic challenges that Russia 
i s fac ing due t o premature male mor ta l i ty Through the Hea l th R e f o rm Imp lemen ta t ion L o a n (US$30 
m i l l ion ) the Bank i s assisting the Government to design and p i l o t methods o f hea l th sector restructuring, 
new f inanc ing mechanisms and medical protocols. WBI developed a Hea l th F lagsh ip course to imp rove 
the capacity o f mid- to h igh - leve l health sector o f f ic ia ls and managers to design and imp lemen t re forms in 
the sector, and par t icu lar ly f o r health care financing. The Bank i s supporting imp lemen ta t ion b y the 
Government o f i t s Strategy o n the Prevention and Con t ro l o f Social Diseases. The “just-in-time” w o r k on 
H I V / A I D S was w e l l rece ived and n ow serves as a reference f o r p o l i c y makers. The Bank, in cooperation 
w i t h UN Agencies and NGOs, in i t ia ted a Business Summ i t o n H I V / A I D S w h i c h brough t together 
representatives o f the Russian Government and the l o c a l and in terna t iona l business commun i ty , and 
resu l ted in agreement on further j o i n t actions to combat A I D S in Russia. Bank lend ing in support o f 
TB /A IDS prevention and treatment was more problematic. A US$150 m i l l i o n l o a n was approved w i t h 
delays and had had d i f f icu l t ies dur ing the i n i t i a l implementation. 

46. 
Imp rove reliance and de l ivery o f modem educational services. The Government took a s ign i f ican t 
decision to shift to a U n i f i e d State Un ive rs i ty entry exam, w h i c h w i l l imp rove access to h igher education 
fo r the l o w income and ru ra l population. The Russian Federation also j o i n e d the Bo logna process in 
support o f an integrated European educational space, w h i c h i s expected to imp rove the relevance and 
qua l i ty o f higher education. The education sector the Bank has successfully supported (i) r e f o rm o f 
un ivers i ty leve l social science education, (ii) development o f secondary school textbook p rov is ion 
(Education Innova t ion Project, US$70 m i l l ion ) , and (iii) development and p i l o t i n g o f reg iona l models f o r 
secondary education upgrade (Education R e f o rm Project, US$50 m i l l i o n ) . Some 75 new textbook titles 
have been introduced and over 20 m i l l i o n copies d is tr ibu ted across the country. However , no mon i to r ing 
and evaluation mechanism has been created to track the textbooks qua l i ty . However , the subsequent E- 
Learn ing in Schools pro jec t (US$lOO m i l l i o n ) has been extremely successful in ensuring better access to 
qua l i ty education f o r students in several remote destinations, wh i le the Education R e f o rm Project p i lo ted 
restructuring mechanisms f o r the secondary education in three par t ic ipa t ing regions. 

47. 
M i t iga te income insecurity, vu lnerab i l i ty and risk o f poverty. Russia’s recent impressive 
economic g row th has been pro-poor and has s ign i f ican t ly reduced risk o f poverty, w i t h the pover ty rate 
ha lv ing over the C A S per iod . E f fo r ts to improve targeting have been l e s s successful. Poor imp lemen ta t ion 
o f the monetization o f some social benefits in the beg inn ing o f 2005 (lack o f consultation, delays in 
payments) led to widespread protests and concerns about imp lemen t ing fu ture na t ion-w ide social reforms. 
The Bank was supportive o f the monetization r e f o rm and i s con t inu ing wo rk ing at the sub-national leve l 
on better targeting social assistance. W i t h the c i ty o f Kazan, through the Kazan M u n i c i p a l Development 
project ($125 m i l l ion ) , the Bank works to better target and de l iver monetized social benefits. With the 
Tomsk oblast, the Bank has launched a broad program a im ing at im p r o v i n g e f f ic iency o f the reg iona l 
poverty a l lev ia t ion strategy. Also, wo rk i s be ing launched on im p r o v i n g targeting o f social assistance in 
six subjects o f the federation, w i t h a potential to scale up e f f ic ien t practices to other regions. 

48. 
A Bank-Government e f fo r t to improve mon i to r ing and analytical capacity in the pub l ic sector, 
however, has been very successful, inc lud ing a mu l t i-year pro jec t on Im p r o v i n g Measurement, 
Mon i to r ing , and Ana lys is o f Poverty. 

49. 
The Bank also collaborated w i t h the Government on the design o f upgraded social assistance and 
on reforms o f social service prov is ion f o r the vulnerable groups (poor, ch i ldren at risk and residents o f the 
Nor th) . The Bank completed an analysis o f the employment support and labor market developments. 
C h i l d welfare po l ic ies at the regional leve l were studied and a large program o f capacity building and 
interventions on issues o f modern c h i l d welfare were completed. WBI worked closely w i t h the British 
Counc i l on the you th and governance issues f o l l ow i n g a special request f r om the Russian M i n i s t r y o f

Bank has been a ma jor prov ider o f f inanc ing f o r investment f o r water and sanitation (Mun ic ipa l Water

111. MEASUR ING BANK PERFORMANCE 

Changing the way we do business 

50. 

Tak ing i n t o account lessons ou t l ined in the Coun try Assistance Eva lua t ion (CAE ) f o r Russia, and 
in the context o f m idd le- income country (M IC ) approach, the C A S proposed new ways f o r do ing business 
in Russia to increase the relevance and impact o f the Bank 's work.3 Progress was made, yet the business 
mode l requires continuous evaluation and adjustment to mee t the needs o f our clients. K e y C A S 
benchmarks included the fo l low ing : 

51 . 
Strengthen analytical work . The C A S envisaged an increase in t h e r o l e o f AAA in the Russia 
program. A variety o f AAA instruments were provided, e.g. Poverty Assessment, f iduc ia ry reports, 
p o l i c y notes, sector reports, and the quarterly Russia Econom ic Report. This strengthened the dialogue at 
the sector leve l and helped to pos i t ion the Bank as an independent and technically sound vo ice in the 
pub l ic debate on economic re form . The Q A G has prepared the Coun try AAA assessment f o r Russia, and 
assigned an overa l l satisfactory ra t ing (see be low) . Strategic relevance, in terna l quality, and dialogue and 
dissemination were a l l judged h i g h l y satisfactory. 

52. 
Deve lop mon i to r ing capacity: Phase I o f the j o i n t Bank-Government program f o r im p r o v i n g the 
Measurement, Mon i to r ing , and Analysis o f Poverty in Russia was successfully completed in June 2004, 
and the Poverty Assessment Report was submitted to the Government. The BEEPS and F I A S surveys 
contributed to a deeper understanding o f the business environment. 

53. 
Select e f fec t ive lend ing instruments. As foreseen in the CAS, Russia successfully transitioned 
away f r om bo r row ing f o r balance o f payments support. But Bank lend ing changed in ways that were also 
no t foreseen in the CAS . With the Government wary o f u t i l i z i n g i t s sovereign guarantee, loans f o r 
sectoral re fo rm (e.g. railways, agriculture) did no t materialize loans nor did l i n e s o f cred i t f o r SM E 
development. Bank lending, however, did respond expeditiously 
to specific requests f r om the 
Government, f o r example on tw o loans fo r support to specific regions (St Petersburg and Kazan), as w e l l 
as projects in support o f the cadastre and hydrome teoro log ica l services. T h e Government has also looked 
fo r a more strategic use o f Bank lend ing instruments, consistent w i t h their imp roved f isca l stance. They 
are exp lor ing ways to drastically increase Government f inanc ing o f projects, and to replicate successful 
lend ing models (e.g. the competitive grants scheme in the Reg iona l F isca l Federalism loan) to programs 
in other sectors (e.g. Hous ing and Communa l Services Re form) . Consistent w i t h this more strategic use 
o f lend ing instruments, there was remarkable g row th in I F C and MIGA projects. 

54. 
Imp rove outreach. The sheer size o f Russia, as w e l l as i t s federal po l i t ica l structure, means that 
many development challenges are loca l ly based. Deve lop ing more effective tools f o r know ledge sharing 
across the breadth o f Russia i s a key challenge. A number o f in i t ia t ives were pursued, inc lud ing

b u i l d i n g relations w i t h other donors, e.g. in the Southern Okrug; 
extending collaboration w i t h c i v i l society, inc lud ing the N G O Adv isory Council, you th and 
disabled groups; 
imp rov ing communication w i t h the business community, 
including a Memo randum o f 
Understanding w i t h a large Russian pr iva te sector group on greater in fo rma t ion sharing; 

The CAE 's findings were discussed in the CAS 2002.

greater use o f Russian researchers and think-tanks in ana ly t ica l w o r k (e.g. the CEM , the Poverty

imp rov ing the ava i lab i l i ty o f a l l AAA o n the country website and ex tend ing access to a l l Regions

per iod ic press briefings, and the pub l ica t ion o f op-ed pieces in lead ing newspapers;

Far East, leasing and mortgage finance a l l inc lude s ign i f ican t components f o r pub l ic education 
through med ia and w o r k w i t h education ins t i tu t ions 

55. 
In add i t ion to the B a n k s AAA program, the W o r l d B a n k Ins t i tu te (WBI) expanded outreach in 
know ledge sharing and capacity building. WBI p layed an impor tan t ro le in supporting dissemination o f 
the Bank reports, and in creating a p la t fo rm f o r po l icy dialogue and consensus building in impor tan t areas 
such as f isca l decentralization, child welfare, support to S M E development, c i v i l service reform, gender 
mainstreaming, and poverty. The Distance Learn ing Center located in the M o s c ow o f f ice , however, has 
been underutilized. 

Recommendat ions f r o m the CAS Progress R e p o r t 

56. 
The CASPR proposed several improvements to the way o f do ing business in Russia f o r rema in ing 
CAS per iod (extended to 2006) in light o f strengthening o f the economy and deceasing b o r r ow i n g needs. 
In particular, the CASPR suggested (i) increasing the Banks d irec t cooperation and assistance w i t h 
regions wh ich face s ign i f ican t development challenges; (ii) p rov id ing more f lex ib le

AAA . As noted above, during the CAS per iod Q A G completed an assessment o f the Bank’s 
analytical and advisory activities. The assessment was based on the rev iew o f a sample o f ma jor non- 
lend ing activities in each o f the C A S strategic areas. The Q A G Assessment acknowledged high value o f 
the Bank’s independent judgmen t and perspectives, and i t s success in bringing g loba l know ledge to 
Russia. Accord ing to in terv iews w i t h clients, a large number o f changes in legislation, in the objectives 
and design o f institutions, in po l ic ies and in practical measures reflected the good qua l i ty and pos i t ive 
impact o f the Bank ’s analysis, advice o r fac i l i ta t ion . A situation, wh ich cou ld w e l l have deteriorated in to

ro le i f there i s a cyc l ica l down turn in natural resource prices in the medium-term.

Lend ing . The CAS projected 17 loans to ta l ing $1.8 b i l l i o n over the three year period; 10 projects 
were approved w i t h $1.2 b i l l i o n in new commitments. T h i s shor t fa l l i s due to the improved economic 
environment in Russia, in wh ich the Government developed large f isca l surpluses and in terna t iona l 
market access. I n some cases the bo r row ing plans in the C A S were premature, re f lec t ing ideas and design 
concepts that needed more discussion and re f lec t ion w i t h i n the Government, e.g. Hous ing and Communa l 
Services, Science and Technology, and Jud ic ia l Re form . In some cases these projects w i l l b e taken up in 
the next CAS . In FY 06 fou r new projects - STASYS 2, Southern Okrug, Adult Health, M icro f inance , 
and one RAO EUS guarantee were added to the ex is t ing pipeline w i t h $US165 m i l l i o n in new 
commitments. Though bo r row ing has decreased, the Government has ind ica ted a desire to continue 
bo r row ing to ava i l i tse l f o f the Bank’s expertise in pro jec t design and control, and to u t i l ize the Bank ’s 
procurement and f inanc ia l management systems. 

59. 
Por t fo l io . The Russia IBRD program entered the current C A S cyc le w i t h a p o r t f o l i o o f 3 1 active 
projects, $2.6 b i l l i o n in net commitments and a 77 percent satisfactory p o r t f o l i o ra t ing . The current 
po r t fo l io consists o f 22 projects, $1.95 b i l l i o n in net commitments,. Since the beg inn ing o f the CAS 
period, impor tan t steps have j o i n t l y been taken b y the Government and the Bank to imp rove p o r t f o l i o 
management and coordination. Po r t fo l io management has focused on c los ing older projects, im p r o v i n g 
reporting and mon i tor ing , incorpora t ing qua l i ty at entry (e.g. avo id ing cumbersome sub-loan agreements), 
and imp rov ing qua l i ty at ex i t ( imp rov ing the “disconnect” o n f i n a l pro jec t ratings). The Bank has 
strengthened supervision e f for ts through further decentralization o f operations, increasing commun ica t ion 
w i t h P IUs and relevant Government agencies, and b y establishing a disbursement and procurement 
mon i to r ing system. As a result, the share o f satisfactory projects has imp roved and stands at 95 percent; 
w e l l above the C A S trigger o f 7 0 percent o f satisfactory projects and the actual 77 percent ra t ing at the 
start o f the CAS . S ign i f ican t ly , pro jec t imp lemen ta t ion pace has recently p icked up and the disbursement 
ra t io has imp roved f r om an average 11 percen t over the last 6 years to 15.7 percent in FY06. T h e average 
processing time f o r new operations f r om Boa rd approval to effectiveness was reduced f r om 12 to 7.6 
months s l igh t ly exceeding the C A S trigger o f 8 months. 

60. 
No tw i ths tand ing these improvements, p o r t f o l i o management remains a difficult and management- 
intensive task. L o a n processing w i t h i n the Government remains h i g h l y labor and t ime consuming and 
further efforts w i l l be needed to speed up loadg ran t approval to enable Bank supported projects to t ime ly 
respond to the Government pr ior i t ies . Despite improvements, the disbursement pace tra i ls the Bank -w ide 
and E C A averages o f 24 and 17 per cent respectively fo r FY 0 6 . W h i l e the frequency o f pro jec t extensions 
s l igh t ly reduced fur ther concerted efforts w i l l be needed to complete projects on time. I n this regard the 
Bank i s comm i t ted t o continue i t s efforts in exped i t ing pro jec t preparation, decentralizing i t s operations, 
ra is ing to the extent possible f inanc ia l threshold per procurement methods and p r i o r rev iew thresholds, 
and responding in an operative way to c l i e n t ’ s needs. 

61. 
As o f June 30, 2006, I F C had invested $2.9 b i l l i o n o f i t s ow n funds in 135 projects in the country 
across a variety o f sectors. Russia i s the single largest exposure (almost US $ 2.0 b i l l i o n ) in IFC ’ s g loba l 
po r t fo l io . Over the previous CAS per iod the volume o f IFC ’s commitments increased dramatically. I f in 
FY02 , I F C invested $187 m i l l i o n in Russia, in FY 0 5 this f igu re reached $832 m i l l i o n . In FY06 , I FC 
comm i t ted $591 m i l l i o n and expects levels to rema in at about $700 m i l l i o n f o r FY07 to FY 0 9 . A g row ing 
part o f these investments i s in Russian owned companies - a strong vote o f confidence in Russia’s pr iva te 
sector and a signal to other investors. In add i t ion to extensive commitments to the f inanc ia l sector, I F C 
has been increasing i t s investments in the real sector, and has become a leading inves tor in Russia’s 
pr iva te transport infrastructure. 
In the f inanc ia l sector. I F C has promoted mortgage finance and

o f f ice noted, however, that the Bank lags beh ind other donor agencies in terms o f the delegation o f 
authority to the country o f f ice . I FC also increased i t s presence in M o s c ow b y m o v i n g a l l business

65. 

T o improve coord ina t ion between the Russian Government and the Bank, a Joint W o r k i n g Group 
(JWG) was established in the summer o f 2002, e f fec t ive ly rep lac ing the previous semiannual country 
po r t fo l io performance rev iew (CPPR) process. The JWG mee ts quarterly and comprises representatives 
o f the Country Management Unit and key Government stakeholders. I t has already proved i t s usefulness 
f o r resolution o f por t fo l io-w ide , and project-specific issues . 

66. 

In imp lemen t ing the CAS , the Bank Group worked extensively w i t h external partners. The Bank 
developed collaborative programs w i t h b i la tera l donors, inc lud ing DFID ( c i v i l service r e f o rm and pover ty 
analysis), C I D A (health and other programs, business development in the Russian Far East), F in land 
(programs in northwest Russia, inc lud ing f o r development o f the forestry, leasing and I C T sectors), 
Switzerlandseco (corporate governance and hous ing finance), the Du tch Ministry o f Fo re ign A f f a i r s 
(corporate governance and housing finance), UN (various programs) and U S A I D (Southern Okrug) . 
Cooperation w i t h Russian think tanks was extensive and a key part o f the Bank’s outreach e f for ts . The 
European Bank f o r Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) has an active program, focused o n non- 
sovereign lending, inc lud ing to Russia’s regions. T h e Bank and the EBRD collaborate o n selected 
analytical work , such as the business climate. I F C and EBRD and have co-invested in several projects. 

V. LESSONS 

67. 
Russia presents a series o f challenges to the Bank that go beyond the M i d d l e Income Coun try 
framework. 
A number o f lessons emerge f r om the imp lemen ta t ion o f the previous CAS , w i t h 
imp l ica t ions f o r design and imp lemen ta t ion o f the new strategy:

in v iew o f Russia’s large f isca l surplus the Bank’s value added i s no t in p r o v i d i n g f inanc ia l 
support but in he lp ing Russia gain access to g loba l knowledge and s k i l l s through ana ly t ica l and 
advisory support and through bringing together d i f feren t stakeholders and parts o f government in 
forg ing consensus on key po l icy issues. 

A n n e x C 

Page 16 o f 17 

given Russia’s rap id ly changing environment the Bank shou ld con t inue to move towards a 
partnership approach w i t h a strong demand-orientation in design and de l ivery o f assistance and 
f l e x i b i l i t y in adjusting the Bank’s program and modalities o f assistance to c l ien t needs, mak ing 
full u s e o f the Bank ’s f lex ib le arrangements fo r w e l l pe r fo rm ing M I C s and spearheading new 
instruments o f assistance d raw ing on increased co l labora t ion w i t h I F C and MIGA. 
w i t h the g row ing gap between prosperous and lagg ing regions the imm inen t challenge fo r the 
Bank i s to address the development challenges at the sub-national and reg iona l levels. Addressing 
these w i l l require the ab i l i ty to (i) organize and de l iver technical assistance to the 165 cities w i t h 
a popu la t ion over 100,000 m i l l i o n (where most o f the urban poor l ive ) and the tens o f thousands 
o f ru ra l mun ic ipa l i t ies ( where the extreme poor l ive) ; and (ii) p rov ide financing, w i thou t a 
sovereign guarantee, to some o f these sub-national entities 

given Russia’s enormous size, measures to increase the Bank ’s impac t - dissemination, outreach, 
scaling up, pro jec t design and management - must b e exp l ic i t in the Bank’s strategy. The 
dissemination o f the Bank ’s flagship publications (WDR, GDF, GEP, WDI) E C A Regional 
Studies, the Coun try Econom ic Memorandum, Poverty Assessment and the Russia Economic 
Report placed the B a n k squarely in the pub l ic discourse on economic po l icy . I t also re in forced the 
no t ion o f the Bank as an impa r t ia l vo ice in Russia. WB I he lped establish a presence f o r the Bank 
in Russia’s e igh ty-e igh t regions. T h i s i s n ow pay ing o f f as the B a n k seeks to wo rk d irec t ly w i t h 
Regions. 

decentralization has imp roved bo th the qua l i ty and timeliness o f the Bank ’s wo rk in Russia and 
should b e sustained in fu ture operations - par t icu lar ly as our w o r k in the Russian regions 
intensifies. 

recent progress in speeding up p o r t f o l i o imp lemen ta t ion has been encouraging, but b o t h the Bank 
and the Russian authorities w i l l need to be d i l igen t in staying the course g iven Russia’s d i f f i c u l t 
operating environment (bureaucracy, slow decision making). 

Russia i s a high cost coun try in wh ich to operate. T h i s reflects numerous factors. Russia’s size 
(1 1 t ime zones) adds s ign i f ican t ly to the cost structure. At the same time, po l icy discussions in 
Russia require very s ign i f ican t e f for ts at consensus building. A l s o add ing to the cost o f do ing 
business, the machinery o f government moves very s low ly , w i t h projects requ i r ing mu l t ip le 
reviews (even after pro jec t appraisal), and imp lemen ta t ion decisions often be ing delayed. I t 
should be noted, however, wh i le imp lemen ta t ion periods are long,(some reasons o f these delays 
are being addressed under the Joint W o r k i n g Group), Government counterparts o f ten prefer long- 
term engagement w i t h the Bank teams on projects to p ro long the use o f Bank project and 
technical expertise. 

V I . CONCLUSION 

68. 
Preparation o f the new strategy i s tak ing place in a fundamentally d i f feren t environment than that 
o f four years ago. Russia’s strong f isca l pos i t ion and access to f inanc ia l markets limit the need f o r 
sovereign borrow ing . But the coun try s t i l l faces ma jor structural tasks o n many fronts. Some tasks, like 
housing and communal re form , are related to the unfinished agenda o f economic transition. Others, like 
pub l ic-pr iva te partnerships, seek new ways o f p romo t ing economic d ive rs i f ica t ion and growth. Progress 
in transformation across a vast coun try i s understandably uneven, and attention must be focused on the 
g row ing gap between prosperous and lagg ing regions. Capacity and f inanc ia l constraints s low down the 
loca l implementation o f well-designed reforms. Tack l ing these constrains o n a large scale requires the 
mob i l iza t ion o f s ign i f ican t domestic and international resources. 

A n n e x C

69 . 
Russia i s interested in de f in ing a partnership w i t h the W o r l d B a n k that w o u l d respond to the 
country’s strengths and rema in ing development challenges. The Government remains comm i t ted t o 
collaborate w i t h the Bank as a source o f development know ledge and pro jec t imp lemen ta t ion capacity. 
A t the same time, the Russian authorities express strong preference f o r a mo re f lex ib le arrangement that 
wou ld a l low them to tap B a n k s k i l l s through a w ide menu o f instruments and services. In terms o f 
operational modalities, discussions w i t h the Government ind ica te strong interest in more f lex ib le access to 
a broad menu o f Bank instruments (AAA, technical assistance, lending, and guarantees). F o r the Bank 
Group this w o u l d mean closer cooperation between IBRD, I F C and MIGA, more resources and 
m e c h a n i sm to w o r k d irec t ly at the sub na t iona l leve l and exp lo r ing the poss ib i l i ty o f p rov id ing services 
such as asset management, s im i lar t o that prov ided f o r other countries.
