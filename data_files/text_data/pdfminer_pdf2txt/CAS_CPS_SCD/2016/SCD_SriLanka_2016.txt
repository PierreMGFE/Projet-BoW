The Systematic Country Diagnostic: 
A New World Bank Group Tool for 
Country Engagement

Under its new approach to working with its country 
partners, the World Bank Group (WBG) requires the 
preparation of a Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD) 
to precede the development of Country Partnership 
Frameworks that guide programming. The objective of 
an SCD is to identify the most critical constraints and 
opportunities facing a country in accelerating progress 
toward the goals of ending extreme poverty and 
promoting shared prosperity in a sustainable manner.  
The SCD is expected to produce an objective, evidence -
based, candid assessment of the main challenges facing 
the country, without limitation to the areas where the 
WBG is currently engaged.

I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

10   |   I. Executive Summary

1. 
Sri Lanka is in many respects a development suc-
cess story. With economic growth averaging more than 7 
percent a year over the past five years on top of an aver-
age growth of 6 percent the preceding five years, Sri Lanka 
has made notable strides towards the goals of ending ex-
treme poverty and promoting shared prosperity (the “twin 
goals”). The national poverty headcount rate declined 
from 22.7 to 6.7 percent between 2002 and 2012/13, while 
consumption per capita of the bottom 40 percent grew at 
3.3 percent a year, compared to 2.8 percent for the total 
population. Other human development indicators are also 
impressive by regional and lower middle-income country 
standards. Sri Lanka has also succeeded in ending decades 
of internal conflict in 2009 and steps have been taken to-
wards reconciliation. 

2. 
Increases in labor incomes account for most of 
the reduction in poverty over the last 10 years. Be-
tween 2002 and 2012/13, most of the reduction in pov-
erty was due to increased earnings, as opposed to higher 
employment or higher transfers. Although it is hard to be 
certain, increases in earnings are associated with: (i) a slow 
structural transformation away from agriculture and into 
industry and services that led to productivity increases; (ii) 
agglomeration around key urban areas that supported this 
structural transformation; (iii) domestic-driven growth, in-
cluding public-sector investment that led to increases in 
labor demand, particularly in industry and services; and 
(iv) a commodity boom that led to higher labor earnings 
for agricultural workers in the context of lower agricultural 
employment. 

3. 
However, important challenges lie ahead that 
may hinder further progress on poverty reduction and 
shared prosperity. Despite the low levels of extreme pov-
erty, roughly one quarter of Sri Lankans are nearly poor, as 
defined by living above the official poverty line (equiva-
lent to about $1.50 per day in 2005 purchasing power par-
ity, PPP, terms) but below $2.50 per day in 2005 PPP terms. 
The living standards of the near poor are closer to those of 
the poor than those living above $2.50 per day. Moreover, 
Sri Lanka’s aspirations as a middle-income country (MIC) 
will differ from those of a successfully developing low-in-
come country emerging out of conflict. Although Sri Lan-
ka has excelled in overcoming human development chal-
lenges typical of a low-income country, its service delivery 
systems in education, health, and other areas must now 
adjust to face new and changing demands typical of a MIC. 
Imperatives to improve social protection programs will in-
crease owing to an aging population that has passed its 
demographic peak. Finally, given increasing affluence and 
information, there will be higher expectations of the state 
to per form in order to facilitate growth, provide higher lev-
el of services, and demonstrate increasing responsiveness 
to a more demanding citizenry.

Poverty dropped by 
over two-thirds from 
2002 to  2012/13

4. 
The country is at an important economic and po-
litical crossroads as it faces these challenges. Sri Lanka’s 
real gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 43 percent from 
2009 to 2014, with the top four sectors (accounting for half 
of total growth) being all non-tradable sectors: construc-
tion, transport, domestic trade and banking, insurance and 
real estate. A substantial portion of this growth was driven 
by public investment to re-
build after the end of its 30-
year internal conflict in 2009. 
These sectors, as well as the 
economic boost at the end 
of the conflict, are not likely 
to be sustainable sources of 
growth in the long run. In addition to the need to foster 
new sources of growth, Sri Lanka is in the process of major 
governance reforms following the election of a new gov-
ernment in early 2015. The Constitution has been amend-
ed to overhaul the structure of government by reducing 
the power of the presidency and providing for more inter-
nal checks and accountability mechanisms. There is also 
now a constitutional guarantee of citizens’ right to infor-
mation. At the same time, while reforms to promote trans-
parency and accountability in government should lead to 
better per formance, a political settlement around the new 
governance structure will need to emerge. 

5. 
Bearing in mind the challenges to Sri Lanka’s fur-
ther development, this diagnostic consists of a system-
atic and detailed review of potential factors impacting 
progress on the twin goals. In line with the World Bank 
Group’s new approach to 
country engagements, this 
report aims to identify the 
most critical constraints and 
opportunities to advancing 
achievement of the twin 
goals. In order to organize 
and discipline the analysis, 
the report uses a framework 
that combines the Hausman, 
Rodrik and Velasco (2005) 
growth diagnostic and the 
Bussolo and Lopez-Calva 
(2014) asset-based approach 
to identify a universe of 22 
potential areas that may 
constrain or drive progress 
towards the twin goals. Sri Lanka’s per formance in each 
area was assessed for its relative impact on achieving the 
twin goals. This systematic analysis was then presented in 
set of consultations with multiple stakeholders, including 
government, academia, think tanks, the private sector, civ-
il society organizations, and international organizations to 
validate the findings, determine the relative importance of

issues identified in each of the 22 areas and identify knowl-
edge gaps. These findings were weighted against crite-
ria of : (i) the potential impact on ending poverty and on 
promoting shared prosperity ; (ii) the degree to which ad-
dressing these constraints would have complementarities 
across different domains; (iii) the strength of the evidence 
base behind the impact; (iv) the time horizon of impacts; 
and (v) whether addressing the constraint is a precondi-
tion to unlocking wider potential. This process yielded 
consensus that the key priorities for sustaining progress 
in ending poverty and promoting shared prosperity are to 
address the country ’s fiscal, competitiveness and inclusion 
challenges, as well as cross-cutting governance and sus-
tainability challenges.

The Fiscal Challenge

Sri Lanka has one 
of the lowest tax 
revenue-to-GDP ratios 
in the world

6. 
Low and declining revenues critically impact 
Sri Lanka’s fiscal position. Sri Lanka now has one of the 
lowest tax revenue-to-GDP ratios in the world, reflecting a 
decline from 24.2 percent in 1978 to 10.7 percent in 2014. 
The major causes of this decline are the low increase in the 
number of taxpayers, reductions in statutory rates with-
out commensurate efforts 
to expand the tax base, inef-
ficiencies in administration 
and numerous exemptions. 
In particular, since the in-
troduction of a value added 
tax (VAT ) in 2002, successive 
changes in the tax regime 
have led to over 500 types of exemptions for a wide variety 
of goods. There are also over 40 broad types of exemptions 
on corporate and personal income tax depending on the 
source of income and the type of taxpayer. Administration 
is complicated by lack of coordination among entities col-
lecting revenue as well as the Board of Investment, which 
provides incentives. No tax expenditure analysis is con-
ducted before or after the introduction of incentives.

7. 
Low tax revenues combined with an expenditure 
profile that is largely non-discretionary has led to a 
lean, rigid budget with little room for critical develop-
ment spending. Sri Lanka’s overall revenues and expendi-
tures are among the lowest in the region as a percentage 
of GDP. Fiscal consolidation and relative prioritization of 
public investment in capital infrastructure following the 
conflict have squeezed spending on other public goods, 
including health, education and social protection, which 
are currently below levels in other regional and emerging 
market comparators. Fiscal consolidation combined with 
declining revenues has made the budget rigid, leaving 
little fiscal space for the government to maneuver. Diffi-
cult-to-reduce items, such as public service remuneration, 

12   |   I. Executive Summary

transfers, and interest payments, have accounted for 60 
percent of expenditure in recent years. Moreover, wage 
pressures have been rising due to a 57 percent increase 
in the number of public servants in the past 10 years. This 
has yielded a situation where public servants account for 
13 percent of the labor force, comparable to the OECD av-
erage of 15 percent in 2011. At the same time, increases 
in recurrent expenditures in early 2015, particularly a raise 
in allowances to public servants, is to be financed by one-
time taxes, leaving very little room to maneuver. A strong 
commitment to fiscal consolidation in the face of these 
pressures has led to Sri Lanka having extremely low levels 
of public spending on education, health, and social pro-
tection as a percentage of GDP. Going forward, continued 
commitment to fiscal consolidation is critical to ensure 
macroeconomic stability, but this will require long-term 
improvements in revenues.

The Challenge of Promoting More 
and Better Jobs for the Bottom 40 
Percent

8. 
Sri Lanka has a number of advantages that can 
contribute to inclusive growth. Given its relatively small 
domestic market, Sri Lanka will need to look outward to 
fulfill its ambitions to become a prosperous and competi-
tive middle-income country. As such, the country has im-
portant strengths, such as overall strong human capital 
and a reliable infrastructure base, particularly when com-
pared to other South Asian countries. Sri Lanka also enjoys 
an enviable location in a fast-growing region along a major 
trade route, opening oppor-
tunities to serve as a regional 
trading hub. Moreover, Sri 
Lanka’s boasts unique natu-
ral assets, with a temperate 
climate, diverse topography, 
and unique historical assets, 
giving it a strong basis for tourism. At the same time, the 
country has a track record of developing globally compet-
itive companies, particularly in niches of the apparel and 
information technology (IT ) sectors.

Sri Lanka has an 
enviable location and 
unique natural assets

9. 
To capitalize on its advantages Sri Lanka will 
need to find an effective balance along two axes: (i) in-
ward vs. outward orientation of the economy; and (ii) 
the respective roles of the public and private sectors 
(Figure 1.1). The country ’s world market share has fallen to 
levels last seen in the 1980s, with a steady decline in com-
modity exports and an export basket that has remained 
largely unchanged in a context of rising production costs 
and weakening demand due to slow growth in some of its 
main markets (Europe and the Middle East). At the same

time, the economy has shifted towards a public-sector led 
model, as public investment to rebuild following the end 
of conflict was responsible for much of the large growth in 
construction as well as transport over the last decade. 

Inward versus Outward Orientation of the 
Economy

The degree of 
outward orientation 
has wavered in the 
past decade

10. While Sri Lanka’s in-
dustrial policy has been 
broadly market-orient-
ed since liberalization in 
the 1970s, the degree of 
outward orientation has 
wavered in the past de-
cade. Two earlier rounds 
of economic 
liberalization 
introduced a series of reforms towards deregulating the 
economy, accompanied by a strong focus on export ori-
entation and foreign direct investment (FDI) promotion. 
The last decade has seen a noticeable shift towards pro-
tectionism. The introduction of para-tariffs has effectively 
doubled the protection rates, making the present import 
regime one of the most 
complex and protection-
ist in the world. Moreover, 
the para-tariffs’ dispersion 
leads to prices that distort 
production and consump-
tion patterns. Higher rates 

The import regime 
is one of the most 
protectionist in the 
world

of protection on final products than on inputs 
used in their production lead to an anti-export 
bias, since producers have strong incentive to 
sell goods domestically even though their do-
mestic costs are higher than their opportunity 
costs through trade. This is particularly worry-
ing for the agricultural sector, where high pro-
tection of import-competing crops along with 
fertilizer subsidies have created strong disin-
centives for crop and export diversification. 
Incentives are structured to expand produc-
tion of import-competing crops (rice, maize) 
and discourage the production of exportables 
through the introduction of high export taxes 
(‘cesses’) on raw materials such as tea, rubber, 
cinnamon, coconut and spices, with the no-
tion that this would increase value addition of 
exports. Revenues from cesses were supposed 
to be then invested in research and develop-
ment for the corresponding sectors to encour-
age value addition, yet this has not been im-
plemented. 

11. Foreign direct investment, a foun-
dation for economic diversification, has been disap-
pointing despite numerous fiscal incentives. FDI re-
mains below 2 percent of GDP five years after the end of 
armed conflict, which is low relative to much higher levels 
of FDI in other MICs such as Vietnam or Cambodia. While 
FDI can enhance access of producers to global production 
networks and facilitate the development of new activi-
ties within existing value chains, FDI inflows to Sri Lanka 
have been largely focused on infrastructure (inclusive of 
real estate development), with a relatively small propor-
tion reaching sectors of the economy that are associated 
with global networks of production. Although conclusive 
data is not available, the benefits from incentives in terms 
of attraction and retention of productivity-enhancing FDI 
may not outweigh the costs involved in fiscal losses and 
potential disruption of market dynamics (through, among 
other things, the creation of an unleveled playing field). 
Global experience suggests that the most important ways 
to ensure both domestic and foreign investment include 
measures to improve the enabling environment, including 
through a skilled workforce and adequate innovation poli-
cies that form the basis of a competitive economy.

12. Despite past achievements, the quality of gener-
al education lags behind higher middle-income coun-
tries and firms have difficulty accessing the skills they 
need. Although human development indicators are ahead 
of regional peers, the quality of education, as measured 
by periodic internationally comparable tests, lags be-
hind that of higher middle-income countries, particularly 
in language and numeracy skills. Sri Lanka also lacks the

Sri Lanka lacks 
vocational and 
technical skills that 
are increasingly in 
demand

kind of vocational and technical skills in its workforce that 
are increasingly in demand, reflecting constraints on the 
quality and relevance of higher education and research. 
For instance, over 75 per-
cent of employers expect a 
high-skilled worker to know 
English and have computer 
skills, but only 20 percent 
of Sri Lankans are fluent in 
English and only 15 percent 
can use computers. More 
generally, there are poor 
linkages between what the private sector needs in order 
to innovate and research and development institutions 
that could meet these needs. This is particularly acute in 
agriculture where there is limited distribution of new tech-
nologies critical for modern farming. 

The Relationship between the Public Sector and 
Private Sector 

Property rights and 
land-use regimes  are 
important constraints

13. 
The government’s performance as regulator and 
facilitator of economic activity has improved in recent 
years, though significant shortcomings remain. Given 
fiscal constraints, sustained growth will need to be driven 
by the private sector, which, in turn, calls for government 
regulation conducive to business. Among areas of regula-
tion, systems for registration of property rights and land-
use regimes that introduce limitations and lead to frag-
mentation of land parcels 
are important constraints to 
businesses. Land ownership 
issues are the most com-
mon reason cited by infor-
mal firms for not registering. 
Moreover, the predictability 
of state regulation with regard to property rights has prov-
en to be an issue, with particular harm caused by the “Re-
vival of Underper forming Enterprises and Underutilized 
Assets Act”, which expropriated 37 enterprises in sectors 
like hotels, mixed-property development and the sugar 
industry. Licenses and permits are also an obstacle, partic-
ularly in the Northern Province. Finally, policy-induced bar-
riers consisting of regulatory and institutional bottlenecks 
account for nearly 70 percent of the total time spent on 
exporting or importing goods. 

14. 
Similarly, labor market regulations appear to 
be constraining the growth of employment. Although 
labor market regulations aim to provide job security to 
formal sector workers, since these represent only about 15 
percent of the workforce, they have resulted in creating a 
deep divide between formal and informal workers. Sri Lan-
ka’s Termination of Employment of Workmen Act (TEWA) 

14   |   I. Executive Summary

requires that firms with 15 or more employees justify 
layoffs and provide generous severance pay to displaced 
workers, with smaller firms being exempted. These sever-
ance payments are expensive relative to regional and mid-
dle-income peers. Finally, the legal framework prevents 
women from taking up night work or part-time work in the 
growing service sector while the laws governing maternity 
benefits make employers bear the entire cost, potentially 
deterring employers from hiring women. 

Regulatory 
compliance 
burdens prompt 
entrepreneurs to 
operate informally, 
an important obstacle 
to growth and 
competitiveness

15. 
Regulatory 
com-
pliance burdens prompt 
entrepreneurs to operate 
informally, which under-
mines competition. Most 
business establishments 
in 
Sri Lanka are small and hence 
do not benefit from econ-
omies of scale. Moreover, 
side-by-side operations of 
informal and formal firms in a 
market lead to unfair practic-
es and market inefficiencies. 
Unfair competition from in-
formal players is viewed as the single most important ob-
stacle to the growth and competitiveness of established 
firms. At the same time, informal firms generally have no 
access to financial services, government contracts, and es-
sential licenses and permits.

16. Although successive policy regimes have intro-
duced numerous programs aimed at supporting the 
small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) sector, firms 
in this sector face multiple constraints, particularly 
access to finance and technology. Financing issues are 
driven by weaknesses of the firms to put forward bankable 
projects as well as failures in SME banking which relies on 
asset-based financing with little flexibility to provide proj-
ect-based finance. SMEs also find it difficult to access tech-
nology to upgrade their businesses. Reducing the cost of 
operating a business along with stronger enforcement can 
help to reduce informality, reduce uncompetitive practic-
es, and, by extension, create an environment more condu-
cive to investment in productivity-enhancing activities. 

17. 
The proliferation of small firms and informal em-
ployment has important consequences for the ability 
of the bottom 40 percent to share in the growth pro-
cess. Most of the increase in non-agricultural employment 
between 2002 and 2012 was in self-employed non-farm 
workers. Moreover, the decline in agricultural employment 
coincided with an increase in workers employed in estab-
lishments with no regular employees. By 2012, 74 percent 
of unskilled workers (those with less than a primary educa-
tion) had only temporary or casual wage employment, up 

from 70 percent in 2006, suggesting that these workers are 
increasingly working under precarious conditions. Wages 
of temporary workers are on average 33 percent lower 
than wages of permanent workers; one-third of which 
cannot be explained by differences in the job or individ-
ual characteristics, suggesting that workers would choose 
more stable reliable jobs if they could.

18. 

A large public 
sector impacts 
competitiveness in 
a number of sectors 
and labor market 
dynamics

Beyond carrying out regulatory functions, the 
state itself is a major par-
ticipant 
in 
the market 
through 
its 
large state-
owned enterprise 
(SOE) 
sector and public service, 
which in turn has impact-
ed competitiveness in a 
number of sectors and 
labor market dynamics. 
SOEs have a significant mar-
ket share in many sectors, 
including areas where there is not a strong apparent ra-
tionale for public intervention. This is most striking in the 
finance sector, where major SOEs make up close to half of 
the market. At the same time, there is a weak framework 
for public-private partnerships and relatively few cases of 
PPPs; infrastructure development over the past 10 years 
has been driven by direct public spending. Finally, the 
state plays an outsized role as an employer. There is strong 
demand for public-sector jobs as public-sector workers 
enjoy the advantages of formal employment and other 
benefits such as a pension. Moreover, the evidence sug-
gests that there is a salary premium for public-sector work-
ers and that this premium has grown between 2006 and 
2012. Workers, particularly educated women, are queuing 
for public-sector employment. 

19. 
Finally, there has been a high degree of intercon-
nectedness between the state and some segments of 
the private sector that motivates intervention by the 
government. The variation in tax and customs incen-
tives reflects government policy but also contains specific 
benefits for specific sectors, many of which have a limit-
ed number of major actors. In addition, there are several 
high-profile cases of movement of senior officials between 
public and private sectors as there is no developed frame-
work for handling conflicts of interest to separate pub-
lic-sector work from private-sector interests. Given that 
there are frequent instances of state regulatory help to a 
given sector it follows that private-sector entities would 
seek to maintain or expand privileges, reinforcing the lev-
el of regulatory intervention into the economy. These cir-
cumstances also suggest that many private-sector entities 
would have to adjust considerably were Sri Lanka to open 
its markets to a greater extent. Changing the state’s role 
as an employer, market actor and regulator to provide for 

a more level playing field will encounter resistance from 
vested interests.

Social Inclusion Challenges

Urbanization can 
facilitate inclusion

20. 
The highest numbers of people living in poverty 
and the bottom 40 percent are located within multi-
city agglomeration areas. At the same time, urbaniza-
tion in Sri Lanka has been a strong driver of growth and 
that trend will continue. Streamlining urban management 
structures and 
improving 
their capacity 
to ensure 
they have the administrative 
powers to deliver functional 
urban services and conduct 
integrated, strategic planning (including land use plan-
ning and transport planning) will provide local authorities 
with the opportunity to respond to both present and fu-
ture needs. Improved connectivity across the country will 
further assist in raising the economic potential located 
outside the Kandy-Colombo-Galle agglomeration, as well 
as improving growth drivers within those districts. Further 
analysis on the constraints to participation of the bot-
tom 40 percent in further agglomeration and spreading 
economic activity will be important for assessing what is 
needed to have urbanization facilitate inclusion. 

21. 
The poor in more isolated regions of the country 
represent a different challenge. There are high rates of 
poverty in the Northern and 
Eastern Provinces, the cen-
ter where the estate sector 
(plantation-based 
agricul-
ture) is concentrated, and 
Moneragala 
in the south-
east. Poverty rates are high-
est in portions of the North-
ern and Eastern provinces, 
which were most affected 
by the internal conflict. The 
high poverty headcount rates in these regions are asso-
ciated with weak links to the labor market, particularly 
among the youth and educated women. People with phys-
ical disabilities and psychological problems due to conflict, 
in particular ex-combatants and widows, are particularly 
vulnerable to exclusion.

There are high 
rates of poverty in 
the Northern and 
Eastern Provinces, 
the estate sector, and 
Moneragala

22. 
Poverty measured by consumption has dropped 
significantly among estate workers, but non-monetary 
measures of poverty and vulnerability remain high. 
Estate workers continue to be largely dependent on the 
estate’s management for many basic needs, particularly 
housing. While poverty in the estate sector fell markedly in 
the past decade, poverty rates continue to be higher com-

Sri Lanka — Ending Poverty and Promoting Shared Prosperity   |   15

pared to both urban and rural sectors, pointing to contin-
ued vulnerability. This is particularly evident when looking 
at health and nutrition indicators. Estates have the highest 
maternal mortality rates in the country, and both estate 
women as well as children suffer from high rates of mal-
nutrition that are double national averages. Estate-sector 
households are less likely to have drinking water, sanitary 
facilities or electricity within their households. Moreover, 
access to services and the quality of services in the estates 
is comparatively low. Poor outcomes in education impede 
the ability of the estate population to participate in Sri 
Lankan society. The youth are increasingly leaving the es-
tate sector but they face difficulties in accessing salaried 
employment when competing with other youth. Women 
tend to be employed for the lowest-paying unskilled tasks 
that require intense labor, such as tea plucking or rubber 
tapping. Despite being income earners, there is substan-
tial anecdotal evidence that the wages of estate women 
are often collected by their husbands or fathers who often 
spend it on alcohol. Alcoholism and associated abuse of 
women is much higher in the estate sector.

23. 
The estate sector faces structural challenges that 
will likely impact the population going forward. Wages 
have risen by over 10 times since privatization in 1992 – 
due in part to the strong collective bargaining power of 
estate workers, linked to a power ful political party repre-
senting them. At the same time, Sri Lankan tea producers 
are facing increasing competition from Kenyan and Indian 
producers who have lower costs of production and higher 
productivity. As a result, the future welfare of estate com-
munities is at risk due to narrowing surpluses enjoyed by 
Regional Plantation Companies (RPCs) and a socio-eco-
nomic structure that may not be tenable over the long 
term. 

24. 
Beyond the locational concentration of the pop-
ulation, inclusion across ethnic and religious groups is 
critical. Although partially correlated to spatial disparities, 
poverty outcomes across ethnicity and religion illustrate a 
second important challenge for social inclusion. Differenc-
es in poverty outcomes across ethnic groups are related 
to employment and other opportunities. This is the case 
even when the North and East are excluded from compar-
isons. As more youth migrate across the country in search 
of jobs, equal opportunities will be critical. Sri Lankan 
Tamils and Sri Lankan Moors have relatively high levels of 
poverty, as detailed in Chapter V; however, empirical anal-
ysis finds that most of the difference in monetary pover-
ty is related to inequality of opportunities. For a range of 
indicators, the most recent household survey shows that 
Sri Lankan Tamil households have lower access to basic 
services, including drinking water within their premises, 
the availability of a pipe-borne line nearby their house, a 

16   |   I. Executive Summary

toilet within their unit and access to electricity. Similarly, 
educational attainment is lower for the ethnic minority 
workforce, and rates of ownership of land are also uneven 
among the country ’s ethnic communities. In terms of labor 
market opportunities, labor force participation is low and 
unemployment is high for Sri Lankan Tamils and Moors. 
However, when focusing outside of the post-conflict re-
gions, both Sri Lankan and Indian Tamils have higher labor 
force participation and employment rates relative to their 
Sinhalese counterparts. This suggests that different rates 
of participation are mostly determined by differences in 
employment opportunities. The conflict-affected areas 
face the additional challenge of integrating displaced per-
sons: while over 700,000 have returned, they face multiple 
challenges in securing land rights, accessing shelter and 
infrastructure, and developing livelihoods. 

25. 
Finally, gender inclusion is critical, particularly 
as it relates to the labor market. Women made up 53 
percent of the working age population in 2012, but only 
34 percent of the employed population, a figure that has 
remained static for decades. Women are less likely to par-
ticipate in the labor market, but when they decideto look 
for work, they are more like-
ly to be unemployed. Social 
norms related to a wom-
an’s role in the household 
and especially as related to 
childcare 
responsibilities 
restrict women’s opportu-
nity to participate in the la-
bor market. However, beyond social norms, gender wage 
gaps and occupational segregation dissuade and con-
strain women from participating in the labor force. At the 
same time, the formal legal framework for labor prevents 
women from taking up night work or part-time work in the 
growing service sector, and the laws governing maternity 
benefits make employers bear the entire cost, potentially 
deterring employers from hiring women.

in the labor market 
has remained static 
for decades

The Cross-Cutting Governance 
Challenge 

26. 
The governance challenge manifests itself in 
many ways which taken together constitute the fun-
damental constraint on progress on the twin goals. 
Governance issues are cross cutting and underlie in many 
important ways the three challenges outlined above. Gov-
ernance is obviously central to the quality and probity of 
public expenditure as well as the government ’s capacity 
to provide for equality of opportunity for the poor and 
bottom 40 percent to improve their welfare. Moreover, the 
quality of governance is integral to addressing corruption 

concerns and sustaining public trust. It is also integral to 
revenue per formance, particularly the effectiveness of tax 
and customs administration. The most prominent manner 
in which governance acts as a constraint is in how the state 
carries out regulatory functions for the economy. Policies 
that orient the economy inward, such as the convoluted 
tax system, restrictive land and labor market regulation, 
and inefficient subsidies – and the related quality of ad-
ministration thereof – reflect areas where governance is a 
critical constraint. This burden of government regulation 
has led to a large informal sector, which negatively impacts 
improvements in productivity. Governance weaknesses 
have further led to significant expansion of the public sec-
tor ’s role in the labor market and certain economic sectors. 
This expanded role in the economy contributes little to ef-
fective use of the country ’s resources or productivity gains, 
whether it is interventions in agriculture, multiplying tax 
incentives, or absorbing a significant portion of the labor 
force. Finally, ensuring the provision of key public goods 
such as infrastructure and public services is a core function 
of government; the extent to which there is inequality in 
access to such goods reflects areas where strengthened 
governance is warranted.

Sustainability Challenges

Achieving a lasting 
settlement that 
ensures peace 
and security for Sri 
Lankans is a sine qua 
non condition for 
progress

27. 
Sustainability of Sri Lanka’s development will in-
volve keeping momentum towards reconciliation and 
successful completion of institutional reforms. Achiev-
ing a lasting settlement of conflict that ensures peace and 
security for Sri Lankans is the sine qua non condition for 
progress. While circumstances are unique to every country 
and conflict is not minent, 
global experience suggests 
that Sri Lanka is “at risk” given 
its history of internal conflict. 
Achieving reconciliation and 
addressing issues that led to 
grievances that, in turn, fu-
eled conflict in the past will 
be critical. Sri Lanka has tak-
en notable steps along this 
path, 
including 
following 
up on extensive recommen-
dations by its Commission of Inquiry on Lessons Learned 
and Reconciliation (LLRC). Important measures have oc-
curred in recent months, including the appointment of a 
civilian as governor in the north and beginning to return 
some land occupied by the military after the conflict end-
ed. This momentum will need to be sustained. Sri Lanka 
will also need to follow through on major institutional re-
forms now taking place to achieve a lasting political settle-
ment around a government that is more transparent and 
accountable.

28. Other risks to sustainability are associated with 
economic stability in the context of an uncertain ex-
ternal environment and environmental issues. External 
risks include a chronic current account deficit and rela-
tively low reserve adequacy metrics; a gradual but steady 
decline in goods exports; an already high external debt 
burden and a rising cost for external financing as Sri Lanka 
must now borrow on commercial terms; and disappointing 
levels of foreign direct investment. While the current ac-
count deficit has decreased in recent years, in part thanks 
to slow increases in remittances and tourism, it remains fi-
nanced largely by debt-creating inflows. At the same time, 
Central Bank foreign exchange reserves are at the lower 
end of what is considered adequate by standard metrics. 
Moreover, Sri Lanka is in the 
midst of 
its demographic 
transition, and is projected 
to age fast in the next few 
decades. As the elderly typ-
ically run down their sav-
ings and require additional 
public spending in the form of pensions, social protection 
and healthcare, their increasing share in the population 
means that national savings will fall even further. Finally, 
preserving Sri Lanka’s natural asset base and managing en-
vironmental impact as the country continues its structural 
transformation, including urbanization, will be critical to 
sustaining progress on the twin goals. Sri Lanka will con-
tinue to face environmental risks due to natural disasters 
as well as the long-term impacts of climate change, which 
by one accounting will result in reductions of 1.2 percent 
of GDP per year by 2050.

to age fast in the next 
few decades

Conclusions 

29. 
Sri Lanka’s has had impressive development 
gains but there are strong indications that drivers 
of past progress are not sustainable. Solid economic 
growth, strong poverty reduction, overcoming internal 
conflict, effecting a remarkable democratic transition in 
recent months, and overall strong human development 
outcomes are a track record that would make any coun-
try proud. However, the country ’s inward looking growth 
model based on non-tradable sectors and domestic de-
mand amplified by public investment cannot be expected 
to lead to sustained inclusive growth going forward.

30. A systematic diagnostic points to fiscal, compet-
itiveness, and inclusion challenges as well as cross-cut-
ting governance and sustainability challenges as pri-
ority areas of focus for sustaining progress in ending 
poverty and promoting shared prosperity (Table 1.1). 
The fiscal challenge is due above all to poor revenue collec-
tion, compounded by inefficiencies in public expenditures 

Sri Lanka — Ending Poverty and Promoting Shared Prosperity   |   17

that result in rigidity and underinvestment in human capi-
tal. The competitiveness challenge is a mix of several areas 
where Sri Lanka is behind comparator countries, most no-
tably in fostering adequate skills in the labor force, but also 
in other areas such as FDI attraction, investment climate, 
and promotion of innovation. The inclusion challenge is 
both spatial in the urban areas and remote “pockets of 
poverty” as well as cross cutting across ethnic, gender and 
age differences in Sri Lanka’s population. Governance is a 
challenge in all areas, but is particularly manifested in reg-
ulatory constraints and an outsized public sector. Finally, 
there are important sustainability risks, including the need 
to: maintain peace and security ; carry through with gover-
nance reforms; address longer-term economic challenges 
of an aging population; and balance imperatives to grow 
with stewardship of Sri Lanka’s natural assets as a basis for 
lasting prosperity and quality of life.

31. 
There are particularly important areas of syner-
gy that provide for progress on inclusion, sustainabil-
ity and growth. For instance, effective governance of cit-
ies will not only be critical for addressing spatial inclusion 
challenges, but could also improve the benefits of urban 
agglomeration and raise the level of overall growth and 
job-creation. Good governance in urbanizing areas is also 
important to balance social, environmental, and economic 
equity concerns to allow for Sri Lanka to benefit long term 
from its relatively unharmed natural asset base. Similarly, 
improving equality of opportunity (including addressing 
land claims) across ethnic groups is likely to be crucial for 
improving social stability and sustainability of peace. Clos-
ing gender gaps is not only important in terms of social 
inclusion, but is also critical in terms of the broader chal-
lenge of raising competitiveness and ensuring shared 
prosperity, particularly given that an aging population will 
increase the dependency rate. 

32. 
There is a particularly strong nexus of issues 
around providing for skills development that meets 
the needs of Sri Lanka’s economy. On one hand, there 
are important elements of state per formance needed 
to improve the population’s skills mix: its ability to cre-
ate more fiscal space to provide quality education to the 
population, the efficiency of resources directed towards 
human capital development, its ability to listen to and 
partner with the private sector on ensuring that the right 
skills are being provided, and the impact that it has on the 
labor market given its outsized role as an employer. At the 
same time, investment in skills, particularly with public fi-
nancing, is integral to equipping the bottom 40 percent 
with capacity to get good jobs, a fundamental means of 
boosting shared prosperity. A more skilled labor force in 
turn helps Sri Lanka become more competitive, including 
within global value chains, as well as a more attractive des-
tination for FDI. 

33. Addressing the constraints and sustainabili-
ty risks diagnosed in this report will require effective 
leadership. Consultations conducted while preparing this 
diagnostic showed that many of the identified constraints 
were known, at least on an intuitive level. Indeed, with re -
gard to several constraints, reforms or government inter-
ventions have been initiated to address problems such as 
equality of opportunity in underserved areas or improving 
Sri Lankans’ skill sets. The present government has articu-
lated further plans to address other constraints outlined in 
this diagnostic. Yet there also remain interests that support 
the status quo, whether they are specific tax exemptions 
or limitations on the number of slots available in higher 
education institutions. Sri Lanka is at a crossroads in its 
economic growth model and its governance framework 
that will provide for an effective state to facilitate growth 
and ensure social inclusion. Effective leadership will be 
needed to steer it forward on a path that will continue its 
strong progress in ending poverty and promoting shared 
prosperity.

18   |   I. Executive Summary

Table 1.1 Priorities to end poverty and promote shared prosperity in a sustainable

Priorities

Rationale

FISCAL

Reform the tax regime and improve tax administration to 
improve revenue performance
Improve the adequacy and effectiveness of spending
Improve the amount of financing and efficiency of social 
protection

COMPETITIVENESS

Review and revise the country’s trade-related policies 
Provide more resources and quality-enhancing management in 
the education sector to expand skilled workforce and overcome 
skills mismatch
Promote innovation by establishing linkages between R&D 
institutions and networks of entrepreneurs

INCLUSION

Proper urban management and effective governance of cities to 
address locational concentrations of poverty
Multi-sector interventions to reduce poverty and promote 
employment opportunities in areas with the highest poverty 
rates (North, East, Moneragala, and estates)
Improve equality of opportunity across ethnic groups, regardless 
of where they reside
Increase labor force participation of women and ensure equal 
opportunity in access to jobs, political and private-sector 
leadership

GOVERNANCE

Improve the regulatory environment to allow firms to grow and 
enhance overall productivity in the economy
Review the regulatory role and participation of the public sector 
in the economy
Improve the efficiency of the public sector

SUSTAINABILITY

Sustain peace and security through long-term reconciliation 
efforts
Develop a more accountable and effective state
Place heavier emphasis on direct investment and equity portfolio 
flows than debt 
Preserve natural assets and address the impact of climate change
Address the long-term fiscal sustainability concerns related to 
population aging

Fiscal sustainability a key precondition for progress in all areas, 
including macroeconomic stability. Greater fiscal space allows for 
addressing equality of opportunity through increased social spending, 
especially important for inclusion. Efficiency of social protection has 
direct impact on ending poverty. Evidence base is strong.

Trade and adoption of new technologies promote diversification, 
external sustainability, and growth, which translates to good jobs. 
Overcoming skills mismatches contributes to growth and participation 
of the bottom 40 percent, including minorities and women. Evidence 
base is strong for skills and trade policy issues.

Urbanizing areas are associated with growth and an absolute majority 
of poor are proximate to these areas. Ensuring continued benefits 
of agglomeration will help progress for the majority of the poor. For 
those living in more remote areas, more targeted interventions will be 
needed to ensure equality of opportunity through improved service 
delivery and greater participation in the labor force. Evidence base is 
very strong.

Governance has cross-cutting impact on all other challenges. In 
particular, labor, land, and other regulation create major distortions 
in the economy. The size of the public sector leads to inefficient use of 
public resources and distorts labor markets. The ability of government 
to carry out core functions depends on effectiveness of the public 
sector. Evidence base is strong.

Peace is sine qua non for continued investment, growth, and 
personal well-being of large segment of the population. Sustaining 
the state’s institutional capability over the long term is integral 
competent facilitation of private-sector-led growth. Macro-economic 
and environmental sustainability are preconditions for continued 
progress as well as capitalizing on the country’s asset base. Evidence 
of associated risks is strong.

II. COUNTRY CONTEXT

20   |   II. Country Context  

A. Political and Social Context 

34. 
Sri Lanka is in many respects a development 
success story. With economic growth averaging over 
7 percent a year over the past five years on top of an av-
erage growth of 6 percent the preceding five years, Sri 
Lanka has made notable strides in reducing poverty and 
promoting shared prosperity. The national poverty head-
count ratio declined from 22.7 to 6.7 percent between 
2002 and 2012/13, with most of the reduction occurring 
in the early part of the past decade. Growth has been pro-
poor for most of the past decade, with consumption per 
capita of the bottom 40 percent growing at 3.3 percent 
a year, compared to 2.8 percent for the total population. 
Other human development indicators are also impressive 
by regional and lower middle-income standards. Sri Lanka 
outper forms nearby country comparators on most Mil-
lennium Development Goals (MDGs), particularly with re-
gard to poverty reduction, health, and environmental sus-
tainability. Coverage for primary school is near universal, 
while secondary and tertiary enrollment has substantially 
increased. Maternal and infant mortality rates are now at 
very low levels, and life expectancy, at 74 years, has been 
above its regional peers for over a decade. (See Appendix 
1.1 for review of Sri Lanka’s per formance on MDGs.)

35. 
The country’s achievements are impressive given 
the complex relationships among its communities that 
have led to conflict in the past. Sri Lanka is home to eth-
nic majority Sinhala; Sri Lankan Tamils, of whom many are 
concentrated in the north and east; Moors (Muslims) con-
centrated in the east, northwest, coastal areas of the south, 
and urban areas; Indian origin Tamils concentrated in the 
highlands and estate sector; and other less numerous eth-
nic groups including Malays and Burghers. Urban popula-
tions, particularly the capital Colombo, have diverse ethnic 
composition. Providing for social inclusion and peaceful 
co-existence and interaction 
among communities has 
been a persistent challenge, 
with inter-communal griev-
ances leading to several out-
bursts of violence before and 
after independence in 1948. 
These tensions were a driv-
ing force contributing to the 
emergence in the late 1970s 
of armed Tamil militant formations, which in turn came 
to be dominated by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam 
(LTTE). A four-phased war between the LTTE and the Sri 
Lankan state spanning 26 years ended with the military 
defeat of the LTTE and deaths of most of its leaders in May 
2009. Taken together with youth insurrections that led to

inclusion among

conflict in the 1970s and 1980s1, direct and indirect costs 
of conflict through additional expenditures, losses in phys-
ical and human capital, and foregone investment have 
been estimated to be equivalent to over 5 percent of GDP 
per year during the period 1978-2005.2 This calculation of 
economic costs does not include the impact of loss of life 
and other physical and psychological trauma. 

36. 
The end of the conflict has led to much greater 
security for Sri Lankans and an opportunity to achieve 
lasting reconciliation. There is no longer the pervasive 
threat of violence that had long impacted development. 
The state controls law and order across the island, result-
ing in improvements in overall security. Security in turn 
provides for higher quality of life and stimulates economic 
activity at many levels. At the same time, the major po-
litical parties associated with the Tamil population work 
within Sri Lanka’s institutional framework at provincial and 
national levels while continuing to articulate their com-
munity ’s issues. The main Tamil political grouping played 
an important role in supporting the January 2015 election 
of Sri Lanka’s new president, Maithripala Sirisena. Security 
and inclusive politics provide space for coming to a lasting 
settlement that would overcome grievances that fueled 
conflict in the past. 

37. 
There have been significant efforts to rebuild 
conflict-affected areas. Sri Lanka has heavily invested in 
developing infrastructure throughout the country over 
the past five years, including in the conflict-affected areas 
of the north and east. A total of 5.2 percent of all budget 
expenditures excluding interest payments were spent di-
rectly on reconstruction efforts in the Northern Province 
alone in the period 2009-2013.3 These efforts have includ-
ed a painstaking demining effort covering targeted areas 
comprising over 2000 square kilometers that is 95 percent 
complete as of the beginning of 2014, making farming 
possible in many fields which had been off limits. While 
levels of public service provision remain lower in the north 
and east, there has been visible progress in improving road 
and rail networks and installing housing, power transmis-
sion, water supply systems and other infrastructure. The 
roughly 700,000 internally displaced people caused by the 
conflict have almost all returned to their homes or have 
otherwise voluntarily resettled elsewhere. The population 
in former conflict areas continues to face many hurdles in 

1 
 In addition to conflict involving Sri Lankan Tamils, there were two 
insurrections of leftist political groups composed of mostly Sinhalese 
against the Sri Lankan state in 1971 and 1987-89. There was also conflict 
in preceding decades among Sri Lankan Tamil armed groups, ending 
with the LTTE virtually eliminating its rivals.

rebuilding their lives but resettlement after the conflict 
has been overall positive with 93 percent resettled on their 
own lands.4 

38. 
Particularly after the election of President Siris-
ena in 2015, the government has taken actions to ad-
dress grievances of the Sri Lankan Tamil community. 
Following the end of the conflict, the preceding govern-
ment established the LLRC and implemented several of 
the commission’s recommendations. In particular, North-
ern Provincial Council elections were held in 2013 and 
were won by the main Tamil opposition party. Steps to 
address grievances have been accelerated under Presi-
dent Sirisena, most notably : the appointment of a civilian 
as governor in the Northern Province; the commitment to 
a domestic mechanism to address issues of accountabili-
ty for allegations of misconduct during and particularly at 
the end of the conflict; and the return of some of the lands 
that had been taken for military bases in the North and 
East. The more pro-active stance of government responds 
to a key LLRC finding on the causes of conflict: “Successive 
governments since independence have been unable to 
fully resolve, and in some instances actually contributed to, 
communal tensions, particularly those involving the Tamil 
community.” While much remains to be done on reconcil-
iation, these steps work towards providing for long-term 
sense of security, justice and jobs for all communities, all of 
which are critical factors for avoiding renewal of conflict.5 

39. 
Sri Lanka is also at the threshold of major insti-
tutional and political reforms advocated by the new 
political leadership elected in 2015. Since the passage 
of its 1978 Constitution, Sri Lanka has been dominated 
by an “Executive Presidency” that enjoyed wide-ranging 
powers, including the unlimited right to appoint and dis-
miss key officers of nearly all state institutions and no ac-
countability to other state institutions. The preponderance 
of the presidency created a centralized government and 
decision-making apparatus with weak checks and balanc-
es. Sirisena’s victory in elections over two-term President 
Rajapaksa, the country ’s dominant political figure for the 
preceding nine years, was based on a platform of good 
governance that received diverse support. His govern-
ment has prioritized securing passage of constitutional 
amendments to reduce the powers of the presidency 
while strengthening parliament, as well as legislation set-
ting up a right to information regime, strengthened audit 
and procurement regimes, and more vigorous anti-corrup-
tion efforts.

22   |   II. Country Context  

40. 
Institutional reforms and efforts at reconciliation 
are occurring against the backdrop of a fluid Sri Lank-
an polity. There are two major national parties and a large 
number of smaller parties, including several with affiliation 
to ethnic groups. Electoral competition has been robust at 
national and provincial levels, most notably in the recent 
presidential elections. At the same time, public figures ex-
ercise substantial autonomy – with prominent instances 
of switching party allegiances, most notably in the recent 
presidential elections. The fluid polity has prompted for-
mal and informal coalition building as well as the need for 
regular attention from the country ’s leadership to sustain 
support from often diverse bases. The fluidity of the en-
vironment has been evident in securing the passage of 
constitutional and electoral reforms that required exten-
sive political negotiations. A new government involving 
a grand coalition has been formed after the August 2015 
general elections and is in the process of formulating its 
economic and other policies. 

41. As Sri Lanka aspires to become a higher mid-
dle-income country, it will need to adjust its develop-
ment model. Growth in the last five years is in substantial 
part due to a “peace dividend”, which included significant 
reconstruction efforts. Going forward, economic growth 
will likely require continued structural changes in the 
economy towards greater diversification and productiv-
ity increases and a reduction in the role of agricultural 
employment from its present share of a third of the pop-
ulation. Although Sri Lanka has excelled in overcoming 
human development challenges typical to a low-income 
country, its service delivery systems in education, health 
and other areas must now adjust to face new and chang-
ing demands typical of a MIC. Imperatives to improve so-
cial safety nets will increase owing to an aging population 
that has passed its demographic peak. Finally, increasing 
affluence and information will lead to higher expectations 
for the state to per form in order to facilitate growth, pro-
vide a higher level of services, and demonstrate increasing 
responsiveness to a more demanding citizenry. 

B. Poverty and Shared Prosperity 

42. 
Economic growth in Sri Lanka has been among 
the fastest in South Asia in recent years. Growth has av-
eraged 6.3 percent between 2002 and 2013, with per cap-
ita GDP rising from US$869 in 2000 to US$3,280 in 2013. 
Moreover, the average growth rate accelerated to 7.5 per-
cent between 2010 and 2013, reflecting a peace dividend 
and an aggressive policy thrust towards growth since the 
internal civil conflict ended. This growth is high as com-
pared to regional and MIC peers, and has been accompa-
nied by low inflation (Figure 2.1). Year 2014 also saw a con-
tinuation of the momentum with the economy growing by

7.4 percent compared to a 7.3 percent growth reported in 
2013 on robust growth in industry and services.

43. 
Strong economic growth for over a decade has 
led to an important decline in poverty and promoted 
shared prosperity. Poverty, measured by per capita con-
sumption, fell from 22.7 percent in 2002 to 6.7 percent in 
2012/13 using the national poverty line6, which is equiva-
lent to about US$1.50 in PPP terms. Extreme poverty fell 
from 13.2 to 3.2 percent using the US$1.25-a-day poverty 
line, while moderate poverty fell from 56.2 to 32.1 percent 
using the $2.50-a-day poverty line, commonly used across 
middle-income countries (Appendix 1.2), over the same 
time period (Table 1).7

44. 
Poverty reduction measured by per capita con-
sumption is also reflected in increased per capita in-
comes, particularly for the poor. Between 2006/07 and 
2012/2013, average per capita incomes grew only slightly, 
about 2 percent overall (Figure 2.2A). Growth in household 
income reported here is on per capita terms, and contrasts 

6 
 Given the ongoing conflict, a few regions were not included in the 
2002 household survey. When looking at comparable regions, the decline 
in poverty was from 22.7 percent in 2002 to 6.1 percent in 2012/13. 
7 
 The national poverty line is expected to be updated soon in order to: 
(i) update household consumption patterns (the current line assumes the 
2002 consumption pattern), (ii) incorporate methodological best prac-
tice particularly with respect to the minimum calorie requirement and 
the appropriate amount of non-food expenditure consistent with that 
minimum threshold, and (iii) set a more ambitious benchmark, appropri-
ate for a country at Sri Lanka’s stage of development, to measure future 
progress against poverty.

with the figures on total household income reported by 
the Department of Census ans Statistics (DCS), which re-
mained roughly constant in real terms. The discrepancy 
arises mainly because average household size fell during 
this period. Because larger households require more in-
come than smaller households to maintain the same 
standard of living, per-capita income is preferred to total 
income as a measure of household welfare. However, for 
poorer households measured as those with lower per capi-
ta consumption, growth in real per capita income was over 
twice as fast, and was in line with similar growth rates in 
per capita consumption.

45. 
The reduction in poverty for the 2002 – 2012/13 
period is also reflected in multidimensional measures. 
Households in the bottom 40 percent were increasing-
ly able to afford to purchase non-food items, as the food 
budget share for this group fell from 67 percent in 2002 to 
56 percent in 2012/13. Ownership of durable assets also 
rose, especially among the poorest. Primary education at-
tendance is essentially universal. Secondary school atten-
dance is also high and continued to nudge upward during 
this period. Completion, on the other hand, saw a major 
increase, as the share of 17 and 18 year olds who complet-
ed secondary school rose from 40 to 60 percent between 
2002 and 2012/13. Health indicators also improved during 
this period. The rate of infant mortality fell from 13 to eight 
children per thousand births, and the rate of under-nutri-
tion, while still high, decreased from 30 to 25 percent (Fig-
ure 2.2B). 

46. Despite the reduction in extreme poverty, living 
standards remain low for most Sri Lankans and a large

share of the population remains vulnerable to pover-
ty. Despite the low levels of extreme poverty, roughly one 
quarter of Sri Lankans are nearly poor, as defined by living 
above the official poverty line but below US$2.50 per day 
in 2005 PPP terms. The living 
standards of the near-poor 
are closer to those of the 
poor than those living above 
US$2.50 per day. For exam-
ple, the near-poor spend 
an average of 59 percent of 
their budget on food, only 
six percentage points less 
than the poor, as opposed to 42 percent by households 
consuming more than US$2.50 per day (2005 PPP).

Despite low levels 
of extreme poverty, 
roughly one quarter 
of Sri Lankans are 
nearly poor

47. Moreover, while the decline in poverty was 
strong, it was below what one could have expected giv-
en the sustained high growth rates over the last decade 
Indeed, a 1 percent increase in per-capita GDP reduced the 
US1.25-a-day poverty rate by only 0.2 percentage points 
while a similar increase in growth led to stronger reduc-
tions in extreme poverty in other regional and developing 
countries (Figure 2.3). It has, however, been in line with 
other post-conflict countries.

48. Growth was higher in the post-war period but 
the strongest reduction in poverty and improvement 
in shared prosperity occurred in the early part of the 
10-year period covered by the past three Household 

The strongest 
reduction in poverty 
was from 2002 to 
2009/10

Income and Expenditure Surveys (HIES). Per capita con-
sumption of the bottom 40 percent grew at a rate of 3.5 
percent for the 2002-2012/13 period, considerably faster 
than the average growth of 3 percent for the total popu-
lation over the same time period.8 Simple decompositions 
show that most of the reduction in poverty was due to 
strong consumption growth, 
which shifted 
the entire 
distribution to the right, as 
opposed to 
large chang-
es within the distribution. 
However, when the decade 
is broken into sub-periods, 
growth was disproportion-
ately in favor of the poorer half of the population (“pro-
poor”) up until 2009. Although poverty continued to de-
cline between 2009/10 and 2012/13, growth of the bottom 
half of the distribution was slower than growth for the top 
half, leading to an increase in inequality. This can easily be 
seen in the growth incidence curves (GICs) shown in Figure 
2.4. The x-axis shows households ordered from poorest to 
richest, while the y-axis shows growth in household con-
sumption. Between 2002 and 2009/10, growth was faster 
at the bottom of the distribution, thus leading to a nega-
tively sloped GIC – denoting pro-poor growth. In contrast,

between 2009/10 and 2012/13, growth at the top of the

49. 
The most recent growth pattern has led to an in-
crease in inequality. The corollary of stronger growth for 
the top of the distribution between 2009/10 and 2013/14 
is that inequality increased. 
Standard measures of 
in-
equality, such as the Gini co-
efficient, increased from 0.36 
in 2009/10 to 0.39 in 2012/13, 
leading to an inequality level 
almost as high as the one 
registered in 2006/07, before 
the end of the civil war (Ta-
ble 1 on page 13). In effect, rising inequality tempered the 
poverty-reducing impact of growth. 

Growth was pro-poor 
up until 2009 while 
inequality increased 
between 2009/10 
and 2013/14

50. 
Inequality has not only increased, but disparities 
across the different ethnic and religious groups remain. 
Poverty declined fastest for Sri Lankan Moors (Muslims): if 
in 2002 one out of four Sri Lanka Moors was poor, 10 years 
later only about one every 18 Sri Lanka Moors was poor 
(or 6 percent), very close to the share of Sinhalese who are 
poor. In 2012/13, Sri Lankan Tamils had the highest rates 
of poverty among ethnic groups (Figure 2.5A). Among the 
different religious groups surveyed in 2012/13 (which, in 
most cases, have a strong correlation with ethnicity), Hin-
dus had the highest poverty rates: 12 percent were poor, 
as opposed to 6 percent of Buddhists, Muslims and Chris-
tians (Figure 2.5B).

51. Other multidimensional measures also show in-
equality in outcomes. Sri Lanka successfully reached full 
enrollment in primary education (grades 1 to 9), but ed-
ucation attainment of higher levels of education remains 
strictly correlated to the well-being of households. For ex-
ample, educational attainment among the poor is almost 
half of what it is for the non-poor. Although the level of 
education attainment has slowly increased both for poor 
and non-poor individuals, poor individuals have a very low 
likelihood of completing collegiate education. Similarly, 
the poor are characterized by having lower access to elec-
tricity, telephone, water, and sanitation and having to trav-
el further to reach health services. These characteristics are 
especially true for those living on less than US$1.25-a-day 
(Appendix 1.3)

52. Moreover, there is significant locational con-
centration of poverty in Sri Lanka. This is true both for 
monetary and multidimensional outcomes, 
including 
education, nutrition and access to services. The share of 
people living under the national poverty line, known as 
the headcount rate, is concentrated in three main areas 
(Figure 2.6). The first is the former conflict districts in the 
Northern Province, Mullaitivu, Manar, and, to a lesser ex-
tent, Kilinochchi District. The second is Batticaloa in the 
Eastern Province, and the last one is Moneragala in the Uva 
Province. Areas with higher poverty rates also tend to have 
a larger portion of the bottom 40 percent.

53. Notwithstanding high rates of poverty in specif-
ic remote districts, the majority of the poor and as well 
as the bottom 40 percent live in populous, effectively 
urban areas in the center of the island. The location of

the poor broadly corresponds to the location of Sri Lan-
ka’s population as a whole. Figure 2.7 shows estimates of 
the number of people living in poverty. Kurunegala in the 
center of the country, for instance, is home to 7.6 percent 
of the country ’s poor people even though only 7 percent 
of its population lives under the official poverty line. In 
contrast, Mullaitivu, Kilinochchi, and Mannar in the North, 
have very high estimated poverty rates (20.8-31.4 percent), 
but account for less than 5 percent of poor people nation-
wide due to the low population density in those regions.

C. Understanding Changes in Poverty

Increased labor 
incomes account for 
nearly 60% of reported 
poverty reduction

54. Between 2002 and 
2012/13, most of the re-
duction in poverty was 
due to higher labor in-
comes,9 and, in particular, 
to increased earnings, as 
opposed to higher em-
ployment or higher trans-
fers. Most of the increase in labor income was, in turn, 
due to increased returns to work both in and outside of

 Growth in real per capita labor income reported here is in line with 
overall growth in per capita income, partly due to smaller households as 
discussed in paragraph 41 and footnote 6 above.

agriculture (Figure 2.8). Increased returns to agriculture 
accounted for about 31 percent of the decline, of which 
roughly two-thirds were higher returns to self-employed 
farmers. The other main factor was an increase in the re-
turns to paid non-farm work, which accounted for 28 per-
cent of the poverty decline. Combined, increases in the 
returns to work explain nearly 60 percent of the reported 
poverty reduction. These increases in returns are associat-
ed with an increase in average real wages, which could be 
due to either higher productivity or improved relative pric-
es for the poor, given many are net producers. The finding 
of sustained increases in real wages over the decade is in 
line with results from alternate surveys conducted by the 
Central Bank, which show a sharp increase in services and 
government real wages from 2002 to 2013 and in industry 
real wages in 2013. 

55. 
Private transfers in the form of remittances, and 
the increase in the working age population also helped. 
Between 2002 and 2012/13 remittances increased from 
0.4 to 0.9 percent of total incomes and total consumption 
of the poorest 10 percent of households (Figure 2.9). Even 
though this was an increase relative to the incomes of the 
poor, most remittances in absolute amounts go to the 
richer part of the population. The age composition of the 
workforce also contributed to poverty reduction. The com-
position of the workforce in terms of gender, ethnicity and 
religious composition remained stable over the course 
of the decade. However, the share of 15-29 year-olds de-

clined from 26 to 20 percent between 2002 and 2012/13, 
making the overall workforce relatively more experienced, 
and thus likely to bring in higher labor incomes. It is also 
a strong signal that the population is aging, which raises 
concerns about long-term fiscal sustainability (see Chap-
ter VI on economic sustainability and aging).

Figure 2.10 Increased labor demand is reflected in wage and employment growth 

56. 
In contrast to private transfers, 
public transfers did not make a net con-
tribution to poverty reduction over the 
past decade. Public transfers (particular-
ly the Samurdhi program) declined in real 
terms, and as such, its net contribution to 
reducing poverty was negative.10 In fact, re-
sults from analysis of the HIES show that the 
decline in poverty would have been 10 per-
cent greater had the real value of Samurdhi 
remained constant. Finally, while both the 
improvements in education and the demo-
graphic dividend (the larger share of work-
ing-age adults) helped to reduce poverty, 
these were relatively small contributors to 
poverty reduction (Figure 2.8).

10 That is, if nothing else had changed, poverty 
would have increased simply because the value of 
these transfers was lower in real terms in 2012/13 rel-
ative to 2002. There are multiple social programs in 
Sri Lanka. The main direct cash transfer program is the 
Samurdhi Poverty Alleviating Program, which includes 
an income-support scheme that grants a monthly al-
lowance according to the number of family members 
in each household, an insurance scheme that provides 
cash allowances during births, deaths and hospitaliza-
tion of family members, nutrition programs for preg-
nant and lactating mothers and children of beneficiary 
families, and scholarship programs for children.

57. 
It is very difficult to attribute the reasons for 
the increase in labor incomes. To the extent that there 
was both an increase in employment as well as increases 
in wages, this is consistent with an overall increase in de-
mand for workers. Increases in labor demand, as indicated 
by increases in employment and/or wages, appear to be 
broadly spread across many sectors rather than concen-
tratedin a few (Figure 2.10). Despite relatively high annual 
changes in wages in the agriculture sector it still experi-
enced a decline in employment, reflecting that overall 
returns are lower compared to other sectors. The increase 
in construction employment reflects the overall growth 
in the construction sector, especially after the end of the 
conflict.

58. 
There are four potential drivers of the increase in 
labor incomes and its poverty impacts over the last 10 
years. The following section 
focuses on these drivers: (i) 
a slow structural transfor-
mation away from relatively 
unproductive 
agriculture 
and into industry and ser-
vices that led to aggregate 
productivity 
increases; 
(ii) agglomeration effects 
around key urban areas; (iii) 
domestic demand growth, 
including public-sector in-
vestment; and (iv) domestic 
and international food price 

There are four 
potential drivers 
of increased labor 
incomes: structural 
transformation, 
agglomeration, 
domestic demand and 
food price increases

increases that led to higher labor earnings for agricultural 
workers.

Structural Transformation 

59. 
The economy saw a shift from agriculture to in-
dustry and services in the last 15 years (Figure 2.11A). 
The share of value added from agriculture fell from 19.9 
percent of GDP in 2000 to 10.8 percent in 2013 and is ex-
pected to have declined to 10 percent in 2014,11 while the 
share of value added from industries increased from 26.5 
to 32.5 percent over the same period. Employment in agri-
culture declined from 36 to 31 percent between 2000 and 
2012 and increased in industry and services over the same 
period (Figure 2.11B). It is noteworthy that a major part of 
the decline in agricultural employment (and rise in indus-
try) occurred only in 2012, the last year measured.

60. 
The shift toward employment in the industry 
sector and the expansion in services was associated 
with increases in productivity. Total factor productiv-
ity (TFP) growth accounted for about half of Sri Lanka’s 
growth over the last decade contributing on average 3¼ 
percentage points per year, rising to about 3½ percentage 
points recently.12 A range of empirical approaches suggest 
that potential growth has risen by almost 1 percentage

This appears to reflect equally capital 
deepening (through increased invest-
ment on infrastructure and equipment) 
and 
improved 
factor productivity, 
with labor ’s contribution broadly un-
changed. Most of the increase in pro-
ductivity took place within the industry 
and service sectors (Figure 2.12A), but 
an inter-sector shift in employment 
away from agriculture and into indus-
try and services also played a role and 
could partly explain increases in labor 
incomes (Figure 2.12B). 

Agglomeration Effects

61. Along with 
this structural 
transformation, Sri Lanka has been 
experiencing a dynamic spatial 
transformation process of urbaniza-
tion and agglomeration in the past 
two decades. Urbanization13 and ag-

13 According to official estimates, only 15.7 
percent of Sri Lanka’s population lives in urban 
areas, making it the least urbanized country in 
South Asia and MICs. This is due to the country ’s 
conservative definition of urban as population 
living in ‘town’ and ‘municipal’ administrative 
units last demarcated in the 1980s. This does not 
capture Sri Lanka’s level of population agglomer-
ation described here. A 2010 agglomeration in-

glomeration have been occurring in two forms: one is the 
prime multi-city agglomeration of Kandy-Colombo-Galle 
in the Western Province, which is the largest in the coun-
try and has also experienced the bulk of the growth. The 
second form is a few localized single-city agglomerations 
in the eastern and northern parts of the country, mainly 
around Trincomalee, Batticaloa-Akkaraipattu, and Jaffna. 
This spatial transformation process has profound implica-
tions for both economic growth and alleviating poverty 
and vulnerability. The agglomeration spawning from the 
Colombo Metropolitan Region along the two corridors 
to Kandy and Galle/Matara is evolving to become a func-
tional multi-city urban agglomeration. Recent growth, in 
particular, around Colombo, Kandy and Galle, including 
the corridors that connect those cities, is evident in the red 
lighting in Figure 2.13, which represents night-time lights 
that were present in 2012 but not in 2002 or 1992. 

62. Agglomeration may have been fueling growth 
and partly determining national performance. Eco-
nomic growth in Sri Lanka has been partly driven by 
highly built-up areas. Using night-time lights data as a 
proxy for GDP for the 2001-2011 period shows that a small 
number of regions are responsible for a larger share of 
national growth. In fact, 10 percent of Divisional Secretar-
iat Divisions (DSDs) contributed nearly 30 percent of the 
country ’s growth over the period (Figure 2.14A). Further-
more, only 20 percent of DSDs contributed almost half of 

dex which takes into consideration features associated with urbanization 
calculated that Sri Lanka a 47 percent rate of agglomeration.

all growth in Sri Lanka. Satellite imagery on built-up areas 
by DSDs can be combined with night-light information to 
see the correlation between built-up areas and growth. 
Not surprisingly, a larger share of built-up areas is posi-
tively correlated to national growth measured using night-
time lights (Figure 2.14B). That is, urbanization and growth 
have been moving hand in hand.

Increases in Aggregate Demand, including 
Government Infrastructure Projects

63. Domestic demand was largely responsible for 
growth. Private consumption accounted for 67 percent 
of GDP in 2013, having expanded by 6 percent a year 
on average between 2002 and 2013 (Figure 2.15A). Pri-
vate investment, on the other hand, accounted for 23 per-
cent of GDP in 2013, after an average growth of 9 percent a 
year during the same time period. In addition, public infra-
structure spending grew at an average rate of 18 percent 
a year between 2002 and 2013, and made up 6 percent of 
GDP by 2013 (Figure 2.15B). The impulse coming from ex-
ports, on the other hand, was very small, with an average 
growth rate of 4 percent a year, so that the contribution 
of exports to aggregate demand declined from 35 to 26 
percent of GDP between 2002 and 2013.

Increased Commodity Prices

64. Higher real wages, especially in agriculture, 
played a key role in reducing poverty. Although ag-
riculture is no longer a major contributor to growth (ac-
counting for under 11 percent of GDP), around one-third

of the population still remains engaged in, and dependent 
on, agriculture. Real wage growth in the agriculture sec-
tor averaged 5.7 percent annually from 2006 to 2012/13, 
causing poverty to fall more rapidly among self-employed 
farmers and agricultural workers, ahead of workers in oth-
er sectors. Wages in the industrial sector increased by 3.6 
percent annually, while wages in the service sector grew 
by 3.1 percent on average, led by trade (4.6 
percent) and transportation (6.0 percent) 
(Figure 2.16). During the same time, the share 
of workers in agriculture continued to decline 
by 1.3 percentage points, from 32 to 30.7 per-
cent, with young workers shifting out of ag-
riculture more quickly. Minimum agriculture 
wages for employed farm workers rose con-
siderably between 2009 and 2012, which may 
have also pushed up real agriculture wages.

In contrast, rising domestic and international 
food prices may have provided space for the increase 
in the agricultural minimum wage and corresponding 
increases in agricultural wages. Rising food prices, par-
ticularly from 2006 to 2009, provided additional profits 
to agricultural producers In addition, international prices 
for tea rose more than 50 percent, from $2.1 to $3.3 per 
kg between 2006 and 2009. This occurred despite little 
change in yields. The increase in the price for tea provid-
ed space for increasing the real minimum wage for agri-
cultural workers (Figure 2.17A), although they continue to 
be lower than wages in industry and services. Agricultural 
wages, unlike those for industrial and service sector wag-
es, tracked these minimum wage increases almost exactly 
(Figure 2.17B).

D. Macroeconomic Challenges to 
Poverty Reduction and Shared 
Prosperity 

67. 
Recent growth has been mainly led by the 
non-tradable sectors. Sri Lanka’s real GDP grew by 43 per-
cent from 2009 to 2014. The top four sectors contributing 
to 50 percent of the total growth during the period were 
all non-tradable sectors: construction, transport, domestic 
trade and banking, and insurance and real estate (Figure 
2.18). Reflecting the intensity of a needed post-conflict in-
frastructure development thrust, the construction sector 
alone contributed to 16.8 percent of the total growth while 
growing by 109 percent in real terms. The transport sector 
contributed to 14 percent of the total growth, reflecting 
improved transportation infrastructure and increased ve-

hicle registrations. Domestic trade (11.1 percent), import 
trade (7.8 percent) and financial services (8.2 percent) were 
the other main contributors 
to growth. Less prominent 
were the agriculture sec-
tors. These sectors contrib-
uted to 5.3 percent of the 
growth while all other man-
ufacturing/service 
sectors 
collectively accounted 
for 
44.7 percent of the growth. 
Moreover, Sri Lanka’s share 
of manufacturing output, which was 18.7 percent in 2000, 
rose to 19.5 percent in 2005 and declined to 17.2 percent 
by 2014 due to faster growth in the services sector.

The top four sectors 
contributing up to 
50 percent of total 
growth were all non-
tradable sectors

68. 
 Reliance on non-tradable sectors for growth 
could make it difficult to sustain the momentum in the 
long run. While data is lacking on the breakdown between 
private- and public-sector involvement across industries, 
there is strong indication that public investment to rebuild 
following the end of conflict is responsible for much of the 
proportionately large growth in construction as well as 
transport (which is inclusive of some transport infrastruc-
ture). It would appear unlikely that these sectors would 
underpin sustained growth going into the future owing to 
fiscal space limitations as well as a decline in the need for 
post-conflict reconstruction. More generally, construction 
and transport infrastructure are not likely to be sources of 
sustained, consistent growth. 

69. 
 In contrast, there has been a steady decline in 
commodity exports. Before 1977, Sri Lanka’s develop-
ment strategy, based on import substitution, aimed to

create a comprehensive welfare state. Post-1977, reforms 
aimed to liberalize the foreign trade regime and Sri Lanka 
was seen as the first country in South Asia to significantly 
open its borders to trade and foreign direct investment. 
In the decades that followed, trade of goods and services 
increased to 89 percent of GDP in 2000, with tea and high-
end apparel exports leading 
the way (Figure 2.19). How-
ever, after the beginning of 
the new millennium, trade 
steadily declined reaching 
54 percent of GDP in 2013. 
FDI remains below 2 percent 
of GDP five years after the 
end of armed conflict. The decline in openness and stag-
nating FDI took place when the rest of the world was inte -
grating more strongly and global trade was accelerating. 
Sri Lanka’s world market share has consequently declined 
to levels last seen in the 1980s.

the value chain as well as fostering the development of

new industries. Figure 2.20 shows a comparative develop-
ment of the product space14 of Sri Lanka and Thailand over 
the same period. Sri Lanka experienced a rather limited 
growth of economic activities adjacent to existing indus-
tries; lower development of new industries; and exporting 
sectors remained at the periphery of the economy. In con-
trast, Thailand had a similar export structure to Sri Lanka in 
1980 but a much different one by 2009. Thailand now has 
much lower activity in resource-based and labor-intensive 
exports and instead has dense clusters in electronics, mi-
crocircuits and machinery.

71. While the trade deficit has recently improved, Sri 
Lankan exports face structural challenges. In particu-
lar, the tradable sectors are facing rising production costs, 
particularly for Sri Lanka’s main agricultural exports (tea 
and rubber).15 Similarly, although garment exports have 
increased in nominal terms and there has been movement 
to higher added-value production, the share of garment 
exports relative to GDP has continuously declined. Weaker 
external demand from the European Union (EU) and the 
United States and rising relative labor costs has also affect-

diversification and economic growth. It measures the distance between 
a pair of products based on the probability that they are exported by the 
same countries.

15 This has always been an issue as plantation workers (tea and rubber) 
have historically been very well organized under political leadership of 
the Ceylon Workers Congress. Their strong bargaining power has driven 
a wedge between wage and productivity trends. Many workers are paid 
even if they do not have work.

On the fiscal front, low and 
declining fiscal revenues have become 
a key macro-economic concern for Sri 
Lanka. The tax revenue-to-GDP ratio, 
which amounted to 24.2 percent in 1978, 
declined to 14.5 percent in 2000 and 
reached 10.7 percent in 2014 despite an 
annual increase in GDP per capita of 11 
percent a year (Figure 2.22). This partly led 
to large fiscal deficits, particularly before 
end of conflict, when Sri Lanka averaged 
deficits of around 7-8 percent of GDP a 
year. Over the past five years, the govern-
ment has made an effort towards fiscal 
consolidation, reducing the budget deficit 
from 9.9 percent in 2009 to 6 percent in 
2014. 

75. 
Despite fiscal consolidation 
efforts, Sri Lanka continues to face 
public debt risks. Although much im-
proved from earlier years where the debt 
stock was over 100 percent of GDP, public debt stood at 
75.5 percent of GDP at end-2014, posing macroeconomic 
risks if growth slows in coming years. Increases in current 
spending in 2015 have been offset with one-time revenue 
measures, implying long-term revenue streams will be re-
quired (see Chapter III for detailed discussion). The compo-
sition of debt is also changing, moving from concessional 
lending to shorter-term commercial borrowings. Howev-
er, during 2014 there has been a systematic conversion of 
short term T-bill issuance into longer term T-bonds, while 
foreign holdings of T-bills and bonds have been contained

stagnant, and the sector has been challenged by drought 
and lower demand from the Middle East.

Pressure on Sri Lanka’s balance of payments 
caused by persistent trade deficits has been offset 
partially by strong remittance inflows and a growing 
role for tourism. Collectively, remittances and tourism in-
creased from 8.5 percent in 2000 to 12.4 percent of GDP in 
2014 (Figure 2.21). Remittances alone grew from 7 percent 
to 9.5 percent of GDP during the same period. On average, 
these two sources covered 92 percent of the 
trade deficit from 2000 to 2013, and were able 
to cover the entire trade deficit in 2014. The cur-
rent account deficit declined from 7.8 percent of 
GDP in 2011 to 2.7 percent of GDP in 2014.

73. 
The current account deficit has been fi-
nanced mostly by external borrowing, rather 
than through FDI. Much of this external bor-
rowing by the public and private sectors went 
to finance the country ’s rebuilding following 
the end of the conflict. Despite this borrowing 
to cover current account deficits, Sri Lanka has 
been able to reduce its debt to GDP ratio in the 
past five years thanks to fast growth, relatively 
low real interest rates and a stable exchange 
rate. This also shows where the risks are: a slow-
down in growth, increasingly commercial terms 
on new borrowing, and exchange rate volatility 
may reverse the decline in the level of external 
debt-to-GDP.

at 12.5 percent of the outstanding value (Central Bank, 
2015). About 44 percent of the public debt stock is exter-
nal, so that exchange rate fluctuations and any rupee de -
preciation could risk deteriorating the debt indicators.

76. More generally, twin deficits in the fiscal and 
current accounts are mirrored by low national sav-
ings, with a persistent savings-investment gap being 
financed mostly through debt-creating flows over the 
last decade. National savings has averaged about 25 per-
cent of GDP since 2010, while national investment was as 
high as 31 percent of GDP.16 Most of this gap has been cov-
ered by debt-creating flows, as opposed to FDI over the 
last decade. Despite strong GDP growth, the external debt 
amounted to about 57 percent of GDP at end-2014. 

E. Identifying Drivers and  
Constraints to Poverty Reduction 
and Shared Prosperity 

77. 
The context outlined in this section sets the 
stage for a systematic diagnostic of drivers and con-
straints to poverty reduction and shared prosperity 
going forward. Sri Lanka’s political, social, and economic 
features are the result of a wide variety of factors. These 
same factors, particularly the more proximate factors that 
are in effect at present, are expected to drive or constrain 
continued progress on the twin goals of poverty reduc-
tion and shared prosperity. At the same time, there are 
new trends and emerging opportunities that will also 
play a role in shaping Sri Lanka’s development trajectory 
in the coming years. The goal of this SCD is to take stock 
of these factors, identify their relative importance, and set 
out what would therefore be priorities to be addressed in 
order to end extreme poverty and promote shared pros-
perity. The SCD focuses on drivers and constraints of prog-
ress in the next five years, corresponding to the term of 
the new government to be formed after elections in the 
summer of 2015.

78. 
This diagnostic is based on a systematic and 
detailed review of key potential factors impacting 
progress on the twin goals. In order to identify these 
constraints we used a hybrid framework that combines 
the Hausman, Rodrik and Velasco (2005) growth diag-
nostics methodology with the Bussolo and Lopez-Calva 
(2014) assets-based framework as detailed in Appendix 
1.4. The framework was used as a way to organize and 
discipline the analysis by identifying a broad range of 22 
areas where there were possible constraints to, or drivers 
of, progress on the twin goals. Sri Lanka’s per formance 
in each area was assessed and weighed for their relative 
impact on achieving the twin goals. This preliminary sys-
tematic analysis was then presented in a set of detailed 
consultations with multiple stakeholders, including gov-
ernment, academia, think tanks, the private sector, civil 
society organizations, and international organizations to 
validate the findings, determine the relative importance 
of issues identified in each of the 22 areas, and identify 
knowledge gaps. 

79. Discussion around the preliminary analysis and 
ensuing consultations led to a consensus around four 
major themes, which form the basis for organizing this 
report and the major challenges to progress along the 
twin goals. The themes are: (i) Fiscal sustainability and the 
need to ensure fiscal space for development; (ii) Fostering 
growth and jobs for the bottom 40 percent; and (iii) ensur-
ing spatial and social inclusion. The fourth major theme – 
the importance of more effective and efficient governance 
– is a cross-cutting issue in all three chapters, reflecting the 
critical roles of public-sector management, government ’s 
inter face with the private sector, and governance’s impact 
on inclusion. These four major themes were recurrent in 
discussions with multiple stakeholders in terms of the se-
verity of constraints they pose for achieving the twin goals 
of ending poverty and promoting shared prosperity. The 
next three chapters describe each of these themes and 
discuss the priority areas. Those are followed by a chapter 
on economic, social and environmental sustainability con-
cerns, which are also critical in achieving the twin goals. 
The final chapter summarizes the main findings and pro-
vides conclusions.

KEY PRIORITIES IN ADDRESSING THE FISCAL CHALLENGE

 ■

 ■ Maintaining continued commitment to fiscal sustainability will require long-term revenue measures.
Simplifying the tax regime and improving tax administration to increase the tax base could reverse the declining 
revenue trend.
Low revenues and rigidity in expenditures undercut investment in human development while higher levels of 
financing and effectiveness thereof are needed to meet Sri Lanka’s needs as it transitions to a MIC.
Inefficiencies in social protection and management of the public service particularly undermine efficient use of 
resources.

 ■

The Challenge of Sustaining Fiscal 
Discipline 

80. 
Sri Lanka’s government has demonstrated a 
strong commitment to fiscal consolidation in the re-
cent past. In the decade before end of conflict, the coun-
try averaged fiscal deficits of around 7-8 percent. However, 
over the past five years, the government has trimmed bud-
get deficits each year, going from 9.9 percent in 2009 to an 
estimated 5.7 percent in 2014. The public debt, which was 
hovering around 106 percent of GDP in 2002, was reduced 
to 75.5 percent of GDP by 2014. Moreover, the government 
has committed to reduce the fiscal deficit to 3.8 percent 
of GDP by 2017 and public debt to 60 percent of GDP by 
2020. With the exception of a spike in 2009 linked to mas-
sive recovery and rehabilitation needs immediately after 
the war ’s end, this has been achieved by reducing govern-
ment expenditures. 

Long term increases 
in revenue will be 
needed to reduce 
the fiscal deficit and 
public debt

82. Honoring commitments initiated in 2015 while 
maintaining continued commitment to fiscal sustain-
ability will require measures to secure long-term rev-
enue increases. Fiscal debt 
sustainability analysis has 
shown that slower-than-pro-
jected growth, higher prima-
ry deficits, or higher borrow-
ing costs could quickly lead 
to sustainability concerns. 
With public debt amount-
ing to 76 percent of GDP at 
end-2014, continued com-
mitment to fiscal consolidation is critical. Reflecting the 
government ’s commitment to sustainability, the budget-
ed fiscal deficit is expected to narrow in 2015. However, 
increases in recurrent expenditures are to be financed by 
one-time taxes, ambitious revenue targets for existing tax-
es, and cuts in public investment, leaving very little room 
to maneuver. Moreover, recurrent spending increases on 

81. 
This overall strong performance masks 
four structural weaknesses in the govern-
ment’s fiscal position: low, declining fiscal 
revenues; increasing rigidity of expendi-
tures; insufficient spending on key public 
goods and services, particularly for human 
development; and inefficiencies in the pub-
lic sector. Preserving fiscal balance will become 
increasingly challenging owing to an extremely 
low revenue base combined with long-term-ex-
penditure commitments including a relatively 
large public service. If current trends continue, 
the government will have limited fiscal space 
to facilitate development. At the same time, 
experience of regional and MIC comparators 
suggests that Sri Lanka is not investing enough 
in human development. The country ’s past suc-
cess in these areas cannot be expected to con-
tinue without significant increases in spending, 
which in turn requires greater fiscal space.

wages and transfers initiated in 2015 will need to be sus-
tained once the one-time revenue measures expire. Given 
government plans to increase expenditures on education 
and health from their present low levels, long-term in-
creases in revenue will be needed in order to reduce the 
fiscal deficit and public debt. 

A. Low and Declining Fiscal Revenues

83. 
Sri Lanka now has one of the lowest tax reve-
nue-to-GDP ratios in the world, and it has been declin-
ing for decades. The country ’s tax revenue-to-GDP ratio 
amounted to 24.2 percent in 1978, after which it declined 
to 14.5 percent in 2000 and to 11.6 percent in 2013 (Figure 
3.1). The decline is in large part a reflection of Sri Lanka’s 
strong GDP growth17 with revenues increasing in abso-
lute terms. Nonetheless, the fact that revenues have not 
kept pace with economic growth and barely kept pace 
with inflation in absolute terms is a continuing constraint 
on the budget. The government has signaled the need to  
reverse this trend in recent budgets, each year planning 
for a significant improvement in the tax revenue-to-GDP 
ratio over the medium term. However, projections of rev-
enue increases have consistently failed to materialize (Fig-
ure 3.2A). In comparison, most of the other South Asian 
countries as well as middle-income countries have seen 
modest improvements in tax collection in the recent past. 
(Figure 3.2B). 

84. 
Indirect taxes account for 80 percent of Sri Lan-
ka’s tax revenue. The country has lower-than-expected 
revenues from taxes on income, profits, or capital (direct 
taxes) and higher collections from international trade and 
from good and services (indirect taxes) than its peers, 
both as a share of total revenues and as a share of GDP18  
(Figure 3.3). The dependency on indirect taxes, -- mostly 
VAT, excise and customs revenue – limits the country ’s ca-
pabilities to expand the tax base and raises issues regard-
ing the equity of the system and how the tax burden is 
distributed among social groups.

The decline in  
tax-revenue-to-
GDP tracks with the 
decline in VAT

85. 
The decline in tax 
revenue can be traced 
to 
trade 
liberalization, 
shortcomings 
in 
recent 
tax 
reforms, numerous 
exemptions, and difficult 
tax administration.19 First, 
trade 
liberalization and a 
gradual reduction of external trade taxation have low-
ered tax revenues from international trade. This effect 
was exacerbated by measures introduced in 2012 to curb 
imports (see Chapter IV for a detailed discussion of trade 
policies). Second, tax reforms initiated in 2011 streamlined 
import taxes, unified VAT rates, and abolished some “nui-
sance” taxes to improve the transparency and efficiency 

17 
 During the period 2000 to 2013, the per capita GDP grew from USD 
869 to 3280 at 11 percent annually.

18 
 Collectively, these taxes accounted for 77 percent of the total tax 
revenue in 2013 whilst income taxes and telecommunication levy con-
tributed to 20 and three percent of tax revenues respectively.

of the tax system. However, the unification of the VAT was 
at a lower rate, and corporate and income tax rates were 
lowered without a commensurate broadening of the tax 
base. Third, the authorities have introduced numerous tax 
exemptions and holidays to boost foreign investment or 
support specific activities, resulting in an erosion of the tax 
base (see below). Finally, tax exemptions have made tax 
administration more difficult, discouraged tax compliance, 
and created demand for new exemptions.

86. A decline in VAT collection is the main driver of 
tax-revenue-to GDP reduction in recent years. The VAT ’s 
share in total revenue has declined from 43 percent in 

2004 to 25 percent in 2013, while the decline in the tax-to-
GDP ratio broadly tracks that of the decline in the VAT-to-
GDP ratio (Figure 3.4). VAT collection is weak at 2.9 percent 
of GDP in 2013 with a c-efficiency20 of 25 percent, which 
is roughly half of the c-efficiency for lower middle-income 
countries. Domestic-based consumption taxes have re-
mained at the same share over time, while there has been 
a marginal increase in import-based taxes, excise taxes, 
trade taxes, and the Nation Building Tax (NBT ), a cascading 

20 
 “C-efficiency” is the tax collection as a share of the tax base divided 
by the tax rate. See Ebrill, 2001 and Keen, 2013.

indirect tax using a similar base to the VAT, as a share of to-
tal revenue. On the other hand, the share of the corporate 
income tax collection increased, as did the “special taxes,” 
such as the Social Responsibility Levy (SRL) and devolved 
duties to Provincial Councils. 

87. 
Sri Lanka’s low tax revenues are caused primarily 
by problems with tax administration allowing for weak 
compliance. The country ranks 158th out of 189 countries 
in paying taxes due to the high number of payments (47), 
time taken (167 hours per year) and tax rate (55.6 percent 
of profits), according to Doing Business 2015 Report. A 
2013 Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability re-
port similarly identifies weaknesses in Sri Lanka’s tax ad-
ministration, particularly indicators for collection of gross 
tax in arrears, clarity and comprehensives of tax liabilities 
and effectiveness of penalties on non-compliance (Figure 
3.5). 

88. 
There are multiple institutions involved with tax 
administration. Under the MoF, there are three agencies 
involved in tax collection, including the Department of 
Customs, Department of Excise and the Inland Revenue 
Department (IRD), with the latter collecting less than 50 
percent of total government revenues.21 There is high ro-

 In 2012, the IRD collected Rs. 443,455 which was 44.9 percent of to-
tal government revenue according to the IRD’s 2012 Per formance Report.

tation of staff, which results in the downgrading of special-
ized skills in tax administration. With regard to tax policy, 
there is significant influence and overlap from agencies 
other than the tax authori-
ties (e.g. Board of Investment 
- BOI), which 
frequently 
grant tax exemptions that 
further undermine revenue 
administration capabilities. 
There is limited data sharing 
between the Customs and IRD, but not among other enti-
ties, although reforms are planned to overcome this issue. 

Tax administration 
is complex and 
inefficient

89. 
Tax administration is complex and inefficient, 
though increased use of IT expected in the near future 
may lead to improvement over the medium term. At 
present, the system relies heavily on self-reporting for di-
rect taxes and there is a lack of regulations covering pen-
alties for non–compliance with registration requirements 
for the corporate income tax. Monitoring compliance is 
split by type of tax and customer segment within the IRD. 
In November 2015 the IRD plans to launch the first phase 
of a Revenue Administration Management Information 
System, which is designed to enable information sharing, 
integrate taxpayer information from 22 government insti-
tutions, and provide for online tax filing for the first time. 
Other countries, notably Sri Lanka’s neighbor India, have 
been able to improve administration in recent years large-
ly thanks to IT improvements. Yet, global experience also 
indicates that rolling out such systems and implementing

Tax administration relies on self-reporting of 
taxes, which is onerous although there has been recent 
progress. Sri Lanka ranks 158th on ‘paying taxes’ accord-
ing to the 2015 Ease of Doing Business rankings. These 
rankings are comparable to South Asian comparators (In-

corporate tax compliance due to improvements in elec-
tronic systems for filing and paying taxes. The number 
of hours endured by firms in Sri Lanka is now lower than 
many peers, but the number of payments remains some -
what higher (Table 3.1).

91. 
Sri Lanka also provides a large number of tax 
privileges, though a tax expenditure analysis to assess 
their fiscal impact has not been carried out. Since the 
introduction of a VAT in 2002, successive changes in the 
tax regime have led to an increase from around 200 to over 
500 types of exemptions for a wide variety of goods. There 
are also over 40 broad types of exemptions on corporate 
and personal 
income tax 
depending on the source of 
income and the type of tax-
payer. In addition to these 
statutory exemptions, the 
BOI provides a package of 
additional tax incentives to 
investors. While this was partially streamlined with regard 
to income tax exemptions in 2012, the BOI can continue 
to approve incentives on customs duties, VAT and other 
border taxes. Finally, additional ad hoc tax regimes are ap-

plied to entities implementing 13 large projects thus far 
approved under the 2010 Strategic Development Act. An-
nual budgets in recent years regularly include a package 
of new tax incentives targeting specific sectors or types of 
payers. Tax expenditure analysis is not conducted before 
or after the introduction of incentives, and statements of 
tax expenditures are not compiled or published. 

92. Multiple incentives regimes have also led to co-
ordination problems, further undermining effective 
administration. Firms have been granted tax incentives 
by BOI generally are not monitored by the IRD (with the 
exception of corporate income tax since 2013) since the 
latter does not consider other tax matters related to BOI 
investors under its ambit. There has been no formal system 
of sharing information between the two agencies, which 
further complicates monitoring by IRD. Follow up to en-
sure that firms began to pay taxes after tax holidays ended 
did not occur. 

93. 
In contrast, Sri Lanka’s statutory tax rates are 
comparable to many middle -income countries, though 
features of policy concerning VAT undercut revenue 
mobilization because of the administrative burdens 
that arise. The VAT statutory tax rate is in line with other 
middle -income countries, while its individual income tax 
rates are somewhat lower and corporate income tax rates 
are relatively high by international standards ( Tables 3.2 
and 3.3). Tax policy with regard to VAT includes unusual 
features that create additional administrative burdens. 
In particular, Sri Lanka employs a “simplified VAT ” regime 
whereby significant registered exporters are entitled to 
purchase goods and services from similarly registered 
suppliers free of VAT, obviating the need for a refund. En-
forcing compliance is complicated because there is no

chain of transactions and hence IRD will not detect what 
is occurring unless businesses declare the goods and ser-
vices. The over 500 exemptions to VAT pose similar disrup-
tions and monitoring challenges for IRD. Finally, although 
thresholds for payment of VAT have been raised since last 
year, the threshold likely remains too high, given the still 
small number of VAT-payers (roughly 15,000 registered 
payers). 

B. Expenditure Pressures

94. 
Low tax revenues combined with an expenditure 
profile that is effectively non-discretionary has led to 
a lean, rigid budget. Sri Lanka’s overall revenues and ex-
penditures are among the lowest in the region. There is 
little flexibility in the short term on the expenditure side 
of the budget. Sixty percent of expenditure in 2013 was 
on items that the government cannot readily reduce: in-
terest payments, salaries, and transfer payments (Figure 
3.6). Nearly two-thirds of transfer payments are pensions 
for civil servants, which are a commitment that must be 
met, with the remainder fertilizer subsidies, social protec-
tion payments and other transfers. Furthermore, Sri Lanka 
has had a large expansion in the number of public ser-
vants in the past 10 years, growing from 646,000 in 2004 to 
1.06 million in 2013, an increase of nearly two-thirds (MoF 
2014). This growth reflects explicit policies to provide pub-
lic service jobs, especially for university graduates (see be-
low). These trends will only grow the wage/allowance and 
pension burdens.

95. 
There is moderate risk in Sri Lanka’s public debt 
profile. There has been significant accumulation of public 
debt in recent years, mostly from abroad. Although much 
improved from earlier years where the debt stock was over 
100 percent of GDP, public debt stood at 75.5 percent of 
GDP at end-2014 and could pose macro-economic risks 
if growth moderates in coming years. The composition of

grown fast in the recent years. The outstanding amount 
of Treasury guarantees given to various state and non-
state entities to expedite the development work increased 
from 1.6 percent to 5.7 percent of GDP from 2006 to 
201422, implying an annualized growth rate of 37 percent 
during this period. Moreover, within the mix that has been 
changing over time, the significance of guarantees given 
to institutions with stable revenue streams23 declined from 
90 percent in 2006 to 40 percent in 2014 while guarantees 
given to state establishments that are primarily dependent 
on state budget are on the rise24. Monitoring these guar-
antees is important to strengthen public finances as they 
could elevate fiscal risks25,26 (Figure 3.7).

 In order to facilitate guarantees for requiring entities, the ceiling im-

debt is also changing, moving from concessional lending 
to shorter-term commercial borrowings. However, during 
2014 there has been a systematic conversion of short-term 
T-bill issuance into longer-term T-bonds, while foreign 
holdings of T-bills and bonds have been contained at 12.5 
percent of the outstanding value (Central Bank, 2015). 
With about 44 percent of the public debt stock is external, 
exchange rate fluctuations and any rupee depreciation 
could risk deteriorating the debt indicators.

down, the government’s contingent liabilities have

Health expenditure, public (% of GDP) 

Source: Central Bank of Sri Lanka. Includes central and provincial government spending.

Spending levels on 
education and health 
are low relative to 
other middle income 
countries

ing the conflict have squeezed expenditure on other 
public goods, especially with regard to human capital. 
General government spending on education fell from 2.7 
to 1.8 percent of GDP be-
tween 2006 and 2013, while 
spending on health fell from 
2 to 1.4 percent of GDP over 
the same period, though 
estimates for 2014 show a 
significant rebound (Figure 
3.8A). These levels are low 
relative to other middle-in-
come countries (Figure 3.8B), particularly given the rising 
costs of healthcare associated with an aging population. 
Moreover, Sri Lanka faces increasing demands for a more 
skilled workforce to be able to compete globally while 
meeting the aspirations of the youth, as described in the 
next two chapters. 

98. 
Sri Lanka’s expenditure on social protection pro-
grams has also declined steadily in recent years. The 
total amount of transfers has increased in absolute terms 
over the past decade, but has not kept pace with GDP 
growth (Figure 3.9A). In 2013 two-thirds of social welfare 
programs went to social transfers, while the remaining 
third was spent on health and education programs, vari-
ous subsidies, and absorbed losses of SOEs (primarily the 
Railways, Postal Service and Transport Board) (Figure 3.9B). 
Moreover, growth in absolute terms has been driven by a 
significant increase in pensions and to a lesser extent, fer-
tilizer subsidies. Because Sri Lanka’s state pension system 
only encompasses public servants and the military, which 

Social transfers have 
not kept pace with 
GDP growth

mostly represent better-off households, the poverty re-
duction impact of these transfers is limited. Most notably, 
there was no increase until 
2013 in absolute expendi-
tures on the major anti-pov-
erty Samurdhi 
(“Prosperi-
ty”) program, an integrated 
welfare program providing 
cash transfers, housing assis-
tance, subsidized kerosene and assistance to pregnant and 
lactating mothers set up in 1994. Despite a small increase, 
only 0.22 percent of GDP was spent on anti-poverty and di-
saster relief programs. New cash transfer programs for the 
elderly and the disabled have been introduced but these 
amounted to only 0.03 percent of GDP in 2013. 

99. 
Low levels of public spending may undercut Sri 
Lanka’s past strong gains in human development and 
leave it less well equipped to face changing human de-
velopment needs as a MIC. For decades Sri Lanka outper-
formed other lower-income countries in making steady 
improvement on human development outcomes, such as 
life expectancy, maternal health and educational enroll-
ment (see Appendix 1.1 on achievement of the MDGs). It 
is much closer to average in outcomes when compared to 
other lower middle-income countries LMICs. Sustaining 
progress will involve addressing different types of chal-
lenges more typical of a MIC. For instance, whereas Sri Lan-
ka excelled in addressing communicable diseases in the 
past, it now faces a bigger problem with non-communica-
ble diseases reflecting an aging, more urban, and affluent 
population. Similarly, the changing economy is placing

will place further demands for more, cost-effective infra-
structure, particularly power. 

101. 
In the past, the pressures on financing capital 
investment were eased by waves of concessionary do-
nor funding that will not continue because Sri Lanka 
has reached middle-income status. Consequent to a 
deteriorating security situation and political instability, 
the international donor community substantially limited 
official development assistant (ODA) to Sri Lanka through-

Figure 3.10 Usage patterns of vehicles, 1960-2030

greater demands for a more skilled workforce, whereas Sri 
Lanka’s tertiary education has enrollment rates below the 
LMIC and South and West Asian averages (a discussion of 
tertiary educational needs is in Section IV ).

100. Sri Lanka will also need to finance infrastructure 
needs to keep pace with increasing demand. Sri Lan-
ka’s infrastructure compares favorably to its South Asian 
neighbors in terms of accessibility, and the past five years 
have seen a major expansion of public investment in infra-
structure (see Appendix 2.1 for a more detailed review on 
access and management issues for various infrastructure 
sectors). In particular, over the past five years, the govern-
ment has invested about 4.4 percent of its total expendi-
tures (outside of interest payments) in infrastructure in the 
Northern Province alone in order to redress imbalances.27 
However, Sri Lanka’s needed investment remains high 
in order to keep pace with the changes underway in the 
country. In particular, increasing urbanization will require 
more sophisticated infrastructure to maximize benefits 
from agglomeration, provide for livability, and avoid con-
gestion. With greater affluence will come increased use of 
individual vehicles, currently growing at 10 percent a year 
and set to displace the modal share of public transport 
if demand management measures and public transport 
development are not addressed (Figure 3.10). Structural 
transformation that has underpinned productivity growth

out the 1990s. Donor aid surged following the signing of a 
ceasefire between the government and LTTE in 2002 and 
again following the Indian Ocean tsunami in December 
2004. The combined effect of these was that ODA to Sri 
Lanka rose from US$330 million (2 percent of GDP) in 1999 
to $1.33 billion (5 percent of GDP) in 2005 – comprising 
the highest level of aid to the country. Despite complica-
tions in disbursing post-tsunami aid in conflict areas due 
to the lack of full government control there, social and 
connective- infrastructure needs (roads particularly) in the 
East and also in the deep South of the country were met 
by generous donor funds, easing the pressure on public 
funds. Given that Sri Lanka has achieved middle-income 
status, this level of funding is not likely to materialize go-
ing forward, highlighting the imperative for domestic rev-
enue mobilization.

102. Public investment will need to be applied ef-
fectively to crowd in other sources of financing. Pub-
lic financing will remain important, but it will need to be 
supplemented by more private sources to address infra-
structure needs. In- recent years the government increased 
expenditure on energy, water supply, transport and com-
munications from under 11 percent of total spending in 
2005 to around 20 percent 
annually from 2009-13 (or 
roughly 4 percent of GDP, ex-
cept 2009, which had a large 
fiscal deficit). Although there 
are some exceptions, infra-
structure was built thanks to 
direct public financing. As is 
discussed at greater length 
in the next chapter, effort 
should be undertaken to 
leverage public funds with private-sector investment giv-
en the quantum of investment needs going forward.

D. Inefficiency in Social Transfers

103. 
In addition to low levels of spending, Sri Lan-
ka’s social protection system has limited effectiveness. 
Some of the programs classified as social transfers should 
not be classified as such.28 Pensions account for most 
transfers, but not surprisingly given the public service 
background of pensioners, less than half of them are in the 
bottom 40 percent (HIES 2012/13). Less than 30 percent of 

28 Although the Ministry of Finance categorizes civil service pensions 
as part of welfare programs, they are part of total civil service compen-
sation rather than a welfare program and cannot be considered a social 
protection program per se. Moreover, note that the Ministry of Finance 
refers to SOE losses as part of welfare spending (World Bank, 2014a).

the population over 65 drew a pension in 2013. Expanded 
subsidies for fertilizer are available to all farmers (with dif-
ferentiation in the amount of subsidy depending on the 
crop); it can be argued in only the most general terms that 
these farmers are relatively likely to be poor.

104. Anti-poverty programs suffer from poor target-
ing. In fact, analysis of the HIES shows that if it were possi-
ble to per fectly target individuals below the poverty line, 
the amount needed to bring all poor individuals to the 
poverty line would have been only 0.12 percent of GDP in 
2013. Programs rely on manual registration and identifica-
tion, and lack a capability to actively search for excluded 
individuals. Although some programs have categorical el-
igibility criteria, more than half of Sri Lankans living below 
the poverty line receive no benefits from existing social 
assistance or social welfare programs (though they may 
benefit from free health and education). At the same time, 
a third of spending on social transfers goes to the richest 
60 percent of the population. Samurdhi and School Lunch 
programs transfer nearly the same amount to the bottom 
quintile, and in both cases roughly 55 percent of benefits 
go to the bottom 40 percent. The other three programs, 
when considered as a group, distribute 53 percent of their 
transfers to the bottom 40 percent (Figure 3.11). By tight-
ening eligibility criteria and making an effort to register 
the poor for benefits, existing spending could be more ef-
fective in combating poverty.

105. Fertilizer subsidies have limited impact on the 
poor while creating negative distortions in the agri-
culture sector that undermine productivity. Fertilizer

107. Pressures on the healthcare system and the so-
cial protection system are expected to grow with an 
aging population. The proportion of the country ’s work-
ing age population (defined as ages 15 to 59 in Sri Lan-
ka) reached its peak in 2006 and the overall population is 
expected to peak in 2016 (Figure 3.12). The child popula-
tion (up to age 14) declined from 35 percent in 1981 to 23 
percent in 2011, while the number of people aged 60 and 
above is expected to double in 2041 relative to 2011. Sri 
Lanka is in the midst of its demographic dividend at pres-
ent and hence there is urgency to “get rich before getting 
old.” While this fiscal burden may continue to be mitigated 
by the limited coverage of pension schemes to public-sec-
tor workers, Sri Lanka can expect to need to develop pro-
grams for social protection of the elderly. Furthermore, the 
40 percent increase in the number of civil servants over the 
past 10 years, discussed below, will substantially increase 
the number of pensioners under the current system (see 
Chapter VI for a detailed discussion of fiscal issues associ-
ated with an aging population).

subsidies are the least well-targeted transfer, with only 45 
percent of the benefit being devoted to the bottom 40 
percent (Figure 3.11). Furthermore, these subsidies have 
distorted market decisions by encouraging cultivation of 
certain crops, especially paddy, hindering the movement 
to other types of agriculture that have more potential for 
value addition. Even for targeted crops, these subsidies 
have not prompted productivity increases.29 At the same 
time, intensive usage of cheap fertilizers lead to environ-
mental and potential human health hazards. Thus, sub-
sidies negatively affect those in the bottom 40 percent 
engage in agriculture across multiple dimensions, sug-
gesting a need for rationalization.

106. Moreover, poverty programs are fragmented. 
There are the 11 major anti-poverty programs, including 
Samurdhi, in addition to multiple-agency programs that 
split the already small amount available for welfare pro-
grams. Programs rely on manual registration and identifi-
cation, and lack a capability to actively search for excluded 
individuals. They also employ varying eligibility require-
ments and administrative structures, and lack modern 
information management systems that would allow for 
harmonization among programs.

E. Large Public Sector

Public-service 
employment 
accounts for 13 
percent of the labor 
force, close to OECD 
levels

108. Despite its small fiscal footprint and relative 
state effectiveness,30 Sri Lanka’s public sector is large. 
With over one million employees, public-service employ-
ment exclusive of semi-public 
entities, accounts for about 
13 percent of the labor force. 
Although cross-country com-
parisons are difficult owing 
to different definitions of the 
public service, the size of the 
public sector in Sri Lanka is 
higher than comparable pub-
lic services in Thailand (rough-
ly 9 percent) and close to 
OECD levels (average of 15 percent in 2011). There have 
been also small but steady increases in semi-governmen-
tal organizations such as SOEs employment over the past 
10 years, comprising a further 239,000 employees in 2013. 

109. Human resource management of the public ser-
vice is complex with limited controls on the expansion 
of the civil service. Public servants are either recruited to 
one of 28 island, combined and other services (categories 
of employees) or are hired in terms of respective service 
minutes and individual schemes of recruitment of specific 
departments or other agencies. The complement of staff 
recruited through either route is proposed by the depart-
ment/agency and approved by the Department of Man-
agement Services (DMS) in the Ministry of Finance (MoF). 
Analysis regarding overall staffing needs is therefore ef-
fectively carried out only by the agency in question. While 
the MoF through its DMS plays an oversight role, decisions 
are made on a case-by-case basis without a holistic view of 
managing the size of the overall civil service. Politically im-
portant ministries have demonstrated ability to increase 
their staffing complement in recent years. Hiring per the 
approved cadre schedules is then carried out via the Public 
Service Commission (PSC) on the basis of examinations. 

110. There is also fragmented control of remuner-
ation. Wage reforms in 2006 led to the consolidation of 
over 100 various positions to 37 grades and corresponding 
salaries, which have been occasionally increased by the 
Ministry of Public Administration (MPA) upon recommen-
dation of the National Pay Commission appointed by the 
president. There is also an extensive system of allowances 
that, in terms of aggregate spending, have been roughly 

equivalent to the formal wage bill over the past five years. 
All public servants (and pensioners who receive 50 per-
cent of the benefit) receive a cost-of- living allowance that 
has increased from 1,000 rupees in 2006 to a commitment 
of 10,000 rupees in 2015. Outside of cost-of-living allow-
ances, there is a wide range of additional allowances and 
incentive payments that vary for different services and 
individual schemes of recruitment. The type, criteria for 
receipt,and the quantum of allowances are approved by 
the MPA’s director general of establishment. For instance, 
preliminary medical officers may receive a base monthly 
wage of 26,000 rupees per their grade, but seven addition-
al allowances account for an additional 105,000 rupees, as 
well as the right to earn more through private practice in 
the evening. Thus, the complement of staff is approved by 
the DMS, wages are set by the National Pay Commission 
and a varied system of allowances is set by the MPA’s Es-
tablishment Department.

111. Political governments have substantially in-
fluenced the size and operation of the public service. 
The government from 2005 to 2014 explicitly sought to 
increase public-sector employment, particularly with re-
cent graduates through the Yovun Diriya and other pro-
grams.31 Particularly large recruitments were carried out 
in 2005 and 2012. While recruitment is carried out by an 
objective process of examination, the higher echelons of 
public service have been subject to influence by political 
governments. Since the 1972 Constitution, all ministry sec-
retaries have been directly appointed and removed by the 
president. This has led to a small number of high-profile 
appointments of people without prior civil service expe-
rience. It has also meant that with every change of gov-
ernment, secretaries cease to hold their positions (and are 
often reassigned to another agency). Other transfers and 
promotions fall under the PSC, which, in turn, has served 
at the pleasure of the president for almost all of the past 
30 years. This framework is conducive to senior officers de-
veloping strong political affiliations.32 New constitutional 
amendments are expected to provide for more autonomy 
of the civil service through a more independent PSC. 

F. Improving Public Expenditure 
Management

112. There are additional ways to address the fiscal 
challenge through further improvements in a gener-
ally sound system of public expenditure management. 
A 2013 PEFA assessment noted relative strengths in terms 

30 
 Sri Lanka’s ranking for Government Effectiveness and Controlling 
Corruption according to World Governance Indicators has been consis-
tently higher than South Asian and LMIC averages over the past 10 years.

31 See Mahinda Chintana, also 2013 budget speech.
32 Transparency International, National Integrity Assessment, 2010.

Sri Lanka — Ending Poverty and Promoting Shared Prosperity   |   51

of budget process, quality of annual financial statements, 
legislative scrutiny, and timeliness and quality of follow up 
on audit findings. At the same time, Sri Lanka scores be-
low LMIC averages on several PEFA indicators including: (i) 
monitoring and reducing payment arrears; (ii) oversight on 
aggregate fiscal risk; (iii) public access to key fiscal infor-
mation; (iv) tax payer registration and tax collections; (v) 
internal audit and payroll controls; (vi) procurement pro-
cedures and transparency ; and (vii) predictability in the 
availability of funds. 

Budget adjustments  
are effectively carried 
out through cash 
rationing which 
leads to ad hoc 
prioritization of 
expenditures

113. Budget planning and execution practices can 
have an adverse effect on sector planning and perfor-
mance. There is limited linkage between long-term financ-
ing frameworks and sector plans, with the latter effectively 
lacking cost estimates. During annual budget preparation, 
ceilings provided by the MoF 
are often late and do not 
relate to medium-term fi-
nancial plans. In most cases, 
sector plans and strategies 
follow an activity-based ex-
penditure classification that 
is not compatible with the 
administrative and function-
al classification used for bud-
geting and financial report-
ing. These budget practices 
lead to an input-oriented culture that focuses on “spend-
ing the budget” with little reward for achieving outputs or 
outcomes. At the same time, due to chronic shortfalls in 
actual revenues, budget adjustments are effectively car-
ried out through cash rationing by the Treasury vis-à-vis 
ministries and other agencies. This leads to ad hoc prioriti-
zation of non-discretionary expenditures, such as salaries, 
to the detriment of other priority items. While Sri Lanka’s 
government has nonetheless functioned relatively well 
under these circumstances, sector per formance suffers as 
a consequence. 

114. Public investment planning is further impacted 
by capacity and procedural issues. Capacity could be 
strengthened to raise the effectiveness and efficiency of 
public investments. A key issue is the limited capacity to 
assess the planned effectiveness of investments in order 
to prioritize among various needs. Efficiency depends on 
the quality of planning and life-cycle costing prepared by 
respective sector ministries or departments. The Depart-
ment of National Planning must approve the investments, 
but it lacks engineers, quantity surveyors or other tech-
nical specialists to check assumptions and estimates. Re-
current cost requirements linked to investments are rarely 
factored into the assessment. 

52   |  III. Addressing the Fiscal Challenge

115. A weak procurement environment remains a 
concern, though reforms are imminent. Public pro-
curement expenditure in Sri Lanka is approximately 
equivalent to 21 percent of total government spending 
in 2013, making up over half of total discretionary ex-
penditures. Despite its importance, there are a number of 
institutional issues that undermine efficient procurement. 
In particular, there is no dedicated oversight and support 
agency after the abolition of the independent Nation-
al Procurement Agency in January 2008 and the transfer 
of its functions to the MoF’s Public Finance Department. 
Although the government has procurement guidelines, 
manuals and standard documents, there is inconsisten-
cy internally and in execution. There is no independent 
complaints review mechanism for public procurement. 
Finally, Sri Lanka is yet to take steps to introduce electron-
ic government procurement, which in other countries in 
the region and beyond has made public procurement 
more economic, efficient and transparent. Within this fluid 
institutional context, the government has on several oc-
casions made high-profile procurements on the basis of 
unsolicited bids, leading to allegations of cost inflation.33 
These issues are expected to be addressed through a new 
national Procurement Commission mandated by the 19th 
Constitutional Amendment, as well as through the pas-
sage of revised and consolidated financial regulations on 
procurement. 

116. Governance within public expenditure manage-
ment could be strengthened through greater transpar-
ency and accountability. There are several areas where 
more openness about the use of public money would be 
welcome, including: budget execution reports with greater 
frequency than the present bi-annual reports; information 
about contract awards and associated terms; information 
about resources availability to individual primary service 
units (e.g. schools); and presentation of audit findings. 
Providing for greater public awareness and understand-
ing of the public sector ’s use of resources would enhance 
accountability. Efforts towards this objective could include 
making budgeting and financial information more easily 
understood by non-financial specialists as well as provid-
ing public access to proceedings of parliamentary com-
mittees on public accounts and public enterprises.

33 
 In some cases forgoing competition was due to conditions of ex-
ternal financing for projects. There have been allegations of inflated cost 
to the government. See, for instance, Kumarage, Amal, “Road Building or 
Rip-Off?” Sunday Times, December 21, 2014. 

G. Medium-Term Fiscal Sustainability

117. Fiscal sustainability analysis suggests high risks 
to slower than projected growth, higher primary defi-
cits, or higher borrowing costs. Public debt, hovering 
around 106 percent of GDP in 2002, was reduced to 75.5 
percent of GDP by 2014 -- reflecting relatively low bor-
rowing costs and strong growth, supported by gradually 
improving primary balance. However, fiscal sustainability 
analysis carried out in 2014 highlighted some important 
risks. First, slower-than-projected growth (alone or com-
bined with a higher primary deficit and higher borrow-
ing costs) could stop or reverse the decline in debt ratio.34 
Moreover, the relatively high share of foreign currency-de-
nominated debt (at 42 percent of the total as of 2014) also 
creates a vulnerability to currency depreciation. Sri Lanka’s 
public debt was 614 percent of total government revenue 
and grants at end 2014, highlighting the fact that a moder-
ate increase in borrowing costs could eat up a large share 
of revenues.

118. A slowdown in growth or adverse shock may re -
verse the downward trend in public debt to GDP. The 
reduction in the public debt-to-GDP ratio has been largely 
due to fast GDP growth and low average real interest rates 
on debt in the backdrop of a relatively stable currency. If 
growth slows, a sudden fiscal adjustment might be need-
ed to contain the debt level. The low level of fiscal reve-
nue, the still high level of public debt and persistent fiscal 
deficits leave little room for counter-cyclical fiscal policy. 
Government guarantees given to state-owned and private 
establishments have risen fast from 1.6 percent to 5.7 per-
cent of GDP between 2006 and 2014, and could pose a risk 
to the fiscal position. 

119. The fiscal deficit could expand in 2015, requiring 
long-term revenue measures to ensure sustainabili-
ty going forward. The new government presented its 
budget for 2015 to the Parliament in January 2015. An 
extension to the budget presented by the previous gov-
ernment for 2015 in October 2014,35 it includes the fis-
cal costs pertaining to the promises made by the losing 
candidate who was then in power as well as those of the 
winning candidate. The result has been a change in the 
composition of expenditures toward recurrent spending 
due to: increases in public-servant salaries; new and ex-
panded subsidies, including a reduction of prices of fuel 
and essential goods through lower taxes and benefits to 

34

selected niches of the society ; and reduction of fuel excise 
taxes for 2015 and beyond. The related costs were expect-
ed to be financed by one-time taxes36 and lower public in-
vestment. However it is yet unclear whether the narrowed 
deficit target of around 5 percent of GDP set for 2015 can 
be achieved. Over the medium term, the government 
plans to massively increase expenditures on education 
and health from their present low levels. Since revenue will 
drop in 2016 once the one-time measures expire, reduc-
ing public debt to maintain fiscal sustainability and hon-
or medium-term commitments will require increasing tax 
revenue collection through permanent measures sooner 
rather than later. 

H. Priorities in Addressing the Fiscal 
Challenge

120. Continued strong commitment to fiscal sustain-
ability will require long-term domestic revenue mobi-
lization efforts. Honoring medium-term commitments 
while reducing the fiscal deficit and public debt will re -
quire increasing tax revenue collection through perma-
nent measures beyond 2015.

121. Simplify the tax regime and improving tax ad-
ministration. Sri Lanka has extremely low and declining 
revenues driven by a complex tax regime and poor tax 
administration. Low revenues and rigidity in expenditures 
is causing the country to undercut investment in human 
development just when its transition to a MIC poses new 
challenges. 

122. 
Improve the adequacy and effectiveness of 
spending. Low levels of public spending on health, ed-
ucation and social protection undercut Sri Lanka’s past 
strong gains in human development and leave it less well 
equipped to face changing human development needs 
as a MIC. Sri Lanka will also need to finance infrastructure 
needs to keep pace with urbanization, the need for cost-ef-
fective power, and other infrastructure. Beyond increasing 
fiscal space for these priority projects, there is need to im-
prove efficiency of spending, towards improved targeting 
of benefits, including those recently approved in 2015.

36 The most significant being a super gains tax (a 25 percent retroactive 
tax imposed on individuals or corporates who generated profits over LKR 
2.0 Billion in 2013/14). In addition the measures include collection of tax 
arrears (by offering credit to those who have left tax payments in arrears 
at concessional interest rates from the banking sector) and levies/taxes 
on selected entities such as the Sri Lanka Tea Board and Telecom Regula-
tory Commission.

Sri Lanka — Ending Poverty and Promoting Shared Prosperity   |   53

123. 
Improve the efficiency of spending on social 
protection and public-sector personnel management 
that undermine the effectiveness of the state. Reduc-
ing fragmentation and improving targeting of the existing 
social protection system can ensure that every dollar spent 

on social protection has a maximum impact in reducing 
poverty. Similarly, improving controls on public-sector re-
muneration and reducing political influence in civil service 
management could substantially improve the efficiency of 
public service delivery.

A. Ample Opportunities for Success 

124. Sri Lanka has a number of advantages that pro-
vide ample opportunities for further development. 
Notwithstanding ongoing challenges, the country boasts 
overall strong human capital and a reliable infrastructure 
base, particularly when compared to other South Asian 
countries. It has ended its internal armed conflict with 
signs of an emerging long-lasting settlement to address 
grievances that fed the conflict. Although it is still too early 
to judge their impact, governance reforms initiated should 
bring about more accountability and hence more respon-
sive and effective government. Coupled with a demon-
strably democratic system, this should strengthen further 
public confidence in government and hence stability. 

125. Sri Lanka enjoys an enviable location in a 
fast-growing region. Proximity to growing regional econ-
omies – at its closest point Sri Lanka is only 26 kilometers 
across the Palk Strait from India – provides major opportu-
nities. Sri Lanka currently has bilateral trade agreements 
with both India (ISFTA) and Pakistan (PSFTA), the two larg-
est economies in South Asia. It also has two regional trade 
agreements – one with the South Asian region (SAFTA) 
and the other with wider Asia (APTA), and a trade in goods 
agreement in negotiation with China. Proximity to India, 
with its estimated 250 million middle-class consumer pop-
ulation by 2016 – over 20 times Sri Lanka’s own domestic 
market – offer a large export market for Sri Lankan produc-
ers. Already in the first 14 years of the ISFTA, exports to In-
dia have grown by 1,000 percent, and the number of prod-
uct lines exported to India has grown fivefold (increasingly 
in higher value products). India has become Sri Lanka’s 
third largest export market, behind the United Kingdom 
and the United States. There are also extensive opportuni-
ties for developing trade in electricity with India.

56   |   IV.  Fostering Growth and Jobs for the Bottom 40 Percent

126. 
It is also located along a major trade route, open-
ing opportunities to serve as a regional trading hub. 
Less than 20 kilometers off its shores is the main East-West 
Indian Ocean shipping line, connecting East Asia to West 
Asia, Africa, and Europe. New investments in the country ’s 
port infrastructure – the new Colombo (South) Port exten-
sion and the Hambantota Port – have enhanced capacity 
for handling ship-based trade. The former has increased Sri 
Lanka’s container handling capacity by 50 percent, mak-
ing Colombo the 27th busiest port in the world, handling 
about one-third as many containers as Dubai and one-
sixth as many containers as Singapore in 2013 (Container-
ization International Yearbook 2013). The latter has made 
Sri Lanka an important transshipment hub for the Indian 
car market, with around 15,000 vehicles being handled 
each month. The Hambantota Port is being geared as an 
industrial port (unlike the transshipment-only port at Co-
lombo). Meanwhile, Sri Lanka’s Katunayake airport contin-
ues to be a key passenger and cargo-handling destination 
in South Asia and the national airline is a leading carrier 
of passengers into the Indian sub-continent. The success 
of the new airport at Mattala remains in doubt, but the 
facility affords an opportunity for investments in cargo/
air-freight handling and aircraft Maintenance Repair and 
Overhaul services. The close proximity of the airport to the 
seaport, together with the nearby industrial park, could 
make Hambantota a successful trading hub for South Asia 
(similar to Penang Export Hub in Malaysia), with the right 
investment promotion strategies. 

127. Sri Lanka’s boasts unique natural assets, with a 
temperate climate, diverse topography, and rich biodi-
versity. Sri Lanka has a fertile land providing for agricul-
ture, plentiful water resources and extensive stocks of fish 
in its maritime waters. Its topographical variation and lo-
cation as an island near the Asian mainland has led to rich 
biodiversity, making it one of the world’s 35 biodiversity 
‘hotspots’ (Conservation International). It boasts UNESCO’s

natural World Heritage Sites and offers the unique 
opportunity to see in one day the ‘Big Four ’ mam-
mals – leopard, bear, elephant, and whale. There is 
considerable potential for the development of na-
ture-based tourism. It has a high rate of endemism 
of flora and fauna and great genetic diversity of ag-
ricultural crops, with 3,000 varieties of rice having 
been recorded as well as a large variety of coarse 
grains, legumes, vegetables, spice crops, roots and 
tubers. It is renowned for its tea, coconut, and cin-
namon. The country has significant potential for 
the export of high-value agricultural products.

128. Natural assets together with cultural and 
historical assets provide a strong basis for tour-
ism, which is only beginning to grow since the 
end of the war. There has been a marked rise in ar-
rivals since 2010, but there is potential for a much 
bigger increase (Figure 4.1). Sri Lanka has recently 
been recognized as one of the Top 10 global tourist 
destinations by National Geographic (2011), Lonely 
Planet (2012) and the New York Times (2013). The 
country ’s tourism assets are relatively well known 
and the island has a broad appeal since it offers 
different experiences found in other destinations in the 
South and Southeast Asia region (e.g. the Maldives, India, 
Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and Vietnam). Sri Lanka has 
the advantage that all these experiences are available on 
an island roughly the size of Ireland or Costa Rica. Howev-
er, tourism investments in Sri Lanka have been targeting 
a small part of the island, with 98 percent of tourist beds 
concentrated in the South and West of the island along the

beach and in Colombo. Although some new attractions 
have been developed in the North -- such as the Ridiyag-
ama Safari Park, the Pinnawela Open Zoo, the Wet Zone 
Botanical Garden, and a number of new national parks -- 
there is scope to develop tourism in the East, North and 
Northwest of the island (Box 4.1).

129. Globally competitive companies have emerged 
in Sri Lanka, particularly in the apparel and IT sectors. 

Box 4.1 Tourism on the rise but constrained by capacity

The sector that picked up the fastest following the end of the war was tourism, with the country receiving global acclaim as a leading tourist 
nation. The unique product offering owing to the diverse attractions in a compact area gives Sri Lanka an edge over many other Asian 
destinations. New tourist hotels have been one of the most robust sectors for increased private investment after the conflict ended. Global 
chains like Shangri-La Group (Hong Kong SAR, China/Singapore), India’s upscale ITC Group, Thailand’s Minor Group and Banyan Tree, Spain’s 
RIU Hotels & Resorts, Singapore’s Aman Resorts and Mustafa Group have begun investing in the country. In addition, international brands 
such as Sheraton, Marriott, Hyatt, Movenpick and Onyx have signed management agreements with local hotel companies. Locally, several 
of the domestic conglomerates, including Jetwing, John Keells, Aitken Spence, Hemas, Citrus and Dilmah have expanded their tourism 
investments. These new additions and upgrades are increasing both the supply and quality of medium- and high-end accommodation that 
is needed for continued growth. However, the growth of the sector could be severely hampered by inadequate capacity. It is projected that 
an additional 30,000 new rooms are required across Sri Lanka to cope with growing demand. The tourism industry would need to invest in 
different segments of new accommodation to meet different tourist needs – from city hotels, large resorts, high-end boutique hotels and 
villas, as well as tented camps and rural bungalows. Alongside this, 50,000-60,000 new hospitality staff needs to be trained to support just 
the growth in room inventory. Sri Lanka currently has the capacity to train only around 1,800 new graduates each year. At the same time, the 
tourism sector requires professionals in other disciplines, such as marketing, IT and sports/recreational training. Additionally, Sri Lanka would 
need to develop new destinations across the country (particularly in under-developed locations with natural assets in the North and East), and 
diversify the product offering in order to cater to a wider variety of tourist needs, while remaining conscious of the environmental and social 
pressures brought on by rising tourist numbers.

Although initially facilitated by government 
liberalization policies in the late 1970s and 
the 1990s, respectively, these companies have 
proven resilient to changing conditions. The 
apparel industry has moved from a commod-
ity exports model to successfully targeting 
niche markets for higher-value added produc-
tion. The IT sector has also grown, with Sri Lan-
ka most recently ranked 16th as a destination 
for locating Business and Knowledge Process 
Outsourcing services in the Global Services 
Location Index in 2014,37 moving up from 
29th in 2007. Several Sri Lankan IT companies 
have attained global recognition in providing 
software solutions for stock exchanges, mo-
bile and internet payments/banking, human 
resources management, supply chain and re-
tail management, simulation games for the 
defense industry, and technology product 
design (software and hardware integrated en-
gineering).

130. For Sri Lanka to capitalize on its lo-
cation, human and physical assets, and demonstrated 
capacity to develop globally competitive firms, it will 
need to find an effective balance along two axes: (i) in-
ward vs. outward orientation of the economy; and (ii) 
the respective roles of the public and private sectors. 
The story of Sri Lanka’s economic development over the 
past 30 years has been dominated by the country ’s move-
ment along these two dimensions (Figure 4.2). In the past 
decade, policies have moved the country towards a more 
inward-looking, public sector-dominated model. This mod-
el of growth led by domestic 
consumption, and to a lesser 
extent public spending, has 
made it an outlier compared 
to other fast-growing coun-
tries in Asia, which are more 
export oriented. Given the 
fiscal pressures discussed 
in Chapter III, it will be dif-
ficult to sustain high levels 
of growth by relying on the 
public sector alone. While there is no “right” location on 
either axis, Sri Lanka’s progress going forward will likely 
involve recalibrating its economic orientation and the role 
of the public sector. 

Sri Lanka needs an 
effective balance of 
inwards vs outward 
orientation and 
between the public 
and private sectors

131. The Global Competitive Index (GCI) suggests 

that Sri Lanka is less competitive on measures that 
reflect openness and the quality of government inter-
vention. The GCI points to particular weaknesses in terms 
of property rights, favoritism in government policy, and la-
bor legislation. The Index ’s scores for most indicators (and 
all indicators in the Figure 4.3) are based on assessments 
of business executives familiar with Sri Lanka and, as such, 
provide an independent qualitative assessment of the 
strengths and weaknesses of the business environment.38 

B. Inward versus Outward 
Orientation of Economic Activity

132. Sri Lanka is smaller and less open today than it 
was for most of the last 30 years. Before 1977, Sri Lan-
ka’s development strategy, based on import substitution, 
aimed to create a comprehensive welfare state. Post-1977, 
reforms aimed to liberalize the foreign trade regime and 
Sri Lanka was seen as the first country in South Asia to 
significantly open its borders to trade and foreign direct 
investment. In the decades that followed, trade of goods 
and services increased to 89 percent of GDP in 2000, with 
tea and high-end apparel exports leading the way. After 
the beginning of the new millennium, however, trade 
steadily declined to 54 percent of GDP in 2013. FDI remains 
at below 2 percent of GDP five years after the end of armed

conflict. The decline in openness and 
stagnating FDI took place when the 
rest of the world was integrating 
more strongly and global trade was 
accelerating. Sri Lanka’s world market 
share has consequently declined to 
levels last seen in the 1980s. 

133. Overall export performance 
is mainly in unsophisticated prod-
uct 
lines, notwithstanding 
the 
success of some niche companies. 
Sri Lanka’s exports of manufactured 
goods per capita are only one-third 
and less than half of China’s or Viet-
nam’s

of the exports are for skill- and cap-
ital-intensive production with the 
rest being low-added value skills and 
resource intensive products (Figure 
4.4B). IT exports tripled between 2007 
and 2014, but still make up less than 
4 percent of total exports. Sri Lanka’s 
export per formance highlights the 
huge untapped potential in the trad-
able sector. It also implies that there 
are significant barriers holding back

nomic potential of Sri Lanka’s relatively educated labor 
force. Additionally, the export product categories have 
remained largely the same over two decades (Figure 4.5).

134. What explains the inward orientation and lack of 
diversification? This section aims to unpack the reasons 
for the relatively slow growth in exports and lack of dyna-
mism in the emergence of new economic sectors. In addi-
tion to trade and industrial policies and regulatory hurdles, 
the focus will be on the barriers to attracting FDI, the avail-
ability of skills for a competitive economy, and innovation 
policies that promote diversification. 

Trade and Industrial Policies

135. Sri Lanka’s export production basket is still a 
reflection of the outward-oriented economic policies 
adopted in the years following the two waves of lib-
eralization – first in 1977-79 and then in 1990-92. The 
government created Export Processing Zones (EPZs) – in-

dustrial parks with preferential tax treatment and specific 
regulatory conditions aimed at attracting manufacturing 
FDI. Originally adopted as a policy objective in 1978, EPZs 
took on greater prominence during the second phase of 
reform in the 1990s, with the establishment of the BOI, and 
continued to be used as a strategy to encourage FDI and 
boost manufacturing exports. The government extended 
incentives to industry to set up in EPZs, provided special 
customs facilitation, duty-free imports of intermediate in-
puts and equipment, tax exemptions and preferential tax 
rates, streamlined administration, and subsidized utilities. 
A parallel policy objective during this time was the indus-
trialization of rural communities (targeting employment 
for rural youth) and the expansion of the apparel industry 
through the implementation of the 200 Garment Factories 
Program. This was aimed at both domestic and foreign 
investors, inside and outside the EPZs. Much of the early 
investment into the EPZs was by foreign firms and con-
centrated in the garments sector, taking advantage of the 
Multi Fiber Agreement quota for garment exports to EU

markets. This then explains part of the structural transfor-
mation described in Chapter II: whereas foreign export-ori-
ented manufacturing firms accounted for only 24 percent 
of the total in 1977, they accounted for around 80 percent 
of all manufacturing exports in the 1990s. Firms with an 
agreement with the BOI accounted for half of manufactur-
ing exports by the 1990s. The establishment of manufac-
turing export firms attracted international buying groups 
with links to these foreign firms, establishing local offices 
in Sri Lanka.

There has been 
a noticeable 
slide towards 
protectionism in the 
last decade

136. While Sri Lanka’s industrial policy has been 
broadly 
market-oriented 
since 
liberalization 
in the 
1970s, the degree of outward 
orientation has wavered. The 
two rounds of economic liber-
alization introduced a series of 
reforms towards deregulating 
the economy, accompanied by 
a strong focus on export orien-
tation and FDI promotion. These reform rounds were ac-
companied by incentives to promote exports, including a 
favorable special tax regime and favorable operating envi-
ronments with easier customs facilitation and import duty 
cuts. But in the last decade (since the mid-2000s), there 
has been a noticeable slide towards protectionism and in-
dustrial policy has focused more on promoting domestic 
enterprises.39 

137. 
There has been an increase in para-tar-
iffs in the past decade. This has not only signifi-
cantly increased nominal protection and prices 
of imports, but has also added to trade policy 
complexity. The combined system of the Most Fa-
vored Nation applied tariff rate and the para-tariffs 
has made the present import regime one of the 
most complex and protectionist in the world.40 Im-
plementing para-tariffs has effectively doubled the 
protection rates to 24 percent (Figure 4.6). Worse 
still is the para-tariffs’ dispersion, which leads to 
prices that distort production and consumption 
patterns. Last, higher rates of protection on final 
products than on inputs used in their production 
lead to high effective protection rates and anti-ex-
port bias, because producers have strong incen-
tive to sell goods domestically even though their 
domestic costs are higher than their opportunity 
costs through trade. This is particularly worrying in 
the case of the agricultural sector, given that a large 
share of the bottom 40 percent of the population 
continues to be agricultural producers. Trade barriers also 
make it more difficult for local producers to access inputs, 
reducing their competitiveness and ability to integrate in 
global value chains. Firms are also less likely to invest in 
capital equipment that would raise productivity and pro-
mote technology transfers.

138. Stagnating product diversification and weak ex-
port performance has come on the back of an industri-
al policy orientation in the past decade that does not 
promote competition and aims to protect domestic in-
dustry. Although successive governments after 1977 car-
ried out ad hoc import substitution policies, these did not 
have a significant aggregate impact on trade policy. The 
decade since 2005 has seen the most extensive measures 
were adopted, where the focus noticeably tilted towards 
promotion of domestic agriculture (with generous sub-
sidies and guaranteed prices), domestic industries (with 
specific tax breaks and tariff protection), and wide-scale 
public infrastructure programs (particularly connective in-
frastructure like highways and ports). 

139. The government has been interventionist, “tilt-
ing the playing field” in many areas through a web of 
tax and trade policy incentives for a large number of 
domestic sectors and actors. As noted in Chapter II, there 
are now over 500 VAT exemptions for various industries 
and actors and 48 various types of income-tax holidays, 
many of which are quite expansive (such as “new under-
takings in less developed areas”). Many of the incentives 
appear to benefit a specific, small set of firms. For instance,

in 2012, the government announced fiscal measures to 
support import substitution industries in cement, pharma-
ceuticals, steel, fabric and milk powder. Without any wide 
scale existing local entrepreneurship in these sectors to 
take advantage of these concessions, it was apparent that 
such measures were targeted to benefit a handful of firms. 

140. FDI has also been promoted through incentives 
for specific investors provided through BOI and under 
the Strategic Development Projects (SDP) Act, giving 
government a large, direct role. The SDP Act in particu-
lar provides fast-track approvals, exemptions from a range 
of income and border taxes, and special treatment on 
land ownership. The act allows for negotiation of individ-
ual deals and the eligibility of projects are discretionary ; 
whether a project is strategic in nature can be left to inter-
pretation by the subject minister, so long as it is in a sector 
that is specified in the act. Many of the 13 SDPs that have 
been approved have been unsolicited proposals. There is 
little reporting on their terms, particularly tax benefits and 
the terms for use of land, nor is it possible to determine fis-
cal impacts by available budget data. The upshot of these 
regimes is that prospective investors have a strong incen-
tive to negotiate with government to secure privileges. 
This is particularly the case with SDPs where terms are de-
cided on a case-by-case basis; BOI incentives are uniform 
for all investors. 

141. The government has also made attempts to en-
courage greater domestic value-addition of manufac-
tured exports as well as commodity exports. This was 
done by introducing high taxes (called ‘cesses’) on exports 
in “raw form” as determined by the government. The taxes 
are primarily imposed on exports of tea, rubber, cinnamon, 
coconut and spices. Revenues from cesses are supposed 
to be then invested in R&D for the corresponding sectors 
again to encourage value addition. It is yet to be seen 
whether this has had any significant impact on boosting 
value-added exports of primary commodities. These pol-
icy measures would need to be accompanied by steps to 
increase competitiveness and innovation of firms in these 
sectors to truly be able to move up the value chain. The 
falling prices of key commodities – like natural rubber (due 
to the global expansion of synthetic rubber) – have also 
hurt the ability of traditional firms to finance industrial up-
grading in line with government policy directions.

142. 
Inward orientation and lack of diversification are 
reflected in the structural characteristics of Sri Lanka’s 
agriculture sector. Although, agriculture has contributed 
about one-third to Sri Lanka’s poverty reduction over the 
past decade (Chapter II), the sector has remained in a low 
productivity equilibrium including the plantation (tea, co-
conut, rubber) and field crops sectors. Achieving self-suffi-
ciency in rice has been a success but has also meant that 

62   |   IV.  Fostering Growth and Jobs for the Bottom 40 Percent

Sri Lanka’s agriculture production structure has remained 
concentrated in the basic and relatively low-value food 
crop. In 2013, about 66 percent of the cultivated area was 
under rice cultivation but the share of rice in the overall 
value of crop production was only about 20 percent. De-
spite growing domestic demand and potential for export 
growth, higher-valued crops, in particular fruits and veg-
etables have not expanded, while growing demand has 
been met by increased imports of, for example, dairy prod-
ucts, potatoes, onions and maize. 

143. A recent EU ban on Sri Lankan fish exports fur-
ther limits export potential in a sector that is import-
ant for the bottom 40 percent. In February 2015, the EU 
imposed a ban on fish imports from Sri Lanka over con-
cerns on Illegal, Unreported, Unregulated fishing. The EU 
is the main destination of fish exports of Sri Lanka, with 
about 42 percent of fish exports being shipped to the EU 
in 2013. The fisheries sector employs an estimated one mil-
lion citizens, contributing over 1.8 percent of GDP in 2014. 
Much of the population involved in this sector is located in 
the Northern and Eastern Provinces. Recent analysis using 
a Computable General Equilibrium model found that the 
overall effect of the ban on Sri Lankan fish could cause a 
decline in Sri Lanka’s GDP growth rate by 0.01 percentage 
points and a 3 percent increase in poverty from 6.74 to 
6.94 percent.41 Although the ban is on the fishing sector, 
unskilled workers in agriculture and other sectors are like-
ly to be the most adversely affected due to inter-sectoral 
linkages and because of increased competition with work-
ers who lose their fishing jobs.

144. Sri Lanka’s new policy makers will need to re-
view and revise the country’s trade-related policies in 
order to promote economic diversification and shared 
growth. The links between growth per formance and spe-
cific trade policies are ambiguous and depend on many 
endogenous and exogenous factors such as factor endow-
ments, geographical location, demography, etc. Each pol-
icy comes with its own set of challenges. For example, im-
port substitution laid the foundation for industrialization 
in Brazil but at some point led the economy to collapse 
under the weight of accumulated inefficiencies. Some 
East Asian countries (e.g. Japan, South Korea) caught up 
with developed economies while keeping multinational 
corporations and FDI largely out of the country whereas 
others (e.g. Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand) actively sought 
to attract foreign investors and benefited from positive 
spillovers. In the case of Sri Lanka, moving from growth fu-
eled by reconstruction and infrastructure towards growth 
based on a diversified and competitive economy will likely 
require a rethinking of the policies in place and their suit-

ability as foundations for the economy of the future.

Attracting and Retaining Efficiency-Enhancing 
Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) 

Levels of FDI have 
been disappointing

145. FDI is needed as a foundation for economic di-
versification, but Sri Lanka’s performance has been 
disappointing. In addition to boosting investment neces-
sary for growth and providing long-term balance of pay-
ments financing, FDI can help enhance the sophistication 
of Sri Lankan products and exports through introduction 
of new technologies and production processes. It can also 
give rise to positive spill-
overs through improvement 
of skills and introduction of 
new management practic-
es. Finally, FDI can enhance 
access of Sri Lankan producers to global production net-
works and facilitate the development of new activities 
within existing value chains (increasing value added in 
production). However, FDI in Sri Lanka has been lower 
than in peer countries in spite of Sri Lanka’s comparative 
advantages, such as its location and access to major mar-
kets (Figure 4.7).

146. Not all FDI has the same potential for positive 
spillovers to the economy. FDI inflows to Sri Lanka have 
been largely focused on infrastructure (inclusive of real 
estate development), with a relatively small proportion 
reaching sectors of the economy that are associated with 
global networks of production (Figure 4.7B). There are 
broadly three types of FDI: (i) natural-resource-seeking; (ii) 
market-seeking; and (iii) efficiency-seeking. When consid-
ering investment policy, it is critical to acknowledge that 
the factors that motivate, dissuade and impact investors 
are vastly different depending on the business they are 
in, and the markets they target. The basic motivations of 
an investor provide an insight into the socio-econom-
ic impacts that the firm may have in Sri Lanka. Countries 
often make the mistake of designing investment policies 
around the type of foreign investments that they already 
have, rather than tailoring policies to suit the type of in-
vestment that they want to grow. In that regard, it is im-
portant for authorities to identify those types ofinvestors 
that are more likely to make a positive contribution to the 
domestic economy. In turn, this identification should be 
consistent with the investment policy that is developed 
for the country.

Box 4.2 Global experience in attracting and retaining FDI: infrastructure and incentives are not major factors

The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency conducted a Global Investment and Political Risk survey of investors in 2013 to identify 
the main factors that inform the selection of investment destinations. Global investors seek macroeconomic and political stability in the 
host country as a foundation. Beyond that, the availability of qualified staff is the most important decision element, and one that has 
grown rapidly in relevance over the past few years. Other factors, such as the availability of infrastructure, have substantially decreased 
in importance when investors select locations. Notably, while the size of the domestic market used to be a major decision factor, it has 
become less important owing to shifting interest towards efficiency and linkages to global markets. The views of global investors offer 
insights that can be used to determine the priorities for policies and investments aimed at attracting and retaining FDI. They also highlight 
the fact that bringing FDI to Sri Lanka will require much more than investment in infrastructure and incentives to investors. Research on 
other countries has demonstrated that: (i) incentives alone can be insufficient to attract efficiency-enhancing FDI; (ii) retention of FDI is 
low as incentives pose a significant fiscal strain and investors often switch investment destinations when incentives dry up; and (iii) fixing 
enabling-environment deficiencies can be more effective than offering incentives to cover for such deficiencies.
Sri Lanka may consider other factors to attract investment, including:
• Minimizing uncertainty and fostering investor confidence through certainty on policies and regulations.
• 
Eliminating unnecessary regulatory and policy obstacles to FDI.
• 
Investing in education to ensure that the population (and especially the youth) has the skills demanded by efficiency-enhancing 
enterprises (see below). 
• 
Establishing a level playing field that fosters competition and eliminates preferential treatment for specific public or private players.
• Developing a well-functioning financial sector that can actively contribute to the development of local firms that can be part of the 
ecosystem around foreign enterprises.
Minimizing uncertainty and fostering investor confidence. Governments have a major role in building investor confidence through 
ensuring predictability and consistency in regulations that govern the activities of foreign investors, as well as protecting investor rights 
and ownership. Arguably, this confidence is particularly important in attracting efficiency-seeking investors, whose business model depend 
on productivity and reliability of production (which can be easily disrupted by regulatory changes), rather than on cheap access to natural 
resources. Recent actions including the appropriation of 37 “underutilized” assets, as well as the proposed/upcoming changes to land 
laws, significantly undermine the confidence of foreign investors on Sri Lanka, and reduce its competitiveness as a long-term investment

destination in favor of jurisdictions that can provide a higher degree of certainty to foreign investors.
Investment entry barriers include both (de jure) rule-based, legal barriers and (de facto) factual barriers that arise on the ground. Although 
most countries in the world seek to attract foreign investment, very few countries maintain an entirely open investment regime. Some 
limitations may intentionally discriminate against foreign firms, such as when a country closes a sector for security or cultural reasons, or 
protects a domestic industry. Other limitations may arise as a substitute for regulation, or because of institutional dynamics and inefficiencies. 
In addition to policy obstacles, there are procedural barriers, including documentation requirements, as well as de facto barriers such as 
lack of enforcement or excessive discretion on the part of public officials.  Research conducted on OECD countries, estimated FDI increases 
after the removal of specific restrictions (Table B1). While these figures may not necessarily reflect the situation in Sri Lanka, they highlight 
the potential of reforms in enhancing the attractiveness of a country as an investment destination. In the case of Sri Lanka, the World Bank 
has not undertaken a formal assessment of specific barriers. Such analysis would help in order to identify the current obstacles that may be 
further reducing the attractiveness of the country as an investment destination.

147. Using incentives may not be an effective tool to 
attract efficiency-enhancing FDI to Sri Lanka. Invest-
ment incentives can be used to compete for potential 
investors; to encourage certain business practices; and to 
attract investment into priority regions and priority sec-
tors. However, evidence from both survey and economet-
ric studies indicate that the key determinants affecting an 
investor ’s decision on where to locate are often based on 
broad economic and investment climate factors such as 
market size, regulatory policies, natural resource endow-
ments, infrastructure, and human capital availability (Box 
4.2).42 Investment incentives, therefore, tend to be most 
relevant at the margins of investor decision-making; they 
are likely to be most influential when investors are waver-
ing between similar options, and when a country already 
has a favorable investment climate. As Sri Lanka seeks to 
enhance the attraction and retention of FDI with positive 

42 While many countries have sought to attract FDI through offering 
incentives to investors, research has demonstrated that a) incentives 
alone can be insufficient to attract efficiency-enhancing FDI, b) retention 
of FDI is low as incentives pose a significant fiscal strain and investors of-
ten switch investment destinations when incentives dry up, and c) fixing 
enabling environment deficiencies can be more effective than offering 
incentives to cover for such deficiencies.

transformative potential, it should analyze the effective-
ness and adequacy of incentives together with the costs 
involved in fiscal losses and potential disruption of market 
dynamics (through, inter alia, the creation of an unleveled 
playing field). 

Ensuring Human Capital and Skills for 
Competitiveness

148. The challenges of competing in the global econ-
omy require not only high human capital and advanced 
skills but also a workforce that can adjust to shifts in 
domestic and global demand. Education and training 
are fundamental for a competitive economy, especially for 
the production of high-value-added goods and services.43 
International evidence shows that skills are key to improv-
ing the welfare of individuals and ensuring that the private 
sector can innovate and adjust to greater global competi-
tion, master processes that will increase productivity, and 
attract and retain FDI.

cohorts are not only more educat-
ed in general, but their educational 
attainment has increased over time. 
For example, the proportion of indi-
viduals with O-levels and A-levels is 
11 percentage points higher for 20 
to 24 year olds than for 25 to 29 year 
olds, while the proportion of those 
with degrees or more for 25 to 29 
year olds are higher (5 percent) 
compared to older age groups (4 
percent for 30 to 39 year olds and 3 
percent for 40 to 49 year-olds).

ing age population has improved. The proportion of 
those who have completed O-levels has increased from 30 
to 35 percent, with a higher increase for females than for 
males, and higher for youth than for adults (Figure 4.8). For 
example from 2002 to 2012, the number of 20 to 24 year 
olds with O-levels increased by 12 percentage points (42 
to 54 percent) while for 25 to 29 year olds it increased by

Despite the past pos-

education, as measured by annual 
national assessments of learning 
outcomes and periodic

of several higher middle-income countries, particularly in 
language and numeracy skills (Figure 4.9A).44 In particular,

cation. This is especially the case in rural and estate sectors, 
and among students from the types of schools attended 
by low-income households where educational outcomes 
are weaker.45 Furthermore, there is significant variation in 
learning outcomes among provinces (Figure 4.9B).

151. Moreover, Sri Lanka has a shortage of adequate 
vocational and technical skills in its workforce, skills 
that are increasingly in demand. Although there is an 
increasing demand for mid-level technicians, in particular 
in the services sector, and low-skilled workers in manufac-
turing, only 16 percent of workers have completed tech-
nical and vocational education and training (TVET ), and 
only 73 percent of those have acquired few, if any, job-rel-
evant skills (Figure 4.10). Just 16 percent of workers know 
how to use a computer and 24 percent have proficiency in 
English. Aptitude for these skills is lowest in the rural and 
low-skilled parts of the population. Many existing training 
programs in the TVET sector suffer from low quality and 
a lack of relevance to the skills demanded by employers. 
Importantly, the links between vocational training centers 
and industry are missing. In fact, 46 percent of employers 
indicate that job-specific skills are the most important 
factor in deciding whether to retain a high-skilled worker 

and 38 percent said the same about retaining low-skilled 
workers.

Higher education

152. When 
it 
comes 
to advanced skills and 
human capital, Sri Lan-
ka has very few high-
ly skilled workers, and 
there are constraints on 
the quality and relevance 
of higher education and 
research.46 Sri Lanka lags 
in higher education enroll-
ment compared to other 
middle-income countries 
(Figure 4.11A). Moreover, 
enrollment 
in 
tertiary 
education as a proportion of labor force averaged just 1 
percent since 1995, far below enrollment rates in other 
fast-growing economies in East Asia (Figure 4.11B). Overall 
enrollment in higher education for 20- to 24-years-olds in 
Sri Lanka is about 17 percent, whereas the average higher 
education enrollment rate for middle-income countries is 
about 30 percent.

153. The structure and composition of Sri Lanka’s 
higher education enrollment has multiple defects.47 
First, the largest share of enrollment, nearly 60 percent, is 
in external degree programs (EDPs), where students are 
enrolled in universities and sit examinations, but do not 
follow lectures or classes, and receive no academic support 
from the university. This is a low-cost option for the gov-
ernment to expand higher education access and coverage: 
but it is at the expense of quality. The greatest proportion 
of unemployed graduates is drawn from these EDPs. Sec-
ond, the balance between enrollment in the public sector 
and in the private sector is heavily skewed against the pri-
vate sector, which has only 12 percent of enrollment. This 
is due to Sri Lanka’s strongly state-centered higher educa-
tion system. A major constraint to expanding private-sec-
tor participation is the absence of a clear and transparent 
process for private higher education institutions to register 
and obtain quality and accreditation assurances. A third 
major constraint is the relatively low public investment 
that has limited the expansion of the public universities, 
especially in the sciences, technology and engineering. In 
fact, the proportion of students enrolled in science and 
engineering has actually begun to decline since 2002.48 

Indeed, the composition of students in the conventional 
degree programs of the universities is still dominated by 
disciplines such as the liberal arts, management, com-
merce and law, with underrepresentation of scientific and 
technical fields. A middle-income country, if it is to grow 
fast, needs a higher proportion of skilled and competent 
science and technical graduates. Moreover, enrollment in 
employment-oriented alternative higher education insti-
tutions in the public sector is small, at only 3 percent of 
total higher education enrollment. Finally, leadership and 
communications skills are some of the non-cognitive abil-
ities of white-collar workers that are most highly prized 
by Sri Lankan firms. Unfortunately, many soft skills are 
not learned sufficiently by Sri Lankans through the formal 
education system. To compete effectively in international 
markets Sri Lanka’s workforce will need to attain a higher 
level of computer literacy, the ability to operate the latest 
equipment, and fluency in foreign languages.49 

154. The result is that Sri Lanka’s firms have difficulty 
accessing the skills they need. In 2010, manufacturing 
companies ranked the inadequate education of the labor 
force as the third most important constraint on their op-
erations, with only Bangladesh and Afghanistan having 
higher such ratings in South Asia (Figure 4.12). Only elec-

tricity supply and tax rates were greater concerns. This is a 
problem that affects firms across all sectors. If these firms 
cannot find the skills that they need, they will not be able 
to upgrade their processes and products to compete in a 
more liberalized trade regime.

155. There is a mismatch between the level and type 
of skills taught by the education and training system

GCE A-levels, only 18 percent of the population has done 
so.51 Similarly, 70 percent of employers think that an aver-
age low-skilled worker should have passed GCE O-levels, 
but only 35 percent of low-skilled employees and 40 per-
cent of the self-employed have done so. About 60 percent 
of employers responding to a survey expected that an 
average worker in a high-skilled occupation should have 
completed technical or vocational education and training, 
and 24 percent think the same about low-skilled workers. 
Yet only 16 percent of the population has that qualification 
(Figure 4.13). Similarly, 80 percent of employers expect a 
high-skilled worker to know English and 40 percent expect 
that of less-skilled workers while 75 percent of employ-
ers think an average higher-skilled worker should have 
computer skills and 38 percent expect the same of low-
er-skilled workers. However, only 20 percent of Sri Lankans 
are fluent in English and only 15 percent can use comput-
ers. The supply and demand differences are less stark in 
workers who are formally employed; the informal sector 
lags seriously behind.

51 
 Based on the employer survey high-skilled workers are those who 
work as managers, professionals, technicians, and associate profession-
als; low-skilled workers work in clerical support, services, sales, skilled 
agriculture, forestry and fishery, crafts and related trades, plant and ma-
chine operation and assembly, and low skilled occupations.

156. When it comes to vocational training, many 
employers question the quality and relevance of ed-
ucation and training curricula. Employers believe that 
the TVET system could be critical for providing the work-
ers they need but feel that it does not convey up-to-date 
knowledge (50 percent) or produce the kinds (54 percent) 
or levels (52 percent) of skills needed (Figure 4.14A). To 
compensate for skills shortages in the labor force many 
employers train their own workers. 

157. The returns to education have been declining. 
Despite average educational attainment going up, the 
premium to additional years of education has declined 
over time (Figure 4.14B). This may be expected when over-
all average educational attainment increases without a 
commensurate increase in demand, leading to a decline 
in the premium from higher education. To demonstrate a 
mismatch between the demand for skills and the supply 
of education requires estimating returns to each type of 
skill under consideration, controlling for the increase in 
quantity of each such skill. However, to the extent that 
companies report shortages of well-trained workers, this 
decline in the returns to education is consistent with the 
view that Sri Lanka’s educational system is not providing 
the skills desired by the market. This problem is particu-
larly worrisome for the youth, who often wait for years to 
be admitted into university and then end up with degrees 
that provide relatively low returns.

Innovation Policies

158. Promoting innovation and entrepreneurship is 
essential to increase the competitiveness of Sri Lanka’s 
private sector. While many countries have sought to en-
hance innovation through direct government support in 
the form of subsidies and grants, the results and effective-
ness of such programs have been mixed at best. Enhanc-
ing innovation in Sri Lanka will likely require a long-term 
innovation policy that fosters linkages between domestic 
and foreign firms as well as between universities and R&D 
institutions and the private sector in Sri Lanka. An effective 
innovation policy will also eliminate costly barriers to im-
ports of capital goods and be in line with policies aimed at 
attracting efficiency-seeking FDI.

159. Different countries have adopted different in-
novation policies and there is no one-size-fits-all ap-
proach. Sophisticated economies such as South Korea 
and Singapore have promoted R&D-driven innovation, 
which leads to the introduction of products and processes 
that are “new to the world” (Figure 4.16). However, invest-
ment in R&D may not be efficient in absence of linkages 
between R&D institutions and networks of enterprises that 
can benefit from it. Economies that have yet to catch up 
with more productive peers often implement policies that 
seek to accelerate the absorption of existing technologies 
that are “new to the country” as a way to enhance the pro-
ductivity of existing industries (Table 4.1). Sri Lanka’s ex-

edge institutions that effectively collaborate 
with the private sector. 

161. Investment in, and quality of, R&D 
has been insufficient to facilitate effective 
modernization of agriculture. Sri Lanka 
has fallen behind in the generation of new 
knowledge and technology as well as in the 
distribution of new technologies that are crit-
ical for modern farming. The percentage of 
the agriculture budget allocated for R&D and 
extension is small compared to other Asian 
nations. The majority of the country ’s 23 re-
search institutes focus on traditional sub-sec-
tors and crops, including fisheries, rice, and 
the plantation crops (tea, rubber, coconut, 
sugar cane). Very little funding is allocated to 
higher-value crops (vegetables, fruit, dairy) 
that are critical to driving sector moderniza-
tion and exports. In fact, only a small portion 
of the value of export cesses – which are sup-
posed to be the industry ’s contributions to 
agricultural R&D (tea, rubber, coconut mainly) 
-- are given to the research institutes. These 
institutions focus on physical output of com-
modities and less explicitly on profitability of 
for its customers. At the same time, publicly 
run extension services are under-resourced 
and do not allow for effective diffusion of new 
technologies. R&D must shift towards a more 
market-driven approach as farmers diversi-
fy their farming systems by producing more 
high-value crops, livestock, and related prod-
ucts. Sri Lanka would benefit from an overall 
reorganization of its R&D and extension sys-
tem, including promoting more private-sec-
tor participation.

penditure on R&D and formal transfer of technology has 
been modest compared to other emerging markets (Fig-
ure 4.16).

160. Strengthening research and development and 
promoting collaboration between academia and the 
private sector is critical. In the past the focus of govern-
ment has largely been on income tax and VAT incentives to 
boost R&D, particularly through government institutions. 
However, two constraints quickly emerged: (i) the small 
number of suitable government research institutions ca-
pable of catering to industry needs; and (ii) the limited 
capacity in, and low-industry orientation of, government 
research facilities. Raising overall public and private R&D 
is important but should be done in the context of knowl-

162. Sri Lanka’s potential for innovation 
and scientific discovery is highlighted by 
its output of intellectual property where it lags be-
hind some particularly dynamic countries (Figure 
4.17). Countries that have moved from middle-income 
to high-income status tend to show higher levels of pat-
ent generation than nations that do not make the jump, 
and Sri Lanka is likely to need to follow the same path.52 
Sri Lanka has an intellectual property framework in place 
but it has scope for improvement.53 Beyond the legal 
and regulatory framework covering intellectual property

rights, there is also scope to strengthen financial services 
and support mechanisms to foster the commercialization 
of local inventions and improvements of technology and 
production techniques. 

C. The Relationship between the 
Public Sector and Private Sector

163. The relationship between the public sector and 
private sector has been a critical determinant of Sri 
Lanka’s development over the past few decades and 
will shape its progress going forward. Global experience 
points to the importance of private-sector-led growth 
and government regulation to facilitate such growth. In-
dustrial, trade, and tax policies carried out by successive 
governments – many of them extremely granular in nature 
-- have shaped the contours of Sri Lanka’s economy. The 
government has also had a major impact on the economy 
and jobs for the population through regulation of the pri-
vate sector in terms of market entry and transactions, land 
use, and labor practices. While all states regulate these is-
sues, particular features of Sri Lanka’s approach have led 
to specific types of constraints. Finally, the state itself is a 
major participant in the market through its large SOE sec-
tor and large public service, which in turn has impacted 
competitiveness in a number of sectors and labor market 
dynamics. These government policies have contributed to 
the emergence of a large informal sector, which further 
distorts the market and undermines productivity. Address-
ing constraints evident in the present pattern of the state’s 
interaction with the private sector – improving economic 

governance -- is a priority for sustaining growth and ex-
panding employment opportunities for the population as 
a whole and the bottom 40 percent in particular.

Public Sector Performance as a Regulator

164. The investment climate in Sri Lanka lags behind 
that of regional peers and is a significant drag on com-
petitiveness going forward. Sri Lanka has made some 
important reforms over the past years that have translated 
into improvements in some areas of investment climate. 
However, most areas of the investment climate remain 
more challenging than in other regional and LMIC com-
parators by several measures, including the Ease of Doing 
Business indicators (Figure 4.18). Going forward, sustain-
able private-sector-led growth will require the ability of 
the country to identify and eliminate unnecessary busi-
ness environment obstacles to entrepreneurship particu-
lar to Sri Lanka. This will require more intensive public-pri-
vate dialogue to involve the private sector in identification 
of the most significant obstacles to their operations as a 
way to prioritize reforms. At the same time, after reforms 
take place on paper, their full and consistent implementa-
tion across the country is essential to ensure equal oppor-
tunities for entrepreneurs in all regions. Finally, it will be 
important to assess the impact of reforms to ensure that 
they have achieved the objective expected.

Note: Higher ranking implies lower comparative performance

Land ownership 
issues are the most 
common reason cited 
by firms that do not 
register 

was among the chief constraints to business cited in the 
2011 Enterprise Surveys, and land ownership issues are 
the most common reason 
cited by informal firms that 
do not register.54 While larger 
firms – through the SDP, BOI, 
and other special regimes – 
can circumvent some of the 
difficulties in accessing land, 
SMEs encounter significant 
difficulties. In a survey of 
SMEs (2014)55, 62 percent of 
firms affirmed the complexity of land-acquisition proce-
dures, 65 percent reported that these procedures involve 
high costs, and 65 percent also reported corruption in the 
procedures. Doing Business also notes the difficulty in reg-
istering a property.

166. The state owns most land, while privately owned 
land is often subject to disputes over claims. Around 
80 percent of land is state-owned, with the state owning 
all plantation land and common lands (forests, beaches, 
etc.) and 55 percent of non-plantation cropland, mainly

Malaysia 
Vietnam 
India

Thailand 

in large irrigation areas. The 
state has consistently avoid-
ed outright sales of land. Pri-
vate ownership of agricultural 
land is restricted to 50 acres 
per person. There is much 
anecdotal evidence of a large 
number of disputes over own-
ership claims of land in both 
rural and urban areas. This is 
caused by both incomplete-
ness and inconsistencies in 
past registration systems as 
well as inheritance law, which 
mandates the partition of 
land among successors. The 
system for demarcating and 
registering tenure rights to 
land parcels 
is fragmented 
among institutions and there 
is a lack of provisions to re-
solve disputes over claims to 
land quickly and conclusive-
ly. For these reasons, the vast 
majority of civil cases in courts 
taking more than five years to resolve (and in some cas-
es stretching over decades) relate to partition and land 
disputes.56 Contestation over ownership dampens invest-
ment, reduces the efficiency of land markets and ultimate-
ly undermines productive use of land assets.

167. Tenure and use regimes of most state-owned 
land by private parties are regulated by the Land De-
velopment Ordinance (LDO). According to this ordi-
nance originating from the 1930s, the state provides the 
right to occupy and use land in perpetuity subject to re-
strictions on sale, lease and mortgaging and conditions on 
failing to use land productively. The provision of rights is 
in two stages – first “permitted” for a short period of time 
and then “granted” as a right. Although there are few cases 
of the government taking back land or denying alienation 
of tenure rights to others, the latent possibility provides 
local administrators with discretion and deflates the value 
of the land ownership rights. Under the LDO and through 
other incentives associated with fertilizer subsidies, the 
state regulates the types of crops that should be grown, 
with particular attention given to ensuring rice produc-
tion. Plantation land is handled through long-term con-
cessions to large private companies or directly managed 
by state-owned agricultural enterprises.

168. Finally, the predictability of state regulation 
with regard to property rights has been impacted by 
a few recent cases of controversial government legis-
lation. Most notable among these was an act introduced 
in late 2011 under which private-sector projects on state 
land deemed by the government to be abandoned, un-
derused or being operated outside of the scope of the 
original agreements were returned to the state. The “Re-
vival of Underper forming Enterprises and Underutilized 
Assets Act” expropriated 37 enterprises in sectors like ho-
tels, mixed-property development and sugar industries. 
While the government at the time stated this would be a 
one-off measure, the law ’s targeting of specific enterprises 
and language that provided for further takings spooked 
business confidence. Similarly, in 2013 the government 
abruptly introduced legislation to restrict foreign owner-
ship of land, including legal entities with foreign equity. 
Consultative mechanisms for private-sector inputs on spe-
cific legislation that may affect the business climate are ad 
hoc at best. 

Regulatory Environment: Licenses and Permits

169. Licenses and permits are an obstacle to a greater 
degree than in comparator countries, with significant 
differences within the country. Almost one in five com-
panies responding to an enterprise survey in 2011 identi-
fied licensing and permitting as a major obstacle to their 
operations – as compared to close to one in 10 firms with 
similar views in other countries. These investment climate 
difficulties affect firms unevenly across industries and re-
gions (Figure 4.19). While one in 10 service-sector firms 

are negatively affected, almost one in three manufactur-
ing firms are impacted. One in 100 firms in the Southern 
Province suffer from these difficulties, while they hamper 
almost six out of 10 firms in the Northern Province. The 
uneven impact of investment climate deficiencies high-
lights a potential gap between the written law and its ap-
plication, which could stem from discretionary behavior of 
some regulatory agencies. The uneven application of laws 
and regulations across regions could reinforce existing re-
gional growth imbalances and hurt employment creation 
in areas where more of the bottom 40 percent is located, 
like in the Northern Province.

Regulatory Environment: Trade Facilitation

170. Sri Lanka has seen steady improvement in its 
ranking on international trade facilitation indexes al-
though its performance is still lower than the middle 
income and East Asian peers with which it currently 
competes. Sri Lanka’s per formance on key international 
trade-facilitation indices are indicative of the strides the 
country has made in improving its trade facilitation in the 
last five years (Figure 4.20). However current challenges 
involve the stiff competition being posed by other mid-
dle-income and South East Asian countries that are vying 
for a greater share of global investments. The perceptions 
identified in international indices point to significant im-
provements that could be made to the regulatory and in-
stitutional infrastructure that currently exist in Sri Lanka.

171. Bureaucratic bottlenecks have given rise to high 
trade transaction costs. Policy-induced barriers consist-

Reform efforts (such as upgrading to 
the ASYCUDA World system) are also 
undermined by insufficient informa-
tion and communication technol-
ogy capacity among the agencies 
and failure to integrate the 30 gov-
ernment agencies involved in trade 
facilitation through a single window 
facility.

environment

172.  Trade facilitation efforts will 
benefit from 
increased coordi-
nation among all government 
agencies involved in the trade 
transaction process. In particular, 
alignment with the World Trade Or-
ganization-Trade Facilitation Agree-
ment, which will ensure a reduced 
documentation burden for business-
es, more streamlined procedures, 
application of risk-based controls, 
increased transparency of informa-
tion, regular stakeholder consulta-
tion and increased automation. Increasing coordination 
among agencies -- with a fo-
cus on streamlining, harmo-
nizing and simplifying border 
clearance, 
legislation, policy 
and procedures from a “whole 
of government” perspective 
through standard operating 
procedures, memoranda of 
understanding, and coordi-
nated decision-mak-
ing -- will improve the 
business environment. The establishment of the 
National Trade Facilitation Committee is a posi-
tive step in that regard. Moreover, clearance times 
are affected by a heavy inspection burden. There 
is no legal provision for risk management as there 
is a government decision that mandates 100 
percent examination, a legacy from the conflict 
period. Removing the regulation and applying 
risk-based controls along with implementation of 
a streamlined and automated trade transaction 
system (single window) will facilitate trade. Final-
ly, given the complexity involved in regulating im-
ports and exports, increasing transparency in the 
information provided both electronically through 
a trade portal and through regular consultations 
with trading firms would enhance accountability 
and improve information flow among stakehold-
ers, leading to better trade-facilitation per for-
mance.

ing of regulatory and institutional bottlenecks account for 
nearly 70 percent of the total time spent on exporting or 
importing goods (Figure 4.21). The preparation of docu-
ments is the most significant component, absorbing more 
than 50 percent of the time spent on import or export 
procedures. The existence of two processes for BOI com-
panies and non-BOI companies, onerous documentation 
requirements and the failure to update the outdated cus-
toms ordinance are key issues that increase the complexity 
of the regulatory framework governing trade in Sri Lanka.

Regulatory Environment: Labor Market

Labor market 
regulations slowed 
employment growth 
outside of export 
production zones

173. Labor market regulations appear to be con-
straining the growth of employment. Labor market 
regulations aim to provide job security to formal-sector 
workers but, since these workers represent only about 15 
percent of the labor force, the 
regulations instead result in a 
deep divide between formal 
and informal workers. While it 
is relatively easy to hire work-
ers in Sri Lanka, it remains 
difficult for formal firms to 
downsize during downturns. 
Sri Lanka’s Termination of Em-
ployment of Workmen Act (TEWA) requires that firms with 
15 or more employees justify layoffs and provide gener-
ous severance pay to displaced workers, with smaller firms 
being exempted. Moreover, severance payments are ex-
pensive relative to regional and middle-income peers. Al-
though formally subject to TEWA, firms in EPZs may have 
been partially exempt from TEWA due to lax enforcement 
in that sector. Empirical work57 has shown that TEWA re-
strictions retard the growth of non-EPZ firms below the 
threshold of 15 workers, only atypically productive firms 
pass the threshold, and once they do, they grow faster 
than EPZ firms, suggesting that the TEWA failed to lower 
unemployment. Instead, it slowed employment growth of 
non-EPZ firms and induced firms to seek the EPZ sector in 
order to evade the law.

174. 
In addition, the legal framework governing work 
in the private sector reduces female employment. Leg-
islation prevents women from taking up night work or 
part-time work in the growing service sector.58 This not 
only promotes exclusion of women from some economic 
sectors, such as the growing tourism industry, but it also 
reduces overall potential employment. Similarly, the laws

58 
 The Shop and Office Employees Act No. 19 of 1954 states under 
paragraph 10(2) that „a person who has attained the age of fourteen 
years and who [...] is a female, shall not be employed in or about the busi-
ness of a shop or office before 6 am or after 6pm on any day“. Exception 
included in the act include: (i) women from the age of eighteen years may 
be employed in or about the business of a hotel or restaurant for the peri-
od between 6pm and 10pm; (ii) women from the age of eighteen may be 
employed in a residential hotel before 6am or after 6pm; and (iii) women 
from the age of eighteen may be employed in or about the business of a 
shop or office for the period between 6pm and 8pm. See Shop and Office

governing maternity benefits59 make employers bear the 
entire cost, potentially deterring employers from hiring 
women.60 

Regulatory Environment: Enforcement of Contracts

175. Sri Lanka’s commercial justice system is prone 
to delays, though there have been improvements in 
recent years. The country ’s justice system suffers from a 
relatively small number of judges and corresponding high 
caseloads, and lax enforcement of civil procedure, which 
leads to frequent continuations and gaps in law that make 
resolution of land and land inheritance disputes very dif-
ficult. Recent controversies over leadership in the judicia-
ry and executive influence have further undermined the 
sector. There is a backlog of over 25,000 civil cases lasting 
more than five years (and, in some instances, more than 
30 years), the vast majority of which are land and partition 
(land inheritance) cases. Alternative dispute resolution has 
not taken root, with the exception of community level me-
diation boards. However, the introduction of a specialized 
commercial high court in Colombo to hear higher value 
commercial cases has improved adjudication in terms of 
timeliness and quality of judgments.61 

Regulatory Environment and Informality

176. 
 Regulatory compliance burdens prompt entre-
preneurs to operate informally, which in turn under-
mines competition. Moreover, the level of informality is 
much higher in some sectors (such as non-garment man-
ufacturing, where one in three firms reportedly start oper-
ations informally and stay informal for three years on aver-
age) and in some regions of the country (notably Eastern 
region where more than 60 percent of firms surveyed start 
operations informally and remained informal for almost 
seven years on average (Figure 4.22A). Informality affects 
the ability of firms to grow and enhance productivity due, 
inter alia, to limited investment, limited access to finance 
and inadequate business processes.

59 
 Maternity benefits in Sri Lanka’s private sector are governed by the 
Maternity Benefits Ordinance No. 32 of 1939 (for women employed in any 
trade) and the Shop and Office Employees Act No. 19 of 1954 (for women 
employed in shops and offices) (Abeykoon et al. 2014). In 1993, Sri Lan-
ka ratified the ILO Maternity Protection Convention (Revised) 1952 (No. 
103). However, there remain shortcomings between the national legisla-
tion and the ILO convention. One of the shortcomings is that maternity 
benefit payments are financed through employer liability.

stimulate collaboration between smaller informal firms 
and formal firms, investment in operational efficiency and 
business growth.62

178. Most business establishments in Sri Lanka are 
small, with profound implications for productivity. An 
important obstacle to improving firm-level productivity is 
the extent to which firms can take advantage of economies 
of scale. The 2014 Economic Census found that 93 percent 
of private economic establishments had fewer than 5 em-
ployees (Figure 4.23). Nearly 22 percent of those establish-
ments are in manufacturing, 
while 70 percent are in the 
service 
industry, 
including 
40 percent in wholesale and 
retail trade, and 8 percent 
in hotel and food services. 
While the link between firm 
size and productivity is not 
documented in Sri Lanka, developing-country experience 
would suggest that small firms tend to be less produc-
tive. Moreover, these micro firms are younger than large 
enterprises, with an average of 10 years since beginning 
commercial operations against an average of 20 years for 
medium and large firms. SMEs are particularly prevalent in 
regions outside the Western Province.

177. Side-by-side operations of informal and formal 
firms in a market lead to unfair practices and market 
inefficiencies. Unfair competition from informal players 
is viewed as the single most important obstacle to the 
growth and competitiveness of established firms (Figure 
4.22B). Formal firms may find themselves at a disadvan-
tage as they face higher marginal costs, such as for labor 
and taxes, than informal firms. At the same time, informal 
firms generally have no access to financial services, gov-
ernment contracts, and essential licenses and permits, 
and there is local evidence that greater formalization can

179. The proliferation of informal employment and 
small firms has important consequences for the ability 
of the bottom 40 percent to share in the growth pro-
cess. Most of the increase in non-agricultural employment 
between 2002 and 2012 was among self-employed non-
farm workers (accounting for 48 percent of the increase). 
Self-employed workers increased from 21 to 25 percent of 
non-agricultural workers between 2002 and 2012, while 
the share of informal-wage workers63 hovered above 30 
percent of the non-farm workers (Figure 4.24A). Moreover, 
the decline in agricultural employment coincided with a 
sharp increase in workers employed in establishments 
with no regular employees. By 2012, 37 percent of non-
farm workers were employed in establishments with no 
regular employees, up from 33 percent in 2006 (Figure 
4.24B).64 Similarly, by 2012, 74 percent of unskilled workers 
(those with less than a primary education) had only tem-
porary or casual wage employment, up from 70 percent 
in 2006, suggesting that these workers are increasingly 
working under precarious conditions. Wages of temporary 
workers are on average 33 percent lower than wages of 

permanent workers; one-third of that gap cannot be ex-
plained by differences in the job or individual characteris-
tics, suggesting that to some extent workers would choose 
more stable jobs if they could.65

180. Under these circumstances, a key question is 
why firms stay informal in the first place and what 
can be done to encourage formalization. A standard 
hypothesis has been that reducing the cost of operating 
a business could reduce informality, reduce uncompet-
itive practices, and, by extension, create an environment 
more conducive to investment in productivity-enhancing 
activities. However, existing evidence indicates that low-
ering the costs of formalizing on businesses would have 
only limited impact.66 In fact, it appears that most informal 
firms will not formalize unless forced to do so via increased 
enforcement, suggesting formality offers little private 
benefit to informal firms. Similarly, rigorous evaluations of 
business training programs show limited to no effects on 
actual firm outcomes and per formance.67 Even providing 
business training and grants have not yet been shown to 

63 
 Informal workers were defined as by DCS as workers in companies 
not registered, those without accounts, or those with less than 10 regular 
employees. This data is only available beginning in 2006.
64 
 Although calculations presented here exclude the Northern and 
Eastern province for comparability purposes, the share of workers in 
establishments with no regular employees was also 47 percent in 2012 
when the North and East are included.

encourage firms to formalize.68 Given this evidence, what 
policies should Sri Lanka focus on? 

Access to Finance

181. There are several compelling reasons to try and 
bring larger and more profitable informal firms into 
the formal system. First, collecting taxes from relatively 
well-off owners of informal firms would widen the tax base, 
while the revenue collected is likely to justify the costs of 
greater inspections to ensure that they do become for-
mal. Secondly, these larger and more successful informal 
firms are more likely to be the ones competing with formal 
firms for customers. Ensuring that such firms also become 
formal may cut back on unfair competition that prevents 
more efficient formal firms from growing faster. The chal-
lenge is how to encourage formalization of such firms. 
Based on the evidence described above, lowering the cost 
and complexity of registration seems a necessary, but not 
sufficient, step. Policymakers could also experiment with 
innovative approaches to encourage suppliers or custom-
ers to demand formality. One such example being tried in 
several countries is to link each tax receipt number to a lot-
tery, so that customers have an incentive to demand a tax 
receipt on each transaction. Such a system has been used 
in Taiwan, China; Korea; China; and Puerto Rico. Wan (2010) 
compares changes in tax revenues in districts in China that 
introduced this reform to those that did not, and finds the 
introduction of this tax receipt lottery increased sales tax 
revenue by 17 percent.

182. For subsistence enterprises, the existing evi-
dence seems to suggest that such firms see no bene-
fits from formalizing, and would typically contribute 
very little to taxes if they did formalize. They may still 
compete with larger firms, but in the absence of other job 
opportunities for these individuals, the government may 
prefer to leave them alone rather than have them close 
down. The only remaining public rationale for trying to 
bring them into the formal sector is that the presence of 
so many informal firms may send a message to the public 
that obeying the law is optional, and also dissuade more 
prosperous informal firms from formalizing. An alternative 
approach used in some countries is to write the law in a 
way that does not require informal firms with income be-
low a certain threshold to register, putting them in com-
pliance with the law. But unless such a threshold is set 
very high, there are still likely to be many firms above the 
threshold who choose not to register.

Larger firms have easy 
access to loans and 
lower collateralization 
requirements while 
accessing finance is 
particularly difficult 
for smaller firms and 
firms managed by 
women 

183. Despite ample liquidity in the banking sector 
and declining interest rates, access to finance contin-
ues to be a constraint reported by SMEs. Stalled growth 
in credit to the private sector 
can be tied to crowding out 
by the needs of the public 
sector – which utilizes almost 
50 percent of the domestic 
resources in the country. To 
improve the efficient alloca-
tion of resources in Sri Lanka, 
the banking sector will need 
to become more compet-
itive and efficient, and the 
non-banking financial sector 
will need to be developed 
to provide much-needed al-
ternative options to the SME 
sector. In particular, accessing finance appears to be partic-
ularly difficult for smaller firms, those operating in specific 
sectors (including garments and retail), and firms man-
aged by women. For those firms, accessing credit is often 
dependent on their ability to post collateral with a value of 
more than 200 percent of the loan amount, a substantial 
obstacle for many firms (Figure 4.25). On the other hand, 
larger firms appear to have relatively easy access to loans 
and much lower collateralization requirements. Although 
a movable collateral registry is available, it is limited in its 
operations, severely curtailing the ability of firms and en-
trepreneurs to use moveable collateral (e.g. machinery, in-
ventory, accounts receivable) as security to their loans. As

a result, despite the high penetration of regulated financial 
institutions in Sri Lanka, an estimated 64 percent of micro, 
small and medium enterprises remain without checking or 
savings accounts (World Bank, 2014e).

184. Access to finance is most impacted by weakness-
es in the financial system and the bankability of proj-
ects, while availability of funds per se is not a problem. 
Past strategies to address this challenge have relied on 
directed lending and concessional credit rather than im-
proving financial intermediation for, and bankability of, 
SMEs. Sri Lanka has had numerous programs to enhance 
access to finance targeting specific sectors (including nine 
for agriculture, 11 for SMEs, and seven for microfinance)69, 
yet SMEs continue to highlight access to finance as a ma-
jor constraint. Weaknesses in intermediation include: de-
ficiencies in Sri Lanka’s credit infrastructure (the lack of a 
movable collateral registry and an incomplete credit infor-
mation system); limited financial innovation (e.g. the lack 
of factoring, operational leasing of equipment); limited 
ability of, or incentive for, commercial banks to serve new 
markets segments (lack of cash-flow-based lending prac-
tices); and deficiencies in the legal framework governing 
lending activities (costly and long judiciary procedures for 
foreclosure, and an outdated Secured Transactions Law)70. 
The disconnect between extensive penetration of bank-
ing institutions across the island and ample liquidity with 
the difficulties that SMEs have in accessing finance points 
to a lack of competitiveness in the banking sector overall. 
Financial institutions appear to be complacent with their 
current client base and do not face market pressure to go 
after the SME segment. However, further analysis is merit-
ed to identify specific bottlenecks reducing the ability of 
creditworthy firms and economically viable projects from 
getting financing, especially among SMEs (see Appendix 
2.2. for more analysis of potential constraints).

185. Access to technology and business-develop-
ment services are additional constraints on SMEs. SMEs 
find it difficult to access technology to upgrade their busi-
nesses. A 2015 study showed that while access to finance 
was the foremost constraint (49 percent), the second 
most-cited constraint by SMEs (23 percent) was access to 
technology71. Much of the public and private technology 
transfer institutions operate primarily or exclusively in Co-
lombo and there are rigidities in accessing project-based 

funding from banks to finance investments in techno-
logical upgrading. There are also market failures in pro-
viding business development services (BDS), to support 
improvements of SMEs’ management and business prac-
tices (accounting, auditing, business planning, marketing, 
energy efficiency, etc.). While multiple public, private and 
donor-funded initiatives have begun providing BDS across 
the country, the majority of SMEs still indicate a lack of 
awareness of such services, while certain critical needs of 
SMEs (taxation advisory, market intelligence, digital tech-
nology, etc.) are not being met by existing BDS providers72. 
Rigorous evaluations focused on intensive technical assis-
tance and subsidized consulting services find positive and 
significant impacts on productivity and return on assets in 
the short run, and employment in the long run.73

The State as Market Participant

186. Beyond its role as a regulator, the state has in-
creasingly become a direct participant in Sri Lanka’s 
economy. As described in the following two sections, the 
state is an important participant through its SOE sector, 
as well as through its role as an employer. Both of these 
roles have an impact on the ability of the private sector 
to participate in the economy and have affected compet-
itiveness in a number of sectors as well as labor market 
dynamics.

187. 
In playing its role in ensuring the provision of 
public services and infrastructure, Sri Lanka’s govern-
ment has primarily used traditional procurement rath-
er than seeking partnerships with the private sector 
in the past decade. Investment in infrastructure over the 
past decade has been driven by public spending. While in 
some cases this was tied to the terms of external financing 
for infrastructure, there was a policy of directly spending 
to build assets to be owned by the state. Of course, private 
investment was not discouraged and there is cooperation 
in many sectors. Yet there are very few public-private part-
nerships (PPPs), especially for the building or operation of 
infrastructure, under which the government would seek 
to share risks and take advantage of private -sector financ-
ing know-how, and innovation. Even in instances where 
the government has recognized the need for private sec-

 For example, long judiciary processes to foreclose collateral in case 
of borrowers’ default usually leads banks to request higher collateraliza-
tion levels to cover for the additional costs associated.

Box 4.3 Defining State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs)

State-owned enterprises are a subset of what are legally defined as public enterprises.  The Parliamentary Committee on Public Enterprises 
identifies six categories of institutions that fall under its oversight: regulatory bodies, promotional agencies, state-owned enterprises, 
educational agencies, development agencies and research institutions.  There are about 240 entities that fall under the committee’s ambit, 
many of which are financed by the budget.  Regular monitoring and reporting is carried out by the MoF for 55 larger SOBEs, which have 
commercial income. For the purposes of the SCD, the 55 SOBEs are referred to as SOEs.

tor involvement and ownership, it is rare for the private 
sector to receive more than 50 percent ownership, which 
is often needed to attract quality operators wary of undue 
state inter ference. Notably, private -sector power-genera-
tion projects require partnership with the state.

Sri Lanka lacks robust 
PPP legislation and 
an institutional 
mechanism to 
manage and regulate 
PPP projects

188. To date Sri Lanka lacks robust PPP legislation, 
an institutional mechanism and capacity to plan, 
structure and implement PPP projects, and regulato-
ry structures to ensure public interests and investor 
concerns are balanced. Sri Lanka continues to lack the 
necessary technical expertise to enter into large -scale PPP 
projects in a transparent and mutually beneficial manner, 
and many 
infrastructure 
needs continue to be met by 
borrowed capital. Previous 
attempts at creating institu-
tional mechanisms for PPPs 
have been shut down. For 
instance, the National Pro-
curement Agency set up in 
2004 with the aim of elim-
inating corrupt practices 
and the wasting of time and 
resources, and improving transparency and efficiency in 
infrastructure activities did not provide a framework for 
PPPs and in any case was eventually shut down in 2008. 
Similarly, although a dedicated PPP unit in the BOI was set 
up in 2006, it did not become a robust entity. As a result, 
Sri Lanka lacks robust PPP legislation and an institutional 
mechanism to manage and regulate PPP projects. In fact, 
since 2009 publicly led investment was financed through 
commercial borrowing in the form of Sri Lanka Develop-
ment Bonds, sovereign bond issues, and other syndicated 
loans, along with bilateral loans at near-commercial rates, 
particularly from China. Much of the infrastructure com-
pleted post-war – two new ports, a new airport, roads and 
bridges island wide, two new expressways, and two new 
power plants – have been financed through these chan-
nels.

189. At the same time, the state is a major participant 
in economic activities through a substantial SOE sec-
tor. There are 55 major SOEs enterprises covering a wide 

82   |   IV.  Fostering Growth and Jobs for the Bottom 40 Percent

range of sectors (Box 4.3). The 10 most important SOEs, 
which account for about 90 percent of the asset base of all 
major SOEs, are financial institutions (Bank of Ceylon, Peo-
ple’s Bank, National Savings Bank, and Sri Lanka Insurance 
Corporation), major public utilities (Ceylon Petroleum 
Corporation, Ceylon Electricity Board, and the National 
Water Supply and Drainage Board) and logistics/trans-
port service providers (Sri Lanka Ports Authority, Airport 
and Aviation Services, and Sri Lankan Airlines). There are 
other smaller SOEs in banking, public utilities and logistics 
as well. Finally, the government has major SOEs in other 
sectors, including construction, livestock, lotteries, media, 
marketing and distribution, plantations, pharmaceuticals, 
industrial estates, mineral extraction, general trading and 
timber sales. Major SOEs accounted for nearly 17 percent 
of GDP in 2013 ( Table 4.2). 

190. SOEs play a significant role in Sri Lanka’s fiscal 
balance. Transfers from the budget to public enterpris-
es have averaged about 3 percent of total expenditures 
(around 50 billion LKR), mainly driven by direct transfers 
and on lending to the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB). The 
total debt of the 55 major SOEs accounted for approxi-
mately 4.8 percent of total public debt in 2013. This num-
ber reflects reductions in debt thanks to conversions of 
debt to government equity and capital infusions to strate -
gic State -Owned Business Enterprises (SOBEs), which have 
regularly occurred and were particularly large in 2013 
(Ministry of Finance and Treasury). 

191. Moreover, SOEs account for a significant share 
of lending. The two largest banks in the country continue 
to lend a significant share of their funds to SOEs, including 
several that are loss-making or non-revenue -generating 
enterprises. In 2013, Bank of Ceylon (the largest bank by 
asset base and lending portfolio, holding 20 percent of 
market share) lent 38 percent of its total portfolio to SOEs 
(primarily to Ceylon Petroleum Corporation, Sri Lanka 
Ports Authority and Road Development Authority); and 
People’s Bank (the second largest bank with 15.6 percent 
market share) lent 28 percent of its total portfolio to SOEs 
(with high exposure to Ceylon Electricity Board, Ceylon 
Petroleum Corporation, and Ceylon Fertilizer Company 
Ltd). Since these banks account for a large share of the

banking industry, this high SOE exposure could reduce 
funding available to the private sector and expose the 
banking sector to systemic risks given the precarious fi-
nancial positions of the concerned SOEs.

192. SOEs have a significant market share in many 
sectors, including areas where there is not a strong ap-
parent rationale for public intervention. While public 
ownership of utilities and major infrastructure can be war-
ranted to oversee natural monopolies or address free/easy 
rider problems, a significant number of major SOEs remain 
in sectors that do not obviously have these features ( Table 
4.2). This is most striking in the finance sector, where major 
SOEs make up close to half of the market. While the overall 
market shares are less significant, SOEs also are important 
in several agricultural subsectors. One rationale common-
ly provided for commercial SOEs is that state intervention 
is warranted to ensure service or provide employment to 
remote populations where the private sector is not active, 
but there is little evidence to demonstrate this necessity. 

193. The large SOE sector is largely a legacy issue. 
Most major SOEs were established in the 1960s and 1970s, 
with some -- notably the largest state bank, the Bank of 
Ceylon -- founded prior to independence. In the past 15 
years, the state has set up six new enterprises: three small 
banks, one insurance company, a trading company, and 
a new airline (which recently was merged with the other 
state -owned airline, Sri Lankan Airlines). Thus, while the 
SOE sector is large, it has not been growing substantively, 
with the partial exception of entrants in the finance sector. 
Many of the SOEs reflect earlier, more statist policies, such 
as the state plantations that were nationalized in the early 
1970s.

194. Efforts to restructure SOEs were undertaken 
during the 1990s and early 2000s and reversed after 
2005. In the mid-1990s, the government launched an ef-
fort to reform underper forming SOEs, setting up the Pub-
lic Enterprise Reform Commission (PERC) to carry out this 
work. Under the aegis of PERC, privatization took place 

Sri Lanka — Ending Poverty and Promoting Shared Prosperity   |   83

in varying degrees, affecting 86 SOEs in the electricity in-
dustry, telecoms industry, ports, agriculture, and the na-
tional airline.74 The post-2005 government had an explicit 
anti-privatization policy that in some cases led to rever-
sals of past privatizations.75 The government of the past 
nine years sought to make SOEs per form better, includ-
ing through the establishment of the Strategic Enterprise 
Management Agency (SEMA), which focused on 20 of the 
most important SOEs.

195. Following the end of the conflict in 2009, the 
military initiated business enterprises, though the 
scale of this activity is difficult to measure and its fu-
ture is unclear. Most notable among these are tourism 
and associated businesses that are widely advertised. 
The Sri Lanka Army76 now runs at least six tourist hotels 
across the country, while the Sri Lanka Air Force77 runs a 
golf course, two tourist hotels, and two banquet and con-
vention halls. It also operates a civilian passenger airline 
service, a veterinary service, and a hair salon in Colombo. 
Meanwhile, the Sri Lanka Navy78 operates a whale-watch-
ing boat service, a restaurant in Colombo, three wedding 
and convention halls, and seven tourist hotels across the 
country. In addition to tourist activities, the armed forces 
have been engaged in agricultural farming (specifically in 
lands belonging to families in the North), vegetable distri-
bution, running small shops and cafes (mainly along trans-
port routes to the North), civil construction works (mainly 
for Colombo urban upgrading projects), and conducting 
“leadership training” at military camps for university en-
trants. These initiatives were tied to the 2005-14 govern-
ment, calling into question the extent to which they will be 
continued under a new government. 

74 
 The Public Enterprise Reform Commission, established by Act No. 
1 of 1996, was mandated to improve efficiency in the economy, increase 
government revenue and motivate the private sector, but not explicitly 
to divest from and privatize SOEs. Nevertheless, divestiture did generate 
over $500 million between 1995 and 1998, attracted a further $400 mil-
lion in foreign inflows, and private investments in the gas, steel, telecoms, 
plantations and civil aviation sectors.

The system of SOE 
oversight does not 
easily provide for 
making strategic 
decisions 

196. Sri Lanka has had a diffuse arrangement for 
overseeing SOEs, complicating strategic management. 
At the highest level, the Parliamentary Committee on 
Public Enterprises oversees financial and operational per-
formance of SOEs through an annual review mechanism. 
More operational oversight responsibility for major SOEs 
has been shared between line ministries and MoF, through 
its Department of Public Enterprises. The line ministries 
have in turn appointed members of boards of directors of 
SOEs in accordance with the 
relevant legislation for gov-
ernance of a given SOE (i.e. 
the Companies Act or act 
establishing the SOE). SEMA 
and a similar Strategic Re-
source Management Com-
mittee were separately set 
up to provide managerial support, although reforms are 
mooted to bring SEMA into the MoF. None of these entities 
appear to have had oversight over enterprises launched 
by the military.79 This decentralized model complicates 
holistic oversight of SOEs’ per formance and management 
of financial risk. In particular, critical information on eco-
nomic and financial per formance, such as return to equity 
and overall contingent liabilities of SOEs, are not system-
atically tracked. SOEs have de facto considerable discre-
tion to set their own policies and strategies, including in 
sensitive personnel areas. The system also does not easily 
provide for making strategic decisions to maximize value 
to the state of SOEs or management changes such as re-
structuring. The new government has indicated a change 
of course through consolidation of oversight by establish-
ing a specialized ministry for SOEs, but its impact remains 
to be seen.

197. There is strong political involvement with SOE 
management. SOEs have requirements for the profile of 
its board directors spelled out either in their founding cct 
or more general guidelines, with a MoF representative al-
ways present. But given the direct subordination to par-
ticular ministries, practice is that a change of government 
automatically triggers the resignation of boards and the 
appointment of a new board. The political connections 
of SOEs can lead to management decisions based on 
non-commercial criteria. Most important, the closeness of 
political connections increases the likelihood of SOEs re-
ceiving preferable treatment. 

198. The size, profile, and management framework 
for SOEs can negatively impact Sri Lanka’s competi-

79 
 For instance the most recent 2013 COPE report does not cover mil-
itary enterprises. 

tiveness. The concentration of assets under management 
that is prone to politicization can lead to unproductive uti-
lization of the country ’s assets. It also likely dampens com-
petition in key sectors; even if there has been basis for the 
state’s involvement owing to the absence of market actors, 
SOEs will discourage future entrants. There is no formal 
mechanism to verify that there is a public purpose ratio-
nale for individual SOEs. In the context of the no-privatiza-
tion policy in recent years this has meant that the sector 
continues to play an outsized role. 

The Public Sector as Employer

199. Strong demand for public-sector jobs has met 
the increased supply of such jobs. As was discussed in 
Chapter II, there has been a 57 percent increase in pub-
lic-sector employment (public service and semi-public en-
tities) over the past 10 years. This has met with steady de-
mand from the population for public-sector jobs, despite 
the private-sector growth and the consequent demand for 
labor. Data on the total applicant pool for various public- 
sector jobs is not available, 
but the example of the Sri 
Lankan Administrative Ser-
vice – admittedly a highly 
prestigious service – indi-
cates the attractiveness of 
public-sector employment. 
For the period 2008-13, there 
was an average recruitment 
of 163 people per year from an average pool of over 20,000 
applicants, of which slightly more than half actually sat for 
exams. Only the engineering and scientific services experi-
ence difficulties in recruiting staff. Moreover, the vast ma-
jority of public servants stay in the service until retirement. 

There has been a 57 
percent  increase 
in public-sector 
employment over the 
past 10 years

200. While overall wage employment has declined in 
favor of self-employment, the composition of wage em-
ployment has shifted towards the public sector. Overall 
wage employment declined from 58 to 56.4 percent of the 
workforce between 2002 and 2012 in favor of self-employ-
ment. This decline in wage employment was accompanied 
by a decline in the share of private-sector wage employ-
ment throughout the decade; it fell from 77 to 74 percent 
of total wage employment between 2002 and 2012 (Figure 
4.26). In contrast, public employment increased from 23 to 
26 percent of wage employment when looking at com-
parable districts. Given the growth of the workforce, this 
seemingly small percentage increase meant an increase of 
over 95,000 non-farm public workers between 2006 and 
2012, peaking at 27 percent of total wage employment in 
2009 when large numbers of men joined the armed forces 
(Figure 4.26). Since then, public employment relative to all 
formal-wage employment has declined somewhat, but it 

continues to represent the largest share of formal workers.

201. Public-sector workers not only enjoy the benefits 
of formal employment, but they also tend to earn more 
than their private-sector counterparts. Public-sector 
workers have access to a non-contributory public pension 
system (see Chapter III), paid vacations, and importantly, 
reduced work hours relative to private-sector counter-
parts. Moreover, public sector hourly wages were on aver-
age 40 percent higher than private sector wages in 2012. 
Part of the wage gap can be explained by differences in 
individual characteristics, since public-sector workers tend 
to be more educated. However, decompositions show that 
there continues to be a wage premium for public workers 
that cannot be explained by observable inividual charac-
teristics. In fact, 14 percent of the difference in wages be -
tween public and private workers cannot be explained by 
observable differences (Figure 4.27A). The evidence sug-
gests that there is a premium to public-sector work, and 
that this premium has grown between 2006 and 2012. 

202. To the extent that public-sector employment is 
a growing share of total formal employment, this has 
repercussions for the wage premium for private-sec-
tor formal workers. Indeed, private formal wages were 
on average 35 percent higher than informal wages. 
Decompositions again show that there is a 6 percent pre-
mium to formal-sector employment, after accounting for 
differences in characteristics and the types of jobs typical

of formal and informal workers (Figure 4.27B). Together 
this lends some credence to the argument that markets 
are segmented, particularly for wage workers who would 
likely prefer formal public sector jobs but are rationed out 
or excluded. To the extent that public- sector employment 
offers better working conditions for certain types of work-
ers, the private sector will find it difficult to compete for 
the best workers.

In fact, the evidence shows that workers, partic-
ularly educated women, are queuing for public-sector 
employment. The share of new job seekers looking for 
public-sector work increased between 2006 and 2012, 
mostly on account of women. The share of women look-

lic-sector employment increased from 25 to 31 percent be-
tween 2006 and 2012 (Figure 4.28A). Most of this increase

Box 4.4 State intervention in agriculture

Sri Lanka’s government plays a particularly large role in agriculture, consistent with inward-oriented policies, inefficient land markets, and 
a large SOE sector, which, together, create distortions. 
Agricultural trade and price policies. Sri Lanka’s agricultural policies have encouraged import substitution of basic agricultural 
commodities. Border taxes on imports and exports of agricultural products and tradable agricultural inputs have to generate fiscal revenue, 
support farmers engaged in import-competing activities and tax producers of export-oriented products. Import duties,and other taxes at 
the border yield nominal protection rates for importables for most agricultural products in the order of 30–50 percent. For rice, the total 
protection rate was 34 percent in 2011, making it a highly protected crop, mainly as result of fertilizer subsidies. Maize, potatoes and milk 
are highly protected as well. Exports of tea and rubber are taxed at low rates.
The high protection of importables has created strong disincentives for crop and export diversification, providing support to expand 
production of import-competing crops (rice, maize) and discouraging the production of exportables. While agricultural export promotion 
is highlighted in various policy statements, Sri Lanka’s trade policy is overly complex and slows rather than accelerates export growth. 
Protection also results in inefficient use of public resources, and does not benefit smallholders as intended. Additional distortions are 
created by land-use restriction and policies that target subsidized fertilizers for particular sectors, such as paddy.
The distortions affect producers and consumers. Rice producers gain at the expense of consumers. Income from paddy farming is estimated 
to be 36 percent higher than what it would be without government intervention. Similarly, incomes from potato and milk production are 
significantly higher while the policy impact on incomes from tea and rubber production is insignificant. Coconut farmers, on other hand, 
experience significant income reductions due to export taxes. The aggregate effect on agricultural income in absolute terms depends 
on the levels of production of all crops and the crop mix fostered by the incentive structure. Current policies represent an implicit tax on 
consumers of about 300 percent on maize and chili, 96 percent on milk, 54 percent on potatoes and 12 percent on rice. 
Land tenure and rural land markets. Sri Lanka’s current land tenure policy, which restricts use rights and transferability, depresses 
returns to land and the absence of a functioning rural land market constrains long-run sector performance. Smallholder farmers are, in 
essence, prevented from mobilizing one of their most important assets for promoting much-need investment into an under-funded under-
invested sector. 
While government policy has aimed at equitable distribution of land, it has also fostered and perpetuated smallholder agriculture. Land 
legislation and settlement administration have successively limited farm size and constrained the rights of both owners and operators. 
Population pressure and inheritance practices have caused substantial fragmentation, leaving average farm-size well below the public-
sector-irrigation-scheme norm of one hectare. Overall, 72 percent of farms are below one hectare. In the absence of a rural land market, 
irrigation-scheme settlers wishing to exit agriculture face a choice of abandoning a valuable farm or entering the uncertain informal market 
while market-based land consolidation necessary for productivity growth remains depressed.
Functioning land markets would allow farmers to adjust size to respond to changing commodity prices and increased risks. The key to 
making this work is secure tenancy agreements and a stronger leasehold market. For public- sector land, long-term leases with provision 
for easy transfer would be a major improvement. For private-sector land, mechanisms to resolve title disputes through administrative and 
legal means as well as incentive systems are an immediate necessity. Legislation and programs to establish public- and private-sector 
institutions and professions to facilitate development of land markets are also required.

The government should seek to unlock productivity potential in rural areas, particularly given the importance of the 

sector for poverty reduction. Sri Lanka’s low productivity levels – and the lack of incentives for farmers to improve productivity – call 
for renewed attention to basic investments in technology, extension services, irrigation, and market infrastructure. They also call for 
adjustments in the broader enabling policy framework to foster diversification and productivity and improve export competitiveness. This 
will not only include investments in restoring and further upgrading the country’s productive infrastructure, facilitating market linkages, 
and introducing modern agricultural technologies but also creating a policy environment that favors the expansion of the private sector, 
especially SMEs, and allowing for more flexibility in the rural land, labor and capital markets.

Sri Lanka — Ending Poverty and Promoting Shared Prosperity   |   87

Educated women 
in particular are 
increasingly looking 
for public sector 
employment

is due to women with post-secondary training looking for 
public employment. That size of that group increased from 
42 to 52 percent of all wom-
en looking for employment 
between 2006 and 2012, 
when looking at compara-
ble samples (Figure 4.28B). 
If the Northern and Eastern 
provinces are included, this 
share increases to about 54 
percent. Indeed, many work-
ers, particularly women, are 
in fields of study that put them on a path to public-sector 
employment. Since science and mathematics pass rates 
are poor in secondary schools and there is relatively little 
access to schools offering A-level science streams, many 
are compelled to study humanities if they want to go on 
to do A-levels. As a result, the most popular career streams 
are often not the ones where there is the highest demand 
for labor. For instance, there are too many studying hu-
manities instead of subjects that would position them for 
jobs in the booming areas of tourism, finance, etc.).

Interconnectedness of Public and Private Sectors

There is no developed 
framework for 
handling conflict of 
interest

204. There is a high degree of interconnectedness 
between the state and at least segments of the private 
sector that contributes to the degree of intervention 
by the government. The variation in tax and customs 
incentives reflects government policy but those varying 
incentives also contain specific benefits for specific sec-
tors, which have a limited number of major actors. In addi-
tion, there are several high-profile cases of senior officials 
moving between public and private sectors. For instance, 
the state frequently uses 
its various 
shareholdings 
in commercial banks to ap-
point members to boards of 
directors, and in the process, 
several current government 
officials and former central 
bankers have been appoint-
ed. Meanwhile, pension funds managed by the Central 
Bank – the banking regulator – began investing in several 
financial sector firms in recent years. At the same time, ma-
jor business figures have in a few instances taken up senior 
positions in government in recent years. There is no devel-
oped framework for handling conflict of interest to police 
the boundary between public sector employment and pri-
vate sector interests. The politically appointed boards of 
SOEs also serve to reinforce networks of influential public 
and private sector players. 

88   |   IV.  Fostering Growth and Jobs for the Bottom 40 Percent

205. This interconnectedness points to political econ-
omy factors that support a continued large role for 
government in the market. Given that there are frequent 
instances of state regulatory help to a given sector, it fol-
lows that private sector entities would seek to maintain 
or expand privileges, reinforcing the level of regulatory 
intervention into the economy. At the same time, it also 
suggests that many private-sector entities would have to 
adjust considerably to succeed in a more open, competi-
tive market. Combined with broader expectation of pub-
lic-sector employment, a reduction of the state’s role or 
an attempt to “level the playing field” will encounter resis-
tance from vested interests.

D. Priorities for Fostering More 
and Better Jobs for the Bottom 40 
Percent

Promote Export-Led Growth

206. Review and revise the country’s trade-relat-
ed policies to promote economic diversification and 
shared growth. This could include reforming the pa-
ra-tariff regime to encourage more foreign trade. It also 
likely would entail revisions to the tax system, in line 
with addressing fiscal constraints, to reduce the degree 
of protectionism, particularly for targeted small sectors. 
This would include simplification of the VAT and corpo-
rate-income-tax regimes and the reduction or elimination 
of cesses on agricultural commodities. Reductions would 
need to be considered in the context of whether the incen-
tives are achieving the desired objective. Finally, a contin-
ued focus on improving the trade facilitation and logistics 
environment, including streamlining licenses and permits 
required to export, would help to promote export-led 
growth.

207. Provide for more resources and quality-enhanc-
ing management in the education sector to ensure 
that the population (and especially the youth) has the 
skills demanded by efficiency-enhancing enterprises. 
This could include steps to: ensure high-quality general 
education and development of soft skills; enable greater 
private-sector participation in higher education, improve-
ments in technical and vocational training and better co-
ordination with potential employer needs; and ensure that 
young people are inclined to pursue degrees in the indus-
tries where demand is highest.

208. Promote innovation by establishing linkages be -
tween R&D institutions and networks of entrepreneurs 

that can benefit. Development adaptation and better dis-
semination of technologies that fit Sri Lanka’s economy is 
important for productivity growth. R&D institutions need 
to be oriented towards filling this role. This may, in part, be 
helped by encouraging more private-sector involvement 
directly in R&D as well as in setting priorities for public-sec-
tor institutions. This is a particularly important issue for ag-
riculture.

Rebalance the Role of Public and Private Sectors 
to Promote Private-Sector Led Growth

209. 
Improve the regulatory environment to allow 
firms to grow, reducing informality and allowing for 
economy-wide increases in productivity and allow 
firms to reach as firms can reach economies of scale. 
Some aspects of the regulatory environment that appear 
to be significant obstacles are: upgrading the systems for 
land tenure and land use planning in both agricultural 
and rural areas; modernizing labor legislation to encour-
age easier movement of labor and female labor participa-
tion; ensuring that the burden of business licensing and 
permitting is minimal, particularly in regions where this 
is a problem, such as the North; and providing for speed-
ier resolution of commercial disputes and enforcement 
of contracts in court or using alternative dispute mecha-
nisms. Bringing larger and more profitable firms into the 
formal system and improving enforcement could help 
formalization efforts. However, the definition of priorities 

for investment-climate reforms to unleash firms’ potential 
should stem from regular dialogue between the public 
and private sectors. 

210. Review the role and participation of the public 
sector in the economy. Stronger management and stra-
tegic oversight of the SOE sector is important to ensure 
that state involvement is serving a public purpose, does 
not create unwarranted fiscal risk and public assets are 
effectively utilized. The state should also take steps to en-
sure that the public service is “fit for purpose” to carry out 
public-sector functions and not as a mechanism for job 
creation. The state can play a role that facilitates greater 
private-sector involvement through the establishment of 
a robust institutional framework for public-private part-
nerships to ensure public interests and investor concerns 
are balanced while crowding in private-sector investment 
and skills. Finally, measures to address conflict of interest 
could reduce negative impacts of the interconnectedness 
of government with specific businesses. 

211. These measures together will help provide an 
environment conducive to efficiency- and productiv-
ity-enhancing FDI, allowing for less emphasis on tar-
geted incentives. A predictable, private-sector-friendly 
regulatory environment and a skilled labor force can con-
tribute to attracting and retaining FDI. Sri Lanka’s incen-
tives regime may need to be revamped as its competitive-
ness improves and as streamlined investment policies and 
regulations are adopted and implemented.

Dimensions of Inclusion 

212. As is true with many countries, there are four di-
mensions of social inclusion that are important in Sri 
Lanka: inclusion across space, ethnicity, gender and 
youth. Constraints in each of these areas preclude the 
ability of large population groups from fully participating 
in shared prosperity. More generally, intersecting identi-
ties can produce a multiplication of disadvantage. For in-
stance, the intersection of ethnicity, gender and location 
(or youth and location) can lead to increased negative 
effects. This section seeks to define areas where lack of 
inclusiveness is evident. It must be noted that these prob-
lems can be addressed through specific interventions and 
especially by actions to provide for equal opportunity of 
participation for all segments in society, the economy and 
politics. Opportunities for participation should be promot-
ed alongside efforts to provide for effective public-sector 
management and growth through competitiveness de-
scribed in the previous two chapters. 

213. The importance of addressing exclusionary con-
straints is heightened by Sri Lanka’s recent history of 
internal conflict. Conflict negatively affected the entire 
country and specific segments of the poor and bottom 40 
percent in particular. As noted earlier, it is estimated that 
the cost of internal conflict in the period 1978-2002 was 
roughly 5 percent of GDP per annum. Not surprisingly, the 
highest levels of poverty and weakest equality of opportu-
nity are in the areas most affected by conflict, the Northern 
and Eastern Provinces. Not all ways in which exclusion has 
occurred in Sri Lanka directly fed past internal conflicts, nor 
was exclusion the only driver of conflict. However, many 
observers, including the LLRC, have noted that manifesta-
tions of exclusion played an important role in sustaining 
internal conflict in the country. Addressing the need for an 
inclusive society, economy, and polity is crucial for sustain-
ing peace and security.

A. Inclusion across Space 

Spatial Concentration of Poverty

214. The highest numbers of people living in poverty 
and the bottom 40 percent are located within the Kan-
dy-Colombo-Galle multi-city agglomeration, followed 
by the other single city agglomerations. In fact, the spa-
tial distribution of the poor and vulnerable -- in absolute 
numbers – across Sri Lanka has come to more closely mir-
ror the spatial distribution of the overall population, lead-
ing to an increase in the relative concentration of poverty 
around the country ’s main urban areas. The highest num-
bers of people living in poverty and vulnerable to poverty 
are located within the Kandy-Colombo-Galle multi-city ag-
glomeration, followed by other single city agglomerations 
(Figure 5.1). 

215. The concentration of poor in more dynamic ar-
eas of agglomeration point to the importance of cities 
in further poverty reduction. Almost 50 percent of both 
poor and vulnerable popula-
tions are within 30 km of an 
agglomeration (Figure 5.2).80 
Therefore, efforts to improve 
economic per formance 
in 
order to reduce poverty, 
such as those discussed in 
Chapter IV will directly ben-
efit these populations. A key 
challenge is how to manage

80 Poverty measurement is based on per capita consumption and the 
national poverty line. Note that the poverty line will need to be updated 
soon given that the basket of goods being used corresponds to the 2002 
basket. Similarly a more ambitious poverty line may be desired in line 
with Sri Lanka’s middle income status.

the growth of the Kandy-Colombo-Galle agglomeration, 
in particular, the Metropolitan Colombo Region, and how 
to increase other single-city agglomerations, given their 
potential and implications for economic growth, compet-
itiveness and poverty reduction. Streamlining urban man-
agement structures and improving their capacity to ensure 
they have the administrative powers to deliver functional 
urban services and conduct integrated, strategic planning 
(including land-use planning and transport planning) will 
provide local authorities with the opportunity to respond 
to both present and future needs. 

216. However, these interventions will need to be 
complemented with others targeted to assist the poor 
in more isolated regions of the country. As noted in 
Chapter II, portions of the Northern and Eastern Provinces 
stand out as regions with high concentrations of poverty 
(Figure 5.3). This is true both for monetary and non-mon-
etary measures of poverty such as education, nutrition, 
and access to services. Areas with higher poverty rates 
also tend to have a high share of the bottom 40 percent. 
In addition, two districts (Nuwara Eliya and Badulla), which 
make up a large portion of the estates, are home to 10.7 
percent of the poor population. The analysis and recom-
mendations in the preceding chapters are especially im-
portant for highly populated regions that can benefit the 
most from opening of markets and higher competitive-

ness given their proximity to markets. This chapter focuses 
on the North and East, the estate sector, and Moneragala 
district. These are areas with a long-term inclusion chal-
lenge that is different from the one confronting poor areas 
located near centers of economic activity.

Conflict Affected Areas

217. 
Poverty rates are highest in 
portions of the Northern and Eastern 
provinces, which were at the center of 
the conflict. As pointed out above, the 
highest poverty headcount ratios at the dis-
trict level are found in Mannar, Mullaitivu, 
and Kilinochchi at both the national pov-
erty line and international poverty lines of 
$1.25 a day and $2.50 a day (Table 5.1).

218. 
In these districts, poverty 
rates are highest for the youth and those 
with no education. About 47 percent of 
people living in poverty in the Eastern and 
Northern provinces are younger than 25 
– 50 percent if the more affluent districts 
of Jaffna and Vavuniya are excluded – as 
compared to only 40 percent in the other 
provinces. In particular, in Mannar, Mullai-
tivu, and Kilinochchi, poverty rates among 
the youth are especially high, reaching 28 
percent for 6 to 14 year olds and 22 percent 
for 15 to 24 year olds.81 These high mone-
tary poverty rates are correlated with mul-
tidimensional measures of welfare to the 
extent that poverty rates are disproportion-
ately high among those with no education. 
Interestingly, poverty rates are twice as high 
for those with secondary than primary ed-
ucation, suggesting that even reasonably 
well-educated workers suffer from a lack of 
job opportunities in these districts.

219. High poverty headcount rates in these regions 
are associated with weak links to the labor market. This 
is reflected in low labor force participation rates. Across 
provinces, labor force participation rates are the lowest 
for the Northern and Eastern provinces (Figure 5.4A), but 
in the absence of panel data that follows individuals over 
time it is difficult to see whether this is improving. When 
looking at the country by sub population groups, the 
Northern province stands out for its low labor force par-
ticipation among males, adults, urban residents, rural res-
idents, and those with below O-level education. Similarly, 
the Eastern province stands out as having the lowest labor 
force participation among youth and females. 

220. 
In addition to low participation, the North and 
East also have high unemployment rates, particularly 
among the youth and among educated women. Youth

Box 5.1 Female-Headed households in the northern and eastern provinces

Female heads of household are particularly vulnerable in the 
post-conflict setting of the Northern and Eastern Provinces. 
Most of these household are headed by widows (see figure). 
However female-headed households are quite heterogeneous. 
First, childcare requirements may prohibit younger widows 
with small children from generating income, while older 
female heads of households are less able to do certain types of 
manual work. Second, widows whose husbands served in the 
national army receive their husbands’ pension or 50 percent of 
his salary, while widows of men fighting in the LTTE receive a 
one-time payment only if they can produce a death certificate. 
Third, the application of family law according to different 
communities’ 
legal codes can create varying outcomes. 
Sinhalese female heads may enjoy the benefits of a more 
women-friendly Sinhalese legal code, while Muslim female 
heads may face restrictions on their activities and become 
particularly vulnerable when these prevent them from seizing 
income-earning opportunities. Finally, the loss of assets during 
the civil war can make it difficult to marry daughters as land and 
house assets are commonly used as dowry. This is particularly 
important in Tamil communities.

Box 5.2  Inclusion of ex-combatants

Persons with physical disabilities and psychological problems due to conflict, in particular ex-combatants, are particularly vulnerable to 
exclusion. An estimated 10 to 15 percent of the population in the Northern Province – a large portion of them ex-combatants -- suffers 
from a physical disability related to the conflict, In addition, epidemiological studies conducted among conflict-affected populations in 
Northern Sri Lanka show that the conflict has led to increased psychosocial problems among these populations. Although mental health 
issues are prevalent among ex-combatants, there is a lack of psychological assistance programs specifically designed for ex-combatants. 
Notwithstanding government programs to integrate former combatants, they still struggle to enter into the labor market and have relatively 
high levels of unemployment and underemployment. Social stigma -- fears of being associated with ex-combatants or perceptions that 
they are still violent -- contributes to their marginalization. In a qualitative study conducted with young female ex-LTTE fighters in the 
Eastern district of Batticaloa, Krishnan (2011) notes that job opportunities are more restrictive for female ex-combatants than their male 
counterparts, with the biggest barrier being that they are not able to use the clerical, engineering, or other non-combat skills they had 
learned. Ex-combatants face surveillance, which prompts fears that they have not been fully rehabilitated.

Canada (2015), and Krishnan (2011).

unemployment rates82 in the North and East were as high 
as 27 percent in Ampara and 25 percent in Kilinochchi 
compared to 12.5 percent in Colombo in 2012. Moreover, 
the percentage of those looking for a job for more than a 
year was highest (65 percent) in the Eastern province. Over 
90 percent of the unemployed in the Northern and East-
ern provinces were first-time job seekers, compared to 57 
percent in the Western Province. Much of the reason for 
high unemployment in these two provinces is explained 
by high female unemployment, particularly among those 
with A-level education or more. However, the probabil-
ity of being unemployed is significantly higher for wom-
en in the North and East relative to Colombo, even after 
controlling for educational and other individual charac-
teristics (Figure 5.4B). For men, no significant difference 
in the likelihood of unemployment is detected. The most 
common search method in the North and East is to regis-
ter for a government job (48 and 45 percent, respectively), 
compared to Colombo where advertisements and infor-
mal family networks are more common. This difference is 
especially large among well-educated workers. Together, 
this evidence points to very high aspirations in the North 
and East to be employed in the public sector. However, 
in the absence of panel data that follows individuals over 
time it is difficult to see whether aspirations are changing. 
To the extent that these unmet aspirations are persistent, 
they could lead to further discontent. It is also important 
to note that female-headed households and ex-combat-
ants are particularly vulnerable in a post-conflict setting 
(Boxes 5.1 and 5.2).

82 Defined as the share of unemployed individuals ages 15-24.

The Estate Sector83 

221. 
In addition to the populations in the North and 
East, estate workers have long had high poverty rates. 
Because the majority of them descended from indentured 
labor brought from India in the early 1900s and began to 
receive citizenship only in the 1980s, they lived for decades 
without state provision of social services. Large inequali-
ties continue to exist in their access to, and utilization of, 
health services. Estate workers are largely dependent on 
the estate’s management for their basic needs, particularly 
housing.84 Since nationalization in 1975, the state has re-
tained responsibility for providing education in the estate 
sector. In 1994, the Ministry of Health was requested to 
take over estate hospitals and had successfully taken over 
hospitals and maternity wards and dispensaries by 2000.85 
Housing and land on the estates are under the control of 
plantation management.

222. 
 Poverty in the estate sector fell markedly in the 
past decade. Although the estate sector has traditionally 
been the poorest in Sri Lanka, poverty rates typically have 
been only moderately higher in the estate sector than the 

83 The estate sector consists of state-owned plantations which com-
prise over 170,000 ha, most of which is devoted to tea and rubber cul-
tivation. The plantations were originally set up by British colonists who 
brought in Indian origin Tamils as laborers. Housing and land on the 
estates remains under the control of plantation management while the 
state took over provision of social services and public infrastructure in 
the mid-2000s. The particular social and economic features of the estates 
have led to it being treated as a separate category from the rural and 
urban sectors.

rural sector. In 2002, headcount poverty was estimated 
to be 30 percent in the estate sector, as compared to 25 
percent in rural areas (Figure 5.5). A gap between the rural 
and estate sectors emerged in 2006/07, after poverty fell 
rapidly in rural areas but changed little in the estate sector. 
By 2009/10, however, the estate sector had largely caught 
up to the rural sector, and by 2012/13 the estimated head-
count poverty rate in the estate sector was 10.9 percent, 
compared with 6.8 and 1.8 percent in rural and urban ar-
eas, respectively (Figure 5.5). In fact, most of the decrease 
in estate poverty during the period of 2002-2012/13 oc-
curred between 2006 and 2009 (from 28 to 11 percent). 

The large reduction in estate poverty is corroborated by 
other welfare indicators, such as the multidimensional 
welfare index reported by United Nations Development 
Programme (2012), which show a decline in multidimen-
sional poverty from 21.1 percent to 11.4 percent between 
2006 and 2009. 

223. One potential explanation for this sharp decline 
in estate sector poverty is the substantial increase in 
the price of tea, which is the major output of the estate 
sector as well as Sri Lanka’s largest exported commodity 
by export value. The Colombo auction price for tea surged

while the quantity of total tea exports remained stable. 
This resulted in much higher profit margins and revenue 
for the tea industry, as reflected by higher ratio of auction 
price and production cost (Figure 5.6), along with higher 
wages for estate workers. 

224. 
In fact, wage increases were larger in the estate 
sector when compared to the agricultural sector as a 
whole (Figure 5.7A). This may be partly because estate 
workers had negotiated minimum wage increases be-
tween 2009 and 2010. When controlling for individual char-
acteristics, the premium for being an estate-sector worker 
relative to an urban worker has significantly increased over 
time (Figure 5.7B). Although real wages in the rural sector 
have been statistically the same as what an observational-
ly equivalent worker would earn in the urban sector, they 
were significantly higher than real earnings in the estate 
sectors in 2009 and 2010. This highlights a large increase 
in profitability during that time period for own-account 
farmers compared to estate worker earnings, despite the 
increase in minimum wages. However, rural-sector worker 
premiums have since fallen, in line with commodity prices. 

225. Despite recent improvements, poverty rates 
continue to be higher in the estates when compared to 
both urban and rural sec-
tors, pointing to continued 
vulnerability. As shown in 
Chapter II, the poverty head-
count is 10.9 percent in the 
estates, compared to 7.6 per-
cent in the rural sector and 
2.1 percent in the urban sec-
tor poverty (Figure 5.8). At

the $2.50 poverty line, the poverty headcount is 50.6 per-
cent in the estates compared to 34.3 percent in rural and 
17.7 percent in urban areas. In fact, about 40 percent of 
the population in the estate sector still lives between the 
national poverty line and $2.50 a day (2005 PPP). This indi-
cates that a large share of the estate sector population is 
nearly poor and is vulnerable to adverse shocks. Moreover, 
the poverty gap index, measuring how far people are from 
the poverty line, is also considerably higher in the estates, 
at 13.4 percent compared to 8.9 percent in rural areas at 
the $2.50 poverty line (Figure 5.8). Moreover, 62.7 percent 
of the population in the estate sector is in the bottom 40 
percent of the distribution, compared to 42.5 percent for 
rural and 23.3 percent for urban populations.

226. 
 Non-monetary indicators of poverty, health and 
nutrition are worrisome, especially in the estates. Is-
land-wide 21 percent of children under 5 are underweight, 
16 percent of babies born have low birth weight and 16 
percent of women of reproductive age (15-49) are mal-
nourished. Estates have the highest maternal mortality 
rates in the country, and both estate women and children 
suffer from severe malnutrition. About 30 percent of chil-
dren below 5 are underweight, nearly one in three babies 
born have low birth weight, and one-third of women of re-
productive age are malnourished (Figure 5.9). A significant 
reason for child and maternal malnutrition in the estate 
sector was intake of the “wrong” kind of foods, specifical-
ly those lacking in protein.86 The fact that estate women 
traditionally eat whatever remains after men and children 
have been fed is considered a contributing factor to wom-
en’s malnourishment.87 Being undernourished and over-
worked, mothers in the estates give birth to weak children 
and have inadequate breast milk, both of which contribute 
to high levels of infant mortality.

227. Housing provided for the estate workers is of-
ten described as inadequate. Estate-sector households 
are less likely to have drinking water, sanitary facilities or 
electricity within their households. The differences are par-
ticularly large for availability of drinking water; only 68.1 
percent of households in the estates have drinking water 
available inside their premises, compared to 77.3 percent 
of households in rural areas (Figure 5.10). Similarly, less 
than one-third of estate households have a toilet available 
in their unit, compared to 43.2 percent of households in 
rural areas. Philips (2005) argues that the lack of toilets and 
running water implies that mothers and daughters need 
to wake up early in the morning and go to bushes for bath-
ing and other needs, exposing them to all kinds of threats. 
Often, entire families live in so-called line rooms – bar-
rack- type single rooms that are roughly 12 by 10 feet and 
described as crowded, damp, smoky and dark with leak-
ing roofs and inadequate light and ventilation.88 Housing, 
education, health care and childcare are often provided as 
non-monetary “welfare packages” to estate workers. It is 
argued these create a total dependency of workers on the 
management for all aspects of their lives.89 

228. Moreover, access to services and the quality of 
services in the estates is comparatively low. Travel times 
generally mean that estate workers are isolated in terms 
of access to health and education. Estate workers need

to travel longer to reach a bus stop, secondary education 
and the nearest hospital (Figure 5.11). Most schools in the 
estates are primary schools and upon completion of pri-
mary education, students have to travel to nearby villag-
es to continue with secondary education. Poor roads and 
lack of transport facilities may contribute to the low en-
rollment rates at the secondary schools among the estate

national standards; hospitals in the estate sector are less 
well equipped and there are fewer trained health staff and 
medicine.91 Poor quality of health services pushes estate 
workers to obtain private health services at higher prices.92 
Estate hospitals were taken over by the government in 
2007, but it has been difficult to send doctors to staff those 
hospitals due to their remote locations. Estate schools 
are also run by the public sector, and, again, allocation 
of teachers (especially Tamil-speaking teachers) has been 
difficult. Successive governments have changed teacher 
recruitment policies (including school-based recruitments 
rather than national level recruitments) to improve the sit-
uation.

229. Poor outcomes in education impede the ability 
of the estate population to participate in Sri Lankan 
society. Across sectors, the greatest improvement in ed-
ucation attainment is seen in the estate sector, but it still 
remains low compared to other sectors.93 For instance, the 
proportion of those who have completed primary level ed-
ucation improved from 82 percent to 86 percent in Sri Lan-

ka as a whole, with the corresponding improvement in the 
estate sector from 53 percent to 63 percent. The propor-
tion of those who have completed O-levels improved from 
7 percent to 9 percent in the estate sector. However, the 
proportion of the estate-sector working-age population 
with at least A-levels remains low at 3 percent, although 
improved from 1 percent in 2003. The estates not only 
have low levels of education for adults relative to the rest 
of the country (Figure 5.12A), but more importantly, they 
have lower enrollment rates, particularly among 15 to 20 
year olds, of which only 49 percent are enrolled compared 
to 66 percent in rural areas (Figure 5.12B). 

230. The youth are 
in-
creasing leaving the estate 
sector. Between 2003 and 
2012, the share of popula-
tion in the estate sector in-
creased from about 660,000 
to about 682,000, an aver-
age growth of 0.4 percent a 
year, compared to an aver-
age growth of 1.3 percent 
per year for the country as a 
whole. However, the number 
of youth ages 15 to 24 actually declined (Figure 5.12B), par-
ticularly among those aged 15-20. In contrast, the share of 
adults aged 60 and above increased by 8 percent a year

on average. This shift in the population structure also coin-
cided with a movement away from agriculture wage work 
among those who live in the estates, while the share of 
workers engaged in non-agricultural activities – primarily 
manufacturing, transport, commerce and community ser-
vices – increased from 24 to 30 percent between 2006 and 
2010, but then declined somewhat in 2012 (Figure 5.13).

231. 
 The educated estate youth face difficulties in 
accessing salaried employment outside the estate 
sector. While opportunities for estate youth to work in 
service-sector industries, such as retail stores and com-
munication centers, are expanding in nearby villages, the 
opportunities to work in professional, salaried occupations 
are not easily available to the estate youth. Despite their 
preference to work in such occupations, estate youth has 
to compete with better educated and socialized peers 
from the rural and urban sectors who are preferred by em-
ployers.94 Due to this situation many estate youth take on 
lower-level job openings, such as domestic workers, shop 
assistants or construction workers, and relatively few are 
able to secure jobs as semi-skilled workers, such as drivers 
or mechanics. According to a qualitative study conduct-
ed by Gunetilleke et al. (2008), most of the estate youth 
reported facing stigmatization and discrimination due 
to their Indian Tamil ethnicity and estate worker identity, 
both of which constitute a barrier in accessing non-estate 
job opportunities. While youth unemployment is low and 
declining relative to the rest of the country (Figure 5.14),

the share of estate youth who are out of the labor force 
has increased by over 40 percent, compared to an 18 per-
cent growth in rural areas. Although this may be correlated 
with a higher share of youth being enrolled in school, it 
also suggests “voluntary” inactivity due to the mismatch of 
job opportunities and aspirations.

 Women in the estates face additional layers 
of exclusion. Women tend to be employed for the low-
est-paying unskilled tasks that require intense labor such 

 
 
 
Box 5.3 Gender-based violence: one of the most extreme forms of exclusion

GBV is one of the most extreme interferences with women’s dignity, and it impacts their opportunities to participate in 

society. The forms of violence faced by the women in Sri Lanka range from rape and domestic violence to sexual harassment in public 
transportation. All these prevent women’s access to health, education and employment opportunities. Legal consequences for rapists are rare 
and, in a UN-led survey, only 34 percent of those who admitted rape felt worried or guilty about their actions, suggesting that social norms are 
permissive of this extreme form of violence against women. 

Several studies argue that violence against women has increased due to conflict and disaster. The presence of military forces, 

the setting of displacement camps, the loss of male household members to war and alcohol abuse caused by war-related trauma increase 
insecurity for women. The tsunami additionally contributed to this environment of insecurity for women, who became victims of sexual and 
domestic violence both in the immediate aftermath of the disaster and during the post-tsunami rehabilitation and reconstruction process. 
Finally, due to instability caused by the conflict and natural disaster, girls were rushed into child marriages to tsunami widowers who sought 
government subsidies for marrying and starting a family, creating vulnerability. 

Gender-based violence is linked to cultural norms and attitudes about masculinity. In a survey conducted in Colombo, Hambantota, 

Nuwara Eliya and Batticaloa districts, de Mel et al (2013) argue that male perpetration of gender-based violence is linked to cultural attitudes 
about how to be a man. The study found that majority of men as well as women linked manhood to dominance, toughness and violence. Men 
who reported committing sexual violence often were motivated by sexual entitlement – as men they perceive themselves as having right to 
have sexual relations with women. Fifty five percent of men in the sample agreed that in case of rape one would have to question whether 
the victim is promiscuous or has a bad reputation. Regarding intimate partner violence (IPV), 41 percent of male respondents agreed with 
the statement that a woman should tolerate violence in order to keep the family together. Around 78 percent of men affirmed the view that 
women should obey their husbands, while 58 percent of men stated that women could not refuse their husbands. Women also contribute to 
the persistence of inequitable gender norms: 58 percent of women (a higher percentage than men) believed that a woman should tolerate 
IPV in order to keep the family together. Moreover, 75 percent of women agreed that, “some women ask to be raped by the way they dress 
and behave.”. According to the study, male attitudes on reproductive issues, equal wages, children’s education, women associations and 
entry into politics were more equitable. Seventy percent of men agreed that women should be in public decision-making roles and 62 
percent supported the greater participation of women at the elections. Lastly, the study emphasized particular vulnerabilities that men face 
throughout their lives, which increases their risk of perpetration of violence against women. Economic pressures resulting from inadequate 
income, lack of economic assets, and financial responsibilities as breadwinners are found to be among the primary causes of male stress and 
lack of well-being. Male respondents are also found to have moderate level of depression and suicidal thoughts.

as tea plucking or rubber tapping.95 According to Kotikula 
and Solotaroff (2006), approximately 86 percent of female 
estate workers are fieldworkers and estate women face ob-
stacles in moving up to higher-level positions. Gender seg-
regation varies by the type of estate management as well 
as the type of crop; it is found to be less severe in rubber 
estates, where 25 percent of supervisors are women, com-
pared to 5 percent in tea estates. Despite being income 
earners, there is substantial anecdotal evidence that es-
tate women’s wages are often collected by their husbands 
or fathers who, in turn, often spend it on alcohol.96 Their 
status in the estates makes women vulnerable to gen-
der-based violence (GBV ), and not only at home; there are 
also frequent reports of harassment, rape and abuse of es-

tate workers by male supervisors in the fields. According to 
a qualitative study commissioned by United Nations Pop-
ulation Fund (UNFPA) in 2003 with 350 women in estates 
in Hatton, 83 percent of women were found to be victims 
of GBV (Box 5.3).97 

233. More generally, alcoholism is found to be an is-
sue in the estates.98 Poor housing and infrastructure are 
seen as one of the reasons behind high levels of alcoholism 
in the estates. In the qualitative study conducted by the 
Center for Poverty Analysis in 2005 with the estate pop-
ulation, alcoholism was identified as a major community 
problem, especially by female and young respondents, 
and it was perceived as a primary cause of poverty. Accord-
ing to a baseline survey conducted in 2005 in the estates,

the number of working men who regularly consume alco-
hol was found to range between 50 to 75 percent.99 The 
same survey also revealed that 25 to 50 percent of daily 
earnings were spent on alcohol. Alcoholism in estates has 
number of effects, including draining household income 
and diverting funds from basic needs. Alcoholism is also 
associated with abuse of, and violence against, women in 
the estates.100

234. Over the longer term, RPCs face major challeng-
es which, given their extensive role in providing ser-
vices, may impact the estate population. RPCs histor-
ically provided social support “from womb to tomb” and 
continue to provide some services as well as guaranteed 
lifetime employment. While the youth seek to leave the 
estates in general, there is still a large population, includ-
ing a significant number of elderly dependents. The RPCs’ 
business model is under pressure from a combination of 
factors: declining profitability due to relatively higher 
wages after several increases over the past decade while 
facing stiff competition from more productive growers in 
Kenya and India; declining prices for estate commodities 
(tea, coconut products, and rubber); and reduced demand 
from key historical consumers in Russia and the Middle 
East. There are estimates that up to half of tea plantations’ 
acreage requires replanting. The difficult prospects for the 
sector may translate into profound socio-economic chal-

lenges, including loss of jobs and social support mecha-
nisms, for the estate population.

Moneragala

235. Persistent high poverty rates in Moneragala are 
related to its strong reliance on agriculture and rela-
tively little diversification within households to other 
industries. Moneragala is the second largest of the 25 dis-
tricts in Sri Lanka, with relatively low population density 
(82 per square kilometer compared to an average of 331 
for the country as a whole in 2014101). Moneragala is home 
to tea, rubber and coconut plantations and a large number 
of small holders, with 34 percent of households cultivat-
ing paddy land compared to 18 percent for the country 
as a whole. As such, it is mostly an agricultural district; 57 
percent of the workforce engaged in agricultural activities, 
compared to 31 percent for the country as a whole, while 
only 32 percent of workers are in services compared to 43 
percent for the country as a whole (LFS, 2012). Moreover, 
it has a relatively high share of self-employed agricultural 
workers and unpaid family workers, and relatively fewer 
non-farm or wage employees. The relatively low density of 
the population coupled with the high reliance on agricul-
ture suggests that households in Moneragala are less di-
versified, and as such, are especially vulnerable to agricul-
tural price fluctuations and have few alternative sources of 
income (Figure 5.15A).

236. Persistent high poverty rates in Moneragala are 
also related to relatively low access to services. Average 
levels of education are below the national average, with 
about eight years of education compared to the national 
average of nine. Access to services is in line with the na-
tional average, with the exception of electricity and san-
itation, which are well below the country average. Travel 
times to secondary schools, hospitals and agricultural cen-
ters are also higher than for the rest of the country (Figure 
5.15B). Approximately one-third of total area in the district 
is covered by natural forests under natural parks and/or 
sanctuaries that are not available for human development. 
However, there is increasing encroachment of forests, a 
growing human-wildlife conflict, and soil degradation 
from gem mining in its granite deposits.102 Further analysis 
on the determinants of poverty in Moneragala would be 
useful to design multi-sector interventions that could help 
to reduce the relatively high levels of poverty prevalent in 
the district.

B. Inclusion of Ethnic Communities

237. There are differences in poverty rates among Sri 
Lanka’s ethnic communities. Sri Lankan Tamils and Sri 
Lankan Moors constitute the two largest ethnic minority 
groups and have higher levels of poverty. Using the nation-
al poverty line, Indian Tamils and Sri Lankan Tamils have 
poverty rates that are 3.3 and 5.3 percentage points higher 
than the Sinhala population, respectively. Using the $2.50 

poverty line, the poverty headcount for Indian Tamils is 
46.3 and for Sri Lankan Tamils is 44.4 percent, compared to 
an overall poverty headcount of 32.1 percent. Using both 
poverty lines, the poverty gap for the Sri Lankan and Indi-
an Tamils is above the average (Figure 5.16). 

238. Empirical analysis finds that most of the diffe-
rences in monetary poverty is related to inequality of 
opportunities. The likelihood of being poor is not stati-
stically different for ethnic minorites relative to the Sin-
hala majority if one controls for education, ownership of 
assets,and access to services.103 Estimates from a multivari-
ate profile of risk-of-poverty 
show that the likelihood of 
being poor increases with 
the number of family mem-
bers, particularly children. 
With respect to the locati-
on of the households, rural 
households have a higher 
probability of being poor as 
opposed to urban house-
holds, while there is a high 
premium for living in the 
Western province. Any level 
of education attained after 
compulsory education ( ju-
nior secondary, O-levels) decreases the chances of being 
poor. Meanwhile, living in a household where the head has 
no education or just primary education is linked to higher 

Most of the 
differences in 
monetary poverty 
have to do with 
inequality of 
opportunities 
particularly with 
respect to education 
and access to services

chances of being poor compared to households where the 
head has completed compulsory education. Ownership 
of assets such as mobile phones, a sewing machine, or a 
television lowers the probability of being poor, as does ac-
cess to services, particularly having running water within 
premises. Age, gender, and sector of activity of the house -
hold head, once controlling for all other covariates, are not 
statistically significant in assessing the risk of poverty of an 
individual. Moreover, the probability of being poor is sta-
tistically the same for Sri Lankan and Indian Tamils, once 
individual, household, and locational characteristics are 
controlled for. This points to the fact that most of the diffe-
rences in monetary poverty have to do with inequality of 
opportunities, particularly with respect to education and 
access to services.

239. Access to services is particularly low for Tamils. 
For a range of indicators, the most recent household sur-
vey shows that Sri Lankan Tamil households have lower 
access to basic services, --including drinking water within 
their premises, the availability of a pipe borne line nearby 
their house a toilet within their unit, or access to electricity 
(Figure 5.17A). Despite increased spending on infrastruc-
ture across the country, this evidence points to remaining 
infrastructure needs, particularly related to improving 
housing services. At the same time, Sri Lankan Moors, have 
higher access to basic services than the majority Sinhala 
population. 

240. Educational attainment is lower for the ethnic 
minority workforce. While educational attainment has 

improved for all population groups, the average level of 
education for Tamils is lower than that of other ethnic 
groups, even when excluding the most war-affected re-
gions. For instance, comparable data over the last decade 
(excluding the North and Eastern Provinces) finds that 22 
percent of Sri Lankan Tamils had less than primary educa-
tion (compared to 12 percent for the Sinhalese workforce) 
and only 10 percent had completed A Levels, compared 
to 13 percent for the Sinhalese workforce. This has meant 
that, on average, the Sinhalese workforce has had consis-
tently higher levels of education when compared to the 
Tamil or Moor workforce (Figure 5.17B).

241. Rates of ownership of land are also uneven 
among the country’s ethnic communities. According to 
the 2012/13 HIES, 88.6 percent of Sinhalese households 
owned land, compared to 83.3 percent of Sri Lankan Moor 
households, 73.2 percent of Sri Lankan Tamil households, 
and 36.5 percent of Indian Tamil households (Figure 5.18). 
The lower rates of ownership among Sri Lankan Tamils, 
may be due, in part, to difficulties in restoring ownership 
rights following the destruction of property registries and 
loss of documentation owing to the conflict. The lower 
rates of ownership among Indian Tamils reflect the contin-
ued provision of housing by many estates, although recent 
years have seen cases where ownership of houses and as-
sociated plots has been transferred.

242. Empirical analysis using labor force surveys 
finds no statistical differences in unemployment rates 
across ethnic groups, while Sinhalese are more likely

to be employed in the public sector. Labor force partic-
ipation is low and unemployment is high for Sri Lankan 
Tamils and Moors, relative to the Indian Tamil and Sinha-
lese populations. However, much of this has to do with 
individual characteristics and the locational concentration 
of these populations. When focusing outside of those re-
gions, both Sri Lankan and Indian Tamils have higher labor 
force participation and employment rates relative to their 
Sinhalese counterparts. This 
suggests that different rates 
of participation are mostly 
determined by differences in 
employment opportunities. 
Moreover, quantitative anal-
ysis shows that there are no 
statistical differences in the 
likelihood of being unem-
ployed across ethnic groups, 
once you control for age, ed-
ucation and other individual 
and household character-
istics. The only exception is 
that Indian Tamil males are 
more likely to be unemployed relative to their Sinhalese 
counterparts, in line with higher male unemployment in 
the estate sector.104 In terms of the activity across popula-
tion groups, empirical analysis using the labor force sur-
veys finds that Sinhalese workers are more likely to work 
in the public sector than other ethnic groups (Figure 5.19). 
This empirical result cannot be corroborated against ad-
ministrative employment data because the ethnic make-
up of the public service is not tracked.

243. The evidence suggests that non-Sinhalese men 
are more likely to be associated with private infor-
mal-sector jobs relative to their Sinhalese counter-
parts. Even after controlling for individual characteris-
tics, such as age, education, and marital status, as well as 
household characteristics, such as the number of children 
and the district in which they are located (Figure 5.19), eth-
nic minorities seem to be more likely to work in informal 
jobs. Tamil men are generally more likely to work in pri-
vate activities relative to their Sinhalese counterparts, and 
within the private sector, Sri Lankan Tamils are more likely 
to work in informal private wage work. In contrast, Indian 
Tamil men are more likely to work in private wage work or 
to be unemployed than to work in the public sector com-
pared to their Sinhalese counterparts. Finally, Sri Lankan 
Moor men are more likely to be informal private-sector 
wage workers, informal self-employed workers, or to be 
unemployed than to work in the public sector relative to 
their Sinhalese counterparts. Non-Sinhalese women, in 
contrast, are less likely to work as private self-employed 
workers compared to their Sinhalese counterparts, while 
Sri Lankan Moor women are more likely to work in the 
public sector compared to their Sinhalese counterparts. 
For women, there seems to be a stronger likelihood of par-
ticipating in the public sector, particularly for Sri Lankan 
Moors. However, this may be associated with their relative-
ly low participation in general (see below).

244. Beyond these quantitative measures, percep-
tions of fairness, particularly when it comes to job op-
portunities, can be an important aspect in assessing

the success of efforts towards social inclusion. A per-
ception survey carried out by the Asia Foundation (2011) 
suggests that, compared to Buddhists, Hindus and Mus-
lims are less optimistic about improvements in minority 
rights and equal treatment in the government job market. 
Religious minorities were also less likely to think that the 
country is moving in the right direction.

Internally Displaced Persons and Returnees: An 
Additional Axis of Exclusion 

245. An additional dimension of exclusion across 
ethnic lines concerns internally displaced persons. 
The post-war period has seen the return of over 700,000 
displaced persons to their place of origin in the Northern 
and Eastern Provinces. Although basic material needs have 
largely been met,105 returnees nonetheless face multiple 
challenges in accessing shelter, food and infrastructure 
and developing livelihoods. There are particular difficul-
ties in securing land rights owing to the lack of an effec-
tive claims dispute mechanism and the loss of documen-
tation owing to conflict and displacement. At the same 
time, there is migration into the North and East of other 
ethnic groups -- particularly Sinhala, some of whom were 
displaced decades earlier – which creates tension over ac-
cess to land. Finally, there are also a number of long-time 
IDPs, comprised mainly of Sri Lankan Tamils and Moors, 
who are excluded from the official statistics on IDPs and 

have received lower levels of assistance. Their protracted 
displacement is sometimes hidden due to factors includ-
ing deregistration of IDPs based on whether one’s family 
place of origin is open for return, but they still live in dis-
placement. 

246. Families returning to their place of origin in the 
North are faced with problems of indebtedness. Ac-
cording to a mixed-methods study, which compares the 
amount of debt between groups who differ only in wheth-
er they engage in housing construction, households that 
engage in housing construction have significantly high-
er debt despite the housing assistance they received.106 
About 73 percent of housing beneficiaries in the sample 
reported borrowing money on top of the housing assis-
tance provided to them. Reasons for doing so included 
the desire to build larger and better houses. As most of 
the returnee families engage in casual labor and lack suffi-
cient and stable income to repay their loans, they become 
indebted. In addition, Romeshun et al. (2014) argue that 
most of the households lack financial literacy, such as 
knowledge about interest rates, and they have poor man-
agement of grant money, which worsens their debt situ-
ation. Female-headed households and households with 
disabled members are found to be particularly vulnerable. 
Anecdotal evidence suggests that there are cases of sui-
cides and attempted suicides linked to indebtedness.107

lenders in the Northern and Eastern Provinces (Figure 5.20) 
indicates both the comparatively high levels of indebted-
ness as well the resort to this less institutionalized form of 
money lending in these provinces. While high rates of in-
debtedness in the North and East do not only affect IDPs, 
their particular circumstances appear to be the main driver 
of the problem.

247. Local empowerment in areas with concentrations 
of minorities remains an issue. Some empowerment 
has occurred, notably through the holding of elections to 
provincial councils and, more recently, the return of some 
lands occupied by the military and the appointment of a 
civilian governor to the Northern Province. While there are 
reports of easing, the high number of security forces in the 
conflict-affected areas has been cited as one of the main 
obstacles for IDP returnees and others in rebuilding their 
livelihoods and achieving durable solutions.108 Reported 
continued surveillance and engagement by the military 
in local economic activities also have negatively affected 
IDP returnees and communities affected by the conflict.109 
Settlement and implementation of a division of authority 
between national, provincial, and local governments, espe-
cially in the North and East, remains an outstanding chal-
lenge. In addition, ensuring that further reconstruction and 
development projects proceed in a participatory manner 
will be important for inclusion.

C. Gender Inclusion 

Low Female Labor Force Participation 

248. Sri Lanka faces a low and slightly declining rate 
of female labor force participation. Sri Lanka’s female la-
bor participation had been stable at slightly below 40 per-
cent for the past few decades up until the 2000s, when it 
started to decline. Although participation of women in the 
labor force is higher in Sri Lanka than its South Asian com-
parators, it is lower than comparable middle-income coun-
tries, despite decades of low 
levels of fertility and good 
educational outcomes (Fig-
ure 5.21A). In 2013, female 
labor 
force participation 
stood at 35.6 percent, com-
pared to a male participation 
rate of 74.9 percent. More-
over, participation has been

slightly declining over the last decade. Across age groups, 
the drop in labor force participation rates was highest for 
the youth (Figure 5.21B). To a large extent, this is due to 
more young women continuing their education. In fact 
this is the main reason for non-participation among young 
women in 63 percent of cases in the 2012 labor force sur-
vey, up from 57.6 percent in 2002. In contrast, labor force 
participation for 60 to 69 year olds has increased over time.

249. Female labor force participation rates are higher 
for those with either low or high levels of education. 
Women with A-levels had participation rates that were 17 
percentage points higher than those with O-levels (the 
next highest level of education) in 2012, and those with a 
degree or more had a participation rate 36 points higher 
than those with A-levels (Figure 5.21C). However, the dif-
ference in participation rates between highly educated 
women and those with less education is narrowing, albeit 
slowly. This is seen by the flattening of the curve in Fig-
ure 5.21C over time and holds true even when controlling 
for other regional and individual characteristics. Between 
2003 and 2012, the difference in the likelihood of partici-
pating declined by 8 and 7 percent for women with incom-
plete primary and completed primary education, respec-
tively, relative to those with university degrees or higher.110

250. As in most countries, labor force participation is 
lower for married women and for those with children. 
Indeed, the labor force survey confirms that separated 
or divorced women have the highest rates of labor force 
participation, while participation for married and never 
married females is similar (Figure 5.21D). Married women 
were less likely to participate than similar single women, 
who in turn were less likely to participate than separated 
or divorced women once we control for age, education, re-
gional and other individual and household characteristics, 
in line with previous analysis.111 Similarly, women with chil-
dren under 5 were less likely to participate. On the other 
hand, the presence of other adults in the household who 
presumably can take care of children is commonly found 
to increase labor force participation by women. This sug-
gests that better access to affordable quality childcare fa-
cilities could stimulate female labor force participation.112 
Furthermore, marriage changes the definitions of what

251. Social norms related to women’s role in the 
household and especially as related to childcare re-
sponsibilities restrict women’s opportunity to partic-
ipate in the labor market. About 66 percent of women 
who did not participate cited “household activities” as the 

main reason for non-participation in 2012, in line with 
earlier years. This is similar across urban and rural regions, 
but less common for young women (who are most often 
studying) and those in the estate sector (who more often 
cite old age/retirement). Interestingly, 71 percent of wom-
en with higher levels of education (A levels or more) cite 
“household activities” compared to 64 of cases for wom-
en with lower level of education114. Indeed, “marriage de-

fines culturally appropriate behavior beyond economic 
need, individual ability, and individual preference”.115 Most 
notably, once married, women traditionally carry care re-
sponsibilities for children and elderly in the household. In 
a survey conducted on attitudes towards gender norms in 
four districts of Sri Lanka, more than half of the male and 
female respondents agreed that childcare is primarily the 
mother ’s responsibility and that women’s most important 
role is to take care of her home and cook for the family.116 
More generally, perceptions of culturally appropriate em-
ployment as opposed to the actual opportunities avail-
able may leave women unemployed.117 According to the 
National Youth Survey 2013, 64 percent of young women 
mention respectability as an important factor in their job 
selection.118 Finally, the type of degrees completed could 
play a role, especially when looking at arts degrees.119

Gender Wage Gap and Occupational Segregation 

252. Beyond social norms, gender wage gaps and oc-
cupational segregation dissuade and constrain women 
from participating in the labor force. Female education-
al achievement is higher and has been growing faster than 
that of men. For instance, the O-level completion rates

were about four percentage points higher for females than 
for males in 2012, reflecting a widening over the 2002-to-
2012 period. Despite higher levels of education for wom-
en, wages for women continue to be lower than wages for 
men, with women earning 84 percent of male wages in 
2012 (Figure 5.22A). Even when taking differences in the 
types of jobs where men and women tend to be employed 
into account, the wage gap in 2012 cannot be explained 
by observable characteristics or by differences in the types 
of work that men and women typically engage in. More-
over, this unexplained share has increased since 2003 
(Figure 5.22B), which is likely to reduce the willingness of 
women to work. As Sinha (2012) highlights, public-sector 
jobs have less of a problem in this regard, with the rela-
tively better gender parity in earnings in the public sector, 
making it more attractive for women to seek employment 
there. In addition, the public sector typically offers shorter 
workdays – which allow working mothers and wives to at-
tend to their household duties while maintaining the per-
ception of respectability – as well as other monetary and 
non-monetary benefits (maternity leave, vacations, sick 
leave, pension benefits, etc.). 

253. Discrimination in hiring practices is hard to 
prove. However, a Marga Survey conducted in the 1980s, 
for instance, pointed to biases against married women due 
to the perceived need for extra facilities and higher costs 
in the form of absenteeism and maternity leave.120 Finally, 
due to a high degree of occupational segregation based

on social attitudes about appropriate jobs for women, 
relatively few occupations, such as teaching, semi-skilled 
and unskilled production work (often in textiles) and do-
mestic service, are available to Sri Lankan women.121 Some 
of these jobs, such as working in garment factories in free 
trade zones, are associated with exploitation and stigmati-
zation, which may deter women from entering into the la-
bor market.122 In addition, the legal framework governing 
work in the private sector prevents women from taking up 
night work or part-time work in the growing service sec-
tor.123 Moreover, the laws governing maternity benefits124

 The Shop and Office Employees Act No. 19 of 1954 states under 
paragraph 10(2) that “a person who has attained the age of fourteen 
years and who [...] is a female, shall not be employed in or about the busi-
ness of a shop or office before 6 am or after 6pm on any day“. Exception 
included in the act include: (i) women from the age of eighteen years may 
be employed in or about the business of a hotel or restaurant for the peri-
od between 6pm and 10pm; (ii) women from the age of eighteen may be 
employed in a residential hotel before 6am or after 6pm; and (iii) women 
from the age of eighteen may be employed in or about the business of a 
shop or office for the period between 6pm and 8pm. See Shop and Office 
Employees Act accessed at: http://www.ilo.org/dyn/travail/docs/1350/
Shop20and%20Office%20Employees%20Act.pdf (April 1, 2015). 
124 Maternity benefits in Sri Lanka’s private sector are governed by 
the Maternity Benefits Ordinance No. 32 of 1939 (for women employed 
in any trade) and the Shop and Office Employees Act No. 19 of 1954 (for 
women employed in shops and offices) (Abeykoon et al. 2014). In 1993, 
Sri Lanka ratified the ILO Maternity Protection Convention (Revised) 1952 
(No. 103). However, there remain shortcomings between the national 
legislation and the ILO convention (see Abeykoon et al. (2014: 13). One 
of the shortcomings is that maternity benefit payments are financed 
through employer liability. It is commonly argued that employer liability 
for maternity benefits lead to discrimination of women who are pregnant 

make employers bear the entire cost, potentially deterring 
employers from hiring women.125 

254. Finally, there are notable differences in female 
labor force participation among provinces and eth-
nic groups (Figure 5.23). Participation in the Northern 
and Eastern Provinces is particularly low at 26.2 percent 
and 23.6 percent, respectively. The special circumstances 
for women due to war and effects of the 2004 tsunami in 
these regions – including high levels of gender-based vio-
lence and early marriage to war widowers – may contrib-
ute to the problem. Indian Tamil women are much more 
likely to participate in the labor force – their participation 
rate lies at 55 percent – and the participation by Sri Lank-
an Moor women is lowest, at 16.2 percent. While the high 
participation rate by Indian Tamil women can be explained 
by their location in the estate sector and the special labor 
conditions there, cultural and social norms in the house -
hold are likely to play a key role in determining the labor 
force participation of Sri Lankan Moor women.126 

Female Labor Migrants and Their Families: The 
Inclusion Challenges of Migration

255. One way that women participate in labor has 
been through migration, which poses particular inclu-
sion challenges. A significant body of literature focuses 

or might become pregnant (Abeykoon et al. 2014:4). Furthermore, mater-
nity benefits financed through employer liability are difficult to enforce 
(Abeykoon et al. 2014:4).

on the well being of female migrants outside Sri Lanka and 
the situation of the families they leave behind.127 While 
the share of women in departures for foreign employ-
ment has declined overall since the mid-1990s, women 
still constituted 49 percent of departures in 2012.128 Out of 
the women migrating for foreign employment in 2012, 86 
percent were to be employed as housemaids. Most female 
migrants are married, have children and come from lower 
income groups.129 Poverty, lack of employment in Sri Lanka 
with adequate wages, the desire to improve the econom-
ic status of their families (including building a permanent 
home and acquiring land), better education for their chil-
dren, and overcoming economic difficulties like indebted-
ness are often cited as reasons for women’s departures.130

256. Women’s migration has impacts on the family 
that is left behind, most notably on the children in the 
household, with implications for society more broad-
ly. In the absence of the mother, the extended family and 
husbands take up care responsibilities for children in fe -
male migrant households.131 With the primary care giver 
being absent, children are sometimes found to be more 
exposed to abuse, including sexual abuse and incest.132 
Poor financial management at home can put the benefits 
of migration at risk. Some studies find the educational per-
formance and attendance of children of migrant mothers 
to be lower.133 Upon the return of the migrating mother, 
family relationships are often disrupted due to the long 
absence of the mother, her exposure to a different con-
text, her newly gained economic power deriving from her 
income and changing the power dynamics at home, and 
the non-acceptance of all this by other family members, 
especially by spouses.134 This can ultimately lead to the 
separation of spouses, additionally impacting children’s 
opportunities. In response to the realization of these po-
tential social costs of migrating mothers, the government 
has put in place regulations, including minimum age re-

Women in Leadership Roles

257. Women are under-represented in political life. 
Sri Lanka boasts having produced the world’s first wom-
an prime minister in 1960, and women have been enjoy-
ing the right to vote since 1931. However, despite the fact 
that women make up nearly 53 percent of the population, 
they are under-represented in political and public deci-
sion-making bodies. Women make up only 5.8 percent of 
parliamentarians in the current National Parliament, 4.1 
percent in Provincial Councils and a negligible 1.8 percent 
in local government, among the lowest in the world, and 
certainly in South Asia.136 The percentage of women in 
parliament between the 1930s and the present has never 
exceeded 7 percent (Figure 5.24). A shift in 1989 to an elec-
toral system based on proportional representation, which 
elsewhere has generally proven more favorable to women, 
has not led to a significant change in the numbers of wom-
en elected over the years.

258. Women are also under-represented on pri-
vate-sector boards. Ratwatte (2012) noted that of the 
country ’s 25 top corporate entities, which have a total of 
198 directors, only 10 are women.137 Although women on

Sri Lankan corporate boards are valued for what they can 
contribute and in every sense are considered no less equal 
to the job than their male counterparts, they take only 5 
percent of leadership roles in the private sector. Similarly, 
a study using 2009 data found that only 13 percent of top 
management positions in nine commercial banks in Sri 
Lanka are held by women.138 

D. Priorities on Inclusion

259. The significant locational concentration of mon-
etary poverty in urban areas points to harnessing the 
urbanization process to benefit the poor and the bot-
tom 40 percent. The highest numbers of people living 
in poverty and the bottom 40 percent are located within 
multi-city agglomeration areas and can benefit from ef-
forts to increase competitiveness discussed in Chapter IV. 
Providing for effective governance of cities to allow for re -
sponsiveness to changing social and economic conditions 
and addressing inclusion challenges will be important. 
Local officials will need to have sufficient administrative 
authority, financial resources and capacity to delivery ser-
vices and conduct integrated, strategic planning. An em-
powered local government could be more responsive to 
addressing gaps in service delivery and infrastructure, par-
ticularly in addressing connectivity and other constraints 
to agglomeration that will affect the bottom 40 percent ’s 
ability to secure good jobs.

260. Key priorities to address the inclusion challeng-
es across space, ethnicity and gender include concert-
ed efforts to reduce poverty, improve public-service 
provision and promote employment opportunities in 

138 Gunawaredena, Kennedy (2010).

KEY KNOWLEDGE GAPS

the North, East, Moneragala, and the estates. Multi-sec-
tor interventions that address lack of job opportunities in 
the North and East would help to reduce poverty and en-
sure shared prosperity. This could include small works pro-
grams aimed at improving market accessibility, incentives 
to promote entrepreneurship among educated youth and 
direct programs to help ex-combatants and female-head-
ed households would go a long way to ensuring inclusion 
of the most vulnerable. In the estates, multi-sector inter-
ventions to improve nutrition outcomes, enhance job op-
portunities for the youth and prepare for a growing num-
ber of aging estate workers would help in ensuring their 
inclusion in shared growth.

261. Concerted efforts need to be continued to im-
prove equality of opportunity across ethnic groups, re-
gardless of where these populations reside. This mainly 
requires an improvement in job opportunities for ethnic 
minorities. However, it also points to the need to address 
land claims in the former conflict areas, providing assis-
tance to new and “old” IDPs, equalizing assistance to wid-
ows whose families are victims of the conflict regardless 
of which side they were on and integrated efforts to assist 
ex-combatants. These efforts, in addition to improved so-
cial protection systems (Chapter III) and better job oppor-
tunities (Chapter IV ), will help to provide equality of op-
portunity and foster inclusion.

262. Critical emphasis is needed on increasing labor 
force participation of women and ensuring that they 
enjoy equal opportunity accessing jobs as well as polit-
ical and private sector leadership positions. Priorities in 
this area include improving women’s education and incen-
tives for participation through a better alignment of the 
education women pursue and the demands of the market; 
reforming legislation that prevents or deters women from 
being hired; and fostering greater participation of women 
in leadership positions.

Sustaining peace and security through long-term reconciliation efforts among Sri Lanka’s heterogeneous society 
is the sine qua non for progress towards the twin goals. 
Developing a more accountable and effective state to follow through on recently initiated governance reforms.
Putting heavier emphasis on direct investment and long-term private-sector flows will be needed to sustain Sri 
Lanka’s external fiscal position.
Balancing imperatives to preserve its natural assets, provide for health and livability to its citizens (especially in 
urban areas), and foster growth.
 ■ Managing the impact of climate change through adaption, mitigation, as well as strategies that reduce the carbon 
footprint.
Addressing long-term fiscal sustainability concerns related to population aging.

Sustaining Sri Lanka’s Development 

263. The prospects for progress towards eradicating 
poverty and promoting shared prosperity depend on 
the sustainability of Sri Lanka’s impressive develop-
ment trajectory. As with any country, there are risks that 
external or internal conditions that have facilitated prog-
ress to date do not continue to hold true. There are also 
risks of the emergence of new factors that can meaning-
fully impact progress. 

264. Some key risks in Sri Lanka’s recent pattern of 
growth and progress towards the twin goals have al-
ready materialized and are important constraints 
reviewed in previous sections. These risks include the 
challenges of sustaining growth based on internal con-
sumption growth and increased public investment; the fis-
cal challenge of declining revenues and increasing needs 
for investment in human and physical capital; the lack of 
diversification and the need to develop a more competi-
tive, open economy that encourages formality and inno-
vation; and providing for equality of opportunity and in-
clusion of all segments of the population. Risks to social 
sustainability – in particular higher levels of disaffection 
coupled with higher unemployment and levels of distrust 
in government among the youth – are evident in the in-
clusion section. For the most part, these areas reflect the 
manner in which government policies have shaped the 
contours of the country ’s economy and opportunities for 
its citizens.

265. There are four other issues important to sustain-
ability and fundamental to continued progress. The 
first area is the necessity to achieve a lasting settlement 
that ensures peace and security for Sri Lankans. This is 
the sine qua non condition for progress. The second area 
involves the challenges inherent in the major institutional 

114   |   VI. Sustainability

overhaul now taking place. The third area is economic sta-
bility in the context of the external environment. Finally, 
Sri Lanka will continue to face environmental challenges, 
particularly the risk of climate change.

A. Social Risks to Sustainability

Peace and Security

266. Global experience indicates that countries that 
have recently been in internal conflict are much more 
prone to outbreaks of new conflict, suggesting that Sri 
Lanka is an “at risk” country. The 2011 World Develop-
ment Report found nine out of 10 outbreaks of new con-
flicts in the 2000s occurred in countries that had recently 
previously experienced conflict and all civil wars that oc-
curred since 2003 occurred in countries that previous-
ly had been in civil war. Of course, every country has its 
unique circumstances that may or may not make it vulner-
able to conflict. In Sri Lanka’s particular case, the combat-
ants who challenged the state in previous decades – the 
LTTE and, earlier, leftist groups in the south – are no longer 
direct threats following their comprehensive defeat or in-
tegration into the political mainstream. However, the lack 
of an evident armed threat at present does not ensure no 
new outbreak of conflict in the future. Having won the war, 
Sri Lanka needs to secure the peace. 

267. The quantum of impact from conflict makes it 
a serious risk even if the likelihood of a new outbreak 
appears low. Conflict inflicts direct and indirect costs at 
national, local and personal levels and lack of security un-
dermines the well-being of all Sri Lankans. As noted earlier 
in Chapter II, one estimate of the cost of Sri Lanka’s internal 
conflicts was nearly 5 percent of GDP from 1978 to 2002. 
Conflict would impair the country ’s ability to address the 

constraints outlined above, from dealing with the fiscal 
challenge to diversification of the economy. 

268. Sri Lanka’s Commission of Inquiry on Lessons 
Learned and Reconciliation (LLRC) identified in 2011 a 
broad array of steps to achieve reconciliation among 
the country’s communities. These steps focus on: ensur-
ing rule of law ; addressing citizens’ grievances; devolving 
power; upholding language policy allowing for official use 
of multiple languages; providing for equality of opportu-
nity ; and strengthening inter-communal and inter-per-
sonal ties. Most important, political consensus to work 
towards reconciliation by political leaders representing all 
communities, in and outside of government, is needed to 
underpin these efforts. These recommendations are con-
sonant with successful experience in breaking the cycle of 
violence in other countries, namely the need for rebuild-
ing confidence in the state by providing an institutional 
framework that provides citizens with security, justice, and 
jobs.139

Much has been done 
to implement LLRC 
recommendations 
but much remains to 
be done

269. Much has been done to implement LLRC recom-
mendations but much remains to be done. The govern-
ment carried out a far-reaching program of resettlement of 
those displaced by conflict: 
demilitarization, 
rehabili-
tation and reintegration of 
ex-combatants; de-mining 
of nearly all land; and rapid 
reconstruction of social and 
connective 
infrastructure 
destroyed by conflict. Prog-
ress in these areas has been 
substantial in the short six 
years since the end of the war, though infrastructure and 
other public goods that provide for equality of opportuni-
ty are still at lower levels than the rest of the country. Other 
issues have been partially addressed. These include imple-
menting a trilingual public service policy and holding East-
ern and Northern Provincial Council elections, as well as 
organizing North-South exchange programs for students 
and civil society and making efforts to recruit Tamil-speak-
ing local police officers. 

270. There have been recent renewed efforts to pro-
mote inter-communal harmony. Since the change of 
government in January 2015, several steps have been tak-
en to address Tamil grievances, such as quickly moving to 
appoint a civilian governor, expediting domestic mecha-
nisms to address accountability in connection with allega-
tions of crimes during the conflict, and, more slowly, re-

leasing land used by the military in the North and East. The 
new president was elected with the tacit support of the 
leading Tamil party and contains leaders from the main 
Muslim parties. Symbolic steps have been taken, including 
having Tamil party leaders participate in national celebra-
tions for the first time in decades. An international inquiry 
into accountability issues delayed its reporting in recog-
nition of the policy intent and steps undertaken by the 
government to address reconciliation. There have been 
no notable episodes of inter-communal violence since the 
new government was elected.

271. Yet challenges remain to achieving lasting rec-
onciliation. A political settlement on the institutional 
framework that addresses issues of voice of local commu-
nities is still to be worked out. In particular, incoherence 
in the assignment of powers between the central govern-
ment and provincial government is a source of continuing 
tension in the North. There is still a large, albeit lessening, 
military presence that inter feres with localities through its 
surveillance, economic activities, and occupation of land. 
There has been little progress towards closure on social 
justice, particularly accountability in connection with al-
legations of crimes committed during the conflict, as well 
as resolution of cases of disappearances. The sensitivity of 
this issue is heightened by the considerable international 
attention it attracts. Equality of opportunity that will pro-
vide the conditions for citizens of all communities to find 
rewarding jobs is critical to inclusion. While there has been 
progress in recent years, there is still a gap in opportuni-
ties, particularly in more rural, isolated areas. Sustained ef-
forts will be needed to address these sensitive issues. 

Other Social Risks

272. High levels of unemployment for youth – partic-
ularly educated youth – pose risks to social sustainabil-
ity. Declining employment prospects for youth can lead 
to frustration and ultimately, tensions.140 Youth seeking 
government jobs frequently report the influence of social 
networks in obtaining them. In the National Youth Sur-
vey 2013, 54.4 percent pointed to “political connections” 
and 30 percent to “family connections” in obtaining pub-
lic-sector employment, signaling an uneven playing field 
and causing exclusion. In the past, frustrations with social 
hierarchy, patronage systems and the unavailability of ap-
propriate employment opportunities are argued to have 
played a role in tumult involving large numbers of youth 
in Sri Lanka since the early 1970s.141 The same youth sur-
vey points to pessimistic views about the political situation

of the country and low trust towards public institutions 
among other issues; in 2013, 89 percent said they have lit-
tle trust in political parties, up sharply from 47 percent in 
1999-2000.142 Continuing disparities in income, consump-
tion and access to services, which affect ethnic minorities 
and create mutual suspicion, can constitute another risk to 
cohesion. Finally, displacement resulting from conflict and 
natural disasters has created tensions around land.143 With 
the return of IDPs, land ownership is contested between 
returnees and late occupants. In several conflict-affected 
areas, land rights are being used as a tool to promote po-
litical patronage. This can exacerbate inter-ethnic tensions, 
particularly in areas where minority communities long dis-
placed are returning.144 Land disputes can also threaten 
to undermine the relations between government officials 
and communities.145 

Institutional Change

273. The 19th Constitutional Amendment reflects con-
sensus to reducing the powers of the presidency, but is 
a major overhaul in the country’s institutional frame-
work and will require a period of adjustment. The pas-
sage of the 19th Amendment in April 2015 creates stron-
ger accountability mechanisms through the introduction 
of a presidential-parliamentary form of government and 
strengthening the autonomy and role of independent 
commissions. Additional reforms are expected to insti-
tute a right to information regime and strengthened audit 
and procurement oversight mechanisms. There is a large 
degree of political consensus around the need to reduce 
the perceived excessive concentration of power in the 
presidency and lack of accountability and transparency. 
Enacting these institutional changes was a core campaign 
promise, which helped secure President Sirisena’s elec-
tion in January 2015. Despite contentious debate, the 19th 
Amendment eventually was nearly unanimously adopted 
by Parliament. Notwithstanding this consensus and the 
goal of ensuring greater accountability, it remains to be 
seen how the new framework will operate. There will be a 
“working in” period as the newly formed Cabinet and inde-
pendent commissions undertake their roles in a changed 
institutional framework. 

274. Any such major change is complex and affects 
the interests of many who may respond in unexpected 
ways. The prior government was in power for nine years 

and was widely thought likely to continue for several more 
years. Public servants and entrepreneurs alike had adapt-
ed to the policies, institutional framework and governance 
style of the previous government, and will need to adjust 
to new circumstances. 

B. Economic Risks to Sustainability

External Risks

275. Achieving a more sustainable external position 
will require a heavier emphasis on direct investment 
and long-term private sector flows. In line with the anal-
ysis presented in Chapter IV, recent external debt sustain-
ability analysis146 has highlighted potential vulnerabilities 
to external sustainability including: (i) a chronic current ac-
count deficit and relatively low reserve adequacy metrics; 
(ii) a gradual but steady decline in goods exports as a share 
of GDP; (iii) a similar decline in Sri Lanka’s share of world 
exports; (iv) an already high external debt burden and a 
rising cost for external financing as Sri Lanka shifts to mid-
dle-income status and bilateral concessional debt is re-
placed with borrowing on commercial terms; and (v) mod-
est increases in foreign direct investment, which would 
otherwise alleviate the need for debt financing. While the 
current account deficit has decreased in recent years, it re-
mains financed largely by debt-creating inflows and cen-
tral bank foreign exchange reserves are at the lower end of 
what is considered adequate by standard metrics.

276. With the country’s shift to middle-income status, 
concessional borrowing sources are drying up and are 
being replaced by borrowing on commercial terms. 
The authorities have been successful in tapping interna-
tional markets consistently with sovereign bond issues 
and lengthening the average maturity of the debt portfo-
lio.147 Between 2007 and 2014, the government sold USD 
7 billion of sovereign bonds. As a result of increased com-
mercial borrowings, the non-concessional and commercial 
component of the government foreign debt rose from 1 
percent in 2000 to 50 percent in 2013. Recently, the bank-
ing sector was also borrowing overseas at relatively high 
yields.148

277. Beyond the fiscal and external risks 
pointed out throughout this report, an ag-
ing population will strain public and external 
finances in the long term. Sri Lanka is in the 
midst of its demographic transition, and is pro-
jected to age fast in the next few decades. The 
elderly dependency ratio reached its minimum 
in the 1970s and 1980s and, thanks to increases 
in life expectancy, has been rising steadily since 
then. Under likely population projection scenar-
ios, the elderly dependency ratio is set to rise 
further to about 25 percent by 2020, and could 
then stabilize around 33 percent under the no-
change scenario or rise to 99 percent under the 
low-fertility scenario (Figure 6.1). Private-sector 
savings are expected to fall, as the elderly draw 
down their savings, while increased current fis-
cal expenditure on aging (health, pensions, and 
long-term care) will negatively affecting pub-
lic-sector savings. As a result, the already low 
national savings rate would further undermine 
the negative savings-investment balance.

278. Population aging will likely impact the 
fiscal accounts through three channels: tax 
revenue, fiscal expenditure, and GDP growth. In the 
absence of a tax reform, a decline in the labor force will 
lead to falling revenue from income tax. An increase in the 
share of elderly will lead to higher expenditure on pen-
sions, health and long-term care, much of which would be 
expected to be covered by the national budget. There may 
be savings in education expenditure to the extent that 
only the young receive education, though from the per-
spective of improving educational outcomes to increase 
Sri Lanka’s competitiveness, more public expenditure on 
education may be needed instead. The combination of fall-
ing income taxes and increased expenditures will lead to 
persistent deficits and consequent accumulation of public 
debt. Increased debt, in turn, will lead to further increases 
in expenditure through interest payments. Finally, a slow-
down in labor growth and potentially lower investment (as 
discussed above) will lead to a slowdown in GDP growth, 
which will worsen the capacity of the economy to sustain 
high debt. There may also be feedback effects, where gov-
ernment fiscal policy may affect the decision of the elderly 
whether to retire or stay in the labor force.

279. Moreover, Sri Lanka is relatively older and poor-
er compared to other countries facing an aging popu-
lation. Sri Lanka is already a relatively old country, espe-
cially compared to other South Asian countries, although 
its population is still younger than countries in Europe and 
Central Asia and a number of middle-income East Asian 

Sri Lanka faces a 
challenge to “get rich 
before getting old”

countries (Figure 6.2A). The projected share of 60+ in total 
population as of 2015 is 13.4 percent, but the share of el-
derly is projected to increase 
to 25.7 percent of total pop-
ulation by 2050, an increase 
of 12.3 percentage points. Sri 
Lanka is also relatively poor 
given its age. Compared to 
other Asian countries with a 
similar elderly dependency ratio, Sri Lanka’s GDP per cap-
ita is low ; hence there is urgency to “get rich before get-
ting old.” Moreover, Sri Lanka’s social expenditure (most of 
which is age-related) is relatively small compared to other 
similar-age countries. As shown earlier, expenditure on 
health is relatively low and has been declining over time 
(Figure 6.2B). Expenditure on pensions is 1.4 percent of 
GDP -- reflecting its limited scope, which comprises only 
retired public-sector workers.

280. 
 Between now and 2060, the elderly dependen-
cy ratio is projected to rise sharply, while the young 
dependency ratio is projected to fall. The population is 
projected to peak in the mid-2040s before starting to fall 
(Figure 6.3). Life expectancy at birth has increased from 60 
years for the cohort born in 1960 to 74 years for the 2012 
cohort. The share of the population above 60 will increase 
from 13 percent to 27 percent by 2060 under the medi-
um-fertility scenario.

281. 
Illustrative simulations of the long-term impact 
of aging on the fiscal accounts can help shed light on 
the constraints and policy space available to the gov-
ernment.149 A baseline scenario of no tax reform and a pol-
icy of bringing public health and education expenditure 
to levels closer to other middle-income countries would 
lead to a steady rise in primary (non-interest) expenditure 
from 14 percent of GDP in 2013 to 20 percent of GDP by 
2060. This widening primary deficit combined with a slow-
ing GDP growth would lead to a rapidly growing level of 
public debt-to-GDP from 78 percent of GDP at end-2013 
surpassing 150 percent of GDP within two decades. Inter-
est payments would form the majority of public spending, 
which would be clearly unsustainable. 

149 
 Simulations based on publicly available information by Bank staff 
available upon request. These simulations do not constitute official World 
Bank projections. While the current numbers are based on actual data as 
of end-2013, the projected numbers are based on simple projections of 
the tax base (revenue) and projected trends in demographics and cost 
inflation (expenditure). It should be noted that these simulations do not 
take into account the fact that many (informal sector) workers are not 
covered by neither the public nor the private sector pension scheme, and 
in the future there may be pressure to extend coverage to those workers 
as well. Neither do they it include possible future public expenditure on 
long-term care.

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A major tax reform to 
gradually lift revenue 
could offset the 
projected increases in 
expenditure, contain 
the fiscal deficit, and 
put public debt back 
on a declining path

282. Public policy action may help avert this scenario 
through tax reforms and increasing the retirement age 
in line with rising life ex-
pectancy. With only about 4 
percent of the working-age 
population paying 
income 
tax, there is scope to coun-
teract the slowdown and 
eventual decline in the labor 
force by having more people 
pay income tax. For other 
taxes, there is also scope to 
gradually but persistently 
widen the tax base, reduce 
exemptions and improve tax 
collection (Chapter III). A ma-
jor tax reform that would gradually lift revenue to 22 per-
cent of GDP over time could offset the projected increase 
in expenditure on education, health and public-sector 
pensions sufficiently to achieve a primary surplus and con-
tain the fiscal deficit, and put public debt back on a declin-
ing path. 

283. Extending the retirement age could temporarily 
boost GDP growth, but its impact would not be enough 
to reverse the debt dynamics, due to inertia in the la-
bor market and demographics. Gradually extending the 
retirement age for public-sector workers could help stabi-
lize public pension expenditure, but it would have only a 
small effect on labor market dynamics and GDP growth. 
Due to inertia, it would not fix the fiscal deficit as fast as 
tax reform would. If people work longer across the board, 
it would temporarily reverse the declining labor force and 
income-tax revenue as more people would enter than exit 
during the transition. This temporary boost to GDP and 
revenue would make the debt dynamics look more favor-
able, but it would not make it sustainable by itself.

284. Any reform of this nature will be politically sensi-
tive and needs to be gradual, but delaying reform will 
force more painful actions to be taken later. Tax reform 
will not increase tax revenue at once, and such reforms will 
face political economy challenges. However, the sooner 
tax revenue increases, the more space there will be for ex-
penditure later. Similarly, increases in the retirement age 
can be implemented only slowly, so preparation has to 
start soon. 

C. Environmental Risks to 
Sustainability 

dition of conservation dating back over 2,000 years when 
ancient edicts called for the preservation of wildlife in de-
fined areas. Its extraordinary variety of landscapes and bio-
diversity is today relatively unaffected with low levels of 
air, water, and land pollution. For instance, its air quality is 
the best in South Asia, in large part thanks to its effective 
vehicle emissions control system, though the anticipated 
doubling of private vehicle traffic between 2010 and 2020 
and an increase in use of coal for power generation will 
pose an increasing challenge. Sri Lanka’s natural assets 
provide for high levels of livability and contribute to Sri 
Lanka’s attractiveness for tourism. 

286. However, there are environmental challenges to 
be managed. There has been an increase in arable land 
due to the expansion of agriculture at a rate of 2.7 percent 
per year between 2006 and 2011, the years for which in-
formation is available150. Correspondingly there has been a 
reduction in forest cover from 33.2 percent in 2000 to 29.7 
percent in 2010 (which does not take into account likely 
losses in the conflict affected north). Sri Lanka had the 
fifth highest rate of deforestation (15 percent) in the world 
during the period 2000-2005, with consequences for wa-
tersheds and soil loss, and leading to a panoply of eco-
nomic and environmental damages. A recent 2010 World 
Bank study found that 
economic 
losses 
from 
land and environmental 
degradation far exceed 
(by orders of magnitude) 
the revenue from agri-
culture, suggesting that 
limits to land conversion 
have likely been reached. 
This has contributed to 
high and rising levels of 
species extinction; ac-
cording to a recent sur-
vey, 33 percent of inland 
vertebrate fauna and 61 percent of its flora are nationally 
threatened. Fresh water resources are at risk due to en-
croachment that occurs in the absence of adequate water-
shed planning and enforcement. 

Economic losses from 
land and environmental 
degradation far 
exceed revenue from 
expansion of agriculture, 
suggesting that limits 
to land conversion have 
been reached

287. Soil conservation is critical for agricultural pro-
ductivity and particularly for poorer households who 
are most dependent on agriculture for their liveli-
hoods. The clearing of forests for new lands that cause in-
creased runoff and siltation rates in steeply sloped lands as 
well as intensive farming practices are linked to declining 
productivity. The Global Assessment of Soil Degradation 

285. Sri Lanka has a significant advantage in its rich 
natural asset base that can be a long-term contributor 
to growth and quality of life. The country has a rich tra-

150 

 FAO 2013

Sri Lanka — Ending Poverty and Promoting Shared Prosperity   |   119

suggests that nearly 33 percent of Sri Lanka’s land area 
is severely or very severely degraded in terms of reduced 
agricultural productivity. A Bank study found that the po-
tential cost savings of better nutrient management is be-
tween US$50 million to 100 million over a 20-year period, 
suggesting high economic returns to soil conservation.

288. Protection of watersheds is vital for agricultur-
al irrigation, domestic water use, flood attenuation, 
forestry, fishing, recreation and other services to the 
population and environment. The total annual value of 
watershed services in the Southern Province is estimated 
to range from US$2,128 per hectare (ha) in the Muthura-
jawela Marsh to US$12,494 for mangrove forests and to 
US$622,845 for coral reefs. In contrast, the estimate by 
the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MEA) of the aver-
age annual global value of watershed benefits stands at 
US$3,274/ha. Moreover, the average revenue from paddy 
cultivation in Sri Lanka is estimated at only US$750/ha. 
Thus the payoffs from watershed benefits far exceed the 
marginal financial returns from paddy cultivation – the de-
fault option in agriculture. Protection of water resources is 
also vitally important for human health. There are strong 
indications that chronic kidney disease, a disease afflicting 
over 10,000 persons, stems from high chemical concentra-
tions in domestic and irrigation water supply151. 

289. Sri Lanka’s solid waste management challenge 
is linked to the rapid pace of urbanization. Waste gen-
eration is characterized by distinct geographic patterns in 
Sri Lanka, with higher volumes being generated in more 
prosperous urban areas and provinces. Collection rates av-
erage 31 percent whereas other middle-income countries 
have average collection rates of 68 percent.152 The bulk of 
waste is organic, suggesting there is scope for reducing 
the pollution load of wastes requiring ultimate disposal, 
and for employment generation through complementary 
composting activities. Poor management of solid wastes 
in Sri Lanka is a direct consequence of under-investment 
and corresponding policies. A 2011 World Bank study 
identified a funding gap that is estimated to rise to LKR 1.6 
billion ($16 million) by 2015 and a further LKR. 4.2 billion 
($42 million) by 2020.

290. Sri Lanka will be well served in seeking to ob-
tain environmentally, socially and economically equi-
table growth – or green growth -- now and long into 
the future, especially in urban areas. The large Colom-
bo metropolitan region in particular will need to balance 
these priorities in order to have sustainable urban growth

Holistic, long term 
planning across 
sectors is needed to 
obtain enviromentally 
socially and 
economically 
equitable growth

while enhancing its livabil-
ity and quality of life for its 
inhabitants. This will require 
holistic, long-term planning 
across 
sectors, coordina-
tion among agencies and a 
broad range of stakeholders 
– including the government, 
non-governmental organi-
zations, the private sector, 
and the general public – and 
may be served by access to 
green financing. This will involve seeking to allocate public 
funding and crowd in private-sector funding in pursuit of 
green growth as well as institutional capacity. An import-
ant part of capacity would involve the ability to assess the 
value of sustainable benefits as well as a monitoring, re-
porting, and verification methodology. 

291. The human-elephant conflict exemplifies envi-
ronmental sustainability challenges. Protected areas 
are of insufficient size and quality to sustain the country ’s 
elephant population as evidenced by data showing that 
over two-thirds of the wild elephant population can be 
found outside the protected area system. Wild elephants 
are compelled to graze on agricultural lands to survive, re-
sulting in a vicious spiral of conflict with agriculturalists. 
This has reached alarming proportions in many parts of 
the dry zone in Sri Lanka, with around 70 humans and over 
200 elephants killed annually due to the conflict. With in-
creased development and the inevitable erosion of habi-
tats, the problem is set to worsen unless immediate reme-
dial action is taken.

Annual average 
losses from disasters 
is estimated to be 
USD 380 million

292. 
In addition to imperatives to have growth be 
green, the country will need to manage disaster risks. 
Sri Lanka’s has a disaster 
risk profile characterized by 
high frequency/low severity 
events and a number of sin-
gle large-loss events. Disas-
ter risks are associated with 
several factors, including cli-
mate change discussed be-
low (though impacts cannot be assessed with specificity), 
as well as land usage patterns that lead to greater vulnera-
bility. Annual average disaster loss is estimated to be USD 
380 million, with floods accounting for an annual expected 
loss of USD 240 million. Legislation calls for the establish-
ment of a Disaster Fund as an insurance mechanism, but 
de facto disaster-related expenditure is provided in an ad 
hoc manner through supplementary budget allocations. 
Although the state-owned Sri Lanka Insurance Corpora-
tion is the designated insurer for public assets like infra-
structure, there is very little insurance of private property

(less than 1 percent of residential property is insured), and 
crop insurance is not widespread either.153 The govern-
ment is working to improve relevant data collection and 
develop a national disaster risk financing strategy. It is also 
looking to link with social protection benefit distribution 
programs to provide benefits quickly to deal with disaster 
impacts, though this hinges on overall improvement of 
the social protection system.

Climate Change 

293. The country will be exposed to long-term effects 
of climate change. Model simulations under different sce-
narios indicate a significant past warming trend of about 
0.75°C per century in annual mean temperatures over the 
South Asia region.154 Future temperature projections in-
dicate a steady increase in temperatures across the three 
periods, with anomalies reaching 4°C–5°C for high-emis-
sion scenarios by the 2080s. Warming will be widespread 
throughout the region by end of the 21st century. Spatial 
patterns of rainfall change indicate future increases over 
eastern and northeastern areas. 

294. Low-end estimates show Sri Lanka suffering a 
1.2 percent loss of annual GDP by 2050 due to climate 
change, even if measures are taken to address it.155 Chang-
es of temperature and rainfall variation will directly impact 

153 World Bank, 2014

155 
 Ahmed and Suphachalasai, 2014

many sectors of the economy, including power, transport, 
agriculture and aquaculture, with further impacts on 
health, human settlements, and tourism. Climate change 
will lead to more occurrences of natural disasters, such as 
droughts, floods and landslides, due to extreme weath-
er events.156 Much of the impact will be on agricultural 
yields, with a decline in rice yield of as much as 23 percent 
by 2080 (Table 6.1). Farming districts with heavy reliance 
on primary agriculture, few infrastructural and socioeco-
nomic assets (or low adaptive capacity), and high level of 
exposure to historical hazards are the most vulnerable.157 
The vulnerability of rice crops to droughts is expected to 
increase, especially in the dry and intermediate zones. Tea 
plantations at low and medium elevations are more vul-
nerable to impacts of climate change than those at high 
elevations. Reduction of monthly rainfall by 100 mm could 
reduce productivity by 30–80 kg of tea per hectare.158 
Extended dry spells and excessive cloudiness during the 
wet season can reduce coconut yield, with annual losses 
of US$32 million to US$73 million. However, during a high 
rainfall year, the economy could gain by US$42 million to 
US$87 million due to high coconut yields. Future projec-
tions on coconut yield suggest that production after 2040 
may not be sufficient to cater to local consumption.159

295. Marine and coastal areas are projected to be sim-
ilarly affected. Sri Lanka’s coastal region covers about 23 
percent of the island’s land area.160 It also accommodates 
about 25 percent of the population, and includes a heavy 
concentration of urban areas, tourism infrastructure and 
industries that are vulnerable to the impact of sea level rise 
and increased frequency of storms and the intensification 
of coastal erosion due to climate change (Figure 6.4). The 
impacts on marine and coastal areas have been observed 
in the alteration of ocean circulation, coral reef ecosys-
tems, ocean and estuarine salinity, fisheries and recreation 
and tourism activities. The effects also include dryland and 
wetland losses, which impose both physical and economic 
risks on coastal communities. 

296. Climate change will impact other areas, such as 
availability of water, energy, public health. The avail-
ability of irrigation water is highly vulnerable, especially in 
the dry zone, due to the increase in droughts and the high 
dependence of agriculture. Vulnerability of drinking water 
to drought is also widespread. The South/South Central, 
North Western, and North Central regions of the country 
are particularly vulnerable. Drinking water vulnerability to 
floods is prevalent in many areas of the country. Such ar-
eas have limited access to piped water and rely heavily on 
groundwater, resulting in high incidence of water-borne 
diseases.161 Second, hydropower generation will be im-
pacted over time. Annual average rainfall has decreased 
over the last 57 years at about 7 mm per year, resulting 

in water scarcities in the dry zone.162 Third, climate and 
anomalous weather events are expected to cause a gen-
eral increase in the number of cases of both vector- and 
water-borne diseases. The region’s mortality rate – influ-
enced by dengue, malaria and diarrhea – would increase 
over time as a consequence of climate change. Morbidity 
and deaths from such diseases could increase in the future 
under all scenarios.163

D. Priorities on Sustainability

297. Sustaining peace and security through sustained 
reconciliation among Sri Lanka’s heterogenous com-
munities is a sine qua non for progress towards the twin 
goals. Closure regarding difficult chapters in Sri Lanka’s 
past is needed to forestall the possibility of new tensions 
emerging. Governments at all levels will need to maintain 
focus on overcoming issues among the country ’s ethnic 
communities that have fueled past violence. This will likely 
include sustained implementation of mechanisms to ad-
dress these issues, including domestic mechanisms for as-
sessing accountability as well as following through on the 
many LLRC recommendations. It also calls for consistent 
consideration of promoting inclusion and reconciliation 
across all public programs. 

298. Sustaining momentum to carry through with 
institutional and political reforms will be needed to

ensure government effectiveness and stability. At the 
time of writing this SCD, the new institutional framework 
embodied in the 19th Amendment has not yet been imple-
mented. Electoral reforms have not yet been finalized and 
legislation regarding right to information and the audit 
function are awaiting consideration in Parliament. August 
2015 general elections have led to the formation of a new 
government, which is now setting policies for the coming 
years. There will need to be sustained commitment by 
Sri Lanka’s political leaders to carrying through with the 
new model, overcoming any transitional issues that may 
emerge, and providing for smooth operation of govern-
ment. 

299. A heavier emphasis on direct investment and 
long-term private-sector flows will be needed to sus-
tain Sri Lanka’s external fiscal position. Past reliance 
on remittances and external borrowing to maintain the 
country ’s balance of payments will become harder to sus-
tain. Remittances are likely to remain at comparable levels 
while there is limited scope for continued borrowing, since 
it will be at commercial rates and the country ’s low rev-
enue-to-debt ratios. FDI is important for competitiveness 
but also to help with balance of payments. 

300. Long-term sustainability concerns related to an 
aging population need to be addressed sooner rather 
than later. Having passed its demographic peak, Sri Lanka 
faces an urgency to get rich before it gets old. In addition 
to addressing the present acute fiscal challenge, tax reform 
to structurally increase fiscal revenue over the long term is 
needed to create room for increased public expenditure 
on education, health and pensions. Increasing the retire-
ment age in line with increasing life expectancy would also 
help temporarily reverse the decline in the labor force.

301. Sri Lanka will be well served in seeking to en-
sure environmentally sustainable growth and better 
manage disaster risk. This could include soil conserva-
tion efforts, protection of watersheds, and improved solid 
waste management. This will require holistic, long-term 
planning across sectors, coordination among stakehold-
ers, and seeking to allocate public funding and crowd in 
private-sector funding in pursuit of green growth. In ad-
dition, a national disaster risk financing strategy will be 
needed, along with better integration of disaster relief 
with social protection benefit distribution programs.

Identifying a Path Forward 

302. Sri Lanka’s development trajectory has shown 
impressive gains but there are strong indications that 
drivers of past progress are not sustainable. The coun-
try has experienced strong growth and a rapid reduction 
in poverty over the past decade. It has ended a 30-year 
debilitating internal conflict and rapidly addressed many 
of the needs of the conflict-affected population. It has just 
gone through a remarkable democratic transition and has 
embarked on far-reaching institutional reforms to provide 
for greater effectiveness and probity of government. Its 
human development outcomes remain impressive, even 
if continued improvement is becoming more challeng-
ing. However, the country ’s inward-looking growth model 
based on non-tradable sectors and domestic demand am-
plified by public investment cannot be expected to lead to 
sustained inclusive growth going forward. 

303. The systematic diagnostic set out in this re-
port points to fiscal, competitiveness, and inclusion 
challenges as well as governance and sustainability 
cross-cutting challenges as priority areas of focus for 
sustaining progress in ending poverty and promoting 
shared prosperity. These overarching challenges were 
identified through the SCD’s systematic “leave-no-stone-
unturned” review of the many possible factors that con-
strain or drive progress on the twin goals (Box 7.1). The 
identified challenges represent an aggregate of discrete 
constraints identified by the analysis, filtered by five crite-
ria: the potential impact on twin goals, the time horizon for 
this impact, strength of the evidence base, complementar-
ities, and whether addressing the constraint is a precon-
dition for dealing with other constraints. The extent to 
which criteria have been met is derived from observation 
of where Sri Lanka’s current per formance falls below that 
of appropriate comparator countries (mainly in South and 
Southeast Asia) and/or the country ’s own past, and where 
Sri Lankan stakeholders have identified major issues over 
the course of drafting the SCD. The resulting list of areas 
may not be an exhaustive tracking of all of the country ’s 
development challenges, but it sets out what is most sig-
nificant in relation to the twin goals. 

Priority Areas of Focus to End Poverty and 
Promote Shared Prosperity in a Sustainable Way

304. The fiscal challenge is marked above all by con-
straints brought about by poor revenue collection. 
Chronically disappointing revenue per formance and the 
persistently narrow tax base despite growth is a first order 
issue. Continued strong commitment to fiscal sustainabili-
ty urgently requires long-term domestic revenue mobiliza-

tion efforts. This diagnostic identifies a range of tax admin-
istration and policy issues that may be driving low revenue 
per formance, but substantial additional analysis into many 
areas, most notably tax exemptions and enforcement, 
is required. Greater effectiveness and efficiency on the 
expenditure side through improvements in public-sec-
tor management can also help increase fiscal space. Ulti-
mately, more fiscal space is a precondition for addressing 
other constraints. Low revenue has led to a lean and rigid 
budget where low levels of public spending on health, 
education and social protection undercut Sri Lanka’s past 
strong gains in human development and leave it less well 
equipped to face changing human development needs as 
a MIC. This is especially important in light of the need to 
reduce inequality of opportunity and invest in skills to en-
hance competitiveness. Beyond increasing fiscal space for 
these priority projects, there is room to improve efficiency 
of spending on social protection and public-sector person-
nel management that undermines the effectiveness of the 
state. Reducing fragmentation and improving targeting of 
the existing social protection system can ensure that every 
dollar spent on social protection has a maximum impact in 
reducing poverty.164 Similarly, improving controls on pub-
lic-sector remuneration and reducing political influence in 
civil service management could substantially improve the 
efficiency of public-service delivery.

305. The competitiveness challenge involves many 
areas where Sri Lanka can improve performance, with 
improving the skill sets of the labor force emerging as 
a major constraint for growth and good jobs for the 
bottom 40 percent. Sri Lanka’s educational system, par-
ticularly at tertiary levels, is not providing a sufficient vol-
ume of workers of the quality and skills demanded by the 
market. This, in part, reflects low public spending on the 
area, but also points to bottlenecks in expanding the avail-
ability of university slots, and the adequacy and quality of 
the curricula. Efforts in this regard could include steps to 
ensure: high-quality general education and development 
of soft skills; greater private-sector participation in high-
er education, improvements in technical and vocation-
al training; better coordination with potential employer 
needs; and that youth are inclined to pursue degrees in the 
industries where demand is the highest. 

306. Trade policy and a host of land, labor and other 
regulatory barriers further hamper the country’s de-
velopment. It will be important to review and revise the 
country ’s trade-related policies, including the para-tariff 
regime to encourage more foreign trade, simplify the VAT 
and corporate income tax regimes, and reduce or elimi-

Box 7.1 Approach to prioritization

This Systematic Country Diagnostic was compiled in three phases: (i) a comprehensive gathering and review of existing evidence 

of constraints and factors towards progress on ending extreme poverty and promoting shared prosperity (the twin goals); (ii) identification of 
main themes and further research based on knowledge gaps identified in the initial review; and (iii) organizing and prioritizing areas of focus 
for achieving progress towards the twin goals.  

A systematic review of potential opportunities and constraints that could affect the twin goals led to the identification of 

main themes. This SCD is based on a systematic and detailed review of key potential factors impacting progress on the twin goals by using a 
hybrid framework that combines the Hausman, Rodrik and Velasco (2005) growth diagnostics methodology with the Bussolo and Lopez-Calva 
(2014) assets-based framework. The systematic review of Sri Lanka’s performance on the 22 factors identified by this framework led to four 
major themes, which formed the basis for organizing this report: (i) fiscal sustainability and the need to ensure fiscal space for development; 
(ii) fostering growth and jobs for the bottom 40 percent; (iii) ensuring spatial and social inclusion; and (iv) the importance of more effective 
and efficient governance. 
Prioritization was then conducted in two steps. First, throughout the report, prioritization was based on technical factors, including 
comparisons of Sri Lanka to other countries that are similar or aspirational as a means of prioritizing areas. Areas where Sri Lanka demonstrated 
relatively strong performance for an LMIC, such as overall access to infrastructure and basic health outcomes were assessed as having less 
importance as a constraint, but rather reflected opportunities for Sri Lanka to capitalize on in making progress on the twin goals.  These 
opportunities are summarized briefly at the beginning of Chapter IV.  The first six chapters of this volume represent the result of analysis that 
was made against the general criteria of:
• 

The potential impact on ending poverty and on promoting shared prosperity: This assessed its potential impact on ending 

• 

poverty and ensuring a sustainable increase in the welfare of the less well off. The overall impact on achieving the twin goals will 
obviously have the highest weighting.
Complementarities: This refers to the degree to which addressing these constraints would have influence across different domains 
(growth, inequality, sustainability) and/or would magnify the positive impact of addressing other constraints.
Strength of the evidence base behind the impact.  This refers to the extent to which there is a  compelling argument for particular 
reforms, with the stronger cases scoring higher priority.
Time horizon of impacts: This refers to the timeframe under which the impact can be expected to be realized, and would seek to 
balance short- and longer-term impacts.
• Preconditions: These are constraints that need to be addressed to unlock wider potential.

• 

• 

The second step in the prioritization process involved consultations with a broad set of stakeholders after the completion of 

a first working draft.  These consultations validated the analysis and served to assess the relative importance of the diagnosed constraints 
and drivers. Over 120 persons from various spheres participated in consultations.  Discussions at the consultations were complemented by 
surveys to ensure a broad range of inputs.  On the basis of the consultations and completed analysis, prioritization of areas against the criteria 
was finalized. A summary of this prioritization is below; for a fuller treatment, please see Annex 1.4.

nate export taxes (cesses) on agricultural commodities. 
Continued focus on improving trade facilitation and the 
logistics environment, including streamlining licenses 
and permits required to export would help to promote 
export-led growth. Similarly, greater linkages between 
R&D institutions and networks of entrepreneurs can help 
competitiveness and a more outward-oriented economy, 
particularly for agriculture. Moreover, there is need to im-
prove the regulatory environment to allow firms to grow, 
reducing informality and allowing for economy-wide in-
creases in productivity and allowing firms to reach econo-
mies of scale. Some aspects of the regulatory environment 
that appear to be significant obstacles are: upgrading the 
systems for land tenure and land-use planning in both 

agricultural and rural areas; modernizing labor legisla-
tion to encourage easier movement of labor and female 
labor participation; ensuring that the burden to business 
licensing and permits is minimal, particularly in regions 
where this is a problem, such as the North; and providing 
for speedier resolution of commercial disputes and en-
forcement of contracts in court or using alternative-dis-
pute mechanisms. Bringing larger and more profitable 
firms into the formal system and improving enforcement 
could help formalization efforts. The definition of priorities 
for investment climate reforms to unleash firms’ potential 
should stem from regular dialogue between the public 
and private sectors.

Priorities

Rationale

FISCAL

Reform the tax regime and improve tax administration to improve 
revenue performance
Improve the adequacy and effectiveness of spending
Improve the amount of financing and efficiency of social protection

COMPETITIVENESS

Review and revise the country’s trade-related policies 
Provide more resources and quality-enhancing management in the 
education sector to expand skilled workforce and overcome skills 
mismatch
Promote 
innovation by establishing 
linkages between R&D 
institutions and networks of entrepreneurs

INCLUSION

Proper urban management and effective governance of cities to 
address locational concentrations of poverty
Multi-sector 
interventions 
to 
reduce poverty and promote 
employment opportunities in areas with the highest poverty rates 
(North, East, Moneragala, and Estates)
Improve equality of opportunity across ethnic groups, regardless of 
where they reside
Increase labor force participation of women and ensure equal 
opportunity in access to jobs, political and private sector leadership

GOVERNANCE

Improve the regulatory environment to allow firms to grow and 
enhance overall productivity in the economy
Review the regulatory role and participation of the public sector in 
the economy
Improve the efficiency of the public sector

SUSTAINABILITY

Sustain peace and security through long-term reconciliation efforts
Develop a more accountable and effective state
Place heavier emphasis on direct investment and equity portfolio 
flows than debt 
Preserve natural assets and address the impact of climate change
Address the long-term fiscal sustainability concerns related to 
population aging

Fiscal sustainability a key precondition for progress in all areas, 
including macroeconomic stability. Greater fiscal space allows 
for addressing equality of opportunity through increased social 
spending, especially important for inclusion. Efficiency of social 
protection has direct impact on ending poverty. Evidence base is 
strong.

Trade and adoption of new technologies promote diversification, 
external sustainability, and growth, which translates to good 
jobs. Overcoming skills mismatches contributes to growth and 
participation of the bottom 40 percent, including minorities and 
women. Evidence base is strong for skills and trade policy issues.

Urbanizing areas are associated with growth and absolute majority 
of poor are proximate to these areas. Ensuring continued benefits 
of agglomeration will help progress for the majority of the poor. 
For those living in more remote areas, more targeted interventions 
will be needed to ensure equality of opportunity through improved 
service delivery and greater participation in the labor force. Evidence 
base is very strong.

Governance has cross-cutting impact on all other challenges. In 
particular, labor, land, and other regulation create major distortions 
in the economy. The size of the public sector leads to inefficient 
use of public resources and distorts labor markets. The ability of 
government to carry out core functions depends on effectiveness of 
the public sector. Evidence base is strong.

Peace is sine qua non for continued investment, growth, and 
personal well-being of large segment of the population. Sustaining 
the state’s institutional capability over the long term is integral 
competent facilitation of private-sector-led growth. Macro-economic 
and environmental sustainability are preconditions for continued 
progress as well as capitalizing on the country’s asset base. Evidence 
of associated risks is strong.

307. The role and participation of the public sector 
in the economy poses further competitiveness con-
straints. Stronger management and strategic oversight of 
the SOE sector is important to ensure that state involve-
ment is serving a public purpose, does not create too 
much fiscal risk, and is not crowding out the private sector. 
The state should take steps to ensure that the public ser-
vice is “fit for purpose” to carry out public-sector functions 
and not as a mechanism for job creation. The state can play 
a role that facilitates greater private-sector involvement 
through the establishment of a robust institutional frame-
work for public-private partnerships that would ensure 
public interests and investor concerns are balanced while 
crowding in private-sector investment and skills. Finally, 
measures to address conflict of interest could reduce neg-
ative impacts of the interconnectedness of government 
with specific businesses. These measures together will 
help provide an environment conducive to efficiency- and 
productivity-enhancing FDI, allowing for less emphasis on 
targeted incentives. 

308. The inclusion challenge is two-fold, recognizing 
that absolute numbers of the poor and bottom 40 per-
cent are in urbanizing population centers while rela-
tive concentrations of poverty are in specific, relatively 
remote districts. Forty-three percent of the poor are in 
the districts directly along the Kandy-Colombo-Galle corri-
dor, which has seen significant agglomeration and associ-
ated growth over the past two decades. The challenge will 
be to ensure that the poor and bottom 40 percent are able 
to participate in this growth going forward as a means to 
lift themselves out of poverty. Priority efforts in this re-
spect include proper urban management in addition to 
adequate access to services to ensure the poor living in 
these areas of agglomeration can benefit from economic 
activity in these areas. At the same time, there are “pock-
ets” of high rates of poverty in the North, East, estate sector 
and Moneragala where equality of opportunity in terms 
of access to services and linkages to the labor market are 
lower. Efforts to ensure inclusion of these communities 
could include small works programs aimed at improving 
market accessibility, incentives to promote entrepreneur-
ship among educated youth and direct programs to help 
ex-combatants and female-headed households. In the es-
tates, multi-sector interventions to improve nutrition out-
comes, enhance job opportunities for the youth, and pre-
pare for a growing number of aging workers would help 
in ensuring their inclusion in shared growth. In addition, 
there is need to address land claims in the former conflict 
areas, providing assistance to new and “old” IDPs. The lack 
of increase in female participation in the labor force de-
spite decades of high educational attainment, caused in 
part by labor practices, is a major cross-cutting issue. Ef-
forts to address this could entail both reforms to the legal 

128   |   VII. Conclusions

and regulatory environment, as well reforms of the public 
sector to ensure that the private sector can compete, more 
targeted interventions that could ensure women are able 
and willing to pursue careers that are in line with the de-
mands in the labor market, and fostering greater participa-
tion of women in leadership positions.

Cross-Cutting Challenges

309. The governance challenge manifests itself in 
many ways, which taken together constitute the fun-
damental constraint on progress on the twin goals. 
Governance issues are cross cutting and underlie in many 
important ways the three challenges outlined above. Gov-
ernance is obviously central to the quality and probity of 
public expenditure as well as to the government ’s capaci-
ty to provide for equality of opportunity for the poor and 
bottom 40 percent to improve their welfare. Moreover, the 
quality of governance is integral to addressing corruption 
concerns and sustaining public trust. It is also integral to 
revenue per formance, particularly the effectiveness of tax 
and customs administration. The most prominent manner 
in which governance acts as a constraint is in how the state 
carries out regulatory functions for the economy. Policies 
that orient the economy inward, such as the convoluted 
tax system, restrictive land and labor market regulation, 
and inefficient subsidies -- and the related quality of ad-
ministration thereof -- reflect areas where governance is a 
critical constraint. This burden of government regulation 
has led to a large informal sector, which negatively impacts 
improvements in productivity. Governance weaknesses 
have further led to significant expansion of the public sec-
tor ’s role in the labor market and certain economic sectors. 
This expanded role in the economy contributes little to ef-
fective use of the country ’s resources or productivity gains, 
whether it is interventions in agriculture, multiplying tax 
incentives, or absorbing a significant portion of the labor 
force. Finally, ensuring the provision of key public goods, 
such as infrastructure and public services, is a core func-
tion of government; the extent to which there is inequality 
in access to such goods reflects areas where strengthened 
governance is warranted. The transparency and account-
ability reform agenda of the present leadership is an im-
portant opportunity to strengthen governance, though 
this will be a long-term process. 

310. Sustainability risks should be borne in mind 
while addressing constraints to progress on the twin 
goals. The longer-term risks of security and institutional 
reform, as well as economic and environmental sustain-
ability, will require adequate planning and mitigating poli-
cies sooner rather than later. Above all, the sine qua non for 
progress on all fronts is a sustained focus on overcoming 
grievances that have fed past conflict and, more generally, 

carrying through on good governance reforms is integral 
to providing stability. This will likely include sustained im-
plementation of mechanisms to address these issues, in-
cluding domestic mechanisms for assessing accountability 
as well as following through on the many LLRC recommen-
dations. It also calls for consistent consideration of promot-
ing inclusion and reconciliation across all public programs. 
External sustainability is integral to macroeconomic sta-
bility, and will require structural reforms that allow for in-
creases in FDI and long-term private-sector flows instead 
of external borrowing. Long-term fiscal sustainability giv-
en the aging population will require planning in order to 
meet declining revenues and increasing expenditures due 
to this demographic change. Long-term improvement in 
revenue and increasing the retirement age in line with 
increasing life expectancy would help to avoid major ad-
justment in the future. Finally, Sri Lanka will be well served 
in seeking to ensure environmentally sustainable growth 
and better manage disaster risk. This could include soil 
conservation efforts, protection of watersheds, improved 
solid waste management, and holistic, long-term planning 
to promote green growth. In addition, a national disaster 
risk financing strategy will be needed, along with better in-
tegration of disaster relief with improved social protection 
distribution programs.

311. These challenges are in many cases areas of op-
portunity for the next five years. The constraints iden-
tified in this diagnostic are issues that can realistically be-
gin to be addressed in the coming years through policy 
changes and improvements in capacity. Raising revenues 
is much easier than cutting expenditures, and there is sig-
nificant global experience to draw upon. Trade liberaliza-
tion is possible, as Sri Lanka itself demonstrated in the late 
1970s and 1990s, though this will need to be accompanied 
by regulatory reforms in land and labor markets to ensure 
that the private sector can truly be competitive. Sri Lanka 
has advantages that should make it attractive for FDI; the 
administrative steps to become more attractive have been 
demonstrated by many of its MIC competitors in Southeast 
Asia. More granular understanding of the specific needs of 
the poor and how they can participate in labor markets 
should allow for more efficient use of resources in provid-
ing of infrastructure and services that lead to equality of 
opportunity. There is much that Sri Lanka can realistically 
accomplish that will allow for it to capitalize more fully on 
its location, natural endowments, and human capital. 

Synergies

significant indirect effects for the country as a whole and 
the bottom 40 percent in particular. At a basic level, great-
er fiscal space and efficiency of expenditure will allow gov-
ernment to be more effective. A growing economy can be 
expected to provide jobs for the bottom 40 percent and an 
environment conducive to addressing specific inclusion 
challenges, which, in turn, provides for sustainability. 

313. There are particularly important areas of syner-
gy that provide for progress on inclusion, sustainabil-
ity and growth. For instance, effective governance of cit-
ies will not only be critical for addressing spatial inclusion 
challenges, but could also improve the benefits of urban 
agglomeration and raise the level of overall growth and 
job creation. Good governance in urbanizing areas is also 
important to balance social, environmental, and economic 
equity concerns to allow for Sri Lanka to benefit long term 
from its relatively unharmed natural asset base. Improving 
partnership between the public and private sectors will 
facilitate more private-sector-led growth and can crowd 
in financing of public goods to lessen the fiscal burden 
on the state. Similarly, improving equality of opportunity 
(including addressing land claims) across ethnic groups 
is likely to be crucial for improving social stability and the 
sustainability of peace. Moreover, closing the gender gap 
in labor force participation is not only important in terms 
of social inclusion, but is, in effect, critical in terms of the 
broader challenge of raising competitiveness and ensur-
ing shared prosperity, particularly given an aging popula-
tion will increase the dependency rate. 

314. There is a nexus of issues around providing for 
skills development that meets the needs of Sri Lanka’s 
economy going forward. On the one hand, there are 
important elements of state per formance that need ad-
dressing to improve the population’s skills mix: its ability 
to create more fiscal space to provide quality education 
to the population; the efficiency of resources directed to-
wards human capital development; its ability to listen to 
and partner with the private sector on ensuring that the 
right skills are being provided, both by public and private 
institutions; and the impact that the state has on the la-
bor market given its outsized role as an employer. At the 
same time, investment in skills, particularly with public fi-
nancing, is integral to equipping the bottom 40 percent 
with capacity to get good jobs, a fundamental means of 
boosting shared prosperity. A more skilled labor force in 
turn helps Sri Lanka become more competitive, including 
within global value chains, as well as a more attractive as a 
destination for FDI. 

312. The areas of priority identified above are high-
ly interrelated. Because the constraints go to the core of 
how Sri Lanka’s government and economy function, prog-
ress in reducing these constraints can be expected to have 

315. Addressing the constraints and sustainability 
issues diagnosed in this report will require effective 
leadership. Consultations conducted while preparing 
this diagnostic showed strong consensus around Sri Lan-

ka’s development challenges as they are articulated here-
in. Indeed, with regard to some constraints, reforms or 
government intervention have been initiated to address 
problems such as equality of opportunity in underserved 
areas or improving Sri Lankans’ skill sets. The government 
has articulated further plans to address other constraints 
outlined in this diagnostic. However, enacting reforms and 

carrying through with strong governance to implement 
them will be challenging, as vested interests are likely 
to resist change. While the challenges are clear, effective 
leadership will be needed to address them and put Sri 
Lanka on a path that will revitalize its progress in ending 
poverty and promoting shared prosperity.

APPENDIX 1.2  
POVERTY INDICATORS FOR SRI LANKA

How is Poverty measured?

The official poverty figures in Sri Lanka refer to the share of individuals whose per capita consumption falls below the of-
ficial poverty line. This indicator is usually defined in the literature as headcount index and it is a measure of the incidence 
of poverty. The data used for the analysis are drawn from the Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES), which has 
been collected every three to five years since 1995. The 2012/13 HIES covers all 25 districts for the first time in the history of 
the Sri Lanka household budget survey. 

The consumption aggregate is the sum of the consumption expenditures of all food and nonfood items of each house-
hold. The consumption aggregate is spatially deflated to take into account differences in the cost of living of the different 
districts. To get the per capita consumption, the spatially deflated consumption aggregate is divided by the number of 
household members (excluding the persons who are member of the household but usually live elsewhere in the country or 
abroad). Once per capita household consumption is calculated, it is then compared to the national poverty line, which was 
set to Rs 1,423 in 2002, equivalent to the minimum necessary to consume 2,030 kilocalories per capita per day (using the 
Cost of Basic Needs approach). The poverty line has been subsequently updated using the Colombo Consumer Price Index.

The World Bank uses as extreme poverty line $1.25 a day in 2005 ppp terms, which represents the mean of the poverty lines 
found in the poorest 15 countries ranked by per capita consumption among 88 surveyed countries over the period 1990-
2005 (Ravallion, Chen and Sangraula, 2009). The Sri Lanka national poverty line is about $1.50 a day in 2005 ppp. Other 
commonly used poverty lines for international comparisons across middle-income countries are $2.50 a day and $4 a day 
in 2005 ppp, which correspond to, in turn, Rs 6,058 and Rs 9,692 a day in 2012/13 prices. In addition to the national poverty 
line, The SCD will use the US $1.25, US $2.50 poverty lines.

The poverty gap and severity of poverty 

Although the headcount index is the most widespread measure of poverty, it has a serious shortcoming in that it does not 
take into account the intensity of poverty, i.e. how far from the poverty line the poor are. A measure of poverty that over-
comes this problem is the poverty gap index. The poverty gap index is the average shortfall of the total population from the 
poverty line as a share measured as a percentage of the poverty line itself. The severity of poverty is a measure that puts a 
higher weight on households furthest away from the poverty line. Both of these measures will complement the analysis of 
headcount poverty in the context of the SCD.

What is the consumption cut-off line for the bottom 40 percent? 

Finally, the SCD will focus on the bottom 40 percent to discuss the welfare of the less well-off more broadly. The con-
sumption cut-off line for the bottom 40 percent (the threshold below which the poorest 40 percent of population lays) in 
2012/13 is Rs 6,765, or $ 2.79 a day in 2005 ppp.

Key issues with consumption calculations in Sri Lanka

There are three main concerns about the methodology followed for building the official consumption aggregate. First, the 
consumption aggregate includes some items that are usually excluded, in particular: expenditure on durable goods, rare -
ly incurred expenses (e.g. weddings, funerals, ceremonies, litigations, purchased properties), and expenses on provident 
funds, insurances, payment of debts, money lending and income taxes are typically excluded (see Deaton and Zaidi, 2002). 
Second, to guarantee comparability across surveys, the consumption aggregate should exclude items that were not includ-
ed in previous years’ questionnaires, or those for which the recall period has changed over time. Third, since the survey is 
conducted over a period of 12 months, the use of a temporal price adjustment would be recommended.

METHODOLOGY

This Systematic Country Diagnostic was compiled in three phases: (i) a comprehensive gathering and review of 
existing evidence of constraints and factors towards progress on ending extreme poverty and promoting shared 
prosperity (the twin goals); (ii) identification of main themes and further research based on knowledge gaps identi-
fied in the initial review; and (iii) organizing and prioritizing areas of focus for achieving progress towards the twin 
goals. A guiding principle was to have broad participation and feedback from the World Bank Group’s Sri Lanka country 
team as well as external experts and stakeholders to ensure completeness of data collection and analysis. Thus, following 
an initial desk review of evidence, a series of brainstorming sessions were held with a broad team of stakeholders. Ultimate-
ly an additional 14 background papers and notes were also either commissioned independently or completed in parallel 
and utilized for the SCD.

A hybrid framework combining the Hausman, Rodrik and Velasco (2005) growth diagnostics methodology with 
the Bussolo and Lopez-Calva (2014) assets-based framework was used to identify a set of possible constraints and 
drivers towards progress on the twin goals. The Hausman, Rodrick and Velasco (2005) growth diagnostic is a top-down 
approach based on a simplified growth model that identifies for several potential distortions.165 In order to focus on the 
ability of the bottom 40 percent to latch on to the growth process, this top-down approach was combined with the princi-

165 
 Following Dixit (2007) we do not use the framework as a decision tree, but rather as a way to organize and discipline the analysis by identifying the 
range of possible constraints and drivers.

ples of the Bussolo and Lopez-Calva assets framework. The Bussolo/Lopez-Calva framework postulates that the incomes of 
the bottom 40 percent depend on the level of assets – human, physical, financial, social and natural capital – that people 
own and accumulate, the intensity with which they are used, and the returns associated to those assets. The method aims 
to consider the constraints as well as facilitating factors to asset accumulation and their use. These have a direct impact 
on the income generation capacity of all households in an economy, but particularly on the poor and those belonging to 
the bottom 40 percent of the income distribution. The framework in Figure A1 thus places shared prosperity as the desired 
goal, which in turn depends on economic growth and the ability of the bottom 40 percent to benefit from growth. The 
framework provides a breakdown of the range of possible factors contributing or constraining achievement of this out-
come.

The returns to economic activity depend on the availability of assets and the returns to those assets. Assets include 
human, social, natural and physical capital, with a focus on the bottom 40 percent. Human capital includes health, edu-
cation and nutrition (Figure A1). While “social capital” refers to a specific concept and attendant literature, in fact issues of 
social inclusion are central to acquiring and using assets. Social inclusion is defined as “improving the terms of individuals 
and groups, disadvantaged on the basis of their identity, to take part in society”.166 This can be achieved by improving the 
ability, opportunity, and dignity of such people, who are disadvantaged, inter alia, on the basis of their gender, age, disabil-
ity status, caste, ethnicity, marital status or sexual orientation. Natural capital refers to access to land, a clean environment, 
and natural resources such as forests and fisheries. Physical capital refers to access to basic infrastructure, including roads, 
ports, electricity, water, and sanitation. It is also important to note that that there is a strong non-monetary dimension to 
“shared prosperity”. That is, the growth impact of health, education, social inclusion and natural capital may not be very

large, but their impact on “well-being” may be huge.167 Health, education, social inclusion and the environment matter for 
their intrinsic value, not just for their instrumental value to boost growth.

The returns to economic activity also depend on the returns to those assets, which in turn depend on government 
performance and performance of the market. Government per formance is reflected in its ability to (i) maintain macro-
economic stability ; (ii) ensure the effective provision of public goods and services; (iii) provide a regulatory environment 
that provides a level playing field that facilitates economic activity ; and (iv) mitigate individual risks through a social pro-
tection system and addressing systemic risks. Market per formance depends on whether there are barriers to competition 
in domestic markets as well as export competitiveness of the economy as a whole, the ability to innovate, and whether 
there are distortions in markets that constrain growth of the bottom 40 percent. Special attention was paid to the labor and 
agricultural markets given their effects on the bottom 40 percent. Each of these potential constraints or areas of strength 
was considered, evaluating the relative strength of each as a threat to future efforts to end poverty and ensure shared 
prosperity. 

Access to finance depends on the availability of domestic savings and access to international finance. It also depends on 
whether there are bottlenecks in local finance with respect to high cost of finance, high risk (or poor risk management), 
insufficient competition, issues with banking intermediation, or lack of financial literacy.

The framework provides a means to “leave no stone unturned” while also unbundling interrelated issues, which in 
turn allows for greater specificity as well as comprehensiveness.  Many of the possible constraints or drivers are inter-
related or cross cutting. This is particularly the case with government per formance. For instance, the government ’s ability 
to finance (or attract private-sector financing) and organize the delivery of public goods and services has a direct impact 
on the quality and quantity of assets held by the poor, and its per formance as a regulator affects markets and the cost of 
finance. For the purposes of this SCD, per formance of government was reviewed in terms of core government functionality 
and capacity whereas its specific impacts in areas such as improving human capital were addressed in those respective 
sections. Similarly, social inclusion concerns are cross cutting. They are, however, distinct in their core interest in individuals 
and groups disadvantaged on the basis of their distinguishing features and how their ability, opportunity and dignity to 
own, accumulate and use assets and generate returns from them can be improved. 

Identification of main themes and prioritization 

Prioritization was conducted in two steps.  First, analysis of technical issues and outputs/outcomes among possible 
constraints or, conversely, strong per formance along each of the 22 dimensions identified in the framework pointed to 
the relative importance of a given issue. Where possible, this analysis was complemented by comparisons of Sri Lanka to 
its past per formance as well as to other countries that have similarities and/or are aspirational for the country, primarily 
in South and Southeast Asia. While differences in Sri Lanka’s per formance compared to others did not necessarily mean 
the presence of a constraint, in cases where the country was an outlier often did indicate areas of relative weakness. This 
process led to the identification of four main themes in the context of wide consultation, both within the Bank as well as 
through brainstorming sessions with multiple stakeholders in Sri Lanka.

 ■

 ■

The information and analysis gathered were then weighed against five criteria:
The potential impact on ending poverty and on promoting shared prosperity: This assessed its potential impact on 
ending poverty and ensuring a sustainable increase in the welfare of the less well off. The overall impact on achieving 
the twin goals will obviously have the highest weighting.
Complementarities: This refers to the degree to which addressing these constraints would have influence across dif-
ferent domains (growth, inequality, sustainability) and/or would magnify the positive impact of addressing other con-
straints.
Strength of the evidence base behind the impact. This refers to the extent to which there is a compelling argument for 
particular reforms, with the stronger cases scoring higher priority.
Time horizon of impacts: This refers to the timeframe under which the impact can be expected to be realized, and 

 ■

 ■

 Becker, 1964, 2007

144  

would seek to balance short and longer-term impacts.
Preconditions: This would identify constraints that need to be addressed in order to unlock wider potential.

 ■

The second step in the prioritization process involved consultations with a broad set of stakeholders after the com-
pletion of a first working draft. The team carried out several rounds of consultations among focal points representing 
global practices, cross-cutting solutions areas, and IFC operations regarding the draft of the analysis and solicited input on 
priorities, based on the above criteria. External consultations on the analysis in the text and to identify priorities were held 
with a broad range of stakeholders in government ministries and departments, think tanks, other civil society groups, rep-
resentatives of the private sector, and development partners. Consultations were held in Colombo and in Jaffna to capture 
a broader range of views. The consultations both helped to validate the analysis in the SCD and to help assess the relative 
importance of the diagnosed constraints and drivers. 

On the basis of feedback from all consultations, the team substantiated priorities against the five criteria. The final-
ization of priorities against criteria is articulated in the tables below. 

Matrix of Identified Priorities

1. FISCAL

Key Priorities in Fiscal

Reforming the tax regime and improving tax 
administration to improve revenue performance

Improve the adequacy and 
effectiveness of spending

Improve the amount of financing and 
efficiency of social protection

IMPACT ON TWIN 
GOALS

TIME HORIZON

Ensures fiscal sustainability, and therefore macroeconomic 
stability, a precondition for poverty reduction.
Reduces the risk of undercutting, and increases the ability 
to increase, investment in human development. 

More rational public spending will allow 
for greater resources to be directed at 
improving human capital and enhance 
and spending on social welfare needs, 
thereby reducing poverty.

An increase in the amount of funding 
and better targeting of existing social 
protection can ensure maximum impact in 
reducing poverty for relatively low levels 
of financing. 

Medium-term

Short to Medium-term
Short-term: Reforming tax regime, including rationalizing 
exemptions and streamlining tax policy, could improve 
revenue more quickly
Medium-term: Reforms to tax administration and 
expanding the tax base would strengthen tax collection and 
help sustainable revenue generation in the medium-term.

Short-term
An even modest increase in the amount 
of financing and better social protection 
targeting will reduce poverty among the 
most vulnerable.

COMPLEMENTARITIES

Reforming tax regime and administration could improve 
business climate and enhance competitiveness.

Frees up fiscal space to enhance spending 
on human capital investments.

Improved social protection will allow for 
greater participation of the poor in the 
economy 

EVIDENCED-BASED

2. COMPETITIVENESS

Key Priorities on 
Competitiveness

Review and revise the country’s trade-related 
policies 

Provide more resources and quality-
enhancing management in the education 
sector to expand skilled workforce

Promote innovation by establishing linkages 
between R&D institutions and networks of 
entrepreneurs

IMPACT ON TWIN 
GOALS

Greater trade openness would enable export 
growth and diversification of the economy, 
thereby generating more and better jobs and 
promoting shared growth.

Improving the skills of the labor force can 
improve opportunities for the bottom 40 
percent, particularly among youth, to access 
good jobs in industries that will grow in a 
competitive economy. 

By enhancing firm-level efficiency and 
competitiveness, innovation can create jobs 
in industries that will grow in a competitive 
economy. Agricultural innovation can particularly 
benefit the poor.

TIME HORIZON

Medium-term

Medium-to long-term
Medium-term: Expanding vocational training 
and matching skills with industry needs can 
address the skills shortage in the medium-term
Long-term: Reforms to education management 
and expanding tertiary education will foster 
a more competitive workforce with long-term 
impacts.

Medium- to –long-term
Medium-term: Connecting entrepreneur 
networks to existing R&D facilities will benefit 
competitiveness in the medium-term
Long-term: A sustained increase in R&D 
spending and promoting innovation will have 
longer-term competitiveness impacts

COMPLEMENT
-ARITIES

A more outward-oriented trade policy can 
amplify the gains from rebalancing towards a 
stronger private sector role in the economy, and 
enhance overall economic growth.

A skilled labor force can enhance 
competitiveness and efficiency of firms, 
promoting overall growth. It will also be 
important complement to greater trade 
openness and promoting exports.

Greater innovation among firms will amplify 
gains from trade openness, in promoting 
competitiveness in exports and economic 
diversification.

EVIDENCED-BASED

Very strong.

Very strong.

Evidenced by the stagnant economic and export 
diversification alongside the recent slide towards 
inward-looking policies. 

As evidenced by the substantial number of firms 
reporting lack of skilled labour as a constraint.

R&D and innovation lag well behind 
comparator economies, and is influencing 
the visible stagnation of export and economic 
diversification.

3. INCLUSION

Key Priorities in Inclusion 

Proper urban management 
and effective governance of 
cities to address locational 
concentrations of poverty

Multi-sector interventions to 
reduce poverty and promote 
employment opportunities in 
the North, East, Moneragala, and 
estates

Improve equality of 
opportunity across ethnic 
groups, regardless of where 
they reside

IMPACT ON TWIN GOALS

As most of the poor and bottom 40 
percent are located within multi-
city agglomeration areas, proper 
urban management and adequate 
access to services will be important 
for the poor living in these areas to 
benefit from agglomeration.

Improving job opportunities 
and better access to markets and 
services would reduce poverty 
and promote shared prosperity 
in isolated regions. In the estates, 
improving nutrition outcomes, 
better job opportunities for the 
youth, and preparing for an aging 
population will ensure inclusion.

Improving economic 
opportunities for ethnic 
minorities, as well addressing 
post-conflict issues related to 
land, IDPs, war widows and 
ex-combatants, would reduce 
poverty and foster inclusion, 
towards more shared growth.

Increasing labor force 
participation of women and 
ensuring equal opportunity 
in accessing jobs as well as 
political and private sector 
leadership positions

Enables women to access 
better jobs and improve overall 
inclusion of women in the 
economy.

Strong. 

Substantial evidence on the 
location concentration of poverty 
around urban agglomerations, as

competitiveness of these provinces.

Very strong.

Substantial evidence on high 
poverty and exclusion in the North, 
East, Moneragala and estates, 
across multiple indicators.

Medium-term: Reforming labor 
laws that disincentivize female 
participation can have short-
term positive impacts
Long-term: Impacts of better 
alignment of the education 
women pursue and the 
demands of the market would 
be seen in the longer-term.

Given an aging population, 
greater female labor force 
participation would be 
important to increase overall 
growth.

Strong.

Short-term: Addressing pressing 
issues, such as access to 
basic services in post-conflict 
communities can have short-term 
impacts on poverty reduction
Medium-term: Impacts from 
improving job opportunities 
for ethnic minorities will be 
seen over a more medium-term 
horizon.

Improving job and income 
opportunities among ethnic 
minorities would ensure social 
sustainability.

Moderate.

in the economy

Providing a more conducive business climate 
with business-friendly regulatory systems would 
allow formal firms to grow and reduce informality, 
thereby creating more and better jobs.
Land management could allow for better use 
of agricultural lands, and greater certainty over 
property rights could induce greater investment 
and job creation.

Review the regulatory role and participation 
of the public sector in the economy

Improve the efficiency of the public sector

Reducing the distortionary impact of the state’s 
role in the economy can ensure private sector is 
not crowded out and can grow, generating more 
and better jobs for the bottom 40 percent. 

Improving controls on public sector 
remuneration and reducing political influence 
in public service management could improve 
service delivery, with particular impacts on 
lagging regions.

Key Priorities on 
Sustainability

Sustaining peace and

IMPACT ON TWIN 
GOALS

As a country with a 
history of violent conflict, 
long-term reconciliation 
among the country’s 
ethnic communities, and 
preventing new fissures 
along religious lines from 
emerging, are essentially 
for creating a climate of 
inclusivity and promoting 
shared prosperity. 

Governance reforms that 
improve accountability 
to citizen’s can improve 
efficacy of state programs 
in meeting the twin 
goals. Recent governance 
reforms must be seen 
as a beginning in a 
wider effort to improve 
effectiveness and 
accountability of the 
state.

Placing heavier emphasis 
on direct investment and 
equity portfolio flows 
than debt 

Preserve natural assets 
and address the impact of 
climate change

Addressing long-term fiscal 
sustainability concerns 
related to population aging

Reliance on debt to finance 
growth constrains the 
available public finances 
to meet social needs and 
tackle extreme poverty as 
more money is utilized on 
debt repayment. Attracting 
FDI will contribute to growth 
of the private sector and 
create jobs for the bottom 
40 percent.

Tackling environmental 
challenges will reduce 
vulnerability of communities 
at most risk of droughts, 
sea level rise, crop loss and 
agricultural land degradation, 
water pollution, landslides 
due to deforestation, etc. 
Environmental management 
will also influence poverty in 
urban areas.

Without a robust and well-
financed pension scheme, 
Sri Lanka would leave older 
populations in poorer groups 
more vulnerable. Lack of 
fiscal space to support 
healthcare and elderly 
care needs would also hurt 
inclusion and reverse gains 
made on reducing poverty.

Sri Lanka has taken significant strides in recent years to upgrade the amount and accessibility of infrastructure. 
Whereas South Asian comparators continue to have infrastructure gaps that profoundly limit access for large segments of 
the population, Sri Lanka has a solid infrastructure base (Figures A3 and A4). Going forward, the main issues for Sri Lanka’s 
infrastructure development lie primarily in terms of efficiency of operations and maintenance and the lack of an effective 
framework for soliciting private investment or more generally setting up public-private partnerships. Infrastructure has 
largely been financed by the budget, with the exception of some independent power generation plants and telecommu-
nications networks. Access issues according to 2012/13 HIES data are concentrated in conflict-affected areas in the North, 
though there has been visible improvement in that region. The government has invested over 220 billion rupees, or about 
4.4 percent of its total expenditures (outside of interest payments) in infrastructure in the Northern Province alone over the 
past five years (Ministry of Finance 2014).

Nearly all households have regular access to electricity and power supply is expected to keep pace with an annual 
increase in demand of close to 10 percent, though this increase will need to be balanced to minimize environmental 
impacts. Thanks in part to increased private-sector participation, there have been strong gains in recent years in reliability 
and accessibility of electricity (Figure A5). Recently added capacity has yielded a 94 percent electrification rate according 
to the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB). HIES data for 2012/13 shows 96.6 percent of the population in general (94.2 percent 
for the bottom 40 percent) had access to electricity, with post-conflict areas of Mullaitivu (58.3 percent) and Kilinochchi 
(40.3 percent). as the major outliers (Figure 29). Of greater issue is the cost of electricity, which appears to be driving the 
identification of power as a constraint as per the last enterprise survey in 2011, though recent tariff reductions of 25 percent 
have eased this burden. Costs are driven mostly by fuel imports for thermal generation. System losses have gone down 
from over 20 percent in 2000 to roughly 12 percent in 2011 (World Bank 2013). Notwithstanding this record, there is scope 
for improving efficiency in the power sector through optimizing dispatch from generation plants into the grid. Thanks to 
tariff reforms and a write-down of liabilities, the state-run CEB turned a net profit in 2013. Future demand for energy is 
expected to be met almost entirely from coal-fired plants with a reduction in the use of fuel oil and hydropower staying 
level at around 4000 GWh per year and renewable sources modestly increasing from their current levels (Figure 30). How-

ever, there is substantial potential and political 
willingness to develop the renewable energy 
sector through significant public and private 
investments with the aim to source a large 
share of the country ’s future energy demand 
from renewable sources, focusing on wind, hy-
dro and pumps-storage.

Figure A4 Assessment of overall infrastructure by firms

Transport infrastructure has also been en-
hanced in recent years. Roads now account 
for 95 percent of passenger travel and 98 
percent of freight transport. Sri Lanka has a 
high density of roads providing for good acces-
sibility to the population. Expanded efforts to 
devote more resources to rehabilitation have 
improved the condition of the overall network, 
though maintenance remains a primary con-
cern.  Increasing congestion in urban areas is a 
growing issue owing to an expected doubling 
in modal share of private vehicles from 2010 to 
2030 coupled with limitations on available road 
space as well as poor condition of public transport. Sri Lanka has built expressways connecting the Southern and Western 
Provinces and has plans to build an expressway network connecting the rest of the island. Capital expenditure on roads has 
been financed through foreign borrowing (over half of which is from the Chinese Government) and government resources; 
private financing is expected to be sought for construction of the Northern Expressway. The major issues facing the roads 
sector are deferring maintenance in a tight budget environment, contracting issues, and attracting private-sector financ-
ing. A 2013 report found in a sample of road rehabilitation contracts variations resulting in cost elevation from 38 percent 
to 53 percent and contract time extensions from the initial period up to completion from 7.5 percent to 180 percent (World 
Bank 2013). In addition, there are multiple cases of contracting without competitive selection, often owing to financing 
conditions from external lenders.

Port capacity has been increased substantially in the 
past five years. The expansion of the Colombo port in-
creased capacity by 50 percent, including a recently com-
pleted new terminal under a build-operate-transfer ar-
rangement and the construction of a deep draft port in 
Hambanthota. Colombo is currently the 27th busiest port 
in the world, handling about one-third as many containers 
as Dubai and one-sixth as many containers as Singapore in 
2013 (Containerization International Yearbook 2013).

Sri Lanka has had rapid growth in telecommunications 
infrastructure, making it a leader in the South Asia in 
Internet use and broadband take-up. At the same time, 
Sri Lanka still lags behind many MIC competitors in use of 
ICT. Internet penetration stands at nearly 22 percent, the 
highest among large SAR countries, but lower than MIC 
competitors in Southeast Asia, such as Thailand or Vietnam. 
Similarly, mobile telephony penetration rate is 95.5 percent, 
which is higher than the rest of larger SAR countries, but 
lower than other MICs or the Asia Pacific region as a whole, 
which is 120.3 percent (Figure A8). Third-generation (3G) 
services as a percentage of the entire mobile market is 4.4 percent compared to 41.2 percent in the Asia Pacific region. The 
mobile telephony market has five major companies of which two are dominant. Competition has led to some of the lowest 
data and voice rates in the world. However, the dynamics in Sri Lanka’s market are such that there is limited incentive for 
players to invest in increased broadband services in rural areas and new services, which in turn may delay the introduction 
of new, innovative services in the sector. Despite concerns regarding broadband quality and cost, IT-enabled services and 
the software industry have grown rapidly in recent years, now accounting for $500 million in export receipts and around 
70,000 employed. Despite this success, there remains a workforce deficit in the ICT industry.

Figure A8 Mobile telephony and internet penetration

While sector liberalization has supported 
the expansion of mobile services across 
the country, there are areas where ICT pol-
icy and regulation could be strengthened. 
These areas include enforcing stronger com-
pliance to high-quality standards for voice 
services and data speeds, encouraging faster 
broadband roll out in rural areas, and regulat-
ing equal and open access to essential facilities 
such as submarine landing stations and back-
bone networks. Sri Lanka is also one of the few 
countries in the region that has not leveraged 
telecommunications infrastructure rollout by 
other utility providers such as the power trans-
mission, railways and roads authorities. An in-
frastructure sharing policy would help expand 
broadband services across the country, lower 
costs of service provision and provide for do-
mestic network redundancies.

Sri Lanka overall outperforms its South 
Asian comparators in providing for water 
and sanitation, but there is substantial dif-
ferences within the country between urban, rural, and estate sectors. As shown in Figure 26, Sri Lanka has slightly 
better indicators than South Asian peers and is comparable to LMICs in East Asia. Pipe borne water supply coverage stands 
at 44 percent (2013, National Water Supply Drainage Board (NWSDB)) nationally ; of which 34 percent is managed by the 
NWSDB and the rest are mainly community managed Rural Water Supply (RWS) schemes or schemes managed by the local 
authorities. The technical capacity for the operation and maintenance of an estimated 40 percent of the over 4,000 RWS 
schemes in the country remains low, prompting the government to establish a new National Community Water Supply De-
partment in the past year. Approximately 75 percent of the urban population has access to pipe borne water while around 
20 percent of the rural population has such access. The quality of service is also lower for communities in small towns and 
rural areas, where continuous 24-hour supply is a rarity. The water and sanitation service levels in the plantations (estate 
sector) remain far below the national average, with only sporadic investments having been made in these areas over the 
past few decades. Yet overall access to safe drinking water, which includes protected wells, is high and reported to be 85 
percent of the total population (NWSDB 2013) and 94 percent according to WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme 
(JMP) figures of 2012 for water and sanitation released in 2014. Similarly, the NWSDB estimates that 85.7 percent of the 
population has access to adequate sanitation; with 83.2 percent having onsite sanitation and 2.5 percent a piped system. 
The 2012/13 HIES data point to lower levels of access to water (62.2 percent of all households and 55.2 percent of the bot-
tom 40 percent) and sanitation (47 percent of the overall population and 36.2 percent of the bottom 40 percent having a 
toilet on premises), with much lower levels of access in the Northern districts of Kilinochchi, Mulaitivuu, and Vavuniya. The 
discrepancy is due in large part to the HIES not accounting for protected wells and RWS as access to water.

APPENDIX 2.2  
OPPORTUNITIES AND OBSTACLES IN ACCESS TO FINANCE

Opportunities

Commercial banks 
have limited 
ability and to serve 
MSMEs.

Obstacles
 ■ Financial innovation among commercial banks (which dominate the financial sector in Sri Lanka) has been 
limited, with lending practices based on collateral and limited interest in development of other credit processes 
such as cash-flow-based lending and financial instruments beyond loans. Anecdotal evidence suggests that lack 
of competition (in spite of a large number of banks in the sector) has reduced incentives for innovation to target 
underserved economic segments.
 ■ Despite the high penetration of regulated financial institutions in Sri Lanka, an estimated 64 percent of micro, 
small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) remain without checking or savings accounts (World Bank, 2014e), 
highlighting the need for both higher bank penetration, as well as opportunities for complementary non-bank 
financial institutions to target underserved market segments.

Credit infrastructure 
deficiencies limit 
the ability of 
lenders to identify 
creditworthy 
borrowers.

 ■ Credit bureau covers 44.5 percent of the population, and 30 percent of registered firms1. However important 
sources of information on creditworthiness, such as payment history with microfinance institutions and utilities, 
are not included in the information.
 ■ Movable collateral registries do not exist in Sri Lanka. This severely curtails the ability of firms and entrepreneurs 
to use non-real estate assets (eg. vehicles, machinery, inventory, accounts receivable) as security to their loans. 
This, together with the bank practices based on collateralization lead to major de-facto obstacles to borrowers, 
especially smaller ones, which account for 93 percent2 of the enterprise sector.

Legal framework 
deficiencies 
enhance lenders’ 
risk aversion, 
increase cost of 
credit and reduce 
availability of 
finance.

Limited 
development 
of financial 
instruments 
beyond traditional 
bank loans leaves 
important sectors 
and financial 
services needs 
underserved.

 ■ Banks experience significant difficulties in case of borrowers’ default. Despite the existence of a separate 
Commercial Court, resolution of legal disputes takes on average 44 months, creates costs of more than 20 
percent of the disputed value and requires more than 40 individual steps. Moreover, anecdotal evidence 
suggests significant discretion in the application of laws resulting in unpredictability of judiciary processes. 
These deficiencies enhance banks’ risk aversion, which limits incentives to expand the borrower base, and 
fosters increasing collateralization requirements. The high cost of disputes resolution is passed on to borrowers 
as a higher cost of credit.
 ■ The existing Secured Transactions law in the country does not support the operationalization of the collateral 
registry in an enforceable manner. 

 ■ Factoring can enhance the ability of MSMEs to obtain financing for working capital by leveraging their otherwise 
idle accounts receivable. However, shortcomings in secured transactions framework hamper the viability of 
factoring as a financial product. 
 ■ Operational leasing of equipment (an alternative to longer-term bank loans) has been hampered by deficiencies 
in secured transactions (see above) and the lack of a well-functioning movable collateral registry.
 ■ Microfinance Institutions (MFIs) can be an important source of financing for micro entrepreneurs, especially in 
rural areas. However, the lack of regulation and supervision of the MFI sector has led to a proliferation of lenders 
(estimated at more than 1,000) with anecdotal evidence of abuses on pricing and loan recovery practices. The 
lack of regulation of deposit-taking MFIs also creates significant risks for savers. 
 ■ Insurance is significantly underdeveloped for an economy with the income and aspirations of Sri Lanka, leaving 
enterprises and individuals vulnerable to unforeseen events. Less than less than 15 percent of SMEs and less 
than 1 percent of micro enterprises used any form of insurance. Personal insurance premiums account for 1.22 
percent of GDP, well below the proportion in India, Malaysia and Thailand (4.10 percent, 4.92 percent and 4.07 
percent, respectively). 

154  

Lack of consumer 
protection, 
financial literacy, 
and business 
development 
services expose 
the population to 
significant risks.

Lack of financial 
innovation around 
remittances 
restricts their 
potential 
mobilization for 
investment.

 ■ Lack of a well-defined consumer protection framework (including appointment and empowerment of an agency 
in charge of its enforcement) leave users of financial services unprotected against unfair practices by lenders. 
 ■ Lack of financial literacy initiatives and business development services, especially targeting micro entrepreneurs 
and low-income individuals in urban and rural areas enhance the risk of over-indebtedness. 

 ■ Remittances represented about 10 percent of GDP and 86 percent of reserves in 20143. But Sri Lanka has not 
leveraged fully the potential of remittances due to factors including:
 - High cost of formal channels with an average fee for remittances of more than 10 percent of the principal. 
This discourages the use of formal channels in favor of informal mechanisms, thereby limiting the flow and 
permanency within the financial sector.
 - Use of innovative cross-border money-transfer technologies through mobile phone platforms has not 
been developed in Sri Lanka, while it has proved a way to enhance accessibility and affordability of formal 
remittance channels in other countries in the region
 - Financial Innovation leveraging remittances flows has not taken place in Sri Lanka, while in other countries 
this has led to investment instruments linked to remittances including housing and larger investments 
(diaspora bonds).
