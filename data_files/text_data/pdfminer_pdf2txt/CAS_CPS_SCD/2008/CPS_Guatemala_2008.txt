EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

1. 
Guatemala has made significant headway in consolidating democratic institutions 
and laying the foundations fo r broad-based growth, but challenges remain. In just ove r a 
decade since the coun t ry signed the 1996 Peace Accords end ing a 36-year c i v i l war, democratic 
c i v i l i a n r u l e has been consolidated and p u b l i c ins t i tu t ions strengthened. Impo r tan t re fo rms have 
been undertaken in the areas o f governance and transparency, im p r o v i n g education and health, as 
w e l l as expanding access t o fo re ign markets under reg iona l trade agreements, i n c l u d i n g D R - 
C A F T A . These achievements, among others, have con t r ibu ted t o accelerating g r ow t h and l ow e r 
ove ra l l pove r ty rates, w h i c h recent measurements have shown t o have dec l ined f r o m 56 t o 5 1 
percent between 2000 and 2006. Nonetheless, pove r ty and inequa l i ty rema in high and soc ia l 
indicators in health, nu t r i t ion , and education are l o w compared t o s im i la r income countries. 
Ex t reme pove r ty has rema ined rough ly unchanged, w i t h i t s highest concentration in r u r a l and 
indigenous areas. C r im e and v io lence are also recognized as serious p rob lems w i t h high 
economic and social costs and n ew challenges have arisen, pa r t icu la r ly high f o o d and o i l prices, 
the s lowdown o f the g loba l economy, w h i c h have tempered economic ac t iv i ty and income 
g r ow t h among the poor. 
The administration o f A lva ro Colom took office in January 2008 committing to 
increase growth and address high poverty and 
inequality. The veh ic le 
f o r 
the 
administration’s p rog ram i s an ambitious p lan that calls f o r inc lus ive broad-based g r ow t h 
through im p r o v i n g p roduc t iv i ty and investment and greater social spending f o r the poorest. The 
p rog ram also supports expanding f isca l resources t o fund p r i o r i t y spending and investment, 
deepening governance and transparency reforms, strengthening na tu ra l disaster management, and 
enhancing linkages t o the Cen t ra l Ame r ican ma rke t in the context o f greater trade openness. 
The Bank was an active pa r tne r over FY05 to 08 supporting k e y macroeconomic and 
governance benchmarks 
th rough 
three Deve lopmen t P o l i c y Loans and complementary 
investment operations. 
Inves tmen t 
lend ing supported education, competitiveness, 
r u r a l 
development, j u d i c i a l re fo rm , and f inanc ia l management, and ana ly t ica l and sector w o r k fostered 
strong coun t ry dialogue t o address e v o l v i n g challenges. T h e p rog ram de l ive red mos t o f i t s 
expected results and p roved re levan t t o Guatemala’s needs. No tab le progress was achieved in 
im p r o v i n g transparency and p u b l i c f inanc ia l management (PFM) as w e l l as in tax administration, 
but less than expected progress was seen in jus t ice re fo rm . Targets in human development and 
inc lus ion were me t and progress in competitiveness was s ign i f ican t . 
This Country Partnership Strategy (FY09-FY12) builds on p r io r advances and aims 
to provide Guatemala w i th demand-driven and focused assistance for key development 
goals. The p rog ram includes lend ing and f l e x i b l e ana ly t ica l and capacity building assistance t o 
support the coun t ry in select areas that re f lec t the Bank ’s compa ra t ive advantage. B a n k 
assistance w i l l focus o n three o f the country’s development p r io r i t ies : (i) Enhancing 
Fundamentals (ma in ta in ing macroeconomic stability, expanding 
f isca l space f o r p r i o r i t y 
spending, and im p r o v i n g governance and transparency); (ii) Promoting Sustainable Growth and 
Productivity ( imp rov ing the inves tmen t climate, r u r a l development and p roduc t iv i ty , sustainable 
energy, and disaster risk management), and (iii) Expanding Opportunities (enhancing 
opportunities for vulnerable groups th rough im p r o v i n g access to, and use of, social programs). 
These p r io r i t ies address the coun t ry ’s c r i t i c a l development challenges and are based o n w i d e

Total lending assistance under the CPS may reach US$1.42 billion, of which 
US$350-450 million could be channeled through IFC activities. The proposed W o r l d B a n k 
p rog ram includes a m ix o f Deve lopmen t P o l i c y Lending (DPLs), a na tu ra l disaster catastrophic

The risks associated with implementation o f the CPS are moderate. T h e mos t

I. INTRODUCTION 

1. With a multiethnic population o f about 13 million and a per-capita GN I o f 
US$2,610, Guatemala i s the largest economy in Central America. A l t h o u g h a source 
o f cu l tu ra l strength and r i c h h is to r ica l heritage, Guatemala’s ethnic d ive rs i ty has been 
accompanied by con f l ic t and exc lus ion since co lon ia l times. In the la t te r h a l f o f the 20th 
century, long-standing soc io -po l i t ica l and economic tensions sparked a deb i l i ta t ing 36- 
year c i v i l war, w h i c h ended in 1996 after p ro t rac ted negotiations l e d t o the signing o f a 
set o f Peace Accords between the Gove rnmen t and gue r r i l la leaders. 
2. 
Guatemala has made considerable development progress since the signing of 
the Peace Accords in 1996. Pa r t icu la r ly , imp rovemen ts have been made in conso l ida t ing 
peace and building democratic ins t i tu t ions : c i v i l i a n r u l e has been consolidated and 
m i l i t a r y powe r sharply curtailed. The process o f conso l ida t ing democratic ins t i tu t ions 
was strengthened mos t recen t ly w i t h the peace fu l t rans i t ion t o the n ew Gove rnmen t o f

the l a c k

building strategic alliances pa r t icu la r ly relevant. Building a b road consensus i s impo r tan t 
f o r the successful imp lemen ta t ion o f i t s amb i t ious development p l a n t o p romo te inc lus ive 
g r ow t h and reduce pove r ty and inequa l i ty . 
3. 
Despite progress on democratic consolidation, poverty and inequality remain 
high and social indicators (health, nutrition, education) are low compared to 
countries o f similar income levels. Pove r ty declined f r o m 56 t o 5 1 percent be tween 
2000 and 2006, but extreme pove r ty rema ined r o u g h l y unchanged at about 15 percent. 
Ex t reme pove r ty i s h ighe r in r u r a l and indigenous areas, where ch ron ic ch i ldhood 
ma lnu t r i t ion runs as high as 69 percent. 
4. 
The Colom Administration i s committed to making growth more inclusive 
and to addressing high poverty and inequality. The Government i s p lac ing a pa r t icu la r 
emphasis o n governance, transparency, and social cohesion by im p r o v i n g basic services 
f o r the poor, i n c l u d i n g in education, healthcare, and nu t r i t ion . T h i s strategy has been 
applauded in Guatemala as i t attempts t o address deep pockets o f poverty, pa r t icu la r ly in 
r u r a l areas, where recent h ighe r economic g r ow t h has n o t made s ign i f ican t inroads. 
C r im e and v io lence are also recognized as serious economic and social p rob lems and n ew 
challenges have arisen, pa r t icu la r ly high f o o d and o i l prices and the s lowdown o f the 
g loba l economy, w h i c h have tempered economic ac t iv i ty and income g r ow t h among the 
poo r . The C o l o m adm in is t ra t ion i s s t r i v i n g t o address immed ia te and s t ruc tu ra l 
challenges t o increasing g r ow t h and reduc ing pove r ty and has requested B a n k support f o r 
k e y areas o f the coun t ry program. 
The Guatemala-World Bank Group Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) 
was prepared in close consultation with the Government and a broad spectrum o f 
country stakeholders, and emphasizes flexibility and results. T h e CPS p rov ides

11. COUNTRY CONTEXT, RECENT D E V E L O PM E N T S , AND OUTLOOK 

A . Poverty and Inequality 

6. 
Largely due to Guatemala’s historical legacy, poverty and inequality are 
high and social indicators (health, nutrition, education) a re low compared to 
countries o f similar income. A c c o r d i n g t o the 2007 UNDP H um a n Deve lopmen t 
Report, Guatemala ranks among the b o t t om fou r pos i t ions in L a t i n Ame r ica , a long w i t h 
Bo l iv ia , H a i t i , and Guyana, in the ove ra l l human development index , i n c l u d i n g in fan t 
mo r ta l i ty , maternal mo r ta l i ty , adult i l l i te racy , and net secondary enrollment. Guatemala 
also ranks l o w o n social ind ica to rs w i t h i n Cen t ra l America, acco rd ing t o the W o r l d B a n k 
Deve lopmen t Ind ica to rs (see Tab le 1). Though social ind ica to rs rema in l ow , some 
improvements were made in recent years, pa r t icu la r ly in the ove ra l l pove r ty rate.

7. 
There were impo r tan t differences in poverty outcomes b y region and socio- 
economic groups in recent years. T h e 2008 W o r l d B a n k Guatemala Pove r ty 
Assessment indicates that ove ra l l pove r ty f e l l f r o m 56 t o 5 1 percent between 2000 and 
2006, o r 0.85 po in ts per year, w h i l e extreme pove r ty remained nea r ly unchanged at 
slightly above 15 percent (see B o x 1). M u c h o f the decrease in moderate pove r ty has 
been due t o economic g r ow t h and the increase in wage remittances, pa r t icu la r ly f r o m the 
U n i t e d States, w h i c h in recent years rose t o over 12 percent o f GDP. Reg iona l ly , the 
starkest difference i s between the Northeast, where extreme pove r ty rose by 11 percent, 
and the Southeast, where extreme pove r ty f e l l by six percent. Reg iona l differences in 
labo r p roduc t iv i ty , a func t ion o f infrastructure, education, and other factors, as w e l l as 
c l ima te cond i t ions he lp exp la in m u c h o f these differences in pove r ty outcomes. Pove r ty 

2 

and inequa l i ty rema in concentrated in r u r a l areas (70 percent pove r ty rate) and among 
indigenous groups (56 percent pove r ty rate). T h e pace o f improvements in social 
indicators in r u r a l areas has been slower than progress coun t ry -w ide . 

Box 1. Findings o f the 2008 Guatemala Poverty Assessment 

The 2008 Guatemala Poverty Assessment analyzes in detail changes in poverty that have taken place in 
Guatemala between 2000 and 2006. This analysis i s made possible b y t h e availability o f comparable 
household surveys for these two years-representing 
the first time comparable data sets on poverty have 
been available. Wh i le s t i l l high compared to rates in most o f Latin America, poverty d id drop slightly. 
This improvement was achieved despite relatively modest growth in per capita GDP o f two percentage 
points over the six year period and the impact o f hurricane Stan in 2005. Dramatic increases in 
rem i t tances , which reached even f am i l i e s in t h e lower quintiles, contributed to the improvement in poverty 
levels. 

The Poverty Assessment finds that Guatemala’s strong performance in delivering services over the past six 
years suggests that further progress can be made to improve what are s t i l l low levels o f social indicators. 
However, advances w i l l probably require more resources to maintain the same pace o f improvement. The 
Poverty Assessment outlines additional areas where a concerted effort could be made to address stubbornly 
high pockets o f extreme poverty. A conditional cash transfer program could be an effective instrument in 
t h i s context. Ensuring that the positive effects o f poverty reduction policies extend more widely to 
indigenous groups and all regions i s an important priority. 

8. 
Indigenous people suffer f rom the highest poverty rates and have the lowest 
social indicators. Acco rd ing t o the 2006 L iv ing Standards Measurement S tudy 
(ENCOV I ) , the inc idence o f pove r ty f o r indigenous households i s around 56 percent, 
s ign i f ican t ly h ighe r than the non-indigenous ra te o f 44 percent. T h e gap in hea l th and 
n u t r i t i o n i s even mo re worrisome. Ch ron ic m a l n u t r i t i o n i s about 69.5 percent f o r 
indigenous ch i ld ren compared t o 35.7 percent f o r non-indigenous children. There are also 
differences among various 
indigenous groups. F o r example, 
the Gm’funas and 
Sakapultekos have about s ix years o f schooling, w h i l e the Chuj and the Ch ’o r t i ’ have less 
than t w o years. 
9. 
Indigenous women face particular constraints. T h e 6 2 percent i l l i te racy rate 
f o r indigenous w om e n i s ex t reme ly high compared t o 2 4 percent f o r non-indigenous 
women, and 43 percent f o r indigenous men. There i s also evidence that indigenous 
women are disadvantaged in the labo r market; the i r labo r ma rke t pa r t ic ipa t ion rate i s 
almost h a l f that o f m e n (Le., 35 percent f o r indigenous women versus 67 percent f o r 
indigenous men). W h e n indigenous women d o pa r t ic ipa te in the labo r force the i r salaries 
tend t o be 53 percent less than the i r indigenous ma le counterparts, even accounting f o r 
educational backg round and j o b ac t iv i ty . 
10. 
Though much remains to be done to improve social indicators for a l l groups, 
Guatemala has shown gains. Recent advances, even i f small, suggest that the 
Government has been able t o im p r o v e outcomes. The Gini coe f f ic ien t dropped slightly 
f r o m 0.48 in 2000 t o 0.45 in 2006. M a n y soc ia l ind ica to rs experienced impo r tan t 
improvements. F o r example, p r im a r y en ro l lmen t rates rose f r o m 79.9 t o 86.4 percent and 
in fan t m o r t a l i t y rates declined f r o m 39 t o 30.6 percent. T h e 2008 Pove r ty Assessment 

3 

benchmarked these rates o f change to historical rates o f change fo r a l l countries globally 
over the l a s t 25 years, and Guatemala's performance compares very favorably. M a n y 
improvements in Guatemala were better than 80 percent o f a l l the advances recorded. 

11. Poverty reduction programs are constrained by budget rigidities and low 

social spending as percentage o f GDP. About 88 percent o f the budget i s earmarked b y 
law, and social expenditure as a share o f GDP i s relatively l o w (six percent in 2007) 
compared to the rest o f Latin America.

A 2006 government assessment of progress on the Millennium Development 
Goals (MDGs), undertaken with support of the IDB and the United Nations, shows 
steady progress on all goals except for extreme poverty and HIV/AIDS. The 

assessment concluded that to reach most o f the 2015 goals Guatemala needs to grow 
faster and in a more inclusive and sustainable way. Under the best economic g row th 
scenario, which implies an average growth rate o f 5 percent combined w i t h additional 
social and redistribution policies costing an estimated 0.6 percent o f GDP, the goals on 
poverty, hunger, gender and in fan t mo r ta l i ty cou ld be met. However, reaching literacy 
and maternal mo r ta l i ty goals wou ld remain a challenge. Under a more conservative 
scenario that assumes an average economic g row th rate o f three percent and policies 
costing 1.1 percent o f GDP, on ly the poverty goal could be achieved. The Bank's C E M 
indicates that the economy needs to grow at about 5 percent (2.4 percent per capita) 
annually to achieve MDG targets. Re ly ing exclusively on growth to cut poverty by ha l f 
b y 2015 wou ld require an average annual per capita growth rate o f 2.4 percent, a goal that 
Guatemala has infrequently achieved.

B. Economic Context, Recent Economic Developments, and G row th Outlook. 

B . l G row th and Stability 

13. 
Though Guatemala has coped with h igh poverty and inequality, economic 
growth has been relatively stable compared to the rest o f L a t i n America. Since 
1960, average pe r capita rea l GDP g r ow t h in Guatemala has averaged about 1.4 percent, 
nea r ly the same as L a t i n Ame r ica ’s ra te as a whole, but the country’s g r ow t h v o l a t i l i t y 
was less than h a l f the reg iona l average.’ M u c h o f Guatemala’s re la t ive s tab i l i ty can be 
attributed t o prudent macroeconomic po l ic ies that have kep t i n f l a t i o n and p u b l i c debt 
manageable, w h i l e avo id ing f isca l imbalances that plagued m u c h o f the reg ion . 
14. 
Sound macroeconomic management has allowed Guatemala to capitalize on 
favorable external conditions in recent years. Desp i te Guatemala’s suscep t ib i l i ty t o 
na tu ra l disasters (e.g. Hu r r icane Stan in 2005), f inanc ia l ma rke t v o l a t i l i t y (e.g., 
the 
successful reso lu t ion o f t w o comme rc ia l banks in 2006-2007), and terms o f trade shocks 
(e.g., the coffee c r is is in 2003-2004), the economy g rew 4.2 percent o n average f r o m 
2004 t o 2007, reaching 5.7 percent in 2007, i t s highest g r ow t h in three decades. Re fo rms 
t o imp rove the investment c l ima te and reduce interest rates con t r ibu ted t o accelerating 
p r iva te consump t ion and investment. O n the external front, high i n f l ow s o f wage 
remittances and favorable ex te rna l cond i t ions helped create strong demand 
f o r 
Guatemala’s exports and a stable balance o f payments. 
15. 
To accelerate broad-based growth, Guatemala w i l l need to improve the 
investment climate fo r business, increase educational attainment and make progress 
on the governance, transparency and security. A challenge in mee t ing these goals w i l l 
b e t o expand f isca l space t o support p r i o r i t y p u b l i c investment and social spending. 
Since the 1996 Peace Accords, Guatemala’s target has been t o raise tax revenues t o 13.2 
percent o f GDP.2 Desp i te s ign i f ican t improvements in tax administration, i n c l u d i n g the 
passage o f an A n t i -T a x Evas ion L a w in 2006, p o l i t i c a l oppos i t ion and un favo rab le 
cons t i tu t iona l cou r t rulings o n taxes have k e p t tax collections as a share o f GDP re la t ive ly 
f la t and be low the Peace Acco rds target.3 Guatemala’s light tax burden, w h i c h at slightly 
over 12 percent i s among the lowes t in the region, does n o t p rov ide su f f ic ien t f isca l space 
t o address social needs. 

B.2 Investment Climate, T rade and Finance 

16. 
Since 2003, Guatemala has achieved substantial progress in improving its 
investment climate. A c c o r d i n g t o the Bank ’s 2008 Doing Business Report, w h i l e 
Guatemala s t i l l ranks l o w in the business c l ima te indicators (1 14* ou t o f 178 countries, 
o n par w i t h Costa R ica ) i t has im p r o v e d since 2006 when i t ranked 128”. In 2006 and 
2007, Guatemala was among the top reformers w o r l dw i d e in Doing Business indicators, 

Vo la t i l i ty measured b y the coefficient o f variation o f annual r e a l GDP growth. 
12% using GDP base year 1958. 
One major result o f the Anti-Evasion L aw has been the significant reduction on V A T tax evasion f rom 
34.4% in 2004 to 26.1% in 2007, below t h e L A C average. IMFNB (2008). 

5 

and perceptions o f the business environment have improved substantially. N ew free trade 
agreements have been, or are being, negotiated, inc lud ing DR -CAFTA , wh ich became 
effective in 2006. FDI increased more than threefold since 2004. Guatemala’s sovereign 
risk ratings also improved (i.e., S&P’s, BB w/positive outlook; Fitch, BB+ w/stable 
outlook; and Moody’s, Ba2 w/positive outlook). S t i l l , challenges remain, and the 2008 
Guatemala Investment Climate Assessment highlights corruption, energy supplies and 
crime as the greatest obstacles faced b y business (see B o x 2). 

Box 2. 2008 Guatemala Investment Climate Assessment (ICA) Findings 

The second Investment Climate Assessment for Guatemala was completed in 2008 based on 2007 survey 
data and allows fo r a comparison w i th 2004 data. The survey interviewed more than 500 f i r m s f rom the 
manufacturing, services and construction sectors. 
Since 2003, Guatemala made substantial progress in improv ing i t s business climate, but the re i s room for 
improvement, especially compared to i t s competitors. Firms s t i l l report corruption as the i r number one 
obstacle, but only 61% o f f i r m s did so in 2007 versus 8 1 percent o f f i r m s in 2004. Perceptions o f 
macroeconomic instability, in forma l competition, and access to finance also improved. On ly electricity, 
transport and access to land deteriorated since 2003. In fact, electricity was the second major obstacle in 
2007, while perception o f crime improved substantially ( f rom 80 to 37 percent). However, crime affects 
f i r m s differently depending on the ir size, region o f operation, and exporter status. Small f i r m s suffer the 
most, and Guatemala continues to suffer more f rom crime than comparator countries. As fo r electricity, t h e 
I C A highlights that access to reliable electricity supply has become a major concern for f i r m s . In the last 
three years, the frequency o f power outages has increased, and there have been problems satisfying peak 
demand. 

17. 
In i t i a l indications are that D R - C A F T A and other free trade initiatives have 
helped to boost trade, but extending these benefits to the poor w i l l require a broad- 
based development agenda (See B o x 3). Since DR -C A F T A came i n t o effect, exports 
and imports have grown more rap id ly than in previous years, but i t i s s t i l l too early to 
determine whether these gains can be attributed solely to the free trade agreement or to 
other favorable external demand factors. G loba l experience suggests that the extra g row th 
and poverty reduction that Guatemala extracts f r om i t s free trade initiatives w i l l largely 
depend on the efficiency and competitiveness o f i t s economy. Competitiveness reflects 
many factors, inc lud ing labor force education and f lex ib i l i ty , re l iab i l i ty o f energy 
sources, good transportation linkages w i t h i n the country, po r t facilities, and the capacity 
o f the legal and jud ic ia l system to enforce contracts and facilitate business activity, 
among others. 
18. 
Financial sector legal and regulatory reforms implemented since 2000 have 
improved banks’ solvency and resilience to ma rke t volatility, but lack o f access to 
finance remains a ma jo r issue for the financial sector. Domestic credit to the private 
sector increased f r om around 20 percent o f GDP in 2000 to 30.1 percent in 2007. 
Nevertheless, these figures remain l ow compared to the Central American average (i.e., 
47 percent) and interest rate spreads are also relatively high. The problem i s especially 
serious fo r smaller f i r m s , whose access to credit i s even more restricted. Currently, a 
wide range o f mos t ly non-regulated financial entities service clients that cannot access 
the banking system. In this context, a stronger regulatory and supervisory framework 

6 

wou ld help reduce risk and deepen the development o f the financial system. The 
implementation o f the Movab le Guarantees Law , s imp l i f ied accounting rules and 
governance practices fo r SMEs, a comprehensive credit information system and more 
efficient procedures fo r execution o f collateral wou ld improve access to credit fo r SMEs. 

BOX 3. DR-CAFTA 

The Dominican Republic - Central American Free Trade Agreement (DR-CAFTA) became effective in 
Guatemala on July 1, 2006. More than prov id ing new incentives, DR -CAFTA offered more permanent 
access to t h e US. market compared to that o f the 1993 Caribbean Basin In i t ia t ive (CBI). Under DR - 
CAFTA , tariffs on about 80 percent o f US exports to Central America were eliminated, and t h e res t w i l l be 
phased out over the next decade. U S trade barriers also fe l l , but because most products already entered the 
US market under C B I preferences, the effect o f their removal was modest. 
Though i t i s too early to measure direct trade effects in t e r m s o f productivity, j o b creation, and 
contributions to economic growth, preliminary trade data show an estimated 21 percent increase in exports 
and a 13 percent increase in imports in 2007 compared to 2006. I t i s unclear whether t h i s i s due to t h e 
impact o f the f ree trade agreement, per se, o r general growth in foreign demand and t h e domestic economy. 
In any case, DR -CAFTA has reinforced a longstanding trend o f growing trade w i th the United States and 
intra-regional trade w i th Central America. 
A simulation model developed by the Bank o f Guatemala suggests that 0.62 points was added to t h e GDP 
in 2006 for the twelve months that DR -CAFTA had been in effect. Another important short term impact 
has been a contribution to increased foreign direct investment (FDI), which has been grow ing since 2002. 
Policymakers have h igh expectations fo r DR -CAFTA as a means o f attracting investment and improv ing 
regional economic integration. Again, a Bank o f Guatemala model suggests that without DR -CAFTA , 
foreign direct investment wou ld have been almost 60 percent lower in 2006. 
Though the causes are not clear, investment in various sectors o f t h e economy has shifted. Investors seem 
to be mov ing out o f muquiZus (clothing manufacturing’s share o f new F D I dropped f rom 52.2 percent in 
2005 to 45.6 percent in June o f 2007) and other manufacturing and in to services such as ca l l centers and 
business processing. These changes have labor dislocation effects, w i th implications fo r education, 
technical training, and infrastructure investments. 

B.3 Governance , Transparency , a n d Secur ity 

19. 
Despite government efforts in recent years to imp rove governance and 
strengthen institutions, pub l ic perceptions o f governance r em a i n low . Among W o r l d 

Bank governance indicators, regulatory quality and voice and accountability showed 

some improvement, but the rule of law remains one o f the most important challenges as i t 
falls w e l l below averages fo r Latin America and countries w i t h similar income. In an 
e f fo r t to f igh t impun i ty in the country, in 2007 Congress approved the creation o f the 
International Commission against Impun i ty . T h e Un i ted Nations Secretary appointed i t s 
Commissioner, who has been wo rk ing in close collaboration w i t h the judicial, legislative 
and executive branches, and the UN High Commissioner fo r Human Rights. 
20. 
Gua tema la made steady progress in recent years in transparency . The 
implementation o f the integrated financial management system (SIAF), wh ich was built 
upon a good normative framework and a modem technological platform, contributed to 
efficiency in financial transactions and the production o f timely, transparent in fo rma t ion 
on most government finances. Moreover, Guatemala’s Transparency and A n t i - c om p t i o n 

7 

Agenda i s one o f the Government’s ma in priorities, wh ich i s being l e d by the V ice 
President along w i t h the M in is te r o f Finance, who i s leading efforts on fiscal 
transparency. Guatemala was selected as a C -GAC (Country-Governance and Anti- 
Corruption) p i l o t country, and the Bank i s p rov id ing full support to this Agenda. M a i n C- 
G A C actions include: (i) activities to reduce the risk o f corruption and enhance 
transparency in the CC T program; (ii) assessment o f the “Internal Audit Function” core 
responsibilities o f the executive branch; (iii) support to create the V ice M in is te r o f 
Finance fo r Transparency; and ( iv ) implementation o f SEPA, the Sistema de Ejecucidn de 
Planes de Adquisiciones. C i v i l society organizations and the media are also effectively 
tapping in to pub l ic ly available in fo rma t ion fo r mon i to r ing and social auditing pub l ic 
management. 
21. 
Violence has risen in recent years, with heightened impact on citizens and 
businesses. Crime and violence are now recognized as serious economic and social 
problems w i t h severe economic and social costs. H i g h crime rates, inc lud ing a homicide 
rate which has doubled over six years, directly affect human welfare in the short run, and 
exert long-run effects on economic g row th and social development. C r ime and violence 
drives away private investment, diverts resources f r om productive activities to crime 
prevention, discourages investment in human capital, and disrupts the functioning o f 
pub l ic and private institutions. T h i s , in turn, generates l ow pub l ic confidence in the 
c r im ina l justice system. 
22. Historically, crime reduction efforts have relied heavily on the “criminal 
justice” approach, but there are signs that this i s changing. Recent analytical wo rk 
done b y the W o r l d Bank and others suggest that an improved strategy wou ld be to 
combine reforms to enhance the qua l i ty o f the police and justice systems w i t h targeted 
interventions to reduce and prevent crime. Rigorous scientific evaluations have 
demonstrated that the most effective anti-crime measures target specific risk factors (e.g., 
access to firearms, drugs and alcohol use, and fam i ly violence) and particular types o f 
violence. 
23. 
Crime reduction could be achieved in the short-term by targeting high risk 
groups, but in the medium- and long-run human development strategies are 
indicated. International experience, inc lud ing in BogotB, Cali, Santiago, Sao Paulo, and 
Be lo Horizonte, suggests that one o f the most effective entry points fo r crime and 
violence prevention i s the municipality. Prevention and control responses are also 
complementary, and partnerships between governments and communities are imperative 
to realize gains. 

B.4 Recent Economic Developments and Growth Outlook 

24. After a period of stable and re la t ive low inflation, inflation in Guatemala has 
seen an uptick, driven in large measure by the high prices o f food and oil. Year-on- 
year headline in f la t ion increased f r om 5.3 percent in mid 2007 to 13.6 percent in 
June2008. Perhaps more worrisome, core in f la t ion (excluding food and energy prices) 
has tracked closely headline in f la t ion and increased markedly f r om about 5 percent in 
m i d 2007 to 12.6 percent in June 2008. Survey-based in f la t ion expectations fo r end-2008 

8 

have also been on the rise in recent months. T h i s reversal on the in f la t ion f ron t has been 
mainly driven b y the evolution o f o i l and international food prices ( o i l prices increased b y 
47 percent and food prices rose b y 60 in 2007), and also b y domestic demand pressures 
(credit to the private sector has been increasing at 23 percent over 2006-2007. 
25. 
Food price in f la t ion accelerated f rom slightly below eight percent in mid- 
2007 to 18.9 percent in June 2008. As in other countries, the poor are being hit hard b y 
in f la t ion o f food prices, given that food tends to represent a larger share o f consumption 
among the poor (54 percent for those be low the poverty l i n e and 37 percent in the C P I 
basket). In fact, in June 2008 the effective in f la t ion rate fo r the Guatemalan poor, 
considering a typ ica l ly consumed basket o f goods, was about 1.4 percentage points above 
the o f f ic ia l ly measured in f la t ion rate. The Government i s wo rk ing to address this 
situation through various measures, inc lud ing lowe r impo r t duties and taxes on food, 
accelerated ru ra l development strategies, and increased payments under a new 
conditional cash transfer program, wh ich w i l l pa r t ia l ly mitigate the rise in food and 
transportation prices. 
26. 
Guatemala’s external position remained stable over the past few years. The 
current account de f ic i t stabilized at f ive percent o f GDP, and private capital in f lows and 
remittances permitted the accumulation o f international reserves to a comfortable level: 
about four months o f imports o f goods and services. Fo r 2008, the external deficit i s 
projected to deteriorate to 5 .5 percent o f GDP because o f h igh o i l prices, declining 
thereafter as non -o i l imports moderate and exports and remittances continue growing to 
about 5.1 percent at the end o f the CPS period. 
27. 
Guatemala’s fiscal deficit and public debt to GDP a re among the lowest in 
L a t i n America. F r om 2004 to 2007, the deficit o f the Central Government averaged 1.7 
percent o f GDP, and pub l ic debt o f the non-financial pub l ic sector remained less than 23 
percent o f GDP (o f wh ich about 13 percent i s external debt). T o maintain Guatemala’s 
long-run fiscal sustainability and expand programs to address social needs, fiscal 
resources w i l l need to grow. Fiscal re fo rm i s thus on the agenda to promote prudent fiscal 
management to cover additional planned spending. The proposed re fo rm i s designed to 
cover revenue losses (0.7 percent o f GDP) associated w i t h next year’s expiration o f a 
temporary minimum corporate income tax, and provide fiscal space fo r additional social 
spending (see Annex G). 
28. 
G row th i s slowing to sustainable levels after a robust pace in recent years. 
G row th i s expected to moderate to 4.6 percent in 2008 f r om 5.7 percent in 2007 ow ing to 
sluggish global economic activity, particularly in the Un i ted States, less growth in 
remittance inflows, and h igh food and o i l prices. Expo r t growth slowed to 16.7 percent in 
April 2008 f r om 26.1 percent in April 2007, and g row th in remittances, a major 
component o f income fo r the poor, dropped to 8.6 percent in June 2008 f r om 12.6 percent 
in June 2007. Capital in f lows have also shown s i g n s o f slowing as global financial 
markets have experienced greater vo la t i l i ty . In M a y 2008, the (year on year) index o f 
economic activity rose 4.4percent, w e l l below the 7.2 percent average increase in 2007. 
In f la t ion i s also expected to moderate during 2009, ma in ly f r om stabilization o f food and 
o i l prices and the effects o f a monetary tightening policy, wh ich began in mid-2007. 

9 

The outlook fo r growth over the new CPS period i s broadly positive. 

29. 
Through 2012, real GDP growth i s expected t o average about 4.5 percent, less than the 
rates since 2005, but higher than the rate observed over f r om 2000-2005. G row th i s 
expected to be supported b y a recovery in domestic demand and increased trade and 
foreign investment under DR-CAFTA, other free trade agreements, and enhanced 
regional integration. Domestic and foreign direct investment are expected to rise ow ing 
to greater business confidence, improved transparency and pub l ic sector governance, 
ru ra l p roduc t iv i ty gains, and a rebound in the prices o f traditional and non-traditional 
exports. Economic growth i s projected to exceed population growth b y about tw o 
percent over the medium-term, continuing the trend o f positive per capita income gains 
since 2004.

111. WORLD BANK GROUP-GUATEMALA PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY 

A. Lessons Learned from the P r i o r Country Assistance Strategy (FY 05- FYOS) 

33. 

The CAS was aligned to country needs outlined in the government program 
and to broad national priorities highlighted in the Peace Accords. The C A S 

ma in ta ined con t inu i ty w i t h the p rev ious p rog ram and focused o n eme rg ing p r io r i t ies . I t s 
fou r pillars were: (i) strengthening fundamentals; (ii) p romo t ing social inc lus ion ; (iii) 
equitable and sustainable growth; and ( iv ) environment support. T h e C A S Comp le t ion 
Report provides a detailed assessment o f B a n k performance during FY05-08 (Annex H). 
34. 

Progress was achieved across the program, with the strongest performance 
in improving transparency and public financial management (PFM). T h e B a n k has 

been supporting Guatemala’s e f fo r ts in PFM since 1996. A l l the targets set by the C A S 
Progress report were m e t o r surpassed, and outcomes were strong. T h e recent Pub l ic 
Expend i tu re Rev iew (PER) indicates that enhanced budget management capacity 
con t r ibu ted t o a m o r e e f fec t ive use o f p u b l i c funds. T h e Coun t ry Procurement 
Assessment Report (CPAR ) also showed that greater transparency and compe t i t ion in 

pub l ic procurement resu l ted in f isca l savings f r o m l ow e r prices and better qua l i ty . The 
Coun t ry F inanc ia l Accoun tab i l i ty Assessment (C F A A ) i d e n t i f i e d an increase in the 
capacity o f l o c a l governments t o m o b i l i z e revenues and de l ive r services. 
35. 
Significant progress was made in macroeconomic management and key 
priorities, such as tax administration, but progress was less than desired in justice 
reform. T h e B a n k supported the imp lemen ta t ion o f a 106 -po in t strategic ac t ion p l a n t o 
imp rove tax and customs administration. The imp lemen ta t ion o f the p l a n i s o n target, and 
a L a w against Tax Evas ion and E l u s i o n was passed in 2006. These measures he lped 
authorities reach the i r revenue target o f 12.1 percent o f GDP, but this was s t i l l b e l ow the 
13.2 percent target set by the Peace Accords. The objectives set under the C A S f o r 
j u d i c i a l r e f o rm we re met, but the development impac t o f the related projects was l im i ted . 
T h i s can b e la rge ly a t t r ibu ted t o p ro jec t design and the l a c k o f a precise results 
framework. 
36. 
Targets in human development and inclusion were also met. The DPL ser ies 
supported increasing the share of the budget-and of GDP-allocated 
to social 
expenditure. B a n k assistance focused o n im p r o v i n g the capacity o f sector m in is t r ies t o 
design and imp lemen t social programs. Progress towa rd long - te rm development 
outcomes in education was satisfactory. T h e hea l th and n u t r i t i o n p ro jec t just started 
executing in 2008. T h e C A S also helped t o increase the connec t iv i ty in p o o r regions 
through investments in r u r a l in f ras t ruc tu re services. Howeve r , a m o r e integrated approach 
i s needed t o scale up support, stimulate r u r a l development, and generate mo re 
opportunities. 
37. 
Finally, progress in promoting competitiveness was notable. The Bank ’s 
support f o r imp roved competitiveness built o n the findings o f the Coun t ry Econom ic 
Memo randum (C EM ) and the Investment C l ima te Assessment ( ICA ) , and inc luded 
actions t o support trade, strengthen p rope r ty rights and the f inanc ia l sector, and 
streamline regulations t o fac i l i ta te business. Guatemala’s e f fo r ts and re fo rms were 
recognized b y the 2007 and 2008 D o i n g Business reports, w h i c h p laced the coun t ry 
among the top re fo rme rs wo r ldw ide . 
38. 
The CAS program was implemented as designed and delivered most of the 
intended products. The B a n k m o v e d successfully towa rd p rog ramma t ic lending. The 
DPLs p rov ided p rog ram con t inu i ty and served as an impo r tan t channel f o r dialogue 
between authorities and B a n k o f f ic ia ls . C A S imp lemen ta t ion nea r ly me t a l l o f the 
benchmarks set f o r the high case o f the lend ing envelope. 
39. Despite progress, governance remains a challenge for Guatemala. Weak r u l e 
o f l aw and co r rup t ion have been perceived as the mos t impo r tan t challenges f o r the 
country, w h i l e there i s recogn i t ion that the Government has advanced in im p r o v i n g 
government effectiveness and simplifying regulations t o fac i l i ta te business.

IFC’s p r io r support fo r the private sector (FY05-FY08) 

40. 
Du r ing FYO5-OS, the IFC supported three projects in Guatemala and four 
regional projects that a re benefiting the country. One o f the three committed projects 
was in agribusiness. 
I F C provided a US$20 m i l l i o n loan to the one o f Guatemala’s 
largest sugar m i l l s employing over 18,000 people in ru ra l areas, as part o f a larger credit 
package which included US$50 m i l l i o n to the ho ld ing company’s operations in 
Nicaragua. The second project was in the financial sector. In FY05, I F C provided a 

13 

US $ 3 0 m i l l i o n loan t o a la rge b a n k t o he lp strengthen i t s cap i ta l base and expand

Guatemala C i t y t o support upg rad ing o f ex is t ing dedicated roads, the renova t ion o f o lde r 
buses, and acquisition o f new ones bene f i t ing 150,000 people. 
41. 
One of four regional operations was in the re ta i l sector where IFC provided a 
US$50 m i l l ion loan to one of the largest retailers operating across Cen t ra l America. 
The l o a n i s he lp ing this company expand i t s operations in Guatemala, w h i c h i t considers 
a strategic country. IFC also supported the L a t i n Ame r ican Agribusiness Deve lopmen t 
Corporation’s (LAAD) operations th roughou t the L A C region. T h i s co rpo ra t ion p rov ided 
eight-year loans averaging US$400,000 t o agribusiness SMEs, w i t h about US $ 1 6 m i l l i o n

the reg ion become even mo re integrated. 
42. 
IFC’s total committed portfolio a t the end o f M a y was US$60.5 m i l l ion in 
three sectors: agriculture, in f ras t ruc tu re and f inanc ia l markets. Ove r 50 percent o f IFC ’s

43. 
Advisory services and technical assistance played a key and complementary 
role along with IFC’s investments. 
I F C assisted a mining company that i t had 
p rev ious ly supported th rough a US$45 m i l l i o n loan t o enhance the project’s benefits 
among l o c a l communities. I F C p rov ided techn ica l assistance and funding support f o r a

Sustainable Commun i ty Deve lopmen t Fund. The negotiations resulted in an agreement 
whereby the mining company vo lun ta r i ly fo rwen t an income tax exemp t ion that was 
generally available t o exporters unde r Guatemalan law . Ano the r impo r tan t a c t i v i t y was 
the M u n i c i p a l Scorecard project, whose m a i n goa l was t o mo t iva te mun ic ipa l i t ies t o

Partnership Strategy aims t o p rov ide Guatemala w i t h demand-driven and focused 
assistance t o achieve k e y development goals. T h e shared strategy between Guatemala and 
the W o r l d B a n k G roup includes reduc ing pove r ty and inequa l i ty by expanding 
opportunities f o r the poor, pa r t icu la r ly the mos t vulnerable, v i a sustainable and broad- 
based growth. The proposed CPS w i l l cover f o u r years (i.e., f r o m September 2008 t o 

15 

September 2012) to align the program w i t h Guatemala’s po l i t ica l cycle. A CPS Progress 
Report w i l l be presented to the Board two years in to implementation (FY l l) , and CPS

Guatemala made progress in accelerating growth, expanding opportunities, 
and imp rov ing i ts bus iness climate, but t h e r e rema in deep pockets o f poverty, 
pa r t icu la r ly in indigenous and r u r a l areas, tha t have no t f u l l y tapped in to advances. 
The Government i s thus focusing renewed attention on m i t iga t ing t h i s gap, particularly 
through fiscal re fo rm and a conditional cash transfer program to enhance the funding and 
provision o f needed social services. The CPS w i l l also assist the Government to confront 
key emerging issues, inc lud ing rising c r ime and violence, challenges related to the U S 
and global economic downturn, and increasing food and o i l prices. 

C . l Government Program and Key Pr ior i t ies f o r W o r l d Bank Support 

48. 
The Colom adm in is tra t ion focused i ts efforts on increasing g row th and 
reducing poverty and inequality. The Government p lan i s built on eight fundamental 
principals (p r io r i t iz ing the poo r , gender equality, investing in children, multiculturalism, 
ethics, environmental conservation, citizen participation, and respect fo r human rights) 
, that cut across four development themes: (i) Solidarity; (ii) Governance; (iii) 
Productivity; and (iv) Regionalism. 

16 

Box 5. Government Development Themes 

I. Solidarity 
1. Social Development (includes r u r a l development, education, hea l th and nutr it ion): Generate 

employment, reduce poverty and ensure access to basic infrastructure and services, in keeping 
w i t h t h e Peace Accords Agenda, the Agenda Nacional Compartida (National Shared Agenda) and 
t h e Millennium Development Goals. These objectives are to be reached through an integrated 
approach, which includes among others: actions to increase productivity and generate 
employment, SME development, and increasing the effectiveness o f social spending through a 
targeted CCT program. 
2. Mun i c ip a l Development: Promote democratic principles and processes at the loca l leve l b y 
strengthening the role o f the municipality in development and service provision through measures 
that facilitate citizen participation at the loca l leve l and that increase municipal capacity. 

II. Governance 

1. Security and Ru l e of L aw : Consolidate r u l e o f law and provide citizen security. Strengthen 
constitutional rights, f igh t corruption ( fo r example, b y providing citizens w i t h the means and 
protection needed to denounce corrupt actions), strengthen institutions that provide citizen security 
and the penal system, support violence prevention programs, etc. 
2. Democrat ic Development: Promote the democratic development model b y strengthening the role 
o f the state. Promote a true pluralistic po l i t ica l culture b y strengthening representative democracy 
and supporting the modernization o f the party system, while increasing decentralization o f 
po l i t ica l processes. Promote the rights and development o f indigenous populations. 
3. Legislative Policy: Enhanced legislative processes to provide security and citizen wellbeing. 
Actions under t h i s area include capacity development for Congress, increasing transparency and 
in form ing c i v i l society about legislative activity (especially in the social sphere). 

III. Product iv ity 

1. Economic Development: Deepen and enhance conditions for sustainable economic growth that 
translate in to fair economic development, job creation, higher salaries, and reduced poverty and 
inequality. Policies in this area include tourism and SME development, infrastructure, and 
agricultural modernization. 

2. Risk Management and N a t u r a l Disaster Prevent ion: Mitigate and reduce human losses and 

physical damage originating f r om r i s k s associated w i th natural disasters and, thus, create t h e 
conditions for sustainable development. A step to achieve t h i s objective i s t h e implementation o f 
an effective Natural Disaster M i t iga t ion and Management Strategy. 

IV. Regionalism 

1. Reg iona l Integrat ion: Develop a proactive, creative and autonomous foreign po l icy to position 
Guatemala i n a leadership position w i th in t h e region and promote a jo in t effort in areas o f 
common regional in teres ts such as environment, energy, banking, customs and security. 

So l ida r i ty 

49. 
A key focus o f the government’s first development theme, so l idar ity , includes 
reduc ing poverty a n d inequa l i ty th rough a cond it iona l cash t rans fe r p rog ram . The 
C C T p rog ram targets the mos t vu lne rab le by p r o v i d i n g cash incentives t o p o o r fam i l ies t o 
take advantage o f hea l th and educational opportunities, as w e l l as income t o meet basic 
needs. In M a r c h 2008, the Gove rnmen t launched the p i l o t phase o f the C C T program, Mi 

17 

Familia Progress, in f i v e municipalities, and the p rog ram w i l l be extended t o reach 125 
cities. The p rog ram w i l l de l ive r about Q l 5 0 a m o n t h (Le., $20 U S dollars) t o poo r 
households o n the cond i t ion that the i r ch i ld ren regu la r ly attend school and v i s i t hea l th 
centers. T h e p rog ram i s expected t o cost around US120 m i l l i o n annually. Ensuring 
e f fec t ive implementation, f isca l sustainability and the supply o f related services w i l l be 
i t s m a i n challenges. The Government o f Guatemala requested support f r o m the W o r l d 
B a n k and the IDB o n the C C T program’s design, i n c l u d i n g mechanisms t o enhance 
mon i to r ing , evaluation, and transparency, and support t o he lp address supply side issues 
in coo rd ina t ion w i t h the projects in hea l th and education. 
50. 
To meet priority social spending and investment goals, the Colom 
government i s drafting a fiscal reform program during its first months. The f isca l 
r e f o rm p rog ram i s be ing drafted f o r Congressional approval in the second semester o f 
2008. Recogn iz ing the p o l i t i c a l factors constraining a deep and far-reaching program, 
and the current economic slowdown, authorities are pursuing an impo r tan t but modest 
f isca l re fo rm . The proposed r e f o rm aims t o expand tax co l lec t ions f a i r l y and sustainably 
by easing tax regulation, strengthening controls, b roaden ing the tax base, and increasing 
tax payments. The r e f o rm i s targeted t o p rov ide add i t iona l f isca l resources, o f fse t t ing an 
expected d rop the exp i ra t ion o f the temporary tax o n businesses income (the IETAAP, 
w h i c h was l e v i e d in since 2004). T h e goa l o f the r e f o rm i s t o raise tax co l lec t ions t o 13.2

Governance 

5 1. 
The second development theme, governance, focuses on strengthening 
institutions and enhancing transparency. The Government i s pursuing several related 
activities: a) Congressional approval and imp lemen ta t ion o f a f reedom o f i n f o rm a t i o n act 
t o enhance p u b l i c sector transparency; b) the creation o f a specialized o f f i c e in the 
Ministry o f Finance t o fac i l i ta te access t o f isca l in fo rma t ion , and guarantee transparent 
use o f p u b l i c resources; c) the immed ia te inc lus ion o f special t r u s t funds and extra- 
budgetary resources i n t o the p u b l i c budget; and d) the strengthening o f the Comp t ro l le r 
General o f f i c e t o fac i l i ta te processing o f c i t izen c la ims and allegations o n misuse o f 
pub l ic funds and f raud cases. 
52. Complementing these efforts a re advances on the public financial 
management modernization agenda. Ove r the past decade, w i t h d i rec t support f r o m the 
B a n k and other donors, the Government successfully developed the SIAF and the 
GU A T ECOM PR A S e-procurement po r ta l t o im p r o v e management o f budget and 
accounting processes and heighten transparency in p u b l i c procurement. On the basis o f 
this good track record, the Government i s n ow p lann ing o n advancing b o t h re fo rms by 
developing mo re sophisticated instruments and procedures, and by ins t i tu t iona l iz ing 
advances w i t h i n p u b l i c ins t i tu t ions t o consolidate good practices.

The Colom government supported activities to respond to growing and 
immediate concerns about crime and violence. These ac t iv i t ies include, among others: 
i) inc reas ing the numbe r o f security agents and e l im ina t ing s ta f f unde r suspicion o f 
corrupt o r c r im i n a l acts; ii) building m o r e p o l i c e stations and p r o v i d i n g better equipment 
and techno logy t o security forces; iii) im p r o v i n g the coo rd ina t ion w i t h the Army t o fight 
crime, pa r t icu la r ly drug related crime; i v ) im p r o v i n g the coo rd ina t ion among d i f fe ren t 
players in the Secu r i ty and Justice departments; and v) building mo re and better prisons. 
O n the p reven t ion side, the Government has started an “open schools” p rog ram 
supporting after school activities f o r youth. T h e p rog ram was in i t ia ted in fou r schools in 
poo r neighborhoods o f the capitol, and i t i s expected t o b e expanded t o 10,000 you th at 
risk w i t h i n the first year. 
Guatemala’s strategy also envisions crime prevention activities that are likely 
to yield gains in the medium to long-run. A t t a c k i n g the comp lex i ty o f c r ime and 
violence requires an in teg ra l approach focused n o t o n l y o n im p r o v i n g the qua l i ty o f the 
po l ice and the c r im i n a l jus t ice system, but also o n targeting interventions at high-risk 
groups and communities. A p reven t ive approach focused o n m u n i c i p a l c r ime p reven t ion 
and human development strategies f o r at risk you th aims t o l ow e r the unde r ly ing 
tendency f o r c r im i n a l i t y in the m e d i um t o l o n g run.

The third development theme, productivity, focuses on growth b y stimulating 
domestic and foreign investment, supporting tourism and M S M E s , and enhancing 
opportunities to export goods and services. To foster r u r a l development, 
the 
Government has created a R u r a l Deve lopmen t Counc i l , whose mandate i s t o p romo te 
p roduc t ive projects in the 44 poorest mun ic ipa l i t ies , and execute these projects v i a a 
US$79.8 m i l l i o n budget. The C o u n c i l comprises a techn ica l counc i l and a governmental 
comm iss ion and focuses o n fou r areas: i) p roduc t ion and competitiveness; ii) the 
environment; iii) agrarian po l icy ; and i v ) f o o d security. In agriculture, Guatemala’s Basic 
Grains P rog ram was developed t o h e l p increase p roduc t iv i ty . T h i s p rog ram i s f inanced by 
the A g r i c u l t u r a l Ministry and Banrural, and p rov ides small farmers with land, a Q2500 
loan, a Q800 subsidy f o r fe r t i l ize rs and pesticides, and ma ize seeds suited f o r 
Guatemala’s climate. T h i s p rog ram w i l l cove r 125 mun ic ipa l i t ies in the country, and h e l p 
farmers mos t in need. 
Complementing these initiatives, the Government plans to increase public 
investment in na tu ra l disaster mitigation and response. Guatemala i s highly 
vulnerable t o na tu ra l disasters. Guatemala i s one o f the top f i v e countries in the w o r l d 
most affected by floods, hurricanes and earthquakes, w i t h 40.8 percent o f i t s popu la t ion 
exposed t o f i v e o r mo re threats simultaneously. A b o u t 9 2 percent o f i t s GDP i s at risk

phys ica l structures; and (iii) l im i t e d capacity t o manage na tu ra l disaster r i s k s . Guatemala 
in i t ia ted an integrated approach t o risk management in 2004, when an ins t i tu t iona l

The new Administration’s efforts have focused on furthering reconstruction 
linked to p r io r na tu ra l disasters, and better preparing for emergencies (i.e., 
rehab i l i ta t ing in f ras t ruc tu re in f lood -p rone areas, and evacuating at-risk areas). T h e 
Government also intends t o validate and update the Na t iona l P rog ram f o r Disaster 
M i t i g a t i o n and Response. Finally, the V i c e Presidency i s cu r ren t ly discussing with B a n k

Regionalism

Unde r the last theme, regionalism, the new administration i s p r io r i t iz ing

This CPS emphasizes partnership, flexibility, and results. The process o f 

developing this CPS created a strong partnership between the WBG and the government, 
and deepened relations w i t h the Congress, private sector and c i v i l society. Enhanced 
coordination w i t h the international donor community also contributed to the focus the 
CPS. T h e IBRD and I F C worked closely to iden t i fy areas where they can wo rk together 
to exploit synergies and leverage each other’s investments. Moreover, this CPS provides 
f lex ib i l i ty in lending instruments, financing amounts, and analytical work. T h e strategy

Poverty Assessment update, and an assessment o f country fiduciary systems. The SME 
p roduc t iv i ty research/TA program w i l l focus on integrating and mainstreaming SMEs 
in to value and export chains, and increasing the poor’s access to business (i.e., promote 
social inclusion). K e y emphases include use o f effective knowledge transfer instruments

program comprises the activities requested b y the Government. Fo rma l consultations o f 
the program were he ld in Guatemala on Ju ly 10 and 15 w i t h a wide range o f government 

The SME development program w i l l focus on sectors, and w i l l analyze and design effective articulation 
instruments (both the l igh t and heavy types) and centers for knowledge and service transfer. Programs such 
as exporta fac i l w i l l be employed to promote MSME exports, and activities w i l l focus special attention on 
ensuring availability o f value chains, particularly for small producers. Agribusiness w i l l be a special focus, 
given the need to enhance productivity and food security. 

25 

and non-government organizations. Participants in the consultations were supportive o f 
the priorities and the approach (see Annex C). 
71. Risks. There are f i v e types o f ma jo r risks associated w i t h the proposed program: 
economic, political, crime and violence, natural disaster r i s k s , and programmatic. Fiscal 
sustainability i s relatively robust and entails m in ima l risk. Guatemala has one o f the 
lowest levels o f public debt to GDP in L a t i n America (Le., 22.3 percent in 2007) and a 
l ow and stable fiscal deficit, averaging about 1.5 percent over the last f i v e years. M a i n 
r i s k s include: 
Economic: U.S. and global deceleration, r is ing energy and food prices, slowdown in 
foreign investment and lowe r remittance growth may slow or reverse progress on 

poverty reduction. Mitigation: Ongoing macro-monitoring and country dialogue to adjust 
program if critical risks emerge. Operations (i.e., programmatic DPL series, CCTs, Energy 
Market AAA) are specijically designed to manage and respond to vulnerabilities. 

Political: Po l i t ica l deadlock stalls progress on the reforms supported b y the CPS. In 
particular, reforms to increase tax collections to fund p r io r i ty spending have 
historically been, and continue to be, a contentious po l i t ica l issue . This concern could 
be amplified as growth begins to moderate in the context o f the global economic 

slowdown. M i t iga t ion : The risk is minimized by the Government’s consultative 
approach to reform implementation and the CPS’s fac i l i ta t ion of dialogue among 
country stakeholders. Operations are also being coordinated w i t h budget cycle to 
increase legislative engagement. 

C r ime and violence: C r ime and violence are recognized as serious economic and 
social problems w i t h important economic and social costs. H i g h crime rates, 
inc lud ing a homicide rate that has doubled over six years, directly affect human 
welfare in the near-term, and exert long-run effects on social development and 
economic g row th (by having a negative impact on the investment climate). 

M i t iga t ion : analytical support to help the government improve its ongoing efsorts to 
combat crime and violence. The government is pursuing efsorts to enhance the 
quality of 
its governance and j u d i c i a l systems as we l l as reduce risk factors (such as 
the lack of economic opportunities, drugs, and family violence). 

Na tu ra l Disasters: Guatemala i s h igh ly vulnerable to mu l t ip le natural disaster 
risks-floods, hurricanes and earthquakes-that pose significant threats t o economic 

growth and poverty reduction efforts. M i t iga t ion : The proposed p rog ram supports 
government efsorts to update and validate the National P rog ram fo r Disaster 
M i t iga t ion and Response. The CAT -DDO (FY09) w i l l provide contingent financing, 
accompanied by implementation of comprehensive disaster risk reduction measures. 
I n addition, an FY08 non-lending Technical Assistance program, the Development of 
Scientific Information to Promote the Mun ic ipa l Planning to Reduce Disaster Risks, 
has been taken up by G loba l Fac i l i ty fo r Disaster Reduction and Recovery grants. 

P rog ram Performance: 

T h e new CPS includes fewer projects but proposed 
operations are 
larger, 
integrated, multi-sectoral operations. Multiple country 
counterparts and ministries may slow project execution. On the other hand, the new 
operations are aligned w i t h the government budget cycle, wh ich may speed project 
approval and positively impact disbursement rates. Mitigation: Fewer and more 

selective Bank projects w i l l free management resources f o r 
improved project 
coordination. The M in is t ry of Finance recognizes execution risks and is taking steps 

26 

to facilitate coordination across Ministries. A quality implementation team including 
f iduc ia ry experts, the Country Manager, an Operations O f ice r and a consultant was 
established at Country Ofice. CPPR meetings w i l l be held twice a year and meetings 
w i th the government project coordination units w i l l be held eve ry other month. 
Guidelines f o r both meetings are already in place, and a comprehensive training 
program on procurement and f inanc ia l management and 
individual project 
implementation plans was delivered to a l l project coordination units f rom May 13 to 
16. Other t ra in ing modules w i l l fo l low .

Annex B1.2 Summary o f the Lending Program FY09-12 

Programmatic Fiscal and Institutional Development Policy Loans ( three DPLs totaling US$500 m i l l i o n over FY09, 

FY10, and FY11). These operations wou ld provide a key mechanism to support the Government’s po l icy priorities in 
promoting macroeconomic stability; fiscal reform; governance and transparency; mon i tor ing and evaluation; and the 
po l icy framework fo r growth and productivity. 

Developing Markets for Sustainable Energy, Hydroelectric and Conservation (FYO9, US$65 m i l l i o n f rom I B R D 

(potential IBRDDFC operation). T h i s program w i l l focus on energy generation and distribution, power system 
rehabilitation (including support fo r the regional power trade), demand-side energy efficiency measures, and medium 
term generation options, such as f r om hydro and geothermal sources. This operation may also support an innovative 
p i lo t scheme for energy output and income sharing w i t h rura l and indigenous groups. The I B R D w i l l provide technical 
assistance and business development. I FC has been advancing work on several potential investments that would 
expand the country’s generating capacity w i t h an emphasis on renewable energy. 
Catastrophic Risk Deferred Draw-Down Operation (CAT-DDO, FY09, US $ 8 5 m i l l ion) . The CAT - D D O wou ld 
o f fer Guatemala a rap id source o f funds in the event o f a major natural disaster, enabling a quick response to address 
emergency needs. This would be accompanied by, as discussed earlier, the implementation o f comprehensive disaster 
mitigation measures. 

Expanding Opportunities/CCT and Basic Znfrashcture (FY10, US$200 m i l l ion , and US$20 m i l l i o n for technical 

assistance for institutional support for the CCTPo ten t ia l IFC support for urban transport in Guatemala City). This 
operation w i l l seek to increase effectiveness o f the CCT program b y improv ing institutional and implementation 
arrangements, including monitoring and evaluation mechanisms and t h e supply o f services l inked to the CCT program 
(health, nutrition and education services, as we l l as complementary services that w i l l maximize the impact o f the CCT 
program, such as in water and sanitation, rural roads, electricity, etc). Many o f these activities w i l l support loca l 
initiatives in municipalities through loca l communities. As a fo l low-up to i t s f i r s t sub-sovereign operation in 
Guatemala, IFC may also support a second phase to continue to support the city’s urban transport system, inc lud ing 
t h e construction o f cycle paths along the southwest corridor o f Transmetro, tra f f ic management and lighting 
infrastructure; and resurfacing o f urban roads. 
Enhancing Productivity and Tourism Development (FY11, US $ lOO m i l l i o n f r om I B R D (IBRD/TFC potential 
operation). This en ta i ls a jo in t IFC and IBRD project. IFC would focus on tourism development, while I B R D would 
support j o b creation and increased productivity o f MSMEs through: (i) improved access to business development 
services and productivity-enhancing technologies and production techniques; (ii) improved access to financial 
services; and (iii) an improved environment for rura l investment and improved marketing infrastructure. The program 
would benefit f rom IFC’s Sustainable Value Chain program and would strengthen linkages between producers, 
processors and marketing agents to boost non-traditional exports and food products. 

Over the CPS period, ZFC will continue to support growth and competitiveness through investments in 
energy/infrashcture, access to finance, tourism, agribusiness, manufacturing and value added exports. Guatemala 

w i l l benefit from I FC support both at t h e country and regional levels. IFC w i l l seek opportunities to promote private 
sector development w i th investments and technical assistance in areas where i t has competitive advantages. 
Specifically, IFC w i l l seek to support: (i) country or regional investment opportunities to help strengthen the j n a n c i a l 
sec tor ; this may include support fo r housing finance, bu i ld ing on a donor-funded market study in Guatemala, 
Nicaragua and Honduras, and activities to enhance access to finance among underserved groups; (ii) in coordination 
w i th the Bank, the development o f in fras truc ture and energy pro jec ts to help enhance competitiveness; 
(iii) strengthening the agribusiness sector, particularly in crops where Guatemala has a natural competitive advantage, 
such as sugar and palm o i l , and capacity to develop co-generation facilities and bio-fuels fo r internal consumption and 
export; (iv) investments and technical assistance in sustainable tour ism that focus on Guatemala’s natural advantages, 
r ich cultural history, and eco-tourism; (v) manufacturing and services, w i th a particular emphasis on MSMEs; and 
(v i) t h e health and education sectors, through investments and technical assistance fo r educational institutions and 
hospitals. Given the importance o f MSME capacity bu i ld ing and the investment climate, IFC w i l l also seek to provide 
technical assistance and advisory support to complement, where applicable, t h e Bank’s AAA.

and mayors. T h e B a n k team was l e d by Anabela Ab reu (Coun t ry Manager), and inc luded s ta f f 
f r o m each o f the k e y sectors. 

The workshops were rea l ized together w i t h the Ministry o f Finance and centered o n a Powe r - 
Po in t presentation i l lus t ra t ing the proposed areas o f in te rven t ion and related lend ing and non - 
lend ing ac t iv i t ies in support o f the Government’s p r io r i t ies . F o l l ow i n g the presentation, the 
meetings we re opened f o r discussion and feedback was collected. T h e presence o f b o t h B a n k and 
Government members fac i l i ta ted p roduc t ive and f rank discussions w i t h the stakeholders, and 
enriched the d ia logue as questions and comments were rep l ied t o j o i n t l y . 

T h e f o l l ow i n g i s a summary o f the v iews expressed by stakeholders during the sessions (a l igned 
t o the CPS proposed pillars). The groups we lcomed the mo re focused approach and the 
p r io r i t iza t ion o f action, considered that the CPS addresses the short, m e d i um and l o n g t e rm 
development goals o f coun t ry and fundamen ta l ly agreed with the areas o f engagement selected. 
They encouraged a results o r ien ta t ion and impac t eva lua t ion t o max im ize the e f fec t o f 
interventions. 
Pillar I - Strengthening Fundamentals 
Participants agreed that ins t i tu t ions need strengthening and emphasized the impo r tance o f 
increasing ins t i tu t iona l capacity t o imp rove the effectiveness o f p u b l i c spending. They also no ted 
that th rough Coun t ry Partnership Strategies, the B a n k can p l a y an impo r tan t r o l e in suppo r t ing 
the Government in focus ing i t s attention o n l o n g t e rm policies, as w e l l as immed ia te actions. In 
terms o f governance, participants we lcomed support t o the transparency agenda th rough the CPS 
and the C - G A C and h igh l igh ted the importance o f h a v i n g e f fec t ive instruments t o m o n i t o r p u b l i c 
spending, pa r t icu la r ly in social sectors. F ina l ly , participants men t ioned the need f o r clear and 
predictable laws and regulations t o sustain business development and expressed concern about 
the security situation. 
Pillar I1 - Sustainable Growth and Productivity 
Participants considered r u r a l development a p r i o r i t y t o generate shared economic g r ow t h and 
support in f ras t ruc tu re development and the creation o f a s o l i d base f o r SMEs t o take advantage

They expressed concerns about the impact o f the current unfavorable international context on the 
poor, and drew attention to the need fo r a broad social protection strategy. W h i l e welcoming 
support fo r CCTs, they suggested t h a t there i s considerable room fo r action in this area. 

Recommendations 

Include a broader discussion o f social protection instead 
o f a l im i ted focus on CCTs 

Ensure coordination w i th the IDB 

Greater support for SMEs 

Increase rura l productivity b y l ink ing small farmers to 
large re ta i lers . Small producers w i l l need financial 
assistance as we l l as infrastructure development support 

H o w they are addressed in the CPS 

Dur ing CPS discussions w i t h the government social 
protection issues were touched upon. No areas have been 
selected fo r collaboration, but t h e dialogue i s ongoing. 
The CPS includes a section detailing coordination w i th 
the IDB to maximize impact. Technical teams o f both 
Banks are work ing together on the CCT program. 

SME development i s an important element o f the new 
CPS and the Bank team w i l l meet w i t h stakeholders to 
develop new ideas and partnership areas. 
The existing Rural Development Project includes these 
types o f activities and they can be expanded. Moreover 
the future Enhancing Productivity operation focuses on 
these areas.

Annex G: Fiscal Reform Proposal 

Despite recent improvements in increasing tax collections, Guatemala has no t been able t o reach 
the Peace Accords target o f 13.2 percent o f GDP. However, to continue w i t h the efforts t o reach 
and surpass such a target, a new fiscal modernization re fo rm proposal has been developed by the 
multi-sectoral Facilitator Group for the Fiscal Dialogue (FGFD). 

T h e draft proposal as o f July 2008 includes measures t o provide additional tax revenues and 
contribute to the strengthening o f tax administration as w e l l as to the modernization o f the tax 
legal framework. The main and specific measures included in the proposal are:

11. Background 

3. 
The 1996 Peace Accords continued to be relevant. In December 1996, the Gove rnmen t o f 
Guatemala ended 36 years o f in te rna l c o n f l i c t by signing Peace Acco rds w i t h an active 
insurgency. The talks lead ing up t o this agreement centered o n ma jo r p rob lems a f fec t ing m a n y 
Guatemalans: poverty, i l l i te racy , disease, inequa l i ty , exclusion, and human rights v io la t ions . The 
commitments under the Peace Accords have since d r iven economic and social po l icy , and 
inc lude imp roved de l ive ry o f basic services and governance, focus ing pa r t icu la r ly o n j ~ s t i c e . ~ 
Impo r tan t goals set under the Accords have remained, such as m o b i l i z i n g 13.2 percent o f GDP in 
tax revenues, and a l loca t ing at least s ix percent o f GDP t o social expenditure. T h e in te rna t iona l 
commun i ty was also a strong supporter o f the peace process, and has mon i to red i t s progress. T h e 
U n i t e d Na t ions established a M i s s i o n (MINUGUA) t o m o n i t o r human rights cond i t ions and 
imp lemen ta t ion o f the agreements. MINUGUA closed in 2004 after a decade o f wo rk , and some

7. The Peace Accords themselves were not legally binding and formal approval o f other laws and decrees within 
the institutional framework were required to implement the accords. A 1999 referendum to modify the Constitution 
on certain aspects o f the Accords approved some but not a l l o f the proposals. Some measures, l i k e recognition o f 
traditional dispute resolution mechanisms, were not approved.

functions passed to the Ombudsman’s Office, but the international community i s s t i l l interested 
in the peace process. 
4. 
The incoming Berger administration (2004-2008) faced uneven implementation of 
the 
Peace Accords. Progress after the Peace Accords during the Arzu administration (1996-1999) 
promoted competition, removal o f commodity subsidies, privatization (telecoms and electricity) 
and increases in social spending. The pace slowed during the Po r t i l lo Administration (2000- 
2004.) 
In 2002, MINUGUA reported that despite accomplishments under the Accords, “the 
population does not perceive the benefits o f peace, aside f r om ending o f the armed conflict.”* 
Though the pace o f re fo rm did no t accelerate after 2002, a consensus remained that advancing 
Peace Accords objectives wou ld enhance the legitimacy o f national institutions a t home and 
abroad. 
The Berger administration also faced a d i f lcu l t economic situation. Income per capita 
had declined since 2000 and the macroeconomic situation in 2003 was tenuous. Guatemala was 
just emerging f r om a financial crisis, and the Supreme Court had stricken revenue measures 
intended to buttress the country’s fiscal position. The international community, inc lud ing the 
W o r l d Bank, was concerned about the risk o f fiscal imbalance and particularly, the implications 
fo r sorely-needed increases in social spending. . 
6. 
The Berger administration acted quickly to reverse the situation, taking advantage of 
favorable external conditions. The Berger administration entered o f f ice strongly committed to 
comply w i t h the Peace Accords and confront Guatemala’s macroeconomic and growth 
challenges. T o address fiscal and other concerns, the authorities: a) pushed through a new tax 
package which reinstated in revised f o rm the gross corporate income tax wh ich had been stricken 
b y the court; (b) reduced m i l i ta ry allocations and protected social expenditures; and (c) devised a 
106-point strategic p lan to address revenue challenges. O f f ic ia ls also sharpened their focus on 
governance, particularly to imp rove the transparency o f pub l ic expenditures and punish corrupt 
practices. The Government also took steps to enhance trade (Le., through DR -C A F T A and w i t h 
the EU, Taiwan, and Colombia) and competitiveness and generate faster economic growth, w i t h 
a v iew to provide employment and income opportunities fo r the one o f the fastest growing 
populations in Latin America. The results f r om these and subsequent efforts have been h igh ly 
positive. 

111. Progress towards Long - te rm Strategic Goals du r ing the CAS Period 

7. 
The macroeconomic environment improved between 2004 and 2007. T igh t fiscal controls 
and economic growth maintained to ta l pub l ic sector debt at about 22 percent o f GDP - one o f the 
lowest rates in L a t i n America. 
International reserves he ld steady at about four months o f 
imports. The Government’s track record o f macroeconomic stability, l o w pub l ic and external 
debt, a solid commercial debt repayment history, and resumed economic growth supported 
continued improvement in the rating o f i t s international debt. In the v iew o f the ra t ing agency 
Fitch, these strengths have provided a sufficient bu f fe r to deal w i t h adverse shocks and should

Economic G row th has resumed. Be tween 2004 and 2007, the economy g rew an average 
o f 4.3 percent pe r year. In 2007, the g r ow t h rate was 5.7 percent. The economic recove ry was 
fueled by h ighe r prices f o r co f fee (Guatemala’s m a i n export), expanding exports,” g r ow i n g 
remittances, l1 and h ighe r investment. l2 D R - C A F T A and other in te rna t iona l agreements helped 
expand ma rke t opportunities and imp rove Guatemala’s 
investment climate. l3 Howeve r ,

income declined f r o m 2000 t o 2004, pove r ty reduc t ion during 2000-2006 was l i k e l y d r iven by 
rising incomes and remittances since 2004. Ex t reme pove r ty rema ined at around 15 percent f r o m 
2000 t o 2006. Pove r ty continues t o b e high among r u r a l and non-Spanish speaking populations; 
seventy percent o f r u r a l Guatemalans l i v e b e l ow the pove r ty l i n e and 25 percent l i v e in extreme

Human development indicators improved considerably since 2000. The 2008 Pove r ty 

Guatemala made strides in governance and achieved higher international rankings 

9 . For the f i r s t time, F i tch rated Guatemala BB+ w i t h stable outlook. F i tch rating in 2005 was BB-. In addition, 
Standard Poor‘s upgraded i t s country risk assessment o f Guatemala to BB w i th stable outlook, and Moody changed 
the Government’s Ba2 foreign currency bond rating to positive f rom stable. The Economic In te l l igence Unit rates 
Guatemala as BB, placing Guatemala on par w i t h we l l performing middle-income countries. 
10. Exports grew at 16.2 percent in 2004 and 18.0 percent in 2007. 
11. The International M igra t ion Association estimates that 1.3 m i l l i o n Guatemalans l i v e in t h e United States and 
that 30 percent o f Guatemalans receive remittances f rom a relative in the US . In 2007, the value o f the remittances 
amounted to US$4.1 b i l l ion . These transfers finance a good percentage o f the trade de f ic i t that amounts to US$5.5

IV . Results and Contribution 

CAS Design and Relevance 

The CAS was designed in alignment w i t h the government p rog ram : Vamos Guatemala!. 

A c r i t ica l decision was made to maintain continuity w i t h the previous p rog ram wh i le 

The CAS was amply discussed w i t h the government and stakeholders. T h e B a n k engaged 

12. 
The B a n k organized i t s assistance around the government program’s f o u r p i l la rs : fundamentals 
Igovernance, c i t izen security, and mac ro stability), social solidarity, g r ow t h competitiveness and 
the environment. The government p rog ram in turn addressed the mos t c r i t i c a l p r io r i t ies o f the 
country, m a i n l y de l ive r ing results o n the 1996 Peace Acco rds t o he lp build state leg i t imacy , and 
im p r o v i n g the country’s weak economic competitiveness. B o t h the government p rog ram and the 
C A S were relevant t o the challenges con f ron t ing the coun t ry in 2003 and 2004.16 
13. 
the government and other stakeholders ea r ly in C A S development t o take stock o f ongo ing 
programs and discuss the new strategy. These ea r ly discussions im p r o v e d the C A S design and 
set the basis f o r good implementation. 
14. 
focusing on emerging p r io r i t ies . The C A S inc luded 11 projects” and one F S A L f r o m the 
ex is t ing pipeline, despite s low 
imp lemen ta t ion o f some activities during the p rev ious 
administration, i n c l u d i n g in tax administration, education and competitiveness. T h e C A S 
assumed this risk because the Gove rnmen t rev iewed and considered these projects impo r tan t t o 
i t s p r io r i t ies , and expressed a strong comm i tmen t t o im p r o v e the i r imp lemen ta t ion . Several new 
projects, i n c l u d i n g the proposed DPL series, addressed emerging challenges, pa r t icu la r ly 
concerning competitiveness, f isca l “space,” hea l th and nu t r i t ion , and infrastructure. T h e C A S 
also comm i t ted t o phase ou t Project Imp lemen ta t ion Units (P lus) by execu t ing projects th rough 
government agencies. 
15. 
pe$omzance was robust. The architecture o f the C A S re f lec ted the Bank ’s unce r ta in ty o n the 
l e v e l o f resources i t c o u l d c omm i t g iven p rev ious ly deteriorating performance and relationships 
w i t h authorities. The C A S separated the base case i n t o high and l o w scenarios and set 
benchmarks f o r each. In addition, the C A S inc luded a high case w i t h benchmarks l i n k e d t o t w o 
impo r tan t Peace A c c o r d targets: m o b i l i z a t i o n o f revenues equal t o 13.2 percent o f GDP, and 
expenditure o f 6 percent o f GDP o n social programs. 

The CAS was designed to gradually increase support to Guatemala if 

implementation 

16. The 2002 CAE recommendations were in the same direction: (a) preserve macroeconomic stability; 
(b) improve the efficiency o f public expenditure; (c) invest larger amounts in education, health, electricity and 
sanitation; and (d) improve t h e investment climate w i t h an emphasis on better governance (i.e., r u l e o f law, trade 
liberalization, etc.). 
17. No t a l l projects were continued. Tw o AP L se r ies were limited to t h e f irs t leg: support f o r the Land Fund and 
support for FONPAZ, a social fund.

The f o l l ow i n g sections assess the results de l ive red with W o r l d B a n k support, compare 
these results against i n i t i a l C A S expectations, and attempt t o i d e n t i f y factors that d rove 
performance. The Comp le t ion Repo r t fu r the r assesses the relevance o f the C A S design and,

The objective under the f i r s t p i l l a r was “to p rov ide a founda t ion f o r an accelerated and

18. Most results expected f rom Wo r ld Bank interventions were achieved. These inc luded : (a) 

t im e l y imp lemen ta t ion o f the strategic p l a n t o imp rove tax and customs administration; (b)

came f r o m continued imp lemen ta t ion o f three ongo ing operations: the T a x Adm in is t ra t ion TAL, 
the Integrated F inanc ia l Management project, and the L e g a l and Jud ic ia l R e f o rm project. In 
addition, the DPL series focused o n supporting and t rack ing the imp lemen ta t ion o f the coun t ry 
tax strategy, and p u b l i c expenditure re fo rm . B a n k AAA also rev iewed advances in f inanc ia l 
management and procurement, and supported the DPL dialogue. 
19. 

The qualitative assessment is that the Bank p rog ram contributed to progress on 
Guatemala’s long-term development objectives. The DPL series con t r ibu ted t o macroeconomic 

stabilization, and there are ind ica t ions that activities in p u b l i c f inanc ia l management and

The implementation of the 106-point tax strategic action p lan to improve tax and customs 
administration is on target. As o f 2007, 96 actions o f the tax strategic p l a n h a d been 
imp lemen ted o r were close t o implementation. A Tax Adm in is t ra t ion TAL complemented DPL 
support in this area.20 The T a x TAL was completed successfully,21 despite imp lemen ta t ion

18. The CPR set as goals fo r macro-stability: 
( i ) higher sustained per capita growth rates o f 1.4-2.5 percent, 
compared to 0.5 percent in 2004; (ii) fiscal deficits below 2 percent o f GDP for the en t ire CAS period, compared to 
1.1 percent in 2004; (iii) a fiscal debt to GDP ratio below 25 percent (baseline: 21.9 percent o f GDP in 2004); (iv) 
in f la t ion ra tes w i th in the target levels o f 4.5 percent (+/-1 percent) (baseline 9.2 percent in 2004); and (v) steady 
increases in tax revenues. The resu l ts were: (i) GDP per capita growth rates o f 0.6 percent in 2005, and 2.5 percent 
in 2006 and 3.1 percent in 2007; (ii) fiscal de f ic i ts o f 1.9 percent and 2.1 percent o f GDP in 2006 and 2007, 
respectively; (iii) fiscal debt to GDP ratios o f 21.8 percent and 22.3 percent in 2006 and 2007, respectively; ( iv )

19. The Executive Board o f t h e IMF concluded t h e 2008 Ar t ic le I V consultation on M a y 19,2008. 
20. A key objective under the Peace Accords was to increase tax revenue collection f rom 9.7 percent o f GDP to 
13.2 percent. The Bank support included the Tax Administration T A L , wh ich t h e Board approved in FY98, and 
which became effective in FY 9 9 after congressional authorization to merge the tax w i t h the customs agencies and 
provide the resulting institution, SAT, w i th an independent revenue source equivalent to 2 percent o f revenue 
mobilized. 
21. The ICR graded outcomes and Bank performance under t h e project as marginally satisfactory. I E G concurred. 
The main drawback iden t i f ied b y t h e review was the implementation delay. However, t h e project's performance and 
results during this CAS were satisfactory.

22. 
proportion o f GDP rose f r om 11.5 percent in 2004 to 12.3 percent in 2007, meeting the target o f 
the Berger administration -12.1 percent, but fa l l ing short o f the Peace Accords equivalent target 
o f 13.2 percent o f GDP. 23 Several m i t iga t ing factors explain why i t has been elusive. First, 
implementation o f several trade agreements yielded fiscal losses. Second, as already noted, the 
Supreme Court rejected tax po l icy initiatives w i t h a potential to y ie ld around 2 percent o f GDP. 
Third, the Tax TAL I C R noted that strong constituencies opposed mob i l iz ing higher revenues. 
T h e wo rk over the last few years represents a watershed in efforts to improve taxation. However, 
Guatemala’s l o w revenue collection continues t o limit the capacity o f the Government to 
undertake social investments to strengthen legitimacy and ensure competitiveness.

The results expected under the CAS (as revised by the CPR) have been achieved o r 

provided continuous support since 1996 to improve the transparency and efficacy o f pub l ic 
resource management. In 2002, the Bank approved the Integrated Financial Management 
Technical Assistance Project 111, wh ich provided most support under this CAS. T h e assistance 
focused on: (a) extending coverage o f the financial management systems (SIAF); (b) developing 
medium-term budgeting; and (c) imp rov ing transparency through procurement reform. M o r e 
broadly, the interventions sought to contribute to: (a) a greater transparency in the use o f pub l ic

systems in budgeting, treasury operations, accounting, and human resource management. A 
management system complements SIAF b y establishing automatic linkages between the core

based and multi-annual budgetary approach, and included in i t s budget results-based allocations

included implementation o f a loca l ly developed e-procurement program - Guatecompras - now

evidence, such as f r om the F Y 0 6 Public Expenditure Review (PER), has shown that the 
government’s enhanced budget management capacity i s contributing to a more effective

procurement reforms produced fiscal savings f r om lowe r prices and better quality. The Country 
Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA ) found that the capacity o f loca l governments to 
mob i l ize revenues and deliver services has improved.26 
27. 
(FY08) seeks to complete the re fo rm agenda, w i t h a focus on: (a) integrating SIAF fully in to the 
operations o f the Ministry o f Finance; (b) developing MTEF b y placing greater reliance on 
results; (c) deepening e-procurement to include on-line transactions; (d) developing evaluation 
capacity; and (e) supporting the development o f comprehensive loca l government systems. T h e 
involvement o f c i v i l society in mon i to r ing results, already takes place through several NGOs and 
the training o f journalists on tracking pub l ic financial information, should help strengthen 
sustainability. Forthcoming analytical wo rk could focus on developing a precise understanding

A perception of 
impunity had weakened the legitimacy of 
the state. At the t im e o f the 
Peace Accords, the impunity in c i v i l and c r im i n a l l a w was pa r t icu la r ly damaging t o the 
leg i t imacy o f f o rm a l institutions. A k e y issue was near absolute v o i d in j u d i c i a l services outside 
the cap i ta l c i ty . T h e Jud ic ia l R e f o rm P ro jec t approved by the B o a r d in October 1998 and

There are discrepancies on the impact of Bank assistance on increasing the legitimacy of 
the jud ic iary . The Jud ic ia l R e f o rm I C R ra ted the development outcome and the B a n k 

29. Other development partners also provided or are prov id ing support to improve the quality o f the justice system 
in Guatemala, including the IDB, USA ID and EU. 
30. The project contributed the most to expanding the physical and the human resource capacity o f t h e jud ic iary . 
The judiciary project ICR notes that there are now 365 justices o f the peace as opposed to 229 in 1997, and at least 
one located in every municipality. 70 mediation centers also exist and two mobile courtrooms are ready to deploy. 
The Wo r ld Bank directly contributed b y constructing six j u s t i c e o f the peace courts in PetCn, one o f the least Served 
departments, and remodeling 11 others. The Wo r ld Bank also supported t h e mobile courtrooms and the construction 
o f 16 mediation centers in the interior and the central o f f ice in Guatemala, as we l l as the construction o f one 
departmental and two regional centers. In addition, the project helped improved the efficacy o f jud ic ia l services b y

performance moderately unsatisfactory. T o the contrary, 
IEG upgraded b o t h ra t ings t o

emphasizes that surveys do n o t repo r t imp roved perceptions o n the ava i lab i l i ty and qua l i ty o f 
j u d i c i a l services; that i s , i t proposes that the B a n k interventions have ye t t o impac t long - te rm

gains in administrative capacity and leg is la t ion . In addition, IEG po in ts out, correctly, that B a n k

highest. These discrepancies suggest the need t o re th ink h o w t o con t inue supporting j u d i c i a l

P i l la r 11: Guate Solidaria! 

The objective under the second p i l l a r of 

3 3 . 
the CAS was “supporting inves tmen t in social 
services and r u r a l in f ras t ruc tu re by increasing budgetary allocations t o soc ia l services t o reach 6

imp roved l i n k i n g o f expenditures t o outcomes as part o f the budget process.” 
34. 

Under this p i l l a r , the Bank sought to focus attention on: (a ) service delivery nationwide; 
and (b ) generation of better opportunities fo r the poor in ru ra l areas. The DPL series supported 

increasing the a l loca t ion o f budgetary resources t o social sectors, w h i c h increased t o 6.0 percent 
o f GDP in 2007, above 5.6 percent in 2004.32 An education project, ongo ing at the start o f the 
CAS , helped extend primary education and im p r o v e qua l i ty . The expansion o f S I A F i s p r o v i n g 
an impo r tan t complement t o im p r o v i n g service de l ive ry . Support in the transport sector has 
helped imp rove the r u r a l road ne two rk and connections w i t h the rest o f the coun t ry in one o f the 
poorest and isolated regions. In addition, the B a n k supported the preparation o f strategies in 
health and nu t r i t ion and in r u r a l development, and supporting these sectors th rough self-standing 
operations. Howeve r , la te effectiveness o f the Hea l th and Nu t r i t ion , L o c a l and R u r a l 
Development, and Secondary Educa t ion projects delayed achievement o f expected results in 
these areas. 
35. 

Despite progress, extra efsorts are needed to close the substantive gap that remains in 
human resource indicators. Addressing this gap promptly w i l l help bu i ld legitimacy and 

empower the country to compete. I t was already no ted that since 2000 Guatemala made r a p i d 
improvements in social indicators, but that the coun t ry s t i l l lags i t s peers. G i v e n the l im i t e d 
mob i l iza t ion o f pub l ic resources, an ex t ra e f f o r t t o imp rove the e f f ic iency and equ i ty impac t o f 
pub l ic expenditure i s in order. T h e ob jec t ive should be coalescing recent ins t i tu t iona l gains 
around a service de l ive ry approach that invo lves the commun i ty and tracks progress th rough 
bene f ic ia ry surveys and similar instruments. 

31. 
Indeed, the IEG review calls for an assessment to l e a r n whether the several outputs under t h i s project were 
translated in to desired outcomes. 
32. The percentage o f resources allocated to the delivery o f social services appears l ow because o f the 
methodology utilized for the calculation; the IMF methodology yields a percentage more in l i n e w i t h other regional 
countries. In Guatemala, about 78 percent o f social expenditure goes to education, health and social assistance.

heightened the urgency to compete and grow. Negative per capita F row th and declining 
investment during the previous CAS pe r iod were additional  concern^.^ The analytical wo rk 
iden t i f ied the fo l low ing as key constraints: macroeconomic r i s k s that fo l lowed the financial 
sector crisis in 2001; the slow pace on imp rov ing the business environment; l im i ted markets

The IFC is also contributing growth and competitiveness by focusing on: (i) 
strengthening and deepening the financial sector and helping to promote the financial sector’s 
regional integration in Central America; (ii) imp rov ing physical infrastructure to enhance 
competitiveness; (iii) supporting, v ia investments and technical assistance, manufacturing 
(particularly MSMEs) and value added export sectors; and ( iv ) helping imp rove the investment 
climate. The CAS also stated that the I FC wou ld continue p rov id ing backing for extractive 
industry development through a m in ing project wh ich was fully prepaid in 2006. The FY 0 7 
CAS Progress Report reiterated these priorities. 
47. 
Progress under the different degrees of Bank support was notable. The stabilization o f 
the financial sector, and prompt attention to address p rob lem banks were two remarkable 
achievements. According 
to various sources, Guatemala has consistently 
imp roved i t s 
competitiveness ranking in the region and the world. The wo rk on removing barriers to doing 
business helped placed Guatemala among the top 20 reformers in the w o r l d according t o the 
2008 Do ing Business report. Guatemala had already been one o f the top ten reformers in the 
wo r ld in 2007. Commercial l i n k s between Guatemala and the global and regional markets are far 
stronger now than at the beginning o f the CAS period. E f fo r ts to attract foreign investment are 
paying o f f .

The key challenge now is t o bu i ld on these achievements to generate sustained 
competitiveness. A new I C A i s taking stock o f progress and iden t i fy ing precise barriers that need

poor. Guatemala lacked a modem system o f registration and t i t l i n g to protect property rights and 
property transfer. The legal system was incomplete and did no t provide appropriate con f l ic t 
resolution mechanisms. The CAS goal to improve the institutions guaranteeing real estate 
property rights was h igh ly relevant. First, the CAS sought to help establish a legal and 
institutional framework t o integrate the cadastre and registry functions fo r ru ra l and urban land. 
Second, the CAS provided assistance to advance land registration, starting in some o f the poorest 
areas o f the country. 
56. 
T h e approval o f the Cadastre L aw in 2005 set the legal basis fo r a modern registration system. 
Subsequent wo rk seeks to link the databases o f the Registro de Information Catastral to the 
General Property Registry. The cadastral survey has covered about 37 percent o f Guatemala, 
over double the 15 percent in 2005. Mos t work has been undertaken in one o f the poorest 
regions o f the country - El Peten - w i t h support o f the f i rs t leg o f the Land Administration APL, 
whose a im i s to help register and t i t le real estate property in Guatemala. The ICR refers to ex- 
post surveys that show sustained increases in the price o f registered and t i t led land. Delays in 
completing the first leg o f the APL and starting wo rk on the second leg, wh ich just became 
effective, has led to postponing the CAS goal (i.e., registering 50 percent o f the real estate in the 
country by 2008) until the end o f the second leg o f the Land Administration APL. 
57. 
A P L rated project results and the Bank performance marginally satisfactory; however, IEG 
downgraded bo th ratings to moderately unsatisfactory. The points o f contention include the 
implementation delay and the lack o f sturdiness and completeness o f on-the-ground institutions. 
M o r e specifically, the legal framework fo r t i t l ing remains weak,39 and titling and registration 
institutions remain un-integrated. In the future, the effectiveness o f titling and registration w i l l 
require operational coordination between registration and t i t l i n g institutions, wh ich bear some 
risk. The implementation o f the remaining APL program w i l l have to respond to these 
challenges. 

The extent of 

institutional progress was controversial. The I C R fo r the first leg o f the

The CAS design was relevant to Guatemala’s needs as outlined i n the government 
program and the broad national p r io r i ty to deliver on the Peace Accords agenda. C A S 

imp lemen ta t ion generally f o l l ow e d i t s design, as mos t m a j o r in tended products were delivered. 
The C A S design and imp lemen ta t ion were also catalyzed by p roduc t ive and e f fec t ive d ia logue 
with the authorities. Mo reove r , the B a n k p rov ided techn ica l support and assisted the Government 
in presenting p o l i c y rationales t o in te rna l audiences, and in i n f o rm i n g the in te rna t iona l 
commun i ty o n Guatemala’s progress. The Government and the B a n k dealt p r om p t l y and 
e f fec t ive ly with unexpected developments, such as the serious bank ing problems o f 2006 and 
2007. Initial e f fo r ts were also made t o w o r k j o i n t l y with other development partners. M o s t 
impo r tan t ly , the w o r k i n g re la t ionsh ip between the B a n k and the authorities substantially changed 
f o r the best during t h i s C A S period.

C A S substantially con t r ibu ted t o the mos t c r i t i c a l p r io r i t ies , and in some cases the actual results

The CAS delivered on the bulk of expected results f rom Bank interventions. Further, the 

Major contributions were made, including i n stabilizing the macroeconomic framework, 

im p r o v i n g the soundness o f the f inanc ia l sector, enhancing the business climate, and 
expanding access t o in te rna t iona l markets. These gains in turn fac i l i ta ted economic recove ry

SIAF was considerably extended t o cover a l l cen t ra l government and m a n y l o c a l 
governments, and practices are m o r e transparent. 
C A S assistance he lped close the gap in the de l ive ry o f social services. C A S ac t iv i t ies 
supported the a l loca t ion o f greater resources t o meet social needs, and ac t iv i t ies in primary 
education are h e l p i n g t o boost the access t o school by ma rg ina l groups. 
Howeve r , the C A S also de l ive red results in some areas where questions have arisen 
concerning either p rog ram impac t o r sustainability. F o r example, IEG has asked f o r an in-

greater revenue mobilization, moving above the targets set by the Peace Accords. Building up the legitimacy of the 
judiciary merits continued support.

Focus on f i rm i n g up competitiveness gains by leveraging greater access to international 
markets, healthy macroeconomic fundamentals, an improved business environment, and interest 
among domestic and foreign sources to invest in Guatemala. Ongoing analytical wo rk should 

help to iden t i fy remaining and emerging constrains to competiveness. Fo r instance, f i rm ing up 
gains in banking regulation should be complemented b y imp rov ing SME access to finance and 
developing the non-banking financial sector. Add i t iona l support to strengthen property rights and 
regional infrastructure should also help boost competitiveness. The likely slowdown of wo r ld 
markets poses a risk to high growth, particularly given a possible drop in remittance income. In 
this context, an assessment o f r i s k s to growth that includes development o f remedies could be a 
valuable tool. L i n k i n g poor areas to markets and ru ra l development should also be part o f the 
competitiveness agenda, to a degree beyond activities in the ongoing project.’’ Lastly, the 
integration o f Central American markets should advance beyond remov ing trade barriers to 
greater integration in key sectors (i.e., energy, transport, etc.). 
84. 

Program effectiveness w i l l be greatly enhanced if the forthcoming CPS precisely 
delineates the links between Bank intervention outputs and results and Guatemala’s development 

outcomes. E f fo r ts should be made to strengthen the results framework along these lines. 
Moreover, the program in Guatemala has successfully built several ins t i tu t iona l platforms that 
can contribute to sustained progress on development outcomes, and the challenge now i s to 
produce these outcomes. I t i s important in this context to c la r i fy how interventions lead to 
development results, leveraging analytical wo rk and impact analysis, and attempting to 
strengthen mon i to r ing and evaluation. 

Operational recommendations 

85. Work to reduce the project preparation, approval and execution gap. Several options 

should be explored j o i n t l y w i t h the authorities to achieve this objective. First, efforts should be 
made to reduce project preparation time and to engage Congress to shorten effectiveness lags, 
which have recently been over a year. One possible option i s t o propose operations to the Board 
early in the country po l i t ica l cycle, or very late so that a successor administration can leverage i t s 
honeymoon period to w i n approval. In addition, the Bank should strive to reduce the number o f 
agencies involved in projects, and focus on a smaller number o f c r i t ica l interventions. In this 
context, WB I could help develop a broader dialogue w i t h Congress and c i v i l society to broaden 
the support for reform. 
86. 
projects, during their i n i t i a l phases, gather the necessary baseline data to facilitate impact 
analyses at project closings. Some projects have already done this, but this practice should be 
generalized. 

Develop the basis to undertake quality impact analysis. I t i s important that investment 

87. Maintain, if amenable to the Government, the D P L structure. The Bank’s positive D P L 

experience suggests retaining this instrument wh i le maintaining a manageable agenda and 
avoiding program overload. T h e focus on k e y priorities should remain. T h e DPL should be 

50. The on-going pipeline w i t h focus on infrastructure and business environment i s already a good point o f 
departure. A DPL se r ies can help frame a competitiveness dialogue and focus on cr i t ica l r i s k s l i k e the financial 
sector.

complemented by support to improve pub l ic project evaluation in l ine w i t h ongoing efforts to 
introduce results-based budgeting. 
88. 

Continue efsorts to rely on country systems and seek strategic alliances w i th other 
development partners to facilitate greater selectivity of Bank interventions. The improvements in 

public financial management can be leveraged to promote greater use o f country systems fo r 
project implementation. These improvements can also facilitate harmonization w i t h other 
development partners, and help the W o r l d Bank move towards greater selectivity. 
89. 
po r t fo l io deteriorated in 2008 as new projects came on l i n e and programs adjusted to the 
government transition. E f fo r ts should be strengthened to improve po r t fo l io performance, 
including, for example, broadening developmental dialogue to include a l l factors, such as the 
parliamentary agenda, w i t h a v iew to helping reach consensus. 

Continue work to improve po r t fo l io perj5ormance. As noted above, the quality o f the
