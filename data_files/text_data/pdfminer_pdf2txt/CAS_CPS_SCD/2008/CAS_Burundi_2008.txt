and e thn ic dom inance . ’ The coun t ry i s sma l l and land locked . I t has one o f the highest popu la t ion

The most recent full war began in 1993, when the Tu ts i -dom ina ted a rmy assassinated the 
f i r s t democ ra t ica l ly e lec ted President, a Hutu. The ensuing v io lence caused over 300,000 deaths and 
percen t o f the popu la t ion . In 1996, a m i l i t a r y coup took place, 
d isp laced 1.2 m i l l i o n people-16 
lead ing the in te rna t iona l c omm u n i t y t o impose an econom ic embargo. Hos t i l i t ies con t inued until a 
peace accord was reached in Arusha , Tanzania, in August 2000 . Seventeen p o l i t i c a l organ iza t ions 
s igned the A rusha Agreemen t ; but several rebe l groups, i n c l u d i n g the CNDD - FDD , the largest rebe l 
g roup at the t ime , and the FNL-PALIPEHUTU, did n o t pa r t ic ipa te in the ta lks . 

8 . 

From 2000 to 2005, Burundi made a successful transition to a multi-party system of 
government. A T rans i t iona l Governmen t , based o n p ow e r shar ing among the coun try ’s t w o m a i n

groups. 

ethnic groups, took office in January 2002 for a 36 month term. A Tutsi president and Hutu vice 
president led the Transitional Government for the first eighteen months, with a smooth handover to a 
Hutu president and Tutsi vice president for the second eighteen months. By the end o f 2003, the 
Transitional Government had signed new peace and cease-fire agreements with all armed political 
parties and movements, including the CNDD-FDD, with the exception of the FNL-PALIPEHUTU 
faction. In December 2004 the government launched a demobilization program targeting the army 
and combatants from former rebel groups. In February 2005, the country approved by referendum a 
new constitution emphasizing power sharing and protection o f minority and women's rights. 
Parliamentary elections in August 2005 went relatively smoothly. The CNDD-FDD, led by Pierre 
Nkurunziza, won over 58 percent of the vote. Parliament elected him the following month a s the new 
president. 

9. 
Since 2005, political progress has been mixed. The country has experienced several 
political power struggles, including alleged coups, imprisonment o f political figures, and grenade 
attacks on the residences o f political figures. In 2007, internal divisions within the ruling CNDD- 
FDD party triggered a political crisis that paralyzed the government and parliament. The main 
political parties eventually reached an agreement, and in November 2007 a broad coalition cabinet 
took office that included both major ethnic groups and key political parties in full compliance with 
the constitution. 

10. 
Security has been mixed. In September 2006, the government and the FNL-PALIPEHUTU, 
the one remaining active rebel movement, signed a cease-fire agreement, but it was not implemented 
and sporadic fighting continued in areas near Bujumbura. Despite strong regional support since early 
2008 to revive the peace process, renewed fighting broke ou t between the FNL and the government 
in April 2008, resulting in more than 100 deaths. In mid-May 2008, key FNL leaders returned to 
Bujumbura, the first significant move to implement the 2006 cease-fire agreement. On May 26 ,2008 , 
the government and the FNL signed a joint statement ending hostilities, and resumed negotiations to 
implement the cease-fire. 

11 . 
Corruption is widespread and entrenched after decades of conflict, hindering political 
and economic development. According to a recent diagnostic study on governance and corruption, 
households, public officials, private enterprises, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) 
perceive a high level o f corruption involving police, customs, tax collection, the justice system, 
public procurement, and access to basic services. There have been two high-level corruption scandals 
under the current government: in January 2006, a minister was dismissed for his handling o f the sale 
of the presidential plane, and in July 2007 another minister authorized irregular payments of US$17 
million to a petroleum trading company (Interpetrol). The government has since taken action to close 
public financial management loopholes, but has not started judiciary processes against the 
perpetrators. Various surveys and seminars have identified impunity a s a key governance weakness. 

12. 
There is an opportunity to strengthen democracy, increase economic growth, reduce 
poverty, and exit the conflict trap, but the challenges are formidable. The risk o f relapse to 
conflict is high-research 
has shown that about half o f countries will fall back into conflict within 
ten years. In the short term, Burundi faces the challenge of maintaining stability before the 2010 
elections. The political crises and difficult peace process underscore the fragility o f the political and 
security situation. Institutional capacity is weak, hindered by cronyism and corruption. To 
consolidate peace and minimize the risk of future conflict, the country needs t o diversify its economy 
and generate pro-poor economic growth; and it also needs to build more effective, accountable, and 
inclusive state institutions to improve governance, rule of law, and delivery o f basic services. 

B. Poverty Profile and Progress toward the Millennium Development Goals 
13. 
The recent war caused poverty to nearly double. The number o f p o o r be low the pove r ty 
thresho ld increased f r o m 35 percen t in 1993 t o 68 percen t in 2002 . A c c o r d i n g t o a 2006 survey, an 
estimated 67 percen t o f the popu la t ion live be low the pove r ty l i n e and m a n y l i v e in extreme poverty.2 
The Gini coe f f ic ien t i s es t ima ted a t 0.38, re f lec t ing tha t the m a i n p r o b l em i s widespread pove r ty 
ra ther than inequa l i ty . 

14. 
Poverty i s deeper and more pervasive in rural areas; and there i s substantial regional 
disparity. A lm o s t 9 7 percen t o f Burundi’s poo r live in r u r a l areas, w h i c h have a pove r ty incidence o f 
69 percent, compared t o 34 pe rcen t in u rban areas. The gap be tween the pove r ty l i n e and the average 
d a i l y consump t ion pe r person in r u r a l areas i s mo re than doub le the gap in u rban areas. U rban 
Bu jumbu ra has the lowes t p o v e r t y inc idence (29 percent), while in p rov inces i t ranges f r om 57 
percen t in Bururi t o 82 percen t in K i rundo , w h i c h was cons idered the lead ing supp l ier o f food staples 
p r i o r t o the c i v i l wa r . 

15. 
An estimated 63 percent o f the population suffers from food insecurity, with substantial 
regional variation. An es t ima ted 80 percen t o f peop le rece ive o n l y 56 pe rcen t o f the coun try ’s to ta l 
d a i l y consump t ion . The share o f popu la t ion with a ve ry l o w ca lo r ic in take i s tw i c e as high in ru ra l 
compared t o u rban areas; and in the nor th , a lmos t one -ha l f the popu la t ion has a ve ry l o w ca lor ic 
intake, w h i l e in the sou th l e s s than one - f i f th has a l o w ca lo r ic in take . 

16. 
Poverty i s linked statistically to the education, occupation, and gender o f the head o f 
household. The heads o f the wea l th ies t 20 percen t o f households have p ropo r t iona l ly mo re fo rma l 
educa t ion (41 percen t are p r im a r y schoo l graduates, 15 percen t are secondary schoo l graduates, and 4 
percen t are co l lege graduates) than the heads o f the poores t 2 0 percen t o f households (26 percent are 
p r im a r y schoo l graduates and 1 pe rcen t are secondary schoo l graduates). The heads o f the poorest 20 
percen t o f households are m o r e l i k e l y t o be farmers. Peop le l iv ing in female-headed households are 
poo re r than those in ma le-headed households. 

17. Maternal mortality and child malnutrition rates are the second highest on the 
continent. Ma te rna l m o r t a l i t y stands a t 1,000 per 100,000 l i v e births. One ou t o f six in fan ts does n o t 
survive his f i r s t b i r thday , and one ou t o f f i v e his fifth. Ma la r ia , diarrhea, resp i ra to ry in fec t ions , and 
the compound ing e f fec ts o f m a l n u t r i t i o n are the m a i n causes o f m o r t a l i t y and m o r b i d i t y among 
ch i ldren . A b o u t 44 pe rcen t o f ch i ld ren under five are ma lnour ished . A c c o r d i n g t o in terna t iona l 
studies, ma lnu t r i t ion reduces IQ and lowe rs p r im a r y schoo l comp le t ion rates. As in o ther countries in 
the region, the l i k e l y k e y de term inan ts o f ma lnu t r i t ion are p o o r hyg iene and feeding practices and 
cer ta in diseases. In 2006, the gove rnmen t e l im ina ted hea l th serv ice fees f o r ch i ld ren under f i v e and 
fo r women during de l ive ry . S ince then, u s e o f these services h a d doub led , but shortages in 
equipment, drugs, and q u a l i f i e d s t a f f con t inue t o cons tra in service de l ive ry . 

18. 
H IV /A IDS i s the second most common cause o f mortality among adults. The adu l t 
prevalence rate was abou t 3.6% in 2007 . Burundi’s rate o f 12% H I V in fec t ions among pregnan t 
women i s high compa red with ne ighbo r ing coun tr ies (Rwanda 9.8%, Uganda 8.5%, and Tanzania 
7.5%).

facilities. U r b a n wa te r supply coverage dropped f r om ove r 7 0 percen t in 1993 to an estimated 60

Burundi i s not likely to reach many of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by 
2015. N e a r l y a l l soc ia l ind ica to rs have sharp ly de ter iora ted as a resu l t o f the c i v i l war, and are n o w 
among the wo rs t in the wo r ld . Burundi ranks 167 ou t o f 177 coun tr ies in the 2007/2008 H um a n 
Deve lopmen t I n d e x o f the U n i t e d Na t ions Deve lopmen t P rog ram (UNDP). Burundi’s progress 
towards the MDGs i s shown in B o x 1, and further data i s p r o v i d e d in A n n e x 1. 

Box 1: Burundi’s Prospects f o r Achieving the Millennium Development Goa ls by 2015 

Goal 1: Eradicate extreme poverty and hunger. 
Unlikely. The poverty headcount increased from 36% in 1990 to 67% in 2006, far from the M D G target o f 18 
percent. In 2000 Burundi had the h ighes t under-5 malnutrition rate in A f r ica at 57%. Recent data indicates that 
malnutrition has decreased to 44%, although this i s s t i l l the second highest rate in A f r ica (the M D G target i s 23%). 
Goal 2: Achieve universal pr imary education. 
Possible. Burundi cou ld potentially meet the target for universal primary enrollment. To this end, the government, 
w i th development partner support, has prepared a sector plan that w i l l be submitted to the Education for A l l Fast 
Track Initiative for funding in 2008. Free universal primary education, introduced in September 2005, has increased 
gross enrollment to nearly 110%. Completion rates remain low at 40% (2006/2007). 
Goal 3: Promote gender equality and empower women, 
Possible. The target o n gender equality in primary education w i l l very l ike ly be met w i t h the ratio o f girls to boys 
currently at 80 percent. The target on women’s participation in parliament has been met. Women’s lack o f control 
over resources, including land, remains a key challenge. 
Goal 4: Reduce child mortality. 
Highly unlikely. Ch i ld and infant mor ta l i ty rates remain high at 190/1,000 and 114/1,000 l ive births, respectively, 
but show improvements from 2000 peak rates o f 291/1,000 and 156/1,000 l ive birth. 
Goal 5: Improve maternal health. 
Highly unlikely. Maternal mor ta l i ty remains very h igh at 1,000/100,000 l ive births. Sk i l led health personnel attend 
only 31% o f births, w e l l be low the M D G goal o f 100%. Cost and lack o f trained health specialists are the key 
constraints to accessing health services. 
Goal 6: Combat H I V /A ID S , malaria and other diseases. 
Possible. Burundi could potentially meet the H I V / A ID S target. Overall H I V prevalence i s 3.6% in 2007. However, 
tuberculosis, which i s often linked w i t h H IV /A IDS , has almost tripled from 125/100,000 in 1990 to 334/100,000 in 
2005. 
Goal 7: Ensure environmental sustainability. 
Unlikely. Only 50% o f the population have access to improved water resources. Among these, 75% l ive in urban 
areas and only 45% in rura l areas.

C . Economic Developments and Prospects 

Recent Economic Developments 

22. 
The recent civil war devastated the economy; and a four-year economic embargo and 
several episodes o f drought took a further toll. In te rna t iona l assistance came t o a near ha l t f r om a

29. 
Inflation, as measured by the consumer price index, has averaged 7.2 percent from 2001 
to 2006, with large fluctuations. Ave rage i n f l a t i o n topped 13.4 percen t in 2005, dropped to 2.8

Public Finance Structure 

Government expenditure increased from 27.2 percent of GDP in 2001 to 38.2 percent in 

32. 
2006. This i s cons ide rab ly h ighe r than many sub-Saharan A f r i c a n coun tr ies . Recurren t expenditure 
accounts f o r 60 percen t o f to ta l expend i ture and has r i s e n o n l y slightly ove r the last six years. The 
wage b i l l has increased t o nea r ly 10 percen t o f G D P in 2006, r e f l e c t i n g the hiring o f new teachers in 
2005 and a 15 percen t salary increase in 2006, the f i r s t since 2001. Cap i ta l expend i ture has doub led 
f r om 6.4 percen t o f GDP in 2001 t o 14.8 percent in 2006 due t o fo re ign grants. 

Government revenue (excluding grants) as a share of GD P has been stable at around 20 

33. 
percent in 2001-06. Gran ts n o w represent nea r ly h a l f o f to ta l gove rnmen t revenue, bringing to ta l 
governmen t revenue t o 27.7 percen t o f GDP in 2006 . 

Fiscal performance was satisfactory in 2005-06, but mixed in 2007, due t o s lower than

2007 budget d e f i c i t (exc lud ing grants) i s estimated at 20.1 percen t o f GDP (compared to 19.3 percent 
in 2006). The ove ra l l d e f i c i t o n a comm i tmen t basis averaged abou t 4.3 percen t o f GD P in 2001- 
2006. The share o f the d e f i c i t funded by ex terna l partners increased f r o m 27 percen t in 2001 to 90 
percent in 2006. Sho r t fa l ls in budget support in 2006, r e f l e c t i n g in p a r t donors’ governance 
concerns, were o f fse t by spend ing cuts in n o n wage spending and increased domes t ic bo r row ing . 

The government has increased public expenditure allocations to priority sectors over 

35. 
the past six years (see Table 2). As a r e s u l t o f the ava i lab i l i ty o f H I P C funds s tar t ing in 2005 and 
increased dono r support, the gove rnmen t has increased p r i o r i t y econom ic and soc ia l expenditures

The government has taken steps since 2005 to improve public financial management 
(PFM). The gove rnmen t in t roduced a doub le-en try accoun t ing sys tem , a n e w nomenc la ture tha t

The government and the Bank recently completed a Public Expenditure Management 
and Financial Accountability Review (PEMFAR ) to prioritize future reforms. I t identifies fou r 
m a i n challenges: (i) im p r o v i n g the a l loca t ive e f f ic iency o f p u b l i c expenditures by reduc ing secur i ty

External Trade 

38. 
Large current account deficits reflect the country's limited exports, consisting mainly of 
coffee and tea, and its dependence on imports of fuel and capital goods. During 2001-06, the 
share o f expor ts in G D P averaged 6.3 percent, with a l o w 4.9 percen t in 2002 and a high 7.2 percen t 
in 2004, re f lec t ing swings in the co f fee trade. The share o f impo r ts in G D P s tead i ly increased f r om 
16.4 percen t in 2001 t o 26.6 percen t in 2006 and 30.3 percen t in 2007. The cu r ren t account de f ic i t 
( inc lud ing grants) rose f r o m 8.1 pe rcen t o f G D P in 2004, t o an es t ima ted 16 percen t in 2007, 
re f lec t ing a sharp r i s e in the services trade de f ic i t . 

39. 
Burundi i s one o f the hardest hit countries in Africa by recent food and fuel price 
increases (see Box 2). I t i s a ne t impo r te r o f f o o d and o i l products, and i t s pos i t ion as a land locked

Medium-Term Prospects 

40. 
The medium-term economic framework assumes an acceleration of real GDP growth 
f r om 3.6 in 2007 t o 4.5 percen t in 2008 and t o 5 percen t until 2011 . G r o w t h i s l i k e l y t o f luc tua te

G D P g r ow t h ra te rema ins the p r im a r y sector ( o f w h i c h food crops cons t i tu te abou t 80 percent), 
w h i c h con tr ibu tes abou t 49 pe rcen t t o GDP . There i s a s low shift t o secondary and te r t ia ry sectors. 

41. 
Annual average inflation (measured by the GDP deflator) i s projected to decline f r om a 
high o f 18.5 percen t in 2008 t o 6.6 percen t in 201 l.3 This assumes im p r o v e d Cen t ra l B a n k l i q u i d i t y 
management, limited f inanc ing o f gove rnmen t ac t iv i t ies by the Cen t ra l Bank , and a modest medium- 
te rm dec l ine in food and energy pr ices , a l though n o t t o their i n i t i a l l e v e l s . 

42. 
The fiscal deficit i s expected to average 2.0 percent o f GDP , including grants. Wages and 
salaries are p ro jec ted t o peak in 2008 at 1 1 .O percen t o f GDP, m a i n l y due t o de lays in demob i l iza t ion 
and the need t o hire teachers. Assuming con t inued demob i l iza t ion and wage restraint, they w i l l then

increases slightly, re f lec t ing a sh i f t f r o m ex terna l t o domes t ic f inanc ing . 

Box 2: Food and Fuel Price Increases: Impact and Policy Options 

Burundi i s vulnerable to food and fuel price shocks because i t i s landlocked and a net importer o f food. Agricultural 
land i s overexploited and degraded, resulting in declining food production. According to a recen t IMF study, 
Burundi i s one o f four teen hardest-hit countries in sub-Saharan Africa by the recen t increases in international prices. 
Impact: From December 2007 to Apr i l 2008, prices o f basic staples rose on average by 23 percent, exacerbating 
malnutrition and poverty, including in coffee growing provinces in the north that have the highest poverty rate. 
There i s also a significant macroeconomic impact: preliminary estimates suggest that additional financing of US $ 1 5 
million (about 1 .5 percent o f GDP) i s needed to offset budgetary costs related to food and fuel price increases. 
Po l icy Responses: The government has reduced the tariff on imported diesel, which i s mainly consumed by the 
poor, and has increased the tariff on gasoline imports to preserve overall tax collection levels. In addition, 
development partners are working with the government to urgently address food insecurity and to increase the 
domestic agricultural supply response. Interventions include: 
increasing food aid and better targeting food-aid programs to vulnerable groups, 
scaling up programs that provide farm inputs to producers, such as seeds and fertilizer for the upcoming 
agricultural season; and 
enhancing longer-term food supply through reforms and investments, such as small-scale irrigation, to increase 
agricultural production and productivity. 
The government has requested an increase in IDA budget support. The Bank and the government are discussing 
possible additional financing under the new Global Food Crisis Response Program Trust Fund. The IMF increased 
the amount o f the recent PRGF, as requested by the government, in view o f the external shock. Other donors are 
considering similar assistance.

shown in Table 1, both measurements o f inflation (consumer price and GDP deflator) show a similar pattern.

Box 3: Coffee-Past Source o f Conflict, Potential Source o f Future Growth 

The coffee sector i s central to Burundi’s poverty reduction and conflict-prevention agenda. Coffee provides income 
to about 800,000 households, nearly h a l f the rura l population, and i t accounts for about 70 percent o f export 
revenues. Dur ing the war, production f e l l sharply, from over 45,000 tons in 1994 to 18,000 tons in 2001. Production 
i s volatile due to the o l d age o f coffee trees, wh ich cannot carry two consecutive years o f h igh production. 
Production i s also declining due to an institutional structure that provides disincentives to farmers, who receive the 
lowest prices in the sub-region. 
A Fac to r in Past Conflicts. T h e Belgian colonial authorities introduced coffee cultivation to provide cash income to 
the rural population and generate foreign exchange earnings. Planting coffee trees was made compulsory in areas 
suitable for coffee production. Post independence governments continued the po l icy o f forced coffee cultivation, and 
established a monopoly for the processing and export o f coffee, pay ing producers a small fraction o f the 
international price. The country’s small urban e l i t e benefited from this p r ice d i f ference . In the 198Os, the 
government promoted a massive coffee t r e e planting program, w i th the objective o f increasing production from 
30,000 tons to 50,000 tons by the early 1990s. I t also invested in about 140 washing stations w i th Wor ld Bank 
support. The area under coffee more than doubled, but for lack o f adequate incentives, the yields declined 
dramatically. 
Good Potential for Growth. Burundi produces h igh ly prized “mild Arabicas” and has the potential to en ter h igh 
value specialty markets. In t h e central highlands, climatic and agronomic conditions are ideal for h igh quality coffee 
cultivation. In neighboring Rwanda, close to 1,000 tons o f f u l l y washed coffee was sold in 2006 at a price close to 
US$2/lb, compared to an average price for Burundian coffee o f about US$.86/lb. 
Status of Reforms. The Government o f Burund i has repeatedly signaled i t s commitment to coffee sector reform to 
improve production, yields, and farmer incomes. In 2005 and 2006, the government took steps to liberalize the 
sector and created a Coffee Re form Steering Committee. However, strong vested interests have slowed sector 
reforms. The re form agenda experienced a setback in 2007 when the government arranged to market a l l fu l ly 
washed coffee through a monopoly broker based in New York . In 2008, the Government took corrective actions and 
prepared new regulations to clearly define the r u l e s for a l l players in the coffee sector. The government i s 
commissioning, w i th Wo r ld Bank support, a study to evaluate options for sector restructuring. The study w i l l use a 
participatory process and engage a l l stakeholders; and i s expected to lead to the adoption o f a reform plan b y t h e end 
o f the year. 

43, 
The current account deficit, excluding official transfers, narrows from 2008 onwards, 
but rema ins substantial, decreasing f r o m 36.3 percen t o f G D P in 2006 t o 31.9 percent in 2008 and 
further t o 30.3 percen t in 2011 . Expor ts , espec ia l ly co f fee and m inera ls , shou ld increase and 
recons truc t ion-re la ted impo r ts shou ld s low . 

44. 
These projections depend on sustained macroeconomic, public finance, and sector 
policy reforms. P r im a r y sector g r ow t h depends o n re fo rms and inves tmen ts t o increase food c rop 
p roduc t iv i ty . Secondary sector g r ow t h depends o n increased mining; pe t ro leum sector re forms ; and

Debt Sustainability 

45 . 

Since reaching the H I PC decision point in 2005, Burundi has benefited from Interim 

H IPC debt relief. The coun t ry has made good progress t ow a r d mos t o f the n ine comp le t ion p o i n t 
triggers (see A n n e x 4). B a r r i n g un foreseen governance o r r e f o rm setbacks, Burundi cou ld reach the 
comp le t ion p o i n t by ea r ly 2009 . A f t e r reach ing the comp le t ion po in t , Burundi w i l l be eligible f o r a 
re la t ive ly sma l l amoun t o f add i t iona l debt r e l i e f unde r the M u l t i l a t e r a l Debt R e l i e f I n i t i a t i v e (MDRI). 

46. 

Even after full debt relief, Burundi will remain at high risk o f debt distress, mainly due 

to the country’s low export base. A Bank -Fund D e b t Sus ta inab i l i ty Ana lys is (FY08) reveals tha t 
even a f ter de l ive ry o f full enhanced HIPC and MDRI assistance, the net present va lue o f debt-to- 
exports ra t io rema ins above 100 percent, p l a c i n g Burundi in the “high risk o f debt d is t ress ” category. 
L e s s concessional b o r r ow i n g o r l ow e r GDP o r expo r t g r ow t h w o u l d subs tan t ia l ly increase the risk o f 
deb t d is tress . This analysis suggests tha t the governmen t concentrate on: (i) imp lemen t ing re fo rms t o 
increase and diversify expor ts and t o p romo te g row th ; (ii) ma in ta in ing prudent f isca l and mone tary 
po l ic ies ; (iii) ensu r ing p ruden t deb t management, i n c l u d i n g ob ta in ing ex terna l gran t f inanc ing as

111. GOVERNMENT PROGRAM 

A. Burundi’s Poverty Reduction Strategy 
47. 
The Government o f Burundi approved its first PRSP in September 2006.4 This was an 
impress ive ach ievemen t during the pos t -con f l ic t per iod . The PRSP a ims t o l a y the founda t ion fo r

Consu l ta t ions t o o k p lace in a l l seventeen p rov inces (146 communes), i n v o l v i n g 840 peop le f r om 
mo re than 145 c i v i l soc ie ty organ iza t ions , and four teen sector and thema t ic groups. Burundi’s 
Counc i l o f M in is te rs adop ted the PRSP and Par l iamen t approved the PRSP p r i o r t o i t s review by the 
Boa rds o f the IMF and W o r l d Bank . The PRSP built upon an Interim PRSP comp le ted in Novembe r 

2003. 

48. 
Four strategic priorities emerged from the consultation process: (i) imp rove governance 
and security; (ii) p romo te sustainable and equ i tab le econom ic g row th ; (iii) deve lop human capital; 
and (iv) p reven t and con t ro l HIV/AIDS. In add i t ion t o these fou r axes, the PRSP highlights the need 
to : re focus the ro le o f gove rnmen t t o g ive r o om t o the p r iva te sector and commun i ty-based 
organizations; build ins t i tu t iona l capac i ty a t b o t h cen tra l and loca l l e v e l s ; address gender inequalities; 
and build a new par tnersh ip with donors. With W o r l d B a n k support, the gove rnmen t i s e labora t ing a 
PRSP r e s u l t s and p o l i c y m a t r i x t o be t ter m o n i t o r PRSP imp lemen ta t ion . 

Axis 1: Improve Security and Governance 

49. 
The PRSP recognizes security as a precondition for economic growth and poverty 
reduction. I t s secur i ty ob jec t ive i s t o res tore free movemen t o f persons and goods throughou t the 
coun try . To d o so, the gove rnmen t in tends t o imp lemen t a comprehens ive and permanen t ceasefire 
with the rema in ing rebe l group ; con t inue t o demob i l ize , reintegrate ex-combatants, and ma in ta in the 
size o f the m i l i t a r y and p o l i c e forces at leve ls tha t are su f f ic ien t f o r secur i ty and tha t are f isca l ly 
sustainable; imp lemen t secu r i ty sector r e f o rm t o pro fess iona l ize the secur i ty forces; and prevent the 
p ro l i fe ra t ion o f sma l l arms. T o sustain peace, the PRSP also highlights the need t o strengthen the rule 
o f l a w and the j u d i c i a l system, and t o es tab l ish mechanisms fo r se t t l ing and p reven t ing land disputes 
(see B o x 4). 

50. 
The PRSP underscores the importance of good governance following decades of 
malfeasance that contributed to conflict. The governmen t a ims t o s treng then the cu l tu re o f 
democracy, 
i n c l u d i n g by p r om o t i n g decen tra l iza t ion and greater c i t izen pa r t ic ipa t ion . I t w i l l 
strengthen p u b l i c adm in is t ra t ion th rough a c i v i l service r e f o rm p o l i c y . I t w i l l also strengthen 
transparency and accoun tab i l i ty o f p u b l i c resource management. In August 2006, Burundi 
established a Special A n t i -C o r r u p t i o n B r igade and ra t i f ied an an t i -co r rup t ion law . 

A x i s 2: Achieving Equitable and Sustainable Growth 
51. 
The PRSP’s growth strategy focuses on the rural sector. G i v e n the impor tance o f 
agr icu l ture in the economy, sustained g r ow t h in the r u r a l sector w o u l d reduce income d ispar i t ies and 
pove r ty . Thus, the PRSP emphasizes the need t o imp rove ag r icu l tu ra l p roduc t iv i ty , a l though i t i s n o t

Box 4: The Land Problem 

Burundi’s population has increased four fo ld over the past f i f ty years. Together w i t h Rwanda and Comoros, Burundi 
has the highest population density in A fr ica : over 300 inhabitants per square kilometer. Demographic pressures have 
caused land scarcity and fragmentation and environmental degradation, creating a cycle o f poverty and contributing 
to Burundi’s cycle o f violence. According to the M in is t ry o f Public Security, 60 percent o f c r im e s are linked to land 

issues . 

Returning refugees, most o f whose land i s now occupied, further exacerbate the land problem. About 300,000 
refugees have returned s ince 2003; and another 45,000 are expected to r e t u r n in the near f u t u r e . 
To address the land problem, Burundi needs to (i) resolve the immediate problem o f restoring land to re tu rnees or 
offering alternative compensation; and (ii) seek a lasting solution through a land re form po l icy that addresses 
s e c u r i t y o f tenure, wh ich i s c r i t ica l for sustainable agriculture. 
As a f r s t step towards land reform, the government needs to promote dialogue between a l l parties to define a po l icy 
on land issues. A census o f agricultural lands, wh ich i s underway w i th Bank support, w i l l help establish the basis for 
redistribution and titling mechanisms. The government needs to revise the 1987 Land Code and harmonize it w i th 
traditional practices. 

52. 

The PRSP calls for making the private sector the engine o f growth, th rough economic 

l ibe ra l iza t ion and gove rnmen t d ives t i tu re f r om the p roduc t ive sector. R e f o rm o f the lega l and

Axis 3 and 4: Developing Human Capital and Fighting HIV/AIDS 

54. 

To develop human capital, the PRSP calls for expanding quality social services in local 

communities. The PRSP a ims t o expand access to educa t ion and im p r o v e i t s qua l i ty . In health, the 
PRSP a ims t o reduce c h i l d and ma te rna l mo r ta l i ty rates th rough im p r o v e d access t o basic hea l th

governmen t demons tra ted i t s comm i tmen t t o increase expenditures o n soc ia l services by in t roduc ing 
a “free p r im a r y schoo l” p o l i c y in September 2005, and by e l im i n a t i n g ce r ta in hea l th care fees in 

2006. 

55 . 
The PRSP highlights the government’s determination to stem the spread o f H I V IA ID S 
and reduce its impact on individuals, families, and communities. U n d e r the PRSP, the 

governmen t w i l l take ac t ions t o p reven t H IV transm iss ion and increase trea tmen t to peop le living

targe t ing high risks groups . 

B. Development Partner Support 

56. 

Burundi depends on aid and will continue to need high levels of donor assistance. 
O f f i c i a l Deve lopmen t Assistance accounted f o r 54.6 percen t o f gross na t iona l income in 2004. 
During 2006 and 2007, budget suppor t f r o m donors accoun ted f o r 30 percen t and 20 percent 
respec t ive ly o f the to ta l governmen t budge t . 

57. 

Donors have shifted their aid from humanitarian to development assistance. In 2008, 
recogn iz ing tha t Burundi n o longe r faced an acute human i ta r ian crisis, the UN d iscon t inued the 
Conso l ida ted Appea l Process (CAP), w h i c h has p r o v i d e d a f ramewo rk f o r human i ta r ian a i d since 
2000. The UN O f f i c e f o r the Coo rd ina t ion o f Human i ta r ian A f f a i r s in Burundi, w h i c h prepares the 
C A P i s cons ide r ing t o close i t s Burundi o f f ice . Donors , such have Sw i tzer land , have shifted their 
assistance t o b i la te ra l deve lopmen t programs . 

58. 

The number o f donors has increased as the peace process has progressed. Until recently, 
few donors we re ac t ive in Burundi, m a i n l y B e l g i um , the Eu ropean U n i o n (EU), Germany, the 
Netherlands, U n i t e d K i n g d o m (UK), United States (US), and the W o r l d Bank . The EU and the B a n k 
accounted f o r a lmos t h a l f the to ta l deve lopmen t outlays. During the f i r s t dono r R o u n d Tab le mee t ing 
held in B u j um b u r a in M a y 2007, pa r t ic ipa t ion inc luded sixty representatives f r o m the in terna t iona l 
commun i ty tha t p ledged US$656 m i l l i o n , inc lud ing US$175 m i l l i o n in budge t support, to support the 
PRSP f inanc ing gap. 

59 . 

Burundi i s one of the first beneficiaries of the UN Peace Building Commission (PBC). 
The P B C was es tab l ished in 2005 t o he lp p reven t a relapse t o c o n f l i c t by coo rd ina t ing and

Iv . IMPLEMENTATION OF THE INTER IM STRATEGY AND LESSONS LEARNED 

60. 
The Wo r ld Bank formulated the I S N as Burundi completed its successful transition to a 
multi-party government. Execu t ive D i rec to rs discussed the I S N in M a y 2005 . Par l iamen tary 
e lec t ions t o o k p lace a few mon ths later, in August 2005, and a new gove rnmen t t o o k o f f ice in 
September 2005 . 

61. 
I n this context, the I S N addressed immediate social needs while laying the foundation 
f o r sustainable economic growth. I t focused o n t w o m a i n ob jec t ives : (i) expand ing access t o basic 
soc ia l services and income-genera t ing ac t iv i t ies ; and (ii) deve lop ing the founda t ion f o r sustainable 
g r ow t h and pove r ty a l lev ia t ion . The I S N also a imed t o help Burundi reach the H I P C dec is ion po in t 
and move towa rds the comp le t ion po in t , and prepare a pa r t ic ipa to ry and inc lus ive PRSP. The I S N 
was a l igned with Burundi’s I n t e r im PRSP and re f lec ted consu l ta t ions with stakeholders. T o 
accomp l ish these objectives, the I S N env is ioned f inanc ia l assistance o f abou t U S $ I 7 0 m i l l i o n (grants 
under IDA 14), ana ly t ica l and adv iso ry ac t iv i t ies (AAA), and inc reas ing I F C reengagement. 

62. 
Overall implementation of the I S N i s satisfactory: Burundi has progressed towards the 
I S N objectives (see Annex 5). No tab ly , Burundi reached the H I P C dec is ion p o i n t in August 2005; 
and in September 2006, the gove rnmen t approved a pa r t ic ipa to ry PRSP, w h i c h was a key I S N 
outcome. 

I D A and Analytical and Advisory Activities 

63. 
The Bank has delivered a l l operations envisioned in the I S N . F r o m June 2005 to 
December 2007, the B a n k app roved f i v e IDA grants amoun t ing t o abou t US$170 m i l l i o n , inc lud ing 
an unforeseen reg iona l commun ica t ions in fras truc ture p ro jec t . The Bank ’s f inanc ing inc luded US$60

US$250 m i l l i o n . 

64. 
The Bank’s analytical and advisory activities informed the PRSP and underpinned 
investment operations and sector strategies. AAA inc luded : a study o n r u r a l sources o f grow th ; a

Lessons Learned 

70. 
Development policy operations have helped initiate key reforms and jumpstart the 
economy; but they must be sensitive to the fragile political environment and weak institutional 
capacity. A pos t -con f l ic t gove rnmen t with weak capac i ty and ope ra t ing in a f rag i le env ironmen t 
cannot be expected t o ca r ry o u t a b road and comp lex econom ic r e f o rm p rog ram . Econom ic re fo rms 
supported by deve lopmen t p o l i c y opera t ions shou ld be focused and rea l is t ic ; and the speed o f 
re fo rms needs t o take i n t o cons ide ra t ion the c o n f l i c t i n g interests o f stakeholders. Operations shou ld 
also be sens i t ive t o the need f o r in te rna l consensus. 

71. 
Public works have been effective in creating employment and consolidating peace; but 
they require close supervision. The Pub l ic Wo rks and Em p l o ym e n t C rea t ion Pro jec t (US$40 
m i l l i o n IDA c red i t in 2001 and add i t iona l gran t o f US$30 .6 m i l l i o n in 2006), was one o f the mos t

you th (age 15-30) w h o represent 3 0 percen t o f the popu la t ion . 

72. 
I t i s important to remain flexible and responsive to changing circumstances. In late 
2005, the Pres iden t o f Burundi in i t ia ted a p o l i c y o f free bas ic education, lead ing to a surge in demand 
f o r schoo l in f ras t ruc tu re and materials. The B a n k ad jus ted i t s inves tmen t p rog ram and accelerated the 
prepara t ion o f an educa t ion p ro jec t tha t became e f fec t ive in FY07. This dec is ion he lped pave the w a y 
f o r a mu l t i -dono r approach in the educa t ion sector, i n c l u d i n g the fo rmu la t ion o f a basket fund 
mechanism. 

73. 
A February 2008 client survey suggests that the Bank should work more closely with 
civil society and be more forceful in promoting transparency and good governance. K e y survey 
resu l ts , and compar isons t o 2005 survey resu l ts , are summa r ized in B o x 5. 

74. 
Independent Evaluations Group (IEG) project ratings have differed only slightly from 
Implementation Completion Report ratings, and have resulted in several important 
recommendations. The IEG has evaluated three p ro jec ts imp lemen ted during the I S N period-the 
Second H e a l t h and Popu la t ion Pro jec t ; the Second Soc ia l A c t i o n Pro jec t , and the Econom ic 
Recons truc t ion Credit-and 
gave each an ou tcome r a t i n g o f mode ra te ly satisfactory. These pro jec ts 
were executed in a d i f f i c u l t env i ronmen t ma rked by a p o l i t i c a l trans i t ion ; and a l l three pro jec ts 
encountered imp lemen ta t ion d i f f icu l t ies . IEG recommenda t ions inc lude : (i) ensure coherent r e s u l t s

donors (see Annex 10 for an overview o f donor assistance to Burundi). For example, the Bank will 
support urban water supply investments, while other partners support rural water supply investments. 
The Bank will encourage sector-wide approaches to maximize complementarity. 

8 1 . 

Enhance regional integration. As a small, landlocked country with limited natural 
resources, Burundi's development is linked to that o f its neighbors, and the government is thus keen 
to enhance regional integration. Its membership to the EAC since July 2007 provides a framework 
for promoting efficient transport services, increased agricultural exports, increased energy supply, 
and a stronger private sector. Burundi will also need to collaborate with its neighbors to address 
water resource management and migratory diseases such as HIVIAIDS and tuberculosis. Given 
Burundi's need to incorporate quickly into the EAC Customs Union, the Bank will help the EAC 
reduce barriers to trade, including non-tariff barriers, and to undertake informational activities, 
targeting customs officials in Burundi t o inform them on EAC protocol. 

Box 6: CAS Consultations 

The World Bank and the African Development Bank carried out joint consultations with stakeholders in Bujumbura 
in March 2008. Stakeholders emphasized the following challenges: security; reintegration of demobilized soldiers; 
governance/corruption; quality of leadership; and unemployment. 

'The private sector emphasized the difficult business environment, and discussed the need to strengthen the 
agricultural sector and diversify exports; develop the mining sector; reform and strengthen the financial sector; 
support micro, small, and medium enterprises; improve governance through more transparent procurement; and 
institutionalize dialogue between the government and private sector, which is currently nearly nonexistent. 

Civil society representatives noted the need to address corruption and improve governance and human rights; 
ensure that international assistance (including budget support) benefits provinces equitably; and educate the public 
about procurement procedures. Participants also recommended that donors involve civil society in the design of 
development projects, and urged the Bank to meet frequently with civil society to share information on project 
preparation and implementation. 

Governance-related institutions (State Inspector General, Court of Accounts, Anti-Corruption Court, and Anti- 
corruption Brigade) emphasized the need for capacity building and better public information. 

The four former presidents and the three main political parties emphasized security, good governance, and a 
well functioning judiciary a s prerequisites for private investment needed for economic growth and poverty 
reduction. They recommended more funding for basic infrastructure, especially roads to facilitate domestic and 
external trade. They urged special attention to reinsertion and reintegration o f demobilized soldiers. 

Government officials and members o f parliament emphasized: the need to fight corruption and impunity; 
modernize the civil service and build its capacity; strengthen agriculture; increase employment; support 
vulnerable groups, and help Burundi integrate to the EAC. Cabinet members provided overviews of their 
portfolios. Members o f parliament discussed the need to address high population growth, promote women's rights 
including access to land, and improve social services. 

International partners discussed the increased risks in delivering external assistance in the run up to the 2010 
presidential elections; and they noted the need for international assistance to build electoral capacity and help civil 
society monitor the electoral process. Donors noted the importance of: continued budget support, assisting 
regional integration, and strengthening agriculture, including the need to diversify and access niche markets and to 
c a n y out the agricultural census. Donors emphasized the need for closer donor coordination, including more joint 
missions, joint analytical work, and more sector-wide approaches. 

A s further input to CAS preparation, the World Bank engaged a local political scientist and an international political 
scientist to identify political economy issues relevant to CAS outcomes . Their political economy analysis informs 
the CAS, particularly the description o f development challenges, the design of the Bank's work program, and the 
identification and mitigation of risks. 

The Bank also organized a security and governance workshop in Bujumbura to seek input from civil society, 
academia, and government representatives on sources of conflict and links between conflict and governance.

I D A Resources 
I D A resources under the CAS are estimated at US%309 equivalent. As a pos t -con f l ic t 
country, Burundi i s cu r ren t ly rece iv ing a special IDA a l loca t ion based o n i t s Pos t -Con f l ic t 
Performance Ind ica to r (PCPI). In FY08 , Burundi rece ived a to ta l spec ia l IDA a l loca t ion o f special 
d raw ing rights (SDR) 53.1 m i l l i o n . During I D A 1 5 (FY09 -FY11 ) i t i s es t ima ted tha t Burundi w i l l 
rece ive a to ta l pos t -con f l ic t IDA a l loca t ion o f abou t SDR157 m i l l i o n (abou t US$253 m i l l ion ) , with 
an average annua l a l loca t ion o f abou t SDR 52 m i l l i o n (US$84 m i l l i o n ) . Howeve r , since Burundi i s 
cu r ren t ly in the phase-out p e r i o d o f the pos t -con f l ic t a l loca t ion , the annua l amounts w o u l d be higher 
in the ear ly years and l ow e r in the la ter years. In FY12 , Burundi w i l l rece ive the last year o f i t s 
special pos t -con f l ic t a l loca t ion , es t ima ted at around SDR 35 m i l l i o n (US$56 .3 m i l l ion ) , be fore i t w i l l 
graduate t o the n o rm a l Per formance-Based A l l o c a t i o n (PBA) amount, w h i c h depends o n annual 
Coun t ry P o l i c y and Ins t i tu t iona l Assessmen t (CP IA ) scores and IDA p r o j e c t p o r t f o l i o qua l i ty . The 
amounts f o r ou ter years are ind ica t ive on ly . The ac tua l annua l a l loca t ions during the C A S pe r iod w i l l 
depend on: (i) to ta l IDA resources ava i lab le and the numbe r o f pos t -con f l ic t and IDA-eligible 
countries; (ii) Burundi’s o w n per formance , as measured by i t s PCP I ; and (iii) Burundi’s performance 
re la t ive t o o ther I D A - e l i g i b l e and pos t -con f l ic t countries. The US do l la r equ iva len t o f any year’s 
SDR a l loca t ion depends o n the p r e v a i l i n g exchange rate. 

8 5 . 
T o increase I D A availability, the government needs to improve its performance, as 
measured by P C P I and C P I A scores, and the performance o f IDA-financed projects. W i thou t 
such an improvemen t , Burundi’s IDA a l loca t ion w i l l d rop once the pos t -con f l ic t IDA a l loca t ion 
phases ou t comp le te ly in F Y 1 2 . The C P I A assesses qua l i ty o f po l ic ies and ins t i tu t ions in three 
categories: econom ic management, po l ic ies fo r soc ia l inc lus ion and equ i ty , and pub l ic sector

Budget support. Development policy operations are expected to account for about 25-30 
percent o f annual IDA financing, supporting macroeconomic stability and PRSP implementation. 
The Second Economic Reform Support Grant (ERSG II), which w i l l be presented to the Bank’s 
Executive Directors together with this CAS, builds on the experience o f the ERSG (FY06) and 
focuses on three areas: (i) PFM reforms to improve transparency and accountability o f public 
spending; (ii) business and legal environment reforms to foster private sector development; and (iii) 
co f fee subsector reforms to increase exports and farmer incomes. The ERSG I1 i s the first in a 
programmatic series o f two grants. Based o n ERSG I1 and I11 experience, the Bank and the 
government w i l l design a second series fo r FY 1 1 and FY 12. The Bank w i l l continue to work c lose ly 
with other development partners involved in the “Partnership Framework” to improve the 
predictability o f budget support and lower transaction cos ts that tax Burundi’s limited capacity.

Strategic Objective Two: Improve Access to Social Services and Consolidate Social Stability 

107. Expected results. The World Bank Group will focus on three CAS outcomes: 
2.1 :Improved reintegration of ex-combatants and vulnerable groups; 
2.2:More efficient and transparent public financial management; 
2.3 Improved access to and quality of basic social services and decreased vulnerability to 
HIVIAIDS. 

Box 7: Youth in Burundi-A Force for Positive Change? 

According to international research, a large youth population, especially excluded young men, increases the risk of 
conflict. In Burundi, youth (ages 15-30 according to the government's official definition) constitute the largest 
segment of the population-30 percent. The World Bank recently completed a qualitative study to explore how youth 
are faring in post-conflict Burundi. The study collected data through 376 in-depth interviews. 

Findings: 

Employment emerged as a key priority and a main constraint. All economic categories of youth are facing 
barriers to securing a sustainable livelihood. 

Despite many hardships, young people remain a positive force in Burundi. They display remarkable levels 
of optimism, motivation, and perseverance. 

They also exlzibit a strong sense of citizenship. They voiced concern and often anger over issues of 
governance, accountability, and corruption; and they held strong views on combating corruption and 
cronyism. 

Tlre social reintegration of ex-combatants and child soldiers appears to have been positive overall. In both 
towns and villages, ex-combatants within the youth age category had strong positive social ties. 
These findings suggest that in Burundi, unlike many other countries, there may be a window o f opportunity to 

harness the positive values of youth to facilitate reconstruction, reconciliation, and good governance. 
Recommendations: 

Improve the quality and relevance of education. 

Help youtlt j ind a livelihood: (i) improve the formal and informal business environment; (ii) open pathways 
for jobs through public works; (iii) improve traditional apprenticeships; and (iv) provide microfinance and 
entrepreneurship training. 

Help young people form families: (i) increase access to sexual and reproductive health; and (ii) support youth 
training in parenting and life skills. 

Empower youtlr to exercise citizenship through social accountability interventions. 
Next steps: In July and August 2008, the World Bank and Government of Burundi will disseminate by radio the 
findings o f the youth study, together with the findings of the diagnostic study on governance and corruption. The 
Bank will also organize workshops to discuss study findings with development partners and national and 
international NGO s working on youth issues in Burundi, and with the UN Peace Building Fund, which has allocated 
US$4.1 million to a Youth Enterprise Development Project. The World Bank will seek to support youth 
employment under relevant IDA-financed operations, such as the Second Public Works Project (FY09) and the 
Agriculture Project (FY 10).

CAS Outcome 2.3: Improved access to and quality of basic social services and decreased 
vulnerability to HIV/AIDS 

1 13. Analytical and advisory activities. The Bank, working closely with government and other 
donors, completed a study on education in FY06. The study underpinned project preparation and 
provided the basis for an “education for a l l ” program to be supported by several donors through a 
basket fund mechanism. The Bank and the Ministry o f Health completed in FY06 an overall 
assessment o f the health sector to identify major needs. Recently in FY08, the Bank and the Ministry 
o f Health completed a Health Financing Study that assesses the challenges o f financing the sector, 
including f r e e services to women during delivery and children under five, and provides the basis to 
move toward a sector-wide approach. 

1 14. 
IDA-financed operations. The ongoing Community and Soc ia l Development Project, 
approved in FY07, helps establish a transparent and participatory mechanism to finance community 
subprojects on a demand-driven basis. I n the education sector, the ongoing Education Sector 
Reconstruction Project (FY07) aims to help the government implement i t s f ree primary school policy 
by building the capacity o f schools t o educate an increasing number o f students. The Bank’s 
Executive Directors approved a Second Multisectoral HIV/AIDS Project in May 2008. IDA 
financing for HIV/AIDS in Burundi i s relatively modest yet helps fill an immediate financing gap 
and i s one o f the only sources o f financing for certain prevention and multisectoral activities. The 
recently approved project builds on the successful experience o f the f i r s t Multisectoral HIV/AIDs 
Control and Orphans Project, implemented from FY02 to FY09. Under the CAS, the Bank and other 
partners w i l l move toward a sector-wide approach (SWAp) for the health sector. The Bank intends to 
finance a Health Project (FY09) to support the SWAP and help the government implement i t s policy 
o f eliminating health user fees for pregnant women and women under five. 

1 15. Regional operation. The ongoing HIV/AIDS Great Lakes Initiative Project (FY05) finances 
regional prevention activities targeting mobile and vulnerable groups, including refugees and 
transport sector workers, to stem cross-border transmission. 

1 16. Development partners. In the education sector, development partners, including Belgium, 
France, DBD, and UN agencies, have worked together closely, including through joint field 
missions, to establish a SWAP to support the government’s National Sector Plan, providing a model 
o f effective aid delivery fo r other sectors. In the health sector, main donors are Belgium, EU, DfID, 
GAVI, Global Fund, Switzerland, USAID, and UN Agencies, particularly, UNICEF, WHO, and 
UNFPA. The World Bank i s working closely with a l l partners t o move towards a SWAp, which w i l l 
comprise an agreement on financing the government’s health program, a single results matrix, and 
joint missions. The first partners’ joint mission in the sector took place in October 2007.

Box 8: Diagnostic Study on Governance and Co r rup t ion 

At the request o f the President o f Burundi, the Wor ld Bank Institute (WBI), w i th financial support from the 
Government o f Belgium, assisted the government to undertake a diagnostic survey on public experience and 
perception o f governance and anti-corruption (GAC) in Burundi. 
Under the leadership o f the M in is t ry o f Good Governance, the government established a GAC Steering Committee 
representing both government and c i v i l society to oversee the survey. An independent po l l ing fm initiated f ie ld 
work in November 2007, submitting questionnaires to over 3,000 people, including households, government 
officials, NGOs, and private en te rp r ise employees. 
Ma in perceptions of survey participants: 
Corruption i s a main concern and has increased in recent years. Corruption i s one o f the top five concerns 
o f a l l categories surveyed, along w i t h unemployment, poverty, access to land, and access to water and 
e l e c t r i c i t y . More than one h a l f those surveyed from NGOs, private en terpr ises , and pub l ic administration and 
more than one quarter from households believe that corruption has increased since the Arusha Peace 
Agreement. 
Access to basic services i s limited, and bribes for access are common. Mo re than h a l f the households 
surveyed reported unavailability or poor quality o f basic services. L e s s than 50% reported having access to sa fe 
drinking water, and indicated that bribes were needed to obtain access. 

Police, customs, tax collection, public procurement, and the justice system are particularly prone to 
corruption. The police were iden t i f ied b y a l l categories as the most frequent recipient o f bribes. 
Public officials are hired based on political party affiliation o r personal connections rather than technical 
competence. Also, bribes are pa id for some positions. Over 90% o f public employees surveyed believe that 
recruitment in their sector i s based on po l i t ica l criteria. 
Next steps: 
The GAC Steering Committee submitted the survey results to the Council o f M i n i s t e r s in June 2008 for approval. 
Following government approval, survey resu l ts w i l l be pub l ic ly disseminated through national workshops and local 
radio, together w i th the resu l ts o f the recent qualitative study on youth. On the basis o f the results o f the GAC survey 
and the PEMFAR, the government, in consultation w i t h c i v i l society, w i l l formulate a G AC strategy, including a 
short-term action plan w i t h measurable resu l ts . 
In response to survey results, the G AC Steering Committee proposed to apply the Rap id Results Initiative (see para. 
120) to education, justice, and the electricity and water u t i l i ty as an instrument to motivate and engage c i v i l servants 
to implement specific action plans that w i l l show improvements in the short term . 

Cross-Cutt ing Ob jec t ive : Gove rnance 

117. 
G i v e n the cross-cutting n a t u r e o f governance, the Bank w i l l address governance a t 
th ree levels: 

(i) At the project leve l , the B a n k w i l l ensure procedures and systems t o m i n im i z e f iduc ia ry 
and governance r i s k s inhe ren t in operations. In add i t ion , the B a n k w i l l imp rove the 
governance o f p ro jec ts themselves, inc lud ing ensu r ing compe t i t ive s ta f f recruitment, 
clear and transparent procedures, and pub l ic commun ica t ion o n p ro jec t budgets and 
ob jec t ives . A n n u a l CPPRs w i l l focus o n r e s u l t s and governance. 

(ii) A t the sector l e v e l , the B a n k w i l l help imp rove governance in sectors where the B a n k i s 
invo lved . F o r example, the recen t ly approved Mu l t isec to ra l Wa te r and E lec t r ic i ty 
In f ras t ruc tu re P ro jec t a ims t o strengthen f inanc ia l managemen t and accoun tab i l i ty o f 
REGIDESO, the p u b l i c utility f o r wa ter and e lec t r ic i ty . The B a n k w i l l encourage sector- 

- 2 9 - 

wide approaches 
tha t a i m t o strengthen 
ins t i tu t ions , systems, procedures, and 
transparency. Sec to r -w ide approaches w i l l also im p r o v e dono r coord ina t ion , avo id ing 
over laps o r incons is tenc ies tha t can weaken ins t i tu t ions . 

( i i i ) A t the macro leve l , the B a n k w i l l emphasize m o r e e f fec t ive and transparent pub l ic 
f inanc ia l managemen t (CAS Ou tcome 2.2) and w i l l h e l p strengthen core governance 
ins t i tu t ions . A lso , the B a n k w i l l assist the gove rnmen t deve lop in ear ly F Y 0 9 an upda ted 
governance and an t i -co r rup t ion strategy and p r i o r i t i z e d ac t ion p lan , using b o t h the 
recen t ly comp le ted P E M F A R and the d iagnos t ic study o n governance and co r rup t ion (see 
B o x 8). The B a n k w i l l also engage at the p o l i t i c a l l e v e l th rough h igh - leve l discussions to 
suppor t be t ter governance by m i n im i z i n g in ter ference in econom ic decisions. 

1 18. The Bank w i l l strengthen its partnerships with civil society, academia, think tanks, and 
the media to help increase the demand f o r good governance. The B a n k w i l l also encourage the 
design o f p ro jec ts tha t w o r k d i rec t ly with and strengthen represen ta t ive c i t izens ’ ins t i tu t ions , such as 
v i l lage counc i ls . You th , w h o have a s trong sense o f c i t izensh ip and v iews against corrup t ion , c o u l d 
con tr ibu te t o bringing abou t be t ter governance (see B o x 8). 

119. Under the CAS, I D A operations will identify contributions to improve governance and 
w i l l consider governance-related indicators. F o r example, the ongo ing Commun i ty and Soc ia l 
Deve lopmen t P ro jec t w i l l h e l p strengthen governance at the commune l e v e l , and w i l l t rack the 
transparency o f m ic rop ro jec t procuremen t , the u s e o f c omm u n i t y scorecards and other mechan ism 
fo r c i t izen feedback, and independen t med ia coverage and sc ru t iny o f p ro jec t - f inanced investments. 

120. The W B I w i l l continue to support leadership and better governance. The WBI, supported 
by a L I C U S Trust Fund, in t roduced the R a p i d Resu l ts In i t ia t ives (RRI) me thodo logy in late 2006 to 
he lp the p u b l i c adm in is t ra t ion lea rn h o w to tack le spec i f ic p rob lems and show r e s u l t s within 100 
days. The RRI me thodo logy i s be ing used t o imp rove governance in selected service de l ive ry sectors: 
water, e lec t r ic i ty , education, and jus t ice . RRI w i l l be expanded t o add i t iona l sectors and w i l l suppor t 
imp lemen ta t ion o f the G A C strategy. 

C. Strengthening Donor Harmonization 

121. Acknowledging the need to improve aid effectiveness, the government and donors have 
recently launched a new donor coordination structure. In la te 2005, the governmen t established a 
N a t i o n a l Comm i t tee o n Aid Coo rd ina t ion (ComitB N a t i o n a l de Coo rd ina t ion des Aides, CNCA ) , 
cha ired by the Second V i c e Pres iden t and comp r is ing several k e y ministers. However , l im i t e d 
capacity h inde red i t s a b i l i t y t o coord ina te and m o n i t o r dono r assistance. To strengthen C N C A 
capacity, the gove rnmen t es tab l ished a techn ica l - leve l C N C A Permanen t Secretariat in February 
2006. In M a r c h 2007, severa l donors h e l d a retreat in B u j um b u r a t o agree o n approaches to imp rove 
coord ina t ion . Dono rs and the governmen t reviewed Rwanda ’s experience with i t s Deve lopmen t 
Partner Coo rd ina t ion G roup . At the R o u n d Tab le mee t ing in M a y 2007, the governmen t announced 
the crea t ion o f a Partners’ Coo rd ina t ion G roup (PCG) t o ensure dono r a l ignmen t t o the PRSP, and t o 
build capac i ty o f l o c a l ins t i tu t ions t o m o n i t o r and evaluate progress towa rds the Paris Dec lara t ion . 
The C N C A was appo in ted as the Secretariat o f the P C G and i s respons ib le fo r i t s ove ra l l 
adm in is tra t ion . 

122. The PCG , which w i l l be operational by the end o f 2008, w i l l be structured in layers. 
Ministers w i l l cha i r m o n t h l y mee t ings tha t invo lve one o r m o r e representatives o f the dono r 
commun i ty . Qua r te r ly mee t ings , cha i red by the v ice-pres iden ts and attended by deve lopmen t 
partners, w i l l discuss PRSP imp lemen ta t ion . S treng then ing C N C A capac i ty i s k e y f o r the func t ion ing

are es tab l ish ing a basket fund t o be managed by the U N D P t o f inance the imp lemen ta t ion o f the 
C N C A ac t ion p lan , i n c l u d i n g techn ica l assistance. 

123. PCG effectiveness will depend on the availability o f coherent sector strategies. Sector 
strategies f o r education, health, and p u b l i c f inance managemen t have enab led good dono r 
coord ina t ion . Jo in t M em o r a n d um o f Unders tand ings (MOUs ) have been signed between the 
governmen t and re levan t donors f o r hea l th and budge t support. The M O U lays ou t the sector 
objectives, expected results, m o n i t o r i n g and eva lua t ion arrangements, and donors ’ comm i tmen ts f o r 
funding and techn ica l support. In order t o imp rove dono r coo rd ina t ion in o ther sectors, such as 
agriculture, transport, and p r iva te sector development, the gove rnmen t and donors have agreed t o 
speed up the fo rmu la t ion o f strategies. 

124. The government i s implementing a web-based aid management platform, in par tnersh ip 
with Deve lopmen t Ga teway and funded by the Sw iss Deve lopmen t Coope ra t ion and GTZ. The a i d 
management p la t fo rm , operated by the C N C A , w i l l h e l p the coun t ry p roduce aggregate repor ts o n 
ex terna l a i d and m o n i t o r a i d a l ignmen t with the PRSP and Strategic F ramewo rk f o r Peacebuilding. 

125. The Bank will support efforts to strengthen donor harmonization, in accordance with the 
Paris Dec la ra t ion o n A id E f fec t iveness and with the P r inc ip les f o r G o o d In te rna t iona l Engagement in 
F rag i le States (2005). A B a n k m iss ion w i l l take p lace in F Y 0 9 t o analyze cu r ren t a i d effectiveness 
and help the gove rnmen t m o n i t o r progress in re la t ion t o the five pa r tne rsh ip comm i tmen ts o f the 
Paris Dec la ra t ion . The Bank , with the suppor t o f a B e l g i a n trust fund, i s helping the PRSP secretariat 
imp rove the PRSP r e s u l t s f ramewo rk t o better m o n i t o r PRSP progress and link a i d t o na t iona l

lead dono r ha rmon iza t ion . 

D. Implementing and Monitoring the Country Assistance Strategy 

126. The Bank will continue to move away from stand-alone project implementation units 
(PIUs). Several ongo ing p ro jec ts are imp lemen ted th rough gove rnmen t structures, no tab ly the Road 
Sector Deve lopmen t P ro jec t and the n e w l y approved Mu l t isec to ra l E lec t r ic i ty and Wa ter Pro jec t . 

127. The Bank will continue to strengthen its Burundi Country Office. I t cu r ren t ly comprises 
twenty s t a f f and consultants, i n c l u d i n g specialists in DDR, economics, health, in fras truc ture , pove r ty 
mon i to r ing , pove r ty mon i to r ing , and procuremen t . In F Y 0 9 , the B a n k in tends t o add specialists in 
ag r icu l tu re and f inanc ia l management. As capac i ty increases, the B a n k w i l l con t inue t o devo lve 
p o r t f o l i o managemen t t o coun t ry o f f ice-based s ta f f . G i v e n Burundi’s cha l leng ing imp lemen ta t ion 
env ironmen t , i t w i l l also be impo r tan t t o ensure adequate budge t fo r p ro jec t prepara t ion and 
supervision. Jo in t supe rv is ion m iss ions with o ther deve lopmen t par tners w i l l increase a i d 
effectiveness and reduce transac t ion costs f o r the government, and c o u l d also be cos t e f fec t ive . 

128. The CAS Results Framework presents the results chain for the Bank’s program of 
support (see Annex 13). The C A S outcomes w i l l be mon i to red j o i n t l y by the B a n k and the 
governmen t over the C A S pe r iod . The f ramewo rk uses Burundi’s PRSP as i t s s tar t ing po in t , and 
na r rows d o w n the range o f ou tcomes t o those tha t the B a n k can demons trab ly in f luence over the 
C A S pe r iod . Since mos t o f the n e w opera t ions foreseen in this C A S w i l l likely n o t finish 
imp lemen ta t ion until a f ter 2012, resu l ts during this C A S p e r i o d w i l l come m a i n l y f r om existing 
operations and the qu icke r -d isbu rs ing in te rven t ions inc luded in the CAS . 

- 3 1 - 

129. The Bank will carry out annual results-based CPPRs, building on the matrix of actions 
from the recent CPPR. CPPRs w i l l be conduc ted with deve lopmen t par tners when possible. 
Qua r te r ly p o r t f o l i o rev iews w i l l take p lace with governmen t coun terpar ts t o assess imp lemen ta t ion o f 
the CPPR ac t ion p lan . 

130. The Bank will prepare a CAS Progress Report in 2010 to evaluate progress toward CAS 
outcomes and adjust strategy and program. The Progress R e p o r t w i l l be comp le ted a f ter 
Burundi’s na t iona l e lec t ions in 20 10 t o a l l o w cons idera t ion o f n e w gove rnmen t p o l i c y . Adjustments

VI. R I S K S AND MITIGATION 

13 1. 
There are high risks in the strategy o f m o v i n g f r o m pos t -con f l ic t rehab i l i ta t ion to economic

P A L I P E H U T U , the las t rebe l group, t o implement the 2006 cease f i r e agreement are a cause fo r 
cautious op t im ism . Suppor t f r o m the in te rna t iona l commun i ty i s cruc ia l , inc lud ing con t inued 
resources f o r demob i l iza t ion and re in teg ra t ion o f ex-combatants. The w i n d o w o f oppo r tun i ty m a y 
close rap id ly , however , as e lec t ions in 2010 m a y s t i r up tensions among commun i t ies and p o l i t i c a l 
groups. I t w i l l also be impo r tan t t o ca re fu l ly manage the return o f 120,000 re fugees , m a i n l y f r om 
Tanzania, ove r the next 24 -30 mon ths . 

133. Political instability, especially in the run up to elections in 2010, could hamper 
investment and structural reform. A l t h o u g h Burundi has made p o l i t i c a l progress since 2000, 
in terna t iona l experience ind ica tes tha t e lec tora l democracy per se does n o t reduce the risk o f con f l ic t ; 
and elections can some t imes increase con f l ic t risk. In t rapa r ty d iv is ions con t r ibu te to p o l i t i c a l 
ins tab i l i ty and lead t o frequen t changes in k e y techn ica l pos i t ions in the governmen t . The Bank ’s 
recent CPPR iden t i f ied gove rnmen t s ta f f tu rnove r as an imped imen t t o p ro jec t imp lemen ta t ion . The 
curren t p o l i t i c a l landscape underscores the impor tance o f ensuing b r o a d owne rsh ip o f re forms and 
investments. The B a n k w i l l also w o r k with the governmen t t o m i n im i z e changes in p ro jec t techn ica l 
staff. 

134. A weak governance environment constitutes another major risk f o r economic recovery 
and CAS implementation. I t unde rm ines s tab i l i ty , service de l ivery , and p r iva te sector development. 
Further high-level governance inc iden ts c o u l d disrupt budge t support, as happened in 2007. The 
governmen t has taken steps t o c lose PFM loopholes, but m u c h rema ins t o be done. In this context, i t 
i s cha l leng ing t o ensure tha t p ro jec ts adhere t o core f iduc ia ry and safeguard requirements. The B a n k 
w i l l m i t iga te f iduc ia ry and safeguard risks th rough close superv is ion and p o r t f o l i o mon i to r ing and by 
des ign ing p ro jec ts t o m i n im i z e f iduc ia ry weaknesses. 

135. The country’s medium-term economic outlook has significant downside risks. These 
inc lude poss ib le delays in k e y s truc tura l re fo rms tha t unde rp in the g r ow t h ob jec t ive . M ishand led 
in teg ra t ion i n t o the E A C c o u l d unde rm ine domes t ic tax co l lec t ion . The coun t ry i s at risk o f 
unsustainable debt dynam ics . Burundi’s dependency o n a i d makes i t vu lne rab le t o delays o r declines 
in donor assistance, such as the case in 2007, when a co r rup t ion scandal caused a de lay in comp le t ing 
the sixth and last r e v i ew o f the IMF PRGF arrangement, de lay ing a i d disbursements and 
comp l ica t ing budge t execu t ion . 

136. As a landlocked food-deficit country, Burundi i s particularly vulnerable to rising food 
and fuel prices. Soa r ing p r ices c o u l d fu r the r jeopa rd ize f o o d insecu r i ty and exacerbate ma lnu t r i t ion . 
They c o u l d also increase soc ia l tensions and intensify wage demands. The B a n k i s in the process o f 
submitting a p roposa l f o r Burundi t o the new G loba l F o o d C r is is Response P rog ram Trust Fund. 
Under the CAS , the B a n k w i l l h e l p boos t ag r icu l tu ra l supply by suppo r t ing investments that imp rove 
ag r icu l tu ra l p roduc t ion , p roduc t iv i ty , and d ive rs i f ica t ion . Deve lopmen t partners are assisting with 
targeted n u t r i t i o n programs .

137. Capacity risks. L im i t a t i o n s in the techn ica l capab i l i t ies o f the cab ine t and c i v i l service to 
design and imp lemen t the r e f o rm p rog ram are a source o f risk. The B a n k w i l l p rov ide hands-on 
suppor t t o authorities, i n c l u d i n g f r o m a strengthened W o r l d B a n k coun t ry o f f i c e in Bu jumbu ra with 
in te rna t iona l and loca l s ta f f cove r ing agr icu l ture , demob i l iza t ion and re in tegra t ion , health, p o r t f o l i o 
management, pove r ty mon i to r ing , procuremen t , and macroeconom ics . The B a n k w i l l also undertake 
a needs assessment t o p rov ide the basis fo r a strategic and coo rd ina ted capac i ty deve lopmen t 
program . 

138. Exogenous risks include weather, international prices, and security in neighboring 
countries. Wea ther cond i t ions have a s trong in f luence o n the ou tpu t o f the ag r icu l tu ra l sector, as 
demonstrated in 2003 and 2005. The proposed p rog ram in the ag r icu l tu re sector seeks t o reduce the 
impac t o f p o o r r a i n f a l l o n ag r icu l tu re by increas ing i r r i g a t i o n and d issem ina t ing drough t resistant 
plants, but this w i l l take t ime . Sharp p r i c e changes in w o r l d co f fee marke ts are d i f f i c u l t t o manage 
and absorb in a p o o r l y d ive rs i f ied economy . As a land locked coun try , Burundi i s a f fec ted by the 
secur i ty s i tua t ion in ne ighbo r ing coun tr ies . Recent events in K e n y a f o l l o w i n g the con trovers ia l 
e lec t ion h a d a nega t ive impac t o n the f l o w o f goods be tween Mombasa and Burundi. The donor

Annex 4: Status o f H I PC Completion Point Triggers 

Trigger 

Progress 

1 . PRSP: Preparation o f a full PRSP through a participatory process 
and its satisfactory implementation for one year, as evidenced by an 
Annual Progress Report that has been the subject o f analysis in a Joint 
S ta f f Advisory Note. 

2. Macroeconomic stability: Maintenance o f macroeconomic stability 
as evidenced b y satisfactory performance under the PRGF-supported 
program. 

3 . U s e o f budget savings resulting f rom HIPC-related debt-service 
re l ie f during the in ter im period: U s e o f budgetary savings from debt 
re l ie f in accordance w i th the priorities identified at the decision po in t 
and in the PRSP duly documented and discussed by a national 
Independent Oversight Committee on a semiannual basis. 

The government used a participatory process to prepare a full PRSP, 
which was published in September 2006 and discussed by the I M F 
and Wor ld Bank Boards in March 2007. The PRSP permanent 
secretariat i s preparing an annual progress report, and a first draft w i l l 
be available in mid-2008. 

Macroeconomic developments over the past two years have been in 
l i n e w i th the PRGF-supported program, which has remained on track 
except br ie f ly in mid-2007. The IMF concluded t h e sixth and last 
review o f the PRGF on January 22,2008. 

Budgetary allocations for p r io r i ty spending targeting pro-poor 
activities and projects have increased markedly. Since 2006, the 
government has allocated more than 70 percent o f H IPC budget 
savings to social sectors (education, health). The government 
reactivated the H IPC Independent Oversight Committee in mid-2007 
and i t now meets regularly. In February-March 2008, the government 
shared w i th development partners a draft report o f an audit o f H IPC 
spending, and circulated a revised version in M a y 2008. The report 
w i l l be finalized in July 2008. 

4. Public expenditure management: Establishment o f an integrated 
pub l ic expenditure computerized system that provides a budget 
monitoring and control system, in particular fo r poverty-related 
spending, and the production o f at least two quarterly budget 
execution reports based on the new un i f ied budget nomenclature. 

An integrated computerized expenditure management system 
(SIGEFI) was pu t in place in January 2006 using the new budget 
nomenclature. Quarterly budget execution reports have been produced 
s ince mid-2006. The government i s work ing to improve the SIGEFI 
system and the coverage and re l iab i l i ty o f the reports. 

5. Governance measures and the delivery o f services in key sectors: 
Completion for the education, health, and justice sectors o f (i) a 
budget tracking exercise (budget monitoring) o f pub l ic spending on 
the delivery o f pro-poor se rv ices ; (ii) an evaluation by users o f the 
quality o f services provided; (iii) an evaluation by providers o f 
constraints 
to effective delivery o f pro-poor services; and 
( iv) preparation o f an action plan to address problems identified. 

6. Demobilization: Execution o f the Na t iona l DDR Program in line 
w i th the pace and f ina l objectives set for th in the Le t te r o f 
Demobilization Po l icy to the Wo r ld Bank, dated 19 February, 2004. 

The surveys were completed b y year-end and the preliminary analyses 
b y end-February 2008. An action plan i s being prepared and w i l l be 
available in July 2008. 

The demobilization program made progress in 2004-05 but has 
experienced delays s ince then. B y November 2007, 24,105 persons 
had been demobilized. The objective, after integrating a l l forces, i s to 
reduce the army to 25,000 men. However, about 17,300 persons were 
absorbed in to a new national police force 
instead o f being 
demobilized. Plans are being 
finalized for a new round o f 
demobilization in 2008 (FNL excluded), covering about 3,500 from 
the army (FDN) and 4,500 from the national police. This wou ld 
reduce the F D N to about 25,000 and the police to about 15,000. 
Fo l low ing the M a y mission b y the Bank DDR team, the Bank i s 
evaluating the request o f the authorities to mod i fy the completion 
criteria o f this trigger in l igh t o f the s low implementation o f the D D R 
program, exacerbated by the A p r i l 2008 security situation.

7. Structural measures: Tendering for sale the state holdings in a 
majority o f coffee washing stations. 

8 . Social sectors 

Education: Increase in the gross national enrollment rate in primary 
schools from 74 percent in 2003/04 to 77 percent in 2006; and from 
16 percent in 2003/04 to 18 percent in 2006 in secondary schools, 
subject to the provision that the average increase in provinces w i th 
lower than average enrollment rates in 2004 must be higher than the 
increase in the national rate over the same time period. 

Health: Increase in the national immunization rate for children o f l e s s 
than one year o f age from 75 percent in 2004 to 85 percent in 2006, 
subject to the provision that the average increase in provinces w i th 
lower-than-average immunization rates in 2004 must be higher than 
the increase in the national rate over the same t ime period. 

9. Debt management: Production o f mon th ly external debt reports, 
including projections for the upcoming three months, for at least six 
months before the completion point. 

[n November 2006 the government approved a detailed action plan for 
*eform o f the coffee sector, elaborated w i th the support o f the Wo r ld 
Bank. The action plan included: (i) a study o f the competitiveness o f 
:he sector (done in 2007); (ii) identification and implementation of a 
strategy for the sale o f ma in assets; and (iii) drafting o f a liberalized 
legal, regulatory, and institutional framework for the sector. Actions 
( i i) and (iii) were delayed bu t are being reprogrammed. The authorities 
have recently requested that this trigger be redefined. The Bank and 
the Fund agreed. The Bank i s f ina l iz ing a proposal to redefine this 
trigger in coordination w i t h the authorities and the Fund. 

The elimination o f primary school fees in September 2005 resulted in 
a large increase in f i rs t grade enrollment, Primary school enrollment 
rose from an estimated 80 percent in 2003-04 to 85 percent in 2004- 
05, about 101 percent in 2005-06, and 118 percent in 2 0 0 H 7 . The 
enrollment in secondary school has reached 19 percent in 2 0 0 H 7 . 
Preliminary analysis o f regional enrollment rates (administrative) data 
provided b y the government indicates an improvement. 

In June 2006 the Burundian M in is t ry o f Health organized a national 
campaign for vaccination against measles w i th the support o f UN ICEF 
and WHO. At end-October 2007 preliminary data suggest BCG 
coverage at 71 percent; po l io 3 at 74 percent; DPT3 equivalent at 69 
percent; and measles at 30 percent. Data for 2006 a r e poor and not yet 
available for regional rates. Accord ing to the government, preliminary 
analysis o f regional immunization rates (administrative) data indicates 
an improvement. 
A l l the reports through February 2008 were provided. Reports s t i l l 
have re l iab i l i ty and coverage problems.
