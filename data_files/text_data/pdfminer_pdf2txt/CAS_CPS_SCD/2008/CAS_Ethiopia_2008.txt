EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

1. 

Th roughou t i t s recent history, whether under impe r ia l rule, t h e M a r x i s t m i l i t a r y 
regime (‘Derg’), or the current government, a recu r r ing theme has been E th iop ia ’s 
susceptibility t o various fo rms o f shocks. Because o f popu la t ion pressure , land 
degradation, and climate, E th iop ia i s fundamentally vulnerable t o weather-induced 
shocks, such as the severe drought o f 2002/03 ’. Despite these d i f f icu l t ies , E th iop ia has 
achieved remarkable progress in the last several years in t e rm s o f economic development, 
with GDP g r ow t h exceeding 11 percent f o r fou r straight years, and a ma jo r expansion in 
access t o p u b l i c services. 
An emerging ‘dual take-ofJ: ’ E th iop ia shows some signs o f hav ing en tered a new 
phase o f mo re r a p i d economic growth, while simultaneously experiencing what might be 
called a ‘service delivery take-off.’ I f this take -o f f proves t o be mo re than a short-term 
anomaly, E t h i o p i a c o u l d leave the r a n k s o f the poorest countries in the w o r l d sooner than 
might have been expected o n l y a short time ago. The basic challenge therefore for 
Ethiopia i s to sustain this dual take-off process that appears t o be in i t s early stages. 

.. 11. 

... 111. 

C rea t ing conditions fo r the emergence o f this ‘dua l t a k e - o f f was n o easy task, 
and sustaining i t w i l l be s t i l l mo re d i f f i c u l t . Successful imp lemen ta t ion o f several 
impo r tan t elements o f E th iop ia ’s pove r ty reduc t ion strategy, the P l a n f o r Accelerated and 
Sustainable Deve lopmen t t o End Poverty (PASDEP), w i l l be required. First, E th iop ia 
w i l l have t o s t r i k e a delicate balance in macroeconomic management between the need t o 
manage overheating o f the economy and sustaining g row th . Second, E th iop ia needs to 
stimulate a greater supply response t o the huge recent investments in phys ica l and human 
capital, w h i c h requ i res im p r o v i n g the investment c l ima te further f o r businesses o f a l l 
sizes and across sectors. Third, t o make the economic g r ow t h inclusive, i t i s impo r tan t to 
give targeted support t o t h r e e particular groups o f Ethiopians, women, youth, and food- 
insecure households. Fourth, o n the service de l ive ry front, t h e challenge n o w i s to 
complete the expansion o f access and beg in the mo re d i f f i c u l t task o f ra is ing quality, 
w h i c h requires n o t o n l y add i t iona l resources but also greater scope f o r loca l in i t ia t ives 
and decisions. F ina l ly , t h e sustainability o f the dua l take -o f f process in the longer t e r m 
w i l l also h inge o n E th iop ia ’s a b i l i t y t o overcome i t s fundamental vu lne rab i l i ty t o shocks 
by reversing the degradation o f land and water resources, fac i l i ta t ing movement o f some 
people ou t o f agriculture, and accelerating the ‘demographic transition’ with measures to 
reduce popu la t ion g row th . 

iv . 
Meeting the challenge o f sustaining the dua l t a k e - o f f process w i l l likely requ i re a 
shift f r om top -down t o mo re bo t tom -up and open approaches in many spheres. The 
Government’s p rog ram o f decentralization was indeed conceived as a way t o achieve 
such t rans fo rma t ion in the l o n g run. In deepening this process, E t h i o p i a w i l l have to 
overcome the legacy o f central con t ro l . A s im i la r challenge can be anticipated in m o v i n g 
towa rd a m o r e market-based economic management sys tem . 

Many dates in this document are aligned with the Ethiopian Fiscal Year (EFY). I n this case, 2002/03 
refers to EFY 1995 , or July 8,2002 t o July 7,2003.

v. 
The recent imp rovemen t in basic service delivery i s in i t s e l f an impo r tan t 
ind ica t ion that ‘governance’ has been im p r o v i n g in a c r i t ica l dimension; ins t i tu t iona l 
capabilities, especially at the l o c a l levels, seem t o be building up, and the f o rm a l 
processes o f c i t izen pa r t ic ipa t ion in l o c a l decision-making have been strengthened. 
Neve r the less , m u c h remains t o be done t o imp rove governance. Democ ra t ic practices at 
the loca l l e v e l need t o take deeper root. M o r e broadly, the med ia and c i v i l society 
organizations need t o mature and a greater space needs t o be created f o r them, and the 
effectiveness o f na t iona l l e v e l accountability mechanisms, such as parliamentary 
oversight committees, courts, and the p u b l i c audit system, need further strengthening. 
Progress in these areas w i l l na tu ra l ly take time, but i t deserves sustained attention as 
transparency and accountability a re c r i t ica l fo r sustaining the ‘dua l t a k e - o f f in the l o n g 

run. 

vi. 
The Bank’s assistance strategy. The Bank’s lending and non - lend ing activities 
w i l l be structured t o support E th iop ia in sustaining high l e v e l s o f investments in key areas 
(both phys ica l and human capital as well as ins t i tu t iona l capacity building), while 
addressing p r i o r i t y p o l i c y issues to m a x im i z e the impac t o f such spending. Specifically, 
this Coun t ry Assistance Strategy (CAS) aims t o support E th iop ia in ach iev ing fou r m a i n 
strategic objectives, consistent with PASDEP : (i) fos te r ing econom ic g row th , in order t o 
sustain the emerging economic ‘ t a k e - o f f ; (ii) im p r o v i n g access to a n d qu a l i t y o f bas ic 
service de l ive ry , in order t o sustain the emerging basic service “ t a k e - o f f ; (iii) reduc ing 
E th iop ia ’s vu ln e r ab i l i t y t o help imp rove prospects f o r sustainability; and (iv) fos te r ing 
im p r o v e d gove rnance t o support progress o n the previous three objectives and empower 
citizens, building o n the f ramewo rk se t f o r t h in the 2006 Interim Coun t ry Assistance 
Strategy (ICAS). After eight years o f absence, I F C plans t o increase i t s r o l e in he lp ing 
g r ow t h become mo re p r iva te sector-led by reestablishing i t s presence o n the g round and 
beginning mo re active engagement in k e y sectors. MIGA too i s exp lo r ing new 
opportunities t o support investment in E th iop ia . 

v i i . 
The Bank’s p rog ram fo r FY 2008 i s based o n an i n i t i a l IDA a l loca t ion o f SDR 
391 m i l l i o n , equivalent t o $635 m i l l i o n at current exchange rates. IDA amounts f o r FY 
2009 - FY 201 1 w i l l depend o n the f ina l iza t ion o f IDA 15 arrangements, Ethiopia’s 
p o l i c y and ins t i tu t iona l performance re la t ive t o other countries, p o r t f o l i o quality, pe r 
capita income leve ls , and population. The guiding p r inc ip le beh ind the selection o f IDA 
interventions w i l l be the extent t o w h i c h they can contribute in a demonstrable manner to 
the 26 core outcomes that w i l l measure the Bank’s performance in reaching the CAS ’S 
strategic objectives. 

... v i i i . 

Though ambitious in scope, the pursuit o f the CAS ’S strategic objectives m a y be 
aided by opportune cu r ren t trends, w h i c h suggest that E th iop ia m a y be b reak ing with the 
past in impo r tan t ways. M a n y opportunities fo r change are embedded in the b road 
strategic directions articulated in PASDEP-including 
the opportunities p rov ided by the 
current process o f deepening decentralization, plans f o r economic empowerment o f 
women and youth, and an emerging s h i f t in the dynamics at l o c a l government levels, with 
a younger generation o f mo re educated and open administrators. In ce r ta in areas, such as 

.. 11 

reforms in the bank ing and telecommunications sectors and the encouragement o f more 
p r iva te sector inves tmen ts in infrastructure, the re are some differences o f views between 
the Government and the Bank o n the approach. The B a n k w i l l continue a dialogue with 
Government t o seek t o n a r r ow the gap between these differing views. 

i x . 
Risks. Impressive as economic performance has been f o r t h e last fou r years, i t 
seems inev i tab le that there w i l l be another severe weather-induced shock sooner o r later. 
The increasing expo r t o r ien ta t ion o f Ethiopia’s economy also m a k e s i t l e s s immune to a 
s lowdown o f the g loba l economy. Moreover, the re are sources o f reg iona l ins tab i l i ty in 
the H o r n o f A f r i c a that c o u l d emb ro i l E th iop ia in armed con f l ic ts . Ethiopia’s a b i l i t y to 
avo id cos t ly shocks where possible, and m i n im i z e the impac t o f adverse events, w i l l be 
c r i t ica l in p ro tec t ing the current v i r tuous c i rc le o f development progress. The Bank has 
built (and w i l l continue t o build) f l e x i b i l i t y in to i t s lending p o r t f o l i o so that i t i s better 
able to he lp E th iop ia cope with external shocks. F ina l ly , E t h i o p i a i s in some ways s t i l l a 
pos t -con f l ic t na t ion (hav ing experienced tw o ma jo r con f l ic ts in the last t w o decades), 
with many unresolved p o l i t i c a l tensions. The country’s a b i l i t y t o find peaceful ways t o 
overcome the i n h e r e n t r isks , while ma in ta in ing i t s focus o n pove r ty reduction, w i l l be 
another impo r tan t challenge. Some o f these r i s k s are c lea r ly p o l i t i c a l o r have strong 
p o l i t i c a l e lemen ts . The Bank w i l l continue to w o r k closely with the b road international 
commun i ty t o help m i t iga te such r i s k s , while p l a y i n g a lead ing r o l e in advancing the core 
development agenda in a w a y that i s increasingly harmonized.

I. INTRODUCT ION 

1. 
The last W o r l d B a n k strategy f o r Ethiopia, the I n t e r im Coun t ry Assistance 
Strategy ( ICAS ) cove r ing FY 2 0 0 6 and FY2007, was discussed by the B o a r d o n M a y 25, 
2006. The I C A S was developed in the aftermath o f the disputed 2005 parliamentary 
elections, w h i c h demonstrated b o t h the promise and the r i s k s inherent in Ethiopia’s 
democratic transition. In this context, the strategy a imed t o support the Government o f 
E th iop ia (GoE) in deve lop ing and implementing, in consu l ta t ion with citizens, a 
strengthened p rog ram o f ins t i tu t ion building and governance r e f o rm that w o u l d help in i t s 
efforts t o accelerate p ro -poo r growth, while simultaneously con t inu ing t o imp rove basic

M o r e than a decade and a h a l f has passed since the current E th iop ian People’s 
Revo lu t iona ry Democ ra t ic F ron t (EPRDF) government t o o k power. In this time the 
EPRDF - led regime has sh i f ted f r om a r e b e l movement t o a dom inan t p o l i t i c a l party. The 
current government has h a d notable success in reversing m a n y o f the econom ica l ly 

disastrous po l ic ies o f the p rev ious Marxist m i l i t a r y reg ime and implementing a p rog ram 
o f decentralization o f responsibilities fo r basic service delivery to sub-national 
authorities. Tentative strides have been made in the l o n g t e r m shift f r om a h i g h l y 
centralized, autocratic environment to an evo lv ing democratic state-though 
this shift has 
been characterized by a recu r r ing cycle o f opening and c los ing o f p o l i t i c a l space. 

5 . 

The current p o l i t i c a l landscape remains co lo red by the aftermath o f the M a y 2005 
parliamentary elections. While the country i s peaceful and oppos i t ion leaders have been 
released f r om ja i l , the r i f t s exposed and deepened during t h i s time are la rge ly unhealed. 
Oppos i t ion parties are characterized by their youth, weak capacity, undeveloped p o l i c y 
agendas, and l a c k o f broad-based support across ethnic group and geographical 
boundaries. As a consequence, nea r ly th ree yea rs after the disputed elections, the largest 
oppos i t ion grouping, the C o a l i t i o n f o r Unity and Democracy Pa r ty (CUDP), has split in to 
a number o f discordant factions. D e s p i t e the weakened cond i t ion o f the opposition, the 
Government continues to face a t rade -o f f between increasing openness and pa r t ic ipa t ion 
(with l ike ly pos i t ive effects f o r development and growth, at least in the longer te rm ) and 
an aversion t o risking a l o s s o f s tab i l i ty and con t ro l . E f fec t ive management o f this 
t radeo f f w i l l pose a s ign i f ican t challenge, with possible imp l ica t ions f o r Ethiopia’s 
g r ow t h and pove r ty reduc t ion performance in the com ing years. 

6. 
The trajectory o f E th iop ia ’s democratic t rans i t ion w i l l be shaped by the upcom ing 
l o c a l elections, scheduled f o r April 13 and April 20,2008, and the next round o f 
parliamentary elections, scheduled fo r 20 10. The loca l elections-which 
oppos i t ion 
groups have warned that they m a y b o y c o t t - c o u l d be a key step in the process o f 
democratic decentralization, and may have imp l ica t ions f o r the leg i t imacy o f the sub- 
na t iona l governments that h o l d the respons ib i l i ty f o r basic service delivery in Ethiopia’s 
federal system. B o t h 2008 and 20 10 elections cou ld n o t o n l y be o f ma jo r importance 
f r om a p o l i t i c a l standpoint, but also f r om a societal one. The perceived fairness o f the 
electoral processes w i l l in f luence whether the societal d iv is ions revealed after the 2005 
elections w i l l f la re up again, or begin to heal. 

7. 

Tensions between E t h i o p i a and E r i t rea rema in at heightened levels, and E th iop ian 
troops rema in continue t o be engaged in Somalia. While the mos t l ike ly near-term 
scenario f o r b o t h o f these flashpoints i s fo r a con t inua t ion o f the status quo, e i the r 
s i tua t ion cou ld escalate abruptly, whereas a reso lu t ion w o u l d appear t o requ i re a m u c h 
longer process in e i the r case. Domestically, the E th iop ian military i s ca r ry ing out an

th ree o f these situations are closely intertwined, and they i n d i v i d u a l l y and co l lec t ive ly 
have the po ten t ia l t o have severe consequences fo r development, stability, and economic

Macroeconomic context. E th iop ia i s experiencing an unprecedented s p e l l o f

l e v e l o f income that i s about 43 percent higher than the l e v e l p reva i l ing at the end o f the 
1990s ( f igu re 1). Yet g i v e n the extremely l o w i n i t i a l per capita income, the country 
remains one o f the poorest in the world, underscoring the urgency o f accelerated g row th 
and development o n a sustained bas is3 Moreover, the economy faces several r isks , e.g., 
double-digit in f la t ion , that imply that the understandable op t im ism over recent g row th 
should be moderated by cau t ion over the po ten t ia l threats t o sustained economic 
expansion.

The current b o om i s a comb ina t ion o f cyc l ica l recovery and structural s h i f t s in the

clearly raised the ove ra l l p r o d u c t i v i t y o f the economy. M o s t macro ind ica to rs inc lud ing

Econom ic g r ow t h has been broad-based. In contrast t o the p u b l i c sector

driving force behind the current expansion-accounting

Agriculture, w h i c h accounts f o r 46 percent o f GDP and nea r ly 85 percent o f employment, 
has g rown at 13 percent per year since 2003/04. The higher ag r icu l tu ra l g row th has come 
la rge ly th rough increased area expansion ( f o l l ow i n g the 2002/03 drought) as well as 
though h ighe r y ie lds in selected crops. This has helped E t h i o p i a t o gradually diversify i t s 
exports to non - t rad i t iona l products l i k e f lowe r and agro-based products. The services 
sector, w h i c h accounts f o r 42 percent o f aggregate output, has g r ow n at 12 percent per

E th iop ia 's strong economic performance can be a t t r ibu ted t o a comb ina t ion o f 
several factors: imp rovemen ts in structural policies, strengthening o f economic 
institutions, and some good luck . Ta r i f fs and non-trade barriers have been s ign i f ican t ly 
reduced, m a n y sectors have been opened f o r domestic and fo re ign investors, and land 
market distortions are being g radua l ly addressed. Reg iona l states have been given

The favorable g loba l environment, generous debt w r i te -o f f , large and increasing O f f i c i a l 
Development Assistance (ODA) and remittances, and a l o n g s p e l l o f good weather have 
a l l p layed impo r tan t ro les in m o v i n g E th iop ia to a higher g r ow t h trajectory, though these 
favorable factors have been offset t o some extent by the rising p r ice o f o i l , o f w h i c h 
E th iop ia impo r ts a l l o f i t s consumption. 

12. 
However, the good g r ow t h performance has been accompanied by some 
economic developments that cou ld pose r i s k s t o sustained economic g r ow t h and pove r ty 
reduction. First, i n f l a t i o n has been in double digit figures f o r the last t h r e e years, with 
f o o d prices g r ow i n g at an annualized rate o f 24 percent in recent months. The 
d is t r ibu t iona l impac t o f f o o d p r ice increase has been m ixed .5 M a n y r u r a l dwellers (most 
o f w h om are engaged in agriculture) have benefited f r om the p r ice r ise , but u rban 
inhabitants have seen a s ign i f ican t increase in their cost o f living. The m a i n factors 
unde r ly ing i n f l a t i o n are: r a p i d g r ow t h o f money supply, rising f o o d demand caused b y 
strong economic g r ow t h that has exceeded r i s e s in ag r icu l tu ra l p roduc t iv i ty , 
imperfections in ag r icu l tu ra l ma rke t ing and continued g loba l in f la t ion . The Government 
has recently announced new measures t o combat in f la t ion , inc lud ing l i f t ing taxes o n 
grains, tightening the mone ta ry supply, and investigating anti-competitive practices by 
f o o d traders. 

13. 
Second, E t h i o p i a has benefited f r om the l o n g s p e l l o f good weather, but recent 
h is to ry shows that this i s unlikely to last indefinitely. E th iop ia should therefore be 
prepared f o r a cyc l ica l change in weather that cou ld r e s u l t in a g r ow t h slowdown. In the 
even t o f a r a i n f a l l shock, g iven that output f r om crops accounts f o r 30 percent o f GDP, a 
10 percent decline in c rop p roduc t ion f o l l ow i n g a drought cou ld reduce 3 percentage 
po in ts f r om the GD P g r ow t h rate. M a j o r b i la te ra l donors have already announced g loba l 
cutbacks in f o o d a i d due t o higher f o o d prices, w h i c h c o u l d constrain the response t o 
increased f o o d insecu r i ty in a future drought. 

14. 
Third, E t h i o p i a impo r ted nearly US$875 m i l l i o n w o r t h o f crude o i l in 2006/07, up 
f r om $3 11 m i l l i o n in 2003/04. A further 20-30 percent increase in p r ice o f o i l f r om their 
current l e v e l cou ld increase the im p o r t b i l l by as m u c h as US$175-260 m i l l i o n annually. 
With ha rd currency rese rves hav ing been reduced t o o n l y t w o months o f imports, a 
further increase in o i l prices cou ld be de t r imen ta l to the balance o f payments situation. 
O n the f isca l side, the bu rden o f f u e l subsidies i s becom ing increasingly large despite 
moves in recent years t o pass th rough some o f the g loba l pe t ro leum p r ice increases t o 
consumers. Be tween Ju ly 2007 and February 2008, f u e l subsidies amounted t o about 
$23 0 m i l l i o n . Desp i te the subsidies, consumers (pa r t icu la r ly the u rban middle class, 
w h i c h i s already being hit by higher f o o d prices) are s t i l l fee l ing strong direct and ind i rec t

ma in ta in ing an accommodative environment f o r continued growth. While the recent 
economic performance has p r o v i d e d some cushion against future shocks, E th iop ia needs 
to rema in watchful against these emerging r i s k s and take preemptive actions in order to 
sustain i t s long - te rm g r ow t h po ten t ia l o f 8-10 percent per annum. 

16. 
Fiscal context. In recent years, E th iop ia has ma in ta ined a prudent f isca l stance 
by keep ing i t s aggregate spending l e v e l consistent with i t s to ta l revenue and grants. The 
f isca l de f ic i t ( inc lud ing grants) f e l l f r om 3 .9 percent o f GDP in 2005/06 t o 3.1 percent o f 
GDP in 2006/07--its 
lowes t l e v e l since 2003/04 (see table 1). F isca l p o l i c y has been 
increasingly counter-cyclical-relatively 
l o w de f ic i t during b o om times and high de f ic i t 
during periods o f downturn-a sharp contrast t o the p ro -cyc l ica l f isca l p o l i c y seen in 
mos t developing countries. E th iop ia 's expenditure performance generally has been 
strong - especially o n p ro -poo r spending and reduc t ion in debt obligations. As shown in 
table 1, p ro -poo r spending has been high and rising, and represents among the highest 
efforts among a l l l o w income countries. Government has also managed a high l e v e l o f 
f isca l d isc ip l ine by ensuring that the dev ia t ion between the budgeted and actual de f ic i t i s 
kept small. M o r e than h a l f o f i t s to ta l spending i s fo r investment purposes 
(approximately U S $ 2 b i l l ion ) , an ind ica t ion o f the huge scale o f infrastructure in roads, 
energy, i r r i g a t i o n and the urban sector that are likely t o be available soon t o support the

Over the past decade E th iop ia has made s ign i f ican t strides in im p r o v i n g the l i v i n g 
standards o f i t s citizens. Househo ld survey evidence suggests that between 1999100 and 
2004/05, rea l to ta l expenditure per capita grew by 19 percent (1 5 percent with respect to 
1995/96). This has resu l ted in s ign i f ican t reductions in pove r ty : the headcount f e l l by 
12.4 percentage po in ts between 1999/00 and 2004/05, and by 18.5 percentage points 
since the m id -1990s (see table 2). The pove r ty headcount ra t io must have declined 
further f o l l ow i n g three years o f double digit g row th after the 2004105 household survey. 
Desp i te this progress, monetary pove r ty remains a s ign i f ican t challenge, pa r t icu la r ly

Progress in pove r ty reduc t ion across urban and r u r a l areas has been uneven6. 
While urban areas con t r ibu ted an estimated 60 percent o f economic g r ow t h over the 
decade up t o 2004/05, they saw stagnant pove r ty reduction. This seems t o have been 
driven by a “U-shaped” incidence o f growth, with households b o t h in the top and bo t tom 
twenty percent o f the d is t r ibu t ion experiencing strong and pos i t ive growth, with l i t t l e or 
even negative g r ow t h fo r the middle o f the d is t r ibu t ion . This resu l ted in l i t t l e g row th 
around the p o v e r t y l i n e , and raised income inequality. I t seems likely that u rban areas o f 
different types fa red differently over the pe r iod - indeed evidence f r om pane l data in the 
seven la rges t c i t ies po in ts t o uneven trends in inequa l i ty across urban areas, and t o a 
greater va r iab i l i ty in the inequa l i ty trends than i s revealed by na t iona l household surveys .

possible drivers o f these developments. Changing r e t u r n s t o assets, and pa r t icu la r ly t o 
primary education (with a g r ow i n g number o f heads with completed p r ima ry education 
living in poverty), might have also driven the r ise in inequality. While n o household data 
f o r the pe r iod after 2005 are available, simulations suggest that the recent increase in 
f o o d prices might have s ign i f ican t ly contributed t o worsening the we l fa re o f the urban 
poo r over the last t w o years.

D e s p i t e l e s s r a p i d growth, pove r ty reduc t ion has been mo re ma rked in r u r a l areas, 
where, given the l o w u rban iza t ion rate in Ethiopia, nearly 80 percent o f the poo r live. 
The 6 percentage p o i n t decline in r u r a l pove r ty between 1999/00 and 2004/05 suggest 
that those at the l o w t a i l o f the d is t r ibu t ion have been able t o bene f i t f r om ag r icu l tu ra l 
g row th . After a decade o f balanced g row th across a l l income groups, inequa l i ty has 
remained l o w and stable in r u r a l areas, with a Gini coe f f ic ien t o f 0.26. Panel data, 
however, reveals greater heterogeneity in these trends, with s ign i f ican t income m o b i l i t y 
and reversals o f fortunes over the decade up t o 2005 in r u r a l areas. Further, even areas 
g r ow i n g high po ten t ia l export crops (such as coffee o r chat) we re found in some years to 
experience higher poverty, due t o the drought. I t seems l ike ly , therefore, that the muted 
impac t o f the high g r ow t h that E th iop ia started experiencing since 2003/04 partly reflects 
the high vu lne rab i l i ty that continues to characterize ru ra l areas.

The progress in reduc ing pove r ty i s m i r r o r e d in s ign i f ican t gains in human 
development indicators, with a l l key M i l l e n n i um Development Goa l (MDG) indicators

Desp i te the recent socio-economic progress, s ign i f ican t challenges rema in and 
new ones have emerged. Gender d ispa r i ty i s an example o f a p e r s i s t e n t challenge: in 
r u r a l areas female-headed households are mo re likely to be poor, and are also mo re likely 
t o stay poo r over time than their male-headed counterparts. Further, desp i te a massive 
increase in female enrolment in secondary education, a p ow e r f u l means t o escape 
poverty, the gender gap has widened. 

24. 
The HIV/AIDS epidemic appears t o have stabilized and m a y even b e dec l in ing in 
urban areas, though i t remains a ma jo r concern. However, signs p o i n t t o increasing 
in fec t ion rates in r u r a l areas, pa r t icu la r ly sma l l towns, w h i c h i s o f serious concern since 
the large m a j o r i t y o f the popu la t ion l i v e s outside o f u rban areas. R u r a l prevalence varies 
among regions, with mos t regions hav ing a re la t ive ly l o w prevalence o f HIV, but a few 
demonstrating prevalence rates greater than five percent. One o f the mos t c r i t ica l 
manifestations o f the epidemic i s the rising number o f HIV/AIDS orphans, thought t o 
number 750,000 in 2005. 

25. While vu lne rab i l i ty i s v e r y high in b o t h urban and r u r a l areas, there are concerns 
about the persistence o f pove r ty in r u r a l areas. This appears t o be driven by the l o w 
p roduc t iv i ty o f subsistence agriculture, increasing fragmentation o f r u r a l land-holdings, 
the r i s k s posed by s o i l nutrient dep le t ion and environmental degradation, and the 
d i f f icu l t ies in connecting farmers t o markets and p r o v i d i n g them with market 
in fo rma t ion . The l o w l e v e l s o f inequa l i ty identified in r u r a l areas might also re f lec t the 
d i f f icu l t ies o f generating rea l dynam ism and opportunities f o r d ive rs i f ica t ion outside o f

111. ANALYS IS OF DEVELOPMENT CHALLENGES 

A. Central Challenge in the Short to Medium Term 

26. 
Under i t s t w o pove r ty reduc t ion strategies, the Sustainable Development and 
Poverty Reduc t ion P rog ram (SDPRP) and PASDEP , E th iop ia has achieved significant 
r e s u l t s in economic g r ow t h and p rov is ion o f basic services. Indeed i t seems that E th iop ia 
may be experiencing n o t o n l y the possible beginning o f an economic take-off, but also 
what might be ca l led a ‘service de l ive ry take-off..’ The basic challenge f o r Ethiopia at 
present i s to sustain the dual take-off process that appears t o be getting underway. 
L o o k i n g ahead, i t i s clear that E th iop ia needs t o contend with a number o f challenges in 
this regard. 

27. 
Economic take-offi H a v i n g invested heav i ly in phys ica l infrastructure and 
human resources ove r the last decade, the economy has achieved an unprecedented l e v e l 
o f economic g r ow t h over the last fou r years. Sustaining the r a p i d g r ow t h and creating 
large numbers o f j o b s are c r i t ica l f o r n o t o n l y pove r ty reduc t ion but also social and 
p o l i t i c a l stability. The sustainability o f this impressive growth, however, i s n o t assured. 
E th iop ia w i l l have t o address several challenges in b o t h the short and medium t e rm . 

28. 
In the near te rm , macroeconomic management w i l l pose a challenge, as was 
already po in ted ou t in the economic developments section. With strong demand 
stimulus, driven b o t h by the general r i s e in incomes and amb i t ious investments, 
in f la t iona ry p ressu re has built up. Mode ra t ing this w i thou t de ra i l ing the g r ow t h process, 
especially in the con tex t o f rising international p r ices o n petroleum, grains, construction 
materials, fertilizers, and other key commodities, w i l l demand s k i l l f u l stewardship o f 
macroeconomic po l ic ies . Possible turbulence in the g loba l economy as we l l as any 
weather-induced shock c o u l d further complicate this task. 

29. 
In the medium te rm , E t h i o p i a w i l l have to face some structural issues . While 
pub l ic investment has increased f r om 12.8 percent o f GDP in 2002/03 t o 18.2 percent in 
2006/07, p r iva te inves tmen t has fa l len as a share o f GDP, f r om 9.0 percent t o 6.7 
percent7. Given the immense needs f o r infrastructure investment, this increase in pub l ic 
investment i s appropriate and has contributed to accelerated g row th . In the longer te rm , 
however, p r iva te inves tmen t needs t o g row mo re rap id ly t o sustain r a p i d growth. D e s p i t e 
some adverse developments (such as h i g h prices o f o i l and cons t ruc t ion materials), i t 
seems that external factors have been o n balance favorable (good weather, r i s e in 
remittances and aid, buoyan t commod i ty prices, economic globalization, move towa rd 
reg iona l integration, etc.) and have also contributed t o the current economic boom. Many 
high g row th episodes have benefited f r om such accidental factors in the i n i t i a l stages. 
However, turning such serendipitous beginnings i n t o a v i r tuous c i rc le o f sorts requ i res a 
se t o f sound po l ic ies . 

As noted earlier, private investment i s measured as a residual item in national income accounts and 
therefore the limitations o f the data should be noted. The possibility o f private investment being 
underestimated cannot be ruled out. 

10 

30. 
Heavy investment in recent years has created many new economic opportunities 
for the p r iva te sector, yet the p r iva te sector has n o t responded as strongly as cou ld have 
been hoped. E l i c i t i n g a mo re robust supply response therefore must be at the heart o f the 
g r ow t h agenda. G o E po l ic ies have tended t o favo r a na r row range o f industries and 
larger investors. There i s a strong case fo r creating a mo re l e v e l p l a y i n g field fo r a l l 
investors. This i s l i k e l y t o help E th iop ia sustain r a p i d g r ow t h and make the economy 
mo re res i l ien t to external shocks. 

3 1. 

G i v e n the reliance o f the m a j o r i t y o f the popu la t ion o n agriculture and l ives tock 
as the mainstay o f their livelihoods, E th iop ia needs also t o raise the p roduc t iv i ty o f 
agriculture t o broaden the base o f growth. The Government has recognized this by 
m a k i n g agriculture a central focus o f i t s development strategy. Yet, ove ra l l p roduc t iv i ty 
in th is sector has n o t g r ow n significantly,' 
leav ing a large numbe r o f households 
ch ron ica l ly dependent o n f o o d assistance. In order t o raise the b o t t om o f the g row th 
base, stronger support to the agriculture and l ives tock sectors seems warranted. At the 
same time, E th iop ia 's in f ias t ruc tu ra l endowment remains l o w despite recent increases in 
l e v e l s o f investment, so E th iop ia clearly needs t o continue investing in expansion and 
upg rad ing o f basic infrastructure as well. 

32. 

F o r g r ow t h t o be inc lus ive and pove r ty reducing, E th iop ia w i l l need to address 
three special issues . First, some 8.3 m i l l i o n Ethiopians rema in mo re o r l e s s perennially 
dependent o n f o o d security programs, and several m i l l i o n mo re are susceptible t o food 
insu f f ic iency in the even t o f adverse c l ima t ic shocks. They tend t o be in very weak 
pos i t ions t o share in the b e n e f i t s o f r a p i d macroeconomic g row th . B u i l d i n g o n existing 
programs such as the P roduc t ive Safety Ne ts and the Food Security programs, a more 
comprehensive strategy needs t o be developed t o l i f t this mos t vulnerable segment o f the 
popu la t ion ou t o f the pove r ty trap and put them o n a sustainable pa th towa rd be t te r 
economic l i v e s . Second, a rap id ly g row ing number o f young E th iop ians with high school 
l e v e l education face unemployment. L ikew ise , despite s ign i f ican t progress in the social 
ou t look o n gender issues , women rema in at a disadvantage in pursuing economic 
opportunities. I f the coun t ry i s n o t able t o engage these t w o groups in mo re p roduc t ive 
economic activities, the r e s u l t w o u l d be an i m m e n s e waste o f resources, a loss o f growth, 
as well as possible social tensions. Third, though m u c h smaller in scale, the re i s g row ing 
evidence that poo r households in urban areas experience serious f o o d shortage and other 
stresses. W h i l e the r u r a l poo r have been supported by various safety n e t programs, their 
u rban counterparts have n o t received comparable help. With ru ra l -u rban m ig ra t ion 
increasing, p r o v i d i n g some f o rm o f safety n e t f o r this group as well may be important. 

33. 
Service delivery take-ofl: Th rough massive increases in p ro -poo r spending, 
rud imen ta ry infrastructure has been put in place f o r basic education, basic hea l th care, 
and ag r icu l tu ra l services. Mode ra te ly trained f ron t - l ine service p rov ide rs (teachers, 
development agents, and hea l th extension workers) are in place at the kebele (ward) l e v e l . 
Supported by the P ro tec t ion o f Bas ic Services (PBS) P ro jec t and the Pub l ic Sector 

There are, however , m a n y sm a l l pocke ts where e f fec t ive ex tens ion services and i n t r o d u c t i o n o f 
techno logy have ra ised p r o d u c t i v i t y sharply. The k e y i s to expand such successes m o r e w i d e l y . 

11 

Capacity Building P rog ram (PSCAP), decentralization has p layed a c r i t ica l r o l e in this 
process. This has imp roved access t o basic services at an unusua l ly r a p i d pace and to a 
very s ign i f ican t extent, but qua l i ty remains a concern. Yet, the re i s a widespread sense 
that with a few mo re resources and greater space f o r loca l decision making, n o t on ly 
access but quality, too, can begin t o imp rove sharply. I t appears that E t h i o p i a may be o n 
another pa th o f take-off, but t o achieve s ign i f ican t imp rovemen t in these services o n a 
sustained basis, a numbe r o f challenges need to be met. 

34. 

Continued enhancement o f good governance w i l l be key t o this take-off. W h i l e 
the ove ra l l trends have been very encouraging, i t i s clear that the r e s u l t s va ry s ign i f ican t ly 
across localities. Given the l o w base o f administrative capacity and the l o n g h is to ry o f 
autocratic governance in Ethiopia, this i s ha rd ly surprising. But, i t does mean the re i s a 
need f o r continued capacity building f o r b o t h l o c a l ins t i tu t ions and citizens. Pa r t icu la r ly 
in a situation o f fledgling democratic processes, with re la t ive ly l o w administrative 
capacity, i t i s impo r tan t t o m o b i l i z e the energ ies o f a range o f c i v i l society organizations 
(CSOs) as well. They can help t o strengthen the vo ice o f common citizens, as well as 
supplement governmental capacity in service delivery. 

35 . 

Desp i te the sharp expansion in budgetary resources fo r basic services at the loca l 
leve ls , there rema in large u nm e t needs fo r b o t h comp le t ing the access agenda and 
beginning t o make s ign i f ican t headway o n quality. Securing the f inanc ia l resources w i l l 
be a ma jo r challenge. Thus far, expansion o f the l o c a l budgets has r e l i e d p r im a r i l y o n 
rap id ly increasing t rans fe rs f r om the Federal Government (supplemented by strong donor 
support). A l t h o u g h this re la t ionsh ip may n o t change in the nea r te rm , l o c a l governments 
w i l l have t o step up their e f fo r ts t o strengthen their own revenue bases, so tha t in the 
longer te rm , they w i l l be able t o finance s ign i f ican t po r t ions o f loca l services and loca l 
investments out o f their own revenues. Deve lop ing such revenue streams w i l l at least in 
the l o n g run also give l o c a l governments an a b i l i t y t o b o r r ow against fu tu re revenue 
streams. 

36. 

A l t h o u g h E t h i o p i a i s o f t e n thought t o be one o f the least co r rup t countries in the 
region, the re are concerns that co r rup t ion m a y be g row ing . The increasing resource 
f lows in b o t h the p u b l i c and p r iva te sectors, the w indows o f oppo r tun i ty created at loca l 
l e v e l s by decentralization, and the iden t i f ica t ion o f a few but increasing numbe r o f 
instances o f corruption, a l l suggest the need f o r be t te r understanding o f the scale and 
nature o f corruption, mo re e f f o r t t o mon i to r hotspots and trends, and t o generally increase 
vigilance. 

37. 

Continued improvements in service de l ive ry w i l l be c r i t ica l in p roduc ing t h e 
human capital needed t o support the d ive rs i f ica t ion o f the economy i n t o new areas, 
inc lud ing in agriculture. Imp rovemen t in the effectiveness o f agriculture and l ives tock 
extension services can also have an immediate and direct impac t o n g row th . In turn, 
continued g r ow t h w i l l a l l ow G o E t o raise m u c h needed add i t iona l resources t o imp rove 
basic services, and imp roved economic opportunities w i l l raise the demand f o r be t te r 
qua l i ty education. Thus the t w o take -o f f processes are m u t u a l l y re in fo rc ing .

B. Long-Term Challenges 

3 8 . 

T o make the task o f sustaining the dual take -o f f mo re cha l leng ing s t i l l , E th iop ia 
w i l l have t o cope with a se t o f long - te rm issues around r a p i d popu la t ion g r ow t h and 
environmental vu lne rab i l i ty . A l though the to ta l fertility rate has begun t o decline (5.9 in 
2000 and 5.7 in 2005), i t remains h igh . Fo r E th iop ia t o reap the economic bene f i ts o f a 
‘demographic bonus’ a r is ing f r om an increase in the re la t ive s ize o f the w o r k i n g age 
popu la t ion due t o a r a p i d drop in fertility, the process o f demographic t rans i t ion needs t o 
accelerate. In this regard, i t i s w e l l established that g i r ls ’ education p lays a pa r t icu la r ly 
impo r tan t role. In the meantime, however, r a p i d popu la t ion g r ow t h has led t o a ha lv ing 
o f average land h o l d i n g in the r u r a l areas since 1960, t o a l e v e l that i s generally 
considered subsistence l e v e l at bes t . Furthermore, popu la t ion p ressu re has also led to 
degradation o f f a rm land as well as m u c h o f the watershed areas. This in turn has made 
vast numbers o f r u r a l households increasingly vulnerable t o c l ima t ic shocks, thereby 
encouraging unsustainable exp lo i ta t ion o f natural  resource^.^ 

39. 

The env i ronmen ta l threat that E th iop ia faces today i s increasingly recognized. 
Sustainable land and water management w i l l have t o be at the center o f any 
comprehensive response to this long - te rm challenge. A l t h o u g h good beginnings have 
been made t o reverse this v ic ious c i rc le ( fo r instance th rough the P roduc t ive Safety N e t 
Program, the proposed L a n d Management Project, and the proposed Tana B e l e s 
Integrated Water Resource Deve lopmen t Project), far mo re needs t o be done. Such 
efforts w i l l also he lp E t h i o p i a cope mo re e f fec t ive ly with the impac t o f c l ima te change. 
In teg ra l t o such an endeavor w i l l have to be a long - te rm strategy t o sh i f t large numbers o f 
ru ra l people o f f the land and ou t o f agriculture, and t o he lp those w h o rema in in 
agriculture t o m o v e i n t o h igh -p roduc t iv i ty , mo re comme rc ia l ly oriented agriculture or 
agro-industries. 

40. 

F ina l ly , E th iop ia ’s economic development e f fo r ts since the 1990s cannot be 
separated f r om i t s attempt t o break f r om the strong cen t ra l iza t ion (and top-down) 
tendencies o f the p rev ious regimes, w h i c h had ma rg ina l ized l o c a l voices, suppressed 
reg iona l d ive rs i t ies , and con t r ibu ted t o the c i v i l war. The Government views 
decentralization as the m a i n strategy to address such grievances, and assure peace and 
better service de l ive ry . S t i l l , the deep-rooted t rad i t ion o f top -down dec is ion mak ing as 
well as the social no rms that generally accord women a l o w status do pose significant 
obstacles to decentralized democratic processes that are meant t o imp rove accountability 
and transparency at the l o c a l levels. Aware o f this, G oE has emphasized a wide range o f 
capacity building programs. In the sphere o f economic management, too, G oE was faced 
with the legacy o f a highly centralized, top -down system that a l lowed l i t t l e space fo r 
p r iva te o r l o c a l in i t ia t ives . W h i l e see ing the expansion o f the p r iva te sector as the 
strategic response, G o E has approached i t in a measured and deliberate manner. In i t ia l ly , 
i t has tended t o focus m o r e o n a d i rec t ive ro le o f the state. As G o E moves towa rd 
creating an inc reas ing ly open environment f o r the p r iva te sector, i t m a y again face the 
t rad i t ion o f con t ro l -o r ien ted government institutions. In b o t h o f these b road areas, i.e.,

decentralization of p u b l i c services and p r iva te sector development, h o w the legacy o f 
central control, top -down tendencies, and h ie ra rch ica l social no rms may h inde r the 
change process requires further analysis and ca re fu l t rack ing ove r t ime . 

C. The Challenge and Promise o f Regional Cooperation 

41. 
E th iop ia inhab i ts a d i f f i c u l t neighborhood, w h i c h has seen numerous domestic 
and cross-border con f l ic ts in recent years. At the same time, i t s economic fortunes are 
closely l i n k e d with ne ighbo r ing countries in a number o f ways. First, as a landlocked 
country since the independence o f E r i t rea in 1993, E th iop ia i s re l ian t o n i t s neighbors fo r 
access t o the sea, and hence, f o r m u c h o f i t s access t o g loba l markets. While D j i b o u t i 
had been the m a i n ou t le t t o the sea fo r E th iop ia starting f r om the opening o f the ra i lway 
linking Addis Ababa t o the former French co lony in 191 7, i t was overtaken by the p o r t o f 
Assab, n o w in Eritrea, w h i c h came t o handle up to 90 percent o f E th iop ia ’s international 
trade f r om the 1970s t o the 1990s. However, with the outbreak o f war with E r i t rea in 
1998, D j i b o u t i recaptured the entirety o f E th iop ian sea trade. While the qua l i ty o f roads 
linking E t h i o p i a and D j i b o u t i has steadily improved, the aging r a i lw a y l i n e continues to 
operate short o f i t s full potential, pos ing a constraint to trade. E th iop ia ’s landlocked 
status also means that i t s access to undersea i n t e r n e t backbone cables depends o n reg iona l 
cooperation. 

42. 
Second, h is to r ica l circumstances have limited Ethiopia’s a b i l i t y t o develop i t s 
large po ten t ia l f o r hyd ropowe r and i r r iga t ion . The N i l e B a s i n I n i t i a t i v e (NBI), b r ing ing 
together a l l 10 N i l e riparians t o cooperatively develop the N i l e River as a common

Third, increased reg iona l trade has the po ten t ia l to benefit E th iop ia and i t s 
neighbors, pa r t icu la r ly in specific areas o f comparative advantage. 
Though E t h i o p i a i s part o f the Common Ma rke t f o r Eastern and Southern A f r i c a 
(COMESA), C O M E S A countries account fo r o n l y about 10 percent o f Ethiopia’s to ta l 
trade ( o f w h i c h 5 percent i s D j ibou t i , and the rest m a i n l y Sudan, Egypt, and Kenya). This 
appears t o be due in la rge part to similar p roduc t ion structures, inadequate infrastructure, 
and lack o f i n f o rm a t i o n o n trade opportunities. A m a j o r oppo r tun i ty f o r g r ow t h in 
reg iona l trade i s in exports o f E th iop ian hyd ropowe r t o ne ighbo r ing countries, many o f 
w h om face high p ow e r costs, shortages o f electricity, and a reliance o n carbon-based 
generation. At the s am e time as E th iop ia cou ld reap high re tu rns f r om such trade, i t w i l l 
also a l l ow investments o n a larger scale (and therefore at a l ow e r average cost) than cou ld 
otherwise be realized. E t h i o p i a i s m o v i n g t o link i t s powe r grid t o Sudan and D j i b o u t i

44. 

F ina l ly , cross-border issues in agriculture and hea l th pose special challenges that 
can o n l y be addressed with co l labo ra t ion between countries in the region. Diseases such 
as HIV/AIDS and malaria, f o r example, do n o t respect international boundaries, and 
therefore international cooperation mus t be pa r t o f an e f fec t ive strategy t o combat them. 
The IGAD Reg iona l HIV/AIDS Partnership P rog ram (IRAPP) i s one example.

Deepe r reg iona l in teg ra t ion in these areas can n o t o n l y b r i n g economic benefits, 
but can also build greater interdependence, w h i c h cou ld reduce the l i k e l i h o o d o f in t ra -

led g r ow t h in the f lo r icu l tu re sector and the apparent stagnation in urban pove r ty 
reduction. PASDEP p r io r i t ies in k e y sectors are summarized in the f o l l ow i n g paragraphs. 

Ma rke t based development of agriculture. The strategy iden t i f ies the 

48. 
predominance o f subsistence agriculture, characterized by poo r land management and a 
limited resource base, the l o w supply and dissemination o f technology, the limited f l o w 
o f in fo rma t ion and inadequate imp lemen ta t ion capacity as some o f the ma jo r problems in 
the sector. To address these issues , PASDEP focuses o n human resource development, 
technology, and economic infrastructure in the context o f a strong enab l ing environment 
fo r p r iva te sector a c t i v i t y and imp roved infrastructure. The in te rven t ions identified under 
PASDEP include: t ra in ing programs, the in t roduc t ion o f appropriate technologies and 
ma rke t ing sys tems with a strong push o n ma rke t ing cooperatives, measures t o imp rove 
land use and the conservation o f natural resources, imp roved access f o r farmers t o 
agriculture inputs, markets, r u r a l f inanc ia l services, and im p r o v e d security o f land tenure. 
Investment p r io r i t ies w i l l be based o n the C A A D P framework. 

49. 
Private sector development. PASDEP emphasizes the in teg ra t ion and 
interdependence be tween the ag r icu l tu ra l and indus t r ia l sectors as key t o the country’s 
economic development and t o the expansion o f the service sector. The Indus t r ia l and 
Trade Deve lopmen t P o l i c y Strategy under PASDEP aims t o ensure expo r t oriented 
development by p r o v i d i n g support t o the p r iva te sector, coo rd ina t ing and guiding the 
activities o f a l l stakeholders and addressing market failures. Cen t ra l t o the p rog ram i s an 
active indus t r ia l po l icy , based o n selective interventions in strategic sectors. Selected 
value chains and clusters a re targeted, f o l l ow i n g the highly successful example o f the 
f lo r icu l tu re sector, where interventions targeted at technology, coo rd ina t ion and market 
failure were directed by pub l ic -p r iva te partnerships. Infrastructure, powe r generation, 
and construction and supply opportunities are also h igh l igh ted in PASDEP as high 
po ten t ia l areas fo r p r iva te sector participation, and so are the soc ia l sectors based o n the 
substantial g row th o f p r iva te schools in urban areas. 

50. 

Urban development. Under PASDEP, the strategy i s t o p rov ide e f f ic ien t and 
effective pub l ic services t o u rban residents, with pa r t icu la r emphasis o n reg iona l equity. 
The strategy i s built o n fou r pillars: support fo r m i c r o and sma l l enterprises and j o b 
creation, integrated hous ing development, imp roved access t o land infrastructure, 
transport, and services, and p romo t ing urban-rural and urban-urban linkages. A p r i o r i t y 
that cuts across a l l f o u r pillars i s the on-going e f f o r t t o strengthen u rban governance. 

5 1. 

Infrastructure. R o a d ne two rk expansion, as well as increased access t o 
electricity, water and te lecom services (along with their maintenance), a re seen as central 
to the g row th agenda and con ta in strong e lemen ts o f con t inu i ty with the past, pa r t icu la r ly 
in the road sector. A m a j o r innova t ion i s a large-scale r u r a l e lec t r i f ica t ion program, the 
Un ive rsa l E lec t r i f ica t ion Access P rog ram (UEAP). Under U E A P access w i l l be extended 
to 24 m i l l i o n people, reach ing penetration o f 50 percent o f the coun t ry over five years. 
Further, during the P A SD E P p e r i o d 11 electric powe r generating stations w i l l be 
constructed with a t o t a l capacity o f 4,091 MW . PASDEP th rough the Un ive rsa l Access

in an integrated manner. F ina l ly , t h e strategy’s goa l i s fo r the entire popu la t ion t o have 
access t o telecommunications within a 5 km radius. 

52. 
H um a n development. In education, the Government aims t o implement a twenty- 
year sector plan a imed at im p r o v i n g the quality, equity, and relevance o f education, with 
special emphasis o n p r im a r y education fo r a l l by 2 0 15, as well as Technical and 
Voca t iona l Educa t ion T ra in ing (TVET), teacher’s t ra in ing and cross-cutting issues such 
as gender, c iv ic , ethics and HIV/AIDS education. In the area o f hea l th services the 
Government continues implementing i t s Hea l th Sector Deve lopmen t P rog ram (HSDP) I 
and 11, and w i l l extend i t i n t o HSDP 111 with an increased focus o n poverty-related health 
conditions such as communicable diseases (HIV/AIDS , tuberculosis, malaria) and health 
problems that affect mothers and children. PASDEP also includes an enhanced focus o n 
nu t r i t ion , with a new Na t iona l N u t r i t i o n Strategy ( N N S ) hav ing recen t ly been approved. 

53. 
Governance. PASDEP includes a number o f interventions t o p romo te Ethiopia’s 
comm i tmen t t o open, transparent, and democratic governance. These inc lude : imp rov ing 
the capacity o f Parliament and p o l i t i c a l ins t i tu t ions th rough stronger l a w m a k i n g and

V. WORLD BANK SUPPORT PROGRAM 

A. Lessons L e a r n e d 

55 . 

A Coun t ry Assistance Strategy Comp le t ion Report (CAS CR) prepared by the 
E th iop ia coun t ry team f o r the pe r iod f r om 2003 to 2007” found several lessons o f 
experience applicable t o the Bank’s program. These inc lude : 

The enhanced focus on governance in the FY2006 ICAS should be 
continued in future support, and mainstreamed through the Bank portfolio. 
Fo r projects under implementation, the Bank and Government w i l l need t o 
continue t o app ly measures instituted t o further enhance transparency and 
accountability, especially at the loca l l e v e l . These measures inc lude : using 
clear and transparent c r i te r ia fo r selecting p ro jec t s i tes and beneficiaries; 
ensuring greater invo lvemen t o f a b road range o f stakeholders in p ro jec t 
preparation and implementation; strengthening M&E sys tems and 
operationalizing them in a mo re pa r t ic ipa to ry manner; and strengthening 
imp lemen ta t ion support, pa r t icu la r ly oversight o n the f iduc ia ry aspects o f 
projects. N e w projects shou ld incorporate such measures f r om the beginning. 

The importance of the Bank staying engaged in a constructive manner 
during slzocks. The Bank’s partnership with E th iop ia i s long - te rm and even ts 
l i k e the contested 2005 elections might change the terms o f engagement, but 
should n o t rad ica l ly alter the Bank’s ove ra l l invo lvemen t in the country. The 
B a n k reacted in a very measured and t im e l y manner by shifting i t s support 
f r om general budget support t o the innova t ive PBS project, w h i c h a l lowed the 
Bank and other donors t o act as a s tab i l iz ing force and assured con t inua t ion in 
the imp rovemen t o f governance and service de l ive ry t o poo r people. 

Recognition of the unique advantages of budget support. Despite the 
successful shift in f inanc ing moda l i t ies f r om budget support t o the PBS in 
reaction t o the 2005 crisis, the bene f i ts o f budget support cou ld n o t be fu l ly 
replicated by PBS, as a mo re na r row ly focused investment instrument. 
Budget support p rov ided an impo r tan t f o r um fo r dialogue, especially o n issues 
related t o g r ow t h and structural reforms. In addition, the mu l t i -dono r dialogue 
fostered by budget support enhanced donor ha rmon iza t ion and reduced 
transaction costs. These factors argue f o r the resump t ion o f Pove r ty 
Reduc t ion Support Credits (PRSCs) once donors and Government agree that 
conditions are appropriate. 

The need for enhanced results and monitoring frameworks. The 2003 CAS 
and the 2006 I C A S contained modest mon i to r ing frameworks that c o u l d on ly 
give a limited view o f h o w Bank activities con t r ibu ted t o outcomes. New 

1 1 

The Bank ’s program in this period was guided by two strategies: the FY03 CAS and the FY06 ICAS .

strategies w i l l need t o inc lude a more exp l ic i t r e s u l t s cha in that l i n k s country 
goals with outcomes, outputs and milestones in order t o fac i l i ta te mon i to r ing 
o f progress at various stages o f the CAS period.

Evaluations of Bank support. The Independent Eva lua t ion G roup (IEG) o f the 
W o r l d B a n k recen t ly comp le ted a Coun t ry Assistance Eva lua t ion (CAE ) o f the W o r l d 
Bank’s support f o r E t h i o p i a f r om 1998 t o 2006. The review recognized the relevance o f 
the Bank’s CASs t o E th iop ia ’s development p r io r i t ies and deemed the Bank ’s support fo r 
the pro-poor g r ow t h strategy i t s e l f a success. However, c i t i n g wha t i t considered weak 
outcomes o n p r iva te sector development and mixed outcomes o n governance-and 
the 
importance o f these t w o areas fo r p ro -poo r growth-the C A E ra ted B a n k assistance over 
this pe r iod as “moderately unsatisfactory.” The evaluation recommended that the Bank : 
(i) seek consensus within the coun t ry team and with Government o n p r i o r i t y areas fo r 
support; (ii) restrict i t s interventions t o p o l i c y dialogue and analytic w o r k (rather than 
lending) in areas where there were clear p o l i c y disagreements with Government; (iii) 
view p r iva te sector development constraints as governance issues ; (iv) imp rove i t s 
knowledge base o n social, p o l i t i c a l and cu l tu ra l factors; and (v) con t inue t o w o r k closely 
with non-governmental stakeholders in Ethiopia. The country t e a m has ca re fu l ly 
examined these recommendations, and i s wo rk ing t o identify ways t o take them o n board 
in ways that can imp rove the Bank’s effectiveness. 

57. 
In 2005, the Bank ’s independent Qua l i ty Assurance G roup (QAG ) conducted a 
Coun t ry P rog ram Assessment (CPA) assessing a l l Bank w o r k in E t h i o p i a du r ing 2003- 
2005. The C P A found the E t h i o p i a Coun t ry Program during FY2003-05 t o be 
satisfactory in a l l k e y aspects: responsiveness to government plans and needs, strategic 
relevance o f ana ly t ica l e f fo r ts and lending interventions, coo rd ina t ion with other donors, 
the design and qua l i ty o f tasks, implementation, and likely impac t . The C P A 
recommended an enhanced focus o n agriculture, private sector development, and pub l ic 
expenditure management. I t suggested that future scaling up o f ODA and IDA 
allocations t o E t h i o p i a shou ld be cond i t iona l upon demonstrated success in these areas.

The W o r l d Bank ’s strategy f o r the pe r iod FY 2008-FY 201 1 w i l l a im t o help 
sustain the ‘dua l t a k e - o f f o f g r ow t h and basic services by suppo r t ing the imp lemen ta t ion 
o f key elements o f t h e P A SD E P framework. This will, however, requ i re addressing a se t 
o f vu lne rab i l i ty issues . A con t inued focus o n governance w i l l be impo r tan t in b u i l d i n g 
o n the progress that has been made, as governance has dimensions tha t go beyond service 
delivery and economic management. 

59. 
Therefore, the C A S aims to support E th iop ia in ach iev ing f o u r m a i n strategic 
objectives, consistent with PASDEP : (i) fostering economic growth, in order t o help 
sustain the emerging econom ic ‘take-off‘; (ii) improving access to and quality of basic 
sewice delivery, in order t o sustain the emerging basic service “ t a k e - o f f ; (iii) reducing 
Ethiopia’s vulnerability t o he lp imp rove prospects f o r sustainability; and (iv) fostering 
improved governance t o support the f i r s t t h r e e strategic objectives and citizens’ 

19 

empowerment, building o n the f ramewo rk se t f o r t h in the ICAS , and with continued 
emphasis o n ins t i tu t iona l capacity building. This C A S i s also a l igned with several o f the 
W o r l d Bank’s six strategic themes12 and the Bank’s A f r i c a A c t i o n Plan. 

Box 7; CAS Consultations: Learning from Stakeholders 

In Novembe r and December 2007, the Coun t ry Team conduc ted extensive consultations with 
a w i d e range o f stakeholder groups f r om the government, the p r iva te sector, c i v i l society 
organizations, academia, donors, oppos i t ion members o f par l iamen t , and o ther commun i ty 
groups. The discussions took p lace in the cap i ta l Addis Ababa as well as in Orom ia , Amhara, 
Gambe l la and A f a r reg ions . A l though d i f fe ren t groups na tu ra l ly b rough t diverse perspectives, 
there were also s ign i f ican t areas o f agreement. 

M o s t stakeholders ind ica ted tha t l i f e in general had become b e t t e r in the last 3 - 5 years. 
Incomes have r isen , p rov is ion o f in fras truc ture has improved , and access t o basic services 
has expanded. Nevertheless, serious concerns rema ined about the qua l i ty o f services. 
Decen tra l iza t ion , at the l e v e l o f f o rm a l processes and resource a l loca t ion , has gone far, 
but t rue empowermen t rema ins mo re limited. The re la t ionsh ip with the Federa l 
Gove rnmen t tends t o be experienced as ‘ top down . ’ M a n y l o c a l governments and 
commun i t ies fee l they k n o w the i r o w n solutions t o the l o c a l prob lems but lack the 
resources and clear dec is ion rights t o imp lemen t them. These concerns were pa r t icu la r ly 
p rom inen t in remo te r reg ions . 
M a n y pa r t ic ipan ts were eager f o r mo re econom ic oppor tun i t ies . M a n y in women’s groups 
have a lready had some exposure t o m icro-cred i ts and saw great po ten t ia l in their 
expansion. Y o u t h groups too were keen t o have mo re access t o such support. 
Though imp roved s ign i f ican t ly , biases against women r em a i n widespread. Econom ic 
empowermen t o f women w o u l d be c r i t ica l in addressing such biases. 
There rema in concerns abou t the lack o f space fo r open p o l i t i c a l discourse. W h i l e 
recogn iz ing the comp lex i ty o f the democra t iza t ion process, many f e l t tha t mo re openness 
i s needed t o strengthen transparency and accoun tab i l i ty o f the governmen t at a l l l e v e l s . 

60. 

The pursuit o f these strategic objectives w i l l be a ided by a number o f 
opportunities f o r change that appear to be present in E t h i o p i a today. Such opportunities 
cou ld help make a break with the past. M a n y o f these opportunities f o r change are quite 
consistent with the b road strategic directions articulated in PASDEP-including 
those 
p rov ided by the current process o f deepening decentralization, plans f o r economic 
empowerment o f w om e n and youth, and an emerging sh i f t in the dynamics at loca l 
government levels, with a younger generation o f mo re educated and open administrators, 
who may receive added leg i t imacy th rough the upcom ing l o c a l elections. In other areas, 
such as banking and telecommunications reforms and increased p r iva te sector investment

Instruments and selectivity. The C A S aims t o max im ize the impac t o f the Bank’s 
assistance in E t h i o p i a through: (i) IDA credits and grants, p r im a r i l y in the f o rm o f 
investment projects, but also with the poss ib i l i ty o f development p o l i c y lending i f the re i s 
consensus between the Government, Bank, and partners that conditions are appropriate; 
(ii) analytical wo rk , p o l i c y advice, and technical assistance; (iii) increased invo lvemen t o f 
other ins t i tu t ions o f the W o r l d Bank Group, with I F C p lann ing t o reopen an o f f ice in 
Ethiopia; (v) cap i ta l iz ing o n the increased scope f o r reg iona l in i t ia t ives since the N i l e

available; and (iv) leve rag ing f inanc ia l resources beyond the coun t ry a l loca t ion th rough 
partnerships and donor coordination. 

62. 
In t e r m s o f sector focus, G oE has requested based o n PASDEP resource 
requirements that about 50 percent o f the lend ing shou ld be f o r ‘infrastructure’, 30 
percent f o r basic services (mostly th rough PBS), and the rema in ing 2 0 percent fo r other 
interventions inc lud ing capacity building and certain “catalytic” inves tmen ts that can 
leverage s ign i f ican t dono r f inanc ing o r support key p o l i c y directions. This f ramewo rk 
w i l l continue t o guide the B a n k in selecting future areas o f focus (see Annex 2) o n 
selectivity o f the lending program. After FY2008, the lending p rog ram i s expected t o 
become inc reas ing ly selective, with fewer and larger projects, t o ensu re careful 
preparation and strong implementation. F o r example, while the FY 2 0 0 8 p ipe l ine 
includes e igh t projects with an average size o f about $80 m i l l i o n , the FY 2 0 0 9 pipeline 
w i l l consist o f fou r projects averaging $155 m i l l i o n (see Table 5 ) . The C A S also aims t o 
strengthen se lec t iv i ty in re la t ion to other donors. In jo in t ly -suppo r ted projects, the Bank 
w i l l focus o n foundational aspects (such as the sector framework, o r the bulky pa r t o f 
funding), while b i la te ra l donors may focus mo re o n ex tens ive ins t i tu t iona l support o r 
components that requ i re specialized imp lemen ta t ion s k i l l s . In many sectors, this d i v i s i o n 
o f labor has already a l lowed p roduc t ive collaboration.

further towa rd a sector-focused, p rog ramma t ic approach. Already, three large-scale 
mu l t i -dono r programs, viz., PBS, PSCAP, and PSNP, f o rm an impo r tan t pa r t o f the 
p rog ram (accounting f o r nea r ly one - th i rd o f the current IDA commitment) and w i l l 
continue t o be the backbone o f B a n k support t o basic decentralized service delivery and 
safety ne t . In the road sector, too, a well coordinated investment p rog ram has emerged 
(accounting f o r a quarter o f IDA commitment). In this C A S period, the B a n k w i l l seek to 
s h i f t support t o inc reas ing ly programmatic approaches (whether th rough sector-wide 
support instruments o r PRSCs) in areas such as water supply and sanitation, access t o 
electricity, urban development, r u r a l development, and p r iva te sector development. 
Nevertheless, the re w i l l be areas where a project-based approach, even in a sector with a 
sector-wide program, w i l l be mo re appropriate ( typ ica l ly t o support one -o f f investments, 
introduce innovations, o r fac i l i ta te p o l i c y focus o n new issues). The Bank w i l l be 

21 

selective in using investment lend ing to keep the number o f operations contained and 
reduce the transaction costs f o r b o t h the Government and the Bank. 

64. 

T w o years after suspension o f direct budget support, the in te rna t iona l partners and 
the Government are inc reas ing ly recogn iz ing the importance o f resum ing this moda l i ty o f 
assistance. M o v i n g g radua l ly towa rd direct budget support i s an in te rna t iona l ly accepted 
p r i o r i t y f o r harmonization. I t p rov ides impo r tan t opportunities t o engage in p o l i c y 
dialogue o n w ide - rang ing structural issues (such as macroeconomic p o l i c y and growth) 
that are n o t feasible in conven t iona l investment o r even sector-focused operations. 
Resumption o f budget support w i l l likely require that development partners f e e l some 
confidence that the p o l i t i c a l process in E th iop ia i s able to p rov ide e f fec t ive va l ida t ion o f 
development p r io r i t ies . Thus imp lemen ta t ion o f the l o c a l elections in a way that i s 
b road ly seen as f ree and fair, and continued progress o n the PASDEP governance agenda, 
may be impo r tan t milestones in m o v i n g back t o budget support. In t e r m s o f the p o l i c y 
content, development partners seem t o b road ly agree that addressing k e y structural issues 
that hinder mo re robust g r ow t h o f the p r iva te sector should be central t o the program. 

65. 

Analytical work, policy advice, and technical assistance w i l l a l l be impo r tan t 

means by w h i c h the B a n k w i l l seek to a t ta in the CAS core outcomes. With the tempo o f 
development quickened, G o E i s beginning t o encounter a se t o f challenges in b o t h 
economic management and structural po l ic ies that are new and yet demand urgent 
attention. This creates a pa r t icu la r ly fe r t i le environment f o r constructive p o l i c y dialogue. 
Hence good AAA w o r k i s likely t o have especially high re tu rns . F lagsh ip analytical

performance re la t ive t o a se t o f 26 core C A S outcomes (see table 4), with between one 
and three outcomes per focus area. These outcomes have been selected in such a way 
that satisfactory performance cou ld be said t o have been achieved i f 70-75 percent o f the

Support macro-fiscal stability. E th iop ia has a good t rack reco rd o f 
macroeconomic management. The Government i s keenly aware that con t inua t ion o f this 
good performance w i l l be a prerequisite fo r success in attaining PASDEP goals. In 
coo rd ina t ion with the IMF, the Bank w i l l a im t o support the Government in undertaking 
structural and macroeconomic polices t o address domestic imbalances, such as i n f l a t i o n 
and f isca l pressures, and external ones, inc lud ing ma in ta in ing a compe t i t ive exchange 
rate and keeping the current account de f ic i t within sustainable limits. Given that the 
Government welcomes we l l - fo rmu la ted p o l i c y advice, AAA w i l l rema in the m a i n 
instrument fo r support, though a PRSC may be considered as a means t o enable 
concentration o f p o l i c y attention o n some k e y issues . Just-in-time p o l i c y advice, such as 
has been p rov ided by the B a n k recently o n f o o d p r ice in f la t ion , i s expected t o be a 
valuable t o o l in this regard. While the sustainability o f Ethiopia’s debt has imp roved 
drastically in recent years due t o the debt r e l i e f granted under MDRI and the enhanced 
H I P C in i t ia t ive , the Bank w i l l also w o r k in con junc t ion with the Government and the 
IMF t o mon i to r E th iop ia ’s debt burden. 

69 . Accelerate the level and productivity of 
investment in infrastructure in a 
sustainable manner. Infrastructure has accounted f o r a m a j o r share o f IDA’S support in 
recent years, as w e l l as GoE’s own pub l ic expenditure program. The current strategy w i l l 
seek t o continue this trend, given Ethiopia’s massive infrastructure needs . There is , 
however, impo r tan t scope fo r strengthening the capacity o f b o t h government ins t i tu t ions 
and domestic con t rac t ing industries to qu icken p ro jec t imp lemen ta t ion and reduce costs. 
In the roads sector, the largest s ing le sector supported by IDA, the Bank w i l l emphasize 
strengthened ins t i tu t ions and a mo re capable domestic road construction industry. W i th a 
sector review, the B a n k w i l l seek t o assist G oE in developing a mo re e f fec t ive strategy to 
effect such changes. In energy, supporting investments t o boost access t o e lec t r ic i ty w i l l 
be c r i t ica l . Since the lumpy nature o f investments in powe r generation w i l l mean that the 
sudden boost in generating capacity w i l l n o t be able t o be q u i c k l y accommodated with 
new d is t r ibu t ion networks, increasing reg iona l powe r trade w i l l also be a p r i o r i t y so as t o 
generate expo r t revenues and smooth va r iab i l i ty in energy supply. Given the massive 
investment requirements o f the sector, increased p r iva te sector pa r t ic ipa t ion in energy 
finance w i l l be promoted. P o l i c y notes, on -go ing advice, and lending instruments w i l l be 
used t o support t h e energy sector. 

70. 

Reg iona l ly , the re are an increasing numbe r o f po ten t ia l win-win infrastructure 
development opportunities between E th iop ia and i t s neighbors that can be exploited. The 
N i l e B a s i n I n i t a t i v e (NBI) has been the catalyst f o r a number o f these opportunities ( two 
IDA inves tmen ts in i r r i g a t i o n and powe r trade have already been made possible th rough 
the open ing created by NBI). The Bank w i l l continue t o p l a y the r o l e o f coo rd ina t ing 
in te rna t iona l support f o r NBI, and further cap i ta l iz ing o n poss ib i l i t ies f o r supporting 
investments made possible by the in i t ia t ive , pa r t icu la r ly in terms o f add i t iona l powe r 
trade investments, hydropower, water resources management, and f l o o d control. Outside 
the NBI framework, another p rom is ing opening with the po ten t ia l f o r eventual Bank 

25 

support i s an increased focus o n reg iona l transport corridors, pa r t icu la r ly in te rms o f the 
proposed Eastern A f r i c a Reg iona l Road Ne two rk , i n v o l v i n g Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania, 
and Uganda, as well as t h e rehab i l i ta t ion o f the E t h i o -D j i b o u t i Ra i lway . E th iop ia i s also 
eligible t o participate in the Bank’s $424 m i l l i o n Reg iona l Communications 
Infrastructure P rog ram (RCIP), w h i c h aims t o increase broadband internet connec t iv i ty in 
East and Southern A f r i c a . 

71. 

Domestically, returns o n infrastructure investments can also be boosted by 
encouraging ne two rk effects, i.e. by g roup ing complementary investments in high 
po ten t ia l ‘g row th corridors.’ In add i t ion t o p r o v i d i n g f inanc ia l support f o r such 
investments, the Bank w i l l focus o n creating an enabling environment t o make the g row th 
co r r ido r concept a sustainable reality, th rough supporting the establishment o f loca l 
organizations in h igh -po ten t ia l areas t o coordinate investments f r om the na tu ra l resource 
management p o i n t o f view. The Proposed Tana B e l e s Integrated Water Resource 
Development P ro jec t w i l l be a key instrument 
to se t a w o r k i n g example o f such a v is ion . A 
series o f s tud ies o n other g r ow t h corridors i s

Increase productivity of agriculture. 

Recent ag r icu l tu ra l g r ow t h has been driven 
s ign i f ican t ly by an expansion in the areas 
cultivated, rather than by wide-spread 
p roduc t iv i ty gains. Ra is ing the p roduc t iv i ty 
o f agriculture and l ives tock w i l l strengthen the 
base o f g r ow t h and reduce the f o o d insecu r i ty 
o f the poor. P r io r i t ies fo r IDA lending and 
non - lend ing support w i l l be: (i) continue to 
build the capacity o f the ag r icu l tu ra l extension 
system and make ag r icu l tu ra l research w o r k 

more demand driven; (ii) help s t reng then the 

rural-urban economic linkages; (iii) support 
mo re e f f ic ien t agriculture input markets t o 
imp rove ava i lab i l i ty ; (iv) support mo re 
phys ica l investment (irrigation, electrification, 
market access); and (v) imp rove the land 
management system t o fac i l i ta te 
comme rc ia l iza t ion o f ag r icu l tu re and, where 
appropriate, d ive rs i f ica t ion o f farm 
households ou t o f agriculture. In a l l this, 
connec t iv i ty with the ma rke t i s a cross-cutting 
theme. Va lue -cha in analysis and a study o n 
development o f sma l l towns (w h i c h are 
c r i t ica l l i n k s between v i l lages and the g loba l 
markets) w i l l be used as too ls t o i d e n t i f y 
specific areas o f p o l i c y interventions. Helping 

The Bank’s recent Investment Climate 
Assessments (ICAs) have underlined tha t 
a major constraint on Ethiopia’s 
international competitiveness i s low 
labor productivity, which i s estimated to 
be less than ha l f o f the sub-Saharan 
Africa average and far below that o f 
developing countries in Asia. 

Evidence from the PROFILES project 
suggests that malnutrition and stunting 
due to iron and iodine deficiency alone 
costs Ethiopia as much as 10 percent o f 
GDP in lost productivity per year. 
Therefore, t h e Bank w i l l begin a new 
emphasis on supporting improved 
nutrition in this CAS period, through 
Ethiopia’s new National Nu t r i t ion 
Program (NNP). 

At the top end o f the labor market, the 
lack o f highly skilled workers i s also a 
constraint on productivity. Continued 
Bank support for higher education w i l l 
aim to support the ongoing expansion o f 
and quality improvements in the 
university system. In this regard, raising 
tertiary completion rates for women i s

Strengthen supply responsiveness of 

industry and services sectors. The Bank 

73. 

strongly supports PASDEP’s expanded focus o n p r iva te sector and indus t r ia l 
development. The fo r thcom ing Investment C l ima te Assessment notes a number o f 
improvements in the investment climate, with E th iop ia n o w the gth ranked bus iness 
environment in Sub-Saharan A f r i c a according t o Doing Business. On the other hand, 
several impo r tan t constraints t o p r iva te sector development prevent an even greater 
improvement in the investment climate. In this regard, the Bank w i l l seek t o support a 
l e s s targeted, mo re open approach t o investment p romo t ion (with a t ten t ion t o the ro le o f 
the E th iop ian diaspora), an imp roved enabling environment fo r sma l l and medium 
enterprises, and mo re e f f ic ien t urban land management sys tems t o a l l ow easier access t o 
land. Access t o bank ing and t e l e c o d i n t e r n e t services are close t o the lowes t in the 
world, constraining g r ow t h and limiting Ethiopia’s ab i l i ty t o compete successfully in the 
g loba l market. 

74. 

The B a n k w i l l seek t o support new approaches in these sectors t o imp rove 
competitiveness, and w i l l explore with Government and donor partners whether renewed 
budget support cou ld have the po ten t ia l t o anchor broad p o l i c y dialogue o n such 
structural issues . Small-scale studies o n specific i s s u e s in these key sectors and notes o n 
p o l i c y options w i l l be used t o anchor p o l i c y dialogue. The B a n k w i l l also support the 
improvement o f the ins t i tu t iona l infrastructure fo r corporate f inanc ia l repo r t ing standards 
and practices, using the Reports o n the Observance o f Standards and Codes (ROSC) 
in i t ia t ive and a possible IDF grant. Government’s im p r o v i n g ove ra l l support fo r the 
p r iva te sector has made i t possible fo r the International Finance Co rpo ra t ion (IFC), the 
p r iva te sector a rm o f the W o r l d Bank Group, t o decide t o reopen an o f f i c e in E th iop ia 
after an absence o f nea r ly eight years. IFC , together with IDA, w i l l a im t o help the

Strategic Objective 2: Improving Access to 
and Quality o f Basic Service Delivery 

75. 

Improved access/coverage of basic services. E th iop ia ’s recent ‘ t a k e - o f f in basic 

service de l ive ry has been driven by the Government’s comm i tmen t t o boost rap id ly p ro - 
poo r expenditures at the sub-national level, with support f r om IDA and donor partners 
through the PBS p ro jec t and earlier budget support and sectoral SWAps . By the end o f

and HIV/AIDS control, vaccination, and contraception. PBS, and i t s envisaged successor 
(‘PBS 27 , w i l l continue t o p o o l donor funds in support o f this impo r tan t process, 
alongside stand-alone support fo r nu t r i t ion , H I V / A I D S prevention, water supply and 
sanitation, and support f o r decentralization at the leve l o f mun ic ipa l administrations (with 
a large focus o n u rban water supply and sanitation). While water supply and sanitation i s 
inc luded in the basic services supported by PBS, a stand alone water and sanitation 
p ro jec t i s s t i l l planned during the C A S pe r iod since l o c a l capacity remains inadequate t o 
manage water supply and sanitation services independently. The B a n k w i l l focus 
pa r t icu la r ly o n strengthening results mon i to r ing with technical assistance so as to 
imp rove further enhance the impac t o f pub l ic spending o n basic services. Th rough the

po ten t ia l f o r a sharp increase in r u r a l in fec t ion rates, th rough support f o r p reven t ion 
activities. 

76. 

Enhance quality of basic services. As access t o basic services has expanded 

rap id ly in recent years, improvements in the qua l i ty o f services have n o t been as easy to 
come by. Im p r o v i n g qua l i ty w i l l depend o n deepening decentralization in several 
dimensions, f o r w h i c h the Bank w i l l step up support: a l l ow i n g greater space f o r loca l 
in i t ia t ives and l o c a l determination o f priorities; increasing non-salary resources at the 
decentralized levels, and focusing o n sustainable building up o f ins t i tu t iona l capacity at 
loca l l e v e l s (e.g., m a k i n g c i v i l service careers mo re attractive). The Government has 
fu l ly recognized the need t o begin shifting attention f r om expanding access t o imp rov ing 
quality, and in education has developed a General Educa t ion Qua l i ty Imp rovemen t 
Program (GEQIP), w h i c h the Bank expects to support together with donor partners. 

77. 

Enhance citizens’ voice to improve quality of basic services. Ano the r p rom is ing 

means o f im p r o v i n g the qua l i ty o f basic services i s th rough greater invo lvemen t o f 
communities, citizens, and c i v i l society. This can p romo te enhanced accountability and 
alignment with l o c a l needs and p r io r i t ies . The B a n k w i l l seek t o support increased 
commun i ty invo lvemen t in service qua l i ty imp rovemen t (such as Parent-Teacher 
Associations, as envisioned in GEQIP); expanded statehon-state partnerships fo r service 
delivery; increased space f o r c i v i l society organizations, building o n openings such as 
C i v i l Society Repo r t Cards and PBS component fou r social accoun tab i l i ty activities; and 
greater med ia a t ten t ion as a way o f im p r o v i n g transparency and accountability in pub l ic 
service de l ive ry . The B a n k w i l l undertake deeper analysis o f social dynamics around 
c i t izen pa r t ic ipa t ion in p u b l i c decision making and try t o contribute t o imp rovemen t in a 
number o f p rog rams that i n v o l v e citizens and communities. Independent commun i ty 
radio service can also help imp rove service delivery quality, i f used as a veh ic le fo r 
p romo t ing awareness and social accountability. 

Strategic Objective 3: Reducing Vulnerability 

Reduce exposure to chronic food insecurity and shocks. Despite some 

78. 
s ign i f ican t efforts, such as the IDA -suppo r ted P roduc t ive Safety N e t s P rog ram (PSNP) 
and Food Security Project, w h i c h have shown great p rom ise recently, E th iop ia ’s 

28 

vu lne rab i l i ty t o adverse weather remains significant. The Bank w i l l continue to support 
E th iop ia in addressing f o o d insecu r i ty issues t o imp rove the l i v e s o f the poorest and 
protect the take -o f f process. An essential nex t step i s t o help develop a coherent national 
strategy t o assist poorest f a rm households t o ‘graduate’ f r om f o o d security programs in a 
sustainable manner. In this regard, ra is ing the p roduc t iv i ty o f agriculture and l ives tock i s 
c r i t ica l . S t i l l i t i s l ike ly that E th iop ia can overcome the basic imbalance between the land 
and the popu la t ion o n l y th rough mo re structural changes in the economy. Thus the 
na t iona l strategy w i l l have t o examine t h e prospects fo r non -ag r icu l tu ra l sectors t o give 
incentives fo r a s ign i f ican t p o r t i o n o f the ru ra l popu la t ion t o shift away f r om agriculture, 
as well as the sens i t ive i s s u e o f rese t t lemen t o f r u r a l dwellers. U p c om i n g discussions o n 
the nex t phase o f PSNP should p rov ide a natural p l a t f o rm fo r this discussion, and the 
Bank plans t o contribute ana ly t ica l inputs fo r the na t iona l strategy. As an emerging issue , 
the needs o f the urban poo r (currently n o t covered under the PSNP mechanism) requ i re 
attention, especially in light o f the recent high l e v e l s o f f o o d p r ice in f la t ion . 

79 . 

While risk m i t i g a t i o n strategies are critical, ensuring an e f fec t ive and timely 
response t o any shock, so as t o a l l ow the poorest households t o cope effectively, also 
remains important. Further support t o the development o f early warning ind ica to rs and

Address environmental degradation andpopulation pressures. Con t inued 

degradation o f Ethiopia’s land threatens the prospects f o r sustainable g r ow t h and pove r ty 
reduction. Estimates are that erosion f r om c rop land invo lves a loss o f 2-3 percent o f 
ag r icu l tu ra l GDP per year in E th iop ia , and degradation o f watersheds exacerbates the 
impac t o f droughts. While estimating t h e impac t o f climate change o n E th iop ia ’s 
p roduc t ive resources, pa r t icu la r ly land and water, s t i l l requires further analysis, i t i s clear 
that the impac t i s s ign i f ican t and w i l l requ i re robust adaptation measures. The p rob lem 
calls f o r a renewed e f f o r t t o develop and implement a comprehensive land resource 
management plan, and increased investment in community-based watershed 
management. This can build o n the p rom is ing beginning in unde r tak ing small-scale c i v i l 
wo rks t o reverse degradation under PSNP. Potential en t ry po in ts inc lude integrated water 
resource management within the Tana and Beles sub-basins, p r om o t i o n o f im p r o v e d land 
tenure security, and the generation and dissemination o f know ledge o n best practices and 
innovations in manag ing land sustainably. A pa r t icu la r emphasis w i l l be p laced o n using

economic g r ow t h and services, E th iop ia needs t o develop and imp lemen t a coherent 
action p rog ram t o accelerate i t s demographic transition. The 2006 B a n k report 
“Capturing the Demog raph ic Bonus in E th iop ia ” recommends expansion o f f am i l y

Support greater economic engagement of women and youth. In the t rad i t iona l 
social systems prevalent in many pa r t o f Ethiopia, women and y o u t h tend t o be given 
m u c h less voice. This disempowerment appears highly correlated with development 
outcomes. The B a n k w i l l seek t o expand support fo r PASDEP ’s focus o n women and 
youth, pa r t icu la r ly in rega rd t o im p r o v i n g their economic independence and tapping their 
energ ies f o r development. Such support cou ld i n v o l v e scaling up m i c r o finance and 
technical support f o r the t w o groups, developing special support programs in education t o

w h i c h to enhance the r o l e o f citizens in the equitable development o f E th iop ia . The 
I C A S strongly emphasized governance, and specified the Bank’s lead ing ro le in 
supporting governance in areas consistent with i t s mandate-particularly 
in “core” areas 
such as pub l ic sector re fo rm , decentralization, PFM , and loca l - leve l accoun tab i l i ty and 
empowerment-while

remains valid, and shou ld be sustained in this C A S period.

I t i s impo r tan t to recognize, however, that building good governance i s a long- 
term e f fo r t . Bank support shou ld be approached strategically, and be able t o adapt t o 
b o t h the peaks and va l leys that w i l l inev i tab ly accompany this process. This C A S 
therefore envisages a pa ra l le l approach that: (i) promotes the in teg ra t ion o f governance in 
the sectors a imed at suppo r t ing the dua l g r ow t h and service de l ive ry takeo f f ; and (ii) 
continues t o target support in core areas o f governance - elaborating t h e n e e d f o r ongoing

The qua l i ty o f governance cuts across a l l sectors and impacts every type o f 
development in te rven t ion . At present, a number o f sectoral, decentralization, and 
capacity building projects inc lude a systemic approach t o governance. This approach

Since the C P I A system contains an inherent mechanism f o r a l ign ing the IDA

The C A S inc ludes one outcome focusing o n ha rmon iza t ion : increased donor 
ha rmon iza t ion th rough mu l t i -dono r programmatic approaches (a Paris Dec la ra t ion 
indicator). Th is outcome aims t o build o n the success o f the Bank in recent years in 
working w ith other donors o n developing an innovative set o f harmonized 
instruments t o reduce transactions costs, a l ign support with the country’s decentralized 
model, and enhance the p red ic tab i l i ty o f aid17. These instruments a l l ow fo r large-scale 
leveraging o f IDA support. Such approaches include: 

Protection of Basic Services (PBS) program. First phase: IDA US$2 15 
m i l l i o n (M a y 2006), donor partners U S $ 5 8 0 m i l l i o n . Second phase: IDA 
US$215 m i l l i o n (December 2007), partners about US$560 m i l l i o n 
(planned). M a i n partners: DFID, AfDB, EC, C I D A , KfW, Netherlands. 
Public Sector Capacity Building Program (PSCAP). First phase: IDA

105. Trust funds. M u c h o f the ha rmon ized donor support described above i s 
channeled t o E t h i o p i a th rough a variet o f Bank-administered trust funds, and t r u s t 
funded-grants, o f a l l t h r e e m a i n types.‘ 
In fact, E th iop ia has one o f the largest W o r l d 
Bank-administered t r u s t fund po r t fo l ios in the A f r i c a Region, at about $560 m i l l i o n in 
to ta l commitments. Trust fund disbursements have expanded sharply in recent years as a 
r e s u l t o f the close co l labo ra t ion with donors o n the P ro tec t ion o f Bas ic Services Program, 
and w i l l g r ow further as spending accelerates under the P roduc t ive Safety N e t s 
Partnership. The emergence o f recipient-executed t r u s t funds as a way t o complement 
and scale up the u s e o f IDA resources f o r this program, r e f l e c t s b o t h coun t ry 
circumstances, and the Bank’s support fo r the Paris Dec la ra t ion agenda o n ha rmon iza t ion 
and a i d effectiveness. In addition, Bank-executed t r u s t funds have helped cover the costs 
o f donor coordination, and p rov ided resources t o oversee t h e use o f recipient-executed 
t r u s t funds. 

106. 
Trust fund resources administered by the B a n k are subject t o the same qua l i ty 
standards and f iduc ia ry controls as IDA financing. The recent increase in the vo lume o f 
trust funds has increased the f inanc ia l management and procurement capacity workload; 
in response the B a n k i s strengthening s ta f f ing in these areas and o f f e r i n g add i t iona l t r u s t 
fund and f iduc ia ry t ra in ing f o r staff. Trust funds that cofinance IDA projects are by 
nature well a l igned with the Bank’s strategy, and share the same arrangements f o r r e s u l t s 
mon i to r ing . F o r other trust funds, mo re care w i l l need t o be taken t o ensu re selectivity, 
strategic fit, and systematic repo r t ing o f resu l ts . 

107. 

As a l o w income coun t ry that faces ma jo r challenges o n the management o f 
g loba l pub l ic goods, E th iop ia i s well placed t o bene f i t f r om many o f the ve r t ica l 
in i t ia t ives launched in recent years, t o address specific parts o f that agenda-including 
the G loba l Fund t o Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Ma la r ia ; the G loba l Env i ronmen t 
Fac i l i ty ; and the Educa t ion F o r All-Fast T rack I n i t i a t i v e Catalytic Fund. The B a n k 
p lays a f inanc ia l r o l e in administering many o f these funds, and va ry ing roles in their 
implementation. As pa r t o f the wider ha rmon iza t ion agenda, we w i l l ac t ive ly explore the 
scope t o ensu re resources f r om such funds are strongly coordinated with, and benefit 
from, the coun t ry - leve l operational expe r t ise that we can bring t o bear.

U S $ 3 5 0 m i l l i o n in the last f i v e years,” but with the ma tu r ing o f a few large-scale 
interventions in roads, r u r a l electrification, and basic services, the pace o f disbursement i s 
expected t o quicken. In the past 12 months, a number o f projects have ex i ted the 
po r t fo l io , and consequently the age o f the p o r t f o l i o has dropped f r om an average o f 4.0 
years at the time o f the I C A S t o 2.7 years at present. A b o u t one - th i rd o f the current IDA 
p o r t f o l i o i s in the f o rm o f grants. 

109. The ove ra l l performance o f the E th iop ia p o r t f o l i o i s be t te r than the A f r i c a Reg ion 
and Bank -w ide performance in three key categories-problem projects, commitments at 
risk, and p roac t iv i ty (Table 7). One p ro jec t out o f the 23 active IDA projects (or 4.3 
percent) are cu r ren t ly rated as a p r o b l em p ro jec t (i.e. rated unsatisfactory f o r meeting 
development objectives a n d o r satisfactory imp lemen ta t ion progress). This compares 
favo rab ly with the A f r i c a Reg ion and the Bank as a who le where 12.5 and 1 1.8 percent o f 
projects, respectively, a re ra ted unsatisfactory. The p o r t f o l i o has im p r o v e d since the 
I C A S and b o t h in te rms o f rea l ism and p roac t iv i ty has exceeded the Reg iona l and B a n k 
wide average with 100 percent.

1 10. The ove ra l l performance o f the p o r t f o l i o has been satisfactory, with l e s s than five 
percent o f the projects as p r o b l em projects. Howeve r key issues i d e n t i f i e d in the Coun t ry 
Po r t fo l io Performance Review (CPPR) report o f June 2007, are : (a) the n e e d t o foster 
enhanced transparency and accountability, (b) procurement delays, (c) f inanc ia l 
management shortcomings, and (d) weak mon i to r ing and evaluation and results 
framework. Ac t ions are unde rway t o address key constraints in a l l o f these areas, as 
described be low . 

1 1 1. 

Transparency and accountabizify. In pa ra l le l with I C A S p repa ra t ion in 2006, the 
B a n k undertook a p ro jec t -by -p ro j ect analysis o f r i s k s and developed spec i f ic 
recommendations t o fu r the r strengthen transparency and accoun tab i l i ty in current and 

l 9 FY03 - US$362 million, FY04-$422 million, FY05- US $ 3 7 3 million, FY06-$282.3million and FY07 - 
U S $ 3 17 million. 

39 

f u t u r e projects. These recommendations have been mainstreamed i n t o p ro jec t 
preparation during t h e I C A S period, and w i l l continue t o be adhered t o in the pe r iod 
covered by this strategy. They include: (a) clear and transparent c r i te r ia fo r selecting 
p ro jec t s i t e s and beneficiaries; (b) greater invo lvemen t o f a b road range o f stakeholders in 
p ro jec t preparation and implementation; (c) strengthening M&E systems and 
operationalizing them in a mo re pa r t ic ipa to ry manner; and (d) strengthening 
imp lemen ta t ion support, pa r t icu la r ly oversight o n the f iduc ia ry aspects o f projects. F o r 
new projects, i t was also agreed with the Government that the re w o u l d be pub l ic 
disclosure o f p ro jec t i n f o rm a t i o n in the Ministry o f Finance and P lann ing website and 
mechanisms in projects t o ensure citizen’s pa r t ic ipa t ion in p u b l i c p o l i c y mak ing and 
budget processes. 

1 12. Procurement and Contract Execution Delays. Procurement and contract 
execution delays continue t o be a ma jo r p rob lem fo r the p o r t f o l i o w h i c h also negatively 
impacts o n disbursements. M a j o r reasons fo r the delays inc lude the Government’s 
ambitious roads and energy programs, w h i c h have stretched the procurement capacity o f 
the imp lemen t ing agencies and have generally experienced a slower than expected pace 
o f contract execution, necessitating enhanced supervision. Na t iona l ly , the re has also 
been continued de te r io ra t ion in the qua l i ty o f procurement documentation that some 
p ro jec t imp lemen ta t ion agencies submit t o the Bank . In order t o assist t h e Government, 
the Bank has increased the number o f s ta f f in E th iop ia and devo lved greater decision 
mak ing powers t o the coun t ry o f f ice . With respect t o procurement capacity, feas ib i l i ty 
s tud ies are unde rway t o assess the po ten t ia l t o establish a ce r t i f ica te o r d ip loma p rog ram 
in procurement at a na t iona l educational ins t i tu t ion such as the C i v i l Service College. 
A c t i o n i s be ing taken t o p rov ide t ra in ing fo r relevant government agencies o n the Bank’s 
guidelines. U n d e r PSCAP, respons ib i l i ty fo r international compe t i t ive bidding i s be ing 
devolved t o sub-program and Reg iona l levels. The Bank and other donors have agreed 
o n a ha rmon iza t ion agenda that aims to promote increased reliance o n coun t ry systems. 

1 13. The progress in procurement reforms in E th iop ia has seen the enactment o f a 
federal pub l ic procurement p roc lama t ion and issuance o f federal p u b l i c procurement 
directives in 2005 i n c l u d i n g the establishment o f a Pub l ic Procurement Agency. Th ree 
actions that are a p r i o r i t y f o r the func t ion ing o f the p u b l i c procurement system are: (i) the 
creation o f func t iona l Procurement Units in a l l Government entities; (ii) the creation o f a 
professional p u b l i c procurement cadre; and (iii) ins t i tu t iona l ized annual independent 
procurement audits. 

1 14. 

F inanc ia l Managemen t Weaknesses. E th iop ia has b e e n m a k i n g pub l ic f inanc ia l 
management imp rovemen ts th rough the Expenditure Management and Con t ro l Sub- 
Program (EMCP) o f t h e Government’s C i v i l Services R e f o rm Program. This i s being 
supported by the B a n k and other development partners. There has been s ign i f ican t 
progress in strengthening p u b l i c f inanc ia l management in recent years. Coun t ry f inanc ia l 
management systems a re be ing used to a s ign i f ican t ex ten t in many projects. 
Development partners have adopted common f inanc ia l management arrangements and 
requirements t o a very high degree. While f inanc ia l management performance in many 
projects i s satisfactory, the re are s ign i f ican t weaknesses in other projects. Fifty percent 

40 

o f the federal-level p ro jec t implementing u n i t s used computerized accounting systems in 
FY2006, compared with 38 percent in FY 05. There i s however need f o r improvement in 
the qua l i ty and timeliness o f f inanc ia l reporting. M a j o r delays in submission o f audit 
reports o n Bank - f inanced projects are a s ign i f ican t issue . A ma jo r unde r ly ing factor i s 
weak capacity especially at the loca l government l e v e l (regions and woredas). These 
problems lead t o disbursement delays and have also delayed the app rova l o f some new 
projects. 

1 15. 
Discussions are ongo ing with the Government o n measures t o address these 
problems, some o f w h i c h are being implemented. These include: (i) capacity 
enhancement (e.g., pos t ing o f additional accountants) pa r t icu la r ly at the reg iona l and 
woreda leve ls ; (ii) training; (iii) imp lemen ta t ion support f r om the federal l e v e l and 
p ro jec t u n i t s to reg iona l and woreda l e v e l en t i t ies ; (iv) increased u s e o f p r iva te audit 
f i r m s by the O f f i c e o f the A u d i t o r General; (v) continuous o r interim audits during the 
year and early start o f the annual audit; (vi) ensuring readiness fo r imp lemen ta t ion at 
p ro jec t s ta r t ; and (vii) s t ream l in ing and simplifying f inanc ia l management arrangements 
across the p o r t f o l i o . The strong emphasis o n p u b l i c f inanc ia l management reforms at the 
federal, reg iona l and woreda l e v e l s w i l l continue. Ano the r area o f emphasis i s the design 
and imp lemen ta t ion o f a p rog ram t o increase the number o f qua l i f ied accounting and 
aud i t ing technicians and professionals t o w o r k in t h e pub l ic and p r iva te sectors. 

1 16. 
Weak monitoring and evaluation and results framework. The need to focus o n 
m o n i t o r i n g and eva lua t ion i s continuously s t ressed by b o t h Government and Bank teams. 
This i s an area that needs substantial wo rk . Cu r ren t ly many o f the projects in the 
p o r t f o l i o and new projects are focusing o n baseline surveys and ensuring that impac t 
evaluations are ca r r ied out. The Task Teams are w o r k i n g c lose ly with A F T Q K t o 
imp rove the r e s u l t s frameworks fo r many projects, and there i s a greater focus by 
management o n results m o n i t o r i n g in the review o f supervision documents. 

D. Managing Risks 

1 17. 
In imp lemen t ing this strategy, the B a n k w i l l need t o focus cen t ra l ly o n the key 
r i s k s that might threaten t o reduce the effectiveness o f i t s support. M a n y such r i s k s a re 
well known and have been discussed in p rev ious Bank strategies. In the med ium term, 
the mos t serious risk i s l ike ly t o be E th iop ia ’s vu lne rab i l i ty t o external shocks, in 
pa r t icu la r d rough t and possible reg iona l con f l ic t . A l t h o u g h E th iop ia ’s economy has 
become inc reas ing ly diversified, a severe drought, w h i c h based o n h is to ry seems 
inevitable, w i l l l ike ly cause n o t o n l y immediate hardships t o the poorest, but also 
seriously disrupt the take -o f f process by fo rc ing the Government t o d ive r t resources f r om 
development t o emergency aid. A reg iona l con f l ic t , pa r t icu la r ly given tensions with 
E r i t rea and E th iop ia ’s military invo lvemen t in Somalia, cou ld have s im i la r effects. 

1 18. 
There i s l i t t l e the B a n k can do t o reduce the risk o f such shocks i t s e l f , at least in 
the short te rm , but there a re ways in w h i c h the B a n k can help m i t iga te the impac t o f a 
shock. First, B a n k projects such as PSNP and PCDP that address vu lne rab i l i ty have built 
in contingency components that can be activated in the even t o f ce r ta in shocks. A second 

41 

key measure i s the gradual shift in the p o r t f o l i o structure towa rd greater u s e o f more 
programmatic funding instruments (e.g., PBS and PSNP), w h i c h a l l ow acceleration o f 
disbursement t o meet unexpected f isca l needs in specific sectors o f high importance. As 
the B a n k continues the recent trend towa rd rep lac ing t rad i t iona l investment instruments 
with add i t iona l p rog ramma t ic approaches (S WAps and/or PRSCs) in the m a i n sectors, 
this built-in flexibility t o deal with shocks should increase further. Mo reove r , while 
estimating the exact magnitude o f the impact o f climate change s t i l l r e q u i r e s more 
analysis, ex is t ing research shows that climate change w i l l have a s ign i f ican t impac t o n 
E th iop ia ’s agriculture. The B a n k i s seek ing to m i t iga te the impac t o f d rough t o n 
development in the longer run th rough i t s support t o the safety n e t and f o o d security 
program, agriculture, and env i ronmen ta l programs ( inc lud ing in pa r t icu la r sustainable 
land management). The B a n k has also urged the Government to adopt a mo re counter- 
cyc l ica l f isca l po l icy . 

1 19. 

The I C A S underscored the importance o f governance-related r isks , and ou t l ined 
tw o possible scenarios o f de te r io ra t ion in governance, and the po ten t ia l r i s k s fo r 
development: 

Con t inued uncertainty, con f l ic t , violence and concerns about human rights. 
This can threaten o r reduce aid, discourage investment, and put strains o n the 
c red ib i l i ty and leg i t imacy o f the state. 

Weak and e rod ing ins t i tu t iona l checks and balances, ra is ing the risk o f capture 
o f decentralization, b l o c k grants and the c i v i l service, alongside a lack o f l e v e l 
p l a y i n g f i e l d o r c red ib le environment t o attract p r iva te investment fo r g row th . 

120. 
T w o years after the I C A S was prepared, the l i k e l i h o o d o f such r i s k s ma te r ia l iz ing 
appears t o have diminished, but cannot be dismissed entirely. At presen t , t w o domestic 
governance r i s k s appear pa r t icu la r ly re levan t over the near term: the poss ib i l i ty o f 
disputes over the c om i n g l o c a l elections in April 2008 (and eventually ove r parliamentary 
e lec t ion in 20 lo ) , and the ongo ing m i l i t a r y ac t ion in the Ogaden area o f Ethiopia’s 
Soma l i reg ion t o subdue separatist r e b e l e lemen ts . The presence o f these r i s k s calls, as 
stated in the ICAS , f o r basing B a n k support o n a careful understanding and management 
o f p o l i t i c a l economy risks, while seeking firmly to address core governance challenges 
j o i n t l y with donor partners. T o the extent that such risks can be m i t iga ted by external 
actors, the Bank re l ies o n the interventions o f the broader in te rna t iona l commun i ty fo r 
these types o f p o l i t i c a l r i s k s . I f the future evo lu t ion o f the p o l i t i c a l con tex t causes these 
risks t o become heightened, the Bank w i l l seek to adjust i t s support accordingly, b o t h t o 
help the country address the r i s k s , and t o manage t h e l e v e l o f resources entering an 
environment that m a y n o t be conducive to development. 

12 1. O n the macroeconomic front, the highly pos i t ive g r ow t h t ra jec to ry o f recent years 
i s n o t w i thou t some r i s k s : i n f l a t i o n has r i s e n sharply, with f o o d p r i c e increases hu r t ing 
the u rban poo r and middle class. G o o d g r ow t h has been in the face o f a strong headw ind 
f r om rising o i l prices; con t inu ing o i l p r ice increases cou ld exacerbate i n f l a t i o n further and 
constitute a greater constraint o n g row th . These r i s k s were explained in some de ta i l in 

42 

the Recent Econom ic Developments section (section 11. B.) The B a n k w i l l continue t o 
assist the Government in identifying and implementing actions t o limit the negative 
g r ow t h and d is t r ibu t iona l consequences o f f o o d and o i l p r ice increases. 

122. 
F ina l ly , the shortage o f s k i l l s and weak capacity especially at loca l l e v e l s o f 
government carries r i s k s f o r the Bank program, no tab ly in procurement and f inanc ia l 
management. The long - te rm nature o f capacity building means that these r i s k s are l i k e l y 
t o rema in f o r some time. Such r isks , and measures being t a k e n by Government and the 
Bank t o m i t iga te them, are discussed in section V1.C o n p o r t f o l i o management. 

123. 
F o r IDA’S ove ra l l lending program, the C P I A p rov ides a mechanism by w h i c h the 
Bank can adjust i t s support in response t o pos i t ive o r negative developments in 
governance and other key aspects o f the development e f fo r t . In t h e case o f a severe 
deterioration in the development environment in Ethiopia, the B a n k w o u l d reduce new 
lending and rely mo re o n non - lend ing support. O n the other hand, as E t h i o p i a makes 
progress towards the k e y outcomes contained in PASDEP, and imp roves i t s p o l i c y and 
ins t i tu t iona l performance, a steady increase in IDA support can be envisioned.

1. Introduction 

1. 
This CAS Completion Report (CASCR) presents an assessment o f the International 
Development Association’s (IDA) Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) f o r Ethiopia fo r FY03- 
05 and the Interim Country Assistance Strategy (ICAS) f o r FY06-07. The repo r t therefore 
covers FY03 -07 , re fe r red t o as the “review per iod” th roughou t this document. The C A S C R aims t o 
evaluate the effectiveness o f IDA’S strategies in i) a l ign ing the i r ob jec t ives with the coun try ’s l o n g 
t e r m strategic goals; and ii) con t r ibu t ing t o coun t ry goals by ach iev ing C A S and I C A S outcomes. 
In add i t ion , this repo r t w i l l evaluate t h e Bank ’s p o r t f o l i o performance, p rov ide lessons learned and 
highlight the issues tha t shou ld be dea l t with in the nex t CAS . I t i s based o n reference documents 
such as P ro jec t App ra isa l Documents, Imp lemen ta t ion Status and Resu l ts Reports, Imp lemen ta t ion 
Comp le t ion Repor ts and Econom ic and Sector W o r k comp le ted within the C A S and I C A S per iods . 
Fur thermore , this repo r t draws f r o m Independent Eva lua t ion G roup (IEG) and Qua l i ty Assurance 
G roup (Q AG ) eva lua t ions o f B a n k performance, and the self-assessment o f the coun t ry team as 
well as feedback f r o m clients, stakeholders, and partners. This repo r t also bene f i ted f r om the

II. CAS Context 

3. 
I n August 2002, the Government published its first Poverty Reduction Strategy-the 
Sustainable Development and Poverty Reduction Program (SDPRF’). The overarch ing 
ob jec t ive o f the strategy was t o reduce pove r ty th rough measures comp lemen tary t o g row th and at 
the same time t o ma in ta in macroeconom ic s tab i l i ty . The documen t had s trong ownersh ip within 
the Gove rnmen t and i t s prepara t ion was u t i l i z e d as a f o r um f o r p o l i c y discussions with c i v i l soc ie ty 
and the donors. Governmen t ’s Ag r icu l tu ra l Deve lopmen t Led Indus t r ia l iza t ion (ADLI) strategy 
took center stage in the SDPRP with the agr icu l ture sector-which 
coun ts f o r 40 percent o f 
na t iona l GDP, 90 percen t o f exports, 85 percent o f emp loymen t , and 90 percent o f the poor- 
considered k e y t ow a r d pove r ty reduc t ion . Others pillars o f the strategy inc luded : (i) c i v i l service 
re form ; (ii) governance, decen tra l iza t ion and empowerment; and (iii) capac i ty building. K e y 
sectoral r e f o rm areas, in add i t ion t o agriculture, were : (i) education; (ii) health; (iii) H I V / A I D S ; 
(iv) roads; (v) wa ter and sanitation; (vi) gender and deve lopmen t . In i t s f i r s t A n n u a l Progress

Repo r t o n the imp lemen ta t ion o f the SDPRP, the Governmen t added a m a j o r new p i l l a r o n food 
security. Governmen t ’s comm i tmen t t o SDPRP imp lemen ta t ion was shown by the increase o f p ro - 
poo r spending f r o m 43% o f to ta l governmen t expenditures in FY02 t o 62% in FY06, among the 
h ighes t o f any Sub-Saharan A f r i c a n coun t ry . Tab le 1 shows the progress towa rds the overarch ing 
ob jec t ives o f the SDPRP. 

4. 

In January 2007 the Gove rnmen t f ina l ized i t s second pove r ty reduc t ion strategy, ca l led the 
P lan f o r Acce lera ted and Sustained Deve lopmen t t o End Pove r ty (PASDEP), w h i c h builds o n the 
progress made under SDPRP. The P A SD E P places rap id and sustained g r ow t h at the center o f the 
strategy with a re -a f f i rmed focus o n p ro -poo r spending. The strategic emphasis o f the g row th p i l l a r 
i s p laced o n (i) market-based deve lopmen t o f agriculture; and (ii) p r iva te sector development. A 
s ign i f ican t innova t ion o f the P A SD E P i s i t s greater recogn i t ion o f the cen tra l r o l e o f u rban areas in 
g r ow t h and pove r ty reduc t ion . The strategy retains i t s s trong emphasis o n human deve lopmen t and 
aims t o build o n the m a j o r achievements o f SDPRP. 

SDPRP Outcome Indicators 

10% reduction in poverty headcount 

7% average annual GDP growth 
Average annual inflation in single digits, 
preferably less than 5% 

FYO3-07 Progress 

12.4% reduction in poverty headcount (from 44.2% in 
I999100 to 38.7% in 2004105) 
Average annual GDP growth of 11.8% (200314-200617) 
Average annual inflation of 12.1% (2003-2006) 

5 . 

The FY 0 3 -FY 0 5 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) fo r Ethiopia was based on the 
SDPRP and sought to focus Bank support around three strategic objectives: (i) enhancing 
pro-poor growth; (ii) improving human development outcomes; and (iii) reducing 
vulnerability. A l t h o u g h it was n o t prepared under the “results-based CAS” framework , the C A S 
recogn ized tha t the u l t ima te success o f W o r l d B a n k support t o E th iop ia w o u l d be measured by 
ach iev ing results o n the g round based o n SDPRP p r io r i t ies . Therefore, the C A S set ou t a 
f ramewo rk o f “Core C A S m o n i t o r i n g indicators.” The mon i to r ing f ramewo rk was further refined 
in the C A S Progress Repo r t o f August 2004. These mon i to r ing indicators, w h i c h are also used by 
this CASCR , covered most-but n o t a l l - o u t c o m e s tha t the C A S wan ted t o achieve. 

6. 

A new CAS was planned f o r FY 0 6 . However, the aftermath o f disputed May 2005 
elections led to an elevation in governance r i s k s that threatened continued progress on 
development. Acco rd ing ly , the B a n k dec ided t o d ra f t an I n t e r im C A S t o suppor t Governmen t in 
deve lop ing and imp lemen t ing , in consu l ta t ion with citizens, a strengthened p rog ram o f ins t i tu t ion 
building and governance r e f o rm t o h e l p in i t s e f fo r ts t o accelerate p ro -poo r g row th . Spec i f ica l ly , 
the I C A S focused B a n k suppor t a round f i v e strategic ob jec t ives : (i) deepen ing E th iop ia ’s ‘core’ 
governance program; (ii) p r o v i d i n g bas ic services f o r poo r peop le in a fa i r and accountable way; 
(iii) enhancing the inves tmen t c l ima te and ra is ing inves tor confidence; (iv) inc reas ing ag r icu l tu ra l 
p roduc t iv i ty ; and (v) deve lop ing in f ras t ruc tu re t o support deve lopmen t o f towns and g row th 
corr idors . As opposed t o a full CAS , the shorter t ime frame o f an I n t e r im Strategy was deemed t o 
be mo re appropriate in order t o a l l o w f o r a t rans i t iona l pe r iod where Governmen t , stakeholders, the 
Bank, and partners c o u l d deve lop consensus around a strengthened governance agenda. 

7 . 

One major shift under the ICAS was the Bank’s decision to suspend direct budget 
support, which the Bank had provided during FY04 -05 . The Bank , toge ther with o ther budget 
support donors in E th iop ia , based this dec is ion o n increased risks re la t ing t o governance, 
pa r t icu la r ly the risk tha t uncons tra ined budge t support cou ld be vu lnerab le t o p o l i t i c a l capture o r 
d ive rs ion f r om the core p r i o r i t y o f bas ic service delivery. Howeve r , the B a n k recogn ized tha t in 
the absence o f d i rec t budget support, deve lopmen t partners shou ld n o t abandon c r i t i c a l support t o

1. Pillar: Enhance p ro -poo r g row th 

10. 
O v e r a l l progress u n d e r the f i r s t strategic objective i s r a t e d mode ra te ly satisfactory. 
There has been m a j o r p ro -poo r g r ow t h over the review period, at rates unpa ra l le led in E th iop ia ’s 
l o n g h is to ry . G r o w t h averaged nea r ly 12 percent be tween 2003/04 and 2006/07 and g iven a 
re la t ive ly l o w l e v e l o f income inequa l i ty (estimated Gini o f 0.30) g r ow t h in E th iop ia has been 
inc lus ive and pro-poor . As shown in tab le 1, pove r ty rates have dec l ined s ign i f ican t ly . In 
particular, the three percentage p o i n t dec l ine in r u r a l pove r ty be tween 1999 /00 and 2004/05 
suggests tha t those in the poores t (rural) areas have been able t o bene f i t f r o m ag r icu l tu ra l g row th . 
However , while ag r icu l tu re g r ow t h has been ve ry strong, ag r icu l tu ra l p roduc t iv i ty rose on ly s low ly 
and the Bank ’s d ia logue in the sector y ie lded on ly limited progress. 

1 1 . 

The r e v i ew p e r i o d saw a no tab le shift in Government’s strategy with respect t o the ro le o f 
the p r iva te sector as the eng ine o f grow th , and tha t g row th i t s e l f i s n o w m u c h mo re cen t ra l ly a 
feature o f the deve lopmen t strategy, an evo lu t ion with w h i c h the B a n k has been c lose ly associated. 
As con f i rmed by the fo r thcom ing FY08 Inves tmen t C l ima te Assessment (ICA), there has also been 
tang ib le progress in im p r o v i n g the inves tmen t c l ima te and increas ing the r o l e o f the p r iva te sector 
in the economy, but a numbe r o f constraints t o p r iva te sector deve lopmen t rema in . K e y among 
these constraints i s the l i n g e r i n g ine f f ic iency o f the f inanc ia l sector, wh ich , acco rd ing t o the FY08 
I C A , func t ions p o o r l y in a l loca t ing scarce cap i ta l t o the mos t p roduc t ive f i r m s . The Bank ’s 
d ia logue has been espec ia l ly d i f f i c u l t in the area o f te lecommun ica t ion and the s low progress in the 
sector i s d isappo in t ing . Within the w i d e range o f in terven t ions cove red under this p i l la r , the roads 
sector (wh ich rece ived the larges t f inanc ia l support f r om IDA o f any single sector) stands ou t as an 
example o f s trong ach ievemen t . Energy generation has grown, but progress in increas ing access t o 
electricity-above a l l in r u r a l areas-remains s low .

12. 
Ru ra l growth has been remarkably strong, but progress i n agriculture productivity 
has been disappointing. The agr icu l ture sector has experienced n o t o n l y a remarkab le recovery 
f r o m the 1990s, but sustained g r ow t h at an annua l average ra te o f a lmos t 13 percent between 
2003/04 and 2006/07. Increases in agr icu l ture p roduc t iv i ty over the past decade can be exp la ined 
m a i n l y th rough area expans ion in response t o l ibe ra l iza t ion under ADLI since the 1990s. L a n d 
p roduc t iv i ty at 1.15 tons pe r hectare remains l o w and labo r p roduc t iv i ty ve ry l o w (va lue added per 
wo rke r in the ag r icu l tu re sectors i s US$144 vs. US$329 average f o r Sub-Saharan A f r ica ) . 
Subsistence ag r icu l tu ra l o n sma l l p lo ts o f land with l im i t e d i r r iga t ion and fe r t i l ize r use remains the 
predom inan t p roduc t ion mode l in m u c h o f E th iop ia . Coup led with this are severe env ironmen ta l 
degrada t ion in many par ts o f the coun t ry and high c l ima t ic va r iab i l i ty , lead ing t o recurren t weather 
shocks. 

13. 
Ove r the p e r i o d there was s ign i f ican t imp rovemen t in the manner o f p rov is ion o f 
ag r icu l tu ra l ex tens ion services, and some s ign i f ican t improvemen ts in f a rm l e v e l d ive rs i f ica t ion 
and ma rke t ing oppor tun i t ies . Respondents t o a C i t izens Repo r t Ca rd survey in 2005 were satisfied 
ove ra l l with ag r icu l tu re ex tens ion services and mo re than 5 8 percen t f e l t tha t ag r icu l tu ra l extension 
services have imp roved over the last t w o years. In add i t ion , there have been some success stories 
during the C A S / IC A S pe r iod with respect t o ag r icu l tu re research with imp roved var ie t ies reach ing 
higher c rop y ie lds . Recen t successes in the f l ow e r industry, where revenue generated fo r 2006/7

focus o n p r iva te sector investment. 

14. 
The Bank’s policy dialogue through the PRSC achieved limited progress in 
agriculture sector reform. Governmen t ’s ADL I strategy emphasizes in tens i f ica t ion to increase 
ag r icu l tu ra l p roduc t iv i ty focus ing o n a comb ina t ion o f techno logy , credit, fer t i l izers , seeds and 
imp roved management practices t o raise p roduc t iv i ty . The ADL I strategy evo lved over the review 
pe r iod p lac ing increased impor tance o n ma rke t ing and the p r iva te sector. The Bank ’s p o l i c y 
d ia logue i n i t i a l l y focused o n decreased governmen t in te rven t ion in the sector and-where 
there i s a 
ra t iona le f o r state involvement-the 
p romo t ion o f mo re e f fec t ive governmen t systems to support 
ag r icu l tu ra l deve lopmen t . Progress was s low at the beg inn ing o f the review pe r iod and the B a n k 
had t o reduce the o r i g i n a l l y agreed c red i t amounts f o r PRSC I and I1 by US$30 m i l l i o n and US$20 
m i l l i o n , respec t ive ly ( f r om US$150 m i l l i o n o r i g i n a l l y envisaged f o r each PRSC) due t o lack o f

r u r a l marke ts (in add i t ion t o telecoms, see be low) . 

15. 

However, a range o f timely and relevant analytic work allowed the Bank to improve 
i t s dialogue with Government. A Vu lne rab i l i ty and Risk Assessment was comp le ted in 2005, 
ana lyz ing the management o f risk as impo r tan t de term inan t o f pove r ty and ou t l ines soc ia l

w h i c h has a ma jo r focus and separate chapter o n agr icu l ture , con f i rmed these findings. I t found 
tha t an A D L I - l i k e strategy was s t i l l appropriate, even as ag r icu l tu re was los ing i t s ove ra l l impac t

34. 
As already discussed under the previous pillar, the Bank’s main focus during the 
review period was the transfer o f power and resources to sub-national levels o f government. 
The Bank ’s innova t ive f inanc ing (e.g. the Pub l ic Sector Capac i ty Building Suppor t Pro jec t and the 
PBS pro jec t) and ana ly t ics (e.g. the Jo in t Budget and Aid Rev iew ) con t r ibu ted t o imp roved

Key Outcome Ind ica tors 
Improved public expenditure management and 
financial accountability, as evidenced by PEFA 
indicator scores 
Improved income and non-income incentive 
environment for public servants measured by a 
gender disaggregated wage decompression 
ratio and privatelpublic comparators 

FYO3-07 Progress 
The 2007 PEFA assessment shows that there has been a 
fairly successful track record of public financial 
management improvements at the Federal level. 
Public salary increased during the review period. Wage 
decompression ratio is 1:16.5 (2006). 

35. While much work remains to be done, improvements have been noted in modernizing 
fiscal and financial management and some evidence f o r an improved incentive environment 
in the civil service. The 2007 P E F A assessment shows tha t at the Fede ra l l e v e l the budge t process

effectiveness, ove ra l l tax revenues increased f r om 1.1 b i l l i o n Birr in 2003 t o 1.9 b i l l i o n Birr in

The Bank contributed t o progress through innovative and joint financing and 
analytics. PSCAP ca ta lyzed the fo rma t ion o f a mu l t i -sec to ra l SWAP f o r p u b l i c sector re forms . 
The SWAP aims to : (i) imp rove the scale, e f f ic iency , and responsiveness o f p u b l i c service de l ive ry

Progress on strengthening decentralization on the woreda level has been substantial. 
As men t ioned above, woredus are n o w responsible fo r a large p ropo r t ion o f bas ic service de l ivery :

IV. Measuring Bank Performance 

48. 
Levels o f financing were below “base case” in the CAS, but slightly higher than 
envisioned under the ICAS. B a n k lending over the C A S p e r i o d (FY03-05) was US$1,174 
m i l l ion ; b e l ow the “base case” lend ing scenario o f US$1,504 m i l l i o n . This sho r t fa l l was due t o 
lack o f ava i lab i l i ty o f IDA 13 resources, as fron t load ing by o ther coun tr ies reduced the amoun t o f 
IDA ava i lab le t o E th iop ia . B a n k lend ing over the I C A S pe r iod (FY06-07) was U S $ l , 135 m i l l i o n . 
Overa l l , there have been n o m a j o r dropped pro jec ts o r slippages f r o m t h e f inanc ing p rog ram as 
envisaged under the CAS and I C A S . Some pro jec ts env is ioned in the FY03 C A S were fo lded in to

An Ethiopia Country Program Assessment during FY2003-2005 by the Quality 
Assurance Group (QAG) was satisfactory overall. The Q A G pane l ra ted the E th iop ia coun t ry 
p rog ram as highly pos i t ive with respect t o responsiveness t o governmen t p lans and needs, strategic 
relevance o f ana ly t ica l e f fo r ts and lend ing interventions, coo rd ina t ion with donors, t h e design and

unp lanned ac t iv i t ies , such as PSNP w h i c h was in t roduced in response t o the Government’s n e w 
F o o d Secur i ty Program, demonstrated the Bank ’s responsiveness t o chang ing p r io r i t ies .

Within the latest Country Portfolio Performance Review fo r FY 2006, a rev iew o f the

transparency and accoun tab i l i ty , (ii) f inanc ia l management, (iii) procurement, and (iv) M&E. Weak

number o f agreed ac t ions were implemented, i n c l u d i n g t ra in ing programs, these prob lems con t inue

V. Pronram-wide Lessons Learned and Issues for the new CASz7 

52. 
F o r projects under implementation, the Bank and Government will need to continue 
to apply measures instituted to further enhance transparency and accountability, especially 
at the local level. These measures inc lude : using clear and transparent c r i te r ia f o r selecting pro jec t 
sites and beneficiaries; ensuring greater invo lvemen t o f a b road range o f stakeholders in pro jec t 
prepara t ion and imp lemen ta t ion ; s treng then ing M&E systems and ope ra t iona l iz ing them in a mo re 
pa r t ic ipa to ry manner; s treng then ing imp lemen ta t ion support, pa r t icu la r ly ove rs igh t o n t h e f iduc ia ry 
aspects o f pro jec ts . F o r new p ro jec ts w i l l be designed with measures t o strengthen transparency, 
loca l accoun tab i l i ty , and overs igh t mechanisms. 

53. 
I t i s important f o r the Bank to stay engaged in constructive manner during shocks 
rather than pull-out all support. The Bank ’s partnership with E th iop ia i s long - te rm and events 
l i k e the contested 2005 e lec t ions might change the t e r m s o f engagement, but shou ld n o t rad ica l ly 
alter the Bank’s ove ra l l invo lvemen t in the coun try . The B a n k reacted in a very measured and 
timely manner by shifting i t s suppor t f r om general budget suppor t t o the highly innova t ive PBS 
project, w h i c h a l lowed the B a n k and o ther donors stay engaged. The B a n k thereby acted as a 
s tab i l iz ing force and assured con t inua t ion in the imp rovemen t o f governance and service de l ive ry 
t o poo r people. 

54. 
Despite the successful shift in financing modalities from PRSCs to PBS in reaction to 
the 2005 cr is is , the benefits o f PRSCs were apparent and could not be fully replicated by 
PBS, as a more narrowly focused investment instrument. The two PRSCs had an ove ra l l 
pos i t ive impac t and ca ta lyzed many impo r tan t re forms . They p rov ided and impo r tan t f o r um f o r 
dialogue, espec ia l ly o n i s s u e s re la ted t o g r ow t h and s truc tura l re fo rms tha t w o u l d need t o be 
continued, e.g. t o push f o r fu r the r re fo rms in te lecom and the ove ra l l deve lopmen t o f a marke t 
economy. The p u b l i c expend i ture f ramewo rk and governmen ta l transfer systems are well- 
deve loped t o a l l ow budge t suppor t t o have i t s in tended impac t . In add i t ion , d ia logue within t h e 
PRSC enhances dono r ha rmon iza t ion and reduces transac t ion costs. These fac tors argue f o r the 
cons idera t ion o f resum ing PRSCs as soon as donors and governmen t agree tha t cond i t ions are 
appropriate. 

55. 
The next CAS will need to develop a more comprehensive results and monitoring 
framework. The 2003 CAS a l igned the Bank ’s p rog ram with b road ob jec t ives . I t l i s t e d a few 
m o n i t o r i n g ind ica tors tha t were, however , insu f f ic ien t t o link B a n k con t r ibu t ion t o outcomes. The 
new CAS w i l l need t o inc lude a mo re l o g i c a l resu l ts cha in with tha t links coun t ry goals with 
outcomes, outputs and m i les tones tha t w i l l fac i l i ta te mon i to r ing o f CAS progress a t var ious stages 
o f the CAS per iod .
