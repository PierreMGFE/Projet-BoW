SRI LANKA — COUNTRY ASSISTANCE STRATEGY 

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

A CHANGED CONTEXT 

This Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) is being presented to the Board at a challenging 
time for Sri Lanka, in circumstances that are significantly different from those in 2003 
when the last CAS was presented. Echoing the broad-based sense of optimism at that time, the 
previous CAS was aligned to support the goals of peace, economic growth and equity.   

In terms of peace, developments during the last five years have been sobering. After a temporary 
slowdown in armed confrontation following the 2002 ceasefire agreement (CFA), violence 
reemerged in 2005, resulting in renewed and major human suffering. The Rajapakse Government 
has made it clear that while it is pursuing military operations to eradicate terrorism, it is also fully 
committed to finding a political solution to address the legitimate grievances of Sri Lanka’s 
minority communities. Although local government elections for the East were held in the spring 
of 2008, the political process towards increased devolution and local self-determination, 
spearheaded by the All Party Representative Committee, still has a considerable way to go.    

Despite the escalating conflict, economic growth has been strong since 2003—averaging 6.3 
percent per annum. But macroeconomic imbalances, particularly high inflation and persistent 
budget deficits, are emerging as serious concerns.  

Despite aggregate economic growth, increasing inequality held back poverty reduction during the 
1990s. While the latest Household Survey indicates that the last decade’s seemingly unstoppable 
increase in inequality is finally abating, at least in the non-conflict areas, the challenge of 
accelerating and sustaining growth outside the Western Province remains.  

Besides the three goals of peace, growth, and equity, the previous CAS also had to respond 
rapidly to the devastating tsunami that hit Sri Lanka in late 2004. 

In light of this complex and challenging environment, the new CAS adopts a more focused 
approach to the areas of engagement and a more flexible approach to the nature of the 
Bank's engagement in Sri Lanka. The design of the CAS has been informed by extensive 
consultations not only with the Government but also with a broad cross-section of Sri Lankan 
society across many parts of the country. The consultations and the experiences from 
implementing the previous CAS have shaped the Bank’s thinking, both about what the Bank 
should be focusing on in terms of its assistance and how best to deliver that assistance.   

THE ‘WHAT’ OF BANK ASSISTANCE 

The Bank will support the overall objectives of the Government’s vision for economic 
development laid out in the ‘Mahinda Chintana—10-year Development Framework’. The 
Mahinda Chintana aims at accelerating growth, with particular emphasis on the achievement of 
equitable development, recognizing that there has been a “perpetuation of income disparities, 
both among income earners and geographic regions”. The Mahinda Chintana focuses on three 
main areas: (i) achieving more equitable development through accelerated rural development; (ii) 
accelerating growth through increased investment in infrastructure; and (iii) strengthening public 
service delivery. These objectives were validated during the CAS consultations and serve as our 
overarching objectives.  

i

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In order to maximize impact and mitigate risks, the Bank has designed a cautious program 
of interventions that can deliver positive development outcomes in poor and underserved 
areas, even in Sri Lanka’s changed circumstances. The proposed lending program is based on 
a series of narrowly-scoped investment projects. The program strongly emphasizes community-
focused projects and projects delivered through local and provincial governments. These projects 
aim to provide infrastructure, public services and livelihoods at the local level. In line with the 
Government’s priorities and the inputs the Bank received during its public consultations for this 
CAS, particular emphasis will be laid on improving connectivity and market access through 
rehabilitation and enhancement of the road network. The program will also prioritize assistance 
for reconstruction and service delivery in conflict-affected areas, including support for nascent 
local government institutions in the East.   

The Bank will systematically seek to build domestic constituencies for policy reform and 
facilitate the sharing of international best practices. The Bank’s experience from the last CAS 
shows that while it may not always be feasible to pursue grand reforms, it is nonetheless 
productive to pursue incremental improvements whenever possible. The Bank must be agile in 
exploiting openings for policy reforms if and when they appear, and carry out continuous 
consultations to build constituencies for policy and institutional changes. This was echoed during 
the CAS consultations which revealed a strong demand for the Bank to more systematically 
engage diverse audiences, including through partnerships with local think-tanks and civil society 
organizations, to more proactively facilitate the sharing of international best practices and 
expertise with Sri Lankan audiences, and to nurture public policy discussions. 

The IFC will further strengthen its rapidly scaled up engagement in Sri Lanka. On the 
investment side, IFC provides additionality by offering longer-term capital than is otherwise 
available in the Sri Lankan market. The IFC will increasingly reach out to second-tier, smaller 
clients and help develop the domestic financial market. On the advisory side, the IFC will 
continue to provide services through the South-East Asia Enterprise Development Facility, a five-
year, multi-donor trust fund established especially for this purpose. The IFC and the Bank will 
further enhance collaboration to leverage their joint impact, as successfully done, for example, 
with the ongoing Bank Group support for rural electrification.  

THE ‘HOW’ OF BANK ASSISTANCE 

The Bank’s experience from the last CAS shows that it has the ability to implement projects 
even under highly adverse conditions. There is no denying that maintaining the quality of the 
Bank portfolio in Sri Lanka’s volatile operating environment is a challenge.  Several projects 
have faced implementation difficulties on account of the escalating conflict.  But through robust 
project design and strong field-based supervision, the Bank has demonstrated its ability to deliver 
relevant development outcomes on the ground and rapidly adapt to changing circumstances when 
it must—as evidenced, for example, by the change in focus from infrastructure to livelihoods in 
community driven development in conflict-affected areas. The Bank will aim high in project 
implementation with the support of its broad network among civil society organizations. 

As the conflict looms large over Sri Lanka, it is critical that the Bank’s engagement be 
highly conflict-sensitive. Our work in Sri Lanka needs to minimize the risk of Bank activities 
inadvertently fueling ethnic tensions and further straining Sri Lanka’s social fabric. Furthermore, 
we need to manage the reputational risk of being perceived as a partial or biased actor on the 
development scene. At the program level, the Bank will not allow resources committed for the 
North and East to be reprogrammed to other parts of the country, even if a deteriorating situation 

ii

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
on the ground renders it impossible to implement activities in the North and East. At the project 
level, greater conflict-sensitivity in design, implementation, and monitoring and evaluation will 
be achieved by subjecting all lending operations to a ‘conflict filter’. The conflict filter will 
require projects to show that benefits are transparently distributed and potential tensions are 
mitigated through broad-based consultations and credible redress mechanisms.   

The Bank will systematically seek opportunities to address the causes and consequences of 
the conflict. The North and East of the country have been most severely affected by the last 25 
years of fighting and displacements. Against this background, the Bank will emphasize efforts to 
improve access to public services and enhance livelihood opportunities in conflict-affected areas, 
with a particular focus on rehabilitation of roads, irrigation networks and water supply. The Bank 
would also provide assistance to address traumatized people’s needs in the conflict-affected areas. 
In addition, the Bank will seek to enhance inter-ethnic awareness by helping to expand the social 
space for people belonging to different communities. This would be done, for example, in 
education programs, by supporting English as a link language, working towards mixed Tamil-
Sinhalese schooling and teachers’ education, and encouraging members of different ethnic groups 
to work together around common goals in community driven development initiatives.  

MANAGING RISKS 

The CAS responds to the country’s current needs and emerging opportunities while taking 
into consideration ongoing uncertainties and risks. Despite careful selection and design, the 
proposed program remains vulnerable to further deterioration because of the conflict and requires 
careful implementation and adaptation. Deepening the Bank’s existing networks of civil society 
organizations and development partners will help the Bank to monitor and assess these risks. The 
enhanced emphasis on conflict sensitivity will help mitigate the Bank’s reputational risks. 
Managing the significant macroeconomic risks arising from persistently high fiscal deficits, high 
inflation and Sri Lanka’s vulnerability to external shocks, requires strong corrective measures by 
the Government—a point emphasized in our ongoing policy dialogue. Finally, the Bank faces 
considerable fiduciary risks, in particular in the North and East, where the situation is especially 
volatile and where intensive supervision is most challenging.   

At the same time, we believe that there are substantial benefits to the Bank’s engagement in Sri 
Lanka, both in assisting the Government in fulfilling its long-term vision of accelerating growth 
and reducing poverty, and in proactively addressing the causes and consequences of the conflict. 
These would be lost if the Bank were to disengage. In this sense, there are also significant 
development and reputational risks to the Bank from not remaining substantially engaged in Sri 
Lanka. This CAS strikes a balance between the development and reputational risks of remaining 
engaged as Sri Lanka’s long-standing development partner in this fluid and complex situation, 
against the development and reputational risks of disengagement. 

ISSUES FOR THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS: 

1) Is the proposed Country Assistance Strategy—including its conflict-sensitive approach—likely 
to be robust and flexible enough to mitigate the development and reputational risks of the Bank’s 
engagement in Sri Lanka?.  2)  Is the proposed program of activities and choice of instruments 
appropriate, considering the country circumstances and the Bank’s comparative advantages?

1.  COUNTRY CONTEXT 

A. 

RECENT POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS 

1. 
The political landscape has changed significantly since the last CAS. At the time of 
the previous CAS, the incumbent Sri Lankan Government was an uneasy cohabitation between 
President Chandrika Kumaratunge of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) and Prime Minister 
Ranil Wickremasinghe of the United National Front (UNF). This arrangement ended in early 
2004. The President dissolved the Parliament and called for elections. At the elections held in 
April 2004, the United People’s Freedom Alliance (UPFA)—a coalition led by the SLFP under 
President Kumaratunge’s leadership—captured Parliamentary power. The coalition consisted of a 
few political groups, including the nationalistic left-wing party Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna 
(JVP). In mid-2005, the JVP left the Government due to conflicts within the governing coalition. 
The immediate issue which led to the break-up of the coalition was the proposed tsunami aid 
sharing agreement (P-TOMS) that the President proposed to sign with the LTTE (Liberation 
Tigers of Tamil Eelam). (P-TOMS was later declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court). In 
November 2005, Mahinda Rajapakse, who had been Prime Minister since 2004, won the 
presidential election. He continues to be supported by a coalition of political parties in the 
Parliament, including a number of MPs (Members of Parliament) belonging to the United 
National Party (UNP) who ‘crossed over’ and joined his Government in 2006. His Government 
currently holds 123 seats in the 225-seat strong Parliament. 

2. 
The Sri Lankan conflict has deep historical roots. Some trace the origins of the Sri 
Lankan ethnic conflict to the ‘divide and rule policies’ of the British whose colonial rule ended 
with the country’s independence in 1948; others trace it much further back. Several post-
independence events accentuated the existing problems. One such widely cited event is the 
Sinhala Only Act of 1956 which gave official status only to the language of the majority Sinhala 
community that makes up around 75 percent of the population. Though the Tamil language was 
given official recognition later, political confrontations between the Sinhalese and the Tamils 
continued. The armed separatist conflict emerged in the mid-1980s, at a time when the economy 
was simultaneously moving forward with a major reform program following economic 
liberalization in the late 1970s. In spite of various attempts at peacemaking, this conflict 
continues to lead to substantial loss of life and property. Though the ceasefire agreement (CFA) 
of 2002 was aimed at creating the necessary space for a lasting peace settlement, six rounds of 
peace talks in 2002 and 2003 failed to produce tangible progress, with the two sides blaming each 
other for the failure of negotiations. After a temporary slowdown in armed confrontations 
following the CFA, violence reemerged, including the assassination of the Foreign Minister by 
the LTTE in August 2005.   

3. 
According to the Rajapakse Government, Sri Lanka’s ethnic problem has two 
elements—a 'terrorist' element attributed to the LTTE and a ‘genuine grievances’ element 
felt by the minority communities. On this basis, the Government views the solutions as falling 
into two components—military operations to ‘eradicate terrorism’ and a political solution to 
address the genuine ethnic element of the conflict. In February 2006, there were attempts to 

1

 
 
revive the peace talks when the parties met in Geneva, but no noticeable progress was achieved. 
As a part of its effort towards finding a political solution, the Government, in September 2006, 
initiated an All Party Representative Committee (APRC) process to build a ‘Southern’ consensus 
in Parliament about constitutional amendments. In particular, this process was expected to help 
with the devolution of power to sub-national authorities and pave the way for a negotiated 
solution. In parallel, arguing that elimination of terrorism is essential for a sustainable political 
solution, the Government stepped up military activities against the LTTE following several 
violent incidents, and used the military to reopen an irrigation canal that the LTTE had forcibly 
closed.  

4. 
In July 2007, after intense armed confrontations, the Government restored its 
authority over the LTTE-held areas in the Eastern Province. During the one-year period of 
confrontations, about 5,000 lives were lost and over 300,000 people displaced. This period also 
witnessed an increase in allegations of human rights violations by all parties involved in the 
armed conflict. The Government established a Ministry of Human Rights, created a presidential 
commission to inquire into these allegations, and initiated a witness protection program. These 
initiatives appear to need more time to have a significant impact on the ground. In the Eastern 
Province, where 153,000 Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) have moved back to their home 
villages1, security-related restrictions on civilian movement still prevail. The presence of 
paramilitary groups, which are torn by internal rivalries, is said to be an impediment to the 
restoration of civilian life. In a move to restore normalcy in the East, local government elections 
for the predominantly Tamil Batticaloa District were held on March 10, 2008. The elections were 
free of violence but the non-participation of the UNP and the TNA (Tamil National Alliance) 
was, however, perceived by some to reduce the fairness of the election.  Elections for the Eastern 
Provincial Council have been announced for May 10, 2008. All political parties with a vote base 
in the Province are likely to contest.   

5. 
On January 2, 2008, the Government announced its intention to unilaterally 
abrogate the CFA. The abrogation can, to some extent, be viewed as a ‘formalization’ of the 
situation on the ground that has prevailed since 2006, although the international community and 
other stakeholders are concerned that this would further intensify armed confrontations. The 
abrogation also implies that the Sri Lanka Monitoring Mission (SLMM), tasked with monitoring 
ceasefire violations by the two sides, has been disbanded. The Government has argued that the 
abrogation of the CFA would increase the political space and opportunity for finding a political 
solution. In the meantime, armed confrontations and consequent displacements have shifted to the 
North. 

6. 
On January 23, 2008, the APRC issued an ‘Interim Report’ on its proposed political 
solution, while stating that it would continue to work on a final report. The APRC’s 
recommendations focus mainly on the rapid implementation of the 13th Amendment to the 
Constitution which has not been fully implemented since its introduction as part of the 1987 Indo-
Lanka agreement2. Although there is criticism that this is not sufficient to gain the support of the 
Tamil community, the Government says it has given precedence to finding a practicable rather 
than the ideal solution. According to the Government, past experience shows that any 
constitutional change is rendered impractical within the present constitutional framework, 
electoral system, and fragmented political party system. The Government considers it more 
feasible to pursue maximum devolution within the existing legislation rather than seek new

recommendations, however, remain to be seen.   

B. 

THE ECONOMY 

7. 
Sri Lanka has achieved three decades of sustained growth, averaging 4.9 percent 
annually since 1977. In conjunction with modest population growth, this has resulted in a 
doubling of per capita incomes over the past three decades—to over US$ 1,600 in 2007. Well-
ahead of other countries in the region, Sri Lanka initiated broad-based liberalization and 
deregulation in 1977, with a gradual reduction in license controls on foreign trade. The process 
continued with other initiatives—for example, membership of WTO in 1995, signing of the Indo-
Lanka Free Trade Agreement in 1998 (from which the tariff phase-out is expected to be 
completed this year), floating of the exchange rate in 2001, and implementation of the South 
Asian Free Trade Agreement in 2006. In the domestic economy there were parallel reforms, in 
particular in the areas of reforming public enterprises through privatization, and facilitating 
private sector participation in the telecommunications, gas and power, port, aviation, insurance, 
and finance sectors. These policy decisions have served the country well—by laying the 
foundations for today’s strong export sector and rapidly expanding telecom sector, and the 
gradual shift from reliance on primary sectors to industry and services. They have helped 
transform the Sri Lankan economy from an inward-looking economy focused on self-sufficiency 
to a competitive export-oriented economy. The results are impressive: the share of exports to 
GDP in 2007 had increased to 29.2 percent, compared to less than 5 percent in the 1970s, and the 
export base had been diversified away from the traditional tea and rubber exports to include, 
notably, large exports of garments. Sri Lanka, however, is still underperforming relative to 
several of its East Asian neighbors and particularly, in recent years, vis-à-vis India, suggesting 
that Sri Lanka is not fully exploiting its potential, in part due to the ongoing conflict.

investment—but exports have 
also been buoyant; there are signs that 
consumption and investment growth 
decelerated 
in 2007. The gradual 
recovery from the tsunami, coupled 
with the substantial inflow of foreign 
remittances 
and 
increased 
affordability of services such as telecommunications, have all contributed to the robust economy. 
Significant inflows of remittances from the large Sri Lankan workforce abroad, amounting to 7.2 
percent of GDP in 2007, are another source of resilience of the Sri Lankan economy. In this 
growth environment, the official unemployment rate (excluding the North and East) declined 
from 8.1 percent in 2004 to 5.5 percent in the fourth quarter of 2007.

Inflation 
has 
been 
accelerating since early 2006, partly 
as a result of rising world market 
prices of food and oil. Inflation 
reached 25.0 percent in April 2008 
(year on year) (16.0 percent on a year-
average basis), and has yet to show 
signs of abating. Domestic 
food 
prices, which make up about 46 
percent of the basket in the Sri 
Lankan Consumer Price Index (CPI), 
have 
increased 
in 
line with 
international trends and are the item 
predominantly responsible for the rise 
in the overall CPI.  Moreover, since 
the 
Government 
re-introduced 
periodic revisions to domestic fuel 
prices in April 2006, rising prices of 
fuel—in 
line with 
international 
trends—have further contributed to 
inflation. Since April 2006, the retail 
prices of petroleum and diesel have 
increased by about 60 percent. Since 
May 2007, 
the Government has 
allowed the price of kerosene (mostly 
used by the poor) to increase by about 
40 percent.

10. Monetary growth has fueled 
inflation, although the growth in 
monetary aggregates has declined 
in recent months. Although 
the 
nominal interest rate on Government 
securities increased sharply during 
2007 (approximately 700 basis points 
for Treasury bills), real interest rates 
have been low or even negative for 
significant parts of the past two years, 
which 
has made 
borrowing 
exceedingly 
attractive. Monetary 
growth has also, at times, been fueled 
by bank financing of the fiscal deficit. 
In 2006, 
the Central Bank’s net 
financing of the Government deficit 
was equivalent to 1.3 percent of GDP, 
while it was equivalent to -0.3 of the 
GDP in 2007. There is a risk that 
continued high inflation will entrench 
inflationary expectations and make 
future attempts to curb inflation considerably more difficult.

Figure 5.   Central Government Budget Deficit 

11. 
The fiscal deficit remains 
high despite recent consolidation 
efforts 
and 
is 
a 
source 
of 
macroeconomic 
instability. 
Sri 
Lanka has had historically high fiscal 
deficits of about 8 percent of GDP 
during the past decade, and deficits 
have persisted despite the introduction 
of 
the 
Fiscal Management 
Responsibility Act 
(2003) 
and 
commendable 
progress 
in 
tax 
collection during the past few years 
due 
to 
administrative 
and 
organizational measures. The revenue 
to GDP ratio increased from 13.7 
percent in 2003 to 15.8 percent in 
2007, as tax loopholes were closed and collection efforts intensified. However, the revenue-to-
GDP ratio in 2007 was 0.5 percentage points lower than in 2006; the decline was in part due to 
reduced import duties on essential food items. On the expenditure side, the ratio of recurrent 
expenditures to GDP has hovered around 18 percent during the past five years, but declined to 
17.4 percent of GDP in 2007 from 18.6 percent in 2006. In 2007, interest payments accounted for 
27 percent of total recurrent expenditures (4.8 percent of GDP). The public sector wage bill 
(including for defense) accounted for another 34 percent (6 percent of GDP). Various subsidies 
(for example petroleum, electricity, railways, fertilizers, etc.) have also traditionally been a 
considerable drain on public finances but aggressive pricing reforms of fuel and electricity have 
reduced this recently. The Government maintains that it is committed to adhering to the Fiscal 
Management Responsibility Act (FMRA) which stipulates a maximum allowable deficit of 5 
percent of GDP, but its target year has been shifted from the initial 2006 to 2010. High and 
persistent fiscal deficits have resulted in high public debt. At the end of 2007, total public sector 
debt amounted to 86 percent of GDP, of which about half was foreign-currency denominated. 
This, however, is an improvement from the situation nearly three years ago when the public debt 
was over 100 percent of GDP. The reduction in debt over the years is mostly attributable to faster 
growth in nominal GDP relative to the debt stock, although exchange rate movements have also 
had some impact on the debt to GDP ratio.

higher oil prices, also has been a contributing factor. The current account deficit reached 4.2 
percent of GDP in 2007 which, however, is a decline compared to 2006 when it was 5.9 percent 
of GDP. The widening trade deficit (12 percent of GDP in 2007 compared to 8.4 percent of GDP 
in 2003) has been partially offset by increased remittance transfers from the large pool of Sri 
Lankan workers abroad—net private transfers reached 9 percent of GDP in 2007, up from 6.6 
percent in 2003. Since the time the Rupee was floated (2001), with the exception of 2004, the 
country has recorded surpluses in the overall balance of payments (BOP) despite the current 
account being continuously negative. The main sources of BOP support are increased foreign 
direct investment (FDI) inflows (although still relatively low by international standards) and the 
increased debt capital inflows, following the ‘measured’ opening up of the capital account where 
the authorities opened up a limited portion of Sri Lanka’s Treasury bond market to foreigners. In 
addition, the Government, in October 2007, floated its first sovereign bond issue. As a result, 
foreign reserves have strengthened and the reserve cover stood at about 3.6 months of imports by 
end-February 2008. 

C. 

POVERTY REDUCTION 

13. 
Poverty has declined rapidly in the past five years recent years, on account of strong 
economic growth with little change in inequality of consumption between people and 
regions. The Department of Census and Statistics has just reported that the national poverty 
headcount, as measured by the Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES) 2006/07, is 15 
percent, which is a sharp decline from the 23 percent headcount reported in 2002. This positive 
development is coupled with the good news that most of the reported decline occurred in regions 
outside the Western Province (WP), reducing the large gaps seen in 2002 between WP and the 
rest of the country. For example, the Southern Province halved its poverty from 28 percent in 
2002 to 14 percent in 2006/7, which brings it much closer to the poverty rate of WP (11 percent 
in 2002 and 8 percent in 2006/07). In parallel, interpersonal inequality appears to have stabilized 
after rising through the 1990s. The Gini coefficient of per capita consumption was 0.40 in 
2006/07, unchanged from the 2002 level. No worsening in interpersonal inequality, coupled with 
significant poverty reduction in lagging regions, suggests that economic growth between 2002 
and 2006/07 was equitably distributed among the rich and poor and different regions of the 
country. More detailed diagnostic work, which has not been conducted with the 2006/07 data yet, 
would however be necessary to identify the underlying factors that explain the recent trends. 

14. 
The poverty and inequality changes since 2002 are in sharp contrast to the period 
between 1990/91 and 2002 when overall poverty declined by only 3 percentage points (from 
26 to 23 percent)—mainly due to increasing interpersonal and regional inequality. The Gini 
coefficient increased from 0.32 in 1990/91 to 0.40 in 2002, considerably more than in other 
countries in South Asia. Gaps between WP and the rest of the country widened and estate poverty 
increased sharply during this period. Simulations based on these trends had suggested that Sri 
Lanka would fall short of the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) of halving poverty by 2015 
from the 1991 level. But, given the reduction between 2002 and 2006/07, the country can be 
expected to reach its poverty MDG target well before 2015—if the recent trend is sustained. 

15. 
The poverty and inequality trends reported above largely exclude the North and 
East. These regions were not covered by the 1990/91 and 2002 HIES due to security concerns; 
but the 2006/07 estimates include parts of the Eastern Province. While a few other surveys have 
covered the North and East partially in recent years, none of them yield consumption poverty 
estimates and all of them were unable to field adequate samples (see Box 1). The absence of 
conflict-affected areas in HIES data also implies that the rest of the country, mentioned above, 
refers to provinces not directly affected by conflict.      

6

 
Box 1.  Availability of Household Data for the Conflict-affected North and East 

None of the HIES surveys from 1990/91 to 2002 could cover the North and East due to the security situation that 
prevailed at the time the surveys were being fielded. While an attempt was made in 2002 to take advantage of the 
ceasefire at that time, the worsening security situation made it impossible to collect year-round data on a sample that 
was representative enough. The 2006/07 survey covered a large part of the Eastern Province but excluded the 
Trincomalee district and some of the remote areas of the Batticaloa and Ampara districts. The HIES in Sri Lanka does 
not provide information on education, health and other social sector indicators. Surveys that typically do so—namely 
the Consumer Finance and Socio Economic Survey (2003-04), Labor Force Survey (various rounds), and the 
Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS; various rounds, latest in 2004)—include parts of the North and East but 
exclude large areas. None of these sources is appropriate for estimating consumption poverty and inequality; while they 
provide some indication of the non-income dimensions of welfare in the North and East, these indicators may not 
accurately reflect the conditions in the two provinces due to the surveys’ inability to cover many areas 

16. 
In spite of the broad-based poverty reduction from 2002 to 2006/07, some of the 
concerns about poverty and inequality which were highlighted in earlier data continue to be 
valid. Firstly, the improvements from 2002 to 2006/07 did not include the estates, where the 
poverty rate has increased from 30 to 32 percent. Secondly, while the differences in poverty and 
incomes between the WP and the rest of the country have declined, the gaps are still very large. 
The poverty rate for WP, at 8 percent, is almost half the national average while for Uva and 
Sabaragamuwa, it remains high at about 10 percentage points above the national average. Annual 
per capita income in the WP exceeded US$ 2,000 in 2006, compared to US$ 800 for the rest of 
the country (Table 1). While WP has sustained annual average growth of more than 6 percent per 
annum since 1997, the rest of the country has grown by only about 3 percent per annum during 
the same period. Thirdly, although interpersonal inequality did not worsen from 2002 to 2006/07, 
the Gini coefficient of consumption was still the highest among all South Asian countries. Given 
these disparities, the Government’s emphasis in its 10-year development framework on equitable 
growth, with particular focus on lagging regions, continues to be relevant. 

17. While detailed diagnostic work with HIES 2006/07 data is still awaited, analysis 
with 2002 HIES data has shown that a range of factors limit economic opportunities for 
poor households in Sri Lanka. Poverty is most significantly associated with a higher number of 
dependents in the household, employment of household heads in the informal sector, lack of 
assets, and deficiencies in human capital. Although primary enrollment and literacy are near-
universal in Sri Lanka, low education attainment is prevalent among the poor. In 2002, over 30 
percent of households where the heads of the households had schooling up to grade 5, were poor, 
compared with less than 10 percent where household heads had completed at least grade 9. Net 
enrollment among children for grades 10–13 among the lowest income quintile is only half that of 
the richest quintile. Rich-poor differences also occur in birth-weight, malnutrition among 
preschool children, and nutritional status of adult women. Demographic and Health Survey 
(DHS) data shows that 47 percent of children (between age 3 months and 5 years) in the poorest 
quintile were underweight compared to 11 percent in the richest quintile, and 37 percent of 
women in the poorest quintile had low BMI (body mass index) compared to 10 percent in the 
richest.   

18. 
Poverty is also associated with isolation from markets and poor access to 
infrastructure facilities like electricity. Lack of connectivity to markets appears to be a 
particularly common characteristic of poor areas in Sri Lanka and, consistent with this, is 
identified by rural non-farm enterprises as a critical constraint they face along with other factors 
like poor access to and quality of electricity, and limited access to finance. Improving 
connectivity and access to infrastructure is therefore likely to bring significant benefits to lagging 

7

 
 
 
regions. In this context, the Government’s focus on investing in infrastructure development seems 
consistent with the needs of the poor in the lagging regions in particular. 

19. 
The sharp rise in poverty in estates during the past decade is a cause for serious 
concern. While the national poverty rate declined by 11 percentage points from 1990/91 to 
2006/07, the estate poverty rate increased by 12 percentage points–this makes the estate poverty 
rate in 2006/07 more than double the national average. Analysis of HIES data up to 2002, as well 
as non-HIES data sources, suggests a number of key features of estate poverty. Firstly, 
movements in the poverty headcount rate can overstate the welfare changes in the estates—a high 
degree of clustering of the estate population around the poverty line implies that even small 
shocks can produce a large increase in the poverty rate. Secondly, rising poverty in the estates is 
partly explained by a fall in the average number of income-earners in estate households between 
1990/01 and 2002, and can also be linked to growing unwillingness among the estate youth to 
work on the estates, even though work opportunities outside remain limited. Thirdly, many of the 
factors that limit the opportunities of the poor in remote, rural areas also apply to the estate poor. 
But the estate poor are especially disadvantaged in terms of mobility and economic opportunities 
on account of isolation. For example, lack of access to all-weather roads connecting estates to 
towns and the resident labor structure prevalent in most estates, contribute to their social isolation 
from the mainstream. This is evidenced, for example, by the high share of estate workers who do 
not have National Identity Cards.  

20. Most non-income indicators among estate residents have improved over the last 
decade but still lag significantly behind those for even rural (non-estate) Sri Lankans. For 
example, in 2000, 37 percent of estate children were stunted compared with 14 percent of rural 
children, and 48 percent of estate mothers had low BMI compared with 23 percent of rural 
mothers. Other than higher income poverty in the estates that tends to depress human 
development indicators, the quality of certain critical services, including health and education, is 
also usually poor in the estates compared with the rest of Sri Lanka.

21. 
Sri Lanka is on track to achieve most MDG targets, including reducing poverty by 
half, but now faces the challenges of achieving quality, relevance and sustainability in key 
public services (Table 2). Sri Lanka is poised to reach universal primary education enrollment, 
although there remain pockets of children of marginalized groups that either never attend or drop 
out of the schooling system (for example, street children, orphans, the disabled, and those 
displaced due to the conflict in the Northern and Eastern provinces). Sri Lanka’s impressive 
education indicators also mask serious deficiencies in the quality and efficiency of education. Sri 
Lanka has a strong track record in promoting gender equality and empowering women, reducing 
child mortality and improving maternal health—child and maternal mortality rates have been 
reduced to levels comparable with those of more developed countries and are the lowest among 
South Asian countries. At the same time, Sri Lankan women have yet some way to go in terms of 
gender parity in employment and wages. Women are also markedly under-represented in jobs 
with any degree of decision-making authority—even in job sectors where female workers are the 
vast majority, such as the garment industry and estate sector. In terms of combating HIV/AIDS 
and other diseases, Sri Lanka has performed relatively well with a low HIV/AIDS prevalence rate 
and high immunization rates. Finally, in terms of ensuring environmental sustainability, Sri 
Lanka is making strides towards increasing the coverage of sanitation and access to safe water, 
but there remains a large unfinished environmental agenda, including curbing soil erosion and 
strengthening solid waste management.

2. DEVELOPMENT CHALLENGES 

A. 

GOVERNMENT PRIORITIES—THE MAHINDA CHINTANA 

22. 
The Government’s 10-year Development Framework, Mahinda Chintana (MC)—
Vision for a New Sri Lanka, is built on President Rajapakse’s election manifesto. In 
November 2006, the Government presented a draft of the MC to the public, including donors who 
discussed it at the Development Forum in Galle in January 2007. As noted in the Joint Staff 
Advisory Note (JSAN), the draft has high Government ownership. It was prepared by the 
Ministry of Finance, in extensive discussion with sector ministries and provincial councils, 
although broader public consultation was more limited.   

23. 
The MC aims to accelerate growth from its historical average of about 5 percent to 
over 8 percent by the year 2010, and adequately identifies Sri Lanka’s main development 
challenges. The Government expects this growth to cut poverty by half to 12 percent over the 

3 The National Poverty Line has been used since the US$ 1 per day goal is unrealistic in the context of Sri 
Lanka. 

10

 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                 
next 10 years: “Sri Lanka needs a [higher] growth rate…to ensure that the economy is capable of 
providing better livelihood for all citizens, including those who are in abject poverty”. The MC 
places particular emphasis on the achievement of equitable growth, recognizing that there has 
been a “perpetuation of income disparities, both among income earners and geographic 
regions”. To achieve this ultimate goal, the MC has been built on previous efforts and provided a 
pragmatic approach. The MC focuses on three main areas: (i) accelerating growth through 
increased investment in infrastructure; (ii) achieving more equitable development through 
accelerated rural development; and (iii) strengthening public service delivery, in particular in 
health and education.  

24. 
As noted in the JSAN, a critical thrust of the Government’s strategy is to accelerate 
growth through increased investment in infrastructure. The Government takes the view that 
investment in infrastructure has been neglected for decades and has become a binding constraint 
to growth and poverty reduction in Sri Lanka. The Government’s strategy focuses, in particular, 
on large-scale projects in power, roads, ports, water supply, and sanitation. The total value of the 
envisaged investment program in ‘major’ infrastructure projects from 2006-2011 (the ‘Mahinda 
Randora’) amounts to almost US$1 billion annually, equivalent to about 3 percent of the GDP. 
The total capital investment budget is expected to amount to about 8 percent of GDP in the 
medium-term. As noted in the JSAN, the envisaged infrastructure program may be too optimistic 
in terms of the available resources. The JSAN also points to the need for improved coordination 
and clarification of roles and responsibilities in infrastructure provision. The fact that capital 
spending has fallen short of budgeted amounts in recent years may also point to constraints in the 
capacity of Government agencies to accelerate investments. More broadly, pursuit of this 
program may also add to existing bottlenecks in the labor market as unemployment is already at 
its lowest recorded level ever. 

25. 
Another key objective of the MC is to achieve more equitable development through 
accelerated rural development. To implement the Government’s rural development strategy, the 
Gama Neguma (‘Village Uplifting’) program has been launched. The objective of the Gama 
Neguma is to convert villages and towns into small centers of growth by promoting a holistic 
approach to infrastructure planning. As noted in the JSAN, to avoid duplication and ensure 
coordination, especially in service delivery mechanisms, the Gama Neguma will bring together a 
number of different programs and will seek to foster the people’s participation in planning and 
prioritization of projects. The proposed model reflects lessons learned through the Bank-
supported Gemi Diriya project. Complementary approaches may need to be devised by 
combining the implementation of village level rural livelihood interventions with small 
infrastructure and inter-village connectivity and rural infrastructure development. The MC 
emphasizes that increasing agricultural productivity is critical to raising rural incomes. It rightly 
places considerable importance on diversification to higher value products (for example, fruits, 
vegetables, livestock, and fisheries) for the domestic and export markets as a means of raising 
farm incomes and fostering growth. The MC also puts forward a strong role for the public sector 
in implementing the strategy. As noted in the JSAN, this includes areas where the private sector 
could potentially be more appropriate and efficient, including, for example, research and 
extension, where past public-driven interventions have had only mixed success.  

26. 
The MC emphasizes strengthening public service delivery, noting that the current 
quality and performance of services does not adequately meet modern development needs.  
As noted in the JSAN, the MC adequately identifies the challenges and achievements in key 
social services. In health, the Vision notes a number of outstanding challenges, including 
insufficient implementation of decentralization, the very high occupancy rate in some of the large 
hospitals, very low occupancy in more peripheral district hospitals, and the uncertain positioning 
of private providers. A key challenge for the Government would be to prioritize and 

11

 
operationalize an appropriate policy response to remedy these deficiencies. In education, the MC 
aims to promote equal access and improve the quality of basic and secondary education. In terms 
of social protection, the MC emphasizes the need to move from passive receipt of assistance to 
active participation in the economy. The MC explicitly notes the need to improve the targeting of 
the Samurdhi program, the largest cash transfer and social assistance program in the country:  
“The Samurdhi program is now in the reform process, with particular attention being given to 
the introduction of efficient entry and exit mechanisms”. 

27. 
The MC notes the need for developing the North and East which have suffered 
disproportionately from the conflict and lack of investments. The MC recognizes that the 
ongoing conflict has imposed a heavy economic cost on the North and East and that the poverty 
situation there is more serious than in other parts of the country. The Government’s framework 
for interventions in the North and East has three pillars: (i) reintegrating—including assisting 
with income generating activities—those displaced or affected by the conflict; (ii) resuming 
service delivery, including through investments in physical infrastructure; and (iii) strengthening 
the role of local governments/administrations. The Government has recently prepared a US$ 2 
billion Reconstruction Plan for the East. While the Plan is somewhat lacking in clear priorities 
and is not likely to be fully financed or implemented within its current three-year horizon, it 
distinctly points to the large needs of the Eastern Province. As noted in the JSAN, the 
Government’s strategy for the North and East is based on the assumption that the armed conflict 
will subside in the near future. 

28. 
The MC intends to facilitate private investments by continuing with the fairly 
liberal and open economic regime that Sri Lanka has had for the past 30 years. The export 
sector would continue to be supported through a conducive tax regime, a flexible exchange rate, 
market access via multilateral and bilateral trading arrangements, incentives for value addition by 
access to duty free inputs, and a liberal investment regime. The MC also states that the 
Government is committed to strengthening both product and factor markets—including land, 
labor and financial markets—to ensure the efficiency and competitiveness of the economy. 
Improvements in state-owned enterprises (SOEs) would be pursued through strategic reforms 
(privatization is explicitly ruled out) but, as noted in the JSAN, progress in structural reforms of 
SOEs has so far been limited. The MC is also vague about the Government’s policy stance in 
other areas. For example, the MC notes the importance of having a sound regulatory framework 
for public-private partnerships (PPPs), the need to modernize rigid labor laws and increased 
private sector participation in higher education, but is often ambiguous in its discussion of the 
policy measures that will be taken, how they will be implemented, and their relative importance. 

29. 
The Government has made several notable policy decisions during the last two 
years. The most decisive actions taken include moves to eliminate fuel subsidies, a 
comprehensive overhaul of electricity pricing with the objective of achieving full cost-recovery, 
and the long-awaited effort towards better targeting of the Samurdhi (welfare) program. Other 
notable accomplishments include strengthening the tax administration (including customs), 
establishing—with support from the Bank—a road maintenance fund, and some progress in land-
titling reform. The Government has also introduced a number of much-anticipated laws and 
regulations, such as the Companies Act (2007), Payment Devices Frauds Act, Finance Leasing 
Act, Prevention of Money Laundering Act, Financial Transaction Reporting Act (all in 2006), as 
well as Corporate Governance for Licensed Commercial Banks in Sri Lanka (2007). On the 
investment front, several large scale infrastructure investments, including for the Colombo port 
and power plant, have commenced after many years delay. In parallel, the Government has 
managed to break the deadlock on several large-scale infrastructure projects (for example, in the 
power sector) that were stalled for many years. 

12

 
B. MEDIUM TERM ECONOMIC OUTLOOK 

30. 
The MC sets out ambitious targets for medium-term economic growth. According to 
the MC’s associated macro-framework (MF), real GDP growth is projected to accelerate from its 
historical level of around 5 percent to over 8 percent from the year 2010 onwards4. Such growth 
would raise per capita GDP from US$ 1,610 in 2007 to around US$ 3,000 by 2012, equivalent to 
an almost two-fold increase of incomes in Sri Lanka in the coming five years. The main driver of 
growth is expected to be a sharp increase in both public and private investments which—in 
conjunction with the implementation of a number of structural policy measures—is assumed will 
lead to higher total factor productivity in the longer term. Underpinning this growth scenario is 
the assumption that the policy environment will be favorable and will include: (i) a conducive 
external environment, including an external trade policy aimed at securing markets for Sri Lankan 
products through preferential trade agreements; (ii) a reduction in inflation (measured by the GDP 
deflator) to 8.5 percent by 2010 through the implementation of a prudent monetary policy; (iii) a 
reduction in the fiscal deficit to 5 percent by 2010 by continued increases in tax collection, 
expenditure restraint and prudent debt management; and (iv) a reduction in the public debt to 
GDP ratio to 77 percent by 2010.   

31. 
The MF clearly recognizes the importance of global developments for Sri Lanka. In 
line with the most recent World Economic Outlook projections, the MF anticipates the global 
economy to grow by about 4 percent in the next few years. Emerging market economies in the 
South and East Asia regions are expected to grow well above the global average, while advanced 
economies are expected to avoid an outright recession brought on by the recent turbulence in 
international financial markets. Moreover, Sri Lanka expects to positively benefit from greater 
regional integration through expansion of multilateral, regional and bilateral trade arrangements, 
and a continuation of its open market economic polices. Against this background, exports are 
projected to grow (in US$-terms) at around 10-11 percent per annum to reach US$ 11.4 billion in 
the year 2011. Imports are expected to grow roughly at the same rate and the trade deficit is likely 
to hover around 9-10 percent of GDP through 2011.  

32. 
The downside risks from the external environment are considerable and recent 
deterioration in the external outlook could have significant negative effects on Sri Lanka.  
First, as noted in the MF, a slowdown in advanced economies could threaten Sri Lankan exports 
in particular. Moreover, as also noted in the MF, higher than expected oil prices (and other 
commodity prices) in international markets could threaten macroeconomic stability and growth 
targets and, in this respect, Sri Lanka’s weak fiscal and external position would not leave the 
Government with much room to maneuver and cushion the shocks. But there are several other 
risks. First, the important Sri Lankan garment industry will face renewed international 
competition in the US market when the quota on Chinese exports to the US expires in 2008. 
Second, Sri Lanka’s continued eligibility for participation in the EU’s GSP+ scheme (which is 
determined, inter alia, by the country’s adherence to minimum labor standards and its human 
rights record) that ensures duty free access to the EU for a large share of Sri Lanka’s exports, is 
also up for review in 2008. Third, the 25 percent appreciation in the real effective exchange rate 
that has taken place during the past four years would be expected to make a noticeable dent in 

4 In the original MF, accompanying the MC which was developed in late 2006, real GDP growth was 
expected to reach 8 percent in 2008 and 8.5 percent in 2010. In view of the lower than expected growth in 
2007, the updated MF provided by the Government for this JSAN, and published in the Central Bank’s 
2008 Annual Report, projects that growth will reach 8 percent only in 2010, that is, two years later than 
originally projected. It should also be noted that while the original MF in the MC was extrapolated to 2016, 
the updated MF is only extrapolated to 2011 (see Annex 4). 

13

 
 
                                                 
export competitiveness. Finally, as noted in the JSAN, the worsening security situation and the 
recent downgrading of Sri Lanka by international credit rating agencies, would also seem to pose 
additional risks for tourism receipts, FDI inflow and the Government’s access to international 
capital markets.  

33. 
The MF envisages a gradual reduction in inflation which has been a perennial 
source of macroeconomic instability in Sri Lanka. In a welcome attempt to strengthen 
predictability and credibility of monetary policy, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) in 2007 
adopted a Monetary Policy Roadmap (MPR) in which explicit targets for growth of reserve and 
broad money were set. In parallel, an improved internal monitoring mechanism was introduced 
by the CBSL in 2007, with a view to identifying deviations from the targets as early as possible 
and facilitating timely corrective action. For 2008, the CBSL has adopted a somewhat less 
ambitious end-year inflation target in the range of 10-11 percent. Also, as noted in the JSAN, 
sustainable reductions in inflation would require both decisive monetary policy action and 
considerable progress in fiscal consolidation to reduce demand-push factors of inflation.  

34. 
Fiscal consolidation 
is a key element 
in the MF’s objective to enhance 
macroeconomic stability. According to the MF, the budget deficit will be reduced to around 5 
percent of GDP by 2010. This would bring the deficit in line with the targets stipulated in the 
FMRA, albeit with a lag of six years. On the revenue side, total revenue-to-GDP is expected to 
increase by about 3 percentage points to 18.5 percent by 2010, mainly through further 
strengthening of the tax administration and continued expansions in the tax base (for example, by 
reducing tax privileges for companies registered under the Board of Investment scheme). On the 
expenditure side, consolidation is expected to take place entirely by keeping recurrent 
expenditures in check. In particular, improvements are expected to be achieved by phasing out 
budgetary transfers to SOEs. The Government has taken several commendable steps in this 
regard, in particular by allowing increases in domestic fuel prices and by raising electricity tariffs 
(albeit by using a highly progressive scale) with a view to eliminating the quasi-fiscal losses of 
the Ceylon Electricity Board. The MF also notes efforts to establish a ‘cost effective public 
expenditure management system’, with public expenditures being programmed within a medium-
term and sectoral budget framework to improve efficiency and productivity. Overall, recurrent 
expenditures are expected to be reduced to 16.0 percent of GDP by 2010, compared to 17.4 
percent of GDP in 2007. Such improvements on the revenue and recurrent expenditure side 
would make room for an increase in public investments from 6.1 percent of GDP in 2007 to 
almost 8 percent of GDP from 2008 onwards, while still achieving the desired deficit targets.   

35. 
The envisaged fiscal consolidation is necessary, but highly ambitious. On the revenue 
side, considerable progress has been achieved since the revenue-to-GDP ratio reached a low of 
14.9 percent in 2004. In 2007, the revenue-to-GDP ratio declined to 15.8 percent from 16.3 
percent in 2006. As emphasized in the JSAN, this raises serious concerns about the Government’s 
ability to achieve the sharp increase in revenues that is a key part of the envisaged fiscal 
consolidation. Increased revenue collection and strong tax reform measures, including further 
broadening of the VAT-base, would be required. However, recent changes in tax policy have 
instead mainly focused on increasing excise5 and imposing cesses on approximately 600 imported 
items. On the expenditure side, consolidation remains a challenge as over 60 percent of public 
expenditure is allocated to salaries, interest payments and defense. As noted in the JSAN, with 
respect to the Government’s intention of reducing losses of SOEs, the focus on pricing reforms, 
while welcome, has not been accompanied by similar strong efforts to improve operational 
efficiencies of SOEs. The Government has also recently created a number of new SOEs—for 

5 Largely covering ‘deemed’ non-essentials such as motor vehicles, tobacco and spirits. 

14

 
                                                 
example, a government-run import agency to keep consumer prices of ‘essential’ goods down, 
and a budget airline.  

36. 
The MF projects a continued reduction in the public debt-to-GDP ratio. However, 
in the medium-term, the public debt-to-GDP ratio remains a concern. Sri Lanka’s public 
debt reached 86 percent of GDP in 2007, a reduction from nearly 90 percent in 2006, mainly due 
to the faster growth in nominal GDP compared to debt stock. The share of foreign debt in total 
debt has remained relatively stable at around 44 percent, of which about 80 percent is 
concessional. In the past two years, there has been an increase in relatively short-term foreign 
commercial borrowings. Apart from the inherent risk of financing long-term projects with short-
term facilities, these borrowings have also led to a ‘bunching’ of repayments, particularly in 
2009, which could have negative BOP impacts considering that the reserve cover is not 
particularly large. In parallel, the average maturity of the domestic debt has been declining, which 
increases roll-over risks. Recently, however, exploiting the currently downward sloping yield 
curve, the Central Bank has taken steps to increase the average maturity of domestic debt. In the 
MF, it is assumed that to finance a higher public investment program the Government may need 
to mobilize around US$400 million annually from international capital markets, in addition to the 
expected concessional financing. The impact of such borrowing on Sri Lanka’s debt sustainability 
hinges critically on growth and the primary budget deficit, and on the terms that the Government 
is able to obtain for this borrowing. In this respect, it should be noted that incremental borrowings 
may easily come under stricter covenants and/or higher risk premiums.   

37. 
A key factor behind the MF’s projected acceleration in growth is a sharp increase in 
investments. The vision is to build modern, high quality and efficient infrastructure facilities to 
expand access to markets. Specific areas of emphasis include maintaining and rehabilitating the 
existing road network; constructing highways and expressways; increasing accessibility to safe 
drinking water; upgrading the railway sector; expanding the generation, transmission and 
distribution  of electricity, and; transforming the port and airport sectors to create an air-sea hub 
and logistics center. Consequently, total investments are assumed to increase from 27.9 percent of 
GDP in 2007 to 33.2 percent in 2011. The projected increase, it is mainly assumed, will result 
from a sharp increase in private investments from 20.7 of GDP to 27.0 percent of GDP between 
2007 and 2012. Higher public investments, it is expected, will contribute another almost 2 
percentage points, as public investments are assumed to reach about 8 percent of GDP compared 
to 6.1 percent of GDP in 2007.   

38. 
It may be difficult to realize the sharp increase in domestic savings required to 
finance the envisaged investment program. The MF assumes a significant increase in total 
domestic savings—from 17.6 percent of GDP in 2007 to 24.5 percent of GDP in 2011, equivalent 
to an increase of 6.9 percent of GDP—to provide the financing for the increase in investments. 
The public sector, it is assumed, will contribute about two-thirds of the increase in savings, with 
the private sector providing the balance. The projected increase in the public sector’s savings 
hinges critically on the Government’s ability to achieve fiscal consolidation which, as noted 
above, may be challenging in the current environment of rising commodity prices and the 
ongoing conflict.

3. LESSONS FROM THE LAST CAS AND PUBLIC 
CONSULTATIONS  

A. 

IMPLEMENTATION LESSONS 

39. 
The CAS Completion Report (CAS CR) emphasizes the significant change in the 
operational environment during the last CAS period. The proposed program in the 2003 CAS 
was highly relevant to Sri Lanka’s needs and well-aligned with the priorities of the Government 
at the time, focusing on Peace, Growth and Equity, with a Tsunami reconstruction pillar 
subsequently being added. However, as noted previously, the 2003 CAS was approved in a 
context that was significantly different from the one in which its implementation took place. Not 
only did actual developments on the peace front depart from initial expectations, but also 
unforeseeable events—in particular the December 2004 tsunami—combined with political 
developments to require adjustments in the shape and reach of the CAS’ original objectives and 
expected outcomes.  These adjustments, which were introduced within the context of the 2006 
CAS Progress Report (CAS PR), acknowledged the fact that: (i) the Poverty Reduction Strategy 
(PRS) that provided the CAS foundation was discarded by the new coalition Government; and (ii) 
prospects for rapid and deep reforms were curtailed. Consequently, the CAS PR introduced a 
significant shift in the structure of the Bank’s activities and a major prioritization and associated 
reduction (from 33 to 16) of key CAS outcomes.   

40. 
Overall, the CAS CR assesses the outcomes of the 2003 CAS as moderately 
satisfactory. The CAS CR concludes that 11 of the 16 revised outcomes were satisfactorily met. 
For two outcomes, the assessment is inconclusive due to lack of data, while achievement of three 
outcomes is assessed to be unsatisfactory. In terms of the Peace pillar—where Bank activities 
mainly focused on rehabilitation and reconstruction of infrastructure—outcomes were generally 
satisfactory. But the re-emergence of the armed conflict and the ensuing difficulties in project 
implementation have, to some extent, slowed progress and raised questions of sustainability of 
outcomes. It has also emphasized the need for the Bank to be adequately realistic and modest 
about its capacity and role in the area of peace building.  Progress on the Growth pillar outcomes 
was mixed, as more politically contentious policy changes (for example, reforms related to civil 
service, the labor market and SOEs) were unsuccessful, while less controversial reforms (for 
example, organizational changes in the Central Bank) were more successful. Projects under the 
Equity pillar (education, health and community-driven development projects) had several notable 
results on the ground, even if data on country-wide trends in equity does not point to a reduction 
in inequality during the CAS period. Finally, the Bank’s tsunami reconstruction efforts were 
generally successful. There remain, however, lingering concerns about the overall tsunami 
reconstruction effort (see Box 2). 

16

 
 
Box 2.  Lessons from Tsunami Reconstruction 

The devastating effects of the December 2004 tsunami in Sri Lanka and several other countries are well known. 
Overall, the agency responsible for Sri Lanka’s reconstruction efforts (TAFREN/RADA) suffered from a serious lack 
of capacity to handle the massive aid inflows and was ineffective in dealing with donors, including NGOs. This has 
created many problems, especially related to the donor-driven housing reconstruction program which was to resettle 
and construct houses for many of the affected families.  It also led to poor oversight of the reconstruction efforts, and 
some auditing irregularities.  In addition, there is the perception that reconstruction aid has been unequally directed and, 
in fact, significant geographical inequalities have materialized. Compounding these problems is the resumption of the 
conflict which means that access to the North and East has become increasingly difficult. As a result, the South and 
West have received more aid than the North and East. 

Despite this context that casts a cloud over Sri Lanka’s overall tsunami reconstruction efforts, the IDA-financed 
operations were relatively successful. Immediately after the tsunami, the IDA carried out a portfolio restructuring and 
reallocated US$ 75 million from other projects to the Tsunami Emergency Reconstruction Program I (TERP I). In 
February 2005, a new credit of US$ 75 million was approved for TERP II. The IDA is also administering US$ 25 
million from the International Federation of Red Cross (IFRC) which is being used for housing reconstruction. A 
significant share of the support (TERP I & II) was used to help restore livelihoods and rebuild houses (through a 
homeowner-driven model), with lesser amounts allocated for reconstruction in health and road infrastructure and costs 
associated with operations of key implementing agencies such as the Reconstruction and Development Agency 
(RADA). More than 100,000 families benefited from livelihood cash grants and about 23,500 partially damaged houses 
were fully repaired (97 percent), along with 15,600 fully-damaged houses (62 percent). The housing program is 
wrapping up in the South and West, but some areas of the North and East are expected to continue to experience a lack 
of or very slow progress due to the poor security situation. While 90 percent of the fully-damaged units in the South 
and West have been reconstructed, only 57 percent of the units in the North and East have been completed. The 
tsunami-damaged roads from Kalutara to Matara (114 km) were also rehabilitated. 

41. 
The Quality Assurance Group (QAG) reviewed the Analytic and Advisory Activities 
(AAA) program and concluded that, overall, it was moderately satisfactory. The QAG rated 
the AAA program satisfactory on strategic relevance (aligned with CAS priorities), internal 
quality (high-quality teams that in many cases worked closely with relevant counterpart teams), 
and on coherence and integration (consistent focus on key areas of public sector management, 
expenditure control and service delivery). The program was rated marginally satisfactory in its 
dimension of participation, consultation and dissemination. The QAG review notes that the 
overall level of the dialogue between the Government and the Bank on critical issues merits some 
strengthening, and that more aggressive dissemination of some of the basic findings of the AAA 
work would have been desirable. The QAG rated the AAA program’s likely impact moderately 
unsatisfactory. The review concluded that while the focus on public sector issues was appropriate 
and policy changes in this area would contribute significantly to the CAS objectives of growth 
and equity, changes in the political leadership and policy priorities did not prompt sufficient 
significant change in the areas covered in the AAA program. Part of the reason was the necessary 
and urgent response to the tsunami which consumed the full attention of the Bank and 
Government in the initial period of the new Government’s tenure and which, therefore, might 
have delayed the needed adjustment. The subsequent escalation in the armed conflict further 
compounded these difficulties. 

42. 
The IFC rapidly scaled up its program during the last CAS period. As of March 
2008, the IFC had invested in 12 companies in Sri Lanka with a total exposure of US$ 211 
million, all from IFC’s own account. The investments include projects in the information 
technology and financial services sectors. The IFC invested in Suntel, Dialogue and, more 
recently, Telekom Malaysia, to significantly expand the IT infrastructure. In the financial sector, 
IFC activities included investments in commercial banks and the country’s first credit rating 
agency and, more recently, extending IFC’s Global Trade Finance program to Sri Lanka. 
Portfolio performance has so far been good, with no loan arrears and strong unrealized capital 
gains. IFC’s advisory services program is too young yet to fully evaluate. However, early 

17

 
 
 
 
indications based on two completed projects (totaling $100,000 of spending) indicate that the 
program is making a positive contribution to the development of the financial services, ICT and 
tourism sectors. Increasingly, IFC is looking to integrate the investment side and advisory side of 
its activities and provide a combined package. In the Sri Lanka Country Office of the IFC, this is 
facilitated by, among other things, having one country manager oversee both investment and 
advisory work. The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) has also been active in 
Sri Lanka in the past, insuring projects in the finance and infrastructure sectors. Currently, MIGA 
has no outstanding guarantees in the country but will remain available to support the inflow of 
FDI into the country. 

B. 

 MESSAGES FROM PUBLIC CONSULTATIONS 

43. 
The Sri Lanka Client Survey conducted in the summer of 2007 shows that the Bank 
in Sri Lanka is more valued for its financial resources than for its knowledge services. The 
findings from the Sri Lanka Client Survey demonstrate a number of areas where the Bank has 
developed a strong and positive reputation and excellent working relationships. At the same time, 
the findings suggest a number of areas where the Bank should strengthen attention in order to 
improve its work and results. According to the Client Survey, the top development priorities of 
the country are economic growth and resolving the conflict. Poverty, Government effectiveness, 
and corruption are equally important. The Bank is perceived as doing well in several areas 
including, for example, infrastructure and education. The Bank received its lowest ratings in the 
areas of peace building efforts, transparency and governance. Of particular concern are the low 
ratings that the Bank received for work in safeguarding against corruption in its own projects and 
programs. Respondents rated the value of the Bank’s knowledge services quite low: while 43 
percent of respondents chose financial resources as the greatest value brought to the country by 
the Bank, only 11 percent identified knowledge as the top value. This raises questions about the 
quality, timeliness, emphasis, and dissemination of the Bank’s knowledge products in Sri Lanka. 

44. 
During the public consultations carried out for this CAS, high expectations were 
expressed for the Bank’s continued strong engagement in Sri Lanka. The public 
consultations gave insights from a wide spectrum of Sri Lankan society, both about what the 
Bank should be doing and how it should be operating6.   

• 

In terms of priority areas for the Bank’s engagement, the public consultation forums 
repeatedly emphasized the need to improve infrastructure to enhance connectivity to 
markets and facilitate private sector development. This was also seen as a critical element 
in fostering inclusive growth. Another area that was often emphasized was education, 
where many participants expressed strong concerns about poor quality and where it was 
also pointed out that strengthened language teaching could be a very important instrument 
in ethnic reconciliation. There was also a strong request for the Bank to continue its 
engagement in local and community development to improve living conditions in villages 
and rural areas. In addition, there were very strong demands from the people in the conflict-
affected areas for Bank involvement in reconstruction and development. At the same time, 
participants cautioned that the Bank should be vigilant that its assistance does not fuel the 
conflict or become determined by political consideration; it should, instead, reach the 
neediest people. Many participants expressed concerns and frustration about the 
deterioration in governance but also questioned the extent to which the Bank would be able 
to make a difference in this area. Finally, the consultations showed a desire to see stronger 
engagement by the Bank in several areas where Bank involvement has been limited in 

6 The public consultations are summarized in Annex 1. 

18

 
                                                 
recent years. Examples of such areas include the estates sector, gender issues, problems of 
urban poverty, and adaptation to climate change—some of which the Bank should consider 
enhanced engagement in during CAS implementation.    

• 

In terms of the Bank’s modus operandi in Sri Lanka, participants in the public consultations 
had several useful observations. First, participants clearly recognized the limitations of the 
Bank’s ‘leverage’ to bring about dramatic changes in the situation on the ground, both on 
account of the modest and declining share of Bank financing in total public sector financing 
and on account of the complex domestic political situation. Against this background, 
participants encouraged the Bank to further prioritize dissemination of information and 
stimulation of public debate on broad policy issues (for example, macroeconomic 
management, investment climate, climate change, energy sector reform, and governance). 
Second, there was a strong request for the Bank to engage more thoroughly at the 
grassroots and local levels—including with communities, NGOs, the private sector, and 
local governments that would like to be more involved in the planning and execution of 
development interventions at the local level. Finally, participants urged the Bank to further 
emphasize the M&E of not only its own programs but also support Government agencies in 
strengthening M&E as a way of increasing transparency and accountability in public 
spending.  

45. 
The experiences from implementing the last CAS and the inputs from the public 
consultations point to several lessons going forward. First, in view of the volatile conflict 
situation, there is a need to both adapt and also exploit openings for policy changes if and when 
they appear. Second, it is critical to ensure Government ownership and continued political 
commitment for successful implementation of policy changes. This requires careful reading of the 
often complex political landscape. It also requires a willingness to accept that it may not be 
feasible to pursue ‘grand reforms’ but more productive to pursue incremental improvements 
whenever possible. This implies that there is a need for continued consultations to build 
constituencies for policy and institutional changes. Finally, despite the fact that the Bank’s 
knowledge services are not rated well in the Client Survey, there are still strong expectations that 
the Bank will provide knowledge and facilitate dialogue in many areas. It is critical that the Bank 
capitalize on these demands to disseminate knowledge, in a timely manner, to wider audiences 
beyond the immediate counterparts of the Government.  

4. BANK GROUP ASSISTANCE STRATEGY 

A. 

SUPPORTING GROWTH AND POVERTY REDUCTION 

Strategic Objective 1 — Expanding Economic Opportunities in Lagging Regions 

46. 
The Bank will assist the Government’s strategic goal of enhancing rural economic 
growth with a view to achieving more regionally balanced development. Several factors have 
led to relatively low growth in the largely rural areas outside the Western Province. First, growth 
in these areas has been hindered by poor market access because of poor infrastructure—in the 
joint ADB/World Bank Investment Climate Assessment (ICA) rural business-owners reported 

19

 
 
transport as the most important constraint to growth of their businesses. This, coupled with poor 
access to finance, has impeded the transition from agriculture to non-farm economic activities in 
rural areas. Agro-business and other rural enterprises have been slow to take off, despite the 
emergence of some out-grower schemes established by Sri Lankan supermarket chains. At the 
same time, agricultural growth has been sluggish for years—agriculture GDP has only grown by 
about 2 percent per annum during the last five years. Agriculture development has been hampered 
by a skewed policy framework which shows a high reliance on subsidies and fosters restrictive 
land policies. Increasing water scarcity and human/wildlife conflicts are further barriers to 
agricultural growth, as is inadequate diffusion of technology and knowledge. The conflict-
affected areas in the North and East face particular challenges to achieving sustainable growth 
because of a serious infrastructure backlog, comparatively low levels of human development, and 
recurring displacement of large numbers of citizens in these areas.  

47. 
Supporting integrated rural development (CAS outcome 1.1). The recent worldwide 
increase in food prices and its likely persistence in the medium-term is creating a new 
environment for the agriculture sector. The rising cost of food is a significant burden on net food 
buyers (mostly urban consumers). At the same time, the farming community will benefit from 
higher farm prices which would eventually trigger the required supply response that will mitigate 
the pressure on prices. This is the right time for improving the efficiency of agriculture supply 
chains and marketing channels, and promoting partnerships with a private sector that is 
increasingly attracted by the agriculture sector and is searching for new business models. 
Moreover, the expansion of programs that aim at rural livelihood development will foster village 
institutions and farmers organizations that will generate the required scale to reduce transaction 
costs, facilitate better access to markets, and interaction with private players. In parallel, poverty 
reduction will also critically depend on the rate at which the rural off-farm sector can absorb 
workers from the growing rural labor force. Off-farm employment makes up about two-thirds of 
all employment in rural areas. Among rural households that own and operate off-farm enterprises, 
the poverty rate is 13 percent compared with 23 percent for households without income from off-
farm enterprises. Limited employment expansion in the agricultural sector means that poverty 
reduction will critically depend on the rate at which the rural off-farm sector can absorb workers.  
Growth of rural enterprises is limited by weak market connectivity and poor access to other 
infrastructure (for example, electricity). To address these challenges, the Bank intends to align its 
engagement with the Maga Neguma and Gama Neguma programs to support access to 
infrastructure and services in rural areas. In addition to our ongoing interventions supporting rural 
electrification and community water supply, areas of focus would include community-driven 
livelihood improvements, improving inter-connectivity through integrated rural infrastructure 
development, improving the existing road network, and enhancing the reliability of electricity 
provision by improving transmission and distribution. The Bank also supports access to micro-
finance through village-based credit schemes established under Bank-funded community driven 
development programs, including Gemi Diriya and the Community Livelihood in Conflict 
Affected Areas Project. In parallel, recognizing the importance of raising agricultural productivity 
and agricultural diversification to higher value crops for reducing rural poverty and for enhancing 
food security in the context of high global food prices, the Bank would support PPPs for 
agricultural competitiveness, strengthening agricultural research and extension, improving water 
resource management, investing in irrigation and dam safety, and reducing competing demands 
for scarce resources between humans and elephants. Finally, building on the recommendations of 
the recently completed Poverty Assessment and the Tea and Rubber sector studies, and the 
experiences from projects like the Bank-financed Community Water Project, the Bank would 
work with stakeholders to address the increase in poverty within the estates sector.   

48. 
Improve economic opportunities in the North and East (CAS outcome 1.2). More 
than two decades of conflict have had far reaching economic and social repercussions for the 

20

 
people of the North and East. The conflict-affected regions lag behind the rest of the country in 
availability of economic infrastructure, access to markets and financial services, and key human 
development outcomes. Only 46 percent of the population of the North and East has access to 
safe drinking water, compared with 62 percent for the rest of the country. Less than one-half of 
the households in the region have access to water-sealed toilets. The 2002 ceasefire agreement 
and subsequent cessation of hostilities spurred economic recovery in the North and East. Real 
GDP growth in the North increased four-fold to about 13 percent while that of the East doubled to 
10 percent from the pre-ceasefire to post-ceasefire years as security-related mobility restrictions 
were lifted, fishing restrictions relaxed, investments increased, and people’s confidence in the 
future improved. Sustainable growth in the North and East will ultimately depend on whether 
durable peace is achieved. But the serious backlog in infrastructure, community and social 
services, as well as employment opportunities, 
including access 
to quality 
roads, 
telecommunications, and water and electricity would also have to be addressed. Mindful of the 
difficult and sensitive operating environment in the North and East, the Bank intends to remain 
substantially engaged in this part of the country to help people and communities rebuild their 
lives, by supporting housing and village rehabilitation and construction, psycho-social services 
for traumatized individuals, and inter-village connecting infrastructure—including rehabilitation 
of provincial roads.  

49. 
The IFC will contribute to this outcome. The IFC will pursue investment opportunities 
which have a broad reach and benefit across the country, for example, by looking to support 
companies which source from and sell to the Northern and Eastern Provinces. The IFC will also 
consider stand-alone investment opportunities in conflict-affected areas where risk can 
appropriately be mitigated, for example, through the use of guarantees. IFC advisory services will 
seek to support the tourism and ICT sectors outside of the Western Province which have been the 
focus of private sector growth in recent years. MIGA guarantees are available as well. 

Strategic Objective — Improving the Investment Climate and Competitiveness 

50. 
Higher investments and higher productivity are required to accelerate economic 
growth in Sri Lanka. With an average investment-to-GDP ratio of 26.2 percent in the past 5 
years (of which the private sector contributed 22.4 percent), investment levels in Sri Lanka are 
lower than the South Asia average and well short of the levels of a number of fast-growing East 
Asian economies. The Government is targeting an increase in the investment-to-GDP ratio of 
about 5 percentage points by 2010, to bring it into line with the level of other lower-middle 
income countries. It plans to do so by prioritizing infrastructure investments at the national level 
(through the Randora program) and at district and local authorities level (through the Maga 
Neguma program). In parallel, impediments to private investments remain. The 2005 joint 
ADB/World Bank Investment Climate Assessment (ICA) concluded that the top-five constraints 
to private businesses7 were: (i) policy uncertainty, in particular on account of the conflict; (ii) 
macroeconomic instability; (iii) cost of finance; (iv) poor infrastructure, including unreliable and 
expensive electricity supply; and (v) a rigid labor market. Sri Lanka also faces challenges in terms 
of moving towards an economy increasingly based on knowledge. Research and development 
spending is low, as is FDI and its associated knowledge transfer. The ICT sector needs to be 
further developed even though much progress was made after the telecom sector was opened up 
for competition in the mid-1990s. Against this background, the Bank would support 
improvements in the investment climate and competitiveness by seeking to achieve the following 
outcomes: 

7 These were the constraints identified by firms in urban areas where the vast majority of firms are located. 

21

 
 
                                                 
51. 
Improving 
infrastructure provision (CAS outcome 2.1). In support of 
the 
Government’s effort to reduce the country’s infrastructure deficit, the Bank will scale up its 
support for the roads sector at both the national and provincial levels. There are several reasons 
why the Bank would focus its infrastructure assistance in the roads sector. First, inadequate road 
infrastructure is a critical constraint for sustainable and inclusive growth in Sri Lanka as 
highlighted, for example, in the Bank’s Poverty Assessment which pointed to a robust linkage 
between poverty reduction and accessibility measured by travel time to markets. This was also 
echoed during the CAS consultations where participants repeatedly emphasized the need for 
better roads and access to markets and jobs to spur regional development. Improvements in the 
road network would also complement other Bank activities aimed at strengthening rural 
development and networking between rural entrepreneurs and the private sector in cities–for 
example, the proposed Integrated Community Development/Gama Neguma project and the 
Community Livelihood in Conflict Affected Areas (CLCA) project. To further increase the 
returns on these investments, other improvements in the policy environment (for example, in 
agricultural policy and land policy) should also be pursued by the Government. Second, the 
Bank’s strengthened engagement in the roads sector would complement other donors’ activities in 
other infrastructure sectors (for example, Japan and China in power, ADB and Japan in water 
supply, and China and ADB in ports). Finally, the envisaged focus on the provincial councils as 
key stakeholders in part of the roads sector assistance program also offers an opportunity to 
provide much-needed strengthening to the devolved entities in Sri Lanka. Donor coordination in 
the roads sector is excellent through the Transport Forum which was established jointly by the 
three main donors in the sector (ADB, Japan and the Bank) and the Government. As agreed by 
the Transport Forum, ADB has taken the lead in supporting the development of the Road Sector 
Master Plan which, originally, was developed in 2005 but was recently updated. Japan has taken 
the lead in supporting the development of a competitive and capable road construction sector, 
while the Bank has focused on strengthening the institutional framework for road maintenance 
through the establishment of a Road Maintenance Fund. The Bank’s engagement would be 
further guided by an infrastructure assessment that the Bank would conduct in collaboration with 
the Government, with a view to establishing a holistic overview of infrastructure provision across 
sectors and locations. This would include areas where the Bank has so far not engaged strongly—
for example, urban development, with a view to assess the livability and competitiveness of the 
Colombo metropolitan area which is of critical importance for Sri Lanka to solidify its middle 
income country status. The IFC, through its recently established South Asia Infrastructure 
Facility, can provide infrastructure advisory assistance to the Government (on a fee basis) for 
developing bankable projects, largely utilizing the PPP model. The IFC will also look for 
opportunities to enhance the provision of infrastructure through direct investments.  

52. 
Improving the business environment for stronger entrepreneurship and a 
knowledge-based economy (CAS outcome 2.2). Sri Lanka ranks poorly on a number of Doing 
Business indicators (for example, 22 procedures and 214 days are needed to receive the necessary 
licenses and permits to start a business). Such constraints, as also recognized by the Government, 
impede the growth of private business to the detriment of job creation. Also, vibrant small- and 
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which are critical for growth and job creation, often lack 
sufficient capacity for business development, have poor vertical and horizontal linkages, and 
limited access to finance. Moreover, as pointed out in the Bank’s recent Knowledge Economy 
Report, Sri Lanka faces considerable challenges in terms of improving ICT, research and 
development, and the quality of education to make a decisive move towards becoming a 
knowledge-based economy. The Bank would also support improvements in the business 
environment for the tourism sector, including exploring efforts for joint initiatives with the IFC. 

53. 
The IFC would play a key role in strengthening the business environment, including 
in the ICT sector, and improving opportunities for SMEs. First, through equity investments 

22

 
and associated advisory work with six commercial banks, the IFC has made a concerted effort to 
improve access to finance for SMEs. In 2007, these six banks provided 40 percent of all 
commercial bank lending to SMEs. The IFC’s investments are underpinned by a Banking Survey 
of the SME market in Sri Lanka, completed in 2006 and accompanied by capacity building and 
training through the IFC’s SEDF (South Asia Enterprise Development Facility) which focuses on 
helping banks develop SME lending strategies; process re-engineering; improve automation, 
design and implementation of credit risk management tools; create or strengthen SME lending 
departments; and introduce new financial products. Second, by providing patient equity capital 
and associated advisory services in the areas of corporate governance, risk management and SME 
financing, IFC will continue to play an important role and add to efforts in helping develop the 
financial sector. Third, through its ‘Business Enabling Environment’ work, IFC will seek to 
address policy and regulatory constraints to SME development, with a focus on selected 
municipalities in order to improve impact. Fourth, IFC’s Value Addition to Firms Advisory 
Program supports the growth of export-oriented manufacturing and service companies, including 
knowledge-based companies, by: (i) facilitating linkages between large and small enterprises; (ii) 
capacity-building for support services providers (for example, training organizations and 
associations); and (iii) providing information services (for example, e-based services and trade 
fairs). Finally, IFC would support the further development of the ICT sector through equity 
investment in several ICT companies. MIGA guarantees are available for the SME sector too. 
MIGA has also introduced a streamlined product, the Small Investment Program (SIP), 
specifically targeted to small-scale investments. At the policy-level, the Bank would pursue 
financial sector improvements through AAA and policy dialogue, based inter alia on the 
recommendations of the Financial Sector Assessment Programs or FSAPs (jointly with the IMF). 
The Bank would also support the knowledge economy in Sri Lanka by providing technical 
assistance to the Tele-Regulator and through the on-going E-Sri Lanka project. The Bank liaises 
closely with several donors in this area, including USAID (which has just completed its large 5-
year ‘Competitiveness Program’), the Netherlands and the EU. 

54. 
Improving the strategic relevance and transparency of public spending (CAS 
outcome 2.3). Reducing the high fiscal deficit and arresting inflation are the most critical factors 
for macroeconomic stability and growth. Containing the fiscal deficit will require improved 
selectivity and prioritization in public spending, in conjunction with continued progress in 
revenue mobilization. In the likely absence of development policy lending (see para 71), the 
Bank’s assistance will be focused on technical assistance and economic and sector work (ESW) 
in selected areas. Priority areas include enhancing the effectiveness of public spending on 
infrastructure—based on recommendations from the Infrastructure PER (Public Expenditure 
Review), enhancing the strategic relevance of public expenditures through technical assistance to 
the Medium Term Expenditure Framework, and exploring ways to improve the financial 
sustainability and efficiency of SOEs. Moreover, the envisaged Bank support for the Auditor 
General’s Office and the selected parliamentary oversight committees would help to strengthen 
accountability in public spending. In addition, strengthening the capacity of the Department of 
Census and Statistics (DCS) will improve the evidence base for policy planning, ensuring that Sri 
Lanka’s national policies are based on more accurate and timely statistical information and 
analyses. Led by the World Bank Institute (WBI), the Bank is also working to enhance the 
capacity for budgeting and planning at the provincial council level. Finally, the Government 
envisages that a part of its planned public infrastructure will be financed through PPPs. However, 
considerable work remains to be done for establishing an adequate policy framework to facilitate 
PPPs in terms of design, appraisal and selection of potential projects. The Bank stands ready to 
provide technical expertise and advice to the Government to support its efforts to strengthen the 
PPP framework. Other partners in this area include the ADB which is providing technical 
assistance to the Revenue Department to further improve the effectiveness of revenue collection, 

23

 
and the IMF which is providing technical assistance on select tax policy issues—particularly on 
broadening the VAT base.   

Strategic Objective 3 — Enhancing Quality Services and Accountability 

55. 
Sri Lanka has achieved impressive results in providing access to services for its 
population but concerns about quality and relevance are mounting. Many social indicators in 
Sri Lanka are at impressive levels:  a net primary school (grade 5) enrolment rate of 97 percent, 
life expectancy of 74 years, and an infant mortality rate of 13 per 100,000 live births are all 
comparatively high indicators for a country with a per capita income of US$ 1,600. Despite these 
achievements, however, delivery of basic public services faces a number of challenges that have 
their roots in emerging economic, social and demographic changes. Economic changes (higher 
incomes, increasing need for adaptability, and increased international competition) are resulting 
in a growing premium on quality and relevance in service delivery, in addition to efficiency 
considerations. For example, in basic education, not only is the completion rate (grades 1-9) only 
78 percent, but the quality of education is inadequate, with a mere one-third of primary school 
children achieving mastery in language and mathematics skills. In parallel, Sri Lanka has one of 
the fastest aging populations in the world. Population aging is significantly changing the demands 
on the health sector where the rising prevalence of non-communicable diseases (for example, 
diabetes) and an inefficient hospital network result in a high disease burden. Similarly, affordable 
and adequate social security for the aged will eventually become a critical need.   

56. 
Improved quality, relevance and governance of education (CAS outcome 3.1).  
Enhancing quality and relevance of education at all levels is a central challenge as current 
achievement levels are modest. Among primary school children, only 69 percent score above 50 
percent in first language (Sinhalese or Tamil) tests, and only 67 percent of children achieve scores 
above 50 percent in mathematics. In addition, policy makers are seeking to ensure that 85-90 
percent of children complete grade 9 over the medium-term (against less than 80 percent today), 
especially children in poor and disadvantaged regions, children with special learning needs, and 
children from conflict-affected areas. Finally, the governance of the basic and secondary 
education system can be strengthened by: (i) decentralizing education service delivery through 
the provincial councils; (ii) improving school-community partnerships through school-based 
management; and (iii) strengthening M&E, and research and policy analysis. The Bank intends to 
support efforts to strengthen transparency and accountability in the education sector by 
strengthening internal audit systems and enhancing parents’ voice in school management. The 
Bank has a long-standing and strong relationship with the Government in the education sector and 
is supporting its education program through a programmatic education sector development 
operation. The Bank is also promoting education research and evaluation, including regular 
National Assessments of Learning Outcomes, surveys on school enrollment and attendance, an 
annual school census, and evaluations of important initiatives such as school-based management. 
These studies are used to measure the performance of the Government’s current education sector 
development plan.   

57. 
In higher education—where Sri Lanka was at one point the shining star of the 
South Asia region—the country has not kept up with its reputation. Quality, even in 
universities with strict student admission criteria, is at low levels. Not a single Sri Lankan higher 
education institution is ranked among the top 500 institutions in major international league tables. 
Student assessments show quality levels to be low and employers’ assessments of graduates’ 
cognitive and attitudinal skills are also largely negative.  Moreover, both the relevance of existing 
study programs and employability of graduates are low—a relatively small number of students 
are enrolled in nationally defined priority programs and many graduates are idle for a long time 
between graduation and their first jobs. The Bank is currently, along with the authorities, 

24

 
undertaking a detailed assessment of the higher education system in Sri Lanka and intends to 
implement its recommendations through the envisaged Higher Education Project.   

58. 
Improved health and social protection services (CAS outcome 3.2). The health and 
social protection sectors in Sri Lanka are at a challenging turning point, given the ongoing 
demographic transition: 

(cid:190) In the health sector, the growing burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs)—such 
as chronic diseases, injuries, and mental illnesses—is now common and an increasing 
cause of morbidity. For example, about 14 percent of adults in Sri Lanka have diabetes.  
In 2001, NCDs accounted for 71 percent of all deaths in Sri Lanka. Going forward, as 
pointed out in the Bank’s recent Aging Report, the incidence of NCDs is likely to 
increase even more rapidly. Also, Sri Lanka continues to suffer from widespread 
malnutrition among children: data suggests that approximately one-fifth of all under-5 
children suffer from malnutrition and about 14 percent may be stunted. Malnutrition in 
children affects them for life, impacting their future economic potential. Third, there are 
significant unmet needs in the conflict-affected areas and among marginalized population 
groups. In addition to its ongoing lending operation (Health Sector Development), the 
Bank plans an expansion of AAA activities in the areas of NCDs, health financing and 
health system reform. The Bank also intends to review, together with the Government, 
the hospital delivery system, and help the Government prepare a strategy to further 
develop the hospital sector over the next decade. To improve accountability, relevance 
and responsiveness in health services, the Bank is supporting strengthened stakeholder 
participation in the formulation of health policy.   

(cid:190) In social protection, Sri Lanka has a fairly comprehensive social protection system but it 
is neither financially sustainable nor well-targeted. Also, the coverage of social services 
(for example, community-based rehabilitation services for the disabled and elderly, 
protection for vulnerable children, etc.) and employment services (for example, cost-
effective job search and placement services) is low. The weaknesses of Sri Lanka’s social 
protection system are particularly noticeable in conflict-affected areas and during the 
times of natural disasters. The Bank intends to support the social protection agenda 
through a variety of ESWs and TAs—including on administration; targeting; M&E of 
social safety nets to improve social service delivery; and a referral system for vulnerable 
children, the disabled and elderly poor. The Bank would also provide TAs to the 
ministries of Social Welfare, Resettlement, and Nation Building to enhance institutional 
capacity for effective delivery of cash transfers in post-disaster situations in Sri Lanka. 

59. 
Strengthening environmental protection (CAS outcome 3.3). Sri Lanka suffers from 
environmental degradation on several fronts, including land degradation due to soil erosion, 
pollution from unsafe solid waste disposal, pollution of inland waters, depletion of coastal 
resources, loss of biodiversity, and deforestation. The emphasis in the Mahinda Chintana on 
large-scale infrastructure and the proposed enhanced reliance on fossil fuels make it even more 
critical that environmental management become an integral part of the development planning 
process to avoid significant environmental degradation. In this respect, the Bank will work with 
the Ministry of Power and Energy and the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources to 
assess the environmental consequences of coal power generation, with a view to developing 
strategies for mitigation of adverse environmental impacts. It will also work on helping prepare a 
regulatory framework for environmental management for the power sector. Sri Lanka’s 
regulatory framework for environmental management is reasonably good and the Government 
has been quite effective in identifying environmental issues and developing policies and strategies 
to mitigate these. But implementation and enforcement remain weak. The Bank intends to support 

25

 
 
the Government’s effort to strengthen implementation of enforcement through a combination of 
AAAs and lending, by identifying and remedying key bottlenecks to effective enforcement of 
environmental safeguards, including lack of capacity in key agencies, overlapping mandates 
among competing agencies, and distorted incentives. The Bank’s support in this area would also 
help define the Government’s response to the impact of climate change. Finally, the Bank would 
seek to facilitate the development of the ecotourism industry in ways that contribute to poverty 
alleviation and conservation, restoring critically damaged ecosystems and ensuring sustainability 
in the development process. The Bank’s engagement in this area would complement activities 
already undertaken by the ADB and the Netherlands. In addition, the IFC and MIGA will 
continue to ensure that all current and future investment clients meet their environmental 
performance standards. IFC’s advisory services will work with Sri Lankan SMEs on upgrading 
environment protection.  

B. 

ADDRESSING THE CAUSES AND CONSEQUENCES OF CONFLICT 

60. 
This CAS recognizes that the decades-old armed conflict is an important stumbling 
block to long-term development and poverty alleviation in Sri Lanka. The conflict is highly 
complex and has deep historical roots. It has no single cause but involves multiple issues such as 
ethnicity (including language), education, and access to economic opportunities—including to 
land and employment. In the words of a prominent Sri Lankan researcher, the conflict “has 
blighted [Sri Lanka’s] political, social and cultural traditions and has become the biggest obstacle 
to the country achieving its full development potential”8. This is not to say that the conflict is 
solely responsible for all poverty in Sri Lanka—as noted in para 7, Sri Lanka has been able to 
sustain a 5 percent real GDP growth during the past 25 years of armed conflict. Nevertheless, it is 
clear that the conflict has had a particularly adverse impact on, for example: (i) investments, 
especially foreign investments which have not seriously taken off in Sri Lanka despite its open 
economy (although FDI inflows have increased somewhat recently); (ii) tourism—tourist arrivals 
have not increased significantly compared to 1982 despite a six-fold increase in tourist arrivals in 
East Asia and the Pacific during the same period; (iii) public finances, in particular due to 
increases in defense expenditures—since 1982 there has been a sharp increase in the share of 
defense spending (from about 3 percent in 1982 to 20 percent in 2006) compared to total public 
spending, even if defense spending at an estimated 3.5 percent of GDP in 2007 remains moderate 
by international comparisons; (iv) brain drain—where the conflict, undoubtedly, has been a 
‘push’ factor in many Sri Lankans’ decisions to migrate, although ‘pull factors’ such as the ability 
to earn higher salaries abroad have also played an important role. 

61. 
The Northern and Eastern provinces have been most severely affected by fighting 
and displacements. For the last 25 years, the North and East have experienced recurring 
interruptions in regular economic activity. It is estimated that up to 2003, around 326,700 houses 
had been partly or totally damaged by the conflict—half of them in the Jaffna and Batticaloa 
districts alone. Infrastructure was greatly debilitated with only 10-15 percent of the road surfaces 
intact. As of September 2007, 504,000 persons were internally displaced in Sri Lanka and 
131,160 persons were registered as refugees in neighboring India and other countries. Among the 
152,000 who were subsequently able to resettle (mostly in the Eastern Province), many faced 
difficult livelihood situations on their return as belongings and working tools had been looted, 
areas had not been mine-cleared, and access to fields and fishing waters was restricted for 
security purposes. Compared to other provinces, health indicators for the North and East point to 
a higher prevalence of underweight children at birth (25.7 percent compared to 18.0 percent for 
the rest of Sri Lanka), maternal malnutrition, and diarrhea. Educational attainment by primary 
school children in the North and East is also the lowest among Sri Lanka’s regions, with a 

8 Saman Kelegama (2006), “Development Under Stress—Sri Lankan Economy in Transition”.   

26

 
                                                 
mastery of the mother tongue ratio of 23 percent, compared to the 37 percent national average. 
The conflict has also impacted gender relations. In the conflict-affected areas there is a high 
proportion of female-headed households—decades of armed conflict have created a large pool of 
widows who are solely responsible for supporting their families yet have few options to earn 
incomes. By 2005, nearly one-fifth (19.7 percent) of households in the North and East were 
headed by females.   

62. 
Against this background, the Bank will emphasize efforts to improve access to 
public services and enhance livelihood opportunities in conflict-affected areas. As mentioned 
above, based on its previous experience (see Box 3), the Bank aims to improve opportunities in 
the North and East and has identified an integrated rural infrastructure and livelihood project as 
one of the key interventions. Besides this area-based project, the Bank also aims to address 
specific needs for service delivery in the conflict-affected areas through other projects. From the 
service delivery point of view, a critical issue is resource constraints in health and education. 
School buildings have been damaged or used as temporary welfare centers for the internally 
displaced, and health clinics are damaged or inadequately maintained. In response to these needs, 
the Bank would assist with rehabilitation and reconstruction of schools and health care facilities. 
The Bank would also support the reduction of vacancies for teachers and medical personnel in the 
North and East. Moreover, for people suffering from the consequences of conflict in the form of 
damage to their lives, property and income generation opportunities, the Bank would assist in 
improving livelihoods and re-building the lives of conflict-affected people. This would be done 
through support for housing, rehabilitation of inter-village roads and community infrastructure, 
and improvements to the business environment. The Bank would also support reduction in youth 
unemployment and assist in the introduction of trauma counseling programs at the village level. It 
would assess the impact of the conflict on women. Outside the main conflict zones, the Bank 
would cater to the housing needs of the long-term displaced and their host communities.  

63. 
In addition, the Bank would—through the design and implementation of its 
projects—seek to enhance inter-ethnic awareness. In this CAS, the Bank would strive to 
enhance inter-ethnic awareness by expanding meeting surfaces between people belonging to 
different communities. This would be done, for example, by encouraging Tamil- and Sinhalese-
speaking students to learn each others’ languages, by supporting education in English which 
serves as a link language, by working towards mixed Tamil-Sinhala schooling and teachers’ 
education, and by encouraging members of different ethnic groups to work together around 
common goals in community-driven development. Issues of land contestation on ethnic grounds 
would be addressed in the context of the Bank’s housing operations through a land dispute 
settlement mechanism. Moreover, the Bank would—through its ongoing activities financed by 
the Post Conflict Fund—support Sri Lankan civil society organizations in their promotion of 
dialogue on conflict-related issues across religious groups, in establishing community peace 
councils, and in enhancing the capacity of local organizations to deal with communal conflicts. 

27

 
Box 3.  Examples of How Existing Projects Address Causes and Consequences of Conflict  

The Bank’s Education Sector Development Program (ESDP) addresses some of the causes of conflict by 
reviewing textbooks to eliminate ethnic or religious bias, promoting mixed language schools and mixed teacher-
training, and supporting English as a link language between different ethnic groups. Moreover, to ensure equality in the 
provision of education service delivery, the Bank focuses on strengthening education quality in the conflict-affected 
areas. This is done, for instance, through special education and non-formal education programs for conflict-affected 
children and through human resource development of education managers and school principals. Upcoming 
components of the Bank’s education activities are expected to incorporate, for instance, curriculum issues.  

The Bank’s community driven development (CDD) initiatives help foster reconciliation and awareness. The 
Community Livelihood in Conflict Affected Areas Project targets conflict-affected communities that have settled or re-
settled in their original villages in the North and East. Outstanding issues under dispute have to be settled by the 
community members before the projects can start. The Bank’s Gemi Diriya project also encourages specific 
reconciliation-enhancing sub-projects, in particular those focusing on strengthening inter-ethnic relations and the youth. 
The project aims at empowering youth and providing them an alternative to joining the army or militant groups. This is 
done, for instance, by equipping youth with tools to participate in, and benefit from, project activities in the field of 
income generation. Other sub-project examples are counseling programs and art therapy activities to address war 
trauma. Gemi Diriya has also adopted a conflict sensitive approach in project management and administration. 
Appropriate language skills and inter-cultural awareness among project resource persons have not only strengthened 
trust but also enhanced the efficiency of project supervision. 

The Bank’s different housing projects also address several significant causes and consequences of conflict. The North 
East Housing Reconstruction Project (NEHRP) has helped address one frequently cited cause of contention: land. 
Conflict-induced population displacement and encroachments on the property of the displaced by people of different 
ethnic groups have given rise to land-related disputes. In order to regularize land titles and to resolve land disputes, the 
NEHRP set up eight mobile land task forces, one for each district of the Northern and the Eastern provinces. Between 
March 2005 and April 2006, the mobile land task forces registered 96,385 land disputes. The task force investigated 
73,475 cases of disputed/unclear land titles and resolved 52,721 of them. The NEHRP also provides for the training of 
masons and carpenters involved in the reconstruction of houses; this has created livelihood opportunities and helped 
reduce unemployment which, like in the Gemi Diriya case, provides a disincentive for recruitment to armed groups. 
The NEHRP, along with housing constructed under another project—the Tsunami Emergency Recovery Project 
(TERP)—promotes ethnic integration. Where houses were reconstructed in multi-ethnic divisions and villages, the 
projects helped integrate multi-ethnic administrative divisions and villages through shared reconstruction activity. The 
NEHRP and TERP also deal with some of the consequences of the conflict. The NEHRP supported the reconstruction 
of houses damaged or destroyed by conflict. Beneficiaries were selected based on vulnerability criteria, including 
number of times displaced, war-related fatalities in the family, etc. While TERP was targeted at tsunami-destroyed 
houses, much of its activities took place in conflict-affected areas where populations had previously been displaced by 
the conflict. TERP also provided livelihood support cash grants to tsunami victims which helped them jumpstart 
livelihoods. TERP thus helped revive economic activity and injected much needed cash in the North and East coastal 
areas in 2005. The Puttalam Housing Project (PHP) also addresses some of the human consequences of the conflict by 
supporting populations that have been internally displaced for the long term. These internally displaced persons cannot 
return to their home villages in the North and have shown a willingness to stay in the Puttalam district. 

C. 

STRENGTHENING TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY 

64. 
Governance in Sri Lanka has several fundamental strengths, chief among them a 
long history of elections. Universal adult franchise was introduced in 1931. Turnout at elections 
is generally high by international standards, at 70-80 percent. A proportional representation 
system for electing Members of Parliament was introduced under the 1978 Constitution with the 
objective of creating stable and strong governments. Elections are broadly viewed as free and fair, 
although they have at times been marred by violence and voter intimidation. Following a change 
in the electoral rules that allows the Election Commission to annul the results of elections in an 
electoral district on specific criteria, there was a sharp drop in violence during the most recent 
parliamentary elections in April 2004. The President is chosen by a national electorate. In the 

28

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1978 Constitution, the President was granted considerable powers, including the right to dissolve 
Parliament one year after a parliamentary election.   

65. 
There are increasing demands for systemic improvements in Sri Lanka’s system of 
transparency and accountability. A key emerging governance weakness is the continued failure 
to reactivate a new Constitutional Council after the term of the last Council ended in October 
2005. The Constitutional Council was created by the 17th Amendment to the Constitution that was 
passed unanimously by Parliament in 2001. The intent of the Amendment was to establish 
independent commissions and depoliticize appointments for key institutions of accountability, by 
shifting the responsibility for such appointments to the Constitutional Council from the 
Executive. The continued impasse regarding the formulation of a new Constitutional Council 
has—contrary to the objective of the Constitutional Council—resulted in several appointments 
being made directly by the President, with the Government arguing the need to ensure the 
functioning of the Government machinery. The judiciary has traditionally been considered a 
source of strength in Sri Lanka but armed violence and associated human rights violations are 
exerting pressure on Sri Lanka’s hard won reputation for the rule of law. In addition, Government 
effectiveness is being undermined by continued expansions in the number of ministries and 
ministers—though this has helped maintain political stability. With 105 ministers (52 Cabinet 
Ministers, 33 non-Cabinet Ministers and 20 Deputy Ministers), the present Government is the 
largest in Sri Lankan history. The proliferation in the number of ministers has increased the risk 
of overlapping functions and dilution of the policy agenda. A strong civil service has stood the 
country in good stead for much of the post independence period. But there are signs of 
deterioration in the quality and efficiency of the civil service, partly as a result of mostly unabated 
growth in the size of the public service, and possibly also as a result of increased politicization in 
the hiring of public servants.  

66. 
Parliamentary oversight commissions have reported a number of cases of misuse of 
public funds. In recent years, the Parliamentary Commission on Public Enterprises (COPE), 
which oversees Government spending agencies, has become more active despite continued weak 
research capacity in the secretariat serving COPE. Two reports released by COPE (in August 
2006 and August 2007) reported a number of instances of misappropriation and misuse of public 
funds. The COPE reports have played an important role in fostering increased awareness about 
issues of fraud and corruption. Still, follow-up action by the Government and relevant agencies 
needs strengthening, although some cases have been sent to the anti-bribery commission for 
further investigation. It is a significant weakness that the anti-bribery commission lacks financial 
independence and has no mandate to initiate investigations; it must receive allegations in writing 
before investigations are identified. Nevertheless, several high-profile fraud cases involving 
Government officials have been exposed, including a VAT-scam that reportedly siphoned US$ 
300 million from the Department of Inland Revenue and for which 14 persons were indicted.   

67. 
The Bank’s strategy to support strengthened governance in Sri Lanka is 
deliberately flexible and pragmatic and focused on: (i) supporting core governance 
institutions; (ii) strengthening sectoral governance in sectors where the Bank is engaged; 
and (iii) fostering increased demand for good governance. The Bank’s engagement on 
governance and anti-corruption must be flexible and responsive. To be effective, the Bank must 
be agile in responding to changing needs and exploiting entry points for dialogue on governance 
issues, as they appear. At the same time, there is a clear need to be realistic in terms of what can 
be achieved within a given period of time. In particular, it must be recognized that creating strong 
institutions, changing processes and fostering sustained public demand for good governance is a 
long-term process which will inevitably face obstacles along the way. To better exploit 
opportunities and facilitate synergies within the entire country program, a core accountability and 
transparency (CAT) team will be established. The CAT team will enhance information flows 

29

 
between operational staff and staff working on the broader governance agenda. It will also seek to 
identify emerging governance challenges and entry points for governance-related policy changes. 
It will also help advise task teams on how to implement measures to reduce fiduciary and 
governance risks to Bank operations. 

(cid:190) 

Supporting core governance institutions. The Bank has positioned itself to scale up 
support to improve transparency and accountability and to combat corruption—as a 
prerequisite for improving quality, relevance and value-for-money in public service 
delivery. The Government has requested the Bank’s assistance in strengthening the 
capacity of the Auditor General’s Office; this would improve accountability and 
transparency in the use of public resources through faster preparation and improved 
quality and relevance of public audit reports. The Bank would also support the 
establishment of a professional secretariat for two key fiduciary parliamentary 
committees (Committee on Public Enterprises and Committee on Public Accounts).  
Moreover, Bank diagnostic work such as the CFAA, ROSC, and the analysis of the 
standards of public sector accounting and auditing have recommended a series of 
measures aimed at public financial management (PFM) strengthening—including the 
establishment of a Public Sector Professional Accountancy Institute to improve the 
education and training of accountants with the aim of professionalizing services; better 
aligning public sector accounting and reporting with international standards; and 
strengthening the Sri Lanka Accounting and Auditing Standards Monitoring Board to 
enhance the oversight of SOEs. The Bank will work with the Government to prepare an 
integrated assessment of the entire public financial management cycle to help identify 
appropriate measures that further improve PFM performance. Improvements in these 
domains would not only enhance transparency and effectiveness in the use of public 
resources, but also facilitate a further move towards adopting country systems by 
donors, including the Bank, in line with the Principles of the Paris Declaration on 
Donor Harmonization. The Bank maintains a close dialogue on these issues with other 
donors, in particular the ADB and JBIC.  There is also a considerable unfinished 
agenda in public procurement — even though significant progress has been made. The 
recent decision to disband the National Procurement Agency has resulted in increased 
uncertainty about the future functioning of procurement systems in the country and has 
set back the planning towards increasing reliance on country systems in procurement. 
The Bank remains committed to eventual full reliance on country systems. The speed 
with which the Bank will move along this track will, to a large extent, be determined by 
the Government’s future actions in ensuring effective implementation of financial 
management and procurement regulations. The Bank will continue to keep the dialogue 
with the Government open with a view to identifying the best way forward under the 
new institutional setup.   

(cid:190) 

Strengthening sectoral transparency and accountability. A critical factor in 
improving service delivery standards across the board is to improve accountability. It is 
a common feature of public service delivery in Sri Lanka that the feedback mechanisms 
between users and suppliers are weak, that is, there is little transparency about service 
standards, resource allocation, etc., and only few opportunities for beneficiaries (be 
they primary school parents or neighborhoods) to hold service providers accountable in 
case of poor quality or lack of services. These problems have been exacerbated by 
excessive fragmentation of authority and responsibility at the local government level. 
The Bank, through ongoing and planned sector-level engagement, will pursue 
opportunities for strengthening feedback mechanisms between users and suppliers, 
broadening stakeholder participation in design, monitoring and evaluation, and 
bringing the decision-making process closer to the beneficiaries. The objective is to 

30

 
improve policy and strengthen sector-level governance mechanisms, and make efforts 
to strengthen the demand for transparency and accountability at the sectoral level.  

Several ongoing and proposed activities explicitly aim to improve transparency 
and accountability in service delivery. For example, in education, the Bank is 
supporting the Program for School Improvement (PSI). The PSI seeks to empower 
principals and teachers to strengthen their professional motivation and enhance their 
sense of ownership of the school. It also enables schools to forge links with local 
communities to give stakeholders, including parents and pupils, greater voice in school 
affairs and the ability to raise resources to help the school. It seeks to improve the 
speed and relevance of school-level decision making. The Bank is also supporting the 
establishment of a Public Expenditure and Quality Education Tracking System in this 
sector. The Bank will support the rollout of this plan to the Government of Sri Lanka. 
In health, the Bank is seeking to strengthen stakeholder participation, including by the 
private sector, civil society, the development partners, and the patients in the policy 
making process, by organizing regular Health Forums. In addition, the Bank intends to 
support upgrading of internal audit manuals and the Government’s internal auditor 
accreditation course of studies, to lay the foundation for a stronger internal audit 
function in the future, including more frequent use of performance audits. 

Increasing demand for good governance. An important objective of the Bank’s 
community-based operations is to empower local communities to make transparent, 
collective decisions and improve accountability at the local level. To this end, the 
Bank’s community driven development projects support the introduction of social and 
public accountability mechanisms like participatory budgeting, community report 
cards, and social audit and expenditure tracking, to trigger changes in responsiveness 
and accountability among local government institutions and communities. Gemi Diriya 
also includes a policy dialogue sub-component to help policy-makers develop policies, 
rules, systems, and institutional arrangements that would allow the Government to 
transfer funds and technical support to communities on a demand-driven basis. Finally, 
another avenue for the Bank to increase demand for good governance is the WBI 
program which focuses on increased voice and accountability in poor communities, 
enhancing the capacity of diverse key segments of Government and society to scale up 
social accountability tools and mechanisms, and improving media reporting on 
economic governance and development issues. The Bank will also work to strengthen 
its partnerships with civil society, academia, think tanks, and the media to help create a 
stronger voice on governance and to strengthen local analytical capacity in areas of 
governance.

5. PARAMETERS AND INSTRUMENTS FOR THE BANK 
GROUP’S ENGAGEMENT  

A.  

COUNTRY DEVELOPMENTS AND THE BANK’S PROGRAM  

68. 
Sri Lanka is currently an IDA-only borrower (‘hardened terms’), and is likely to 
remain so for the time being. Sri Lanka’s per capita GNI of US$ 1,600 in 2007 is higher than 
the operational income cut-off for IDA of US$ 1,065. However, Sri Lanka’s access to IBRD 
lending is determined by creditworthiness considerations. A formal creditworthiness assessment 
has not yet been carried out by the Bank. Sri Lanka has some points in its favor in terms of 
creditworthiness, including sustained solid rates of economic growth, an open economy, good 
social and human development indicators, and proven ability to tap international financial 
markets. At the same time, current macro policies, weak macro indicators and existing debt 
stocks, in addition to uncertainties about the course of the conflict, raise concerns about debt 
sustainability, reflected by a relatively weak credit rating (B+ from S&P and the recent 
downgrading to B+ from Fitch). Since these factors are at the heart of creditworthiness, the Bank 
is of the view that it would be preferable to not pursue the issue of access to IBRD lending for the 
time being. At the same time, it is clear that Sri Lanka is now a middle-income country and likely 
to remain so going forward. For this reason, the Bank intends to, in consultation with the 
Government, revisit the issue of IBRD access at the CAS mid-term review, or even earlier should 
the Government wish.  

69. 
Sri Lanka’s overall IDA allocation is determined in conformity with the Bank’s 
performance-based allocation system. Sri Lanka’s overall Country Policy and Institutional 
Assessment (CPIA) Score for 2007 is 3.5. This is a decline from 3.6 in 2006 and reflects the 
deterioration in macro-management indicators and public sector management and institutions 
indicators, partly on account of the escalation of armed violence. The indicative country envelope 
for the three years of IDA-15 is SDR 440 million, equivalent to approximately US$900 million 
for the four-year CAS period. However, the actual IDA envelope will depend on: (i) Sri Lanka’s 
own performance as measured by the CPIA; (ii) its performance relative to the performance of 
other IDA countries; (iii) the amount of overall resources available to IDA; (iv) changes in the list 
of active IDA-eligible countries; and (v) the terms of financial assistance provided. 

70. 
The proposed Bank program takes into consideration the ongoing uncertainties and 
risks, while also acknowledging the existing needs and opportunities in Sri Lanka. In several 
ways, the current period is one of extraordinary uncertainty, even by Sri Lankan standards—
armed confrontations have resumed in the North while the East is undergoing a tenuous 
transition, and the macroeconomic situation continues to present significant challenges. The Bank 
expects that the current scenario of high uncertainty could continue for a while. Against this 
background, the Bank has designed a cautious program of interventions that can deliver positive 
development outcomes in poor and under-served areas even in these circumstances. The IFC is 
also mindful of increasing macro risks in Sri Lanka and will adapt project selection and project 
structuring (including pricing) appropriately. 

32

 
 
71. 
Accordingly, the proposed lending program is based on a narrow set of investment 
projects, assuming the current unpredictable situation prevails. The proposed program has a 
strong emphasis on community-focused projects and projects delivered through local and 
provincial governments that aim to provide public services, infrastructure and livelihoods at the 
local level (the proposed Gama Naguma/Rural Infrastructure, Provincial Road Sector Support, 
and Water Supply projects). The program would, in particular, prioritize funding for 
reconstruction and service delivery in conflict-affected areas, including support for nascent local 
government institutions in the East.  Subject to final design and appraisal of the pipeline projects, 
it is estimated that more than 30 percent of the Bank’s commitments during the CAS period 
would benefit conflict-affected areas.  It should, however, be emphasized that the pipeline for the 
last two years of the CAS period should be considered indicative. It is based on the prevailing 
conditions on the ground and on the Government’s indicative priorities as of today. The program, 
in the outer years, will be revisited at the time of the CAS Progress Report in view of the country 
situation and priorities at that time. 

72. 
The proposed program remains vulnerable to further deterioration in the country 
situation and requires careful implementation and adaptation. A combination of scenarios—
resumed violence in the East, protracted fighting in the North, and a rapidly deteriorating 
governance situation—including excessive politicization in project management and sharply 
increasing fiduciary risks, could likely lead to a significant reduction in new commitments as well 
as lower disbursements from the existing portfolio. Two pipeline projects are particularly 
vulnerable to increased violence and politicization in the North and East (Gama Naguma/Rural 
Infrastructure project for the East and the Provincial Roads project in the North and East). As for 
the Government’s request on funding for the national highway network, the Bank has made it 
clear that the selection of segments of highways for Bank funding require thorough consideration 
of not only impacts on poverty reduction but also the security and conflict sensitive dimension of 
the interventions. In addition, a sharp deterioration in governance and/or the macroeconomic 
situation could jeopardize the ability of the Higher Education Project and Health Sector 
Development Project to sustainably achieve their objectives. Under those circumstances, the 
Bank would carefully assess the situation and decide if it needs to slow down the implementation 
or preparation of projects which are vulnerable to risks. The Bank’s ongoing networking with 
civil society organizations and development partners would help the Bank to monitor and assess 
these risks. In summary, it is conceivable that there will be measurable variations, either for the 
better or for the worse, along one or more of the key determinants for development effectiveness 
(conflict, governance, and macro), to which the Bank would adapt its program. As such, the 
proposed lending program can be considered a ‘core program’, designed to deliver results on the 
ground even under the uncertain conditions prevailing today. 

73. More radical changes in the country situation—both for the worse and for the 
better—are possible, and the Bank would reconsider its strategy accordingly. If armed 
confrontations were to further intensify or there were to be a dramatic deterioration in governance 
and the rule of law—to the point where the Government’s attention was diverted from 
development policies and where the Bank lost confidence that Bank-supported projects could 
deliver effective results on the ground—the Bank could be forced to stop new lending and would 
also most likely have to suspend ongoing operations. Likewise, given Sri Lanka’s many 
fundamental strengths, it is possible that there could be a rapid turnaround for the better in terms 
of the conflict and macroeconomic management. In such a situation, the Bank would consider 
broadening the available menu of lending instruments.  For instance, if the Government initiates a 
broader range of decisive reform measures to strengthen macroeconomic management and 
improve sectoral performance in key sectors, the Bank would be ready to support such reform 

33

 
efforts through Policy Lending. Furthermore, solid reforms and improved macroeconomic 
conditions could pave the way for access to IBRD lending.  

B. 

ENHANCING THE CONFLICT-SENSITIVITY OF BANK ASSISTANCE 

74. 
Irrespective of the country situation, it is vital that the Bank’s engagement in Sri 
Lanka be highly ‘conflict sensitive’. The overriding reason for the need to be conflict-sensitive 
is to minimize the risk that Bank activities may inadvertently fuel ethnic tensions and further 
strain Sri Lanka’s social fabric. It is also important to manage reputational risks to the Bank that 
could come from being perceived as a partial or biased actor on the development scene. For these 
reasons, the Bank will apply several principles and practices to enhance the conflict-sensitivity of 
its engagement when implementing this CAS. At the program level, the Bank has decided to not 
allow resources committed for the North and East to be re-programmed to other parts of the 
country, even when deterioration in the country situation renders it impossible to implement these 
activities. This principle has both the effect of signaling the Bank’s genuine commitment to 
development in the conflict-affected areas and of leading to a de facto reduction in the country 
envelope if the situation in the conflict-affected areas deteriorates.   

75. 
At the project level, enhanced conflict-sensitivity would be achieved by subjecting 
all ongoing and future lending operations to a ‘conflict filter’. The objective of the ‘conflict 
filter’ is two-fold. The first objective is to help mitigate reputational risks to the Bank. The second 
objective is to enhance development effectiveness by ensuring that opportunities for addressing 
causes and consequences of the conflict are pursued to the maximum extent.  To achieve the first 
objective, it is vital that projects are not implemented in a manner that inadvertently fuels the 
conflict. To mitigate this risk, the conflict filter would require projects to ensure that benefits 
from projects are transparently distributed and potential tensions are mitigated through broad 
consultations and redressal mechanisms, and that project implementation is sufficiently conflict-
sensitive (points a-c in Box 4).  To achieve the second objective, the conflict filter would seek to 
ensure that conflict-generated needs are adequately identified and addressed in projects, and 
opportunities to strengthen reconciliation and inter-ethnic awareness have been adequately 
identified. In terms of Bank processing, a special semi-structured questionnaire has been 
developed that will form the basis for assessing a project’s conflict-sensitivity during the concept, 
design and implementation/supervision stages.  

34

 
Box 4.  Conflict Filter to Enhance Effectiveness and Reduce Reputational Risks  

The Bank would review its upcoming activities against a ‘conflict filter’ — at the concept, design and implementation 
stages. In parallel, efforts would be launched to review ongoing Bank activities against the conflict filter, with a view to 
making adjustments if warranted and feasible. The conflict filter would highlight a number of issues which, if 
adequately addressed, would help in both mitigating reputational risks to the Bank and enhancing the effectiveness of 
the Bank’s activities.  

a. Have sufficiently broad stakeholder consultations been conducted? The Bank seeks to ensure that broad- 
based consultations take place during project preparation and implementation to enable stakeholders of 
diverse ethnicity, gender and religion to contribute to project planning and design. Consultations would 
include ethnic groups, beneficiaries, affected communities, Government (including local governments), civil 
society organizations, and political parties. Such consultations evidently have both a pro-active side and a 
risk mitigation dimension. Maintaining the civilian nature of the development decision-making process is 
similarly required to enhance its long-term sustainability. 
b. Have adequate impartial grievance mechanisms been established? When appropriate, strong, transparent and 
impartial grievance-redressal mechanisms should be established as part of project design. 
c. Are project management and administration adequately sensitive to inter-ethnic issues? To ascertain project 
inclusiveness and outreach to relevant stakeholders, project management would: (i) ensure that project 
material and communication is produced and distributed in all three languages—English, Tamil and 
Sinhalese; (ii) have an appropriate ethnic composition and possess requisite language and cultural skills; and 
(iii) make development-related decisions—in particular, prioritization of community-based investments that 
reflect the needs of the communities and do not reflect other auxiliary interests. 
d. Are conflict-generated needs adequately identified? The conflict may have generated needs that are specific 
to the areas and populations affected by violence and displacement. Each project would be asked to identify 
these specific conflict needs and address them. Examples include psycho-social components under 
community-driven projects, special measures to fill human resource shortages in the nationwide health and 
education projects, etc. 
e. Have opportunities to strengthen reconciliation and inter-ethnic trust been adequately identified? Each 
activity would be requested to identify opportunities strengthening reconciliation and inter-ethnic trust, such 
as inter-ethnic, functional collaboration in project planning, decision-making and implementation. For 
example, for community driven projects, multi-ethnicity could be included as one of the criteria for village 
selection. 

C. 

IFC INSTRUMENTS 

76. 
The IFC will support the pillars of the World Bank Group strategy through both 
investment and advisory services. With investment services, the IFC currently provides US 
dollar loans and also takes minority equity stakes in companies. The IFC will continue to provide 
financing where companies are unable to access sufficient financing on appropriate terms. The 
IFC’s additionality in Sri Lanka comes through providing longer tenor than that available in the 
market, patient equity capital, global and regional expertise and experience, and technical 
assistance to enhance investments in areas such as corporate governance advice and management 
of environmental and social risks. During the period of the CAS, the IFC will look for 
opportunities to provide local currency debt financing where it can appropriately hedge the 
currency exposure. Such financing would allow IFC to reach out to companies and sectors which 
generate local currency revenues (such as the infrastructure sector and second-tier smaller clients) 
and enhance the development of the local financial markets. 

77. 
The IFC investments are guided by the following five overarching considerations: 
First, IFC prioritizes working with companies seeking to export regionally and globally. Second, 
the IFC supports companies that seek to expand in the region, to move from being national 
players to international ones. Third, the IFC extends existing financial products to those that are 
currently under-served (such as SMEs) and helps introduce innovative financial products in the 
market—for example, providing debt beyond the tenor currently available (5-7 years).  Fourth, 

35

 
 
 
 
 
the IFC works with companies which conduct operations (sourcing, selling, etc.) across Sri 
Lanka, beyond the Western Province. Finally, the IFC supports the development of sectors within 
which Sri Lanka has a long-term comparative advantage.  

78. 
In addition, the IFC provides advisory services through the South-East Asia 
Enterprise Development Facility (IFC-SEDF). The IFC-SEDF was extended to Sri Lanka and 
the Maldives in 2006, with funding from a separate five-year, multi-donor trust fund. The initial 
funding of US$ 5.5 million has been provided by the IFC and the Governments of the 
Netherlands and Norway. Fund-raising efforts are continuing and program activities will be 
expanded as more donors participate in the program. The program aims to support the growth of 
SMEs through three components: access to finance, value addition to firms, and business-
enabling environment. Initially, the activities of the IFC-SEDF will focus on three key sectors: 
financial services, tourism, and ICT. All advisory services provided by the IFC are priced on a 
sliding scale depending on the public/private mix of beneficiaries; in FY08, IFC’s cost recovery 
ratio was 60 percent. 

D. 

PARTNERSHIPS AND DIALOGUE 

79. 
The donor landscape in Sri Lanka is undergoing significant changes. The Bank has 
traditionally been one of the ‘big three’ donors in Sri Lanka, next to Japan and the ADB. The 
three donors, together, provide the country about US$ 700 million annually, or about 60 percent 
of all donor assistance. Recently, several new donors have emerged in Sri Lanka—including 
China which, in terms of commitment, became the largest donor in 2007. Iran too, in late 2007, 
offered Sri Lanka a credit line facility for the Petroleum Corporation and financing for a much-
needed upgrade to an oil refinery. The UN-family, together with a number of international NGOs, 
is mostly active in providing humanitarian assistance which has been increasing in the recent past 
on account of the escalation in the conflict and associated displacements. Meanwhile, several 
bilateral donors have either scaled down or terminated their assistance, mainly on account of Sri 
Lanka’s income status, but also because of the intensification in the armed conflict. Currently, the 
Bank’s share in total commitment is about 10 percent, implying that the Bank’s comparative 
advantage is not the amount of assistance any longer. This implies that the Bank must identify 
other areas and methods of engagement where it can make a decisive impact.  

80. 
The Bank will strengthen its transfer of global knowledge through enhanced 
dialogue and partnerships. The lessons from the last CAS, the Client Survey and the outcomes 
of the public consultations (para 43-44) point to the need for the Bank to strengthen its outreach 
and involvement in debates on broad policy issues. Against this background, and recognizing that 
it is not a major player in all areas, the Bank would more systematically attempt to engage diverse 
audiences, including through partnerships with local think thanks and institutions. The Bank 
would also more proactively seek to facilitate the transfer of international best-practices and 
expertise to Sri Lankan audiences.   

81. 
The Bank will select its areas of engagement within the strategic objectives, based on 
its comparative advantage among key players as well as pragmatism in donor coordination. 
The Bank has assisted the Government in making institutional and policy changes, and in 
introducing best practices other donors can employ. Examples include the provision of 
reconstruction assistance to the conflict-affected areas, where the Bank has provided assistance 
through an owner-driven housing scheme and community-driven development schemes, for 
which other donors have provided co-financing. Through these interventions, the Bank wishes to 
help establish good practices in conflict-sensitive development. The Bank has also introduced a 
performance-based budgeting system in education through SWAPs and will continue to seek the 
same approach in other areas whenever possible. In the roads sector, the Bank has provided 

36

 
assistance to set up a road maintenance fund to enhance the sustainability of investments in the 
sector.  

82. 
Through participation in a number of development partners’ forums, the Bank 
seeks to strengthen the effectiveness of development assistance to Sri Lanka. The apex forum 
between the Government and donors is the Development Forum which is generally held every 
other year and was most recently held in January 2007. Donor coordination on the ground takes 
place through the monthly Development Partners’ meetings which are a common forum for 
multilateral agencies and bilateral donors. There is also a separate coordination structure focusing 
on humanitarian assistance. Sri Lanka is a signatory to the Paris Declaration on Donor 
Harmonization, with the Ministry of Plan Implementation being the focal point for donor 
coordination efforts. Donor coordination is less active than it used to be when donors were 
enthusiastically engaged in reconstruction and reconciliation under the Ceasefire Agreement of 
2002, and tsunami-related activities after 2004. At the same time, civil society organizations, as 
well as the private sector, have shown growing interest in working together in areas like, for 
example, Eastern development and the estates sector. The Bank is keen on strengthening its 
working relationship with them, both through its own interventions as well as by coordinating 
their efforts with that of the larger donor community. Partnerships with think tanks are also 
important, given their interest in macro and thematic policy issues. 

E. 

PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT 

83. 
The difficult operating environment makes it a continued challenge to maintain the 
quality of the portfolio. During the previous CAS period, the number of ongoing projects 
remained fairly constant (around 16-18 projects). But, recently, the number dipped to 14 as 
several pipeline projects have had unusually long gestation periods. Commitments have varied 
between US$ 693 million and US$ 867 million. The average disbursement ratio during the CAS 
period was 27.9 percent, which is somewhat higher than regional and Bank averages during this 
period. The high disbursement rate is partially explained by the focus on rapidly disbursing for 
projects implemented in the aftermath of the signing of the CFA, and also following the tsunami.  
There is mostly concurrence between ICR ratings and ratings by the IEG, suggesting an adequate 
degree of candor in the task team’s evaluation of project outcomes. That said, considering the 
volatile operating environment explained below, and emerging signs of deterioration in the 
portfolio, there is a need for continued vigilance. There is also a need to further strengthen M&E 
to ensure sufficient focus on results in the Bank’s operations. 

84. 
Currently, there are four projects (see Box 5) at risk in the portfolio, equivalent to 
26 percent of total commitments, representing two broader sets of issues. The first set of 
issues is related to the intensification of the armed conflict. The Bank’s projects have continued to 
operate in the North and East. But a multitude of conflict-related factors—including disruptions 
in supply of materials and other inputs, population displacements, delays in staffing of project 
implementation units—have resulted in implementation delays and lower disbursements rates.  
The Bank has taken a number of mitigating actions to safeguard achievement of project 
development objectives, including utilizing local agencies to carry out implementation and 
monitoring, and shifting project activities from infrastructure to livelihood support.  A second set 
of issues relates to weakening governance, reflected by instances of increased political 
interference in project implementation, poor project management oversight, and lack of 
leadership provided by central ministries to districts. Procurement risk ratings range from 
medium to high, in part because some Government staff lack the appropriate technical 
qualifications to oversee and process procurement activities.  In addition to the need for designing 
and implementing projects in a conflict-sensitive manner, these issues point to the need for the 

37

 
Bank to be extraordinarily diligent in project preparation, to design simple and robust projects, 
and to ensure that adequate fiduciary safeguards are in place. 

Box 5.  Projects at Risk and Mitigating Actions 

As noted, an important reason for the relatively high share of projects-at-risk in the portfolio is our exposure in conflict-
affected areas and the particular challenges of project implementation there. Two projects which, to a large extent, 
focus on the North and East (the Community Livelihood in the Conflict Affected Areas (CLCA) and the Tsunami ERP) 
make up 70 percent of the commitment at risk. In response to the poor performance of the CLCA, the Bank has worked 
with the Government to restructure the project to better respond to the changing ground situation over the past year and 
a half. Specifically, the CLCA now places a stronger emphasis on livelihood support to help villagers rebuild their 
economic base. In parallel, the project’s fiduciary safeguards are being strengthened by introducing third-party 
monitoring, hiring an independent consultant to review—on a sample basis—financial management and procurement 
transactions in target villages, and developing a framework for supervision which allows us to visit a sample of 
randomly selected villages to review practices at the community level. The restructuring has just been completed and it 
is expected that project performance would begin to turn around shortly. The Tsunami ERP suffers from significant 
financial management and project management issues, exacerbated by the politically charged environment in which the 
tsunami reconstruction is taking place.  Of the remaining two problem projects, the E-Lanka Project has suffered from 
weak project management, especially in terms of procurement. During the recently concluded mid-term review, several 
steps were agreed on to strengthen procedural and management issues within the implementing agency. Finally, the 
HIV/AIDS Project suffers from dwindling Government commitment, as evidenced by the difficulties in securing 
counterpart funding and a host of project management issues that it has not been possible to rectify. The Project is 
scheduled to close on June 30, 2008, and will not be extended.  

6. MANAGING RISKS 

85. 
In Sri Lanka, where the operating environment is fraught with conflict and 
tensions, the risks to the Bank’s engagement are considerable. There are two over-riding 
sources of risk to the Bank’s effectiveness: a dramatic escalation in the conflict and a serious 
macroeconomic crisis. The Bank faces considerable reputational risks–for example, of being 
perceived as being biased against any one side in the ethnic conflict. Finally, the Bank’s fiduciary 
risks are also non-negligible. While the Bank’s ability to fully mitigate some of these risks is 
ultimately limited, it must be recognized that there are substantial potential benefits to the Bank’s 
engagement in terms of working towards resolution of the long-running conflict in Sri Lanka. In 
this sense, there may also be significant development and reputational risks to not being 
materially engaged.  

A.  

DEVELOPMENT EFFECTIVENESS RISKS 

86. 
A further escalation in the armed conflict remains the over-riding risk to the 
effectiveness of the Bank’s work. A sharp escalation in the armed conflict would have an 
immediate impact on the Bank’s ongoing operations in the North and East, either through direct 
security and logistics constraints or further pressures on politicization of projects. An escalation 
could also further undermine the stability of the macro-fiscal situation in the country and divert 
the attention of policy makers away from development issues. The Bank would seek to respond 
flexibly to the evolving situation but could ultimately be forced to hold back disbursements of 
certain projects if the security situation deteriorates to the extent that development effectiveness is 
undermined. 

38

 
 
87. 
Derailment of the macroeconomic situation is another key risk. This risk can only be 
mitigated by decisive action on the part of the Government. The Bank monitors the evolving 
macro-situation closely, including through frequent meetings with the Central Bank and sharing 
its analysis and concerns with key counterparts. At the same time, the Bank will strengthen 
attempts to nurture the public debate on macroeconomic policy formulation to build consensus 
around a stability-oriented policy stance. 

B.  

THE BANK’S REPUTATIONAL RISKS 

88. 
The conflict is a key source of reputational risk to the Bank. Reputational risks can 
arise, in particular, if the Bank is perceived–even inadvertently–to be disproportionately favoring 
one ethnic group over another and thereby contributing to inter-ethic tensions. In implementing 
the CAS, the Bank will take several measures to mitigate these risks. The Bank is committed to 
an objective approach, based on sound analysis of where the needs are greatest, and strict 
technical criteria for project selection. One measure to safeguard the Bank against allegations of 
disfavoring the North and East would be that the Bank would not approve reallocation of already 
committed resources from the North and East to other parts of the country. This would mean that 
if funds allocated for the North and the East are not fully utilized, the funding envelope for the 
country as a whole would effectively shrink. In addition, as described earlier, all ongoing and 
future lending activities of the Bank would be subjected to a ‘conflict filter’. To effectively 
implement the conflict filter and enhance the conflict-sensitivity of the Bank’s program, the 
country team would proactively seek support and guidance from relevant Bank departments, in 
particular the Fragile and Conflict-Affected Countries group and the Social Development 
Department. It is also expected that an externally funded full-time conflict advisor would be 
added to the Country Office staff. Moreover, the Bank is collaborating with other development 
partners, including through the Donor Peace Support Group, to develop and improve conflict-
sensitive approaches to development assistance in Sri Lanka.  

89. 
The evolving governance situation also exposes the Bank to reputational risks.  
These risks may materialize if the Bank is associated in its projects with individuals/institutions 
who/which are controversial or seen as corrupt. A perceived failure to address possible corrupt 
practices in Bank-financed projects would add to these reputational risks. The Bank expects that 
its stepped-up focus on the governance and anti-corruption agenda, better efforts to reach out to 
other stakeholders in this area, and enhanced attempts at managing fiduciary risks (see below) 
will go quite some way towards mitigating these risks. 

C.  

FIDUCIARY RISKS TO BANK-FINANCED ACTIVITIES 

90. 
Fiduciary risks in Sri Lanka are considered substantial9.  This rating is based mainly 
on three issues: (i) the volatile situation in the North and East which impedes supervision and 
increases the risk of interference in project implementation by various outside stakeholders, 
including militant groups; (ii) examples of political interference in decision-making and 
appointment of key project management staff which undermine the effectiveness of project 
management and coordination; and (iii) the disbanding of the National Procurement Agency 
(NPA) which, at least temporarily, has resulted in increased uncertainties about the strength of the 
institutional set-up for public procurement.   

91. 
There are weaknesses in both financial management and public procurement. In 
financial management, key weaknesses are capacity constraints in public external and internal 
audits; poor compliance and weak enforcement mechanisms of financial regulations; an input 

9 This is the second-highest risk rating on the Bank’s four-point scale (Low, Modest, Substantial, High). 

39

 
                                                 
focused culture; weaknesses in a fixed asset and inventory management framework; and 
inadequate institutional arrangements to professionalize public sector accountants and provide 
them with continuous professional development. In public procurement, a great deal of work has 
taken place over the past several years to develop the regulatory and organizational foundation for 
effective public contracting. Under the direction of the NPA, modern regulations have been 
drafted, standard bidding documents have been developed, procurement units have been 
established in major spending agencies, officials have been trained, and the basic structure for 
reporting and monitoring on procurement has been initiated. The challenges that face the 
procurement system primarily relate to effective implementation of procurement rules.  
Procurement procedures continue to be irregularly applied and cases of post-contract 
manipulation, payment stoppages and inadequate post-award supervision remain significant 
issues. A robust performance monitoring system does not yet exist and oversight is further 
weakened by the lack of an effective grievance-redressal mechanism. The recent decision to 
disband the NPA and shift its functions to a unit in the Ministry of Finance has raised concerns 
about the Government's commitment to ensuring full implementation of the existing procurement 
regulations, although the Government has assured that it remains fully committed to good public 
procurement. The ultimate implication of these changes for public procurement will not be known 
anytime soon and the Bank will liaise with the Government in monitoring the situation closely.   

92. 
Going forward, the Bank will strengthen its attention to fiduciary risks in project 
design and project supervision, building, inter alia, on the lessons from the India Detailed 
Implementation Review (DIR).  

(cid:190) In terms of project design, fiduciary staff will be engaged on project teams to carry out 
preliminary, project-specific risk assessments already at the PCN stage.  Sector fiduciary 
risk assessments would help to identify cross-cutting issues, opportunities for corruption, 
and potential incentives and disincentives for corruption. Where warranted, anti-
corruption Quality Enhancement Reviews (QERs) would be held with the objective of: (i) 
brainstorming for and documenting potential entry points for corrupt practices within 
overall sectors and specific projects; (ii) assessing the likelihood of each corrupt activity 
occurring; (iii) estimating the impact on the project outcomes should the corruption 
activity occur; and (iv) identifying a set of tailored risk mitigation measures to combat the 
corrupt activity. Project-specific anti-corruption strategies would be developed as 
necessary. Project design would also place more emphasis on: (i) enhancing transparency 
and social accountability by designing better communication channels with beneficiaries 
and other stakeholders, including civil society; (ii) enhancing the disclosure of accurate, 
timely, and clear project information across a wide array of public fora and media; and 
(iii) developing policies to promote detailed value-for-money reviews in the use of 
project and government resources. The Bank will also focus more strongly on 
establishing effective multi-language complaint mechanisms, mobilizing third party and 
community monitoring of procurement transactions and outcomes, and using information 
technology in procurement in order to enhance transparency.  

(cid:190) In terms of supervision, the fiduciary teams employ a risk-based approach. Currently, 5 
of the 14 ongoing projects are considered fiduciary ‘high risk’ for a variety of reasons, 
including comparatively weak implementation capacity, perceived high risk of political 
interference in project implementation, or high exposure in conflict-affected areas10.  
Additional implementation and fiduciary safeguards are being put in place for these 

10 The five projects are the Tsunami Housing Project, Community Livelihoods in Conflict Affected Areas 
Project, HIV/AIDS Prevention Project, Health Sector SWAP, and E-Lanka (the latter is only considered 
high risk with respect to procurement). 

40

 
 
                                                 
projects. In the Community Livelihood in Conflict Affected Areas project, which has 
recently been restructured, the Bank intends to strengthen third party monitoring of 
project implementation and review, on a sample basis, financial management and 
procurement transactions in target villages. The risk-based approach allows the Bank to 
tailor supervision more closely to the risks associated with different types of projects—
for example, in SWAPs that are particularly exposed to weaknesses in country systems or 
community driven projects that face risks from low fiduciary capacity in communities.  
Supervision would be focused on not only ensuring compliance with agreed covenants 
and procedures but ensuring that: (i) funds have reached the intended beneficiaries; (ii) 
physical progress is aligned with payments; and (iii) suppliers are paid on time and 
against deliverables. Finally, increased use of joint financial management, procurement, 
technical supervision, and post reviews—including post-contract asset auditing, would be 
employed. 

93. 
Project 
implementation and supervision 
in the conflict-affected areas pose 
particular challenges due to limited access. In particular, the LTTE-held districts of 
Kilinochchi and Mullaitivu in the North are currently off-limits to Bank staff, as are the areas on 
the frontlines in the Mannar, Vavunia and Jaffna districts. To supervise activities in these areas, 
the Bank relies on inputs from local authorities, consultants and civil society organizations. For 
example, for our Education SWAP which provides funding for teacher skills development, text 
books, some school equipment, etc., in the entire country (including the Kilinochchi and 
Mullaitivu districts), a special unit in the Finance Commission has been established and charged 
with inter alia supervision of implementation in these districts. In other cases (for example, the 
North East Housing Reconstruction Project), it has been decided to temporarily suspend 
disbursements, in part because of difficulties in supervision and in part because of difficulties in 
ensuring a steady flow of necessary materials and equipment.

ANNEX 2. SUMMARY OF CAS CONSULTATIONS 

Consultation Process 

Extensive consultations with a broad section of Sri Lankan society were carried out as part of the 
preparations for this CAS. The objective of the consultations was to achieve an open and 
constructive engagement with a wide section of stakeholders in Sri Lanka, to ensure that the 
World Bank’s priorities for development assistance in the country would be aligned with the 
needs of the people and the Government’s priorities.   

The bulk of the public consultations were carried out during the month of March 2008. In total, 
26 public meetings were held in Colombo, in the Southern Province and in the Eastern Province 
(a limited number of representatives from the Northern Province attended the consultation forums 
in the East). Participants in the consultations represented many different stakeholders, including 
Government ministers; opposition Members of Parliament; Central Government officials; 
provincial council and local government representatives from the South, North and East; media; 
trade unions; NGOs covering a wide section of areas (social services, advocacy, environment, 
agriculture, etc.); representatives from the Chamber of Commerce; academics and think-tanks; 
and bilateral and multilateral donors and UN agencies.  

In order to facilitate a structured discussion, all participants had been provided in advance with a 
four-page briefing note explaining the Bank’s role and summarizing the Bank’s initial thinking 
about its strategic priorities for the CAS. Detailed minutes were taken of each meeting, and 
translation into Tamil and Sinhalese was provided whenever needed. Most meetings were very 
well attended and the discussions were frank and lively. Almost all participants expressed a 
sincere gratitude to the Bank for organizing the consultations. 

While it is not possible to give due credit to all the comments received during the consultations, 
this note attempts to extract some of the main recurrent themes expressed by the participants in 
the consultation process. 

Causes and Consequences of the Conflict  

Many participants identified the conflict as the leading obstacle to growth and development in Sri 
Lanka and associated it with low private investments, diversion of public resources away from 
poverty reduction, deterioration of quality of public services, lack of predictability, and loss of 
skilled personnel due to brain drain. As expected, for participants from the North and East, the 
conflict has had—and continues to have—the most direct impact on day-to-day life. A spreading 
gun culture was often identified as a concern, as was a perceived militarization of the public 
administration in the East. Participants also pointed to the existence of various security measures 
as resulting in higher cost of living, fewer economic opportunities, and slower rehabilitation and 
resettlement. For example, restrictions on traveling have reduced access to essential public 
services such as health facilities and the designation of high security zones has resulted in loss of 
fishing and agricultural livelihoods. In addition, respondents from the East were concerned about 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
perceived attempts to alter the ethnic distribution in the Eastern Province.  Poor Tamil language 
skills among staff in key Government agencies, like the police, were seen as a critical factor in 
reducing trust and slowing down reconciliation by many:  “99% of the police are Sinhalese. They 
can’t talk a word of Tamil. So the minute someone gets scared because he can’t talk Sinhalese, he 
becomes a suspect”. The consultations revealed stark differences in the opinions about the root 
cause of the conflict, with some arguing that “I don’t think we have an ethnic conflict. It is 
terrorism. We have to eliminate this terrorism and bring peace,” and others countering with “If 
there is no ethnic conflict why is there violence? From 1956, the Tamils were neglected by the 
others. That is why there is violence.  Also Muslims are affected”.  There was a very strong 
request expressed by participants from the North and East that the Bank extend further assistance 
to the conflict-affected areas, in particular, in the areas of livelihood, public service delivery and 
infrastructure. The participants also emphasized that the assistance should be provided in a 
conflict-sensitive manner given the sensitivity on the ground.    

Governance and Anti-corruption 

Governance was seen as a critical challenge for Sri Lanka. Some participants argued that poor 
governance is the most important cause of the conflict. Many participants traced the erosion in 
governance back to the 1978 Constitution which vested concentrated power in the executive 
president while diluting the influence of the Parliament. Others argued, however, that the 
problems of governance are less rooted in the constitutional framework and result more from its 
implementation. For example, the failure to reconstitute the constitutional council established 
under the 17th Amendment to enhance check and balances in the constitutional setup, was 
repeatedly noted at a key weakness.   

Corruption was seen to arise from mainly two failures: First, a perception of insufficient 
parliamentary oversight over public spending—beginning with the Parliament’s limited 
involvement in the upstream budget preparation and review (the fact that there is no formal 
Budget Estimates Committee in Parliament was emphasized in this regard), the failure to adhere 
to the targets of the Fiscal Management Responsibility Act, and the need for stronger 
parliamentary follow-up of the COPE/COPA reports. The lack of financial independence—and 
low capacity—of the Anti-Bribery Commission was also noted. The second factor that was often 
used to explain corruption is the almost complete absence of accountability to the final 
beneficiaries. As one community representative noted: “No one monitors project spending, and 
politicians decide by themselves which contractor gets the job; that’s why most is wasted”.  
Others argued that corruption was also a result of low capacity: “Corruption is there, but there 
are procedures and systems in place. We have to build capacity”. Finally, participants reminded 
the Bank that corruption is not confined to the public sector but also, often, involves private 
sector participants. 

Inclusive Development  

Sluggish growth outside the Western Province was noted by a wide set of participants and the 
importance of the agriculture sector in inclusive development was emphasized. Poor agricultural 
development was attributed by many to the distorted policy framework: “Wrong policies have 
impacted on this sector contributing to an increase in poverty”. It was also repeatedly 
emphasized that the sector requires modernization, market development and access to markets. In 
addition, several participants noted the vulnerability of agricultural producers to natural disasters 
and requested the Bank to help develop safety nets for rural farmers and fishing communities. 
Many participants also emphasized that macroeconomic instability was hurting the poorest, as 

50

 
 
 
 
 
 
evidenced by the  increasing hardships faced by the working masses due to the rising cost of 
living.  

Devolution 

The consultations revealed a strong demand for enhanced inclusiveness in decision making:  
“The people have been left out of decision making”. Several local government officials pointed 
out that they were often not consulted on development projects within their jurisdictions, and 
noted that lack of clarity of mandates, power struggles between regional and central government, 
and inadequate funding undermined the effectiveness of local service delivery. As one private 
sector participant from the South noted: “We don’t want to go to Colombo for everything; we 
want real devolution”. The prospects for full implementation of the 13th Amendment to the 
Constitution was intensively debated, with some arguing that the Government was already 
making significant progress and others believing that progress was limited and not likely to ever 
go far.   

Investment Climate and Economic Growth  

Poor infrastructure outside the Western Province was seen by almost all participants—from 
community, local and Colombo private sectors; local and central governments; and NGOs—as a 
key reason for imbalanced growth and inequity. In particular, poor roads to facilitate access to 
markets and enable connectivity were seen to be a major drawback to fostering investments.  The 
increasing cost of electricity was also seen as a major deterrent for investments and growth of 
existing enterprises. Many participants suggested that there be greater emphasis on developing 
alternative energies and developing mechanisms to transfer such alternative energy solutions to 
rural areas. Macroeconomic instability was highlighted by many participants as a reason for poor 
investment and deteriorating competitiveness, because the high degree of unpredictability made it 
difficult to plan for the future.   

In particular, private sector representatives noted that existing laws, including labor laws, must be 
modernized for Sri Lanka to be competitive. They called for stronger independent regulatory 
bodies in various sectors to encourage competition and innovation. Difficulties in accessing credit 
were seen as a major obstacle to growth and development of SMEs and micro-enterprises. 
Several participants argued that enhanced reliance on public-private partnerships (PPPs), for 
example in areas such as ICT and infrastructure, would be a promising way to increase 
investments. However, there was consensus that the overall framework for PPPs would have to be 
improved for greater clarity and user-friendliness. As one Government official noted: “Although 
we talk of Public Private Partnerships (PPP) we don’t have legal documentation for that kind of 
funding. We advertised the rail extension but the documents are confusing. So the tender was not 
successful. But other countries have very user friendly documents for PPP. We have to focus on 
how to promote PPP projects and documentation”. In the East, security concerns and existing 
security arrangements such as restrictions on transportation and travel were seen as the primary 
reasons for low investments. The conflict was also linked to the perception of significant brain 
drain—both out of the country and from the rest of the country to the metropolitan Colombo area.   

Education 

Recognizing Sri Lanka’s limited natural resource base, many participants strongly associated 
building human capital with private sector development and economic growth in the country. For 
this reason, concern about the quality of education was perhaps the most recurrent theme during 
the consultations. With regard to primary and secondary education, concerns were especially 

51

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
strong about the quality of English language education and about the teaching of science subjects. 
A perceived stark disparity in educational facilities between the Western Province and other 
provinces was highlighted as a critical concern. In particular, it was emphasized that there is a 
need for the public sector to more aggressively fill existing teacher vacancies and enhance the 
capacity and quality of existing training for teachers, nurses, and other staff in the Eastern 
Province. At the higher education level, participants pointed to a significant mismatch between 
the skills of the graduates and the needs of the private sector—a mismatch that participants noted 
was further aggravated by the fact that many of the most talented graduates were leaving the 
island.  

Additional Areas Where Bank Engagement was Requested 

During the consultations, participants brought up a large number economic and social issues in 
which they expressed a desire to see the Bank more engaged. Many of them have been mentioned 
above—such as, macroeconomic management, 
infrastructure development, agricultural 
development, and the business environment. However, a number of issues—summarized below—
that had not explicitly been included in the briefing note, were repeatedly brought up during the 
consultations, suggesting other possible areas for strengthened Bank engagement.   

(i) 
Gender equity: At the broadest level, many participants emphasized the need for 
development programs to be gender sensitive. In addition, several NGOs and private sector 
representatives noted the importance of directly targeting rural women as a means to 
enhancing the effectiveness of community-based programs; it was also suggested the Bank 
pay particular attention to programs that can help scale up female-owned micro-enterprises. 
Finally, it was also noted that gender issues are particularly important in the conflict-affected 
areas.  
(ii) 
Estate poverty: Throughout the consultations, participants repeatedly emphasized the 
need to address estate poverty which was seen as a major social problem and a source of 
continued inequalities. The historical tendency for estate workers to be relatively isolated 
from the rest of the economy was recognized as a contributing factor to the high incidence of 
poverty in the estates. But poor public service delivery and lack of vocational training 
opportunities were also seen as contributing factors.   
(iii) 
Environmental sustainability and climate change: Civil society organizations made a 
strong call for enhancing the environmental sustainability of development programs and 
many participants emphasized the need to strengthen water resources management and solid 
waste management.  They also noted that the conflict was causing significant environmental 
damage, in particular in the North. Finally, many participants noted the need to enhance 
awareness and preparedness for the possible impact of climate change, including the need for 
more effective mitigation strategies against the impact of rains and floods.   
(iv) 
Targeted policies for groups with special needs: Three groups were identified for 
whom targeted policies and interventions should be considered. First, disabled persons—a 
perceived significant ‘hidden’ problem which has been enlarged by the conflict. Second, the 
elderly—Sri Lanka’s rapidly aging population was considered to be a huge potential problem 
in the making. Third, urban slum dwellers—perceived as being caught in a poverty trap with 
very limited escape options. 

How Should the World Bank Engage? 

While most participants emphasized a desire to see a stronger engagement in Sri Lanka by the 
Bank, many were critical about the way the Bank has engaged in the past—they made several 

52

 
 
 
 
 
 
suggestions as to how the Bank can enhance its effectiveness. These observations and suggestions 
can be summarized in the following four points:   

(i) 
Adapt to recognize the Bank’s limited ‘leverage’: Most participants recognized that 
the Bank’s ‘leverage’ is limited, in part due to the complex domestic political situation and in 
part due to the Bank’s declining share in the overall financing for the country. As one 
participant noted: “Beware of the political economy: There are many issues which cannot be 
tackled head-on under current circumstances. And don’t overestimate your ability to 
influence the Government”. Against this background, many participants recommended that 
the Bank should not spread itself too thinly across a wide spectrum of activities but focus, 
instead, on areas where it has shown proven success or has a comparative advantage.  Some 
participants tried to alert the Bank to not aim at engagement in the politically charged areas. 
However, participants, while recognizing that the Bank’s leverage may be limited, also 
suggested that the Bank should emphasize the facilitation of policy dialogue and discussions 
on thematic issues with broader audiences. They expressed the expectation that the Bank 
would share global knowledge and play a convening role.  
(ii) 
The importance of strong monitoring and evaluation of Bank-funded programs, to 
facilitate public oversight over spending under Bank-funded projects: “… if there is no post 
project evaluation or monitoring of World Bank projects, then there is no one to tell if 
something is wrong”.  Participants also expressed that the Bank should facilitate ‘learning by 
doing’: “The World Bank has been here for 50 years. What are your success stories? What is 
the learning? I think it is important for the World Bank and the people to know”. They also 
suggested more systematically involving the beneficiaries in the monitoring and evaluation of 
projects: “In the monitoring mechanism make sure there is room for people”. 
(iii) Many participants also noted the importance of establishing effective grievance 
mechanisms in projects, and making the Bank more approachable to ordinary citizens. “There 
is no grievance mechanism. If we propose something we don’t know what has happened to 
the proposal…The World Bank works with the Government, not with people.  You should 
establish mechanisms so people can access you directly, because if it goes through the 
Government it will never reach you” 
(iv) 
Finally, there was a strong consensus about the need for Bank assistance to be as 
conflict-sensitive as possible. The proposed ‘conflict filter’ was discussed in some detail and 
there was broad support for it as an instrument to enhance conflict-sensitivity. It was 
repeatedly emphasized that the Bank, at a minimum, should ensure that its assistance “do no 
harm”. The importance of a balanced distribution of assistance across the country was also 
noted.

ANNEX 5.  A NOTE ON THE SIZE AND SUSTAINABILITY OF PUBLIC 
DEBT  

Composition of Public Debt 

Sri Lanka’s nominal public debt has been growing over time due to sustained high fiscal deficits. 
However, as a percentage of GDP, public debt peaked at 102.3 percent in 2004, but has gradually 
declined since then to reach 86 percent of GDP in 2007. The decline has been due to faster growth in the 
nominal GDP relative to debt, a reduction in the primary deficit in recent years, and a relatively low 
effective real interest rate (in part due to the high share of concessional debt and modest exchange rate 
movements). At the end of 2007, the public debt stood at Rs 3,070 billion (US$ 28.2 billion). Domestic 
public debt amounted to 48 percent of GDP (56 percent of total debt), while the foreign public debt 
amounted to 38 percent of GDP (44 percent of total) at the end of 200711.

Domestic debt mainly consists of Treasury bonds (59 percent of the total outstanding domestic debt12) and 
Treasury bills (18 percent of domestic debt). T-bonds and T-bills are either placed with captive market 

11 The public foreign debt makes up more the 97 percent of total foreign debt; this share is not expected to change 
significantly in the near to medium term. For this reason, a separate assessment of the total foreign debt is not 
carried out. In the following pages, ‘public domestic debt’ and ‘public foreign debt’ will be referred to simply as 
domestic debt and foreign debt, respectively. Debt of state-owned enterprises or other contingent liabilities are not 
included in the assessment.

participants, such as the Employers Provident Fund (EPF), Employee Trust Fund (ETF), or sold to 
primary dealers at regular auctions. In addition, Sri Lanka Rupee Loans—which was the long term 
borrowing instrument of the Government prior to the introduction of Treasury bonds in 1997, and which 
are in the process of being retired—make up about 8 percent of domestic debt outstanding. Finally, 11 
percent of domestic debt consists of foreign currency denominated debt, mainly in the form of  Sri Lanka 
Development Bonds (which are US$ denominated bonds of 2-3 year maturity placed with domestic 
commercial banks) and facilities extended by the offshore banking units (OBUs) of local commercial 
banks.  

Out of total foreign debt outstanding, 83 percent is on concessional terms, provided by bilateral and 
multilateral donors, and with a stable currency composition of US$, Yen and SDR. In 2007, total non-
concessional foreign debt increased nearly three-fold to US$ 2.1 billion. This increase was in part due to 
Sri Lanka’s maiden issue of a foreign currency denominated bond in October 2007 for a total of US$ 500 
million, and in part due to the Government’s decision to open up some of the (rupee denominated) 
domestic Treasury bond market to foreign investors (the book value of foreign subscriptions reached 
approximately US$ 450 million by end-2007).   

Debt Dynamics for the External Public Debt13 

There are three basic drivers of public debt dynamics:  (i) economic growth; (ii) the interest rate; and (iii) 
the primary deficit.   

In the baseline scenario, real GDP growth is expected to follow the Bank’s medium-term projection, 
which implies a further weakening of the growth momentum to 5.7 percent in 2008 and a growth rate of 
5.4 percent per annum in the longer term. With respect to interest rates, a gradual increase in real interest 
rates14 in Sri Lanka’s non-concessional debt—from its expected relatively low level of 1.6 percent in 
2008 to 2.8 percent in the longer term—is assumed. The exchange rate, it is assumed, will depreciate 
slightly in the initial years to compensate for higher inflation in Sri Lanka than in the rest of the world, 
but will otherwise remain stable. Finally, the primary deficit is assumed to remain at its current level of 
2.6 percent of GDP15. It is also assumed that the share of concessional debt will gradually decline as Sri 
Lanka’s GDP per capita increases.   

Sri Lanka’s external debt is below the five indicative debt thresholds used by the Bank and the 
Fund (Table 2). The ratio of NPV of debt over exports is equal to 128 percent, compared with the 
indicative threshold of 150 percent. The flow-variables are comparatively better, reflecting the large share 
of concessional debt. For example, debt service to export is estimated to be 12 percent in 2008, against 
the indicative threshold of 20 percent.   

Under the baseline scenario, the NPV of debt to GDP declines from its estimated 2008 level of 38 
percent to 24 percent in 2028. The decline is mostly driven by the growth-interest rate differential, 
which is initially negative but eventually turns positive as the share of concessional debt declines and is 
replaced by higher-interest commercials debt (both domestic and foreign).   

13 It should be emphasized that the scenarios presented here are illustrative. Certain simplifying assumptions have 
been made, which implies that there may not be exact correspondence between the actual repayment profile of the 
current debt and what is presented here. 
14 Defined as the effective interest rate, adjusted for inflation, measured by the percentage change in the GDP 
deflator. Nominal interest rates are assumed to ease slightly as the rate of inflation gradually declines. 
15 This assumption is consistent with public capital spending being equal to 7.1 percent of GDP, which is 1.5 
percentage points higher than its level during the past decade, to provide room for most of the Government’s 
planned infrastructure investment.

1/ A permanent increase of 1 percentage point in the average interest rate is assumed 
2/ A permanent 1 percent reduction in growth is assumed. 

The external public debt dynamics is relatively more sensitive to changes in growth compared to 
changes in interest rates. A one percentage point lower growth than assumed in the baseline scenario 
would have measurable adverse implications for debt dynamics. While the NPV debt/GDP ratio still 
declines over time, it does so much slower than in the baseline scenario: by 2028 the ratio would be 101 
percent16, compared to 79 percent in the baseline. A permanent one percent across-the-board increase in 
interest rates (except for concessional debt) has a more muted effect, exactly because of the ‘dead weight’ 
of the concessional debt. The importance of fiscal prudence is also clearly illustrated by the ‘policy 
scenario’ in which the primary balance is assumed to improve by one percent of GDP in response to the 
two adverse shocks described above; this measure brings the 2028 values quite closely back to the to 
baseline scenario. It should be noted that developments in the total public debt are generally somewhat 
more adverse than for the foreign debt. Again, this is mainly due to the relatively higher share of 
commercial debt (whether domestic or foreign) in the total debt, compared to foreign debt only.   

16 Note that this increase is a lower bound as it does not take into account the likely deterioration in the primary 
balance that would accompany the lower growth.

The objective of this CAS Completion Report (CAS CR) is to evaluate the effectiveness of the World 
Bank’s Country Assistance Strategy for Sri Lanka for FY04-FY07, by examining the extent to which 
expected CAS outcomes were achieved. The report evaluates the CAS against the outcomes established in 
the April 2003 CAS and the modified outcomes established in the January 2006 CAS Progress Report 
(CAS PR). The Bank’s performance in designing and implementing the CAS toward achieving these 
outcomes is also assessed. Finally, the CAS CR identifies lessons relevant to the design and 
implementation of the next CAS for Sri Lanka.    

A. Government Objectives and the CAS Context 

At the time the 2003 CAS was being formulated, Sri Lanka was emerging from a period of escalating 
violence, peace prospects were more positive than they had been in a while, and the economic reform 
environment was promising. In December 2001, a new Government, headed by Prime Minister Ranil 
Wickremasinghe, assumed control and moved decisively towards implementing a comprehensive reform 
program. Soon after, in February 2002, the Government and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam 
(LTTE) signed a ceasefire agreement, paving the way for peace talks to end the long-running conflict.  By 
the time the CAS was submitted, five rounds of peace talks had been completed and the political 
environment in the country was expected to improve considerably.   

The Government’s economic program and Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS) were articulated in its 
Regaining Sri Lanka: Vision and Strategy for Accelerated Development (RSL)17. The RSL sought to 
accelerate growth and reduce poverty through private sector-led growth. The principle objectives of the 
PRS included: (i) building a supportive macroeconomic environment; (ii) reducing conflict-related 
poverty; (iii) creating opportunities for pro-poor growth; (iv) investing in people; (v) empowering the 
poor and strengthening governance; and (iv) implementing an effective monitoring and evaluation (M&E) 
system. 

However, in the same month that the CAS was submitted (April 2003), the LTTE suspended their 
participation in the peace talks. In April 2004, early general elections were held amid a political power 
struggle and the Government changed. The new Government, under the United People’s Freedom 

17 The Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS) was launched in Sri Lanka in 2000 and went through a rather substantial 
process of consultations and formulation. However, it was not complete at the time of the change in Government in 
December 2001 and, subsequently, the new Government formed the above RSL—which was added to the existing 
version of the PRS and submitted to the World Bank and the IMF as Sri Lanka’s PRS.

Alliance (UPFA), advocated greater state intervention in the economy on many issues. However, it did 
not fundamentally question past decisions to open the economy and also maintained a positive attitude 
toward foreign direct investment. The new Government also had a more tentative attitude towards 
working with the Bank. In November 2005, Mahinda Rajapakse of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) 
won the presidential election, ensuring the continuity of the economic policies of the UPFA.   

In December 2004, Sri Lanka was hit by a tsunami which killed more than 30,000 people in the coastal 
areas and made many more homeless. The CAS PR, originally scheduled for FY05, was delayed for a 
year as the country team focused its efforts on responding to the emergency needs created by the disaster. 
In December 2005, the CAS PR was prepared to reflect the significantly changed political operating 
environment. While the program continued to provide strong support to the Peace and Equity pillars 
articulated in the 2003 CAS, along with added assistance for tsunami-related reconstruction and recovery, 
it also changed direction. Given the continued uncertainty over both the reform and peace process, the 
emphasis of the Bank’s program shifted from reforms to a core program of investment lending and 
analytical activities that would support outcomes in the three thematic areas of the CAS (Peace, Growth, 
Equity), while providing the option of adding policy-based lending in a high case scenario.   

In summary, the 2003 CAS was approved in a context that was significantly different from the one in 
which its implementation took place. Not only have actual developments on the peace front departed from 
initial expectations but unforeseeable events, like the December 2004 tsunami, have forced adjustments in 
the shape and reach of the CAS’ original objectives and expected outcomes.   

B. 

CAS Objectives and Outcomes 

The 2003 CAS was formulated around three central themes: Peace, Growth and Equity.  A return to 
Peace was considered critical to create a framework for sustainable poverty reduction. Growth was 
considered the main instrument for achieving prosperity and creating more resources for distribution. 
Equity was important to ensure a balance within society and especially to address the deep pockets of 
poverty in the North, South and East. Given the magnitude of Bank activities that had to be restructured to 
address the needs emerging from the tsunami, a fourth pillar—Tsunami—was added during the CAS PR. 

On account of the significant changes in the situation on the ground, the 2006 CAS PR introduced several 
important changes to the Bank’s focus and strategy. The changes acknowledged the fact that: (i) the PRS 
which provided the foundation for the CAS was discarded by the new coalition Government; (ii) 
prospects for rapid and deep reforms were severely curtailed; and (iii) there was an urgent need to 
respond to the consequences of the tsunami. The CAS PR introduced a significant shift in the structure of 
the Bank’s activities and a major prioritization and associated reduction (from 33 to 16) of key CAS 
outcomes. In the revised program of support, the focus moved towards lending operations that: i) 
supported human development; ii) furthered recovery in conflict-affected areas; and iii) assisted road and 
irrigation as the core infrastructure needed to support pro-poor growth via reduced transport costs and 
sustained access to water for agriculture. 

Overall, in terms of achievement of its outcomes, the CAS is rated moderately satisfactory:   

(cid:190) 

The outcomes under the Peace pillar are rated moderately satisfactory. This rating partly 
reflects the fact that the expected outcomes under the Peace pillar—as described in the 
2006 CAS PR18—were kept adequately realistic (perhaps even conservative). In 

18 As is standard practice, the CAS CR only reviewed the outcomes that were maintained in the CAS PR of 2006. As 
one of the Bank’s first results-based CAS, the original 2003 CAS document was overly ambitious in setting outcome 
indicators; to monitor and evaluate these was found to be virtually impossible. Moreover, as the CAS PR was 

61

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                 
particular, the two objectives pursued under this pillar were to restore education facilities 
and increase water supply for irrigation in the conflict-affected areas, both of which were 
achieved (although the recent outbreak of armed conflict has put the sustainability of 
these achievements in doubt). Importantly, however, even if it was considered important 
to show some ‘quick gains’ from the peace process, it is evident that the achievement of 
the CAS objectives would not in itself have been sufficient to cement peace, something 
that those formulating the CAS were keenly aware of. Against this background, the 
outcomes of the Peace pillar are rated moderately satisfactory.   

The overall rating of outcomes under the Growth pillar is, on balance, unsatisfactory. 
While economic growth was broadly in line with expectations (at 6.2 percent during the 
CAS period, compared to an expected 6.5 percent), the Bank did not achieve several of 
its stated objectives in terms of structural reforms (for example, increased flexibility of 
the labor market, improved financial performance of State Owned Enterprises or SOEs, 
or reduced politicization of the civil service) which would have given confidence that the 
economy had jumped to a sustained higher growth-trajectory. Even for otherwise 
satisfactory outcomes–for example, helping the Central Bank refocus on managing its 
core functions—concerns linger about the sustainability of the achievements.   

Outcomes of the Equity pillar are rated moderately satisfactory. The positive rating is 
mainly on account of the Bank’s support to strengthening service delivery in health and 
education, and because of the positive experiences with a number of community-driven 
development (CDD) programs. At the same time, it must be emphasized, that although 
solid data for trends during the CAS period is not available, there is a strong sense in the 
population that inequalities are widening—both between geographic areas and among 
various population groups.   

Finally, the outcomes under the Tsunami pillar are rated satisfactory although there 
remain concerns about, for example, the equitable distribution of overall tsunami 
reconstruction efforts. The fact that the Bank’s project adopted a ‘home-owner driven 
model’, with a high degree of involvement by the ultimate beneficiaries, helped mitigate 
serious capacity constraints on the part of the agency responsible for overall 
reconstruction efforts.

(cid:190) 

It is also noteworthy that throughout the CAS period the task team addressed problems in a timely, 
realistic and proactive fashion—this clearly helped sustain the progress in project implementation.   

Peace Pillar 

The original key objectives envisioned for the CAS under this pillar were: i) to restore infrastructure in 
health, education and irrigation; and ii) build technical capacity to implement the reconstruction and 
poverty reduction efforts. Moreover, as the North and the East had been starved of investments for the 
past 20 years and had the highest poverty levels, these areas, in particular, were targeted for assistance. 
Most of the Bank’s efforts under this pillar were addressed through several lending instruments, with the 
Analytic and Advisory Activities (AAA) playing a minor role. 

conducted a year later than scheduled (due to the need to focus on tsunami-related issues), this provided a longer 
period over which to assess the direction of the outcomes.

Given that the 2002 ceasefire agreement was abrogated and there has been a rise in armed confrontations, 
it would seem ironic to claim success under the Peace pillar. However, despite the broad connotation 
implied by the title ‘Peace Pillar’, the Bank’s objectives under this part of the program were more focused 
on restoring physical infrastructure and improving technical capacity—both of which were achieved. The 
Bank was even able to continue operating its projects, as compared to other donors, in the conflict areas, 
due to the local institutional arrangements it had in place for its projects. This said, the reemergence of 
armed conflict raises concerns about the sustainability of these achievements. Moreover, progress has 
stalled in some areas due to security and other complications. An example of this is the housing 
reconstruction project in the North and the East. The renewed conflict has forced the housing project to 
selectively scale back to safer areas due to supervision constraints and material shortages. 

Although the strategic objectives selected under the Peace pillar were realistic and feasible, and have been 
achieved, the gains could be undone by the resumption of hostilities. The Bank has been able to restore 
needed infrastructure—in education, health, water supply and irrigation, rebuild technical capacity, and 
aid in the resettlement of 84,000 Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs). In addition, IDA support has also 
helped bring in other donors, thereby extending the number of beneficiaries.  

Two specific CAS outcomes were identified for this pillar, and although both have exceeded the project’s 
initial expectations, they are rated only as moderately satisfactory due to the sustainability risk.   

Outcome 1: Education facilities restored in the conflict-affected areas 
In recognition of the fact that schools are a stabilizing element in communities, the focus on restoring 
education facilities was deemed an important outcome of the Peace pillar. Educational facilities were 
rehabilitated and refurnished. Progress was also made in increasing access to education in the conflict-
affected areas. In the North and East the number of out-of-school children was reduced by nearly 1,400 in 
2006—seven times higher than the target of 200 children.

Outcome 2: Water supply for irrigation increased in conflict-affected areas 
Increase in irrigated farming area exceeded initial expectations of the World Bank North East Irrigated 
Agriculture Project (NEIAP). The original expectation for increasing agricultural production in the 
project was for 55,000 MT of paddy; however, the latest estimate noted in the Implementation 
Completion Report (ICR) is 90,113 MT. Likewise, the number of farm families that benefited is 33,250, 
compared to an initial target of 24,000. The success of the NEIAP led to a follow-on project; however, 
this faced initial implementation problems and had been redesigned. 

The outcome on improving technical capacity was dropped for lack of measurable indicators. However, 
one of the key successes of the Bank’s program was the help it provided to reestablish administration 
units at the provincial and divisional levels, several of which had been closed down as a result of the 
conflict. The Bank’s North East Emergency Reconstruction Project (NEERP) financed the reconstruction 
of administrative buildings, procurement of vehicles and training to help strengthen the provincial and 
divisional administrations. The reopening of divisional administrations was instrumental in allowing the 
resumption of service delivery and restoring civil service.   

Although loosely linked to the CAS outcomes, another major area of activity for the Bank—related 
primarily to the Peace pillar—was its becoming the potential custodian of two different multi-donor trust 
funds: (i) the North East Reconstruction Fund (NERF) in 2003; and (ii) the Sri Lanka Tsunami 
Reconstruction Fund (SLTRF) in 2005. Despite considerable efforts, these trust funds never got off the 
ground. The NERF ran into difficulties when the peace process was suspended in 2003. The SLTRF 
could not take off because the Post-Tsunami Operational Management Structure (P-TOMS) was 
indefinitely placed on hold following a Supreme Court ruling.19 One purpose of both these trust funds—in 
addition to mobilizing money for reconstruction—was to enhance trust and confidence between the two 
parties. It was believed that a trust fund-type vehicle could help support the peace process while further 
supporting reconstruction and livelihoods/economic development in the North and the East. The close 
involvement of the Bank in this process is testimony to the high level of trust shown towards it by both 
the LTTE and the Government at the time.  

Growth Pillar 
The key results envisioned under the Growth pillar were to: i) create an enabling macro environment for 
private sector-driven investment and growth; ii) expand employment opportunities and increase flexibility 
in the labor markets; iii) improve the soundness of the financial system; iv) increase the productivity of 
the rural economy; and v) improve the quality of public service delivery. Bank interventions in the 
Growth pillar were primarily through the AAA and a few select lending instruments. 

19  
President Kumaratunge negotiated the P-TOMS with the LTTE to oversee reconstruction efforts, including 
allocation of resources, in the North and the East. It was hoped that this agreement would create a conducive 
environment for the resumption of the peace process. There was strenuous opposition to the agreement from the 
People’s Liberation Front (JVP) and also concerns from the Muslim community which opposed the deal on the 
grounds that it was not included as a signatory. With tensions growing, the JVP quit the Government in protest of 
the impending agreement on June 16, 2005. On June 24, the P-TOMS was signed. The JVP challenged the P-TOMS 
in the Supreme Court and an interim stay order was issued on July 15, pending a judicial review. On September 12, 
the stay order was extended and a hearing scheduled for November 21. Subsequently, the Presidential elections held 
on November 17 resulted in victory for Mr. Mahinda Rajapakse who, during his campaign, had stated that he would 
abandon the P-TOMS and renegotiate the ceasefire agreement. Ultimately, the hearing on the P-TOMS was 
indefinitely postponed and the interim order stayed in effect.

The CAS originally envisioned using a series of programmatic Poverty Reduction Support Credits 
(PRSCs) to provide budget support in implementing the PRS and to tackle the economic reforms needed 
to promote private sector activity. The PRSC I outlined the broad policy direction and indicative prior 
actions for subsequent PRSCs. The three subsequent PRSCs were to build on earlier actions and deepen 
policy and institutional reforms. PRSC II was to focus on rural development and welfare system reform.  
PRSC III was to focus on public sector reform, including the rationalization of administrative structures 
and the size of the civil service. And PRSC IV was to follow up on the areas that the Development Policy 
Review (FY04) was expected to identify. However, the weakening in the dialogue with the Government 
resulted in the PRSC series being discontinued. Although the CAS PR still included the PRSCs in the 

65

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
lending program as standby operations, no opportunity arose to conduct another PRSC. As a result, 
instead of having a strong reform agenda supported by a series of programmatic support credits, the 
program became more focused on capacity building activities that were supported by a strong AAA 
program and selected technical assistance activities.  

On the first objective of the Growth pillar—creating an enabling private sector environment—three 
outcomes were identified: growth, results-based budgeting and SOE reform. The Bank Group’s 
contribution to these objectives and outcomes has primarily been in the form of AAAs and a limited IFC 
investment and technical assistance program. Several of these AAAs were initiated under a Government 
that was contemplating further and extensive reforms, but by the time the AAAs were completed the 
Government had changed and was not interested in the policy dialogue outlined in the reports. Therefore, 
although the quality of the AAAs was rated satisfactory by the Quality Assurance Group (QAG), the 
likely impact was rated only moderately satisfactory. The key lending instrument (Economic Reform 
Technical Assistance—ERTA) that was to provide support for capacity building in the Government for 
reforms, ended up being less effective with the new Government (the project was closed early and the 
remaining funds transferred to the tsunami project). And while economic indicators show support of 
private sector development—in the form of higher growth and private investment—these are short-term 
developments that have not yet stood the test of time. The economy remains vulnerable to weaknesses in 
macro-management, as evidenced by continued high fiscal deficits and accelerating inflation (though the 
last has been caused in part by the fiscally prudent removal of subsides on fuel and food).   

Outcome 3: Higher sustained economic growth  
Overall, the Sri Lankan economy has continued to expand at a relatively high rate, averaging over six 
percent annually during 2004-2006. While some of this growth is attributed to reconstruction efforts 
following the tsunami, in general growth has been broad-based and resilient despite possible detrimental 
setbacks such as the escalating conflict, the end of the Multi-Fiber Arrangement and high oil prices.  

The two key AAA studies the Bank conducted to identify what is needed for higher economic growth in 
Sri Lanka were both rated satisfactory. The Development Policy Review (DPR) concluded that an 
unfinished reform agenda and relatively low investments have combined to hold back long term growth in 
Sri Lanka. The lack of investments in agriculture accounts for the poor growth performance and high 
poverty incidence in the rural economy. Policy recommendations suggested are improved public financial 
management, including public debt reduction, the rationalization of public spending, and public 
investments in roads and power. In addition, the DPR recommended improving the performance of SOEs, 
followed by fiscal consolidation and adequate tax policies. Growth prospects for a small open economy 
such as Sri Lanka will depend on accelerating policies for export growth, implementing a competitive real 
exchange rate, and avoiding trade policy reversals. The DPR also identified the importance of improving 
education quality to sustain long-term growth. The Government endorsed some elements of the DPR 
diagnosis, emphasizing investments in infrastructure and education while economic reforms took a back 
seat. In the Rural and Urban Investment Climate study, the key recommendations were to improve access 
to and quality of energy and transport, reduce costs and improve access to finance, and improve policy 
uncertainty and macroeconomic stability.   

Higher sustainable growth will require reliable sources of energy. To this end, in the power sector, the 
Government, with the Bank’s assistance, has moved more progressively toward renewable energy. It 
plans to set up an authority to facilitate wind, biomass, solar power, and other mini hydro projects, with 
the expectation that the renewable energy sector will meet at least 10 percent of the country’s total power 
requirements by 2015. 

66

 
 
 
 
 
 
Although Sri Lanka, recently, has been successful in attaining high rates of economic growth, further 
supportive reforms and prudent economic management that contain the current inflationary environment 
would most likely be needed to sustain such high growth rates in the medium-term.  

Outcome 4: Results-based budgeting system established 
Overall, the budget is broadly linked to the Government’s development priorities and strategies as 
contained in various strategy documents, though more work is needed to explicitly link policies, priorities 
and outcomes with the budget. Although budget preparation involves increased consultations between the 
Ministry of Finance (MoF) and spending ministries, there is still no formal forum for contestation at the 
Cabinet level. The Government has introduced a medium-term budgetary framework (MTBF) to 
strengthen the strategic focus of the budget but this remains, primarily, input-based. When the 
government changed in 2004, the new Government indicated that it did not want to work with the Bank in 
budget formulation; as a result the Bank stopped work on this task in mid-2004. Instead, similar work was 
taken up by the Asian Development Bank (ADB), which is helping the Government to improve its budget 
framework and overall public financial management. In 2005, the Government requested that the 
ministries and spending agencies start providing results-based indicators to facilitate the monitoring of the 
effectiveness and value of expenditures, thereby contributing to more predictable budget outcomes. The 
Bank became re-engaged in this sector through conducting a series of public expenditure TAs. 

Outcome 5: Improved financial performance of key SOEs 
The need for enterprise restructuring was also recognized by the current Government, with the principle 
difference that privatization was ruled out. The Bank remained open to this approach and even engaged 
with SEMA (Strategic Enterprise Management Agency), the agency charged with overseeing the 
restructuring of twelve SOEs. The outcome was mixed. The restructuring of state-owned banks, which 
had commenced before the previous Government, resulted in improved profitability and financial 
performance. The key focus, however, has primarily been on improving the performance of the Ceylon 
Petroleum Corporation (CPC) and Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB), and this has been less successful.  
Only recently were some key difficult measures taken to improve the financial performance of these key 
state enterprises. In 2006, the Government eliminated oil subsidies and some electricity tariff adjustments 
were made in the last quarter of the year.  However, the CPC continues to suffer losses on the order of a 
quarter to half percent of GDP due to delays in price adjustments of oil products. For the CEB, the losses 
are more significant (1.5 percent of GDP in 2005). As losses for both SOEs are partly financed through 
bank credits, this heightens the exposure of the public banks and, given their dominance in the banking 
sector, risks exposure of the whole financial system. Reforms in the SOEs have fallen far short of what 
was originally envisioned.    

The key Bank instrument to help with the SOE reforms was the Economic Reform TA (ERTA) and the 
PRSC I. In this respect, major changes were made to the legislative framework to allow for greater private 
sector participation in infrastructure (for example, Electricity Reform Act, Petroleum Products Act, 
Petroleum Regulations Act, and Public Utilities Commission Act), establish a multi-sector regulator, and 
train key staff members. The rail reforms achieved included transforming the Department of Railways 
into an independent Rail Authority. However, this progress was quickly reversed as the Authority was 
turned back into a Department and all private sector participation was put on hold. Impasses with the 
Government over the reforms ended up shifting the project almost entirely away from its progressive 
reform focus to only providing funding for training, capacity building and study tours. Although the 
project was designed to be flexible and it was recognized that not all the reforms would be implemented, 
far less was achieved than originally anticipated. 

67

 
 
 
 
 
Outcome 6: Legal framework to increase flexibility in labor markets and promote harmonious labor 
relations 
Higher growth, not surprisingly, has helped expand employment opportunities, with the result that 
unemployment has gone down from 8.1 percent (2003) to 6.5 percent (2006). However, though this meets 
the CAS objective of expanding employment, labor market constraints continue to represent one of the 
top constraints to doing business in Sri Lanka. Hiring is constrained by limitations on the use of fixed-
term contracts, working hours are inflexible, and workers are strongly protected from dismissal both by 
procedural difficulties and high firing costs. The PRSC I supported the enactment of key legislative 
changes to reform Sri Lanka’s labor regulations with the objective of reducing costs and increasing 
transparency. The rules governing the Termination of Employment of Workmen’s Act (TEWA), which 
apply to firms with at least 15 employees, were amended in 2003 to require the application of a uniform 
compensation formula for retrenchment. In addition, the Industrial Disputes Act was changed to impose 
time limits for completing labor tribunal cases, arbitration cases, and termination of workers’ applications. 
However, following the change in Government, the quantum of severance payments under the formula 
was revised in March 2005 due to trade union pressure and, as a result, Sri Lanka’s severance pay system 
is one of the costliest and most restrictive in the world—severance payments are 1.5-2.5 months of wages 
per year of service, compared to 0.8 months in the region. Notwithstanding these limitations, the formula 
has made the system more transparent and predictable.  

Outcome 7: Central Bank re-focused towards managing its core functions 
The Bank played an instrumental role in supporting the restructuring and reorganization of the Central 
Bank of Sri Lanka in order to create a more lean, well-functioning, modern, and efficient institution that 
would be at the center of the reform of Sri Lanka’s fragile financial system and thereby help achieve the 
CAS objective of making the system more sound. Despite the still dominant presence of the State in the 
banking sector (accounting for over 40 percent of total banking assets), significant progress had been 
made in improving the soundness of the financial system–the reduction of non-performing loans from 
12.5 percent of total loans in 2003 to 5.4 percent in 2006 is one clear sign of this. The sector was 
liberalized in 2003 when the Government permitted 100 percent foreign ownership of commercial banks. 
The Central Bank has continued to strengthen its bank supervision capacity and has adopted a more 
market-oriented monetary policy regime. Following the amendments to the Banking Act, the Central 
Bank has tightened prudential norms, capital standards, loan classifications, exposure limits, public 
disclosure, and market discipline. Legislative changes have been made to fill the gaps in the regulatory 
framework (for example, Financing Leasing Act, Suppression of Terrorist Financing Act and Payments 
Act, and the anti-money laundering Financial Transactions Bill). Under a restructuring plan, net profits 
and deposits at the state-owned banks have risen and the ratio of non-performing loans has fallen.   

While improving the role of the Central Bank is a key aspect of financial stability—for which the 
Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) review commended the Government’s performance as highly 
satisfactory—the Bank’s AAAs on Access to Finance and Housing Finance have opened up other entry 
points to deepen financial intermediation to help spur economic growth. 

Outcome 8: Off-farm income generation activities promoted 
A key means to enhancing rural productivity and income was to increase access to sustainable rural 
electrification as a means of helping generate off-farm income. In this respect, the Bank achieved notable 
success. Following the funding of the RERED project for $75 million, an additional financing of US$ 40 
million was approved in June 2007 to help bring electricity to remote rural communities and promote 
private sector investments in power generation from renewable energy resources in urban areas. Other 
means of increasing rural productivity and incomes were identified in the Bank’s AAA on Rural 
Investment Climate and in the Agriculture Research and Extension System Review — the latter cited the 
need for Sri Lanka’s agriculture extension system to become more market-driven rather than supply-
driven, as a better means of increasing farmers’ incomes. 

68

 
 
 
 
With the state owning 85 percent of the land, with limited land use and transfer rights, another key means 
to improving the rural economy was to improve the functioning of land markets. As noted in the CAS, a 
major constraint to rural development was the regulations preventing farmers from converting restricted 
land grants to freehold–these had to be changed so farmers could more readily sell, lease or use their land 
as collateral. The PRSC I addressed this issue. The Government was to remove restrictions on 1.4 million 
hectares, though progress on this has been slow. Also, legislation was introduced to address these 
concerns but has been challenged in the Supreme Court and is now stalled.   

Outcome 9: Politicization of civil service reduced and public service accountability improved 
Improving the functioning of the civil service was seen as a key element to make the Government more 
efficient and responsive to the public. A better functioning Government would better support the private 
sector and lead to higher growth. However, rather than streamlining the public sector and despite fiscal 
pressures the public administration has continued to expand.  

Overall, this was one of the outcomes that the Bank had the least success in. Not much progress was made 
on reducing the politicization of the civil service and, in fact, evidence on implementation in several IDA 
projects suggests a worsening of political interference. The series of PRSCs and a Government capacity 
building project, which were to be the key vehicles to achieve the outcome, never materialized in the case 
of the former and the latter has been under preparation for over two years. However, the Bank in early 
2004 helped persuade the Government to put on hold a Voluntary Retirement Scheme (VRS). The VRS 
did not have sound exit provisions and, if implemented, would have resulted in large expense and the 
planned retrenchments would have been easily reversed.  

Towards achieving the CAS outcome of improved public service accountability, the financial 
management team has been engaged in a wide range of activities including: (i) carrying out a gap analysis 
of Sri Lankan accounting and auditing practices (compared to international standards) that is currently 
being translated into an implementation action plan; (ii) convening key stakeholders to launch a Public 
Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) exercise; and (iii) capacity building to meet 
International Public Sector Accounting Standards’ (IPSAS). Steady progress is being made toward 
adopting the accrual basis of accounting at the country level 
. 
E-government was seen as having a high potential to make the Government more accessible to citizens 
and businesses. Moreover, the open-access nature of the internet would provide more equitable 
opportunities for marginalized groups, geographically and economically, to attain Government 
information and services. To this end, the Bank’s E-Lanka project is set to improve the information and 
communication technology (ICT) services of the Government, though the project is experiencing 
implementation challenges due to procurement delays.     

To make the legal and judicial sector more attuned to modern business needs, the Bank has been 
involved in providing the required physical infrastructure to modernize the court system, improve the 
efficiency of proceedings and reduce the backlog of cases. Overall, the Bank’s Legal and Judicial Reform 
Project was rated moderately unsatisfactory, in large part because delays in project implementation 
negatively affected achievements of outcomes, and because several project components were dropped, 
diminishing expected outcomes.  However, the Bank’s project enhanced the capacity of the Law School 
by improving the curricula in commercial law and enhancing the capacity of the teaching faculty with 
international and local training. Skills have been improved in other agencies such as LD and the Attorney 
General’s department by providing and institutionalizing training to sustain the capacity building exercise 
for expediting the legislative process. In addition, the judicial staff has received international training on 
court administration and new commercial concepts to improve the quality of the judiciary and enhance 
their knowledge of advanced commercial practices.  

69

 
 
 
 
 
 
Equity Pillar 

Under the Equity pillar, the key outcomes envisioned for the CAS were to:  i) improve access to and the 
quality of public services in education, health and water supply; and ii) expand the empowerment of 
communities to address their own development needs. These issues were addressed in the CAS by a mix 
of both AAAs and lending products. The AAA products sought to identify the conditions of poverty, 
whereas the lending products employed community-driven development projects, which could target the 
poorer communities via selection criteria, as the key means of empowering communities and thereby 
improving service delivery.

The most recent poverty survey was conducted in 2006-7 and the Department of Census and Statistics has 
recently reported that the national poverty headcount (excluding the North and most of the East), as 
measured by the Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES) 2006-07, is 15.2 percent, which is a 
sharp decline from the 23 percent headcount reported in 2002.  This positive development is coupled with 
the good news that most of the reported decline has occurred in regions outside the Western Province 
(WP), reducing somewhat the large gaps seen in 2002 between WP and the rest of the country.  However, 
at least in the non-conflict areas, the challenge of accelerating and sustaining growth in the poorest 
provinces and estate sectors remains.

Outcome 10: Improve equity and social outcomes in lagging rural areas and estates 
Improving overall equity in the country means addressing poverty in the lagging rural areas and in the 
estates, which are where the poorest can be found. Bank interventions to address this outcome relied 
primarily on AAA studies that identified the poor and made recommendations on how their equity and 
social outcomes could be improved.   

A key instrument to identify the poor was the Poverty Mapping TA exercise. It helped the Government 
compare poverty levels with the coverage provided by Samurdhi. It also uncovered the extent of mis-
targeting and helped generate a consensus on the need for better targeting.   

The people living on the estates are among the poorest in the country. The prevalence of malnutrition 
among children under the age of five is nearly 33 percent in the estates compared to 13 percent among 
children in other rural areas. While the CAS mentions estate communities as a target group, intervention 
in this area has so far been limited to one AAA on the Tea and Rubber Sector. The analysis sheds light on 
the deteriorating conditions in the sector and the growing discrepancy in poverty indicators between estate 
workers and other rural workers. It recommends the sector undertake efforts to improve the living and 
economic conditions of the estate workers. A pilot program under CWSSP II is providing water supply 
and sanitation services in eight estate communities. The lessons learned will help scale up interventions 
under the proposed Gama Neguma operation.   

Outcome 11: Increase investment in education 
In the education sector, several positive results were achieved under the Education Sector Development 
Project (ESDP) and the Improving Relevance and Quality of Undergraduate Education Project (IRQUE), 
which have both shown satisfactory implementation progress, in large part due to strong commitment by 
the education authorities. Among the notable results is a reduction in the number of out-of-school children 
by 12,000—four times the targeted number of 3,000 children—and an increase in the share of qualified 
teachers to 88 percent, against a target of 86 percent.  The Government has also emphasized improving 
learning outcomes in schools where the national assessments of cognitive achievement have shown low 
learning levels—such as schools in conflict-affected areas, poor rural schools, and schools in the estates 
sector. The AAA effort underpinning sectoral interventions has been generally strong and effective, with 
the 2005 Education Sector Report complemented by the MDG Review and Poverty Assessment.  
Nevertheless, there remain significant challenges to improve quality and relevance of the education 
system in Sri Lanka, at the primary, secondary and tertiary levels. 

Outcome 12: Improve effectiveness of health sector resources 
In the health sector, the strategic relevance, thrust and implementation track record of the ongoing Health 
Sector Development Project (HSDP) has been moderately satisfactory. This project supports the difficult 
process of transformation towards a results-based, decentralized service delivery model, while attempting 
to improve the focus of interventions on preventive care services. Progress has been steady at the district 
and provincial levels but less clear at the central level where problems associated with resistance to 
change are compounded by the complexity and overly ambitious design of the central level-related 
components. The process of increasing allocations to the provincial councils and districts was reversed in 
2007 and there were attempts to recentralize several health functions. The funds released to provincial 
councils were reduced, particularly for capital expenditure. Of some concern are the lack of satisfactory 
monitoring and evaluation (M&E) arrangements which hamper the tracking of results and progress 
towards expected outcomes.   

Though the number of districts performing at a minimum standard for various health indicators has risen, 
the amount spent per capita has also increased. Therefore, although progress has been made on the CAS’ 
strategic objective of improving the health status of the population, whether this has been brought about 

71

 
 
 
 
 
 
by improved effectiveness in using existing health sector resources or because more money is being spent 
on a per capita basis is inconclusive.   

Outcome 13: Keep prevalence rate of HIV low by increasing awareness 
Sri Lanka has one of the lowest prevalence rates of HIV in Asia with only an estimated 5,000 people 
living with HIV out of a population of 20 million (<0.025%). The challenge is to keep this rate low. 
Starting in 1992, the Government initiated HIV control and prevention measures. There are several 
coordinated efforts among the different Government agencies to reduce transmission and prevent further 
spread of HIV (for example, screening 90 percent of all blood donations, mass media awareness 
campaigns, etc.). While overall awareness is high, HIV awareness and knowledge levels in underserved 
communities remain drastically low. Only 40 percent of women working in rural tea estates, for example, 
have even heard of HIV/AIDS, as compared to 90 percent of women in other rural and urban areas.    

The Bank’s support focuses on improving prevention efforts for highly vulnerable sub-populations and 
the general population; enhancing surveillance and M&E systems; reducing stigma and discrimination 
against people living with HIV and groups at highest risk; and addressing the synergy between 
tuberculosis and HIV. Prior to the 2003 CAS, the Bank successfully supported the above endeavors 
through the Health Sector Development project. The new HIV/AIDS project, however, is more 
problematic. While good progress has been made on the TB and blood transfusion programs and some of 
the awareness-raising activities at the provincial and district levels, the prevention interventions and 
activities to strengthen health institutions, which were expected to be implemented by the Ministry, have 
been plagued by managerial and fiduciary problems. 

Outcome 14: Number of empowered communities implementing sub-projects contained in their 
development plans expanded 
Building on the global successes of community-driven development projects, this outcome was selected 
to track the outreach of community-managed projects. Sub-projects that are selected and managed by 
communities address the immediate needs of communities and, in the medium-term, tend to be better 
maintained. The CAS had several projects with this focus, namely Gemi Diriya, RERED and the Second 
Community Water Project — all are successful operations that are in the process of being scaled-
up/replicated. Overall, with the exception of projects in the North and the East, implementation progress 
has been good. Carefully designed community-driven development (CDD) approaches account for this 
success and the recently restructured Second North East Irrigated Agriculture Project (NEAIAP) II has 
been strengthened along similar lines. Impressed with the achievements of the Gemi Diriya, the 
Government has decided to employ its principles to Gama Neguma, the Government’s flagship rural 
development project.   

Tsunami Pillar 

In response to the December 2004 tsunami, a portfolio restructuring of eleven projects was conducted in 
February 2005 to provide US$ 75 million in emergency support for tsunami reconstruction. Given the 
redirection of a substantial amount of the Bank’s portfolio, the CAS PR created a new pillar under which 
the progress of tsunami-related activities could be monitored. Under the Tsunami pillar, the key outcomes 
to be measured were: 1) restoration of housing for the poorest households in the affected districts; and 2) 
rebuilding the livelihoods of the tsunami-affected families to help revive the local economies of the 
affected districts.

and Needs 
Assessment, Development Forum: The 
Economy, Tsunami, and Poverty Reduction 

The agency responsible for Sri Lanka’s reconstruction efforts—TAFREN/RADA20—has suffered from a 
serious lack of capacity to handle the massive aid inflows and has been ineffective in dealing with donors, 
including NGOs.  This has created many problems, especially related to the donor-driven housing 
reconstruction program which was to construct houses for and resettle many of the affected families.  
Many of the reconstructed residential areas have been developed without due attention to environmental 
and social issues, provision of basic services, and at a distance from employment opportunities. In 
addition, there is the perception that reconstruction aid has been unequally directed and, in fact, 
significant geographical inequalities have materialized. Compounding this is the resumption of the 
conflict which means that access to the North and the East has become increasingly difficult. As a result, 
the South and the West have received more aid than the North and the East. In fact, in some Southern 
districts, more houses have been rebuilt than were damaged by the tsunami. 

Despite this context that casts a cloud over Sri Lanka’s overall tsunami reconstruction efforts, the IDA-
financed operations have been relatively successful. A significant share of the support (TERP I & II) has 
gone towards restoring livelihoods and rebuilding houses (through a homeowner-driven model), with 
lesser amounts made available for reconstruction of health and road infrastructure and costs associated 
with the operations of key implementing agencies such as RADA. Indeed, the health expenditure portion 
of the tsunami projects was the least successful component due to weak institutional arrangements in the 
Government. The tsunami-damaged roads from Kalutara to Matara (114 km) have also been rehabilitated. 

Overall, these outcomes were successfully achieved with, as in the other projects, implementation 
problems faced in the North and the East. Still, the Bank was more successfully able to operate in the 
conflict areas than NGOs, mainly because of its reliance on local counterparts and agencies to implement 
works in the conflict areas.  

Outcome 15: Restored housing of the poorest households in affected districts 
For the 42,000 families eligible for housing cash grants, about 23,500 partially damaged houses have been 
fully repaired (97 percent), along with 15,600 fully-damaged houses (62 percent). As with other projects, 
most of the uncompleted houses are in the North and the East. The housing program is wrapping up in the 
South and the West but some areas of the North and the East are expected to continue to experience a lack 
of or very slow progress due to the poor security situation21.

The Task Force for Rebuilding the Nation (TAFREN) was created soon after the tsunami, with the mandate 
to provide overall coordination of tsunami-reconstruction activities. Following the November 2005 
election, TAFREN was renamed as the Reconstruction and Development Agency (RADA). 
While 90 percent of the fully-damaged units in the South and the West have been reconstructed, only 57 
percent of the units in the North and the East have been completed.

Outcome 16: Livelihoods of the tsunami-affected families rebuilt to help revive the local economies of 
the affected districts 
More than 100,000 affected families received fours installments each of the cash grants. Disbursement of 
the livelihood cash grants was successfully concluded in 2005.  

Capacity Building 

Following on the previous CAS CR recommendation to enhance capacity-building, the 2003 CAS placed 
special emphasis on this area. To realize the capacity-building objectives, numerous sectoral and TA 
operations, as well as key pieces of the non-lending program—carried out jointly with local 
counterparts—were included in the program. All investment operations approved during the CAS period 
contained institutional strengthening or capacity-building components, and approximately 20 percent of 
the total funding approved was allocated towards these activities.  

Major efforts continue to be directed towards the strengthening of institutional and human capacities in 
the fiduciary areas (procurement, financial and safeguards).The IDF-financed public procurement 
strengthening program has also shown that a more demand-driven, competence-based skills enhancement 
program, which draws resources from the private sector and professional institutions, is required. 
Reasonable progress is being made in procurement, with the Country Office staff providing significant 
training and other forms of capacity-building support to the procurement staff in numerous 
ministries/agencies, with a view to fostering the use of local systems in Bank operations. The Bank’s 
expanding governance agenda calls for a similarly robust effort on the financial management front. 
Improved institutional capacity has been a major achievement of the Bank’s current environmental 
support, and proposals put forward by the Environment Unit are aimed at consolidating these 
achievements by fostering the integration of the environmental capacity built being effectively used to 
monitor IDA projects in the broader sector agency and ministry programs.   

The Bank has also been deeply involved in supporting the design and implementation of improvements in 
the functioning of the public procurement system. The procurement team conducted a Country 
Procurement Assessment Review (CPAR) in 2003, jointly with the Government and other key donors. 
The recommendations in the CPAR became the road map for the Government’s reform efforts. In 2004, 
the National Procurement Agency (NPA) was set up under a directive issued by the then President 
Chandrika Kumaratunge. Supported by an IDF grant from the Bank, the NPA spearheaded an active and 
dynamic reform program that  included: issuing  new procurement guidelines; mandating the use of 
standardized documents in all procurement transactions; creating the Procurement Appeal Board; 
establishing a public procurement cadre and procurement cells in most of the large procuring entities; 
reducing the number of unsolicited procurements; initiating a computerized system for procurement 
monitoring; and launching an extensive procurement capacity-building program. The Bank also provided 
assistance to the NPA in conducting a self-assessment of its own performance, as part of the pilot OECD-
DAC effort on Strengthening Procurement under the Improvement of Aid Effectiveness initiative. The 
recent decision to disband the NPA has, however, resulted in increased uncertainty about the future 
functioning of procurement systems in the country and has set back the planning towards increasing 
reliance on country systems in procurement.

C. Measuring Bank Group Performance  

1. Quality of Products and Services 

Lending 

During the CAS period under consideration, ten World Bank projects were closed–ICRs were completed 
for all ten projects and eight were reviewed by the Independent Evaluation Group (IEG). Table A4 
presents the results of both the completed ICRs and the IEG ratings. Overall, the project ratings were 
mixed, with about half the projects rated either satisfactory or highly satisfactory. Projects that closed in 
the early part of the CAS period were generally rated satisfactory. Projects that closed in the latter part of 
the CAS period and had gone through the change in Government administration and policy direction 
were, not surprisingly, rated more poorly. There is mostly consistency between the ICR and IEG ratings 
on the outcomes, although o the eight projects reviewed by the IEG, two were rated one category below 
the ICR ratings. But given the worsening governance trend, it could be that by the time the IEG ratings 
were done, the outcomes and sustainability were less likely to be achieved.  During the CAS period, IFC 
invested $62 million 
in four projects with 
three companies 
in 
the financial services and 
telecommunications sectors. These investments are performing well. 

During the CAS period, there was a Quality at Entry Assessment (QEA) for one project and Quality of 
Supervision Assessments (QSAs) for three projects (Table 5).  Despite the 5-year project preparation 
time, the QEA rating for the Second Community Water project was positive. QSAs for the other three 
projects were far less favorable. Although the sample of the other three is too small to extrapolate to the 
overall lending portfolio, it does raise a few key general issues.

First, the projects need to have well-defined development objectives that are stated in terms of key 
outcomes sought. This enables an adequate M&E framework from which the project’s progress can be 
judged and key learning captured. Second, the Implementation Status and Results (ISR) reports should be 
used by the task teams to frankly raise issues of concern for management attention—of the QSA 
subcategories, Candor and Quality of the ISRs was the worst rated, followed by Focus on Development 
Effectiveness. On the other hand, Supervision of Fiduciary/Safeguards was rated positively in all the 
QSAs. 

Economic and Sector Work 

In terms of planned versus actual deliverables, of the original 14 studies planned in the CAS report for 
FY04-06, three were dropped (Table A3). All three were planned for FY06 and were replaced by other 
studies. Between FY04 and FY06, 20 reports were delivered, six more than the initial number envisioned. 
Four additional reports were delivered in FY07, bringing the total tally in the CAS period to 24 reports. 

75

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Ten of these studies were policy notes. Of the seven new studies identified in the CAS PR, only one has 
been dropped (Youth Transitions, planned for FY06). However, to date, there are no plans to conduct the 
study, Urbanization, which was requested by the Government and initially planned for FY08. The average 
time taken to complete each Economic and Sector Work (ESW) was about 12 months, with five studies 
taking over 18 months.  

In the fall of 2006, the QAG undertook a review of the AAAs in Sri Lanka. Table 6 shows the ratings 
received by the different studies within the CAS period that were reviewed by the QAG. Overall, the 
ratings point to a satisfactory assessment of the AAAs. In particular, the review strongly showed the 
strategic relevance of the AAAs. However the weakest aspect of the AAA work was found to be the 
‘Likely Impact’.

previous ratings. 
(3) Averages do not include the LK-PER. 

When the studies were initiated, most had strong ownership by the Government. The objectives of the 
studies were well-aligned with the CAS and PRSP, leading to high QAG ratings on the strategic relevance 
of the AAAs. However, by the time the studies were completed QAG found that the recommendations 
were watered down and too general, which did a disservice to the good quality analysis arising from 
several of the AAAs, and was a key reason for the low ratings of ‘Likely Impact’.  This was particularly 
true for the AAAs under the Growth pillar where dialogue with the Government on public sector reforms 
stalled. The other ratings (Internal Quality Participation, Consultation and Dissemination, and Bank 
Inputs and Processes) were favorable as there was considerable outreach to stakeholders and Government 
officials; efforts were also made to co-author some studies with the Government and thereby build 
capacity within the Government.

2. Portfolio Performance 

During the CAS period, the number of projects remained fairly constant, with around 16-18 projects a 
year, and commitments varying from US$ 693 million to US$ 867 million. While problem projects were 
fairly limited in the first three years, at one point, this number rose to four in FY07, mainly due to the 
escalation in violence and the implementation problems of accessing conflict-affected areas. Other 
problems rose due to increased politicization in personnel selection or lack of Government commitment in 
properly staffing the implementing agency. Despite the entrenched and external problems, projects at risk 
were kept under control, leading to realism and proactivity rates of 100 percent. 

In terms of disbursement, the average disbursement ratio for Sri Lanka during this period was 27.9 
percent. And as Table 7 shows, the Sri Lanka disbursement ratio was better than that for the region and 
the Bank during this period.

D. Aid Coordination 

During the CAS period, the Bank has worked effectively with its development partners, particular in two 
key areas where donor coordination has been most active and critical: the conflict and the tsunami.    

The Conflict 
Following the 2002 cease-fire agreement (CFA), there was an increased level of consultation between the 
Government and its development partners, and also within the development partner community. During 
this time the Multilateral Group — which included the World Bank Group, IMF, ADB, the regular United 
Nations (UN) Agencies, and the International Organization for Migration (IOM) — was formed. This 
Group continues to meet regularly, once a week, and has established a close working relationship. By 
mid-2004, the Administration and the development partners created a more systematic coordination 
framework, leading to deeper sector-wide coordination and policy dialogue. A high-level Donor 
Assistance Coordinating Committee (DACC) was created, comprising of key senior Government officials 
and the Heads of Donor Missions. The core remit of the DACC was to have a dialogue/updating between 
the authorities and development partners on the national development strategy and the planning and 
utilization of support for its implementation, ensuring a focus on poverty reduction while contributing to 
the achievement of the MDGs.   

77

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Tsunami 
During the early days following the December 26, 2004 tsunami, a large amount of assistance was 
spontaneously offered by individuals, NGOs and the private sector. Coordination was made difficult by 
the large number of agencies and organizations involved, and by the sheer size of the affected area. The 
UN system helped greatly in establishing the Center for National Operations (CNO) which coordinated 
the logistics and other dimensions of the relief effort; it was succeeded by the Task Force for Rebuilding 
the Nation (TAFREN) and, more recently, the Reconstruction and Development Agency (RADA). By 
early 2005, a Steering Committee–consisting of the Bank, ADB, Japan Bank for International 
Cooperation (JBIC), the UN Humanitarian Coordinator, two other UN agencies, two bilaterals, three 
NGOs, and a private sector representative—was created to implement an action plan for addressing the 
tsunami reconstruction efforts. The Government found this useful and established a regular framework for 
interaction between the steering committee and senior officials. 

In addition, the Bank participated with other development partners in a series of themed Development 
Partner Forums hosted by Government to discuss Sri Lanka’s development strategy. The Development 
Forum in 2005 focused on the tsunami and the last Development Forum, in 2007, discussed the 
Government’s 10 Year Vision–Mahinda Chintana. 

E.  Client Feedback 

A Client Survey was conducted in 2007.  Almost 300 people—including those from the private sector, 
ministries, NGOs, and the media (in order of respondents)—were surveyed. When asked to rate the 
Bank’s overall effectiveness on a scale of 1-10 (with 1 being very unfavorable and 10 being extremely 
favorable), they provided a mean rating of 6.1. Three-quarters of the people said that the Bank should be 
more involved in Sri Lanka’s development strategies, and only 7 percent felt the Bank should be less 
involved. 

The Survey found that the Bank receives high ratings in key areas of its work, particularly in its work 
related to outreach. Stakeholders were positive about working with the Bank, and nearly all agreed that 
the Bank is responsive to their requests for information, engages in meaningful dialogue and 
communicates in an open and timely fashion. In addition, the Bank’s efficiency and M&E efforts, its 
disbursement practices and how it collaborates with other donors, are all viewed positively.  

This said, the Bank was faulted for not being vocal enough in criticizing the Government’s weak 
commitment to reforms and in pressing for a peaceful resolution to the conflict. More specifically, 
respondents were quite negative about the Bank’s effectiveness in helping the Government reduce 
corruption, increase transparency in governance, safeguard against project corruption, and provide 
support to the peace building efforts.  

Respondents also said the Bank would be most productive if it would focus its resources on growth and 
infrastructure, and that Bank research efforts should focus on education, poverty and governance. 

F. Lessons for the Next CAS 

Within each pillar, there were several broad lessons related to CAS design and operational issues.  

Under the Peace pillar, although the outcomes were achieved, peace was not sustained. The Peace 
pillar’s strategy was based on maintaining peace by providing a peace dividend in the form of 
reconstruction and capacity building. The strategy was drawn up at a time of optimism in the country, and 
therefore understandably focused on dealing with the consequences of the conflict as one of the three 

78

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
pillars. In retrospect it is doubtful whether the Bank would have been able to fully prevent the current 
deterioration in the situation through any of its projects.  The lesson would be that the Bank should be 
adequately realistic and modest about its capacity and role in the area of peace building.     

On an operational note, several of the projects faced implementation problems due to the escalating 
conflict, causing a slowdown in disbursements and a reworking of project documents to address the 
impasse. This posed serious reputational risks as the Bank had to balance progress in work with 
maintaining the principle of equity towards beneficiaries. Projects operating in the North and the East 
should have had contingency plans, exit plans or other scenarios in the event that the conflict resurfaced; 
the Government should have been made aware of the consequences it would face rather than the Bank 
renegotiating the terms of the project in the midst of the conflict where biases could more likely emerge. 
Some of the lessons learnt from operating projects in the conflict-affected areas in Sri Lanka are noted in 
Box 1. 

Box 1. Lessons Learnt from Projects in Conflict-affected Areas 

1. Project management: Anchoring a project at the provincial level in Sri Lanka increases ownership at the 
local level and facilitates project implementation. In a conflict situation, securing technical assistance to 
build local capacity is critical. Community Based Organizations (CBOs) need sufficient training and 
technical backup to sustain project-created assets. 
2. Project design: Innovation and flexibility in project design, initial piloting of project activities and close 
and competent supervision are important if projects are to be implemented quickly in conflict-affected 
situations.  
3. Project beneficiaries: Selecting villages in poorer areas, and activities targeted at poor and landless 
people, ensures that the benefits of the projects reach communities and families most in need of 
assistance. Livelihood support to women's groups can make projects more inclusive and have tremendous 
potential for alleviating poverty. However, care must be taken not to cause friction between beneficiaries 
and non-beneficiaries. Having a grievance-redressal system helps alleviate tensions and resentment by 
giving non-beneficiaries (either individuals or villages) a mechanism to seek redress for being excluded. 
Such a mechanism also acts as a check against bureaucratic discretion in the face of established 
beneficiary selection criteria. 
4. Project monitoring: Continuous monitoring and assessing of project processes and impact, with 
beneficiary participation, should be part of project M&E and MIS systems. It is not sufficient to have 
technical auditing without a clearly defined, practical and quality management system in place. 
Independent technical and financial auditors who provide impartial and transparent quality control should 
also be appointed. 

The Bank’s contribution in the Growth pillar suffered the most from a weakening engagement with the 
Government.  A key lesson is the need to get broad-based political support for reforms through a wider 
array of key stakeholders, both within and outside the Government, and seek upfront commitments from 
key partners.  Providing a forum for stakeholder participation in policy formulation can ensure long-term 
sustainability of the reform agenda beyond the projects. This is particularly important as changes in the 
Government are sometimes accompanied by changes at the political and technocratic levels, thereby 
changing priorities and weakening the implementation momentum. 

On the Equity pillar, the Bank was more successful in its education projects, in part, due to the close 
relationship it has nurtured with the Ministry of Education for numerous years. In this respect, continuing 
a dialogue even in the absence of projects can help foster the Bank’s relationship in the sector. As in other 
countries, the Bank was also quite successful in its CDD type projects.   

79

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Tsunami pillar offers lessons on conducting emergency style operations. In the interest of quickly 
delivering the emergency loan, several safeguards were lifted to streamline the project, and a new 
institution was used to bypass the traditional ministries and avoid bureaucratic impasse. In retrospect, 
however, this led to poor oversight and auditing irregularities. Using a new institution rather than existing 
mechanisms also created problems as new procedures had to be created from scratch, delaying the initial 
start-up time; staff at the new agency were paid more than the line ministries, leading to resentment and 
poor cooperation; and the sustainability and continuance of the projects is more problematic as the 
projects were not rooted in ministries. 

Within projects, regardless of pillars, there are also lessons related to systemic issues in Sri Lanka which 
need to be addressed to improve performance. First, it is paramount to have qualified staff for key 
positions to ensure strong and consistent project implementation progress. Staff trained in project and 
financial management and procurement need to be in place prior to the commencement of 
implementation. Second, knowledgeable advisors who are in a position to train, guide and encourage staff 
can enhance the units’ skill capacities better than multitudes of training courses. Third, establishing 
effective monitoring and data collection systems at the start of projects is vital to the successful 
monitoring and evaluation of project achievements and outcomes.   

On the Bank side, the length of time taken to prepare projects, aside from being costly, means there is a 
lack of continuity for the task team, in particular in its leadership. Feedback from the clients indicates 
they had considerable difficulties in dealing with the changes in Bank staffing. 

Finally, because this was a results-based CAS, the outcomes identified were at times very specific for the 
strategic objectives being measured, and the indicators narrowed them even further – hence it was quite 
possible to do well on an indicator but miss the strategic objective. Indicators should fully capture the 
outcomes they are trying to measure; at the same time, the indicators must be readily monitored. For 
example, the use of poverty incidence indicators was ineffective because the survey only comes out once 
every five years and hence missed the whole CAS period. The best indicators are those that are either 
monitored by a project – assuming the project is taken to the Board in a timely way— or have existing 
time series that the Government regularly tracks.

(2004). Increase in number of students in basic education (grades 6-9) in North and East: 195,444 
(2002) to 220,493 (2006), an increase of 13 percent, or 3.2 percent average annual increase compared to 
a -0.02 percent annual decrease for all of Sri Lanka. 

2. Water supply for irrigation 
increased in conflict-affected areas. 

Moderately Satisfactory. As of June 30, 2005, 369 of 379 schemes were completed, achieving 98 
percent of the target and covering 24,980 ha.  

Growth  Pillar 
Create enabling macro 
environment for private 
sector driven investment 
and growth 

3. Higher sustained economic 
growth 

Indicator  
Agricultural (paddy) production in North and East (‘000 MT): 202.4 (1996-2001); 1,372 (2002-
2004) 

Unsatisfactory.  With per capita income rising to about US$ 1,300 in 2006, Sri Lanka is on a steady 
path to achieving the status of a middle-income country. Gross fixed investment/GDP averaged 26.5 
percent in 2004-06, compared to 21.5 percent for 2002-03. Despite major economic challenges, growth 
was 7.5 percent in 2006. However, the sustainability of recent rates of growth remains questionable. 

Indicator  
GDP Growth: GDP growth averaged 6.2 percent from 2004-06, above the historical average of 4-5 
percent. Growth for 2007 is estimated at 6.5 percent. 

4. Results-based budgeting system 
established 

Unsatisfactory. The Government has introduced a medium-term budgetary framework to strengthen 
the strategic focus of the budget, but this remains primarily input-based. Policy goals are now included 
in the ministerial budget submissions but are still not well-linked. Bank involvement in public 
expenditure management became limited soon after the change in Government. 

Indicator  
Budget allocations for operations & maintenance (% of total expenditure): 31 percent (2002); 28 
percent (2004). 
Budget allocations for infrastructure (% of capital expenditure/total expenditure): 14.5 percent 
(2002); 17.6 percent (2004). 
Capital expenditure/Total expenditure: 18.1 percent (2002); 20.4 percent (2004). 
Unsatisfactory. Despite declines in system losses — from 19.2 percent (2002) to 17.3 percent (2005) 
— and improvements in revenue collections, the CEB continues to make financial losses due to non-

(SOEs) 

implementation of a cost reflective tariff and higher fuel prices. Only in 2006 did the CEB start to raise 
prices. Since the PRSC I, Bank engagement on SOEs has been limited. 

Expand employment 
opportunities and the 
flexibility of the labor 
market 

6. Legal framework established to 
increase flexibility in labor markets 
and promote harmonious labor 
relations 

Improve the soundness of 
the financial system 

7. Central Bank of Sri Lanka 
(CBSL) re-focused towards 
managing its core functions 

Indicator  
Total profit/losses of key SOEs 
   CEB: -$76 million (2002), -$38 million (2003), -$150 million (2004), -$67 million (2005). 
   CPC:  $75 million (2002), $50 million (2003), $37 million (2004).  
Public transfers to SOEs 
   CEB: $111 million (2005) subsidy. 
Unsatisfactory. Although efforts were made to introduce greater flexibility, there was also considerable 
backtracking. Labor markets remain rigid and represent one of the top constraints to doing business in 
Sri Lanka. Severance costs are also among the highest in the world. As a result, employment in the 
informal sector accounts for 62 percent of total employment. Discounting agricultural employment, 
informal employment accounts for 51 percent of non-agricultural employment. 

Indicator  
Unemployment in the formal sector:  Unemployment fell from 8.1 percent (2003) to 6.5 percent 
(2006). Male unemployment fell from 6.0 percent to 4.7 percent and female unemployment fell from 
12.3 to 9.7 percent during the same period. 

Satisfactory. Through its project, the Bank has helped the CBSL restructure and reorganize to become 
a modern, strong and efficient institution. Success was predicated on strong commitment by the CBSL 
to undergo such change and the implementation of a Voluntary Retirement Scheme by which 
productivity and efficiency were increased despite a 40 percent reduction in staff.  

Indicator  
Ratio of non-performing loans to total loans outstanding:   
    State Banks: 16.9 percent (2002); 11.4 percent (2004). 
   All commercial banks: 14.5 percent (2002); 12.5 percent (2003); 8.9 percent (2004); 6.8 percent 
(2005); 5.4 percent (2006). 
Announcement of monetary policy: Monthly 

Increase productivity in 
the rural economy 

8. Off-farm income generation 
activities promoted through 
sustainable rural electrification, 
including in conflict-ridden areas. 

Satisfactory. An additional 84,000 households/small enterprises have been supplied with off-grid 
renewable electricity. A total of 18,957 household-based livelihood support activities were completed 
with cash loans. All loan recipients were women and the activities undertaken were in most cases 
geared toward the women’s own economic empowerment and household food security — such as 
animal husbandry and agriculture-related businesses. 

Indicator  
Number of economic activities using off-grid electricity: 400 (2004), 782 (2007) households/small 
enterprises undertaking income-generating activities using off-grid electricity. 

Improve the quality of 
public service delivery 

9. Politicization of the civil service 
reduced and public service 

Unsatisfactory. In 2006, public employees accounted for 13.4 percent of the employed. The Bank’s 
activities to address public accountability were curtailed. Funds in the project were moved to tsunami 

82

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
accountability improved 

reconstruction activities. 

Equity Pillar 
Improve overall equity in 
the country. 

10. Reduction of poverty, especially 
in lagging rural areas and estates; 
improvement in social outcomes in 
the estates sector, and; better 
targeting of welfare programs to the 
poor. 

Improve the quality of 
the basic education 
system 

11. Investment in education 
increased, especially in poor schools, 
including in learning resources and 
teaching materials. 

Indicator  
Growth of public sector employment: Between 2002 and 2006, public sector employment grew by 9 
percent; during this period, private sector employment grew by 3.1 percent.   

Inconclusive. Latest poverty survey was conducted in 2002. The Bank has been engaged in several 
AAA activities that specifically address the needs of lagging rural areas and estates. These have been 
recently released to the Government. 

Indicator  
National poverty headcount ratio: 23 percent (2002) 
Urban-rural gap in poverty headcount: 17 percentage points (2002) 
Coverage of Samurdhi among the poorest 10 percent of population: 69 percent (2000) 
Share of poorest 20 percent of population in total Samurdhi benefits: 25 percent (2000) 
Poverty headcount ratio for estates sector: 30 percent (2002) 

Satisfactory. About 12,000 out-of-school children in the age range 6-14 years were brought into the 
education system in 2006. Capital education budget prioritized for higher-order spaces and assets, such 
as IT centers, libraries, equipment and books, rose to 35 percent in 2007 compared to less than 20 
percent in 2006. Likewise, the recurrent education budget prioritized for higher-order processes and 
inputs rose from less than 0.5 percent of the recurrent education budget to 2.4 percent, exceeding the 
2007 target. An important factor was the introduction of the Norm Based Unit Cost Resource Allocation 
Mechanism, a formula which has been applied successfully to increase equity in basic education. 

Indicator  
Survival rate to grade 9: 78 percent (2004) 
Proficiency of graduates in English: 42 percent (2004) 
Average English scores of graduates: 59 (2005); 67 (2007) 

Improve health status of 
the population 

12. Effectiveness of the health 
sector’s use of existing resources 
improved 

Moderately Satisfactory. The number of districts (out of 25) that have an infant mortality rate of lower 
than 12.2/1000 live births has increased from 14 (2001) to 17 (2003). Similarly, for maternal mortality, 
the number of districts with rates lower than 46.9/100,000 has increased from 12 (2001) to 16 (2004). 
Public health per capita expenditure rose from $13.7 (2002) to $17.4. 

Indicator  
Percent of districts with satisfactory annual financial and physical progress reports: 100 percent 
of districts presented timely Annual Health Plans in 2006, up from 0 in 2004. And 75 percent of 
districts submitted outcome and output based progress monitoring reports. 

Curb spread of HIV 
infection 

13. Health awareness increased to 
ensure that HIV prevalence rate 
among: (a) women (aged 15-24) 

Unsatisfactory. With only an estimated 5,000 people with HIV out of a population of 20 million, Sri 
Lanka still has one of the lowest prevalence rates of HIV in Asia. However, the proportion of women 
among those infected with HIV has increased from 21 percent (1987-91) to 47 percent (2002-05), 

83

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
attending antenatal clinics remains 
below 1 percent; and (b) STD clinic 
population stays below 5 percent. 

Improve access to 
services in the poor 
districts 

14. Number of empowered 
communities implementing sub-
projects contained in their 
development plans expanded 

though this is partly as a result of increased testing of women. While progress on this outcome has been 
satisfactory, Bank efforts have been stalled by poor implementation of the HIV project. 

Indicator  
HIV prevalence among women (aged 15-24): <1 percent (2007)  
Number of new cases of HIV in young adults (aged 15-24): 50 (2002); 91 (2004)  
HIV prevalence among STD clinic population: <1 percent  

Satisfactory. In Gemi Diriya, within a short period of time, the project has reached over 80 percent of 
the 1000 targeted villages. In the CWSSP, 172 villages (or 34,500 households) have been covered. 
Progress has been thwarted in conflict-affected areas.   

Indicator  
Poverty incidence in participating villages by district: 
(cid:132) Galle: 26 (2002) 
(cid:132) Matara: 27 (2002) 
(cid:132) Mon’gala: 37 (2002) 
(cid:132) Badulla:37 (2002)

(cid:132) Nuwara Eliya: 23 (2002) 
(cid:132) NATIONAL: 22.7 (2002) 

Tsunami Pillar 
Restore livelihoods 
destroyed by the tsunami 
and start the recovery 
and reconstruction 
process. 

15. Restored housing of the poorest 
households in affected districts. 

Satisfactory. As of March 2007, about 80 percent of eligible families had fully completed their houses; 
most of the uncompleted houses are in the North and the East. The assistance has been fairly well 
targeted, with only about 6 percent of housing support cash grant recipients found ineligible. 

Indicator  
Number of totally damaged houses repaired: 15,600 (97 percent) 
Number of partially damaged houses repaired: 23,500 (62 percent) 

16. Livelihoods of the tsunami-
affected families rebuilt to help 
revive the local economies of the 
affected districts. 

Satisfactory. Among the group that was hit the hardest — the self-employed and casual workers – more 
than 80 percent regained employment within a year and a half of the tsunami. The 114km of road 
section between Galle and Colombo has been rehabilitated. The livelihood support component was 
successfully concluded in 2005. 

Indicator  
Share of deserving families reached through cash grants: 100,000 families  
Percent disbursed of financing required for cash for work programs: 41 percent.

Strengthening ($5 million) and Mahaweli ($5 million).  A Component ‘Z’ was added to the three projects and the project agreements amended to reflect this. 
When the rest of the PSID project was closed in June 2003, Component ‘Z’ or NEERP, was left open. OPCS ruled that an ICR was not needed as one had already
