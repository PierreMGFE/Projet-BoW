E X E C U T I V E S UMM A R Y 
Rwanda has made remarkable progress since the 1994 genocide and civil war. Peace and 
p o l i t i c a l s tab i l i ty have been re-established, reconc i l ia t ion e f fo r ts are con t inu ing , and democratic 
ins t i tu t ions and processes are being strengthened. Pove r ty and soc ia l ind ica tors have also improved . 
G i v e n the considerable g round los t during the genocide and c i v i l w a r Rw a n d a i s s t i l l b e h i n d comparators 
in the reg ion on k e y econom ic and soc ia l ind ica tors . Rwanda’s key challenge going forward i s to 
leverage i t s recent progress for a much higher development path that w i l l put the country’s long 
term economic and social aspirations within reach. 
The spectacular growth effects o f Rwanda’s post-conflict reconstruction appears to be fully 
exhausted and growth has now slowed. M u c h higher g r ow t h rates are needed t o s ign i f ican t ly reduce 
pove r ty and move towa rds the ob jec t ive o f m i d d l e income status. This requ ires t rans fo rma t ion o f the 
economy in the f o l l o w i n g ways : (i) h igher p r o d u c t i v i t y and c omm e r c i a l o r ien ta t ion o f agriculture; (ii) 
broad access t o k e y in f ras t ruc tu re a t a m u c h l ow e r cost; (iii) a m o d em and d y n am i c p r i v a t e sector able t o 
lead growth; (iv) d i v e r s i f i e d base o f econom ic ac t iv i t ies ; and (v) full in teg ra t ion i n t o Eastern and 
Southern A f r i c a . 
Significant investment in developing human capital i s needed to fully harness Rwanda’s 
most important asset-its 
population-for development. T h e challenges are: (i) a severe d e f i c i t o f 
labor marke t s k i l l s due in pa r t t o the absence o f an integrated p o l i c y f o r pos t-bas ic education-this 
d e f i c i t 
i s ev iden t in the m u c h h ighe r than average wages for s k i l l e d personne l in Rw a n d a than in other parts o f 
the region; (ii) l o w q u a l i t y o f educa t ion f o l l ow i n g r a p i d progress in expand ing access pa r t icu la r ly at the 
p r im a r y level; (iii) c h i l d and ma terna l m o r t a l i t y rates amongst the h ighes t on the con t inen t due t o 
physical, geographic, and f i n a n c i a l barr iers t o accessing h i g h - q u a l i t y services and t o behav iora l and 
cu l tu ra l factors; and (iv) addressing the needs o f the d i f fe ren t popu la t ions o f vu lne rab le groups. 
iv. 
Strengthening public institutions including several that have been created within the last 
decade i s critical fo r achieving more rapid development progress. C o r e p u b l i c sector func t ions 
requ ire strengthening, p a r t i c u l a r l y at the decentralized l e v e l and suppor t i s needed f o r c i v i l society t o 
emerge as a mo re e f fec t ive deve lopmen t actor, able t o h o l d governmen t accountable. 
v. 
Rwanda’s long term development vision articulated i n the Rwanda Vision 2020 document i s 
to become a lower middle income economy (US$900 per capita) operating as a knowledge-based 
service hub by 2020. Within this l o n g te rm v i s i o n the Econom ic Deve lopmen t and Pove r ty Reduc t ion 
Strategy (EDPRS) assigns the h ighes t p r i o r i t y t o acce lera t ing g r ow t h t o create emp loymen t and generate 
exports. The strategy i s framed a round three strategic f lagsh ip programs : 
Flagship one (Growth) targets economy w i d e improvemen ts in p r o d u c t i v i t y . I t s g o a l i s t o t rans fo rm 
Rwanda’s economy f r o m subsistence agr icu l ture towards increased c omm e r c i a l agr icu l ture , as w e l l as 
manu fac tu r ing and services. 
Flagship two (Vision 2020 Umurenge) focuses on ensur ing g r ow t h i s shared by c rea t ing econom ic

packages; and (iii) d i rec t supports. 
Flagship three (Governance) seeks t o strengthen p o l i t i c a l and econom ic governance, and build 
ins t i tu t ions and capac i ty o f the state. I t envisages a w i d e range o f r e f o rm s t o strengthen p u b l i c sector 
ins t i tu t ions and capac i ty and a lso inc ludes aspects needed t o create an a t t rac t ive business env ironmen t 
i n c l u d i n g s treng then ing c omm e r c i a l j u s t i c e systems, regu la to ry and adm in is t ra t ive frameworks, and 
p romo t ing p r inc ip les o f good corpora te governance. 
v i . 
The Wor ld Bank Group Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Rwanda for FY09-12 has 
been jointly prepared by I D A , the International Finance Corporation ( IFC) , and the Mu lt i latera l 
Investment Guarantee Agency (M I G A ) i n an effort to draw greater synergies from our work and 

1

catalyze higher volumes o f private resources to support Rwanda’s development. I t i s closely aligned 
with the EDPRS and seeks stronger impact through greater selectivity in l i n e with Government o f 
Rwanda’s (GoR) preferences for engagement with the Bank and enhanced harmonization with other 
donors. N o new financing from the International Development Association (IDA) i s envisaged for 
Primary Education, HIV/AIDS, Urban Management, Water and Sanitation, and C iv i l Service Reform. 
vii. 
The CAS i s framed around two strategic themes: 
Promote economic transformation and growth. The primary objective o f the CAS i s to help 
Rwanda make progress in activating new drivers o f growth that can be sustained over time. The 
substantial part o f the financial envelope over the period w i l l therefore support the EDPRS flagship 
on growth and focus on four key outcomes: (i) raising agricultural production in a sustainable way; 
(ii) improving access to and quality o f key economic infrastructure services; (iii) improving the 
environment for private sector development; and (iv) strengthening management o f public resources 
at cen t ra l and local levels. 
Reduce social vulnerability. A secondary objective i s to ensure that the most vulnerable Rwandans 
also benefit from growth and to help Rwanda make further progress in building a more stable society. 
Building on progress to date in reform and development o f delivery o f basic services, a smaller 
program w i l l involve support t o the Flagship Vision 2020 Umurenge (village) initiative; reducing 
vulnerability o f Rwandan children and mothers to high rates o f mortality; and promoting peace and 
social cohesion through demobilization and reintegration. I t w i l l seek to contribute to mitigating 
health and soc ia l risks-to vulnerable groups and to soc ia l cohesion in Rwanda. 
v i i i . 
These themes w i l l be supported through a series o f Poverty Reduction Strategy Grants 
(PRSG) and select investment lending i n the indicative total amount of SDR 344 million (about 
U S 5 6 1 equivalent) during FY09-12. Actual allocations during the CAS period w i l l be determined on 
an annual basis and w i l l depend on: (i) total IDA resources available; (ii) Rwanda’s performance rating 
relative to that o f other ID A borrowers; (iii) financing terms (credits or grants); and (iv) number o f IDA - 
eligible countries. Analytical and advisory activities (AAA) w i l l be used strategically to complement 
financial support. 
ix. 
Harmonization w ith other development players w i l l be enhanced under the CAS. This w i l l 
be done through mechanisms such as the recently agreed Common Performance Assessment Framework 
which provides an opportunity for the Bank to harmonize i t s Budget Support Program and dialogue with 
those o f other budget support donors; through the preparation o f Sector-Wide Approach (SWAps) 
particularly in the sectors where the Bank i s a lead donor -here we can play an even stronger role in 
facilitating harmonization and alignment o f other donors in the sectors; and through specific initiative 
such as the enhanced harmonization and collaboration between the World Bank, the AfDB and t h e EC, 
particularly in t h e area o f Budget Support, Public Financial Management and Infrastructure. We w i l l also 
seek greater collaboration with non traditional stakeholders and potential f inancers as well as various 
philanthropic organizations that are increasingly active in Rwanda. 
x. 
The overall outlook f o r Rwanda i s positive. Bu t there are nonetheless r i s k s that could 
derail the implementation o f the CAS o r l im it i t s impact. These include: (i) weak implementation 
capacity particularly at the decentralized levels; (ii) regional neighborhood r i s k s including the threat of 
conflict and political instability in the region; the country’s landlocked location which could negatively 
affect trade, export and private sector growth; and risks from migratory diseases that could impact 
Rwanda; (iii) exogenous shocks given the limited diversification o f the economy; and (iv) potential 
instability related to parliamentary elections in 2008 and presidential e lec t ions in 2010. These r i s k s can 
be reduced through measures such as mainstreaming support to capacity building; greater emphasis on 
regional transport; and strong support to Vision 2020 implementation. Food prices in Rwanda have r i s e n 
steadily over the past two years and could be exacerbated by any declines in agricultural productivity. 
Support to sustainably raising domestic agricultural productivity remains critical for containing this risk.

COUNTRY ASSISTANCE STRATEGY 
F O R THE REPUBL IC O F RW A N D A 

I. I N T R O D U C T I O N 

1. 
Almost a decade and a half after the devastating genocide and civil war, Rwanda has made 
remarkable progress in rebuilding its politics, economy and society, implementing bold reforms. 

The Wo r ld Bank has supported this progress through two assistance strategies and one in ter im strategy. 

2. 
The first Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) was presented to Executive Directors in March 
1998 to support Rwanda’s transition effort f rom war to peace. 
In December 2002, Bank Executive 
Directors discussed a second CAS supporting implementation o f Rwanda’s f i r s t Poverty Reduction 
Strategy Paper (PRSP) w i th a focus on lay ing the foundations for grow th and sustainable human 
development. 

3 . 

An Inter im Strategy Note ( I S N ) discussed b y the Board in August 2006 extended the second 
CAS wh i le the Government completed preparation o f i t s second PRSP-the Economic Development and 
Poverty Reduction Strategy (EDPRS)-allowing 
this new CAS to be directly aligned w i th the EDPRS. 

4 . 
This CAS, based on Rwanda’s EDPRS, w i l l build on the foundation laid in previous 
strategies and support a strong push on Rwanda’s growth agenda. I t provides the framework fo r 

Wo r ld Bank Group ( IDA , IFC and M I G A ) support to Rwanda fo r the period 2009-2012 . Gu id ing 
principles for engagement include: alignment w i th the EDPRS, selectivity 
fo r greater impact, 
government’s preferences for engagement w i th the Bank, and enhanced harmonization w i th other donors. 

11. COUNTRY C O N T E X T 

5 . 

A. Politics and Governance 
Since the 1994 genocide, politics and governance in Rwanda have been shaped by tw o key 
objectives: (i) ending the recurring cycle o f ethnic based political violence that has characterized 
post-independence history; and (ii) reducing the r o l e and control o f the central government in 

decision making and development action. T o achieve these objectives, Rwanda has sought to create a 
more inclusive form o f governance based on one national iden t i ty and using po l i t ica l arrangements, 
processes and institutions that are largely homegrown, rooted in Rwandan culture and traditions. The 
Constitution provides for po l i t ica l power sharing between the ma in po l i t ica l parties and extra e f for t i s 
made b y the authorities to seek consensus and avo id divisions. The President cannot appoint more than 
50 percent o f cabinet members from hidher party and the speaker o f the parliament has to come from the 
m ino r i ty party. The Constitution also provides fo r strong po l i t ica l participation o f women allocating them 
at least 30 percent o f positions in a l l higher leve l institutions. Women currently ho ld 49 percent o f 
parliamentary seats and 36 percent o f cabinet positions. 

I n parallel, a bold decentralization program i s underway. Th is aims to prov ide equitable, 

6. 
efficient, and effective pro-poor service delivery, wh i le promo t ing loca l development in an environment 
of good governance. I t seeks to foster citizens’ participation and empowerment as we l l as transparency 
and (upward/downward) accountability. In the last two years, resource transfers to districts have r isen 
significantly in l i n e w i t h regulations for f isca l decentralization. Several institutions fo r democratic 
governance are also being strengthened or created f rom scratch and avenues are being provided for 
greater participation o f citizens in governance. 

1 

7 . 
So far , Rwanda’s approach to promoting inclusive and stable politics and governance 
appears t o be working. T h e c o u n t r y i s at peace and among the m o s t stable on the con t inen t . 
Par l iamen tary e lec t ions in Oc tobe r 2008 and Pres iden t ia l elections scheduled f o r 20 10 p r o v i d e further 
oppo r tun i ty t o deepen Rwanda ’s process o f democra t iza t ion . Sustained success w i l l depend o n 
w i l l ingness t o m o n i t o r results, d r aw lessons and p o l i t i c a l comm i tmen t t o r e f i n e the m o d e l o n the basis o f 
this evidence. 

8. 
Rwanda’s progress i n building internal security and political stability i s also vulnerable to 
continued political instability in Eastern DRC . On N o v em b e r 9, 2007 the Governmen ts o f D R C and 
Rwanda s igned a commun ique in N a i r o b i p l e d g i n g t o w o r k toge ther m o r e c lose ly t o ach ieve peace and 
s tab i l i ty in Eas tern D R C . In January 2008, the Governmen t o f DRC s igned a peace accord with over 2 0 
m i l i t i a groups ope ra t ing in the coun t ry . B o t h the U n i t e d N a t i o n s (UN) and the Gove rnmen t o f the D R C 
n o w appear ready t o address m o r e f o r c e f u l l y the issue o f the r em a i n i n g Rw a n d a n r e b e l troops o f the 
Forces De‘mocratiques de L ibe ra t ion du Rwanda (FDLR) opera t ing o u t o f the D R C . UN Secur i ty 
C o u n c i l r e s o l u t i o n 1804, adop ted o n M a r c h 13, 2008, exhor ts the FDLR and a l l Rwandan armed groups 
t o l a y d o w n t h e i r weapons and peace fu l ly re tu rn t o Rwanda . E f f e c t i v e imp lemen ta t ion o f these 
agreements and statements w i l l g rea t ly enhance prospects f o r las t ing peace in Eas tern DRC, thus c rea t ing 
a k e y c o n d i t i o n f o r l a s t i n g p o l i t i c a l peace and secur i ty f o r Rwanda .

Participation in the H I PC and the Mu lt i latera l Debt R e l i e f In it iat ive (MDRI) has reduced 
Rwanda’s external debt to a sustainable level (17 percent o f GDP) although the external debt 
burden increased faster than programmed in 2007.2 In l i n e with agreements reached with the MF , 
the Government i s following policies to ensure that the external debt burden continues to be sustainable. 
External debts are limited to loans with minimum o f 50 percent grant element and volumes are being kept 
consistent with debt sustainability analysis3. A comprehensive debt s tra tegy i s expected to be completed 
by end 2008. Rwanda has also built external reserves equivalent to close to 6 months o f imports. 

13 . 
As a highly aid dependent economy, a key macroeconomic management issue i s avoiding 
the potential adverse macroeconomic effects o f high aid flows. A recen t study4 concluded that the 
rapid aid increase since 2003 has caused a number o f macro-economic management problems, including 
some real exchange rate appreciation and problems in accommodating higher Government expenditure 
without causing inflation or squeezing private sector credit growth. The report recommended that 
allowance be made for the possibility o f moderate exchange rate appreciation, indicating that this i s not 
likely to cause significant damage to export prospects, especially if i t permits investments that address 
infrastructure and other supply side bottlenecks. 

Growth and Real Sector Performance 

14. 
Rwanda’s US$3 .3 billion economy grew 5.5 percent in real terms in 2006 and an estimated 
6 percent in 2007. On the supply side this good performance has been driven by the services and 
industry sectors which grew at an average o f 7.8 percent and 8.6 percent annually, respectively. In 
contrast, agriculture has performed poorly, growing only 1.1 percent in 2006 and contracting by almost 2 
percent in 2007 driven by a 50 percent f a l l in co f fee production due to effect o f poor rains on mature 
co f fee bushes. On the demand side, this rapid growth i s explained by expansion in private sector 
consumption. Investment and trade have also grown rapidly but are much smaller shares o f GDP and thus 
smaller drivers o f growth. A recent revision to the national accounts suggests that GDP grew 7.3 percent 
and 7.9 percent in 2006 and 2007 respectively. The Bank i s reviewing the details o f this revision.

Rwanda has grown more strongly than the average economy i n Africa i n the last five years. 
But there are important reasons f o r concern about recent growth performance. First, growth has 
slowed considerably from the 10.8 percent average achieved in the immediate aftermath o f the genocide 
(see Table 1). Second, with population growth o f about 2.7 percent annually, Rwanda i s facing a growth 
deficit. The economy needs to grow at leas t 8 percent annually to make a significant dent on poverty. 
Finally, the decline in agriculture, which employs 80 percent o f Rwandans, also raises concern about the 
poverty impact o f growth.

Poverty and Inequality 
18. 
According to the 2005/2006 household survey, 56 percent o f Rwandans live below the 
national income poverty line. The average poor Rwandan’s consumption i s about RwF 150 a day 
(about US$0.27), only 2 percent higher than in the 2000/1 household survey. Th i r ty seven percent o f 
Rwandans l ive in extreme poverty and cannot a f ford the m in imum food requirements o f 2,100 kca l a day. 
The poverty gap, defined as the aggregate household income shortfall be low the poverty l i n e i s estimated 
at 19 percent compared w i t h 21 percent in 2000/01. Inequality i s h igh b y international inc lud ing A f r ican 
standards. The G in i coefficient increased from 0.47 to 0.5 1 between the two household surveys. 

19. 
Poverty i s largely a rural-and 
agricultural-phenomenon with ru ra l poverty at 67 
percent. Poverty i s extremely high-91 
percent-in 
families whose ma in source o f income i s 
agricultural wage labor. Poverty levels remain higher in fam i l ies w i t h smaller landholdings and in 
female-headed households. Poverty also appears to be pos i t ive ly correlated w i t h population density. 
These factors suggest that reducing population growth, raising agricultural produc t iv i ty and incomes, and 
d ivers i fy ing sources o f l ive l ihood away f rom agriculture are key factors for reducing poverty. Mo re 
effort i s also needed to ensure that women participate fully in growth. 

20. 
There i s significant regional disparity in poverty. B e tw e e n 2000/01 and 2005/06, poverty f e l l 
strongest in the Eastern Province f rom 61.8 percent to 50.4 percent. In the Southern Province, wh ich i s 
now the poorest part o f the country, poverty increased f rom 65.8 percent to 67.3 percent. On ly m inor 
progress was achieved in the Northern and Western provinces and the C i t y o f K iga l i . The reduction in 
the east can be attributed to greater agricultural growth in that province, due to a combination o f factors: 
(i) larger land holdings; (ii) greater so i l f e r t i l i t y ; and (iii) greater use o f fertilizer. 

21. 
The modest decline i n poverty coupled with population growth o f about 2.7 percent means 
the absolute number o f poor people increased from 4.8 million to about 5.3 million between 2000/01 
and 2005/06. W i th grow th averaging 6.4 percent between the two household surveys, poverty elasticity 
o f growth i s low-about 
-0.4 percent. The relatively small movement in the poverty headcount however 
masks larger declines in the poverty gap. Further analysis o f the poverty data suggests that depending on 
assumptions about changes in income distribution, per capita grow th requirements to halve poverty by 
201 5 are in the range o f 3.5 to 5 percent annually. I f population grow th remains at current levels, this 
wou ld mean overall grow th o f 6.2 percent to 7.7 percent annually. 

22. 
An estimated 52 percent o f households are food insecure o r vulnerable? Food insecurity 
exists a l l over the country bu t tends to be concentrated in the Western and Southern provinces. I t i s also 
highest amongst female-headed households, agricultural laborers and those w i t h “marginal livelihoods” 
including those dependent on social transfers. The agricultural sector contributes s ign i f ican t ly to national 
food security, as more than 90 percent o f a l l food consumed i s domestically produced. Food grain prices 
i n Rwanda have r i s e n over the last two years, although relative to many countries in sub Saharan A fr ica , 
the r i s e has been somewhat muted due to a h igh leve l o f domestic production. This predominance o f 
domestic production imp l ies that produc t iv i ty gains in agriculture have an enormous potential to protect 
from further increases in food prices. Correspondingly, a f a l l in produc t iv i ty poses a serious threat to 
Rwanda‘s food security. Th is i s particularly true as the food impor t gap i s set to grow-at 
a t ime o f h igh 
global food prices-if 
there i s no increase in agricultural productivity.

Child and Maternal Mortality 
23. 
Despite the tremendous progress Rwanda has made on maternal and child mortality, rates 
are still amongst the highest in Africa. 
In fan t and under-five mo r ta l i ty are on ly now at their 1992 
levels. Further progress o n maternal and ch i ld mor ta l i ty rates depend on reforms across various sectors. 
High mo r ta l i ty rates in ch i ldren are l inked to several factors including poor access to safe water, h igh 
f e r t i l i t y , l o w birth-spacing, and l o w nu tr i t iona l status. Accomp l ish ing MDG 4 w i l l require health 
education and bo th cu l tura l and behavioral change, through strengthening o f commun i ty health programs, 
and o f programs fo r nu tr i t ion , sanitation, and water. Ma jo r factors in Rwanda’s high maternal mor ta l i ty 
are poor geographical access to health fac i l i t ies and cu l tura l factors wh ich resu l t in l im i ted use o f pre 
natal services and a l o w l e v e l o f assisted deliveries. In the last f ive years the Government has introduced 
several new po l ic ies in the hea l th sector including increased financing, decentralization o f health services 
delivery; implementation o f performance based financing, scaling up o f mutuelles health insurance and o f 
malaria con tro l programs and improvements in human resources po l ic ies . These measures seem to be 
y ie ld ing fruit in imp rov ing hea l th outcomes. 

III. RWANDA’S MA IN DEVELOPMENT CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUN IT IES 
24. 
The enormity of Rwanda’s development challenge i s summarized in the assessment o f M D G 
achievability in Table 2 above. T o address this challenge, Rwanda needs to make progress in four 
c r i t ica l areas: (i) Econom ic Transformation; (ii) Human Capital and S k i l l s ; (iii) Effectiveness o f the State; 
and ( iv) Peace and Social Cohesion. 

A. Transforming the Economy to Sustain Rapid and Inclusive Growth 
25. 
Rwanda appears to have fully exhausted the growth effects o f its post-conflict 
reconstruction and growth has slowed. The under ly ing constraints t o the economy’s competitiveness 
need to be addressed, thus ac t iva t ing new drivers to sustain rap id and inc lus ive growth, raise incomes and 
reduce income poverty. This requires transformation o f the economy in the fo l low ing interrelated 
dimensions: (i) p roduc t iv i ty o f agriculture; (ii) access to and cost o f economic infrastructure; (iii) private 
sector development 
inc lud ing development o f s k i l l s and competencies o f the workforce; 
(iv) 
d ivers i f ica t ion o f economic activities; and (v) integration in to Eastern and Southern A f r ica . 

Productivity o f Agriculture 
26. 
Agriculture accounts fo r 37 percent o f GDP and has powerful backward and forward 
linkages through related productive activities and through rising ru ra l incomes. But produc t iv i ty in 
the sector i s low , with y ie lds o f several key crops lagging behind other countries, even in sub-Saharan 
A f r ica . K e y constraining features inc lude a b ind ing land constraint w h i c h r u l e s ou t extensification; poor 
water management; sma l l average land holdings (0.3 ha); l ow capacity f r om the d is tr ic t t o the national 
levels; and l im i ted commerc ia l or ien ta t ion due t o poor access to output and f inanc ia l markets. A l l this 
takes place in the context o f a po ten t ia l ly fe r t i le , but challenging, phys ica l environment. Steep terrains 
and the highest popu la t ion density in sub-Saharan A f r ica make good land husbandry a strict necessity and 
an environmental prerogative. 

27. 
Rwanda’s growth challenges can, to a great degree, be met by improvements in agricultural 
productivity. Recent ana ly t ica l work ’ indicates that improvements in sector p roduc t iv i ty cou ld deliver 
grow th o f about 6 percent annua l ly through 2015, wh ich cou ld fue l average annual GDP grow th at about 
the same rate due to the presence o f impor tan t multiplier effects. Ag r icu l tu re i s an important ‘engine o f 
growth’ fo r Rwanda, n o t on ly because o f i t s large impact on GDP in the short and medium-run, but also

because o f i t s con t r ibu t ion t o the trans forma t ion o f the economy in the long - run . W i t h over 80 percent o f 
Rwandans w o r k i n g in agriculture, ra is ing ag r icu l tu ra l incomes i s c r i t i c a l f o r o v e r a l l g r ow t h in ou tpu t and 
emp loymen t . Increased ag r icu l tu ra l p r o d u c t i v i t y raises r u r a l incomes, stimulates demand f o r goods and 
services in other sectors and a l l ow s resources t o transfer f r om ag r icu l tu re t o other sectors. This i s c r i t i c a l 
f o r Rwanda’s econom ic trans forma t ion process. 

Access and Cost o f Infrastructure 
2 8 . 
Access to infrastructure i s limited and costs are prohibitive. In the energy sector, generation 
capacity i s severely constrained at 55 MW and despite the high dens i ty o f popu la t ion , o n l y 4.5 percent o f 
households (90 ,000 customers) have access t o e lec tr ic i ty . Rw a n d a has in recen t years (2004-2006), 
suffered f r om acute e lec t r ic i ty supply shortage and severe l o a d shedding. T h e Gove rnmen t responded by 
renting add i t iona l diesel generation capacity a t high cos t by increas ing t a r i f f s by ove r 100 percent t o 
about U S $ 0 .2UkWh . The curren t t a r i f f levels, compared t o US$ O.lO-O.l2/kWh in the rest o f the region, 
and the p o o r qua l i ty o f supply severely limit the compe t i t iveness o f Rwandan businesses. The supply 
s i tua t ion has imp roved in the las t t w o years due to add i t iona l the rma l genera t ion and be t ter than average 
ra in fa l l , but the coun t ry remains vu lnerab le t o h y d r o l o g i c a l risk and supply d is rup t ions as demonstrated 
during the K e n y a pos t-e lec t ion v io lence ear ly in 2 0 0 8 . 

2 9 . 

The pace o f power sector reform has increased since 2006 but there i s considerable distance 
to go. N e w E l e c t r i c i t y and Gas Laws , that c lea r ly i d e n t i f y the r o l e o f the p r i v a t e sector and the Rwanda

30 . 
Transport costs are as high as US$165/ton/km compared to average o f US$95/ton/km in the 
region and represent about 40 percent o f import and export values. Rwanda i s highly dependent on 
road transport and i t s road n e tw o r k o f 14,000 km, spread over ba re ly 27 ,000 square km o f na t iona l

cost w h i c h i s tw i c e h ighe r than that o f mos t sub-Saharan coun tr ies . A v a i l a b l e datag ind ica te tha t 23

percent o f the 1,100 km paved n e tw o r k requ ires heavy r e h a b i l i t a t i o n o r p e r i o d i c maintenance, and mos t o f 
the secondary and communa l roads have n o t been ma in ta ined f o r over a decade. B e i n g a land locked

I n addition to infrastructure, the emergence o f a modern private sector i n Rwanda i s 
constrained by high regulatory cost burden, weak access to finance, and by a severe labor market

While the performance o f the financial sector has improved considerably as a result o f

Diversification o f the Economy 
36. 
The structure o f Rwanda's economy has been changing slowly since the late 1990s. During 
2001-2006, services con t r ibu ted 44 percent t o G D P compared t o 37 percen t f o r agr icu l ture . 
Industry 
contributes about 14 percent. T o u r i sm has g r ow n r a p i d l y since i t s re - launch in 2002. Howeve r , Rwanda 
continues t o r e l y on t rad i t iona l subsistence agr icu l ture and m i n e r a l c o m m o d i t i e ~ ' ~ w h i c h are subject t o

manufactured goods and traded services, o r i n t o add ing va lue t o p r im a r y produc ts . Tea and co f fee 
accounted f o r over h a l f o f expo r t revenues over the last f i v e years. Rw a n d a also depends h e a v i l y on 
imports, in par t icu lar f u e l impo r ts . 

37. 
This structure and limited diversification makes the economy vulnerable to domestic and 
external shocks including climate change. Con t inued high dependence on t rad i t iona l ra in - fed 
agr icu l ture and the coun try 's geography makes i t highly vu lnerab le t o c l im a t i c changes. In this context,

Faster and more comprehensive regional integration can help Rwanda overcome some o f its 
economic constraints (landlocked location, limited natura l resources and small size o f its economy).

Education and S k i l l s 
40. While significant progress has been made in expanding access to primary education” with 
the introduction of fee-free pr imary education i n 2003, quality has suffered significantly with the 
access shock. Severa l p r o x y ind ica to rs f o r q u a l i t y a t the p r im a r y l e v e l e.g. teacher-pup i l r a t i o (about 1 t o

economy. Less t h a n two - th i rds o f the popu la t ion comp le tes some p r im a r y education, and o n l y 3.5

qua l i f ica t ions and the re fo re have o n l y a l im i t e d chance t o in tegra te success fu l ly i n t o econom ic ac t iv i ty . 

42. 
The absence o f an integrated policy fo r post-basic education which offers students 
knowledge and a range of s k i l l s to enable their successful participation i n the labor market i s a key 
factor in Rwanda’s s k i l l s deficit. Cu r ren t ly mos t pos t-bas ic educa t ion programs b o t h general and

Health, Nutr it ion and Population

Rwanda faces similar health, nutrition and population challenges as other countries i n 
Africa notwithstanding i t s recent progress i n expanding access to health services and controlling 
malaria. One i s t o reduce fu r the r the high rates o f preven tab le deaths and m o r b i d i t y associated with

Population growth remains an important threat to poverty reduction. Rw a n d a has the 
highest popu la t ion density in the region, presen t ing a challenge t o econom ic g r ow t h as w e l l as threa ten ing 
soc ia l cohesion. Even under an op t im is t ic scenario, Rwanda ’s popu la t ion i s expected t o g r ow f r om

any s ign i f ican t impac t on popu la t ion g row th . 

Vulnerable Groups 
45. 
Rwanda’s genocide legacy includes large numbers o f vulnerable groups-widows, orphans, 
disabled persons as well as people with psychological trauma and social strains. A s trong system o f 
soc ia l p ro tec t ion i s needed t o cater f o r these groups and ensure tha t they pa r t ic ipa te in g row th . G i v e n the

capac i ty o f c i v i l society t o h o l d the state accountable. 

State Institutions and Capacity 
47. 
Rwanda emerged from the civil war and genocide with a drastically reduced stock o f 
human capital and government institutions were similarly severely undermined or destroyed. 
While econom ic g r ow t h rebounded qu i te qu ick ly , the human and i n s t i t u t i o n a l damage i s t a k i n g m u c h 
longer t o repair. M o s t m in is t r ies are s t i l l r e l a t i v e l y young . As a result, a numbe r o f systems, processes 
and procedures have n o t been fully put in place and some core func t ions need t o b e be t ter de f ined . 

48. 
I n addition, some o f Rwanda’s civil service reforms could prove t o be counterproductive. 
T h e drastic reduc t ion in p u b l i c sector s ta f f ing has l im i t e d the number o f peop le ava i lab le t o supervise,

Impact o f Ongoing Public Sector Reforms, Final Report.

49. 
Rwanda’s first Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) Assessment was 
completed in 2007. I t shows that while in some areas the public financial management system performs 
strongly in several other areas considerable strengthening i s needed. Rwanda scored better than 
comparable Southern and Western African countries and better than countries in the East African 
Community on several aspects. Challenges are nevertheless considerable. The main areas o f difficulty 
include accounting recording and reporting, and external scrutiny and audit. Reporting at decentralized 
levels, i s particularly weak and a key area o f risk as increasing resources are decentralized to districts and 
lower down. A fully functional integrated financial management system i s yet to be put in place. 
Procurement reforms are considerably advanced: a sound legal framework has been put in place and the 
Rwanda Public Procurement Authority (RPPA) created to regulate and oversee public procurement. A 
comprehensive procurement training plan has been adopted and i s being implemented. But more 
challenges remain to be addressed including adequately funding and staffing the RPPA to become fully 
operational, training a critical mass o f public sector staff in procurement procedures, preparing 
procurement manuals for contracting entities and widely disseminating the provisions o f the procurement 
law and regulations to the public. A Code o f Ethics for participants and provision fo r disclosure fo r those 
in decision making positions i s also being prepared (Annex 9 provides a more detailed discussion o f 
fiduciary management). 

Control o f Corruption 
50. 
Rwanda i s widely recognized f o r low levels o f corruption compared t o the region and the 
rest o f sub-Saharan A f r i ~ a . ’ ~ Strong political commitment to the fight against corruption i s evident in 
vigorous prosecution o f corruption cases and tough measures against proven cases. Within the past five 
years, several government officials in leadership positions, a s i g n i f i c a n t number o f persons in the 
judiciary and local government employees have been dismissed. The Ombudsman Office effectively 
coordinates the annual exercise o f assets declaration by public o f f ic ia ls and other s t a f f involved in the 
management o f public funds. Together with the O f i c e o f the Auditor General, they expose corrupt 
behaviors and make recommendations fo r action by the Prosecutor General. Following the new 
Constitution in 2003, the judicial sector was reformed to give independence to the Prosecution Office. 
Consequently, this office with the help o f other institutions like the Na t iona l Police i s able to 
independently and systematically prosecute a l l cases o f misappropriation o f public funds. Rwanda’s good 
standing i s also confirmed by i t s 2007 CPIA scores on dimensions such as Quality o f Budgetary and 
Financial Management (4.0), and Transparency, Accountability and Corruption in the Public Sector (3.5; 
compared to the ID A Borrowers’ average o f 2.9).

Vo ice and Capacity of C iv i l Society 
The number o f civil society organizations (CSOs) in Rwanda has grown rapidly since 2000. 
Currently, there are an estimated 37,688 CSOs in the country with close to 90 percent in the form o f 
community based organizations. CSOs are distributed across the country fairly uniformly and form the 
basis o f an emerging c i v i l society. These organizations largely confine themselves to philanthropic work 
and small income generating activities. Very few engage in any meaningful way in policy discourse or 
engage in political debate. Progress i s needed on two fronts: (i) to strengthen the environment for CSO 
engagement with the state including access to information on government policies and programs; and (ii) 
to strengthen the capacity o f CSOs to engage in policy formulation processes. 

D. Promoting Peace and Social Cohesion 
52. 
The challenge o f building lasting social cohesion i s daunting given Rwanda’s history. A 
fundamental part o f Government e f fo r ts in this regard i s to downplay ethnic differences and create one 

2005 Rwanda African Peer Review Mechanism states “globally and domestically, Rwanda i s perceived as having a low level 
o f corruption”.

Traditional mechanisms such as the “umuganda”, the “ilorero”, the “ubunzf’21 etc. are 
being used to help communities rebuild and create social capital. The p rog ram t o reintegrate ex-

N. RWANDA ’S LONG TERM VISION A N D MEDIUM TERM PRIORITIES 

A. Vision 2020 and EDPRS 
54 . 
Rwanda’s long term development vision i s articulated in the Rwanda Vision 2020 
document. The v i s i o n sees Rwanda as a lowe r m i d d l e income economy (US$900 pe r capita) opera t ing 
as a knowledge-based serv ice hub by 2020 . It seeks t o achieve this in an equ i tab le w a y and as a s trong 
and un i ted nation. T h e v i s i o n i s built around six p i l la rs : (i) good governance and a capable state; (ii) 
human resource deve lopmen t and a knowledge-based economy; (iii) a p r iva te sec tor- led economy; (iv) 
in fras truc ture development; (v) p roduc t ive and marke t-or ien ted agr icu l ture ; and (vi) reg iona l and 
in terna t iona l econom ic in tegra t ion . I t also emphasizes the impo r tance o f progress on f o u r cross-cu t t ing 
issues: (i) gender equa l i ty ; (ii) na tu ra l resources; (iii) the env ironmen t ; and (iv) science, techno logy and 
I C T . The V i s i o n 2020 ob jec t ives are fu l ly in l i n e with the MDGs but m o r e amb i t ious . 

5 5 . 

The Economic Development and Poverty Reduction Strategy (EDPRS), Rwanda’s second 
generation PRSP, provides the medium-term framework for achieving the country’s long term 
development aspirations. I t ar t icu la tes the coun t ry ’s p r i o r i t i e s f o r 2008-20 12. W h i l e the f i r s t PRSP 
focused on manag ing a t rans i t iona l p e r i o d o f rehab i l i ta t ion and recons truc t ion , t h e EDPRS focuses 
s trong ly on g row th . A m o n g i t s k e y targets are: (i) g r ow t h o f abou t 8 percen t annua l ly ; and (ii) reduc t ion 
in pove r ty t o 46 percent. The strategy also makes the case f o r conso l ida t ing and ex tend ing the 
decen tra l iza t ion o f p u b l i c spend ing accompanied by robus t accoun tab i l i ty mechanisms a t the 
decentralized levels, and f o r reg iona l and in te rna t iona l econom ic in tegra t ion . T h e EDPRS seeks 
co l labo ra t ion with Rwanda ’s reg iona l ne ighbors in the deve lopmen t o f econom ic in f ras t ruc tu re and high- 
leve l s k i l l s in the services, hea l th and education sectors. The EDPRS priorities are articulated through 
three flagship programs: Sustainable Growth for Jobs and Exports; Vision 2020 Umurenge; and 
Governance. 

56 . 

Flagship one (growth) supports policy and investment interventions to: (i) develop s k i l l s and 
capacity fo r productive employment; (ii) improve economic infrastructure especially transport, 

2o Un l ike in the pre-genocide period, reference i s no longer made to ethnic or ig in in individual identification documents and not 
used as the basis for access to key social services. 
Umuganda refers t o residents o f neighborhoods coming together once a month for communal work to clean and beautify their 
neighborhoods; ;ubunz i re fe rs to traditional mediators; while the i to re ro refers to a traditional leadership training school.

subsistence ag r icu l tu re towa rds an increase in comme rc ia l agr icu l ture , as w e l l as manu fac tu r ing and 
services. 

5 7 . 

Flagship two (Vision 2020 Umurenge) focuses on ensuring shared growth and on creation o f 

opportunities fo r the poorest Rwandans. I t has three componen ts ( p u b l i c works , c red i t packages, and 
d i rec t supports) tha t i n v o l v e f o u r comp lemen tary elements: (i) a g r i c u l t u r a l p r o d u c t i v i t y imp rovemen t f o r 
households with land; (ii) p u b l i c l y funded, soc ia l ly produc t ive , labor- in tens ive emp loymen t f o r landless

im p r o v e d access t o c red i t f o r input purchases o r m icro-en terpr ise deve lopmen t by members o f households 
assisted t h r o u g h elements (ixiii). 

5 8 . 
Flagship three (Governance) seeks 
to strengthen political governance, economic 
governance, and build institutions and capacity o f the state. Emphas is i s g i v e n t o m a i n t a i n i n g peace 

and security, p r om o t i n g peace and r e c o n c i l i a t i o n amongst Rwandans, r e f o rm i n g the jus t ice system t o

5 9 . 

I n addition to these three flagships, the EDPRS also seeks to consolidate gains achieved 
under the PRSP I in health, water and basic education. In h e a l t h the ob jec t ives are t o m a x im i z e 

p reven t ive h e a l t h measures and build capac i ty t o ex tend q u a l i t y bas ic hea l th services t o the m a j o r i t y o f

B. Economic Outlook over the CAS Period 
60. 
The external environment has become less favorable, posing increasing challenges for most 

economies in Africa including Rwanda. T h e g l o b a l economy i s s l ow i n g down , c omm o d i t y p r ices have 
genera l ly r i s e n with o i l p r ices reach ing reco rd -h igh levels, and g l o b a l f i n a n c i a l marke ts are unsettled. 
Howeve r , i f Rwanda i s ab le t o s t rong ly im p l em e n t i t s proposed r e f o rm and inves tmen t p rog ram 
a r t icu la ted in the EDPRS , the adverse e f fec ts o f the ex terna l env i ronmen t o n g r ow t h and o ther 
mac roeconom ic balances c o u l d be m i t iga ted . 

61. 

Other factors w i l l help mitigate adverse growth effects. F r o m a broader perspective, the 

gradua l b roaden ing o f t h e c omm o d i t y p r i c e b o om f r o m o i l t o me ta ls has he lped Rwanda o f fse t the 
adverse e f fec ts o f h i g h e r o i l pr ices t h r o u g h h i g h e r p r ices o n i t s ne t c omm o d i t y expor ts . In t h e las t f e w 
years, m inera ls , me ta ls and chem ica ls have become p redom inan t in Rwanda ’s expor t mix. These 
favorab le n o n - o i l c omm o d i t y re la ted terms o f trade have con t r ibu ted t o g r ow t h in expor t revenues. In 
addition, l i k e mos t A f r i c a n coun tr ies with nascent f i n a n c i a l markets, Rwanda has so fa r s h ow n and i s 

14 

expected t o con t inue show ing l im i t e d reac t ion t o con t inu ing turbu lence in g l o b a l f inanc ia l markets. 
Therefore, the risk o f a reversa l o f p o r t f o l i o flows, w h i c h w o u l d reduce ex te rna l f i n a n c i n g and hurt 
g r ow t h in countries tha t are h e a v i l y re l ian t o n f inanc ia l markets, i s i n s i g n i f i c a n t in Rwanda . 

62. 
Rwanda’s economic outlook over the CAS period can therefore be expected to remain 
favourable if GoR implements successfully the medium-term policy agenda as outlined in the 
EDPRS. This w o u l d coun ter the apparent downwa rd t rend in grow th , r a i s i n g annua l g r ow t h f r om the 
average o f 4.8 percent during 2003-07 t o about 6 percent over the p e r i o d 2009-11 . This assumes the 
s low -down in the g loba l economy persists, and i s therefore a l ow e r b o u n d es t ima ted p r o j e c t i o n o f g row th . 
P re l im ina ry data f o r f i r s t h a l f o f 2008 show that g r ow t h across services and industry has rema ined 
buoyant. A g r i c u l t u r e i s also exper ienc ing a recovery due t o recent successful in tens i f ica t ion e f for ts . 

63. 
Assuming an incremental capital output ratio o f around 4, based on historical trends, the 
projected annual GDP growth o f 6 percent would be achieved through increased public and private 
sector investment, including measures to modernize agriculture and address infrastructure 
bottlenecks. R e f l e c t i n g the s trong emphasis that G oR i s p l a c i n g o n p u b l i c in f ras t ruc tu re investment, 
ove ra l l investment rates are p ro jec ted t o r i s e f a i r l y s tead i ly f r om abou t 20 percen t o f G D P in 2006, t o 
about 2 4 percent o f GDP by the end o f the C A S pe r iod (see Tab le 3). P u b l i c inves tmen t w i l l increase 
f r om 9.8 percent in 2008 t o close t o 11 percent o f G D P by the end o f the CAS p e r i o d With the p r iva te 
sector’s engagement in the soc ia l sectors and also in in fras truc ture expec ted t o b e strengthened, p r iva te 
investment w o u l d also t rend u pw a r d gradua l ly beg inn ing 2008, t o abou t 13.4 percen t o f G D P per year, in 
the med ium- term . T h e higher inves tmen t levels w o u l d also be comp lemen ted by o ther less cap i ta l 
in tens ive investment t o opera t iona l ize the recen t ly comp le ted s k i l l s , science and techno logy strategy.

Higher rates o f GDP growth as projected (in the range o f 6 percent):’ would in turn, allow 
fo r a strong recovery in private consumption, raising per capita consumption to about US$435 by 
2011, up from U S 3 2 0 i n 2007. The s trong g r ow t h per formance w o u l d also have s ign i f ican t impac t o n 
emp loymen t prospects. T h e greatest gains f o r Rwandans w o u l d l i k e l y come f r o m the s trong g r ow t h in 
cons truc t ion and the service sector coup led with increased p u b l i c spend ing o n in f ras t ruc tu re projects, 
i n c l u d i n g o n rehab i l i ta t ion and maintenance. 

65. 
I n line with the need f o r increased investment to accelerate and sustain growth, government 
capital spending would increase strongly over the medium term, causing the overall fiscal balance 
to remain in deficit. T h e d e f i c i t ( i n c l u d i n g grants) w o u l d w i d e n t o abou t 4 pe rcen t o f G D P by 201 1, up 
sharply f r om under 1.5 percen t in 2007 . Par t o f this increase w o u l d b e due t o h i g h e r inves tmen t , but the

22 Growth i s expected from agriculture stemming from increased use o f inputs, including fertilizer, industry, including 
construction and service sectors with links to the construction phase o f projects, including transportation.

66. 
The external current account deficit would also widen considerably from about 5 percent o f 
GDP (including grants) i n 2007, to about 12 percent o f GDP (including grants) by 2011. S trong 

im p o r t g r ow t h s temm ing f r o m h i g h e r cap i ta l impo r ts associated with the expand ing p u b l i c investment

V. WORLD BANK GROUP ASSISTANCE STRATEGY 

6 8 . 

A. Lessons from Implementing the Last CAS 
The recent CAS Completion Report (CASCR) concluded that performance under the last 

CAS was satisfactory. Rwanda made substantial progress in the area o f structural reform particularly in 
public finance management, the f i n a n c i a l sector, business environment, and ICT. The Bank’s support to 
basic services in health, education, HIV/AIDS, water and sanitation has delivered considerable results on 
the ground. In addition the Bank’s assistance in the community driven development program to build 
capacity at the loca l level has been impressive. However, progress has been slow in: (i) improving 
agriculture productivity and growth; (ii) restructuring key s ta te enterprise in tea, telecom and energy 
sectors; and (iii) building institutional capacity in the public sector. Furthermore, improving capacity and 
services in urban infrastructure has been slower than anticipated. The Bank strategy w i l l incorporate the 
following key lessons learned from the implementation o f the previous CAS and ISN: 

e 

e 

e 

The introduction of budget support operations under the PRSG series provided an important forum 
for policy dialogue and significantly improved donor harmonization and strengthened cross 

sectoral linkages. The Bank needs to work closely with other donors in fostering harmonization and 
alignment agenda. Comparative advantage and selectivity need to be key criteria in the future 
strategy where the Bank can provide leadership during the implementation o f EDPRS. 

Future programs need to be appropriately designed to reflect local capacity constraints and be 

more results-focused Support should be provided to design and sequence reforms in line with 
capacity constraints to achieve the best outcomes. The CAS objectives and outcomes should focus on 
results that are achievable during the CAS period given the capacity constraint and IDA resource 
envelope. 

The future program should have a strong results framework. The absence o f a results-based CAS 

framework at the project design level limited the reliability o f the Monitoring & Evaluation (M&E) 
system. 

B. 
The Current World Bank Group Program 
6 9 . 
The I D A portfolio in Rwanda consists o f 11 active projects and the PRSG (general budget 
support) operation with a total (gross) commitment o f about US$363 million. Approximately 

US$115 million remains to be disbursed. Annex 20 provides an overview o f the current portfolio. In 
addition to the annual PRSG, there are major investment lending operations in agriculture, capacity 
building, HIV/AIDS, urban development,, electricity and transport. Rwanda i s also participating in three 
regional projects.24 S ince FY04, much o f the support has been provided to soc ia l sectors and for public 
administration, accounting for about 40 percent and 3 5 percent o f new commitments (excluding budget 
support), respectively. In the last few years, the portfolio has performed well and delivered strong results 
in areas such as general budget support, rural water and HIV/AIDs. There are no problem projects. 

70 . 

The International Finance Corporation’s (WC) ongoing operations in Rwanda focus on: (i) 

improving the investment climate; (ii) building the capacity o f S M E s as well as micro enterprises; and 
(iii) proactively supporting development o f projects with high impact in the financial, tourism, 
agribusiness, and infrastructure sectors. The ongoing investment program includes: (i) expansion o f 
Intraspeed SA Rwanda Ltd (ISARL), a freight and forwarding company operating in the Great Lakes 
Region o f Eastern Africa; (ii) post- privatization financing o f two leading hotels privatized by GoR; (iii) 
processing o f a risk-sharing facility with the Banque Rwandaise de De‘veloppement (BRD ) to finance 

24 The include the HIV/AIDS Great Lakes Initiative; the East Africa Trade and Transport Facilitation; and the Africa 
Trade Facilitation Project.

private schools in Rwanda; (iv) trade finance facility to the Bunque Commerciule du Rwanda (BCR) BCR 
and exploring providing AMSME to local banks; (v) IFC has commenced work on a housing finance and 
techn ica l assistance program in collaboration with GoR; (vii) IFC trust funds have supported the pilot 
plant o f Lake K ivu methane gas now close to operational; and (viii) IFC recently approved up to US$4 
million to invest in t h e development o f a gas methane power project in Rwanda. 

7 1. 
I F C has been providing advice on privatization and entrepreneurship initiatives including 
advising GoR on the privatization o f Rwanda Air. IFC’s Private Enterprise Partnership fo r Africa (PEP- 
Africa) i s currently implementing tw o technical assistance programs, the Rwanda Leasing Program ( U P ) 
and the Rwanda Entrepreneurship Development Program (REDP), both designed to support SMEs. 
REDP w i l l enhance entrepreneurship, support the growth and competitiveness o f the S M E Sector and 
improve the business environment. The program design and funding arrangements have been finalized. 
IFC has just completed a Gender Entrepreneurship Markets study. 

72. 
M I G A i s increasingly engaging i n Rwanda. I t s f i r s t guarantee, signed in April 2008, secured 
an investment in the microfinance sector, further to recent increase in the minimum capital requirements. 
M IGA i s currently underwriting two further investments in the financial sector that are likely to be signed 
in the second quarter o f FY 09. These investments r e f l e c t an increased willingness by fore ign investors to 
engage in Rwanda with the support o f a World Bank Group guarantee. 

C. The Program o f Support FYO9-12 
73. 
The CAS seeks pr imar i ly to contribute to the EDPRS objective o f significantly raising 
growth and creating jobs. A secondary objective i s to consolidate specific elements o f Rwanda’s recen t 
soc ia l progress by tackling selected aspects o f social vulnerability. The strategy seeks to use t h e World 
Bank Group (WBG) resources more selectively for greater impact and respects Government preferences 
fo r WBG support in strategic growth sectors. The CAS i s also about new ways o f working that w i l l 
enhance the effectiveness o f WBG assistance. 

74. 

The CAS i s framed around two strategic themes and five CAS outcomes (see Table 5): 

CAS strategic theme one: Promote economic transformation and growth. The primary objective 
o f the CAS i s to help Rwanda make progress on activating new drivers o f growth that can be 
sustained over time. The substantial part o f the financial envelope over the period w i l l therefore 
support the EDPRS Flagship on Growth and focus on four key outcomes: (i) agricultural production; 
(ii) access and quality o f infrastructure services; (iii) private sector development; and (iv) capacity to 
manage public resources. 
CAS strategic theme two: Reduce social vulnerability. A secondary objective i s to ensure that the 
most vulnerable Rwandans also benefit from growth and to help Rwanda make further progress i n 
building a more stable society. A smaller program w i l l support the Flagship Vision 2020 Umurenge 
initiative; help Rwanda get on track on child and maternal mortality goals; and promote peace and 
social cohesion through demobilization and reintegration. 

75. 
Given Rwanda’s capacity challenge, the new program w i l l seek to mainstream assistance to 
capacity across a l l interventions. This w i l l be done through applying a Capacity Building Filter (see 
paras 1 17- 1 19 and Annex 4).

Guiding Principles o f Bank Support 
Alignment w ith the EDPRS . The CAS supports implementation o f Rwanda’s four year 
medium-term development framework. The results framework i s directly aligned with development 
outcomes derived from the EDPRS. The support program has been discussed with government, donors, 
private sector, and civil society during CAS consultations in February, Ap r i l and June 2008. 

7 7 . 

Selectivity fo r greater impact. The CAS focuses Bank engagement on targeted EDPRS areas, 
primarily growth and selected social areas. 
I t supports mainly progress on MDGs 1 on poverty and 
hunger; as well as MDG 4 on child mortality; and MDG 5 on maternal mortality. This selectivity i s based 
on GoR’s preferences fo r Rwanda’s engagement with the Bank. The GoR exercises a strong lead in 
donor coordination and has begun to work with donors on a c learer division o f labour by identifying areas 
o f individual donor comparative advantage. In this context GoR has requested the Bank to give priority 
to the areas targeted under the CAS. This focus i s also justified s ince these goals pose the greatest 
challenge for Rwanda and are areas in which limited WBG resources can add most value. 

7 8 . 

The new program w i l l significantly reduce areas where the WBG provides financial support 
to Rwanda. Specific areas where no new IDA financing i s envisaged include: (i) primary education; (ii) 
water and sanitation; ( i i i ) HIV/AlDS; (iv) urban management/development; and (v) public service reform. 
In primary education, the Government intends to make greater use o f the Education fo r all Fast Track 
Initiative (EFA FTI) as well as additional support from bilateral donors including new entrants into the 
sector (e.g. Canada). Similarly the support to HIV/AIDS w i l l continue largely through the Global Fund to 
fight Aids, Tuberculosis and Ma la r ia as well as through the United States President’s Emergency Plan fo r 
AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). The A fDB w i l l continue to lead donor support for water and sanitation and the 
move towards a SWAP could help catalyze additional donor resources. Anticipated support from the 
Chinese Government for road investments in Kigali and Belgian support to general urban management 
issues in Kigali w i l l carry forward some elements o f the urban development agenda while some o f the 
policy reform elements w i l l be taken on in the PRSG ser ies . As regards public service reforms, the World 
Bank and the United Kingdom’s Department for International Development (DflD) are working with 
Government to prioritize the implementation of critical system wide reforms which w i l l create conditions 
for further public service capacity strengthening through the Capacity Building Filter. 

7 9 . 

Financial support i s also more targeted w ith in the areas o f intervention. 
For example 
support to soc ia l protection i s targeted to public works and direct assistance and the health program 
focuses on community health targeting child and maternal health risks. This shift in the strategy w i l l 
become more evident as several ongoing operations come to an end. Annex 2 explains in more detail the 
enhanced selectivity in the new program and Annexes 6 and 7 provide more details on Rwanda’s aid 

19 

environment and a mapping of donor areas o f responsibility. 

80. 
Alongside selectivity i n our financial assistance, the strategy recognizes the Bank’s 
considerable comparative advantage in analytical and advisory activities and aims at providing 
enough flexibility to respond to Government demand for such support even in areas where the 
Bank may not be providing financial assistance. This primarily includes areas where: (i) the institution 
as a whole has considerable experience; (ii) no other donors are providing such support; and ( i i i ) our 
support would lead to clear policy and/or implementation outcomes. A key example i s in basic education 
where although new I D A financing i s not envisaged, the Bank w i l l continue to be the administrator o f the 
EFA FT I Catalytic Fund grant and w i l l remain engaged in policy dialogue with government on basic 
education objectives. In this regard, the Bank w i l l provide key ana ly t ica l inputs for the continuing 
evolution o f the government’s basic education strategy as well as the evaluation o f the impact o f different 
teacher recruitment and incentive polices. 

81. 
Donor Harmonization. The CAS actively seeks synergies with other donors and strives fo r 
increased donor harmonization. A mapping o f donors’ activities in various sectors i s provided (Annex 6). 

I D A Resources 
82. 
I D A availability. The CAS covers the period FYOPFY12, which includes the IDA15 
replenishment period (FY09-11) and the first year o f IDA16. The indicative resource envelope for 
Rwanda under I D A 15 i s larger on a per annum basis than resources available fo r similar performance 
during IDA14, due mainly to the larger size o f the IDA15 envelope.25 The indicative total resource 
a l loca t ion during IDA15 i s SDR255.9 million (US$417 million 
comprising a firm 
allocation o f SDR81.8 million for FY09 and an indicative amount o f SDR174 million during FY10- 
F Y I 1. The indicative amount for FY12 i s SDR88.2 million (US$144 million), but the ac tua l amount w i l l 
depend on available resources during IDA16. Therefore for the en t i re CAS period (FY09-FY12) the 
indicative IDA allocation to ta ls SDR344 million (US$56 1 m i l l ion equivalent). Actual allocations during 
the CAS period w i l l be determined on an annual basis and w i l l depend on: (i) total IDA resources 
available; (ii) Rwanda’s performance rating relative to that o f other IDA borrowers; (iii) financing terms 
(credits or grants); and (iv) number o f IDA-eligible countries. 

83 . 
The Government has expressed an interest in being reclassified from a red light to a yellow 
light country to enable access t o greater I D A allocations as well to other sources o f concessional 
financing.*’ The most recen t Debt Sustainability Analysis (see Annex 5) suggests that Rwanda i s s t i l l at 
a high risk o f debt distress, which does not support a change in Rwanda’s debt sustainability c lass i f ica t ion 
at this time. However, for selected high r e t u r n investments, borrowing on concessional terms including 
terms less favorable than in the program with the IMF could s t i l l be consistent with external debt 
sustainability. This has recently been demonstrated fo r the Nyabarongo Hydropower project which i s 
partly financed through a concessional loan o f U S $ 97.7 m i l l ion (40 percent concessionality compared to 
50 percent required in t h e program with the IMF)28. The project should improve Rwanda’s external 
position, by reducing dependence on thermal energy generated from expensive imported foss i l fuel. 

” Estimates for IDA15 (and first year o f IDA16) are based on Rwanda’s performance i n FY08, per capita income, population 
and the s ize o f the IDA15 replenishment. 
26 Based on an exchange rate o f SDR=US$I .63 on July 3 1,2008. The actual dollar amounts w i l l depend on the exchange rate at 
the time o f commitments. 
” Concessional financing from sources such as Japan require Rwanda to be classified as eligible for a mixture o f grants and 
concessional ID A credits.

CAS Instruments 
84. 
I n line with Rwanda’s aid policy and the country’s good performance, the Bank w i l l further 
increase the use o f development policy lending (DPL). The ongoing annual PRSG (budget support) 
w i l l remain the main DPL instrument. The Government i s strongly committed to the EDPRS reform 
program that underpins the PRSG and the budget i s well aligned with the EDPRS. Wha t i s needed to 
ensure fu l l success i s strengthened capacity to design reforms and programs, to implement them 
effectively, to monitor their impact and feed results into further policy and program refinements. Greater 
attention w i l l be given to building this capacity. In addition to implementation o f the Capacity Building 
filter, the ongoing Public Sector Capacity Building Project and the Decentralization and Community 
Development Project w i l l support capacity needs at central and decentralized levels respectively. The 
program w i l l also continue to use the Japanese funded PHRD facility to f inance some o f the capacity 
needed for PRSG implementation. The Bank w i l l continue to use the opportunity provided by the regular 
Joint Budget Reviews between Government and budget support donors to ensure that the budget remains 
strongly aligned to the EDPRS objectives. Investment lending w i l l be used less than i n the past and 
primarily fo r delivering large infrastructure including regional programs i n addition to areas 
where I D A financing w i l l help to leverage additional resources.

New Ways o f Doing Business 
The CAS incorporates new ways of doing business that should enhance W B G effectiveness 
and impact. The first i s to increase use o f country systems. This should strengthen Rwandan 

ownership o f our support as well as help build capacity within Government to manage development 
programs. Strong emphasis w i l l therefore be placed on wo rk ing with Government to create the conditions 
fo r greater use o f country systems through ongoing support t o procurement and P F M reforms wh i le also 
recognizing the importance o f ear ly p i lo ts to create in i t ia l success and draw lessons to guide scaling up. 
A key element o f the strategy w i l l be to commence the in i t ia l assessments o f the country systems in 
procurement as defined and explained in the Board approved paper on the Use of Country Procurement 

Systems in Bank-Supported Operat ions: Proposed P i lot ing P rog r am with a v iew to implementing the 

proposed Rwanda p i l o t on use o f na t iona l systems for procurement in a selected project. Wo rk i s also 
ongoing to strengthen the capacity o f the Aud i to r General’s O f f ice to gradually take over the external 
audit func t ion on a l l Bank f inanced operations. 

87 . 

Given the Government’s preference f o r budget support, the CAS w i l l accommodate 
increasing use o f our T A and M A services to help Government design and refine specific Rwandan 

programs and in i t ia t ives that cou ld be funded through the national budget rather than for the preparation 
o f specific stand alone Bank financed operations. This new way o f wo rk ing w i l l mean that AAA and TA 
services may no t necessarily support stand alone Bank funded operation. 

88 . 

The CAS w i l l use Trust Fund resources more aggressively to strengthen partnerships and 
complement I D A resources for impact. In add i t ion to existing Trust Funds, new Funds that w i l l be 

tapped include the No rweg ian Hea l th Results Innova t ion Fac i l i ty ; Statistics f o r Results In i t ia t ive ; the 
Joint Governance Partnership Fac i l i ty between the Wo r ld Bank, DfID, and the Netherlands and the 
G loba l Fac i l i ty fo r Disaster Reduc t ion and Recovery (GFDRR). These new fac i l i t ies w i l l contribute to 
fund ing o f operations as well as t o AAA and TA programs. 

8 9 . 

The CAS w i l l reduce proliferation of activities and seek appropriate consolidation o f tasks 
to allow better funding of individual operations both at preparation and supervision stages. This 

w i l l require continued e f fo r t t o w o r k e f fec t ive ly across sectoral silos and recogn i t ion o f ind iv idua l 
contributions to team tasks.

As the lead donor i n energy and the co-chair o f the energy sector cluster, the Bank w i l l 
continue to support major reforms through ongoing policy dialogue and technical assistance. IDA 
w i l l continue to support reform o f the energy sector through the policy dialogue under both the PRSG 
series and investment lending operations. This agenda includes further strengthening o f technical and 
financial efficiency o f the power utility, Electrogaz, as well as capacity strengthening o f the newly created 
utility regulator, RURA. One focus o f the dialogue w i l l be on making progress on an energy sector 
SWApfocused on access expansion-which 
i s expected to be in place before the end o f calendar year 
2008 . As part o f the access program, IDA i s facilitating twining between Electrogaz and the Tunisian 
Utility STEG to enable Rwanda to benefit from the Tunisian experience in planning and executing a 
national access program. 

9 9 . 
I n transport, the focus w i l l be on effective implementation o f the ongoing Transport Sector 
Development Project (TSDP) and ongoing and planned regional projects. The TSDP which i s co- 
funded by an IDA grant, an Africa Catalytic Growth Fund (ACGF) grant and the GoR through its Road 
Maintenance Fund, contributes to improving the quality o f key international and domestic road corridors 
as part o f a wider strategy to improve regional connectivity. Additional resources w i l l be required over 
the CAS period to fund cost increases on the project from inflationary effects o f recent events in Kenya 
and also from some changes in the road design. The ongoing urban infrastructure and city management 
aims to increase access to priority urban infrastructure in Kigali and two secondary cities (Ruhengeri and 
Butare). Ongoing regional projects include the East Africa Trade and Transport Facilitation project. 
Rwanda w i l l also participate in the East Africa Road Network project (FYlO), which w i l l link road 
networks in Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, Ethiopia and potentially Southern Sudan. 
Financing fo r rural roads w i l l complement support to improved productivity in agriculture and rural 
development (see above). These investments w i l l be implemented using approaches that create 
employment, particularly for unemployed youth. 

100. The Bank w i l l work w ith other donors i n the sector such as the EU and the A fDB and 
within the W B G t o explore synergies. IDA and IFC w i l l work jointly and closely with the AfDB and 
other Governments in the region t o explore the feasibility o f a regional railways project that w i l l link 
Tanzania, Burundi and Rwanda. Achievement o f this railway w i l l facilitate Rwanda’s integration in the 
region, reduce its transport costs significantly and be an important building block in its efforts to become 
a regional trade and services hub. M IGA i s willing to consider supporting such regional integration 
projects that would either benefit from a more regional approach (e.g. COMESA) and/or through direct 
private investments in a specific section o f the r a i l link. 

101. Support to the I C T sector w i l l focus on strengthening the enabling environment, and 
improving both domestic and international connectivity to lower the barrier for investment by 
operators to extend broadband access geographic coverage. This support w i l l be provided primarily 
through the ongoing E-Rwanda Project for eGovernment applications and services and through Rwanda’s 
participation in the second phase o f the Regional ICT Project (RCIP) planned fo r early FY09. IDA ’S 
support w i l l complement the US$40 million investment being pledged by the Government for the ICT 
sector as well as the current efforts led by RURA under the Universal Service Fund initiative.

CAS Outcome 1.3: Improved environment for private sector development 

102. Support to improve the environment fo r private sector development w i l l target s k i l l s 
including entrepreneurial s k i l l s , the business regulatory environment, and the financial sector. 
IDA, IFC (including FIAS) and M IGA w i l l seek additional opportunities to further strengthen our 
ongoing joint work in these areas. 

103. A highlight o f the program w i l l be an initiative to promote entrepreneurial s k i l l s while 
promoting investments through catalytic interventions. The driving premise i s that the private sector 
engages in entrepreneurship when the project development risks are clearer, which leads to the design o f 
more robust risk mitigation, and in turn to enhanced investment in commercial ventures. Correlatively, 
the set-up o f an IDA-funded Project Development Fund (PDF) w i l l help identify credible investment 
opportunities grounded on prospects o f products and market development. The PDF w i l l catalyze 
entrepreneurship by highlighting direct investment opportunities for the private sector. I t w i l l finance the 
sequence o f a l l activities required to develop bankable business plans for specific investments and operate 
on a demand-driven basis. 

104. 
The integration o f IDA , I F C and M I G A instruments and interventions w i l l be critical to 
ensure the impact o f a PDF . I t can be expected that IFC would, f i r s t , play a catalytic ro le as an investor, 
and that i t s participation in private enterprises in addition to public-private-partnerships (PPP) would help 
leverage more private investors as well as loca l banks. Second, to ensure the sustainability o f newly 
created enterprises, techn ica l assistance under the IFC’s Private Enterprise Partnership (PEP) for Africa 
could be leveraged to consolidate enterprise development. In the same way, newly created enterprises 
could also access matching grants to finance costs incurred by recourse to external service providers for 
products and markets development and/or fo r other enterprise development activities. In cases where the 
Government w i l l need to support enterprise development through PPP, the Government’s interventions 
would be supported by a relevant PPP Framework which w i l l be based on c lea r government entry and exit 
scenarios and code o f conduct. 

105. 
The program w i l l also focus on the development o f a M in imum Integrated Trade Expansion 
Platform (MITEP) financed through PRSG V I to foster trade i n Rwanda. MITEP w i l l support 
enterprise development through sustainable development o f new products and new markets. I t w i l l build 
a permanent “soft” 
infrastructure to: (i) help investors identify direct resource transformation 
opportunities. (ii) help enterprises comply with quality requirement and other standards in order to adapt 
and develop products that w i l l overcome technical barriers to trade (TBT); (iii) support the expansion o f 
the market o f specialized business development services which w i l l aim at building and accessing the 
skills sets required for the private sector to effectively identify and develop trade opportunities; (iv) 
rationalize and integrate the overall delivery o f mezzo level policy advocacy and enterprisekrade support 
services. To support the economic transformation, MITEP, combined with the PDF, w i l l be designed to 
target sectors with growth potential (including agriculture). Much o f this support w i l l be provided through 
a TA program to support program design with implementation through the GoR budget. 

106. Beyond entrepreneurial s k i l l s , the Bank w i l l increasingly focus on s k i l l s development t o 
meet the needs o f the labor market (see above). T h i s w i l l consist o f a two-prong approach. First, 
building on the findings o f the recent AAA on STI, the Bank w i l l work with Government to design a 
small program to build skills and capacity in the private sector to bring Science and Technology 
innovations t o different areas o f economic activity. Second, we w i l l promote a broad strategic 
perspective to address short, medium and long-term skills-formation by adopting a systemic approach to 
post-basic education, with a comprehensive view o f general secondary, TVET and higher education. This 
w i l l take into account the transversal s k i l l s set needed to be able to adapt to the changing demands of 
sophisticated labor markets and consequently the blurring between the th ree parts o f the post-basic 

26 

education system. This integrative approach also implies that focusing on solely one part o f the system 
(such as TVET) without the overall strategy being in place could eventually create limitations for further 
human capital development. Support for preparation o f this strategy w i l l be provided through the 
Education Policy Analysis. The strategy i s expected to be completed in F Y 2010 and a skills 
development project i s expected to follow in FY 2012. The Bank w i l l also continue to administer the 
Education For A l l Fast-Track Initiative Catalytic Fund grant (see below). 

107. 
Investment climate reforms remain a priority in the proposed program. I D A and IFC /F IAS 
are collaborating through the I D A Competitiveness and Enterprise Development P ro j e c t (CEDP) 
and the recently approved I F C Rwanda Investment Climate Reform Advisory Project, particularly 
on commercial law reform, capacity building activities o f Rwanda Investment Promotion Agency 
(RIEPA), promoting public-private dialogue and supporting the Government’s Doing Business reform 
action plan. This work i s underpinned by strong analytical input including the Doing Business Surveys. 
An Investment Climate Assessment w i l l be completed in early FY09 and the Bank i s working with other 
donors and the Government on a Joint Governance Assessment which includes a section on the Business 
Environment and on Corporate Governance (see Annex 3). 

108. Strengthening and deepening the financial sector w i l l feature prominently in the support 
program. On the side o f IDA, additional financing to the CEDP approved in Ap r i l 2008 supports 
implementation o f the key elements o f Rwanda’s Financial Sector Development Plan (payment system, 
microfinance, accounting and auditing standards). A second phase o f the ongoing program o f techn ica l 
assistance focusing on the insurance industry and the payment system (through the FIRST initiative) w i l l 
be implemented. IFC w i l l continue implementation o f a j o i n t IDN IFC Leasing Program, which i s helping 
firms overcome financing constraints to acquiring key productive assets. IFC i s also currently providing 
support to the National Bank o f Rwanda (BNR) to strengthen i t s public credit registry’s capacity to fu l f i l l 
i t s supervisory functions and prepare the legal framework required to develop credit reporting in Rwanda. 
IFC w i l l provide advisory services for securities market and institutional capacity building through i t s 
Efficient Securities Markets Institutional Development (ESMID) program being implemented as a 
regional program covering Rwanda, Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania. M IGA i s currently underwriting 
guarantees fo r two private investments in the financial sector worth approximately $1 Smillion. 

’ 

CAS Outcome 1.4: Management of public resources at central and local levels strengthened 

109. 
I n Rwanda’s resource constrained environment, effective use o f public resources i s even 
more critical fo r achievement of Rwanda’s growth and indeed the broader development agenda. 
Particular attention w i l l therefore be paid to strengthening PFM. This w i l l be aligned to the 
Government’s recently completed PFM Strategy and Action Plan and focus on a range o f PFM 
functions-budgeting, 
accounting and auditing, procurement, reporting and external oversight. 
Increasing emphasis w i l l be given to building PFM capacity at decentralized levels to ensure that the 
growing public resources being channeled to this level are used efficiently. As part o f the PER work 
support w i l l be provided for piloting PEFAs at the district level and a second national level PEFA in 
2010. The Bank w i l l continue to support GoR in policy development fo r Rwanda’s intergovernmental 
f i s c a l transfer system and reporting and help further clarify responsibilities fo r service delivery, human 
resource and f inanc ia l management between the different levels o f Government. 

110. 
The PFM support w i l l be provided pr imar i ly through the ongoing M u l t i Donor Trust Fund 
fo r PFM Reforms, supported by DfID and the EC , through the PFM component o f the Public 
Sector Capacity Building Project and the PRSG series. The ongoing multiyear PER w i l l also be an 
important vehicle for support. After completion o f the activities supported through these instruments, if 
additional financing needs emerge that require continued financing, resources could be re-allocated from 
the PRSG envelope. 

27 

11 1. 
I t i s critical that the significant scale up o f public investments envisaged in the EDPRS i s 
well justified, prepared and implemented to deliver the desired results. The Bank w i l l provide 
technical assistance and advisory services to help GoR complete and implement i t s Public Investment 
Policy which seeks to strengthen the efficiency and impact o f public investments. Key elements o f this 
work include developing c r i t e r i a fo r selecting between different public investment options, building 
capacity for project appraisal (technical, economic and financial) and putting in place institutional 
arrangements for proper project preparation, selection and monitoring. 
In addition support w i l l be 
provided for preparing and implementing a framework to guide PPPs. The multi-year Public Expenditure 
Review program w i l l be the main instrument for providing this support. 

112. 
The ongoing Public Sector Capacity Building Project (PSCBP) w i l l continue support for 
further refinements to and implementation o f Rwanda’s C iv i l Service Reform. Particular attention 
w i l l be paid to core systems32 readjusting staffing levels and ministerial structures in line with functional 
responsibilities, clarifying mandates and governance arrangements between ministries and associated 
agencies and commissions as well as sub national structures. In addition to support provided by DfID, the 
Bank w i l l focus on helping the GoR develop a retention and pay policy and conducting a review o f the 
various training institutions currently providing continued professional training for c iv i l servants with a 
view to consolidating training supply into a single c iv i l service college. 

Strategic Theme Two: Reducing Social Vulnerability 

113. Under the second strategic theme, the CAS w i l l support selected elements o f the Government’s 
program in the areas o f social protection (with a focus child and maternal health), and demobilization and 
reintegration. 

CAS Outcome 2.1: Significant Hea l th and Social Risks-to vulnerable groups and to social cohesion 
in Rwanda-are mitigated 

114. Building on Rwanda’s ma jor health sector reforms i n recent years support in this outcome 
area w i l l focus on: (i) Strengthening the community health, nutrition and family planning agenda; (ii) 
consolidating and institutionalizing processes o f autonomous decision-making and local management in 
health services delivery via performance-based budgeting and financing; and ( i i i ) strengthening the 
reform agenda in relation to human resources for health. ID A support w i l l specifically aim a t achieving 
progress on the challenging MDGs 4 and 5 and w i l l leverage funding from the Norwegian Health Results 
Innovation Grant (HRIG). TA and AAA w i l l support evaluation and further refinement o f the GoR’s 
micro health insurance system. The Bank w i l l also continue to play a role in the harmonization agenda in 
the health sector including participation in the SWAP and contribute to the discussion o f f i s c a l space for 
the health sector including analysis o f the appropriate funding fo r the sector. 

115. 
The Bank w i l l support the Government i n piloting two VUF’ program elements, the public- 
works employment program and the “direct supports” program. Support w i l l also include help i n 
refining the design, strengthening implementation, and monitoring and assessing both impact and initial 
experience during the pilots. The Bank w i l l work with the Ministry o f L o c a l Government (MINALOC) 
to plan how these VUP initiatives could evolve with suitable design modifications as needed fiom 
evaluation results and the experience gained into effective national core programs o f public-works 
employment and poverty-based social assistance that are structured to be administratively simple, fiscally 
sustainable, compatible w i th limited information requirements, and relatively f r e e o f adverse impacts such 
as distortions in labor markets or significant sources o f inequity. The Bank w i l l support the policies 

3 2 Including management information, strategic planning, monitoring and evaluation and performance management systems. 

28 

required for the success o f the ongoing health reform and VUP elements initially through a programmatic 
DPL series, which w i l l be merged with the PRSG series within the CAS period. 

1 16. Continued support w i l l be provided to the s t i l l critical demobilization and reintegration 
agenda. The ongoing support to Rwanda’s demobilization and reintegration effort under the 
Multi-Country Demobilization and Reintegration Program (MDRF’) Trust Fund closes in December 
2008. The Government o f Rwanda has recently proposed a third, three-year phase o f the Rwanda 
Demobilization and Reintegration Program (RDRP) that would aim to consolidate the past phase’s 
achievements. I D A w i l l therefore support a follow operation to f inance this next phase which has four 
areas o f activity: (i) maintaining capacity to demobilize and provide reintegration assistance to an 
estimated 5,500 combatants o f Rwandese armed groups who may return to Rwanda; (ii) demobilizing and 
provide reintegration assistance to a further 4,000 soldiers o f the Rwanda D e f e n s e Force; (iii) providing 
specialized medical and socio-economic reintegration assistance to disabled ex-combatants, and (iv) 
mainstreaming provision o f a number o f follow-up reintegration activities. IDA resources w i l l leverage 
additional resources from other donors33 who provided support during the first phase. 

Mainstreaming Support to Capacity Building 

117. 
The Capacity Building F i lter (CaB)34 w i l l help build public sector capacity and strengthen 
the participation o f civil society in development. I t i s envisaged that the ongoing PSCBP and support 
by other donors w i l l help address the key system-wide issues that constrain capacity development and 
broader public sector effectiveness. Past experience has shown that, while support through a single project 
plus the PRSG se r ies has been useful, the impact o f capacity building measures would be enhanced by 
mainstreaming such support across the entire program. This w i l l be done through the implementation o f a 
capacity building filter across a l l our interventions -financial and A A A . For the public sector, projects, 
budget support and AAA w i l l seek to ensure skills transfer to Rwandans, strengthen the organizations 
they work with and provide adequate policy frameworks and incentives that sustain and encourage 
reforms. Capacity constraints w i l l be addressed at individual, organizational and institutional levels to 
build skills, organizations and institutions. 

118 . Each Bank operation w i l l seek to strengthen i t s implementing institutions, to make sure that 
these institutions are fully equipped to implement projects in a coordinated way that i s aligned with i t s 
core mandate. This includes the phasing out of Project Implementation Units as well as working towards 
using country systems fo r Bank operations, consistent with Paris Declaration principles. On the demand 
side o f reform, the Bank’s engagement w i l l allocate time and resources t o allow for adequate information, 
consultation and participation o f c iv i l society and other stakeholders in project design, implementation 
and evaluation as well as in the production o f AAA. Concretely, the implementation o f the filter w i l l be 
achieved through: (i) Reviewing existing projects and strengthening their attention to capacity building. 
For a l l new operations, an annex w i l l be included in the Project Appraisal Document on how the f i l t e r i s 
to be applied in the specific case; (ii) AAA and technical assistance w i l l focus on areas outlined which 
w i l l also be checked at review meetings o f AAA. Financing w i l l be sought from the Governance 
Partnership Facility between the World Bank, DflD, and the Netherlands, for implementation o f the 
Capacity Building Filter. 

34 

33 Belgium, Canada, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland and the Un i ted Kingdom. 
The f i l ter draws on existing experience o f integrating capacity and governance issues in to CASs such as in the Lao CAS 2005 
(focus on capacity building); Albania CAS 2006 (applied governance f i l t e r focusing on PFM, CSR, decentralization and citizen 
participation); Mali CAS 2008 (developed a capacity development approach for key sectors). 

29 

D. Scaling U p Support to Rwanda 
119. 
There are compelling arguments f o r scaling up support to Rwanda. The first i s need. 

Rwanda i s s t i l l a long way from achieving several o f the MDGs and in the absence o f a much scaled up 
effort, only limited progress i s likely to be made. Poverty i s pervasive and severe and growth needs to 
become more robust, inclusive and sustainable over time. Rwanda’s financing needs, particularly in the 
infrastructure sectors which are c r i t ica l for growth remain significant. There i s also ample evidence that 
Rwanda can absorb additional resources particularly i n these sectors. 

120. 
I n the face o f this significant need and financing constraint, Rwanda has a leadership that i s 
committed to achieving ambitious development goals and Rwanda i s a good performer. The country’s 

low level o f corruption also minimizes risks that ID A resources w i l l be misused. The EDPRS presents a 
good basis fo r the Bank group to scale up its assistance. The CAS envisages a scaled up program o f 
support through a richer menu o f financing options that should allow the Bank Group to se ize the 
opportunity to contribute to s ign i f ican t development impact in Rwanda. 

121. Rwanda’s readiness to become eligible for a mix o f I D A credits and grants w i l l be assessed 

through regular DSAs. The mid term review during FY 10 w i l l provide an opportunity to review the 
classification i f the debt vulnerability indicators improve significantly. This would allow a larger ID A 
envelope as well as enhance Rwanda’s possibility to borrow from other concessional sources. 

122. Beyond an expanded I D A envelope, Rwanda has expressed in teres t in taking advantage o f 
IBRD products for IDA only countries. In particular as appropriate, Rwanda w i l l apply to be considered 
for financing o f specific enclave projects under IBRD terms. This w i l l be done in careful consideration o f 
debt sustainability. These would ideally be for financing projects with some private sector involvement 
which meet other conditions for this program. 

123. 

I D A , I F C and M I G A w i l l also wo rk together more collaboratively to help leverage private 

financing f o r Rwanda’s development program. M IGA plans to engage more strongly to facilitate 
private sector investments. ID A resources w i l l also be used more strategically to leverage resources from 
additional sources including non traditional sources. Finally Rwanda’s participation in regional 
operations w i l l also leverage additional resources beyond i t s national/country ID A envelope. 

E. Partnerships 
124. 
The CAS w i l l seek greater collaboration w ith other donors i n various areas notably on the 

private sector development agenda and in the energy sector with the AfDB, on the PFM and Financial 
Sector Agenda with the IMF under ongoing IMF/World Bank special initiatives, with the EC on 
Transport and increasingly agriculture, and with UK DfID on Soc ia l Protection. In our role as lead 
donors in three sectors we w i l l help establish stronger frameworks for donor alignment and 
harmonization. In agriculture and in energy the Bank i s leading the preparation o f SWAps and i s also co- 
chairing with Government the process o f preparation o f a Joint Donor/Government Governance 
Assessment which w i l l inspire a joint Governance framework and work plan. The Bank w i l l also play a 
stronger role to attract additional financing from other donors including through use o f silent partnership 
arrangements where other donors might support different sectors through the Bank. The Bank w i l l work 
with EC and the AFDB to achieve greater harmonization o f our budget support and PFM assistance. The 
recently agreed Common Performance Assessment Framework (CPAF) provides an opportunity for the 
Bank to harmonize our budget support program and conditionalities with the larger group o f budget 
support donors. 

125. 
The CAS also envisages stronger partnerships w ith non-traditional partners such as China, 
Ind ia and philanthropic organizations such as the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. There i s 

3 0 

growing economic collaboration between China and India. The Bank i s exploring possibility o f joint 
support with China t o a major agriculture project focused on Land Management, Water Harvesting and 
Hillside Irrigation. Several philanthropic institutions have increasing interest in Rwanda and the Bank 
w i l l seek ways to collaborate with them on various initiatives. 

126. The WBG w i l l facilitate learning and knowledge sharing between more successful 
economies in the South and Rwanda. In addition to the twinning arrangement between the Electrogaz 
and the Tunisian Power U t i l i ty that the Bank i s facilitating, Rwanda participated in the recent China 
Africa Experience Sharing Seminar in Beijing, and a study tour o f Rwandan o f f ic ia ls to lea rn the lessons 
from successful e f fo r ts on targeted poverty programs i s being planned. Other activities w i l l be arranged 
in response to demand and as opportunities arise. 

F. Results Monitoring and Management 
127. Given the results focus o f the CAS, strong emphasis i s placed on the results monitoring and 
management framework. The results focus w i l l be implemented at three levels: (i) ut the na t iona l level 
through support to the development o f an effective EDPRS results management system; (ii) u t the Bank 
po r t fo l io level through the establishment o f a solid CAS results framework and results monitoring system; 
and (iii) ut the p ro jec t level through strengthened resu l ts management o f individual Bank operations. 

128. The Bank, and other donors are currently supporting the Government t o put in place the 
appropriate tools and processes to ensure that an effective results management system i s in place to 
track the achievement o f the ambitious EDPRS objectives. Results and Policy M a t r i c e s linking EDPRS 
results measurements and policy actions for a l l key sec tors have been developed. An EDPRS Monitoring 
Unit responsible for producing the annual EDPRS progress reports has been established in MINECOFIN 
and M&E officers in a l l Sector Ministries are being recruited to support the collection o f relevant EDPRS 
sectoral progress data. In order to have reliable data the National Institute o f Statistics i s also being 
integrated in the EDPRS M&E system. Capacity gaps have been identified in both areas M&E and 
Statistics and are being addressed through a combination o f training and exchange o f experiences as part 
o f an M&E Community o f Practice that i s being created. 

129. The upcoming National Statistical Development Strategy (NSDS; 2008-11) i s an opportunity 
to strengthen monitoring capacity in Rwanda. This strategy w i l l align statistical production with 
EDPRS and sector monitoring requirements, and w i l l support the enhancement o f capacity in a country 
already slightly above the ID A average. Capacity assessments have been completed in a l l districts and 
are being undertaken in l i n e ministries. Donor support i s generally coordinated through a basket funding 
arrangement managed by UNDP, with participation from the EC and DfID, with commitments for US$20 
million o f the estimated US $ 3 9 million required to implement the NSDS. To address the shortfall, the 
country team intends to apply fo r funds through the new “Statistics for Results” facility, which i s 
currently being set up by the Bank with funding from major bilateral donors. The Bank i s currently 
providing support through a Trust Fund for Statistical Capacity Building in the area o f national 
accounting, survey design and analysis for poverty monitoring, and knowledge exchange. 

130. To strengthen the national system and avoid duplication o f efforts, the CAS Results 
Framework i s aligned to the EDPRS M&E framework by linking where possible the indicators, the 
data sources and the M&E systems o f the Bank operations to the ones of the Government. The CAS 
Results Framework presented in Annex 1 i s focused on a set o f EDPRS objectives that the Bank i s 
expected to be able to demonstrably influence over the CAS period. The CAS outcomes have been 
formulated bearing in mind that results during this CAS period w i l l come mainly from existing 
operations, and the quicker-disbursing interventions included in the CAS. Measurable indicators and 
milestones have been identified and regular results-focused portfolio reviews w i l l be carried out to asses

Annex 3: Rwanda’s Joint Governance Assessment. 

1. 

In ear ly 2007, the Governmen t o f Rwanda and deve lopmen t par tners i n i t i a t e d a j o i n t assessment 
o f Governance in Rwanda . In the past, such assessments were done separately by i n d i v i d u a l agencies and 
development partners 
i n c l u d i n g the W o r l d Bank, 
the EC, D f I D, the Netherlands, 
the A f r i c a n 
Deve lopmen t Bank and U S A I D . The fundamen ta l ob jec t ives o f this i n i t i a t i v e are to : (i) deve lop a 
common (government and donors) unders tand ing o f governance issues in Rwanda ; (ii) reduce transac t ion 
costs by conso l ida t ing d i f fe ren t dono r governance assessment ac t iv i t ies ; and (iii) p rov ide an ob jec t ive , 
evidence-based assessment tha t re f lec ts Rwanda ’s spec i f ic governance h i s t o r y and i t s curren t con tex t and 
realities. The Assessment w i l l also f o rm the basis f o r i d e n t i f y i n g areas in the Governmen t ’s Governance 
program that need greater attention, and f o r ha rmon iz ing governance in terven t ions . 
I t w i l l p rov ide a 
framework f o r regu lar m o n i t o r i n g o f governance progress in Rwanda . 

2 . 

A Steering Comm i t tee (SC) with membersh ip o f k e y ambassadors, heads o f deve lopmen t 
agencies, relevant Governmen t M i n i s t e r s (Loca l Government, F inance , Justice, P u b l i c Service, 
In forma t ion) , the Presidency, the P r iva te Sector Federa t ion and CSO representatives, and j o i n t l y cha ired 
b y the Ministry o f L o c a l Governmen t and the W o r l d B a n k was set up t o lead the process. The SC was 
supported by a Joint Techn ica l Comm i t tee . Am o n g others, the SC sought t o ensure that the Assessment 
w o u l d be j o i n t l y owned by Governmen t and donors, and conduc ted with a high degree o f pro fess iona l ism 
and independence w h i c h w o u l d l e n d in terna t iona l c r e d i b i l i t y t o the findings and recommendations. An 
in terna t iona l firm-The P o l i c y Practice-was 
rec ru i ted th rough an open c om p e t i t i v e process t o carry out 
the Assessment. 

3 . 

In ca r ry ing out the Assessment, the f o l l o w i n g research me thods we re used: 
0 Rev iew o f ex is t ing governance l i tera ture and ind ica tors on Rwanda ; 
In te rv iews o f around 200 respondents in Government, c i v i l soc ie ty and the p r iva te Sector; 
Stakeholder wo rkshop f o r over 100 par t ic ipan ts in January 2008 in K i g a l i ; 
0 D iscuss ion o f d ra f t ind ica to r F ramewo rk at the Gove rnmen t and Deve lopmen t Partners’ 
retreat in M a r c h 2008; 
Consu l ta t ions with d is t r ic t governmen t in 5 districts; 
0 Regu lar mee t ings with the S teer ing Comm i t tee and techn ica l C omm i t t e e t o discuss progress, 
ear l ier dra f ts and nex t steps. 

4. 
The Assessment has recen t ly been completed. 
I t concludes tha t Rw a n d a has made impress ive 
progress in governance since the 1994 genocide (espec ia l ly in areas such as peace and security, na t iona l 
reconc i l ia t ion , trans i t iona l jus t ice , ins t i tu t ions o f accoun tab i l i ty , p u b l i c f i n a n c i a l management, the fight 
against co r rup t ion and decen tra l iza t ion) and 
iden t i f ies rema in ing cha l lenges in ‘Ruling Justly’, 
strengthening ‘Governmen t Effectiveness’, and im p r o v i n g the ‘ Inves tmen t C l im a t e and Corpora te 
Governance’. There are three b road tasks that are highlighted f o r greatest a t ten t ion : 
Ins t i tu t ions need t o be fu r the r strengthened and rules-based governance m o r e r i g o r o u s l y 
enforced; 
Ve r t ica l accoun tab i l i ty be tween governmen t and c i t izens needs t o be strengthened, in 
par t icu lar by enab l ing cons truc t ive state-society engagement a round p a r t i c i p a t o r y processes 
such as budgeting, p l a n n i n g and mon i to r ing ; and 
Transparency and access t o re l iab le i n f o rm a t i o n are essential t o n e a r l y a l l aspects o f good 
governance. 

5 . 

Recogn iz ing b o t h the scale o f the challenges, and Rwanda ’s exper ience so f a r tha t a good dea l 
can in practice be achieved; the Assessment suggests tha t the approach t o s treng then ing governance needs 
to be ambitious. I t also recognizes there are m a n y l inkages be tween d i f f e r e n t areas o f governance, such 

41 

that progress i n any one area i s influenced by progress i n others. Given resources limitations, the 
prioritization and sequencing o f interventions w i l l be essen t ia l . The report w i l l be disseminated widely by 
Government and donors following discussion and approval by Cabinet after the summer recess. 

6 . 
The SC has agreed that donors w i l l review their governance programs to ensure alignment with 
the recommendations o f the Assessment. Under the newly established EDPRS Results Monitoring 
Framework, the coordination o f the implementation and monitoring o f the findings o f the Assessment w i l l 
be taken forward by the EDPRS Governance Implementation Working Group (IWG) which i s jointly 
chaired by the Ministry o f Local Government and the UNDP. I t i s expected that the Governance IWG w i l l 
agree soon a timeline for the next Assessment.

Weak Capacity Unraveled 

Annex 4: Capacity Building F i lter 

1. 
Weak capacity slowed down implementation o f Rwanda’s first Poverty Reduction Strategy. 
Past experience o f building capac i ty revea led that “weak capac i ty” in the Rwandan con tex t can be 
disaggregated i n t o a number o f component parts. On governmen t effectiveness, weak capac i ty can be 
traced back t o l o w s k i l l s levels, weak core processes and ove rs igh t and organ iza t iona l structures 
insu f f ic ien t ly a l igned with m i n i s t e r i a l func t ions . In add i t ion , c i v i l soc ie ty engagement and vo ice can be 
strengthened, suppor t ing the government in i t s ex is t ing e f fo r ts . 

2. 
Rwanda emerged from the war and genocide with a drastically reduced stock o f human 
capital. Government institutions were similarly severely undermined o r destroyed. W h i l e econom ic 
g row th rebounded qu i te qu ick ly , the human and i n s t i t u t i o n a l damage i s t a k i n g m u c h longe r t o repa ir . As 
par t o f the ins t i tu t iona l r e b u i l d i n g process, most m i n i s t r i e s are s t i l l r e l a t i v e l y y o u n g - as a resu l t , a 
number o f systems, processes and procedures have n o t been fu l ly put in p lace and some core func t ions 
need to be be t ter de f ined . 

3 . 

I n addition, some o f Rwanda’s civil service reforms have proven to be counterproductive. 
The drastic reduc t ion in p u b l i c sector s ta f f ing has limited the numbe r o f peop le ava i lab le t o supervise, 
analyze, and imp lemen t as w e l l as t o learn. T h e adop t ion o f u n i f o rm o rgan iza t iona l charts f o r i t s cen tra l 
ministries coup led with a grade structure that i s t o o f l a t proves t o be “uneconom ic and i n e f f i c i e n t ” 
(O x f o r d P o l i c y Managemen t 2007).38 A lso , some o f the re fo rms rema in un f in ished . W h i l e the 
Governmen t has put in p lace a large number o f agencies as par t o f i t s ou tsou rc ing strategy in an e f f o r t t o 
move imp lemen ta t ion away f r om cen tra l m in is tr ies , the re la t ionsh ip be tween m in is t r ies and agencies 
remains undefined, lead ing t o over lapp ing mandates, weak superv is ion and management o f agencies by 
their parent ministries. S im i l a r prob lems ex is t with the r a p i d imp lemen ta t ion o f decentralization-

the center and h o w t o e f fec t ive ly supervise ac t iv i t ies at the sub-na t iona l leve l . 

4. 
Rwanda’s first Public Expenditure and Accountability Assessment was completed in 2007. 
I t shows tha t while in some areas the p u b l i c f inanc ia l management system pe r fo rms s trong ly , in several 
other areas considerable strengthening i s needed. T h e m a i n areas o f d i f f i c u l t y inc lude accoun t ing 
record ing and reporting, and ex terna l sc ru t iny and aud i t . R e p o r t i n g at decen tra l ized levels, i s p a r t i c u l a r l y 
weak and a key area o f risk in Rwanda’s decen tra l iza t ion process as 
inc reas ing resources are 
decentralized t o d is tr ic ts and lowe r down . A fully f u n c t i o n a l in tegra ted f i n a n c i a l managemen t system i s

place and n ew ins t i tu t iona l arrangements f o r the p u b l i c procuremen t f u n c t i o n are b e i n g created.

Cogn izan t o f the impor tance o f b u i l d i n g capacity, the G o R deve loped the Multi Sector Capac i ty 
Building Program, spann ing pub l ic , p r i v a t e and c i v i l soc ie ty sectors, launched in 2004. It a lso established 
a government agency charged with ope ra t iona l iz ing the M S C B P and coo rd ina t ion o f capac i ty building in 
the country, the H um a n Resources and I n s t i t u t i o n a l Capac i ty Deve lopmen t A g e n c y (HIDA). T h e

MSCBP follows a comprehensive approach t o capacity building: strengthening individual skills, 
improving the functioning o f organizations and developing or improving the institutional framework 
conducive to capacity and good governance. The World Bank financed Public Sector Capacity Building 
Project (PSCBP), effective since March 2005, supports the public sector arm o f the MSCBP. I t addresses 
c iv i l service reforms, PFM, strengthens local training institutions and parliament, improves ICT use 
within ministries, supports the development o f a national M&E system and provides custom-made 
support to priority ministries under the former PRSP, now Economic Development and Poverty 
Reduction Strategy (EDPRS). In addition, Rwanda i s putting in place mechanisms to attract skilled 
Rwandans living abroad through programs such as “Transfer o f Knowledge through Expatriate Nationals 
(TOKTEN) and Migration fo r Development in Africa (MIDA). 

C A S app roach 

7. 

Past experience in building capacity through the MSCBP and PSCBP has shown that complex 
issues such as capacity building and governance can only be partially taken on by a single-project 
approach. A comprehensive and cross-cutting approach i s needed. The CAS therefore follows a two- 
p ronged app roach o f addressing core issues such as public sector management (notably PFM and CSR) 
and developing a policy framework fo r skills building through concrete interventions (such as the existing 
PSCBP, a new project on s k i l l s development and Economic and Sector Work) and a capacity-building 
CaB) f i l t e r to mainstream such cross-cutting concerns in to the Bank’s operations, analytical activities and 
budget support. 

T h e Capac i ty B u i l d i n g (CaB ) F i l t e r 

8 . 

Capacity includes building capable states and engaged societies - both are critical to achieving 
development results.39 E f f e c t i v e states means that the government i s capable o f delivering public goods 
and services, o f providing an enabling environment fo r growth and development and ensuring peace and 
security. Engaged societies play an important role as they participate in public decision-making, 
contribute to provision o f public goods and services and hold authorities accountable. Both elements are 
a lso critical building blocks o f the Bank’s Governance and Anticorruption Strategy. 

9 . 

The CaB filter4’ w i l l thus include measures to help build public sector capacity and strengthen the 
participation o f c iv i l society in development. The filter i s a tool to mainstream these goals into Bank 
operations and analytical work. It seeks to help sector interventions to address capacity and governance 
challenges through their operations, analytic and advisory activities (AAA) and budget support and to 
ensure that a l l Bank activities contribute to the same goal. 
I t intends to aid the declaration o f the 
Governance and Anticorruption Implementation Plan for the Africa Region that “governance i s 
everybody’s business”. The CB focus w i l l be further developed during CAS implementation and secured 
in a Worl Bank strategy for capacity building in Rwanda.41 

39 

This was the main conclusion from the Report of the Wor ld Bank Task Fo rce on Capac ity Development in AfLica: 
Building Effective States-Forging Engaged Soc ie t ies . 
The f i l t e r draws on existing experience o f integrating capacity and governance issues into CAS such as in the L a o 
CAS 2005 (focus on capacity building); Albania CAS 2006 (applied governance filter focusing on PFM, CSR, 
decentralization and citizen participation); M a l i CAS 2008 (developed a capacity development approach for key 
sectors). 
The strategy might include a check l i s t for projects that allows task teams to ascertain whether they are paying 
sufficient attention to capacity and governance issues in their operations.

Strengthening Public Sector Capacity 

10. 

Capacity constraints w i l l be addressed at individual, organizational and institutional levels to 
build skills, organizations and institutions. 

Individual capacity through s k i l l s building: 

Five measures are suggested t o encourage skills building through Bank operations: 

1. Staffing in line w i th needs. Current staffing levels leave central ministries with an insufficient 
number o f people in place to carry out day to day work l e t alone identify, analyze, define, 
disseminate and implement vitally important reforms. In some areas, ministries are in a low 
capacity trap where even external technical assistance i s underutilized due to a lack o f 
supervision, working with and learning from experts. In addition, the low staffing levels mean 
that there i s l i t t l e scope for newcomers or young professionals to learn on the job. During the 
CAS period, a careful review o f staffing levels in line with functions w i l l be completed, 
identifying additional staffing needs after taking in to consideration efficiency gains through 
introduction o f more efficient systems and the completion o f decentralization reforms. 

2. Addressing incentives fo r performance. To ensure optimal utilization o f existing human 
capital, improved human resource management i s key as well as an overhaul o f the pay and 
retention strategy. Other donors, notably DfID, are engaged in a fu l l roll-out o f a performance 
management system, an important complementary measure. 

3. Developing schemes 
to attract qualified Rwandans onto public sector jobs and 
train/coach/mentor young talented Rwandans (Rwandan Expertise Scheme). This would include 
holistic learning through twinning and institutional partnerships. 

4. Mo r e effective use o f technical assistance. Outside experts recruited under World Bank 
projects should carry a dual function o f delivering their reports, analysis and other output but also 
to transfer knowledge and skills. 
Including in the TOR o f experts the requirement to train 
counterparts, teach best practice and work closely with them while delivering the product w i l l be 
important ingredients to ensure that s k i l l s transfer i s taking place and re l iance on foreign experts 
i s reduced over time. Agreeing with Government counterparts that key s t a f f w i l l be made 
available to work with consultants i s another step in ensuring that transfer o f knowledge can 
occur. 

5 . Support Local Tra in ing Institutions in a l l sectors o r engagement. Existing training 
institutions in Rwanda are under-equipped, -staffed and often poorly managed. Supporting their 
capacity through training o f tra iners and/or institutional partnerships with training institutions i n 
the region or beyond w i l l be an important contribution to ensuring that training needs can be 
catered to sustainably in-country. 

Building organizational capacity: 

11. 

Core functions across the public sector are in need o f strengthening. These include PFM, HR 
management, strategic planning, ICT, monitoring and evaluation etc. Each one o f these w i l l be supported 
through a variety o f projects such as the PSCBP, eRwanda, RCIP, etc. In addition, the Bank w i l l continue 
to engage ministries, through MIFOTRA to adapt organizational structures to functional needs, moving 
away from the rigid four unit structure. 

45 

Going further, each Bank operation w i l l seek to strengthen its implementing institutions such as the 
Rwanda Environment Agency and the ministries for agriculture, communications, infrastructure etc., to 
make sure that these institutions are fully equipped to implement projects in a coordinated way that i s 
a l igned with its core mandate. This includes the phasing out o f Project Implementation Units as well as 
working towards using country systems fo r Bank operations. 

12. 

Finally, support to specific institutions w i l l continue such as parliament, the ministry o f finance, 
the Auditor General’s Office etc. 

Strengthening Institutional capacity 

13. 
Each reform requires the establishment o f the policy or enabling framework and rules o f the 
game. While each sector w i l l attend to ensuring that the legal framework i s sound, fo r the area o f 
capacity building in particular, the CAS foresees the development o f a post-basic education policy 
framework. 

Strengthening civil society engagement and the local private sector 

14. 

Unleashing the potential o f c iv i l society and the local private sector are important parts o f 
governance reforms, and capacity building. The Bank w i l l work to strengthen external oversight 
mechanisms, such as through the media and c iv i l society, as powerful tools to engage society, the 
ultimate beneficiary o f public sector reforms, constructively in the national reform process. There are 
numerous examples o f soc ia l accountability tools, such as c i t izens ’ guides to government services, 
complaint mechanisms, c iv i l society consultations and participation, c i t izens ’ report cards etc. which 
could be employed. 

15 . 
Rwanda’s c iv i l society i s still young but plays an increasingly important ro le in facilitating the 
development o f the country. The World Bank can play an important ro le in supporting this trend by 
engaging more actively with C iv i l Society Organizations (CSOs) through consultation and participation 
in the production o f its AAA as well as throughout project preparation and the use o f CSOs in project 
monitoring and evaluation. Also, l o c a l CSOs can and should be used more proactively as researchers and 
consulting bodies in the preparation o f AAA and delivery o f services. 

16. 
I n addition, the Bank plays an important role in providing access t o information on its own 
operations and A A A to stakeholders and society at large. Sufficient funds should be budgeted to allow 
fo r consultations and dissemination o f AA products. Each project w i l l ensure that information i s 
provided on objectives and results, also working with government counterparts in ensuring that 
information reaches vital stakeholders. Similarly, the Bank w i l l continue to strengthen outreach to CSOs 
by parliament. 

17. 

I n addition to support to private sector development, the Bank w i l l use loca l consultants and firms 
more proactively such as in A A A as well as in project preparation and supervision. Systematically 
teaming up international consultants with loca l experts i s an important step to building the capacity o f the 
local consulting industry. 

How to integrate and apply the CaB F i lter in the Bank’s work 

18. 

The Bank’s Governance and Anti-Corruption (GAC) Strategy as well as 
the GAC 
Implementation Plan for the Africa Region highlight that governance i s everyone’s business. The same 

46 

holds true fo r capacity building. Consequently, governance and CB w i l l become a foca l area for a l l TTLs. 
Concretely, mainstreaming o f the CaB Filter w i l l be achieved through the following means: 

In our operations: Review existing projects and strengthen their attention to CB. For a l l new 
projects, include an annex in the Project Appraisal Document on how the filter i s applied in the 
project, to be discussed during each review meeting. 
In our analytic work: A A A and technical assistance w i l l focus on areas outlined in the CaB Filter, 
also to be checked at each review meeting o f AAA . 
Through budget support: triggers may include key policy decisions and benchmarks that would 
support capacity building and governance, addressing s k i l l s , institutional structures and processes 
as well as voice, participation and c iv i l society engagement. 

0 

19. 

To this end, project preparation teams w i l l be encouraged to include a governance and capacity 
building specialist to help identify ways i n which the filter can be adopted to the particular project. The 
Bank w i l l recruit a governance specialist based in the Country Office to support project teams. The same 
person would develop the CaB Filter in more detail, collate and share experience o f projects to build a 
knowledge base and draw on experience o f other countries in mainstreaming governance, and capacity 
building concerns into the Bank’s portfolio.

I n the baseline, Rwanda’s projected external debt burden trajectory breaches one critical

downward path thereafter.44 A l t e r n a t i v e scenarios ind ica te that shocks t o the sm a l l expo r t base w o u l d

A country i s considered at h igh risk o f debt distress if the baseline scenario indicates a protracted breach o f debt or debt-service 
thresholds, but the country does currently not face any payment difficulties. 
44 The relevant thresholds are (i) 40 percent NPV debt to GDP ratio; (ii) 150 percent NF’V debt to export ratio; (iii) 250 percent 
N P V debt to revenue; (iv) 3 0 percent debt service to revenue ratio; and (v) 20 percent debt s e r v i c e to exports.

Reforms are already underway to reduce the cost o f doing business, deepen the financial 
sector and undertake key infrastructure investments. Rwanda i s also developing an energy sector 
strategy t o systematically address i t s energy constraints in a sustainable manner. In addition, government 
i s elaborating a strategy to develop vocational education and training, and ensure that the education 
system i s producing the types o f graduates that are most needed for employment and growth. These 
efforts, together with measures to promote exports, should no t only ra ise overall growth, but also help 
improve the business and investment climate, and facilitate a strengthening and diversification o f the 
export base. At the same time, the authorities are committed to reforms t o improve expenditure and debt 
management and raise the revenue-to-GDP ratio fo r an eventual exit from donor flows.

Annex 6: Rwanda’s A id Environment and Donor Coordination4’ 

1. 
Rwanda receives support from about thirty (30) donors, the largest being the USA, World Bank, 
UK, EC, and the AfDB. Support i s delivered through three main aid instruments: (a) general budget 
support (GBS); (b) sector budget support (SBS); and (c) project-based funding. An increasing level o f aid 
i s being channeled through general and sector budget support in l i n e with the Government’s A id Policy. 

Rwanda A id Policy 
2. 

The Rwanda A id Policy (RAP), adopted by the Cabinet on July 26, 2006 and endorsed in a “Joint 
Donors’ Statement o f Intent” on November 23, 2006 c l a r i f i e s the Government’s objectives in terms of 
mobilization and management o f Official Development Assistance (ODA). I t seeks to improve the 
management o f aid through better coordination and harmonization o f ODA as called for by the Paris 
Declaration on Aid Effectiveness. The RAP identifies the six most urgent problems that limit efficiency 
and effectiveness o f aid and weaken prospects for the scaling-up o f aid over the short and medium term 
as: 

0 

Weak capacity and inability o f the Government to “attract and retain highly qualified and skilled 

staff.” 

0 

0 

0 

0 

Excessive and fragmented conditionality which “may result in problems o f predictability in terms 
o f the volume, quality, and timing o f aid.” 
High transaction costs because “donors continue to place significant demands on government in 
terms o f time, reporting needs, and use o f their other resources through numerous missions and 
meetings.” 
Incomplete reporting o f ODA, including that provided by NGOs, because o f unwillingness or 
inability o f donors to meet the government’s requests fo r information, but also possibly because 
o f the Government’s tendency “in some areas to place unstructured demands on Development 
Partners (DPs) for information.” 
Lack o f alignment with government priorities and systems because o f weak strategies in some 
sectors as a result o f their low capacity in planning, leading to situations where “too frequently 
donors continue to promote their own, often political, objectives at the expense o f government 
ownership. Much o f assistance remains o f f plan and o f f budget;” large vertical funds sometimes 
create sector distortions; and technical assistance i s “in some instances perceived to undermine 
loca l capacities rather than improving them.” 
Low volume o f external assistance on concessional terms when there i s a need to maintain 
external debt sustainability, while at the same time undertaking in large investments to meet long- 
term (Vision 2020) objectives. 
The RAP aims to address these urgent problems giving paramount importance to country 
ownership; preference fo r un-earmarked budget support but recognizes that a l l donors may not be able to 
provide their assistance under such modality (short o f this, the Government “prefers sector budget support 
followed by stand alone projects, which in any event should be recorded on-budget and consistent with 
the national plan”); and a number o f other measures. Key challenges to its implementation have included 
limited commitment by donors and capacity constraints.

Trend in A id Flows 
4. 
Rwanda has had substantial scaling up o f aid flows. In 2006, total ODA was US$602.7 million or 
26.5 percent o f GDP. Like much o f Sub Saharan Africa, Rwanda i s highly aid dependent. In l i n e with 
the RAP, Development Partners are increasingly providing funds through budget support mechanisms. In 

4 5 This Annex draws extensively from Baelhadj Merghoub and Jane. Kirby-Zaki April 2008. Rwanda Country 
Consultation Report Linking Global Programs and other Aid Modalities to Country S tra teg ies and Systems.

2006,26 percent o f external grants in the form o f budget support with an estimated increase to 30 percent 
in 2007. Currently, the World Bank and the United Kingdom are the largest budget support donors46 
Increases in budget support are set to continue with more Development Partners committing to budget 
support, eager to meet the 2010 Paris Declaration on A i d Effectiveness targets related to the use o f 
program-based approaches. 
5 . 
Rwanda also receives substantial funds for implementation o f global programs, such as the 
Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI), the Global Fund to fight Aids, Tuberculosis and 
Ma la r ia , United States President’s Emergency Plan fo r AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), and the Education for a l l 
Fast Track Initiative (EFA-FTI). Smaller initiatives funded by private philanthropic actors like the 
Clinton Foundation, are also growing. 
Coordination Mechanisms 
6. 
Key coordination groups, including the Development Partners Coordination Group (DPCG), the 
Budget Support Harmonization Group (BSHG), and Sec tor and cross-Sector Clusters have been formed 
for the Government and Development Partners to interact. These groups have been involved in 
preparatory consultations and joint monitoring o f the tw o Poverty Reduction Strategies Rwanda has 
prepared to date. Table 1 below provides a summary o f these coordination mechanisms. 
With the completion o f the EDPRS, new institutional arrangements have been put in place for 
monitoring implementation o f the strategy. Eight new Implementation Working Groups (IWGs) 
reflecting the priority thematic areas o f the EDPRS w i l l serve as the forum t o coordinate between sectors, 
and between government and development partners, to discuss policy issues and monitor implementation. 
Each IWG w i l l comprise stakeholders from related sector groups. SWGs w i l l continue to exist with their 
role o f updating sector strategies in l i n e with their logical frameworks and thereafter conduct annual Joint 
Sector Reviews. These w i l l feed into the work o f the respective IWGs. 
Through establishing country-led development and enacting policies that promote alignment and 
harmonization o f aid, Rwanda has made progress in ownership, harmonization and alignment o f aid to the 
budget. Ownership has been strengthened through the country planning and developing i t s development 
strategy (PRSP and the EDPRS) and the A id Policy which outlines i t s own principles fo r cooperation and 
planning, managing and monitoring aid. A Development Assistance Database (DAD) was established to 
serve as in te r face for data collection, analysis and dissemination o f in forma t ion pertaining to external

9 . 
Harmonization e f fo r ts have helped move assistance gradually, to GBS and SBS financing 
modalities and promoted SWAps in several sectors with Annual Sector Work Programs. I t has also 
helped development o f joint capacity building programs supported by special pooled funds. Alignment 
has been advanced under GBS and SBS financing modalities (42 percent o f aid in 2005) through support 
provided for capacity building in critical areas o f fiduciary, government effectiveness, etc. Significant 
challenges include; (i) diversifying sources and modalities o f financing development in terms particularly 
o f Rwanda’s ability to attract more donors to provide support through Program Based Approaches 
including GBS and SBS (66 percent by 2010), and increase the amount o f ODA to be “on plan” and “on 
budget” (80 percent by 201 0; (ii) increasing the predictability o f funding through front-loading 
disbursements under GBS and SBS; and (iii) avoiding a pluralist approach concerning determination o f 
conditionality under the GBS. 
10. 
Most o f the persisting challenges that need to be addressed re la te to “managing fo r results” Le. 
developing and implementing a streamlined monitoring and evaluation and audit system; and moving to 
mutual accountability with an independent evaluation system. Yet, even here efforts have been made 
through the recently concluded Common Performance Assessment Framework (CPAF) and the Donors’ 
Performance Assessment Framework (DPAF) - t o be finalized in September 2008.

Annex 8: Summary Findings from Independent Evaluations 

1 . 

Independent Evaluation Group ( IEG ) conducted a Country Assistance Evaluation (CAE) in 
2004. Key recommendations include that future IDA assistance focus on reducing poverty and inequality, 
using the Millennium Development Goals as an organizing framework. This implies a greater focus on 
increasing agricultural productivity, diversifying production, and transforming agricultural output into 
higher value-added products. I n addition, improving the quality of education and human capital, reducing 
population growth, increasing exports as a percentage o f GDP, and enhancing the enabling environment 
for private sector development were recommended as priority areas. Additionally, the CAE recommended 
that the focus o f assistance to the utilities sector be on delivery o f the most basic services to the 
population. Privatization, per se, should not prevail as an objective over reducing poverty and increasing 
access to fundamental services like water and electricity. 

2 . 

Although Rwanda was not explicitly classified as a low income country under stress, many o f the 
recommendations for those countries are applicable. 
Increased analytical and advisory services are 
critical to help enhance development effectiveness. Drawing lessons from the experiences o f other 
countries which underwent profound social and economic dislocation would be helpful to country teams. 
The review further recommends that project design be kept simple and adequate IDA resources be 
allocated to ensure close project supervision. I t also stated that IDA should continue to closely coordinate 
its efforts with other donors, with the objective o f becoming more selective in i t s interventions. IEG 
evaluations o f ICRs carried out during this period indicate that the objectives o f programs in a country 
with limited capacity should be realistically limited to what can be accomplished. Reform agendas 
needed to be kept simple, focused on priority areas, and consistent with country capacity. 

3 . 

The Quality Assurance Group (QAG) assessments o f the portfolio recommended that the teams 
put greater effort into integration o f environment in Bank supervision, and enhanced monitoring and 
evaluation o f the impacts o f Bank projects and programs. Task teams needed to carry out mid term 
reviews o f projects, taking into account lessons learned, when preparing additional financing operations. 
Additionally, i t recommended that when working in countries with weak implementation capacity, special 
attention needed to be paid t o past portfolio implementation performance when designing new operations, 
so i t could tailor project design to individual country capacity, and ensure implementation capacity o f 
units, and work to advance procurement documentation prior to Board approval. 

5 8 

Annex 9 : Portfolio Fiduciary Management 

1. 
Fiduciary performance o f the portfolio has overall been satisfactory. Post Procurement and 
Independent Procurement Reviews conducted in FY 07 and FYO8 respectively, rated portfolio 
procurement processes as being overall satisfactory during the las t two years. Procurement processes 
were judged to be transparent with more information available, quality o f procurement documents was 
found to be good, and a number o f procurement s t a f f have been recruited. The assessment noted the 
significant improvements made since the previous Post Procurement ReviewIIndependent Procurement 
Review conducted in October 2005.49 Due to this relatively good performance, prior review thresholds 
were raised (particularly) fo r new projects. For RSSP 11, thresholds were raised from US$200,000 to 
U S $ 5 million, and from US$ l50 ,000 to US$500,000 fo r works and goods respectively, and thresholds 
were doubled for the ongoing Urban Infrastructure and City Management project, Transport Sector 
Development project and the East Africa Trade and Transport Facilitation project. Procurement 
management challenges on the portfolio include managerial and technical issues at different levels, lack 
o f procurement s t a f f in one project, weak s t a f f capacity, and generally result from weaknesses in some 
elements o f the systems and processes rather than from deliberate efforts to misuse public resources 

2 . 

Audit reports have been largely received on time. I n FY08, 2 audit reports (EFTI and E- 
Rwanda) were received late partly due to delays in the o f f ice o f the Auditor General which carried out 
these audits and in the case o f the EFTI, partly due as well to lack o f clarity on how the audit would be 
ca r r ied out since the operation had been treated as a Specific Investment Operation rather than as 
Development Policy Lending Operation. Audits have generally not been qualified. A few audit reports 
have not met Bank standards and overall there i s room to improve quality. 

3 . 

Fiduciary management o f the portfolio i s closely linked w i th the quality o f broader public 
fiduciary management in Rwanda. Rwanda’s first Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability 
(PEFA) Assessment which was completed in 2007 gives a sense o f where Rwanda stands on fiduciary 
management. The report shows that while in some areas t h e public f inanc ia l management system perform 
strongly, in several other areas considerable strengthening i s s t i l l needed. Rwanda scored better than 
comparable Southern and Western African countries and better than countries in the East African 
Community on several aspects. 

4. 
The main areas o f difficulty include (timely) accounting recording and reporting, and 
external scrutiny and audit. Reporting a t decentralized levels, i s particularly weak and a key area o f 
risk as increasing resources are decentralized to district levels and lower down. The process o f putting in 
place a fully functional integrated financial management system i s ongoing and has not reached the stage 
where i t can reliably support the achievement o f critical PFM objectives. Other areas o f remaining PFM 
weakness include: budget credibility; quality o f sectoral planning and resource allocation decisions; 
comprehensiveness and transparency o f budgets; management o f emerging f i s c a l risks; budget execution 
controls, including payroll, accounting, recording as well as external scrutiny and audit. 

5. 

As regards procurement, the government has adopted a number o f measures to address 
the fiduciary risks to the portfolio and to broader public sector fiduciary management. Rwanda has 
been implementing PFM reforms since 2003. Key institutions for PFM including the Office o f the 
Accountant General, the Office o f the Chief I n t e r n a l Auditor, have been set up. An Organic Budget Law 
(OBL) and accompanying financial instructions have been adopted and an MTEF i s being implemented. 

~ 

49 Misprocurement was declared i n two projects -Human Resource Development Project (US$2,029,261) and Competitiveness 
and Enterprise Development Project (US$ 120,045) - in 2005. The misprocurements related to slicing o f contracts to avoid IDA 
prior review, failure to issue tenders through ICB, wrong shopping procedures and single source selection criteria. I n both 
circumstances, the Bank cancelled the amounts. 

59 

The Treasury Management Committee has been created and the f i r s t set o f consolidated financial 
statements fo r the public sector was prepared for the year 2006 while those fo r the year 2007 are awaiting 
audit. Significant results have also been achieved in procurement performance: (i) a sound l e g a l and 
regulatory framework has been put in place; ( i i ) standard bidding documents have been adopted; ( i i i ) 
institutions and processes4omplying with international standards-have been adopted; and (iv) the 
Rwanda Public Procurement Authority (RPPA) to regulate and oversee public procurement has been 
established. A detailed capacity building plan has been prepared and i s being implemented through the 
School o f Finance and Banking in collaboration with external training institutions. But more challenges 
remain to be addressed including adequately funding and staffing the RPPA to become fully operational, 
training a critical mass o f public sector staff in procurement procedures, preparing procurement manuals 
fo r contracting entities and widely disseminating the provisions o f the procurement law and regulations to 
the public. A Code o f Ethics for participants and provision fo r disclosure fo r those in decision making 
positions i s also being prepared. 

6. 
The Government i s about to complete a comprehensive PFM reform strategy based on 
the findings o f the PEFA and other studies in close consultation with development partners. The 
recommendations o f the recently completed Report on the Observance o f Standards and Codes (ROSC) 
Accounting and Auditing also suggested that Government focus on a few key areas including developing 
the Institute o f Certified Public Accountants o f Rwanda under a twinning arrangement with a developed 
professional body; support curriculum reform, training o f trainers; delivery o f training programs on IFRS 
and ISA; and preparation and dissemination o f learning materials on IFRS and J S A . The PFM reform 
strategy w i l l provide a basis for World Bank support to the core elements o f PFM strengthening in the 
CAS period. Support for implementation o f the recommendations o f the ROSC are being taken forward 
in the context o f the PSCBP, the Multidonor Trust Fund fo r PFM reform and the support to the financial 
sector. 

7. 

Rwanda has been selected as a potential pilot country f o r the use o f the national 
procurement system. The essence o f use o f Country system i s that instead o f using the Bank's guidelines 
and safeguards, the country's own system would be used when i t i s judged to be able t o deliver the 
equivalent results to the use o f the Bank's system. In Rwanda's case a good part o f legislative and 
regulatory framework i s already in place, but more needs to be done to deepen reforms. A World Bank 
mission reassessed the OECD/DAC benchmark assessment done in 2007, 56% o f the foundations o f the 
system are now in place, compared to 41% found earlier in 2007. During the next mission (planned for 
Sept OS ) a ser ies o f compliance and performance indicators (17) have been proposed. The assessment 
w i l l cover the period June 07-March O S . 

8. 
Successful 
implementation o f the Rwanda Country Pilot fo r use o f national 
procurement systems w i l l be a key objective during the CAS period. The approach w i l l have the 
following elements: (i) increase support for implementation o f ongoing re fo rms in order to address 
remaining sources o f risk; (ii) support the implementation o f the procurement capacity building program; 
(iii) regularly assess progress; and (iv) seize early opportunities to scale up where appropriate.

11. Rwanda’s Long Term Development Goals 

4. 

The Government of Rwanda’s (GoR) overall long-term development goals a re outlined i n 
i t s Vision 2020.5’ V i s i o n 2020 i s a l igned with the Millennium Deve lopmen t Goa ls (MDGs) and serves as 
a basis f o r GoR ’s po l ic ies , strategies, and actions a imed at fighting p o v e r t y . It sets ou t the coun try ’s l o n g 
term deve lopmen t strategy and ar t icu la tes amb i t ious targets by 2020 f o r inc reas ing G D P per cap i ta t o 
US$900 ( f r om US$230); r e d u c i n g t h e numbe r o f p o o r peop le t o 25 percen t o f t h e popu la t ion ( f r om 6 0 
percent); increas ing l i f e expec tancy t o 65 years ( f r om 49 years) and increas ing l i te racy t o 9 0 percent o f 
the popu la t ion ( f r om 48 percent). In 2006, the Governmen t prepared the V i s i o n - 2 0 2 0 Umurenge P rog ram 
(VUP), a p ro -poo r g r ow t h and expo r t strategy w h i c h targets p o v e r t y r e d u c i n g in terven t ions at the 
grassroots leve ls . 

5 . 

Rwanda’s f i r s t Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) provided the medium-term 
(2002-2006) operational framework f o r poverty reduction and growth. T h e PRSP was endorsed by 
the Boa rd o f the B a n k and the Fund on August 12, 2002. The PRSP i d e n t i f i e d t h e p r iva te sector as the 
m a i n engine o f grow th , with the t rans fo rma t ion o f agr icu l ture and the r u r a l economy as the lead ing 
sources o f grow th . T h e PRSP i d e n t i f i e d six p r i o r i t y ac t ion areas: (i) r u r a l deve lopmen t and agr icu l ture 
trans forma t ion ; (ii) h um a n deve lopmen t ; (iii) econom ic in fras truc ture ; ( iv ) good governance; (v) p r iva te

second PRSP, n o w ca l led the Econom ic Deve lopmen t and Pove r ty R e d u c t i o n Strategy (EDPRS). T h e 
EDPRS refocuses Rwanda ’s p r i o r i t y on g r ow t h and human deve lopmen t with an emphasis o n 
decentralization and greater r o l e f o r the p r iva te sector. 

6. 
Annual PRSP Progress Reports (APRs) were prepared by the Government in 2003, 2004, 
2005, and 2006. The APRs documented progress towards ach iev ing the PRSP ob jec t ives pa r t icu la r ly in 
t e rm s o f es tab l ish ing the requ ired ins t i tu t iona l and 
lega l frameworks , e.g., 
trade 
l ibera l iza t ion , 
pr iva t iza t ion , p u b l i c f inanc ia l management and decen tra l iza t ion o f governmen t func t ions . The Jo in t S t a f f 
A d v i s o r y No tes (JSANs) by the B a n k and the IMF commended the Gove rnmen t on the ove ra l l progress 
in imp lemen t ing PRSP p r io r i t ies and rated progress as satisfactory. 

7 . 

Rwanda has been able to maintain macroeconomic stability and the growth rate averaged 
5.1 percent during 2002-06.52 This g r ow t h rate, however, rema ined b e l ow the PRSP target o f 6.5 
percent. The average per cap i ta g r ow t h rate has been l o w at 3 percen t during 2002-2006, due t o high 
popu la t ion grow th , and l o w and var iab le g r ow t h in the ag r icu l tu re and manu fac tu r ing sector. The 
agr icu l ture sector grew at an average o f 4.6 percen t ( lowe r than the targe ted 5.3 percent). T h e average 
annual i n f l a t i o n rate increased f r om 2 percent in 2002 t o 9.4 percen t in 2007, due t o high f o o d and energy 
prices ar is ing f r om l o w f o o d ava i lab i l i ty and ene rgy shortages. 

8 . 

There was no substantial reduction i n poverty over the last few years. T o t a l income p o v e r t y 
dec l ined o n l y m a r g i n a l l y f r om 60.4 percent t o 56.9 percent. R u r a l p o v e r t y dec l ined f r om 66 t o 62 
percent, and pove r ty in K i g a l i and other urban areas dec l ined by 3 and 5 percent, respec t ive ly . Pove r ty in 
K i g a l i n o w stands at 20 percent. M a j o r causes o f pove r ty and i n e q u a l i t y are the l o w l e v e l o f agr icu l ture 
p roduc t iv i ty ( lack o f land, p o o r so i l cond i t ion , and un favo rab le wea ther conditions), high popu la t ion

also s lowed d ow n p r o d u c t i v i t y and kep t yields s ign i f ican t ly b e l ow the i r po ten t ia l . 

111. CAS Strategic Objectives 

9. 
The FY03 -06 CAS and the FY06 -08 ISN were aligned w i th the priorities outlined in the 
Government’s PRSP. The C A S focused on f o u r broad themes: i) r e v i t a l i z a t i o n o f ag r icu l tu re and the 
ru ra l economy; ii) p r iva te sector development and emp loymen t creation; iii) human and soc ia l 
development; and iv) imp rovemen t in the effectiveness o f p u b l i c ac t ions and governance. The strategic 
elements o f the I S N focused on: i) strengthening the d r ive rs o f g row th ; ii) enhanc ing health, educa t ion 
and social protection; and iii) state building and governance. For the purpose o f this C A S CR, i t i s 
necessary t o conso l ida te the C A S and ISN i n t o one assessment f r am ew o r k and f o u r C A S thema t ic areas 
(see Tab le 1). 

10. 

Neither the CAS nor the ISN were “results-based”. Howeve r , the C A S inc luded 25 C A S 
m o n i t o r i n g ind ica tors and was a l igned with the PRSP P o l i c y M a t r i x . Based on these C A S indicators, as 
w e l l as the m o n i t o r i n g f ramewo rks tha t were established under the series o f PRSGs, a set o f C A S 
outcomes have been der ived f o r the purpose o f this repor t . This “ re t ro f i t ted ” C A S resu l ts f ramewo rk i s 
inc luded in Annex 1 and progress made in terms o f ach iev ing these C A S ou tcomes are described be low . 

5 2 The growth rates for 2007 & 2008 are estimated at 6 percent.

11. 

The Bank supported Rwanda’s effort to renew the rural economy with a focus on implementing 
measures to improve agriculture productivity, and to improve access to infrastructure and basic rural 
economic and social services. Table 2 summarizes the progress in key indicators.

Improvements to the institutional arrangements fo r the agricultural sector. 
through a se r ies o f Poverty Reduction Support Cred i tdGran ts (PRSC/G I-III), Ins t i tu t iona l Reform Cred i t 

(IRC) and the Rural Sector Support Project (RSSP I ) supported the Gove rnmen t in unde r tak ing k e y

In 2004, the Gove rnmen t 
formu la ted a N a t i o n a l A g r i c u l t u r a l Po l icy , w h i c h was opera t iona l ized in 2005 with the launch ing o f the 
Strategic P lan f o r A g r i c u l t u r a l T rans fo rma t ion (PSTA) . In a d d i t i o n t o the PSTA , the Rwanda A g r i c u l t u r e 
Deve lopmen t A u t h o r i t y and the Rwanda A n im a l and Resources Deve lopmen t A u t h o r i t y were created. A 
sector MTEF f o r agr icu l ture was developed in 2005, and a l igned with the sector strategic p l a n and i t s 
outcomes. Since 2006, there have been earmarked transfers t o d is t r ic ts for sector p r io r i t ies such as 
extension services, eros ion con tro l , r u r a l infrastructure, h i l l s i d e i r r i g a t i o n and f o o d security. On the 
producer level, the RSSP 1 strengthened ins t i tu t iona l arrangements by p r o v i d i n g t r a i n i n g t o over 5,000 
farmers associations. 

Key marshlands and hillsides rehabilitated o r developed and extension services provided to 

16. 
farmers. Under the f i r s t phase o f the RsSP~’~ mo re than 3,018 ha o f marsh lands have been rehab i l i ta ted 
and developed f o r i r r i g a t i o n and 10,089 h a o f surround ing h i l ls ides have been rehab i l i ta ted or pro tec ted t o 
prevent land degradation and so i l erosion. 
Im p r o v e d c ropp ing techno log ies have been p rov ided and

has l a i d the ground for productivity-raising interventions in subsequent phases (RSSP2). ’’ The program 
combination with the institutional support o f producer organizations and training o f 5,000 lead farmers 
initially lacked adequate implementation capacity in the project unit and procurement capacities and 
suffered from an overly ambitious, dense and complex project design. However, following a project 
restructuring in 2005, the project outcome started to improve. 

17. 
The Bank’s Ag r icu l tu re Policy No te and the Country Economic Memorandum (CEM) 
contributed to policy reforms by identifying key constraints to agriculture productivity and growth. 
The CEM highlighted the need for an increase in agriculture productivity as a pre-requisite for meeting 
the growth target in the EDPRS over the medium-term. Recommendations from both studies have also 
formed the basis for RSSP2 and shaped the policy dialogue under the PRSC/G series. 

18 . 

Adoption o f a Land L a w guaranteeing tenurial security. The acute scarcity o f land i s by far 
the most critical constraint facing rural households in Rwanda. The Bank’s Institutional Reform Credit 
(IRC) supported a land policy and law guaranteeing tenurial security and potentially permitting the 
development o f a land market. The new land law also enables women’s land inheritance, ownership 
rights and resulted in an improved use o f land. 

Outcome 1.2: Ru r a l Social and Economic Services Improved 

19. 

This outcome focused on improving rural infrastructure services particularly in water and 
sanitation, and access to rural markets and services. 

20. 
Improved water supply and sanitation services in ru ra l areas. Achievements under the RuraZ 
Water Supply and Sanitation (RWSS) Project have been impressive: i) 408,000 people in 16 rural 

communities; and i i ) about, 65,000 school children in 105 schools gained access to improved water 
supply and sanitation services. A t the national level about 600,000 people gained access to potable water 
(compared with only 60,000 i n 2002) and water consumption increased from 5 liters per day in 2001 to 
10.7 l i t e r s per day in 2008. The PRSC/G se r ies supported the Government’s overall reform program in 
the sector, specifically the highly successful public-private partnerships (PPP) o f rural water services on 
the decentralized level. PPP currently manage over 25 percent o f the rural water supply and sanitation 
systems are managed compared to 1 percent 2004. Overall, access to water increased from 44 percent in 
2003 to 71 percent in 2007 setting Rwanda on the path to meet the water MDG. 

2 1. 
Improved access t o market and social services. RSSP I supported the construction o f 22 rural 
markets, 12 km o f feeder roads, 19 small bridges, 52 stores, 9 m i lk collection centers and 20 grain drying 
floors. In addition, 3 agriculture research centers and 3 farmers’ service centers have been completed. 
District schools, health centers, bridges, and local roads were rehabilitated as part o f 141 sub projects 

facilitated through the Decentralization and Community Development Project (DCDP). A total 14 

districts benefited from this project, which supported implementation o f Government’s “one cow per 
family” policy. DCDP provided over 440 cows to different provinces (based on poverty levels), 
constructed she l te rs and initiated a parallel program o f soil erosion control. 

CAS Theme 2: Pr ivate Sector Development & Employment Creation 

22. 
During the CAS period the Bank supported Rwanda’s policy and institutional reforms in addition 
to investments i n infrastructure to develop an e f f i c i e n t private sector that generates employment and 
enhanced productivity.

CAS Theme 4: Improving the effectiveness o f public financial management and economic 
governance 

5 8 . 

The Bank strategy concentrated on improving economic governance and transparency, 
particularly through institutional and regulatory reforms to strengthen capacity in public financial 
management and procurement including at decentralized levels. 

Key CAS Monitoring Indicators 
Adoption o f the Organic Budget Law and the Procurement Code. 
Adoption o f and progress in the implementation o f the Plan t o

59 . 

The progress under the CAS theme i s rated as moderately satisfactory. Public financial and 
expenditure management i n Rwanda improved during the last four years. Despite Rwanda’s weak 
institutional capacity the planned reforms envisaged under the CAS period have been implemented. In 
particular, the Bank supported operations helped to improve its budget planning and operations and 
strengthened the PFM system. Some accomplishments have been made i n terms o f improving serv ice 
delivery in loca l government and bringing in results, capital improvement in rehabilitating schools, new 
health centers etc. Citizen’s voice and accountability was strengthened through adoption o f citizen report 
cards and community score cards. However, progress in building capacities within public institutions has 
been slow. In future e f f o r t s are needed to improve coordination, building capacity among sectors, central 
and loca l governments to improve the overall PFM process. 

Outcome 4.1: Public Finance and Expenditure Management Strengthened 

60. 

This outcome focused on improving public finance and expenditure management through more 
transparent budget formulation, execution and reporting. I t sought to strengthen the linkages between 
strategic planning, the Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) and the na t iona l budget. 

61. 

An improved budget process. The PRSC/G series supported the 2006 Organic Budget law to 
support more accurate identification o f capital investment and recurrent expenditures and better alignment 
o f budget spending with policy priorities. A Joint Monitoring System was introduced in 2003 with a 
computerized financial software package. The system o f zero balance account i s operational and now a l l 
Government budget agencies are using zero balance sub accounts. A l l sector ministries and districts 
adopted MTEFS, which helped to improve budget predictability, budget preparation, implementation and 
monitoring. Except fo r the district level, where MTEF’s are not yet aligned with available resources. The 
2003 PER highlighted the problem o f la te expenditure re lease and pointed to difficulties in budget 
preparation.

62. 

Public Financial Management Reform Agenda 
Implemented. The Bank supported 
implementation o f the the public financial management reform agenda through the Institutional Reform 
Credit (IRC), the PRSC/G series and the Public Sector Capacity Building Project (PSCBP) and important 
analytical work such as the Public Expenditure Review. This agenda includes a range o f interventions 
including (i) the adoption o f the Organic Budget Law (2006); (ii) the appointment o f the Government 
Chief Internal Auditor and Accountant General; (iii) adoption o f the SMARTGOV budget system; and 
(iv) establishment o f the Treasury Management Committee. Despite implementing key reforms in the 
PFM area capacity in public accounting remained a key challenge during the CAS period. Rwanda 
continues to experience a shortage o f qualified professionals to meet the needs in public financial 

74 

management and procurement. The Bank along with other donors repeatedly highlights the need to 
strengthen Government’s leadership and coordination in PFM reforms in order to accelerate 
implementation o f PFM reforms. To provide additional support to the reform program, the development 
partners established a M u l t i Donor Trust Fund for PFM Reform. A Public Expenditure and Financial 
Accountability Assessment (PEFA) was carried out and the GoR w i l l use its findings to update the PFM 
action plan. 

63 . 

Procurement reform agenda implemented, albeit w ith some delays. 
The PRSG series 
supported reforms in the procurement system and the Country Procurement Issue Paper identified the 
weaknesses in the procurement system and prepared an action plan fo r the Government. A new 
procurement code was introduced i n 2005 and a new National Tender Board (NTB) introduced the 
principles o f good practice in the public procurement system. However, in general implementation of 
procurement reforms have been slow. This has been attributed to a lack o f strong leadership o f the 
procurement reform agenda, the lack o f coordination o f a l l ministries in charge o f implementation, and 
the absence o f a comprehensive action plan. PSCBP provided local and international experts to work to 
improve the procurement code, which was gazetted in April 2007. 

64. 

Training provided to professionals in P F M and Procurement. The Government, in c lose 
collaboration with the Bank and DfID prepared and adopted an action plan to improve financial 
accountability based on the Financial Accountability Review and Action Plan (FARAP) in 2003 which 
identified lack o f human resource capacity in accounting and auditing as a major constraint. Through the 
PSCBP a Multi-Donor Trust Fund was established to provide technical assistance and s k i l l s building in 
line with the PFM action plan. The PSCBP provided training on drugs and health supplies and supported 
preparation o f a long term procurement strategy and action plan. 

Outcome 4.2: Transparency, Efficiency and Accountability o f the Public Sector Improved 

65 . 

This outcome focused on strengthening the capacity o f the public sector in a transparent, 
accountable and efficient way, and enhancement o f citizens’ voice to provide good governance and 
service provision. 

66. 

Improved accountability towards citizens. Government institutions were strengthened after 
successful adoption o f a new constitution in 2003. The judiciary was separated from the executive and 
legislative and the Office o f the Prosecutor General and Office o f Ombudsman were created. The 
PRSC/G series supported c i t izens report and community score cards (CSCs) for education and health in 
2006 aimed at: (i) improving the dialogue between frontline service providers and users; (ii) promoting 
individuals and communities ownership o f evaluation outcomes; and (iii) and broadening citizen 
understanding o f policies, strategies and implementation processes. 

67. 

Public sector reforms implemented. The Public Sector Capacity Building Project (PSCBP) 
focused on improving the efficiency, transparency and accountability o f the public sector. Initial progress 
was slow, but key activities picked up during FY07. The Human Resource and Institutional Capacity 
Development Agency (HIDA) was established as a coordinating agency in November 2004 and a Multi- 
Sector Capacity Building Program was launched in October 2005. H IDA has now recruited qualified 
s t a f f and i s fully operational. Implementation o f public sector reforms has progressed with a functional 
review o f six core ministries and a comparative pay study. The Bank provided support to sector 
ministries but progress has been slow due to lack o f overall strategic engagement by ministries. The 
project further facilitated skills audit o f public, private and c iv i l soc ie t ies which w i l l culminate in the 
development o f a national skills development policy. The coordination mechanism o f public sector 
reforms remains weak and the Bank through its policy dialogue encouraged the Government to improve 
the functioning coordination mechanism across government, 

75 

68. 
Service delivery decentralized from central ministries to district and sector level. The Bank 
supported Decentralization and Community Development Pro jec t (DCDP) facilitated the capacity 
development o f l o c a l governments. The project tripled its geographic coverage since effectiveness and 
established a Sector Wide Approach (SWAP) for decentralization. When the Territorial Reform Program 
in early 2006 consolidated Rwanda’s districts from 106 to 30, i t played a key role i n financing orientation 
programs in a l l 30 district offices. A l l districts have created five-year development plans and 100 percent 
o f the participating districts have completed training in basic financial management, procurement and 
M&E. Rwanda’s service delivery has been decentralized and the size o f the central administration has 
been reduced from 2,000 staff to 500 in 2006. The Bank has been successful in strengthening, 
empowering and improving accountability o f loca l governments to communities through community 
development initiative and income generating activities for the poor. 

V. Bank Performance 

69. 
The CAS was implemented under the base case scenario in the range of US$250-$317 
million, including about US$lOO million in I D A grants. During FY03-06, 8 out o f 7 operations 
planned under the base case scenarios were delivered. The second phase o f Rura l Sector Support Project 
(RSSP Il) was not delivered as planned instead the Urgent E lec tr ic i ty and Rehabilitation Project (US25 
m i l l ion) was approved. I n addition, under the I S N strategy, four more projects were delivered during 
FY07 with a total amount o f U S $ 7 1 million. 

70. 
The Bank successfully shifted its choice o f instruments during the CAS period toward 
increased budget support. The Bank has responded flexibly in assisting the Government’s development 
needs and moved increasingly towards budget support. As discussed above, the implementation o f the 
PRSC/G series has been successful with achievements far exceeding expectations. Bank internally i t 
succeeded in creating an effective multi-sector team and externally i t built foundations fo r increased 
donor harmonization and strengthened cross-sectoral linkages. In addition, investment lending through 
demand-driven projects like the Ru ra l Sector Support Project (RTSP), and the Ru ra l Water Supply and 
Sanitation Project (RWSP) played an important role especially with respect to capacity constraints at the 
loca l level. The Bank also showed flexibility and the in case o f the Urgent E lec tr ic i ty and Power Project 
facilitated Board approval within only six months to successfully address the emergency power shortage 
situation. 

71. 

The Bank has delivered more analytical work than planned initially but dissemination has 
been limited. Annex 2 shows the broad range o f AAA undertaken by the Bank. This increase in AAA 
was consistent with the IEG CAE 2004 recommendations that called for more AAA to enhance 
development effectiveness. However, the Bank’s work was not always properly aligned with the 
operations or sequenced properly. For example, the Country Economic Memorandum (CEM) was only 
delivered towards the end and-as 
originally planned-at 
the beginning o f the CAS period. The CEM 
was delayed due to various activities needed to support the move toward budget support. Furthermore, 
s ince many analytic products are informal to respond to shifting government needs, it i s difficult to get an 
accurate evaluation o f actual number o f AAA and their impact. However, as the above assessment tried 
to show, the Bank’s analytical work i s influential in framing policy dialogue in Rwanda. Going forward, 
ana ly t ica l work should be utilized more effectively to broaden the development dialogue with government 
and development partners. 

Quality o f the Portfolio: 

72. 
The overall implementation o f the portfolio during the CAS period has been satisfactory (11 
projects) with only one project (Public Sector Capacity Building) rated as moderately satisfactory. 

76 

Am o n g the reg iona l pro jec ts a f fec t ing Rwanda two projects have been ra ted as modera te ly satisfactory 
w h i l e one pro jec t has been ra ted as satisfactory. However , Rwanda ’s p o r t f o l i o per formance58 im p r o v e d 
f r om 4 (ou t o f 6 ) percent prob lems at risk in 2003 t o 2.5 percent at risk in 2004. There was one p rob lem 
p ro jec t (Rura l Sector Support Pro jec t) and one p ro jec t at risk due t o several f lags (Emergency 
Demobilization and Reintegration Pro jec t) . 

73. 
Rwanda’s portfolio improved significantly. The p o r t f o l i o q u a l i t y was evaluated in December 
2004 and since then considerable focus was g iven o n imp lemen ta t ion and imp rovemen t o f the q u a l i t y o f 
the p o r t f o l i o . Several components o f the p rob lem pro jec ts were re-designed, w h i c h led remova l o f 
several risk flags. Each p ro jec t has a coun try record f l a g except e-Rwanda and Urgent E lec tr ic i ty and 
Rehabilitation (UER) p ro jec t with cu r ren t ly two f lags (effectiveness de lay and M&E respec t ive ly) . O n 
the ove ra l l program, Rwanda ’s p o r t f o l i o has been stable during the C A S p e r i o d in “realism, “ p r o - a c t i ~ i t y ~ ~ 
(bo th at 100 percent) and disbursement r a t i o (10.8 percent compared t o 5.4 percent A f r i c a average). This 
re f lec ts accelerated imp lemen ta t ion o f pro jec ts especially at decen tra l ized leve ls . The progress i s due t o

The quality o f procurement and capacity remained one o f the major challenges fo r project 
implementation during the CAS period. This was due to : (i) l a c k o f unde rs tand ing o f the Bank ’s 
procuremen t process ; (ii) limited capac i ty o f s t a f f in charge o f procurement; (iii) absence o f general 
consensus tha t p rocu remen t i s a necessary t o o l f o r successful p ro jec t imp lemen ta t ion ; and (iv) weak 
comm i tmen t t o im p r o v e the o v e r a l l q u a l i t y o f procuremen t practices. A 2 0 0 6 C o u n t r y P o r t f o l i o

In add i t ion t o p rocu remen t issues, d i f f i c u l t adm in is tra t ive procedures and processes resu l ted in s low

Aid Coordination and Harmonization 

78. 
The Bank worked effectively w ith i t s development partners. Rw a n d a i s one o f the p i l o t 
countries f o r budget suppo r t ha rmon iza t ion in i t ia ted during the Strategic Pa r tne rsh ip o f A f r i c a (SPA) 
mee t ing in 2002. In 2003, the Gove rnmen t and budge t support donors (AfDB, DfID, EU, S I D A and the 
Bank) signed the Par tnersh ip F r am ew o r k f o r Ha rmon iza t ion and Alignment o f B u d g e t Suppor t and 

78 

PRSG-I was the first budget support operation prepared under this framework. This framework has 
improved donor coordination, decreased overlap and reduced transaction costs for the Government. 

7 9 . 
On harmonization, the Bank supported PRSG facilitated the development o f a calendar to 
align future donor reviews and support with the government’s PRSP and Budget Cycle. Donors and 

the Government worked in partnership with the Government on the development o f sector strategies and 
MTEF which served as a basis towards SWAP. Bi-annual budget execution review and jo in t public 
financial management review i s institutionalized. A Joint sector review which informs the joint budget 
review was established in 2002. The education and health sec tors have been active, and the agriculture 
and water sector made tremendous progress over 2005 and 2006. The Bank also supported joint 
analytical work. The Financial Accountability and Review Action Plan (FARAP) was jointly completed 
by DfiD and the World Bank. The Bank used its comparative advantage in the areas o f procurement 
reform and prepared the Country Procurement Issue Paper (CPIP) which a l l the donors endorsed and 
shared the f i n a l results. The World Bank i s represented in 12 o f the 1 5 sectors in Rwanda. The World 
Bank i s the largest multilateral donor in Rwanda, and plays an important role in the Development Partner 
Group. The launch o f the EDPRS has forced the Bank to play a more enhanced and significant role in 
additional sectors. Currently the Bank co chairs the Rural Development Cluster, the Energy Sector 
Working Group, and the Governance Working Group. 

The Ro l e o f I F C 

80. 

The ro l e o f I F C during the CAS period was limited, but has been increasingly growing over 

the last few months. IFC provided technical assistance in collaboration with the Bank’s Competitiveness 
and Enterprise Development Project (CEDP) through the Rwanda Investment Climate Reform advisory 
project particularly on commercial law reform, capacity building activities o f REIPA, promoting public- 
private dialogue and supporting the government’s Doing Business (DB) reform action plan. In addition 
IFC also provided technical assistance in collaboration with the CEDP project in the area’of privatization, 
small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and the financial and industrial sectors. LFC jointly with the PSD 
department o f the Bank and the Development Marketplace has supported the design and implementation 
o f a business plan competition in Rwanda, through a collaborative e f fo r t with the private sector federation 
and the Rwanda Development Bank. IFC i s working closely with IDA in exploring the possibility o f 
participation and investment in: (i) Lake K ivu Methane Gas Project; (ii) an expansion o f Intraspeed SA 
Rwanda L td (ISARL), a freight and forwarding company operating in the Great Lakes Region o f Eastern 
Africa (US$5 million); (iii) financing to potential investors that may be interested in buying hotels; and 
(v) the privatization o f Rwanda Air. However, IFC’s role in the private sector over the last few months 
has increased substantially. IFC has provided a portion o f its earning to ID A and this i s being provided to 
Rwanda for policy-based support to private sector-led economic growth, driven by agriculture, promotion 
o f exports, financial sector deepening, and expanded delivery o f public services by the private sector. 

The Ro l e o f M I G A 

81. 
MIGA’s effort in Rwanda has complemented the Bank Group’s strategy o f accelerating private 
sector-led growth in the country. During the CAS period, M IGA undertook an assessment to assist 
Rwanda in creating a national investment and trade promotion capability in consultation with the Bank’s 
department and recommendations were made in Rwanda Investment Authority. This led to establishment 
of Rwanda Investment and Export Promotion Agency (RIEPA). 

82. 

Rwanda has continued to develop rapidly. Despite many development challenges remain that can 
be addressed in the new CAS. As the Bank considers how i t can help the country in the next four years i t 

VI. Lessons Learned 

7 9 

shou ld cons ider f o l l o w i n g key lessons g o i n g fo rwa rd : 

8 3 . 

The Bank needs to adopt a realistic and results oriented approach. W h i l e the Bank ’s strategy 
was a l igned with the PRSP, some o f the targets were o v e r l y amb i t ious and n o t rea l is t ic . T h e fu tu re 
strategy shou ld focus o n resu l ts and m o n i t o r i n g o f ou tcomes tha t are feas ib le based o n coun t ry c o n d i t i o n 
and a v a i l a b i l i t y o f IDA resources. The Bank ’s p rog ram needs t o become mo re e f fec t ive and m o r e 
focused th rough se lec t iv i ty , be t ter a l ignmen t with c o u n t r y p o l i c i e s and ins t i tu t ions and stronger 
co l labo ra t ion with governmen t and o ther donors o n ana ly t ica l w o r k . The PRSG ins trumen t seems t o be 
well-suited t o ach ieve these ob jec t ives . 

8 4 . 

Project Design needs to be better aligned on the ground. Capac i ty building e f fo r ts need t o be 
coup led with e f fo r ts that address broader i n s t i t u t i o n a l re fo rms and be t ter coo rd ina t ion among sectors t o 
unde rp in successful imp lemen ta t ion o f capac i ty building programs o n the ground. 
I n s t i t u t i o n a l 
assessments shou ld pay greater a t ten t ion t o i d e n t i f y i n g the means t o increase the capac i ty o f cen tra l and 
l o c a l governmen t . Fu tu re B a n k operations need t o exp lo re va r ious means o f w o r k i n g in par tnersh ip with 
P ro jec t Imp lemen ta t ion Units (P IU ) t o strengthen capac i ty o n the ground . T h e B a n k needs t o w o r k in a 
mu l t i -sec to r env i ronmen t t o build capac i ty in order t o im p r o v e the pe r fo rmance o f the p u b l i c sector m o r e 
e f f i c i e n t l y . 

8 5 . 

Implementation and pace o f reform need to be sequenced o r aligned. The experience during 
the C A S p e r i o d shows tha t Governmen t ’s comm i tmen t t o r e f o rm con t r ibu ted p o s i t i v e l y t o C A S 
outcomes, demons tra t ing tha t progress can be made under l o w capac i ty . Howeve r , imp lemen ta t ion of 
re fo rms in some sectors was e i t h e r t o o q u i c k o r s lowe r than expected. This had a m i x e d impac t o n 
effectiveness o f the ove ra l l program . Therefore, the next C A S shou ld focus on re fo rms tha t are rea l is t ic 
w h i c h the B a n k can in f luence and the Gove rnmen t can de l ive r . T h e u rgency with w h i c h the reforms 
shou ld take p lace needs t o r e f l e c t mo re c lose ly the r e a l i t y o n the ground . 

86 . 

The Bank needs to continue to wo rk closely w ith development partners in fostering the 
harmonization and alignment agenda. During the C A S pe r iod , the B a n k made s ign i f ican t progress in 
dono r ha rmon iza t ion th rough budge t suppor t operations, j o i n t budge t and sector rev iews and j o i n t 
ana ly t ica l w o r k . Thus, the B a n k shou ld fos ter co l labo ra t ive assistance, b o t h at the coun t ry l e v e l and in 
the sectors and im p r o v e the d i v i s i o n o f labo r among deve lopmen t par tners . Compara t ive advantage and 
se lec t iv i ty need t o be a key c r i t e r i o n in the fu tu re strategy. The B a n k w i l l need t o p rov ide leadership in 
key areas with the imp lemen ta t ion o f the ED PR S and in coo rd ina t ion and a l ignmen t as a who le .
