C O U N T R Y PARTNERSH IP STRATEGY F O R FY09 -FY12 
THE REPUBL IC O F C R O A T I A 

Executive Summary 

1 . 

Croatia’s overarching priority i s to enter the EU w ith a competitive and growing economy 
and the institutional capacity to meet the demands of membership. This en ta i ls reducing Croatia’s 
external vulnerability, completing its transition to a market economy, fostering greater competitiveness, 
and achieving convergence with EU income levels. These priorities are shared across the political 
spectrum and society, albeit with varying degrees o f emphasis, and form the basis o f the Bank’s 
assistance to Croatia. 

2 . 

Croatia showed strong economic performance during the past few years. 
In 2004-07, 
economic growth was close to 5 percent and in f la t ion remained low, at around 3 percent. This year w i l l 
likely see a somewhat lower growth rate and higher inflation largely due to the soaring global food and o i l 
prices. While sound macroeconomic management has been a main contributor to the success o f the past 
years, implementation o f structural reforms has been uneven. 

3 . 

The government, led by Prime Minister Ivo Sanader’s Croatian Democratic Union Party 
(HDZ), received a second mandate at the end of last year. This provides an opportunity to consolidate 
and accelerate economic reforms, and to complete the wide-ranging legal and institutional changes 
required by the country’s EU accession. 

4. 
The goal of this Country Partnership Strategy (CPS), which spans FY09-FY12 , i s to support 
the completion of Croatia’s EU accession process, the rap id convergence o f its income level with 
that o f current EU member states in a fiscally, socially and environmentally sustainable fashion, 
and a decent quality o f l i f e for Croatia’s citizens. This overarching goal i s fully in line with the 
government’s priorities expressed in various government programs. In order to support the achievement 
o f this goal, the Bank Group program w i l l aim at contributing in four areas: 
(i) 
sustaining macroeconomic stability; 
strengthening private sector-led growth and accelerating convergence with the EU; 
improving the quality and efficiency in the soc ia l sectors; and 
increasing the sustainability o f long-term development. 

(ii) 
(iii) 

(iv) 

5 . 

The EU accession agenda w i l l remain a cross-cutting theme 
in the design and 
implementation o f the Bank Group’s program. In the selection and design o f operations, primary 
consideration w i l l be given to how the proposed project supports Croatia’s EU accession agenda. In the 
case o f soc ia l sectors where there i s no EU ucquis, consideration w i l l also be given to how projects 
complement the EU accession efforts. This assessment w i l l be made together with the authorities and in 
close collaboration with the EC. Project components that enhance Croatia’s capacity to absorb EU funds, 
especially following accession, w i l l have high priority. 

6 . 
The CPS envisages an indicative base case lending envelope o f about USN.0-1.4 billion over 
the four year period. The base case lending program would only include non-policy based operations. 
This program could be complemented with a se r ies o f one-tranche DPLs, especially in support o f reforms 
in the public sector and to improve Croatia’s competitiveness, as opportunities arise and government 
commitment i s ensured. With DPLs, under an upside scenario, lending could reach US$1.4-1.8 billion 
during the CPS period. 
Traditional IBRD loans are likely to be supplemented by other IBRD 
instruments, such as disaster and catastrophe risk insurance, catastrophe risk deferred drawdown option, 
sub-national lending and debt management products. The lending program w i l l be based on and 

1 

Croatia: Country Partnership Strategy for FY09-FY 12 

complemented by analytical work, particularly in the areas o f public expenditure reform, governance, 
investment climate and climate change. Over time, the Bank w i l l also explore possible fee-for-service 
arrangements to support a broader agenda o f economic work. 

7 . 
The design and implementation of the program w i l l be demand-driven and flexible. As 
envisaged under the Bank Group’s Middle-Income Countries agenda, the CPS represents a broad 
framework in which the Bank Group can flexibly respond to emerging priorities in a timely fashion. The 
program i s defined for the first two years o f the CPS period, and w i l l be adjusted to respond to Croatia’s 
emerging needs at the time of the CPS Progress Report. 

8 . 
Close collaboration w ith I F C i s envisaged. The Bank and IFC w i l l work together to support 
private sector investments and PPP solutions in infrastructure in particular. 
IFC’s focus on post- 
privatization restructuring in priority sectors such as information and communication technology, 
construction materials and agribusiness w i l l complement the Bank’s efforts to support enterprise 
privatization under the PAL program. IFC’s investments helping domestic companies to increase their 
competitiveness and efficiency as well supporting strong and growing local companies to expand into 
higher-value-added products and/or to invest in neighboring countries, w i l l contribute to the 
competitiveness agenda supported by both the Bank and IFC. Finally, IFC’s support for local companies 
to improve their corporate governance, environmental standards and soc ia l standards w i l l contribute to the 
broader Bank and IFC agenda to support Croatia’s preparation for EU accession. 

9 . 
There are three main sources of r i s k s to the success o f the planned program: Croatia’s 
external vulnerability, continued uneven reform performance, and implementation capacity 
weaknesses. With an external debt-to-GDP ratio o f 95.7 percent in USD t e rm s (or 89.1 percent o f GDP 
in EUR terms’) and a current account deficit o f 8 .6 percent at end-2007, Croatia remains exposed to 
unfavorable external developments. Notwithstanding the above, the country has weathered the financial 
turbulence that followed the collapse o f the sub-prime market in the US. This shows that Croatia’s 
economic fundamentals have improved over time, i t s EU accession process i s seen as a solid anchor by 
external financiers and that macroeconomic policies have remained largely on track. Nonetheless, i t i s 
likely that reform performance w i l l remain uneven. This i s in part because some o f the reforms, like the 
restructuring o f railways and shipyards, are politically difficult to implement, and in part because some o f 
the other reforms, such as the reform o f the judiciary and public administration, are complex and take 
time. Finally, there i s also uneven capacity in the administration to design and implement policies and 
projects. 

10. 
I n the forthcoming period, Croatia expects to complete its EU accession negotiations and 
get ready for fu l l membership. The Bank has gained a wealth o f experience in supporting candidate 
countries in their l a s t phase o f preparation for EU membership, and this experience i s widely appreciated 
in Croatia. The Bank i s ready to accompany Croatia on its journey to a socially and environmentally 
sustainable, more competitive economy fully integrated into the EU. 

1 1. 

’ 

Guidance i s sought from the Executive Directors on the following issues in particular: 
(i) Are Croatia’s development challenges adequately reflected in the CPS, taking into account 
the country’s EU accession process? 
(ii) Are the priorities o f engagement, planned instruments, and flexibility o f CPS design 
appropriate for the challenges described? 
( i i i ) Are risks to the success o f the program properly identified? 

The two ratios differ due to the end-of-period exchange rate used for debt conversion and the period-average rate used for GDP conversion 
as per the convention followed by the Croatian authorities.

C O U N T R Y PARTNERSH IP STRATEGY 
THE R E P U B L I C OF C R O A T I A 

I. Country Context 

A . Political and Social Context 

1. 
A new coalition government led by the Croatian Democratic Union Pa r ty (HDZ) was 
endorsed by the Croatian Parliament in January 2008. The coalition i s based on an a l l iance forged 
with the Peasants’ Party (HSS) and the Soc ia l Liberal Party (HSLS ) . The new government’s strategy, as 
described in the Program o f the Government o f the Republic o f Croatia for the 2008-201 1 Mandate, 
emphasizes undertaking structural reforms that would lead to sustained and regionally balanced growth. 
The Program’s goals are to achieve and sustain macroeconomic stability with rea l growth at 7 percent, 
reduce unemployment to 7 percent and balance the central budget by 2010. To achieve these goals, the 
government plans to: (i) complete judicial and public administration reforms, (ii) complete the 
privatization process and seriously tackle corruption, ( i i i ) intensify development o f SMEs and increase 
agricultural competitiveness while pursuing a balanced development o f a l l regions, ( iv ) foster the tourism 
sector with further development o f infrastructure, and (v) promote a knowledge-based society. 

2. 
After Croatia was granted candidate status in June 2004, formal EU accession negotiations 
were launched in October 2005. To date, Croatia has opened 20 out o f 3 3 negotiations chapters o f the 
acquis communautaire with the European Commission, and provisionally closed two-Education 
and 
Culture, and Sc ience and Research. 
I n its 2007 Progress Report, the EU has indicated that the 
government w i l l need to invest considerable e f f o r t s towards judicial and public administration reforms, 
competition and anti-corruption policies as well as environment and agriculture. The EC announced 
earlier this year that Croatia i s well placed to conclude i t s accession negotiations by November 2009. 
Preparations for NATO membership are also on track; Croatia received an invitation to jo in NATO at the 
Ap r i l 2008 summit in Bucharest.’ 

3 . 
The 2006 poverty analysis3 reveals that poverty in Croatia i s relatively low and shallow, but 
persistent since the late 1990s. Four percent o f the population lives on l e s s than US$4.30 a day4, and 1 1 
percent lives on or less than US$10 a day’ which represents Croatia’s absolute poverty line. About one 
percent o f the population faces severe deprivation.6 Given the relatively low levels o f poverty, a targeted 
transfer o f about 0.7 percent o f GDP would have lifted Croatia’s poor out o f absolute poverty. Income 
inequality, measured by the Gini coefficient, was 0.25 in 2004, which i s on par with the average o f 
advanced transition countries. 

4. 
Unemployment rates dropped to historically low levels and employment increased to 57 
percent’ in 2007. Nevertheless, Croatia’s employment rate remains lower than that of European 
economies and well below the Lisbon target o f 70 percent. The employment figures reflect a relatively 
low labor force participation ra te among the working age population (63.1 percent) and a relatively high 
unemployment rate (9.6 percent). Furthermore, there i s a high incidence o f long-term unemployment. 
About 60 percent o f Croatia’s unemployed remain without a job for more than a year, with weakening 
prospects for re-entering the labor market and leading to soc ia l exclusion. 

On July 9, 2008, Croatia signed the Accession Protocol for jo in ing NATO . 
The analysis was carried out under the Croatia L iv ing Standard and Regional Development Study (LSA) World Bank Report No. 37992-HR 
(February 7,2007) and based on t h e 2002-2004 household budget surveys.

Primorje-Gorski kotar, -have GDP per capita above the 
national average, in addition to Zagreb. The lowest 
GDP per capita i s in the Slavonski Brod-Posavina 
County, which i s 46.2 percent below the average.

6. 
Croat ia has enjoyed robust growth (o f close to 5 percent) w i th low inflation (on average 
below 3 percent) in the past few years, largely due to successful economic transformation and the 
start o f EU accession negotiations. Real GDP growth amounted to an average o f 4.5 percent in 2004-06 
and accelerated to 5.6 percent in 2007. Growth has been underpinned primarily by an increase in gross 
fixed investment and personal consumption. Personal consumption was fuelled by expansion o f 
government transfers to households and pensioners’ debt repayment, as well as higher employment and 
robust credit growth. Industry, retail trade and financial intermediation have been key contributors to 
GDP growth. Growth diagnostics for the 2002-2006 period confirmed that major contribution to growth 
(50 percent) came from capital accumulation, with limited contribution from TFP growth in recent years 
(30 percent) and even less from labor (as high unemployment rates and relatively low labor participation 
rates have led to low employment rates). Production function-based estimates suggest that Croatia’s 
potential growth i s close to 5 percent. 
Inflation remained modest, helped by central bank efforts to 
maintain exchange rate stability and government f i s c a l consolidation efforts. However, inflationary 
trends are reasserting themselves as a result o f soaring global food and o i l prices, despite somewhat 
weaker pressure on the demand side. 

7. 
Fiscal consolidation has taken place in the past few years to arrest rap id growth in public 
debt and create room for increased competitiveness through potential reduction o f the high tax burden.* 
The f isca l deficit declined from 4.8 percent o f GDP in 2004 to 2.3 percent in 2007. The 2008 budget 
enacted in March 2008 showed the deficit at around the same level as in 2007. The general government 
debt-to-GDP ratio rose slightly from 43.2 percent in 2004 to 43 .8 percent in 2005, and then declined to 3 8 
percent by 2007.’ Further fiscal consolidation i s needed, given that public expenditures are high by 
international standards” - at 48.9 percent o f GDP in 2007. The economy’s high degree o f euroization 
poses a risk to macroeconomic stability and leaves the government with l i t t l e room to maneuver in the 
event o f shocks. Hence, sound f i s c a l policy w i l l be crucial to arresting external vulnerabilities and 
maintaining Croatia’s macroeconomic stability over the medium term. Furthermore, reaching a balanced 

The average tax burden for the new E U member states (EUIO) was around 34 percent o f GDP i n 2006 as opposed to 40 
percent o f GDP i n Croatia, which was on par w i th the EU27 . 
The public debt-to-GDP ratio, which includes a l l guarantees and HBOR debt, rose slightly from 5 1.7 percent i n 2004 to 52.3 
percent i n 2005, and then declined to 47.8 percent by 2007. 
The average general government spending for E U new member states (EU10) was about 39.8 percent o f GDP i n 2006. 
However, when making a comparison w i th the E U countries, i t should be noted that the Croatian GDP has not yet been fu l ly 
corrected for the informal economy.

budget by 2010 - an important government goal - would require robust frontloaded expenditure-

A tightened monetary policy has helped stabilize domestic credit expansion, driven by rising 
corporate sector activity and shift in government borrowing towards the domestic market. In 
addition to maintaining price stability and stabilizing the exchange rate, in 2007, the Croatian National 
Bank (CNB) remained focused on measures to curb external debt growth and banks’ credit growth, to 
reduce external vulnerability. During 2007, the CNB continued to apply instruments o f marginal and 
special obligatory reserves. 
I t also introduced additional administrative and prudential measures to 
control the growth and quality o f domestic bank placements, respectively, with a credit ceiling introduced 
in early 2007 (which stipulated compulsory purchase o f CNB bills on credit growth in excess o f 12 
percent per annum). This ceiling was further tightened to 3 percent during the second half o f 2007 given 
that credits had already expanded by 9 percent in the f i r s t half o f 2007. The CNB’s restrictive monetary 
policy has continued in 2008 and w i l l most likely continue in 2009. 

9. 
Monetary developments have been in line with the CNB’s goal of limiting credit expansion 
and the accompanying r ise in debt. Despite commercial banks’ strong credit activities, bank placement 
to the non-banking sector slowed down from 22.9 percent in 2006 to 15.0 percent in 2007. Household 
loans increased by 18 percent, while signs are emerging o f a squeeze-out o f corporate sector loans, in 
particular SMEs, as large enterprises diverted to direct borrowing from abroad. The euroization o f the 
economy i s limiting options for in teres t rate policy and placing high expectations on a stable exchange 
rate. Deposits denominated in foreign currency account for two-thirds o f total deposits, almost equal to 
the ratio o f foreign currency and foreign currency denominated loans to overall loans, and about 
90 percent o f the banking system’s foreign assets. The large but declining share o f foreign exchange- 
linked loans to unhedged borrowers (from 77 percent o f total loans in 2004 to about 61 percent in 2007) 
exposes banks to indirect foreign exchange risk. However, accounting and prudential standards 
combined with sound risk management and banking supervision have assured confidence in the banking 
system and appear to have prevented immediate vulnerability threats or sudden reversals in capital flows. 

10. 
The current account deficit continued to widen, mostly due to rising oil and commodity 
prices as well as goods imports stimulated by credit growth. Although public sector savings 
improved, private external liabilities have been growing fas t . After reaching 8.6 percent in 2007, the 
CAD to GDP ratio i s expected to reach 8.8 percent in 2008, and subsequently narrow due to slower 
domestic demand and a policy m ix aimed at avoiding excessive overheating and disorderly adjustments in 
external balances. On the financing side, the share o f non-debt creating inflows” increased from 5 
percent o f GDP in 2006 to 5.3 percent in 2007, reflecting a r i s e in equity capital. With monetary policy 
mainly focused on financial and price stability, efforts to address external risks w i l l depend largely on 
fiscal policy. 

11 . 
Although Croatia has so far felt limited effects from the global financial turbulence,” the 
comparably large stock o f external debt remains a source of potential vulnerability, increasing the 
speed and magnitude with which adverse external financial shocks may be transmitted. External 
debt in US$ terms increased from 89.8 percent o f GDP in 2006 to 95.7 percent by the end o f 2007, more 
than doubling since 2001. External debt in EUR terms increased from 85 .5 percent o f GDP in 2006 to 
89.1 percent in 2007, due to the depreciation o f the US d01lar.l~ Government external debt amounted to

l 3 

FDI minus intercompany lending plus por t fo l io investments. 
Spreads on sovereign debt rose by 150 basis points and stock prices slumped by around 30 percent in Q 1 2008. 
There was an upward adjustment o f the external debt-to-GDP ratio in 2007 by 1.4 percentage points (or 1.3 p.p. in EUR 
terms), due to a change in the external debt reporting system in line with EU requirements.

19.2 percent o f GDP at the end o f 2007, while domestic banks and other sectors (private and public 
corporate sector, non-bank financial institutions, and households) owed foreign creditors the equivalent o f 
25 .5 and 51.0 percent o f GDP, respectively. Among other sectors, the largest share was due to the 
borrowing by private sector companies (60 percent) and non-bank financial institutions (around 20 
percent)14. Government debt declined as a result o f f i s c a l consolidation efforts and a shift to domestic 
financing, which continued in 2008. Short-term external debt remains low at 13.2 percent o f total 
external debt and accounts for approximately 50 percent o f foreign exchange reserves. Croatia’s reserves 
position i s comfortable (close to six months o f imports) mostly as a result o f strong FD I inflows over the 
last two years (above 8 percent o f GDP p.a.) which more than financed the current account deficit. 

12. 
Positive developments in the real sector w i l l likely continue during the CPS period with 
economic growth expected to average around five percent i n the medium term The 2008-2012 
growth projections, as described in section III G, are underpinned by (i) the assumption o f Croatia’s EU 
accession by 20 1 1 ; (ii) improved macroeconomic stability, which would stimulate private investment, 
particularly greenfield investments; (iii) stronger export performance; and (iv) narrowing public sector 
size which w i l l create new opportunities for private sector growth in l i n e with the Program o f the 
Government o f the Republic o f Croatia for the 2008-201 1 Mandate. 

11. Croatia’s Key Development Challenges 

A. Sustaining Macroeconomic Stability 

F igure 2: Cross-Country M a c r o Comparison, 2006 

1 3 . 
Croatia’s large public sector poses one o f the main challenges to sustained growth. Public 
expenditure accounts for nearly half o f the GDP, some nine percentage points above the average for 
EU10, reducing the f i s c a l space to finance EU accession  requirement^.'^ Rationalization o f the public 
sector wage b i l l and employment, subsidies 
(especially railways and shipyards), social 
benefits, and health spending would help ease 
the f i s c a l pressure, albeit presenting potential 
political challenges 
for 
the government. 
Further f isca l consolidation i s required due to 
Croatia’s relatively high tax burden: taxes-to- 
GDP ratio i s above 40 percent, which puts i t on 
par with the EU15, but approximately 8 
percentage points above the EU 10. Given that 
the EU integration process, a key government 
objective, brings with i t adjustment costs, 
accelerating the momentum for f i s c a l reforms 
has become even more important.

14. 
Prudent fiscal policies can help ease Croatia’s large current account deficit and external debt. 
The government has already taken steps to address risks by reducing deficits. In the long term, however, 
f isca l reforms aimed at reducing public expenditures w i l l be c r i t i c a l to containing Croatia’s vulnerability. 
Enhancing the efficiency o f public expenditure management, in particular moving from input budgeting 
towards performance-based budgeting, could help the f isca l consolidation process.

The gross external debt o f the broadly defined public sector, which includes the general government, public enterprises and 
mixed-ownership enterprises stood at around 27 % o f GDP at the end o f 2007, according to the Croatian National Bank. 
Croatia did not correct i t s o f f ic ia l GDP figures fu l ly for non-observed economy, as opposed to a l l E U member states. B y 
assuming an increase in GDP numbers by around 1 5 percent, the level o f general government spending w i l l s t i l l remain 
above the EU lO level by 3 percentage points o f GDP, but below the EU15 level.

Croatia: Country Partnership Strategy for FY09-FY 12 

15 . 
Rationalization o f public expenditure w i l l require serious efforts to reform Croatia’s health 
sector, social systems and state aid policies. Croatia’s health outcomes are better than in many countries 
at similar income levels, but these results were achieved at a high cost. Today, continued deficits affect 
the sustainability o f the system. The stock o f hospital and the national health insurance fund (HZZO) 
arrears have been increasing s ince 2004, exceeding 1 percent o f GDP by the end o f 2006. The large 
benefits and widespread exemptions introduced during the early growth years have been politically 
difficult to r o l l back. The main challenge in the medium term w i l l be to maintain and improve health 
outcomes while achieving a steady level o f public spending under a sound f isca l policy framework.

Croatia: Country Partnership Strategy for FY09-FY 12 

Similar issues face Croatia’s soc ia l benefits system, which o f fers more than one hundred programs and i s 
hindered by weak targeting efficiency, a complicated and costly administration, and disincentives for 
labor market participation - a l l o f which have contributed to poverty and inequality in the country. An 
aging population and limited financial resources have made social system reform unavoidable. Railway 
and shipyards restructuring efforts would also need to be tackled with due diligence, not only to promote 
f i s c a l stability, but to adhere to state aid rules and avoid sudden adjustment shocks in the future. 

16. 
Given the Croatian economy’s high degree o f euroization, its financial sector remains 
vulnerable to interest and exchange rate r isks . Exposure to interest or exchange ra te fluctuations 
could raise the cost o f domestic lending, and in turn, constrain private debtors’ ability to service their 
loans. With loans to firms and households denominated in or indexed to foreign currency and largely 
unhedged, credit risk stemming from foreign currency exposes Croatia’s banking system to external 
financial shocks. The Croatian National Bank has taken several measures to control risks by discouraging 
foreign borrowing by banks, monitoring foreign exchange exposures o f bank c l ien ts , and strengthening 
supervision o f banks. Further efforts in strengthening supervision o f the whole financial sector and 
addressing home-host relations are needed. Structural reforms supported by the PAL program can further 
mitigate these vulnerabilities by facilitating deeper f i s c a l consolidation to (i) reduce the public and 
external debt burdens, and (ii) shrink the public sector to allow for private sector activity and attract more 
investments that are less dependent on debt-creating inflows. 

17. 
While macroeconomic sustainability i s needed fo r growth, faster growth leading to higher 
future fiscal revenues i s in turn needed fo r macroeconomic sustainability. Hence, strengthening the 
microeconomic foundations of growth i s o f critical importance. There are “sources” o f additional 
growth that Croatia could tap into, through undertaking measures to: (i) increase labor participation by 
addressing the disincentives for workers’ participation in the labor market while reducing restrictions to 
f a c i l i t a t e the adjustment o f the labor force to the business cycle; contain the cost o f labor and address 
skills mismatches through vocational education and training, and life-long learning; ( i i ) enhance to ta l 
factor productivity by continuing enterprise restructuring, further reforming product market regulation, 
improving the corporate governance regime, streamlining bankruptcy conditions, and reducing the 
administrative obstacles to business; (iii) deepen trade integration by promoting export-oriented FD I and 
developing the supply o f exportable goods with expansion o f trade related services (standards and quality, 
knowledge o f foreign markets) and the reduction o f logistics costs; and (iv) foster technological progress 
by expanding private R&D, improving conditions for the collaboration between universities and industry, 
and enabling the start up o f science-based companies, as further described in the next section. 

B. Strengthening Pr ivate Sector-Led Growth and Accelerating Convergence with EU 

18 . 
Croatia’s private sector share o f GDP has increased from 60 to 70 percent during the 2003- 
2007 period, though i t remains much lower than that o f the EU10. Weakness in the functioning o f 
the judiciary, bureaucratic red tape, unfinished privatization and so f t budget constraints have limited 
en te rp r ise restructuring and new business creation, and constrained growth. To accelerate growth and 
achieve faster convergence with EU27 per capita income levels, a key priority w i l l be to improve the 
investment climate and promote private sector-led growth. 

19. 
According to the 2008 Doing Business Report, Croatia i s among the top ten reformers fo r 
the second year in a row, with marked improvements in starting and closing a business, registering 
property and facilitating access to credit. Croatia ranked 97 out o f 178 countries on the overall ease o f 
doing business, significantly up from 124 the previous year. However, i t ranks far behind EU countries 
with similar income levels (Slovakia 32, Poland 74). High taxation levels, inflexible labor market 
regulations and a cumbersome licensing system continue to pose obstacles to operating in the formal

sector. 
Indeed, the size o f the informal sector in Croatia-at

20. 
The Wo r ld Economic Forum's Competitiveness Reports 2005-2007 ranked inefficient public 
administration at the top o f the list o f barriers f o r doing business i n Croatia.I6 The proliferation o f 
agencies and subordinate entities with operational autonomy and revenue-raising capabilities i s placing a 
huge burden on coordination and management, compromising value-for-money and quality o f service 
delivery. Adequate public administration capacities constitutes one o f the key requirements for EU 
membership and the experience o f EU8I7 suggests that public administration reforms w i l l require a long 
haul effort supported by soundly performing systems across government combined with professional, 
merit-based, and independent c iv i l service. In 2005, Croatia adopted a new c iv i l service law aimed at 
introducing merit-based recruitment, the professionalization and depoliticization o f c iv i l service and 
greater transparency and accountability in the public sector.

Access to skilled labor was considered a "major" o r "very severe" obstacle f o r growth by 
almost 10 percent o f the entrepreneurs in 2005. Croatia has one o f the lowest employment rates 
among European c o ~ n t r i e s . ' ~ This situation stems partly from social welfare and pension programs that 
discourage individuals to participate in the labor markets. Also, demographic projections indicate that the 
s ize o f the economically active age group w i l l start to decline by 2010. Taken together, these trends 
imply that demand for labor may soon outpace supply, exerting an upward pressure on local wages. In 
addition, a growing skills gap in educational attainments and labor training suggests that the private sector 
may face a shortage o f skilled labor, challenging the notion that Croatia enjoys a relatively e las t ic supply 
o f skilled labor.20

I Box 1: Governance Update: Croat ia Takes Steps to Combat Corruption 

Corrupt ion remains a concern for entrepreneurs, and C roa t ia has taken concrete steps towards 
confronting the problem. Corruption has declined since 2002, according to the resu l ts o f the EBRD-World 
Bank Business Environment and Enterprise Performance Survey (BEEPS). The Parliament approved the Anti- 
Corruption Program 2006-2008, devoting special attention to the judiciary, health services, local government, 
and public administration, where corruption i s considered to be most prevalent. An ambitious action plan 
covering a l l the ministries was subsequently prepared. The capacity o f the Office for the Prevention o f 
Corruption and Organized Crime has been strengthened. A series o f reforms were launched including the 
adoption o f ethics codes, codes o f conduct in the public sector, conflict o f interest legislation, and public 
procurement and state aid legislation. The public finance management system was strengthened. Steps were 
also taken to depoliticize public administration, reform political party financing, and introduce direct elections 
o f city mayors and county prefects. As Croatia proceeds with reform implementation, political commitment to 
combat malfeasance w i l l need t o continue.

discourages long- term investments and increases the

Croatia has started to modernize its logistics infrastructure, regaining relevance as a cost- 
and carbon footprint-effective route in the region. Croatia’s loca t ion and the three pawEuropean 

Transport Corr idors that cross the country o f fe r a cos t-e f f ic ien t and env ironmen t- fr iend ly access to 
Central European markets fo r cargoes or ig ina t ing f rom the East and Far East compared with No r the rn 
European Corridors. As a result, Croatia managed to develop sizeable ac t iv i ty in transit services to 
ne ighbor ing countries, w i t h transit representing be tween 70 and 85 percent o f t ra f f ic in i ts tw o ma in 
international ports and about 65 percent o f r a i l fre igh t cargo revenues. 
In infrastructure, Croatia 
developed a vast ne twork o f mo tonvay over a short per iod o f time (the present phase costs on average 4.0 
percent o f GDP annually) and now enjoys a large road ne twork comparable to EU 15 standards. In future 
investment programs, strengthened emphasis on maintenance o f roads versus new construction i s 
warranted. Croatia also launched a number o f projects in the po r t sector (Rijeka, Ploce, and Zadar) to

to Spain. Nevertheless, the productivity o f the innovation system (measured for example as the cost o f patents i n R&D 
terms) remains low .

upgrade port capacity and endorsed a new HRK 18 billion National Railway Infrastructure Program for 
the next four years to upgrade i t s network. 

25 . 
While Croatia’s overall trade logistics performance has improved in recent years, i t still 
remains behind EUlO countries. 
In 2007, Croatia ranked 63 out o f 150 countries in the Logistics 
Performance Index.22 While Croatia i s competitive on domestic logistics costs, i t s t i l l faces capacity 
constraints along major international corridors that on-going projects w i l l only partly alleviate, given the 
strong t ra f f ic growth experienced over the past five years. Total container t ra f f ic in the two international 
sea ports increased from 21,000 containers (TEU) in 2002 to 175,000 TEU in 2007, drawing on a l l 
available capacity. On the service side, Croatia i s only starting to offer value-added services through 
regional logistics centers, compared to other E U new member states. With the anticipated EU accession, 
Croatia has the potential to offer an attractive location for such services, in line with i t s role as a leader in 
Southeast Europe for sustainable economic development and regional cooperation. 

26. 
Upgrading trade logistics performance requires an integrated public-private approach to 
improve the quality and range o f services offered and to support the development of logistics 
infrastructure, particularly in ports. Investments and know-how needs in both infrastructure and 
services remain substantial considering that, in a base case scenario, demand for containerized cargo 
through Croatian ports i s forecast to double by 2015.23 This requires an integrated development o f ports, 
rail and road hinterland connections to European corridors, and related distribution centers as well as 
public-private partnerships in financing and bringing in global logistics expertise. 

27. 
The Croatian Railway Company (HZ) i s undergoing a major restructuring process which 
could benefit from greater momentum to increase revenues and reduce operating costs, especially 
through further retrenchments. The current level o f subsidies in the railways sector i s unsustainable at 
0.7 percent o f GDP which i s high compared to the EU and neighboring countries. As in other countries 
o f the region, the sector i s facing increased competition from rapidly expanding road t ra f f ic . Owing to 
excessive staffing and wage rates that far exceed other segments o f the labor market, the revenues o f HZ 
do not cover labor costs. While labor productivity has improved, i t remains low. The path to 
competitiveness, financial sustainability, and reduced level o f f inanc ia l support from the government 
requires HZ to reconfigure i t s technology, network, systems, staffing levels, and investments that increase 
railway competitiveness. The next phase o f modernization includes actions to privatize or divest a l l non- 
core subsidiaries and real estate assets, to expose a l l internal or external suppliers to competition or 
benchmark pricing, to t i e a l l operating subsidies to performance-based contracts and to close 
uneconomical lines and recalibrate the railway network to fit traffic demand, shifting the focus toward 
European corridors and urban commuter services. New investments w i l l need to focus more on 
commercial competitiveness and financing implications as well as be subjected to cost-benefit analysis. 

28. 
The efficient provision o f energy services i s important f o r promoting growth and enhancing 
Croatia’s ability to compete with the rest of Europe. Croatia covers about 65 percent o f i t s power 
supply from domestic sources, with roughly half coming from large hydropower plants and the other half 
coming from thermal plants and cogeneration. In addition to i t s own sources, i t imports another 1 5 
percent o f supply annually from the Krsko nuclear power plant in Slovenia which i s half owned by the 
Croatian national power group, HEP. The balance o f 20 percent needs to be imported from other sources. 
However, with a demand growth o f close to 5 percent a year, partly fuelled by the growing tourism and 
manufacturing industry, Croatia’s dependence on electricity imports i s going to increase over the coming 
years. This raises issues related to energy security and cost o f electricity, since regional imports have

become much more expensive. HEP plans to establish several new gas-fired combined cycle plants 
(however, availability o f gas w i l l be an issue) and also to use imported coal in a new plant on the coast. 

C. Improving Quality and Efficiency in the Social Sectors 

29. 
To promote a quality of life that i s at par w ith the rest o f Europe, Croatia w i l l need to 
provide its citizens with access to quality schools, health facilities, and social services. While the 
quality o f social services in Croatia exceed that o f many transition countries, the current level and quality 
o f social services s t i l l f a l l short o f EU standards and do not entirely meet the needs o f the poor. 
Moreover, f i s c a l problems in the pension and health systems can contribute significantly to national 
deficits and present growing concerns for an aging population in Croatia. 

30. 
There i s strong consensus among policymakers that Croatia’s education system needs 
further reforms to respond t o the needs o f the economy. Croatia has achieved significant progress 
under the 2005-20 10 Education Sector Development Plan, which included external assessments and 
preparation o f the State Matura, introduction o f Croatian National Education Standards in primary 
education, and steps towards reducing multiple-shift schools. Croatia also increased public spending on 
education over the las t five years to about 5 percent o f GDP, similar to new E U members. S t i l l , there i s a 
mismatch between skills produced by the education system and those demanded by the market. 

3 1. 
Croatia also has a high share of students who complete only basic vocational programs at 
the secondary level. Croatia has managed to reduce the share o f VET students in the total secondary 
enrollment24 from 71.0 percent in 2004/05 to 69.6 percent in 2007/08, but at a slightly slower pace than 
targeted. If this progress i s maintained however, Croatia could reach the 65 percent target level o f VET 
enrolment by 2010. Life-long learning (adult education) programs exist, but l e s s than 3 percent o f the 
population subscribe to them. Moreover, Croatia does not have a lifelong learning strategy which could 
provide a framework for different forms o f education and activities delivered by various providers. 

32 . 
Croatia’s pension system costs 11.5 percent o f GDP , one-and-a-half percentage points o f 
GDP above the top EU15 spenders. The recent interventions in the pension system, including the 
reduction o f disincentives fo r early retirement, are not consistent with the EU efforts to increase labor 
fo rce participation and reduce f i s c a l pressures on the pension system posed by an aging population. In 
July 2007, the enactment o f the law on bonuses attempted to reduce the gap between old and new retirees 
by raising the benefits o f new re t irees , but with a consequence o f opening a gap for future ones. The July 
2007 amendments to the Pension Insurance Law also lowered the penalty rate for early retirement and 
raised the minimum and disability pensions, thus reversing some o f the achievements o f past pension 
reforms and reducing incentives for the work force to stay in the labor market. To put pension reforms 
back on track, the government w i l l need to take measures to promote f isca l , social, and intergenerational 
sustainability in particular through strengthening second pillar funding to prevent low future replacement 
ra tes and eliminate inequities between different pension cohorts. 

33 . 
Croatia’s health spending has been decreasing over time, but remains high compared to 
new EU member states. Table 2 shows that Croatia’s overall health spending reached 7.7 percent 
o f GDP in 2004;’ which compared favorably w ith countries that joined the EU before M a y 2004, 
but exceeded the spending o f members that joined after 2004. While this has translated into

relatively strong health indicators, maintaining and improving these achievements w i l l require 
enhancements i n the health system, particularly with regards to efficiency and f inanc ia l sustainability. 
The health delivery system s t i l l r e l i e s heavily on inpatient care treatment, at a time when many countries 
are exploiting technological advances to shift to a system where many procedures are treated on an 
outpatient basis. While inpatient admissions are in l i n e with EU average, patients tend to stay in hospitals 
for extended periods o f time. The average length o f hospital stay declined during the 1 9 8 0 s and 1990s, 
but remained close to 1 1 days during the last three years-more 
than double that in the US. 

Table 2: Hea lth Spending o f Croatia and EU members

I/ Standardized Death Rates 

34 . 
The current payment system to hospitals lacks incentives to contain spending. The current 
system rewards hospitals for keeping beds fu l l and extending lengths o f stay, since high occupancy results 
in steady funding. Low occupancy rates also increase the risk that the annual contract for the hospital 
would be decreased by HZZO, the national health insurance. The current move towards a prospective 
case-adjusted payment system represents an important step in rationalizing incentives in the system and 
reducing average length o f stays. There i s scope for rationalizing and modernizing the hospital 
infrastructure. The hospital network consists o f a large number o f multi-specialized hospitals in close 
catchments areas and few cen te rs o f excellence. As a result, small cities/counties’ hospitals are 
underutilized, and regional centers and clinical hospitals are overutilized. 

3 5 . 
Croatia’s social protection system i s characterized by rising spending patterns and many 
parallel social transfer programs. In 2006, Croatia spent 26 percent o f GDP on social programs, which 
i s high by international standards, but only a small share (0.6 percent o f GDP) supported poverty-related 
social assistance program. More than one hundred different non-contributory social benefit programs are 
offered at the national and local levels with an overall budget o f 4.3 percent o f GDP. The large number o f 
programs, combined with the large number o f institutions administering the system and the lack o f 
unified eligibility criteria, have resulted in a complicated and costly social safety net. 

36. 
There i s also an increase i n the number o f young children and young adults who are being 
institutionalized. Moreover, many o f the institutions are too b ig (the average capacity o f children’s 
homes i s 80), and residents tend to stay for long periods. 
International experience has shown that 
community social services, such as day support for the elderly and disabled and foster care for children, 
are much less expensive and more effective than residential institutionalization. 

3 7 . 
The government has a unique opportunity to promote greater social inclusion through social 
protection reforms that focus on better targeting; spending l e s s on categorical benefits and more on well- 
targeted programs l i k e social assistance, to be supported by the introduction o f the Personal Identification 
Number from 2009 onwards; facilitating the r e t u r n from “welfare to work”; upgrading the social 
assistance information system; and consolidating administration where possible by merging relevant 
functions under fewer ministries and single offices a t the local levels. The government has already 
invested considerable efforts and resources to address particular pockets o f poverty including those o f

D. Increasing Sustainability of Long Term Development 

3 8 . 

Croatia's rich natural heritage represents one o f its most important assets and a key driver 

o f economic development. The country enjoys a unique and well-preserved environment, high level o f 
biodiversity and large stores o f fresh water. The degree o f environmental protection, however, i s lower 
than in other developed countries, primarily due to insufficient investments. Croatia faces substantial 
investment needs across a l l environmental sectors, particularly in the sub-sectors o f waste, water, 
brownfield remediation, and air. Achieving sustainable development w i l l require balancing the need to 
pursue growth while at the same time preserving the natural environment-a vision which l i e s at the heart 
o f the EU's Lisbon and Gothenburg agendas.

Croatia are lower than in the recent EU 
member countries. Local governments 

recognize that protecting the quality o f

particularly along the Adriatic Coast.

requirements. The untreated wastewater that i s discharged creates a significant risk o f groundwater, 
surface water and sea water pollution. In addition, most o f the existing wastewater treatment plants need 
to be upgraded to meet EU environmental standards. 

40. 
Although Croatia has a wide coverage o f municipal waste collection, problems remain with 
the organization o f regional waste management centers and w ith illegal dumpsites and 
contaminated land. Around 92 percent o f population has municipal waste collection system coverage, 
though coverage varies from 70 percent in a few counties to almost fu l l coverage in the city o f Zagreb.26 
However, removal o f large number o f “hot spots” or contaminated s i t e s w i l l require significant 
investments, as well as the management o f hazardous waste. After remediation, some o f these s i tes may 
offer opportunities for private redevelopment and reintegration in their surroundings, which could lead to 
improvements in the quality o f l i f e and competitiveness in the vicinity. 

4 1. 

W i th more than fifteen central government institutions responsible f o r environmental 
management, organizational reforms are required to increase their effectiveness. The fragmentation 
o f the system hinders successful implementation, monitoring, enforcement and reporting o f the 
environment chapter o f the acquis. Reforms are also needed in the area o f municipal infrastructure where 
large efficiency gains from economies o f sca le could be achieved through consolidation o f utility services 
across the loca l government units. 

42. 
Croatia i s situated along the global hotspot for biodiversity in the Mediterranean Basin, 
w ith more than 11 percents of i t s land designated as protected areas, which i s s t i l l below the EU 
average o f 15 percent. As part o f i t s e f f o r t s to integrate with the EU Natura 2000 network, Croatia plans 
to increase i t s protected areas to the targeted 15 percent. This w i l l require investments for infrastructure, 
equipment, capacity-building, data collection, and reporting. The park management plans adopted in 
2007 provide a longer term framework for strategic planning and financing which could turn the protected 
areas into strong assets for tourism growth. 

43. 
Similar to other countries in Central and South Eastern Europe, Croat ia i s prone to a range 
o f natura l disasters, including earthquakes, floods, forest f i res , drought, and landslides. This 
vulnerability was evident in the summer o f 2007, when forest f i r e s raged along the Adriatic coast, 
claiming human lives and destroying wildlife. The impact o f climate change, accompanied by changes in 
land use patterns and increased human settlements in disaster-prone areas w i l l magnify the severity and 
intensity o f weather-related disasters in the coming years. To protect i t s citizens from severe 
consequences o f na tura l disasters, Croatia needs to strengthen i t s natural disaster management. 

44. 
As w ith EU member states, adaptation and mitigation o f climate change i s high on Croatia’s 
national agenda. Following the ratification o f the Kyoto Protocol in 2007, Croatia faces the challenge o f 
reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 5 percent between 2008 and 2012. The National Strategy on 
Climate Change recognizes the critical role the energy sector plays in reaching the 2012 goals. While 
Croatia’s energy intensity compares favorably with most countries in Eastern and Southeast Europe, i t 
remains higher than in Western Europe, including Austria and Slovenia. The national strategy aims to 
increase the share o f renewable energy (mainly wind and biomass) in electricity generation to 5 . 8 percent 
by 2010. This w i l l require cogeneration in industry and substitution o f foss i l fuels with local resources 
where possible. Energy efficiency in households through more energy efficient construction and use o f 
appliances w i l l also be important. Additional measures w i l l need to be taken to meet the goal o f 
increasing the share o f biodiesel and other biofuels in motor vehicle f u e l s to 5.75 percent.

Achieving sustainable development w i l l require tackling disparities in living conditions

Box 3: Results at a Glance 

(1 ) Economic S tab i l i ty and Sound Economic Management 
Reduced public debt: Public debt was reduced from 5 1% o f GDP i n 2003 to 47% i n 2007, accompanied by a reduction o f 
general government expenditures by 3 percentage points o f GDP. 
Subsidy cuts: Subsidies to companies were reduced from 3.4% o f GDP i n 2003 to 2.3% i n 2006, including the reduction o f 
operating subsidies to the railways by 0.7 percentage points o f GDP. 
Enhancedpublicfinance management. The Treasury Single Account was expanded to cover the bank accounts o f a l l line 
ministries and extra-budgetary funds. Internal audit and control system was established. 
Public administration reforms: Under the new c i v i l service legislation, assistant ministers and deputy state secretaries, 
among other top professional positions, a r e now hired through a competitive selection process. 
An effective & accountable judiciary: The court case backlog was reduced by 30% between 2004 and mid-2007, and 
indicators o f jud ic ia l performance improved. 

(2) Strong, Pr iva te Sector-led Economic G r ow t h to Raise L i v i n g Standards 
Greater private sector role in the economy. State shares were divested i n over 840 companies, including agro-combinats 
and large loss-makers i n the metal industry, increasing the private sector’s share in the economy to 70%. 
Reduced transaction cosfs. Backlogs in land registry was reduced by more than 60% s ince 2003; 40 out o f 90 Land 
Registry Offices have no backlogs and can now register property transactions i n 7 days. Modernization o f customs has 
helped reduce delays at border crossings and inland terminals by 65% between 2000 and 2005. 
Mak ing Croatia a more attractive trading route: The restructuring o f Croatia’s biggest port i n Rijeka improved i t s 
efficiency w i th port traffic doubling from 2.5 m i l l ion tons i n 2000 to 5.0 m i l l i o n tons in 2006. Container traffic increased 
eight-fold i n only five years. 

(3) B road Par t ic ipa t ion i n the Benefits o f G r ow t h 
Enhanced qualify of education. Reconstruction o f 72 schools i s helping reduce multiple shift schools and improving quality 
o f education. Over 600 primary and secondary schools received didactic equipment, making learning more effective. 
Improved healfh care. I n Zagreb, average response time o f emergency medical services was reduced from 30 to 9 minutes. 
Over 1,700 tons o f pharmaceutical waste and o ld medicine were cleared and removed i n a sa fe manner to protect the 
environment and eliminate health hazard. 
Support to vulnerable groups. Seven o f the 65 planned social welfare homes were upgraded, improving the l iv ing and 
working conditions for beneficiaries and staff. 

Clearing of 

(4) Pro tec t ion o f the Env i ronmen t and Preservation o f Croa t ia ’s N a t u r a l Resources 
landmines. Six m i l l ion square meters o f land i n war-affected areas were cleared, and ru ra l communities i n 
Eastern Slavonia and Baranja could restart agricultural activities and tourism-related businesses. 
Increased flood protecfion and wastewater management. Wastewater treatment plants were restored or built, and 
wastewater collection systems were extended to cover 9 additional municipalities. N o w 85% o f the population o f the 
Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Srijem region has access to wastewater services. 
Environmental protection and reduced energy costs. A new company HEP ESCO was established to support the private 
sector i n undertaking energy efficiency projects. I n the town o f Novigrad 2,300 old street lamps were replaced by new 
energy efficient ones, reducing the town’s energy costs and l igh t pollution. 
Preserving nature. Some 8,000 sq. km. o f the karst eco-ecosystem are now under the surveillance o f trained park staff. 

49. 
Portfolio performance fluctuated during the CAS period. 
With more than one-third o f 
commitments at risk in FY04, the Bank prepared project improvement plans, which led five 
unsatisfactory projects to be upgraded during FY05. I n order to improve portfolio performance, regular 
Joint Portfolio Reviews (JPR) were organized. These reviews identified several factors contributing to 
slow project implementation, including effectiveness delays, weak implementation capacity and lack o f 
familiarity with Bank procedures, as well as complexity o f project design and inadequate project 
readiness. Corrective measures have been adopted following each JPR. The government acknowledged 
the JPR as a useful monitoring tool and introduced a systemic annual review o f a l l IF1 portfolios as a 

16 

Croatia: Country Partnership Strategy for FY09-FY 12 

statutory requirement. As a result o f this collaborative approach, none o f the projects in the portfolio 
closed with unsatisfactory rating, though several closed with moderately satisfactory rating. The current 
portfolio includes two moderately unsatisfactory operations and several moderately satisfactory projects 
that require close monitoring. 

50. 

The latest JPR, held in March 2008, proposed a set of measures to boost portfolio 
performance, including strengthening implementation capacity and the provision o f adequate 

counterpart funds. These measures have been adopted by the government, and the Ministry o f Finance 
has engaged in intensive monitoring o f its implementation. The government monitoring mechanisms w i l l 
be further strengthened by increased supervision by the Ministry o f Finance whose staff w i l l jo in the 
Bank’s supervision missions for select projects. These efforts complement the monitoring and evaluation 
training provided by the Bank in 2007 to increase the capacity o f project implementation teams for 
monitoring the progress o f activities. The Ministry o f Finance and the Bank also agreed to engage in 
regular follow-up to the JPR during the course o f the year.

During the CAS period, I F C supported post-privatization restructuring in key sectors with 
a focus on tourism, agribusiness/food processing, SMEs and trade facilitation. I t made substantial 

investments in two loca l companies to strengthen their corporate governance and environmental standards 
and boost their competitiveness in the region: Agrokor, the largest regional food and beverage company; 
and Adriatic Luxury Hotels (ALH), a pioneer in reestablishing Croatia’s tourism industry. The 
government also requested IFC assistance in improving the quality o f regulations on the start up and 
operation o f businesses. This resulted in the government taking steps to eliminate or simplify more than 
half o f a l l business regulations. As o f June 2008, IFC‘s total commitments reached US$365 million, 
allocated in agribusiness (34 percent), in general manufacturing (33 percent), and in the financial markets 
(33 percent). During FY04-08, IFC committed U S $ 3 14 million and mobilized $25.6 million through 
syndicated banks. I n addition, IFC financed US$84 million in regional projects in Southeast Europe 
region, including Croatia. During the CAS period, MIGA’s guarantees portfolio declined sharply as a

result o f cancellations which reflected improvement in investors’ perception o f political risk as Croatia 
progressed in i t s EU accession process. As o f June 2008, MIGA’s outstanding gross exposure in Croatia 
amounted to about US$17 million, equivalent to 0.3 percent o f MIGA’s gross portfolio. 

B. Lessons Learned 

52. 
A number of important lessons relevant f o r the design of the new CPS emerged from the 
CAS Completion Report. First, a more flexible CAS structure would be appropriate going 
forward. When the CAS was originally designed, Croatia had high and progressively growing external 
debt, large f i s c a l deficit and a lapsed IMF program (new IMF Stand-by Arrangement was signed in 
August 2004), and there was an expressed desire on the part o f the government to have a strong World 
Bank program to support policy reform efforts. The combination o f these factors led to a tightly-designed 
CAS with detailed triggers moving the program from one scenario to the other. 

5 3 . 
M an y important reforms have been implemented under the P A L program as described in 
the CAS Completion Report. However, there has been hesitation or even backtracking at times, 
especially in the period leading to the parliamentary elections. This created uncertainty about the fa te 
and timing o f some investment projects included in the base and high case scenarios for several 
counterparts, which had limited or no impact on the implementation o f the PAL program. These 
uncertainties have created difficulties in managing relationships and planning implementation o f those 
projects. Furthermore, Croatia has maintained strong macroeconomic performance and solid economic 
growth for a prolonged period o f time, and the Bank’s contribution to Croatia’s external financing needs 
was rather modest. Thus the lesson for the new CPS i s that Croatia w i l l benefit from continued intensive 
analytical and advisory work and a focused program o f investment loans and other non-policy based 
instruments. These w i l l not depend on but w i l l be complemented, as warranted, by single-tranche DPLs 
in areas where opportunities arise, and where there i s strong political support and government 
commitment, and the coordination o f cross cutting reforms i s ensured. 

54. 
Second, the P A L program was designed to support a broad and politically difficult reform 
agenda. While some o f the planned actions represented first generation reforms (such as the reduction o f 
subsidies, privatization o f companies in the competitive sector), taken together, they comprised a 
politically and socially difficult package (from restructuring o f the railways company to the reform o f 
social benefits and the privatization o f shipyards). The government and the Bank both believed and 
continue to believe that these reforms are important priorities, but fu l l implementation has proven 
difficult. Going forward, Croatia’s reforms may be better supported by DPLs that focus on a more 
narrowly defined agenda. Such DPLs would support an overall medium-term reform program through a 
se r ies o f single tranche loans with clearly responsible and accountable government counterparts. 

5 5 . 
Th ird , effectiveness delays and uneven implementation progress o f projects was reflected in 
relatively slow disbursements and require actions on both sides. On the Bank’s side, ensuring 
implementation readiness o f projects, including the availability o f implementation capacity and the 
preparation o f procurement documents, remains crucial. As for the authorities, reducing the processing 
time for project effectiveness, allocating necessary resources to create implementation capacity and 
strengthening the Ministry o f Finance’s coordination role and support function vis-a-vis the implementing 
agencies, could help improve project performance and accelerate the flow o f funds. 

C. Strategic Objectives of the New CPS 

56. 
The goal o f the CPS i s to support the completion o f Croatia’s EU accession process, the 
rapid convergence o f its income level with that of the current EU member states in a fiscally, 
socially and environmentally sustainable fashion, and a decent quality o f life f o r Croatia’s citizens. 

18 

Croatia: Country Partnership Strategy for FY 0 9 -FY 12 

This overarching goal i s fully in line with the government’s priorities expressed in various government 
programs, including the Program o f the Government o f the Republic o f Croatia for the 2008-2011 
Mandate, the National Program for EU accession, the Pre-accession Economic Program 2008-20 10 and 
the Strategic Development Framework for 2006- 1 3 , In order to support the achievement o f this goal, the 
Bank Group program w i l l aim at contributing in the four identified areas o f emphasis: (i) sustaining 
macroeconomic stability; (ii) strengthening private sector-led growth and accelerating convergence with 
the EU; (iii) improving the quality and efficiency in the soc ia l sectors; and (iv) increasing the 
sustainability o f long-term development. The EU accession agenda w i l l remain a cross-cutting theme in 
the design and implementation o f the Bank Group’s program. 

57 . 
The results framework f o r the CPS reflects an effort to l ink the Bank Group activities to the 
development objectives the government wants to achieve in the CPS period. However, this 
framework has important limitations. First, there i s tension between the notion o f pre-defined outcomes 
and the needed flexibility o f Bank Group engagement in an advanced middle-income country that i s on 
the verge o f EU accession. Second, the Bank’s lending represents a small part o f Croatia’s external 
financing and public expenditure, and the Bank Group contribution, while potentially important, would 
affect only a part o f Croatia’s overall economic agenda. Nonetheless, a serious e f fo r t has been made to 
create a results framework, building on results that are expected to be achieved through the 
implementation o f the current portfolio and new activities o f which there i s a clear agreement. 
I f 
significant changes occur in the overall program, the results framework w i l l be adjusted in the CPS 
Progress Report. The results framework, including the key expected CPS outcomes and indicators, are 
summarized in Annex 1, 

D. Overall Approach 

5 8 . 

The design and implementation o f the program w i l l be demand-driven and flexible. As 
envisaged under the Bank Group’s Middle-Income Countries agenda, the CPS represents a broad 
framework in which the Bank Group can flexibly respond to emerging priorities in a timely fashion. In 
doing so, the Bank Group w i l l seek to mobilize the best available technical expertise, international 
experience, and a wide range o f Bank Group instruments. The program i s defined fo r the first two years 
o f the CPS period, and w i l l be adjusted to respond to Croatia’s emerging needs at the time o f the CPS 
Progress Report. 

5 9 . 
I n order to reconcile the dual objectives o f flexibility and selectivity, and to operate within 
the available resource envelope, the lending program has been divided into tw o parts. The f i rs t part 
(Part I) represents activities for the first two years where there i s clear agreement with the authorities to 
proceed, including on the content o f the proposed operations. Several projects in this part o f the program 
have already been prepared under the previous CAS, with about one-half representing additional 
financing or repeater-type projects. A l l projects w i l l be subjected to the development effectiveness test. 

60. 
The second part (Part II) o f the program includes equally important areas of engagement 
that require further dialogue and groundwork w ith the government. These areas o f priorities f a l l 
into two main categories. The first includes possible investment projects in railways and the energy 
sector where appropriate strategies and/or investment plans need to be defined to allow for Bank 
financing. The second category includes possible development policy lending that could support two sets 
o f reforms - governance and anti-corruption measures; and measures that encourage private sector 
growth through continued f i s c a l consolidation, improved quality o f public expenditures, and investment 
climate reforms. In both areas, the Bank w i l l continue with a program o f AAA and dialogue and w i l l 
assess progress that might warrant development policy lending, if the authorities so wish. Development 
policy lending, i f any, w i l l be used selectively in well-defined areas where government commitment to 
reform i s strong and based on actual reform performance, leading to better governance, improved 

19 

Croatia: Country Partnership Strategy for FY09-FY 12 

competitiveness, continued f i s c a l adjustment and reduced external and long-term vulnerabilities. 
Maintenance o f a satisfactory macroeconomic performance, characterized by continued 
consolidation towards the government’s target o f a balanced budget, as well as broad progress on the 
structural reform agenda without major policy reversals w i l l be a prerequisite for any development policy 
lending. 

f isca l 

61. 
A joint program with the I F C i s planned, based on a shared strategy. The Bank and IFC 
have been working together in the area o f sub-national finance and w i l l continue to do so in supporting 
private sector investments and PPP solutions in infrastructure in particular. 
IFC’s focus on post- 
privatization restructuring in priority sectors w i l l complement the Bank’s efforts to support enterprise 
privatization under the PAL program. The Bank’s work on broader investment climate issues and support 
for reforms in this area, are also being complemented by IFC’s Regulatory Reform project. Finally, IFC’s 
support for domestic companies to increase their competitiveness and efficiency and to implement best 
practices in corporate governance, environmental and soc ia l standards, w i l l contribute to the broader 
competitiveness and EU accession agenda which i s supported by both the Bank and the IFC. 

6 2 . 

I n the selection and design o f operations, pr imary consideration w i l l be given to how the 
proposed project supports Croatia’s EU accession agenda. I n the case of social sectors where there 
i s no EU acquis, consideration w i l l also be given t o how projects complement EU accession efforts . 
This assessment w i l l be made together with the authorities and in c lose collaboration with the EC. 
Project components that enhance Croatia’s capacity to absorb EU funds, especially following accession, 
w i l l have high priority. 

E. Areas of Engagement 

63 . 
The envisaged Bank Group operational program w i l l support, in a selective fashion, the 
government’s main strategic priorities in the context o f Croatia’s EU accession process: 

(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 

(iv) 

sustaining macroeconomic stability; 
strengthening private sector led growth and accelerating convergence with the EU; 
improving quality and efficiency in the social sectors; and 
increasing the sustainability o f long-term development. 

P i l la r 1: Sustaining Macroeconomic Stability 

64. 

Under this pillar, the key objectives are to: 
Enhance the efficiency and effectiveness o f public finances; and 
0 Strengthen financial sector supervision. 

0 

6 5 . 

Enhancing the effectiveness and the efficient management of public spending i s important 
fo r strengthening 
the economy’s ability 
to withstand external shocks and 
improving 
competitiveness. The government recognizes that a smaller public sector, as well as improved 
composition and efficiency o f public spending are necessary for the reduction o f Croatia’s external 
vulnerability, for private sector growth and for sustainable, strong economic growth. The improved 
effectiveness o f public expenditures and public sector efficiency more broadly w i l l continue to have high 
priority in the Bank Group’s program. Programmatic analytical work on public expenditures i s 
envisaged, covering the medium-term expenditure framework, 
the public 
investment program, 
institutional issues, performance-based budgeting, as well as specific sectoral public expenditure reviews. 
This, combined with analytical work on governance described in paragraph 67 , could help define the 
agenda for a possible public sector DPL. Debt management products may also be used to improve the 
efficiency o f public finances. 

20 

Croatia: Country Partnership Strategy for FY09-FY 12 

66 . 

Fu r the r strengthening o f financial sector supervision a t a time of financial market 
turbulence i s an important pr ior ity . The fas t credit growth o f the recent past, and the relatively high 
currency and interest rate risk o f banks require increased bank supervision, while considering effective 
measures that can eventually be executed within the EU framework. Also the non-bank financial sector 
would benefit from further capacity building o f HANFA. The recent ROSCs on corporate governance, 
and accounting and auditing have helped highlight some weaknesses. The gradual elimination o f these 
weaknesses would improve the transparency and soundness o f the corporate sector, thus enhancing 
companies’ access to credit and banks’ balance sheets. An IDF grant on corporate f inanc ia l reporting w i l l 
support the initial implementation o f a long-term s tra tegy and action plan, as well as provide training to 
bring the corporate financial reporting framework in line with international standards. Follow-up on the 
recently completed jo in t Bank-Fund Financial Sector Assessment i s also envisaged. This may include 
work on consumer protection in financial services and f inanc ia l governance in a regional context covering 
several Central European and Baltic countries, as well as convergence with EU standards for financial 
service industries and their performance. 

P i l la r 2: Strengthening Private Sector-Led Growth and Accelerating EU Convergence 

67. 

Under this pillar, the key objectives are to: 
Enhance public sector governance; 
Improve the investment climate; and 
Align the provision o f infrastructure and related services with demand.

6 8 . 

Strong public sector governance leads to better policies, increased transparency, improved 
public service delivery and lower cost o f doing business. Enhancing public sector governance entails 
improvements in the effectiveness o f the public administration, in the efficiency o f the judicial system and 
law enforcement, and the reduction in corruption. Reform o f the judiciary and public administration i s 
also a key condition for Croatia’s EU accession and among the highest priorities o f the government. To 
ass is t the implementation o f the government’s judicial reform and anti-corruption strategies, a Judicial 
Reform Project i s being prepared. This project, which would build on the PAL I and 11, and the recently 
completed Court and Bankruptcy Administration Project, w i l l support (i) the strengthening o f judicial 
administration and court management; ( i i ) rationalization o f the court network; and ( i i i ) automation o f 
courts to help the implementation o f integrated case management. Based on the results achieved in the 
reform o f land registration and cadastre, this area may receive further support as part o f the e f fo r ts to 
strengthen the judiciary and public administration. To complement the analytical work on public 
expenditures described in paragraph 64, AAA in se lec t issues o f public sector governance to support 
policy making and the preparation o f a public sector DPL i s envisaged. Policy notes may cover public 
expenditure management in the judiciary, and governance and anticorruption. A public sector DPL could 
address further rationalization o f the structure o f public administration, strengthening the c iv i l service 
management and reward system, enhancing the professional development o f c iv i l servants, strengthening 
strategic planning and policy coordination, rationalization o f the court system, the development o f an 
effective accountability and performance monitoring mechanism in the judiciary, and further 
improvements in public finance management and transparency. The Bank may also explore the 
possibility o f designating Croatia as a focus country fo r governance-centered grant support, including 
through the Governance Partnership Facility (GPF). The grant financing would support Croatia’s 
governance and anti-corruption priorities, especially those outlined in the National Anti-Corruption 
Strategy and which are relevant for EU accession, 

6 9 . 
Fu r the r improvement in the investment climate would lead to increased competitiveness, 
and thus faster convergence o f incomes toward EU levels. Croatia stands to benefit from continued 
increase in the private sector’s share in the economy, currently at 70 percent, through the rapid 

21 

Croatia: Country Partnership Strategy for FY09-FY 12 

completion o f the privatization program and the entry o f new private enterprises ( loca l and foreign), the 
lowering o f the cost o f doing business, and the reduction o f the large informal sector, estimated at 
between 1 5 and 30 percent o f GDP. The EU Convergence Report, which i s being f ina l ized in close 
collaboration with Croatian counterparts, w i l l analyze the key constraints to improved competitiveness o f 
the Croatian economy and provide recommendations in the areas o f regulation, labor market and 
education, trade and infrastructure. Select follow-up work on competitiveness issues i s envisaged. This 
w i l l likely be in partnership with the National Competitiveness Council, a four-partite body, including 
senior representatives from the government, employers, trade unions and academia. Furthermore, a DPL 
which could build on the recommendations o f the EU Convergence Report, might be developed if there i s 
interest and strong commitment by the government and an appropriate coordination mechanism i s in 
place. The DPL may support continued f i s c a l consolidation through progress in the quality o f f i s c a l 
adjustment, improvements in the investment climate, the completion o f the privatization process, and the 
strengthening o f the regulatory framework. 
IFC’s future activities w i l l continue to focus on post- 
privatization restructuring in priority sectors; helping domestic companies to become regionally 
competitive; and promoting loca l bond market and secondary capital market development. 

I Bo x 4: I F C Strategy in Croatia 

I n line with its strategy in middle-income countries, IFC w i l l seek opportunities to support creditworthy 
second tier companies in Croatia’s economically depressed regions. 
IFC w i l l offer new products to i t s 
largedfirst tier clients and tap into their supply chain as we l l as continue to support their further modernization and 
expansion into higher value-added products and/or South-South investments. IFC w i l l focus on se lec t ive sectors 
and activities such as agribusiness, information and communication technology, construction materials, tourism, 
infrastructure (ports, oil/gas pipelines, power generation), financial markets and regional projects. Through advisory 
services, IFC w i l l promote private sector participation in the infrastructure sectors. Addressing climate change, IFC 
may focus on four products: energy efficiency, renewable energy, cleaner production, and recycling. I f market 
conditions deteriorate, either due to domestic factors or due to negative international credit market contagion, IFC 
w i l l look for opportunities to support alternative funds mobilizations and funding base diversification (syndication, 
parallel fac i l i t ies , loca l secondary capital market development including loca l bond market). Also, IFC w i l l seek 
investment opportunities with financial institutions to improve the range o f financial products delivered particularly 
t o SMEs, microfinance enterprises and low or middle-income households, while supporting delivery that addresses 
sectoral and regional inequalities. 

70. 
Convergence w ith the EU and sustained economic growth require integrated infrastructure 
and related services working effectively and developing rapidly enough to keep up with increased 

demand. Since Croatia has a well-developed infrastructure, the focus i s on improving the network 
capacity by addressing remaining gaps, improving integration into the trans-European networks, and 
implementing a policy framework conducive fo r accelerated development o f new capacity through 
public-private  partnership^.^' The government’s plans ca l l for continued upgrading o f the Pan-European 
corridors, including the development o f railway infrastructure, increasing the capacity o f seaports, 
building on masterplans recently updated under ongoing projects, expanding energy generation capacity 
and improving regional connectivity o f the energy system in line with the Energy Community program 
for Europe, regionally supported by the Bank. Future Bank and IFC support i s expected to include further 
financing for port development through public-private partnerships and related hinterland connections, in 
particular to continue the expansion o f capacity in the port o f Rijeka and possibly P loceS3 ’ The Bank and 
the IFC are also ready to continue the dialogue with HEP on expanded collaboration in the areas o f 
energy generation and/or transmission, in addition to the additional financing for the rehabilitation o f the

In the port sector, this entails private investments in superstructure and equipment by concessionaires in line w i th the Law 
on Seaport updated in 2006 and concession f e e s paid to the por t authorities for infrastructure costs. 
A t least three port terminals are expected to be put in concession as part o f the ongoing Bank-financed projects over the CPS 
period.

district heating network and energy efficiency investments. Future Bank support may also include 
investments in upgrading select railway infrastructure o f European significance, in strengthening the 
competitiveness o f the railways ahead o f the opening o f its network, and i n improving its performance. 
Such investments w i l l need to go hand in hand with and support the implementation o f a sound 
restructuring program o f the Croatian Railways i n coordination with EIB, an important financier o f 
railway investments. IFC, in close collaboration with the Bank, w i l l continue to promote private sector 
investments and PPP 
in infrastructure through expertise/advisory services and direct funding. 
Possibilities for further collaboration with EBRD w i l l be explored. M IGA remains also open to 
opportunities to support foreign investment in infrastructure and other sectors though the provision o f 
guarantees. 

P i l lar 3: Improving Quality and Efficiency in the Social Sectors 

71 . 

0 

Under this pillar, the key objectives are to: 
Increase the sustainability and equity o f the pension system; 
Improve health system efficiency and outcomes; 
Enhance the education system to support a knowledge-based economy; and 
Improve soc ia l inclusion and better targeting o f social assistance.

72 . 

Due to the low labor fo rce participation and aging of Croatian society, ensuring the fiscal 
sustainability o f the pension system remains a key challenge. O f course Croatia’s problem i s not 

unique, as many countries in Europe and elsewhere face similar issues. In addition to maintaining the 
f i s c a l sustainability o f the system, its soc ia l sustainability i s equally important. Thus addressing the low 
future replacement rates and the current significant inequities, such as the differences in privileged and 
old-aged pensions, i s also a priority. The Bank has mapped out a set o f policy measures in the recent 
Public Finance Review that could lead to major improvements in the long-term sustainability o f the 
pension system. The Bank i s ready to continue the dialogue on this important matter, and if the 
government were to implement some o f the key recommendations o f the Public Finance Review in the 
pension system, support through development policy lending could be envisaged. 

7 3 . 

I n the health sector, the dual challenge i s to improve the efficiency and outcomes of the 

health system. This requires fundamental reforms, including the reduction o f heavy reliance on inpatient 
care, rationalization o f the hospital networks, and improvement in the health insurance system. Some 
important rationalization measures have already been implemented through the PAL program, and a new 
health sector reform strategy i s under design. I n addition to the Public Finance Review’s analysis o f 
health expenditures, the Bank has offered technical assistance to support the preparation o f this strategy, 
changes in the payment mechanisms fo r hospitals and a plan to improve the quality assurance system. 
The Bank i s also carrying out analytical work in the area o f long term care, a pressing issue in a country 
with a rapidly aging population. An investment project, the Development o f Emergency Med ica l 
Services and Investment Planning, i s also being finalized to improve the emergency response capacity 
throughout Croatia and strengthen the Ministry’s ability to prepare investments. One o f the objectives o f 
the operation i s to develop the capacity o f the Ministry o f Health and Soc ia l Welfare to prepare strategic 
plans, necessary to make use o f European Funds (both pre-and post-accession). One such plan would be 
the development o f a health facilities masterplan, the implementation o f which could be financed with EU 
funds as in other EU countries. 

74. 

The government attaches high priority to education to support a knowledge-based 

economy. Important progress has already been achieved in the implementation o f the government’s 
Education Development Plan, such as clearly-defined learning outcomes fo r primary education, 
introduction o f national external assessments and progress in elimination o f triple-shift schools. EU 

23 

Croatia: Country Partnership Strategy for FYOB-FY 12 

membership negotiations for Chapter 26-Education and Culture-have been opened and closed in one 
day because o f the high degree o f harmonization between the Croatian education system and those o f 
other European countries. Nonetheless, there i s a need to further increase enrollment and completion 
rates in secondary and higher education, and shift focus from narrow vocational programs towards 
cultivating skills which are relevant to a dynamic economy and fast-changing labor markets. The Bank 
has provided ongoing support, closely aligned with the government’s education strategy, in the context o f 
the Education Sector Development Project. Additional financing or a new operation to continue such 
support, including a significant increase in single-shift schools i s envisaged during the CPS period. The 
Bank w i l l also be ready to continue the dialogue on se lec t issues o f education policy, in addition to the 
analysis provided in the Public Finance Review and the EU Convergence Report. 

75 . 
Improving social inclusion and better targeting o f social assistance are key aspects o f 
addressing pockets o f poverty and enhancing social cohesion. Better coordinated soc ia l policies, the 
regular adjustment o f the well-targeted poverty benefits and a shift from the high level o f institutionalized 
care are among the key priorities. A new social assistance strategy has been adopted by the government 
and its consistent implementation remains important. The Bank i s ready to maintain the dialogue on the 
most effective ways to provide soc ia l assistance and, i f requested, would be ready to further support soc ia l 
inclusion activities. 

P i l lar 4: Increasing the Sustainability o f Long-Term Development 

76. 

Under this pillar, the key objectives are to: 
Strengthen environment management and nature protection; 
Improve natural disaster management; 
Prepare for adapting to and mitigating climate change; and 
Reduce regional and urbanhural disparities.

7 7 . 
The government recognizes the importance o f environment protection and spatial planning 
f o r a higher quality o f l i fe . There has been significant progress in these areas since 2004. Improved 
environmental management and implementation o f a large investment program are also necessary for 
Croatia’s EU accession. Increasing the level o f water and sewage connectivity in line with the’ Water 
Management Strategy, increasing the number and quality o f landfills, reducing the fragmentation o f 
environmental and spatial management, and increasing the protected areas as well as the preservation o f 
ecological networks and their improved management are some o f the challenges ahead. Future operations 
w i l l include the continuation o f the Coastal C i t ies Pollution Control program, an APL o f three phases to 
support the improvement o f water quality in l i n e with EU environmental directives (like the Urban 
Wastewater Directive) in a number o f Croatia’s coastal c i t i e s that are also important tourist destinations 
and prepare projects for implementation through EU funding. A sub-sovereign loan for the creation o f a 
new regional waste management facility i s also envisaged. The program would also include continued 
support to protect Croatia’s national and nature parks, following a successful GEF grant fo r the protection 
o f the karst ecosystem. A multi-country study that analyzes options for reducing the carbon footprint in 
the transport system i s also included in the program along with analytical work on brownfield remediation 
investments which may lead to project opportunities in the second part o f the CPS period. 

78. 
Improved natura l disaster management could save lives and contain the damage caused by 
disasters. Croatia i s prone to flooding, drought and forest f i res , thus improving emergency preparedness 
and response i s a high government priority. Climate change w i l l likely further increase the number and 
severity o f na tura l disasters. The Bank has developed a region-wide natural disaster management facility, 
and Croatia i s expected to be one o f the f i r s t recipients o f this program. The project may include support 

24 

Croatia: Country Partnership Strategy fo r FY09-FY 12 

for disaster risk financing, disaster risk management and adaptation strategy, weather forecasting and 
flood early warning, disaster risk mitigation investments and emergency preparedness and response. 

7 9 . 
Croat ia has begun to make plans f o r adapting to and mitigating climate change. Some o f the 
key challenges include limited use o f renewable energy, the high energy intensity o f the economy, and 
Croatia’s obligation to reduce greenhouse emission by 5 percent by 2012. UNDP, in collaboration with 
the Bank in this year’s Human Development Report for Croatia, w i l l review the impact o f climate change 
on the country and some se lec t areas where adaptation and mitigation measures could be adopted. The 
Bank i s envisaged to finance an investment project fo r irrigation and flood protection to help increase 
agricultural productivity and protect areas from flood damage in the context o f climate change. 

80. 
Despite its relatively small area, Croat ia has significant regional disparities. The government 
has begun to strengthen its regional development strategy and coordination, and this w i l l become 
increasingly important for the future use o f EU regional funds. I n addition to regional differences, the 
incomplete transition in farming also raises special issues for urban-rural disparities. The Bank has been 
supporting regional development through the Soc ia l and Economic Recovery Project, not only directly 
through investments but also through technical assistance to strengthen policy-making and planning 
capacity. The Development o f Emergency Medical Services and Investment Planning project also aims 
to reduce regional disparities in the medical system’s response to emergencies. 

F. Partnerships and Participation 

8 1 . 

The IMF and the Bank w i l l collaborate closely in their efforts to support the Government o f 
Croat ia in undertaking expenditure-led fiscal consolidation, improving tax administration, and 
strengthening competitiveness. The authorities successfully completed the latest IMF Stand-by 
Arrangement at end-2006, and the IMF now provides policy advice and analysis through i t s surveillance 
activities (Article I V consultations and s t a f f visits) and technical assistance. In the period ahead, the Fund 
w i l l take the lead in assisting Croatia on issues related to maintaining macroeconomic stability, which i s 
key to underpinning sustainable economic growth. In particular, the Fund w i l l focus on monetary and 
exchange ra te policies, f isca l policy, f inanc ia l sector stability, and the external sector and Croatia’s 
competitiveness. The Bank w i l l take the lead in the policy dialogue on structural and institutional reforms 
in a number o f areas, including the judicial system, governance and anti-corruption, the investment 
climate, and private sector participation in infrastructure. In the financial sector, the Bank and the Fund 
share responsibility and w i l l coordinate their financial sector policy advice to the Croatian authorities, 
taking into account the division o f labor and each institution’s areas o f responsibility in preparing the 
recent FSAP update. 

82 . 

The Bank w i l l continue to cooperate closely w ith the European Commission (EC) in 
assisting Croatia w ith complementary projects and analytical and advisory services to fac i l i ta te 
accession to the EU and build capacity to use EU structural and cohesion funds. The cooperation with the 
European Commission w i l l focus on complementing the EU funds from the Instrument for Pre-Accession 
( PA ) . Approximately EUR570 million i s being made available through P A funding to Croatia in 2007- 
2010. The Bank has already provided opportunities under i t s investment operations to finance project 
preparation for upcoming IPA funding, and w i l l remain open to similar f a c i l i t i e s in the future. Given that 
IPA funds represent relatively a small portion o f resources needed for heavy investments per acquis 
requirements, the Bank aims to engage in c lose coordination and division o f labor (such as co-financing 
with IPA) to maximize impact. A detailed description o f collaboration between the Bank and the EU i s 
included in Annex 2. 

8 3 . 
The Bank’s program o f assistance i s also coordinated w ith key European financial 
institutions such as the European Investment Bank and the European Bank f o r Reconstruction and 

25 

Croatia: Country Partnership Strategy for FYOB-FY 12 

Development. This cooperation i s also facilitated by the Joint European Commission/World Bank Office 
for Southeast Europe based in B russe ls , which i s serving as the secretariat o f the IF1 Advisory Group and 
co-chaired by the EC.32 

84. 
Close cooperation w ith UN agencies, namely UNDP and U N H C R , w i l l continue to focus on 
economic and social revitalization, as well as ru ra l and regional development, which are high on the 
development agenda to support the equitable growth o f underdeveloped areas in the country. Going 
forward, sustainable development, cross-compliance with the environment acgu is , and a broader soc ia l 
inclusion agenda are some o f the areas that w i l l require active engagement with the UNDP . 

8 5 . 

I n preparation f o r the CPS, a ser ies of meetings and consultations were held across the 
country. The consultations, which took place in May 2008, in Zagreb, Rijeka, Sibenik, Varaidin and 
Vukovar included representatives o f local authorities, the business community as well as non- 
governmental organizations to solicit their views and opinions on development priorities and challenges 
facing Croatia during the next four years. A summary o f these consultations i s included in Annex 4 . 

86. 
I n addition, a client survey was conducted in February 2008, i n which stakeholders were 
invited to share their opinions on Croatia’s development priorities and the Bank’s assistance. A 
total o f 207 stakeholders-most o f whom were familiar with or have interacted with the Bank-took part 
in the survey by completing questionnaires. Participants were drawn largely from government ministries, 
NGOs, private sector, and academia; bilateral and multilateral agencies; and the executive o f f ices . 

87. 
Economic growth, followed by government effectiveness and governance, emerged overall 
as the most important development priorities in the client survey. Corruption, though l e s s o f a 
concern in general, was the most important development priority cited by NGOs, while other respondents 
ranked EU accession and government effectiveness/governance high on their list o f concerns. World 
Bank support in Croatia was viewed positively with most stakeholders welcoming Bank financing in the 
key priority areas. Education and corruption-which 
incidentally were not cited as major development 
priorities-were also identified as area that would benefit from Bank resources. In contrast, only a small 
share o f respondents believed Bank resources should be channeled towards helping Croatia prepare for 
EU accession. Where research was concerned, respondents indicated that Bank involvement would be 
most valuable in the areas o f private sector development, education, labor markets, public sector 
performance, and anti-corruption. 

8 8 . 
According to the client survey, the Bank’s knowledge was seen by stakeholders as its most 
valuable asset, followed by its financial resources and convening power. The Bank was also seen as 
responsive, straightforward and respectful to stakeholders. However, the survey also revealed that the 
Bank was perceived as being too bureaucratic in its policies and procedures, and that i t supported 
technocratic solutions without due regard to political realities. Going forward, the Bank i s expected to 
play a somewhat significant role in Croatia’s development in the medium term. Respondents indicated 
the Bank could bring greater value by focusing primarily on complex and difficult issues and reducing the 
complexity o f obtaining Bank financing. 

G. Bank F inanc ia l Support and Creditworthiness Considerations 

89. 
The CPS envisages an indicative base case lending envelope of about US$1.0-1.4 billion over 
the four-year period. Since Bank lending w i l l be demand-driven, annual amounts could fluctuate 

3 2 

I n addition to the IBRD, EIB, EBRD and CEB, the Advisory Group a lso includes IFC, Black Sea Trade and Development 
Bank, KfW (Germany) and the Stability Pact for Southeast Europe. 

26 

Croatia: Country Partnership Strategy for FY09-FY 12 

significantly across f i s c a l years. The base case lending program would only include non-policy based 
operations. This program could be complemented with a se r ies o f one-tranche DPLs, especially in 
support o f reforms in the public sector and to improve Croatia’s competitiveness, as opportunities arise 
and government commitment i s ensured. With DPLs, under an upside scenario, lending could reach 
US$1.4-1.8 billion during the CPS period. The upside scenario would be supportive of, and consistent 
with, the use o f DPLs as elaborated in paragraph 59 . I t would be characterized by strong government 
commitment to reform based on actual performance, including improved governance, enhanced 
competitiveness, continued f isca l consolidation towards the government’s target o f a balanced budget, and 
reduced external and long-term vulnerabilities supported by broad progress on the structural reform 
agenda without major policy reversals. Traditional IBRD loans are likely to be supplemented by other 
IBRD instruments, such as disaster and catastrophe risk insurance, catastrophe risk deferred drawdown 
option, sub-national lending and debt management products. 

90 . 
Table 4 summarizes the indicative program f o r the first two years o f the CPS. The content o f 
the program for the second part o f the CPS period and the overall s ize o f Bank assistance w i l l be 
reviewed and revised as appropriate in the CPS Progress Report at mid-term o f the CPS.

The Bank’s lending program during the past CAS period led to an increase in Croatia’s 
outstanding debt (DOD) to IBRD by some US$516 million between end-FY04 and end-FYOS (or 
US$245 million between CY04 and CY07). This increase has modestly affected the exposure indicators 
as shown in Table 5; debt service to the Bank remained below six percent on average o f Croatia’s public 
sector debt service throughout the period. The increase in exposure has been carefully managed as Bank 
lending has been closely associated with the implementation o f economic reforms. A t the end o f FY08, 
the level o f DOD ( U S $ I .3 billion) was below the amount projected in the original CAS (US$1 .5 billion), 
reflecting the lower than originally expected level o f development policy lending in the CAS period due 
to a slower reform path. 

92 . 
The anticipated lending volumes fo r the FY09-12 CPS are based on Croatia’s historical 
lending levels and absorption capacity, and the government’s borrowing needs from I F I s . Croatia 

27 

Croatia: Country Partnership Strategy fo r FY09-FY 12 

has maintained relatively favorable access to international capital markets for over a decade. However, 
the rating agencies have been slow to signal improvement in Croatia's sovereign rating due to the 
deterioration in the country's external vulnerability, notwithstanding i t s progress towards EU accession. 
In order to assist the authorities in this environment, the CPS provides a spectrum o f IBRD lending, 
where higher lending volumes would result from possible development policy lending that would support 
key policy reforms that enhance macroeconomic stability and mitigate risks. I n particular, development 
policy lending would take place in an environment o f continued f i s c a l consolidation and reduced external 
vulnerabilities, as described in paragraph 5 9 . I f the macroeconomic situation were to significantly 
deteriorate, measured by widening fiscal deficits and further increase in Croatia's external vulnerabilities, 
the lending levels under the base case w i l l be revisited. I n any event, a review o f the program, including 
lending levels and risks, w i l l take place a f t e r two years in the CPS Progress Report.

Croatia's creditworthiness in terms of 
access 
to 
international capital markets has 
remained relatively stable over the previous CAS 
period w ith robust growth performance and a 
sharp increase in private capital inflows. Prospects 
for EU and NATO accession, a reasonable record in 
business environment reforms and privatization have 
boosted private sector investment. This, on the other 
hand, has also contributed to larger private sector 
imbalances and a 
rise 
in 
indebtedness. Fiscal 
consolidation e f fo r ts have imDroved Dublic sector 
savings and have helped reduce public sector debt to 
below 4 8 percent o f GDP. The short-term position o f

been only limited impact so far from the global f inanc ia l turmoil. Such impact through the trade channel 
i s expected to be limited for Croatia compared to i t s EU peers, given that the current growth has been 
mostly driven by domestic, and to a lesser extent, external demand. The exports-to-GDP ratio amounts to 
approximately 50 percent o f GDP, which i s at the low end among the new member states o f the EU, while 
the EU25 ’s share in Croatia’s trade stagnates at roughly 63 percent, and i s l e s s than that o f the new 
member states. 

94. 
Given Croatia’s external imbalances, the global financial turmoil may have a more 
significant impact through capital flows. Croatia’s external debt-to-GDP ratio stood at 95.7 percent at 
end-2007 in US$ terms,33 while the external debt-to-exports o f goods and services ratio was c lose to 195 
percent. Both almost doubled since the end o f the 1990s. The currency composition o f total external debt 
a t the end o f 2007 showed that over three-fourths was euro-denominated debt and therefore, the kuna/US$ 
exchange rate appreciation contributed to an increase in external debt expressed in US$ by 25.5 percent, 
while in euro terms the increase was 12.5 percent compared to end-2006. The significant growth in 
external debt i s closely related to the deterioration o f the current account deficit which averaged 6.1 
percent o f GDP in the 1999-2006 period, surging to 8.6 percent o f GDP in 2007. However, the maturity 
structure o f Croatia’s external debt i s relatively favorable as short-term debt makes up for around 13 
percent o f to ta l debt. Gross international reserves coverage stood at 5.6 months o f imports o f goods and 
services in 2007. The relatively high international reserves and banks’ foreign assets provide for a 
relatively favorable estimate o f net external indebtedness which reached 50.9 percent o f GDP at end- 
2007. 

95. 
Positive developments i n the real sector w i l l likely continue during the CPS period, as 
shown in the projections o f key macroeconomic indicators, w ith economic growth expected to 
average around five percent i n the medium term. The 2008-2012 growth projections are underpinned 
by (i) the assumption o f Croatia’s EU accession in 201 1; (ii) improved macroeconomic stability, which 
would stimulate private investment, particularly greenfield investments; (iii) stronger export performance; 
and (iv) narrowing public sector s ize which w i l l create new opportunities for private sector growth. This 
i s in line with the plans indicated in the Program o f the Government o f the Republic o f Croatia for the 
2008-201 1 Mandate. Inflation i s projected to grow by 6 percent in 2008, primarily as a result o f higher 
inflation carried over from 2007 and further increase in food and o i l prices. The kuna to euro exchange 
rate w i l l remain relatively stable with pressures on the real appreciation to continue. Lower inflation i s 
expected for 2009-2012 as the negative impact on the supply side gradually disappears. Further f i s c a l 
consolidation towards a balanced budget by 201 1, with ambitious spending restraint and a reduction o f 
tax burden w i l l contribute to a fa l l in public debt to below 3 5 percent o f GDP. The current account deficit 
i s set to decline slowly but to levels s t i l l significantly above those observed i n the first half o f the decade, 
reflecting private sector investments and the increased cost o f o i l imports. FD I inflows are to remain 
strong at above four percent o f GDP on average, but l e s s robust than in 2006-2007 when the privatization 
o f o i l and telecom monopolies took place. Financial risks arising from the deterioration in global investor 
sentiment are likely to remain moderate, given strong FD I inflows but high current account deficit, 
reliance on borrowing from foreign banks and moderate liquidity among domestic banks. 

96. 
Under the upside lending scenario, Bank exposure might reach U S N . 7 billion by end-2012. 
Such an outcome would reflect Croatia’s strong reform performance, faster disbursement including o f 
development policy loans, and the resulting improvement in Croatia’s creditworthiness. Croatia’s external 
debt burden remains substantial, with a debt service to exports o f goods and services ratio o f about 34.7 
percent (see Table 5), but projected to decline below 30 percent by the end o f the CPS period. During the 
CPS period, the country’s medium and long-term external borrowings i s expected to average about 12 
percent o f GDP, o f which around 2 percent may be covered by IBRD (see Table 6). Debt service to 

33 External debt in EUR t e r m s stood at 89.1 percent in 2007, due to the depreciation o f the US dollar. 

29 

Croatia: Country Partnership Strategy for FY09-FY 12 

preferred creditors as a share o f external public debt service i s expected to be about 10 percent during the 
CPS period, while the IE3RD debt service as a percentage o f exports o f goods and services w i l l remain 
low, at around 0.4 percent throughout the CPS period.

H. Risks 

97. 

T h e r e a r e th r e e main sources o f risks: 
0 External vulnerability; 
Uneven reform performance; and 
Capacity weakness. 

9 8 . 

C r o a t i a rema ins vu lne rab le to contag ion f r o m adverse e x t e rn a l developments. With an 
external debt-to-GDP ra t io o f 95.7 percent and a current account deficit o f 8 .6 percent at end-2007, 
Croatia remains exposed to unfavorable external developments, as described in the section on recent 
economic developments. Notwithstanding the above, the country has so fa r weathered the financial 
turbulence that followed the collapse o f the sub-prime market in the US, although some signs o f weakness 
have emerged, including a widening o f international bond spreads. I t has also remained largely unaffected 
by KOSOVO’S 
declaration o f independence, although tourism revenues may suffer in the summer. This 
shows that Croatia’s economic fundamentals have improved over time, its EU accession process i s seen 
as a solid anchor by external f inanc iers and that macroeconomic policies have remained largely on track. 
The implementation o f reforms under the PAL program over the past 3 years has contributed to improved 
macroeconomic stability. Continued prudent monetary policy and further significant f i s c a l consolidation 
in line with the government’s plan would be necessary fo r the reduction o f Croatia’s external 
vulnerability. Although public sector savings have improved over the past few years, private sector 
liabilities have been growing fast, and prudential and administrative monetary measures to halt credit 
growth and moderate external imbalances w i l l need to be accompanied by further e f fo r ts on the f i s c a l 
policy front.

99 . 

I t i s likely that reform performance will remain uneven. This i s in part because some o f the 

reforms, like the restructuring o f railways and shipyards, are politically difficult to implement, and in part 
because some o f the other reforms, such as the reform o f the judiciary and public administration, are 
complex and take time. In addition, the political environment might become more challenging over time 
given the realities o f the election cycle. There i s also uneven capacity in the administration to design and 
implement policies. There are three factors that can help mitigate this risk. First, there are certain areas 
where there i s general consensus to proceed. These include, among others, privatization and 
improvements in the investment climate. Second, there are several areas where the EU accession 
negotiations, the early completion o f which i s one o f the highest priorities o f the government, w i l l 
necessitate re fo rm implementation. These include, among others, judicial and public administration 
reform, the fight against corruption, state aid and agriculture policies. Third, the government received a 
second mandate in the 2007 November elections, and i s clearly aware that there i s now a window o f 
opportunity fo r reforms. 

100. Finally, project implementation risks remain. Capacity i s uneven and limited in several 
ministries and this may hinder implementation. In part to mitigate this risk, the lending program under 
the CPS includes a large number o f repeater-type or additional financing operations. Since such financing 
w i l l only be provided for satisfactory projects and the implementation structures are already in place, i t i s 
expected that project implementation performance w i l l improve across the portfolio. Further efforts w i l l 
also be made to ensure implementation readiness o f projects prior to Board presentation. Finally, the 
recent training activities in procurement, monitoring and evaluation, and Bank procedures i s also 
expected to yield results. As fo r the authorities, reducing the processing time for project effectiveness, 
allocating the necessary resources to create implementation capacity and strengthening the Ministry o f 
Finance’s coordination ro le and support function vis-a-vis the implementing agencies, could help improve 
implementation performance. Regular Joint Portfolio Reviews w i l l remain the key instrument for 
addressing cross-cutting issues. 

I V . Conclusion 

101. Croatia has achieved tremendous political and economic progress over the past 15 years. 
Incomes have doubled, and economic and social opportunities have dramatically improved. The Bank 
Group has been Croatia’s partner in its post-war recovery, economic transition and development. The 
government’s overarching priority i s to complete Croatia’s EU accession process, achieve rapid 
convergence o f its income level with that o f current EU member states in a fiscally, socially and 
environmentally sustainable fashion that would allow a decent quality o f l i f e for Croatia’s citizens. The 
Bank i s ready to provide continued support under this Country Partnership Strategy for the achievement 
o f this ambitious and worthwhile objective.

COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY 
ANNEX 2: COOPERATION W I T H THE EU 

As par t o f i t s strategy to support Croatia’s pre-accession re fo rm needs, the Bank w i l l continue to 
cooperate closely w i t h the European Comm iss ion (EC) through complementary projects and analytical 
and advisory services. The a im o f this cooperation i s to fac i l i ta te accession to and integration with EU, as 
we l l as support capac i ty-bu i ld ing to use EU structural and cohesion funds. 

Look ing ahead, the cooperation w i t h the European Comm iss ion w i l l focus on complementing the EU 
funds f rom the Instrument fo r Pre-Accession ( IPA) . A round EUR590 m i l l i o n have been made available 
to Croatia through I P A fund ing in 2007-2010, o f wh ich EUR446 .4 m i l l i o n wou ld be allocated through the 
Mu l t i -annua l Ind ica t ive P lann ing Document fo r 2008-20 10. Through investment operations, the Bank has 
already financed project preparation fo r upcom ing I P A funding, and w i l l remain open to s im i lar fac i l i t ies 
in future. G iven that P A funds represent re la t ive ly sma l l po r t ion o f resources needed fo r large 
investments per acquis requirements, the Bank aims to closely coordinate the d iv is ion o f labour (such as 
co- f inanc ing with P A ) to max im ize the donors’ efforts. 

EU Assistance to C r o a t i a 
I n 2007, the EU introduced a new financial assistance program - Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance (IPA) 
- available to Croatia and the neighboring countries, aimed towards preparing the country for EU membership. 
IPA has five components which address different and broad areas o f intervention, and also differ on i t s 
modalities (such as co-financing and programming procedures). The Multi-annual Indicative Financial 
Framework se ts the amount o f funds available fo r Croatia (EUR590 m i l l ion for 2007-2010), while the Mu l t i - 
annual Indicative Planning Document (MIPD) lays out the strategic priority areas in which assistance can be 
provided. The operational programs contain the ac tua l projects that are to be financed in each year. Government 
plays a critical r o l e in the programming and implementation o f the IPA funds, which requires setting up o f 
appropriate implementing bodies and their accreditation. The areas o f intervention (projects) are developed 
jo in t ly between the government and the European Commission, and the process envisages annual consultations 
with a l l stakeholders, including the IFIs. The Bank teams have so far participated in consultations held in 
B r u s s e l s and in Croatia, and have been able to review and provide comments to updates o f MIPDs and 
Operational Programs for various IPA components. 

In add i t ion t o cooperation w i t h the EC, the Bank’s program i s also coordinated with key European 
f inanc ia l institutions, such as the European Investment Bank and the European Bank fo r Reconstruction 
and Development. This cooperation i s also fac i l i ta ted by the Joint European Comm iss ion /Wor ld Bank 
O f f ice fo r Southeast Europe, based in B russe ls , wh ich i s serving as the secretariat o f the IF1 Adv iso ry 
Group and co-chaired by the EC34 . 

The Bank’s p r io r i ty areas fo r support include adjustment to pre-accession requirements, including in the 
areas o f environment and infrastructure development; support fo r sustainable agriculture, ru ra l and 
regional development, and social development (education and health); and cross-border and reg iona l co- 
operation. Assistance to strengthen institutions and regu la tory frameworks that support the countries’ 
adoption o f the EC acqu is ; analytical studies and pro jec t preparation are also important areas o f focus.

The World Bank has to date provided sizeable support to Croatia through financing projects that help the 
country meet EU accession requirements and which are closely integrated in to overall country 
development plans. There has also been close collaboration with the EC on the PAL program to ensure 
alignment with the EU integration agenda in areas such as public administration and judicial reform, 
business registration, regulatory framework, and privatization. Some examples o f c lose collaboration 
between the Bank and EC are provided in the box below.

Annex 2 

Completed, Ongoing and Proposed Projects and Analytical and Advisory Services 

Court and Bankruptcy Administration (completed): modernization o f selected commercial courts and 

increasing competence o f judges, other court staff and bankruptcy trustees, as a pilot for broader judicial 
reform; Integrated Case Management System (ICMS) developed and piloted/rolled out in several courts 
[Pula Municipal Court and Split Commercial Court, Zagreb Commercial Court; testing o f ICMS ongoing 
in Zagreb C iv i l and Penalty Courts); i n c lose coordination with the EU partners, including CARDS 
project. 

Karst Ecosystem Conservation (completed): institutional development for strengthening administration 
for the environment i s a high priority on Croatia’s EU agenda. The project made a substantial contribution 
to strengthen this capacity, which helped Croatia during the EU “screening” o f readiness fo r accession - 
as this sub-sector o f the nature protection was considered to be the most prepared. The Conservation and 
Rural Revitalization Grants program outcomes and lessons learned are relevant to the design o f EU 
agricultural funds programs for rural development (which includes Natura 2000). 

Living Standards Assessment (completed): The Living Standards Assessment offered datdanalysis 
relevant for the EU Joint Inclusion Memorandum (JIM), and a Na t iona l Regional Development Strategy 
and National Action Plan for Employment; provided recommendations on priorities for government; 
among which i s improving the quality and effectiveness o f social safety nets by improving the targeting of 
soc ia l benefits, to address the issues o f poverty and regional disparities. 

Public Finance Review (completed): analysed the f isca l consolidation challenges for Croatia given i t s 
accession e f fo r ts and explored ways to increase public sector efficiency, using experience from the reform 
efforts o f new EU member states. The particular emphasis was given to efficiency and effectiveness issues 
in education, pension, health, public administration, transport, subsidies and social benefit programs. 

Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC) for Accounting and Auditing (A&A) and 

Corporate Governance (completed): Assessed regulatory and institutional framework in view o f acquis 
requirements on corporate governance, financial reporting and auditing, and follow up on implementation 
o f A&A international standards. Carried out jointly by the Bank and the EU, through secondment o f an 
o f f i c i a l from the DG Internal Market. 

Real Property Registration and Cadastre Project (ongoing): EU has directly supported the project and 

Croatia’s overall cadastre and land registry reform program through three Bank-administered trust funds 
(total EUR 1 1.3 million) fully integrated into one operation with the Bank loan (harmonized procurement 
and financial management rules); Regular reporting, communication, and coordination among the Bank 
team, the EC Delegation office in Zagreb. 

Rijeka Gateway Project (ongoing): increasing the country’s trade competitiveness by improving the 
international transport chain through the Rijeka Port for both freight and passengers traffic. 
Modernization o f the port into a dominant traffic route in Croatia, connecting seaways with European 
road and railway corridors, as well as the t r a f f i c growth should make Rijeka one o f the main ports in 
Central and Eastern Europe due to established road transport through corridor V. With the accession, i t i s 
expected that the Croatian economy and its transport system w i l l become an integral part o f the EU 
transportation network.

Completed, Ongoing and Proposed Projects and Analytical and Advisory Services 

(con t inued f iom previous page) 
Agricultural Acquis Cohesion Project (ongoing): developing sustainable systems and capacities within 
the Ministry o f Agriculture, Fisheries and Rural Development to ensure timely compliance with EU 
acquis conditions in the rural sector. Advance fo r Project Preparation mobilized by the Bank to enable 
financing the preparation and setting o f SAPARD Agency institutional arrangement. 

Social and Economic Recovery Project (ongoing): enabled financing the preparation o f Regional 
Operational Programs (ROPs) in five counties in the areas o f special state concern, as to support the EU 
Regional Development requirements for Croatia; w i l l assist i n building capacity for participatory regional 
development and for the absorption o f pre-accession funds. 

In land Waters (Ongoing): increasing service coverage o f water supply and wastewater collection and 
treatment in inland part o f Croatia, to enable meeting the EU directives on water and wastewater. The 
technical assistance component w i l l assist in building investment pipeline that would be eligible to 
receive future EU funds, thus facilitating the absorption o f EU grants by Croatia. 

G E F Agricultural Pollution Control Project (ongoing) : aims to increase the use o f environmentally 
friendly agricultural practices by farmers in selected areas to reduce nutrient discharge from agricultural 
sources to surface and ground water bodies. The project activities are designed to support the country’s 
EU accession efforts by assisting the transposition o f the N i t ra te and Water Framework Directives. 

G E F Neretva and Trebisnjica Management Project (ongoing): regional project o f Croatia and Bosnia 
and Herzegovina aimed at improving water resource management at the Neretva and Trebisnjica river 
basins and the transboundary level; aims to maintain and conserve water-dependent ecosystems and 
associated biodiversity according to the requirements o f the EU Water Framework Directive and reduce 
water pollution to the Neretva and Trebisnjica river basin through high-priority investments in three 
municipalities and one industrial sector in Bosnia and Herzegovina. 

EU Convergence Report (ongoing): analyses the current factors and obstacles for faster productivity 
growth in Croatia given its EU accession and integration efforts and explores the ways to ensure 
sustainability o f long-term growth through increasing flexicurity and generation o f higher-value added, 
given the experiences o f the EU and OECD s t a r performers. 

Coastal Cities Pollution Control ZZ (proposed): envisages a scaled-up program from 11 to 3 6 
municipalities, aiming to further improve the quality o f Croatia’s coastal waters to meet EU ambient 
quality standards. The techn ica l assistance component would aim at financing the preparation o f projects 
for future financing by the EU’s Structural Funds and Cohesion Fund or co-financing by the other I F I s . I t 
would be complemented by GEF operation fo r nutrient reduction. 

Judicial Reform (proposed): w i l l aim to support the implementation o f the government’s Strategy o f the 
Reform o f the Judicial System: rationalization o f the court network, efficiency o f court proceedings and 
reduction o f case backlog through reform o f court administration and court financing, which i s in line 
with fulfilling the EU accession requirements in judiciary, in addition to continued development o f the 
ICMS and development o f s ta t is t ica l and performance monitoring systems 
for courts.

COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY 
ANNEX 3: F INANC IAL SECTOR UPDATE 

According to the la tes t Financial Sector Assessmen t Program (FSAP) Update conducted in 
October and November 2007, Croatia's f inanc ia l sector achieved progress s ince the las t 2002 
FSAP. Supported b y increasingly strong macroeconomic performance, both the banking and 
nonbank financial sector have grown significantly, while regulatory and supervisory frameworks 
have been strengthened, and financial sector infrastructure has improved as a result o f 
harmonization w i t h EU directives. 

Indicators o f external and financial vulnerability have been imp rov ing ever s ince 2000. Foreign 
banks account for more than 90.8 percent o f bank assets (June 2007), wh i le on ly two banks 
(postal bank included) remain state-owned, accounting for up to 4 percent o f banking assets. 
Credit i s comparatively high, at 82 percent o f GDP at the end o f 2007, w i t h more than 92 percen t 
going to the private sector. Bank capital has been strengthened in recent years w i t h privatization, 
and average capital i s n ow about $208 m i l l i o n (June 2007). Average assets per bank are about 
$1,879 m i l l i o n (June 2007). Average in te res t margin i s declining but s t i l l remains h igh at 5.9 
percentage points (end-2007). Overall, there i s a comparatively h igh level o f depth and resource 
mobilization. Minimum capital adequacy i s 10 percent, and banks are reported to be we l l 
capitalized (at 15.02 percent as per June 2007), and capital amounted to 11.5 percent o f assets. 
Non-performing loans further declined to 3.3 percent o f total loans b y June 2007, w i t h 
irrecoverable placements standing at 1.1 , though this indicator needs to be watched carefully, 
given i t s backward-looking nature and the rap id growth o f household debt w i t h large unhedged 
foreign exchange (FX)-linked component. 

Significant market risk remains in the system due to the h igh level o f foreign currency 
borrowings, although declining; at the end o f June 2007, 56.3 percent o f bank placements were 
exposed to FX-induced risks. In response, the Croatian National Bank (CNB) has introduced 
mandatory monitoring o f F X exposures o f bank clients. F X loans (including loans indexed to 
foreign exchange) indeed decreased as a percentage o f total loans f rom 71.7 percent at the end o f 
2006 to 61.4 percent at end. 

Financial soundness indicators suggest a reasonably healthy banking sector. P ro f i tab i l i ty has 
fallen slightly in recen t years, reflecting the e f f e c t s o f higher rese rve requirements and the 
narrowing in te res t margins under growing competition for market share. The bank supervisory 
framework i s broadly in l i n e w i t h international standards and EU Directives. O f particular 
importance i s the need to further strengthen effective cooperation between the CN B and home 
bank supervisors, inc lud ing through conduct o f j o i n t on-site inspections o f subsidiaries w i t h 
parent bank supervisors. Bo th the CN B and'major Croatian banks seems to be well-placed to 
cope w i t h the implementation o f Basel 11, wh ich w i l l become effective in January 2009. Wh i le 
the framework for risk-focused supervision i s s t i l l evolving, the current supervisory techniques 
and risk management processes do not appear 
to pose risks fo r successful Basel I 1 
implementation. 

The capital market i s getting stronger. There i s a h igh level o f concentration on the main market, 
w i t h the top 10 f i r m s in market capitalization accounting for most activity. Market capitalization 

42 

Croatia: Coun try Partnership Strategy fo r FY09-FY 12 

Annex 3 

grew markedly f rom around 50 percent at the end o f 2005 to 143 percen t o f GDP in 2007, w i t h 
the turnover ratio (value o f shares traded as % o f capitalization) o f 16.8 in 2007. Wh i le smaller 
than the banking sector, the systemic importance o f the nonbank financial sector has increased. 

There i s some lack o f clarity on the supervision o f the banking groups that include nonbanking 
operations. The framework for secu r i t ies , insurance and pension regulation and supervision i s 
largely in l i n e with international standards, though some weaknesses remain. HANFA, which 
was established in 2006 f rom the merger o f th ree sectoral regulators, i s coping w i t h many 
regulatory and legislative changes in harmonizing with the EU directives. A system o f risk- 
oriented supervision needs to be developed to include monitoring o f risks and iden t i fy ing 
supervisory measures fo r mitigating them. The reforms initiated in Croatia to address many o f 
the governance, accounting, and auditing issues should continue at a robust pace.

ANNEX 4: STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATIONS 

As part o f stakeholder consultations f o r the Coun t ry Partnership Strategy, a series o f 
meetings were h e l d in M a y 2008 with loca l authorities, the bus iness c omm u n i t y as w e l l as non -

V a r a i d i n and Vukova r . 

The f o l l ow i n g i s s u e s were iden t i f ied as key development challenges by the participants:

te r t ia ry education system i s n o t appropriately adopted t o the needs o f the labo r market e i the r 
as many graduates face d i f f i c u l t i e s in finding emp loymen t u p o n comp le t ing their studies, 
w h i l e ce r ta in sectors suffer f r o m shortage o f wo rke rs with appropriate s k i l l s . Doub le shift 
and triple shift schools in primary education need t o be e l im ina ted faster, and schools need to 
be equipped with appropriate lea rn ing tools. 

0 Equitable regional development. Equ i tab le development ranked high on the l i s t o f 
p r io r i t ies f o r a l l participants since C roa t ia i s characterized by diverse development across 

regions, ranging f r o m very developed regions to those s t i l l suffering f r o m the consequences 

o f war, In the r iche r counties, the re was a feeling o f resentment f o r the government’s lack o f 
support, while participants in war-affected parts o f the coun t ry wanted m o r e f inanc ia l and 
strategic support. Clearance o f a l l mines was considered a prerequisite f o r economic 
rev i ta l iza t ion in war-affected areas, and l e d to ca l ls for speedier de-mining e f fo r ts and more 
funds f o r this impo r tan t ac t iv i ty . Ano the r prerequisite f o r economic rev i ta l iza t ion in war- 
affected areas was the development and imp lemen ta t ion o f a comprehensive na t iona l 
reg iona l development strategy. Participants f r o m the war affected reg ions were concerned 
about the future, especially g iven the high l e v e l s o f m i g r a t i o n o f y o u n g people (de- 
popu la t ion ) due t o lack o f emp loymen t opportunities. Participants argued that mo re a t ten t ion 
should be devoted t o encouraging r u r a l development, n o t exc lus ive ly l i n k e d t o ag r icu l tu ra l 
activities, but also t o ac t iv i t ies such as eco-tourism, w h i c h w o u l d increase the qua l i ty o f l i f e 
in villages, create emp loymen t f o r young people and discourage migration t o bigger u rban 
areas. F o r this t o happen, participants ind ica ted that assistance in capacity building would be 
highly appreciated. In addition, participants f e l t that they were n o t inc luded enough or at a l l 
in the decision m a k i n g processes o f the central government. They ca l led f o r mo re 
cooperation between l o c a l authorities and central authorities, as we l l as inc lus ion o f other 
stakeholders in these processes. Ove ra l l , i t was no ted that th roughou t the coun t ry the reg iona l 
differences, even within short distances, are s ign i f ican t and should be addressed as a matter 
o f p r i o r i t y .

Social welfare and health. NGOs in the social welfare sector were concerned about the lack 
o f financing opportunities to help vulnerable groups and insufficient support f rom authorities 
for NGOs to provide social se rv ices . In addition, they also f e l t that not enough was being 
done to support deinstitutionalization. 
Instead o f supporting activities which promote 
inclusion and deinstitutionalization, they f e l t more effort was being exerted to renovate and 
bu i ld new institutions, contrary to the principle o f deinstitutionalization and p rov id ing 
opportunities for disabled citizens to integrate in to society. In t e r m s o f health, participants 
expressed their overall dissatisfaction w i t h the state o f the health system, the quality o f 
services and infrastructure. 

Investment climate. In a l l regions, participants were concerned about the need to facilitate 
doing business, starting f rom continuation o f the regulatory guillotine project, reducing 
administrative barriers and making processes more transparent and simple. The need for 
micro-financing opportunities were also expressed, since many small start-ups were no t 
eligible for existing financing arrangements (commercial bank loans, EU funds, state support 
for SMEs etc.) In more developed regions, participants f e l t that they were doing quite well 
and did not have serious issues w i t h the business climate. However, they d id lack financing 
for further investments and innovations to move away f rom traditional industries (leather and 
textiles) to innovative ones. In the l e s s developed areas o f Croatia, participants wanted to see 
more support fo r empowering women and youth so they can become invo lved in business 
and entrepreneurship, For a l l these i s s u e s to be addressed successfully, participants indicated 
that jud ic ia ry reforms need to proceed at a much faster pace and in a transparent manner. 

Environment. Wh i le a l l agreed that environment, nature protection, renewable energy 
resources and energy i s s u e s were important, the socio-economic issues discussed during the 
consultations were considered to be o f immediate concern and more instrumental to 
improving the quality o f l i f e . However, the need to focus on sustainable development and 
risk management, in v iew o f global developments (food c r i s i s and climate change) should not 
be disregarded, as these i s s u e s a re o f h igh significance fo r the future o f Croatia. 

0 European Integration. European accession i s viewed b y most participants in a positive l igh t 
and as an important goal fo r Croatia. However, concerns were expressed w i t h the l ow 
capacity for absorption o f EU funds and the need to strengthen the capacity o f a l l 
stakeholders, inc lud ing NGOs, to apply for available EU funding.

1. Introduction 
1. 
The Country Assistance Strategy Completion Report (CASCR) evaluates the 
effectiveness o f the Bank’s assistance to the Republic o f Croatia f o r meeting the 
development objectives set in the FYOS-OS Country Assistance Strategy (CAS). In October 
2005, the launch o f EU accession negotiations ma rked a c r i t ica l m i les tone in Croatia’s 
development path, b r i n g i n g with i t s ign i f ican t p o l i t i c a l and economic imp l ica t ions . This led the 
B a n k t o reassess the C A S and ta i lo r i t s assistance p rog ram t o focus o n Croatia’s accelerated EU 
accession efforts, as re f lec ted in the C A S Progress Repo r t presented t o the B o a r d in M a y 2007. 
2. 
This CASCR comes at the heels o f Croatia’s parliamentary elections at end-2007. I t 
examines the impact o f the CAS program at the end o f a political cycle and draws lessons 
o f experience fo r the new Country Partnership Strategy. Coun t ry - leve l indicators and 
selected intermediate indicators measuring progress towards Croatia’s 
long - te rm goals are 
p rov ided in Tab le 1. Progress towards a t ta in ing the C A S objectives i s summarized in Annex 1. 

2. Croatia’s Strategic Goals 
3 . 
Croatia’s overarching strategic objective i s to integrate with the EU as a dynamic 
and competitive economy and to achieve rapid convergence with EU living standards. A 
successful EU accession w i l l require re fo rms tha t w i l l lead to imp roved macroeconomic 
sustainability and sustained g r ow t h p r i o r t o accession. Th is strategic ob jec t ive has remained at 
the heart o f the government’s na t iona l agenda during the last p o l i t i c a l cycle. 
4. 
The strategic goals are clearly formulated in the Program o f the Government o f the 
Republic o f Croatia f o r the 2003-2007 Mandate, as well as in the 2006-2013 Strategic 
Development Framework (SDF) adopted in August 2006. They inc lude increasing average 
GD P growth rate t o six percen t by 2013 and ach iev ing up t o 75 percent o f the EU25 average 
GDP per cap i ta at PPP. The government plans t o achieve these goals b y : 
(i) Comp le t ing the transition, w h i c h includes redefining the r o l e o f the state, 
comp le t ing the p r iva t iza t ion and res t ruc tu r ing processes, and im p r o v i n g the inves tmen t 
climate; 
(ii) Developing infrastructure, i n c l u d i n g IC T ; im p r o v i n g education outcomes and 
R&D linkages t o the bus iness sector; inc reas ing f l e x i b i l i t y o f labo r markets; and 

strengthening social cohesion; and 

(iii) Sustaining and p romo t ing macroeconomic stability, environment and reg iona l 
development, and integrated f inanc ia l services. 
5 . 
The country development goals ( o r country-level outcomes) identified by the 
Government o f Croatia underpin the strategic framework o f the CAS. The C A S was

Croatia 's app l ica t ion f o r EU membership ind ica ted the s am e p r io r i t ies as se t ou t in the 
government program, and re in fo rced the course o f the B a n k program. T o support the 
government 's g r ow t h and r e f o rm strategy f o r successful EU accession, integration, and 
convergence, the C A S was centered o n fou r key p i l la rs : (i) macroeconomic stability; (ii) 
sustainable p r iva te sector-led g row th ; (iii) b road pa r t ic ipa t ion in growth; and (iv) sustainable

3. Progress and CAS Outcomes 
7. 
Croatia has made substantial progress in achieving its long-term goals during the 
CAS period. The C A S was designed at a t im e w h e n C roa t ia embraced successful accession t o 
the EU as i t s m a i n strategic objective, with a v i s i o n t o ach iev ing h ighe r l iv ing standards th rough 
accelerated EU convergence. Croatia’s macroeconomic s tab i l i ty has imp roved in recent years, 
though the vu lne rab i l i t ies remain, and so l id progress has been achieved in private sector-led 
g row th . Gains in social development, however, are less evident. Progress in managing na tu ra l 
resources in C roa t ia i s noteworthy, though this area continues t o require s ign i f ican t investments. 
The f o l l ow i n g sections review Croatia’s progress a long each o f the fou r C A S pillars and analyze 
the Bank ’s con t r ibu t ion t o the outcomes. 

3.1. Macroeconomic Stability 

3.1.1. Country-Level Indicators 
8 . 
A successful economic transformation after independence and the start o f EU 
accession negotiations have helped boost economic activity in recent years, with average 
GDP growth reaching 4.8 percent during the CAS period. I n f l a t i o n rema ined modest despite 
increased o i l and commod i ty prices, helped by the central bank’s e f fo r ts to ma in ta in exchange 
rate s tab i l i ty . Consumer p r ice i n f l a t i o n increased s l igh t ly f r o m 2.1 percent in 2004 to 2.9 percent 
in 2007 due t o higher prices f o r o i l , food, housing, and u t i l i t i e s . Nonetheless, the average 
i n f l a t i o n over the C A S pe r iod was 2.9 percent. The adverse terms o f trade shock, however, 
con t r ibu ted t o a w iden ing current account de f ic i t , even though f isca l p o l i c y has tightened since 
2003. The current account de f ic i t increased from 6.6 percent in 2005 t o 7.5 percent o f GD P in 
2006, and con t inued t o g r ow t o 8.6 percent o f G D P in 2007, despite strong g r ow t h in exports o f 
goods and services. Ove ra l l however, net cap i ta l i n f l ow s have consistently exceeded the current 
account de f ic i t , boos t ing fo re ign exchange reserves. 
9. 
The PAL se r ies helped the government implement a medium-term reform program 
to achieve growth and move c lo s e r to EU accession. The PAL re fo rms made s ign i f ican t 
con t r ibu t ions to f isca l conso l ida t ion e f fo r ts and t o an enhanced business c l ima te . The ob jec t ive 
o f the P A L was t o strengthen the p u b l i c sectors’ capacity and e f f ic iency , as well as t o create 
cond i t ions f o r p r iva te sector g row th . E f fo r ts t o reduce government expenditure f r o m more than 
50.5 percent o f GDP in 2003 were o n t rack until m id -2007 . Government spending f e l l by over 2 
percentage po in ts o f GD P by 2006. Howeve r , in 2007 expenditures grew moderately t o 48.6 
percent o f GDP . Robust g r ow t h performance, however, eased the primary f isca l de f ic i t f r o m 3.7 
percent o f GDP in 2003 t o 0.2 percent by the end o f 2007. De f ic i t - reduc t ion as well as 
p r iva t iza t ion receipts f r o m Te lecom and INA o i l company helped lowe r p u b l i c and p u b l i c l y 
guaranteed debt f r om 54 percent o f GD P in 2003 d ow n to 47.5 percent o f GD P in 2007. 
3.1.2. Status of key outcomes and intermediate indicators/milestones 
10. 
Sustainable levels o f public spending. Since early 2004, C roa t ia placed greater 
emphasis on f isca l conso l ida t ion p r im a r i l y th rough better expenditure con t ro l and imp rovemen ts 
in tax co l lec t ion and tax administration. Resu l ts were visible by the end o f 2004 when the 

49

Annex 5 : CAS Completion Report 

general government deficit declined f r o m 6.3 percent t o 4.9 percent o f GDP35 . The de f ic i t f e l l 
even further by 2007 t o 2.3 percent o f GDP . Howeve r , spending cuts were f a l l i n g beh ind de f ic i t - 
reduc t ion efforts. The size o f the state remains high by in te rna t iona l standards; at above 48 
percent o f GD P in 2008, i t i s some 10 percentage points h ighe r than government expenditures o f 
new EU member states. The re fo rm p rog ram supported b y the PAL s e r i e s envisaged a reduc t ion 
in to ta l p u b l i c spending t o 45 percent o f GD P b y 2008, but C roa t ia w i l l f a l l short o f this target as 
a resu l t o f a surge in pre-election spending in 2007. A d ra f t Public Finance Review was 
completed in early 2007, with recommendations o n cu t t ing buoyan t expenditures, im p r o v i n g 
efficiency and effectiveness, and f isca l conso l ida t ion towards a balanced budget pos i t ion . 
F ina l ly , th rough a Bank-supported Pension System Investment Project, the system to channel 
second pension pillar con t r ibu t ions i n t o the selected pension funds has been established (99.6 
percent o f con t r ibu t ions reaches i n d i v i d u a l accounts within 48 hours). Mo reove r , the co l lec t ion 
o f social insurance con t r ibu t ion has been imp roved , thus reduc ing the burden o f the second pillar 
t rans i t ion costs by mo re than one-half. 
11. 
Fiscally sustainable public wage bill. Spending cuts were achieved by end-2006 
th rough reductions in p u b l i c adm in is t ra t ion wage bill, subsidies, as well as p u b l i c investment in 
h ighways in particular. Pub l ic adm in is t ra t ion and p u b l i c expenditure management have been 
strengthened in the past couple o f years. The PAL has emphasized measures tha t reduce the size 
and p romo te the e f fec t iveness o f p u b l i c administration, and enhance the e f f ic iency o f p u b l i c 
expenditure management. The p u b l i c sector wage b i l l was reduced f r o m 11 percent o f GD P in 
2003 t o 9.6 percent o f G D P in 2007. While the p u b l i c sector wage b i l l dec l ined since the launch 
o f the P A L ser ies , i t remains high by in te rna t iona l standards, and w o u l d need t o be further 
pruned in the ques t t o reduce the size o f the state. 
12. 
Subsidy reduction. The government supported nonv iab le state-owned en te rp r ises 
th rough generous subsidies, transfers, and guarantees. To b r i n g enterprise subsidies down t o EU 
levels, the Croatian authorities imp lemen ted the Enterprise Sector M e d i um -T e rm Subsidy 
Reduc t ion Plan, gradually but steadily reduc ing subsidies since the P A L launch. Under PAL1, 
the Croatian authorities prepared an inven to ry o f d i rec t and ind i rec t subsidies, and aligned the i r 
me thodo logy with the EU state a i d guidelines using Technical Assistance Loan I 1 proceeds. As 
pa r t o f the subsidy reduc t ion plan, the government set an ove ra l l annual c e i l i n g t o to ta l subsidies, 
l ow e r i n g i t f r o m one year t o the next. Res t ruc tu r ing o f C roa t ian Ra i lways (HZ) - also supported 
under the PAL p rog ram - l e d to a dec l ine in subsidies b y 0.6 percent o f G D P over the C A S 
pe r iod . However, one -o f f debt-equity swaps f o r the s t e e l industry p r i o r t o p r iva t iza t ion as well 
as rescue a i d f o r shipyards put an upward pressure o n the subsidies leve l . The largest recipients 
remained large loss-makers like shipyards, f o r w h i c h a res t ruc tu r ing p rog ram i s awa i t ing the 
European Commission’s approval. Ove ra l l , en te rp r ise subsidies were reduced f r o m 3.4 percent 
o f GDP in 2003 t o 3.1 percent o f GDP in 2004, 2.8 percent in 2005 and 2.3 percent in 2006, as 
w e l l as in 2007 (preliminary), which i s c lose to the PA L target o f 2.2 percent o f GDP . 
13. 
Road sector spending. Croatia’s past heavy investment in mo to rways has come at the 
expense o f ma in ta in ing the non -mo to rway ne two rk and resulted in considerable f inanc ia l 
ob l iga t ions t o service the debt needed t o finance th is investment, The government’s road sector 
spending f o r the 2005-2008 pe r iod amounted t o 2.8 percent o f GD P per annum, with a re la t ive 
decline in new cons t ruc t ion spending and an increased share f o r road maintenance. This

represented major savings and efficiency gains, given the pre-2005 investment spending levels 
wh ich exceeded 4 percent o f GDP. B y 2008, the construction o f new roads i s targeted to dec l ine 
towards 1.5 percent of GDP, while maintenance w i l l remain stable at approximately 1 percent o f 
GDP per year. These efforts have been carried out in l i n e w i t h the Program for Construction and 
Maintenance o f Public Roads 2005-2008, agreed with the Bank, and adopted b y the government, 
as part o f the CAS h i g h case triggers. 
14. 
Health spending. The Croatian health system has performed relatively we l l compared to 
neighboring countries in t e rm s o f health achievements; however, these r e s u l t s have come at a 
h igh cost and the public health insurance fund faces growing de f ic i ts , posing considerable fiscal 
risks. The Croatian Health Financing Study, wh ich was completed in June 2003, analyzed the 
financing o f the sector and made recommendations for reform. The in i t ia l plans supported b y the 
PAL program were considered overly ambitious and the government undertook a more limited 
approach to system re fo rm b y slightly reducing the basic package (for some brand named-drugs), 
l im i t i n g co-payment exemptions b y strengthening income-testing mechanism as we l l introducing 
an administrative f la t fee to limit excess demand. Public spending on health has declined since 
the launch o f the PAL program f rom 6.4 percen t o f GDP in 2004 to an estimated 6 percent o f 
GDP in 2007. However, arrears created b y hospitals remained sizeable at 0.7 percent o f GDP and 
points to the need fo r further reform efforts to make the system financially sustainable. 
15. 
Soc ia l benefits spending. Total spending on social b e n e f i t s declined s ince 2003, a lbe i t 
moderately. 
In early 2004, a number o f enhanced categorical benefit packages were 
reintroduced, inc lud ing child, maternity, and war veteran benefits, along w i t h tax exemptions. As 
a result, total social benefit spending rose to 3.84 percent o f GDP in 2004, and spending on less 
well-targeted benefits increased. At estimated 3.75 percent o f GDP in 2007, total spending 
remains h igh compared to the EU average o f 2.5 percent o f GDP. Under PAL2, the government 
adopted a social benefit spending reform strategy, wh ich aims to consolidate more than one 
hundred existing social benefit programs, strengthen their administration, and inc rease the share 
o f funds allocated to means-tested bene f i ts to reduce poverty. The strategy takes in to account 
several o f the recommendations provided to the government through the Living Standard 
Assessment done in 2006. The share o f targeted programs remained l o w however, declining 
from 9.3 percent o f total in 2004 to 8.0 percent in 2007, due to increased funding for categorical 
bene f i ts . However, a recen t decision t o increase the support allowance (a means-tested poverty 
benefit) f rom HRK 400 to HRK 500 i s a step in the r igh t direction and w i l l increase the relative 
share o f means-tested bene f i ts . 
16. 
Debt management. External imbalances remain large despite fiscal tightening in 2004- 
2006 and efforts b y monetary authorities to curb foreign bo r row ing b y domestic banks. The 
renewed increase in the current account deficit in 2006 and 2007 and the r is ing in external debt 
r e f l e c t private sector imbalances, w i t h savings among companies and households lagging 
investment outlays. External debt more than doubled since 1997, and remains a source o f 
potential vulnerability. External debt (in EUR t e rm s ) rose f rom 85.5 percen t in 2006 to 87.7 
percen t o f GDP b y the end o f 2007. The government’s external debt declined f rom 25.3 percent 
in 2004 to 17.7 percen t o f GDP at the end o f 2007, while the external debt o f domestic banks and 

other sectors (mostly en te rp r ises ) increased to 46.3 percent o f GDP in 2007. As a resu l t o f 

monetary po l icy restrictions, the external debt o f banks dropped to 23.6 percen t o f GDP. The 
government’s share declined in the las t two years due to a shift o f de f ic i t financing f rom foreign 
to domestic markets in order to reduce foreign currency exposure. This was achieved as a part o f

the medium-term debt management strategy adopted in 2006, informed by the jo in t Wor ld 
B a nM IM F Program on Sovereign Debt Management and Debt Markets Development. 

3.2. Sustained private sector-led growth 
3.2.1. Country-Level Indicators 
17. 
Croatia has enjoyed solid econom ic growth s ince 2004, which averaged 4.8 percent 
during 2004-2007 with inflation in the low single digits (below 3 percent). These numbers 
compare w e l l both w i t h the ten new EU member states (EU1036), as we l l as the EU15, and 
allowed for faster Croatian convergence. Labor productivity, wh ich averaged 5.1 percen t during 
CAS period, and h igh capital i n f l ow with foreign direct investments (FDI) at above 5.7 percent 
of GDP per year, supported overall growth. A large part o f FD I , however, came f rom the 
privatization o f state-owned companies (SOEs) and recapitalization o f the banking sector. Higher 
in f lows o f greenfield investment are s t i l l constrained b y sizeable administrative barriers, in 
particular at the lower levels o f government. The presence o f the state in the economy has been 
reduced, though i t i s s t i l l significant and wou ld need further downsizing. Consequently, although 
Croatia’s private sector share o f GDP has r i s e n from 60 to 70 percent between 2003 and 2007, i t 
i s s t i l l much lower than that o f the EU10. S t i l l weak functioning o f the judiciary, h i g h 
administrative burden on bus inesses , unfinished privatization and soft budget constraints on 
en te rp r ises have limited en te rp r ise restructuring and new bus iness creation, wh ich has 
constrained growth. 

3.2.2. Status o f key outcomes and intermediate indicators/milestones 
18. 
Privatization. The progress achieved b y Croatia towards privatization o f SOEs has been 
supported b y the P A L ser ies . B y end-2007, around 860 companies were sold or liquidated, 
including the privatization o f almost a l l agri-combinats, as we l l as the loss-making s t e e l mills 
(Sisak and Split) and aluminum industry ( T L M Sibenik). The privatization o f tourism companies 
and shipyards i s s t i l l pending. This w i l l need to be addressed in the near future, given the 
investment needs for technological and physical modernization and the more r i g i d state aid ru les , 
required b y the legislation harmonized with the acquis. The Bank supported the government’s 
analytical needs through the Benchmarking Study for f ive state-owned shipyards against top 
world competitors as we l l as Social Impact Assessment for two shipyards undergoing 
restructuring. There was also some progress towards the divestiture o f subsidiaries o f Croatian 
railways (HZ), w i t h two out o f sixteen companies privatized in 2007, one f i l i n g bankruptcy in 
January 2008 and six more prepared for privatization b y June 2008. The privatization process 
has been informed b y the Restructuring Strategy developed b y McK insey and financed through 
the Bank PP IAF . 
19. 
Investment climate and business environment. In mid-2007, the government launched 
the regulatory guillotine to abolish outdated legislation posing barriers to business. Among other 
things, the government established one-stop shops to s imp l i fy bus iness startup. At the same 
time, the new L aw on Physical Planning and Construction was enacted in the Parliament, aimed 
at reducing the number o f construction-related pe rm i ts and duration for their approval, as i t has

been agreed under the PAL program. Croatia has also made important achievements in reducing 
the time to register property, f rom 3-4 years to less than 6 months. This was supported b y the 
R e a l P r o p e r t y R e g i s t r a t i o n a n d C a d a s t r e P r o j e c t . This reduction has contributed t o much 
improved access to credit. These improvements have placed Croatia among the t e n top 

re fo rme rs , as r e f l e c t e d in the Do ing Bus iness 2008 Report. 

20. 
M a r k e t - o r i e n t e d R&D system. The government has made solid progress to increase i t s 
R&D, and science and technology generation capacity. Steady progress was observed in recen t 
years, and a major milestone was acheived b y the adoption o f the f i r s t integrated Science and 
Technology (S&T) Policy 2006-2010 and Ac t ion Plan, completed in June 200737. The po l icy i s 
closely linked w i t h the National Strategy fo r Development o f S&T (2002) aimed at increasing 
competitiveness o f the economy in v iew o f the EU integration process. The Policy se ts out a 
number o f objectives aimed at creating a more supportive legislative and regulatory framework 
for S&T, increasing commercialization o f research and development (R&D) and facilitating 
innovation. The government demonstrated i t s commitment to intensifying R&D in the industry 
and stimulating demand for R&D s e r v i c e s b y establishing a high-level body, led b y the Prime 
Minister, to monitor implementation o f the Ac t ion Plan. The Bank i s supporting the 
government's broad agenda through restructuring parts o f the research, development and 
innovation infrastructure to better integrate them w i t h the needs o f the economy (while 
maintaining the excellence o f research). Strengthening linkages between the industry and the 
research community i s o f particular importance. After i n i t i a l d i f f icu l t ies , the Science a n d 
Techno logy P r o ' e c t has been progressing we l l and became instrumental in supporting the 
project agencies3' efforts to build a solid pipeline o f activities related to commercialization o f 
intelectual property and knowledge, as we l l as technology transfer and technology in f ras t ruc tu re 
development. 
21. 
J u d i c i a l r e f o rm , Given the importance o f a sound and e f f i c i e n t legal system for 
promoting o f investment and growth, h igh p r io r i ty i s attached to strengthening the judiciary. 
Croatia has made some progress in mov ing towards rationalization o f the court system, but no 
efficeincy gains have been achieved so far. The p i lo t mergers o f misdemeanor courts w i t h 
municipal courts, launched in 2006, did not achieve the desired r e s u l t s in t e rm s o f efficiency. In 
April 2007, a plan for the merger of courts was adopted, and the government submitted t o the 
Parliament the draft law that wou ld downsize the court network f rom 107 courts to 65. W i t h 
respec t to the court case backlog, the target that has been agreed under the PAL has been 
exceeded, w i t h the backlog reduced by 65% f rom April 2004 to June 2007 ( f rom 1.64 to 0.59 
m i l l i o n cases). Land registration cases alone formed about 50-60 percent o f the backlog, and this 
reduction has been largely supported b y the R e a l P r o p e r t y R e g i s t r a t i o n and C a d a s t r e P ro jec t . 
B y supporting the amendments to the Land Registry Act, the project helped eliminate one o f the 
key sources o f inefficiency and backlog, the non-adjudicative functions that judges were tasked 
with - such as land registration and t i t l ing , maintenance o f the company registry, execution of 
judgments, supervision o f elections, and other administrative tasks. These tasks have now been 
almost completely transferred f rom judges to other bodies. Finally, the Integrated Case 
Management System, which has been ro l led out in several courts in Zagreb, Split and Pula in

22. 
Public administration. C roa t ia has made impo r tan t progress in im p r o v i n g the e f f ic iency 
o f pub l ic administration, a prerequisite f o r e f fec t ive p o l i c y imp lemen ta t ion and pub l ic service 
delivery, as well as one o f the key requirements f o r EU accession. In order t o share the lessons 
lea rned f r om the EU, a wo rkshop was organized in 2005 t o assist the government efforts t o 
r e f o rm p u b l i c administration. The Technical Assistance Loan I 1 and Sida Trust Fund f o r 
Support to Public Administration Reform supported government e f fo r ts in designing salary 
systems f o r c i v i l , p u b l i c and l o c a l government servants and imp lemen t ing func t iona l rev iews o f 
l i n e m in is t r ies and state adm in is t ra t ive agencies t o i n f o r m ra t iona l iza t ion plans. Two county 
o f f ices have undertaken ra t iona l iza t ion based o n the recommendations f r o m the p i l o t review, and 
a new in te rna l o rgan iza t ion o f the M i n i s t r y o f Hea l th and Soc ia l We l fa re was rationalized. The 
PAL p rog ram has further supported the government in these e f fo r ts b y supporting the 
in t roduc t ion o f merit-based pay and p romo t ion systems f o r c i v i l service. A n ew C i v i l Service 
L a w has been enacted, a im i n g at the depo l i t ic iza t ion and p ro fess iona l iza t ion o f the top l e v e l o f

be enacted by September 2007, but the process has been de layed in the p re -e lec t ion period. 
F ina l ly , the p o l i c y process has been strengthened th rough the in t roduc t ion o f mandatory f isca l 
assessment, supported by the IDF grant fo r Strengthening Budget Management, regu la to ry 
impac t assessment, and social and env i ronmen ta l impacts o f p o l i c y and leg is la t ive proposals 
(supported by EU and UNDP ) . 
23. 
Transport and logistics. The mode rn iza t ion and res t ruc tu r ing o f the po r t o f Rijeka, 
supported by the Rijeka Gateway Project, imp roved the e f f ic iency o f the po r t and increased i t s 
competitiveness. Po r t t r a f f i c doubled f r o m 2. 5 m i l l i o n tons in 2000 t o 5.0 m i l l i o n tons in 2006. 
Container t r a f f i c increased s ign i f ican t ly f r o m 12,700 containers (TEU) in 2001 t o 94,400 TEU in 
2006. Po r t development was better integrated with i t s surroundings, with the construction o f 
international connection roads around R i j e k a to p rov ide shorter and q u i c k routes f o r heavy t r a f f i c 
t o reach the port. Sharp growth in container t ra f f ic th rough the R i j e k a po r t has been recorded (40 
percent in 2007), as w e l l as g r ow t h o f 36 percent o f transit th rough the Ploce port, thus bringing 
b o t h ports close t o full capacity f o r spec i f ic type o f cargoes. These achievements have imp roved 
their f inanc ia l situation, exceeding targets f o r R i j e k a po r t . Since the Trade and Transport 
Integration Project, co - f inanced by EBRD, became e f fec t ive in M a r c h 2007, the cooperation o f 
ra i lway companies a long co r r ido r V c increased. In this segment, the p ro jec t i s b u i l d i n g pa r t ly o n 
the e f fo r ts o f the Bank - funded Railway Modernization and Restructuring Project, which 
fac i l i ta ted the process o f mode rn iz ing the C roa t ian Ra i lways through s ign i f ican t phys ica l 
investments. Trade in the reg ion and exports f r o m C roa t ia increased in the past years, also as a 
resu l t o f major customs mode rn iza t ion and reduced delays at bo rde r crossing (on average by 65 
percent between 2000 and 2005), as w e l l as reduced cost o f good transportation, w h i c h was 
supported by the Trade and Transport Facilitation in Southeast Europe Project. 
24. 
Productivity growth. The B a n k has engaged with re leven t government agencies in 
assessing the cu r ren t factors and obstacles fo r faster p r o d u c t i v i t y g r ow t h in C roa t ia g iven i t s

Faster and Sustainable Economic Convergence. The study explores ways to ensure 
sustainability of long-term growth through increased "flexicurity" and the generation o f higher- 
value added through a knowledge-based economy. I t w i l l also help identify alternative se ts o f 
reform packages, designed to ensure faster and sustainable economic convergence w i t h the EU. 
As a part o f this analytical work, the Bank conducted a Product Market Regulation study, 
whereby Croatia's normative regulation i s being benchmarked against the OECD countries, as 
we l l as an Investment Climate Assessment that looks at h ow bus inesses perceive obstacles for 
further p roduc t iv i ty growth. 
25. 
I F C in Croatia. Du r ing the CAS period, I FC focused i t s efforts on supporting post- 
privatization restructuring in key sectors w i t h a p r io r i ty in tourism, agribusiness/food processing, 
support to SMEs, and facilitating retail in f ras t ruc tu re development. W i t h the objective o f helping 
domestic companies become competitive regionally through improved corporate governance, 
environmental standards, and best practices, IFC has made substantial investments o f US$104 
m i l l i o n in agribusiness and tourism sectors. I FC supported a pioneering company in tourism 
industry, through a corporate loan, as we l l as an equity investment, to help i t implement financial 
restructuring, aimed at strengthening i t s financial situation and supporting i t s expansion in the 
region. As part o f i t s support to the SME sector, IFC provided a loan to one o f the leading 
commercial banks in the country to expand lending activities, among others, in small and 
medium-sized en terpr ises . In the corporate sector, IFC has supported a large German discount 
retailer to facilitate the FDI in Croatia. The Croatian government requested IFC 's assistance in 
imp rov ing the quality o f regulations affecting the start up and operation o f businesses. In 2006, 
the government initiated the Regulatory Gu i l lo t ine exercise which was designed and 
implemented w i t h support f rom IFC 's FIAS, j o i n t l y with USAID. After completion o f the f i r s t 
phase, the government issued a decision to accept the recommendations including the 
elimination or simplification o f 5 5% o f a l l inventoried bus iness regulations. Based on 
preliminary estimates, these reforms w i l l save bus inesses some US$ 250 m i l l i o n in compliance 
costs. 

3.3. Broad participation in growth 

3.3.1. Country-Level Indicators 
26. 
The CAS period saw an increase in the adult population with secondary education39 
and improvements in tertiary education coverage and to some extent in eff i~ iency .~ ' The 
share o f adult population w i t h secondary education increased f rom below 60 percent in 2003 t o 
63 percent in the third quarter o f 2007. This i s a r e s u l t o f efficiency and quality improvements in 
the Croatian pre-tertiary education system. Enrollment rates have improved at a l l levels, 
particularly in pre-school and secondary education4', and completion rates remained high42. 
Croatian tertiary education s t i l l faces significant efficiency issues due to h igh dropouts; however

Due to more accurate data, the baseline and the expected outcomes for adult population w i th secondary education have been 
reset. 
A t the moment there are data limitations to assess change in tertiary education drop out rates as a measure o f institutional 
efficiency. However, available data show increase i n enrollment rates and the number o f higher education graduates during 
the CAS period. 
Preschool net enrollment rate went up from 43 percent in 2003 to 54 percent i n 2007 and secondary net enrollment rate rose 
to 80.6 in 2007 . 
Primary completion rate at above 99 percent, wh i le the secondary completion rate reached 91.3 percent in 2007 . 

5 5 

Croatia: Country Partnership Strategy for FY09-FY 12 

Annex 5 : CAS Completion Report 

the system has managed to attract a higher number o f entrants, so the number o f graduates during 
the CAS period increased. Tertiary education gross enrollment rate increased f rom 43 percent in 
2003 to 53 percent in 2007, while the system produced 24 percent more graduates in 2007 than 
in 2003. Croatia was, for the f i r s t time, able to benchmark achievement o f i t s students w i t h the 
European and OECD countries as i t jo ined the 2006 P ISA assessment, wh ich focused primary on 
science. Croatian students performed relatively w e l l vis-a-vis other European countries, 
particularly in science, wh i le the r e s u l t s in mathematics and reading were relatively lower. 
Croatia also managed to increase the share o f employed persons in the working-age population 
during the CAS period ( f rom 43 percent in 2003 to over 45 percen t in the third quarter o f 2007). 
I t has been a good performer in health outcomes, w i t h many outcomes at or above the average 
fo r new EU member states. Important achievements in the health sector include the reduction in 
infant mortality (from 6.3 in 2003 to 5.2 in 2006 per 1,000 l ive births) and in inc idence o f TB 
f rom 34 cases in 2003 to 25 in 2006). However, maternal mortality increased f rom 7.6 in 2003 to 
9.7 deaths per 100,000 l ive births in 2006 (four deaths at birth in 2006, as compared to th ree 
deaths in 2003 and 2005), wh ich i s significantly above the EU-27 average o f 6.5. 

3.3.2. Status of key outcomes and intermediate indicators/milestones 
27. 
S ince 2004, Croatia embarked upon many 
Strengthening system management. 
important education reforms articulated in the government’s Education Sector Development Plan 
2005-201 0 and supported b y the Education Sector Development Project. N e w National 
Educational Standards stipulating new learning outcomes and student-centered teaching methods 
and influencing curriculum reform in primary education, have been f u l l y rolled out. 
Furthermore, an External Assessment Center has been established and external assessments were 
successfully introduced at different levels o f pre-tertiary education, preparing students for the 
secondary school-leaving “matura” exam fo r the end o f the 2008-2009 school year. Even though 
the government d id not achieve i t s original goal o f extending compulsory education to the 
secondary education level b y 2007, a se t o f incentives fo r pupils to enter and complete secondary 
education have been implemented (such as f ree textbooks, transportation and accommodation). 
The government aims to legislate the extension o f compulsory education during i t s new te rm . 
Early progress has been achieved in modernizing the system o f continuous professional 
development (CPD) fo r teachers and school principals (work on a strategy for the CPD o f 
teachers has kicked o f f ; a new model fo r training principals has been developed and an in i t ia l 
group o f principals i s being trained in cooperation with the Dutch government). However, this 
part o f the system i s s t i l l widely seen as inadequately reformed. 
28. 
Increased student performance. The Education Sector Development Project annually 

monitors progress in the implementation o f the Education Sector Development Plan through a se t 

o f indicators, most o f wh ich have been recording an upward trend. Secondary education 
completion rate increased f rom 78 percen t in 2003 to 91.3 percent in 2005. Croatia’s 15-year- 
olds, for the first time, benchmarked their knowledge w i t h their peers in EU and OECD 
countries as part o f P ISA 2006. Croatian students performed relatively well in science (the 
primary focus in this P ISA round), with their scores fa l l ing in l i n e with the average resu l ts fo r 
EU countries. 
In reading and mathematics, they performed slightly be low EU and OECD 
students. So far, Croatia has managed to reduce the share o f VET students in the total secondary 

5 6

Annex 5 : CAS Completion Report 

enrollment43 (from 71.0 percent in 2004/05 t o 69.6 percent in 2007/08), but at a slightly slower 
pace than targeted. The latest reduc t ion in the VET enrollments v is -a -v is gymnas ium enrollments 
indicates, however, that i f the education authorities continue this progress, they c o u l d come close 
t o the 65 percent target by 2010. The expected C A S outcome o f decreasing the p ropo r t ion o f 
pupils in multi-shift schools from 90 percent t o 50 percent was n o t reached. Given the huge 
fiscal cost required t o reach this target, i t was an over op t im is t ic goal. S t i l l , C roa t ia did make 
progress in e l im ina t ing three-shift schools, as i t launched a ma jo r inves tmen t program, co-funded 
by the Education Sector Development Project, t o e l im ina te a l l th ree -sh i f t schools and increase 
the number o f single-shift schools b y 20 10. 
29. 
Improved quality o f and access to health care services. C roa t ia has achieved many

a re la t ive ly high cost: hea l th expenditures increased f r o m 8.2 percent o f GD P in 2003 t o 8.4 
percent o f GD P in 2006). The share o f p r im a r y hea l th care expenditure in to ta l hea l th spending

Sustained increase in labor fo rce participation and reduction in poverty rates. 
C roa t ia has a very l o w emp loymen t - to -popu la t ion ratio, in sp i te o f a m i n o r increase that occurred 
during the C A S pe r iod ( f r om 43% in 2003 t o 44% in 2007). A l t h o u g h the unemp loymen t rate 
has declined r a p i d l y ( f r om 14.3% in 2003 t o 8.4% in Q3 2007), the emp loymen t - to -popu la t ion 
ra t io has remained l o w because o f a further decline in the labo r fo rce pa r t ic ipa t ion rate t o b e l ow 
49 percent. The Bank ’s Living Standards Assessment conducted in 2006 showed that absolute 
pove r ty remained l i t e r a l l y unchanged during the C A S pe r iod at 1 1.1 percent4’. Croatia’s 
inequa l i ty i s o n l y slightly higher than the EU15 average and the soc ia l bene f i t spending are some 
tw o percentage po in ts o f GD P h ighe r than the EU15. The ta rge t ing e f f ic iency o f the social 
bene f i t p rog ram i s high, but the p rog ram remains re la t ive ly underfunded. Re la t ive poverty46, o n 
the other hand, has mildly decreased during the C A S pe r iod t o 16.3 percent. The tw o mos t 
impo r tan t con t r ibu to rs t o this reduc t ion were the g r ow t h in rea l wages and an increase in 
maternity and c h i l d benefits. During the design o f the CAS , i t was expected that pove r ty rates 
w o u l d be reduced by im p r o v e d ta rge t ing th rough means-testing f o r an increased share o f social 
benefits, but this did not materialize. In 2007, as pa r t o f the PA L program, the government

Maternal mortality rate decreased from 7.6 deaths per 100,000 l ive births in 2003 to 7.1 i n 2005 (EU-27 i s at 6.52 in 2005), 
however the rate for 2006 i s 9.7, due to four deaths i n 2006, as compared to three deaths at b ir th in 2003 and 2005 (Croatia

developed a strategy and action plan for reform o f social benefit spending and increasing the 
share o f benefits going to the most disadvantaged; the strategy implementation has been 
somewhat delayed due to a slower pace o f reforms in the pre-election period, w i t h major 
decisions on increased poverty benefits, 
consolidation o f programs and administrative 
simplification taking p lace at the beginning o f 2008. The Bank also provided assistance to the 
sector through the Soc ia l W e l f a r e D e v e l o pm e n t P r o j e c t , wh ich supported improvements in 
system management and training for social workers to build a better functioning system for those 
most in need. 
3 1. 
O v e r c om i n g r e g i o n a l d ispa r i t ies . Croatia’s poor are predominantly less-educated and 
elderly, and poverty tends to be concentrated in the ru ra l Central and Eastern parts o f the 
country. Structural unemployment, inadequate s k i l l s and activation policies as well as poor 
targeting o f the social safety net are the main causes o f income poverty. In 2006, the Bank 
conducted a Soc ia l I m p a c t Assessment ( S I A ) for the proposed restructuring o f the Brodotrogir 
and K ra l jev ica shipyards to address labor dislocation anticipated in the in i t ia l ly planned 
divestitures. M i t iga t ion measures proposed in the SIA were discussed w i t h the shipyards’ 
management, trade unions and the government, and have informed the restructuring plans 
submitted to the EC for approval, wh ich i s s t i l l pending. 
32. 
S t ra tegy f o r r e g i o n a l deve lopmen t . In 2005, an integrated framework fo r the National 
Strategy fo r Regional Development (NSRD ) 2007-20 13 was approved by inter-ministerial 
coordination group, wh ich presented the groundwork to enable a l l parts o f the country to 
contribute to sustainable national development and competitiveness, and to reduce social and 
economic disparities across the country. A draft Ac t on Regional Development and a Regional 
Development Strategy have been prepared, wh ich s t i l l need to be further aligned w i t h the EU 
Cohesion po l icy for managing regional development in Croatia, bo th at the NU T S 2 and NUTS 3 
level. The revision o f the L aw and the Strategy i s closely connected w i t h the negotiations o f 
Chapter 22 (Regional po l icy and coordination o f structural instruments). The L i v i n g S tanda rds 
Assessment and R e g i o n a l D e v e l o pm e n t S t u d y provided inputs to the strategy formulation 
process b y p rov id ing data and analysis on regional disparities at the county-level, and compiling 
a variety o f development indicators f rom diverse data sources. Du r ing the CAS period, Croatia 
focused on developing capacity at the county-level to prepare fo r the absorption o f EU funds fo r 
regional development, and has achieved considerable progress. B y the end o f 2007, a l l 
counties47, with the exception o f the C i ty o f Zagreb, elaborated their Regional Operational

Croatia has accelerated i t s efforts to develop agriculture to ensure a more equitable regional 
development and increase the competitiveness o f the economy. One o f the preconditions for the 
development o f this spec i f ic sector i s to carry out the demining o f war-affected areas. Six million

development and environment. Croatia i s currently in the process o f extending the completion 
target o f demining to 2019, in l i n e with the obligations under the Otawa Convention. W i t h 
respec t to sector-specific efforts, Croatia has made significant progress in aligning i t s legislation 
w i t h the EU acquis in the agriculture sector. These efforts have been supported b y the Bank’s 
Ag r icu l tu ra l Acquis Cohesion Project, wh ich helped Croatia set the SAPARD program and 
related institutional arrangements, such as the Paying Agency. The project i s contributing to 
bu i ld ing the capacity o f the Croatian Food Agency, as we l l as supporting the institutional setup 
for food safety management and food risk assessment, wh ich i s among the key EU requirements 
in the sector. In i t ia l s teps were taken w i t h respec t to the completion o f the food safety 
management database, wh ich i s coordinated w i t h the CARDS food safety project. 

3.4. Sustainable na tu ra l resource management 

3.4.1. Country-Level Indicators 
34. 
C roa t ia has achieved significant progress in aligning its legislation w i th the EU 
acquis on environment. B y adopting the new Environment Act in late 2007, Croatia established 
the basis for full compliance with the EU acquis on environment. Considerable progress, in 
particular, has been made in the areas o f air, water, nature protection, chemicals and GMOs. Due 
to s t i l l relatively weak administrative capacity, the European Commission identified a 
benchmark fo r opening negotiations on environment, related to the strengthening o f 
administrative capacities a t the national, regional, and loca l l e v e l s . As anticipated, environment 
i s among the most challenging EU chapters, along w i t h agriculture, bo th in t e r m s o f po l icy and 
investments. Improvement o f water quality i s part o f this challenge, and Croatia has made 
sustained progress in this field. Wh i le major investments in improving wastewater management 
and water po l lu t ion control have been launched, substantial improvements are s t i l l needed in 
coverage o f water se rv ice delivery. In this regard, the government adopted a Water Sector 
Strategy for 2008-2023, in the second h a l f o f 2007, defining the ob’ectives Croatia plans to 
achieve in water supply, water coverage and wastewater treatment4/. At the same time, the 
government continued i t s efforts to reduce dependency on fossil fue ls . In l i n e w i t h the Kyo to 
protocol49, ratified in April 2007, Croatia has to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions b y 5 
pe rcen t in the f i rs t commitment period between 2008 and 2012 in relation to the base year. The 
M in is t ry o f Environmental Protection, Physical Planning and Construction (MEPPPC) also 
prepared the draft National Strategy on Climate Change and Kyo to Protocol w i t h Ac t ion Plan, 
iden t i fy ing sector measures and goals up to 2012. Finally, Croatia adopted a secondary 
legislation on renewable energy resources (RER) in July 2007, wh ich established the minimum 
share o f RER in the power generation m i x and procedures for p rov id ing financial support to 
developers o f RER.

The coverage and quality o f wastewater services i n Croatia are lower than in recent EU member countries. 44% o f the 
population has adequate wastewater collection systems and only 25% o f the collected wastewater i s treated. 
A t November 2006 conference o f UNFCCC parties, additional 3500 Gg C 0 2 eq was granted to Croatia, thus setting the 
baseline (1990) at 34620 Gg C 0 2 eq.

Annex 5 : CAS Completion Report 

3.4.2. Status o f key outcomes and intermediate indicators/milestones 
35 . 
Increased environmental management capacity. Many o f the key outcomes were 
partially achieved without involvement o f the Bank. For example, the government strengthened 
the legislative and regulatory framework b y introducing horizontal legislation, wh ich i s fu l ly in 
l i n e with the EU acqu is . The government also introduced a public-private partnership model in 
the waste management system through the National Waste Management Plan for 2007 - 2015, 
and training o f staff. The weak institutional capacity which s tems f rom the fragmentation o f the 
sector remains an important challenge, also recognized b y the EU. The Bank, through the 
Environment T A and BNPP Dutch Trust Funds, helped in training and capacity-building for 
the IPPC Directive (“mock” peer review w i t h EU) and in establishing a benchmarking 
environmental enforcement indicators program through the EC EN A network. The Karst 
Ecosystem Conservation (KEC) Project financed a biodiversity database system, provided 
equipment, and established monitoring protocols, as well as standardized management planning 
for national parks and nature parks, wh ich were subsequently adopted country-wide for a l l 
protected areas. The Environment T A supported a workshop to raise awareness o f the needs in 
the sector and help promote private sector involvement in waste management. 
36. 
Improved wastewater management and water supply. Constructing new wastewater 
treatment facilities or upgrading existing ones (Zagreb, Senj, Koprivnica, Zadar, Vinkovci, Split) 
represent an important step towards meeting EU environmental standards. Wastewater treatment 
s t i l l remains l o w at 25 percent, and wastewater connection i s at about 40 percent, indicating that 
Croatia needs to invest additional efforts in this sector. As a result o f the implementation o f th ree 
Bank-financed projects in the water sector, there has been significant improvement in water 
quality in the coastal and in land areas. Water samples in the Brac channel and the Kas te la Bay 
indicate significant reduction in the number o f total co l i fo rm bacteria, fo l low ing the completion 
o f the wastewater system for Split and Solin, under the Municipal Environmental 
Infrastructure Project. Fo l low ing completion o f the V inkovc i wastewater treatment plant 
(Reconstruction Project f o r Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Srijem), water quality 
o f river Bosut has significantly improved. As a resu l t o f the completion o f the sewage system in 
the tourist resort Opatija, coastal water in the area i s n ow o f bathing quality (the Coastal Cities 
Pollution Control Project). Finally, investments financed b y the Croatian Waters, as we l l as 
those supported b y the international financial institutions, led to an increased number o f 
connections to public water supply and wastewater systems. 
37. 
Progress toward meeting the international obligations under the Kyoto Protocol to 
reduce greenhouse emission. The government developed a national strategy for implementation 
o f obligations under the Kyo to Protocol and an action plan, iden t i fy ing goals and measures fo r 
achieving the targets se t . The Bank has supported Croatia’s e f fo r ts in meeting the Kyo to Protocol 
obligations through two projects: Energy Efficiency Project (EE) and Renewable Energy 
Resources Project (RER). The GEF Energy Efficiency (EE) Project has facilitated the creation 
o f an energy efficiency market in Croatia, mainly through HEP’s ow n energy services company 
(ESCO) and i s supporting the engagement o f four local banks in the financing o f energy 
efficiency services. An adequate institutional and legislative framework for RER was established 
in July 2007 fo l low ing Bank support to the Ministry o f Economy, Labor and Entrepreneurship. 
The GEF Renewable Energy Resources Project effectively supports the government and 
stakeholders in the development o f a RER market. The support has included: the establishment 
o f a Registry o f RER Projects and Privileged Producers, removing bottlenecks in the procedures

4. Bank performance during the CAS period 
38. 
Program overview. The C A S envisaged three-lending scenarios and a triggers 
framework f o r m o v i n g f r o m one case t o another. Though i t was anticipated that C roa t ia w o u l d 
move t o the base case by the end o f FY05 , this ma te r ia l ized o n l y in September 2005 with the 
de l ive ry o f the PAL. F o l l ow i n g the C A S mid-term rev iew , the lending scenarios remained but 
the triggers we re streamlined in v i ew o f Croatia’s performance and the launch o f the EU 
accession negotiations. Overall, the expected outcomes o f the C A S did n o t change at the C A S 
review, with o n l y some mod i f ica t ions to the lend ing p rog ram ( in t roduc t ion o f the Revenue 
Adm in is t ra t ion Mode rn iza t ion Project and the Jud ic ia l R e f o rm Project). A so l id p o r t f o l i o was 
built up over the C A S period, consisting o f 13 projects and one add i t iona l f inanc ing loan f o r a 
to ta l o f US$988 m i l l i o n . In the f i n a l phase o f the CAS , the s l ow d ow n o f re fo rms in the pre- 
e lec t ion p e r i o d delayed the effectiveness o f PAL2. Howeve r , o n balance, based o n the 
achievements o f intended C A S outcomes across the f o u r C A S pillars, the ove ra l l C A S p rog ram 
i s assessed as satisfactory. 
39. 
Portfolio performance. T h e current p o r t f o l i o o f d isbu rs ing operations amounts t o 
US$1.07 b i l l i o n 5 ’ , and i t represen ts the largest p o r t f o l i o since the B a n k started i t s ac t iv i t ies in 
Croatia. With US$522 m i l l i o n approved in FY07 , C roa t ia was the second largest E C A borrower, 
with a ma jo r increase in net commitments ( f r om US$592 t o US$1,109 m i l l ion ) . The number o f 
new projects and the ma jo r increase in commitments, as well as l o a n closures, resulted in a 
re la t ive ly young p o r t f o l i o (average age o f 3.2 years during the C A S period), but also caused an 
explainable drop in the disbursement ra t io f r o m 19 percent in FY05 , th rough 17 percent in FY06 , 
t o 16 percent in F Y 0 7 (above E C A average in FY05 ; b e l ow E C A average later). 

40. 
P o r t f o l i o performance has been uneven during the C A S pe r iod . F o l l ow i n g m a j o r 
problems in F Y 0 4 (37 percen t o f comm i tmen ts at risk), the Bank prepared p ro jec t imp rovemen t 
plans, which enabled five unsatisfactory projects t o be upgraded during FY 0 5 . N o n e o f the 
projects in the p o r t f o l i o closed with unsatisfactory rating, though several closed with mode ra te ly 
satisfactory ra t ing . In FY06 , t w o new projects were in p rob lem status, but corrective measures 
agreed at the Jo in t P o r t f o l i o Rev iew (JPR) led t o reso lv ing the bottlenecks. The government 
acknowledged the JPR as a u s e f u l m o n i t o r i n g t o o l and in t roduced an annual r e v i ew o f a l l I F 1

Country dialogue. The C A S was prepared in close cooperation with and received clear 
owne rsh ip f r o m the government. The Bank ’s coun t ry o f f i c e engaged in C A S consultations across 
the country, with a b road range o f stakeholders; in add i t ion t o the authorities at the central and 
the regionalAoca1 leve ls , consultations inc luded c i v i l society, parliamentarians, and sma l l 
bus iness and trade u n i o n representatives. The rationale was the country’s launch o f accelerated 
EU accession efforts, w h i c h required wider pub l ic support fo r the upcom ing reforms. The B a n k 
also launched v i r tua l p u b l i c consultations o n the C A S Progress Report, by pos t ing the d ra f t 
report o n the Bank’s website. Regular C A S stock taking with the government and stakeholders 
helped guide the Bank’s assistance p rog ram over the C A S pe r iod . This enabled the Bank t o 
adjust i t s p rog ram and m o b i l i z e i t s resources in a timely manner f o r example by: (i) p r o v i d i n g

t o comp ly with the EU N i t ra tes D i rec t ive . Mo reove r , the PAL -suppo r ted re fo rms were closely 
coordinated with 
the EU, 
in pa r t icu la r 
in the areas o f p u b l i c administration, 
privatizatiodrestructuring, j u d i c i a r y and ra i lways . The m a i n v i s i o n was t o respect the coun t ry 
priorities as the driving force o f the programs, and support government-led donor coordination. 
Hence, a l l j o i n t workshops (pub l ic adm in is t ra t ion reform, decentralization, j u d i c i a r y and 
f iduc ia ry systems) were organized with the government’s co-chair role, while the agreements 
between the B a n k and the E C were shared with the Ministry o f Finance and the Cen t ra l State 
O f f i c e for Deve lopmen t Strategy and Coo rd ina t ion o f EU Funds (CODEF), t o he lp CODEF ’s 
donor coo rd ina t ion ro le . 
45. 
The B a n k coordinated i t s w o r k in specific development areas with the UN agencies, 
name ly U N H C R and U N D P , with emphasis o n supporting programs o f economic and social 
rev i ta l iza t ion o f the areas o f specials state concern. Cooperation with UNDP was also developed 
in areas o f energy e f f ic iency and social welfare. During the C A S period, EBRD has been a co- 
f inanc ing partner under three projects, the Railway Modernization and Restructuring Project, 
Municipal Environmental Infrastructure Project and the Trade and Transport Integration 
Project. The B a n k and EBRD also jo in t ly prepared a Country Procurement Assessment 
Report (CPAR). As f o r the r o l e o f b i la te ra l donors, Japan, Netherlands, Sweden (Sida - 
Swedish In te rna t iona l Deve lopmen t Agency), UK (DfiD and B r i t i s h Counc i l ) and U S (USAID) 
were among the k e y partners in this CAS . D o n o r coo rd ina t ion l e d t o j o i n t f inanc ing e f fo r ts in the

46. 
Bank performance. In a cha l leng ing environment o f uneven re fo rm implementation, 
overall, Bank performance during the C A S pe r iod was satisfactory. First, the Bank’s C A S 
consultation process was carried ou t in accordance with the recommendations o f the c l ien t 
survey, conducted in 2003, recogn iz ing that dissemination o f the ra t iona le f o r the r e f o rm agenda 

63 

Croatia: Country Partnership Strategy for FY09-FY 12 

Annex 5 : CAS Completion Report 

was particularly important for success fu l implementation. Second, the Bank aligned the CAS 
w i t h Croatia’s EU agenda, supporting the country’s accelerated accession efforts. This was done 
b y designing the program and projects to support the country’s obligations for EU harmonization 
and b y increased coordination w i t h the EC. Third, the Bank made an impact on public debate 
through knowledge sharing. Finally, and most importantly, implementation o f the CAS program 
has improved development outcomes in several areas as described in the previous chapters. 

5. Lessons Learned 

47. 
A number of important lessons relevant for the design o f the new CPS emerged 
from the CAS Completion Report. First, a more flexible CAS structure would be 
appropriate going forward. When the CAS was o r ig ina l ly designed, Croatia had h igh and 
progressively growing external debt, large fiscal deficit and a lapsed I M F program (new IMF 
Stand-by Arrangement was signed in August 2004), and the re was an expressed des i re on the 
part o f the government to have a strong Wo r ld Bank program to support po l icy reform efforts. 
The combination o f these factors led to a tightly-designed CAS w i t h detailed triggers mov ing the 
program f rom one scenario to the other. 
48. Many important reforms have been implemented under the PAL program as 
described in this report. Howeve r , there has been hesitation o r even backtracking at times, 
especially in the period leading to the parliamentary elections. This created uncertainty 
about the fate and t im ing o f some investment projects that were included in the base and h i g h 
case scenarios. Given the many different counterparts wo rk ing on those projects, who had 
limited or no impact on the implementation o f the P A L program, these uncertainties have created 
difficulties in managing relationships and planning ahead fo r both the Bank and the authorities. 
Furthermore, Croatia has maintained strong macroeconomic performance and solid economic 
growth for a prolonged period o f time, and the Bank’s contribution to Croatia’s external 
financing needs was rather modest. Thus the lesson for the new CPS i s that Croatia w i l l benefit 
f rom continued intensive analytical and advisory wo rk and a focused program o f investment 
loans and other non-policy based instruments. These w i l l not depend on but w i l l be 
complemented, as warranted, b y single-tranche DPLs in areas where opportunities arise, and 
where there i s strong po l i t ica l support and government commitment, and the coordination o f 
cross cutting reforms i s ensured. 
49. 
Second, the PAL program was designed to support a broad and politically difficult 
reform agenda. Wh i le some o f the planned actions represented f i r s t generation reforms (such as 
the reduction o f subsidies, privatization o f companies in the competitive sector), taken together, 
they comprised a po l i t ica l ly and socially difficult package ( f rom restructuring o f the railways 
company to the reform o f social benefits and the privatization o f shipyards). The government 
and the Bank both believed and continue to believe that these reforms are important priorities, 
but full implementation has proven d i f f icu l t . Go ing forward, Croatia’s reforms may be better 
supported b y DPLs that focus on a more narrowly defined agenda. Such DPLs wou ld support an 
overall medium-term re fo rm program through a se r ies o f single tranche loans w i t h clearly 
responsible and accountable government counterparts. 
50. 
Third, effectiveness delays and uneven implementation progress of projects was 
reflected in relatively slow disbursements and require actions on both sides. On the Bank’s 
side, ensuring implementation readiness o f projects, inc lud ing the availability o f implementation 

64

capacity and the preparation o f procurement documents, remains crucial. As f o r the authorities, 
reduc ing the processing t im e f o r p ro jec t effectiveness, a l loca t ing necessary resources t o create 
imp lemen ta t ion capacity and strengthening the Ministry o f Finance’s coo rd ina t ion ro le and 
support func t ion vis-a-vis the implementing agencies, c o u l d he lp imp rove p ro jec t performance 
and accelerate the f low o f funds.
